background there is lack of neuroscientific studies investigating music processing with naturalistic stimuli , and brain responses to real music are , thus , largely unknown .
methodology / principal findings this study investigates event - related brain potentials ( erps ) , skin conductance responses ( scrs ) and heart rate ( hr ) elicited by unexpected chords of piano sonatas as they were originally arranged by composers , and as they were played by professional pianists. from the musical excerpts played by the pianists ( with emotional expression ) , we also created versions without variations in tempo and loudness ( without musical expression ) to investigate effects of musical expression on erps and scrs .
compared to expected chords , unexpected chords elicited an early right anterior negativity ( eran , reflecting music - syntactic processing ) and an n5 ( reflecting processing of meaning information ) in the erps , as well as clear changes in the scrs ( reflecting that unexpected chords also elicited emotional responses ) .
the eran was not influenced by emotional expression , whereas n5 potentials elicited by chords in general ( regardless of their chord function ) differed between the expressive and the non - expressive condition .
conclusions / significance these results show that the neural mechanisms of music - syntactic processing operate independently of the emotional qualities of a stimulus , justifying the use of stimuli without emotional expression to investigate the cognitive processing of musical structure .
moreover , the data indicate that musical expression affects the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of musical meaning .
our data are the first to reveal influences of musical performance on erps and scrs , and to show physiological responses to unexpected chords in naturalistic music .
introduction during the last two decades , numerous studies have investigated neural correlates of music processing , of which surprisingly few actually used authentic musical stimuli ( for exceptions , see , e.g. , [ 1 ] - [ 3 ]) .
for example , the majority of experiments investigating music - syntactic processing used chord sequences played under computerized control without musical expression , and composed in a fashion which is often hardly reminiscent of natural music ( with the purpose to control for acoustical factors , or to present as many stimuli as possible in a relatively short time , e.g. [ 4 ] - [ 14 ]). with regards to neuroscientific experiments on music - syntactic processing , koelsch & mulder [ 15 ] used chord sequences recorded from classical cds , but the irregular chords used to investigate harmonic expectancy violations were produced by a pitch - shift of chords , thus not representing natural music - syntactic violations .
similarly , besson et al .
[ 16 ] used sung opera - melodies , but the irregular notes were introduced by the investigators and not originally composed that way ( see also besson & faita [ 17 ] in that study melodies were played by a computer , and irregular notes were introduced by the investigators ) .
to our knowledge , the only study that has investigated brain responses to irregular chords as composed by a composer , employed chorales from j.s. bach [ 18 ] .
however , although that study used the unexpected harmonies originally composed by bach to investigate music - syntactic processing , the chorales were played under computerized control ( without musical expression ) , thus not sounding like natural music ( see also patel et al .
[ 19 ] , for a study with self - composed music in popular style ) .
it is therefore an open question whether the hypotheses derived from previous neurophysiological studies on music - syntactic processing also apply to natural music .
in the present study , we used excerpts from classical piano sonatas , played by professional pianists , to investigate music - syntactic processing .
the excerpts contained a music - syntactically irregular chord as originally composed by the composer .
this allowed to test whether brain responses observed in previous studies in response to music - syntactic irregularities ( particularly the early right anterior negativity [ eran ] and the n5 [ 5 ] , [ 20 ] - [ 23 ]) can also be observed when listening to an authentic , and expressively played , musical stimulus .
for purposes of comparison , additional conditions were created in which the originally unexpected chords ( as composed by the composers ) were rendered harmonically expected , and harmonically very unexpected ( see figure 1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0002631.g001 figure 1 examples of experimental stimuli .
first , the original version of a piano sonata was played by a pianist .
this original version contained an unexpected chord as arranged by the composer ( see middle panel in the lower right ) .
after the recording , the midi file with the unexpected ( original ) chord was modified offline using midi software so that the unexpected chord became expected , or very unexpected chord ( see top and bottom panels ). from each of these three versions , another version without musical expression was created by eliminating variations in tempo and key - stroke velocities ( excerpts were modified offline using midi software ) .
thus , there were six versions of each piano sonata : versions with expected , unexpected , and very unexpected chords , and each of these versions played with and without musical expression .
moreover , we also produced non - expressive counterparts of the expressively played musical stimuli .
these non - expressive stimuli did not contain any variation in tempo ( and all notes were played with the same key - stroke velocity ) , enabling us to compare erp responses to unexpected harmonies between conditions in which the music was played expressively , or presented without any expression .
so far , no erp study has investigated the influence of musical performance on music perception , and it is not known if neural correlates underlying the processing of syntactic information are influenced by emotional expression .
previous studies have suggested that both eran and n5 reflect cognitive , not affective processes ( the eran the processing of music - syntactic information , and the n5 processes of harmonic integration ; e.g. [ 24 ]) .
thus it was expected that neither eran nor n5 would be influenced by aspects giving rise to emotion , and that they would thus not differ between the non - expressive and the expressive condition .
nevertheless , it is widely assumed that irregular musical events ( such as music - syntactically irregular chords ) give rise to emotional responses .
harmonically unexpected chords may lead to surprise or a feeling of suspense [ 25 ] , [ 18 ] .
in his classic text on musical meaning and emotion , leonard meyer [ 25 ] theorized that listeners often have ( implicit ) expectations of what will happen in the music and , depending on whether these expectations are fulfilled or not , experience relaxation or tension and suspense .
a previous study from steinbeis et al .
[ 18 ] provided a direct test of this theory , investigating the role of music - specific expectations in the generation of emotional responses in the listener .
in that study , unexpected chords elicited not only eran and n5 potentials in the eeg , but also an increased skin conductance response ( scr ) .
because the study from steinbeis et al .
[ 18 ] is , to our knowledge , the only study empirically testing a theory about how music evokes emotions ( see also [ 26 ]) , we aimed to replicate the findings of that study .
we therefore also recorded scrs elicited by expected and unexpected chords with the hypothesis that music - syntactically irregular chords ( which are perceived as less expected by listeners ) elicit a stronger scr compared to regular chords .
in addition to the scrs , we also recorded the heart rate ( hr ) to examine whether sympathetic effects elicited by unexpected harmonies can also be reflected in hr changes .
additionally , our experimental design also allowed us to compare scrs ( and hr ) between the expressive and the non - expressive condition .
previous studies have shown that expressive intentions by performers ( such as tension and relaxation ) are encoded by expressive cues ( for example , tempo and loudness ) to communicate emotion in a musical performance ( for a review , see [ 27 ]) .
because harmonically unexpected chords are widely seen as a means to produce tension ( see above ) , it was expected that such chords are played by performers in a way that produces an emotional response which is larger than when played without musical expression .
thus , we hypothesized that the scrs elicited by unexpected ( as compared to the scrs elicited by expected chords ) would be larger in the expressive than in the non - expressive condition .
in summary , we investigated erps , scrs , and hr in response to unexpected chords ( as composed by classical composers ) in a condition in which musical excerpts were played with musical expression by a pianist , and in a condition in which these excerpts were played without musical expression by a computer ( without variations in tempo or loudness ) .
we hypothesized that unexpected harmonies would elicit an eran and an n5 , and that both erps would not be influenced by musical expression .
moreover , we hypothesized that unexpected chords would elicit stronger scrs , and increased hr , compared to expected ones. with regards to musical expression , we hypothesized that scrs elicited by the expressive chords would elicit stronger scrs than the non - expressive chords , and that the scr effect of unexpected chords ( i.e. , scrs to expected chords subtracted from scrs to unexpected chords ) would be larger in the expressive than in the non - expressive condition .
methods participants 20 individuals ( aged 19 - 29 years , mean 24,7 ; 10 females ) participated in the experiment .
subjects were non - musicians who had not received any formal musical training besides normal school education .
all participants had a laterality quotient > 90 according to the edinburgh handedness inventory [ 28 ] .
written informed consent was obtained , the study was approved by the local ethics committee of the university of leipzig , and conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
stimuli stimuli were excerpts of 8 to 16 s duration , taken from 25 piano sonatas composed by l. v. beethoven , j. haydn , w.a. mozart and f. schubert .
excerpts were chosen such that they contained a harmonically ( slightly ) irregular , thus unexpected , chord at the end of the excerpt ( usually the onset of a change of key , see figure 1 for an example ) .
each excerpt was taken from a recording of a longer passage of the respective piano sonata .
passages were played by 4 professional pianists ( 2 of them female ) , and recorded using midi ( musical instrument digital interface ) and cubase sx ( steinberg media technologies gmbh , hamburg , germany ) software. from the midi files of these excerpts ( each containing at least one harmonically irregular chord ) , 25 further midi files were generated solely by modifying the tones of the irregular chord in a way that this chord became the harmonically most regular , and thus the most expected , chord ( always the tonic chord , see example in figure 1 ) .
this procedure was also performed using cubase sx. similarly , 25 further midi files were generated by rendering the harmonically irregular chord to a very irregular chord ( always a neapolitan sixth chord , see also figure 1 ) .
thus , there were three versions of each of the 25 excerpts : ( 1 ) the original version with the unexpected chord ( as arranged by the composer ) , ( 2 ) the version in which this chord was expected , and ( 3 ) the version in which this chord was very unexpected , resulting in a total of 75 excerpts .
note that all versions of one excerpt were played with identical emotional expression , and that the only difference between these three versions of each excerpt was the different chord function ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) of the critical chord. from each of these 75 midi files , another midi file without emotional expression was created by eliminating all agogics ( i.e. , variations in tempo ) , and by adjusting the key - stroke velocity of all notes to the same value , thus eliminating all dynamics ( velocity was set to the mean velocity of the corresponding expressive version ) .
thus , there were 150 different midi files in total : 25 excerptsx3 different chord functions ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) x2 different emotional expressions ( expressive , non - expressive ) .
audio files of all midi files were generated as wav - files using cubase sx and the grand ( steinberg ) .
moreover , in addition to these 150 experimental stimuli , three additional pieces were taken and edited in the same way as described above ( resulting in eighteen different midi files ) , with the exception that one chord of the excerpt ( occurring in the beginning , the middle or the end of the piece ) was played by another instrument than piano ( such as marimba , harpsichord , or violin ) .
these timbre - deviants were used for the task of participants during the eeg and scr recordings ( see next section for details ) .
to evaluate the impact of the stimulus material on individually perceived emotions , a behavioural experiment was conducted with an independent group of subjects .
twenty - five non - musicians ( age range 19 - 30 years , mean age 24.3 years , 12 females ) were presented with the 150 experimental stimuli ( no stimuli with timbre - deviants were presented , duration of the behavioural testing session was about 45 min ) .
after each excerpt , participants rated how ( un ) pleasant , aroused , and surprised they felt during the last musical excerpt .
emotional valence ( pleasantness ) and arousal were assessed using 9 - point scales with self - assessment manikins [ 29 ] , with 1 corresponding to very unpleasant ( or very relaxing , respectively ) and 9 corresponding to very pleasant ( or very arousing , respectively ) .
surprise was assessed using a 9 - point likert scale , with 1 corresponding to not being surprised at all , and 9 to being very surprised .
excerpts with expected chords only were rated as most pleasant , least arousing , and least surprising , whereas excerpts with a very unexpected chord were rated as least pleasant , most arousing , and most surprising ( ratings for excerpts with an unexpected [ original ] chord lay between ratings for expected and very unexpected chords with regards to valence , arousal , and surprise , see table 1 and figure 2 ) .
an anova on the valence ratings with factors chord ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) and expression ( expressive , non - expressive ) indicated an effect of chord ( f ( 2,48 ) = 12.85 , p <. 0001 ) , an effect of expression ( f ( 1,24 ) = 22.58 , p <. 0001 ) , and no two - way interaction ( p = . 57 ) .
likewise , the analogous anova for the arousal ratings indicated an effect of chord ( f ( 2,48 ) = 7.36 , p <. 005 ) , an effect of expression ( f ( 1,24 ) = 62.31 , p <. 0001 ) , and no two - way interaction ( p = . 48 ) .
finally , the analogous anova for the surprise ratings again indicated an effect of chord ( f ( 2,48 ) = 13.61 , p <. 0001 ) , an effect of expression ( f ( 1,24 ) = 83.02 , p <. 0001 ) , and no two - way interaction ( p = . 23 ; p - values were greenhouse - geisser corrected in all three anovas ) .
paired t - tests conducted separately for valence , arousal , and surprise ratings indicated that all six experimental conditions ( see table 1b ) differed significantly from each other ( p <=. 05 in all tests ) , except valence and arousal ratings for unexpected and very unexpected in the expressive condition , and surprise ratings for unexpected and expected in the non - expressive condition .

b shows ratings ( mean and sem ) separately for each of the six experimental conditions .
procedure participants were informed about the chords played with a deviant instrument , asked to detect such chords , and to indicate their detection by pressing a response button .
as examples , two sequences with a deviant instrument were presented before the start of the experiment .
the deviant instruments were only employed to control whether participants attended the musical stimulus ( this method has already been used in previous studies ; e.g. , [ 5 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 23 ]) .
participants were not informed about the experimental conditions of interest , i.e. neither were they informed about the different chord functions , nor about the manipulations of emotional expression .
during the experimental session , participants were instructed to look at a fixation cross .
each excerpt was followed by a silence interval of 1 s. each stimulus was presented twice during the experiment to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , the ordering of stimuli was pseudo - randomized .
the duration of an experimental session was approximately 70 min .
data recording and analysis the eeg was recorded using ag / agcl - electrodes from 32 locations of the extended 10 - 20 - system ( fp1 , fp2 , afz , af3 , af4 , af7 , af8 , fz , f3 , f4 , f7 , f8 , fc3 , fc4 , ft7 , ft8 , cz , c3 , c4 , t7 , t8 , cp5 , cp6 , pz , p3 , p4 , p7 , p8 , o1 , o2 , nose - tip , and right mastoid ) , using an electrode placed on the left mastoid as reference .
sampling rate was 500 hz. after the measurement , eeg - data were re - referenced to the algebraic mean of the left and right mastoid electrodes ( to obtain a symmetric reference ) , and filtered using a 0.25 - 25 - hz band - pass filter ( 1001 points , finite impulse response ) to reduce artifacts .
horizontal and vertical electrooculograms ( eogs ) were recorded bipolarly .
for measurement of the skin conductance response ( scr ) two electrodes were placed on the medial phalanx of the index and middle finger of the left hand .
for the calculation of the inter - heartbeat - interval ( ibi ) , an electrocardiogram ( ecg ) was measured by placing two electrodes at the inner sides of the wrists of the left and the right arm .
for rejection of artifacts in the eeg data , each sampling point was centred in a gliding window and rejected if the standard deviation within the window exceeded a threshold value : artifacts caused by drifts or body movements were eliminated by rejecting sampling points whenever the standard deviation of a 200 - ms or 800 - ms gliding window exceeded 25 microv at any eeg electrode .
eye artifacts were rejected whenever the standard deviation of a 200 - ms gliding window exceeded 25 microv at the vertical or the horizontal eog ( rejections were controlled by the authors ) .
erps were calculated using a 200 - ms prestimulus baseline .
the electrodermal activity ( eda ) data were visually inspected and checked for artifacts caused by movement or failures of the recording device .
data were rejected whenever there was an unusually steep onset of the eda .
data - analysis for statistical analysis , mean amplitude values were computed for four regions of interest ( rois ) : left anterior ( f7 , f3 , ft7 , fc3 ) , right anterior ( f8 , f4 , ft8 , fc4 ) , left posterior ( c3 , cp5 , p7 , p3 ) and right posterior ( c4 , cp6 , p4 , p8 ) .
to test whether erps to expected ( regular ) and unexpected ( irregular ) chords differ from each other , and whether such differences are lateralized or differ between anterior and posterior scalp regions , amplitude values of erps were analyzed statistically by repeated measures anovas .
anovas were conducted with factors chord ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) , hemisphere ( left , right rois ) , and anterior - posterior distribution ( anterior , posterior rois ) .
main effects of chord , as well as interactions involving factor chord were adjusted using the greenhouse - geisser correction .
all statistical analyses of erps were computed on the data referenced to the algebraic mean of m1 and m2 .
the time window for statistical analysis of the eran was 140 - 220 ms , for the n5 500 - 580 ms. because the eran is defined as the difference between regular ( expected ) and irregular ( unexpected ) chords ( e.g. [ 5 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 30 ]) , amplitude values and latencies of the eran were calculated from the difference erps ( expected subtracted from unexpected , and expected subtracted from very unexpected chords , respectively ) .
amplitudes of eran and n5 effects ( expected subtracted from unexpected , and expected subtracted from very unexpected chords ) were tested one - sided according to our hypotheses .
to facilitate legibility of erps , erps were low - pass filtered after statistical evaluation ( 10 hz , 41 points , finite impulse response ) .
results behavioural data ( timbre detection task ) participants detected 96.2 percent of the timbre deviants in the expressive , and 95.9 percent in the non - expressive condition ( p = . 98 , paired t - test ) , indicating that participants attended to the timbre of the musical stimulus , and that they did not have difficulties in reliably detecting the timbre deviants ( neither in the expressive , nor in the non - expressive condition ) .
electrodermal activity figure 3a shows the skin conductance responses ( scrs ) to expected , unexpected ( original ) , and very unexpected chords , averaged across all subjects ( and across both expressive and non - expressive conditions ) .
compared to expected chords , both unexpected and very unexpected chords elicited a tonic scr with an onset of around 500 ms , the scr being largest for very unexpected chords .
figure 3b shows the scrs separately for all chords played with and without expression .
the expressive chords elicited a more phasic scr which was stronger than the scr to non - expressive chords , the scr amplitude being maximal at around 2.5 seconds .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0002631.g003 figure 3 skin conductance responses ( scrs ) .
a : grand - average of scrs elicited by expected , unexpected ( original ) , and very unexpected chords ( averaged across expressive and non - expressive conditions ) .
compared to expected chords , unexpected and very unexpected chords elicited clear scrs .
notably , the scr elicited by very unexpected chords was larger than the scr to unexpected ( original ) chords , showing that the magnitude of scrs is related to the degree of harmonic expectancy violation .
b : grand - average of scrs elicited by expressive and non - expressive chords ( averaged across expected , unexpected , and very unexpected conditions ) .
compared to non - expressive chords , chords played with musical expression elicited a clear scr .
a global anova with factors chord ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) and expression ( expressive , non - expressive ) for a time window ranging from 1.5 to 3.5 sec indicated an effect of expression ( f ( 1,19 ) = 5.17 , p < 0.05 , reflecting that expressive chords elicited a stronger scr than non - expressive chords ) , a marginal effect of chord ( f ( 2,38 ) = 2.53 , p = 0.09 , reflecting that scrs to very unexpected , unexpected , and expected chords differed from each other ) , but no two - way interaction ( p = . 79 ) .
the effect of chord was significant ( f ( 1,19 ) = 4.66 , p <. 05 ) when an analogous anova was conducted for a longer time window ( 1.5 to 8 s , justified because the effect of chord was more tonic than the effect of expression , see figure 3a vs. 3b ) .
two - tailed paired t - tests showed that this effect of chord was due to a significant difference in scrs between very unexpected and expected chords ( p < 0.05 ) , and between very unexpected and unexpected chords ( p <. 05 ) .
although clearly visible in the waveforms , the difference in scrs between unexpected and expected chords was statistically not significant ( p = . 22 ) .
although the anovas did not indicate an interaction between factors chord and expression , we also inspected the single subject data sets for differences in scr effects between the expressive and the non - expressive conditions ( to exclude that the large variance typical for scr data rendered the results of the anova spurious ) .
in 16 ( out of 20 ) participants the difference in scrs between very unexpected and expected chords was larger for the expressive than for the non - expressive chords , but only 9 participants showed this effect of expression for the difference between unexpected ( original ) and expected chords .
a chi - square test on the scr effects of very unexpected chords ( scrs to expected chords subtracted from scrs to very unexpected chords in the time window from 1.5 to 3.5 s ) , indicated that significantly more subjects displayed a larger scr when chords were played with expression than when they were played without expression ( x ( 1 ) = 7.2 , p < 0.01 ) .
heart rate there were no significant differences in the inter - heartbeat interval ( ibi ) following the presentation of the three types of chords ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) in any of the three time windows ( 0 - 2 sec : p >. 7 ; 2 - 4 sec : p >. 3 ; 4 - 6 sec : p >. 3 ) , and the ibis were identical when calculated for entire expressive and non - expressive excerpts ( 0.92 sec in each condition ) .
electroencephalogram eran compared to the expected chords , both unexpected ( original ) and very unexpected chords elicited an eran ( figure 4 ) .
the peak latency of the eran elicited by unexpected chords ( expected subtracted from unexpected chords ) was 158 ms , and 180 ms for the eran elicited by very unexpected chords ( expected subtracted from very unexpected chords ) .
as expected , the eran elicited by very unexpected chords was nominally larger ( - 0.84 microv ) than the eran elicited by unexpected chords ( - 0.74 microv ) , but this difference was statistically not significant ( amplitude values were calculated for frontal rois in the time window from 140 to 220 ms as difference potentials , expected subtracted from [ very ] unexpected chords ) .
moreover , the eran was identical for the expressive and the non - expressive condition ( - 0.79 microv in each condition ) .

compared to expected chords , both unexpected and very unexpected chords elicited an eran and an n5 .
the insets in the two bottom panels show isopotential maps of the eran and the n5 effect ( expected subtracted from [ very ] unexpected chords ) .
a global anova with factors chord ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) , expression ( expressive , non - expressive ) , anterior - posterior distribution , and hemisphere for a time window from 140 to 220 ms indicated an interaction between factors chord , anterior - posterior and hemisphere ( f ( 2,38 ) = 3.6 , p <. 05 , reflecting that the eran amplitude was largest at right anterior leads ) .
a follow - up anova with factors chord and expression for the right anterior roi indicated an effect of chord ( f ( 2,38 ) = 4.01 , p <. 05 ; reflecting that erps elicited by expected , unexpected , and very unexpected chords differed from each other ) , but no effect of expression ( p = . 26 ) , and no two - way interaction ( p = . 73 ) .
paired t - tests for the anterior roi indicated that both unexpected ( compared to expected ) and very unexpected ( compared to expected ) chords elicited an eran ( both p <. 05 ) .
a paired t - test for the anterior roi comparing directly the erp amplitudes of unexpected and very unexpected chords did not indicate a difference ( p = 0.36 ) .
n5 in the erps of both unexpected and very unexpected chords , the eran was followed by a late negativity ( the n5 , figure 4 ) .
compared to expected chords , the n5 was nominally larger for very unexpected than for unexpected ( original ) chords , but this difference was statistically not significant .
the amplitudes of the n5 effects ( unexpected or very unexpected chords compared to expected chords ) did not clearly differ between the expressive and the non - expressive condition .
interestingly , when comparing all expressive chords to all non - expressive chords , the n5 was larger for expressive chords ( figure 5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0002631.g005 figure 5 grand - average of brain electric responses to expressive and non - expressive chords ( averaged across expected , unexpected , and very unexpected conditions ) .
expressive chords elicited a negative effect in the n100 - range ( being maximal at central electrodes ) , and an n5 that was larger than the n5 elicited by non - expressive chords .
the bottom insets show isopotential maps of the n1 and n5 effect ( non - expressive subtracted from expressive chords ) .
a global anova with factors chord ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) , expression , anterior - posterior distribution , and hemisphere for the time window from 500 to 580 ms indicated an interaction between chord and anterior - posterior ( f ( 1,19 ) = 13.77 , p < 0.0001 , reflecting that the n5 was larger over anterior than over posterior regions ) .
the analogous anova for anterior rois indicated significant effects of chord ( f ( 2,38 ) = 2.96 , p < 0.05 , tested one - sided according to our hypothesis ) and of expression ( f ( 1,19 ) = 7.27 , p < 0.02 ) , but no interaction between factors chord and expression ( p = . 17 ) .
paired t - tests for the anterior rois indicated that both unexpected ( compared to expected ) and very unexpected ( compared to expected ) chords elicited significant effects ( both p <. 05 ) .
a paired t - test for the anterior roi comparing directly the erp amplitudes of unexpected and very unexpected chords did not indicate a difference ( p = 0.76 ) .
p3a following the eran , the erps of both unexpected and very unexpected chords compared to expected chords were more positive around 300 ms , particularly over left anterior leads ( see figure 4 ) .
to test whether this difference reflects the elicitation of a p3a ( see discussion for functional significance of the p3a ) , an anova was conducted with factors chord ( expected , unexpected , very unexpected ) , expression , and hemisphere for anterior rois and a time window from 250 - 350 ms. this anova did not indicate an effect of chord ( p = . 72 ) , nor any no two - or three - way interaction , indicating that unexpected or very unexpected chords did not elicit significant p3a effects .
expressive vs. non - expressive chords figure 5 shows erps elicited by all chords in the expressive and the non - expressive condition .
in addition to the larger n5 elicited by expressive compared to the non - expressive chords ( see above ) , the expressive chords also elicited an increased negativity over central electrodes in the time window from 80 to 120 ms ( this effect is presumably an increased n100 due to the fact that the critical chords were usually played more loudly in the expressive condition , see also discussion ) .
an anova for the time - window from 80 to 120 ms with factors expression , anterior - posterior distribution , and hemisphere did not indicate an effect of expression ( p = . 16 ) .
however , an anova computed for central electrodes only ( t7 , t8 , c3 , c4 ) with factor expression ( time window 80 to 120 ms ) indicated a significant effect ( f ( 1,19 ) = 4.70 , p <. 05 ) .
discussion electrodermal activity and heart rate compared to expected chords , very unexpected chords elicited a significant skin conductance response ( scr ) .
a smaller scr effect was clearly observable for unexpected ( original ) chords , although this effect was statistically not significant .
these scr data replicate findings from a previous study [ 18 ] , suggesting that unexpected harmonies elicit an emotional response , and that the strength of this response increases with increasing unexpectedness of a harmony .
the notion that the scrs to ( very ) unexpected chords reflect effects of emotional processing is also supported by the emotion ratings : these ratings showed that excerpts with expected chords differed from those with an unexpected , and even more so from those with a very unexpected chord in terms of emotional valence , arousal , and surprise .
our findings hence lend further support to the theory of meyer [ 25 ] that violations of harmonic expectancy elicit emotional responses in listeners ( such as tension - relaxation or surprise ; see also [ 26 ]) .
it is unlikely that the scrs elicited by the ( very ) unexpected chords were simply due to attentional mechanisms or orienting reflexes which could have been triggered by these chords , because the erp analysis showed that neither unexpected nor very unexpected chords elicited a significant p3a .
attentional mechanisms and orienting reflexes are usually reflected in p3a potentials ( e.g , [ 31 ]) , even when subjects do not have to attend to a stimulus , or a stimulus dimension .
if the significant scr to very unexpected chords ( as well as the scr to unexpected chords ) could be explained by attention - capturing mechanisms ( or orienting reflexes ) triggered by such chords , then a significant p3a should have been observable in the erps , which was not the case .
the scrs to all chords played with expression were larger compared to the scrs to all non - expressive chords .
note that , originally , the expressive chords were all slightly unexpected chords as arranged by the composer ( and these original versions with unexpected chords were the ones played by the pianists ) .
to increase the emotional response to such unexpected harmonies , performers use means of emotional expression in music , such as playing the notes with increased or decreased key - stroke velocity ( e.g. , an accent , or an unexpectedly soft timbre ) .
thus , when rendered expected , or very unexpected , the critical chords in the expressive conditions all differed in their key - stroke velocity compared to the preceding chords ( most of them being played with an accent , i.e. with increased loudness ) , whereas all notes in the non - expressive condition were played with the same key - stroke velocity as all other chords .
it is probable that this increased loudness of the expressive chords led to the increased scr ( as well as to the increased n100 amplitude to expressive chords ). with regards to the scr , an alternative explanation is that all chords in the expressive condition elicited stronger electrodermal activity as a function of being more emotionally expressive and eliciting the appropriate emotion - related response in the listener ( consistent with the behavioural data showing that expressive excerpts were perceived as more arousing than non - expressive excerpts ) ; this issue remains to be specified .
it is not possible that the scrs to expressive chords were larger simply because of increased resources required to discern the timbre deviants , or because of increased expectancies for the timbre deviants during the expressive condition ( which could have led to increased tonic levels of electrodermal activity ) : first , general differences in processing demands would have been reflected in the skin conductance level across entire excerpts ( and thus not be visible in the scrs to chords that were calculated using a baseline preceding the chords ) .
second , the behavioural data of the timbre detection task indicate that this task was comparably easy in both expressive and non - expressive conditions .
finally , the heart rate calculated for entire excerpts ( reflecting the vagal tone during listening to the excerpts ) was identical for expressive and non - expressive excerpts , rendering it unlikely that the task of detecting the timbre deviants was more engaging , or more attention - demanding , in the expressive condition .
interestingly , the scrs elicited by very unexpected chords ( compared to expected chords ) tended to be more pronounced when these chords were played with expression compared to when played without expression. that is , it appears that the emotional response elicited by a ( very ) unexpected harmony can be enhanced when perceived in a musical context played with emotional expression ( using variations in loudness and tempo ) .
note that purely physical differences between expressive and non - expressive conditions cannot account for this effect , because we compared the difference in scrs between expected and ( very ) unexpected harmonies , separately for the expressive , and for the non - expressive music .
no significant changes in the inter - heartbeat interval ( ibi ) for the three different types of chords were observed ( as in a recent study by steinbeis et al .
[ 18 ]) , and no differences in ibis were measured between expressive and non - expressive chords .
we surmise that the lack of ibi changes is due to the short duration of the events of interest ( i.e. , of the chords ) , and perhaps due to the relatively small differences in emotional valence between chords ( although these differences were statistically significant in the behavioural data ) .
thus , scrs ( which differed between expected , unexpected , and very unexpected chords ) appear to be more suitable to investigate sympathetic effects of emotional responses to harmonic irregularities in music .
electroencephalogram eran compared to the expected chords , unexpected ( original ) chords elicited an eran .
this is the first evidence showing that unexpected chords , as arranged by a composer , and as played by pianists , elicit an eran .
previous studies have either used rather artificial musical stimuli ( see introduction ) to have the maximum control over the acoustic properties of the stimuli , or used original excerpts which were played by a computer [ 18 ] , or used excerpts played by a musician , but with unexpected musical events that were arranged by the experimenters ( and not by the composer [ 15 ] , [ 16 ]) .
the present data , thus , show brain responses to authentic musical stimuli , i.e. , to music as it was actually composed by a composer , and played by a pianist .
the eran elicited by very unexpected chords was nominally larger than the eran elicited by unexpected chords ( as hypothesized , although this difference was statistically not significant ) .
this tentatively replicates results of previous studies [ 5 ] , [ 18 ] showing that the amplitude of the eran increases with increasing harmonic irregularity , and thus unexpectedness , of a chord .
note that it is unlikely that the eran is simply an attention effect on the n100 component , because the eran latency was around 160 - 180 ms , which is well beyond the n100 latency .
also note that , due to its slightly larger magnitude , the eran elicited by the very unexpected chords extended into the p2 - range , which is in agreement with a number of previous studies [ 5 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 30 ] .
importantly , the eran did not differ between the expressive and the non - expressive condition. that is , the eran did not differ when elicited in a musical context played with emotional expression compared to when played without emotional expression .
this indicates that music - syntactic processing ( as indicated by the eran ) does not interact with the emotional expression of a musical excerpt. that is , the generation of the eran appears to be independent of the increased emotional response elicited by an unexpected harmony played with emotional expression ( as indicated by the scrs and the behavioural data ) .
this suggests that the neural mechanisms of music - syntactic processing operate independently of the emotional factors communicated by musical performance .
note that the outcome of music - syntactic processing ( which leads to the perception of unexpectedness of a harmonically irregular chord ) has clear effects on emotional processes ( as shown by the scrs to [ very ] unexpected chords , which were stronger than those to expected chords , see also above ) .
the finding that the eran did not differ between the expressive and non - expressive condition justifies the use of non - expressive musical stimuli in other studies on music - syntactic processing in order to have the maximum acoustic control over the stimulus .
n5 in both the expected and the very unexpected condition , the eran was followed by a late negativity , the n5 [ 5 ] , [ 20 ] - [ 23 ] .
the n5 is taken to reflect processing of harmonic integration which is at least partly related to the processing of musical meaning [ 24 ] , [ 5 ] .
for example , steinbeis and koelsch [ 32 ] showed an interaction between the n5 and the n400 ( elicited by semantic incongruities in language ) , suggesting that the integration of expected and unexpected events into a larger , meaningful musical context consumes partly resources that are also engaged in the processing of linguistic semantics .
the amplitude of the n5 effect ( expected subtracted from [ very ] unexpected chords ) did not clearly differ between the expressive and the non - expressive condition .
however , the n5 potentials clearly differed between all expressive and all non - expressive chords ( figure 5 ). with regards to this , it is important to note that the n5 is not only elicited by harmonically irregular ( unexpected ) chords , but also by harmonically regular ( expected ) chords [ 5 , 22 ; see also figure 4 ] : although irregular chords usually require a higher amount of harmonic integration ( leading to a larger n5 ) , regular chords also require integration into the harmonic context .
thus , both irregular ( unexpected ) and regular ( expected ) chords may elicit n5 potentials ( the n5 elicited by unexpected chords usually being larger than the n5 evoked by expected ones , see figure 4 ) .
the finding that the n5 ( averaged across expected , unexpected , and very unexpected chords ) was larger for chords played with emotional expression compared to chords played without such expression indicates that the n5 can be modulated by emotional expression .
the reason for this modulation is presumably that chords played with expression contain more meaning information ( because they contain information about the emotions and the intentions of the performer , [ 27 ]) , resulting in larger n5 potentials for expressive than for non - expressive chords .
notably , no effect of expression was found in the eran time window .
thus , whereas the eran is not influenced by emotional expression of a musical excerpt , the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of the n5 can be influenced by emotional expression .
conclusions our data show a number of physiological responses elicited by music played as naturally as one would encounter in real - life listening situations .
unexpected harmonies ( as actually arranged by composers ) elicited both eran and n5 potentials .
a number of previous studies used musical sequences that were played without expression under computerized control , raising the question whether eran and n5 are simply experimental artefacts .
the data from the expressive condition show that the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of both eran and n5 are also involved in the processing of real naturalistic music .
the scrs elicited by very unexpected chords ( compared to expected chords ) , tended to be influenced by the emotional expression of the musical performances , suggesting that emotional effects of the processing of unexpected chords are slightly stronger when elicited by expressive music. by contrast , the eran was not modulated by emotional expression .
this suggests that the neural mechanisms of music - syntactic processing operate independently of the emotional factors communicated by musical performance , and that the eran is , thus , a cognitive process which is independent of the emotional qualities of a stimulus .
this justifies the use of stimuli without emotional expression to investigate the cognitive processing of musical structure .
notably , the outcome of music - syntactic processing ( as reflected in the eran ) leads to the perception of unexpectedness of a harmonically irregular chord , and has clear effects on emotional processes as reflected by the scrs to unexpected chords .
the n5 elicited by chords in general ( regardless of their chord function ) was modulated by emotional expression , presumably because chords played with expression contain additional meaning information about the emotions and the intentions of the performer .
thus , our data also indicate that musical expression affects the neural mechanisms underlying harmonic integration and processing of musical meaning .
thus , the present results suggest that ( a ) the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of both eran and n5 are involved in the processing of real naturalistic music , ( b ) music - syntactic processing as reflected in the eran is a cognitive process which is independent of the emotional qualities of a stimulus , ( c ) emotional effects of the processing of unexpected chords are slightly stronger when elicited by expressive music , and ( d ) that musical expression affects the neural mechanisms underlying harmonic integration and processing of musical meaning .

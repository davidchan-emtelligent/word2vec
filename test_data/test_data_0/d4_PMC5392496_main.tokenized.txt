summary human susceptibility to obesity is mainly genetic , yet the underlying evolutionary drivers causing variation from person to person are not clear .
one theory rationalizes that populations that have adapted to warmer climates have reduced their metabolic rates , thereby increasing their propensity to store energy .
we uncover here the function of a gene that supports this theory .
thada is one of the genes most strongly selected during evolution as humans settled in different climates .
we report here that thada knockout flies are obese , hyperphagic , have reduced energy production , and are sensitive to the cold .
thada binds the sarco / er ca2 + atpase ( serca ) and acts on it as an uncoupler .
reducing serca activity in thada mutant flies rescues their obesity , pinpointing serca as a key effector of thada function .
in sum , this identifies thada as a regulator of the balance between energy consumption and energy storage , which was selected during human evolution .

moraru et al. examine the function of thada , a positively selected gene in human evolution associated with type 2 diabetes , in drosophila and show that thada modulates , via calcium signaling , energy storage and thermogenesis balance .
keywords drosophila development metabolism serca calcium thermogenesis obesity type 2 diabetes sarcolipin published : april 10 , 2017 introduction obesity has reached pandemic proportions , with 13 % of adults worldwide being obese ( world health organization , 2015 ) .
although the modern diet triggers this phenotype , 60 % - 70 % of an individual 's susceptibility to obesity is genetic ( aguilera et al. , 2013 , nan et al. , 2012 , naukkarinen et al. , 2012 ) .
the underlying evolutionary drivers that cause susceptibility to vary from person to person are not clear .
since obesity is most prevalent in populations that have adapted to warm climates , an emerging theory proposes that populations in warm climates evolved low metabolic rates to reduce heat production , making them prone to obesity .
in contrast , populations in cold climates evolved high energy consumption for thermogenesis , making them more resistant to obesity ( sellayah et al. , 2014 ) .
this theory predicts the existence of genes that have been selected in the human population by climate adaptation which regulate the balance between heat production and energy storage .
the gene thyroid adenoma associated ( thada ) has played an important role in human evolution .
comparison of the neanderthal genome with the genomes of current humans reveals that snps in thada were the most strongly positively selected snps genome - wide in the evolution of modern humans ( green et al. , 2010 ) .
furthermore , as hominins left africa circa 70,000 years ago , they adapted to colder climates .
genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) identified thada as one of the top genes that was evolutionarily selected in response to cold adaptation ( cardona et al. , 2014 ) , suggesting a link between thada and energy metabolism .
thada was also identified as one of the top risk loci for type 2 diabetes by gwas ( zeggini et al. , 2008 ) .
although follow - up studies could not confirm an association between thada snps and various aspects of insulin release or insulin sensitivity ( grarup et al. , 2008 , sanghera et al. , 2009 , schleinitz et al. , 2010 , staiger et al. , 2008 , stancakova et al. , 2009 ) , some studies did find an association between thada and pancreatic beta - cell response ( simonis - bik et al. , 2010 ) or marginal evidence for an association with body mass index ( gupta et al. , 2013 ) .
in sum , thada has been connected to both metabolism and adaptation to climate .
nonetheless , to our knowledge nothing is known about the function of thada in animal biology , at the physiological or the molecular level .
animals lacking thada function have not yet been described .
an analysis of the amino acid sequence of thada provides little or no hints regarding its molecular function .
to study the function of thada , we generated thada knockout flies .
thada knockout animals are obese and produce less heat than controls , making them sensitive to the cold .
we find that thada binds the sarco / er ca2 + atpase ( serca ) and regulates organismal metabolism via calcium signaling .
in addition to unveiling the physiological role and molecular function of this medically relevant gene , our results also show that one gene that has been strongly selected during human evolution in response to environmental temperature plays a functional role in regulating the balance between heat production and energy storage , affecting the propensity to become obese .
results thada mutant drosophila have metabolic defects a blast search of the drosophila proteome with the protein sequence of human thada ( np _ 071348.3 ) identifies cg15618 as the top hit with an e value of 10 - 73 .
conversely , a blast search of the human proteome using the protein sequence of cg15618 identifies hthada as the top hit , thereby establishing an orthologous relationship between hthada and cg15618 ( figure s1a ) .
hence , we refer to cg15618 as drosophila thada .
to study thada function , we generated thada knockout flies by homologous recombination to generate two different loss - of - function alleles ( figure s1b ) .
allele ko1 deletes a 1,024 - bp genomic region comprising the fourth exon and part of the fifth exon of thada , causing the rest of the thada open reading frame to be out of frame , whereas allele ko2 is circa 1 kb larger and also deletes the transcription start site of thada ( figure s1b ) .
both alleles lead to loss of thada protein ( figure s1c ) and have identical phenotypes , so the following data will refer to the ko1 allele ( henceforth thadako ) unless otherwise specified .
thadako are viable ( 97 % survive embryogenesis ; survival to adulthood is shown in figure s1d ) and have normal patterning ( not shown ) , developmental timing ( figures s1e and s1e ') , adult wing size ( a sensitive proxy for body size , figures s1f and s1f ') , cell size ( figures s1f and s1f ') , and life span ( figures s1g and s1g ') .
since thada has been associated with type 2 diabetes ( zeggini et al. , 2008 ) , we asked whether thada regulates organismal metabolism .
indeed , both thadako1 and thadako2 flies have strongly elevated triglyceride levels ( figures 1a and s2a ) .
thadako are also hyperphagic , measured by quantifying ingestion of colored food ( figures 1b and s2b ) .
the obese and hyperphagic phenotypes are specific for thada loss of function , since they can be rescued by ubiquitous expression of thada from a transgene ( figures s2c and s2d ) .
compared with the increased adiposity of thadako animals , the increased - feeding phenotype is less robust and varies depending on genetic background ( e.g. , thadako , da - gal4 flies do not eat as much as thadako , figure s2d ) .
hence , we focus here on the adiposity .
like mammals , drosophila store energy both as triglycerides and as glycogen .
flies with elevated triglycerides frequently have elevated glycogen .
we quantified total body glycogen and found it to be significantly elevated in thadako females but not males ( figure s2e ) .
another phenotype that correlates with elevated nutrient stores in drosophila is starvation resistance ; when subjected to starvation , flies die in coincidence with depletion of their energy stores ( teleman et al. , 2005 ) .
consistently , thadako animals were resistant to starvation compared with controls ( figure 1c ) .
in contrast , levels of circulating sugars , glucose and trehalose , were not significantly altered in thadako animals ( figures s2f and s2g ) .
to study the thadako obesity in more detail , we first asked whether the excess lipids accumulate ectopically in the body .
oil red o staining of tissues , however , did not reveal noticeably elevated levels of neutral lipids in ectopic locations such as the gut ( figure s3a ) .
instead , the fat body - - the drosophila equivalent of adipose tissue and liver combined - - in thadako animals contains larger lipid droplets and more total lipid per cell compared with controls ( figures 1d - 1d '') , indicating the obesity is mainly due to elevated lipid storage in its normal location , the fat body .
to test which tissues contribute toward the increased adiposity of thadako animals , we performed rescue experiments re - introducing thada expression in specific tissues .
expression of thada in the fat body using two fat body drivers , adh - gal4 and mir278 - gal4 ( see figure s3b for expression patterns ) , partially rescued thadako obesity ( figures 1e and 1f ) , as did expression of thada in all neurons ( figure 1h ) , indicating that defects in both the fat body and the nervous system contribute to the fat phenotype .
neuronal expression of thada , but not fat body expression of thada , also partially rescued the increased food intake ( figures 1g and 1i ) .
in sum , the obese phenotype of thadako is partly due to an autonomous defect in the fat body and partly due to a defect in the nervous system , likely via feeding .
in sum , thadako animals are viable and have normal size and patterning , but have elevated triglyceride stores , due to defects in both the fat body and the nervous system .
this identifies thada as a regulator of organismal metabolism .
thada localizes to the er to understand the molecular function of thada , we first studied its subcellular localization .
we confirmed that our alpha - thada antibody specifically recognizes thada protein in tissue stainings , via control experiments overexpressing or knocking down endogenous thada in wing discs ( figures s4a and s4b ) , as it does on immunoblots ( figure s1c ) .
we then compared the subcellular localization of thada with gfp markers for various organelles , and found that thada localizes to the er. in muscle , thada and the er marker gfp - kdel ( yogev et al. , 2010 ) co - localize perfectly ( figure 2a , top row ) .
in the fat body , gfp - kdel localization is more complex because it marks both er and golgi ( the kdel sequence causes retrograde transport of cargo from the golgi to the er ) .
in the fat body the golgi network has a round appearance , as seen using the golgi - specific marker grasp65 - gfp ( figure 2b ) , which does not co - localize with thada ( figure 2b ) .
in the fat body gfp - kdel marks these round golgi structures that do not co - localize with thada , as well as the more reticulate er network , which stains positive for the er marker serca ( figure 2c ) and co - localizes with thada ( figures 2c and 2a , bottom panel ) .
indeed , serca , which is widely used as an er marker , co - localizes with thada in all tissues tested such as the fat body and salivary gland ( figure 2d ) .
consistent with this , we detected thada in microsomal preparations ( figure 2e ) .
since thada has no obvious signal sequence , this suggests it localizes to the cytosolic side of the er membrane .
in contrast , we detected no co - localization with other organelle markers such as yfp - rab5 ( early endosomes ) or mito - gfp ( mitochondria ) ( figures 2f and 2g ) and only very low levels of thada in purified mitochondria ( figure s4c ) .
in sum , thada mainly localizes to the er , co - localizing with serca .
thada interacts with serca and regulates its activity since the amino acid sequence of thada yields no hints regarding its molecular function , we aimed to identify proteins interacting with thada .
we immunoprecipitated endogenous thada from fly lysates and used mass spectrometry to identify co - precipitating proteins .
an equivalent anti - thada immunoprecipitate from thadako flies served as a negative control .
this identified 228 proteins interacting with thada ( table s1 ). from this list of interacting proteins we focused on serca , because it was the only protein that we could confirm interacts with thada in a consistent manner by co - immunoprecipitation experiments , and because serca co - localizes with thada .
serca is an atp - dependent calcium pump that transports calcium ions from the cytosol into the er , and calcium signaling has recently been described to regulate organismal metabolism ( baumbach et al. , 2014 , bi et al. , 2014 , subramanian et al. , 2013a ) .
thada and serca co - immunoprecipitated from both fly and kc167 cell lysates ( figures 2h - 2j ) .
serca and calcium signaling have recently been found to regulate metabolism in drosophila and mice ( bal et al. , 2012 , baumbach et al. , 2014 , bi et al. , 2014 , subramanian et al. , 2013b , ye et al. , 2011 ) .
drosophila with hypomorphic mutations in the inositol 1,4,5 - trisphosphate receptor ( ip3r ) , which opposes serca function by releasing calcium from the er into the cytosol , have the same phenotypes as the ones we observe in thada mutants : they are obese , starvation resistant , and hyperphagic , due to functions of ip3r in both fat body and the cns ( subramanian et al. , 2013a , subramanian et al. , 2013b ) .
this prompted us to study calcium signaling and serca in thada mutants .
serca affects metabolism via two mechanisms .
firstly , serca uses the energy derived from atp hydrolysis in part to translocate calcium from the cytosol into the er , and in part to produce heat via a futile cycle ( reis et al. , 2001 ) .
the importance of this futile atp hydrolysis for non - shivering thermogenesis is shown by the regulator sarcolipin , which uncouples serca atp hydrolysis from calcium pumping , causing serca to produce more heat per molecule of atp consumed ( bal et al. , 2012 ) .
in the absence of sarcolipin , animals have reduced thermogenesis and are sensitive to the cold ( bal et al. , 2012 ) .
secondly , in addition to an effect on thermogenesis , loss of an serca uncoupling protein leads to more efficient calcium pumping by serca , thereby elevating er calcium levels .
elevated er calcium levels cause obesity and hyperphagia ( baumbach et al. , 2014 , subramanian et al. , 2013a , subramanian et al. , 2013b ) .
we asked whether thada affects serca activity .
an serca activity assay that quantifies ca2 + - dependent atp hydrolysis ( gehrig et al. , 2012 ) revealed that loss of thada leads to significantly elevated calcium - dependent serca activity both in flies ( figure 3a ) and in cells in culture ( figure 3b ) , indicating that it is a cell - autonomous effect .
we next analyzed calcium levels in the cells , whereby we were unable to detect any significant differences in cytosolic calcium levels in thada knockdown cells compared with controls ( figures 3c and 3c ') .
we then quantified er calcium levels using two independent methods that measure calcium release from the er into the cytosol .
cytosolic calcium levels increased more strongly in thada knockdown cells compared with controls , either upon calcium release from the er with ionomycin ( figure 3d ) or upon acutely blocking calcium re - uptake into the er with thapsigargin ( figure 3e ) , indicating thada knockdown cells have elevated er calcium .
together with the serca activity assay , these data indicate improved pumping of calcium into the er in thada mutants , suggesting that thada acts either as an serca inhibitor or serca uncoupler .
loss of either an serca uncoupler or an serca inhibitor leads to elevated calcium pumping ( figure 4a ) .
however , serca uncouplers and serca inhibitors have opposite effects on heat production by serca .
loss of an serca uncoupling protein results in the phenotypes observed in sarcolipin mutant animals , which is reduced heat production and , consequently , cold sensitivity ( figure 4a ) ( bal et al. , 2012 ) .
in contrast , loss of an serca inhibitor would lead to increased serca - dependent thermogenesis ( figure 4a ) .
to distinguish between these two possibilities , we exposed thadako flies to 4degreesc for 3 hr , which causes them to become paralyzed , and then monitored their recovery at room temperature .
interestingly , thadako flies were significantly impaired in their ability to wake up from cold treatment compared with controls ( figures 4b and s5a ) , suggesting that they might have impaired heat production .
indeed , quantification of heat production by microcalorimetry revealed that thadako flies produce mildly but consistently and significantly reduced heat compared with controls ( figure 4c ) .
together , these data indicate thada acts as an serca uncoupling protein , similar to sarcolipin .
thadako obesity is rescued by reducing serca activity since elevated er calcium leads to increased adiposity ( baumbach et al. , 2014 , bi et al. , 2014 , subramanian et al. , 2013a , subramanian et al. , 2013b ) , this could explain the obesity we observe in thada mutants .
to test this , we asked whether we could rescue the obesity of thadako flies by reducing serca expression .
strong , ubiquitous knockdown of serca using the tubulin - gal4 driver is lethal ( not shown ) , whereas a mild ubiquitous serca knockdown using daughterless - gal4 in a wild - type background leads to viable adults with no significant changes in total body triglyceride levels ( dag4 > serca - rnai , figures 4d and s5b ) .
this mild , ubiquitous knockdown of serca completely reversed the obesity of thada mutants ( figure 4d ) , indicating that the obesity is indeed a result of improved er calcium pumping in these animals .
while serca pumps calcium from the cytosol into the er , ip3r performs the reverse , releasing calcium from the er into the cytosol .
consistent with this , the obesity of thada mutants was also partially rescued by overexpression of ip3r ( figure 4e ) .
since thada modulates thermogenesis , and thada mutant flies are cold sensitive , we asked whether thada protein or mrna levels are modulated by exposing flies to different temperatures , but this was not the case ( figures 4f and 4g ) .
thada molecular function is conserved from flies to humans we asked whether the molecular function of thada is conserved between flies and humans .
we first tested whether human thada can replace drosophila thada in the fly .
expression of human thada in thadako flies rescued their obese phenotype ( figure 5a ) , indicating that human thada can compensate for loss of fly thada , and hence the molecular functions of thada are likely conserved .
we then tested whether loss of thada in human cells leads to elevated er calcium , as it does in fly cells .
indeed , using the er calcium release assay , we found that thada knockdown hela cells have elevated er calcium levels compared with controls ( figure 5b ) .
discussion we report here the physiological and molecular function of thada in animals .
we find that thada mutants are obese , sensitive to the cold , and have reduced heat production compared with controls .
we find that thada interacts physically with serca and modulates its activity .
the combination of improved calcium pumping and cold sensitivity of thada mutants indicates that thada acts as an serca uncoupler , similar to sarcolipin .
this interaction between thada and serca appears to be an important part of thada function , since the obesity phenotype of thada mutants can be rescued by mild serca knockdown .
calcium signaling is increasingly coming into the spotlight as an important regulator of organismal metabolism .
in a genome - wide in vivo rnai screen in drosophila to search for genes regulating energy homeostasis , calcium signaling was the most enriched gene ontology category among obesity - regulating genes ( baumbach et al. , 2014 ) .
cytosolic calcium levels can alter organismal adiposity by more than 10 - fold ( from 15 % to 250 % of control levels ) ( baumbach et al. , 2014 ) , indicating that it is an important regulator of organismal metabolism .
in line with these numbers , thadako flies have 250 % the triglyceride levels of control flies .
the phenotypes observed for other regulators of calcium signaling all point in the same general direction that high er calcium leads to hyperphagia and obesity ( bi et al. , 2014 , subramanian et al. , 2013a ) .
likewise , mice heterozygous for a mutation in ip3r are susceptible to developing glucose intolerance on a high - fat diet ( ye et al. , 2011 ) .
the molecular mechanisms by which er calcium regulates organismal metabolism are not yet fully understood , but this important question will surely be the subject of intense research in the near future .
calcium levels are known to regulate activity of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes such as alpha - ketoglutarate dehydrogenase , isocitrate dehydrogenase , and pyruvate dehydrogenase ( kaufman and malhotra , 2014 ) , which could explain part of the effect of calcium on metabolism .
we find that thada mutation leads to obesity due to roles of thada both in the fat body and in neurons .
this has also been observed for ip3r mutants ( subramanian et al. , 2013b ) .
calcium signaling regulates lipid homeostasis directly and cell - autonomously in the fat body , as observed in seipin mutants ( bi et al. , 2014 ) or when stim expression was modulated specifically in fat tissue ( baumbach et al. , 2014 ) .
in addition , it regulates feeding via the cns ( baumbach et al. , 2014 , subramanian et al. , 2013a ) .
interestingly , while thada mutant females have elevated glycogen levels , thada mutant males do not .
we do not know why this is the case : it could be due to the higher energetic demand in females compared with males , leading to stronger metabolic phenotypes in females , or thada might regulate glycogen metabolism differently in the two sexes .
gwas identified thada as one of the top risk loci for type 2 diabetes ( zeggini et al. , 2008 ) .
the data presented here indicate that thada regulates lipid metabolism and feeding , suggesting that the association between thada and diabetes may be causal in nature .
thada mutant flies develop obesity , but have normal circulating sugar levels under our standard laboratory food conditions .
interestingly , mouse mutants for ip3r likewise do not become insulin resistant under a regular diet , but do become insulin resistant on a high - fat diet ( ye et al. , 2011 ) .
combined , these data suggest that the primary effect of altered thada activity and calcium signaling is on lipid metabolism , and that a combination with high - fat feeding may be required to lead to type 2 diabetes over time .
this could potentially explain why follow - up association studies did not find links between thada and insulin sensitivity ( grarup et al. , 2008 , sanghera et al. , 2009 , schleinitz et al. , 2010 , staiger et al. , 2008 , stancakova et al. , 2009 ) but did find links between thada and adiposity ( gupta et al. , 2013 ) .
insects are ectotherms , meaning that their internal physiological sources of heat are not sufficient to control their body temperature .
nonetheless they do produce heat , and the main sources of heat are either of muscular origin due to movement or shivering , or of biochemical origin from futile cycles that consume atp with no net work ( loli and bicudo , 2005 ) .
for instance , bumblebees preheat their flight muscles by simultaneously activating phosphofructokinase and fructose 1,6 - bisphosphatase , which catalyze opposing enzymatic reactions , leading to the futile hydrolysis of atp and release of heat ( loli and bicudo , 2005 ) .
drosophila also have mitochondrial uncoupling proteins , which potentially generate a futile metabolic cycle by dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential ( hanak and jezek , 2001 , loli and bicudo , 2005 ) .
we propose here that uncoupled hydrolysis of atp by serca could constitute one additional example of such a futile cycle that produces heat .
we cannot exclude , however , that thada knockout flies might also have changes in their evaporative heat loss contributing to their reduced thermogenesis .
the thermogenic phenotypes in thada knockout flies are relatively mild , perhaps reflecting the ectothermic nature of flies .
hence it will be of interest to study in the future the metabolic parameters of thada knockout mice .
the combination of cold sensitivity and obesity in thada mutant animals is interesting in terms of the evolutionary origins of the current obesity pandemic .
the prevalence of obesity is highest in populations that have adapted to warmer climates , suggesting that people in warm climates evolved reduced metabolic rates to prevent overheating , and in combination with our modern diet this reduced metabolic rate leads to obesity ( sellayah et al. , 2014 ) .
interestingly , thada is a gene that provides support for this theory .
snps in thada are among the snps genome - wide that have been most strongly selected as humans adapted to climates of different temperatures ( cardona et al. , 2014 ) .
indeed , comparison of the neanderthal genome with the genomes of current humans reveals that snps in thada were the most strongly positively selected snps genome - wide in the evolution of modern humans ( green et al. , 2010 ) .
the data we present here show that thada simultaneously affects sensitivity to cold and obesity .
uncoupled serca atpase activity is a major contributor to non - shivering thermogenesis ( bal et al. , 2012 ) .
similar to animals mutant for another serca uncoupling protein , sarcolipin ( bal et al. , 2012 ) , we find that thada mutants are sensitive to the cold .
this provides a possible explanation for why evolution selected for snps in thada .
in addition , thada , via serca , also regulates lipid homeostasis .
thada thereby provides a genetic and molecular link between climate adaptation and obesity .

method details generation of thada knockout and rescue flies thadako1 and thadako2 flies were generated by cloning 4kb upstream and downstream genomic flanking sequences , using the oligos described in table s2 , into the avrii - asci and nhei - noti sites of the prk1 vector ( huang et al. , 2008 ) , respectively .
knockout flies were generated as described in ( huang et al. , 2008 ) .
for ko1 , this yielded a 1024nt deletion covering the 4th exon and the beginning of the 5th exon , and causing the remainder of the open reading frame to be out - of - frame .
for ko2 , this yielded a 1910nt deletion which includes the knockout region of ko1 , but extends to include the transcription start site and basal promoter of thada .
the genetic background of thadako flies was cleaned by 4 generations of backcrossing to an isogenic w1118 stock , which is used as the control stock in all experiments described here .

introduction data collection using paper - based questionnaires can be time consuming and return errors affect data accuracy , completeness , and information quality in health surveys .
we compared smartphone and paper - based data collection systems in the burden of obstructive lung disease ( bold ) study in rural sudan .
methods this exploratory pilot study was designed to run in parallel with the cross - sectional household survey .
the open data kit was used to programme questionnaires in arabic into smartphones .
we included 100 study participants ( 83 % women ; median age = 41.5 +/ - 16.4 years ) from the bold study from 3 rural villages in east - gezira and kamleen localities of gezira state , sudan .
questionnaire data were collected using smartphone and paper - based technologies simultaneously .
we used kappa statistics and inter - rater class coefficient to test agreement between the two methods .
results symptoms reported included cough ( 24 %) , phlegm ( 15 %) , wheezing ( 17 %) , and shortness of breath ( 18 %) .
one in five were or had been cigarette smokers .
the two data collection methods varied between perfect to slight agreement across the 204 variables evaluated ( kappa varied between 1.00 and 0.02 and inter - rater coefficient between 1.00 and - 0.12 ) .
errors were most commonly seen with paper questionnaires ( 83 % of errors seen ) vs smartphones ( 17 % of errors seen ) administered questionnaires with questions with complex skip - patterns being a major source of errors in paper questionnaires .
automated checks and validations in smartphone - administered questionnaires avoided skip - pattern related errors .
incomplete and inconsistent records were more likely seen on paper questionnaires .
conclusion compared to paper - based data collection , smartphone technology worked well for data collection in the study , which was conducted in a challenging rural environment in sudan .
this approach provided timely , quality data with fewer errors and inconsistencies compared to paper - based data collection .
we recommend this method for future bold studies and other population - based studies in similar settings .
lhl internationalthis study was funded by the norwegian heart and lung patient organisation ( lhl international tuberculosis foundation ) , the atlas alliance and norad , norway .
the funder did not have any role in the study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .
however , they provided salaries for author rm. the particular roles of this author are described in the ' author contributions' section .
we thank the nihr global health research unit on lung health and tb in africa at lstm - " impala " for helping to make this work possible .

introduction traditionally paper - based data collection has been the mainstay of data gathering for the burden of obstructive lung disease ( bold ) study .
bold is an international recognized study that uses standardised methods to measure the burden of chronic obstructive lung disease [ 1 ] .
however automated data collection and processing methods are becoming more widespread in healthcare research [ 2 , 3 ] and they have many advantages [ 4 - 6 ] .
there are studies investigating the use of automated data collection via smartphones as a research tool in developing countries however , it lacks the quantity available in the developed world and there are far less exploring its use in large - scale and complex surveys , such as bold [ 6 ] .
paper - based data collection is convenient for many researchers and data collectors .
it has several potential advantages over the automated method ; data extraction is not limited to a specific place and it is seemingly easier to produce , modify , manipulate , and implement .
in addition , they can provide a long - lasting record of all modifications and an instant evaluation of forms can be completed by different review authors [ 7 , 8 ] .
moreover , data loss using the paper - based method is potentially less likely than with automated data collection [ 7 ] .
studies from developing countries have found , however , that using paper - based methods result in a higher frequency of incomplete records , a greater potential for human errors , and more time is needed to organise the data [ 1 , 7 , 9 , 10 ] .
in addition , it can involve labour - intensive data entry and may limit timely analysis [ 10 ] .
in the last decade , the number of mobile phone users in africa has dramatically increased , with africa now representing 83 % of the total mobile phone subscribers worldwide .
south africa leads the region in mobile phone ownership with 36.4 mobile phones per 100 people .
they are no longer considered a luxury [ 5 , 6 ] .
as information communication technologies grow and software such as the ' android ' systems platform and many open - source applications have been developed , researchers in the health sector have begun using smartphones as a tool in patient data collection , disease surveillance , clinical research , and national surveys [ 2 , 7 ] .
however , paper - based questionnaires continue to be the main data collection tool in many countries , especially in sub - saharan africa [ 7 ] .
using smartphone technology - based tools for data collection has many advantages and can provide a broader range of options .
it is economically and environmentally friendly , and it can provide faster reporting with more accuracy [ 11 ] .
it is also more efficient .
data collection and entry can be combined into one step [ 2 ] , forms can be easily developed to provide built - in checking and reliability rules , and has additional features such as a global positioning system ( gps ) .
in addition , time stamps , alarms , automatic completions , and reminders can help in work - rate monitoring and data validation [ 4 , 8 , 12 ] .
in contrast , data security and connectivity can be a concern , and data collectors need to be familiar and comfortable with using an automated tool [ 4 ] .
accidental loss of data , battery life , loss or theft of the device , security of the device , and network connectivity in rural areas are also major concerns [ 5 , 11 , 13 ] .
in sudan , both the government and civil society frequently use smartphones for data gathering .
there is , however , very little published research regarding this .
therefore , the main aim of this study is to compare accuracy , completeness , and quality of data collected using smartphone - based versus paper - based methodologies for the bold study in gezira state , sudan .
we explored whether data collection might be expedited by conducting this work as a one - step process ' in the field ' ( smartphone - based data collection ) , improving the ability to have timely questionnaire data and be more responsive to the data in real time .
in addition , we aim to provide evidence that will assist decision - making with regards to the method of data collection to use in future bold surveys in rural sudan .
methods study design and setting the parent bold study is a cross - sectional household survey with a multi - stage random sampling plan , conducted in 35 villages in gezira state , sudan .
this exploratory cross - sectional household survey ran within the same setting of the rural bold survey following the same study design and targeted the same population with identical inclusion criteria : all participants were non - institutionalised adults , aged 18 years and older , and living in gezira state .
convenience sampling of 100 accessible participants from 3 random villages was conducted between august and september 2016 .
each of these villages was composed of 30 households , which were similar in all study characteristics including population density , education level , geographic area , sex distribution , ethnic groups , and infrastructure .
the sample size was based on the feasibility of this pilot .
the method of data collection was randomized separate from the main bold survey .
firstly , a total of eight samples were randomized daily ( four to be administered by smartphone and four by paper ) prior to the start of data collection .
the data collector administering the questionnaires for the bold team was then randomized .
two out of four teams from the main bold survey conducted data collection per day .
the main bold survey core questionnaire data collection and the method of collection data then ran simultaneously .
prior to the start of this study , a needs assessment was conducted with the aim of increasing data collection efficiency and to avoid errors that are common in household surveys .
this was decided based on discussion with different experts including a software engineer , an epidemiologist , and a public health expert in health surveys .
this exercise identified essential requirements to develop and implement the electronic data collection forms and system .
a wide range of available software was explored .
an odk was selected based on affordability as an open source application , previous evidence - based use in developing countries , and the ability for offline data entry .
standard operating procedures ( sops ) in line with the ethical approval were developed prior to the start of data collection .
open data kit ( odk ) questionnaire development the odk [ 14 ] was used by the study principle investigator to develop an electronic version of the bold core questionnaire for the samsung s3 mobile phone , which includes six main sections : demographic information , respiratory symptoms and disorders ( cough , sputum , wheezing , and shortness of breath ) , use of medication , cigarette smoking , occupational exposure , economic impact , and activity limitation .
the questionnaire was composed of 26 pages with 44 questions ( with multiple sub - questions and different skip patterns ) .
two - hundred four fields were to be completed for each questionnaire , consisting of 48 keyed - in , open - ended questions and 105 multiple - choice questions .
a unique six - digit study id was manually assigned to the participant ( following bold study protocol ) and all questionnaires were labelled with a serial number ( i.e. 1 - 100 ) .
initially the odk questionnaire was designed using microsoft excel and then using guidance from the odk instructions and xlsform.org , an xlsform was developed .
to avoid errors , validation check boxes , reliability rules , alerts , skip patterns , and fields requiring data were programmed into the odk .
the form had three different sheets , the first of which was a ' survey sheet ' , which included all collectable data in arabic as well as the gps location with start and end times of the survey .
notes to guide data collectors , including hints and data constraints where also added to this sheet .
the second was a ' choices sheet ' , which contained a comprehensive list of all answer options with labels in arabic and english .
the third sheet , of ' settings ' , contained the form title in the mobile interface and the form id. questions were arranged by group and answers were programed based on either being open ended or single / multiple choice questions .
the excel file was then uploaded into http :// opendatakit.org / xiframe / and the full functioning form previewed in " enketo " ( a preview provided by the odk ) .
xml forms were then uploaded into odk aggregate .
to use the forms on the mobile device the odk collect application for android devices was used .
after development , the tool was tested and validated in one village separate from the two villages selected for the study .
the data collection of smartphone - based forms was carried out by the study principal investigator and another trained data collector from bold team .
six data collectors collected the paper - based forms .
odks can work offline .
as internet connectivity was very limited in the study area , data were entered into smartphone during the collection , saved , and later uploaded to the server .
data collection and entry data collection comprised recording participants' information simultaneously on paper and electronic forms .
two data collectors concurrently completed the core questionnaire alternatively in a random order ( i.e. if the questionnaire was conducted using the paper - based method , the smartphone data collector must complete the smartphone - based form , and vice versa ) to ensure no additional burden on participants .
the order of administration of either the paper questionnaire or the smartphone followed the randomisation conducted daily .
study sops were agreed between the two administrators before the start of the data collection .
the paper - based questionnaire data was double entered in a predesigned spss ( ibm corp .
released 2015 .
ibm spss statistics for windows , version 23.0 .
armonk , ny : ibm corp ) data spreadsheet .
it was entered into two different spreadsheets , and crosschecking and cleaning was performed before the analysis stage .
smartphone forms were submitted to the odk aggregate server and then retrieved using briefcase , saved as a cvs file , compiled , and then transformed into spss format .
all data collectors were graduates and had an extensive training of bold questionnaire administration , research methods and ethics by senior researchers , data manager and it specialist .
the mobile data collectors were additionally trained in how to use the odk and how to administer the bold core questionnaire using the samsung s3 mobile phones .
ethical considerations ethical approval from liverpool school of tropical medicine research ethics committee was obtained prior to start this study ( ref. 11.03rs ) .
in addition , for the bold main study , ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee at the imperial college london and the research department at ministry of health in gezira state , sudan .
during the data collection stage , all data were anonymised .
all participants received information sheets regarding the study details and written consent was obtained to participate in this study .
statistical analysis descriptive statistics for the main variables in the questionnaire were performed .
frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were conducted to test data completeness .
a chi squared test was used to test the association between the percentage of forms with errors and form type ( smartphone - based / paper - based ) , for collection order ( first versus second ) , and possible interaction of form type by order .
inter - rater measurement agreement tests were used to check the agreement between continuous variables , while percentage agreement and kappa statistics were used to test the agreement between the categorical variables .
p - values of less than . 05 were used to report the significance of the results .
kappa ranges are described in table 1 [ 15 ] .

generally , the two methodologies agreed on all demographic information on the questionnaire .
in ' higher education level achieved ' , two records were missing in paper - based data and inconsistencies in the values of both methods were seen ; however , the kappa statistics showed strong to substantial agreement .

the major questions relating to cough had a 99 % agreement , with one recorded missing in paper - based forms , and major questions relating to phlegm had 100 % agreement between the two methods .
questions relating to emphysema , asthma , and chronic bronchitis all showed strong to perfect agreement , with two questions missing .
strong to perfect agreement was also seen in smoking section as shown in table 4 .
no significant differences were found on other smoking questions such as smoking shisha , cigars , canapes , and special substances .
all other smoking related questions had a strong level agreement between the smartphone and paper records and substantial agreement was also found in the questions regarding smoking at work ( kappa = 0.77 , p < . 05 ) .

significant low - inter - rater agreement was found on questions related to the number of weekly smoked cigarettes ( interclass coefficient = 0.552 , p < . 05 ) ( table 4 ) .
the mobile variable was calculated automatically in the smartphone - based version and it was calculated manually in the paper - based one .
absolute agreement was demonstrated in most of the questions regarding medication use ( table 5 ) .
the timeframe of taking the medication should have been specified in days and weeks in both methods of data collection .
in paper - based questionnaires , there were no specifications for this timeframe ( days / weeks ) ; however , in the smartphone - based questions , this criterion was covered. of the ten participants taking medications , only two had the timeframe of medication duration specified .
kappa values cannot be calculated for this variable , although there was 11 % agreement between them .

occupation exposure showed strong agreement ( kappa = 0.88 ) and inter - rater class statistic showed an absolute agreement between the two variables for a question related to ' number of years of exposure ' .
similarly , questions surrounding participant comorbidities also had a strong level of agreement between the two versions of the data , apart from questions regarding heart disease , which had fair agreement ( kappa = 0.393 ) .
moderate to substantial agreement was found in questions regarding participant 's knowledge of smoking related disease ( see table 6 ) .

the sections regarding participant views of their health , how they feel , and how well they can do their usual activities showed strong agreement using kappa statistics with values of 0.927 and 0.818 .
the only exception was a singular question regarding physical health and emotional problems .
in this question , substantial agreement was shown ( kappa = 0.795 ) .
in questions addressing phlegm , a slight inconsistency was shown in the skipped pattern between the two methods .
while fair level of agreement ( kappa = 0.23 , p < . 05 ) was seen in skip - pattern questions relating to ' hearing wheeze ' ( table 7 ) .

areas of weakest agreement the main areas of disagreement were in questions with skip patterns .
in the ' shortness of breath ' questions demonstrating disagreement , 15 of the paper - based questionnaires had used the skip pattern incorrectly ( e.g. ' if the answer is no , then the next two questions should be skipped ') .
kappa statistics showed no agreement in the results from the two different methods in this area ( table 7 ) .
where the skip questions properly followed strong agreement was found ( kappa = 0.839 ) .
the skip pattern was also not followed in questions related to ex - smokers .
four of 11 did not follow the skip pattern ; however , these answers were correctly skipped for the same data in the smartphone questionnaires .
substantial agreement was found in these variables ( kappa = 0.770 , p < . 05 ) .
the same problem was encountered in the economic impact section , which showed variation in the level of agreement .
the ' skip pattern ' questions had moderate to substantial agreement , while the remainder had strong agreement ( tables 8 and 9 ) .

errors were defined as questions with no answers or wrong use of the ' skip pattern ' .
in smartphone - based forms , most of the errors found were due to having different answer options ( table 11 ) .
a chi square test demonstrated that paper forms were significantly more likely to have errors ( 82.5 % of the total ) .
in comparison , 10.5 % occurred on smartphone - based questionnaires and 7 % occurred in both formats ( x2 ( 3 , n = 100 ) = 64 , p < . 001 ) .
there was no significant association between having a form with errors and the order of administering the questionnaire using the smartphone or paper - based first ( p = . 686 ) .

in addition , a multiple linear regression was calculated to predict the errors on forms based on who did the data collection and what order was used to administer the questionnaire ; however , no significant association was found ( f ( 2,97 ) = 0.299 , p > . 05 , r2 = 0 ) .
discussion data collection is one of the most important steps in conducting health research and having consistent , complete , and accurate data is vital to this .
we found that the use of a smartphone - based data collection method in rural sudan is feasible and provides timely and quality data with a lower number of errors and inconsistencies compared to data collected using paper - based methods .
these findings are in line with other studies conducted in similar settings [ 3 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 16 ] .
a recent study of routine influenza sentinel surveillance in kenya and southern india both reported similar results , with less errors and inconsistencies in the smartphone collected data [ 2 , 9 ] .
smartphone data collection provided more timely data for analysis in comparison to the paper - based forms .
paper collected data took around 15 days post initial collection to be double entered in spss software and cleaned , where as electronic data were rapidly accessible and retrieval took one day a collection date , start time , and end time of each questionnaire could also be electronically logged when using the smartphone , whereas this information was not routinely available for the paper - based method .
although no cost - specific data were collected or evaluated in our study , we know that the electronic data collection had a low cost as we used two existing smartphones ( samsung galaxy s3 ) .
using an open source application , such as odk , also decreased the electronic cost of this study .
the disagreements in data collection were mainly demonstrated in the questions with complicated skip patterns in mobile - based forms .
however , the use of automated checks and validations in electronic forms prevented the occurrence of these errors , which was also found in a kenyan influenza surveillance study [ 9 ] .
using the wrong skip pattern on such surveys can affect the quality of collected data and may lead to misleading results .
variables without mandatory data entry requirements in mobile - based forms and open - ended questions caused 8 ( 80 %) of the errors from a total of 10 returned errors in the mobile - based forms .
other studies reported similar findings with the limitation of unrestricted questions on mobile data collection [ 9 ] .
the remaining 20 % were due to technical programming problems .
some of the reported disagreements may not have been caused by the data collection method used , but rather because the participant may not have provided clear answers .
during the data collection , it was dependent on the researcher to choose the option he / she understands .
therefore , the disagreement in questions ( views about your health - - how you feel and how well you can do your usual activities ) may not have been caused by the collection method used .
similarly , when assessing the level of higher education , there were differences in the ' unknown ' and ' none ' classifications as this was dependent on the researcher 's personal assessment .
challenges , limitations , and lessons learnt one of the main limitation of this study was having a convenience sampling plan and a sample size of 100 participants .
the sample size was selected based on the number of previous recruited participants within the main survey per month as well as time and budget constraints .
in addition , because of the length of bold questionnaires the interviews could only be performed once per individual .
ideally the questionnaires would be taken using both methodologies simultaneously by the same data collector to allow more comparisons regarding the administration time and efficiency of data collectors .
although the odk tool is an open source application , some obstacles were faced during the development and data extraction stages as well as during the retrieval stage .
first , the accessibility of the aggregate website in sudan was challenging .
during data collection , the odk application would occasionally and unpredictably close and the researcher would need to restart the application .
as the internet connection and network coverage was very limited in the three rural villages , the availability of offline data collection in odk makes it a viable tool in rural settings .
second , using the arabic language in the odk software was challenging during questionnaire development and data retrieval , especially concerning the open - ended questions .
importing the cvs files from odk into excel was an issue as excel was not able to interpret the arabic content of the cvs file correctly .
one skip pattern in the smoking section had a programming error , which in turn created errors in two of the mobile forms as the options were incorrectly skipped .
the main challenge to both the paper and electronic forms was the length of the bold core questionnaire and the frequent skip patterns .
the duration affects the programming time , collection , data entry and analysis in the electronic version as well as being a challenge for the data collectors .
they were experts in using the paper based core questionnaire and sometimes faster than the smartphone - based data collectors when explaining the questions to participants .
in future studies , further data collector experience may accelerate smartphone - based data collection [ 2 ] .
choosing a single part of the questionnaire for smartphone data collection would increase the speed of obtaining data and would demonstrate the effectiveness of electronic data collection as clearly .
however , this method would still remain applicable for longer health surveys , which has been supported by past research [ 5 , 16 ] .
the electronic format in theory allows for the gps coordinates to be easily obtained during the interview process and therefore accurate mapping of the study participant 's location , even in rural areas .
however , in practice the gps was variable , especially in the first village and there was a delay in obtaining data .
if this is fully functional , it does represent a potential advantage over traditional paper - based data collection ( fig 1 ) .

the overall economic cost regarding the use of mobile data collection method , including the software development , mobile / electronic devices , network connection , and internet accessibility , needs further investigation .
the use of local servers rather than using cloud servers provided by the odk platform also needs evaluating .
lastly , for large questionnaires with many nested questions and multiple skip patterns such as bold core questionnaire , having either mobile version questionnaire with strict validation checks or minimising the skip patterns in paper based forms may improve the data collection process and improve the data quality .
conclusions this study demonstrates that electronic data collection via smartphones for the bold study is an effective and efficient method in the challenging environment of rural sudan .
it provides timely and accurate data that is comparable with the traditional paper - based formats , with a lower level of user error .
when disagreements between the two formats did occur , this was mainly due to the inappropriate completion of the bold skip - format questions in paper - based questionnaires .
while the smartphone based technique is not without challenges , this study adds to the growing body of evidence for electronic data collection as a feasible method of obtaining data for health surveys in similar rural environments .

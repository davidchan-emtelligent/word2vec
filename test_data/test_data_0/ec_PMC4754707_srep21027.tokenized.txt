a new magnetic solid chelator powder , fs @ ida ( core - shell fe3o4 @ sio2 nanoparticles coated with iminodiacetic acid chelators ) , was used as a reactive magnetic carrier to selectively capture non - magnetic heavy metals in soil by chelation and removal by magnetic separation .
fs @ ida was prepared via inorganic - organic and organic synthesis reactions that generated chelating groups on the surface of magnetic , multi - core , core - shell fe3o4 @ sio2 ( fs ) nanoparticles .
these reactions used a silane coupling agent and sodium chloroacetate .
the results show that fs @ ida could chelate the heavy metal component of cd , zn , pb , cu and ni carbonates , lead sulfate and lead chloride in water - insoluble salt systems .
the resulting fs @ ida - cd and fs @ ida - pb chelates could be magnetically separated , resulting in removal rates of approximately 84.9 % and 72.2 % for cd and pb , respectively .
fs @ ida could not remove the residual heavy metals and those bound to organic matter in the soil .
fs @ ida did not significantly alter the chemical composition of the soil , and it allowed for fast chelating capture , simple magnetic separation and facilitated heavy metal elution .
fs @ ida could also be easily prepared and reprocessed .
according to an official report recently released by the china ministry of environmental protection1 , 19.4 % of the arable land in china is contaminated with heavy metals , such as cadmium , mercury , and arsenic , and organic pollutants , such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , resulting in environmental problems and food safety concerns .
for example , in the " poison rice incident " of may 2013 , the food and drug administration of guangzhou , china , found that 44.4 % of rice and related products consumed in guangzhou were contaminated with cadmium2 .
the restoration of soil over large areas is urgently needed .
several strategies to remove heavy metals , such as chemical leaching3 , electrokinetic remediation4 , and phytoremediation56 , have been proposed78910 and are being used on a trial basis in china .
the use of magnetic nanoparticles ( mnps ) as adsorbent materials to address environmental problems has received increasing attention due to their unique metal - ion adsorption properties and facile separation from aqueous solutions using a magnet11121314 .
fe3o4 mnps with adsorptive functional groups on their surfaces are well suited to selectively extract heavy metal ions from wastewater or industrial effluents151617 by capturing the metal ions in solution .
the loaded nanoparticles can then be retrieved with a magnet , and the metal ions can be subsequently stripped from the mnps .
this process is sustainable because the mnps are reusable and no hazardous chemicals are employed .
recently , unique core - shell mnps , specifically fe3o4 @ sio2 ( fs ) , that have surface chelating groups were prepared via organic - inorganic and surface functionalization reactions18 .
fs particles coated with n - [( 3 - trimethoxysilyl ) propyl ] ethylenediamine triacetic acid were prepared and used to extract and separate rare - earth ions18 .
these materials have also been functionalized with amino , imino and sulfonic groups and used to selectively remove pb ( ii ) and cr ( vi ) from aqueous solutions19 .
porphyrin - functionalized fs particles were employed to detect , adsorb and remove aqueous hg2 + ions17 .
comparing surface - functionalized fs particles to mnps shows that they not only have improved resistance to acidic environments during magnetic retrieval , but they also selectively adsorb some heavy metal ions , which can be easily desorbed later .
to date , however , virtually all literature reports of heavy metal - ion separation by mnps and fs particles with chelating surface groups focus on aqueous solution systems .
in contrast , the capture of other chemical forms of heavy metals in solid - liquid systems and multi - phase soil systems has not been widely investigated .
in this study , we report the preparation of a novel reactive magnetic carrier made by coating the inorganic surfaces of a magnetic powder ( fs ) with iminodiacetic acid chelators ( fs @ ida ) via organic synthesis reactions .
the resulting fs @ ida material quickly captured the heavy metals of insoluble cd , zn , pb , cu and ni carbonates , lead sulfate and lead chloride via chelation , which made the suspending liquids of the water - insoluble salt systems limpid .
furthermore , cd and pb in contaminated topsoil near a lead and zinc refinery in zhuzhou , hunan province , china , formed magnetic solid chelate complexes with this novel material and were subsequently removed from the soil using a magnet .
results and discussion preparation and characterization of the fs @ ida powder the preparation of fs @ ida is shown schematically in fig. 1. the surface amination product fs @ - n2021 was prepared via the inorganic - organic reaction of fs particles21 with gamma - aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( aptes ) .
then , fs @ ida was prepared by the nucleophilic substitution reaction of fs @ - n with sodium chloroacetate .
transmission electron microscope ( tem ) images showed that the mnps aggregates ( dark gray ) were coated with sio2 membranes ( light gray ) , indicating that the fs @ ida material had a multi - core , core - shell structure with a particle diameter of 0.3 - 3.0 mum ( fig. 2a ) .
in the xrd pattern of fs @ ida , a broad peak was observed near 2theta = 23degrees , indicating the presence of non - crystalline sio2 ( fig. 2b ) .
the ftir spectra of fs , fs @ - n and fs @ ida ( fig. 2c ) exhibited si - o - si vibration peaks at approximately 1100 and 470 cm - 1 and a characteristic fe3o4 adsorption peak at approximately 588 cm - 1 .
the wide peak in the fs spectrum at about 3448 cm - 1 was assigned to the vibration peak of hydrogen - bonded surface silanol groups .
the intensity of this peak was weaker in the fs @ ida spectrum , suggesting that some of the silicon hydroxyl groups participated in the organic - inorganic reaction .
the methylene vibrations of fs @ - n and fs @ ida were observed at approximately 2930 and 2850 cm - 1 , respectively , and fs @ ida also exhibited a strong carboxyl adsorption peak at approximately 1430 cm - 1 .
the results indicate that iminodiacetate groups were grafted on the fs surface .
the amido group concentration of fs @ - n was measured to be in the range of 0.035 - 0.067 % ( corresponding to 0.025 - 0.047 mmol.g - 1 ) by the kjeldahl nitrogen method and the ph of the solution was in the range 3 to 6 .
it was therefore assumed that the chelating group loading occurred in this amido group concentration range .
the sorption and acid desorption experiments using fs @ ida samples were repeated three times , and the nitrogen concentration of the initial sample and the acid desorption for the first , second and third times was measured continuously .
they measured nitrogen concentration were 656 , 646 , 614 and 642 mug.g - 1 ( corresponding to 0.047 , 0.046 , 0.044 and 0.046 mmol ) , respectively .
there was no decrease in the nitrogen concentration , which meant that the reduction of the effective group was relatively small , and the fs @ ida could be reused .
magnetic properties of fs @ ida the magnetic properties of fs @ ida ( 0.0455 g ) were analyzed ( fig. 3 ) .
according to the hysteresis loop , the coercivity of fs @ ida was approximately 90 oe , obviously indicating soft magnetic material .
the saturation magnetization of fs @ ida was lower than that of fe3o4 , and declined by 7.6 % in a small range due to the introduction of nonmetallic elements ( c , n , o and si ) , as well as the antimagnetic and covering effect of the nonmetallic elements .
this effect also showed that the surface of fe3o4 was coated completely .
the slight decrease of saturation magnetization might be due to the effect of a thinner surface - coated modification layer .
the experiment measured the magnetic properties of fresh soil and soil treated with fs @ ida after magnetic separation .
the recovery rate of fs @ ida was expressed as the ratio of dried fs @ ida ( 2.96 g ) after magnetic separation to the amount added to the initial sample ( 3 g ) .
the results show that 98.7 % of the fs @ ida can be recycled .
errors were likely to have occurred during sample weighing and cleaning , so it is likely that this new material will be recyclable .
moreover , the main constituent of the material was iron , silicon and a novel reactive magnetic carrier created by coating the inorganic surfaces of a magnetic powder ( fs ) with iminodiacetic acid chelators ( fs @ ida ) via organic synthesis reactions , so there is no potential environmental risk .
effect of the ph on the amount of cd2 + adsorbed on fs @ ida the number of solvated divalent metal ions adsorbed on fs @ ida was affected by the ph , adsorption time , fs @ ida quality , initial cadmium concentration and presence of other ions .
initially , 1 g of fs @ ida was added to 100 ml of 0.89 mm and 2.67 mm cadmium solutions , which were then maintained at room temperature for 12 h. the effects of the ph , the initial cd2 + concentration and the presence of other ions on the amount of cd2 + adsorbed were determined , and the results are shown in fig. 4. as shown in fig. 4a,b , the amount of cd2 + adsorbed increased with increasing ph and reached a maximum when ph was between 6 and 7 .
above ph 7 , the amount adsorbed decreased .
the h + concentration decreased with increasing ph , resulting in a decrease in the reactions between the carboxylate radicals , nitrogen atoms and h + ions and increased chelation of cd2 + .
however , the cadmium ion easily formed a hydrate under alkaline conditions , hindering its adsorption .
when the initial cd2 + concentrations were 0.89 mm and 2.67 mm , the maximum adsorption capacities of fs @ ida were about 6.40 mg.g - 1 and 22.5 mg.g - 1 , respectively .
the adsorption behavior included both chemical and physical adsorption , and the maximal amount of cd2 + adsorption was related to the initial cd2 + concentration .
generally , the higher the initial concentration , the greater the adsorption quantity .
so the adsorption of cd2 + was higher than the nitrogen load .
where as , the nitrogen concentration of the sample was measured by a semi - micro kjeldahl determination , and the results from this method were usually low , resulting in the adsorption capacity of the actual dynamic adsorption curve being larger than the nitrogen load , which denoted the quantity of the chelation group of the fa @ ida material .
furthermore , ca2 + , mg2 + , zn2 + and hg2 + adsorption might compete with cd2 + adsorption .
the effects of ca2 + and mg2 + on the amount of cd2 + adsorbed were the same and slightly greater than those of zn2 + and hg2 + .
in addition , when a solution containing equal amounts of cd2 + and pb2 + was used , the amount of cd2 + adsorbed decreased by approximately 50 % , showing that the presence of pb2 + had a larger impact on cadmium adsorption than the other ions .
these results indicate that fs @ ida can be used to selectively capture and separate solvated cd2 + and pb2 + ions .
chelating capture of several sparingly soluble heavy metals several insoluble carbonate powders ( m = cd , zn , pb , cu , ni ) , lead sulfate and lead chloride were added to 100 ml of aqueous solutions at ph 7 .
the heavy metal - ion concentrations in the solutions were 100 mg.l - 1 ( cd : 0.89 mm , zn : 1.53 mm , pb : 0.49 mm , cu : 1.57 mm , ni : 1.69 mm ) .
fs @ ida ( 3.5 g , the chelating group concentration was greater than 1.75 mmol.g - 1 ) was added to the solution , which was intermittently stirred for 12 h at room temperature .
the magnetic solid was separated using a magnet ; the insoluble carbonate , sulfate and chloride powders were removed ; and the suspension became clear ( supplementary experiment s1 ) .
in this study , the solubility of cadmium carbonate and the ion concentration were both low in the solution , so the effect of ionic strength on the solubility product could be ignored .
in addition , the fs @ ida material was mainly used for soil heavy metal removal , and the conversion of heavy metal adsorption and precipitation would not result in a the ph change in the strong soil buffer system .
therefore , the aqueous solutions were adjusted to ph 7 .
the solubility and concentration product constants correspond to the equilibrium conditions and to the actual experimental conditions , respectively .
the results of the precipitate dissolution and heavy metal capture experiments are shown in table 1 .
when an appropriate amount of fs @ ida was used , the cd , zn , pb , cu and ni ions in the insoluble carbonate and the pbso4 and pbcl2 compounds suspended in solution formed magnetic solid chelates with fs @ ida - m , allowing magnetic removal ( fig. 1 ) , but the ions of the corresponding phosphate compounds did not form chelates with fs @ ida .
based on solubility equilibrium theory , when the ion concentration product constant ksp ' is less than the solubility product constant ksp of the insoluble salt , the insoluble salt dissolves .
the dissociation constants of h2co3 in water are ka1 = 4.2 x 10 - 7 and ka2 = 5.6 x 10 - 11 .
the acid effect coefficient of co32 - is in this study , lead carbonate was used as an example to demonstrate precipitate dissolution .
s = 1.28 x 10 - 5 .
the [ pb2 +]' concentration of the solution was 1.01 x 10 - 6 m 12 h after the fs @ ida powder was added .
because pbco3 was dissolved in the solution , leading to the formation of fs @ ida - pb. the dissociation constants of h3po4 in water are ka1 = 7.6 x 10 - 3 , ka2 = 6.3 x 10 - 8 and ka3 = 4.4 x 10 - 13 .
the acid effect coefficient of po43 + is in this study , zn3 ( po4 ) 2 was used as an example to demonstrate why precipitate dissolution did not occur. with ksp = 9.1 x 10 - 33 , = 1.02 x 10 - 25 , and > ksp , the precipitate did not dissolve .
lead sulfate and lead chloride were not hydrolyzed , and for these compounds , < ksp ; therefore , these precipitates dissolved .
these results show that fs @ ida could promote the dissolution of some insoluble metal salts by capturing the metal ions with their chelating surface groups ( fig. 1 ) , allowing for the targeted magnetic separation of multi - phase non - magnetic metal .
energy spectrum characterization of fs @ ida - cd in this study , the fs @ ida - cd powder sample was obtained by magnetic separation .
after drying the sample at 105 degreesc , its surface elements were analyzed with sem - eds22 .
the red dots ( fig. 5d ) and green dots ( fig. 5e ) in the full energy spectrum represent carbon and nitrogen atoms , respectively , which were introduced during the grafting reaction .
the purple dots represent cadmium ions chelated by fs @ ida ( fig. 5f ) .
based on the energy spectrum , the nitrogen and cadmium loadings were found to be 3.57 and 1.07 wt % , respectively ( fig. 5c ) .
chelation and magnetic separation of cd and pb in soil heavy metals are found in different chemical forms in soils , and those forms have different activities in reactions such as dissolution , precipitation , coagulation and complex formation .
tessier et al.22 classified sediments and heavy metals in soils into different fractions ; water - soluble , interchangeable , carbonate - bound , iron - manganese oxide - bound , organic - bound and residual fraction .
the chemical stability of the different heavy metal fractions is as follows : residual > organic - bound > iron - manganese oxide - bound > carbonate - bound > interchangeable > water - soluble .
the topsoil near a lead and zinc refinery in zhuzhou , hunan province , was chosen because it is representative of soils that are significantly contaminated by heavy metals .
this factory specializes in heavy metals such as pb , zn , and cu and their alloys and combines non - ferrous heavy metals such as au , ag , cd , in , ge , ga , se and te , with chemical industry products such as vitriol .
the cadmium and lead concentration was determined to be 10.91 +/ - 2.06 mg.kg - 1 and 190.0 +/ - 33.2 mg.kg - 1 ( table 2 ) , respectively , using the gb / t17138 - 1997 standard method23 .
the heavy metal forms were analyzed using the tessier method22 .
to measure the amount of cadmium and lead removed from the soil , a slurry of 50 g of soil and 150 g of distilled water was prepared .
the ph was adjusted between 6 and 7 , and 5 g of fs @ ida was added to the slurry at room temperature .
the magnetic solids were separated using a magnet after intermittent stirring for 7 d. the cadmium and lead concentration in the soil was reduced to 1.639 and 52.7 mg.kg - 1 ( table 2 ) , corresponding to removal percentages of 84.9 and 72.3 % , respectively .
these results suggest that the water - soluble , interchangeable , carbonate - bound and iron - manganese oxide - bound fractions of cd and pb ( but not the organic - bound or residual fractions in the multi - phase soil system ) could form the magnetic solid chelates fs @ ida - cd and fs @ ida - pb , which were subsequently separated using a magnet ( fig. 1 and supplementary experiment s2 ) .
this novel magnetic solid chelator as prepared in this study has potential for use in magnetic separation applications and in the removal of heavy metal contaminants from soil .
fs @ ida - cd ( 1 g ) was immersed in 1.0 m hydrochloric acid ( 100 ml ) for 1 h , resulting in the desorption of more than 85 % of the cadmium ions .
the cd2 + removal rate by fs @ ida was still greater than 55 % after three adsorption - desorption cycles , indicating that this material can be recycled .
related studies have reported that mnps with high efficiencies can be used to remove heavy metals , such as cd , pb , cu , hg242526 , in aqueous solution .
in this study , it was not emphasized that fs @ ida was a nanometer material .
in fact , it was a multi - core , core - shell structure and the average particle size was not of nanomaterial particle size .
moreover , the nanoscale magnetic adsorption material is too small , while in the soil - liquid system and heterogeneous soil system , because of the fixation effect of soil clay , it is difficult for it to be completely separated , so the fs @ ida size was controlled in the range of a few microns to dozens of micrometers .
the fs @ ida material was applied in a solid - liquid soil system and a heterogeneous soil system .
the condition of the soil system was more complicated than in an aqueous solution .
it was demonstrated that the fs @ ida had the potential to chelate sedimentary heavy metals ( m ) such as carbonates , sulfates , phosphates , and iron - manganese oxide - bound fractions , into soluble magnetic solids that were easy to separate magnetically .
chelation mechanism the reaction between cadmium ions and fs @ ida illustrates the chelation mechanism .
both the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the iminodiacetic acid chelating group have electron pairs that can coordinate with metal ions , resulting in a tridentate chelator structure .
the fs @ ida surface has many alkyl iminodiacetic acid chelating groups that can coordinate with metal ions via the nitrogen and oxygen atoms to form stable four - coordinate , three - coordinate , and double five - membered ring chelates27 .
in addition , the cadmium ion has an 18 - electron shell structure with an unoccupied orbital , a relatively small ionic radius and a relatively strong electronegativity and can therefore readily form six - coordinate or four - coordinate complexes28 .
possible chelation reaction equations and the resulting fs @ ida - cd structure showing the coordination of the fs @ ida chelating groups to the cadmium ion are shown in fig. 1. the magnetic solid chelate fs @ ida - cd had cadmium ions coordinated with four atoms , the nitrogen and two oxygen atoms of a chelating group and solution species .
h2o , oh - or halogen ion in a double five - membered ring configuration .
therefore , it was assumed that the cadmium ions were captured via a chelating adsorption reaction on the fs @ ida surface or at the solid - liquid interface .
the effect of the adsorption time on the amount of cd2 + adsorbed on fs @ ida at different temperatures was measured .
fs @ ida ( 1 g ) was added to a 100 mg.l - 1 cd2 + solution ( 100 ml ) and the ph was adjusted to 7 .
the temperature was set to 293 , 303 , or 313 k. the cadmium adsorption increased rapidly within the first 0.5 h , reaching over 75 % of the maximum adsorption , indicating that these ions can be quickly captured by fs @ ida ( fig. 6a ) .
the formation of chemical bonds during the adsorption process was the key factor affecting the secondary dynamic adsorption and it was further assumed that cadmium was mainly adsorbed on fs @ ida via chelation ( fig. 6b ) .
conclusions to achieve highly selective , efficient heavy metal removal from contaminated soil , a novel inorganic - organic hybrid material , magnetic solid chelator powder fs @ ida , was prepared .
the inorganic fs particles displayed soft magnetism , and the organic alkyl iminodiacetic acid groups on the particle surface can capture heavy metals via chelation .
specifically , fs @ ida can coordinate with the heavy metals ( m ) of cd , zn , pb , cu and ni carbonates , lead sulfate and lead chloride , which were insoluble in the aqueous systems tested , to form fs @ ida - m for magnetic separation .
only the organic - bound and the residual metal species in the soil cannot be chelated by fs @ ida .
moreover , fs @ ida - m could be easily reprocessed and recycled via acid treatment .
this material has the potential to be used to selectively remove non - magnetic heavy metals from multi - phase soil systems under natural conditions via magnetic separation and could potentially be used to purify and manage large areas of farmland contaminated with heavy metals .

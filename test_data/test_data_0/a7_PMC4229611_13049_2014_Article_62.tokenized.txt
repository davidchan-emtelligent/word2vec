background optimal care of multiple trauma patients has to be at a high level around the clock .
trauma care algorithms and guidelines are available , yet it remains unclear if the time of admission to the trauma room affects the quality of care and outcomes .
hence the present study intends to compare the quality of trauma room care of multiple severely injured patients at a level - 1 trauma center depending on the time of admission .
methods a total of 394 multiple trauma patients with an iss >= 16 were included into this study ( observation period : 52 months ) .
patients were grouped by the time and date of their admission to the trauma room [ business hours ( bh ) : weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. vs. non - business hours ( nbh ) : outside bh ] .
the study analysed differences in patient demographics , trauma room treatment and outcome .
results the study sample was comparable in all basic characteristics [ mean iss : 32.3 +/ - 14.3 ( bh ) vs. 32.6 +/ - 14.4 ( nbh ) , p = 0.853 ; mean age : 40.8 +/ - 21.0 ( bh ) vs. 37.7 +/ - 20.2 years ( nbh ) , p = 0.278 ] .
similar values were found for the time needed for single interventions , like arterial access [ 4.8 +/ - 3.9 min ( bh ) vs. 4.9 +/ - 3.4 min ( nbh ) , p = 0.496 ] and quality - assessment parameters , like time until ct [ 28.5 +/ - 18.7 min ( bh ) , vs. 27.3 +/ - 9.5 ) min ( nbh ) , p = 0.637 ] .
there was no difference for the 24 h mortality and overall hospital mortality in bh and nbh , with 13.5 % vs. 9.1 % ( p = 0.206 ) and , 21.9 % vs. 15.4 % ( p = 0.144 ) , respectively .
the glasgow outcome scale ( gos ) comparison revealed no difference [ 3.7 +/ - 1.6 ( bh ) vs. 3.9 +/ - 1.5 ( nbh ) , p = 0.305 ] .
in general , the observed demographic , injury severity , care quality and outcome parameters revealed no significant difference between the two time periods bh and nbh .
conclusions the study hospital provides multiple trauma patient care at comparable quality irrespective of time of admission to the trauma room .
these results might be attributable to the standardization of the treatment process using established principles , algorithms and guidelines as well as to the resources available in a level - 1 trauma center .
keywords multiple trauma patient office / business hours out of hours process quality management severely injured patient issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background trauma is one of the most frequent causes of death and disability around the world [ 1 ] .
according to the global burden of disease study 10 % of all deaths result from injury [ 2 ] .
therefore , many trauma education initiatives have been implemented aiming at reducing mortality .
especially when the multiple severely injured is concerned , trauma care quality has to be maintained efficiently on a constant high level around the clock [ 3 ] .
the " golden hour of shock " - that was postulated already in 1976 - emphasizes the significance of time and time loss [ 4 ] .
consequently a set of quality management related structures and processes were developed and in the past four decades : trauma care algorithms and training studies consistently report that a trauma room algorithm has a positive effect on patient care [ 5 - 7 ] .
concepts like advanced trauma life support ( atls ) or european trauma course ( etc ) aim at ensuring efficient trauma room care workflows and preventing secondary injury [ 8 ] .
the regular trauma room treatment of the study hospital is based on the atls - algorithm and is divided into three parts : resuscitation phase with first and second survey whole - body computed tomography ( ct ) finalization of diagnostics and determination of further treatment trauma registries for quality management and research trauma registries have been established as a tool for quality assessment over the last decades .
in germany , the traumaregister dgu ( r ) ( tr - dgu ) of the german trauma society ( dgu ) has been invented more than 20 years ago in order to collect and process data on the prehospital and clinical course .
each of the 600 + participating hospitals receive an annual report [ 3 ] .
comparable trauma registers are available , i.e. the trauma audit & research network ( tarn ) in the uk [ 9 ] .
establishment of designated trauma centers usually hospitals are categorized as either level - 1 , - 2 or - 3 trauma center .
there is evidence from previous studies that a trauma system with designated trauma centers improves the survival rate and reduces the mortality rate by up to 15 % [ 10 - 12 ] .
the requirements for a level - 1 trauma center are : [ 13 ] 24 / 7 emergency department and trauma room service 24 / 7 intensive care service including 24 / 7 admission of referred patients 24 / 7 emergency surgery service immediate 24 / 7 availability of all specialists needed for interdisciplinary trauma care nevertheless , patient care including trauma care is usually forced into a system of business ( bh ) and non - business hours ( nbh ) .
it is common sense that the overall resources available for trauma care ( i.e. manpower ) are substantially higher during bh compared to nbh , when many trauma team members are on duty .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of multiple severely injured trauma care in bh and nbh .
differences in patient demographics , quality indicators in trauma room treatment ( e.g. time to ct ) , and outcome parameters were assessed .
to the authors' knowledge , this is the first study that evaluates the quality of trauma care at various hours , which includes a set of time periods to complete a certain intervention from a large study sample .
methods study sample the inclusion criteria are listed below : admission to trauma room during the study period ( september 2007 - december 2011 ) presence of a trained research follower for case documentation injury severity score ( iss ) >= 16 a total of 757 patients were admitted to our trauma room during the study period , of which 499 presented with an iss >= 16 .
a research fellow was not present in 105 of these 499 cases in the trauma room the entire time for various reasons ; therefore these data sets were not used in this study .
the remaining 394 cases are henceforth referred to as " study sample " .
the study sample was divided into the bh sample ( weekdays [ 8:00 am ; 4:00 pm ]) and the nbh sample ( weekdays ] 4:00 pm ; 8:00 am [ or weekends or public holidays ) .
the catchment area of the study hospital ( university hospital and level - 1 trauma center ) covers approximately 20.000 km ( 2 ) with a population of two million residents .
ground based and helicopter air rescue services are available on a 24 / 7 basis .
the helicopter is used for air rescue and intensive care patient transport .
during the night , air rescue can only be called by the emergency physician on scene [ 14 ] .
trauma team and care algorithm the trauma room team comprises one trauma surgery consultant and one resident , one radiologist with one radiographer , one anesthesiologist with one nurse and two emergency nurses .
other disciplines ( i.e. neurosurgery ) can be consulted at any time .
during nbh , these consultants are on call .
the intra - hospital workflow begins with the announcement of the trauma patient by the rescue coordination center .
such announcements trigger a set of pre - determined workflows , including the immediate call of consultants required for the case .
upon arrival of the patient , the history and clinical course are presented by the emergency physician .
thereafter , the primary survey begins .
the aim of this primary survey is to rapidly resuscitate and examine the patient according to the abcde - concept [ 15 ] .
the secondary survey starts after the stabilization of all vital functions and aims at identifying all anatomic injuries [ 16 ] .
if stable , the patient is then transferred to the adjacent ct room and a whole - body ct is performed .
upon completion , the patient is transported back to the trauma room for a second trauma room phase .
data acquisition the whole trauma room phase was documented by a trained research fellow , who was also in charge of capturing the pre - hospital data from the respective patient records .
a total of 450 items were recorded in each patient , of which 130 were the standard data set of the trauma registry of the german trauma society ( traumaregister dgu ( r )) .
the fundamental part was the 130 items of the tr - dgu .
the data inputted into the tr - dgu contained information about patient demographics and defined treatment time points : pre - hospital , trauma room , icu and discharge .
furthermore , the tr - dgu documents the diagnosis and grade of injury according to the abbreviated injury scale ( ais ) [ 17 ] , injury severity score ( iss ) [ 18 ] , new injury severity score ( niss ) [ 19 ] , trauma and injury severity score ( triss ) [ 20 ] and the revised injury severity classification score ( risc - score ) [ 21 ] .
moreover , the asa physical status classification system is recorded for each patient [ 22 ] .
furthermore , the time points for interventions and operations , and outcome according to the glasgow outcome scale ( gos ) [ 23 ]) were gathered [ 24 ] .
the additional 320 items precisely recorded the time to and the duration of a broad spectrum of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions ( e.g. chest tube , intubation , intravenous lines or splinting of the extremities ) until admission to the icu , transport to the operating room , or death .
in addition , all emergency physicians were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire on the perceived quality of the trauma room team on charge and available equipment .
statistics statistical analysis was performed with ibm spss 21.0.0 for windows .
normality was tested with the kolmogorov - smirnov test .
the chi - square test was used to analyze dichotomous variables , the unpaired t - test and mann - whitney u test were used to analyze continuous variables .
data are presented as mean +/ - standard deviation .
p - values < 0.05 were considered statistical significant in all tests .
an outcome analysis was performed by calculating the standardized mortality ratio ( smr ) of the bh and nbh patients for their triss - and risc - prognosis .
ethical considerations the study was approved by the institutional review board of the university of regensburg ( number 14 - 101 - 0004 ) .
results demography the study sample consists of 394 patients .
96 ( 24 %) of these were admitted to the hospital during bh and 298 ( 76 %) patients were admitted during nbh .
significantly more males than females ( 72 % versus 28 %) were included .
the mean age was 38.5 + 20.4 years ( table 1 ) .

comparably , there was also no significant difference for the niss , triss , risc or asa classification , p >= 0.251 ( table 1 ) .
similarly , there was no difference between bh and nbh for the patients who received a whole - body ct or were treated with a mass - transfusion (> 10 erythrocyte concentrate ( ec )) ( table 1 ) .
regarding the type of transport , helicopter transport was significantly more frequent in the bh sample compared to the nbh sample [ bh : n = 65 ( 68 % of all 96 bh patients ) , nbh : n = 167 ( 56 % of all 298 nbh patients ) , p = 0.025 ] .

outcome analysis the early mortality rate [ death within 24 hours : bh : n = 13 ( 13.5 %) , nbh : n = 27 ( 9.1 %) , p = 0.206 ] , as well as the in - hospital mortality rate [ bh : n = 21 ( 21.9 %) , nbh : n = 46 ( 15.4 %) , p = 0.144 ] showed trends towards higher mortality rates in the bh - sample .
however , these were not statistical significant .
the difference between the calculated risc - prognosis and the observed mortality was 6.4 % and 7.2 % in the bh and nbh samples , respectively ( figure 2 ) .
the triss - smr - rate was 0.76 ( 95 % ci 0.48 - 1.05 ) during bh and 0.56 ( 95 % ci 0.41 - 0.71 ) during nbh ( see table 5 ) .
on average , patients were intubated for 7.2 +/ - 10.2 and 7.4 +/ - 10.0 days ( p = 0.856 ) when admitted in bh and nbh , respectively .
the mean length of icu stay was 11.5 +/ - 14.9 and 12.0 +/ - 11.9 days ( p = 0.183 ) , and the mean length of hospital stay was 21.8 +/ - 21.0 and 22.2 +/ - 16.6 days in bh and nbh ( p = 0.268 ) .
the mean gos in both groups was comparable with 3.7 +/ - 1.6 and 3.9 +/ - 1.5 in bh and nbh ( p = 0.305 ) .
the prevalence of mof ( multi organ failure ) and sepsis was similar in both groups ( table 6 ) .

a sensitivity analysis with different start time ( 7:00 ; 7:30 ; 8:30 ; 9:00 a.m. ) or end time ( 3:00 ; 3:30 ; 4:30 ; 5:00 p.m. ) revealed no major differences in injury severity , treatment or outcome to the chosen interval .
discussion the present study compares the quality of multiple trauma patient care and outcome between bh and nbh .
we demonstrated that the time of admission had no measurable impact on a broad spectrum of monitored variables that served as process and quality indicators for trauma care and outcome at the study hospital which is a level - 1 trauma center .
we therefore conclude that a level - 1 trauma center can provide high quality trauma care irrespective of the time of patient admission .
the observed patient sample is comparable to other multiple trauma patient - studies with regard to demographics and grade of injury ( iss : 29.7 +/ - 13.0 / 28.8 +/ - 12.1 / median iss 20 ( iqr , 16 - 26 )) [ 25 - 27 ] .
looking at the prehospital parameters , we found no differences between bh and nbh , with the exception of the proportion of air lifted patients , which was significantly lower during nbh .
this might be partially attributable to the air rescue - algorithms in the study hospitals catchment area : after sunset , a helicopter can be demanded in addition by a ground emergency physician [ 28 ] .
it has been shown previously that ordering an air rescue could result in a prolonged prehospital time although this had no impact on the outcome [ 29 ] .
interestingly , the rate of prehospital intubations is not affected by the time of admission which underlines the quality of the well - established area - wide 24 h - ground - emergency - service .
likewise , we found no differences between bh and nbh with regard to the trauma room treatment parameters .
it is well accepted that the human work performance decreases at night [ 30,31 ] , however , an impact of bh and nbh on the monitored care and outcome parameters cannot be demonstrated .
data of the duration of single interventions are scarce .
to the best knowledge of the authors , similar studies examining the duration of single interventions around the clock are not available .
the lack of external benchmarks limits the comparability of this study .
nevertheless , the different time measurements ( time - to - intervention or time period to complete a certain intervention ) were comparable in the bh and nbh study sample .
this indicates , that the trauma team instituted comparable trauma care around the clock .
importantly , the core outcome " 24 h mortality " was similar in bh and nbh. with respect to comparable patient demographics and injury severity , it could be presumed that the care during nbh was on the same level as during bh. this might be attributable to a broad spectrum of factors , including standardized care algorithms , trauma care training and resources available in the level - 1 study hospital .
the observed mortality was up to 16 % lower than in previous studies though sample characteristics were comparable .
this finding is supported by the smr - calculations of huber - wagner et. al .
( 0.68 - 0.77 vs. 0.85 - 0.98 ) [ 25,32 ] .
the clinical outcome of trauma patients in bh versus nbh has been evaluated in very few studies so far [ 27,32 - 36 ] .
in general , consistent results were obtained in regard to clinical outcome in bh and nbh , however , the time needed to institute specific interventions was not recorded .
in contrast , di bartolomeo et al. could demonstrate an off hour effect on trauma patients .
this effect was most evident in transferred cases [ 37 ] .
in other medical emergencies , like stroke [ 38 - 41 ] or myocardial infarction [ 42,43 ] previous studies did n't come to a consistent conclusion regarding the impact of the hospital admission time on the outcome .
conflicting results can be found in the literature concerning time of admittance and outcome [ 44 - 48 ] .
we emphasize that it is important to guarantee a constant high level of quality of care for major trauma patients .
this includes that structural and trauma team requirements have to be fulfilled .
within our study setting ( level - 1 trauma center ) , it seems that there was sufficiently qualified personnel available during business hours as well as during non - business hours [ 49 ] .
since this is a single center study , the chosen interval for bh from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. represents the shift time of all participating disciplines in particular of the trauma surgery and anaesthesia in the study hospital .
in other hospitals , different intervals might fit better .
despite a large and well - defined patient sample , the present study has a number of limitations .
first of all , it is a cohort study with a retrospective design .
second , information on prehospital deaths is not provided since these were not recorded in the database .
third , due to missing data in the trauma registry of the german trauma society ( traumaregister dgu ( r )) , triss was calculated in 76.6 % of all 394 cases only whereas the risc - score was completed in 98.5 % .
fourth : for various reasons , the research fellow was not permanently present in 105 of 499 cases in the trauma room ; therefore these data sets could not be used in this study as is might has biased the results .
finally , even though the trauma room treatment was standardized , the treating trauma team differed ; however , this limitation represents the daily routine in a clinic .
conclusions based on 394 patients , this is the first study that shows that there were no major differences in characteristics , treatment or outcome between multiple trauma patients admitted during bh and those who were admitted during nbh .
this indicates comparable treatment in the sense of quality management regardless of admittance during bh or nbh .
a well - trained staff , well - structured organization and other standardizations of the treatment process could be conducive to this result .

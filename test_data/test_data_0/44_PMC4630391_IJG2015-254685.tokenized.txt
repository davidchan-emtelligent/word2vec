1. introduction next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) technologies , such as illumina / solexa , abi / solid , and roche / 454 pyrosequencing , are revolutionizing the acquisition of genomic data at relatively low cost .
ngs technologies are rapidly changing the approach to complex genomic studies , opening a way to the development of personalized drugs and personalized medicine .
ngs technologies use massive throughput sequencing to obtain relatively short reads .
ngs technologies will generate enormous datasets , in which even small genomic projects may generate terabytes of data .
therefore , new computational methods are needed to analyze a wide range of genetic information and to assist data interpretation and downstream applications , including high - throughput polymorphism detections , comparative genomics , prediction of gene function and protein structure , transcriptome analysis , mutation detection and confirmation , genome mapping , and drug design .
the creation of large - scale datasets now poses a great computational challenge .
it will be imperative to improve software pipelines , so that we can analyze genome data more efficiently .
until now , many new computational methods have been proposed to cope with the big biological data , especially ngs sequence data .
also , many successful bioinformatics applications with ngs data through these methods have unveiled a lot of scientific results , which encourage biologists to adopt novel computing technologies .
the research papers selected for this special issue represent recent progress in the aspects , including theoretical studies , novel algorithms , high performance computing technologies , and method and algorithm improvement .
all of these papers not only provide novel ideas and state - of - the - art technologies in the field but also stimulate future research for next - generation sequencing data analysis and their applications .
2. computational genomics development of efficient algorithms for processing short nucleotide sequences has played a key role in enabling the uptake of dna sequencing technologies in life sciences .
in particular , reassembly of human genomes ( de novo or reference guided ) from short dna sequence reads has had a substantial impact on health research .
de novo assembly of the genome of a species is essential in the absence of a reference genome sequence .
the paper by i. birol et al. entitled " spaced seed data structures for de novo assembly " introduces the data structure designs for spaced seeds in the form of paired k - mers to solve the limitation of the de bruijn graph ( dbg ) paradigm for long reads .
first , bloom filter is used to store spaced seeds , and it can be tolerant of sequencing errors .
then they used a data structure for tracking the frequencies of observed spaced seeds .
next - generation sequencing technologies are now producing multiple times the genome size in total reads from a single experiment .
this is enough information to reconstruct at least some of the differences between the individual genome studied in the experiment and the reference genome of the species .
however , in most typical protocols this information is disregarded and the reference genome is used .
the paper by k. buza et al. entitled " record : reference - assisted genome assembly for closely related genomes " proposes a new approach that allows researchers to reconstruct genomes very closely related to the reference genome ( e.g. , mutants of the same species ) directly from the reads used in the experiment .
their approach applies de novo assembly software , called " record ," to experimental reads and so called pseudoreads and uses the resulting contigs to generate a modified reference sequence .
in this way , it can very quickly , and at no additional sequencing cost , generate new , modified reference sequence that is closer to the actual sequenced genome and has a full coverage .
3. metagenomics characterizing the taxonomic diversity for the planet - size data plays an important role in the metagenomic studies , while a crucial step for doing the study is the binning process to group sequence reads from similar species or taxonomic classes .
the metagenomic binning remains a challenge work because of not only the various read noises but also the tremendous data volume .
the paper by y .
- c. lin entitled " a new binning method for metagenomics by one - dimensional cellular automata " introduces an unsupervised binning method for ngs reads based on the one - dimensional cellular automaton ( 1d - ca ) .
the proposed method facilitates reducing the memory usage because 1d - ca costs only linear space .
4. high performance computing the smith - waterman ( sw ) algorithm has been widely utilized for searching biological sequence databases in bioinformatics .
however , the sw is a time - consuming algorithm and its usage may be limited by the sequence length and the number of sequences in a database .
the previous works related to sw on gpgpu cannot solve the protein database search problem for the next - generation sequencing applications well .
the paper by y. liu et al. entitled " accelerating smith - waterman alignment for protein database search using frequency distance filtration scheme based on cpu - gpu collaborative system " proposes an efficient sw alignment method , called cuda - swfr , for the protein database search by using the intratask parallelization technique based on a cpu - gpu collaborative system .
before doing the sw computations on gpu , a procedure is applied on cpu by using the frequency distance filtration scheme ( fdfs ) to eliminate the unnecessary alignments .
compound comparison is an important task for the computational chemistry. by the comparison results , potential inhibitors can be found and then used for the pharmacy experiments .
the time complexity of a pairwise compound comparison is o ( n 2 ) , where n is the maximal length of compounds .
the intrinsic time complexity of multiple compound comparison problem is o ( k 2 n 2 ) with k compounds of maximal length n. the paper by c .
- y. lin et al. entitled " accelerating multiple compound comparison using lingo - based load - balancing strategies on multi - gpus " proposes a gpu - based algorithm for mcc problem , called cuda - mcc , on single - and multi - gpus .
four lingo - based load - balancing strategies are considered in cuda - mcc in order to accelerate the computation speed among thread blocks on gpus .
5. genomics the circular pattern matching ( cpm ) problem appears as an interesting problem in many biological contexts .
cpm consists in finding all occurrences of the rotations of a pattern p of length m in a text t of length n. the paper by md. a. r. azim et al. entitled " simplificpm : a simple and lightweight filter - based algorithm for circular pattern matching " presents simplificpm , a simple and lightweight filter - based algorithm to solve cpm problem .
much of the speed of the proposed algorithm comes from the fact that our filters are effective but extremely simple and lightweight .
rapid advances in high - throughput sequencing techniques have created interesting computational challenges in bioinformatics .
one of them refers to management of massive amounts of data generated by automatic sequencers .
therefore , an efficient data model to deal with a very large amount of nonconventional data , especially for writing and retrieving operations , is very important .
the paper by r. aniceto et al. entitled " evaluating the cassandra nosql database approach for genomic data persistency " discusses the cassandra nosql database approach for storing genomic data .
they perform an analysis of persistency and i / o operations with real data , using the cassandra database system .
6. conclusion all of the above papers address either novel computational strategies or applications for next - generation sequencing data .
they also develop related method and approach improvements in applications of computational genomics and database .
honorably , this special issue serves as a landmark source for education , information , and reference to professors , researchers , and graduate students interested in updating their knowledge about or active in next - generation sequencing data analysis , metagenomics , computational genomics , and database system .

the rhizome of anemarrhena asphodeloides is used as food and traditional chinese medicine for its hypoglycemic effect .
the aim of this study was to investigate the isolation , purification and hypoglycemic activity of anemaran as the active component .
the influence factors ( isolation duration , ratio of residuals to water and extracting times ) during the isolation process were evaluated .
the optimal conditions for na and aa were extraction temperature 90 ( o ) c and 100 ( o ) c , duration 1h and 1.5 h , extraction time 3 and 3 , and the solid - liquor ratio 1:20 and 1:15 , respectively .
neutral and acid anemaran ( na and aa ) were isolated from the rhizome of anemarrhena asphodeloides .
five fractions of na - 1 , na - 2 , na - 3 , aa - 1 and aa - 2 were obtained after crude neutral and acid anemaran purified through deae - 52 cellulose anion - exchange column .
the characterizations of anemaran and its different fractions were both analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ft - ir ) and scanning electron micrographs ( sem ) .
structural properties of different fractions were examined by ft - ir. strong characteristic absorption peaks were observed at around 1744 cm - 1and 1650 cm - 1 caused by the c = o group of uronic acids , and the band between 1440 cm - 1 and 1395 cm - 1 associated with the stretching vibration of c - o of galacturonic acid .
neither the crude neutral , nor the acid anemaran significantly inhibited the growth of hepg2 cells in - vitro , which indicated the low cytotoxicity of the anemaran .
furthermore , both neutral and acid anemaran showed hypoglycemic effect .
the hypoglycemic effect of neutral anemaran was much higher than that of acid anemaran .
key words anemaran isolation purification characterization hypoglycemic effect introduction the rhizome of anemarrhena asphodeloides bunge ( liliaceae ) has been widely used as a traditional chinese medicine .
its biochemical composition mainly consists of proteins , carbohydrates , steroidal saponins , flavonoids , xanthenes and norlignans .
it has been reported that rhizome anemarrhenae has the activities of anti - diabetes ( 1 , 2 ) and diureses ( 3 ) .
the steroidal saponins ( 4 , 5 ) , xanthenes ( 6 ) and norlignans ( 7 ) were major small molecular constituents of rhizome anemarrhena .
however , polysaccharide of anemarrhena asphodeloides bunge ( anemarans ) has not been received enough attention .
it was reported that some extracts of rhizoma anemarrhenae markedly inhibited growth of cancer cells directly , showed the activities of anti - diabetes , diureses and hypoglycemic effect ( 1 - 3 , 8 - 9 ) .
diabetes is a health endangering chronic metabolic hereditary disease with hyperglycaemia .
it is characterized by metabolic disorders accompanied with hyperphagia , a selective loss of pancreatic islet beta cell mass that results in absolute or relative deficiency of insulin secretion .
impaired insulin action threats human health .
the advanced treatments mainly focus on injecting insulin , oral hypoglycemic drugs and so on. however , these drugs may cause side effects to varying degrees .
therefore , more and more researches were to make drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity , particularly the drug extracted from natural resources with hypoglycemic activity and little side effects ( 10 - 12 ) .
therefore , much attention should be paid on component from plants .
anemarans ( am ) are the components in rhizome anemarrhena and comprise up to 20 % of the rhizome .
there are various reports about immunological activity of the polysaccharide from dioscorea opposita thunb .
roots , antitumor activity of sulfated polysaccharide from gynostemma pentaphyllum makino , hypoglycemic effect of crude exopolysaccharides of phellinus baumii , in - vitro antitumor and antioxidant activities of polysaccharide from sargassum pallidum ( 13 - 15 ) .
it was also reported that neutral anemarans a , b , c and d showed hypoglycemic effect in - vivo ( 1 , 16 ) .
due to its various activities mentioned above , polysaccharide has attracted great attention .
in order to obtain these functional components , numerous studies were carried out further to isolate and characterize polysaccharides from plant and microbial sources with emergence of separation technologies , for example , deae - cellulose anion - exchange chromatography ( deae 52 - cellulose ) for fractionating the extracts , high performance liquid chromatography for determining the molecular weight of each sub - fraction , and gas - liquid chromatography for analyzing neutral sugar composition of polysaccharides ( 17 ) .
in this study , we isolated purified polysaccharides from rhizome anemarrhena by hot water and cellulose deae 52 anion - exchange column in order to purify fractions .
anemarans was analyzed the morphology characterization , ir characters of different anemaran fractions , and evaluated cell growth inhibition and hypoglycemic effect upon hepg2 cells in - vitro .
experimental rhizome anemarrhena herbs were collected in april 2009 from its natural habitat in anguo ( hebei , china ) and authenticated by professor wen - yuan gao .
a voucher specimen has been deposited in school of pharmaceutical science and technology , tianjin university ( tianjin , china ) all the chemical reagents used were analytical grade and obtained from guangfu chemical company ( tianjin , china ) .
deae cellulose 52 anion - exchange column was obtained from guoyao company ( china ) .
the human hepatoma cell line , hepg2 , was purchased from cell resource center , shanghai institutes for biological sciences , chinese academy of sciences .
extraction of neutral anemaran ( na ) and acid anemaran ( aa ) 100 g of the rhizome anemarrhena was washed , dried and comminuted to powders with a plant micro - muller and sieved with 160 mesh sifter .
the dried powder ( 1:10 , w / v ) was extracted with 80 % ethanol three times .
then the residuals were dried in baking oven and extracted with water for the desired duration ( 0.5 to 2.5 h ) at the temperature of 60 ( o ) c to 100 ( o ) c. the ratio of residuals : water varied from 1 : 5 to 1 : 30 .
this procedure was repeated 1 - 5 times .
the water - extracts were combined and centrifuged .
the supernatant obtained was concentrated in a rotary evaporator , and then , precipitated with 95 % ethanol ( 1:3 , v / v ) at 4 degreesc for overnight ( 17 ) .
the precipitation was deproteinated with absolute alcohol , acetone and ethyl ether successively washing , and then lyophilized to obtain about 20 g of crude neutral anemaran ( na ) .
the dried residuals ( 47 g ) after extracted with water , were extracted with 0.1 mol / l naoh aqueous solution for the extraction desired duration ( 0.5 to 2.5 h ) at the temperature of 60 ( o ) c to 100 ( o ) c. the ratio of residuals : water varied from 1 : 5 to 1 : 30 .
this procedure was repeated 1 - 5 times .
the water - extracts were combined and centrifuged .
the supernatant obtained was concentrated in a rotary evaporator , and then , precipitated with 95 % ethanol for overnight ( 1 : 3 , v / v ) at 4 degreesc .
the supernatant was deproteinated with absolute alcohol , acetone and ethyl ether .
the supernatant was lyophilized to give about 1.25 g of crude acid anemaran ( aa ) .
( 18 - 20 ) .
purification of polysaccharide 500 mg of the dried powders of crude polysaccharides ( na and aa ) were redissolved in deionized water and forced through a filter ( 0.45 mum ) , then applied to a column ( 2.6 x 50 cm ) of deae - cellulose a52 .
after loading with sample , the fractions was eluted with gradient nacl aqueous solution ( 0 , 0.1 , 0.3 and 0.5 mol / l ) at a flow rate of 9 ml / h. fractions of 5 ml were collected and monitored by the phenol - sulfuric acid method at 490 nm , using glucose as standard ( 22 , 23 ) .
five different polysaccharide fractions , coded na - 1 , na - 2 , na - 3 , aa - 1 and aa - 2 were obtained .
fourier transform infrared ( ft - ir ) spectroscopy ft - ir spectra of the samples were recorded with an ir spectrometer ( bruker tensor 27 ) using potassium bromide ( kbr ) disks prepared from powdered samples mixed with dry kbr in a ratio of 1:100 in the frequency range 4000 ~ 400 cm - 1 .
scanning electron microscope ( sem ) the anemarans and their purified fractions were detected by a scanning electron microscope ( esem philips xl - 30 ) for morphological features .
the dried samples that passed 200 meshes sieve , were fixed on a glass plate then gold powder was spread uniformly to make the sample conductive for the determination .
an accelerating potential of 20kv was used during micrography .
growth inhibition of hepg 2 cells the inhibition effects of anemarans on the growth of hepg2 cells were evaluated in - vitro by the 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) dye reduction assay ( m8180 , solarbio , china ) .
briefly , the hepg2 cells were seeded at a density of 1.0x105 cells / ml into 96 - well plates in a culture rpmi 1640 medium containing 10 % fbs and in standard incubator conditions ( 37 ( o ) c , 5 % co2 ) .
after 24 h , the cultures were washed and treated with the absence or presence of 100 mul of anemarans ( 1 mg / ml , 0.5 mg / ml , 0.1 mg / ml and 0.05 mg / ml ) for 24 h. and then , 10 mul of mtt solution ( 5 mg / ml ) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h .
100 mul / well of dmso were added to stop the reaction .
the absorbance at 490 nm was measured using elisa reader ( bio - tek el 800 , usa ) after culture medium was removed ( 21 ) .
growth inhibition rate (%) = ( 1 - absorbance of experimental group / absorbance of blank control group ) x 100 % .
glucose consumption assay glucose consumption assay was used for determining hypoglycemic effect .
hepg2 cells , the human hepatocarcinoma cell line were seeded in 96 - well microplate with density of 105 cells per well and maintained in rpmi 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal calf serum with 5 % co2 at 37 ( o ) c overnight before treatment .
subsequently , hepg2 cells were incubated with or without insulin ( 2x10 - 6 mol / l ) for 16 h , washed once with serum - free medium for 20 min , and then treated with the polysaccharide fractions at different concentrations ( 1 , 0.5 , 0.1 and 0.05 mg / ml ) in the presence of 2x10 - 6 mol / l insulin for 24 h ( 15 , 16 ) .
the glucose concentrations in cell culture supernatant of each group were determined by glucose assay kit at 505 nm ( rongsheng , shanghai ) following the manufacturer 's instruction .
hypoglycemic effect was expressed as glucose consumption .
statistical analysis all assays were carried out in triplicates and the results were expressed as mean +/ - sd. statistical analysis was performed using one - way anova followed by duncan multiple comparison test according to the spss 17.0 system .
a probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant .
results and discussion optimization for extraction of neutral and acid anemaran the effect of variation of four parameters , isolation duration , temperature , the ratio of residuals to water and extracting times on neutral and acid polysaccharide yields were investigated in this study ( figure 1 , 2 ) .
figure 1 effects of temperature , time of extraction , ratio of residual water and reaction durations on na yield .
results were presented as means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
figure 2 effects of temperature , time of extraction , ratio of residual water and reaction durations on aa yield .
results were presented as means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
the effects of different temperatures of 60 , 70 , 80 , 90 and 100 ( o ) c on polysaccharides ( na and aa ) yields are shown in figure 1a and figure 2a. with temperature increasing , the yield of crude polysaccharides increased until 90 ( o ) c for na ( figure 1a ) .
therefore , 90 ( o ) c was selected as the centre point of extracting temperature in this experiment as higher temperature would cause energy waste and decrease the yield .
this could be due to the fact that higher temperature might cause degradation of anemaran ( 24 , 25 ) .
however , it is observed that the yield of aa increased from 9.2 % to 32 % with the temperature increasing from 60 to 100 ( o ) c. the yield of polysaccharides obtained at 90 ( o ) c was significantly higher than that obtained at 60 , 70 and 80 ( o ) c , but not significantly different from that obtained at the temperature of 100 ( o ) c for aa ( figure 2a ) .
the optimum temperature at 90 ( o ) c was good for both producing more na and aa. the results of extraction times affecting on the yield of polysaccharides are shown in figure 1b and figure 2b .
the results obtained by investigating the effect of solid and liquor ratio on ds are shown in figure 1c and figure 2c .
the amount of residuals and reactants used during these experiments was constant , but the ratio of residuals / water decreased by increasing the amount of solvent .
the optimum yield at residuals / water ratio was 1 : 20 for na and 1:15 for aa , at the ratio of which the most of polysaccharide was isolation ( 18 , 19 ) .
the polysaccharide yield of the fourth time extraction became very low compared with three times .
in order to improve production efficiency of na and aa , this process could be held on for three times .
the yield increases with the extraction durations elevated and reaches a maximum in 1.5 h for na and a significant decrease was observed when the time increasing thereafter .
similar observations were observed in 2h for aa ( figure 1d and figure 2d ) .
purification of polysaccharide the extracts of na and aa were fractionated by deae - cellulose - 52 anion - exchange column to obtain five main fractions ( na - 1 , na - 2 , na - 3 , aa - 1 and aa - 2 ) based on total carbohydrate elution profile ( figure 3 ) .
all the fractions of na and aa appeared as white powders .
they had no absorption at 280 or 260 nm in the uv spectrum , indicating the absence of protein and nucleic acid .
after na fractionation on deae - cellulose 52 anion - exchange column , na - 1 ( 166.9 mg ) , na - 2 ( 100 mg ) and na - 3 ( 16.8 mg ) were obtained from 0 mg / l , 0.1 mg / l and 0.3 mg / l nacl elution , respectively ( figure 3a ) .
in a similar manner , a lyophilized fraction of polysaccharides aa was chromatographed on a deae cellulose - 52 anion - exchange column to yield two peaks , aa - 1 ( 98.2 mg ) and aa - 2 ( 180 mg ) ( figure 3b ) .
however , there were no absorbance for 0.1 mol / l nacl elution of na , and 0.1 and 0.5 mol / l nacl elution of aa , respectively .
it is reported that the concentration of sample , elution rate and exchange capacity of the chromatography column was closely related to separation effect ( 14 , 18 ) .
figure 3 elution curve of polysaccharide fractions in deae - cellulose 52 anion - exchange column purified by different concentrations of nacl aq. a : na ( 1 , 2 and 3 ) ; b : aa ( 1 and 2 ) ( - * - absorbance at 490 nm .... nacl gradient ) .
na : neutral anemaran ; aa : acid anemaran .
ft - ir analysis ft - ir spectrum of na , aa and their purified fractions are shown in figure 4 - 1 , 2 .
the ft - ir spectra of na and aa were found to be similar .
the band between 3600 and 3300 cm - 1 ( na : 3419 cm - 1 , and aa : 3444 cm - 1 ) represented the stretching vibration of polysaccharide glycoside hydroxyl .
the small band at around 2933 cm - 1 was associated with stretching vibration of c - h in the sugar ring ( 26 ) .
the peak at around 1745 cm - 1 and the weak one at near 1377 cm - 1 of na were different from that of aa. the two peaks above were indicative of the presence of carboxyl groups , which indicated the characteristic ft - ir absorption of uronic acids ( 27 , 28 ) .
the bands at 1649 cm - 1 ( figure 4 - 1d ) and 1652 cm - 1 ( figure 4 - 2c ) displayed the - cho stretching vibration or n - h deviational vibration of protein ; peak at 1423 cm - 1 displayed c - o stretching vibration of galacturonic acid .
the absorption peak at about 1627 cm - 1 was due c = o stretch of carboxylic anions ( salt ) of galacturonic acid .
a hydration peak of polysaccharide at 873 cm - 1 indicated that na - 1 and na - 3 contained the beta - glycosidic linkage ( 25 , 29 ) .
therefore , beta - galactan was mainly observed in na - 1 and na - 3 .
however , there is no absorption at 4000 cm - 1 and 400 cm - 1 in na eluting with 0.3 mol / l nacl aqueous solution and aa eluting with 0.3 mol / l nacl aqueous solution .
figure 4 ( 1 ) ft - ir spectrum of na fraction : na ( a ) ; na - 1 ( b ) ; na - 2 ( c ) ; na - 3 ( d ) .

( 2 ) ft - ir spectrum of aa parts : aa ( a ) , aa - 1 ( b ) , aa - 2 ( c ) .
sem analysis the sem photographs of na , aa and their different fractions are shown in figure 5 - 1 , 2 .
crude na anemaran exhibited large irregular non - homogeneous lumps with cracks and particle on the surface of the granules .
however , the crude aa displayed polygonal or irregular shape with no cracks .
na - 1 , na - 2 and na - 3 fractions compared with crude na showed significant variation in size and shape when viewed by sem .
the size became smaller and fewer particles adhered to the granules with concentrations of nacl aqueous solution increasing from 0 - 0.5 mol / l for na. the similar phenomenon occurred in aa. figure 5 ( 1 ) sem of na fractions .

na : acid anemaran .

aa : acid anemaran .
in - vitro growth inhibition of hepg 2 cells the cytotoxicity ( growth inhibition ) of na and aa was evaluated in hepg2 cells after treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations ( 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.5 and 1 mug / ml ) of samples using mtt assay against blank control groups ( table 1 ). with concentration ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mug / ml , na did not significantly inhibit the growth of hepg2 cells .
furthermore , the effect of na at concentration of 1mug / ml was not detected .
aa did not significantly exhibit inhibition ratios when the concentrations varied from 0.05 to 0.1 mug / ml with inhibition ratio of 0.0027 %~ 0.0192 % , which was higher than that of na. anemaran and steroidal saponins of rhizome anemarrhena have been identified as the active components responsible for hypoglycemic action and anti - tumor effects ( 5 - 9 ) .
however , most studies merely focused on the cytotoxicity of the rhizome anemarrhena extracts and little information regarding the cytotoxicity .
we have successfully identified that the fractions of na and aa did not significantly inhibit the growth of hepg2 cells .
table 1 growth inhibition and hypoglycemic effect of two anemarans fractions against hepg2 cells in - vitro treatment concentration ( mug / ml ) growth inhibition rate (%) normal control - 0 na 1 nd 0.5 0.0092 +/ - 0.0004 0.1 0.0162 +/ - 0.0024 0.05 0.017 +/ - 0.0018 aa 1 nd 0.5 nd 0.1 0.0192 +/ - 0.0016 0.05 0.0027 +/ - 0.0032 nd : not detected values are mean +/ - sd of three replicates .
control cells were incubated with medium alone .
the result was expressed as glucose consumption .
ap < 0.01 : normal control ( without insulin and anemaran treatment ) ; * p < 0.05 : diabetic control ( without anemaran treatment ) .
glucose consumption assay complicated metabolic disorders cause diabetes with high blood glucose level .
the secretion of insulin may decrease with a decrease in pancreatic beta cell mass or function disturbances of beta cells ( 30 ) .
the liver cells are more resistant than the muscle tissue and the fats .
insulin resistance in liver cells results in impaired glycogen synthesis and a failure to suppress glucose production ( 31 ) .
so , we used hepg2 , a human hepatoma cell line , with high concentration of insulin ( 2x10 - 6 m ) to establish an insulin - resistant cell model , which expressed an insensitive response to normal - concentration insulin ( 10 - 9 m ) .
table 2 showed high - concentration insulin - treated hepg2 cells suffered an obvious glucose consumption decrease compared with the normal cells ( ap < 0.01 ) , indicating the insulin - resistant model was simulated successfully in - vitro .
after the liver cells were treated with na and aa for 24 h , the glucose consumption increased at the concentrations from 0.05 to 1 mug / ml. the results suggest that na can increase the glucose consumption significantly of insulin - resistant cells compared with the model control cells (* p < 0.05 ) .
insulin - resistant cells were more sensitive to na than to the aa. however , the purified fractions of na and aa have no hypoglycemic activity in - vitro .
it has been reported that anemarans a , b , c and d and many other polysaccharides could decrease of blood glucose in - vivo ( 1 ) .
however , the total neutral anemarans showed significant hypoglycemic activity , which is different from the results reported above ( 1 ) .

conclusions previous studies have indicated that anemarans a , b , c and d show hypoglycemic effect .
in this study , the isolation process of anemarans was investigated and the optimum isolation condition of extracting anemarans from rhizome anemarrhena was obtained .
neutral and acid anemarans nearly did not inhibit growth inhibition of hepg2 cells .
it was demonstrated that neutral anemarans ( na ) exhibited higher hypoglycemic effect than acid anemarans ( aa ) .
according to our purification experiment , five different polysaccharide fractions , na - 1 , na - 2 , na - 3 , aa - 1 and aa - 2 , were obtained .
sem result showed that neutral fractions , na - 1 and aa - 1 have smaller particles adhered to the granule surface than acid fractions .
according to ft - ir , the peaks at about 873 cm - 1 revealed beta - galactan mainly observed in na - 1 and na - 3 .
further investigations need to be carried out to check the activity of each fraction of purified anemaran .

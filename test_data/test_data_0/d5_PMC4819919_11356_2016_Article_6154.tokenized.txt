concentrations of ba , zn , pb , fe , and mn were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy in freshly cast antlers from male roe deer of different ages ( 2 to 4 years old and older than 4 years ) collected in balin near chrzanow and in the vicinity of zywiec , s poland .
barium content ranged from 124 to 196 ppm ( mean 165 ppm ) in the balin 12 samples and from 207 to 351 ppm ( mean 287 ppm ) in 3 antlers from zywiec .
the concentration of ba was comparable to that of zn ( 134 - 275 ppm , mean 169 ppm ) .
elevated concentrations of ba in antlers most probably originated from direct uptake of airborne barite nanocrystals through the respiratory system and / or by digestion of barite - rich dust particles deposited on plants .
burning of ba - enriched coals is regarded as the principal source of ba in the investigated areas inhabited by roe deer .
increased concentrations of ba in antlers from the zywiec area compared to balin reflect particularly high air pollution caused by coal - burning mostly for domestic purposes combined with an unfavorable topography that impedes efficient air circulation .
keywords cast antlers roe deer barium biomonitoring coal - burning statutory fund - issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag berlin heidelberg 2016 introduction antlers are the only mammalian bony appendages capable of full regeneration and the fastest growing bones of vertebrates .
roe deer ( capreolus capreolus ) initiate antler growth in autumn and antlers mature in early spring after ~ 130 days , when the terminal mineralization of the antler bone stops .
the skin ( velvet ) is shed and the so - called hard antlers are exposed .
antlers are retained on the buck 's head until autumn when they are cast followed by the immediate regeneration of a new set of antlers ( pielowski 1984 ; kierdorf and kierdorf 2005 ) .
antlers of various deer species are used as biomonitors for temporal and / or spatial variations in contaminant concentrations in the environment because during their growth they accumulate pollutants ( kierdorf and kierdorf 2005 ) .
strontium - 90 , a radionuclide with a half - life of ca .
29 years , was the first isotope studied in antler tissues to assess the environmental impact of radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests ( hawthorn and duckworth 1958 ) .
fluoride and lead are the most commonly determined elements in antlers due to their preferred incorporation into the mineral phase of antler bone ( e.g. , kardell and kallman 1986 ; tataruch 1995 ; kierdorf and kierdorf 2002 ; 2003 ; 2005 ; pokorny et al. 2004 ; pokorny et al. 2009 ; jelenko and pokorny 2010 ; sobota et al. 2011 ) .
cd , zn , fe , mn , cu , co , cr , and ni have also been determined in antlers ( e.g. , sawicka - kapusta 1978 ; medvedev 1995 ; purdey 2004 ; landete - castillejos et al. 2012 ) .
to our knowledge there are only two reports on ba concentrations in antlers ( purdey 2004 ; kierdorf et al. 2014 ) .
the barium ion is toxic if bioavailable .
for example , oral exposure to low - dose ba can result in severe ototoxicity with degeneration of inner ears in mammals ( ohgami et al. 2012 ) .
barium can potentially cause hypertension in humans ( who world health organization 2004 ) .
fortunately , ba availability is largely limited in the environment due to the high stability of its main salt - - barite ( baso4 ; solubility product , ksp of 1.08 x 10 - 10 at 25 degreesc ) .
still , under certain condition ba can occur in soluble forms at concentrations much greater than expected from barite solubility ( pluta and trembaczowski 2001 ; smith et al. 2004 ; smieja - krol and bauerek 2015 ) .
in the present study , the concentrations of ba , zn , pb , fe , and mn were determined in roe deer antlers collected in two sites of southern poland , located in the proximity of upper silesia - one of the european largest industrial and urban regions .
elevated concentrations of zn , pb , cd , and fe in antlers of roe deer were previously documented in upper silesian forests ( sawicka - kapusta 1978 ) .
the purpose of this study was to determine whether the large - scale burning of ba - enriched coals in upper silesia and surroundings is reflected in the ba concentration in roe deer antlers .
materials and methods twelve freshly cast antlers from male roe deer of different ages ( 2 to 4 years old and older than 4 years ) were collected 2 - 3 km west of a village ( balin ) located between the cities of jaworzno and chrzanow , immediately to the east of upper silesia .
another three antlers from 2 to 4 year old male roe deer were collected in the forest of the beskid zywiecki mountains , 4 - 5 km south - east from the city of zywiec .
most of the antlers were collected by local hunters near cultivated food plots in autumn 2009 .
antlers overlooked during the autumn sampling campaign were found in spring 2010 after melting of snow cover .
no animal was killed or harmed to collect antlers .
atomic absorption spectroscopy ( solaar m6 ) was used for the determination of ba , fe , mn , pb , and zn in antlers .
samples were homogenized in a mill , dried at 105 degreesc , then ashed at 550 degreesc for 24 h. the digestion was carried out in hot 5 % citric acid in platinum crucibles for 3 - 4 h. all metal concentrations were corrected for procedural blanks .
the quality of the analytical data for pb , zn , and fe was checked using the standard reference material ( nist 1486 bone meal ) .
the results of metal analyses are presented on a dry weight basis .
the limit of detection for fe , mn , pb , and zn in antlers was 2 ppm ( mg / kg ) and for ba 20 ppm .
relationships between metals were examined using spearman rank correlation coefficient at a confidence level alpha = 0.05 .
results and discussion metal concentrations in the antlers the concentrations of ba , zn , pb , mn , and fe in the analyzed antlers are given in table 1 .
barium content ranges from 124 to 196 ppm ( mean value 165 ppm ) in the balin samples and from 207 to 351 ppm ( mean value 287 ppm ) in antlers from the vicinity of zywiec ( tab. 1 ) .
the concentration of ba is comparable to the concentration of zn. the latter spans the range between 134 and 275 ppm , with a mean value of 169 ppm .
unlike ba , there is no marked difference in zn concentrations between samples from balin and zywiec .
the concentration of fe covers a wide range between 99 and 553 ppm .
lead concentration ranges from less than 2.0 ppm to 14.5 ppm .
manganese concentrations are scattered over a wide range ( 2.0 - 63 ppm ) , with an average value of 20.7 ppm .
there is no obvious difference in the measured metals concentrations between deer of different age .

the typical ba content in bones of terrestrial mammals is between 5 - 30 ppm , while concentrations in soft tissues range between 0.1 and 2.5 ppm ( dry weight ; kabata - pendias and pendias 1999 ) .
the investigated antlers are on average ( 189 ppm ) enriched in ba over six times in respect to the highest reference concentration ( 30 ppm ) in the mammalian bones provided by kabata - pendias and pendias ( 1999 ) .
the higher content of ba in antlers , relative to more slowly growing types of bone , can only be partially explained by the rapid incorporation of metals during antlers growth .
the maximum ba concentration of 351 ppm in antlers from the zywiec area is markedly higher than the maximum value of 280 ppm obtained by purdey ( 2004 ) in antlers of deer thriving in areas affected by chronic wasting decease .
the maximum ba concentration in antlers of north american deer living in areas not affected by chronic wasting decease was 74 ppm ( purdey 2004 ) .
high ba concentrations ( 255 - 395 ppm , dry weight ) were recorded in red deer antlers sampled in the 1980s and early 1990s in western germany and the netherlands ( kierdorf et al. 2014 ) .
concentrations of pb ( table 1 ) are well within a range reported for antlers ( 4.8 - 28 ppm ) by sawicka - kapusta ( 1978 ) and bone tissues ( 4 - 25 ppm ; kabata - pendias and pendias 1999 ) , whereas the highest concentrations of fe measured during this study ( 425 and 553 ppm ) exceed fe values typical for bones ( 5 - 300 ppm ; kabata - pendias and pendias 1999 ) .
zinc preferentially concentrates in muscles ( 100 - 200 ppm ) over bones ( 50 - 150 ppm ) ( kabata - pendias and pendias 1999 ) .
its average content in the antlers ( 169 ppm ) is slightly above the bone range and similar to values ( 110 - 180 ppm ) reported by sawicka - kapusta ( 1978 ) for antlers sampled in upper silesia .
the mn content in antlers ranges from 2 to 63 ppm and in six samples ( table 1 ) its content is 2 to 6 times higher than typically found in bones ( 0.2 - 10 ppm ; kabata - pendias and pendias 1999 ) .
the statistical analysis ( spearman rank correlation ) revealed weak positive correlations only between fe and zn ( rs = 0.61 ; p < 0.05 ) and fe and mn ( rs = 0.53 ; p < 0.05 ) , while concentrations of the other elements were uncorrelated ( all p > 0.05 ) .
sources of barium the main source of barium in the antlers from balin and zywiec is most probably upper silesian coal - burning for both domestic and industrial uses ( rozkowska and ptak 1995 ; wojcik and smolka - danielowska 2008 ; wilczynski 2013 ) .
processing of zn - pb ores and dust deposition from cement plants might be of some importance in balin , although these activities have recently been significantly reduced .
barium is a coalphile element with a coal affinity index ( cai = average element concentration in coal ash / clarke value in sedimentary rocks ) of 2.3 ( ketris and yudovich 2009 ) .
barium concentrations in upper silesian coals range from 0.2 to 4260 ppm with a mean value of 176 ppm ( rozkowska and ptak 1995 ) , higher than the mean ba concentration of 150 ppm in world coals ( ketris and yudovich 2009 ) .
accordingly , ba content in the ash of upper silesian coals is almost twice as high ( 1852 ppm ) as the world 's mean concentration of 980 ppm , resulting in a cai of 4.5 .
in 2009 , the dust emission from coal combustion in poland amounted to 176,400 mg. sixty - six percent of that dust was emitted from domestic heating systems ( wilczynski 2013 ) .
as a result of such a high dust emission , the threshold value of 40 mug / m3 set by the eu for particulate matter ( pm10 ) was significantly exceeded in the antlers' collecting sites during the heating season ( fig. 1 ) .
zywiec and its surroundings particularly suffered from the ineffective coal combustion in domestic heating systems while lacking large industrial emission sources .
the problem of air pollution is worsened by the location of the city in a intermontane basin and the resulting impeded air circulation. fig. 1 concentration of airborne particulate matter with the aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mum ( pm10 ) at monitoring stations located close to the sampling sites ( http :// monitoring.katowice.wios.gov.pl /) barite nanocrystals ( 20 to 160 nm in diameter ) are common and abundant in atmospheric dust in and around the region of upper silesia ( jablonska et al. 2001 ) .
numerous of these nanocrystals occur within the respirable particles of hydrocarbons that can enter the mammalian respiratory system .
in fact , barite particles , 0.42 - 0.60 mum in diameter , were observed in lungs of humans living in upper silesia ( jablonska 2013 ) .
barium incorporation pathways two uptake routes must be considered to explain ba accumulation in roe deer antlers , viz .
direct uptake through the respiratory system and by digestion .
dermal absorption is not expected to play any significant role .
the solubilization of inhaled barite has been demonstrated in numerous studies by clearance of barite from the respiratory system followed by skeletal accumulation and urinary excretion of ba ( e.g. , morrow et al. 1964 ; cuddihy et al. 1974 ) .
the exposure to barium through food ingestion can be of significance only if ba - enriched dust particles are deposited on plant surfaces .
barite particles were observed on scots pine ( pinus sylvestris ) needles by scanning electron microscopy ( teper 2009 ) as result of wind re - deposition from zn - pb flotation tailing ponds at a site located 17 km ne from balin .
barium concentration in soils and its uptake by plants seem to be less important for the ba accumulation in antlers .
barium concentrations in antlers from the zywiec area are higher than in antlers from balin ( table 1 ) , despite the higher ba content in soils near balin .
barium concentration in topsoil ( 0 - 30 cm ) in balin ranges from 30 to 240 ppm ( pasieczna 2011 ) ; whereas ba content in topsoil in the vicinity of zywiec is generally less than 50 ppm ( lis and pasieczna 1995 ) .
while plants are known to accumulate ba in their green parts ( kabata - pendias and pendias 1999 ; galuszka et al .
2015 ) , and food ingestion was identified as the primary exposure to ba ( atsdr agency for toxic substances and disease registry 2007 ) , this intake route cannot explain the difference in ba concentrations in antlers from the balin and zywiec areas .
conclusions elevated concentrations of ba observed in antlers during this study most probably originated from direct uptake of airborne barite nanocrystals through the respiratory system and / or by digestion of barite - rich dust particles deposited on plants .
burning of ba - enriched coals is the principal source of ba in the investigated areas inhabited by roe deer .
it is not known if elevated concentrations of ba in antlers reflect adverse health effects caused by accumulation of this toxic element in deer as suggested by studies in north america .
the mechanism of solubilization of apparently insoluble barite inhaled or ingested by mammals requires further study .

aim so , we wanted , in this work , to realize a radiological assessment of the static data in the spine - pelvis - thigh complex , in children with cp , and made a comparison with an asymptomatic population .
methods the population of cp is made up 119 children , and the asymptomatic population made up of 652 children .
the radiographs of the sagittal plane , in large format ( 30cmx90cm ) , are realized in a comfortable position , knees and hips in maximal extension .
analyses were performed , using the optispine ( r ) software , to measure radiological parameters of the whole spine - pelvis - thigh .
results comparing the two populations , we found no difference in the shape parameter ( pelvic incidence ) for against a significant difference was demonstrated on the positional parameters ( pelvic tilt and sacral slope ) of the pelvis .
regarding the spine , we found a difference in the angulation of lumbar lordosis , and the orientation of the latter , as well as the number of vertebrae included in the kyphosis , and its orientation .
there is also a significant difference in the c7 plumb line .
conclusion we can say that the cp population is not specifically different from the control population .
growth disrupts the settings , with the need to prevent these troubles , as soon as possible , to the condition to be concerned , and able to search for .

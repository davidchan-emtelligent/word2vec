exogenous methyl jasmonate ( meja ) is well - known to induce plant defense mechanisms effective against a wide variety of insect and microbial pests .
high - resolution 2 - de gel electrophoresis was used to discover changes in the leaf proteome of maize exposed to meja .
we sequenced 62 meja - responsive proteins by tandem mass spectroscopy , and deposited the mass spectra and identities in the embl - ebi pride repository under reference number pxd001793 .
an analysis and discussion of the identified proteins in relation to maize defense against asian corn borer is published by zhang et al .

3 data , experimental design , materials and methods sixty - two maize proteins reproducibly differentially - accumulated in response to exogenous meja treatment were identified by 2 - de page .
these were subjected to mass spectroscopy and bioinformatics analysis for sequencing and identification .
3.1 plant materials , growth and meja exposure seeds of zea mays l. dongnong 250 were sown into plastic basins ( 1x15 cm2 ) and kept at room temperature .
the plants were grown at 27 + 1 degreesc with a 14:10 h ( light : dark ) photoperiod with 80 % relative humidity .
when the maize plants developed to the interior leaf period , they were treated with 225 microm of meja for 12 h , frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 degreesc for protein extraction .
three batches of biological replicates were collected for both control and treated samples .
3.2 protein extraction after meja treatment , corn leaves were grounded into powder in liquid nitrogen .
proteins were precipitated in a 10 % tca , cold acetone solution containing 0.07 % beta - mercaptoethanol at - 20 degreesc for two hours .
after centrifugation at 40,000g at 4 degreesc for one hour , the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was rinsed with - 20 degreesc cold acetone containing 0.07 % beta - mercaptoethanol .
the final pellet was vacuum - dried and solubilized on ice for about one hour in a 3 ml solution of 7 m urea , 2 m thiourea , 40 mm dtt and 1 % protease inhibitor mixture ( ge healthcare , usa ) .
insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for one hour .
the protein concentration was determined using the 2 - de quant kit ( ge healthcare , usa ) with bsa as a standard .
samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80 degreesc for further analysis .
3.3 2 - de gel electrophoresis proteins from the control group and meja - treated plants were compared using 2 - de gel image analysis .
the isoelectric points of the spots ranged from 4 to 7 , and the molecular masses ranged from 10 to 120 kda .
for each sample , 1 mg total protein in 450 microl rehydration buffer ( 7 m urea , 2 m thiourea , 2 % chaps , 0.5 % ipg buffer with ph 4 - 7 , 0.04 m dtt ) was loaded onto a 24 cm , ph 4 - 7 linear gradient ipg strip ( ge healthcare , usa ) .
isoelectric focusing was performed using an ettan ipgphor 3 isoelectric focusing ( ief ) system according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the focusing conditions were as follows : active rehydration was carried out at low voltage for 12 h , followed by 300 v for 1 h , 600 v for 1 h , 1000 v for 1 h , with a linear increase of voltage to 8000 v for 12 h at 20 degreesc .
the voltage was held at 10,000 v until the total voltage hours reached 80,000 .
after ief , the strips were equilibrated with an equilibration solution ( 50 mm tris with ph 8.8 , 6 m urea , 30 % glycerol , 1 % dtt , 2 % sds ) followed by alkylation in equilibration solution with 2.5 % iodoacetamide , each for 15 min .
the second dimension was performed on the 12.5 % polyacrylamide gels using an ettan dalt six electrophoresis unit ( ge healthcare , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the 2 - de gel electrophoresis experiments were repeated three times using protein samples prepared independently from meja treated and control maize .
3.4 detection and identification of meja - responsive proteins proteins were visualized with coomassie brilliant blue r250 and gel images ( fig. 1 ) were acquired using an imagescanner ( ge healthcare , usa ) .
replicate gels from control and meja treatment were analyzed with imagemaster 2 - d platinum software version 7.0 ( amersham biosciences , usa ) .
the experimental molecular weight ( kda ) of each protein was estimated by comparison with the protein markers , and experimental isoelectric points were determined by migration distance on the ipg strip .
the abundance of each protein spot was estimated by the percent volume .
only those spots with significant and reproducible changes were considered to be differentially expressed proteins .
the normalized volumes of the spots from replicate gels were subjected to student 's anova test ( p < 0.05 ) and only statistically significant data were considered .
protein in - gel tryptic digestion and nanoesi ms / ms analysis were carried out on a qstar xl ms / ms system ( ab sciex inc. , usa ) as previously described [ 2 ] .
the peptide ms / ms spectra were searched against an ncbi non - redundant fasta database using the mascot search engine ( http :// www.matrixscience.com ) .
mascot was set up to search green plants only , assume trypsin digestion and allow one miscleavage .
the mass tolerances for both parent ion and fragment ion masses were set to be 0.2 da. iodoacetamide derivatization of cys , deamidation of asn and gln , and oxidation of met were specified as variable modifications .
we initially performed a fixed modification analysis and found that most of the differential protein spots had cys modifications .
thus , we set iodoacetamide derivization of cys as a variable modification to obtain better alignments .
unambiguous identification was judged by the number of peptides , sequence coverage , mascot score and the quality of ms / ms spectra .
conflicts of interest none .

ulk1 interferon type i interferon ( ifn ) signaling leads to transcription and translation of key ifn - stimulated genes ( isgs ) , whose protein products exhibit anti - tumorigenic , anti - viral , and immunomodulatory functions [ 1 - 3 ] .
these responses are triggered by the interaction of type i ifns ( ifnalpha , ifnbeta , ifnomega ) with a unique cell surface receptor composed by two subunits : ifnalpha receptor 1 ( ifnar1 ) and ifnar2 [ 1 - 3 ] .
after the type i ifn receptor is targeted by different members of this cytokine family , there is induction of the kinase activities of two known kinases ; tyrosine kinase 2 ( tyk2 ) and janus kinase 1 ( jak1 ) , which activate several downstream signaling pathways , including stat ( signal transducer and activator of transcription ) , mapkkk ( mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase kinase ) , pi3k ( phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ) - akt , mtorc1 ( mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ) , and mtorc2 signaling cascades [ 1 - 3 ] .
there has been rapid accumulation of information in the ifn - signaling field for over two decades .
a detailed map of signaling events and elements that ultimately control ifn - responses has emerged [ 1 - 3 ] .
yet , unique mechanisms accounting for activation and coordination of distinct ifn signaling pathways still need to be defined .
similarly , the elements that account for optimized cellular responses and adjust the balance between negative and positive cellular control in the ifn - response , remain to be established .
in a recently published report , we identified unc - 51 - like kinase 1 ( ulk1 ) as a novel positive regulator of type i ifn signaling , which is essential for both type i ifn - induced anti - viral and anti - proliferative responses [ 4 ] .
additionally , we presented evidence showing that engagement of type i ifn receptor activates a novel pathway , possibly involving both pi3k - akt - dependent and independent meditators , culminating in activation of ulk1 [ 4 ] .
importantly , ulk1 kinase activity seems to cooperate , either directly or through intermediate kinases , with the mapkkk - mkk3 / 6 signaling cascade for optimal ifn - induced activation of p38 mapk [ 4 ] .
thus , ulk1 activation appears to mediate transcription of isgs , in part , via regulation of the p38 mapk pathway [ 4 ] .
in a recent report , ulk1 was shown to localize to the nucleus and promote cell death by increasing poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase 1 ( parp1 ) activity in response to reactive oxygen species - induced cellular damage [ 5 ] .
these new findings , taken together with our recently published report [ 4 ] , raise the intriguing possibility that ulk1 translocates into the nucleus in response to type i ifns , and could directly or indirectly control transcription of isgs , but this remains to be explored in future studies .
type i ifns can be produced by all nucleated cell types in response to pathogen infection , physiological signals , and other inducers and stimuli [ 6 , 7 ] .
however , the induction of an ifn response involves expression and activation of both positive and negative regulators of type i ifn production and signaling [ 6 , 7 ] .
many of these negative regulators are isgs and ifn - regulated proteins , which control the time and magnitude of an ifn response , preventing inflammation and tissue damage [ 6 , 7 ] .
interestingly , this seems to be the case also for ulk1 [ 8 ] .
the stimulator of ifn genes ( sting ) is activated by cyclic dinucleotides , leading to activation of tbk1 ( traf family member associated nf - kappab activator - binding kinase 1 ) and phosphorylation of irf3 [ 6 , 7 ] .
active irf3 translocates into the nucleus and induces expression of ifn genes , initiating an ifn response [ 6 , 7 ] .
our data suggests that ulk1 is activated downstream of the type i ifn receptor , leading to transcription of key isgs and positively mediating ifn responses [ 4 ] .
however , based on other recent work , at a later stage ulk1 is activated by cyclic dinucleotides and acts as a negative regulator of sting , resulting in inhibition of irf3 , and subsequent blockage of type i ifn production , thus shutting down the ifn response [ 8 ] .
thus , taking together the evidence presented by kono et al .
[ 8 ] and our findings [ 4 ] , one can propose a model in which ulk1 may initially promote ifn responses against pathogens , but it later inhibits sting activity and ifn production , thus limiting / optimizing the ifn response ( figure 1 ) .
further studies are warranted to fully understand this dual role of ulk1 in the ifn system .
this has important implications in the ifn - signaling field and may provoke other questions in the future .
for example , it would be interesting to identify putative phosphorylation sites of ulk1 that may correlate with negative versus positive regulatory effects on type i ifn responses .
a complete understanding of the mechanisms of action of ulk1 during ifn - signaling may also prove fundamental for the development of better therapies designed to either promote or inhibit type i ifn - dependent responses .

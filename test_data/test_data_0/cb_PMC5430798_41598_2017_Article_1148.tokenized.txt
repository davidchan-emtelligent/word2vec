double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) constitutes a potent activator of innate immunity , given its ability to bind intracellular pattern recognition receptors during viral infections or sterile tissue damage .
while effects of dsdna in immune cells have been extensively studied , dsdna signalling and its pathophysiological implications in non - immune cells , such as the vascular endothelium , remain poorly understood .
the aim of this study was to characterize prothrombotic effects of dsdna in vascular endothelial cells .
transfection of cultured human endothelial cells with the synthetic dsdna poly ( da : dt ) induced upregulation of the prothrombotic molecules tissue factor and pai - 1 , resulting in accelerated blood clotting in vitro , which was partly dependent on rig - i signalling .
prothrombotic effects were also observed upon transfection of endothelial cells with hepatitis b virus dna - containing immunoprecipitates as well human genomic dna .
in addition , dsdna led to surface expression of von willebrand factor resulting in increased platelet - endothelium - interactions under flow .
eventually , intrascrotal injection of dsdna resulted in accelerated thrombus formation upon light / dye - induced endothelial injury in mouse cremaster arterioles and venules in vivo .
in conclusion , we show that viral or endogenous dsdna induces a prothrombotic phenotype in the vascular endothelium .
these findings represent a novel link between pathogen - and danger - associated patterns within innate immunity and thrombosis .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction the innate immune system constitutes a key response to both invading pathogens and sterile injury by recognition of pathogen associated - or danger associated molecular patterns ( pamps or damps , respectively ) .
in this context lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) , peptidoglycans , high - mobility group protein - 1 ( hmgb1 ) , double stranded dna ( dsdna ) and others are released into the circulation1 - 3 .
dsdna is a powerful activator of the innate immune system4 and acts via several so called pattern - recognition receptors such as tlr - 9 ( toll - like receptor 9 ) , aim2 ( absent in melanoma 2 ) , dai ( dna - dependent activator of irfs ) , rig - i ( after transformation of dna by rna polymerase iii ) 4 , 5 , and most recently interferon - gamma - inducible protein16 ( ifi16 ) and cgamp synthase ( cgas ) have been discovered and shown to recognize intracellular dsdna6 .
while the dsdna - mediated immune response has been extensively studied in immune cells , little is known so far about the pathophysiological relevance of dsdna for the vascular endothelium .
dsdna plays a central role in viral infections such as hepatitis b , which often manifest as systemic diseases involving several organs including the vascular system .
morbidity and mortality result in part from vasculitis7 , 8 but also from thrombotic complications including fatal thrombo - embolic events , such as myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke9 , 10 .
moreover viral infections are likely to play a role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis11 .
even though not primarily considered part of the immune system , the endothelium as the inner layer of blood vessels plays a major role in host defense constituting an anatomical and functional barrier for pathogens to invade tissues .
additionally , the endothelium has essential function in suppressing inflammation and thrombosis by controlling vascular tone and function12 .
endothelial inflammation leads to disruption of the haemostatic balance towards a prothrombotic state with increased risk of thrombo - embolic events13 .
activated ecs are known to facilitate blood coagulation by down - regulation of antithrombotic proteins , such as thrombomodulin , tissue plasminogen activator or endothelial protein c receptor and by increased expression of procoagulant proteins such as the antifibrinolytic plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( pai - 1 ) or tissue factor ( tf ) 14 .
we and others have previously shown , that the vascular endothelium is able to sense intracellular dsdna and can exert a strong inflammatory response15 , 16 .
in this study we investigated prothrombotic effects of dsdna in the vascular endothelium .
results double - stranded dna led to nuclear translocation of transcription factors irf3 and nf - kappab human microvascular endothelial cells ( hmec ) were treated with poly ( da : dt ) 5 microg / ml with or without complexation with cationic lipids ( lipofectamine 2000 ) for 6 hours and stained with dapi and anti - lamin - antibody .
only poly ( da : dt ) complexed with cationic lipids but not poly ( da : dt ) alone led to uptake of dsdna into the intracellular compartments ( representative images in fig. 1a ) .
transfection of endothelial cells with poly ( da : dt ) led to nuclear translocation of transcription factors irf3 and to a lesser extent of nf - kappab as shown by immunofluorescent staining ( representative images in fig. 1b and c ) .

we also observe significantly increased expression of the fibrinolytic molecule tissue plasminogen activator ( tpa ) after 6 hours of cell transfection with poly ( da : dt ) ( fig. 2c ) , while thrombomodulin ( thbd ) expression was slightly increased after 6 hours of transfection with poly ( da : dt ) after an initial decrease after 3 hours ( fig. 2d ) .

lysates of poly ( da : dt ) transfected endothelial cells accelerated blood clotting time compared to time - matched control cells ( fig. 3c , left ) .
stimulation of whole blood with lysates of endothelial cells treated with poly ( da : dt ) alone ( i.e. without cationic lipids ) had no effect on blood clotting time ( fig. 3c , right ) .
similar to cells transfected with the synthetic dsdna analogue poly ( da : dt ) , lysates of endothelial cells transfected with human genomic dna from peripheral human leukocytes also induced a significantly accelerated blood clotting compared to control cells after 12 hours ( fig. 3e ) .
the prothrombotic effect of poly ( da : dt ) after 12 hours was partly reversed after prior transfection of endothelial cells with sirna silencing rig - i receptor ( fig. 3d ) .
double stranded dna induces vwf upregulation and platelet tethering in vitro von willebrand factor ( vwf ) surface expression and platelet adhesion were analyzed in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvec ) .
transfection of endothelial cells with poly ( da : dt ) significantly increased surface expression of vwf after 12 hours as assessed by flow cytometry ( fig. 4a ) .
to investigate the functional relevance of this observation , interactions between endothelial cells and platelets were examined in a model of static adhesion .
therefore endothelial cells pre - treated with poly ( da : dt ) for 12 hours were then co - cultivated with freshly isolated platelets from healthy volunteers for 6 hours .
endothelial cells transfected with dsdna showed significantly increased numbers of adherent platelets as compared to non - stimulated cells ( fig. 4b ) .
in order to confirm our findings in a more physiological setting , we established a flow based assay of platelet endothelium interaction .
therefore freshly isolated human platelets were labeled with calcein and flushed over cultured endothelial cells in a flow chamber simulating a vascular shear stress of 1 dyn / cm2 and platelet - endothelial cell interactions were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy ( fig. 4c ) .
poly ( da : dt ) transfected endothelial cells showed significantly increased amount of tethering platelets compared to non stimulated cells ( fig. 4d ) .
additionally the number of very slow rolling platelets was higher on poly ( da : dt ) transfected endothelial cells , however ( considering the high number of overall transfused platelets ) the median velocity of platelets was not different in both groups ( fig. 4e ) .

double stranded dna accelerates microvascular thrombosis in vivo to investigate the effects of double stranded dna on thrombus formation in vivo , 10 mug poly ( da : dt ) complexed with 10 mul of lipofectamine or transfection reagent alone ( control group ) was injected into the scrotum of c57bl / 6 mice .
intravital microscopy of cremaster muscle vessels was performed 12 hours after injection and thrombus formation was induced by light / dye - injury after injection of fitc - labeled dextran .
vessel diameters did not differ significantly between both groups and were 53 +/ - 5 microm vs. 48 +/ - 6 microm in venules and 51 +/ - 9 microm vs. 50 +/ - 3 microm in arterioles control treated vs. dsdna treated animals respectively .
dsdna stimulation significantly accelerated thrombus formation in vivo resulting in a reduced time until onset of thrombus formation after injury in arterioles ( fig. 5c ) and eventually also in significantly reduced time until complete thrombotic vessel occlusion with flow cessation in both venules and arterioles ( fig. 5a and b , representative images in fig. 5e ) .
figure 5 double - stranded dna accelerates microvascular thrombosis in vivo .
thrombus formation in vivo was investigated by phototoxic ( light / dye - induced ) vessel injury of microvessels in the mouse cremaster muscle .
intrascrotal injection of poly ( da : dt ) ( 5 microg dna 12 hours prior to the experiment ) resulted in a more rapid onset of thrombus formation in arterioles ( a ) but not in venules ( c ) .
time to complete vessel occlusion was significantly accelerated after poly ( da : dt ) injection in both arterioles ( b ) and venules ( d ) .
( e ) representative images show thrombus formation in mouse cremaster arterioles ( 20 min after start of injury ) and mouse cremaster venules ( 10 min after start of injury ) with markedly increased thrombus formation in poly ( da : dt ) treated animals ( right pictures ) as compared to control animals ( left pictures ) .

hepatitis b virus dna - containing immunoprecipitates induce a prothrombotic phenotype to translate our findings into a clinical context we investigated whether hepatitis b virus dna induces prothrombotic effects in the vascular endothelium .
therefore we transfected microvascular endothelial cells with hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) - containing immunoprecipitates , that were collected during plasmapheresis from a patient with hbv - associated polyarteritis nodosa .
similar to transfection with the synthetic analogue poly ( da : dt ) hbv - containing immunoprecipitates exerted a prothrombotic phenotype in transfected endothelial cells resulting in upregulation of tissue factor already after 3 hours and upregulation of pai - 1 expression after 10 h as assessed by real - time pcr ( fig. 5a and b respectively , left images ) .
hbv - dna alone ( i.e. without cationic lipids ) had no effect on expression of tissue factor and pai - 1 expression compared to time - matched controls ( fig. 6a and b , respectively , right images ) .
figure 6 hepatitis b virus dna - containing immunoprecipitates induce a prothrombotic phenotype .
endothelial cells were transfected with hbv - dna containing immunoprecipitates isolated from a patient with ongoing hepatitis b infection and associated polyarteritis nodosa with a high viral load .
hbv - dna containing immunoprecipitates resulted in upregulation of tissue factor starting 3 hours after transfection ( a ) as well as pai - i at 10 hours after transfection ( b ) as analyzed by rt - pcr .
expression of tissue factor and pai - 1 after stimulation of endothelial cells with hbv - dna alone ( i.e. without cationic lipids ) is shown on the right (( a and b ) , respectively ) .

discussion in this study , we show direct prothrombotic effects of intracellular double stranded dna ( dsdna ) in the vascular endothelium .
dsdna led to upregulation of the procoagulatory proteins tissue factor and pai - 1 and increased surface expression of vwf and eventually resulted in accelerated blood clotting in vitro and thrombus formation in a model of endothelial injury in vivo .
similar effects were observed after transfection of endothelial cells with hepatitis b virus dna containing immunoprecipitates and with endogenous human dna .
in previous work we showed that dsdna , both from viral origin as well as endogenous dna , can induce pro - inflammatory effects in endothelial cells resulting in upregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as il - 6 , il - 8 , mcp - 1 , rantes , ip - 10 and ifn - beta , as well as the adhesion molecules icam - 1 and vcam - 1 on human endothelial cells15 .
furthermore , dsdna has been described to induce tnfalpha release from endothelial cells and thereby promoting leukocyte adhesion16 .
similar effects have also been observed in glomerular endothelial cells where dsdna functionally increased albumin permeability17 .
in this study we show intracellular dsdna leads to upregulation of tissue factor , a crucial protein in the activation of the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade18 .
tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade and contributes to thrombus growth and stabilization19 .
additionally , under certain pathophysiological conditions such as sickle cell disease or antiphospholipid syndrome tissue factor - positive endothelial microparticles have been observed , that can be recruited to the sites of vascular injury and contribute to increased thrombin generation20 , 21 .
physiologically resting endothelial cells express , if at all , very little amounts of tissue factor , however , the protein is upregulated under inflammatory conditions14 , 22 - 24 .
indeed , on a functional level we observed , that stimulation of endothelial cells with dsdna resulted in accelerated blood clot formation in an endothelial - dependent in vitro whole blood clotting assay , which has been shown to be , at least in part , tissue factor dependent25 .
dsdna furthermore induced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( pai - 1 ) , which is the major physiologic inhibitor of tissue - type plasminogen activator in plasma and thereby serves as an endogenous mechanism to prevent intravasal thrombosis26 .
pai - 1 levels are elevated in many diseases associated with increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events27 , 28 and have recently been shown to be relevant cardiovascular events in chronic hepatitis c infections29 .
interestingly , we also observed changes in antithrombotic molecules .
while thrombomodulin expression seems to be less influenced by intracellular dsdna , we observe an upregulation of the fibrinolytic molecule tpa at certain time points , indicating compensatory mechanisms .
however , in our functional experiments dsdna shows an overall prothrombotic effect , which could be explained by a relative stronger expression of the prothrombotic or antifibrinolytic molecules such as pai - 1 , a strong prothrombotic counterpart to tpa14 .
several molecular mechanisms seem to be involved in dsdna signaling in endothelial cells .
consistent with findings of previous studies in similar cells we found intracellular dsdna to induce nuclear translocation of the transcription factor irf3 and to lesser extent also nf - kappab16 .
these transcription factors can upregulate proinflammatory and prothrombotic genes .
the list of possible receptors being involved in the intracellular sensing of dsdna is long and further expanding4 - 6 .
several of these receptors including aim2 , dai , tlr9 or rig - i are expressed in endothelial cells and intracellular dsdna signaling is likely dependent on more than a single receptor and pathway30 .
in a previous study by our group we could see that upregulation of some inflammatory markers is dependent on tlr9 signaling15 .
considering the slighter prothrombotic effect of dsdna after transfection of endothelial cells with sirna and dsdna , it was partly reversed with sirna silencing rig - i receptor , indicating this receptor to be relevant for prothrombotic effects .
besides pro - coagulatory effects , dsdna in endothelial cells induced surface expression of von - willebrand - factor ( vwf ) which can bind gpib - receptor on platelets resulting in platelet - endothelium interactions .
indeed , platelet - endothelial cell - aggregates were significantly increased after prior stimulation of endothelial cells with dsdna .
moreover , transfection of primary human endothelial cells cultivated in flow chambers led to increased platelet tethering under dynamic conditions .
platelet - endothelial interactions via vwf - gpib or cd40 - cd40l , even when remaining transient , have been shown to further activate the endothelium and thereby increase inflammatory effects resulting in thrombosis but also acceleration in development of atherosclerotic lesions31 , 32 .
eventually , dsdna stimulation led to increased thrombus formation upon light / dye - induced endothelial injury in mouse cremaster vessels in vivo .
in this model the endothelium is not immediately disrupted , such as in the case of ferric chloride based injury models , but gradually exposed to increasing oxidative stress .
thus , in vitro observed effects of dsdna are likely to contribute to the prothrombotic effects .
however , additional effects including expression of other endothelial cell surface molecules , such as inflammatory adhesion molecules ( e.g. icam - 1 , vcam - 1 ) or p - selectin , but also redistribution or interplay between surface molecules may foster prothrombotic effects .
furthermore , other mechanisms such as modulation of endothelial mirna expression , e.g. mir - 126 might influence endothelial injury and consecutive vascular thrombosis33 .
while accelerated complete thrombotic vessel occlusion was consistent in arterioles and venules , the onset of thrombus formation was accelerated only in arterioles .
among the differences between mechanisms contributing to thrombosis in arterioles and venules lower shear rates as well as a considerable role of leukocytes in venules are the most important ones .
vwf is particularly important for platelet adhesion at higher shear rates , which could explain significant differences in the onset of thrombus formation in arterioles but not in venules .
notably we observed increased surface expression of vwf in vitro upon stimulation of dsdna which would support this hypothesis .
poly ( da : dt ) when transfected into cells mimics effects of viral dna and has been used as an analog for viral dna in previous studies by ourselves and others15 - 17 .
viral infections , such as hepatitis b are often associated with vasculitis and subsequently thromboembolic complications7 , 8 , 34 .
we therefore used immunoprecipitates isolated from a patient with ongoing hepatitis b infection and associated systemic vasculitis , to stimulate primary endothelial cells .
indeed , with regard to slight differences in the kinetics , we do see a similar upregulation of prothrombotic genes as compared with synthetic dsdna stimulation , suggesting a putative role of dsdna triggered endothelial activation in viral infections .
our observations could help to elucidate the so far incompletely understood relation between viral infections and atherothrombotic diseases .
apart from viral infections , dsdna can be released into the bloodstream from damaged host cells in the context autoimmune diseases , tumor lysis or formation of neutrophil extracellular traps ( nets ) .
we have previously shown that human genomic dsdna can enter the intracellular compartment of endothelial cells under certain circumstances and induce an inflammatory response15 .
in this study we demonstrate that transfection of cultured endothelial cells with human genomic dsdna accelerates blood clotting in vitro .
the induced phenotype is therefore similar to the one observed after poly ( da : dt ) treatment , however the extent of the prothrombotic effect observed was less pronounced as compared to stimulation with poly ( da : dt ) .
this prothrombotic phenotype might thereby contribute to thrombo - embolic complications in inflammatory autoimmune disorders that are well known to be associated with an increased risk of atherothrombotic events35 - 37 .
in conclusion we could show for the first time a direct pathophysiological role of viral as well as genomic intracellular dsdna in thrombosis and haemostasis by endothelial mediated mechanisms .
our results are in line with the growing evidence , that non - primary immune cells , such as endothelial cells , play an important role in the recognition and reaction to pathogen - and danger associated molecular patterns within the innate immune system .
ultimately , our findings represent a novel link in the increasingly recognized reciprocal connection between innate immunity and thrombotic disorders and therefore could be relevant for therapeutic decisions in patients with inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases .

platelet - endothelial cell - aggregates were measured by staining with anti - human cd41 - apc antibody and quantified by flow cytometry .
flow chamber assay endothelial cells were cultivated and stimulated as indicated in a micro - slide from ibidi ( martinsried , germany ) .
freshly isolated human platelets were labeled with calcein ( 10 microm for 30 min ) and perfused over the cultured endothelial cells at a shear rate of 1 dyn / cm2 .
live immune - fluorescence imaging was performed using a zeiss axiotech vario microscope ( carl zeiss , oberkochen , germany ) .
images were recorded with a digital camera ( axiocam hsm ; carl zeiss ). from the resulting length of the platelet trace in single images , velocities of single platelets were calculated by using the exposure time of each single picture .
platelet - endothelial cell - interaction was expressed by analysis of the amount of tethering platelets ( platelets not moving in at least one single picture ) as well as by analysis of frequency histograms consisting of all platelet velocities .
animals animal experiments were performed in wildtype c57bl / 6 mice , which were purchased from charles river ( sulzfeld , germany ) .
surgical procedures were performed under short - term anesthesia induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of midazolam 5 mg / kg ( ratiopharm , germany ) , fentanyl 0.05 mg / kg ( curamed pharma , germany ) , and medetomidinehydrochloride 0.5 mg / kg ( pfizer , germany ; produced by orion pharma , finland ) diluted in 0.9 % nacl .
all experiments were conducted in accordance with the german animal protection law and approved by the district government of upper bavaria .
the investigation conforms to the directive 2010 / 63 / eu of the european parliament .
intravital assessment of microvascular thrombosis microvascular thrombosis in vivo was investigated in arterioles and venules of the mouse cremaster muscle using a light / dye - injury model as previously described41 , 42 .
after anesthesia all surgical procedures were conducted on a thermo - controlled plexi - glass stage to maintain body temperature at 37 degreesc with cover slips for microscopy .
intravital fluorescence microscopy was performed using a modified microscope ( zeiss axiotech vario , carl zeiss microscopy gmbh , germany ) .
images were recorded with a digital camera ( axiocam hsm , carl zeiss germany ) and analyzed with " axiovision " ( carl zeiss microscopy gmbh , germany ) .
after the surgical preparation of the cremaster muscle 1 - 2 arterioles and 1 - 2 venules per cremaster with a diameter of around 50 mum were chosen and fitc - dextran ( average molecular weight 150,000 ( sigma - aldrich , germany )) in a concentration of 5 % in pbs was given in a dose of 1 mul / g mouse via a tail vein catheter .
light with a wave length of 450 - 490 nm was used to excite the fluorescent dye inducing photochemical injury of the endothelial cell layer .
two end points were defined , first the onset of thrombus formation and second the time until total cessation of blood flow ( occlusion time ) .
statistical analysis data were analyzed using student t - test to compare normally distributed variables and mann - whitney u test when normal distribution was not given .
all data are expressed as mean +/ - sem .
differences were considered significant when the error probability was p < 0.05 .

methods st samples were obtained by arthroscopy from the inflamed knee of 62 ra patients .
a second biopsy was obtained after a mean of 8 +/ - 5 months of treatment in 21 patients who started tnf blockers .
st samples were immunostained with cd3 ( t cell ) , cd20 ( b cell ) , and meca - 79 ( high endothelial vessels ) .
total st mrna was extracted and gene expression of ccr7 , lt - beta , il - 7 , il - 10 , il - 17a , il - 21 , il - 22 , il - 23 , tnf - alpha , il - 1b , and il - 6 was measured by quantitative real - time pcr .
clinical and biological data were collected at inclusion and after a median follow - up of 2.3 years .
results 28 out of 62 patients ( 45.2 %) had ln , which was associated with a significantly - higher expression of three key molecular markers of ln : ccr7 , il - 7 and lt - beta ( p < 0.037 , p < 0.038 , and p = 0.009 , respectively ) .
ln - positive patients also had higher il - 23 ( p = 0.035 ) and higher das28 score , both at inclusion and at the end of follow - up ( p = 0.055 and p = 0.037 , respectively ) .
in the group of patients with st before and after tnf blocker therapy , eular good response was associated with il - 10 reduction ( p = 0.035 ) .
in the entire group , eular response correlated with il - 1b expression ( p = 0.014 ) .
conclusion ra patients with ln were characterized by higher expression of key molecular markers of ln , il - 23 and higher disease activity .
a significant reduction in il - 10 expression after therapy with tnf - blockers was associated with good eular response .

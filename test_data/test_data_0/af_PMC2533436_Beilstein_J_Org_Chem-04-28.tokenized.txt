high yields of cycloadducts and significant asymmetric inductions up to 76 % ee are accessible .
the proposed mechanism involves proton transfer between anthrone and bisamidine , association of the resulting ions and finally a cycloaddition step stereoselectively controlled by the chiral ion pair .
asymmetric catalysis bisamidines bronsted base diels - alder reaction organocatalysis introduction the cycloadditions of anthrones 1 and n - substituted maleimides 2 are prominent examples of asymmetric catalysis exerted by chiral bronsted bases .
moderate to excellent stereoselectivities of products 3 have been reported using pyrrolidines 4 [ 1 - 2 ] , cyclic guanidine 5 [ 3 ] , or cinchona alkaloids 6 [ 4 ] as catalysts .
recently , we could promote this type of cycloaddition by metal - free bisoxazolines 7 in up to 70 % ee , in spite of their limited bronsted - basicity [ 5 ] ( scheme 1 ) .
scheme 1 diels - alder reaction of anthrones 1 and maleimides 2 catalyzed by chiral bronsted bases 4 - 8 .
our study was motivated by the structural similarity of bisoxazolines 7 and bisamidines 8 .
bisamidines 8 , readily accessible from malonodinitrile in two steps , prefer the conjugated tautomeric form ( enamine - imine ) in the monoprotonated state , which is characterised by an almost planar structure [ 6 ] ( scheme 2 ) .
scheme 2 protonation states and tautomerism of c 2 - symmetric bisamidine 8a [ 6 ] .
the aqueous pk a of 8.h + is approximately 11 , sufficient to allow deprotonation of anthrones 1 ( pk a around 10 , [ 7 - 8 ]) by bisamidines to a significant extent .
here we report on the use of neutral bisamidines 8 as asymmetric bronsted base catalysts in the cycloaddition of anthrones 1 and maleimides 2 .
results and discussion analogous to the synthesis of compound 8a [ 6 ] , the other bisamidines were prepared as hydrochlorides in 60 - 79 % yield from the corresponding chiral diamines 9 and bisimidate 10 in refluxing ethanol .
simple extraction in the presence of na2co3 afforded the neutral bases 8b - c and ent - 8d in almost quantitative yield .
the s,s configurated diamines 9b and 9c were prepared from l - (+) - tartaric acid ( r,r ) via the vicinal diazide using saalfrank 's procedure [ 9 ] .
9d was purchased as the dihydrochloride salt and then deprotonated by aqueous sodium hydroxide .
as an " artefact " of the sequence rule , the s,s configurated diamine 9d leads to bisamidine ent - 8d ( scheme 3 ) .
scheme 3 synthesis of c 2 - symmetric bisamidines 8b - c and ent - 8d .
the anthrones 1b ( r1 : h ; r2 : cl ) and 1c ( r1 : cl ; r2 : h ) resulted from regioselective reductions of 1,8 - dichloroanthraquinone [ 10 - 11 ] .
aliphatic side chains of compounds 2 could be introduced by a mitsunobu alkylation of maleimide [ 12 ] .
alternatively , substituted maleimides were prepared by reaction of maleic anhydride with the corresponding amines followed by ring closure [ 13 - 14 ] .
cycloaddition kinetics of 1a and 2a was examined first by 1h nmr in cd2cl2 at room temperature .
in the absence of catalyst , no product could be observed after 4 days .
5 mol % of the bisamidinium salt 8a.h + with tetrakis ( 3,5 - bis ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ) borate ( tfpb - ) as weakly coordinating anion resulted in 7 % yield of 3a after 4 h. in contrast , only 1 mol % of the free bronsted base 8a led to a high rate increase in the first 30 min .
after 90 min no further conversion was observed indicating product inhibition ( fig. 1 ) .
accordingly , the reaction runs best in the base - catalyzed mode .
compared to the bisoxazolines 7 , bisamidines 8 as stronger bronsted bases induced much higher rates in all subsequent experiments .
figure 1 kinetic measurements of 1a with 2a catalyzed by 5 mol % of 8a.h +. tfpb - ( black line ) and 1 mol % 8a ( free base ; red line ) .
in the next series of experiments , bisamidines 8a - c and ent - 8d were compared as catalysts of the cycloaddition forming 3a from n - phenylmaleimide ( 2a ) and anthrone ( 1a ) .
using 0.25 equiv of catalyst at room temperature , isolated yields between 71 % and 86 % were obtained after 30 min .
the best enantioselectivity , albeit low , was induced by amidine 8c ( 24 % ee ) .
as expected , in the presence of catalyst ent - 8d product ent - 3a was formed preferentially ( table 1 ) .

in a solvent screening using 10 mol % of tbdps - protected bisamidine 8c , best results were obtained in dichloromethane ( 84 % yield ; 30 % ee ) .
even higher yields were accessible in aromatic solvents , however , at the price of reduced stereoselectivity ( table 2 ) .

lowering the reaction temperature from 23 to - 20 degreesc ( 8c , dichloromethane ) retarded the cycloaddition but did not change enantioselectivities .
after extended reaction times , excellent yields were still observed .
up to 39 % ee was finally obtained at - 70 degreesc .
however , such conditions resulted in lower yields , even with increased catalyst loads and further extended reaction times .
best results , 96 % yield and 36 % ee with only 10 mol % of catalyst , were found at - 40 degreesc ( table 3 ) .

having identified suitable experimental conditions , we explored the scope of the bisamidine - catalyzed diels - alder reaction .
the results are summarized in table 4 .
both electron - donating and electron - withdrawing substituents were tolerated and furnished products in good to excellent yields and with moderate values of ee. a remarkable increase in enantioselectivity was observed using maleimide 2i .
the steric hindrance imposed by the large 2,6 - diisopropylphenyl moiety of 2i resulted in 76 % ee at - 70 degreesc but also lowered reaction rates .

only 13 % yield could be obtained under such conditions .
yields rose to 65 % at room temperature ( 51 % ee ; entries 11 and 12 ). with other sterically hindered dienophiles such as n - tert - butylmaleimide ( 2c ) , the level of ee remained low ( entry 4 ) .
the halogen - substituted anthrones 1b - c did not react with 2i at - 70 degreesc .
at room temperature , however , 1b and 2i were efficiently transformed into 3m by catalyst 8a with 76 % yield and 54 % ee. a single recrystallisation step afforded an almost enantiopure product ( 96 % ee ) .
the r,r configuration of compound 3m was determined by anomalous x - ray diffraction using a single crystal of 3m with 96 % ee ( fig. 2 ) .
figure 2 molecular structure of 3m ( c : black ; n : blue ; o : red ; cl : green ; hydrogen atoms are omitted for the sake of clarity ) .
a mechanistic rationalisation is proposed in scheme 4 .
the catalyst deprotonates the anthrone in the initial step .
this assumption is supported by the pk a values of compounds 2a ( 10 , [ 7 - 8 ]) and 8.h + (~ 11 , [ 6 ]) .
furthermore , the appearance of the yellow color of enolates ( 1.h +) shows significant proton transfer when bisamidine 8a is added to anthrones 1a , 1b , or 1c .
a chiral contact ion pair a is formed and controls the stereochemical course of the diels - alder reaction with maleimides .
in the last step , the catalyst - product - complex b dissociates and regenerates the unprotonated bisamidine .
scheme 4 proposed mechanism of the diels - alder reaction .
conclusion c 2 - symmetric bisamidines were shown to be potent chiral bronsted base catalysts for the diels - alder reaction of n - substituted maleimides and anthrones .
compared to bisoxazolines 7 , much shorter reaction times under comparable conditions were sufficient with the more basic bisamidine catalysts 8 (~ 50 - fold [ 5 ]) .
the higher intrinsic reactivity of the bisamidines allowed to run the reactions at lower temperatures .
in both groups of catalysts , the phenyl substituted species induced the lowest enantioselectivities .
bisamidine 8a performed better than the corresponding bisoxazoline .
increasing the size of substituents in catalysts 8b - d also improved stereoselectivities , but not to high levels .
this may be due to the flexible nature of the substituents present in bisamidines 8b and 8c .
it is instructive , therefore , to compare with the bisoxazolines 7. by far the best enantioselectivities were observed in this series with the t - bu derivative ( 47 % ee versus 3 % for the phenyl analogue in the reaction of 1a and 2a ) .
keeping in mind that even the less selective bisamidine 8a could induce up to 76 % ee in favorable cases , replacing the phenyl moieties of 8a by t - bu is an attractive option for future studies on bisamidine - mediated organocatalytic transformations .

background regional cerebral oxygen saturation ( rso2 ) monitoring by near - infrared spectroscopy provides valuable information regarding cerebral oxygen delivery , and it has been increasingly used in cardiovascular surgery .
although it has been shown that dialysis - dependent patients [ hemodialysis ( hd ) patients ] suffer from low cerebral perfusion , limited information is available on cerebral tissue oxygenation levels in hd patients .
findings in this retrospective study , the preoperative rso2 values in 9 hd patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were compared with those in 40 non - hd patients .
hd patients had lower preoperative rso2 values than non - hd patients ( median : 46 vs. 68 % , respectively , p < 0.001 ) .
despite adjusting for age , hemoglobin concentration , and left ventricular ejection fraction using multivariable linear regression , hd showed a strong association with low rso2 ( estimated coefficient : - 20.4 , p < 0.001 ) .
conclusions hd showed a strong association with low preoperative rso2 values in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery , even after adjusting for known factors that affect rso2 values , including age , hemoglobin concentration , and cardiac systolic function .
further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms decreasing rso2 values in hd patients .
keywords hemodialysis regional cerebral oxygen saturation cardiac surgery http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100001691japan society for the promotion of science16k20092 mizota toshiyuki issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 findings introduction regional cerebral oxygen saturation ( rso2 ) monitoring by near - infrared spectroscopy has been increasingly used to assess the adequacy of cerebral oxygen delivery in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery [ 1 , 2 ] .
previous studies have shown that rso2 , measured by near - infrared spectroscopy , is affected by several factors , including age , hemoglobin concentration , and cardiac function [ 3 - 7 ] .
it has been shown that end - stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis ( hd ) suffer from low cerebral perfusion , which may contribute to cognitive deficits and high stroke prevalence observed in dialysis - dependent patients ( hd patients ) [ 8 ] .
however , limited information is currently available on cerebral tissue oxygenation levels in hd patients .
here , we hypothesized that the preoperative rso2 values in hd patients undergoing cardiac surgery is lower than those in non - hd patients , reflecting low cerebral blood flow .
the current study was designed to compare the preoperative rso2 values in hd patients and non - hd patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) .
methods our study was approved by the ethics committee of kyoto university ( approval number : r0719 ) , and the requirement for written informed consent was waived .
we included adult (>= 20 years of age ) patients who underwent isolated cabg at kyoto university hospital between january 1 , 2012 and december 31 , 2015 .
patients who concurrently underwent cardiac valvular or aortic surgery were excluded .
patients without available rso2 values taken before administration of oxygen or anesthetic drugs were also excluded .
specific data from the electronic medical records of participants , including age , gender , body mass index , comorbidities , and preoperative examination findings , were retrospectively collected .
left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) was derived from preoperative transthoracic echocardiography records .
for hemoglobin concentration values , the most recent value measured before the surgery was used .
patients received no premedication .
upon entering the operating room , preoperative rso2 and arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry ( spo2 ) were obtained before administration of oxygen or anesthetic drugs .
rso2 values were detected using the invos 5100 system ( somanetics , troy , mi ) with probes containing light sources , each providing two continuous wavelengths of near - infrared light ( 730 and 810 nm ) that reach a brain area corresponding to the junction between the anterior and middle cerebral artery vascularization territory .
two probes were attached to the right and the left sides of the forehead ; the preoperative rso2 values were defined as the mean of rso2 values obtained from these two probes .
data were analyzed using the statistical program r ( http :// cran.r - project.org ) .
continuous data are presented as median ( interquartile range ) , and categorical variables are expressed as a number ( percentage ) .
differences between groups were compared using the mann - whitney u test for continuous variables .
for categorical variables , pearson 's chi - square or fisher 's exact tests were used as appropriate .
because it has been shown that rso2 is affected by age , hemoglobin concentration , and cardiac function [ 3 - 7 ] , we used multivariable linear regression analysis to assess the independent impact of hd on rso2 values after adjustment for these factors .
we constructed a linear regression model with rso2 as a dependent variable and hd status , age , hemoglobin concentration , and lvef as independent variables , and beta coefficients were calculated for all independent variables .
all statistical tests were two - tailed , and the statistical significance was set at a p value of < 0.05 .
results a total of 80 patients underwent isolated cabg during the study period. of these , 31 patients were excluded because of the lack of rso2 measurements before administration of oxygen or anesthetic drugs ; the remaining 49 patients were included in the analysis .
among these 49 patients , 9 patients ( 18.4 %) received hd preoperatively .
duration of hd in hd patients ranged from 2 to 14 years ; 4 patients ( 44.4 %) underwent hd for >= 10 years .
patient characteristics stratified by hd status are presented in table 1 .
hd patients had significantly higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and arteriosclerosis obliterans and significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations than non - hd patients .
although it did not reach statistical significance , lvef in hd patients tended to be lower than that in non - hd patients .

no patients had an rso2 value of <= 50 % in the non - hd group , whereas 7 out of 9 hd patients ( 77.8 %) had an rso2 value of <= 50 % .
spo2 values of study participants ranged from 94 - 100 % and were comparable between groups ( p = 0.625 ; fig. 1b ). fig. 1 box plots of preoperative rso2 ( a ) and spo2 ( b ) values stratified by hd. horizontal bold lines represent median values .

hd maintained a strong association with low rso2 , even after adjusting for age , hemoglobin concentration , and lvef .
the estimated coefficient for hd in the multivariable model was - 20.4 ( 95 % confidence interval : - 26.3 to - 14.4 ) ( table 2 ) .

several reports have suggested that patients undergoing hd have low rso2 values , reflecting low cerebral perfusion [ 9 , 10 ] ; however , they did not assess cardiac function , which is known to affect rso2 values [ 7 ] .
in our study , we were able to compare rso2 values in hd and non - hd patients after adjusting for lvef because most patients underwent preoperative transthoracic echocardiography .
although hd patients had significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations than non - hd patients , and lvef in hd patients tended to be lower , the estimated coefficient for hd in the multivariable linear regression analysis , adjusting for age , hemoglobin concentration , and lvef , was - 20.4 .
this means that hd patients had 20.4 % lower rso2 values than non - hd patients after adjusting for these factors , indicating that low rso2 values in hd patients are , at least in part , because of factors other than age , anemia , or cardiac systolic function .
although it is not possible to determine the specific cause of low rso2 values in hd patients in our study , possible explanations are as follows : ( 1 ) metabolic acidosis frequently seen in hd patients decreases affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen [ 11 ] and decreases microcirculatory oxygen saturation .
( 2 ) the acute intravascular volume loss and fluid shifts that occur during dialysis induce cerebral edema and decrease intracerebral blood pressure , blood velocity , and cerebral perfusion [ 12 ] .
( 3 ) cerebral atrophy seen in hd patients [ 13 ] might increase the thickness of the cerebrospinal fluid layer , which decreases the intensity of near - infrared light that the detector can receive , thereby , decreasing rso2 values [ 5 ] .
further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms by which the rso2 values are decreased in hd patients .
it is important to determine adequate target values of rso2 to guide intraoperative management in hd patients .
rso2 monitoring may be used to guide hemodynamics and cpb management during cardiac surgery by adjusting therapy based on relative changes from the preoperative baseline ( i.e. , to maintain relative rso2 > 80 % of baseline ) [ 14 ] .
however , this concept might allow too low rso2 values and be harmful for majority of hd patients , who frequently have abnormally low baseline rso2 values .
future research should be conducted to establish the appropriate target value of rso2 in hd patients .
this study had certain limitations , primarily based on its retrospective design .
we used only preoperative lvef to evaluate cardiac function because data on diastolic function or cardiac output were not available in most patients .
in addition , we could not adjust for the influence of some factors , which are suggested to be related to rso2 , including partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood , central venous pressure , skull thickness , and area of cerebrospinal fluid layer [ 4 , 5 ] .
the number of patients was small ; however , it was still sufficient to support our hypothesis .
conclusions in conclusion , this study demonstrated that hd showed strong associations with low preoperative rso2 values in patients undergoing cabg , even after adjusting for known factors that affect rso2 values , including age , hemoglobin concentration , and cardiac systolic function .

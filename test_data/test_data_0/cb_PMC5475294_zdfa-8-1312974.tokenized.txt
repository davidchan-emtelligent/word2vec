abstract background : this study attempted to determine the disease burden in terms of clinical profile and outcome of diabetic foot ulcer ( dfu ) admissions at a tertiary care hospital in a developing country .
methods : in this descriptive study , the data were collected from the medical record of diabetic patients with foot ulcer who were treated in dr. kariadi general hospital during a 3 - year period .
the demographic characteristic , type of foot lesion , etiology , isolated microorganism , treatment , and outcome were reviewed .
results : foot problems accounted for 16.2 % of total diabetic admission ( n = 1429 ) .
all patients had type 2 diabetes with no gender predominance .
the mean age was 54.3 +/ - 8.6 years and diabetes control was very poor .
before admission , the ulcers had already developed for 4.7 +/ - 2.9 weeks ; however , the majority of patients were unaware of the preceding causes .
ulcers were neuropathic in 42.2 % of cases , neuroischemic in 29.9 % , and pure ischemic at lesser percentage .
more than 70 % of ulcers were in wagner grade >= 3 with infection event in nearly all patients .
the most common isolates from culture were gram - negative bacteria .
a total of 98 ( 36.3 %) lower extremity amputations ( leas ) at various level of the foot were carried out , including major lea in 24 patients and multiple amputations in seven patients .
mortality rate due to dfu reached 10.7 % .
conclusions : diabetic foot problems constitute a source of morbidity , a reason for lea surgery as well as being a cause of death among patients with diabetes mellitus .

introduction diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases : in 2010 , one study reported that 285 million adults worldwide had diabetes and this figure is projected to rise to 439 milion by the year 2030 [ 1 ] .
such a profound demographic shift is likely to yield a corresponding increase in the prevalence of diabetes chronic complications , including those in the lower extremity , the diabetic foot [ 2 ] .
it is estimated that the annual population - based incidence of a diabetic foot ulcer ( dfu ) ranges from 1.0 % to 4.1 % .
the lifetime incidence may be as high as 25 % [ 3 ] .
despite the efforts of conservative therapy , there will always be a percentage of ulcers that necessitate hospitalization .
these cases may require surgical debridement , resection of distal osseus and soft tissue structure , endovascular intervention , daily dressings , strict glycemic control , and intravenous antibiotic therapy for eradication of infection [ 4,5 ] .
foot problems in diabetics can frequently be life or limb threatening , yet have not received the same level of attention as other diabetes complications [ 6 ] .
until today , descriptive data regarding demographical and clinical factors in foot ulcers among diabetic patients in indonesia are relatively few though we are all aware of its clinical importance [ 7,8 ] .
in the current study , we attempt ( 1 ) to record the clinical profile and outcome of diabetic foot hospitalization , and ( 2 ) to provide a report which may become a reference for further improvement in diabetic foot management in our center , in semarang city , indonesia .
methods research design this study is a retrospective study reviewing the medical records of diabetic patients who were admitted to the dr. kariadi general hospital with foot problems. dr. kariadi general hospital is a provincial hospital , which is also the central referral in central java and main teaching hospital of the medical faculty of diponegoro university .
patients with various diabetic complications are referred to this hospital .
the study was conducted over a period of 3 years between january 2012 and december 2014 of which the studied population have already been referred to our previous publication [ 9 ] .
sampling technique was non - probability with total sampling [ 10 ] .
prior to the commencement of the study , ethical clearance was obtained from the hospital authority ( number : 269 / ec / fk - rsdk / 2015 ) .
treatment settings dfu is a general term used to designate lesions that occur in a diabetic patient 's foot , an anatomical area below the malleoli [ 9 ] .
we hospitalized dfu patients with progressive infection , those with septicemia , gangrenous tissue requiring amputation , need of complex wound care , or when intercurrent disease necessitate it. endocrinologist or surgeon will take a lead as a physician in charge and treat the patients in close proximity ; the strategies were aimed at optimizing the limb salvage rate and healing time by combining first - line medical treatment , revascularization if needed , surgical management , and second - line limited lower extremity amputation ( lea ) surgery .
though the largest in - hospital service in central java province , our center is not considered a diabetic foot specialty center , which we are currently working on becoming .
on admission , immediate measures were taken for the control of hyperglycemia with insulin .
all patients were advised for bed rest or with crutches for pressure relief of ulcers , and casts were only available in few patients who can afford it. antibiotic was instituted when there were clinical signs of infection .
those with a superficial skin ulcer were treated conservatively by local care ( debridement , dressing ) while abscess collection was incised and drained .
all infected lesions were debrided promptly .
multiple debridement were occasionally required to control infection .
osteomyelitis without peripheral arterial disease ( pad ) was treated by limited bone resection .
when severe pad was present , revascularization was done after angiography as soon as patient 's general condition was improved by the medical treatment .
gangrene was treated by amputations at various levels .
life - threatening conditions with severely infected ischemic limbs were also indication for lea .
data collection and procedure we are greatly helped by the dr. kariadi general hospital 's database to provide the medical records number and 10th international classification of disease ( icd - 10 ) diagnosis .
a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was defined as at least one record of icd - 10 code e10 for type 1 and e11 for type 2 diabetes .
diabetic foot problems were confirmed by one of the following physician 's handwritten diagnosis as : ' diabetic foot ' , ' diabetic foot ulcers ' , ' diabetic foot infections ' , or ' diabetic foot gangrene ' .
a structured questionnaire was designed and constructed in sections to collect different aspects of the following information : ( 1 ) demographic data , ( 2 ) diabetes history , ( 3 ) laboratory results , ( 4 ) diabetic foot investigation for ulcer severity , the presence of infection , peripheral neuropathy and pad , ( 5 ) microbiological profile , ( 6 ) treatment , and ( 7 ) observed outcomes including the specific levels of lea , length of stay , and in - hospital mortality .
multiple entries , as detected by their hospital numbers , were treated as separates outcomes as they may have represented new events though occurring in the same patients .
the initial random blood glucose ( rbg ) , fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) , and glycosylated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) following admission were recorded .
the results of hba1c was stratified in percentage graded as per our national guidelines [ 11 ] : hba1c < 7 % , good glycemic control ; hba1c 7 - 7.9 % , fair control ; hba1c 8 - 9.9 % , poor control ; hba1c >= 10 % , very poor control .
specimens of the foot lesions , after decontamination and debridement followed by curettage , were collected for gram stain , aerobic and anaerobic culture , and for antimicrobial susceptibility testing .
radiographs were taken from the affected foot ( s ) to discover bone abnormalities .
osteomyelitis was determined by radiological examination .
the staging of the ulcers was also reviewed and only the wagner system [ 12 ] was used in this study as this method is the most commonly used in our center .
details of current and past foot disease were recorded , giving attention to the presence of pad and peripheral neuropathy .
pad was diagnosed as ankle brachial index ( abi ) < 0.9 in either leg using a bidirectional handheld doppler ultrasound instrument ( huntleigh diagnostics , cardiff , uk ) .
peripheral neuropathy was defined as reduced vibration ( by 128 hz tunning fork ) or light touch perception evaluated using a 10 g semmes - weinstein monofilament ( huntleigh diagnostics , cardiff , uk ) , as previously described elsewhere [ 9 ] .
using the clinical information obtained , the type of foot lesion was determined and classified as neuropathic , ischemic , neuroischemic , or unclassified .
patient management and outcomes patients were evaluated and managed according to wagner classification , considering the severity of infection and the presence of pad at the time of presentation .
length of hospital stay was calculated from admission to discharge date .
patient outcomes were classified as : conservative management with significant wound improvement ( incorporating strict bed rest , intravenous antibiotics , and inpatient podiatric assessment and treatment ) ; dressing with or without skin grafting ; angioplasty or bypass procedure ; operative procedure : surgical debridement and / or incision drainage followed by wound care , with or without skin grafting ; osteotomy ; minor lea : forefoot amputation ( digital disarticulation , ray amputation ) , midfoot amputation ( transmetatarsal , lisfranc 's , chopart 's ) , hindfoot amputation ( syme 's ) ; and major lea : transtibial amputation and transfemoral amputation ; death in hospital during the episode associated with their diabetic foot complication .
postoperatively , most patients needed repeated dressing changes and wound toilet .
patients were discharged on the basis of good clinical evidence of wound healing with the elimination of sepsis and necrotic tissue .
post - discharge care ensured adequate off - loading and domiciliary support with regular out - patient clinic attendance .
statistical analysis after the medical records within the predetermined period have been reviewed thoroughly , the collected data was first checked manually for its completeness .
our method was to include all of the available data to describe the population characteristics [ 13 ] .
incomplete data were deleted , however , throughout the records were kept to provide an epidemiological information such as demographic data , microbiological study , level of amputation , and mortality rate .
patients with case records reporting a declined amputation ( n = 9 ) were not included in the analysis .
the data was summarized and then presented in the form of diagrams , tables , and bar charts as appropriate .
data were analyzed using the statistical package for social science software [ ibm version 21.0 ; spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ] .
results there were 232 admissions with diabetic foot problems involving 189 patients ; these concerned 96 males and 93 females .
some patients ( n = 27 ) were admitted to the hospital more than once for a new lesion .
diabetic foot complications accounted for 16.2 % of diabetic admission ( n = 1429 ) and 3.0 % of the total inpatient population ( n = 7688 ) during the 3 - year period .
the reason for admission included uncontrolled foot infection ( 69.3 %) , cardiovascular events ( 9.3 %) , hyperglycemic emergencies ( 5.1 %) , worsening renal function ( 3.2 %) , acute critical limb ischemia ( 2.8 %) , hypoglycemic event ( 2.8 %) , and others ( 7.5 %) .
the majority of patients were admitted through the emergency department , while only 11 patients were admitted through outpatient clinic .
clinical characteristics of patients table 1 summarizes the demographic and clinical features of patients ( n = 130 ) .
the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus with the age range between 34 and 79 years .
the average duration of diabetes was 6.4 years .
none of these patients classified as having type 1 diabetes .
the mean hba1c at the time of admission was 11.3 +/ - 2.8 % .
sixteen patients ( 12.3 %) were newly diagnosed with diabetes .
out of 130 patients , 35.4 % of patients developed recurrence of foot ulcers either at the same site or at a different site and had to be hospitalized again .
common precipitating events of ulcers , which are shown in figure 1 , include minor trauma , walking barefoot , spontaneous blisters , and ill - fitting shoes .
it was found that 23.7 % of patients could not remember the initiating events of the wound .
in this study , 154 ( 71.5 %) patients were in high grade wagner , i.e. wagner grade >= 3 ( table 2 ) .
foot ulcers in 76 patients were pure neuropathic , 19 patients had ischemic - type , while 53 had neuro - ischemic origin .
infection was present invariably in nearly all patients , except four cases with dry gangrene .
among 132 cases with x - ray report of the affected foot , 46 ( 34.8 %) had osteomyelitis .
in its most severe form , 13 % patients presented with septicemia .

bacteriologic pattern a total of 154 specimens were cultured which yielded 114 positive cultures ( 74 %) .
nineteen samples were polymicrobial infection with a total 138 isolates recovered that included 133 bacterial and five fungal organisms .
among the positive - cultured specimen , gram - negative bacilli constituted the majority ( 70.8 %) and escherichia coli was found to be the most common isolates .
anaerobic microorganisms constituted to 4.3 % of the total isolates .
the most commonly isolated anaerobe was peptostreptococcus spp. ; however , the exact proportion of anaerobes microorganisms may be an underreporting .
surgical management and lower extremity amputation management strategies for the patients stratified by wagner classification are shown in table 3 .
the most common surgical procedures were debridement and abscess incision and drainage as majority of ulcers were in wagner grade 3 and grade 4 .
patients with only soft tissue wounds ( 6.9 %) were treated by means of local wound care and off - loading measures without requirement of a trip to the operating room .
arterial bypass surgery , specifically femoro - popliteal bypass , was performed in two cases .
primary angioplasty was performed in seven cases (< 10 % of patients with pad ) with almost half requiring removal of one or more digits .
the overall amputation rate was 36.3 % ( n = 98 ) and specific level of procedures are depicted in figure 2 .
multiple lea ( patients requiring further amputation due to progressions of the disease , such an initial digital and later requiring trans - metatarsal or major amputation ) were performed in seven patients .
minor lea was performed in 74 cases , wherein 67.2 % of all amputations were performed at toe level .
major lea was the outcome for 24 patients with four ( 4.1 %) undergoing above - knee and 20 ( 20.4 %) below - knee amputation .

there were 23 deaths among the study sample making the mortality rate of 10.7 % and sepsis was the main cause ( 59 %) .
those who expired , 10 patients had wagner grade 3 , 11 patients with grade 4 , and the remaining are in grade 5 ulcer .
surgical intervention was made only in 14 patients and was not possible in the rest due to their general condition being unfit for surgery .
in this report , 13 patients ( 6.0 %) took discharge against medical advice due to variable reasons such as financial constrain , undue delays while awaiting surgical procedure , and refusal of treatment offered , including amputation .
discussion abbott et al .
[ 14 ] reported that more than 2 % of diabetic patients will develop new foot ulcers annually .
the prevalence of dfu varied between 4 % and 20.4 % among hospital - based studies in individuals with diabetes [ 15,16 ] .
according to some authorities [ 17,18 ] , diabetic foot problems are responsible for 23 - 50 % of the hospital bed occupancies by diabetic patients .
our study documented a 16.2 % prevalence rate of dfu among consecutive , unselected diabetic patients admitted to the largest medical inpatients service in semarang , indonesia .
these patients have a significant risk of poor - healing ulcers , foot infection , and lea , which is reportedly more frequent among low socioeconomic group patients with precarious hygiene conditions [ 19 ] .
in our study , the proportions of both sexes were relatively comparable as well as middle - aged ( mean age 54.3 years ) .
due to lack of education on nature of illness , they presented to the hospital after 4 weeks after the ulcers had developed .
in a study by lavery et al .
[ 20 ] , duration of ulcers > 30 days was a factor related to development of a wound infection .
in our report , infection was present invariably in nearly all patients and gram - negative bacteria were the most commonly isolated .
peptostreptococcus spp. was the most predominant anaerobic isolates , which is in accordance to the previous bacteriologic study from singapore [ 21 ] or other tertiary care hospital in india [ 22 ] .
boyko et al .
[ 23 ] in the seattle diabetic foot study found the mean duration of diabetes to be 13.2 years compared to 6.4 years in this study .
furthermore , some patients ( 12.3 %) in our study have undiagnosed diabetes when they presented with foot complications. with regards to diabetes control , 81 % of patients had poor glycemic control , i.e. hba1c > 8 % .
for a variety of reasons , good glucose control is not easily obtained in many indonesian patients [ 24 ] ; poor drug compliance , lack of financial resources , and poor access to medical facilities may all compound this problem .
overall mean hba1c in this study was 11.2 % , higher than what hartemann - heutier et al .
[ 25 ] and ozkara et al .
[ 26 ] have shown ( mean hba1c 8.7 % and 10.3 % , respectively ) .
thewjitcharoen et al .
[ 27 ] found that approximately 56.8 % of dfu patients had neuropathy only and another 29.3 % had neuroischemic ulcers ( 42.9 % and 29.9 % , respectively , in our study ). of note , pure ischemic ulcers usually present in lower percentage ( 10.7 % in our study ) .
a quarter of our patients were unaware of the cause of the ulcers .
perhaps the co - existence of neuropathy , lack of foot care is the main cause of the tendency for progression of their lesions before presentation .
other studies quote inadequate footwear [ 14,16 ] or spontaneous blisters [ 27,28 ] as the most common cause of foot ulceration .
it is known that a previous dfu history increases the risk of further lesions [ 14 ] , and carries a similar risk of lea to those for first ulceration [ 29 ] .
recurrence of foot ulceration in 35.4 % of patients showed that they require more personal education regarding foot care .
this finding is very important as foot ulceration is a preventable entity in many cases with adequate education , routine foot care and attention to foot wear [ 19,30 ] .
another component to ulcer recurrences include prior partial foot amputation [ 30 ] .
even partial amputation of the great toe contributes to the development of foot deformities that increased the risk of re - ulceration [ 31 ] .
the authors found that the most common level of lea in this study was at the level of the toes ( 67.2 %) .
high prices of customized footwear and the unavailability of offloading devices may provide an important factor for the high recurrence rate of dfu in our studied population .
new techniques of tendon balancing have been shown to speed healing of ulcers , decrease ulcer recurrence and lea .
this approach could be incorporated as part of initial treatment of foot ulcers in the future [ 32 ] .
the rate of lea in our study was 36.3 % , excluding those who refused amputation and discharged home .
although not all indonesian studies [ 6,7 ] have been designed to evaluate lea rates , the rates from these various studies range from 23 to 39.5 % , that seems similar to our finding .
in the netherlands [ 33 ] and england [ 34 ] , the amputation rates were found to be lower at 15.5 % and 16.0 % , respectively , related to better preventative measures and standard of care in europe .
as can be seen from table 2 , patients classified as wagner grade 3 , 4 , and 5 disease accounted for a total 71.5 % of cases .
this reflects that most of our patients had late presentation with deep ulcer , osteomyelitis , and frank gangrene of the foot .
although individual surgeon practice may affect the decision to amputation , many studies have reported the association between higher wagner grade with more extensive surgical intervention [ 9,35 ] .
the mortality was also relatively high in this study ( 10.7 %) .
the reason can be explained by the fact that some of the patients were admitted with advanced dfu and sepsis , leading to multiple organ failure and death .
the actual figure of lea incidence and mortality rate in this study could be higher in those who refused surgery or self - discharged from hospital .
it was observed that the mean duration of hospital stay for diabetic foot problem was 17.8 days , comparable with ozkara et al. ' s [ 26 ] report of an average of 17.2 days .
in studies from england [ 36 ] , tanzania [ 37 ] , and nigeria [ 28 ] , the mean duration of hospital stay was 22.2 , 36.2 days , and 60.3 days , respectively .
the variation from study to study might be related to differences in clinical practice , severity of illness , and availability of supportive care in their hospital .
however , the relatively lower duration of hospitalization in the present study may be a result of death at early date or discharge from the hospital .
meanwhile , our rate is longer than the reported rate for patients who routinely examined and attend outpatient diabetic foot service ( mean length of stay of only 7.1 days ) when hospitalization is required [ 38 ] .
this is a persuasive argument for the provision of diabetic foot care at a very early stage to reduce both the necessity and length of hospital admission and also improve patient 's outcome .
our previous study [ 9 ] reported that the presence of pad was found to be a major predictive factor for poor outcome after dfu admission .
in low income countries , scarce resources may limit the best care , as we know that most hospitals are not even equipped for vascular intervention .
but even in the technologically advanced center as dr. kariadi general hospital , management is often lacking or delayed .
distal revascularization procedures were not performed in some of our patients because they have not been considered suitable by the vascular surgeon .
the reason varies from severely ill patients , short life expectancy , severe nephropathy , and extensive tissue destruction .
indeed there are patients who are suitable but resist treatment because of financial issue or just simply fear of operating room .
the famous maxim told that prevention is better than cure can be applicable : identification of high risk foot with simple equipment and management at early stage of ulcer is still the most efficient and cost - effective solution , rather than managing them in the hospital .
finally , in this tertiary care hospital - based retrospective study , lea incidence and mortality could be less related to insufficient resources than to patient 's attitudes and systems of health - care organization .
diabetic foot complications are indeed one of the preventable and curable complications of diabetes [ 19,39 ] , and the current scenario should encourage us to work harder in this field .
our ultimate target should be to make effective preventative foot - care available and education programmed that will work effectively , especially in primary and secondary health care setting .
we advocate for a regular awareness campaign at mass level to highlight the importance of good glycemic control , regular foot screening , and encouraging diabetic patients with a foot ulcer to present early to professional health care .
there is also a need to ensure that medication used for diabetes should be made affordable and treatment for diabetic foot is covered by the national health insurance scheme .
at the level of tertiary hospital care , a corollary to this preventative action is the development of teamwork and establishing a diabetic foot clinic with well - trained staff [ 25,27 ] .
future research there is paucity of information on the reason for high dfu prevalence and predictive values of risk factors for dfu in the indonesian health care and community setting .
further research should also conduct studies in order to investigate the patients' attitude with respect to knowledge and practice of foot care in central java province .
in - depth information gained from current reports and future study will be useful in developing risk - assessment model for a larger prospective cohort study .
for comparison , future studies should also evaluate clinical profiles and outcomes after the development of a specialized diabetic foot center , which is our short term goal .
limitations of the study several limitations exist to the present study , just as there are limitations in retrospective studies using a hospital database and medical record review [ 13 ] .
first , a selection bias may exist because physicians or hospital facilities influence the treatment modality .
second , since our study was embedded in daily clinical practice , limitations had to be set with regard to the number and type of data collected , such as size of ulcers and foot deformity for instance .
we also present several variables with missing data , as presented in the tables in the text .
third , because our aims were descriptive , we did not undertake inferential statistical analysis , so we were not able to associate the clinical profile with outcome of diabetic foot problem .
lastly , this study is not population - based and represents patients referred to a tertiary care hospital .
it has the advantage of characterization for the severity of foot ulceration and lea rate .
however , the samples of this study were also relative small and single center , so it clearly indicates the need for multicenter study to provide the real size of this problem .
conclusion diabetic foot pathologies are common in diabetics and pose serious health problems for developing countries .
they seem to affect both sexes equally .
the present study highlights the significance of patients with dfu in tertiary care hospital in the indonesian context where diabetes is poorly controlled , there was also little awareness for foot care and delay in seeking treatment , as this will worsens the extent of tissue destruction .
our center is a tertiary referral center in which patients referred have rather advanced diseases .
many patients fail to receive timely and optimal care once present in the hospital .
in the end , lea is a common outcome of dfu who are admitted to our hospital , as well as being a notable cause of death .

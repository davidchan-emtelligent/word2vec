background g protein - coupled receptor kinase type 4 ( grk4 ) plays a vital role in the long - term control of blood pressure ( bp ) and sodium excretion by regulating renal g protein - coupled receptor phosphorylation , including dopamine type 1 receptor ( d1r ) .
ultrasound - targeted microbubble destruction ( utmd ) is a promising method for gene delivery. whether this method can deliver grk4 small interfering rna ( sirna ) and lower bp is not known .
methods and results bp , 24 - hour sodium excretion , and urine volume were measured after utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery to the kidney in spontaneously hypertensive rats .
the expression levels of grk4 and d1r were determined by immunoblotting .
the phosphorylation of d1r was investigated using immunoprecipitation .
the present study revealed that utmd - mediated renal grk4 sirna delivery efficiently reduced grk4 expression and lowered bp in spontaneously hypertensive rats , accompanied by increased sodium excretion .
the increased sodium excretion might be accounted for by the utmd regulation of d1r phosphorylation and function in spontaneously hypertensive rats .
further analysis showed that , although utmd had no effect on d1r expression , it reduced d1r phosphorylation in spontaneously hypertensive rats kidneys and consequently increased d1r - mediated natriuresis and diuresis .
conclusions taken together , these study results indicate that utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery to the kidney effectively reduces d1r phosphorylation by inhibiting renal grk4 expression , improving d1r - mediated natriuresis and diuresis , and lowering bp , which may provide a promising novel strategy for gene therapy for hypertension .

2016 ; 5 : e004028 doi : 10.1161 / jaha.116.004028 ) introduction the kidney is the major organ involved in the regulation of sodium homoeostasis , and it plays a major role in the long - term control of blood pressure ( bp ). 1 dopamine , a well - known neurotransmitter in the central nervous system , also plays an autocrine / paracrine regulatory role with respect to sodium and water transport through the occupation of several receptor subtypes.2 dopamine receptors are classified into d1 - and d2 - like subtypes based on their structure and pharmacology .
d1 - like receptors ( d1r and d5r ) couple with the stimulatory g protein galphas and stimulate adenylyl cyclase ( ac ) activity , whereas d2 - like receptors ( d2r , d3r , and d4r ) couple with the inhibitory g proteins galphai / galphao and inhibit ac activity.3 in particular , the d1 - like receptors are responsible for regulating over 50 % of renal sodium excretion when salt intake is increased.2 , 3 in hypertensive states , d1r - mediated natriuresis and diuresis are lost owing to hyperphosphorylation , which leads to the uncoupling of d1r from g protein and the consequent loss of function.3 g protein - coupled receptor kinases ( grks ) comprise a family of 7 serine / threonine protein kinases that specifically phosphorylate and regulate agonist - activated g protein - coupled receptors ( gpcrs ). 4 specifically , grk type 4 ( grk4 ) appears to play a vital role in the long - term control of bp and in sodium homoeostasis.5 studies have shown that renal grk4 modulates dopaminergic - mediated natriuresis.6 , 7 increased grk4 activity contributes to the impairment of renal d1r function in hypertension .
depletion of renal cortical grk4 increases sodium excretion and urine volume and lowers bp in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( shrs ). 6 therefore , suppression of grk4 in the kidney is an important issue and might be an alternative method for lowering bp in hypertension .
ultrasound - targeted microbubble destruction ( utmd ) has received the most attention as an approach for transferring genes or medicines into some organs , including the heart , liver , and kidney.8 , 9 , 10 we investigated whether this method could deliver grk4 small interfering rna ( sirna ) and lower bp in shrs .
our results indicate that utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery to the kidney effectively reduces d1r phosphorylation by inhibiting renal grk4 expression , improving d1r - mediated natriuresis and diuresis , and lowering bp , which may provide a promising novel strategy for gene therapy for hypertension .
methods materials the antibodies ( grk4 and d1r ) were rabbit anti - rat antibodies and were purchased from santa cruz biotechnology , inc .
( dallas , tx ) and millipore ( billerica , ma ) .
the phosphoserine antibody was a rabbit anti - rat antibody and was purchased from cell signaling technology ( beverly , ma ) .
fenoldopam , a d1 - like receptor agonist , was purchased from sigma ( st. louis , mo ) .
all other chemicals for the various buffers were of the highest purity available and purchased from sigma or gibco ( grand island , ny ) .
preparation of the microbubbles carrying grk4 sirna 5 - carboxyfluorescein ( 5 - fam ) - labeled grk4 sirna was synthesized by ribobio ( gangzhou , china ) for fluorescence tracing studies .
microbubbles carrying grk4 sirna were prepared using poly - l - lysine ( pll ) and the electrostatic adsorption method.11 the pll solution ( 1 mg / ml ) was prepared with sterile double - distilled water .
the pll solution was then mixed with the blank microbubbles at a 1:1 ( v / v ) ratio and incubated at 4degreesc for 30 minutes .
the mixture was then washed twice with pbs to remove any unbound pll .
grk4 sirna was added to this microbubble solution at a 1:1 ( v / v ) ratio , and the mixture was incubated at 4degreesc for 30 minutes .
next , 200 ml of pbs was added to the microbubble mixture , and the suspension was washed by centrifugation twice at 1000g for 3 minutes to remove any unbound grk4 sirna , after which the microbubbles labeled with both grk4 sirna and pll were obtained .
animals and utmd treatment the experimental protocols were approved by the third military medical university animal care and use committee .
shrs ( 250 - 260 g ) were purchased from the animal centre of the third military medical university ( chongqing , china ) .
male shrs ( slrc laboratory animals , shanghai , china ) ranging in age from 9 to 16 weeks were fed a regular and normal sodium ( 0.4 % nacl ) rat chow .
food , but not water , was withheld for 24 hours before the study .
the experiments were performed in a thermostatically controlled room at an ambient temperature of =~ 24degreesc to 26degreesc .
the rats were fixed in the left lateral position after satisfactory anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of 2 % pentobarbital sodium at a dose of 50 mg / kg. only the right kidney of each rat was treated with utmd .
the right kidney was localized and irradiated using the 9l4 linear array probe of an ultrasound imaging system for 5 minutes of continuous irradiation ( 42 frames per s , mechanical index = 0.9 , frequency = 7.00 mhz ) .
the probe was positioned in a transducer holder at an appropriate place to keep the contralateral kidney without treatment by utmd in the same ultrasound image .
before the injection , a bottle of microbubbles was shaken for 45 seconds in a custom - built oscillation apparatus to form a microbubble suspension .
microbubbles carrying grk4 sirna and blank microbubbles were injected into the lateral tail vein through a 26 - gauge needle connected to a 1 - ml syringe via a 15 - cm - long catheter ( 0.45x15 round wall , long bevel , china ) , controlled by a syringe pump .
the injection was completed within 30 seconds and was followed by 0.5 ml saline that was used to wash the tube .
the utmd treatments were performed every 3 days .
each rat in total received 6 treatments .
bp was measured in the conscious rats at 3 - day intervals using the tail - cuff method ( ml125 , power lab ; ad instruments , castle hill , australia ) .
in brief , before the measurements , the rats were warmed for 15 minutes at 35degreesc to allow for the detection of tail artery pulsations and to acquire the pulse level .
next , the rats were placed in individual plastic restrainers , and a cuff with a pneumatic pulse sensor was wrapped around their tails .
the measurements of arterial bp ( systolic , diastolic , and the mean ) were performed at least 5 times for each animal , and the mean values of several successive measurements were used .
to minimize stress - induced fluctuations in bp , all of the rats were trained by measuring bp daily for at least 7 days before the beginning of the measurements .
the same person acquired the final values in the same peaceful environment .
urine was collected in metabolic cages , and the 24 - hour urine volumes and sodium excretions were also measured at the indicated times .
serum urea nitrogen ( bun ) and creatinine levels were estimated using an automated biochemistry machine ( technicon ra - 1000 ; bayer , tarrytown , ny ) according to the standard procedure of kits .
surgical procedures and experimental protocol for renal function studies the surgical procedures and surgical interventions were performed as reported.12 , 13 prior to the performance of the experiments , the rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital ( 50 mg / kg body weight , intraperitoneally ) , placed on a heated table to maintain a rectal temperature between 36degreesc and 37degreesc , and tracheotomized ( pe - 240 ) .
anesthesia was maintained via the infusion of pentobarbital sodium at 0.8 mg / 100 g body weight per hour .
catheters ( pe - 50 ) were placed into the external jugular and femoral veins for fluid replacement and the carotid artery for monitoring of the systemic arterial pressure ( cardiomax ii ; columbus instruments , columbus , oh ) .
a laparotomy was performed , and both the right and left ureters were catheterized ( pe - 10 ) .
the right renal artery was exposed , and the right suprarenal artery , which originates from the right renal artery , was catheterized ( pe - 10 heat stretched to 180 mum ) for vehicle ( saline ) or reagent infusion at the rate of 40 mul / h. the total duration of the surgical procedures was =~ 60 minutes .
the fluid losses during surgery were replaced with 5 % albumin in normal saline at 1 % body weight over 30 minutes .
after an equilibration period of 120 minutes following the surgery , 6 consecutive 40 - minutes urine samples were collected , including the following : c1 and c2 ( averaged as the control period ) ; d1 and d2 , ( averaged as the fenoldopam period ) ; and r1 and r2 ( averaged as the recovery period ) .
during the basal and recovery periods , only saline alone was infused .
during the fenoldopam period , fenoldopam ( 1.0 mg / kg per minute in saline , tocris bioscience ) , which is a d1 - like receptor agonist , was infused .
the urine was stored at - 80degreesc until use .
masson staining samples of kidney were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde buffer , embedded in paraffin , and cut into 3 - mum sections .
the tissue samples were stained using the following steps : stained in weigert 's hematoxylin working solution ; added biebrich scarlet solution ; differentiated in phosphotungstic / phosphomolybdic acid solution ; added aniline blue solution ; differentiated in 1 % acetic acid ; then the stained tissues were dehydrated , cleared , and mounted on a coverslip .
after the masson staining , the sections were photographed ( dn100 , e600 ; nikon co. , tokyo , japan ) .
the fraction of fibrotic tissue was determined using image j software ( nih , bethesda , md ) .
cell culture immortalized renal proximal tubule ( rpt ) cells from shrs were cultured at 37degreesc in a 95 % air / 5 % co2 atmosphere in dmem / f - 12 culture media as previously described.14 , 15 the cells ( 80 % confluence ) were lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer ( pbs with 1 % np40 , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 0.1 % sds , 1 mmol / l edta , 1 mmol / l egta , 1 mmol / l pmsf , 10 mug / ml aprotinin , and 10 mug / ml leupeptin ) , sonicated , maintained on ice for 1 hour , and centrifuged at 16 000g for 30 minutes .
the supernatants were stored at - 70degreesc until use for immunoblotting .
small interfering rna the cells were grown in 6 - well plates until 60 % confluence , and 50 nmol / l sirna or control rna was mixed with 6 mul of lipofectamine rnaimax ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) according to the manufacturer 's instruction .
cells were incubated for 25 minutes and then switched to growth medium and incubated for another 24 to 72 hours .
next , the cells were harvested for rna or protein extraction , which was quantified by real - time reverse transcription - quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( rt - qpcr ) or western blotting to determine the efficiency of the sirna - induced grk4 gene silencing .
we checked 3 rat grk4 sirna sequences including the following : # 1 forward primer : 5 ' - ccuguauucuuagaccaaadtdt - 3 ' , reverse primer : 3 ' - dtdt ggacauaagaaucugguuu - 5 ' ; # 2 forward primer : 5 ' - ggcugucugauauaugaaadtdt - 3 ' , reverse primer : 3 ' - dtdtccgacagacuauauacuuu - 5 ' ; # 3 forward primer : 5 ' - ggagagagcuccugaaguudtdt - 3 ' , and reverse primer : 3 ' - dtdtccucucucgaggacuucaa - 5 ' .
next , we selected the most effective primer for the further experiment .
immunoprecipitation equal amounts of kidney homogenate ( 800 mug protein ) were incubated with affinity - purified anti - d1r antibody ( 2 mug ) for 1 hour .
next , 50 mul of protein g beads were added , and the mixture was incubated with rocking overnight at 4degreesc .
the immunoprecipitates were pelleted and washed 4 times with lysis buffer .
the pellets were suspended in sample buffer , boiled for 10 minutes , and subjected to immunoblotting with polyclonal anti - phosphoserine antibody.16 , 17 quantitative rt - pcr for the rt - qpcr analysis , the cdna was synthesized from 0.5 mg of total rna with a cdna synthesis kit ( high capacity rna - to - cdna kit ; takara , tokyo , japan ) .
in a thermal cycle , 2 mul cdna was used per 25 - mul final reaction volume .
the pcrs were performed with the brilliant sybr green qpcr master mix kit ( high capacity rna - to - cdna kit ; takara ) in a total volume of 25 mul .
for the grk4 , the forward primer was 5 ' - tgtcctgatcctgaggc - 3 ' and the reverse primer was 5 ' - acacaccctgtcgcaat - 3 ' .
for the gapdh , the forward primer was 5 ' - gacatgccgcctggagaaac - 3 ' and the reverse primer was 5 ' - agcccaggatgccctttagt - 3 ' .
the amplification profile for grk4 and gapdh was 95degreesc for 3 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95degreesc for 10 seconds and 60degreesc for 30 seconds .
the rt - qpcr experiments were repeated 3 times .
immunoblotting after measuring the protein concentration , the supernatants were mixed with laemmli sample buffer , boiled for 5 minutes , subjected to electrophoresis , and then transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes .
the transblots were probed with grk4 ( 1:400 ; santa cruz biotechnology , dallas , tx ) or d1r antibody ( 1:400 ; santa cruz biotechnology ) overnight at 4degreesc .
the membranes were then further incubated with irdye 800 infrared - labeled donkey anti - rabbit secondary antibodies ( li - cor biosciences , lincoln , ne ) at room temperature for 1 hour .
the bound complex was detected using the odyssey infrared imaging system ( li - cor biosciences ) .
the images were analyzed using the odyssey application software to obtain the integrated intensities .
statistical analysis the data are expressed as mean +/ - sem .
first , we addressed the normality assumption for anova and t tests and found that the variable was normally distributed .
comparisons within groups were then performed with anova for repeated measures ( or paired t tests when only 2 groups were compared ) , and the comparisons among groups ( or t tests when only 2 groups were compared ) were made with anova with duncan 's test .
a p value < 0.05 was considered significant .
results effective targeting of grk4 with rnai to achieve the expected gene silencing effect of the rna interference ( rnai ) , we designed 3 grk4 sirnas and then screened for the best .
the results revealed that all 3 of the grk4 sirnas led to decreased grk4 mrna expression in the shr rpt cells ( figure 1a ) .
however , the # 1 grk4 sirna had the best effect on grk4 expression compared with the others ( figure 1b ) .
therefore , we chose the # 1 grk4 sirna for the subsequent experiments .

fluorescence microscopy confirmed that the sirna labeling approach was effective , and only the microbubbles conjugated with the 5 - fam - labeled grk4 sirna exhibited green fluorescence ( figure 2b ) .
no fluorescence was observed from the control microbubbles ( figure 2c and 2d ) .

utmd - mediated delivery of grk4 sirna decreases bp in shrs figure 3a - a demonstrates a renal ultrasound image in one shr .
renal opacification and subsequent microbubble destruction were observed under ultrasonic irradiation , which indicated that the renal perfusion was sufficient ( figure 3a - b and 3a - c ) .
after treatment with utmd for 20 days , both the renal grk4 mrna and protein expression levels were found to be markedly decreased ( figure 3b and 3c ) .
to exhibit the specificity of the utmd , we also checked the grk4 expression in the heart and arteries , which resulted in utmd - mediated grk4 sirna delivery that had no effect on grk4 expression in those tissues ( figure 3d and 3e ) .

owing to the importance of grk4 on bp regulation , we also checked bp in those rats .
the results revealed that the basal bp was comparable between the utmd treatment group and the control group .
a significant difference was found from 12 days after utmd treatment and was maintained for at least 20 days ( figure 4a and 4b ) .
our further study also revealed that grk4 sirna via utmd increased the 24 - hour sodium excretion and urine volume from 12 days ( figure 5a and 5b ) .

we also measured renal function and the effect on renal fibrosis after utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery to the kidneys in the shrs .
the results revealed that there were no differences in bun or serum creatinine levels between the utmd treatment group and the control group ( figure 5c and 5d ) .
however , renal fibrosis was decreased after treatment with utmd for 20 days in the shrs ( figure 5e and 5f ) .
utmd - mediated delivery of grk4 sirna regulates d1r phosphorylation and d1r - mediated natriuresis in shrs as mentioned above , d1r is the major target of grk4 in the kidney .
we determined whether grk4 sirna via utmd in the kidney regulates d1r phosphorylation and function in shrs .
our results revealed that , although there was no difference in the d1r protein expression between the utmd treatment group and the control group ( figure 6a ) , grk4 sirna via utmd decreased the phosphorylation of d1r compared with the control group ( figure 6b ) .
moreover , utmd - mediated delivery of grk4 sirna also led to an improvement in d1r - mediated natriuresis in shrs because fenoldopam , a d1 - like receptor agonist , led to a greater increase in sodium excretion and urine volume in the utmd treatment group than the control group ( figure 6c and 6d ) .
these results suggest that silencing grk4 expression via utmd improves renal d1r function .

discussion it is well acknowledged that dopamine plays a vital role in the regulation of bp by functioning as an autocrine / paracrine regulator of sodium and water transport via the occupation of 5 receptor subtypes .
all 5 dopamine receptors are present in the kidney .
the disruption of any of the dopamine receptor genes in mice results in hypertension , which further indicates the role of the dopamine receptor in the regulation of bp.18 , 19 during normal or moderately increased nacl intake , inhibition of d1 - like receptors decreases sodium excretion by =~ 60 % 20 , 21 activation of d1 - like receptors can inhibit sodium hydrogen exchanger type 3 , sodium phosphate cotransporter type iia , the chloride bicarbonate exchanger , probably the nacl cotransporter , and the epithelial sodium channel at the luminal membrane in addition to na + - k + atpase and the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter at the basolateral membrane.22 , 23 , 24 the ability of dopaminergic reagents to inhibit renal ion transport is impaired in humans with essential hypertension and rodents with genetic hypertension.25 , 26 the impaired renal tubular dopaminergic function in hypertension has been ascribed to the hyperphosphorylation of dopamine receptors , especially d1r , and their uncoupling from their g protein / effector complex , which consequently leads to an impaired inhibitory effect on renal ion transport , decreased dopamine - mediated natriuresis and diuresis , and increased bp.27 , 28 grks , including grk1 - grk7 , interact with the agonist - activated gpcrs to promote receptor phosphorylation and initiate receptor desensitization.4 in the process of receptor desensitization , grks phosphorylate agonist - bound gpcrs , which causes the translocation and binding of arrestins to gpcrs and the inhibition of the subsequent receptor activation via the blocking of gpcr - g protein coupling .
increasing numbers of studies have shown that grks are associated with hypertension and bp responses to antihypertensive medicines.29 , 30 in particular , grk4 seems to play a vital role in regulating dopamine - mediated natriuresis.31 , 32 grk4 activity is increased in the kidneys of humans with essential hypertension.7 basal grk4 expression and serine - phosphorylated d1r levels are much higher in shrs than in wistar - kyoto ( wky ) rats.6 silencing of renal cortical grk4 decreases serine - phosphorylated d1r in both shrs and wky rats.6 in human rpt cells , grk4 constitutively phosphorylates d1r in the absence of agonist activation ; however , both heparin , an inhibitor of grk activity , and grk4 antisense oligonucleotides blunt the desensitization of d1r,33 which recovers the impaired d1r - mediated natriuresis and diuresis .
in addition to the regulation of d1r , grk4 has also been found to regulate the phosphorylation and function of renal d3r.34 as previously mentioned , the inhibition of grk4 expression restores dopamine receptor function and lowers bp. therefore , the selection of better approaches to suppress renal grk4 expression is an important issue for the regulation of sodium excretion and bp in hypertension .
however , currently , it is difficult to specifically inhibit grk4 activity because there is no specific inhibitor for grk4 .
the limitations to the current methods for inhibiting grk4 are obvious.33 , 34 , 35 , 36 for example , heparin is not a specific inhibitor of grk4 .
the gene transfection efficiency is lower because of the ubiquitous rnase.33 , 34 , 35 , 36 moreover , the use of a virus for gene transfection would lead to safety concerns .
therefore , a nonviral and highly efficient method would be desirable in clinics .
microbubbles , which are an emerging nonviral vector system for the delivery of sirna , may overcome the current sirna delivery limitations.35 currently , utmd - mediated gene and drug delivery have been widely used in studies on cardiovascular disease.36 , 37 , 38 however , there are no reports of evaluations of utmd - mediated gene delivery related to the treatment of hypertension .
in the present study , we found that utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery reduced renal grk4 expression and consequently decreased bp in shrs , which suggests that utmd - mediated sirna delivery is an efficient method for the delivery of sirnas to the kidney and a potential clinical strategy for lowering bp in the future .
in addition , we also observed the protection of utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery to the renal function .
our present study found that , although the renal fibrosis is significantly different between shrs and the utmd - targeted grk4 sirna - treated shrs , the renal function , determined by bun and creatinine , has no difference between two groups .
the reasons leading to the different results for fibrosis and renal function are not completely known ; however , at least , the compensatory effect of residual normal nephron may be involved .
in fact , a similar phenomenon has been reported in a previous study .
shrs do not show a difference when compared with wky rats regarding serum bun or creatinine levels.39 however , renal fibrosis is increased in shrs compared with wky rats.40 although the mechanisms leading to renal fibrosis are complicated , local factors , such as angiotensin ii and transforming growth factor - beta , have been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis .
our previous studies have shown that inhibition of grk4 reduced renal and arterial angiotensin ii type 1 receptor ( at1r ) expression.17 , 41 therefore , utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery may also decrease at1r - mediated profibrogenic effects via reducing at1r expression , which needs to be determined in the future .
conclusions the present study demonstrates that in shrs , utmd - targeted grk4 sirna delivery to the kidney reduces grk4 expression , restores d1r phosphorylation and associated sodium excretion , and leads to lowered bp ( figure 7 ) .
these findings indicate that utmd - mediated grk4 sirna delivery may provide a promising novel strategy for gene therapy for hypertension .

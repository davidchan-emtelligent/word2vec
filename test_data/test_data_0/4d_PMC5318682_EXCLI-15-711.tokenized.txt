a 56 - year - old woman was admitted to our hospital with abdominal fullness .
ascites , prominent bilateral ovaries , and elevated ca - 125 were noted .
computed tomography showed thickened peritoneum and strandings in the mesentery and omentum .
exploratory laparotomy was performed under the provisional diagnosis of ovarian cancer , but the final diagnosis was peritoneal tuberculosis .
careful evaluation of bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries and peritoneum are helpful for correct diagnosis .
carcinomatosis peritonei computed tomography ( ct ) ovarian cancer peritoneum tuberculosis introduction diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis is difficult .
tuberculous peritonitis , accounting for 1 % - 2 % of all tuberculosis cases , is caused by abdominal or pelvic tuberculosis that involves the peritoneum ( koc et al. , 2006 [ 4 ] ; oge et al. , 2012 [ 8 ]) .
the postulated mechanism is tubercular bacilli reaching the peritoneal cavity via the bloodstream or by direct spread from contiguous infected small intestine , lymph nodes , and fallopian tubes ( teh et al. , 1987 [ 10 ]) .
patients usually have nonspecific symptoms and signs such as abdominal pain , abdominal distension , and poor appetite .
the serum cancer antigen ( ca ) - 125 can be elevated in both ovarian cancer and peritoneal tuberculosis .
similar clinical and image findings lead to diagnostic difficulty and the challenge of distinguishing these two disease entities .
we report computed tomography ( ct ) imaging characteristics of a case of peritoneal tuberculosis with elevation of ca - 125 mimicking ovarian cancer with carcinomatosis peritonei .
case report a 56 - year - old woman had suffered from abdominal fullness for three months .
she had had poor appetite , general malaise , nausea and vomiting two weeks earlier , but denied tarry stool or diarrhea .
she had lost about 6 kg over 3 months .
abdominal sonography revealed ascites .
laboratory data showed normocytic anemia , with hemoglobin 10.3 g / dl ( normal range , 12 - 16 g / dl ) , and ca - 125 level elevated to 188.6 u / ml ( normal range , < 35 u / ml ) .
abdominopelvic ct revealed multiloculated ascites in her abdomen and pelvis , thickened peritoneum , strandings in the omentum , small mesenteric nodules , enlarged mesenteric and paraaortic lymph nodes , prominent ovaries , and dilated fallopian tubes ( figure 1 ( fig. 1 )) .
there was no evidence of soft tissue in the ileocecal region .
under the initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer with carcinomatosis peritonei , she was admitted and exploratory laparotomy was performed .
the operative findings included small nodules in the peritoneum , omentum , small bowel loops , uterus , and fallopian tubes and severe adhesions between bowel loops , the left ovary , and the pelvic side wall .
the tentative diagnosis was carcinomatosis peritonei , so left salpingo - oophorectomy , enterolysis and peritoneum biopsy was performed .
the final diagnosis from the biopsy was tuberculosis peritonitis .
microscopic sections showed granulomatous inflammation with central caseous necrosis , epithelioid histiocytes and langhans giant cells in the ovary , fallopian tube , and peritoneum ( figure 2a ( fig. 2 )) .
mycobacterial bacilli were also demonstrated by acid - fast stain ( figure 2b ( fig. 2 )) .
discussion tuberculous peritonitis is a rare manifestation of tuberculosis , occurring in less than 4 % of tuberculosis patients ( thoeni and margulis , 1979 [ 11 ]) .
it is still a very important cause of ascites in endemic areas .
in industrialized countries , patients with alcoholism , cirrhosis , renal failure , diabetes mellitus or malignancy , or other immunodeficiencies such as aids are the high - risk groups ( na - chiangmai et al. , 2008 [ 7 ]) .
however , because of the relatively lower incidence of aids in female patients and imaging findings similar to those of ovarian cancers , clinicians and radiologists can easily overlook the possibility of tuberculous peritonitis .
tuberculous peritonitis and ovarian cancer are totally different disease entities. with adequate therapy regimens , tuberculous peritonitis has a good prognosis , except in older patients in poor health ( chow et al. , 2002 [ 3 ]) .
gynecologists should be alerted to the possibility of tuberculosis infection , and specimens should be taken during operation to avoid unnecessary extended surgery .
ca - 125 , the common tumor marker of ovarian cancer , is also elevated in patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis ( yilmaz et al. , 2001 [ 12 ]) .
this is because ca - 125 antigen is a large transmembrane glycoprotein derived from coelomic ( pericardium , pleura , peritoneum ) and mullerian ( fallopian tube , endometrial , and endocervical ) epithelium .
elevation of ca - 125 antigen can be caused by ovarian cancer , other malignancy , benign ovarian disease and benign gynecological conditions , particularly leiomyomas , in female patients ( moss et al. , 2005 [ 6 ]) .
bilgin et al .
( 2001 [ 2 ]) reported 10 cases of peritoneal tuberculosis with pelvic abdominal masses , ascites and elevated ca - 125 mimicking advanced ovarian carcinoma .
they concluded that there is a high rate of misdiagnosis between advanced ovarian cancer and peritoneal tuberculosis .
the most common ct features of tuberculous peritonitis in published reports include high - density lymphadenopathy , high - density ascites , and thickening and nodularity of peritoneal surfaces , mesentery , omentum , and bowel walls .
in appearance , there is significant overlapping , and none of these ct findings is pathognomonic for tuberculous peritonitis ( rodriguez and pombo , 1996 [ 9 ] ; barutcu et al. , 2002 [ 1 ]) .
according to the rodriguez study , the most useful ct findings for distinguishing peritoneal tuberculosis and peritoneal carcinomatosis are in the appearance of the parietal peritoneum ( rodriguez and pombo , 1996 [ 9 ]) .
a smooth peritoneum with minimal thickening and pronounced enhancement suggests peritoneal tuberculosis , whereas nodular implants and irregular peritoneal thickening suggest peritoneal carcinomatosis ( rodriguez and pombo , 1996 [ 9 ]) .
fallopian tubes are affected in 94 % of women with genital tuberculosis .
salpingitis caused by hematogenous dissemination is almost always bilateral ( leder and low , 1995 [ 5 ]) .
disproportionate bilateral adnexal masses , dilated and intense enhanced mucosa of bilateral fallopian tubes representing salpingitis , smudged fat planes and loculated ascites are the important clues to a correct diagnosis .
ca - 125 data are not crucial for ruling out peritoneal tuberculosis because ca - 125 can also be markedly elevated by a chronically inflamed peritoneum .
financial interests none declared .
competing interests the authors state that they have no conflict of interest ( coi ) .

the most problematic here is chronic low grade inflammation which increases with the age ( i.e. , immunaging ) .
this type of inflammation differs from classical acute inflammation by the absence of clinical symptoms and specific activation of monocytes in the circulation and tissue macrophages .
highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for detection of this inflammatory condition are urgently needed .
in our laboratory , we have identified several biomarkers that are expressed by macrophages differentiated in the microenvironment typical for chronic low grade inflammation .
these markers include receptors stabilin - 1 and il17rb , and transcription factor foxq1 .
stabilin - 1 is a multifunctional macrophage receptor responsible for scavenging of unwanted self products and for sorting of newly synthesized ligands and facilitating their secretion .
these functions of stabilin - 1 indicate that it is not only a marker , but also actively involved in the regulation of inflammatory reactions .
il17rb is a receptor for il17e - the sole member of il17 family that is not involved in regulation of type 1 inflammation , but rather mediating low grade type 2 inflammation .
foxq1 is a transcription factor of forkhead family .
the entire family is actively involved in regulation of innate and adaptive immune reactions including the development of regulatory t - cell phenotype .
our data indicate that foxq1 is typical for macrophages showing increased adhesion and migration capabilities , making them active players in low grade inflammation in tissues .
all above mentioned biomarkers are expressed by monocytes / macrophages upon stimulation with il - 4 or in combination with tgfbeta and / or ifngamma - cytokines playing important role in chronic low grade inflammation .
association of stabilin - 1 , foxq1 and il17rb with chronic low grade inflammation makes them not only viable personalized diagnostic markers , but also suggests their usefulness as targets for development of novel personalized therapeutic options .
we propose to use novel biomarkers of chronic inflammation to predict individual reactions of patients to implants and as a reference for development of immunostabilizing therapies to prevent implant failure .

however , it has been demonstrated that the simple publication of guidance is unlikely to optimise practice .
for dentistry in scotland , the production of national clinical guidance is the responsibility of the scottish dental clinical effectiveness programme ( sdcep ) .
to support the translation of sdcep guidance into practice , triads ( translation research in a dental setting ) , a multidisciplinary research collaboration , has developed a standardised kt framework embedded within the guidance development process .
the triads framework is underpinned by the com - b system [ 1 ] and theoretical domains framework [ 2 ] to help understand context and the nature of the behaviour ( s ) to be changed , and to guide identification of behavioural target ( s ) and potential interventions for change .
for each guidance , a diagnostic analysis begins at the start of guidance development .
key recommendations and associated behaviours are identified and prioritized .
information is gathered about current practice to help quantify any recommendation practice gaps .
questionnaires , focus groups and interviews are used to identify barriers and enablers to change .
where possible , routinely collected data are used to measure compliance with recommendations and inform decisions about whether a kt intervention is required .
if an intervention is not required , continued compliance is monitored .
if an intervention is required , it is evaluated using an experimental or quasi - experimental design .
the triads framework has been applied to eight guidance topics .
findings have informed the guidance development process for all .
for three topics ( decontamination ; oral health assessment ; drug prescribing ) , kt interventions have been evaluated in randomised controlled trials embedded within routine service delivery .
the triads framework enables a timely assessment of the impact of each sdcep guidance document and a theoretically informed approach to the need for and choice of additional kt interventions .
triads informs dental practitioners , policy - makers and patients on how best to translate guidance recommendations into routine clinical activities .
in addition , although based in primary dental care and focused on sdcep guidance , the generalizability of the triads framework is being explored within primary care optometry and pharmacy .

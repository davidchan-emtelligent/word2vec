in a guest editorial on world tb day , madhukar pai and puneet dewan identify programmatic and policy changes needed to end tb by 2035 .
the authors received no specific funding for this work .
the stop tb partnership 's theme for world tuberculosis day 2015 , " reach , treat , cure everyone ," calls for a global effort to find and definitively treat all people with tuberculosis ( tb ) and accelerate progress towards the ambitious goal of ending tb by 2035 [ 1 ] .
every year , among the estimated 9 million persons who develop tb , 3 million are missed - - not diagnosed , treated , nor notified to national tb programs [ 2 ] .
reaching all these individuals and ensuring accountable , effective tb treatment will require tb control programs to adopt innovative tools and modernize program service delivery .
tb control programs are beginning to retool and adopt new , molecular diagnostics that are more sensitive than smear microscopy and capable of rapidly detecting drug resistance [ 3 ] .
for example , over 10 million xpert mtb / rif ( cepheid inc , sunnyvale , ca , usa ) tests have been used in 116 countries [ 4 ]. with more laboratories offering rapid molecular tests , there has been a 3 - fold increase in the number of multidrug - resistant tb ( mdr - tb ) cases detected [ 2 ] .
the " test and treat " strategy , where everyone diagnosed with active tb is offered a drug susceptibility test to guide choice of treatment , is a key element of the " end tb strategy " [ 1 ] and is becoming the standard of care in many settings [ 5,6 ] .
along with new diagnostics , retooling is also needed to prepare for new drug regimens. with the introduction of bedaquiline , delamanid , and the expected introduction of a new drug regimen called pamz , consisting of pretomanid ( previously called pa - 824 ) , moxifloxacin , and pyrazinamide , the tb community is gearing up for the introduction of new , shorter treatment regimens within the next five years .
to secure the benefits of the new regimens , national tb programs will need to streamline regulatory and policy adoption processes and coordinate introduction of new treatment protocols , along with companion diagnostics [ 7 ] .
in order to ensure that new tools reach those who need them , new models are needed to engage informal ( i.e. , unqualified ) and private sector health care providers who dominate the health care marketplace in highly privatized health markets [ 8 ] .
national disease control programs focused on public sector health services have left these frontline care providers severely underutilized in tb control .
serving the unreached millions of people with tb will require innovative service delivery models .
social franchises , social enterprises , insurance - based initiatives , intermediary agencies , and provider aggregation models all offer new paths to engage , educate , and incentivize underutilized care providers to offer quality and affordable tb care .
several countries , including india , pakistan , bangladesh , and indonesia are experimenting with such models [ 9,10 ] .
while waiting for better therapies , tb programs can increase their effectiveness by improving treatment adherence and harnessing the transformative potential of information and communication technology for ehealth services .
for example , directly observed therapy ( dot ) has , for decades , been an important means to monitor treatment adherence and remains trusted and widely used by public health programs , despite an inconclusive evidence base [ 11 ] .
in the meantime , the number of mobile phone connections is rapidly approaching the number of people in many lower - and middle - income countries , presenting an opportunity to optimize electronic monitoring of medication adherence in programmatic settings .
ehealth innovations can have synergistic impact with improved diagnostics and drug regimens by empowering health care workers to recognize and address attrition along the pathway of seeking health care .
in fact , india is currently experimenting with innovative projects in which private doctors use mobile phones to call a contact center to notify tb cases and ensure that their patients receive e - vouchers for free and appropriate drugs [ 12 ] .
in just the first few months , private providers have enthusiastically responded and initiated treatment for thousands of patients through these initiatives , and call center operators are actively pushing information on care gaps to patients and providers and facilitating treatment adherence monitoring .
these innovative approaches are bringing previously unreported , privately - treated tb patients into the light of public health services , where care and adherence can be monitored .
these emerging models are expected to reduce costs to patients and improve adherence and outcomes [ 12 ] .
none of the above strategies can be implemented at scale without adequate funding by donors , the private sector , and , most importantly , governments .
in the long run , tb control will bring significant human , economic , and health benefits to any country [ 13 ] .
while some countries , such as china , have recognized this , increased their investments in tb control , and shown substantial reductions in disease prevalence [ 14 ] , other countries continue to lag behind .
for example , despite announcing an ambitious plan to dramatically intensify tb control by 2020 [ 15 ] , india has cut back on both health budgets in general and tb spending in particular [ 16 ] .
political leaders and policy makers need to understand that tb cannot be eliminated without investing more resources .
here , advocacy is critical .
there are signs that tb 's time in the spotlight is arriving .
the united nations secretary - general recently appointed eric goosby of the united states as the new un special envoy on tb , while actress emma thompson stepped forward to serve as a tb ambassador in england .
in india , tb came out of the shadows recently , when one of india 's most celebrated superstars , amitabh bachchan , publicly announced that he was a tb survivor and assumed his new role as tb ambassador for mumbai mission for tuberculosis control [ 12 ] .
recently , one of india 's most popular tv shows , " satyamev jayate ," focused an entire episode on tb , bringing unprecedented attention to the disease [ 12 ] .
these advocates and champions are bringing much needed public and political attention to a disease that has been neglected for far too long .
we hope such advocacy will enable national tb programs to argue for and get the resources they need to modernize tb control and reach the missing millions .

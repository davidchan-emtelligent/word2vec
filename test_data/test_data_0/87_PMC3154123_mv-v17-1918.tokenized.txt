purpose endostatin plays an important role in inhibiting corneal neovascularization ( cnv ) .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the antiangiogenic activities of lipid - mediated subconjunctival injection of the modified rgdrgd ( arginine - glycin - aspartic - arginine - glycin - aspartic - endostatin gene in a rabbit model of neovascularization in vivo .
methods a modified human endostatin gene containing an rgdrgd motif was obtained by rapid site - directed mutagenesis .
forty new zealand white rabbits underwent alkaline burn and developed cnv , which were randomly divided into four groups : an experimental control group , a pci empty vector group , a pci - endostatin group , and a pci - rgdrgd - endostatin group .
the vector , endostatin , and rgdrgd - endostatin groups received injections into the superior bulbar conjunctiva after the burn .
an injection of 5 mug was given twice at 1 - week intervals .
four eyes of two rabbits received neither treatment nor alkaline burn and served as absolute normal controls .
the areas of cnv were monitored after 7 and 14 days .
corneas were examined by histology , and vegf ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) and cd31 ( platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - 1 ) expression was detected by immunohistochemistry after 7 and 14 days .
retina , liver , and kidney were examined by histology , and cd38 expression in the inflammatory cells was detected by immunohistochemistry at 90 days .
results subconjunctival injection of both native endostatin and modified rgdrgd - endostatin genes resulted in a significant suppression of cnv in vivo , with modified rgdrgd - endostatin being more effective than native endostatin .
the mean concentration of vegf in the pci - rgdrgd - endostatin group significantly decreased compared to the means in the other groups .
upon histological examination , the endostatin - treated and rgdrgd - endostatin - treated eyes showed significantly less neovascular area and fewer vessels than the control and vector - injected groups .
retinal , hepatic , and renal tissue sections were normal , and there was no inflammatory cell infiltration observed .
conclusions native and modified endostatin can significantly inhibit cnv by suppressing the expression of vegf .
however , modified endostatin with the rgdrgd motif is far more effective than the endostatin gene in antiangiogenic activity .
galleystatusexport to xmlcorr - authorliu introduction angiogenesis or neovascularization , the development of new capillaries from preexisting blood vessels , is an important process in pathophysiologic situations .
corneal neovascularization ( cnv ) occurs when the balance between angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors is tilted toward angiogenic factors ; this imbalance can lead to corneal scarring , edema , lipidic deposition , and inflammation , resulting in significant visual impairment [ 1,2 ] .
cnv is a severe complication induced by various pathogenetic factors : it is one of the most common causes of visual impairment and it is a high - risk factor for rejection after allograft corneal transplantation [ 3 - 6 ] .
cnv can be a profoundly debilitating condition , leading to loss of the immunologic privilege of the cornea and severe visual impairment [ 7 ] .
clinically , cnv is one of the most difficult diseases to treat .
several angiogenesis inhibitors have been identified and tried as medical treatments , including prolactin [ 1,8 ] , angiostatin [ 9 ] , cyclosporine a [ 3 ] , tnp - 470 {[ o - [ chloroacetyl - carbamoyl ] fumagillol , initially called agm - 1470 ]} [ 10 ] , steroids [ 11 ] , endostatin [ 12 ] , and suramab [ 13 ] .
studies of hamid et al .
[ 14 ] showed that the application of anti - vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) agents inhibited cnv .
felix et al .
[ 15 ] and erdurmus et al .
[ 16 ] found that bevacizumab potently inhibited inflammatory corneal angiogenesis .
sharma et al .
[ 17 ] , found that angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors might represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat corneal angiogenesis .
lai 's studies [ 18 ] suggested that the expression of adenovirus - mediated sflt - 1 inhibited the angiogenesis in a rat model of cnv .
recently , gene therapy was the focus in cnv .
yoon et al .
[ 1 ] reported that lipid - mediated delivery of brain - specific angiogenesis - inhibitor 1 gene reduces rabbits' cnv .
murthey et al .
[ 19 ] demonstrated that gene transfer of kringle 5 of plasminogen inhibited cnv .
zuo et al .
[ 20 ] found that synthetic small interference rna ( sirna ) , targeting vegf - a , could inhibit mouse cnv .
wu et al .
[ 21 ] found potential feasibility in the local application of vasostatin ( vs ) or treatment of corneal angiogenesis .
peng et al .
[ 22 ] indicated that gene therapy with the recombinant , retroviral , vector - hosted mendo , and msflk - 1 genes effectively inhibited cnv induced by alkaline burn .
so far , however , there is no ideal treatment method for cnv .
for this reason , it is very important to find an effective method to treat cnv .
endostatin is a 22,000 molecular weight ( mr ) cooh - terminal fragment of collagen xviii , a component of the basement membrane , that specifically inhibits vegf and bfgf - induced endothelial proliferation in vitro and that potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo [ 23,24 ] .
systemic therapy with recombinant endostatin results in tumor regression via a complete inhibition of angiogenesis [ 25 ] .
endostatin appears to be a highly specific inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and / or migration [ 26 ] .
reports have indicated that subconjunctive injection of the pblast - hendostatin could significantly inhibit cnv [ 6 ] .
june et al .
[ 27 ] injected the recombinant endostatin - adeno - associated virus ( aav ) subconjunctivally and inhibited mouse cnv .
nicosia et al .
[ 28 ] indicated that rgd peptide could inhibit endothelial cells' proliferation and migration .
hill et al .
[ 29 ] reported that a tripeptide rgd inhibited both angiogenesis and tumor growth .
furthermore , koh et al .
[ 30 ] and yohei et al .
[ 31 ] demonstrated that the rgd motif was a potential recognition sequence for binding integrins and inhibits endothelial cells' adhesion and proliferation .
saiki et al .
[ 32 ] reported that the polymerization of the arg - gly - asp ( rgd ) core sequence was better able to augment inhibition of cell adhesion and proliferation than use of a monovalent unit of rgd peptide .
ren et al .
[ 33 ] have modified endostatin and have demonstrated that the change augments its antitumor activity , including tumor cell proliferation and migration , and angiogenesis .
therefore , this study cloned the endostatin gene and changed the rgirgad sequence into rgdrgd , using the site - directed mutagenesis method , and constructed a pci mammalian expression vector .
the study followed a rabbit cnv model , following subconjunctival injection of the endostatin and the rgdrgd - endostatin gene mixed with nonliposomal lipid .
we investigated native endostatin and modified endostatin containing an rgdrgd motif ; both significantly inhibited rabbit cnv in vivo , but the construct with the rgdrgd motif was more effective .
we found significantly less vascular area and fewer blood vessels in rgdrgd - endostatin - treated rabbit eyes than in the other groups .
furthermore , we observed low - concentration expression of vegf in the aqueous humor .
immunohistochemical analysis suggested a very low expression of cd31 in the rgdrgd - endostatin group .
the results indicate that modified rgdrgd - endostatin gene delivery may be useful as an angiogenic inhibitor for the control of cnv .
methods animals forty - two inbred adult ( female ) new zealand white rabbits weighing 2.0 - 2.5 kg each were obtained from harbin medical hospital experimental animal center , harbin , p.r. china .
prior approval of the experimental protocol was obtained from the harbin medical university school research institutional animal care and use committee .
all protocols and the treatment of animals were in accordance with the association for research in vision and ophthalmology ( arvo ) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research .
rabbit model of cnv general anesthesia was induced with an intramuscular injection of 50 mg / kg ketamine hydrochloride and 10 mg / kg xylazine .
central corneal alkali wound was produced in both eyes of 40 rabbits by applying a 5 - mm round filter paper , soaked in 1 n naoh , for 60 s [ 34 ] .
on the first day after saturation , endostatin and rgdrgd - endostatin and vector was injected into the superior bulbar conjunctiva .
twenty rabbits received subconjunctival injection of 5 mg ( 0.4 ml ) of endostatin into the right eye and vector into the left eye .
twenty rabbits received the injection of rgdrgd - endostatin into the right eye and did not receive any injection in the left eye ( experimental controls ) .
the pci vector , pci - endostatin plasmid , or pci - rgdrgd - endostatin plasmid ( 5 microg ) was mixed with 3 microl of fugene 6 ( roche , indianapolis , in ) in which 400 microl of serum - free medium was added , and injected subconjunctivally , twice a week .
four eyes of two rabbits received neither treatment nor alkaline burn and served as absolute normal controls .
then , gentamicin ointment was applied to all eyes once per day .
site - directed mutagenesis and construction of plasmids we have successfully constructed pmd18 - t - endostatin ( takara , tokyo , japan ) and conserved the plasmid of the pmd18 - t - endostatin in our laboratory .
the following primers were used to amplify the rgdrgd - endostatin gene by the rapid , site - directed mutagenesis technique , respectively : sense , 5 ' - cgg ggc gac cgc ggg gac ttc cag t - 3 ' ; antisense , 5 ' - act gga agt ccc cgg cgg tcg ccc cg - 3 ' ( yingjun biologic engineering technology , shanghai , china ) .

the products of pcr were precipitated by ethanol precipitation and dpni enzyme digestion ( new england biolabs , ipswich , ma ) .
the products of digestion were transformed and the positive clone was verified .
pci mammalian expression vector ( promega , madison , wi ) , which has a cmv ( cytomegalovirsu ) promoter , was used for endostatin expression .
the native and modified endostatin genes were subcloned into the xbai - sali sites of the pci vector ( promega ) , which was then introduced into e. coli dh5alpha ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) and ampicillin - resistant clones were selected .
the amplified sequence was further confirmed with automated sequencing by sangon technology ( shanghai sangon biologic engineering technology , shanghai , china ) .
plasmids were purified using the qiaprep spin miniprep kit from qiagen ( valencia , ca ) .
examination of exogenous endostatin gene expression in the transfected cornea in a separate experiment to assess the exogenous protein expression and the duration of exogenous endostatin and rgdrgd - endostatin mrna expression in the transfected rabbit cornea , total rnas were prepared from rabbit cornea tissues at 3 , 5 , and 7 days after endostatin , rgdrgd - endostatin , and vector gene injection into the right and left eyes , respectively ( n = 3 for each time period ) .
total rna ( 400 microg ) was reverse - transcribed with random primers and mmlv by the rt - pcr kit ( promega ) .
pcr amplification of cdna was performed using rt - pcr and the primer sets were sense 5 ' - ata gcc agc gaa ttc atg cac agc cac - 3 ' and antisense 5 ' - att gtc gac cta ctt gga ggc - 3 ' .

a specific pcr primer for rabbit glyceraldehydes , 3 - phosphate dehydro - genase ( gapdh ) was designed based on the cdna sequences ( 465 bp ) : sense,5 ' - gct cct ggt cac cag ggc tgc tt - 3 ' ; antisense , 5 ' - tgc cga agt ggt cgt gga tga cct - 3 '( yingjun biologic engineering technology , shanghai,china ) .
the pcr products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.0 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide .
evaluation completion of the clinical evaluations of cnv was as previously described [ 35 ] .
at 7 and 14 days , rabbits in four randomized groups were examined , with 10 rabbits in each group .
two investigators examined cnv daily by a slit - lamp biomicroscope and monitored angiogenic responses .
the area of cnv was determined by measuring the vessel length ( l ) from the limbus and the number of clock hours ( c ) of limbus involved [ 36 - 39 ] .
only the uniform contiguous band of neovascularization adjacent to the suture was measured .
a formula was used to determine the area [ 37 ] : c / 12x3.1416x [ r2 - ( r - l ) 2 ] , with c representing the clock hours of cnv ; l representing the length of cnv , the ends of which were conjoined with each other ; and r representing the half diameter of rabbit cornea ( 6 mm ) .
analysis of vegf in aqueous humor at 7 and 14 days , rabbits in the four randomized groups were anesthetized , and 50 mul aqueous humor was collected from each for determination of vegf .
the level of vegf was measured in the aqueous humor with an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay kit for human vegf ( r & d systems , minneapolis , mn ) [ 40 ] .
the vegf kit detected two of the four vegf isoforms ( vegf121 and vegf165 ) .
the levels of these factors in the aqueous humor were within the detection ranges , with the minimum detectable concentration being 15.6 pg / ml for vegf ( intra - assay coefficient of variation [ cv ] : 5.5 % ; inter - assay cv : 6.9 %) [ 41 ] .
histology and immunohistochemistry light microscopy corneal buttons were collected from the four groups and the absolute normal controls at the time of maximal neovascularization ( day 14 ) after alkaline burn for the control and empty vector groups .
the animals were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine , and the common carotid artery was exposed. with a catheter introduced into the common carotid artery , pbs ( phosphate buffer saline ) was flushed , followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde .
the eyes were enucleated and immediately placed into the same fixatives .
after fixation , the corneas were excised and immersed in 4 % paraformaldehyde fixative overnight at 4 degreesc .
the tissue blocks were washed , dehydrated , and embedded in paraffin ; 5 mum thin paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) .
immunohistology corneas were examined using immunohistochemical methods for four rabbits from each group .
serial olefin sections ( 5 mum ) of each eye were prepared and immunohistochemical methods analyzed the expression of vegf ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca ) .
to visualize the vascular endothelial cells and determine the degree of induced angiogenesis , sections were stained with anti - cd31 ( abcam , cambridge,ma ) .
four representative sections obtained from each cornea from the control , pci emptyh vector - injected , pci - endostatin , and pci - rgdrgd - endostatin groups were analyzed with a microscope ( olympus , tokyo , japan ) as described [ 42 ] .
to visualize the inflammatory cells , sections of the retina , liver , and kidney were stained with anti - cd38 antibody ( abcam ) on day 90 .
the immunohistochemistry process was performed according to the avidin - biotin complex ( abc ) method .
thin paraffin sections ( 5 mum ) were mounted on silanized slides , dried overnight , and deparaffinized with descending concentrations of ethanol and xylene .
the slides were placed into citrate buffer ( ph = 6 ) in a boiling pot for 5 min .
after cooling for 30 min , the specimens were incubated with 5 % normal bovine serum for 30 min , followed by incubation with the primary antibody in humidified chambers for 2 h at room temperature .
the primary antibodies used were anti - vegf antibody ( 1:400 ) , anti - cd31 antibody ( 1:400 ) , and anti - cd38 ( 1:400 ) plus 1 % normal rabbit serum , respectively .
for detection , the 3 - step abc was used .
the secondary biotinylated antibody was a goat anti - mouse immunoglobulin g ( abcam ) antibody diluted 1:200 .
finally , the slides were incubated with streptavidin and alkaline phosphatase .
the phosphatase activity was visualized by fast red solution ( sigma , st. louis , mo ) , yielding a reddish staining .
the sections were slightly counterstained with hematoxylin .
negative controls were without primary antibody .
the images were captured with a spot digital camera ( media cybernetics , silver springs , md ) , and morphometric analyses were performed using image - pro plus software ( media cybernetics ) .
the whole field at 200x magnification was examined on each cross - section , and the sum and mean of the vascular area of each vessel and the number of vessels per section were determined .
statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 15.0 software ( spss , chicago , il ) .
the statistical significance of differences between the control , vector , endostatin , and rgdrgd - endostatin gene - treated groups and between the endostatin and rgdrgd - endostatin groups were determined using anova ( anova ) and the unpaired students' t - tests .
differences were accepted as significant at p < 0.05 .
results construction of vectors containing native and modified endostatin genes to study the biologic activity of the recombinant modified human endostatin gene containing an rgdrgd motif , we modified the human native endostatin gene by a rapid site - directed mutagenesis technique , constructed mammalian expression vectors , and confirmed by sequencing ( figure 1 and figure 2 ) .
compared with human endostatin genes in the genbank ( nm _ 130445 ) , the genes used in this study had two mutant sites : the 273 base , mutated from g - - > t , and the 530 base , mutated from a - - > c. they were silent mutations and the coded amino acid was unchanged .

figure 2 the sequence analysis of the endostatin and modified rgdrgd - endostatin genes .
a : the sequence analysis of the endostatin gene in the range of 70 to 100 bp. b : the sequence analysis of the modified rgdrgd - endostatin gene in the range of 70 to 97 bp. the sequence analysis indicated that a modified endostatin gene was obtained by delete alanine ala ( a ) and isoleucine ile ( i ) changed to asparticacid asp ( d ) , and that the rgdrgd motif was successfully constructed .
endostatin expression in rabbit cornea after local gene therapy to confirm the efficiency of local gene transfer in the cnv model , the expression of human endostatin and rgdrgd - endostatin mrna in the rabbit cornea was observed until 7 days after subconjunctival gene injection ( figure 3 ) .
thus , we injected the endostatin or rgdrgd - endostatin plasmid or vector gene twice a week to maintain the duration of the transgene expression .
figure 3 rt - pcr analyses assessed the duration of endostatin or rgdrgd - endostatin mrna expression in the rabbit cornea .
the expression of the human endostatin or rgdrgd - endostatin gene ( 550 bp ) was observed until 5 days after single subconjunctival gene injection , while there was no expression of after vector ( v ) injection .
the results of rabbit gapdh ( 465 bp ) confirmed the relative amounts and fidelity of the total rna samples .
biomicroscopic examination and scoring of neovascularization the rabbit eyes were examined under a surgical microscope daily .
cnv increased gradually , peaked on days 12 - 14 , and degenerated on day 16 after suture induction .
therefore , we chose days 7 and 14 as time points to determine the number and length of vessels and the area of neovascularization .
the corneal opacity and angiogenesis gradually increased in three groups .
however , there was less angiogenesis observed in the rgdrgd - endostatin - treated group than in the other groups ( figure 4 ) .
figure 4 biomicroscopic findings in corneas after subconjunctival injection of endostatin - rgdrgd or endostatin or vector , and in untreated control corneas .
representative biomicroscopic findings of rabbit corneas are shown .
the corneas were examined at 1 , 7 , and 14 days after injection .
the endostatin - rgdrgd - treated eyes showed significantly less neovascular growth than endostatin - treated eyes or vector - treated eyes or untreated eyes at day 7 , and peaked on day 14 .
the mean areas of cnv were 21.08 +/ - 4.21 , 20.24 +/ - 5.36 , 16.24 +/ - 2.16 , and 12.56 +/ - 1.12 at day 7 and 48.47 +/ - 3.08 , 49.18 +/ - 4.29 , 30.86 +/ - 3.46 , and 19.46 +/ - 2.45 at day 14 for the control , empty vector , endostatin , and rgdrgd - endostatin groups , respectively .
analysis of the cnv area indicated that local application of rgdrgd - endostatin resulted in a significant suppression of cnv ( figure 5a ) .
figure 5 the inhibitory effect of modified rgdrgd - endostatin gene on the area of cnv and the expression vegf in aqueous humor .

tp < 0.05 , ttp < 0.01 , when cnv with the combination of rgdrgd - endostatin was compared with cnv treated with native endostatin .
vegf detected in aqueous humor the study first examined whether native endostatin and modified endostatin with rgdrgd motif genes would inhibit the expression of vegf detected in aqueous humor .
the concentration of vegf in aqueous humor was detected for 10 rabbits from each group at 7 and 14 days .
analysis of the concentration of vegf in aqueous humor indicated that local application of rgdrgd - endostatin resulted in a significant suppression of the expression of vegf ( figure 5b ) .
the concentrations of vegf in the absolute normal control group were 3.6 , 3.8 , 3.5 , and 3.4 .
the mean concentrations of vegf in the aqueous humor were 681 +/ - 40 , 689 +/ - 54 , 486 +/ - 35 , and 319 +/ - 21 at day 7 and 1,221 +/ - 116 , 1,214 +/ - 121 , 566 +/ - 47 , and 385 +/ - 31 at day 14 for the control , empty vector , endostatin , and rgdrgd - endostatin groups , respectively ( figure 5b ) .
histology analysis and expression to examine the change of cnv in the histology , corneal button sectons were stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
figure 6a showed a normal corneal button section .
no cnv were detected .
many cnv were detected in the control and empty vector groups ( figure 6b,c ) .
there were red blood cells in the lumen .
in the endostatin and rgdrgd - endostatin groups , less cnv were detected ( figure 6d,h ) .
figure 6 histologic profiles of the corneal buttons . corneal buttons were collected on day 14 ( a - e ) .
corneal button sections of normal ( a ) , control ( b ) , vector ( c ) , endostatin ( d ) , and rgdrgd - endostatin ( e ) groups were stained with hematoxylin and eosin .
expression of vegf in the corneal buttons was detected by immunohistochemistry ( f - j ) .
high levels of vegf were detected in the control and vector groups , respectively ( g - h ) ; by contrast , only minute levels were detected in the endostatin and rgdrgd - endostatin gene groups ( i - j ) , respectively . light micrographs of cd31 - stained corneas in an untreated eye after corneal denudation and the effects of rgdrgd - endostatin gene delivery on experimental corneal angiogenesis on day 14 .
representative light micrographs of cd31 - stained corneas given normal , control,vector,endostatin,or the rgdrgd - endostatin expression cassette are shown ( each group ; n = 3 ; k - o ). the absolute normal control group showed no neovascularization , the experimental normal and vector groups showed neovascular formation ( arrowheads ) , the endostatin group showed less neovascular formation,while the rgdrgd - endostatin group showed significantly less vessels and smaller areas of neovascularization compared with endostatin - treated corneas .
to examine the change in the histology and the expressions of vegf and cd31 , pathology and immunohistochemistry were performed .
in the control , empty vector,endostatin,and rgdrgd - endostatin , groups , vegf were detected in the cornea of all allografts ( figure 6g - j ) .
furthermore , we used cd31 staining as a molecular method to detect neovascularization .
immunohistochemical studies showed significant differences among these groups in the expression of cd31 .
in the control and empty vector groups , high levels of cd31 were detected in the corneal of all allografts ( figure 6l,m ) .
in the endostatin group , a lower level of cd31 was expressed ( figure 6n ). by contrast , its expression levels were very low but detectable in the rgdrgd - endostatin group ( figure 6o ) .
these findings suggest that rgdrgd - endostatin augmented the suppression of the expression of cd31 and neovascularization development .
the rgdrgd - endostatin - treated eyes showed significantly less neovascular area and fewer vessels than untreated eyes , vector - treated eyes , or endostatin - treated eyes .
histological analysis revealed the results of neovascular area and number of vessels in rgdrgd - endostatin - treated , endostatin - treated , vector - treated , and untreated control eyes ( table 1 ) .

figure 7 histological profiles of retinal , hepatic , and renal tissue sections at 90 days .
retinal , hepatic , and renal tissue sections were normal , and no inflammatory cell infiltration was observed ( a - c ) .
immunohistochemical studies indicated that cd38 + cells were not detected in the retinal , hepatic , and renal tissue sections ( e - g ) , respectively .
in positive controls , the expression level of cd38 rised significantly .
cd38 + cells ( arrowheads ) were detected in the hepatic tissue sections ( d and h ) , respectively .
discussion the cornea is a transparent anterior ocular tissue and protects the eyeball from outside stimuli [ 1 ] .
the avascular nature of the cornea is crucial for maintaining its immune - privileged status .
cnv , which occurs in many pathologic states of the cornea , reduces visual acuity [ 1 ] .
angiogenesis is a complex process that includes the activation , proliferation , and migration of endothelial cells ; the disruption of the vascular basal membrane ; and the formation of vascular tubes and networks , and it connects new and preexisting vascular networks [ 43 ] .
various angiogenic factors mediate cnv , including vegf , the basic fibroblast growth factor , matrix metalloproteinase , and insulin - like growth factor - 1 [ 1 ] .
vegf appears to be the most prominent angiogenic factor .
inhibition of vegf activity is highly effective for suppressing angiogenesis .
previous studies show that human endostatin inhibits tumor neovascular growth by suppressing vegf expression [ 44,45 ] .
human endostatin , a 20 - kda cooh - terminal fragment derived from type xviii collagen , is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor and an antitumor factor [ 46 ] .
the cooh - terminus 315 or 313 residues of collagen type xviii are noncollagenous and form the nci domain .
endostatin , specifically , inhibits vascular endothelial cell proliferation and is recognized as one of the most potent antiangiogenesis agents at present .
this factor also has the benefits of nontoxic effects or drug resistance after long - term use .
it is an ideal biologic antiangiogenesis agent .
because the n - terminal of endostatin has an internal rgirgad sequence at position 25 - 31 , the rgd motif is a potential recognition sequence for binding integrins .
whereas this study successfully changed the rgirgad sequence into an rgdrgd sequence , ren [ 33 ] identified that the ploy rgd structure in endostatin could augment biologic activity .
an alternative explanation , given our observations in the rabbit cnv model , could be that modified rgdrgd - endostatin exhibited greater inhibition of cnv in the rabbit alkaline burn model .
meanwhile , the inhibitory effects of modified rgdrgd - endostatin on rabbit cnv were greater than the effects of native endostatin .
the cornea is readily accessible for gene therapy in the laboratory and in the clinic .
the method of corneal injection of a plasmid containing the cdna is safe , effective , titratable , and easily monitored [ 1,47 ] .
fugene 6 transfection reagent showed very low cytotoxicity and delivered high transfection efficiency .
the fugene 6 used in this study is nontoxic , feasible , efficient , and safe for the cornea in the gene transferring [ 1,48,49 ] .
yoon et al .
[ 1 ] reported that the subconjunctival injection of pegfp - bai1 - ecr plasmid or pegfp vector produced green fluorescence in the corneal stroma of both groups [ 1 ] .
in this study , the expression of the human endostatin or rgdrgd - endostatin gene was observed at 3 days ; the expression was decreased at 5 days , and at 7 days there was much less expression after a single subconjunctival gene injection , while there was no expression after vector injection .
thus , the endostatin , rgdrgd - endostatin plasmids , or vector gene were injected twice a week to maintain the duration of transgene expression .
in this study , we successfully obtained modified endostatin genes by rapid site - directed mutagenesis and constructed a pci - endostatin - rgdrgd mammalian expression vector .
the lipid delivery of the rgdrgd - endostatin gene was effective at inhibiting neovascularization , which is consistent with the ren et al. report [ 33 ] that ploy rgd motif augments the biologic activity of endostatin ; this is also consistent with saiki et al .
[ 32 ] .
the histology assay indicated that the rgdrgd - endostatin - treated group had fewer vessels and smaller areas of neovascularization compared with three groups by labeling vascular endothelial cells by cd31 .
immunohistochemical studies suggested that endostatin and modified rgdrgd - endostatin could inhibit expression of vegf and neovascularization development , compared with the control and vector groups , which is consistent with the hosseini et al .
[ 14 ] report .
under the light microscope , retinal , hepatic , and renal tissue sections were normal , and no inflammatory cell infiltration was observed at 90 days .
immunohistochemical studies indicated that three tissue sections were normal , and no plasmocyte infiltration was observed at 90 days .
these findings suggest that rgdrgd - endostatin is a strong and effective antiangiogenic agent .
this study successfully obtained a modified endostatin gene and constructed mammalian expression vectors by rapid site - directed mutagenesis .
the results show that modified endostatin genes containing rgdrgd motif could augment the inhibition of the expression of vegf , significantly reducing levels of vegf , and that modified endostatin genes containing rgdrgd motif could inhibit the development of neovascularization more effectively than native endostatin .
these results indicate that modified rgdrgd - endostatin gene delivery effectively reduces experimental cnv .

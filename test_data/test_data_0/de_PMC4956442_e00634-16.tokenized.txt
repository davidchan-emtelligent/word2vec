after publication , we detected the presence of a putative cytolethal distending toxin ( cdt ) gene cluster in helicobacter fennelliae mry12 - 0050 .
in the last paragraph before the accession numbers , the third sentence should read as follows : " h. cinaedi and h. hepaticus have been reported to express cytolethal distending toxin ( cdt ) , which causes dna damage to target cells , and a putative cdt gene cluster was also identified in h. fennelliae mry12 - 0050 ( with the gene product sharing 31 % , 36 % , and 32 % amino acid sequence identity with cdta , cdtb , and cdtc , respectively , of h. cinaedi strain ccug 18818 )."

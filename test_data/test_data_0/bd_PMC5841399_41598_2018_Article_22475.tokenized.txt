this study aimed to explore the sex differentials in correlations between functional fitness ( ff ) and cognitive impairment ( ci ) in older adults without dementia .
a community - based cross - sectional study was conducted using 2096 adults more than 65 years of age .
the senior fitness test and mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) were used to measure ff and cognitive performance .
canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) was performed to evaluate the relationships between ff and mmse .
our results confirmed the relationships between ff and ci , furthermore ff and mmse were significantly different between men and women ( p < 0.05 ) .
cca results showed overall ff was positively correlated with overall mmse in both men ( canonical coefficient = 0.37 , p < 0.0001 ) and women ( first canonical coefficient = 0.42 , p < 0.0001 ; second canonical coefficient = 0.17 , p = 0.004 ) .
among men , 30s - arm curl and language were most highly correlated with ff and mmse , respectively .
whereas among women , 30s - arm curl and eight - foot up - and - go were most highly correlated with ff , and orientation and recall were most highly correlated with mmse .
in conclusion , there was a sex difference in the relationships between ff and mmse , which facilitated generating insight into cognitive performance improvement from the perspective of ff enhancement by sex .
prospective studies are needed to explore the causality between ff and cognitive performance .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction with the progress of civilization and industrialization , the aging population dramatically increases worldwide .
in china , there were 131.61 million older adults (>= 65 years old ) as of 2015 .
numerous problems manifest throughout the aging process .
dementia and cognitive impairment ( ci ) have become one of the burdensome public health issues nowadays1 .
as projected by alzheimer 's disease international in 2015 , the number of dementia patients worldwide was 46.8 million in 2015 and is expected to double every 20 years and arrive at 131.5 million by 20502 .
earlier detection and intervention have been suggested as the most cost - effective measures to prevent or slowing the onset of dementia3 .
hence , it is necessary to identify potentially modifiable lifestyle - related markers in the earliest phase of the disease .
ci is characterized by declines in memory , attention and cognitive function , which greatly affects the quality of life .
mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) is a widely used method to evaluate the cognitive state .
functional fitness ( ff ) is defined as having the physical capacity to perform normal daily activities safely and independently without undue fatigue .
a review of the existing literature indicated that decreased ff was a risk factor of dementia , and a high level of ff might reduce the risk of this disease4 - 6 .
furthermore , few studies have studied the associations between ff and cognitive status in older adults free from dementia .
a community - based study conducted in the japanese population found that each ff component had potential as a single marker of low cognitive function7 .
meanwhile , a study conducted in the korean population showed that only eight - foot up - and - go and 6 - min walk test domains were significantly associated with global cognitive performance8 .
in addition , two other recent studies indicated that gait speed was related to cognitive function in the pre - dementia stage9,10 .
however , it is not known whether ff is associated with cognitive function in chinese older adults without dementia .
furthermore , chinese oldest old ( i.e. , people aged 80 and older ) women are at a higher risk for ci than men due to sex disparities11 .
both mmse and ff are multi - dimensional concepts .
thus it is necessary for health education to examine the sex differentials in relationships between ff and cognitive function , and explore the key sub - dimensions that influence their overall relationships .
to date , few studies have performed such examinations .
our study aimed to explore the relationships between ff and ci , between sex , and apply canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) to identify the key sub - dimensions of ff and cognitive function influencing their overall relationships in chinese older adults free from dementia .
results the average age ( 72.79 +/ - 5.10 vs. 72.66 +/ - 5.28 ; t = 0.60 , p = 0.55 ) and body mass index ( bmi , 24.28 +/ - 3.42 vs. 24.66 +/ - 3.79 ; t = 1.88 , p = 0.06 ) for men and women were not significantly different .
compared with female older adults , males had a higher rate of smoking ( 34.34 % vs. 2.16 % , p < 0.0001 ) .
associations between ff and ci by sex male older adults with ci performed more poorly on all ff tests when compared with non ci older male adults , having significantly fewer 30s - chair stands , 30s - arm curls and 2 min - steps , and longer time to complete 8 - foot up - and - go , shorter chair sit - and - reach and back scratch distance ( all p < 0.05 ) .
similarly , female older adults with ci also performed more poorly on all ff tests when compared with non - ci older female adults .
the detailed values are presented in table 1 .

sex differentials of functional fitness and mini - mental state examination as summarized in table 2 , male older adults had better performance on all ff tests when compared with females , except one .
these included significantly higher 30s - chair stands , 30s - arm curls and 2 min - steps , and less time to complete eight - foot up - and - go , but shorter chair sit - and - reach distance ( all p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , total mmse score was significantly higher in male older adults than females ( 26.02 +/ - 4.44 vs. 23.40 +/ - 5.85 ; t = 11.51 , p < 0.0001 ) .
in addition , for each domain of mmse including orientation , memory , attention , recall , language , male older adult scores were significantly higher than females ( all p < 0.05 ) .

there were low to moderated correlations within and between the 6 ff variables and 5 mmse variables in men and women respectively ( table 3 ) .

the results of cca yielded five canonical functions .
for men , only the first canonical function ( canonical coefficient = 0.37 , p < 0.0001 ) was statistically significant .
but for women , both the first ( canonical coefficient = 0.42 , p < 0.0001 ) and second ( canonical coefficient = 0.17 , p = 0.004 ) canonical functions were significant .
according to the standardized canonical coefficients between variables and the canonical functions ( v in ff and w in mmse ) , the following equations were established .
v1 ( men ) = 0.198x1 + 0.167x2 + 0.528x3 + 0.228x4 + 0.365x5 - 0.047x6 w1 ( men ) = 0.151y1 - 0.393 y2 + 0.470y3 + 0.157y4 + 0.583y5 v1 ( women ) = 0.008x1 + 0.241x2 + 0.588x3 + 0.334x4 + 0.328x5 - 0.021x6 w1 ( women ) = 0.545y1 - 0.044y2 + 0.268y3 + 0.206y4 + 0.244y5 v2 ( women ) = - 0.075x1 + 0.173x2 + 0.737x3 - 0.273x4 - 0.193x5 + 0.817x6 w2 ( women ) = 0.045y1 + 0.581 y2 - 0.054y3 - 1.028y4 + 0.585y5 furthermore , v1 and w1 could explain 38.04 % and 44.08 % of ff and mmse variance in men respectively .
as for women , v1 and v2 could explain 34.86 % and 13.79 % ff variance , whereas w1 and w2 could explain 49.84 % and 12.15 % mmse variance respectively .
as shown in fig. 1 , for male older adults , the structure coefficients showed that except for eight - foot up - and - go , other variables were positively associated with ff , indicating that higher frequency of chair stand , step , arm curl , as well as shorter chair sit - and - reach distance , back scratch distance and less time to complete eight - foot up - and - go were associated with higher ff performance .
moreover , the 30s - arm curl ( rs = 0.80 ) were most highly correlated with v1 in ff , and language ( rs = 0.83 ) were most highly correlated with w1 in mmse .
among the female older adults , the 30s - arm curl ( rs = 0.80 ) and orientation ( rs = 0.90 ) were most highly correlated with v1 and w1 respectively .
in addition , the eight - foot up - and - go ( rs = 0.70 ) and recall ( rs = - 0.60 ) were most highly correlated with v2 and w2 .
figure 1 structure coefficient of canonical factors .
for male older adults , 30s - arm curl were most highly correlated with v1 in ff , and language were most highly correlated with w1 in mmse .
among the female older adults , 30s - arm curl ( rs = 0.80 ) and orientation ( rs = 0.90 ) were most highly correlated with v1 and w1 ; eight - foot up - and - go ( rs = 0.70 ) and recall ( rs = - 0.60 ) were most highly correlated with v2 and w2 , respectively .
discussion exploring modifiable lifestyle - related markers of pre - dementia cognitive function was expected to be of value to promote earlier detection and intervention measures in community - based settings12 .
the results of our study confirmed the relationships between ff and ci both in male and female older adults free from dementia .
in addition , positive moderate correlations between overall ff and overall mmse , evaluated by cca , were calculated .
muscle strength and flexibility , agility / dynamic balance , aerobic endurance all demonstrated significant contributions to the relationships between overall ff and overall mmse .
namely , older adults with higher ff generally had better cognitive conditions , which is consistent with previous studies8,13 - 15 .
furthermore , narazaki et al. found handgrip strength , leg strength , sit - to - stand rate , gait speed and one - leg stand time had significant associations with global cognitive function in japanese community - dwelling older adults without apparent cognitive problems7 .
similar results have also been demonstrated in cognitive impairment populations .
for example , lee sh et al. conducted a cross - sectional study which enrolled 500 korean older adults and found those who had mild cognitive impairment had significantly lower levels of physical fitness , especially upper body flexibility and agility / dynamic balance15 .
moreover , the results from epidos cohort study showed that there was a negative association of five - times - sit - to - stand with global cognitive performance , which meant the older adults with ci had poor agility and functional mobility16 .
in the present study , the cca results also showed that ff was associated more with orientation , attention and language , but less with memory , especially for men , which was opposite to our expectation .
a recent study showed that in young adults , better aerobic fitness was associated with hippocampal viscoelasticity that mediated the benefits of fitness on memory function17 .
in addition , another study conducted in older adults at risk for alzheimer 's disease showed that for men , significant positive associations were observed between cardiorespiratory fitness and memory , but not for women18 .
these inconsistencies might arise from the different age , mental / cognitive state of the populations studied , different evaluation methods of fitness and memory and so on. it was well known that men owned better physical strength and women owned better body tenacity19 , which were consistent with our ff results .
moreover , we also found that men performed better than women in each domain of mmse .
a growing body of research presented that chinese women were significantly disadvantaged in cognitive functioning in old age11,20 - 22 , as well as in the oldest old11.furthermore , similar with our results ( the prevalence of ci : men vs. women = 21.05 % vs. 42.91 %) , yu and colleagues also reported a large sex disparities in the prevalence of both sever and mild ci among those aged more than 65 years old in shanghai , china20 .
expect for the difference of physical structure , sex was one factor that hinted at the differences in gender roles , opportunities and obligations which conditioned the experiences of men and women throughout their life course .
lack of mental stimulation through high - skilled occupation and a large social network , which were associated with cognitive development and maintenance23 , might contribute to the lower mmse in older women .
in addition , it was worth noting that the key sub - dimensions of ff and mmse were obviously different for male and female .
for men , 30s - arm curl were most highly correlated with ff , whereas , among the female , 30s - arm curl and eight - foot up - and - go were most highly correlated with ff. furthermore , the characteristics of ff were quite different between men and women .
so for male and female , there should be different intervention programs for the improvement of ff. in addition to upper body strength , women should focus on the promotion of aerobic endurance and balance .
furthermore , for men language were most highly correlated with mmse , but for women orientation and recall were most highly correlated with mmse. that means , different sex may have different manifestations of ci. so in the early stage of cognitive degradation , focusing on different functional domains depending on sex might reduce the workload of primary health care workers .
senior fitness test ( sft ) required refined brain control for initiation of the tasks , recruitment of muscles and motor coordination .
hence , the concurrent deterioration of the brain regions responsible for cognitive and physical performance might be one possible mechanism explaining the observed association24 - 26 .
moreover , other researchers found that changes in the brain activation of older adults with aerobic exercise intervention have been accompanied by improvement in cognitive function27,28 .
taking into account the results of our study , sft was simple and required no clinical resources or devices , so physical fitness measures was of practical value for identifying and monitoring pre - clinical cognitive impairment in community - based regular checkups .
even with a larger sample size , our study had some limitations .
firstly , this study was a cross - sectional study which could not clarify the causality between ff and mmse .
secondly , we did not evaluated potential confounders of ff and mmse , such as the years of education , which might limit the interpretation of the results .
therefore , larger and prospective studies are needed to further explore the association between ff and cognitive status in chinese older adults free from dementia .
in summary , our results confirmed the relationships between ff and ci in chinese older people free from dementia .
furthermore , the present study first demonstrated the correlations between six ff and five mmse sub - dimensions using cca and revealed positive and moderate relationships between ff and mmse .
the main ff components that influence the relationships between ff and mmse in men are upper and lower body strength , whereas in women , the components are upper body strength , aerobic endurance and agility / dynamic balance .
hence , it is necessary to promote sex - specific fitness interventions to improve cognitive status among chinese older adults .
methods study population our study was designed as a cross - sectional study based on community .
participants were selected by multi - stage stratified random sampling in wuhan city , hubei province , central china , during december 2015 to may 2016 .
firstly , 7 districts were randomly selected from the 17 districts of wuhan city .
then , in each district , 3 to 5 communities were randomly enrolled .
for each community , 60 to 100 subjects were enrolled .
exclusion criteria were : age < 65 years ; no daily life activities ; with dementia , sever bodily pain , congestive heart failure , dizziness , uncontrolled high blood pressure ( exceeding 160 / 100 mmhg ) .
finally , a total of 2096 ( 1031 male and 1065 female ) adults older than 65 years were included in our study .
the study was approved by the institutional review boards of center for disease control and prevention , wuhan city and all subjects provided informed consent for participation .
the methods were carried out in accordance with the principles of the declaration of helsinki .
the demographic characteristics ( sex , age , height , weight , smoking status , yeas of education ) were collected .
in addition , senior fitness test and mini - mental state examination were used to measure ff and cognitive performance .
functional fitness measurement ff was conducted by sft which is developed for early identification of older people who are at risk of losing functionality .
after 10 min of warm - up , participants were instructed by a trained instructor .
sft was then completed in the designed order : ( 1 ) 30s - chair stand : to assess lower body strength ; ( 2 ) 30s - arm curl : to assess upper body strength ; ( 3 ) back scratch : to assess upper body ( shoulder ) flexibility ; ( 4 ) chair - sit - and - reach : to assess the flexibility of the lower extremities ; ( 5 ) eight - foot - up - and - go : to assess agility / dynamic balance as an index of basic mobility skills and ( 6 ) 2 min - step : to assess aerobic endurance .
each test was strictly performed according to the sft manual29 .
mini - mental state examination measurement cognitive assessment was evaluated by mmse which has been proven as a reliable , sensitive and valid method for cognitive performance examining .
we performed the chinese version of mmse by trained nurses .
mmse measured : ( 1 ) temporal and spatial orientation : 10 points ; ( 2 ) immediate memory : 3 points ; ( 3 ) recall : 3 points ; ( 4 ) attention : 5 points and ( 5 ) language : 9 points .
total mmse scores range from 0 to 30 points30 .
in chinese population , it was suggested that ci should be defined as mmse score < 24 in people with education for less than 9 years , or < 26 in those who have received formal education for more than 9 years31 .
statistical analysis normality of distribution for continuous variables was tested by the kolmogorov - smirnov test .
normal distribution data were presented as mean +/ - sd , and the differences between males and females were compared by unpaired student 's t - test .
to explore the key sub - dimensions of ff and cognitive function influencing their overall relationships , we used canonical correlation analysis ( cca ) .
this statistical method calculated the correlation between two sets of variables and generated statistically independent pairs of new variables , which were referred to as canonical variables .
in this study , cca was conducted using six ff variables as predictors of five mmse sub - dimensions in males and females separately .
p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant .
analyses were performed with sas software , version 9.4 for windows ( sas institute inc. , cary , nc , usa ) .

it is belonging to the family fabaceae ( leguminosae ) sub - family papilionnodeae .
this plant is known to have two subspecies , namely , ferruginae and darassana ( thulin 1983 ) .
subspecies ferruginae is known to occur at north ethiopia within the range of 1,000 and 2,500 m above sea level , while subspecies darassana is located in the southern part of the country ( particularly in sidamo ) within the range of 1,600 and 2,500 m above sea level .
the hybrid of the two subspecies believed to be found in the central and western part of ethiopia ( thulin 1983 ) .
according to the flora of ethiopia , vol. 3:108 , ( 1989 ) , millettia ferruginea found in the following regions : subspecies ferruginea ; tigray , gondar , gojam , shewa , welega and hareg .
the subspecies darassana is commonly found in welega , shewa , harege , bale , ilubabor , kefa and sidamo .
any way both species are believed to be found only in ethiopia , despite as yet an unconfirmed report from the sudan ( thulin 1989 ) .
millettia ferruginea is a n2 fixing leguminous tree species that is known to have positive effects on associated crops in the southern parts of ethiopia ( machachlan 2002 ) .
the tree usually occurs on farmlands in association with some important annual and perennial crops , such as barley ( hordeum vulgare l. ) , ensete ventricosum welw. ) cheeeman , maize ( zea mays l. ) , sorghum ( sorgum bicolor ( l. ) moench s.l. and coffee ( coffea arabica l. ) in the wendo - genet , sugallae and sokicha areas ( southern ethiopia ) .
according to muleta ( 2007 ) , from 14 dominant coffee shade tree species , millettia ferruginea had the highest frequency of occurrence ( 22.3 %) .
soil near millettia ferruginea tree is found to be rich in nutrient ( hailu et al. 2000 ) .
its wood is used to fire wood , house construction , flowers serve as feed for bees ; leaves , shoots and flowers are used as fodder for ruminants .
the pulverized and crushed seeds widely used as fish poisons ( negash 2002 ) and as insecticides for scabies and chiggers ( stein 1973 ) .
it is also used for erosion control maclachan ( 2002 ) .
hailu et al .
( 2000 ) , presented a reproduced summary of the use of millettia ferruginea trees based on interviews made in gedeo , southern ethiopia .
despite these significant benefits of the plant under this investigation , the plant seed protein and oil are not yet explored for production of economically important products like oil for soap and biodiesel production and oilcake for media and protein production for human and animal consumption .
currently , production of biodiesel from non - edible vegetable oil ( like brebra oil ) is considered important than that of using edible vegetable oil for biodiesel .
still there is no scientific report about the proximate analysis of seeds and characteristics of oil produced from brebra seed .
therefore , the main objective of this study was to determine proximate and antinutritional characteristics of seeds as well as the physicochemical characteristics of brebra seed oil .
such information may expand the scope of knowledge on the utilization and quality of the extracted oil and oilcake of the seed for different purposes .
results and discussion sample preparation in this study , the processes of harvesting of seeds and oil extraction methods were developed and optimized .
brebra is a name given to millettia ferruginea in amharic .
this amharic name was literally inherited from behavior of the mechanism of seed dispersal nature , which is the seed mechanically dispersed about 20 meters in average far from the tree in explosive manner .
this nature of seed dispersal mechanism poses a problem for seed harvesting .
to overcome harvesting problem , the matured pale yellow pods were collected from the tree and covered with teff straw for certain period of time to accomplish its maturity .
after maturation , the pods were put into a fiber sac to facilitate aeration and dried there in the sac and lastly released seeds collected in the sac .
fiber sac can provide free ventilation of air in order to avoid deterioration of seed quality by fungi .
this method was originally adopted from the society .
it is well known that millettia ferruginea contains a chemical compound that is found to be toxic for fish is known as rotenone ( dagne et al .
1990 ) , which is widely used by the society for fishing .
the society was collected the seeds and pods of the tree for fishing by the method already mentioned above .
out of 100 kg of dry pods with seeds , 25 kg ( 25 %) seed was harvested. from an average sized tree , about 150 kg of pods containing seeds can be harvested. from a single tree it is possible to produce 37.5 kg seeds. from one hectare of land in average it is possible to plant about 35 trees .
therefore , from one hectare land one can harvest 1350 kg dry weight of seeds .
the whole process of harvesting and extraction of oil is shown on figure 1 .
pure oil was extracted by the help of co - solvent amended ( hexane and ethanol ) techniques .
ethanol was employed to remove any polar residues from oil .
ethanol soluble phospholipids , proteins and other polar substances in the oil were moved to the ethanol phase and pure oil remains in the hexane phase .
both solvents were recovered from their perspective mixture by means of rota vapor .

proximate composition table 1 presents the result of the proximate chemical composition (% dry weight ) of brebra seed .
the results reveal brebra seed as an oilseed with a potential of high oil and protein content to satisfy calorie and protein demand of the populations .
the extracted brebra oil with the average of 48.5 % is in close agreement with the average value of 49.5 % melon oil seeds ( lge et al .
1984 ) , 48.1 % pumpkin seed ( fagbemi & oshodi , 1991 ) , 48.9 % conophornut ( enujiugha 2003 ) , 49.1 % cashew nut ( akinhanmi , et al .
2008 ) , 50 % castor seed , 50 % sesame seed , but is higher than crambe abyssinica oil seed , 45.4 ( massoura et al .
1996 ) , 42 % groundnut kernel , 37 % rapeseed , 36 % palm kernel , 35 % mustard , 32 % sunflower , 20 % palm fruit , 13 % cotton seed and 23.5 % soybean ( paul and southgate 1980 ) .
the very high oil content suggests that brebra can be used as potential source of raw material for commercial activities .
in brief , it can serve as feedstock for production of biodiesel , glycerol , soap and economically important materials , but not as nutrition at this level unless further investigation is carried to remove mild toxic substance , rotenone .

the amount of crude protein in brebra seed was 29.7 % , which was higher than protein rich foods such as quinoa ( ogungbenle et al .
2009 ) , bambara groundnut ( yagoub and abdalla 2007 ) , cowpeas ( ragab et al.2004 ) , seeds ranging between 13.5 - 26.8 % .
moreover , chick beans , 19.4 % , lima bean , 19.8 % ( fao , 1982 ) , crambe abyssinica , 25.1 % ( massoura et al. 1996 ) , pea , 20.1 % , ( sumner et al. 1980 ) and cashew nut , 25.5 % ( aremu et al .
2006 ) , kidney beans , 20.9 % and lentils , 22.9 % ( perez - hidalgo et al.1997 ) have less amount of proteins in comparison with that of brebra seed flour protein .
on the other hand , the amount of brebra seed protein is almost equal to conophor nut , 29.1 % ( enujiugha 2003 ) , jack bean , 30.8 % ( anonymous 1972 ) , canaralia cathartica , 31.2 % ( seena and sridhar 2006 ) and roselle ( 32.3 %) ( mohammed et al .
2007 ) but less than lenti , 33.4 % ( suliman et al.2006 ) , cataralia maritime , 34.1 % ( seena and sridhar 2006 ) , ashew nut , 36.3 % ( akinhanmi et al .
2008 ) , soybeans , 37 % ( messina 1997 ) and barbados , 48.1 % ( yusuf et al. 2007 ) .
this high quantity of protein can serve as media for microorganisms , fed for animals and even can serve as human food after detailed investigation .
the value obtained for carbohydrate ( 11.92 %) in this study is incomparable with an acceptable range of values of legumes , 20 - 60 % of dry weight ( arkroyed and doughty 1964 ) but almost equal to carbohydrate content of conophor nut ( enujiugha 2003 ) and even greater than cashew nut ( akinhanmi et al. 2008 ) .
this result thus gave us indication that the energy source is largely oil and in some extent protein ( through deamination ) .
the calculated metabolizable energy value ( 6.03 / kcal / g ) is higher than 3.12 kcal / gm in c. palcherria seed , 4.49 kcal / gm in g. affricanum seeds ( ekop 2007 ) and 5.46 kcal / gm in fish citharinun citharus reported by ( abdullahi 1999 ) in nigeria .
the energy content of barbados ( 3.12 kcal / gm ) was smaller than brebra seed flour energy content yusuf et al .
( 2007 )) .
according to this finding , brebra seed has concentrated energy supply in comparison with the above reported energy sources .
the moisture value of the oil in this study which was 4.24 % is somehow low when compared with the value of moisture of legumes ranging between 5.0 % and 11 % reported in the literatures ( aremu et al. 2006 ; lge et al. 1984 ) .
ash content of brebra seed , which is an indicator for mineral elements , in this study was 3.24 % , which is closely comparable with ash values of 3.68 % , 3.22 % and 3.56 % reported for pigeon pea , lima bean and lablab bean , respectively ( aletor and aladetimi 1989 ) .
it has been recommended by pomeranz and clifto ( 1981 ) that ash contents of seeds and tubers should be in the range 1.5 - 3.5 % in order to be suitable for animal feeds .
in this case , the ash content of this study fall within this range hence it can be recommended for animal feeds and human consumption as well as it can serve as microbial media without mineral supplement .
the dry matter and organic matter content of brebra seed flour were 95.8 % and 92.52 % , respectively .
these show that the seed flour contains high amount of organic matter .
the amount of rotenone of the seed was 0.701 +/ - 0.02 % .
it can be used as insect pesticide if production and application method is developed .
table 2 depicts the amino acid composition of brebra seed .
glutamic acid ( 18.62 g / 100 g ) was the most predominant amino acid followed by aspartic acid ( 6.43 g / 100 g ) , leucine ( 2.98 g / 100 g ) , and lysine ( 1.79 g / 100 g ) .
the values of amino acids showed that cysteine and methionine were in the lowest levels .
on the other side , essential amino acids represented 11.88 g / 100 g , while nonessential amino acids represented 32.12 g / 100 g and e / n ratio was 0.37 .
total amino acids of brebra ( 44.0 g / 100 g ) are greater than soybean total amino acids ( 36.62 g / 100 g ) .
however , total essential amino acids of soybean ( 13.52 g / 100 g ) are greater than brebra seed essential amino acids ( 11.88 g / 100 g ) .

amino acid profile of brebra seed protein was compared with the well - known amino acid composition of soybean .
total amino acid composition of brebra is far greater than the total amino acids of soybean ( usda nutrient database 2010 ) .
it is rich in both essential and non - essential amino acids .
as most edible legumes ( bhagya et al. 2007 ) , lysine of brebra seed is higher than sulphur amino acids ( cystine and methonine ) .
since brebra seed is rich in content of amino acids , it can use as a potential source of protein for human being .
mineral composition table 3 shows the mineral content of brebra seed .
the abundant minerals were phosphorus ( 1062.1 +/ - 0.3 mg / 100 g ) , potassium ( 281 +/ - 0.1 mg / 100 g ) , magnesium ( 112.38 +/ - 0.1 mg / g ) , sodium ( 93.26 +/ - 0.1 mg / g ) and calcium ( 61.55 +/ - 0.01 mg / g ) .
all the mineral elements measured were found to be higher than conophor nut , cashew nut , and bean seeds ( table 3 ) ( akinhanmi et al. 2008 ; aremu et al. 2006 ) .

2008 , *** bhagya et al .
2006. in addition to its high protein content , brebra seed contains a high concentration of minerals , especially phosphorus , potassium , magnesium sodium and calcium .
the mineral content of brebra seed is in general higher than those reported for other legumes ( akinhanmi et al. 2008 ; aremu et al. 2006 ) as mentioned above .
it has a potential to supply sufficient amount of minerals for consumers and microbial media for microorganisms .
antinutritional factors antinutritional components of brebra seed is summarized in table 4 .
the presence of antinutritional factors in the sample is of significant importance since they are some deleterious effects on both humans and other animals , for instance , oxalate is a chelating agent , which binds calcium very effectively .
plants with high oxalate content may produce acute metabolic calcium deficiency ( hypocalcemia ) when we use plant product as a main food source ( checke and shull , 1985 ) .
the concentration of oxalate ( 22.97 mg / 100 gm ) in the seed in this investigation seems to be on the low side when compared to reported values in some crop seeds ( umoren et al. 2005 ) .
table 4 the antinutritional factors of brebra seed flour component mean +/ - s.d ( mg / 100 gm ) tannin 84.3 +/ - 0.89 cyanide b.d.l oxalate 20.97 +/ - 0.36 phytic acid 291.62 +/ - 0.87 b.d.l = below detection limit .
tannin is known to evoke growth - depressing effects in rats .
in this study , the tannin level ( 84.3 mg / 100 gm ) was found to be relatively high in comparison with tannic acid found in some literatures ( akinyede et al. 2005 ; enujiugha 2003 ; umoren et al. 2005 ) .
however , the tannin content of this study is less than the tannin content of some dry bean seed varieties ( 930 mg / 100 gm ) ( deshpande et al. 1986 ) .
the tannin amount in this study may not be as such harmful as expected for consumption .
high amount of tannins are well known to form complex with proteins and reduced the solubility of proteins and make protein less susceptible to proteolytic attack than the same proteins alone ( carbonaro et al. 1996 ) .
however , relatively some amount of tannin , like this finding , may have a potential role as protective factors against free radical mediated pathologies , such as cancer and atherosclerosis , in humans ( kehrer 1993 ) .
according to bawadi et al .
( 2005 ) report , water - soluble condensed tannins extracted from black beans inhibited the growth of mcf - 7 , caco - 2 colon , and hs578t breast as well as du 145 prostatic cancer cells .
other findings , associating polyphenols ( including tannins ) to free radicals scavenging and metal chelating activities , suggested their potentially beneficial implications in the treatment and prevention of cancer ( hangen and bennin 2002 ) .
cyanogenic glycoside contents of legume seeds have been investigated .
according to liener ( 1977 ) report , total cyanide values for different legumes such as cowpea , lima bean , field pea , kidney bean , chicken pea and pigeon pea , were 2.1 , 210 - 312 , 2.3 , 2.0 , 0.8 and 0.50 mg / 100 gm , respectively .
about 0.40 mg / 100 gm of cyanogenic glycoside from milletia obanensis was also reported by umoren et al .
( 2005 ) .
in this study , the cyanide content was found to be below detectable level .
in terms of cyanide content , brebra seed flour is safe to use as food for both humans and other animals .
in summary , the antinutritional content of brebra seed flour is not out of the range value of different legumes seeds and other crops reported by other literatures .
physicochemical characterization of oil the physicochemical properties of brebra are shown on table 5 .
oil is clearer brown yellow in colour and less viscous , 40.59 ctm at 40degreesc than cold break seed oil of 57.5 ctm at the same temperature ( catarelli et al. 1993 ) .
it has density and specific gravity of 0.942 and 0.926 at 20degreesc , respectively .
the specific gravity of this study is lower than the specific gravity of cashew nut ( 0.964 ) ( aremu et al. , 2006 ) and caster seed oil ( 0.958 ) ( akpan et al. 2007 ) .
the refractive index of this study ( 1.473 ) is in close agreement with 1.465 ( aremu et al .
2006 ) , 1.462 ( akintayo and bayer 2002 ) and 1.468 ( akpan et al .
2007 ) of castor , akee pulp and cashew nut seed oils , respectively .
this implied that brebra oil is less thicker than most of drying oils whose refractive indices range from 1.475 to 1.485 ( duel and tr 1951 ) .
table 5 brebra oil chemical and physical characteristics oil physicochemical characteristics unit values colour pale - yellow color limpid liquid density at 20degreesc kg / m3 0.942 specific gravity at 20degreesc kg / l 0.926 kinematic viscosity at 40degreesc mm2 / s 40.59 acid value mg koh / g 0.39 ph value 6.38 saponification value mg koh / g 174.95 refractive index at 40degreesc 1.473 iodine value gi2 / 100 gm 104.48 peroxide value meq / kg 6.88 ester value 174.56 all values are mean value of triplicates .
the saponification value of the oil in this study was 174.95 mg koh / gm. this was lower than the values for some common oils like castor seed oil ( 185.83 ) ( akpan et al .
2007 ) , palm oil ( 196 - 205 mgkoh / g ) , groundnut oil ( 188 - 196 mgkoh / g ) , corn oil ( 187 - 196 mgkoh / g ) as reported by akinhanmi et al .
( 2008 ) , coconut oil ( 253 mg koh / gm ) and palm kernel oil ( 247 mg koh / gm ) ( pearson , 1976 ) .
however , this saponification value is within the same range of some edible oils reported by eromosele and paschal ( 2002 ) .
moreover , saponification value ( 174.95 ) of the oil in this investigation is almost within the range of ( 175 - 187 ) astm ( 2002 ) specification for oils .
according to pearson ( 1976 ) , oils with lower saponification values contain high amount of long chain fatty acids .
therefore , the value obtained for brebra seed oil contained high quantity of higher fatty acids ( as it is presented on table 6 , fatty acids >= 18 carbon chain accounts 92.8 %) .
the value of viscosity of brebra oil was 40.49 mm2 / s ( as mentioned above ) is found to be less than the viscosity of cashew nut oil ( 56 mm2 / s ) ( akinhanmi et al. 2008 ) .
for production of biodiesel , therefore , transesterification reaction is the best method to reduce the viscosity of the oil .
the oil under investigation has very low acid value of 0.39 mg koh / g when compared with cashew nut oil ( 0. 82 mg koh / g ) ( aremu et al .
2006 ) , refined castor oil ( 0.869 ) and crude castor oil ( 1.148 ) ( akpan et al .
2007 ) , plukenetia conophoora ( 11.5 mg koh / g ) as reported by akintayo and bayer ( 2002 ) , aenniseed ( 47.6 %) by ohsodi ( 1992 ) .
the acid value in this oil is below the maximum limit ( 2.0 mg koh / g ) of din en iso 660 and nearly within the range of astm specification ( 0.4 - 4.0 ) of castor oil ( astm 2002 ) .

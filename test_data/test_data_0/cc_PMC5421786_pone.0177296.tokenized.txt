adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) is a rare and progressive neurogenetic disease that may manifest disparate symptoms .
the present study aims at investigating the role of ataxic variant of ald ( avald ) in patients with adult - onset cerebellar ataxia , as well as characterizing their clinical features that distinguish avald from other cerebellar ataxias .
mutations in the atp binding cassette subfamily d member 1 gene ( abcd1 ) were ascertained in 516 unrelated patients with ataxia .
the patients were categorized into three groups : molecularly unassigned hereditary ataxia ( n = 118 ) , sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions ( n = 296 ) , and sporadic ataxia without autonomic dysfunctions ( n = 102 ) .
brain mris were scrutinized for white matter hyperintensity ( wmh ) in the parieto - occipital lobes , frontal lobes , corticospinal tracts , pons , middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar hemispheres .
two abcd1 mutations ( p.s108l and p.p623fs ) previously linked to cerebral ald and adrenomyeloneuropathy but not avald were identified .
ald accounts for 0.85 % ( 1 / 118 ) of the patients with molecularly unassigned hereditary ataxia and 0.34 % ( 1 / 296 ) of the patients with sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions .
wmh in the corticospinal tracts and wmh in the cerebellar hemispheres were strongly associated with avald rather than other ataxias .
to conclude , ald accounts for approximately 0.39 % ( 2 / 516 ) of adult - onset cerebellar ataxias .
this study expands the mutational spectrum of avald and underscores the importance of considering ald as a potential etiology of cerebellar ataxia .

introduction cerebellar ataxia comprises a heterogeneous group of diseases including hereditary ataxia , sporadic degenerative ataxia and acquired ataxia with exogenous etiologies , i.e. intoxication with alcohol or toxins and paraneoplastic syndrome [ 1 , 2 ] .
making diagnosis in patients with a chronic progressive ataxia is clinically challenging since different ataxia diseases may have overlapping phenotypes and heterogeneous presentations [ 3 ] .
even after a comprehensive survey , genetic causes in 35 - 50 % of autosomal dominant ataxia and 40 - 46 % of autosomal recessive ataxia remain elusive [ 4 , 5 ] .
hereditary diseases may also manifest as adult - onset sporadic ataxia .
in fact , 2 - 22 % of sporadic cases carry a genetic mutation , most frequently friedreich 's ataxia or spinocerebellar ataxia ( sca ) type 6 [ 6 , 7 ] .
x - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ald ) is often overlooked in the differential diagnosis of adult - onset ataxia .
ald is caused by mutations in the atp - binding cassette subfamily d member 1 gene ( abcd1 ) [ 8 ] .
the clinical manifestations of ald include a rapidly progressive childhood - , adolescence - , or adult - onset cerebral ald , adrenomyeloneuropathy ( amn ) presenting as a progressive paraplegia , and addison 's disease without neurological deficits [ 9 , 10 ] .
the ataxic variant of ald ( avald ) in which clinical phenotype resembles spinocerebellar degeneration was first reported in 1982 [ 11 ] and was later found to account for 1 - 2 % of overall ald [ 10 ] .
to date , only a few avald cases have been reported [ 12 ] and the role of avald in patients with cerebellar ataxia remains unclear .
in the present study , we aimed to determine the frequency and spectrum of abcd1 mutations in a taiwanese cohort of cerebellar ataxia , consisting of patients with hereditary ataxia and those with apparently sporadic ataxia .
clinical and brain mri features of avald patients in this study and in the literature were analyzed to help distinguish avald from other cerebellar ataxias .
nowadays , whole exome sequencing and targeted gene panels including abcd1 become readily accessible in the clinical practice .
the comprehensive description of avald features would be valuable to interpret the clinical significance of unclassified variants identified by high throughput sequencing technologies .
material and methods participants we retrospectively studied 516 patients with cerebellar ataxia who visited the neurology clinic of taipei veterans general hospital between 1999 and 2015 .
study participants included three groups : ( 1 ) hereditary cerebellar ataxia , ( 2 ) sporadic cerebellar ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions and ( 3 ) sporadic cerebellar ataxia without autonomic dysfunctions .
patients were categorized as hereditary ataxia if he / she has one or more affected family members either in at least two generations ( autosomal dominant ataxia ) , in siblings ( autosomal recessive ataxia ) , or with consanguinity in parents ( autosomal recessive ataxia ) , or a disease onset before 25 years of age without any family history ( autosomal recessive ataxia ) .
for the 118 unrelated patients with hereditary ataxia , mutations responsible for sca1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 17 , 19 / 22 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 31 , 35 , 36 , dentatorubral - pallidoluysian atrophy ( drpla ) and friedreich 's ataxia had been excluded [ 13 - 15 ] .
mutations for sca5 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 / 16 , 38 , 40 , 41 , 42 , and 43 were not tested in our cohort because these subtypes were rarely identified in asian populations .
patients with a symptom onset later than 25 years of age and having no family history were categorized as sporadic ataxia ( n = 398 ) .
presence of any of the following manifestations , including postural hypotension , impotence , urinary retention , urinary incontinence and constipation , was suggestive of having autonomic dysfunctions .
the presence of postural hypotension was defined by a drop of > 20 mmhg in systolic blood pressure , > 10 mm hg in diastolic blood pressure or both during the tilting table test .
sca1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 17 and friedreich 's ataxia had also been excluded in these patients with sporadic ataxia .
all participants were of han chinese descent and , prior to participating in the study , had given written informed consent that was approved by the institutional review board of the taipei veterans general hospital .
mri features brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the 516 patients were carefully reviewed .
axial mr brain images encompassing the entire cerebrum and cerebellum were acquired using a 1.5 - t mr unit ( signa , ge medical systems , milwaukee , wi , usa ; magnetom , siemems , erlangen , germany ) .
atrophy in the brainstem and cerebellum as well as global atrophy were evaluated on t1 - weighted images .
white matter hyperintensity ( wmh ) on t2 - weighted images or fluid attenuation inversion recovery ( flair ) images was assessed in [ 16 , 17 ] : ( 1 ) the parieto - occipital lobes and the splenium of corpus callosum , ( 2 ) the frontal lobes and the genu of corpus callosum , ( 3 ) corticospinal projection fibers ( including internal capsules , cerebral peduncles , and basal pons ) , ( 4 ) middle cerebellar peduncles ( mcps ) , and ( 5 ) cerebellar hemispheres including dentate nuclei .
in the pons , a cruciform hyperintensity referred as the " hot cross bun sign " ( hcbs ) and the preceding midline linear hyperintensity were also assessed [ 18 , 19 ] .
mutation detection and in silico prediction genomic dna was isolated from the peripheral blood leukocytes following a standard protocol .
the exons of abcd1 were amplified by pcr using intronic primers ( s1 table ) .
both the sense and antisense strands of all the amplicons were sequenced using the big dye 3.1 dideoxy terminator method with an abi prism 3700 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) .
the amplicon sequences were compared against the published human abcd1 sequence ( refseq accession number nm _ 000033.3 ) in the national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) database ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) .
polymorphism phenotyping program version 2 [ 20 ] and mutation taster algorithm [ 21 ] were used to in silico predict the biological impact of the identified variants of abcd1 .
phylogenetic conservation of the missense variant was estimated by aligning the amino acid sequences from several species ( retrieved from the entrez protein database of the ncbi ) using clustalx2.012 [ 22 ] .
clinical evaluation of patients with avald clinical data , including the age at symptom onset ( ao ) , disease duration , family history , autonomic dysfunctions , psychiatric symptoms ( e.g. personality and mood changes ) , cognitive decline , alopecia , hyperpigmentation and visual impairment , were obtained from our ald patients .
global cognitive performance was assessed using the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) [ 23 ] .
motor and sensory nerve conduction studies ( ncs ) were conducted to evaluate the peripheral nervous system involvement .
plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) and cortisol concentrations were measured .
abnormal plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids ( vlcfa ) were defined as increased c26:0 / c22:0 and c24:0 / c22:0 ratios .
among the 37 cases with avald in the literature [ 12 , 17 , 24 - 38 ] , brain mri information was available in 18 individuals .
clinical data , brain mri features regarding the wmh in the corticospinal tracts and cerebellar hemispheres , plasma vlcfa levels and mutations in abcd1 were also obtained from the literature review .
results identification of abcd1 mutations in our cohort of patients with ataxia among the 516 unrelated ataxic patients , one missense mutation ( c.323c > t , p.s108l ) and one splice site mutation ( c.1866 - 10g > a , p.p623fs ) in abcd1 were identified in one index patient each ( fig 1a and 1b ) .
patient a - ii - 1 , who carried the p.s108l mutation , was previously diagnosed as hereditary cerebellar ataxia , while patient b - ii - 2 harboring the p.p623fs mutation was categorized into the group of sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions ( fig 2 ) .
in our cohorts , ald accounted for 0.85 % ( 1 / 118 ) of molecularly unassigned hereditary ataxia and 0.34 % ( 1 / 296 ) of sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions or 0.25 % ( 1 / 398 ) of all patients with sporadic ataxia .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0177296.g002 fig 2 the algorithm of patient classification .
the p.s108l mutation occurs at an evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid residue ( fig 1c ) , and the splice site mutation ( c.1866 - 10g > a , p.p623fs ) causes a frameshift of the coding sequence disrupting the atp - binding cassette domain of abcd1 .
in the literature , nine mutations in abcd1 had been identified in patients with avald ( fig 1d ) [ 12 , 26 - 29 , 31 , 32 , 38 ] .
although the mutations p.p623fs and p.s108l had been previously reported in patients with ald ( http :// www.x - ald.nl /) , they manifested as cerebral ald or amn rather than ataxia ( s2 table ) [ 39 - 42 ] .

soon afterward , he developed postural hypotension , impotence , urinary incontinence , scanning speech , dysphagia , as well as impairment of cognitive functions and visual acuity .
neurological examination revealed a wide - based gait and clumsiness at rapid - alternative movements of the hands , saccadic pursuits , generalized brisk deep tendon reflexes , and extensor plantar responses .
his muscle tone was normal without spasticity , and there was no sensory deficit .
he had premature baldness and skin hyperpigmentation and was diagnosed to have adrenal insufficiency with a markedly elevated plasma acth level ( 1183 pg / ml ; normal < 46 ) and a normal cortisol level ( 6.9 ug / dl ; normal range : 3.7 - 19.4 ) .
plasma levels of vlcfa were elevated ( table 1 ) .
patient a - ii - 1 's mother ( a - i - 1 , fig 1a ) had a mild dysarthria without cognitive dysfunctions or gait difficulty .
patient a - ii - 2 had a depression and mild cognitive decline since age 30 and developed ataxic symptoms and autonomic dysfunctions since age 40 .
the other manifestations of patient a - ii - 2 included dysarthria , dysphagia , visual disturbance and autonomic dysfunctions .
patient a - ii - 3 had also suffered from a visual impairment and died at age 9 .
both patients ( a - ii - 1 , a - ii - 2 ) are hemizygous for c.323c > t ( p.s108l ) abcd1 mutation and the mother ( a - i - 1 ) is a heterozygote for the mutation .
brain mri of a - ii - 1 and a - ii - 2 demonstrated wmh in the corticospinal projection fibers extending from the corona radiate to the posterior limbs of the internal capsules ( fig 3a and 3b ) .
there were also wmh in mcps , cerebellar hemispheres , dentate nuclei , as well as hcbs in the pons .
cervical cord mri of patient a - ii - 1 did not reveal any abnormality ( fig 3d ) .
patient b - ii - 2 presented with a progressive dysarthria and gait disturbance since age 29 years .
his clinical manifestations resembled those of patient a - ii - 1 ( table 1 ) and had a poor academic performance at school since adolescence .
besides , he also had a skin hyperpigmentation , adrenal insufficiency , and elevated plasma vlcfa levels ( table 1 ) .
he was found to carry a c.1866 - 10g > a ( p.p623fs ) mutation in abcd1 .
although his mother ( b - i - 1 ) and one ( b - ii - 1 ) of his elder sisters were later found to carry the heterozygous c.1866 - 10g > a ( p.p623fs ) mutation , they had remained asymptomatic .
brain mri of the patient b - ii - 2 featured wmh in the posterior limbs of the internal capsules , cerebral peduncles , and cerebellar dentate nuclei ( fig 3c ) .
spinal cord mri revealed a mild atrophy of the thoracic spinal cord ( fig 3e ) .
clues to identify ald in patients with ataxia we were wondering if any clinical or mri features could serve to heighten the suspicion of ald in patients with ataxia .
the clinical and image characteristics were compared between patients with avald and other ataxia patients without abcd1 mutations ( table 2 ) .
among all the clinical and image features , wmh in the corticospinal tracts and wmh in the cerebellar hemispheres were much more prevalent in avald ( 100 % and 100 % , respectively ) than in other ataxias ( 13.6 % and 10.1 % , respectively ) .
the two avald patients had wmh in both the corticospinal tracts and cerebellum hemispheres .
for patients with other etiologies of ataxia in this study , only one fifth of them had wmh either in the corticospinal tracts or in the cerebellar hemispheres and they rarely had wmh in both regions ( table 2 ) .

among those 18 cases , the diagnosis of ald was ascertained by elevated plasma levels of vlcfa in 17 and the presence of abcd1 mutations in 9 .
all of them are males .
the average ao was 30.4 +/ - 7.8 years ( 20 - 47 ) .
a positive family history was reported in only 53.3 % of the patients , and autonomic dysfunctions were found in a half of them .
wmh in the corticospinal tracts and cerebellum were found in 72.2 % and 70.6 % , respectively. of note is that there was a high concordance rate for the presence of wmh in these two regions ( 76.5 % in literature cases and 100 % in the present study ) .
among the 18 literature cases of avald , up to 82.4 % fulfilled at least one of the two diagnostic hints ( the presence of wmh in the corticospinal tracts or cerebellar hemispheres ) , supporting the feasibility of this " red flag " to distinguish avald from other ataxic patients .
approximately 58.8 % of them had wmh in both the corticospinal tracts and cerebellar hemispheres .

the two abcd1 mutations ( p.s108l and p.p623fs ) , previously reported to be linked to cerebral ald and amn [ 39 - 42 ] , were reported for the first time in patients predominantly manifesting with cerebellar ataxia .
it indicates that abcd1 mutations have a notably heterogeneous manifestations .
the characteristic features of avald include a slowly progressive ataxia with mild limb dysmetria , scanning dysarthria , saccadic pursuits , accompanied by autonomic dysfunctions .
psychiatric symptoms , visual impairment and adrenal insufficiency were also frequently observed .
there was no parkinsonism feature ( such as tremor or rigidity ) , spasticity or sensory deficits .
presence of wmh in the corticospinal tracts and cerebellar hemispheres could be red flags to suggest the possibility of avald in patients with ataxia .
in addition , male gender , family history of affected maternal relatives , autonomic dysfunctions , psychiatric symptoms , skin hyperpigmentation , and adrenal insufficiency are all useful clues to heighten the clinical suspicion of ald .
avald , once regarded as a rare variant and accounting for only 1 - 2 % of ald [ 10 ] , might have been underestimated , at least in the asians [ 43 ] .
in a japanese cohort with 145 ald patients , 13 patients ( 8.4 %) manifested with olivopontocerebellar form [ 43 ] .
similarly , the cerebellar subtype of msa ( msa - c ) are more frequently observed in japan and taiwan than in europe or the united states [ 44 ] .
some environmental or genetic factors might contribute to the higher prevalence of avald in the asians .
in our cohort , ald was found in 0.85 % of patients with molecularly unassigned hereditary ataxia and 0.34 % of patients with sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions .
since 22 % of patients with hereditary ataxia in taiwan have an unassigned genetic diagnosis , avald appears to account for a lower percentage ( 0.19 %) of all hereditary ataxias in comparison to that of sca3 ( 47 %) , sca2 ( 11 %) , sca6 ( 11 %) , sca1 ( 5 %) , sca17 ( 2.7 %) in our population [ 45 ]. of note , avald could masquerade as recessive spinocerebellar ataxia or msa - c , but it is frequently overlooked in the differential diagnosis of hereditary ataxia or adult - onset sporadic ataxia [ 1 , 46 ] .
only two papers had suggested considering ald in x - linked ataxia , especially in those with an ao younger than 50 [ 4 , 47 ] .
ao might not be a reliable clue for avald .
in the literature , the ao for avald ranged from 20 to 54 years [ 12 ] , overlapping with that of most hereditary ataxia ranging between twenties and forties .
an ao beyond 55 might be a hint to favor msa - c rather than avald , in patients with cerebellar ataxia and autonomic dysfunctions [ 6 , 19 ] .
in our cohort , wmh in both the corticospinal tracts and cerebellar hemispheres was observed in avald patients ( 100 % and 100 %) but rarely in patients of sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions ( 11.2 % and 13.9 %) ( table 2 ) .
hcbs , the characteristic features of msa - c [ 48 ] , was common in both patient groups ( 75.3 % and 50 % in sporadic ataxia with autonomic dysfunctions and avald , respectively ) .
in rare instances , as described by ogaki et al. and vianello et al. , the mri of avald patients could only manifest diffuse atrophy without any wmh in the brainstem or cerebellum [ 12 , 38 ] .
in such cases , clinical features , such as endocrinological abnormality , psychiatric symptoms , and autonomic dysfunctions , are important clues .
the results from this study suggest that wmh in the cerebellum or corticospinal tracts is a distinguishing feature to identify ald in patients with ataxia .
however , a large , prospective cohort of avald is needed to validate such association .
in concert with our findings , a 3 - year annual mri follow - up study demonstrated demyelination changes in the dentatorubothalamic tracts and corticospinal tracts in a patient with avald [ 33 ] .
another study with an autopsied case of avald indicated that these cerebellar white matter lesions reflect underlying pathology of myelin rarefaction and perivascular infiltrations of macrophages [ 12 ] , a consequence of toxic accumulation of vlcfa in the oligodendrocytes. of note , the presence of wmh in the cerebellar hemispheres or corticospinal tracts is not specific to avald .
other neurogenetic disorders , such as fragile x - associated tremor / ataxic syndrome , msa - c , wilson 's disease , mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome with mutations in polg , cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis , krabbe disease , and peroxisomal disorders may also manifest with cerebellar ataxia accompanied by wmh in the cerebellum [ 1 , 49 , 50 ] .
a negative family history would not exclude the possibility of ald .
around 50 % of women carrying a heterozygous abcd1 mutation may develop amn - like symptoms after age 40 , and less than 2 % of them may have a cerebral involvement [ 10 ] .
a negative family history or an apparently recessive inheritance but lack of a male - to - male transmission should raise the possibility of x - linked ataxia [ 4 ] .
another reason that family history is not entirely helpful in diagnosis of avald is the high phenotypic variation of abcd1 mutations .
it has been well known that there is poor genotype - phenotype correlation in individuals with abcd1 mutations and the entire ald spectrums could be observed within a pedigree with the same mutation [ 51 ] .
in summary , avald accounts for approximately 0.39 % ( 2 / 516 ) of cerebellar ataxias .
this study expands the mutational spectrum of avald and stresses the importance of considering ald as a potential etiology of cerebellar ataxia , especially in patients with autonomic dysfunctions .
the presence of wmh in the corticospinal tracts or cerebellar hemispheres are important hints to distinguish ald from other ataxias , especially in the scenario of male gender , family history of affected maternal relatives , autonomic dysfunctions , psychiatric symptoms , skin hyperpigmentation , premature baldness and adrenal insufficiency .

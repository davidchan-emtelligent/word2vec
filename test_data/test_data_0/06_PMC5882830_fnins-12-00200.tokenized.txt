alcohol abuse and binge drinking are common during adolescence , a developmental period characterized by heightened neuroplasticity .
animal studies reveal that adolescent ethanol exposure decreases hippocampal neurogenesis that persists into adulthood , but the mechanism remains to be fully elucidated .
using a rodent model of adolescent intermittent ethanol ( aie ; 5.0 g / kg , i.g. , 2 - days on / 2 - days off from postnatal day [ p ] 25 to p55 ) , we tested the hypothesis that aie - induced upregulation of neuroimmune signaling contributes to the loss of hippocampal neurogenesis in adulthood .
we found that aie caused upregulation of multiple proinflammatory toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , increased expression of phosphorylated nf - kappab p65 ( pnf - kappab p65 ) and the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 , and reduced markers of neurogenesis in the adult ( p80 ) hippocampus , which is consistent with persistently increased neuroimmune signaling reducing neurogenesis .
we observed a similar increase of pnf - kappab p65 - immunoreactive cells in the post - mortem human alcoholic hippocampus , an effect that was negatively correlated with age of drinking onset .
voluntary wheel running from p24 to p80 prevented the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis markers ( i.e. , nestin and doublecortin ) in the adult hippocampus that was paralleled by blockade of increased expression of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 .
wheel running also prevented the aie - induced increase of hippocampal pnf - kappab p65 and induction of neuroimmune nf - kappab target genes , including tnfalpha and ikappabalpha in the adult brain .
administration of the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin during aie prevented the loss of neurogenesis markers ( i.e. , nestin and doublecortin ) and the concomitant increase of cleaved caspase 3 , an effect that was accompanied by blockade of the increase of pnf - kappab p65 .
similarly , administration of the proinflammatory tlr4 activator lipopolysaccharide resulted in a loss of doublecortin that was paralleled by increased expression of cleaved caspase 3 and pnf - kappab p65 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of con animals that mimicked the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis .
taken together , these data suggest that exercise and anti - inflammatory drugs protect against adolescent binge ethanol - induced brain neuroimmune signaling and the loss of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus .

adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been implicated in cognitive and emotive processes ( see e.g. , madsen et al. , 2003 ; revest et al. , 2009 ) .
it is a dynamic process that is increased by exercise and environmental enrichment ( van praag et al. , 2005 ) while also being decreased by pathological insults ( richardson et al. , 2007 ) and drugs of abuse ( nixon and crews , 2004 ; he et al. , 2005 ) .
preclinical rat studies reveal that hippocampal neurogenesis is more sensitive to ethanol - induced inhibition during adolescence ( crews et al. , 2006 ) , a stage of life in humans associated with high levels of binge drinking ( white et al. , 2006 ; johnston et al. , 2013 ) .
previous adult rat studies have found that binge ethanol exposure results in a transient loss of hippocampal neurogenesis that is restored following a 30 - day period of abstinence ( nixon and crews , 2004 ; broadwater et al. , 2014 ) , whereas adolescent intermittent ethanol ( aie ) causes a reduction of neurogenesis in the adolescent hippocampal dentate gyrus that persists well into adulthood despite cessation of ethanol exposure ( ehlers et al. , 2013a ; broadwater et al. , 2014 ; vetreno and crews , 2015 ; sakharkar et al. , 2016 ) .
further , aie treatment reduces rodent hippocampal volumes in adulthood ( ehlers et al. , 2013b ; vetreno et al. , 2017 ) , an effect that is also observed in human adolescents with auds ( de bellis et al. , 2000 ) .
a similar loss of neurogenesis has been observed in a non - human primate model of adolescent binge drinking ( taffe et al. , 2010 ) .
these data suggest that identifying the mechanisms underlying the persistent loss of hippocampal neurogenesis following adolescent binge drinking has important implications for understanding the development of aud .
while the mechanism underlying the aie - induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis remains to be elucidated , converging evidence implicates the neuroimmune system as contributing to altered neurogenesis ( whitney et al. , 2009 ; mathieu et al. , 2010 ) .
systemic administration of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide , a ligand for the proinflammatory pattern recognition receptor toll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) , reduces hippocampal neurogenesis in adult mice ( monje et al. , 2003 ) while neurogenesis is increased in tlr4 knockout mice ( rolls et al. , 2007 ) .
in hippocampal - entorhinal cortex slice culture , ethanol exposure reduces neurogenesis , and increases expression of nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells ( nf - kappab ) , the canonical innate immune gene transcription factor as well as several proinflammatory cytokine target genes , including il - 1beta , tnfalpha , and mcp - 1 ( zou and crews , 2010 , 2012 , 2014 ) .
inhibition of nf - kappab target genes in hippocampal - entorhinal cortex slice culture prevents ethanol - induced loss of neurogenesis ( zou and crews , 2012 ) .
other studies find that exposure of cultured neuroprogenitor precursor cells to proinflammatory cytokines reduces neurogenesis through increased progenitor cell death ( monje et al. , 2003 ; guadagno et al. , 2013 ) .
previous studies also find aie induces adult hippocampal proinflammatory nf - kappab target genes , including mcp - 1 and tnfalpha ( vetreno and crews , 2015 ) .
these data support the hypothesis that aie induction of neuroimmune signaling contributes to the persistent loss of adult neurogenesis .
emerging studies find that ethanol induction of neuroimmune signaling is linked to induction of multiple neuroimmune signaling genes , including proinflammatory cytokines and their receptors , cyclooxygenase ( cox ) , and toll - like receptors ( tlr ) , their endogenous agonists as well as their signaling proteins , most of which converge on nf - kappab .
this large number of neuroimmune signaling molecules induced by ethanol creates uncertainty in efforts to select antagonists .
aerobic exercise has repeatedly been found to recover ethanol inhibition of neurogenesis in the adult rodent hippocampus ( crews et al. , 2004 ; leasure and nixon , 2010 ; maynard and leasure , 2013 ; ryan and nolan , 2016 ) and improve hippocampal - dependent cognitive functioning in adult humans and rodents ( griesbach et al. , 2004 , 2009 ; hillman et al. , 2008 ; dery et al. , 2013 ) .
we tested the hypothesis that voluntary wheel running exposure from p24 to p80 would prevent the persistent induction of neuroimmune signals and the loss of adult neurogenesis following aie .
we further tested the hypothesis that blocking neuroimmune signals using the non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin during aie would prevent the loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .
in the present study , we report that aie increased adult hippocampal mrna levels of multiple proinflammatory tlrs , increased expression of phosphorylated nf - kappab p65 immunoreactive cells , and increased expression of cleaved caspase 3 , a marker of cell death .
in post - mortem human alcoholic hippocampal tissue , we observed a similar increase of pnf - kappab p65 - immunoreactive cells that was associated with an adolescent age of drinking onset .
exercise and indomethacin treatment prevented the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis , and increased expression of neuroimmune signals and the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 .
these novel findings are consistent with aie causing lasting upregulation of neuroimmune signaling molecules that contribute to the persistent loss of hippocampal neurogenesis in adulthood .
these studies also link the beneficial health effects of exercise to reduced neuroimmune signaling and increased neurogenesis .
methods and materials animals male wistar rats bred and reared at the university of north carolina at chapel hill were used in this study .
on the day following birth ( postnatal day [ p ] 1 ) , litters were culled to 10 pups with six males and four females retained when possible .
pups remained with their dams in standard clear plastic tubs with shavings until group housing with same sex littermates at the time of weaning on p21 .
all animals were housed in a temperature - ( 20degreesc ) and humidity - controlled vivarium on a 12 h / 12 h light / dark cycle ( light onset at 0700 h ) , and provided ad libitum access to food and water .
experimental procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of north carolina at chapel hill , and conducted in accordance with national institutes of health regulations for the care and use of animals in research .
adolescent intermittent ethanol ( aie ) paradigm on p21 , male wistar rats were randomly assigned to either : ( i ) aie or ( ii ) water control ( con ) conditions .
to minimize the impact of litter variables , no more than one subject from a given litter was assigned to a single experimental condition. from p25 to p55 , aie animals received a single daily intragastric ( i.g. ) administration of ethanol ( 5.0 g / kg , 20 % ethanol w / v ) in the am on a 2 - day on / 2 - day off schedule and con subjects received comparable volumes of water .
tail blood was collected from aie - and con - treated subjects to assess blood ethanol concentrations ( becs ) using a gm7 analyzer ( analox ; london , uk ) 1 h after treatment on p38 and p54 .
body weights were assessed through aie to the conclusion of each experiment .
voluntary wheel running to determine if voluntary exercise would prevent the aie - induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis and increased neuroimmune expression in adulthood , con - and aie - treated animals ( n = 8 per group ) were pair - housed on p24 in either standard cages ( no exercise ) or cages containing running wheels ( exercise ) .
all subjects were observed daily for running wheel use and remained in their respective housing conditions 24 h per day .
all groups were housed in pairs as social isolation can counteract the beneficial effects of exercise ( stranahan et al. , 2006 ; leasure and decker , 2009 ) .
the exercise apparatus consisted of specially - designed cages with a running wheel attachment ( nalge designed for minimitter company , sun river , or ) .
dimensions of the fully assembled cage with the running wheel attached was 50 x 26.8 x 36.4 cm. while the running wheels did not contain a tachometer , all rats were observed running daily on the wheels .
mean becs (+/ - sem ) were unaffected by running wheel exposure on either p38 ( aie / no exercise : 170 +/ - 11 mg / dl , aie / exercise : 158 +/ - 7 mg / dl ; one - way anova : p > 0.3 ) or p54 ( aie / no exercise : 180 +/ - 12 mg / dl , aie / exercise : 184 +/ - 15 mg / dl ; one - way anova : p > 0.8 ) .
throughout the experiment , all subjects evidenced dramatic increases in body weight across age ( main effect of age : p < 0.01 ) .
while we did not observe an effect of exercise or treatment on body weight during aie , we found that no exercise con adult ( p80 ) animals weighed approximately 8 % (~ 35 g ) more than subjects in the other conditions .
subjects were sacrificed on p80 and brain tissue collected for assessment of neurogenesis .
anti - inflammatory indomethacin treatment to determine if blockade of neuroinflammation would prevent the aie - induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis , indomethacin ( 4.0 mg / kg , i.p. , sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) was administered to con - and aie - treated animals ( n = 8 per group ) 30 min before treatment on a 2 - day on / 2 - day off schedule .
indomethacin was suspended in 0.1 ml dimethyl sulfoxide and brought to a concentration of 0.8 mg / ml with 0.9 % saline ( ph : 7.4 ) .
since our laboratory previously found that aie reduced neurogenesis in the adolescent hippocampus that persisted into adulthood ( vetreno and crews , 2015 ) , subjects were sacrificed 24 h following the conclusion of aie ( p56 ) and brain tissue collected for assessment of neurogenesis .
lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) treatment protocol to determine if administration of the proinflammatory tlr4 activator lps would diminish hippocampal neurogenesis , and increase expression of cleaved caspase 3 and pnf - kappab p65 , a separate group of con - and aie - treated animals ( n = 8 per group ) received a single injection of lps ( 1.0 mg / kg in sterile 0.9 % saline , i.p. , e. coli , serotype 0111 : b4 ; sigma - aldrich ) or a comparable volume of saline on p70 .
subjects were sacrificed 10 days later on p80 and brain tissue collected for assessment of neurogenesis .
perfusion and tissue collection at the conclusion of each experiment , subjects were anesthetized with a euthanasia dose of sodium pentobarbital ( 100 mg / kg , i.p. ) and transcardially perfused with 0.1 m phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs , ph 7.4 ) .
in the exercise experiments , brain , liver , and spleen samples were collected , rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at - 80degreesc for protein and mrna extraction .
for the immunohistochemistry experiments , subjects were transcardially perfused with 0.1 m pbs ( ph 7.4 ) followed by 4.0 % paraformaldehyde in pbs .
brains were excised and post - fixed in 4.0 % paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4degreesc followed by 4 days of fixation in 30 % sucrose solution .
coronal sections were cut ( 40 mum ) on a sliding microtome ( microm hm450 ; thermoscientific , austin , tx ) , and sections were sequentially collected into well plates and stored at - 20degreesc in a cryoprotectant solution ( 30 % glycol / 30 % ethylene glycol in pbs ) .
immunohistochemistry in animal studies free - floating hippocampal sections ( every 12th section ) were washed in 0.1 m pbs , incubated in 0.3 % h2o2 to inhibit endogenous peroxidases , and blocked with the appropriate normal serum ( mp biomedicals , solon , oh ) .
sections were incubated in a primary antibody solution containing blocking solution , and either goat anti - doublecortin ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca ; cat .
# sc - 8066 ) , rabbit anti - ki - 67 ( abcam , cambridge , ma ; cat .

# sc - 101749 ) , or mouse anti - nestin ( millipore , temecula , ca ; cat. # mab5326 ) for 24 hr at 4degreesc .
sections were then washed with pbs , incubated for 1 h in the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody ( vector laboratories , burlingame , ca ) , and incubated for 1 h in avidin - biotin complex solution ( vectastain abc kit ; vector laboratories ) .
the chromogen , nickel - enhanced diaminobenzidine ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) , was used to visualize immunoreactivity .
tissue was mounted onto slides , dehydrated , and cover slipped .
negative control for non - specific binding was conducted on separate sections employing the abovementioned procedures omitting the primary antibody .
post - mortem human hippocampal tissue samples post - mortem human paraffin sections of the hippocampus from moderate drinking control and alcoholic subjects were obtained from the new south wales tissue resource centre ( nswtrc [ ethnics committee approval number : x11 - 0107 ]) at the university of sydney ( supported by the national health and medical research council of australia - schizophrenia research institute and the national institute of alcohol abuse and alcoholism [ nih ( niaaa ) r24aa012725 ]) .
subject information was collected through personal interviews , next - of - kin interviews , and medical records , and is presented in table 1 .
since establishing an accurate age of drinking onset is critical , trained clinical nurses , and psychologists from the nswtrc performed extensive interviews with the human volunteers and their families .
age of drinking onset was derived from personal interviews with the volunteers as well as medical records and next - of - kin interviews .
in cases where the age of drinking onset was unclear , an age of 25 was recorded ( sheedy et al. , 2008 ) .
alcoholic subjects reported an average age of drinking onset of 17 (+/ - 1 ) , which was compared to age - matched moderate drinking controls whose average age of drinking onset was 25 (+/ - 1 ) .
it is noteworthy that 100 % of alcoholics were able to recall their age of drinking onset whereas only 10 % of moderate drinking controls were able to provide accurate information .
only individuals with alcohol dependence uncomplicated by liver cirrhosis and / or nutritional deficiencies were included in the present study .
all psychiatric and alcohol use disorder diagnoses were confirmed using the diagnostic instrument for brain studies that complies with the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( dedova et al. , 2009 ) .

mean age of drinking onset for moderate drinking controls was 25 (+/ - 1 ) and for alcoholics was 17 (+/ - 1 ) .
alcoholic individuals tended to demonstrate an earlier age of drinking onset in comparison to moderate drinking controls .
human immunohistochemistry paraffin - embedded human post - mortem hippocampal sections were deparaffinized , washed in pbs , and antigen retrieval performed by incubation in citra solution ( biogenex , san ramon , ca ) for 1 h at 70degreesc .
following incubation in normal goat serum ( mp biomedicals ) blocking solution , slides were incubated in a primary antibody solution containing rabbit anti - pnf - kappab p65 ser 276 ( santa cruz biotechnology ) for 24 h at 4degreesc .
slides were incubated for 1 h in biotinylated secondary antibody ( 1:200 ; vector laboratories ) and then for 1 h in avidin - biotin complex solution ( vector laboratories ) .
nickel - enhanced dab ( sigma - aldrich ) was used to visualize immunoreactivity .
slides were dehydrated and cover slipped .
negative control for non - specific binding was conducted employing the above - mentioned procedures with omission of the antibody .
microscopic quantification and image analysis across experiments , bioquant nova advanced image analysis software ( r & m biometric , nashville , tn ) was used for image capture and quantification of immunohistochemistry .
representative images were captured using an olympus bx50 microscope and sony dxc - 390 video camera linked to a computer .
for each measure , the microscope , camera , and software were background corrected , and normalized to preset light levels to ensure fidelity of data acquisition .
immunohistological assessment was performed in the rat dorsal hippocampal dentate gyrus according to the atlas of paxinos and watson ( 1998 ) .
pixel density was used to assess doublecortin immunoreactivity (+ ir ) as it is densely distributed throughout the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus making identification of individual neurons difficult .
pixel density was rigorously thresholded to normalize pixel intensity ( vetreno and crews , 2015 ) .
the threshold for pixel density was determined from control subjects by calculating the average of the darkest and lightest values , and sections were imaged under identical conditions to avoid non - systematic variation ( beynon and walker , 2012 ) .
the outlined regions of interest were determined and pixel density calculated by dividing the pixel count by the overall area ( mm2 ) .
a modified stereological quantification method was used to quantify ki - 67 , cleaved caspase 3 , pnf - kappab p65 , and nestin immunopositive cells in the rat hippocampal dentate gyrus , and pnf - kappab p65 immunopositive cells in the human hippocampal dentate gyrus .
we previously reported that a comparison of unbiased stereological methodology with our modified stereological approach yielded nearly identical values relative to control subjects ( crews et al. , 2004 ) .
the outlined regions of interest were determined and data expressed as cells / mm2 .
brain sections from all groups in each experiment are stained simultaneously to control for differences in antibody lots , dab staining , time after sectioning , and other factors that can affect staining intensity .
thus , absolute immunohistochemical control values ( cell counts and pixel density ) sometimes vary between experiments , however , the relationships across experimental groups remain consistent .
immunofluorescence and colocalization analysis to assess pnf - kappab p65 colocalization , free - floating hippocampal sections were processed similar to previously reported methods ( vetreno et al. , 2013 ; vetreno and crews , 2015 ) .
briefly , sections collected from subjects sacrificed on p56 ( 24 h post - aie ) were washed in 0.1 m tbs , antigen retrieval performed by incubation in citra solution ( biogenex ]) for 1 h at 70degreesc , and blocked with normal horse serum ( mp biomedicals ) .
sections were incubated for 48 h at 4degreesc in a primary antibody cocktail of rabbit anti - pnf - kappab p65 ( santa cruz biotechnology ) with an antibody against immature neurons ( goat anti - doublecortin [ santa cruz biotechnology ]) , microglia ( goat anti - iba - 1 [ abcam ; cat .
# ab5076 ]) , or astrocytes ( goat anti - gfap [ abcam ; cat. # ab53554 ]) .
sections were washed in tbs and incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the secondary antibody cocktail ( alexa fluor 594 and alexa fluor 488 ; invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) .
tissue was mounted onto slides and cover slipped using prolong gold anti - fade mounting media ( life technologies , grand island , ny ) .
immunofluorescent images were obtained using a ds - riz scope ( nikon inc. , melville , ny ) and colocalization quantified using nis elements ar46 ( nikon inc. ) .
rna extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rtpcr ) for assessment of tlr mrna expression , hippocampal samples were collected from adult ( p80 ) con - and aie - treated animals according to the atlas of paxinos and watson ( 1998 ) .
to determine the effect of exercise on aie - induced neuroimmune expression , hemi - sectioned whole brain tissue ( referred to as whole brain hence forth ) and spleen samples were collected from con - and aie - treated animals on p80 .
across experiments , total mrna was extracted from each sample by homogenization in tri reagent ( sigma - aldrich ) following the single - step method of rna isolation ( chomczynski and sacchi , 2006 ) .
total mrna was reverse transcribed as previously described ( vetreno and crews , 2012 ; vetreno et al. , 2013 ) .
syber green pcr master mix ( life technologies , carlsbad , ca ) was used for the rt - pcr .
the real - time pcr was run with an initial activation for 10 min at 95degreesc , followed by 40 cycles of denaturation ( 95degreesc , 15 s ) , annealing / extension ( 57 - 58degreesc , 1 min ) , and finally a melt curve .
the primer sequences are presented in table 2 .
differences in primer expression between groups are expressed as cycle time ( ct ) values normalized with beta - actin , and relative differences between groups calculated and expressed as the percent difference relative to cons .

results adolescent intermittent ethanol treatment causes long - term upregulation of toll - like receptors ( tlr ) in the adult hippocampus emerging studies have found that tlrs are linked to ethanol induction of neuroimmune signaling ( crews and vetreno , 2016 ; crews et al. , 2017 ) .
to determine if aie causes long - term increases in tlr expression , we measured tlr mrna in the adult hippocampus ( p80 ) 25 days after the last binge ethanol exposure .
we found that aie treatment significantly increased mrna expression of tlr1 [ 303 % [+/ - 69 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 10 ) = 8.3 , p < 0.05 ] , tlr2 [ 202 % [+/ - 27 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 10 ) = 12.2 , p < 0.01 ) , tlr4 ( 266 % [+/ - 53 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 10 ) = 9.4 , p < 0.05 ] , tlr5 [ 328 % [+/ - 87 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 10 ) = 6.0 , p < 0.05 ) , tlr6 ( 249 % [+/ - 41 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 10 ) = 10.2 , p < 0.01 ] , tlr7 [ 154 % [+/ - 14 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 10 ) = 9.8 , p < 0.05 ] , and tlr8 [ 341 % [+/ - 71 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 10 ) = 8.6 , p < 0.05 ] , relative to cons ( see figure 1 ) .
levels of tlr3 and tlr9 were unchanged in the adult hippocampus following aie exposure ( both p 's > 0.2 ) .
these data reveal that aie treatment leads to long - term upregulation of proinflammatory tlr expression in the adult hippocampus .
figure 1 adolescent intermittent ethanol ( aie ) treatment upregulated expression of toll - like receptor ( tlr ) genes in the adult hippocampus .
quantitative pcr assessment of tlr mrna in adult ( p80 ) hippocampal tissue samples revealed an approximate 3 - fold increase of tlr1 , tlr5 , and tlr8 , an approximate 2.5 - fold increase of tlr4 and tlr6 , an approximate 2 - fold increase of tlr2 , and an approximate 50 % increase of tlr7 , relative to cons .
we did not observe an effect of aie on mrna levels of tlr3 or tlr9 .

phosphorylated nf - kappab p65 immunoreactivity is increased in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of aie - treated adult rats and post - mortem human alcoholics since aie led to the long - term induction of multiple tlrs and nf - kappab is a common transcription factor target of tlr activation , we next assessed expression of pnf - kappab p65 + ir in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult rats ( p80 ) following aie treatment .
phosphorylated nf - kappab p65 + ir was characterized by darkly stained cell nuclei throughout the dentate gyrus .
analysis of pnf - kappab p65 + ir revealed a significant 40 % (+/ - 12 %) increase in the adult aie - treated animals , relative to cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 14 ) = 8.7 , p < 0.01 ; see figure 2a ] .
colocalization analysis revealed a high degree of pnf - kappab p65 co - expression with doublecortin ( con : 54 % [+/ - 3 %] ; aie : 55 % [+/ - 4 %]) , which did not differ as a function of treatment ( p > 0.8 ) .
interestingly , we found that 26 % (+/ - 3 %) of iba - 1 + ir microglia in the aie dentate gyrus colocalized with pnf - kappab p65 whereas only 8 % (+/ - 2 %) colocalized in the cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 8 ) = 28.3 , p < 0.01 ; see figure 2b ] .
in contrast , we observed minimal gfap colocalization with pnf - kappab p65 in either treatment group .
these data suggest that increased pnf - kappab p65 + ir in the adult hippocampus following aie is associated with increased expression in microglia .

( d ) across subjects , age of drinking onset was negatively correlated with expression of pnf - kappab p65 + ir cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus ( r = - 0.57 , n = 16 , p < 0.05 ) .
moderate alcohol drinking controls tended to report a later age of drinking onset ( 25 +/ - 1 years of age ) relative to individuals that met criteria for alcoholism ( 17 +/ - 1 years of age ) .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , relative to cons .
we next determined whether pnf - kb p65 + ir is increased in the post - mortem human alcoholic hippocampal dentate gyrus .
we found a 160 % (+/ - 53 %) increase of pnf - kappab p65 + ir in the alcoholic dentate gyrus , relative to moderate drinking controls [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 14 ) = 7.4 , p < 0.05 ; see figure 2c ] .
since an earlier age of drinking onset is associated with an increased risk of lifetime alcohol dependence ( gruber et al. , 1996 ; grant and dawson , 1998 ) , we correlated age of drinking onset with pnf - kappab p65 + ir. drinking age was negatively correlated with pnf - kappab p65 + ir ( r = - 0.57 , n = 16 , p < 0.05 ) indicating that an earlier age of drinking onset is associated with increased expression of pnf - kappab p65 + ir in the hippocampus ( see figure 2d .
together , these data suggest that adolescent exposure to alcohol results in a persistent increase in dentate gyrus pnf - kappab p65 + ir in adult aie - treated rats and in human alcoholics .
voluntary exercise prevents the aie - induced loss of progenitor markers and neurogenesis in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus multiple studies have found that ethanol inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis is related to nf - kappab activation , reduced progenitor proliferation , and increased cell death ( crews and nixon , 2009 ) .
to determine if aie combined with voluntary exercise would prevent the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis , we exposed con - and aie - treated animals to running wheels .
expression of the progenitor proliferation marker ki - 67 ( scholzen and gerdes , 2000 ) was characterized by darkly stained clusters of cell bodies within the subgranular zone of the hippocampus .
analysis with a 2 x 2 anova ( treatment [ con vs. aie ] x exercise [ no exercise vs. exercise ]) revealed that aie treatment significantly reduced ki - 67 + ir cells in the adult hippocampus ( main effect of treatment : f ( 1 , 28 ) = 4.2 , p <= 0.05 ) .
while a significant interaction of treatment x exercise was not observed , follow - up analysis revealed a 41 % (+/ - 12 %) reduction of ki - 67 + ir cells in the aie - treated animals , relative to cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 14 ) = 6.8 , p < 0.05 ; see figure 3a ] .
further , we found that wheel running blunted , albeit insignificantly , the aie - induced reduction of ki - 67 + ir ( p = 0.17 ) .
while assessment the progenitor marker nestin ( palmer et al. , 2000 ) with a 2 x 2 anova did not yield a significant interaction , follow - up analyses revealed that nestin expression was reduced by 37 % (+/ - 8 %) in the aie - treated animals , relative to the cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 13 ) = 5.4 , p < 0.05 ; see figure 3b ] .
interestingly , voluntary wheel running prevented the aie - induced loss of nestin + ir cells [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 13 ) = 9.3 , p < 0.01 ] .
thus , voluntary exercise blunted the aie - induced loss of the proliferation marker ki - 67 and prevented the reduction of nestin + ir cells in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus .

we next assessed expression of doublecortin , a microtubule protein expressed by immature dentate gyrus neurons that provides an index of overall neurogenesis ( brown et al. , 2003 ; couillard - despres et al. , 2005 ) .
doublecortin immunoreactivity was characterized by darkly stained cell bodies in the subgranular zone with processes that innervated the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus .
a 2 x 2 anova ( treatment x exercise ) revealed that wheel running significantly increased doublecortin + ir in the hippocampus [ main effect of exercise : f ( 1 , 28 ) = 7.0 , p < 0.05 ] .
post - hoc analysis of the significant treatment x exercise interaction [ f ( 1 , 28 ) = 6.1 , p < 0.05 ] revealed that doublecortin + ir was reduced by 36 % (+/ - 6 %) in the aie - treated animals ( tukey 's hsd : p <= 0.05 ) , relative to cons .
while wheel running alone did not affect doublecortin + ir , exercise combined with aie prevented the loss of doublecortin in the adult hippocampus ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ; see figure 4 ) .
together , these data reveal that wheel running prevents the aie - induced reduction of dentate gyrus progenitor markers and loss of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus .

wheel running prevents the aie - induced increase of cleaved caspase 3 in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus increased progenitor cell death is an important mechanism of ethanol inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis ( crews and nixon , 2009 ) .
assessment of cleaved caspase 3 , a marker of cell death , was characterized by darkly stained cell bodies throughout the hippocampal subgranular zone .
a 2 x 2 anova ( treatment x exercise ) revealed that wheel running significantly decreased cleaved caspase 3 expression in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus [ main effect of exercise : f ( 1 , 28 ) = 46.9 , p < 0.01 ] .
post - hoc analysis of the significant interaction of treatment x exercise [ f ( 1 , 28 ) = 13.4 , p < 0.01 ] revealed that cleaved caspase 3 + ir cells were increased by 34 % (+/ - 5 %) in the aie - treated animals ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) .
further , wheel running alone tended to reduce cleaved caspase 3 + ir , but clearly blocked the aie - induced increase ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ; see figure 5 ) .
thus , exercise prevented the aie - induced increase of cleaved caspase 3 + ir that likely contributes to the prevention of inhibition of hippocampal neurogenesis .

voluntary wheel running prevents the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 + ir and induction of neuroimmune genes in adulthood we next investigated the impact of wheel running exercise on the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 + ir , a marker of transcription activation , and nf - kappab proinflammatory target gene mrna .
analysis of the pnf - kappab p65 data with a 2 x 2 anova ( treatment x drug ) revealed a significant interaction of treatment x exercise [ f ( 1 , 27 ) = 8.6 , p < 0.01 ] wherein pnf - kappab p65 + ir was increased by 40 % (+/ - 12 %) in the aie - treated animals ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) , relative to cons .
further , wheel running alone reduced pnf - kappab p65 + ir ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) in the cons and completely prevented the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 + ir ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ; see figure 6 ) .
interestingly , expression of pnf - kappab p65 + ir across groups was negatively correlated with doublecortin + ir ( r = - 0.61 , n = 28 , p < 0.01 ; see supplementary figure 2a ) and nestin + ir ( r = - 0.45 , n = 29 , p < 0.05 ; see supplementary figure 2b ) consistent with a neuroimmune mechanism contributing to the aie - induced loss of neural progenitors and neurogenesis .
further , pnf - kappab p65 + ir was positively correlated with expression of cleaved caspase 3 ( r = 0.69 , n = 29 , p < 0.01 ; see supplementary figure 2c ) suggesting that an immune mechanism is associated with the increased cell death observed in the hippocampus that is prevented by voluntary exercise .
expression of neuroimmune mrnas in the adult brain were assessed using individual 2 x 2 anovas ( treatment x exercise ) ( see table 3 ) .
analysis of the tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnfalpha ) mrna data revealed a significant interaction [ f ( 1 , 28 ) = 27.6 , p < 0.01 ] such that aie treatment led to a long - term 29 % (+/ - 4 %) increase of tnfalpha mrna in the adult brain , relative to cons ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) while wheel running prevented the aie - induced increase of tnfalpha ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) .
assessment of toll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) mrna revealed a significant interaction [ f ( 1 , 27 ) = 11.6 , p < 0.01 ] wherein aie treatment led to a long - term 25 % (+/ - 7 %) increase of tlr4 mrna in the adult brain , relative to cons ( tukey 's hsd : p <= 0.05 ) .
assessment of toll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) mrna revealed that the aie - induced increase in tlr4 mrna is prevented by wheel running ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ; see table 3 ) .
while assessment of monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( mcp - 1 ) mrna revealed a significant interaction [ f ( 1 , 28 ) = 5.2 , p < 0.05 ] , post - hoc analysis did not reveal an effect of aie or exercise on mcp - 1 mrna .
analysis of nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in b - cells inhibitor , alpha ( ikappabalpha ) mrna revealed a significant interaction [ f ( 1 , 28 ) = 14.1 , p < 0.01 ] such that aie treatment led to a long - term 60 % (+/ - 18 %) increase of ikappabalpha mrna in the adult brain , relative to cons ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) and wheel running prevented the aie - induced increase of ikappabalpha ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.05 ) .
voluntary exercise had little effect alone on the genes assessed in the periphery with the exception of hmgb1 , which is not a nf - kappab target gene and was increased by voluntary exercise in the blood , brain , and liver ( see supplementary figure 1 ) .
thus , wheel running prevented the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus , which might contribute to the beneficial effects of exercise on neurogenesis .

treatment with the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin prevents the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis , increased cell death , and increased phosphorylated nf - kappab p65 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus previous studies have found that the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin ( sung et al. , 2004 ) can block adolescent ethanol - induced inflammatory gene induction , neurodegeneration , and behavioral deficits ( pascual et al. , 2007 ) .
thus , we administered indomethacin during aie ( 4.0 mg / kg , i.p. , 30 min prior to each aie treatment ) and tested the hypothesis that blocking neuroimmune signals during aie would prevent the loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .
we observed an 18 % (+/ - 6 %) reduction of ki - 67 + ir cells in the aie - treated animals ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.05 ) and found that indomethacin did not prevent the loss of ki - 67 + ir cells ( data not shown ) .
assessment of the nestin data with a 2 x 2 ( treatment x drug [ saline vs. indomethacin ]) anova revealed that indomethacin increased expression nestin + ir [ main effect of drug : f ( 1 , 24 ) = 7.8 , p = 0.01 ] .
while we did not observe a significant interaction , follow - up analyses revealed a 30 % (+/ - 5 %) reduction of nestin + ir cells in the aie - treated animals relative to cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 6.1 , p < 0.05 ] , no effect of indomethacin alone , and indomethacin prevention of the aie - induced loss of nestin + ir cells [ f ( 1 , 12 ) = 15.0 , p < 0.01 ; see figure 7a ] .
analysis of the doublecortin data with a 2 x 2 anova did not yield a significant interaction , but follow - up analyses revealed that aie caused a 21 % (+/ - 6 %) reduction of doublecortin + ir in the hippocampal dentate gyrus relative to cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 5.5 , p < 0.05 ] , no effect of indomethacin alone , and indomethacin prevention of the aie - induced loss of doublecortin + ir [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 4.6 , p <= 0.05 ; see figure 7b ] .
assessment of the cleaved caspase 3 data with a 2 x 2 anova revealed that indomethacin reduced expression of cleaved caspase 3 + ir [ main effect of drug : f ( 1 , 24 ) = 6.3 , p < 0.05 ] .
while we did not observed a significant interaction , follow - up analyses revealed that aie led to a significant 66 % (+/ - 24 %) increase of cleaved caspase 3 + ir in the aie animals relative to cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 5.2 , p < 0.05 ] , no effect of indomethacin alone , and indomethacin prevention of the aie - induced increase of cleaved caspase 3 + ir [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 7.4 , p < 0.05 ; see figure 7c ] .
interestingly , cleaved caspase 3 + ir across groups was negatively correlated with expression of doublecortin ( r = - 0.48 , n = 28 , p = 0.01 ) consistent with increased cell death contributing to the reduction of doublecortin + ir. assessment of the pnf - kappab p65 data with a 2 x 2 anova revealed that aie treatment increased expression of pnf - kappab p65 + ir [ main effect of treatment : f ( 1 , 23 ) = 5.0 , p < 0.05 ] .
while we did not observed a significant interaction , follow - up analyses revealed that aie led to a significant 38 % (+/ - 5 %) increase of pnf - kappab p65 + ir in the aie animals relative to cons [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 5.2 , p < 0.05 ] , no effect of indomethacin alone , and indomethacin prevention of the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 + ir [ one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 7.4 , p < 0.05 ; see figure 7d ] .
interestingly , we found that pnf - kappab p65 + ir across groups was negatively correlated with expression of doublecortin ( r = - 0.42 , n = 27 , p < 0.05 ) and nestin ( r = - 0.43 , n = 27 , p < 0.05 ) suggesting that increased expression of pnf - kappab p65 might contribute to the aie - induced reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis .
taken together , the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin prevented the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis and concomitant increase of cleaved caspase 3 and pnf - kappab p65 supporting the hypothesis that neuroimmune inflammatory signaling induced by aie contributes to the loss of adult neurogenesis .
figure 7 indomethacin treatment prevented the adolescent intermittent ethanol ( aie ) - induced loss of neurogenesis markers , the increase of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 , and phosphorylation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells p65 ( phosphorylated [ pnf - kappab p65 ]) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus .

lipopolysaccharide treatment mimicked the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis , increased cell death , and increased phosphorylated nf - kappab p65 in the adult hippocampus to determine if neuroimmune activation recapitulates aie - induced hippocampal neuropathology , a separate cohort of con - and aie - treated rats received a single dose of lps ( 1.0 mg / kg i.p. ) and were sacrificed 10 days later on p80 .
interestingly , lps treatment mimicked some , but not all aie effects on neurogenesis .
consistent with our previous experiments , aie treatment reduced ki - 67 + ir ( 35 % [+/ - 5 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 9.5 , p = 0.01 ) and nestin + ir ( 45 % [+/ - 9 %] ; one - way anova : f ( 1 , 12 ) = 7.8 , p < 0.05 ) cells in the adult hippocampus whereas lps did not alter expression of neural proliferation markers ( i.e. , ki - 67 and nestin ; data not shown ) .
in contrast , assessment of doublecortin using a 2 x 2 ( treatment x drug [ saline vs. lps ]) revealed a significant interaction [ f ( 1 , 128 ) = 6.1 , p < 0.05 ] such that doublecortin + ir was reduced by 49 % (+/ - 5 %) in the aie subjects ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) , 41 % (+/ - 8 %) in the lps alone subjects ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.05 ) , and 41 % (+/ - 12 %) in the aie + lps subjects ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.05 ) , relative to cons ( see figure 8a ) .
similarly , post - hoc analysis of the significant interaction of cleaved caspase 3 [ f ( 1 , 26 ) = 8.7 , p < 0.01 ] revealed that cleaved caspase 3 + ir was increased by 54 % (+/ - 20 %) in the aie subjects ( tukey 's hsd : p <= 0.05 ) , 77 % (+/ - 13 %) in the lps alone subjects ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) , and trended toward an increase in the aie + lps subjects ( 51 % [+/ - 11 %] ; tukey 's hsd : p = 0.06 ) , relative to cons ( see figure 8b ) .
cleaved caspase 3 + ir across groups was negatively correlated with expression of doublecortin ( r = - 0.37 , n = 30 , p < 0.05 ) suggesting that increased cell death is associated with the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis .
as expected , post - hoc analysis of the significant interaction of pnf - kappab p65 [ f ( 1 , 28 ) = 7.0 , p < 0.05 ] revealed that pnf - kappab p65 + ir was increased by 51 % (+/ - 14 %) in the aie - treated animals , relative to cons ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.05 ) .
lipopolysaccharide treatment resulted in a 116 % (+/ - 9 %) and 104 % (+/ - 14 %) increase of pnf - kappab p65 + ir cells in con - ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) and aie - treated ( tukey 's hsd : p < 0.01 ) animals , respectively , relative to cons ( see figure 8c ) .
interestingly , expression of pnf - kappab p65 across groups was positively correlated with cleaved caspase 3 + ir ( r = 0.46 , n = 30 , p = 0.01 ) consistent with a neuroimmune mechanism increasing adult hippocampal dentate gyrus cell death .
taken together , these data support our hypothesis that the inflammagen lps mimics aie induction of hippocampal neuroimmune signaling , increased cell death , and loss of adult neurogenesis .
figure 8 lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) treatment mimicked the aie - induced loss of doublecortin , and increased expression of cleaved caspase 3 and phosphorylation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells p65 ( phosphorylated [ pnf - kappab p65 ]) in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus .

discussion in the present study , we extend our previous findings on aie inhibition of adult neurogenesis with data supporting neuroimmune involvement in the persistent loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .
we report here for the first time that aie treatment , which models human adolescent binge drinking , causes long - term increases of multiple proinflammatory tlr mrnas in the adult ( i.e. , p80 ) hippocampus .
further , using pnf - kappab p65 as an indicator of activation of the nuclear transcription factor target of tlr activation , we report here for the first time increased expression of pnf - kappab p65 + ir in the post - mortem human alcoholic hippocampal dentate gyrus that negatively correlates with age of drinking onset and in aie - treated rats correlated with increased expression of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 .
toll - like receptors and nf - kappab are expressed in multiple cell types ( crews et al. , 2017 ; lawrimore and crews , 2017 ) .
we report here that pnf - kappab p65 + ir colocalized with both immature doublecortin + ir neurons and iba - 1 + ir microglia , with aie increasing the percentage of iba - 1 + ir microglia expressing pnf - kappab p65 consistent with microglial sensitization and increased proinflammatory signaling following aie .
we report here for the first time that exposure to voluntary wheel running from p24 to p80 prevents the aie - induced loss of neurogenic markers ( i.e. , nestin and doublecortin ) , increased expression of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 and pnf - kappab p65 , and induction of neuroimmune nf - kappab target genes , including tnfalpha and ikappabalpha .
these studies add to previously published studies finding that exercise blunts neuroimmune signaling responses to ischemic pathology ( ma et al. , 2013 ) .
we also add to previous studies reporting that the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin blocks adolescent ethanol - induced persistent increase of neuronal death ( pascual et al. , 2007 ) our finding of indomethacin prevention of the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis .
further , we report that lps treatment of rats mimics aie - induced persistent increases in pnf - kappab p65 and the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 as well as the loss of markers of neurogenesis .
taken together , these data support the hypothesis that adolescent binge ethanol - induced upregulation of neuroimmune signaling molecules contributes to the persistent loss of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus ( see figure 9 ) .
figure 9 proposed mechanism of adolescent intermittent ethanol ( aie ) - induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .
adolescent binge ethanol exposure upregulations toll - like receptor ( tlr ) expression in the hippocampus resulting in increased phosphorylation of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells p65 ( phosphorylated [ pnf - kappab p65 ]) .
this in turn results in the induction of neuroimmune signaling molecules , including tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnfalpha ) that activate positive loops of amplification that persist into adulthood ( crews and vetreno , 2016 ) .
the persistent proinflammatory neuroimmune induction results in diminished neurogenesis and increased cell death that persists into adulthood .
importantly , exposure to either voluntary wheel running , which conveys immune - modulatory effects , or treatment with the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin restores hippocampal neurogenesis by preventing the aie - induced increase of cell death ( i.e. , cleaved caspase 3 ) as well as increased phosphorylation of pnf - kappab p65 .
moreover , treatment with the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) mimicked the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis while increasing expression of cleaved caspase 3 and pnf - kappab p65 .
together , these data suggest that increased expression of neuroimmune molecules increases cell death in the hippocampus resulting in the persistent aie - induced loss of neurogenesis .
toll - like receptors are a class of pattern recognition receptor that respond to exogenous and endogenous signaling molecules ( bianchi , 2007 ) by mounting a proinflammatory neuroimmune response .
in the present study , we found that aie led to the long - term upregulation of tlrs 1 - 8 ( with the exception of tlr3 ) in the adult hippocampus .
this study replicates and extends our previous discoveries that aie increases tlr4 mrna in the adult hippocampus ( vetreno and crews , 2015 ) , tlr3 and tlr4 in the adult prefrontal cortex ( vetreno and crews , 2012 ) , and multiple tlr mrnas ( i.e. , tlr1 - tlr8 ) in the adult cerebellum ( crews et al. , 2017 ) .
activation of tlr cascades lead to activation of the nuclear transcription factor nf - kappab ( kawai and akira , 2007 ) .
our findings of increased expression of pnf - kappab p65 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult aie - treated animals and human alcoholics , the latter of which was associated with an earlier adolescent age of drinking onset , is consistent with adolescent alcohol exposure resulting in long - term upregulation of neuroimmune signaling in the hippocampus .
our findings are consistent with previous studies reporting acute aie - induced ( i.e. , 24 h post - aie ) upregulation of pnf - kappab p65 in the mouse cortex that persists into young adulthood ( i.e. , p64 ) ( montesinos et al. , 2016 ) and upregulation of nf - kappab target genes in the post - mortem human alcoholic prefrontal cortex ( okvist et al. , 2007 ) .
while nf - kappab signaling cascades have largely been ascribed to glial cells with a particular emphasis on microglia , nf - kappab p65 is also constitutively expressed in neurons of the hippocampus and cortex ( kaltschmidt et al. , 1994 ) .
in the present study , we found that pnf - kappab p65 was highly co - expressed in immature doublecortin neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus , which is consistent with a role of nf - kappab in plasticity and neurogenesis ( for review , see bortolotto et al. , 2014 ) .
interestingly , we observed a higher incidence of pnf - kappab p65 colocalization in microglial cells of aie - treated animals .
these findings are consistent with aie and human alcoholism causing microglial activation ( he and crews , 2008 ; mcclain et al. , 2011 ; rubio - araiz et al. , 2016 ) .
however , our studies of ethanol induction of multiple proinflammatory nf - kappab target genes , including tnfalpha , il - 1beta , and mcp - 1 suggest that multiple brain cell types are involved in ethanol induction of neuroimmune signaling ( lawrimore and crews , 2017 ; walter and crews , 2017 ) .
interestingly , inhibition of microglial activation with minocycline dose - dependently blocks ethanol - induced proinflammatory cytokine induction ( e.g. , tnfalpha and il - 1beta ; zou and crews , 2014 ) and recovers immunostimulant - induced loss of neurogenesis ( mattei et al. , 2014 ) .
taken together , our observations that aie causes a long - term upregulation of tlrs and pnf - kappab p65 following cessation of ethanol exposure suggests that adolescent ethanol exposure leads to neuroimmune activation that persist into adulthood ( crews and vetreno , 2011 ) and contributes to the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus .
hippocampal neurogenesis is a dynamic process that is elevated in adolescence and declines with age into senescence , and is highly susceptible to modulation of environmental influences .
previous studies have found that voluntary exercise increases neurogenesis in senescent mice ( van praag et al. , 2005 ; gibbons et al. , 2014 ) and following conditioned running in senescent f344 rats ( speisman et al. , 2013 ) .
although we have previously reported that aie inhibition of neurogenesis persists relative to the age - related decline in control animals from youth to mature adulthood ( i.e. , p56 - p220 ) ( vetreno and crews , 2015 ) , we did not find that voluntary exercise increased expression of neurogenesis markers ( i.e. , ki - 65 , nestin , or doublecortin ) or reduced cleaved caspase 3 + ir in young adult cons .
although we have previously reported that aie inhibition of neurogenesis persists relative to the age - related decline in control animals from youth to mature adulthood ( i.e. , p56 - p220 ) ( vetreno and crews , 2015 ) , we did not find that voluntary exercise increased expression of neurogenesis markers ( i.e. , ki - 65 or doublecortin ) in young adult cons .
previous studies from our laboratory in adult mice found that exercise increased levels of neurogenesis in controls and prevented ethanol inhibition of neurogenesis ( crews et al. , 2004 ) .
other studies in mice have found that exercise can increase neurogenesis in controls ( nishijima et al. , 2017 ; sack et al. , 2017 ) .
these data contrast work from klein et al .
( 2016 ) that exercise did not increase expression of doublecortin in exercising control mice and that exercise did not increase ki - 67 in adult rats ( leasure and nixon , 2010 ) .
to our knowledge , our study is the first to assess neurogenesis following adolescent exercise exposure in rats and we found that exercise reduced cleaved caspase 2 , a marker of cell death , and restored the aie - induced loss of doublecortin , ki - 67 , and nestin to control levels .
consistent with our findings of an immunomodulatory effect of exercise , other studies have reported that exercise creates resilience against insults by blunting neuroimmune responses .
for example , ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats increases tlr , nf - kappab , and proinflammatory cytokine gene expression that is blunted by treadmill exercise ( ang et al. , 2004 ; ma et al. , 2013 ) .
this study extends previous findings to show that wheel running blunts the aie - induced loss of the cell proliferation marker ki - 67 , and prevents the loss of the progenitor cell marker nestin and the immature neuron marker doublecortin in the adult hippocampus .
consistent with the present data , wheel running restores neurogenic markers in adult mice exposed to an acute ethanol self - administration paradigm in adulthood ( crews et al. , 2004 ) .
in addition , we found that voluntary exercise prevented the aie - induced increase of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 while blocking the increase of pnf - kappab p65 as well as induction of nf - kappab target genes , including tnfalpha and ikappabalpha in the adult brain .
consistent with a neuroimmune mechanism underlying the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis was our observation that pnf - kappab p65 + ir was negatively correlated with expression of neurogenic markers ( i.e. , nestin and doublecortin ) and positively correlated with expression of cleaved caspase 3. of particular import , exercise prevented the aie induction of ikappabalpha , which is induced by nf - kappab p65 activation in an autoregulatory fashion leading to restoration of intracellular ikappabalpha binding to the p65 subunit and inhibition of nf - kappab activity ( sun et al. , 1993 ) , indicative of long - term activation of the proinflammatory nf - kappab p65 signaling pathway in the aie - treated adult brain .
further , application of recombinant il - 6 or tnfalpha to cultured neuroprogenitor precursor cells reduced neurogenesis marker expression ( i.e. , doublecortin monje et al. , 2003 ) through a process involving increased cell death ( monje et al. , 2003 ; guadagno et al. , 2013 ) .
these data support involvement of the neuroimmune system in the aie - induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis through a process involving increased cell death .
in contrast to our findings in the cns , we did not observe an aie - induced long - term upregulation of immune genes in the periphery ( i.e. , liver , spleen , or serum ) , which is consistent with findings from our laboratory of persistent neuroimmune induction in brain , but not serum or liver , following chronic ethanol exposure or a single dose of endotoxin in adult mice ( qin et al. , 2007 , 2008 ) .
taken together , these data reveal that voluntary exercise prevents the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis and supports the hypothesis of a neuroimmune mechanism underlying the persistent loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .
although the data support exercise prevention of neuroimmune signaling as a mechanism of aie - induced loss of neurogenesis , exercise confers additional beneficial effects to the cns ( e.g. , increased neurotrophins , increased cerebral blood flow ) that may be independent or a primary mechanism related to reversal of the neuroimmune signaling and the persistent loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .
previous studies have found that aie reduces hippocampal brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf )+ ir in ca1 - ca3 , but not dentate gyrus , that was recovered by treatment with a hdac inhibitor and accompanied by restoration of hippocampal neurogenesis ( sakharkar et al. , 2016 ) .
forced exercise in rats has been found to increase hippocampal ngf and the ngf p75 receptor expression ( ang et al. , 2003 ) as well as to reduce neuroimmune gene induction following mcao ischemia ( ang et al. , 2004 ) .
in a study of adolescent rat brain irradiation which is known to increase oxidative stress and innate immune signaling , exercise blunted the loss of neurogenesis and increased expression of bdnf and trka , consistent with other studies findings exercise creates resilience against insults by both increasing trophic and reducing neuroimmune signaling .
while exercise is known to create resilience , the combined tropic and anti - inflammatory actions confound interpretation of mechanism .
to more directly assess the neuroimmune hypothesis , we administered the non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin during aie treatment .
our data extend previous studies showing that indomethacin blocks aie - induced apoptotic dna fragmentation and caspase 3 activity in the rat neocortex , hippocampus , and cerebellum 24 h after the last ethanol treatment in a rat model of aie ( pascual et al. , 2007 ) .
we found that indomethacin treatment blocked the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and prevented the loss of neurogenesis markers ( i.e. , doublecortin and nestin ) as well as the increase of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 .
somewhat surprising was our finding that indomethacin did not prevent the aie - induced loss of the cell proliferation marker ki - 67 .
it is possible that this is due to the anti - proliferative effects of indomethacin and its use as a treatment for various cancers of the cns ( bernardi et al. , 2009 ) .
consistent with our data , monje et al .
( 2003 ) found that indomethacin treatment blocked lps - induced loss of doublecortin in the rat hippocampal dentate gyrus .
in the present study , we also found that activation of the neuroimmune system using the proinflammatory tlr4 activator lps caused a loss of doublecortin , and increased expression of cleaved caspase 3 and pnf - kappab p65 in the hippocampal dentate gyrus that mimics aie .
further , we found that expression of pnf - kappab p65 was positively correlated with expression of cleaved caspase 3 suggesting that neuroimmune activation is associated with increased cell death .
previous studies have found that the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin can block adolescent ethanol exposure - induced inflammatory gene induction , neurodegeneration , and behavioral deficits ( pascual et al. , 2007 ) .
in the present study , we found that indomethacin , which can inhibit nf - kappab activity ( sung et al. , 2004 ) , prevented the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 , the increase of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 , and the loss of hippocampal neurogenesis markers ( i.e. , doublecortin and nestin ) consistent with neuroimmune activation contributing to the aie - induced cell death and loss of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus .
taken together , these data indicate that anti - inflammatory drug treatment blocks and neuroimmune system activation mimics the aie - induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis thereby supporting the hypothesis that neuroimmune signaling contributes to the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis .
although not the focus of the current study , hippocampal neurogenesis is critically involved in cognitive and emotive function ( madsen et al. , 2003 ; mchugh et al. , 2004 ; revest et al. , 2009 ) , and the loss of neurogenesis following aie is associated with behavioral deficits in adulthood ( ehlers et al. , 2013a ; vetreno and crews , 2015 ) .
the present data suggest that interventions aimed at restoring neurogenesis , such as exercise and indomethacin , might lead to the recovery of cognitive dysfunction in adulthood following aie .
indeed , exercise has been shown to recover neurogenesis and cognitive deficits across various animal models of neuropathology ( speisman et al. , 2013 ; gibbons et al. , 2014 ; winocur et al. , 2014 ) .
similarly , indomethacin treatment has been reported to blunt age - related cognitive decline in middle - aged rats ( mcguiness et al. , 2017 ) .
alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis are also observed in human neurodegenerative and psychological disorders ( sierra et al. , 2011 ) , which likely contribute to the cognitive and emotive dysfunction that accompany these conditions ( e.g. , major depressive disorder ) .
despite the limitations associated with measuring neurogenesis in humans , exercise training has similarly been shown to improve hippocampal - dependent memory and prevent age - related cognitive decline in humans ( hillman et al. , 2008 ; dery et al. , 2013 ) consistent with the beneficial effects of exercise on neuroplasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis .
in conclusion , our data support the hypothesis that aie - induced upregulation of neuroimmune signaling contributes to the loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .
adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure leads to long - term upregulation of proinflammatory tlrs in the hippocampus that is accompanied by increased expression of the nuclear transcription factor pnf - kappab p65 and the induction several neuroimmune nf - kappab target genes in the adult brain , including tnfalpha , mcp - 1 , and ikappabalpha .
upregulation of pnf - kappab p65 leads to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines and other neuroimmune signaling molecules ( e.g. , tnfalpha , mcp - 1 ) that lead to further nf - kappab activation following the cessation of ethanol exposure thereby providing support for the establishment of positive loops of neuroimmune signaling in the aie model that persist into adulthood ( crews and vetreno , 2011 ) .
blockade of pnf - kappab p65 expression through exposure to wheel running or administration of the anti - inflammatory drug indomethacin prevented the aie - induced loss of neurogenesis and concomitant increased expression of the cell death marker cleaved caspase 3 .
further , administration of lps , which is a known neuroimmune activator through tlr4 , mimicked the aie - induced increase of pnf - kappab p65 , and loss of hippocampal neurogenesis ( see figure 9 ) .
together , these novel findings implicate proinflammatory pnf - kappab p65 - neuroimmune signaling in the aie - induced loss of hippocampal neurogenesis .

we describe the first diagnostic dinosaur fossil from washington state .
the specimen , which consists of a proximal left femur , was recovered from the shallow marine rocks of the upper cretaceous ( campanian ) cedar district formation ( nanaimo group ) and is interpreted as pertaining to a large theropod on the basis of its hollow medullary cavity and proximally placed fourth trochanter .
the washington theropod represents one of the northernmost occurrences of a mesozoic dinosaur on the west coast of the united states and one of only a handful from the pacific coast of laramidia during the cretaceous .
its isolated nature and preservation in marine rocks suggest that the element was washed in from a nearby fluvial system .
if the femur pertains to a tyrannosauroid , which seems likely given its size and the widespread occurrence of the group across laramidia during late cretaceous times , then it would represent an earlier occurrence of large body size than previously recognized ( complete femur length estimated at 1.2 meters ) .
uncertainty surrounding the latitude of deposition of the nanaimo group ( i.e. , the baja - british columbia hypothesis ) precludes assigning the washington theropod to either of the putative northern or southern biogeographic provinces of laramidia .

introduction the late cretaceous was a time of remarkably high dinosaur diversity worldwide , but especially so in north america [ 1 , 2 ] .
during the cretaceous , a shallow inland sea separated north america into two large landmasses , appalachia to the east and laramidia to the west ( fig 1 ) , with the bulk of dinosaurs recorded from non - marine rocks that were deposited along the eastern margin of laramidia [ 3 ] .
the dinosaurs of laramidia have been considered to form two biogeographic provinces , a northern one represented by the rich fossil record of montana and alberta , and a more poorly understood southern province including localities in utah , new mexico , texas , and coahuila [ 3 - 6 ] , but the reality of these provinces has been challenged [ 7 ] .
in addition , several important dinosaur finds have been made in the marine rocks that represent deposition within the western interior seaway itself ( e.g. , bear paw shale formation , niobrara chalk formation , etc. [ 8 - 12 ]) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0127792.g001 fig 1 geographic overview of late cretaceous dinosaur assemblages from the west coast of laramidia .
the specimen described here was collected from campanian rocks at sucia island ( washington state ) , but these strata were probably deposited at a more southern latitude , perhaps as far south as the ' el gallo ' and la bocana roja formations of baja california , mexico .
see discussion for overview of specific taxa from each formation .
dinosaur assemblage data were gathered from the following sources : matanuska formation [ 13 - 15 ] , northumberland formation [ 16 , 17 ] , cedar district formation [ 16 ] , cape sebastian sandstone [ 2 , 18 ] , chico formation [ 19 , 20 ] , budden canyon formation [ 21 ] , moreno formation [ 22 , 23 ] , point loma formation [ 24 - 26 ] , ladd formation [ 2 ] , rosario formation [ 6 ] , ' el gallo ' formation [ 6 , 22 , 27 - 32 ] , la bocana roja formation [ 33 , 34 ] .
silhouettes modified from images available on wikimedia commons .
compared to the areas in and around the western interior seaway , relatively little is known about vertebrate assemblages , including dinosaurs , from the pacific coast of laramidia .
factors such as its active tectonic margin and high degree of human development have likely conspired to diminish the opportunity for paleontologists to make comparable discoveries .
most of the dinosaurian material from the pacific coast comes from two formations in baja california , mexico and pertains to hadrosaurid , ceratopsian , and ankylosaurian ornithischians , as well as many lineages of theropod saurischians , including tyrannosaurids , ornithomimids , dromaeosaurids , troodontids , and an enantiornithine bird [ 22 , 27 - 31 , 33 - 35 ] .
isolated skeletons and bones of ankylosaurian and hadrosaurian dinosaurs have been discovered in coastal or marine cretaceous rocks in oregon and california [ 2 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 26 , 36 ] , including the nodosaurid ankylosaur , aletopelta coombsi [ 25 ] and the saurolophine hadrosaurid , augustynolophus morrisi [ 23 ] .
enantiornithine and ornithurine birds are known from coastal british columbia [ 17 ] .
a single partial skull of the ankylosaur edmontonia and postcranial elements of a hadrosaur were described from the marine matanuska formation of south - central alaska [ 13 - 15 ] .
here we describe the first dinosaur from washington state and add a new geographic record for campanian theropods from the west coast of north america .

geological setting rocks of the nanaimo group crop out on vancouver island and the gulf islands of canada as well as the nearby san juan islands of washington state [ 37 ] .
they range from santonian to maastrichtian , have been subdivided into 11 formations , and host a diverse invertebrate fossil record including ammonites , baculitids , and inoceramid bivalves upon which a regional biostratigraphy has been developed [ 38 - 43 ] .
the cedar district formation , which lies near the middle of the nanaimo group , was interpreted at sucia island as representing a shallow marine shelf facies by ward et al .
[ 41 ] .
elsewhere the formation includes shales , turbidites , and conglomeratic units that can be difficult to correlate between outcrops scattered within the san juan islands and elsewhere [ 40 ] .
at sucia island , the cedar district formation has been correlated to the upper part of the chron 33r interval and spans the hoplitoplacenticeras vancouverense and baculites inornatus range zones [ 41 , 44 ] .
haggart et al .
[ 45 ] considered the cedar district formation to be upper campanian , whereas ward et al .
[ 41 ] , who used an updated biostratigraphy , as well as magnetostratigraphic and preliminary strontium isotopic data , considered it lower middle campanian (~ 80 ma ) .
the paleolatitude at which the nanaimo group was deposited is contentious , with advocates of the baja - - british columbia hypothesis suggesting a paleolatitude of approximately 30degrees north ( i.e. , equivalent to baja california today [ 44 , 46 , 47 ]) .
this hypothesis implies over 3000 km of northerly displacement between the site of original deposition and the present position of sucia island strata .
alternatively , the rocks of the nanaimo group have been interpreted as having been deposited much closer to their current location , or at a latitude corresponding to that of present day northern california [ 48 , 49 ] .

diagnosis uwbm 95770 can be identified as a theropod dinosaur based on its possession of a hollow medullary cavity and the relatively proximal position of the fourth trochanter ( figs 2 and 3 ) .

description and comparisons we interpret uwbm 95770 as the proximal portion of a left femur .
as preserved , the element measures 42.5 cm in length and 22.4 cm in maximum width , across what remains of the femoral head .
at its preserved midlength , the element has a circumference of 40.6 cm and is notably wider medio - laterally ( 14.6 cm ) than cranio - caudally ( 11.9 cm ) , although the latter measurement must be considered a minimum due to weathering .
in posterior view ( figs 2a and 3b ) , the specimen is roughly triangular in shape , with a broad proximal region tapering towards the remnants of the high and elongate fourth trochanter .
as a result of being exposed in an intertidal region , the anterior face of uwbm 95770 is deeply weathered to display the inner spongiosa ( fig 2b ) .
in distal view , the cross - section of the in - filled medullary cavity measures ( minimally ) 6 cm wide and 3.5 cm anteroposteriorly .
only the base of the femoral neck is preserved ( fig 3 ) .
erosion appears to have particularly affected the dorsal and articular surfaces of the femur , possibly because these areas lacked a finished periosteal surface .
in fact , fossil invertebrates , including the common bivalve crassatellites conradiana , were found scattered inside the body of the proximal femur , suggesting that biological activity was at least partially responsible for this taphonomic loss .
in proximal view ( fig 2c ) , the specimen has a relatively straight posterior margin and a broadly arched anterior outline .
the proximal shape differs substantially from the proximal view of complete theropod femora ( e.g. , [ 52 ]) , but the absence of the large lesser trochanter in uwbm 95770 must be kept in mind .
in anterior view , the periosteal surface is generally complete and well preserved , except for the middle one - third , which is deeply eroded such that trabecular bone of the interior is visible .
erosion becomes more prominent distally , with the hollow interior of the bone represented by a dark gray siltstone matrix infilling .
the area of the greater trochanter preserves compact bone of the periosteum , but it is difficult to determine if it represents the original external surface or a slightly deeper level .
the apices of the complete periosteal surfaces of the base of the femoral neck and the greater trochanter are in - line with one another across the long axis of the preserved cross - section .
this morphology suggests that the missing femoral head would have been oriented directly medially , and not anteromedially as in non - tetanuran theropods [ 53 , 54 ] .
the posterior aspect of the femur is generally well preserved and features the most diagnostic aspect of its anatomy , a distinct fourth trochanter ( figs 2a and 3b ) .
proximally , the fourth trochanter is somewhat inset from the medial surface of the femoral shaft and runs slightly laterally across the shaft towards its distal termination .
in cross - section , the proximal portion of the trochanter has a steep - sided medial surface and a relatively broad lateral surface that blends into the posterior face of the femoral shaft .
although the surrounding femoral shaft is incomplete , the distal portion of the fourth trochanter appears much more prominent and ridge - like .
in addition , the proximal half of the trochanter has a smooth surface whereas the distal half is rugose , which suggests that this muscle attachment continued in cartilage in life .
a similar condition is seen in daspletosaurus torosus ( tmp 2001.36.01 ) , where the middle portion of the fourth trochanter is rugose and unfinished ( fig 3a ) .
when taken in combination with the presence of hollow bone , the anatomy of the fourth trochanter supports the identification of uwbm 95770 as a non - paravian ( non - eumaniraptoran sensu [ 55 ]) theropod dinosaur ( e.g. , a ceratosaur , megalosauroid , allosauroid , or tyrannosauroid ) .
a relatively proximal location of the fourth trochanter , typically within the proximal one - third of the femur , is diagnostic of theropods among cretaceous dinosaurs [ 56 ] , although this placement likely first evolved among triassic dinosauriforms [ 57 , 58 ] .
in other large - bodied cretaceous dinosaurs , such as hadrosaurids or ceratopsians , the fourth trochanter is placed near the femoral mid - shaft and takes the form of a triangular prominence or long low ridge , respectively [ 59 - 61 ] .
although the specimen is incomplete , measurement data demonstrate that uwbm 95770 preserves enough anatomy to indicate a theropod - like position of the fourth trochanter .
it should be noted , however , that derived paravian theropods are characterized by a reduced fourth trochanter that can be nearly indistinguishable from the femoral shaft [ 55 ] .
predicted total length of uwbm 95770 in order to compare uwbm 95770 more broadly with other large theropods , we used measurement data to estimate its total length when complete .
linear measurements were taken from theropod femora housed in the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology ( table 1 ) .
proximal width was measured from the junction between the neck and head of the femur transversely to the lateral surface of the element .
length was measured from the dorsal - most point of the proximal surface , usually above the point where the femoral neck and head meet , parallel to the femoral shaft to the distal - most prominence of the condyles .
we used r [ 62 ] to compute a logarithmic line of best fit between femur proximal transverse width and total length ( r2 = 0.9483 ) , and then used this relationship to predict the total length of uwbm 95770 ( with 95 % confidence intervals ) based on its proximal width alone .
this method predicts uwbm 95770 to be 1167 +/ - 63 mm in total length , which suggests that uwbm 95770 represents a theropod similar in size to albertosaurus , daspletosaurus , or acrocanthosaurus [ 63 ] and somewhat smaller than tyrannosaurus .
discussion large theropods of the late cretaceous given what is preserved in uwbm 95770 , a more specific taxonomic identification ( i.e. , beyond non - paravian theropod ) is not possible on anatomical grounds .
however , several candidate theropod subclades are plausible .
for example , carcharodontosaurian allosauroids are known from the cretaceous of north america , including the carcharodontosaurid acrocanthosaurus atokensis from the aptian - albian [ 63 , 64 ] .
other carcharodontosaurids are known from the cenomanian of south america [ 65 , 66 ] and turonian of asia [ 67 ] and both continents experienced faunal exchange with laramidia throughout the cretaceous [ 68 ] , including hadrosaurid sister taxa spread between laramidia and south america in the campanian [ 69 - 71 ] .
neovenatorid carcharodontosaurians are also known from the cenomanian through santonian of south america [ 72 - 75 ] , and importantly a new neovenatorid was recently described from the cenomanian of laramidia [ 76 ] , but in rocks approximately 18 my older than those of the cedar district formation .
if uwbm 95770 pertains to either a carcharodontosaurid or neovenatorid carcharodontosaurian , it would represent the youngest known material belonging to that clade from north america .
spinosaurid megalosauroids are known mostly from the early cretaceous and have not been found in north america [ 77 , 78 ] .
megalosaurid megalosauroids are well known from the late jurassic of north america , but absent from the cretaceous worldwide , with the tantalizing possible exception of a distal tibia from the coniacian - santonian hidden lake formation of ross island , antarctica [ 53 ] .
late cretaceous abelisauroid ceratosaurians were very diverse and known mostly from the continents of gondwana , although more recent finds have been made in europe [ 73 , 79 , 80 ] .
both large and small - bodied abelisauroids share low , subtle fourth trochanters , which are distinct from the prominent ridge - like morphology seen in uwbm 95770 [ 53 , 54 ] .
ceratosaurians and megalosauroids both retain a degree of anteromedial angling of the femoral head relative to the medio - lateral axis of the diaphysis not evidenced in uwbm 95570 [ 53 ] , and although circumstantial , provenance also suggests that uwbm 95770 belongs to neither a megalosauroid nor a ceratosaurian .
three subclades of maniraptoriformes contain lineages known to have been capable of producing a femur the size of uwbm 95770 , though two can be reasonably discounted .
ornithomimosaurs are known predominantly from the cretaceous of asia , although taxa have been discovered in europe and africa as well [ 81 , 82 ] .
in north america isolated ornithomimosaur material has been found in the aptian / albian of both laramidia ( cloverly formation ; [ 83 ]) and the eastern subcontinent appalachia ( arundel formation ; [ 84 ]) .
two genera of ornithomimid ornithomimosaurs are known from the campanian and maastrichtian of laramidia , struthiomimus and ornithomimus , but are too small to have produced uwbm 95770 [ 85 , 86 ] .
recently the first nearly complete skeletons of the gigantic ornithomimosaur , deinocheirus mirificus , were discovered in the upper campanian or lower maastrichtian nemegt formation of mongolia [ 87 ] .
at this point , there is not enough evidence to rule out a large deinocheirid ornithomimosaur as a source for uwbm 95770 .
however , if uwbm 95770 represented a deinocheirid , it would be the first record of the clade in north america .
therizinosaurs are known from the barremian through maastrichtian of laramidia , but higher diversity within the group is known from the early cretaceous through maastrichtian of asia [ 88 - 91 ] .
the femora of therizinosaurs , especially the large - bodied therizinosaurids , were oval in cross - section , relatively wider mediolaterally than anteroposteriorly , which is a well - known phenomenon associated with the biomechanics of large body size [ 56 , 92 ] .
the known fourth trochanters of large therizinosaurids , like erliansaurus and neimongosaurus , are low and poorly developed [ 93 , 94 ] , suggesting that uwbm 95770 does not pertain to a large therizinosaurid .
several taxa of caenagnathid oviraptorosaurs are known from the campanian and maastrichtian of laramidia along the western interior seaway [ 95 ] .
however , these taxa and their asian relatives , including the enormous gigantoraptor erlianensis , lack a raised fourth trochanter and therefore could not have produced uwbm 95770 [ 96 , 97 ] .
the late cretaceous of north america hosted the height of tyrannosauroid diversity , with potentially up to nine genera known from the campanian and maastrichtian of laramidia alone [ 4 , 98 ] .
lythronax argestes was recently described from the middle campanian ( between 80.6 +/ - 0.15 ma and 79.9 +/ - 0.3 ma ) of utah as the earliest occurring member of tyrannosauridae , overlapping the time of cedar district formation deposition [ 4 , 41 ] .
other campanian tyrannosauroids from laramidia include daspletosaurus torosus , gorgosaurus libratus , teratophoneus curriei , and bistahieversor sealeyi [ 99 - 102 ] .
the diversity of tyrannosauroids and their widespread occurrence on laramidia suggest that it would not be surprising if uwbm 95770 belonged to this clade .
an earliest campanian origin of tyrannosaurids on laramidia was proposed by loewen et al .
[ 4 ] .
if the baja - british columbia ( bbc ) hypothesis is correct and uwbm 95770 represents a tyrannosauroid , then it would represent a larger individual than previously known from the mid - campanian of southern laramidia ( see size estimation , above ) .
on the other hand , if bbc is incorrect , then uwbm 95770 would be about 2 my older than the oldest tyrannosauroid from northern laramidia .
dinosaur assemblages from the west coast of laramidia in contrast to the rich fossil record of the eastern flank of laramidia , the west coast of the subcontinent has yielded comparatively fragmentary material , with most occurrences based on specimens preserved in marine or near - marine environments [ 36 ] .
baja california , mexico has produced the largest diversity of dinosaurs from this region , but most of the taxa are based on isolated elements recovered from beach or nearshore lagoon and playa deposits [ 22 , 27 , 28 , 103 ] .
isolated hadrosaurid bones ( hadrosauridae indet. ) have been found in three successive formations in the area around el rosario , with the majority coming from the middle ' el gallo ' formation .
on the basis of tall neural spines on the caudal vertebrae and a boot on the distal ischium , morris [ 27 ] referred hadrosaur material from baja california to hypacrosaurus altispinus .
morris eventually revised the taxonomy of the baja material to cf. lambeosaurus before erecting a new species , lambeosaurus laticaudus in 1981 [ 29 , 35 ] .
recently , prieto - marquez et al .
[ 31 ] conducted an in - depth analysis , including a critical evaluation of the postcrania , and assigned the baja hadrosaurid bones to a new genus , magnapaulia .
magnapaulia laticaudus was an enormous hadrosaurid , with an estimated body length in the realm of 12 - 15 meters [ 29 , 31 ] .
other ornithischian remains from the ' el gallo ' include an isolated tooth referable to an indeterminate nodosaurid ankylosaurian [ 104 ] , and indeterminate ceratopsian teeth [ 6 , 27 ] that warrant full description .
the saurischian record of the ' el gallo ' consists almost completely of isolated teeth , belonging to putative tyrannosaurids , the dromaeosaurid saurornitholestes sp. , and the troodontid troodon formosus [ 32 , 105 ] .
postcranial remains attributable to tyrannosauridae [ 30 ] and a possible ornithomimid [ 105 ] are also known , although the ornithomimid material has not been figured or formally described , as far as we are aware .
two theropod genera have been named from the underlying lower - middle campanian la bocana roja formation of baja california , the enantiornthine bird alexornis antecedens [ 33 ] and the enigmatic , large - bodied labocania anomala [ 34 ] .
labocania is known exclusively from fragmentary cranial remains , parts of an ischium and pubis , a metatarsal ii , and a chevron belonging to a single individual .
it shares traits with tyrannosaurids , as well as with other large theropods [ 30 , 106 , 107 ] .
molnar [ 34 ] compared the cranial material of labocania favorably with taxa now considered to be abelisaurid and neovenatorid theropods .
labocania warrants further study , especially with uwbm 95770 representing another large theropod from roughly coeval rocks .
fossils from california ( i.e. , the point loma , ladd / williams , moreno , chico , and budden canyon formations ) come from both fluvial and marine rocks , with the ankylosaur aletopelta coombsi of the point loma formation representing the rare instance of a near - complete unit of dermal ossifications , held together by skin [ 25 ] .
fragmentary hadrosaurid bones ( hadrosauridae indet. ) are the most common dinosaur fossils throughout california .
two partial skeletons from the moreno formation were ascribed to the hadrosaur saurolophus by morris [ 22 ] , but prieto - marquez et al .
[ 23 ] later referred the skeletons and additional cranial material to the novel genus and species augustynolophus morrisi ( see also [ 108 ]) .
turbidite facies within the marine chico formation have yielded isolated bones of three avian dinosaurs along with mollusk shells and teeth belonging to actinopterygians and sharks .
two of the avian bones pertain to toothed ornithurine birds ( ichthyornis sp. and hesperornis sp. ) common on the other side of laramidia in the western interior seaway , whereas the third is the ulna of an indeterminate neognath [ 19 , 20 ] .
in northern california the lower cretaceous marine budden canyon formation has produced the stratigraphically lowest pacific coast dinosaur fossil : a ' hypsilophodontid ' hind limb ( ornithopoda indet . )
[ 21 ] .
beyond the rare occurrence of dinosaurs , the mesozoic marine rocks of california have routinely produced fossils of marine reptiles like thalattosaurs , ichthyosaurs , plesiosaurs , mosasaurs , and sea turtles as well as occasional fragmentary pterosaurs [ 19 ] .
the sole mesozoic dinosaur fossil known from oregon is a sacrum that probably belongs to an indeterminate hadrosaurid .
the specimen was discovered in the cape sebastian sandstone formation and , despite being mentioned in the literature [ 2 , 18 ] , it does not appear to have been accessioned at a public repository or to have been formally described .
uwbm 95770 belongs to a large theropod , likely that of a tyrannosaur , and is the sole mesozoic dinosaur fossil from washington , but not the first from the nanaimo group as both birds and a possible ornithomimid have been recovered from the gulf islands of british columbia .
upper cretaceous marine rocks of the northumberland formation on hornsby island , british columbia have produced several limb elements of ornithurine and enantiornithine birds [ 16 , 17 ] .
there is evidence for at least two taxa of each clade , including species of relatively large body size for mesozoic birds , which indicate a previously unknown diversity of birds in pacific marine ecosystems .
bullard [ 109 ] described a weathered mid - caudal vertebra from the cedar district formation of denman island and referred it to ?
ornithomimidae on the basis of a ventral keel on the centrum , amphiplatan articular faces , and comparisons with ornithomimid vertebrae at the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology .
the specimen is housed in the royal british columbia museum ( rbcm.eh2010.001.0001.01 ) and warrants restudy .
santonian - aged rocks from british columbia have produced marine - adapted species including mosasaurs , an elasmosaurid , and desmatochelyid turtles [ 110 ] .
a previously reported theropod tooth from vancouver island is now considered to be that of a mosasaur , kourisodon puntledgensis [ 16 , 110 - 112 ] .
two ornithischians have been found in marine strata of the matanuska formation of south - central alaska .
gangloff [ 13 ] first reported a partial skull of the nodosaurid edmontonia sp. from the campanian - maastrichtian member 3 of the matanuska formation as the first alaskan dinosaur outside of the north slope .
subsequently , pasch and may [ 14 ] described a relatively early occurring indeterminate hadrosaur from member 4 , which is well dated to the turonian .
we thank jim goedert and david starr for initially discovering the specimen and alerting us to its location .
in addition , we acknowledge the members of the burke museum team for collecting the fossil ( bruce crowley , ron eng , don hopkins , adam huttenlocker ) and the administration of sucia island state park ( steve sabine , ted schlund ) for access and permissions .
we thank morgan turner for producing the excellent illustrations , leander love - anderegg for technical assistance , and peter ward for discussions concerning sucia island geology .
edie adams provided critical support for this project .
we recognize don brinkman , brandon strilisky , and darren tanke for access to comparative material at the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology .
finally , we thank phil currie and andrea cau for their timely and useful reviews .

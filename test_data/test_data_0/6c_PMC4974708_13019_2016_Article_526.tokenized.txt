background the development of a video assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy ( vats - l ) program provides a dedicated surgical team with a recognized learning curve ( lc ) of 50 procedures .
we analyse the results of our program , comparing the lc with subsequent cases .
methods from june 2012 to march 2015 , we performed n = 146 vats major pulmonary resections : n = 50 ( group a : lc ) ; n = 96 ( group b ) .
pre - operative mediastinal staging followed the national comprehensive cancer network guidelines .
all procedures were performed using a standard anterior approach to the hilum ; lymphadenectomy followed the nccn recommendations .
during the lc , vats - l indication was reserved to clinical stages i , therefore evaluated case by case .
results mean operative time was 191 min ( 120 - 290 ) in group a and 162 min ( 85 - 360 ) in group b ( p < 0,01 ) .
pathological t status was similar between two groups .
lymphadenectomy included a mean of 5.8 stations in group a and 6.6 in group b resulting in : pn0 disease : group a n = 44 ( 88 %) , group b n = 80 ( 83.4 %) ; pn1 : group a n = 3 ( 6 %) , group b n = 8 ( 8.3 %) ; pn2 : group a n = 3 ( 6 %) , group b n = 8 ( 8.3 %) .
conversion rate was : 8 % in group a ( n = 4 vascular injuries ) ; 1.1 % in group b ( n = 1 hilar lymph node disease ) .
we registered n = 6 ( 12 %) complications in group a , n = 10 ( 10.6 %) in group b. one case ( 1.1 %) of late post - operative mortality ( 90 days ) was registered in group b for liver failure .
mean hospital stay was 6.5 days in group a and 5.9 days in group b. conclusions we confirm the effectiveness of a vats - l program with a learning curve of 50 cases performed by a dedicated surgical team .
besides the lc , conversion rate falls down , lymphadenectomy become more efficient , indications can be extended to upper stages .
keywords vats lobectomy learning curve education minimal invasive surgery thoracic surgery issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background since its introduction in 1991 [ 1 ] , video assisted thoracic surgery lobectomy ( vats - l ) for non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) has evolved to become a safe and effective alternative to the conventional thoracotomy approach [ 2 , 3 ] .
vats - l , compared with lobectomy by thoracotomy , is associated with a shorter length of stay , less postoperative pain , preserved pulmonary function , fewer postoperative complications and better compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy [ 4 - 6 ] .
despite these advantages , recent data from european society of thoracic surgeon database demonstrated that thoracotomic lobectomy is still the procedure of choice for surgical treatment of nsclc and only 10 % ( 2721 vs 26051 ) of all procedures from 2007 to 2013 were performed with a minimally invasive approach [ 7 ] .
even if this circumstance may be related more to a cultural background , many authors report vats - l as a more complex and time consuming procedure , with potentially serious intra - operative complications , moreover questioning its oncologic value particularly during the learning curve ( lc ) period .
in this setting , many surgical teams could be demotivated in pursuing a vats - l program .
the length of a vats - l lc has been established in 50 procedures [ 8 ] .
however , several factors can affect duration and efficacy of the lc period : the experience in other complex vats procedures and / or in standard open major pulmonary resections ; the selection of a dedicated surgical team ; the opportunity to concentrate the lc procedures within a short period and , last but not least , the development of a proctored and stepwise program [ 9 - 11 ] .
in our series we analysed surgical and oncological outcomes ( mortality , morbidity , hospitalization , operative time , type of resections , safety and effectiveness of mediastinal lymph node dissection and intra - operative staging ) of a vats - l program comparing the first 50 patients , representing our lc , with subsequent cases .
methods our institutional review board granted approval and waived the requirement for specific informed consent for this retrospective study .
this is a retrospective study using a prospective database of consecutive patients who underwent vats major pulmonary resections ( vmpr ) for nsclc at our institution ( thoracic surgery unit , university hospital careggi , florence ) from june 2012 to march 2015 .
each patient was pre - operatively evaluated by computed tomography ( ct ) scan , positron emission tomography ( pet ) scan or pet / ct , pulmonary function test and bronchoscopy .
cervical video - mediastinoscopy ( vm ) was performed according to national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) guidelines ( v .
2.2010 ) : t > 3 cm , cn1 disease , central location [ 12 ] .
vm was planned as a same - day surgical procedure , with frozen section ( fs ) analysis of lymph node biopsies in order to decide whether to proceed to lobectomy or to abort .
a dedicated team , composed by two staff surgeons and two residents , was identified as in charge for the vats - l program ; team members were selected on the basis of a previous experience with other complex vats procedures and a previous attendance at qualified training course on vats - l. for the very first procedures ( i.e. 10 cases ) , the two staff surgeons worked together , as first surgeon and first assistant .
after this period , the team was composed by one staff surgeon and by the residents .
only in selected cases , the second staff surgeon was involved in the procedure .
after completion of the lc , other staff surgeons of the division were invited to gradually join the program .
the anaesthesiological team was composed by two staff anesthesiologists , with experience in the field of thoracoscopic procedures .
the first 50 cases of vats - l ( lc - group a ) were selected on the criterion of nsclc at clinical stage i , without endobronchial involvement at pre - operative bronchoscopy .
since the vats - l program start - up , every case with these features referred to our division , was evaluated and eventually treated by the vats - l team .
after completion of the lc , also more advanced stages , considered as potentially resectable by vats , were discussed and eventually included in the vats - l program .
centrally located tumours , with the potential need of a bronchoplasty procedure , were always excluded .
all procedures were performed by a standardized three - port anterior approach , as previously described by hansen et al [ 13 ] .
no tissue retractor or rib spreading was used ; in selected cases ( e.g. obese patients ) a wound protector ( alexis , applied medical , usa ) was applied at the site of the utility incision .
lymph node dissection followed the nccn ( version 2.2010 ) recommendations [ 12 ] : " minimum of 3 n2 stations sampled or complete lymph node dissection " .
in case of conversion , the anterior utility incision was extended to an anterolateral thoracotomy .
we used extensively paravertebral block with single injection of local anesthetics ( ropivacaine 75 - 100 mg plus lidocaine 200 mg ) in several different intercostal spaces associated with intravenous administration of paracetamol / acetaminophen or non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) in the post - operative period .
our policy for removing chest tubes is to take out them in absence of air leak and less than 200 ml of liquid output in 24 h. group a and group b were compared in terms of surgical results ( type of resection , operative time , blood loss , chest tube duration , hospital stay , intra - operative complications and conversions , postoperative morbidity and mortality ) and oncological results ( histology , ptnm , lymphadenectomy ) .
statistical analysis was performed using spss 16.0 software ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) .
continuous variables are expressed as mean values +/ - sd or median and range .
categorical variables were analysed using chi - square test .
continuous variables were compared by student 's t test .
a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results we prospectively recorded data from 146 scheduled vmprs chronologically divided into two groups : the first 50 cases , representing the lc ( group a ) , and the subsequent 96 cases , considered as a control group ( group b ) .
the whole program ( group a and group b ) was initiated and completed by the same surgical team .
demographical and pre - operative data are depicted in table 1 .
there were no differences in the demographic and clinic - pathologic factors between the two groups .
since the different inclusion criteria , induction treatments are represented only in group b. type of resections and oncological results are showed in table 2 .
according to 2.2010 nccn pre - operative mediastinal staging guidelines [ 12 ] , n = 27 / 146 ( 18.5 %) patients underwent vm with fs analysis of bioptic samples and , if negative , vmpr was planned as a same - day surgical procedure .
fs sections showed a 0 % of both , false positive and false negative results .
about type of resection , we observed a predominance of upper lobe lobectomies , equally distributed into the two groups .
in group b we performed a higher number of major lung resections different from lobectomies : 6.3 % ( n = 6 ) versus 2 % ( n = 1 ) in group a. particularly , in group b we had : n = 1 ( 1.1 %) superior bilobectomy , for a double lesion of the upper and middle lobe , clinically n0 ; n = 1 ( 1.1 %) left pneumonecotmy , again for a double lesion involving respectively the upper and lower lobe , with endobronchial lesion at the level of the interlobar carina .
both groups were balanced for nsclc histology .
about ptnm , due to a selection bias , we obviously observed a prevalence of early stages ( 78 % stage i , 13 % stage ii ) in group a , even if without statistically significance .
due to widening of surgical indications , in group b we operated more advanced stages ( t4 lesions in n = 3 patients ) .

surgical data and post - operative outcomes are showed in table 3 .
the operative time ( detailed for each patient in fig. 1 ) was statistically significantly shorter in group b. there was a not statistically significant difference between the estimated blood loss in the two groups ( fig. 2 ) .
the conversion rate was statistically significantly lower in group b than in group a ( 1 % vs 8 % respectively , p = 0,02 ) .
conversions were due to vascular injuries in all cases of group a : they were n = 3 ( 6 %) bleeding ( arterial bleeding n = 2 , 4 % ; venous bleeding n = 1 , 2 %) , of which n = 2 ( 4 %) considered as " bleeding not safely manageable by vats " and n = 1 ( 2 %) as a " life threatening bleeding " .
finally , n = 1 ( 2 %) conversion in group a was due to an incorrect transection of the main left pulmonary artery instead of the upper mediastinal branch during a left upper lobe lobectomy ; after conversion , this patient was managed by an end to end anastomosis of the vascular stumps .
in group b , n = 1 ( 1.1 %) conversion was due to an hilar lymphadenopathy .
complication rates were similar between the two groups .
we registered n = 2 major complications , both in group b : n = 1 acute lung injury ( ali ) ; n = 1 acute liver failure , evolved with a multiple organ failure ( mof ) .
this last patient represented the n = 1 case of mortality in group b. chest drain duration and hospital stay ( group a 6,5 +/ - 2,5 vs group b 5,9 +/ - 1,9 ; range 4 - 12 vs 4 - 28 ) were similar between the two groups ; n = 68 ( 46 %) patients were discharged within the fifth p.o. day .
our policy in removing chest tubes is to take out them when the drained is less of 200 ml in the last 24 h and this can affect directly the hospitalization .

recent analysis of postoperative outcomes performed on both , single institutional series and official database , proposed vats - l as to be superior in terms of length of stay , postoperative pain , preserving pulmonary function , postoperative complications and compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy when compared to open lobectomy .
despite a 20 years period of development and published reports of thousands of cases , vats - l remains a technique adopted by a minority of thoracic surgeons , at least when we look to national database ; moreover , vats - l have experienced only in the last years a significant increase of its uptake [ 7 ] .
vmprs are still considered complex and demanding procedures characterized by the need of a fine dissection of delicate and vulnerable vascular structures at risk for potential severe and life threatening bleedings .
the lc period is considered the period more at risk for these complications .
the adequacy of the oncological result is the other side of the coin .
even if several authoritative authors [ 14 , 16 , 17 ] demonstrated the efficacy of vats - l in terms of oncological results and validity of intra - operative staging , the issue is still debated .
particularly , the safety and effectiveness of vats mediastinal lymphadenectomy outside specialty centers or during the lc period is considered a critical point ; in these settings , some technical difficulties , such as lymph node exposure and en bloc dissection , could be time consuming or considered as risky , thus leading to an oncologically inadequate result .
actually , an incomplete mediastinal lymph node dissection / sampling in nsclc , may result in an incorrect staging and patients would be denied significant chances of cure ( i.e. adjuvant chemotherapy in stage iia and higher ) .
for these reasons vmprs are not evenly spread among thoracic surgeons , despite obvious advantages .
we planned our vats - l program in 2011 , based on our previous experience with minimally invasive technique .
we decided to select two staff surgeons and two residents , on the basis of their skills in complex vats procedures different from vmprs .
this was done not only to take advantage from the previously acquired skills , but mainly to avoid cultural prejudices against vats - l , potentially present in a heterogeneous ( with regard to age and cultural background ) surgical division .
therefore , they were involved in qualified vats - l training courses .
we started our vats major pulmonary resection program in june 2012 , achieving the fifty procedures of the expected lc in about 12 months , with a number of at least 4 lobectomies per months ; this number allowed the attainment and maintenance of learned skills .
there are many other human factors that may influence the lc and consequently the success of a vats - l program .
first , the thoracoscopic experience of the whole surgical team , including anesthesiologists and nurses .
the surgeons should have performed a considerable number of vats procedure ( e.g. wedge resections , mediastinal procedures , debridement of pleural empyema ) but also should have a solid thoracotomic background , helpful to prevent and to solve any intra - operative complication .
another key point is the attendance of qualified courses in vats - l or in centers with a high vats - l volume .
creating a motivated and supportive team is crucial. from the technical point of view , our series differs from other authors [ 9 - 11 ] , even in the lc , for the prevalence of upper lobectomies ( 54 % : right upper lobectomy n = 48 / 32 % and left upper lobectomy n = 31 / 21 %) that are considered technically harder than lower lobectomies , thus influencing our operative time and conversion rate at least at the beginning .
during the lc we strictly adopted the inclusion criterion of clinical stage i nsclc , in order to minimize the risk of complications .
however , an incompletion fissure at pre - operative scan was not considered a controindication , as well as we did not start including only lower lobe lobectomies ; on the contrary , we experienced lower lobectomies with incomplete / absent fissure as the more complex procedures .
as it happens for all surgical procedures , their repetition and re - iterativity allows a shorter and effective lc. by shifting to our vats - l program all the suitable stage i nsclcs , we wanted to increase the frequency of vats - l during the lc period , so helping the surgical team in its growth .
clearly the surgical volume of the center , first affect the length of the lc ; our 500 ( approximately ) procedures per year ensured us a sufficient volume .
a surgical lc can be considered as completed when parameters and results are stable , reaching a steady state and becoming comparable with literature data .
operative time , conversion and complication rate , hospital stay , oncologic adequacy and number of dissected lymph node stations are considered critical data during a vats - l program .
our study showed that : 1 ) our lc results are in line with literature ; 2 ) performance indicators can improve with increasing experience , maintaining oncological adequacy while enlarging indications ( table 3 ) .
actually , operative time and conversion rate were significantly lower after the advised fifty procedures , whereas we noted a statistically significant improvement in the number of dissected lymph node stations .
about lymph node dissection , the fear of not being effective , overall during the lc period , has proved to be baseless .
even if lymphadenectomy improves after completion of the lc , as we expected , however a mean number of dissected lymph node stations > 5 demonstrates vats effectiveness also during the lc. our policy for chest tube removal ( no air leak ; < 200 ml / 24 h ) is quite common .
the incidence of prolonged air leak is low , about 3 % , and so does not influence the mean hospital stay .
however our chest drain duration and hospitalization is longer than another vats - l series both , during learning curve and after its completion [ 16 ] .
these data reflect more the presence of different cultural backgrounds in our surgical team than a careful chest tube management policy .
our team is heterogeneous and consists of surgeons who have embraced the " minimally invasive philosophy " and other " traditional " surgeons for which is not possible and unthinkable an early chest tube removal and patients discharge before the fourth post - operative day .
data from literature showed conversion rates to thoracotomic lobectomy in a range between 2 and 10 - 12 % [ 2 , 14 , 17 ] .
causes of conversion are various and reported as technical problems ( e.g. poor visualization , instrumentation malfunction ) , anatomical problems ( calcified peri - arterial lymph nodes , absent fissure , adhesions ) , intra - operative complications ( massive bleeding from vascular injury ) and oncological situation ( invasion of chest wall , invasion of vascular structures , intra - operative unexpected n2 status , centrally located tumor , sleeve resection ) .
some of these factors are absolutely random and stochastic and surgeon can only prevent these problems with an accurate pre - operative study including patients' characteristics , radiological and endoscopic findings that could anticipate intra - operative critical technical aspects .
a relative contraindication to vmprs is considered the presence of hilar and perivascular calcification , since it may lead to a technical demanding vascular dissection with an increased risk of major bleedings ; we faced this condition in 1.1 % of cases in group b. in a large recent series villamizar et al .
[ 18 ] , reported an overall conversion rate of 4 % ( 36 / 916 ) , caused in 21 patients ( 2 %) by an intra - operative bleeding ; they also found a significant relation with the presence of positive lymph node stations ( n = 11 conversions in 153 clinical n + patients / 7.2 % vs n = 25 in 763 clinical n0 patients / 3.3 %) .
in our series , in group a we observed three conversions ( 6 %) due to " bleeding not safely manageable by vats " ; in our opinion this datum reflects a low experience in bleeding management by vats and is influenced also by an attitude to an immediate conversion rather than an attempt of repair ( quite normal during the lc period ) .
however , our series demonstrated that an emergency conversion is not a frequent event ( 1 / 146 , 0.7 %) , even in the early lc ( 1 / 50 , 2 %) .
actually , we consider the wrong transection of the main pulmonary artery , performed during a left upper lobe lobectomy , as the worst complication of the whole series .
obviously , with the increased proficiency , we believe it is ethically correct to propose vmprs even in patients with co - morbid disease ( e.g. low pulmonary reserve ) , previously treated with neo - adjuvant chemotherapy or with surgically treatable advanced disease ( t3 or t4 ) .
in our experience we started to " extend " indications after the conclusion of the lc , when the acquired skills and results made us more confident in our technical skills : in group b we performed 6.3 % of vmprs after induction chemotherapy and we pushed the indications beyond the limit of a standard lobectomy ( pneumonectomy 1.1 % , bilobectomy 1.1 % , chest wall resection 1.1 %) , without increasing procedure - related complications or decreasing oncological adequacy .
the critical point , widely debated in literature , is the oncologic adequacy of vmprs .
watanabe et al. in 2005 [ 19 ] and more recently stephens et al .
[ 20 ] compared lymph nodes number and upstaging between vats and open lobectomy for nsclc and they found no significant differences [ 9 , 16 , 19 - 21 ] .
other studies demonstrated that the lc had no negative impact on lymph node number or dissected nodal stations , remaining always oncologically effective [ 9 ] ; our results are in line with this literature with no differences before and after accomplishment of the lc ( table 2 ) .
to better understand results , we believe that collect , analyze and compare data is basic ; moreover , the opportunity to compare your results with other reliable data from official database has an added value .
in january 2014 , crisci r .
( university of l'aquila , italy ) , bringing together the italian centers performing vmprs , created a vats - l italian community ( www.vatsgroup.org ) , in order to promote the diffusion of vats - l , collect and analyze surgical and oncological data coming from the participating centers .
we think that this step will lead to a professional growth and expansion of the italian vats - l community .
our study had some limitations : 1 ) is a single institution series , retrospectively analyzed in a short period and with limited oncological follow - up ; 2 ) obviously , during the lc we selected patients with early stage lung cancer and this issue can be interpreted as methodological bias ; 3 ) furthermore there are not standardized parameters to evaluate and quantify the surgeons' performance , proficiency and efficiency .
conclusions we conclude that the safety and effectiveness of a vats - l program with a learning curve of 50 cases performed by a dedicated surgical team has been confirmed by our study .
besides the lc , conversion rate falls down , lymphadenectomy become more efficient , indications can be extended to upper stages .

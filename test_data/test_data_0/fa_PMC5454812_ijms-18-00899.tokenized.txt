this study was conducted to compare 3d - printed polycaprolactone ( pcl ) and polycaprolactone / beta - tricalcium phosphate ( pcl / beta - tcp ) membranes with a conventional commercial collagen membrane in terms of their abilities to facilitate guided bone regeneration ( gbr ) .
fabricated membranes were tested for dry and wet mechanical properties .
fibroblasts and preosteoblasts were seeded into the membranes and rates and patterns of proliferation were analyzed using a kit - 8 assay and by scanning electron microscopy .
osteogenic differentiation was verified by alizarin red s and alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) staining .
an in vivo experiment was performed using an alveolar bone defect beagle model , in which defects in three dogs were covered with different membranes .
ct and histological analyses at eight weeks after surgery revealed that 3d - printed pcl / beta - tcp membranes were more effective than 3d - printed pcl , and substantially better than conventional collagen membranes in terms of biocompatibility and bone regeneration and , thus , at facilitating gbr .
3d printing animal study collagen membrane guided bone regeneration ( gbr ) membrane polycaprolactone ( pcl ) beta - tricalcium phosphate ( beta - tcp ) 1 .
introduction guided bone regeneration ( gbr ) is the most common method used for treating bone defects in implant dentistry , and many studies have reported it produces satisfactory results [ 1,2,3,4 ] .
gbr provides a means of inducing new bone formation without perturbing soft tissues .
this technique requires that a membrane be placed above a bone defect site to inhibit fibroblast influx from adjacent epithelium and connective tissue , and to maintain a space for bone regeneration , which involves the infiltration of blood vessels from adjacent old bone and the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts [ 5,6,7 ] .
membranes play an important role in gbr and , for this reason , much effort has been spent on developing better gbr membranes .
the requirements of an ideal gbr membrane include biocompatibility , cell occlusion , tissue integration , space - maintaining ability , and clinical manageability [ 8 ] .
various materials have been used to fabricate gbr membranes [ 9 ] , which are generally classified as non - resorbable or resorbable .
non - resorbable membranes have the advantage of excellent space - maintaining ability , but are used only for specific indications due to the need for a second surgery to remove them and a risk of infection caused by a high rate of membrane exposure [ 9,10 ] .
resorbable membranes are being increasingly used in clinical practice as their limitations have been largely addressed .
these include low space - maintaining ability due to weak mechanical properties , and rapid degradation and absorption [ 11,12 ] .
recent , studies have focused on improving the space - maintaining abilities and mechanical properties of resorbable membranes using different fabrication methods and synthetic biodegradable materials [ 13,14,15 ]. of the various fabrication methods used , in combination with synthetic biodegradable materials , three - dimensional ( 3d ) printing enables resorbable membranes to be made without toxic solvents and allows membrane thicknesses , pore sizes , and shapes to be easily adjusted to create favorable environments for cells .
in a previous study , a pcl / plga / beta - tcp membrane was fabricated from an intimate mix of polycaprolactone ( pcl ) , poly lactic - co - glycolic acid ( plga ) , and beta - tricalcium phosphate ( beta - tcp ) using a multi - head deposition system ( an extrusion - based 3d - printing technology ) [ 16,17,18 ] .
an evaluation of the membranes produced in a rabbit calvarial defect model confirmed their superior abilities to promote bone regeneration [ 16 ] .
furthermore , when pcl / plga / beta - tcp and titanium mesh membranes ( a typical non - resorbable membrane ) were applied to peri - implant defects in a beagle mandible , the pcl / plga / beta - tcp membrane was found to be non - inferior in terms of new bone formation and osteointegration [ 17 ] , and the same was found when pcl / plga / beta - tcp and collagen membranes ( a typical resorbable membrane ) were compared [ 18 ] .
these results confirmed the potential of pcl / plga / beta - tcp membranes for gbr , but plga has also been reported to induce an inflammatory response because of the acidic byproduct and toxins produced during its degradation process [ 19,20,21 ] .
plga is a copolymer of polylactic acid ( pla ) and polyglycolic acid ( pga ) and has been approved by the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) .
plga is a widely - used biomaterial and is used to produce biodegradable implants and drug carriers due to its excellent biocompatibility , biodegradability , and process ability [ 22,23 ] .
in previous studies , plga , which has a high elastic modulus , was mixed with pcl and beta - tcp to enhance membrane strength [ 19,20,21 ] .
therefore , this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of pcl / beta - tcp ( 4:1 ratio by weight ) membranes fabricated by 3d printing and to compare them with pcl and commercially - available collagen membranes .
2. results 2.1 .
mechanical properties of pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes membrane tensile testing was performed under dry and wet conditions .
the results of the stress - strain curves obtained are shown in figure 1a,b. the tensile stress of dry collagen membranes was significantly higher than that of pcl or pcl / beta - tcp membranes .
however , when wet , the tensile stresses of all membranes were similar .
membrane elastic moduli were calculated from stress - strain curves ( figure 1c ) .
when dry , the elastic modulus of collagen membranes ( 1050 mpa ) were significantly higher than those of pcl ( 175 mpa ) and pcl / beta - tcp ( 239 mpa ) membranes ( p < 0.001 ) but , when wet , the elastic moduli of pcl ( 171 mpa ) and pcl / beta - tcp ( 213 mpa ) membranes were significantly higher than that of collagen membranes ( 12 mpa ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
furthermore , pcl / beta - tcp membranes had a slightly higher elastic modulus than pcl membranes ( p < 0.05 ) .
these results show that the mechanical strength of collagen is significantly reduced under wet conditions , whereas pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes were relatively unaffected ( table 1 ) .
2.2 .
in vitro results a cck - 8 assay and sem imaging were used to investigate the proliferations and morphologies of nih3t3 ( a mouse fibroblast cell line ) and mc3t3 - e1 ( a mouse pre - osteoblast cell line ) cells on collagen , pcl , and pcl / beta - tcp membranes ( figure 2 ) .
cck - 8 assay results showed that initial adhesion was approximately twice as high on collagen as on pcl or pcl / beta - tcp , though the optical density of cells on pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes was increased with time .
however , the optical density of nih3t3 cells on pcl and pcl / beta - tcp decreased after day 7 , whereas mc3t3 - e1 cells continued to grow on the three different membranes up to day 14 .
sem imaging showed this reduction in nih3t3 cells was due to cell aggregation on the membranes and detachment on day 14 .
this detachment of nih3t3 cells was also partially observed on collagen , though much less so than that observed on pcl or pcl / beta - tcp .
these results suggest that the pcl / beta - tcp membrane might be useful for gbr , as it promoted the proliferation of pre - osteoblasts and inhibited fibroblast ingrowth .
osteogenic differentiation was examined using mc3t3 - e1cells , to check the extent of osteogenesis on the three membrane types ( figure 3 ) .
extents of differentiation were analyzed by alizarin red s staining and quantitated using 10 % cetylpyridinium chloride on days 7 and 14 .
on day 7 , the extent of osteogenic differentiation on pcl / beta - tcp was 1.5 times higher than that observed on collagen and this difference was maintained until day 14 .
regarding early markers of osteogenesis , on day 7 , the expression of alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) on pcl / beta - tcp was higher than on collagen or pcl .
quantitation using p - nitro phenyl phosphate ( pnpp ) confirmed the higher expression of alp on pcl / beta - tcp .
these in vitro results demonstrate the potential usefulness of the pcl / beta - tcp membrane as a gbr membrane , which exhibited cell compatibility , inhibition of external tissue ingrowth , and the promotion of osteogenic differentiation .
2.3 .
in vivo results 2.3.1 .
clinical findings all animals survived and the 18 defects healed without any problems .
membrane exposure and separation were not observed at the end of the study .
no complication was encountered in any of the three groups at the end of the study , and clinical difference was not observed .
2.3.2 .
volumetric analysis by micro - computed tomography 3d micro - ct images are presented in figure 4 .
in the collagen group , bone graft materials maintained the common alveolar ridge shape .
on the other hand , in the pcl and pcl / beta - tcp groups maintained an augmented alveolar ridge shape to the lateral side of the alveolar ridge shape .
space maintenance by barrier materials plays a key role in bone augmentation and , thus , these results suggest bone regeneration would be greater in the pcl and pcl / beta - tcp groups than in the collagen group .
volumetric measurements are summarized in table 2 .
the pcl / beta - tcp group showed non - significantly more new bone formation than the other two groups ( p = 0.350 ) .
all three groups had similar remaining bone substitute volumes ( mm3 , p = 0.923 ) .
in terms of non - mineralized tissue volumes ( mm3 ) the three groups were similar ( p = 0.930 ) .
2.3.3 .
histologic findings at eight weeks after implantation , no membrane exposure or loss was observed in the pcl or pcl / beta - tcp groups and , presumably due to the presence of membranes , bone graft materials were well - preserved in defects .
however , in the collagen group , the membrane was not in close contact with the lower part of the buccal bone , and floated slightly , indicating a space was present , and as might be expected , some bone graft loss was observed .
on the other hand , in the pcl and pcl / beta - tcp groups , membranes were closely attached to the buccal bone .
in most specimens , new bone was observed around bone graft materials .
in the collagen group ( figure 5a - c ) , small amounts of new bone were observed in defects .
on the other hand , in the pcl ( figure 5d - f ) and pcl / beta - tcp groups ( figure 5g - i ) , large amounts of new bone were observed .
furthermore , bone graft materials were augmented to the buccal lateral side of the alveolar ridge , that is , they retained the shape of the membranes as formed by the surgeon .
2.3.4 .
histometric analysis histometric measurements are summarized in table 3 and table 4 .
areas of tissue compartments within membrane - protected bone defects were analyzed for three membrane systems using new bone plus bone substitute percentages ( nib , %) and soft tissue plus bone substitute percentages ( sib , %) in membrane - enclosed defect areas in vertical sections .
the pcl / beta - tcp group had significantly higher nib % values than the other two groups ( p < 0.001 ) but significantly lower sib % levels ( p < 0.05 ) .
in terms of soft tissue plus bone substitute percentages ( seb , %) , the collagen group showed significantly higher levels than the other groups ( p < 0.001 ). with regard to horizontal width measurements of ridge augmentation , bone gain at the 75 % , 50 % , and 25 % defect height levels were significantly different in the three groups , and the pcl / beta - tcp group had significantly higher values than the collagen or pcl groups ( p < 0.01 ) .
3. discussion in the present study , gbr membranes were fabricated using an extrusion - based 3d printer , which has been the subject of several studies .
[ 17,18,24,25 ] a strong merit of extrusion - based 3d printing systems is that they enable composited biomaterials , such as , pcl , plga , pla , pga , and their blends to be used .
in addition , powder materials , particularly those with thermal resistance , can be mixed with these thermoplastic polymers .
indeed , blends of pcl / plga [ 24 ] , pcl / plga / powdered tcp [ 26 ] and pcl / plga / powdered antibiotics [ 18 ] have been shown to be potential candidates for engineering tissue scaffolds by 3d printing .
the membranes used for gbr can be classified as barrier or support membranes .
the barrier membranes typically used in clinical practice are collagen membranes , and the support membranes are typically made of titanium .
although titanium membranes have excellent space - maintaining abilities , they are non - absorbent and their porous structures cannot be easily controlled .
for this reason , we developed a pcl / plga / tcp membrane with the aim of replacing the titanium support membrane .
considering the strength of titanium , we used a pcl / plga / tcp blend , in which the role of the plga was to enhance membrane stiffness [ 17,18 ] .
however , the acidic products generated during the degradation of plga have been reported to cause rapid swelling and inflammatory response in vivo , and plga , including membranes , have been reported to fail structurally because of their rapid degradation rates and inflammatory response [ 27,28,29,30,31 ] .
therefore , we decided to exclude plga , and focused on pcl / beta - tcp membranes for gbr .
pcl is known as an effective biodegradable synthetic polymer in the tissue engineering field , and has sufficient elasticity to prevent early membrane fracture [ 32 ] .
however , its cell affinity is lower than those of other polymers because of its hydrophobicity [ 27,33 ] , and its degradation rate is much slower than that of bone reconstruction [ 34 ] .
the scaffold degradation rate is an important consideration , as it is closely related to cell vitality and growth [ 35 ] .
scaffolds should degrade slowly enough to maintain space during initial new bone growth , but rapidly enough to provide space for new bone formation .
accordingly , many attempts have been made to increase the degradation rate of pcl .
in the present study , beta - tcp was used to increase the degradation rate of pcl , as it has been shown beta - tcp is biodegraded in vivo in 3 - 6 months , whereas pcl biodegradation takes more than 12 months .
furthermore , the pcl / beta - tcp blend was shown to have better physical , biological , and mechanical properties than pcl alone in this study .
ceramic beta - tcp has excellent osteoconductivity and biocompatibility and , thus , is widely used in orthopedics and dentistry [ 36 ] , and the incorporation of tcp into pcl scaffolds [ 26,37 ] and membranes [ 16 ] can increase compressive strength and surface roughness and , thus , enhance cell and tissue integration .
the role of the membrane is to prevent fibroblast invasion and aid bone formation .
in this study , the pcl / beta - tcp membrane acted as a barrier and , simultaneously , beta - tcp releases ca2 + to aid bone formation .
as a role to enhance bone regeneration , preosteoblast cell adhesion and differentiation were evaluated .
if the surrounding tissues are not adhered to the membrane at the time of insertion , the body can represent a foreign body reaction .
therefore , it is important to determine the relationship with the surrounding tissue .
this in vitro testing using nih3t3 cells ( mouse fibroblasts ) and mc3t3 - e1 cells ( mouse preosteoblasts ) showed that pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes were comparable to collagen membranes in terms of cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation ( figure 2 and figure 3 ) .
pcl / beta - tcp membranes had excellent cell affinity and mechanical properties and were flexibility enough to manage irregular bone defects .
in the dental field , collagen membranes are regarded as the gold standard for gbr , due to their excellent biocompatibility , low immunogenicity , and optimal biodegradability .
in the present study , collagen membranes demonstrated excellent in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility , but they also exhibited rapid loss of space - making ability under wet conditions .
in fact , the fiber - like state of dry collagen membranes rapidly became gel - like after wetting .
the elastic modulus of dry collagen membranes ( 1050.2 +/ - 84.10 mpa ) was superior to those of pcl ( 175.5 +/ - 5.40 mpa ) and pcl / tcp ( 238.9 +/ - 15.70 mpa ) membranes ( figure 1 ) .
however , the elastic modulus of collagen membranes rapidly decreased from 1050.2 +/ - 84.10 mpa to 12.0 +/ - 3.90 mpa when dry membranes were exposed to a wet environment .
furthermore , this in vivo experiment showed that after collagen membranes had absorbed water , they were weakened to the extent that they were no longer able to maintain their space - making ability .
on the other hand , the elastic moduli of pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes were similar under dry and wet conditions .
the hydrophobic nature of pcl means that its uptake of water occurs slowly [ 38 ] and , thus , the mechanical properties of pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes do not change appreciably after several days of exposure to water , which indicates pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes are likely to retain their space - making abilities in the presence of saliva or blood .
in the clinical situation , the gbr procedure is mainly performed to augment bone growth at defect sites .
in the present study , box - type defects of 7 mm x 5 mm x 5 mm were prepared in mandibles to mimic large bone defects , and then treated by gbr [ 16 ] .
the three dogs were sacrificed at eight weeks after surgery , which was determined based on considerations of bone turnover and the bone regeneration rate , for volumetric and histomorphometric analysis .
micro - ct analysis showed volumetric parameters were not significantly better in the pcl / beta - tcp group , and that this group maintained an augmented alveolar ridge shape to the lateral side .
space maintenance by bone graft materials plays an important role in bone augmentation .
jiang et al .
[ 39 ] reported facial pressure affected new bone formation in defect areas and that space - maintaining ability was critical for new bone formation .
histologic findings showed pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes were attached to the buccal bone and that bone graft materials were augmented to the buccal lateral side in accord with the membrane shape determined by the surgeon , whereas in the collagen group , membranes floated away from the buccal bone and , thus , graft materials were scattered .
in clinical practice , gbr membranes are left in place for up to six months , which is the optimal time for bone regeneration [ 40 ] .
however , in our histologic study , substantially intact pcl and pcl / beta - tcp membranes were observed eight weeks after implantation .
accordingly , further study is required to determine the degradation rate of pcl / beta - tcp membranes .
in the histometric analysis , we analyzed areas of tissue compartments within membrane - protected bone defects and horizontal bone gains at different defect levels .
in terms of nib % and seb % values , the pcl / beta - tcp group showed significantly better results than the other two groups ( p < 0.001 ) .
furthermore , horizontal measurements of ridge augmentation showed bone gains at the 75 % , 50 % , and 25 % level results were significantly better in the pcl / beta - tcp group ( p < 0.01 ) .
these results show beta - tcp incorporation aided bone regeneration , presumably because of its osteoconductivity .
in addition , the use of a plga and beta - tcp blend was reported to promote bone regeneration to an extent like that of beta - tcp [ 41 ] .
3d printing technology enables pcl / beta - tcp membranes to be prepared quickly and economically in diverse shapes , thicknesses , pore sizes , pore geometries , and porosities .
in addition , its mechanical properties and degradation rates can be modified by changing the pcl : beta - tcp ratio [ 17,32 ] .
in addition , they can be tailor - made for patients using ct scan data , and drugs or growth factors can be incorporated [ 42,43 ] .
in this study , 3d - printed resorbable pcl / beta - tcp membranes were found to provide high - stability gbr membranes with excellent new bone formation abilities , and to offer a feasible alternative to collagen membranes .
further studies are required to investigate different uses and optimize pcl : beta - tcp ratios .
4. materials and methods 4.1 .

8.1 ( imt i - solution , inc. , coquitlam , bc , canada ) was used for the histometric analysis of the captured images .
the area of interest ( aoi ) was defined by the box defect ( height : 5 mm , depth : 5 mm ; figure 8 ) .
the following parameters were calculated within the aois [ 44 ] : new bone including bone substitute ( nib % ; figure 8a ( 1 )) : area occupied by new bone and bone substitute / aoi x 100 (%) soft tissue including bone substitute ( sib % ; figure 8a ( 2 )) : area occupied by soft tissue and bone substitute / aoi x 100 (%) soft tissue excluding bone substitute ( seb % ; figure 8a ( 3 )) : area occupied by soft tissue / aoi x 100 (%) horizontal bone gain at different defect levels ( mm ; figure 8b ) : distances were measured from the inside of the residual lingual cortex to the most buccal aspect of new bone formation at height levels of 0 % , 25 % , 50 % , 75 % , and 100 % of the former bone defect .

statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using r software ver 3.1.3 .
( lucent technologies , murray hill , ny , usa ) [ 45 ] .
the treatment group ( collagen , pcl , and pcl / beta - tcp groups ) was set as the independent factor , and the defect number as the random factor .
a non - parametric mixed model with post hoc analysis was used to compare group micro - ct findings and histometric parameters .
5. conclusions in this study , the 3d - printed pcl / beta - tcp membrane demonstrated better bone regeneration performance than the collagen membrane for a gbr procedure performed in buccal defects , which indicated the pcl / beta - tcp membrane has potential use as a resorbable gbr membrane for the treatment of alveolar bone defects .
furthermore , the observed greater structural stability of the 3d - printed pcl / beta - tcp membrane suggests it offers a feasible alternative to collagen membranes for gbr .

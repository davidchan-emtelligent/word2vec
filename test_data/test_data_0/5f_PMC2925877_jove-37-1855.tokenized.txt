the dynamic nature of cellular machineries is frequently built on transient and / or weak protein associations .
these low affinity interactions preclude stringent methods for the isolation and identification of protein networks around a protein of interest .
the use of chemical crosslinkers allows the selective stabilization of labile interactions , thus bypassing biochemical limitations for purification .
here we present a protocol amenable for cells in culture that uses a homobifunctional crosslinker with a spacer arm of 12 a , dithiobis - ( succinimidyl proprionate ) ( dsp ) .
dsp is cleaved by reduction of a disulphide bond present in the molecule .
cross - linking combined with immunoaffinity chromatography of proteins of interest with magnetic beads allows the isolation of protein complexes that otherwise would not withstand purification .
this protocol is compatible with regular western blot techniques and it can be scaled up for protein identification by mass spectrometry1 .
stephanie a. zlatic and pearl v. ryder contributed equally to this work .
protocol 1 .
preparing for crosslinking you will need to plate a sufficient number of cells to allow isolation of 500 mug of protein per standard tube reaction .
a single tube may be enough for identification of putative interactors of a protein of interest by immunoblot .
in this case bead bound material can be eluted with sds - page sample buffer ( immunoprecipitation ) .
for mass spectrometry analysis , the number of standard reactions should be increased at least ten times and protein complexes should be eluted by out - competition with a peptide antigen recognized by the antibody used ( immunoaffinity chromatography ) .
this strategy will allow the isolation of protein complexes free of immunoglobulin .
the optimal cell density for crosslinking is between 75 % and 90 % confluency .
in high confluency conditions , cells tend to pile on each other , which decreases accessibility to the cell - permeable crosslinker to all cells .
cell type and experimental condition should be labeled on the bottom of the cell plate .
we routinely include controls with vehicle alone .
prepare all solutions except the dsp solution prior to crosslinking .
prepare a stock of phosphate - buffered saline buffer with cacl2 0.1 mm and cacl2 1 mm ( pbs / ca / mg ) prior to starting the experiment .
the addition of calcium and magnesium ions is critical for adhesion of cells to the culture plate during the course of the experiment .

immuno - magnetic precipitation buffer ( ip buffer ) 1x buffer a + 0.1 % triton x - 100 .
2. preparing the crosslinking solution prepare the dsp solution immediately before applying to cells .
dsp is highly hydrophobic and should be dissolved in dmso before diluting into pbs / ca / mg buffer .
dissolve 40 mg of dsp in 1 ml of dmso .
this makes a 100 mm solution of dsp ( the molecular weight of dsp is 404.42 g / mol ) .
warm an appropriate volume of pbs / ca / mg to 37degreesc in order to facilitate dilution of dsp / dmso into pbs .
volumes needed for assorted plate sizes : 6 - well plate 2 ml per well10 cm plate 10 ml per plate15 cm plate 20 ml per plate add 10mul of dsp / dmso stock solution for every 1 ml of warm pbs / ca / mg. add dsp / dmso stock solution drop by drop with repeated mixing until all the dsp has dissolved .
make a control solution of 10 mul dmso added to every 1 ml of pbs / ca / mg. place all pbs / ca / mg solutions in an ice - water bath no longer than 10 min .
3. prepare cells for crosslinking prepare an ice - water bath that will fit all plates for crosslinking or vehicle control incubation .
take plates from the 37degreesc incubator and place them immediately into the ice - water bath .
wash cells two times with ice - cold pbs / ca / mg. use the same volume that you will use for the crosslinker incubation ( see section 2.2 ) .
remove second wash and add either vehicle control or dsp crosslinking buffer solution .
incubate on ice for two hours .
you should check the plates approximately every twenty minutes to ensure that all cells are covered by solution .
you may notice a small amount of dsp precipitate out of solution .
this is normal .
4. inactivation of dsp reaction prepare an 1x dsp quenching solution of 20 mm tris ph 7.4 in pbs / ca / mg ( 20 mul of 1 m tris ph 7.4 for every 1 ml of pbs / ca / mg ) .
remove the vehicle control and crosslinking solutions .
add ice - cold inactivation solution and incubate on ice for 15 minutes .
5. cell lysis during dsp quenching incubation , prepare the cell lysis buffer of 0.5 % triton x - 100 in buffer a with complete protease inhibitor cocktail .
add 20 mul 50x stock solution of complete for every 1 ml lysis buffer .
following the 15 minute dsp quenching incubation , wash cells two times with pbs / ca / mg. add lysis buffer + complete to cells and rock at 4degreesc for 30 minutes .
some suggested volumes of lysis buffer for assorted plate sizes : 6 - well plate 0.5 ml per well 10 cm plate 1 ml per plate 15 cm plate 1 ml per plate after lysis , use a cell scraper to collect the cells from the plate .
be sure to keep lysates on ice to minimize protease activity spin cell lysates for 15 minutes at 4degreesc in a bench - top mini - centrifuge at top speed ( 15.000 x g ) .
pipette the supernatant into a fresh tube .
discard the pellet .
analyze protein levels and proceed with immunoprecipitation .
6. preparing immuno - magnetic precipitation beads note : this step is usually started directly after beginning the 2 hour crosslinking incubation .
combine 30 mul of dynal immunomagnetic beads , 500 mul of ip buffer ( 1x buffer a + 0.1 % triton x - 100 ) and the appropriate amount of antigen - specific antibody to screwtop microcentrifuge tubes .
prepare antibody - free and non - specific antibody tubes for negative controls .
the appropriate amount of antibody should be determined based on individual antigens during separate experiments .
label all ip tubes .
allow the ip tubes to incubate in an end - over - end rocker at room temperature for two hours .
alternatively , incubate the ip tubes with antibody overnight at 4degrees the day prior to crosslinking .
after the incubation , do a quick 10 second mini - centrifugation to collect the beads at the bottom of the tube .
slide the tubes into the magnetic holder , which will pull the magnetic beads away from the bottom of the tube. with the beads safely out of the way , you can now easily wash away any unbound antibody .
use a small bore aspirator tip such as a gel loading tip , or p200 tip to remove the incubation buffer and any unbound antibody .
as soon as the incubation volume is removed add in 1 ml of ip buffer .
cap the tube , gently re - suspend the beads , and incubate all ip tubes at room temperature for 5 minutes with end - over - end rotation .
repeat the 5 minute wash step ( steps 6.3 thru 6.6 ) once more with a fresh milliliter of ip buffer .
the ip tubes can remain in the last wash incubation until the crosslinked lysate is ready to be added to the beads .
7. incubate crosslinked lysate with immuno - magnetic beads after the last wash spin immuno - magnetic beads , down in a mini - centrifuge for 10 seconds .
then proceed to slip the tubes into the magnetic holder .
again , using a small bore aspiration tip , remove the incubation volume from the tube .
immediately add 500 mul of crosslinked cell lysate ( assuming lysate at 1 mug / ml ) to the tubes containing immuno - magnetic beads .
if you will be using peptide competition as a negative control , an appropriate amount of peptide should be included at this point .
previous experiments should be performed to determine appropriate peptide competition conditions .
alternatively , you may want to have lysate free immuno - magnetic beads as a negative control .
in this case , immediately add 500 mul of lysate buffer ( 1x buffer a + 0.5 % triton x - 100 ) + complete to the immuno - magnetic beads .
gently resuspend the beads .
resuspended beads should be incubated at 4degrees in an end - over - end rotation for 2 hours .
8. wash unbound lysate from beads once lysate has had sufficient incubation time , do a quick 10 second spin in a mini - centrifuge .
then slide the tubes into the magnetic holder .
the magnetic holder should be kept in an ice bath for the remainder of the experiment .
using a small bore aspirator tip , remove all unbound lysate .
immediately after all unbound lysate is removed add 1 ml of ip buffer .
cap the tube and gently resuspend the beads .
once the beads are resuspended repeat the bead pelleting step ( 8.1 ) .
again aspirate off all of the incubation volume and immediately add 1 ml of ip buffer , then cap the tube .
gently resuspend the beads in ip buffer .
incubate resuspended beads for 5 minutes at 4degrees with end - over - end rocking .
repeat the bead washing steps ( 8.4 through 8.6 ) 4 more times .
9. denature sample and collect from beads after all of the immuno - magnetic precipitation tubes have been washed , re - sediment the beads ( 8.1 ) and slide tubes into the magnetic holder .
proteins bound to the immuno - magnetic beads are removed in denaturing conditions .
aspirate off the last ip buffer wash and remove the ip tube from the magnetic holder .
add 1x gel sample buffer to the ip tube just above the bead pellet to pool the beads at the bottom of the tube again .
the amount of sample buffer depends on the well size of the gel to be used .
you may need to gently tap the bottom of the tube to get all of the beads resuspended in the gel sample buffer .
repeat the denaturing process ( 9.2 through 9.3 ) for each ip tube .
immuno - magnetic beads resuspended in gel sample buffer are then heated at 75degreesc for 5 minutes to complete the denaturing process .
once the sample has been denatured it can be run on an sds - page gel for western blotting .
emptied immuno - magnetic beads can be re - pelleted by centrifugation and removed from the sample with the magnetic holder .
10. elution of crosslinked complexes with antigenic peptides ( immunoaffinity chromatography ) .
after all of the immuno - magnetic immunoprecipitation tubes have been washed , re - sediment the beads ( 8.1 ) and slide tubes into the magnetic holder .
aspirate supernatant and add 10 mul of buffer a supplemented with the antigenic peptide recognized by the antibody used for immunoisolation of protein complexes .
you should test concentrations ranging from 10 - 200 mum for efficient elution .
incubate the beads for 2 h at 4degreesc .
put beads in the magnetic stand and carefully recover the 10 ml of eluted material .
save this supernatant .
quickly wash the beads with buffer a and discard the wash .
save the beads .
add gel sample buffer to the saved supernatant and beads to a concentration of 1x .
incubate these tubes at 75degreesc for 5 minutes .
analyze beads and peptide eluate by sds - page .
the eluate should be free of igg both by protein stain of sds - page or by immunoblots ( figure 1b ) .
this material free of igg is suitable for mass spectrometry .
figure 1 .
isolation of ap - 3 interacting protein complexes and membrane proteins .
hek293 cells ( a ) or pc12 cells ( b ) were treated either in the presence of vehicle control ( dmso , odd lanes fig 1a ) or dsp ( even lanes fig. 1a or all lanes in fig 1b ) .
clarified extracts were incubated either with beads alone ( fig. 1a , lanes 3 - 4 ) , transferrin receptor antibodies ( fig. 1a , lanes 5 - 6 ) , or ap - 3 delta antibodies ( fig. 1a , lanes 7 - 10 ; fig. 1b , lanes 1 - 10 ) .
immune complexes were eluted with sds - page sample buffer ( fig. 1a ) , buffer a alone or ( fig. 1b , lanes 1 - 2 ) , or buffer a supplemented with increasing concentrations of the delta antigenic peptide corresponding to the amino acids 680 710 of human delta - adaptin ( ncbi : aad03777 ; gi : 1923266 )( fig. 1b , lanes 3 - 10 ) .
this peptide binds the delta antibody .
after peptide elution , supernatants ( s ) and beads ( b ) were analyzed by immunoblot ( fig. 1b ) .
ap - 3 , which is detected with antibodies against the delta , beta3 , and sigma3 subunits , coprecipitates with the following soluble factors : clathrin heavy chain ( chc ) , the bloc - 1 subunit pallidin , and the hops complex subunit vps33b ; as well as the membrane proteins phosphatidylinositol - 4 - kinase type ii alpha ( pi4kiialpha ) and the zinc transporter 3 ( znt3 ) .
note the absence of igg mouse heavy chains in the peptide eluted supernatant in fig. 1b .
discussion dsp , a membrane - permeable , chemically reducible crosslinker with a spacer arm of 12 a is used to stabilize transient protein interactions 1,2,3,4 .
here we exemplified this strategy with the adaptor complex ap - 3 a soluble protein complex that recognizes and sorts membrane proteins into vesicles from endosomes 5 .
ap - 3 selectively binds to the zinc transporter znt3 and the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol - 4 - kinase type ii alpha but not transferrin receptor 1,4,6 .
we expanded these observations to the identification of an ap - 3 protein interaction network of membrane proteins and cytosolic factors by mass spectrometry 1 .
low background immuno - magnetic precipitation follows crosslinking to identify interacting proteins .
moreover a published catalogue of proteins that bind non - selectively to magnetic beads allows for a first pass elimination of non - specific protein isolation and identification by mass spectrometry 7 .
dsp utilizes amine - reactive ester groups to link primary amines such as lysines or the amino acid terminus of proteins .
upon denaturing conditions , the dsp molecule is cleaved in half , leaving short chemical groups on the linked amino acids .
for some antigens there is a decrease in immunoreactivity signals by immunoblot when comparing equal protein loads between dmso control and dsp treated cells ( figure1a ) .
it is possible that this decrease results from decreased antibody affinity at the dsp modified lysines .
aside from these rare cases , the use of dsp chemical crosslinking enhances the ability to detect closely interacting membrane - associated proteins .
proteins or proteins complexes peripherally associated with the cytosolic leaflet of membranes , such as ap - 3 are localized to membranes at normal incubation temperatures of 37degreesc .
however , at room temperatures of 15 - 20degreesc the ap - 3 complex slowly redistributes to the cytosol .
thus , in order to capture interactions between ap - 3 and membrane - associated proteins , the internal temperature of these cells must be rapidly cooled to 4degreesc .
the best way to accomplish this is to 1 ) have all buffers incubating in an ice bath prior to removing cells from the 37degreesc incubator , 2 ) to immediately remove all warm media from the plate of cells and replace with ice cold buffer , and 3 ) to keep the cells suspended on an ice bath for the entirety of the crosslinking experiment .
dsp is not soluble in water and thus warming the pbs / ca / mg solution to 37degreesc before addition of dsp / dmso solution is advisable .
however , since the cells need to maintain a temperature of 4degreesc , the dsp crosslinking solution should be placed in an ice bath once the dsp is completely solubilized .
if the dsp is not completely solubilized large quantities of precipitate will form as the solution cools ( a small amount of precipitation is normal ) .
if a large amount of precipitation occurs , try heating the solution back to 37degreesc for complete solubilization and recool .
if the dsp repeatedly falls out of solution , you may need to prepare fresh crosslinking solution .
the rapid removal of dsp from solution due to incomplete solubilization should not be confused with the slow formation of a crystalline layer that appears in the wells of dsp treated cells .
the presence of this dsp crystalline layer does not interfere with the cross - linking reaction in cells .

stiff person syndrome ( sps ) is a rare , neurological disorder characterized by sudden cramps and spasms .
high titers of enzyme - inhibiting igg autoantibodies against the 65 kd isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase ( gad65 ) are a hallmark of sps , implicating an autoimmune component in the pathology of the syndrome .
studying the b cell compartment and the anti - gad65 b cell response in two monozygotic twins suffering from sps , who were treated with the b cell - depleting monoclonal anti - cd20 antibody rituximab , we found that the humoral autoimmune response in sps is composed of a rituximab - sensitive part that is rapidly cleared after treatment , and a rituximab - resistant component , which persists and acts as a reservoir for autoantibodies inhibiting gad65 enzyme activity .
our data show that these potentially pathogenic anti - gad65 autoantibodies are secreted by long - lived plasma cells , which may either be persistent or develop from rituximab - resistant memory b lymphocytes .
both subsets represent only a fraction of anti - gad65 autoantibody secreting cells .
therefore , the identification and targeting of this compartment is a key factor for successful treatment planning of sps and of similar autoimmune diseases .
introduction serum antibodies are secreted by plasma cells , which originate in germinal centers from activated b cells that have been selected for high - affinity binding to antigen .
a subset of the plasma cells will become long - lived [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , forming the humoral memory of the human immune system , which may persist over decades [ 4 ] .
since plasma cells do not express the b cell surface marker cd20 they are not removed by treatment with monoclonal antibodies like rituximab , which is depleting all cd20 + b cells through mechanisms including antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity , complement - dependent cytotoxicity , and apoptosis [ 5 ] .
since it has been proposed that a substantial fraction of antibodies against microbial antigens like pneumococcal polysaccharides or tetanus toxoid ( tt ) [ 6 ] is secreted by long - lived plasma cells , rituximab - mediated b cell depletion has little effects on the long - term humoral memory against these antigens [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
varying results have been reported for rituximab treatment of autoimmune diseases .
for example in pemphigus , anti - cd20 treatment strongly reduces anti - desmoglein titers and causes disease remission by preventing the development of short - lived plasma cells from b cells at the inflamed sites [ 8 ] , whereas anti - cd20 treatment of patients with graves' disease does not cause sustained reduction of anti - tsh receptor autoantibodies [ 9 ] .
stiff person syndrome ( sps ) is a rare neurologic disease with a strong autoimmune component .
it has an incidence of < 1 / 1 million and is characterized by progressive and fluctuating tonic muscle contractions , muscle stiffness , sudden spasms of the proximal musculature and continuous , because uninhibited , motor neuron activity [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
the muscle spasms result from an imbalance of the signals generated by excitatory and inhibitory neuronal circuits that regulate motor neuron activity .
in the nervous system , inhibitory signals are transmitted by gamma - amino butyric acid ( gaba ) [ 12 ] , which is synthesized by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase ( gad ) , catalyzing the decarboxylation of its substrate , glutamate , the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter .
in humans , the two gad isoforms are encoded by the gad1 ( gad67 ) and gad2 ( gad65 ) genes [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
more than 65 % of sps patients present with very high titers of autoantibodies directed against the 65 kd isoform of gad .
a pathological role of these autoantibodies has been postulated since they can inhibit the enzymatic activity of gad65 in vitro [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] .
indeed , gaba levels are diminished in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of sps patients [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
moreover , in sps patients plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulins treatments have beneficial effects , suggesting that removal or neutralization of anti - gad65 antibodies ameliorates sps [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
we investigated the contribution of memory b cells and long - lived plasma cells to sps , by analyzing changes in antibody titers and specificities , frequency and repertoire of specific memory cell before and after rituximab treatment in a pair of monozygotic twins suffering from sps [ 21 ] .
the anti - cd20 + treatment efficiently removed all circulating b cells , changed the b cell repertoire , the specificities of autoantibodies binding to linear gad65 epitopes and to inhibitory synapses in the brain , and resolved in a relative increase in gad65 specific memory cells .
however , the levels of enzyme - inhibiting anti - gad65 autoantibodies , their binding to conformational gad65 epitopes , and the clinical course in both patients remained unchanged .
therefore , autoantibodies in sps can be divided in two fractions , one sensitive and one resistant to rituximab treatment .
the latter are produced either by long - lived plasmacells or by activated memory cells resistant to rituximab treatment .
if rituximab - resistant cells contribute to the pathology of sps , targeting those cells could improve the treatment of sps .
results a portion of anti - gad65 antibodies , including gad65 inhibiting antibodies , persists after anti - cd20 treatment two monozygotic twins affected by sps were treated with 2 single 1000 mg injections of rituximab at 2 weeks of interval , however during 1 year of follow - up clinical improvements were not observed [ 21 ] .
before receiving rituximab - treatment , both patients had an elevated percentage of circulating b cells ( 22 % and 21 % cd19 + cells in twin a and b , respectively , normal range 5 - 18 %) with a normal distribution of naive and memory b cells as well as plasmablasts ( table 1 ) .
eight and 18 weeks after rituximab treatment , cd19 + b cells were undetectable in peripheral blood .
in line with previously published data [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , the b cell compartment in peripheral blood was partially regenerated 36 weeks after rituximab and returned to pre - treatment values at week 54 , however with a predominance of naive and transitional b cell subsets (> 95 % and > 8 % respectively ) .
the percentages of class switched memory and marginal zone b cells were both reduced 4 to 5 - fold compared to pre - treatment values , whereas the proportion of plasmablasts increased from 1.06 % to 1.72 % in twin a and from 0.5 % to 1 % in twin b ( table 1 ) .
during the entire monitoring period the total serum igg concentration remained constant [ 21 ] .
twin a and twin b had initially very high anti - gad65 antibody serum titers ( 1 / 256,000 ) , exceeding the titers of control sera by 10,000 - fold ( average 1 / 40 , range : not detectable to 1 / 80 ; n = 8 ) .
despite the fact that a 2 - fold decline in anti - gad65 antibody titer to 1 / 128,000 was observed in both patients 8 weeks after anti - cd20 treatment and persisted up to week 36 , the titers remained at least 2,000 - fold above the controls ( fig. 1a ) .
these data indicate that only about half of anti - gad65 antibodies are sensitive to anti - cd20 mediated b cell depletion .
similar to the anti - gad65 serum titers the igg concentrations of antibodies specific for tt , rotavirus group a antigen and s. pneumoniae cell wall ( pnps ) antigens either remained unchanged or increased upon rituximab treatment ( fig. 1 c - f ) .

rituximab treatment induces a 2 - fold decrease of gad65 specific serum antibody titer .
( a ) serum samples from twin a and twin b were collected before and 8 , 16 , 36 weeks after rituximab treatment , and gad65 specific antibody titers were measured by elisa .
the titers of 8 healthy donors ranged between undetectable and 1 / 80 .

anti - gad65 antibodies are also detected in other autoimmune diseases [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , but only those ones present in sps are known to inhibit gad65 enzyme activity in vitro .
therefore we analyzed the enzyme - inhibiting activity of igg isolated from both twins .
before rituximab therapy , half - maximal inhibition of gad65 enzyme activity ( ic50 ) was reached at 1.1 mg / ml igg for twin a , and 0.65 mg / ml igg for twin b ( fig. 1b ) .
after rituximab treatment the concentration of half maximal inhibition of gad65 enzyme activity remained almost unchanged with 1.3 mg / ml for twin a , and 0.95 mg / ml for twin b. these data indicate that anti - gad65 antibodies with enzyme inhibiting activity were not affected by rituximab treatment .
persistence of gad65 - specific memory b cells after anti - cd20 mediated b cell depletion it has been postulated that polyclonal activation of circulating , antigen specific memory b cells may account for the continuous generation of plasma cells and for the maintenance of humoral memory [ 28 ] .
we therefore analyzed if the frequency of gad65 - specific memory b cells remained constant after anti - cd20 treatment .
peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc ) from three healthy donors and twin a were stimulated polyclonally in limiting dilution assays , and igg production specific for gad65 and tt was tested by elisa .
before anti - cd20 therapy , 184 igg + gad65 - specific cells per 106 igg + memory b cells were found in twin a , a frequency that was almost identical to that in healthy controls ( 183 +/ - 42 gad65 - specific igg + per 106 igg + memory b cells ) .
this finding is not surprising as recently published data show that for certain antigens , the frequency of memory b cells does not correlate with antibody titers [ 29 ] .
a relative 4 - fold increase ( 699 / 106 ) in the frequency of gad65 specific memory b cells was detected 36 weeks after rituximab treatment ( fig. 2a ) .
a relative 4 - fold increase was also observed in memory b cells specific for tt ( 120 / 106 before and 513 / 106 after anti - cd20 , fig. 2b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0010838.g002 figure 2 relative increase in frequency of specific memory b cells after rituximab treatment .
frequency of igg + memory cells specific for gad65 ( a ) and tt ( b ) was analyzed by limiting dilution assays at week 0 and 36 for twin a , and for three healthy donors ( hd ) .
bcr repertoire analysis reveals a clonal expansion of switched memory cells after anti - cd20 mediated b cell depletion since changes in the frequency of memory b cells may reflect a change in the b cell repertoire , we analyzed the heavy chain variable regions ( vh ) of igm , igg and iga in both twins by spectratyping [ 30 ] .
the vh3a , vh3b , and vh4 families were most frequently used by all immunoglobulin isotype heavy chains before and after rituximab treatment ( fig. 3a ) .
similar vh usage was also reported previously for healthy subjects [ 30 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0010838.g003 figure 3 constant vh usage , but changes in cdr3 length distribution in sps patients after rituximab treatment .
( a ) the mean frequency of vh usage for each isotype was determined by quantitative real time pcr analysis on b cells from patients at week 0 and at week 36 .
as control vh usage by b cells from a healthy donor ( hd ) is shown .
( b ) cdr3 length distribution in igm + , igg + and iga + b cell of twin a and b before and after rituximab treatment was analyzed by spectratyping [ 30 ] .
the x axis of spectratype indicates cdr3 length , whereas the y axis represents the frequency of cdr3 regions .
the percentage of vh utilization among all three isotypes is indicated on each profile .
arrows indicate overrepresented cdr3 regions .
the diversity of the b cell repertoire is reflected by the highly variable length of the complementarity determining regions 3 ( cdr3 ) of immunoglobulin h - chains , encoded by the region spanning the vdj rearrangement .
representative examples for the cdr3 length distribution of the major vh families vh3a , vh3b and vh4 are shown by the immunoscope profiles in figure 3b .
before anti - cd20 treatment , both patients had a polyclonal igm b cell repertoire , reflected by the gaussian distribution of the cdr3 length , with an expanded cdr3 peak in vh3a in twin b. the skewed distribution of igg and iga cdr3 , which are normally observed in the healthy controls [ 31 ] , were also detected in both patients .
in addition , both twins had expanded igg + b cell clones using vh3a , vh3b and vh4 , which were represented by dominant cdr3 regions of 9 , 8 , 12 , and 14 amino acids length .
for twin a , these peaks were also detected in the corresponding iga profiles .
after rituximab treatment the polyclonal repertoire of the newly formed igm + b cells showed new expansion peaks in the vh3a , vh3b , and vh4 families ( fig. 3b ) .
the switched memory repertoire of vh3a , 3b and vh4 expressing igg + and iga + b cells was again oligoclonal and contained expanded new b cell clones with cdr3 length different from the ones present before anti - cd20 treatment .
analysis of epitope - specificity reveals different sensitivities to rituximab treatment igg autoantibodies directed against gad65 are found in 60 - 80 % of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients , in other neurological diseases [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , and also in about 1 % of the general population [ 32 ] .
remarkably , the epitope specificity of the anti - gad65 antibodies is characteristic for the different diseases [ 33 ] .
since rituximab treatment influenced the anti - gad65 antibody titer and the clonal expansion of switched memory b cells , we searched for changes in the epitope specificity of the humoral repertoire .
using recombinant fab ( rfab ) fragments derived from gad65 - specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to different conformational epitopes and parts of the protein [ 34 ] , we performed competitive gad65 binding assays .
binding of igg isolated from both patients to gad65 before therapy was strongly inhibited by rfabs b78 and b96.11 ( fig. 4 a,b ) .
gad65 specific antibodies that recognize the same epitope as b78 significantly inhibit gad65 activity in vitro and are primarily detected in sps patients [ 35 ] .
anti - cd20 treatment did neither change the binding pattern of patients igg to the gad65 epitopes recognized by b96.1 and b78 ( fig. 4a and b ) , nor its enzyme inhibiting activity ( fig. 1b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0010838.g004 figure 4 antibodies specific to gad65 conformational epitopes are resistant to rituximab treatment .
binding of igg from twin a ( a ) and twin b ( b ) isolated at t = 0 and at t = 36 weeks to radiolabeled gad65 was analyzed in the presence of recombinant fab derived from gad65 - specific monoclonal antibodies .
grey bars represent competitive binding of healthy control igg .
dpa , b96.11 , mica - 3 , dpd , n - gad65mab , and b78 are monoclonal antibodies specific for gad65 .
the control fab does not bind gad65 .
since we found that autoantibodies to conformational epitopes of gad65 were still present after rituximab treatment , we also compared the specificities against linear epitopes before and after rituximab therapy and analyzed binding of serum igg from both patients to 96 overlapping linear 15 - mer peptides spanning the entire gad65 amino acid sequence .
the peptide array analysis revealed five peptides located within the first 99 amino acid residues of gad65 , which were recognized by the igg of both patients before rituximab treatment was initiated ( fig. 5 a - c and fig. s1 ) .
in addition , a peptide spanning residues 14 - 28 was detected by igg from twin a but not from twin b ( fig. s1 ) .
anti - cd20 treatment changed the binding of igg of twin a to 5 peptides spanning residues 1 - 15 , 37 - 57 , and 79 - 99 , whereas the peptide recognition pattern of twin b remained constant ( fig. 5 a - c ) .
lower igg titers for these 5 peptides were found already 8 weeks after rituximab treatment and progressively decreased later on ( fig. 5 d - h ) .
since the half - life of igg is 3 - 5 weeks [ 36 ] , these data indicate that the b cells producing these specificities are eliminated by treatment and the antibodies are progressively diluted in the serum .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0010838.g005 figure 5 antibodies recognizing linear ga65 epitopes are sensitive to rituximab treatment .
( a - c ) sera isolated from patients before ( w0 : week 0 ) and after rituximab treatment ( w36 : week 36 ) and from 2 healthy donors ( hd1 , 2 ) were hybridized to peptide arrays covering the entire gad65 amino acid sequence .

significant differences in binding were determined by one - tailed t - test (* < 0.1 ; ** < 0.05 ) .
for all peptides with the exception of 79 - 93 ( pcscskvdnnyaflh ) , p - values for the means between twin a / b week 0 and the healthy donor sera were < 0.05 .
data are representative of triplicate wells of 3 independent experiments .
( d - h ) on the same peptide array were hybridized sera from twin a collected before and 8 , 16 , 36 weeks after rituximab treatment .
graphs represent relevant peptides .
data are representative of triplicate wells of 2 independent experiments .
since memory b cells could be precursors for plasma cells secreting igg binding to linear gad65 epitopes , we characterized the specificity of igg expressed by memory b cells for linear peptides .
comparing supernatants of gad65 specific memory b cell clones from twin a and from one healthy donor we found similar specificities in both sets of samples with the exception of a few peptides ( fig. s2 , black and blue arrows ) .
antibodies recognizing brain structures are sensitive to anti - cd20 treatment severe muscular spasms caused by dysfunction of inhibitory neurons are the cardinal symptoms of sps , therefore we analyzed whether the patients' igg would bind to gad65 containing inhibitory synapses .
cerebellar sections from mice and human control samples were stained with igg isolated from both patients , from control subjects and , as a reference , with antibodies specific for gad65 and calbindin , a protein highly enriched in cerebellar purkinje cells ( fig. 6 ) .
specific binding of patient igg to gad65 + gabaergic pre - synaptic terminals of calbindin + cells was detected in the purkinjie cell layer of both mouse and human cerebellum as shown in figure 6 for twin b. after rituximab treatment less gad65 + synapses were stained ( fig. 6a , row b and d ) .
control igg isolated from healthy donors only stained nuclei but not the synaptic structures defined by the gad65 - specific reference antibody ( fig. s3 row a and c ) .
the differences in staining patterns and intensities were quantified by 360 independent intensity measurements , corresponding to a 7.2 mm long - scan encompassing gad65 + synapses of mouse cortex , cerebellum and pons ( fig. 6b ) .
since the staining intensities only reached background levels after rituximab treatment , the experiments strongly suggest that the autoantibodies binding pre - synaptic structures were produced by plasma cells originating from rituximab sensitive precursors cells .

discussion impaired function of interneurons and high titers of anti - gad65 autoantibodies capable of inhibiting gad65 enzyme activity are characteristic hallmarks of sps .
the syndrome has been treated successfully by plasmapheresis [ 19 ] , [ 37 ] and intravenous igg [ 20 ] , [ 38 ] , which has been shown to result in a significant decline in anti - gad65 antibodies .
analyzing the anti - gad65 antibody titer and specificity in two monozygotic twins receiving rituximab treatment [ 21 ] , we found that the humoral autoantibody repertoire in sps is composed of two fractions .
the first fraction contains autoantibodies against linear gad65 epitopes and brain structures .
it is produced by plasma cells that originate from rituximab sensitive precursors .
the second fraction of anti - gad65 antibodies binds to conformational epitopes , has enzyme inhibiting activity , and is produced by plasma cells which are not targeted by rituximab treatment .
while anti - cd20 treatment eliminated all circulating b cells , it had little effect on the serum concentrations of anti - gad65 igg , the enzyme - inhibiting activity of anti - gad65 igg from both patients , or the recognition of conformational epitopes .
since anti - cd20 mediated b cell depletion did not improve the clinical manifestations of the syndrome it is conceivable that these anti - gad65 antibodies play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease .
moreover , additional autoantibodies with similar characteristics may also contribute to sps .
comparing the antibody repertoires between both twins we observed identical recognition patterns of conformational and linear epitopes before b cell depletion .
however , after rituximab treatment , binding to linear gad65 epitopes was much weaker for igg isolated from twin a that from twin b showing that the humoral autoimmune response against gad65 is not entirely dependent on genetic factors .
since the half - life of circulating igg antibodies is about 3 - 5 weeks [ 36 ] , constant igg titers are most likely maintained by the continuous secretion of antibodies by plasma cells .
studies of b cell populations and autoantibodies , such as rheumatoid factor and anti - citrunillated peptide antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis patients who had been treated with rituximab , have reported an almost complete elimination of b cells from blood and a significant drop in autoantibody titers [ 23 ] , [ 39 ] .
in contrast , the reduction of class - switched memory b cells and plasma cells in the rheumatoid synovium and in the bone marrow was observed only in some but not all rheumatoid arthritis patients [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
this implicates that not only autoantibody producing plasma cells , but also autoreactive switched memory b cells , which serve as plasma cell precursors , can survive anti - cd20 treatment at least in some tissues .
since we found a relative increase in anti - gad65 igg + memory b cells in the recovering blood b cell compartment after anti - cd20 treatment these cells could represent potential precursors for plasma cells .
in this case , the precursor frequency and the specificity of anti - gad65 memory b cells of the patients should be as different from the healthy donors as it was found for anti - gad65 serum antibodies .
however , the comparison of the frequency of circulating anti - gad65 igg + memory b cells and of the epitope specificities between patient a and two healthy donors , revealed only little if any differences .
therefore , it seems more likely that the unchanged binding characteristics and only slightly reduced serum titers of anti - gad65 igg autoantibodies were due to the sustained activity of long - lived , rituximab - resistant plasma cells .
these autoreactive plasma cells are similar to plasma cells that secrete antibodies to foreign antigens and pathogens like tt , rotavirus and pnps igg .
we cannot exclude however , that switched memory cells were preserved in bone marrow , as it has been reported by rehnberg et al .
[ 43 ] and koelsch et al .
[ 44 ] .
in contrast to the high serum anti - gad65 igg titers and despite of the unchanged inhibitory activity and conformational epitope specificity of these antibodies , the analysis of human and mouse brain sections revealed a clear reduction in the staining intensities of gad65 - positive inhibitory synapses by igg isolated after rituximab treatment from twin a and twin b. although these differences may be caused by differences in thresholds , sensitivities and displayed epitopes , a fraction of brain - specific autoreactive igg may be produced by short - lived plasma cells , which continuously develop from rituximab - sensitive b cells .
this is also supported by our observation that igg binding to linear gad65 epitopes was reduced early ( 8 weeks ) after anti - cd20 treatment .
interestingly , the bcr repertoire that was found before rituximab treatment showed a normal representation of vh families for the igm , g , and a isotypes .
therefore sps seems to be different from other autoimmune diseases , like pemphigus [ 8 ] , [ 45 ] , which is associated with skewed vh family usage .
the clear expansion of some igg + and iga + clones identified by the length of their cdr3 profiles reflects changes in the population of switched memory b cells after rituximab treatment .
the newly emerging cells may have survived the therapy if they were hidden in less accessible tissues as it has been demonstrated for igg + memory b cells in rheumatoid arthritis [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
while the total number of igg memory b cells decreased , the frequency of gad65 - specific igg memory b cells increased 4 - fold after treatment .
this relative increase in specific memory cells could be caused by the specific survival of cells activated through high affinity to gad65 antigen , or by their location in niches inaccessible to the treatment .
noteworthy , the frequency of gad65 memory cells in healthy controls was similar to that in sps patients before rituximab treatment , suggesting that b cell tolerance to gad65 seem not to be imposed during b cell development at the stage of immature or transitional b cells but during the formation of plasma cells in the germinal center reaction .
furthermore , our data support the view [ 29 ] that the antibody titer for certain antigens does not directly correlate with the memory cell frequency .
although rituximab penetrates the intact blood brain barrier , its concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) is 600 - 1000 - fold lower than in serum [ 46 ] .
therefore , the depletion of csf b cells may not be as efficient as for peripheral blood b cells [ 46 ] , [ 47 ] and as a consequence , csf may serve as reservoir for gad65 - specific igg memory b cells [ 47 ] .
gad65 antibodies were present both in serum and in csf prior to rituximab treatment , as reported previously [ 21 ] .
as we had no access to csf samples after treatment , the persistence of symptoms could also be explained with intramedullar or intrathecal plasma or memory cells , which were speared during anti - cd20 treatment and continued to produce gad65 antibodies .
our study of two monozygotic twin brothers demonstrates for the first time the repertoire and origins of autoreactive gad65 specific b cells in sps .
our data strongly argue in favor of the hypothesis that long - lived plasma cells and rituximab - resistant memory b cells are the main source of potentially pathogenic gad65 - specific autoantibodies .
therefore the treatment of autoantibody mediated autoimmune diseases with b cell depleting antibodies highly depends on the accessibility of autoreactive plasma cells in protective niches .
materials and methods patients twin a and twin b are monozygotic twins affected by sps , the diagnosis of sps was made in 2004 and 2002 respectively , following shaw 's criteria [ 48 ] .
both patients received rituximab in two single injections of 1000 mg at two weeks of interval [ 21 ] in accordance to the approval 78 / 2001 by the ethical committee of the university medical center freiburg .
written informed consent for research and genetic analysis was obtained from all participants to the study .
rituximab was well tolerated , but did not induce a clear clinical benefit .
gad65 antibody titer was determined at serial time point after b cells depletion , the titer was at lowest level for both twins at week 36 .
serum and isolated immunoglobulins of both patients from week 36 after rituximab treatment were used in all experiments , except otherwise indicated .
genotyping , hla typing and assessment of aire polymorphisms the genetic identity of the twins was verified by testing 9 microsatellite markers and hla antigens ( table s1 a , b ) .
the probability for the twins being monozygotic is exceeding 99.96 % [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
both patients also had autoimmune thyroditis suggesting a genetically based autoimmune response against endocrine glands similar to autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type i. we therefore screened for mutations in coding and non - coding regions of the autoimmune regulator ( aire ) gene but found only polymorphisms previously described in autoimmune thyroditis associated with systemic sclerosis [ 51 ] ( table s1c ) .
genomic dna was extracted from patients' whole blood ( puregene dna isolation kit ; gentra systems , usa ) .
genotyping pcr of 9 polymorphic microsatellite markers ( biomers , germany and invitrogen , germany ) was performed at the recommended conditions .
pcr results were analyzed on an abi 377 sequencer ( pe applied biosystems , foster city , usa ) with the collection and analysis software packages ( pe applied biosystems ) .
allele sizes were determined with the help of genotyper ( pe applied biosystems ) .
hla typing was carried out by pcr using standard methods .
aire gene sequencing was performed as described [ 51 ] .
gad65 specific antibody titers 96 well flat - bottomed nunc maxisorp microtiter plates ( thermo fischer scientific , denmark ) were coated with recombinant gad65 protein ( kindly provided by dr. kneusel , diarect , germany ) , tetanus toxoid ( kindly provided by dr. e. traggiai , gaslini institute , genova , italy ) , or rotavirus a antigen ( institute virion , ruschlikon , switzerland ) .
plates were blocked with pbs , 1 % bovine serum albumin .
serial dilutions of sera were added for each sps patient and healthy controls ( n = 8 ) .
as detection antibody , alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti - human igg ( jackson immuno research laboratories , uk ) was added .
the reaction was developed with sigma - aldrich 104 substrate ( p - nytriphenyl - phosphate ) ( sigma , germany ) .
flow cytometry peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were stained for 15 minutes at 4degreesc with a mixture of the following antibodies at optimal concentrations : cd27 fitc , cd24 fitc , igd pe , cd19 pe - cy7 , cd38 percp - cy5.5 ( all bd biosciences , germany ) , cy5 - affinipure f ( ab ') 2 fragment donkey anti human igm ( jackson immuno research laboratories , suffolk , uk ) .
samples were acquired with a bd facscanto ii ( bd biosciences ) and further analyzed with flowjo 7.2 software ( tree star inc. , oregon , usa ) .
limiting dilution pbmc from patients and healthy controls were seeded at 100 .
30. 10x103 per well in 96 wells and stimulated with cpg ( apara biosciences , germany ) and rhil - 2 ( sigma , germany ) .
after 10 days , supernatants were tested by elisa for anti - gad65 igg and tt igg .
the frequency of gad65 or tt specific memory cells is expressed as number of positive clones / igg + b cells at day 0 [ 28 ] .
spectratyping total rna was prepared from pbmcs using the rneasy kit ( sigma , deisenhofen , germany ) and cdna following standard protocols .
pcr reactions were carried out by combining a primer and a specific fluorophore - labeled probe for the constant region chmu with one of eight primers covering the different vh1 - 7 genes ( european and us patent : repertoire determination of a lymphocyte b population , wo 2005 / 059176 a1 ; pasteur institute , paris , france [ 30 ]) , using taqman 7300 ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) and applied biosystems reagents .
pcr products underwent run - off reactions with a nested fluorescent primer specific for the constant region gene .
the fluorescent products were analyzed on an abi - prism 3730 dna analyzer .
the size and intensity of each band were assessed with immunoscope software [ 52 ] .
amplification products corresponding to the clonal expansions observed in p20 immunoscope profiles were cloned , sequenced , and analyzed according to the procedure described previously [ 30 ] .
purification of immunoglobulins patient and healthy donor serum igg were affinity purified on protein g sepharose ( pgs ) columns using standard methods ( protein g sepharose 4 fast flow , amersham pharmacia biotech , sweden ) .
serum igg was allowed to bind to pgs and was eluted after washing with 0.1 m glycine buffer ph 3 .
eluted fractions were immediately neutralized by addition of 1 m tris - hcl ph 8.8 .
isolated igg were dialyzed against pbs overnight at 4degreesc .
gad65 enzyme activity assay gad65 enzyme activity was measured by the 14co2 - trapping method described previously [ 53 ] .
recombinant human gad65 ( donation by amgen , seattle , wa ) ( 100 ng ) was incubated with reaction buffer ( 50 mm k2hpo4 , 0.03 mm plp , 0.1 mm dtt , ph 6.8 ) for 1 hour at room temperature with or without the indicated amounts of isolated igg .
the enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.56 mm l - glutamate and 0.018 microci 14c - glutamate ( perkin elmer , boston ma , usa ) and allowed to continue for 2 hours at 37degreesc with gentle agitation .
during incubation , released 14co2 was captured on filter paper ( kontes , vineland , nj ) soaked in 50 microl 1 m naoh .
after the incubation , the absorbed radioactivity was determined in a beckman scintillation counter .
the results are presented as : % residual activity = cpm in the presence of igg / cpm in the absence of iggx100 .
rfab used in this study monoclonal antibodies b96.11 and b78 were derived from a patient with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome - type 2 [ 54 ] , and recognized conformational epitopes formed by the 3d structure of amino acid residues 308 - 365 and 451 - 585 , respectively [ 55 ] .
n - gad65mab was raised in mice and recognized linear epitopes representing amino acid residues 4 - 22 [ 56 ] .
dpa and dpd were isolated from a type 1 diabetes patient [ 57 ] and recognized epitopes that mapped between amino acid residues 483 - 585 and 96 - 173 , respectively [ 58 ] , [ 59 ] .
mica - 3 was isolated from a type 1 diabetes patient [ 60 ] and recognized epitopes of amino acid region 451 - 585 [ 59 ] , [ 61 ] .
all mabs recognized gad65 in its native conformation and do not bind gad67 .
in the competitive radioligand - binding assay , the rfab were added at the optimal concentration ( 0.7 - 1 microg / ml ) as determined in competition assays using the intact mab as a competitor .
epitope mapping by fab2 antibody competition inhibition of human igg binding to gad65 by rfab was tested in a competitive radioligand - binding assay [ 34 ] .
the cutoff for specific competition was determined as > 10 % by using as a negative control rfab d1.3 ( a kind gift from dr. j. foote , arrowsmith technologies , seattle ) specific for the irrelevant target , hen - egg lysozyme .
binding of sps igg to gad65 in the presence of rfab was expressed as follows : cpm in the presence of rfab / cpm in the absence of rfabx100 .
linear epitope mapping using peptide microarrays replitope ( tm ) high density microarrays were provided by jpt peptide technologies gmbh , ( berlin , germany ) [ 62 ] .
the peptides on the arrays represent a linear scan of 15mer peptides derived from human gad65 ( ncbi refseq protein accession np _ 000809 ) that overlap by 9 amino acids , with human igg spotted as control .
staining was carried out as described [ 62 ] .
sera from twin a and b , and 2 healthy controls were tested , as negative control we stained with secondary reagent only .
fluorescent signals were detected with agilent g250b scanner , analyzed with genepix pro ( molecular devices ; ismaning , germany ) .
the median intensity of each spot was corrected by subtraction with the median local background .
the heatmap was generated using cimminer ( http :// discover.nci.nih.gov / cimminer /) .
histology tissue processing and immunolabelling brain samples from c57 bl / 6 mice were isolated from anesthetized and perfused animals [ 63 ] .
immersion fixation was performed overnight in the same fixative .
human brain samples ( covered by the approval number 256 / 06 of the ethical committee of the university medical center freiburg ) were obtained from an 18 hours postmortem patient who did not suffer from a central nervous disease and material was immersion fixed in formalin for two weeks .
tissue samples of both origins were paraffin - embedded , cut to 3 - 5 microm sections , heated at 80degreesc for 1 hour , dewaxed with xylene , rehydrated and treated in citrate buffer , ph 6.0 , for 4 min in a pressure cooker to demask antigenic sites .
sections were rinsed in pbs , mounted in shandon coverplate trays ( thermo electron corp. , pittsburgh , pa ) , blocked with 1 % bsa in pbs / 0.1 % triton x - 100 for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1 % blocking buffer overnight at room temperature .
rinsed samples were incubated with secondary antibodies for 4 hours .
tissue and lipofuscin autofluorescence was quenched by equilibrating the specimens in a 50 % pbs / ethanol mixture for 2 min followed by sudan b ( 0.1 %) dissolved in 70 % ethanol [ 64 ] .
after rinsing in 50 % pbs / ethanol and pbs the sections were covered with anti - fading agent ( calbiochem , la jolla , ca ) and stored overnight at 4degreesc before observation .
patient and healthy donor igg were used at comparable concentration for staining , working concentrations for primary and secondary antibodies ( reference anti - gad65 monoclonal antibody : n - gad65mab [ 56 ] , anti - calbindin , swant ) were determined empirically to ensure optimal / signal background staining .
immunocytochemistry and image analysis immunofluorescences were scanned at 1024x1024 pixel resolution with a confocal microscope ( leica , germany ) .
three or two channel recordings were performed consecutively in z - series with gaps of 250 nm between the optical slices .
confocal stacks of z - planes were stored as tif - files and processed in the imaris 4.2 software ( bitplane ag , switzerland ) .
compiling was carried out by means of the adobe creative suite 2 software .
for quantitative estimation of patient - igg and anti gad - igg immunoreactivity the corresponding fluorescence signals of synapses was measured by recording the pixel intensities along a line spanning the synapse in question .
consecutive mouse brain sections of three c57 / bl6 mice were analyzed resulting in a total of 600 microm linear scans for each of 4 brain areas analyzed per mouse .

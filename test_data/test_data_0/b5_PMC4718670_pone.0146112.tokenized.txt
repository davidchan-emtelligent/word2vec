efficient and accurate quantitation of metabolites from lc - ms data has become an important topic .
here we present an automated tool , called imet - q ( intelligent metabolomic quantitation ) , for label - free metabolomics quantitation from high - throughput ms1 data. by performing peak detection and peak alignment , imet - q provides a summary of quantitation results and reports ion abundance at both replicate level and sample level .
furthermore , it gives the charge states and isotope ratios of detected metabolite peaks to facilitate metabolite identification .
an in - house standard mixture and a public arabidopsis metabolome data set were analyzed by imet - q. three public quantitation tools , including xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 , were used for performance comparison. from the mixture data set , seven standard metabolites were detected by the four quantitation tools , for which imet - q had a smaller quantitation error of 12 % in both profile and centroid data sets .
our tool also correctly determined the charge states of seven standard metabolites. by searching the mass values for those standard metabolites against human metabolome database , we obtained a total of 183 metabolite candidates. with the isotope ratios calculated by imet - q , 49 % ( 89 out of 183 ) metabolite candidates were filtered out. from the public arabidopsis data set reported with two internal standards and 167 elucidated metabolites , imet - q detected all of the peaks corresponding to the internal standards and 167 metabolites .
meanwhile , our tool had small abundance variation (<= 0.19 ) when quantifying the two internal standards and had higher abundance correlation (>= 0.92 ) when quantifying the 167 metabolites .
imet - q provides user - friendly interfaces and is publicly available for download at http :// ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw / comics / software _ imet - q.html .

introduction unbiased quantitation and identification of small - molecule metabolites in a biological system is important because metabolites serve as direct signatures of biochemical activity , making them relatively easier to correlate with disease phenotype and more suitable for clinical diagnostics [ 1 - 8 ] .
liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry ( lc - ms ) has become a conventional platform for analyzing metabolites across a large number of biological samples because of its ability to measure thousands of metabolites in a short period of time [ 2 , 5 , 9 - 13 ] .
however , it is a time - consuming process to manually calculate the abundances of thousands of metabolites from large - scale lc - ms data , and thus developing a software package to automatically quantify lc - ms metabolomics data becomes essential .
many commercial software programs have been developed by instrument vendors , such as progenesis qi ( waters ) , masshunter ( agilent ) , multiquant ( sciex ) , and xcalibur ( thermo ) .
but they usually accept data formats specific to their own instruments , and thus limit the possibility of integrating metabolite analyses across different analytical platforms [ 14 - 17 ] .
additionally , data processing algorithms implemented in these programs are mostly unavailable .
publicly available quantitation tools , on the other hand , accept multiple input data formats and provide description of their computational algorithms .
for example , xcms [ 18 ] , metalign [ 19 ] and mzmine 2 [ 20 ] accept input formats such as mzxml , mzdata , and netcdf .
xcms , implemented in r , c , and c ++ programming language , provides format conversion , noise filtering , peak detection , non - linear spectral alignment algorithms , and statistical analysis of lc - ms data .
metalign , an open interface - driven tool implemented in c ++ programming language , provides format conversion , mass calculation , baseline correction , peak - picking , saturation and mass peak artifact filtering , as well as data set alignment .
mzmine 2 , a modular - based tool implemented in java programming language , provides raw data import , raw data processing , peak detection , peak list alignment , normalization , visualization , peak identification , and statistical analysis .
however , some concerns of these public tools have been reported .
for instance , some tools combine binning with model fitting or use slope calculation approaches to perform peak detection , but these approaches may have low sensitivity on peak picking because the peak shapes vary greatly from one to another [ 21 , 22 ] .
due to different peak detection and peak alignment algorithms provided in each tool , it is difficult for users to optimize the algorithm - related parameters , which very likely affect the quantitation results [ 23 , 24 ] .
on the other hand , most of the tools do not provide deisotoping , and thus users have to apply additional packages , such as camera [ 25 ] , to perform isotope pattern assembly [ 21 ] .
to rectify the above concerns , we develop a quantitation tool , called imet - q ( intelligent metabolomic quantitation ) , written in c # programming language , which provides highly accurate quantitation and user - friendly graphical interfaces .
for peak detection , imet - q requires one input parameter , i.e. , mzwidth ( defined as the width of a peak in m / z dimension ) , and calculates the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a peak to dynamically determine its chromatographic width so that the peak boundary can be automatically determined ( i.e. , without requiring parameter input ) .
in addition , our tool determines the charge state of a peak by calculating the similarity between the peak shape of monoisotope and the peak shape of the second isotope peak .
once the charge state is determined , imet - q calculates its isotope ratio ( i.e. , the ratio of the second isotope abundance to the monoisotope abundance ) to facilitate metabolite identification .
since metabolites usually have smaller retention time drifts across lc - ms technical replicates , imet - q first aligns peaks across different lc - ms replicates of a sample and then across different samples .
in each alignment , loess regression algorithm [ 26 , 27 ] is applied to adjust peak retention time so that peaks in different lc - ms replicates / samples can be aligned according to their m / z and adjusted retention time values .
we used two metabolite data sets , an in - house standard mixture and a public arabidopsis metabolome data set [ 28 ] , to evaluate the performance of imet - q and compare it with three public quantitation tools , including xcms , metalign , and mzmine2 .
since the standard mixture was acquired in profile mode , we evaluated the performance of the four tools in both profile and centroid data sets , in which the centroid data set was converted from the profile data set by the centroiding function of proteowizard [ 29 ] .
as a result , imet - q had small quantitation error of 12 % in both profile and centroid data sets .
in addition , our tool correctly determined the charge state of seven standard metabolites , removed their isotope peaks , and calculated their isotope ratios. with the isotope ratios , we successfully filtered out 49 % ( 89 out of 183 ) metabolite candidates when using mass values of these standard metabolites to search in human metabolome database ( hmdb ) [ 30 ] .
for the public arabidopsis metabolome data set reported with two internal standards and 167 elucidated metabolites , imet - q detected the internal standards from all replicates and samples .
in addition , all of the 167 metabolites were also detected by imet - q , whereas 103 ( 62 %) , 145 ( 87 %) , and 129 ( 77 %) elucidated metabolites were detected by xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 , respectively .
comparing with the three quantitation tools , imet - q had relatively small abundance variations (<= 0.19 ) when quantifying the internal standards , and had higher abundance correlation (>= 0.92 ) when quantifying the 167 metabolites across replicates .

the solutions were dried with speedvac and re - dissolved by 100 l of meoh and water ( 2:1 , v / v ) with 0.1 % formic acid .
uplc / ltq - orbitrap ms a uplc system ( acquity , waters , milford , ma , usa ) equipped with a c18 reversed - phase column ( 2.1 x 100 mm , 1.8 m , hss - t3 ; waters , milford , ma , usa ) was coupled with a ltq - orbitrap mass spectrometer ( thermo scientific , san jose , ca , usa ) with an orthogonal electrospray ionization ( esi ) source .
the initial flow rate was 0.1 ml / min of 99 % solvent a ( 0.1 % formic acid ) and 1 % solvent b ( acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid ) .
a volume of 1mul of sample 1 and sample 2 were sequentially injected , and 6 technical replicates were conducted in profile mode on each standard mixture .
after injection , solvent b was maintained at 1 % for 5 min , then increased to 50 % during a time span of 9 min , then to 90 % over 6 min , and finally to 99 % over a period of 12 min after which this percent composition was held for 1 min .
the flow rate was changed to 0.5 ml / min , and after 5 min reduced to 0.1ml / min .
after 0.1 min , solvent b was reduced back to 1 % and held at this percentage for 7 min .
the mass spectrometer was controlled by using xcalibur 2.0.7 software ( thermo scientific ) and operated in positive ion mode on the m / z range from 120 to 1,000 with 60,000 resolution at m / z 400 .
the source and capillary voltages were set to 4500 and 35 v , and the temperatures of the capillary and the apci vaporizer were set to 275degreesc and 150degreesc .
internal calibration was performed using the ion signal of dioctyl phthalate at m / z 391.28 as a lock mass .
public arabidopsis metabolome data set a public arabidopsis metabolome data set of 36 samples acquired by lc - esi - q - tof / ms ( hplc : waters acquity uplc system ; ms : waters q - tof premier ) in positive - and negative - ion modes , with four technical replicates on each sample , was downloaded from the website of prime ( http :// prime.psc.riken.jp /) .
all replicates of the arabidopsis metabolome data set were acquired in centroid mode .
two internal standards , lidocaine ( m / z = 235 [ m + h ]+ , eluted at 4.19 min in the positive - ion mode data ) and camphor - 10 - sulfonic acid ( m / z = 231 [ m - h ] - , eluted at 3.84min in the negative - ion mode data ) were spiked in each sample with the same amount of 0.5 mg / l for abundance normalization and 167 metabolites were elucidated from this data set [ 31 , 32 ] .
data processing and software parameter settings data processing was performed on a microsoft windows 7 computer ( x64 edition service pack 1 with an intel xeon e5 - 2630 processor , 16 gb ram and 500gb hard disk drive ) .
all raw data files of the standard mixture experiment and the public data set were converted into mzxml format using proteowizard .
the acquired profile - mode data of standard mixture experiment was converted into two data sets , where one data set was directly converted to mzxml files ( called profile data set for convenience ) and the other was converted to mzxml files with an additional centroiding procedure in proteowizard ( called centroid data set for convenience ) .
since the public data was acquired in centroid mode , no additional centroiding procedure in proteowizard was performed .
both profile and centroid data sets of standard mixture were processed by four tools .
imet - q automatically skipped centroiding step when processing the centroid data set and used the following parameter setting : mzwidth = 0.02 , mztol = 0.02 , and rttol = 0.2 for both data sets .
for xcms , peaks in the profile and centroid data sets were first detected using matchedfilter and centwave function , respectively .
then the rector.loess and group.density functions were then applied to align the detected peaks across samples .
an additional fillpeaks fuction was performed for the recovery of missing peaks as suggested by the package vignette of xcms .
to optimize the xcms parameters , 42 parameter combinations were examined using the standard metabolites in the standard mixture as benchmarks .
the examination results of the 42 parameter combinations are listed in s1 and s2 tables , and the quantitation results generated using those parameter combinations are provided in s1 and s2 files .
the optimized xcms parameters on peak picking are : method = matchedfilter , fwhm = 30 , snthresh = 10 for profile dataset ; and method = centwave , ppm = 45 , snthresh = 10 , peakwidth = ( 5,20 ) for centroid dataset .
the optimized xcms parameters for both profile and centroid data sets on retention time correction and peak grouping are : method = loess , span = . 67 ; and method = " density " , mzwid = 0.03 , bw = 3 , minfrac = 0 , minsamp = 0 .
metalign only accepts and processes the centroid data set .
to run metalign , we selected the data type of accurate mass data with mass resolution of 10,000 and applied the default settings for the remaining parameters .
in mzmine 2 , the exact mass detector function and the centroid mass detector function were first applied to process the profile and centroid data sets , respectively , both with a noise level of 1,000,000 .
then the following functions were applied using the same parameters to process both data sets .
the chromatogram builder was used with the minimum time span , minimum height , and m / z tolerance set to be 0 , 0 and 0.02 , respectively .
for chromatogram deconvolution , baseline cut - off algorithm was used to detect peaks , where the minimum peak height , peak duration length , and baseline level were 1,000,000 , 0 - 2 min , and 1,000,000 , respectively .
the m / z and retention time tolerances in both isotopic peaks grouper and peak alignment were 0.02 and 0.2 min , respectively .
public arabidopsis data set was processed by imet - q with mzwidth , mztol , and rttol of 0.03 , 0.03 , and 0.16 min , respectively .
we used the xcms centwave function for peak detection , rector.loess and group.density functions for peak alignment , and fillpeaks function for the recovery of missing peaks .
to optimize xcms parameters on the public arabidopsis positive - and negative - mode data sets , 37 parameter combinations were examined on each set and the parameter combination achieving the best quantitation performance was selected .
the examination results of the parameter combinations are listed in s3 and s4 tables , and the quantitation results generated using those parameter combinations are provided in s3 and s4 files .
both data sets used centwave method in peak picking and the optimized xcms parameters for arabidopsis positive - and negative - mode datasets are : ppm = 30 , snthresh = 10 , peakwidth = ( 25 , 40 ) ; and ppm = 20 , snthresh = 10 , peakwidth = ( 5 , 20 ) , respectively .
next , in retention time correction and peak grouping , the optimized xcms parameters for both profile and centroid data sets are : method = loess , span = . 67 ; and method = " density " , mzwid = 0.03 , bw = 3 , minfrac = 0 , minsamp = 0 .
for metalign , we selected the data type of accurate mass data with mass resolution of 9,000 and applied the following parameter settings for data processing : maximum amplitude = 10,000 , peak slope factor = 1 , peak threshold factor = 6 , average peak width at half weight = 8 , maximum shift per scan = 35 , select min nr per peak set = 4 , and scaling options = none .
in mzmine 2 , we used the centroid mass detector with a noise level of 6 .
the minimum time span , minimum height , and m / z tolerance in the chromatogram builder were set to be 0.1 min , 6 and 0.03 , respectively .
for chromatogram deconvolution , baseline cut - off algorithm was used to detect peaks , where the minimum peak height , peak duration length , and baseline level were 6 , 0 - 1.6 ( min ) , and 6 , respectively .
the m / z and retention time tolerances in both isotopic peaks grouper and peak alignment were 0.03 and 0.16 min , respectively .
detected peaks by each tool were retained in the quantitation results if their retention time values were within the effective retention time range ( i.e. , 0.85 to 12 min ) and the peaks were detected in at least one sample .
robust algorithms for metabolite quantitation in order to process data from various mass spectrometers , imet - q accepts input files in netcdf , mzxml , and mzml formats , which can be conveniently converted from raw data by existing converters .
also , it accepts profile - mode and centroid - mode data .
the workflow of imet - q contains two main tasks , peak detection and peak alignment , as depicted in fig 1 .
performing peak detection on each input file generates a peak list that reports the m / z , retention time , charge state , isotope ratio , and abundance of detected peaks .
to compare compounds across different samples , imet - q aligns the detected peaks in the peak lists according to their m / z and retention time .
the detailed procedures of peak detection , peak alignment and quantitation result generation are described below .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146112.g001 fig 1 schematic depiction of imet - q workflow for peak detection and peak alignment .
peak detection centroiding signals in each scan centroiding , which can be performed during or after data acquisition , is a common first step for processing metabolomics data so that the data size can be greatly reduced .
it aims at combining multiple signals from the same compound into a single one with an m / z and intensity value [ 32 ] .
if the input files have already been centroided , imet - q automatically skips this step .
the detailed algorithm description is listed in s1 section .
removing noises from each scan due to nonspecific nature of esi , a great portion of signals in the spectra could be noise [ 33 ] .
it is essential to remove these noises to increase the effectiveness of peak detection .
instead of determining a fixed baseline for each spectrum , imet - q equally divides a scan into s segments ( s = 10 by default ) with an overlap of 20 % to avoid borderline issues and defines the average intensity in a segment as its noise level .
then , for each segment , signals with s / n less than a specific threshold ( 3 by default ) are removed from the scan , where s is the signal intensity and n is the noise level in the segment .
the number of segments and the s / n threshold are user - adjustable .
constructing extracted ion chromatograms ( eic ) with dynamically determining peak width after processing signals in each scan , imet - q uses a two - stage algorithm to construct the extracted ion chromatogram ( eic ) of a compound .
the two - stage algorithm includes signal clustering and eic boundary determination .
let s ={{ s11,s21 ,... , sn11 },{ s12,s22 ,... , sn22 },...,{ s1m,s2m ,... , snkm }} be the list of signals in all scans , where m is the total number of scans and nk is the number of signals in the kth scan .
in signal clustering , starting from the most intensive signal , say sij , among all scans in s , imet - q clusters signals in s with sij if the m / z differences between the signals and sij are within the given tolerance d , i.e. , mzwidth in imet - q. a cluster with at least three signals is further processed .
in the step of eic boundary determination , imet - q automatically calculates fwhm and then dynamically determines the boundaries using fwhm .
to be specific , for the most intensive signal in a cluster , say sij , with retention time t , the boundaries of the eic are initially determined as t +/ - w , where w is the fwhm .
to adapt to possible tailing effect of an eic , the boundaries are further extended by a tolerance at most 0.5w and are set to the farthest signal or a signal with local - minimum intensity in this range ( as shown in fig 2 ) .
then the trapezoid areas between any two adjacent signals of the eic are summed up as the abundance .
the two - stage algorithm is iteratively performed on the remaining unclustered signals to construct eics until all signals in s are processed .
in the following subsections , we term the constructed eics as peaks for convenience .
furthermore , each peak is represented by its apex , i.e. , using the m / z , retention time of the apex signal , and the associated abundance is recorded .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146112.g002 fig 2 a cartoon for the illustration of constructing extracted ion chromatograms .
the blue straight lines represent the clustered signals , w and t are the fwhm and retention time of sij , respectively .
signal a and b are determined as the boundaries of the eic , and the area in light blue color is the abundance .
determining the charge state and isotope ratio of peaks in order to determine the charge state and isotope ratio , imet - q first constructs an isotope envelope for a peak .
starting from the most intensive peak , p1 , in the current peak list , our tool groups it with all of its neighboring peaks having larger m / z values and decreasing intensities , i.e. , forming an isotope group .
if the m / z distance between the apex of any two peaks in the isotope group equals to 1 / z ( z can be 1 ~ 4 ) , the group is considered as a possible isotope envelope , where p1 and the peak adjacent to p1 are considered as the monoisotope peak and the second isotope peak , respectively .
then , to validate the correctness of the isotope envelope , imet - q calculates the peak shape similarity between the monoisotope peak and the second isotope peak by using the dot product as shown below : similarity = sumi = 1nxiyisumi = 1nxi2sumi = 1nyi2 ( 1 ) where n is the number of scans that both the monoisotope peak and the second isotope peak co - occur , and xi and yi are their respective signal intensities in the ith scan .
if the peak shape similarity between the two peaks is above a user - defined threshold ( 0.8 by default ) , we consider that all of the peaks in the isotope group form an isotope envelope and the charge state of p1 is determined as z. moreover , the isotope ratio of p1 is calculated as the abundance of the second isotope peak divided by the abundance of p1 , and the peaks in the isotope group are removed from further processing .
otherwise , the peaks do not form an isotope envelope and the charge state and isotope ratio of p1 are denoted as 0 .
the charge state determination procedure is repeatedly performed until all peaks are processed. by performing the above peak detection procedures , imet - q generates a peak list with charge state and isotope ratio information for each input replicate file .
note that the isotope peaks except the monoisotope in the confirmed isotope envelopes will not be reported in the peak list .
peak alignment for an input data set with multiple samples ( each probably with multiple technical replicates ) , imet - q performs the same algorithm for pair - wise alignment within a sample ( i.e. , aligning replicates ) and then across samples .
the algorithm is described as follows .
imet - q first selects the peak list that contains the largest number of detected peaks as the reference list and aligns other peak lists to it. for a pair of reference list and aligning peak list , imet - q uses peaks detected in both lists with their m / z and retention time differences within user - defined tolerances ( i.e. , mztol and rttol in imet - q ) as landmarks [ 34 ] .
given the retention time of landmarks in the reference list and in the aligning peak list as vectors a and b , respectively , imet - q uses loess regression [ 26 , 27 ] to generate a mapping between a and b with span of 20 % and weight of 1 since loess regression combines multiple linear least square regression models which fit localized subsets of the data .
the retention time of peaks , which are not landmarks , in either peak list are adjusted according to the loess regression model .
imet - q then aligns the peaks in both peak lists that satisfy user - defined m / z tolerance and retention time tolerance based on adjusted retention time .
repeating the above process for all peak lists , peaks can be aligned across replicates .
since peaks aligned from different replicates in a sample may have slightly different values of m / z and retention time , we use the median of their m / z and retention time as the representative peak in each sample .
then the same algorithm is applied to align all of the representative peaks across samples .
generating output of quantitation results in addition to viewing quantitation results in the main interface , imet - q reports the medians of m / z , retention time and abundance of the peaks in all replicates of all samples .
for the charge state of an aligned peak , imet - q displays the charge state that is detected in most replicates .
for the isotope ratio , imet - q collects the isotope ratios corresponding to the displayed charge state and reports the median as the isotope ratio .
quantitation results can be exported in.csv and.txt formats by users to conduct further analyses .
results and discussion we evaluated the performance of imet - q in metabolite quantitation by comparing the accuracy of detecting metabolites and the abundance consistency , calculated by pearson product - moment correlation coefficient ( ppmcc ) , of detected metabolites among replicates with xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 using samples ranging from a small standard data set ( seven standard metabolites ) to a complex biological data set ( public arabidopsis data set ) .
we also demonstrated the ability of imet - q on charge state determination and isotope ratio calculation .
performance evaluation on a standard metabolite mixture data to demonstrate the ability of imet - q , we used a standard metabolite mixture in which seven standard metabolites with different sample concentration in two samples were included for evaluation .
the sample ratio , defined as the detected abundance of a standard metabolite in sample 1 divided by that in sample 2 , is calculated for each of the seven metabolites in the standard metabolite mixture for the four quantitation tools .
both profile and centroid data sets generated from the raw data were processed by imet - q , xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 , respectively .
algorithms and parameter settings used in these tools were described in the subsection of data processing and software parameter settings .
table 1 shows the quantitation errors , which is defined as the difference between theoretical and calculated sample ratios divided by the theoretical sample ratios , of the seven standard metabolites calculated by the four quantitation tools .
detailed abundances and sample ratios calculated by the four tools are listed in s5 table .

as shown in table 1 , imet - q , xcms , and mzmine 2 had the average quantitation error of 12 % , 12 % and 13 % on the profile data set , and 12 % , 32 % and 14 % on the centroid data set .
metalign did not process the profile data set and had the average quantitation error of 14 % on the centroid data set .
the results showed that imet - q achieved the smallest quantitation errors and also had the same average quantitation error of 12 % in both profile and centroid data set , suggesting the robustness of imet - q on processing input files in both data type .
in addition to accurate quantitation , imet - q determined the charge state and isotope ratio of detected peaks .
in order to evaluate the charge state determined by imet - q , we used camera to annotate charge states and isotope peaks of the standard metabolites .
charge states and isotope peaks of the seven standard metabolites in both profile and centroid data sets annotated by imet - q were overall identical with camera 's annotation .
to demonstrate possible usefulness of isotope ratio information , we searched the mass of seven standard metabolites against hmdb [ 30 ] with mass tolerance of +/ - 5 ppm and adduct type of unknown ( assuming a user has little information on the spectra ) .
as a result , 183 metabolites candidates were obtained .
using imet - q 's calculated isotope ratios ( the isotope ratio tolerance is +/ - 0.02 ) to filter out unnecessary metabolite candidates , we reduced 49 % ( 89 out of 183 ) metabolite candidates ( s6 table ) .
the remaining metabolite candidates could not be filtered out by isotope ratios because they have the same chemical formula ( i.e. , identical theoretical isotope ratios ) .
performance evaluation on a public arabidopsis metabolome data the public arabidopsis data of 36 distinct samples collected from eight different plant classes ( classified by matsuda et al. ) was used to demonstrate imet - q 's performance on quantifying complex biological samples .
each sample contained two internal standards , one for positive - and the other for negative - ion modes , and 167 metabolites ( 71 detected only in positive - ion mode , 39 only in negative - ion mode , and 57 in both modes ) were elucidated from the data set [ 28 ] .
the performance of four tools were evaluated in terms of the accuracy on detecting the two internal standards and 167 elucidated metabolites , and the ability of properly clustering 36 samples into eight plant classes .
table 2 shows the reproducibility and normalized abundances of two internal standards detected by the four quantitation tools , where imet - q , xcms , and metalign detected all the internal standards from each replicate , achieving 100 % reproducibility , slightly better than mzmine 2 .
furthermore , imet - q reported normalized abundances of 1 +/ - 0.19 and 1 +/ - 0.18 for the two standard metabolites , comparable to the best 1 +/ - 0.18 reported by xcms and mzmine 2 for lidocaine and the best 1 +/ - 0.17 reported by xcms for camphor - 10 - sulfonic acid .

as a result , imet - q detected all of the elucidated metabolites , whereas xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 detected 103 ( 62 %) , 145 ( 87 %) , and 129 ( 77 %) of the elucidated metabolites , respectively .
we further evaluated the detected abundance of these metabolites .
since the exact abundance of 167 elucidated metabolites was unknown , we calculated the abundance correlation between any two replicates of a sample by ppmcc .
as a result , imet - q achieved an average replicate abundance correlation of 0.92 , whereas xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 achieved average abundance correlations of 0.87 , 0.78 , and 0.81 , respectively ( as shown in fig 3 ) .
the result revealed that imet - q not only achieved high accuracy on detecting the 167 elucidated metabolites but also provided very consistent quantitation result .

next , we examined whether replicates of the 36 samples could be properly clustered into eight plant classes using the quantitation results of the four tools .
we combined the quantitation results from positive - and negative - ion modes , and performed hierarchical clustering using matlab dendrogram function with ppmcc as the abundance correlation measure .
the combined quantitation results of the four tools are provided in s7 - s10 tables .
the numbers of detected peaks in the combined quantitation results of imet - q , xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 were 13079 , 7487 , 37364 , and 19394 , respectively .
fig 4 shows the hierarchical clustering results of the four tools .
the average abundance correlations of the eight plant classes using the combined quantitation results of imet - q , xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 were 0.71 , 0.75 , 0.65 , and 0.59 , respectively .
the detailed average abundance correlation of each plant class is shown in s11 table .
note that all the replicates of flower class , the best clustered plant class ( blue color in fig 4 ) , were clustered using imet - q 's combined quantitation result , and the average abundance correlation of the flower class was 0.88 .
this evaluation implies that , although the numbers of peaks detected by metalign and mzmine 2 were much larger than those detected by imet - q and xcms , peaks detected by imet - q and xcms might be more essential for distinguishing plant classes .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146112.g004 fig 4 hierarchical clustering by using the quantitation results of imet - q , xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 .
each entry in the tree leaves of a dendrogram represents a replicate .
for each tool , we first combined its quantitation results of positive - and negative - ion modes .
colors were assigned to each replicate in the combined quantitation results according to the plant classes which the replicates originated from as follows : orange for cotyledon , red for stem , green for leaf , blue for flower , light blue for shoot apex , yellow for root , pink for seed , and gray for silique .
next , the figure was produced using matlab dendrogram function with pmmcc as the abundance correlation measure between any two replicates in the combined quantitation results .
to overcome the bottleneck in metabolite identification based on ms1 data , a method utilizing both isotope ratio and in - source fragment information has been recently proposed , in which the same arabidopsis metabolome data set was also used for identification performance evaluation [ 35 ] .
according to the study , 19 out of 167 elucidated metabolites have been confirmed that some of their in - source fragments were detected in ms1 scans [ 35 ] , and the abundance correlations between the 19 metabolites and their fragments were above 0.8 .
we thus used the 19 confirmed metabolites to demonstrate the ability of imet - q. by calculating the abundance correlations between 19 metabolites and their in - source fragments , imet - q reported an abundance correlation of 0.94 , whereas xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 reported abundance correlations of 0.61 , 0.76 , and 0.66 , respectively ( as shown in fig 5 ) .
this result revealed that the abundances of the 19 metabolites and their in - source fragments were accurately detected and calculated by imet - q. furthermore , isotope ratios of 89.47 % ( 17 out of 19 ) metabolites were accurately calculated by imet - q , with differences within 0.05 to the theoretical ratio ( s12 table ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146112.g005 fig 5 the box plot of abundance correlations between 19 verified metabolites and their in - source fragments detected in the public arabidopsis data .
friendly user interfaces of imet - q we particularly implemented imet - q as a project - oriented quantitation platform , allowing users to conveniently quantify , manage and compare a large number of data sets or quantitation results in microsoft windows series platform ( including windows 7 , 8 , and windows server 2008 , 2012 ) .
to be specific , imet - q applies a tree structure to organize quantitation results , where each node represents a project and sub - nodes of a project represent the quantitation results ( as shown in fig 6 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0146112.g006 fig 6 the main graphical user interface of metab - q. the arabidopsis data from positive - ion mode is used as an example .
after processing the data , metab - q lists the detected peaks in the summary table where the peaks are sorted according to their retention time .
when users select peaks of interest in the summary table , the abundances of the selected peaks in different samples are plotted in the sample abundance plot and the detailed information of the selected peak in the technical replicates of a sample is listed in the panel below the summary table .
the left panel is the quantitation parameter explorer that lists the parameters of a quantitation .
users can use the provided filter function to narrow down the number of peaks in the summary table .
imet - q provides three wizards to guide users easily executing the program as follows .
first , a project wizard guides a user to create a project and designate a folder to store the project .
second , a quantitation wizard guides the user to quantify lc - ms - based data .
the wizard only requires the user to set up three quantitation parameters , i.e. , mzwidth , mztol , and rttol ; other parameters are optional .
since multiple technical replicates may be conducted on a sample , imet - q pops up a table to guide users to group technical replicates by the sample .
during quantitation , imet - q sequentially detects peaks from each replicate and then aligns those detected peaks across replicates / samples .
third , an export wizard guides the user to export quantitation results in common output formats , including.csv and.txt .
it also allows users to name the quantitation , designate the file for exporting , and set up criteria for filtering out unwanted peaks in order to focus on peaks of interest. with the conventional output formats , the user can easily import the quantitation results to other available tools , such as microsoft excel and matlab , for further statistical analysis .
to compare abundances across samples , imet - q hierarchically displays a quantitation result in the main interface , where the quantitation result is summarized in a summary table .
the summary table lists the m / z , retention time , charge state , isotope ratio , and abundance of all detected peaks in all samples for a quick overview .
the user can click on a detected peak of interest in the summary table , and the sample abundances of the selected peak will be plotted in the upper panel above the summary table .
meanwhile , the detailed information of the selected peak in the technical replicates of a sample will be listed in the panel below the summary table .
the user can double - click a row in the replicate table to view the extracted ion chromatogram of the peak .
in order to efficiently select peaks of interest in the summary table , imet - q provides a search function using the range of m / z , retention time , charge state , or isotope ratio to narrow down the peaks listed in the summary table .
conclusions many state - of - the - art quantitation tools have been proposed to allow users automatically quantifying metabolites from large - scale label - free metabolomics data sets .
the quantitation ability of these tools is beyond doubt .
however , a major concern of using these tools is the parameter setting for peak detection .
since peak shapes vary greatly from one to another , it is difficult for users to select an optimized parameter setting for peak detection .
in addition , most of the tools do not provide deisotoping , and thus users have to apply additional packages for isotope pattern assembly .
therefore , in this paper , we introduced an intelligent quantitation tool , imet - q , which is capable of dynamically determining the peak widths in liquid chromatogram dimension without input parameter , and automatically performing isotope pattern assembly .
in our evaluation , imet - q has the quantitation performance better than xcms , metalign , and mzmine 2 on standard and large - scale metabolome data sets .
besides , imet - q provides both the charge states and isotope ratios of detected peaks. with the charge state information , users can obtain accurate masses of detected peaks .
meanwhile , the isotope ratio information provides users an opportunity to reduce metabolite candidates .
although our evaluation demonstrates that the metabolite isotope ratios calculated by imet - q are close to the theoretical values , it is important to note that isotope ratio can be affected by noise interference , saturation effects and different experimental conditions [ 36 , 37 ] .
in addition to providing accurate quantitation , charge state , and isotope ratios , imet - q is equipped with friendly user interfaces so that quantifying metabolites become an easy task .
the software program is now publicly available for download at http :// ms.iis.sinica.edu.tw / comics / software _ imet - q.html .

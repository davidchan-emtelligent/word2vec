the liver is regarded as the toxicity target of qdnos , and the role of n - - > o group - associated various toxicities mediated by qdnos is well recognized .
however , the mechanism underlying the in vivo effects of meq on the liver , and whether the metabolic pathway of meq is altered in response to the pathophysiological conditions still remain unclear .
we now provide evidence that meq triggers oxidative damage in the liver .
moreover , using lc / ms - ittof analysis , two metabolites of meq were detected in the liver , which directly confirms the potential connection between n - - > o group reduction metabolism of meq and liver toxicity .
the gender difference in meq - induced oxidative stress might be due to adrenal toxicity and the generation of m4 ( 2 - isoethanol 1 - desoxymequindox ) .
furthermore , up - regulation of the mapk and nrf2 - keap1 family and phase ii detoxifying enzymes ( ho - 1 , gclc and nqo1 ) were also observed .
the present study demonstrated for the first time the protein peroxidation and a proposal metabolic pathway after chronic exposure of meq , and illustrated that the mapk , nrf2 - keap1 and nf - kb signaling pathways , as well as the altered metabolism of meq , were involved in oxidative toxicity mediated by meq in vivo .
quinoxaline - di - n - oxides ( qdnos ) possessing the quinoxaline - 1,4 - dioxide basic structure , are known to be potent antibacterial agents with a wide range of biological properties1234567 .
they had been developed for use in livestock because of their significant antibacterial abilities and growth - promoting properties3678910 .
carbadox ( cbx ) , olaquindox ( ola ) and quinocetone ( qct ) are the members of qdnos56 .
mequindox ( 3 - methyl - 2 - acetyl - n - 1,4 - dioxyquinoxaline , c11h10n2o3 ; meq ) ( fig. 1 ) , acting as inhibitor of dna synthesis , is a synthetic qdnos which acts as an antibacterial agent111213 .
meq has been widely applied in pigs and chickens in china since the 1980s owing to its strong inhibitory activities against both gram - positive and - negative species14 .
a lot of evidence suggested that the major metabolic pathway for qdnos involves n - - > o group reduction1215 , and that this type of metabolism is closely related to their toxicity101617 .
qdnos were reported to have the ability of hypoxia - selective dna cleavage218 .
a few studies revealed that the metabolites of cbx , ola and qct exhibit varying degrees of toxicity51019 .
2 - isoethanol 4 - desoxymequindox ( m11 ) , an n - - > o reduction metabolite of meq , was detected in the testis of the wistar rats after the exposure of meq ( 25 - 275 mg / kg diet ) for 180 days , where it was accompanied by oxidative dna damage12 .
meq and its primary metabolites n1 - desoxymequindox ( n1 - meq ) and bidesoxy - mequindox ( b - meq ) ( fig. 1 ) , were also found to be genotoxic in short - term in vitro and in vivo tests220 .
therefore , the metabolites were thought to participate in meq - induced liver damage .
however , to our knowledge , only two published studies have examined the effects of meq metabolites on the liver in vivo .
one study aimed to identify the metabolism , distribution , and elimination of meq in pigs , chickens , and rats14 , and another provided evidence that the metabolites of meq were related to the oxidative damage observed in wistar rats21 .
it has been well established that there are generally species - specific differences in the metabolism of drugs , and the expression of drug - metabolizing enzymes may be altered by pathophysiological conditions , including oxidative stress .
the metabolism of meq may also be altered in vivo after chronic exposure of animals .
therefore , it still needs to determine the potential toxic metabolites and the possible metabolic pathway of meq in the mouse liver under oxidative toxicity in the chronic toxic study of meq .
in previous studies , oxidative stress was found to be closely related to the damaging effects of qdnos , such as apoptosis , dna and lipid damage in vivo and in vitro222324 .
meq exhibited mutagenicity and was a potent inducer of dna damage via the production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) 25 .
oxidative - stress was also involved in the genotoxicity induced by qct and ola2627 .
as for the mechanism of genotoxicity , the production of ros , including superoxide anion () , hydroxyl radicals ( ho. ) and hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) during n - - > o reduction of qct by xanthine oxidoreductase ( xor ) , was shown to be a main factor in the dna strand breakage and generation of 8 - hydroxy deoxyguanosine ( 8 - ohdg ) 5 .
we recently showed that meq could result in adrenal toxicity by oxidative stress in h295r cells that originated from a human adrenocortical carcinoma28 .
it has been demonstrated that oxidative stress was one of the most important toxicity mechanisms in the adrenal gland29 , liver and spleen21 , and endocrine and reproductive systems12 in male wistar rats following exposure to meq .
although the oxidative damage invoked by qdnos , including meq , caused much more attentions , the role of some related signaling pathways still remains unclear .
the p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) and c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) are members of mapk cascades .
they are activated by oxidative stress303132333435 to adjust the intracellular redox status36 .
nuclear factor kappab ( nf - kappab ) is a sequence - specific transcription factor that functions in the immunological and cellular detoxifying defense systems3437 .
in response to oxidative stress , nrf2 translocates into the nucleus after dissociating from kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap 1 ) , and then binds to antioxidant response elements ( ares ) 383940 .
the nrf2 / keap1 / are pathway is a major cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress by mediating phase ii detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant enzymes41 .
the p38 - nrf2 signaling pathway has been shown to modulate oxidative stress in vitro4243 and in vivo3643 .
previous studies indicated that , along with ros generation , the phosphorylation of p38 and jnk were significantly increased in hepg2 cells after exposure to ola44 and qct45 .
additionally , the oxidative damage caused by qct involved the over expression of nrf2 in rat liver4647 and h295r cells48 .
however , to date , it is not clear whether the activation of the mapk , nrf2 - keap1 and nf - kappab pathways participate in oxidative liver damage caused by meq though they have the same quinoxaline ring .
based on the above information , this study was designed to investigate the hypothesis that meq - induced liver toxicity was associated with oxidative stress , the metabolism of meq and the activation of the mapks , nf - kappab , and nrf2 - keap1 signaling pathways .
since the liver , which is highly vulnerable to oxidative stress due to its high metabolic rate and low levels of endogenous scavengers , has been identified as one of the main target organs of qdnos495051 , we evaluated the liver toxicity in kunming mice after exposure to meq for 11 months .
in the present study , we investigated : ( 1 ) the effect of meq on body and liver weight , and morphological changes in livers ; ( 2 ) the effect of meq on the activities of albumin ( alb ) , alkaline phosphatase ( alp ) , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) in the serum of mice ; ( 3 ) identification the metabolites of meq in liver by lc / ms - ittof analysis ; ( 4 ) the effect of meq on the levels of reduced glutathione ( gsh ) and total superoxide dismutase ( t - sod ) , and on oxidative damage to lipids , proteins and dna , as measured by the levels of malondialdehyde ( mda ) , protein carbonyl content ( pcc ) , and 8 - ohdg ; ( 5 ) whether meq activated the oxidative stress upstream signaling pathways involved in liver damage ( e.g. p38 , jnk ) ; ( 6 ) the effect of meq on the mrna expression of some cytokines related to the activation and regulation of oxidative stress ( eg. nf - kb , nrf2 , keap1 , gclc , nqo1 and ho - 1 ) .
results body weight and liver coefficients the final body weight and liver coefficients of mice after administration of meq for 11 months are shown in fig. 2. the liver coefficients was expressed as ( wet weight of liver , mg )/( total body weight , g ) .
significant reductions in body weight were observed in the 25 mg / kg meq group ( p < 0.05 ) , and the 55 , 110 mg / kg groups ( p < 0.01 ) as compared with the control .
furthermore , there was a significant increase in the liver coefficients in the 25 , 55 mg / kg meq ( p < 0.05 ) , and 110 mg / kg meq ( p < 0.01 ) groups as compared with controls .
histopathological evaluation as shown in fig. 3 , obvious histopathological changes were observed in the liver after administration of 55 and 110 mg / kg meq .
the hepatic cells exhibited degeneration and necrosis ( a necrotic lesion ) in the 55 mg / kg meq group .
in the 110 mg / kg meq group , there was marked neutrophilic infiltration within and around the bile duct and most bile duct epithelium examined showed proliferation , in contrast to control group .
hepatocellular enzymes and liver function indices in comparison with the control group , three liver function indices - alb , alt and alp - showed increased serum activity in all the meq - treated groups ( fig. 4 ). the 25 mg / kg meq group also showed significantly increased levels of ast as compared to controls ( p < 0.05 ). this result was consistent with histopathological examination of liver , indicating the liver damage induced by meq .
meq and its metabolites in liver the prototype and metabolites of meq were determined according to the retention times and fragment ions .
the results showed that noprototype of meq was found , while only two metabolites ( m4 and m8 ) appeared in all treated groups ( fig. 5 ) .
accurate ms2 spectra of m4 and m8 identified them as 2 - isoethanol 1 - desoxymequindox ( the hydrogenation of the 1 - desoxymequindox ) and 2 - isoethanol 4 - desoxymequindox ( the hydrogenation of the 4 - desoxymequindox ) , respectively .
oxidative stress to establish whether oxidative stress was elevated in the injured mouse liver , we measured the generation of t - sod , gsh , mda , pcc , and 8 - ohdg in liver tissue as oxidative indices .
as shown in fig. 6 , significant increases in the levels of 8 - ohdg ( p < 0.05 ) and pcc ( p < 0.01 ) were noted in all treated groups as compared to controls .
the levels of gsh , mda and t - sod were significantly higher in the 110 mg / kg than in controls ( p < 0.01 or p < 0.05 ) .
interestingly , there were significant gender differences in the levels of t - sod , gsh and mda induced by meq .
at dose of 25 and 55 mg / kg meq , significantly increased levels of mda and gsh were also observed in both genders ( p < 0.01 ) .
however , after treatment with25 and 55 mg / kg meq , a significantly increased level of t - sod was observed in females ( p < 0.05 , p < 0.01 ) , but not in males .
after treatment with meq , females showed higher levels of mda and t - sod as compared to males , while males showed higher levels of gsh as compared to females .
activation of the nf - kb , mapk and nrf2 - keap1 signaling pathways to confirm whether meq - induced oxidative damage in the mouse liver induced various signaling pathways , the expression of some oxidative stress - related genes ( e.g. p38 , jnk , nrf2 , keap1 , nf - kb , ho - 1 , nqo1 , gclc ) were evaluated using real - time quantitative rt - pcr ( fig. 7 ) .
figure 7 shows that exposure to 110 mg / kg meq induced significant increases in p38 and jnk expression in the liver ( p < 0.01 ). with increasing meq doses , there was a significant increase in nrf2 expression ( p < 0.01 ) , and a marked reduction in keap1 expression ( p < 0.05 or p < 0.01 ) .
exposure to meq significantly induced the expression of nf - kb and nqo1 in all the treated groups ( p < 0.01 ) .
increased mrna expression of ho - 1 was observed after treatment with 110 mg / kg meq ( p < 0.01 ) , and gclc was significantly increased in both 55 and 110 mg / kg meqgroups ( p < 0.01 ) .
these results show a cellular protection response to oxidative stress mediated by chronic toxic study of meq .
discussion previous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress is associated with the in vitro toxicity of qdnos , including cytotoxicity264652 , adrenal toxicity2426 , genotoxicity5625274653 and apoptosis844455254555657 .
in vivo studies in rats11122129475859 and mice6061 have confirmed these findings .
however , relatively little is known about the metabolism and the molecular mechanisms that mediate their toxicity .
in the present study , we have demonstrated that the mapk pathway , nrf2 - keap1 family and nf - kb are closely related to the oxidative damage induced by meq in mouse liver .
a higher sensitivity to oxidative damage was observed in females , as compared to males , after chronic administration of meq for up to 11 months .
furthermore , we identified that m4 and m8 were critical metabolites responsible for the liver toxicity induced by meq .
interestingly , the pathways of meq metabolism may be altered under a toxic environment via the altered expression of drug - metabolizing enzymes .
additionally , besides the traditional and ho. , the intermediate radicals of meq may be the key steps in triggering oxidative damage and activating the mapk and nrf2 - keap1 pathways .
liver was identified as one of the main target organs for toxicity mediated by cya49 , qct50 and meq11 .
meq induced disorganized hepatic cord patterning , cellular swelling and centrilobular liver cell necrosis in wistar rats11 .
the altered levels of alb , alt , alp and ast indicate chronic liver disease1149 .
in the present study , a significant reduction in body weight and a significant increase in the liver coefficients were observed ( fig. 2 ) .
the histopathological evaluation showed marked liver damage , including extensive proliferation of the bile duct epithelium , and neutrophilic infiltrate within and around the bile duct .
in biochemical analysis , meq - mediated increase in serum alp exhibited disrupted plasma membrane bilayer and then resulted in efflux of serum alt ( cytosolic ) and ast ( mitochondrial ) .
these results were consistent with previous reports suggesting that liver damage occurs after sub - chronic oral administration of meq in wistar rats112129 .
a previous in vitro study reported that meq could be metabolized into ten metabolites after incubation with liver microsomes62 .
recently , quantitative analysis of the in vivo metabolism of meq revealed that m4 was a common metabolite of meq in liver models of pigs , chickens and rats14 .
in another study of the relationship between the metabolites and toxicity , m11 was identified as the main toxic metabolite in the liver and spleen of wistar rats after exposure to meq for 180 days21 .
the different metabolites detected in liver demonstrated the changed metabolic pathway of meq under the toxic environment , and therefore , m11 could be regarded as a biomarker of liver damage induced by meq .
it is generally accepted that the metabolic activity of the enzymes such as aldo - keto reductases ( akr ) and glutathione transferases ( gst ) has important consequences for the cellular redox status , and in turn , these enzymes could be regulated by oxidative stress7 .
expression of drug - metabolizing enzymes may be altered in response to the pathophysiological conditions of the imbalance oxidative stress ( fig. 8 ) .
thus , it was presumed that the alteration of meq - metabolizing enzymes such as carbonyl reductase 1 ( cbr1 ) , xanthine oxidoreductase ( xor ) , porcine aldehyde oxidase ( ssaox1 ) and cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) 34 was possible a reason for the altered metabolic pathway of meq under liver damage status .
further study should focus on the expression and activity of these metabolizing enzymes after chronic exposure to meq .
herein , the detection of m4 and m8 not only directly confirmed the potential connection between n - - > o group reduction metabolism of meq and its organ toxicity , but also , indicated that these metabolites may act as biomarkers of liver toxicity in mice .
apart from the deoxidation rate of qdnos6 , the appearance of ros and unstable oxygen - sensitive radical intermediates during n - - > o reduction of qdnos is considered to play a critical role in the dna damage1186364 .
previously , the production of oxygen - sensitive radical intermediates during qdnos metabolism was thought to explain the mutagenicity18 , antibacterial activity1 and hypoxic cytotoxin induced by these compounds6365 .
the varying degrees of genotoxicity caused by qdnos depends on the persistence of the ros species6 and the stability of the radical intermediates65 .
therefore , meq undergo intracellular one - electron enzymatic reduction to yield an oxygen - sensitive drug - radical intermediate and then generate highly reactive secondary radicals including , ho. and meq radical intermediates that ultimately cause oxidative stress and dna damage in the mouse liver ( figs 8 and 9 ) .
the metabolism of meq to m8 requires two steps , during which two radical intermediates were formed ( fig. 9 ) .
the proposed metabolic pathway in mice after chronic exposure of meq ( fig. 9 ) confirmed the critical role of radical intermediates in oxidative toxicity .
in order to demonstrate that exposure to meq caused oxidative stress in the mouse liver , we assayed five oxidative stress - related indicators .
the results showed that meq caused significant increases in the levels of 8 - ohdg , pcc , mda , t - sod and gsh .
previous studies also reported that the organ toxicity of meq in vivo was subjected to oxidative stress .
in a study to investigate the metabolic response of mice after exposure to meq at 15 , 75 and 350 mg / kg for 7 days , the oxidative damage was elevated by high doses of meq61 .
when rats were exposed to meq ( 25 , 55 , 110 and 275 mg / kg ) for 180 days , high doses of meq caused testicular , liver , kidney,and adrenal toxicity , along with oxidative damage122129 .
oxidative stress could impair the antioxidant defense system and result in serious damage to cellular macromolecules such as dna , lipids and protein24 .
however , to our knowledge , apart from mda and 8 - ohdg , no study about pcc induced by qdnos was investigated .
here , we tested the ability of meq to induce protein peroxidation in the mouse liver , and we firstly found that protein was also one of the major targets of meq - induced oxidative damage .
as the most abundant intracellular antioxidant , sod can serve as a redox biomarker of the antioxidant state66 , and the role of gsh is to protect cells against oxidative damage67 .
it was reported that administration of meq ( 275 mg / kg diet ) for 180 days in wistar rats caused testicular , liver , kidney , and adrenal toxicity along with a significant increase in sod activity and significant decrease in gsh levels122129 .
the increased levels of t - sod and gsh may be related to the activation of the upstream signaling pathway responsible for regulating oxidative stress .
this hypothesis was confirmed by further study on the nrf2 - keap1 family in mouse liver .
interestingly , there was an obvious sex difference in the levels of t - sod , gsh and mda .
the levels of mda and t - sod were higher in females , while the activity of gsh was higher in males , suggesting more serious oxidative stress in females .
these results were similar to a previous study that high doses of meq could significantly increase sod activities in females when rats were treated with meq ( 55 , 110 and 275 mg / kg ) for 90 days11 .
additionally , a few studies have reported adrenal toxicity caused by meq in vivo2629 and in vitro2848 .
previous findings have shown that long - term meq treatment induced reproductive toxicity via alterations in the expression of some genes responsible for cholesterol transport and testosterone synthesis12 , demonstrating the altered sex hormone secretion induced by meq .
the changes in sex hormone secretion may be an indirect effect of adrenal toxicity induced by meq .
these difference , in turn may explain the different sensitivities of males and females to meq - induced oxidative damage .
it was reported that the primary metabolites of meq - n1 - meq and b - meq - were partially and completely reduced derivatives of meq , respectively21468 .
our recent research revealed that n1 - meq showed higher adrenal toxicity than b - meq28 .
in amicronucleus test , the mice were treated with n1 - meq at dose levels of 0.08 , 0.16 , 0.31 mg / kg , n1 - meq ( 0.08 mg / kg ) induced a significant increase in the ratio of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes ( mn - pces ) in females while not in males2 , indicating an higher sensitivity of female mice to n1 - meq - induced genotoxicity .
the sex differences in n1 - meq - induced genotoxicity may correspond to the levels of meq - induced oxidative stress ( fig. 8 ) .
thus , we suspected that the occurrence of m4 ( hydroxylation of n1 - meq ) may be another reason for the sex differences in meq - induced oxidative damage ( fig. 8 ) .
to confirm whether the oxidative stress caused by meq is associated with the activation of some signaling pathway , we investigated mapk signal transduction , which showed higher levels of p38 and jnk expression following exposure to meq ( fig. 7 ) .
in two studies investigating mapk pathways in ola - induced apoptosis45 , and the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by qct58 , a significant increase in p38 and jnk were observed .
in the nucleus , nrf2 first forms dimers with c - jun before combining with are .
the increased expression of jnk could activate c - jun and indirectly stimulate the nrf2 - are pathway ( fig. 8 ) .
moreover , after treatment with meq , the overexpressed of p38 and jnk in the plasma promote phosphorylation of nrf2 ( fig. 8 ) .
nf - kb is a redox - sensitive transcription factor involved in the immunological and cellular detoxifying defense systems365969 .
previously , yu et al. discovered that qct - induced nephrotoxicity was accompanied by an increase in nrf2 expression47 , and the nf - kb and nrf2 / ho - 1 pathways could protect cells against the oxidative stress induced by qct59 .
the nrf2 - keap1 signaling pathway plays a significant role in regulating the expression of phase ii detoxifying enzymes and antioxidant enzymes that protect cells from endogenous and exogenous stresses3459 .
here , treatment with meq resulted in a significant increase in nf - kb and nrf2 gene expression , and a significant decrease in keap1 gene expression ( fig. 7 ) .
these findings indicated that the high level of p38 , as well as jnk , nf - kb and nrf2 expressions may be a cellular protective response to meq oxidative stress ( fig. 8 ) .
to further reveal the possible downstream genes of nrf2 - keap1 family following exposure to meq , we measured its target gene products including nqo1 , ho - 1 and gclc .
these enzymes protect against oxidative stress - induced toxicity either via scavenging ros directly or via catalyzing the synthesis of antioxidant and detoxifying substrates indirectly70 .
our data showed that meq exposure induced marked increases in ho - 1 and gclc levels ( fig. 7 ) .
these results indicated that ho - 1 and gclc may mediate a protective effect against meq - induced oxidative damage .
nqo1 has been reported to play an important role in xenobiotic metabolism and in protecting against oxidative stress induced by the intermediates produced during xenobiotic detoxification71 .
here , a significant dose - dependent increase in the induction of nqo1 was observed in all meq - treated groups .
nqo1 may involved in the metabolic reaction of hydroxy and hydrogenated production of m4 and m8 .
in the present study , the increased expression of nqo1 was suggested to be associated with the generation of m4 , m8 and meq radical intermediates .
this result illustrates the important role of nqo1 in the metabolism of meq .
in conclusion , the current study demonstrated that m4 and m8 may represent the major toxic metabolites of meq causing oxidative liver damage in vivo , and that oxidative stress plays a key role in the liver toxicity .
the pathways governing the metabolism of meq may be altered by changes in the activity of the meq - metabolizing enzymes under the imbalance of cellular redox status .
further study should be conducted to investigate the activity of the meq - metabolizing enzymes and the roles of meq radical intermediates under this case .
sex - specific differences in oxidative stress were observed in mice after administration of meq .
it seems that the adrenal toxicity was possible an indirect reason for sex difference in oxidative stress caused by meq .
the protein was firstly identified as the major target of meq - induced oxidative damage .
the present findings also reveal that nf - kb , as well as mapk ( p38 and jnk ) signaling pathways and the nrf2 - keap1 family are involved in meq induced - redox imbalance damage in the mouse liver .

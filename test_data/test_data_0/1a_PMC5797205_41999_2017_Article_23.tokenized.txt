objectives to examine older inpatients' experiences with medical student education , their views on future interactions , and to seek their opinion on the most important curricular topics related to geriatric medicine .
methods the study involved 112 non - confused inpatients older than 65 years of age , who completed a uniformed questionnaire on the day of their discharge from a teaching hospital .
results the mean age was 81 years , with equal number of male and female participants .
57 % interacted with the students during their admission , the majority being interviewed and examined .
almost all ( 92 %) of these patients described their experience as positive , some described it as time - consuming ( 23 %) , repetitive ( 19 %) and tiresome ( 9 %) .
92 % of all participants agreed that the older patients should be part of medical students' education .
dementia , cardiac conditions , cancer , arthritis , isolation / loneliness were highlighted as the most important topics to teach medical students related to geriatric medicine , while patience and listening were listed as important skills .
they suggested practical , easily implemented advice for the improvement of the interaction between students and older patients ; including allowing more time for interactions and for students to speak louder .
conclusions older patients felt positively about their interactions with medical students , and believed that older patients should be involved in medical student education .
as well as medical conditions such as dementia , cardiac disease and cancer , these patients highlighted isolation and loneliness as important topics for undergraduate geriatric medical education , implying that students should learn about broader aspects of older patients' health and wellbeing .
keywords older inpatients experience medical students education patient / student interaction issue - copyright - statement ( c ) european geriatric medicine society 2018 introduction the trend of increasing patients' involvement in their own care and in medical student education continues [ 1 , 2 ] .
it aims to improve patients' quality of care , as well as student experience and professional development [ 3 , 4 ] .
university hospitals attribute their attractiveness to patients to their staff 's greater knowledge , acquired through their teaching roles [ 5 ] , while medical schools foster patient / student interaction .
patients , despite being central to medical education , at times provide passive illustrations of interesting conditions or contribute to the students' experiential learning when opportunistically available in hospitals [ 6 , 7 ] .
during undergraduate medical education patient interactions , partly due to their authenticity , were shown to benefit students and are judged by some to be indispensable [ 8 ] .
however , the learning on actual patients has also been described as " inappropriate " for the twenty - first century , and ethical questions about the use of patients as a training resource have been raised [ 9 , 10 ] .
simulation - based education can help with these issues and protect patients from any possible risks [ 11 ] , but rationale for the active involvement of patients in health professional education remains , and include benefits to patients and students [ 1 , 12 , 13 ] .
at present older patients make up an increasing proportion of hospital admissions , and also participate more in undergraduate education , however little is known about their attitude and experiences related to such educational activities .
we conducted a survey on older patients' involvement and experience in medical student education during their hospital stay at the the oxford university hospitals trust , john radcliffe hospital ( ouht , jrh ) .
it explored their views on future involvement in medical student education , as well as their opinion on which skills and topics they believed are of particular importance for undergraduate medical education related to geriatric medicine .
methods during the 4th , 5th and 6th years of their oxford medical degree , students spend the majority of their time at ouht , which provides services for a population of approximately 500,000 , with an unselected medical and surgical admission system .
the size of the population of inpatients over the age of 65 during the time of our survey in ouht , jr was 1290 ( 13 wards ) .
students are in direct contact with patients who consent to the students' involvement .
they participate in patient care , bedside teaching , taking patient histories , as well as performing examinations and procedures such as venepuncture and peripheral venous cannulation , under supervision .
the patients for the study were recruited on their discharge day at the randomly selected wards ( 5 wards ) , where the students attend their teaching ; at the acute general and geriatric medical wards , surgical wards , and at the hospital discharge lounge .
the study was conducted between 03 / 10 / 2015 and 19 / 03 / 2016 on random days depending on the investigators' availability to administer the survey .
the patients eligible for the study were older than 65 years , not confused , as confirmed with the abbreviated mental test score ( amts ) of > 8 , ( a brief test of cognitive function in the general hospital which defines cognitive impairment if amts < 9 ) , and capable of communicating their verbal consent .
as older patients admitted to the ouht , jrh have cognitive screening on admission , the notes of all older wards inpatients were screened for the amts by the investigators and every eligible patient was approached to participate in the study .
they were asked to complete a survey that contained various questions relating to their experience with medical students during their admission , as well as their thoughts on potential interactions in the future .
there was a mix of multiple choice questions , rating scale questions and open - ended questions .
only a small number refused to participate in the study , the reasons were not investigated .
112 patients completed the questionnaire after giving verbal consent .
the study was granted audit approval , and quantitative data was analysed using the spss software package .
qualitative data was coded into themes for analysis .
results the mean age of patients was 81 years ; 49 % male , 49 % female , 2 % did not state .
the majority of patients ( 90 %) were white british , slightly higher compared to the uk 2011 census data ( 87 %) .
4.5 % did not state their ethnicity , and several patients gave answers about their nationality , listing that they are scottish , welsh , south african , afro - caribbean and cypriot .
the most common reasons for admission were falls , collapse , infections , shortness of breath and gastro - intestinal ( gi ) related problems ( non - specific abdominal pain and problems related to hernia , gallstones , gi bleeds and bowel obstruction ) .
their health self - rating status included 1 - 5 ( 1 very poor , 5 very good ) and ranged from 1 ( 3 %) , 2 ( 8 %) , 3 ( 43 %) , 4 ( 30 %) , 5 ( 16 %) .
the mean length of hospital stay was 6.1 days .
59 ( 57 %) patients were aware of medical students being involved in some way with them during their admission , and were most commonly interviewed and examined by the students , while an invasive procedure , venepuncture , was less commonly performed ( fig. 1 ) .
9 ( 8 %) patients were not sure if they interacted with a medical student , and 39 ( 35 %) did not interact with a medical student. fig. 1 the most common interactions older patients had with medical students during this admission 82 % of patients who interacted with students during their admission would agree to have their blood taken by a student in the future , while in those patients who did not interact with students only 61 % would agree ( p < 0.02 ) .
for those who would not agree , explanations include : " shallow veins " , " i am worried the blood may not be taken properly " , " i am scared of needles " , " they are not experienced and i do not want any pain caused by blood tests " .
patients who interacted with students were also more likely to agree to being examined ( 94 vs 77 % p < 0.02 ) and interviewed ( 97 vs 80 % p < 0.01 ) in the future , but not more likely to agree to be involved in bedside teaching ( 92 vs 80 % p > 0.05 ) .
the majority of all patients ( 92 %) either ' agreed ' or ' strongly agreed ' with the statement ' older patients should be part of medical students training ' .
a variety of reasons were given , 28 % of patients saying that " students had to learn " or similar , while some ( 9 %) made reference to the ageing population .
other common reasons given include : " older patients are more experienced " , " older people often have lots of health problems " and " to broaden training and understanding " .
3.5 % of patients disagreed or strongly disagreed and did not want to interact with students in the future in any way .
reasons included : " i do n't want students involved , i would prefer to see a doctor if i am ill " and another said " students can learn more from other patients " .
3.5 % of patients were ' unsure ' whether they agreed or disagreed , and 1 % left this question blank. of the patients who interacted with medical students in some way during their admission , 93 % felt useful to the students' training and 92 % described their experience as ' positive ' ( fig. 2 ) .
less favourable comments regarding their interactions included : ' time consuming ' 23 % , ' repetitive ' 19 % , and ' tiresome ' 9 % .
no patients described their experience as a ' negative ' , despite one patient describing it as ' painful ' while a blood sample was taken by a student - - the same patient describes other multiple interactions ( examination , interviews , bedside teaching ) and was still happy to participate in bedside teaching and have blood taken by a student in future .
patients who described their experience with students as ' interesting ' were more likely to agree to be examined in the future ( chi squared test p < 0.05 ). fig. 2 how patients describe their experience with students the most frequent topics that patients thought were important for undergraduate students to learn about older patients are listed in table 1 .
dementia , heart conditions and cancer were the most commonly chosen topics .
29 % of patients mentioned at least one of their own conditions .
loneliness and isolation were also listed as topics to teach medical students .
although not specifically asked about important skills for medical students , 8 ( 7 %) patients mentioned ' listening ' and 6 ( 5 %) mentioned ' patience ' as important .
when asked how their interactions with medical students could have been improved , answers included : " allow more time for students to examine " , " be more assertive " , " explain things better " , " speak louder " , and " try to listen and understand patients " .
table 1 conditions that older patients suggested it would be important for students to learn during geriatrics ( some patients suggested more than one condition ) condition number of patients % dementia 33 29 heart conditions 23 21 cancer 18 16 arthritis 14 13 respiratory conditions 11 10 diabetes 8 7 blood pressure 6 5 ageing 5 4 falls 4 4 isolation / loneliness 3 3 discussion only 57 % of patients were sure of medical students being involved in some way with them during their admission .
students usually interact with the patients who display educational physical signs or medical history , so not every inpatient is asked to participate in student teaching .
there are some days with no students on the wards due to other teaching commitments .
it is possible that some patients did not realize they were interacting with students , as they dress and behave in a similar way to the doctors , and are of a similar age , although they do wear orange badges stating they are students and are introduced to the patients as students .
our cohort of patients were younger , with slightly more male participants when compared to other hospital surveys ( 84 years , 44 % male patients ) , which could influence our results , as more negative patients attitude towards involving medical students in their care was observed in younger , female patients [ 14 , 15 ] .
the data on the ethnicity was not complete , however higher proportion of white british inpatient population may have influenced the results , knowing that the white - british population appears to be more positive towards medical student participation , when compared to the non - white - british population [ 16 ] .
it was not surprising that only the minority of patients , 11 % , rated their health very poor / poor , as the interviewed patients were well enough to be discharged on that day .
this may have the implications on their positive attitude to their participation in the medical students education .
most patients described their experience as positive , none described their experience as negative .
patients who did spend time with students were more willing to be examined , interviewed or have blood taken in the future than those who did not .
this suggests that patients who feel that they had gained something from their interaction with the students are more receptive to further interactions .
patients who seemed to have had less positive experience with students were not less likely to agree to see students in the future .
this indicates patients accept that students need to learn and are understanding that students may not get everything right .
the advice on the improvement in interaction between students and older patients was encouraging , practical , and easily implemented ; suggesting longer time for the interaction , and for students to be more assertive and speak louder .
almost all participants thought older patients should be a part of medical students' training , with many stating that " students had to learn " , implying that students interacting directly with older patients is necessary for the training process .
some commented on the ageing population implying that it is more important than ever for students to learn from the older patients .
they also said that older patients are more experienced , who often have multiple health problems , implying that students needed to interact with older patients in order to learn about their more complex health needs .
they were more willing to be involved with interviews or to be examined than to have blood taken , with some having concerns that a student taking bloods might not do it properly .
this is understandable ; an interview or examination is non - invasive whereas venepuncture has the possibility of being painful and repeated attempts may be needed .
they seemed very aware of this - - but also saying that a student taking blood would be acceptable if supervised .
this shows that while older patients are willing to help students learn , they may be less willing if they feel their treatment is being affected or that their experience might cause discomfort .
these results are similar to the other studies , where minority of patients describe their future participation conditional and raise potential concerns , for example about confidentiality , the nature of presenting complaints , and consent obtaining [ 17 , 18 ] .
when asked about conditions in geriatric medicine that students should learn about , patients listed most frequently : dementia , heart conditions and cancer .
this is not an unexpected list , as these conditions cause a large burden of disease in the population of older people , however , surprisingly only a minority mentioned falls and ageing .
they also identified isolation and loneliness , suggesting that patients believe medical students need to learn about broader aspects of older patients' health and wellbeing , not only about disease .
currently the british geriatrics society recommended curriculum in geriatric medicine for medical undergraduates [ 19 ] and oxford medical school geratology curriculum do not include some of the specific topics listed by the patients ( e.g. cancer , heart and respiratory conditions , isolation and loneliness ) .
strengths and limitations a strength of our study is that it provides insight into areas where prior research is sparse .
another strength is the administration of the anonymised questionnaire on the day of their discharge , meaning patients were more likely to give honest answers .
one weakness of the study is not establishing what preparation for participation in teaching the patients received .
also , this was a single institution study with many questionnaires administered by medical students , introducing a possible bias that patients may not be willing to document their true thoughts with a medical student present .
there was also no randomisation for which patients were asked to complete surveys , instead all eligible patients who gave consent and who were in the randomly chosen wards when the investigators were available to conduct the study were included .
another weakness is that those patients who did not interact with students were not asked if this was because they refused to , or because they simply did not come across students during their admission .
so while patients who did see students appeared more willing to see them again , it is unclear whether this is because the experience was a positive one , or because those unwilling to see students had already requested not to during that current admission .
conclusion this study has several implications for educational practice in geriatric medicine ; older inpatients reported positive experience with medical students education , although some outlined less favourable aspects , necessitating further elaboration and the development of a strategy to improve these .
they were willing to participate in medical students education again , slightly less in invasive procedures , such as venepuncture .
they believed that with the ageing population , it is more important than ever for students to learn from the older patients , and that older people should help educate the doctors of the future .
participating in medical student education increased older inpatients willingness for future involvement with students , suggesting that patients who feel that they had gained something from their interaction with the students are more receptive to further interactions .
educators should consider dedicating more time for student / older inpatient interactions and help students to improve their ability to listen , to give better and louder explanation and be more assertive .
geriatric curriculum development should consider the inclusion of new topics like isolation and loneliness .

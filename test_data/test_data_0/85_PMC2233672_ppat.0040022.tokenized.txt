the ikappab kinase ( ikk ) complex is a key regulator of signal transduction pathways leading to the induction of nf - kappab - dependent gene expression and production of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
it therefore represents a major target for the development of anti - inflammatory therapeutic drugs and may be targeted by pathogens seeking to diminish the host response to infection .
previously , the vaccinia virus ( vacv ) strain western reserve b14 protein was characterised as an intracellular virulence factor that alters the inflammatory response to infection by an unknown mechanism .
here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of b14 inhibited nf - kappab activation in response to tnfalpha , il - 1beta , poly ( i : c ) , and pma .
in cells infected with vacv lacking gene b14r ( vdeltab14 ) there was a higher level of phosphorylated ikappabalpha but a similar level of ikappabalpha compared to cells infected with control viruses expressing b14 , suggesting b14 affects ikk activity .
direct evidence for this was obtained by showing that b14 co - purified and co - precipitated with the endogenous ikk complex from human and mouse cells and inhibited ikk complex enzymatic activity .
notably , the interaction between b14 and the ikk complex required ikkbeta but not ikkalpha , suggesting the interaction occurs via ikkbeta .
b14 inhibited nf - kappab activation induced by overexpression of ikkalpha , ikkbeta , and a constitutively active mutant of ikkalpha , s176 / 180e , but did not inhibit a comparable mutant of ikkbeta , s177 / 181e .
this suggested that phosphorylation of these serine residues in the activation loop of ikkbeta is targeted by b14 , and this was confirmed using ab specific for phospho - ikkbeta .
author summary vaccinia virus ( vacv ) is the live vaccine used to eradicate smallpox and is also the most intensively studied poxvirus .
like many poxviruses , vacv produces a wide variety of proteins that inhibit parts of the host response to infection .
consequently , the virus can escape destruction by the immune system and be passed on to additional hosts .
here we report a new vacv immune evasion mechanism mediated by protein b14 , a protein that contributes to virus virulence .
b14 functions by interacting with a cellular protein called ikkbeta , which is critical for mounting an innate immune response to infection , and also plays important roles in cancer and cell death .
b14 prevents ikkbeta being activated and consequently the cellular signaling pathway leading to activation of nuclear factor kappa b ( nf - kappab ) is not induced .
without activation of nf - kappab the host cell cannot produce other molecules that amplify the innate immune response to infection .
this mechanism of action of b14 fits nicely with the observed increase in the host response to infection by a vacv strain lacking the b14r gene .
lastly , an increased understanding of how b14 inhibits ikkbeta function may lead to development of novel drugs against this important cellular enzyme .

doi : 10.1371 / journal.ppat.0040022 introduction nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) is critical for the innate and adaptive immune responses to infection .
various stimuli , such as the pro - inflammatory cytokines interleukin ( il ) - 1 and tumour necrosis factor ( tnf ) , activate signaling pathways leading to nf - kappab - dependent gene expression [ 1,2 ] .
several of these signaling pathways converge on the ikk complex [ 3 - 5 ] , and this complex is therefore a prime target for anti - inflammatory drugs .
it is also a logical target for pathogens aiming to minimize the host response to infection .
the ikk complex , or signalosome , comprises a heterodimer of ikkalpha and ikkbeta in association with nf - kappab essential modifier ( nemo also called ikkgamma ) [ 6,7 ] and is critical for nf - kappab activation induced by pro - inflammatory cytokines [ 8 - 10 ] .
the ikk complex is activated by upstream kinases , such as transforming growth factor - beta ( tgfbeta ) - activated kinase - 1 ( tak1 ) , which phosphorylates ikkbeta at ser177 and ser181 located in the activation loop [ 2,4,5 ] .
once activated , ikkbeta phosphorylates the inhibitor of nf - kappab ( ikappabalpha ) [ 11 ] to initiate ikappabalpha degradation .
phosphorylated ikappabalpha ( phospho - ikappabalpha ) is recognized by an f - box / wd protein , beta - transducin repeats - containing proteins ( beta - trcp ) , which functions as a receptor subunit of the scf family ubiquitin ligase complex , and binds to the phosphorylated e3 recognition sequence on ikappabalpha [ 12 - 15 ] .
this poly - ubiquitinated ikappabalpha remains associated with nf - kappab but is degraded selectively via the 26s proteasome [ 16 ] .
after ikappabalpha degradation , nf - kappab is translocated into the nucleus to induce transcription of responsive genes [ 17 ] .
poxviruses have developed strategies to modulate important cellular signaling pathways to evade host responses [ 18 - 20 ] .
these viruses target many of the primary mediators of immune system including il - 1 , il - 18 , interferons ( ifns ) , tnf , complement , and chemokines [ 20 - 23 ] .
many of the genes encoding vaccinia virus ( vacv ) immunomodulators show amino acid similarity to host proteins that function in the immune system .
however , others lack such similarity ; for instance , the intracellular virulence factor n1 [ 24 ] , anti - apoptotic protein f1 [ 25,26 ] , and secreted chemokine binding protein [ 27 ] .
vacv and other poxviruses interrupt the activity of nf - kappab in several ways [ 21,28 ] .
one strategy is to secrete proteins from the infected cell to bind cytokines , chemokines , or ifns and prevent these reaching their receptors on cells .
another strategy is to express intracellular factors to regulate signaling pathways leading to nf - kappab activation .
among these intracellular inhibitors , vacv proteins a52 and a46 antagonize il - 1r and toll like receptor ( tlr ) signaling [ 29 - 31 ] and n1 is a virulence factor [ 24 ] that is reported to interfere with nf - kappab and irf3 activity [ 32 ] .
in addition , the crystal structure of n1 reveals it is a bcl - 2 - like protein and n1 was shown to protect cells from apoptosis [ 33 ] .
vacv protein k1 also inhibits nf - kappab activation during infection [ 34 ] .
lastly , protein m2 downregulates erk - mediated nf - kappab induction in virus - infected cells [ 35 ] .
b14r is one of the few vacv genes that are located in the terminal region of the virus genome and yet is conserved in many orthopoxviruses [ 36 ] , suggesting an important function .
however , b14 lacks sequence identity with proteins from outside poxviruses .
an initial characterization of b14 showed it is an intracellular virulence factor that is expressed early during infection and affects the inflammatory response to infection in a murine model by an unknown mechanism [ 37 ] .
in this study , the mechanism of action of b14 has been investigated .
data presented show that b14 associates with and inhibits the activity of the ikk complex and thereby inhibits nf - kappab activation from multiple signaling pathways .
this mechanism of action is consistent with the in vivo phenotype of a virus lacking the b14r gene [ 37 ] .
results b14 inhibits multiple signaling pathways leading to nf - kappab activation bioinformatic analyses indicated that b14 is a member of a family of poxvirus proteins that include b14 , k7 , c6 , and a52 [ 38 ] .
subsequently , the a46 protein was shown to be related to a52 and was added to this family [ 29 ] .
given that proteins a46 and a52 are intracellular inhibitors of tlr signaling pathways [ 29 - 31 ] , the presence of b14 in the same family suggested that b14 might also act to regulate signaling pathways leading to nf - kappab activation .
to investigate the effect of b14 on nf - kappab activation , a plasmid containing a luciferase reporter gene linked to a nf - kappab - dependent promoter was transfected into hela cells and these cells were stimulated with il - 1beta ( figure 1a ) , tnfalpha ( figure 1a ) , or pma ( figure 1b ) .
luciferase activity was increased greatly by addition of each stimulant but the level reached was reduced in a dose - dependent manner in the presence of b14 .
similar findings were observed using hek 293 cells ( unpublished data ) .
moreover , b14 decreased poly ( i : c ) - induced nf - kappab dramatically ( p - value = 0.0006 ; 95 % decrease ) ( figure 1e ) .
in contrast , b14 did not reduce luciferase activity from isre ( figure 1c ) and ap - 1 ( figure 1d ) reporter genes induced by ifnalpha and pma , respectively .
notably , b14 increased pma - induced ap - 1 activity slightly ( p = 0.02 ; 1.5 - fold increase ; figure 1d ) .
we also observed a small but significant reduction in poly ( i : c ) - induced isre activity in the presence of b14 ( p - value = 0.01 ; 29 % decrease ; figure 1e ) .
however , it is uncertain if these relatively small changes seen with these reporter assays are relevant biologically .
as a control we also expressed a20 , a de - ubiquitinating enzyme that downregulates nf - kappab and irf3 [ 39 - 41 ] and observed strong inhibition of both pathways ( figure 1e ) .
figure 1 b14 inhibits nf - kappab activation hela cells were co - transfected with reporter plasmids for 100 ng of nf - kappab ( a and b ) , isre ( c ) , ap - 1 ( d ) , and 50 ng of psv - beta - galactosidase in all cases .
pci - b14 was transfected where indicated and the amount ( ng ) per well is shown .
the total amount of dna applied in each reaction was adjusted to 400 ng using pci empty vector .
these transfected cells were stimulated with 100 ng / ml of il - 1beta , tnfalpha , ifnalpha , or 50 ng / ml of pma for 8 h as indicated .
luciferase activity was measured and normalized to beta - galactosidase intensity in the same well in triplicate wells .
( e ) hek 293 cells were co - transfected with prl - tk and reporter plasmid for nf - kappab (*) , isre (*) , and plasmids expressing gfp , a20 , and b14 .
these cells were stimulated with 5 mug / ml of poly ( i : c ) for 12 h and then were lysed to measure luciferase activity using dual - specific luciferase assay kit ( promega ) .
differences in the fold activation of the indicated reporter in cells transfected with the empty vector and cells expressing b14 were analysed by student 's t - test and the p - values are indicated : * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 .
therefore , b14 is a specific downregulator of nf - kappab but did not inhibit ap - 1 or irf responsive gene expression .
the fact that b14 inhibits multiple pathways leading to nf - kappab activation suggests that b14 might act at a position at or downstream of the site at which these pathways converge , namely the ikk complex .
b14 associates with the ikk signalosome to examine how b14 downregulates nf - kappab activation , we searched for interactions between b14 and potential ligands using a luminescence - based mammalian interactome mapping ( lumier ) assay [ 42 ] .
components of the ikk complex were included in the assay because several pathways leading to nf - kappab activation converge on this complex .
ha - tagged b14 and a20 were transfected into cells together with different proteins fused with luciferase , and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti - ha mab .
the immunoprecipitates were then tested for luciferase activity ( figure 2a ) .
b14 interacted with ikkalpha , ikkbeta , and nemo but not with tbk1 , ikkepsilon , p65 , and a20 .
as expected , a20 showed no interaction with any proteins screened in the assay except itself [ 43 ] .
these observations indicated that b14 interacts with the ikk complex .
previously , vacv protein n1 was reported to interact with and inhibit the ikk complex [ 32 ] and therefore flag - tagged n1 was also included in this assay .
surprisingly , no interaction between n1 and ikkalpha , ikkbeta , or nemo was observed ( figure 2b ) , although flag - b14 and ikkalpha each co - precipitated with the ikks .
flag - gfp was included as a negative control and did not bind to the ikks .
collectively , these data show that b14 , but not n1 , associates with the ikk signalosome .
figure 2 vacv - expressed b14 associates with the ikk signaling complex cells were co - transfected with expression vectors for indicated proteins tagged with ha ( a ) or flag ( b ) epitopes and the indicated protein fused with luciferase .
the indicated tagged bait protein was immunoprecipated by correspondent monoclonal ab and then the immune complex was eluted to be analysed for luciferase activity .
data presented are from one of the three independent experiments .
( c ) hela cells were infected with vb14 and a cell extract was prepared and analysed by size exclusion chromatography on a superose 6 column .
an aliquot of each fraction was separated in 4 % - 12 % nupage and analysed by immunoblotting with the indicated abs .
the position of protein size markers is indicated in kda at the top .
( d ) extracts from hela cells infected with the vdeltab14 ( delta ) or vb14 - ha ( ha ) were pre - cleared and immunoprecipitated with mabs against ha , nemo , and gsk3beta ( isotype control ) .
the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved in 4 % - 12 % nupage and then were analysed by immunoblotting with the abs indicated on the right , respectively .
sizes of bands detected are indicated on the left in kda .
to investigate these protein interactions further , we fractionated vacv - infected cell extracts by size exclusion chromatography ( sec ) and blotted the fractions with antibody to b14 .
b14 eluted in two peaks corresponding to approximately 160 kda and 700 - 900 kda , despite having a monomeric size of 17 kda .
given that the ikk complex also has a mass of between 700 - 900 kda [ 1 ] , we immunoblotted the column fractions with antibodies to ikk components and found that the ikk complex co - purified with the first b14 peak ( figure 2c ) .
the column fractions were also blotted with ab to n1 and this showed that n1 eluted with a mass of approximately 60 - 70 kda ( figure 2c ) , quite distinct from the ikk complex and also distinct from the expected position of the 28 - kda n1 homo - dimer [ 24 ] .
therefore , b14 , but not n1 , co - purified with the ikk complex in the vacv - infected cell lysates .
the possible interaction between b14 and the ikk complex was investigated further by immunoprecipitation .
hela cells were infected with a vacv strain expressing an ha - tagged version of b14 ( vb14 - ha ) or vacv lacking gene b14r ( vdeltab14 ) [ 37 ] , and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared .
b14 - ha was immunoprecipitated with anti - ha mab and immunoprecipitates were analysed by immunoblotting with abs against ikkalpha and ikkbeta , nemo , or ha ( figure 2d ) .
the anti - ha mab precipitated b14 - ha together with ikkalpha , ikkbeta , and nemo from the vb14 - ha infected cell lysates ( figure 2d , lane 4 ) .
the interaction between b14 and the ikk complex was also seen in the reciprocal immunoprecipitation using antibody to nemo ( figure 2d , lanes 5 and 6 ) and anti - ikkalpha / beta ( unpublished data ) .
in contrast , b14 and the ikk complex were not co - immunoprecipitated with a control mab against glycogen synthase kinase ( gsk ) - 3beta ( figure 2d , lanes 7 and 8 ) .
in summary , b14 and the ikk complex co - purified and co - precipitated when each component was expressed at natural levels .
to identify which of the ikk components interacts with b14 , mouse embryo fibroblasts ( mefs ) lacking ikkalpha or ikkbeta were analysed as above for hela cells ( figure 3 ) .
in vb14 - ha - infected wild type mefs b14 co - precipitated with the ikk complex ( figure 3a , lane 4 ) .
in the absence of ikkalpha or ikkbeta , the anti - nemo mab still precipitated a complex of ikkbeta - nemo and ikkalpha - nemo , respectively ( lanes 5 and 6 ) .
however , b14 was co - precipitated from ikkalpha but not ikkbeta null mefs , indicating that b14 was incorporated in the ikkbeta - nemo complex ( lane 5 ) and that ikkbeta was needed for b14 to be part of the ikk complex .
as a control , an anti - flag mab did not immunoprecipitate any proteins ( figure 3a , lanes 7 - 9 ) .
the interaction between b14 and ikkbeta was also investigated by sec of extracts from wild type , ikkalpha , or ikkbeta null mefs ( figure 3b ) .
b14 only co - purified with the ikk complex of 700 - 900 kda when ikkbeta was present , but was present in the second peak of 160 kda in all samples .
so , ikkbeta is necessary for b14 to co - purify or co - precipitate with the ikk complex .
figure 3 b14 binds to the ikk complex via ikkbeta ( a ) wild type , ikkalpha null , and ikkbeta null mef cells were infected with vb14 - ha and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using anti - nemo mab .
the immunocomplex was resolved by sds - page ( 12 % gel ) and analysed by immunoblotting using the indicated abs .
( b ) cell extracts from vb14 - ha - infected mefs were prepared and analysed by sec on a superose 6 column .
proteins from each fraction were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and 15 % of the sample was separated in a 12 % sds - page and analysed by immunoblotting using the indicated abs .
ikk activity is downregulated by b14 upon stimulation , the ikk complex phosphorylates ikappabalpha and this is then removed quickly via the proteasome system .
therefore , we examined the level of ikappabalpha in cells stimulated with tnfalpha in the presence and absence of b14 ( figure 4 ) .
the amount of ikappabalpha was reduced dramatically at 20 min after tnf treatment but had recovered to the original level by 50 min .
however , in the presence of b14 the level of ikappabalpha was greater at 20 min post - stimulation with tnf .
thereafter , the level of ikappabalpha recovered to that before stimulation .
equal loading of samples was demonstrated by blotting for alpha - tubulin .
therefore , b14 increased ikappabalpha stability after tnf stimulation , implying a negative effect on ikk activity .
figure 4 the effect of b14 on ikappabalpha b14 was expressed in hela cells by transfection and the cells were treated with tnfalpha for the indicated times .
then tnf was washed away and extracts were prepared and analysed by immunoblotting with the indicated abs .
cell lysates ( 15 mug per lane ) were resolved by sds - page ( 15 % gel ) and analysed by immunoblotting with the abs indicated on the right .
sizes of bands detected are indicated on the left in kda .
the above experiment was performed in cells expressing b14 after transfection .
to investigate whether the endogenous levels of b14 could affect ikk activity during virus infection , the phosphorylation status of ikappabalpha was investigated in cells infected with vacv strains that do or do not express b14 .
cells were infected with wild type ( vb14 ) , deletion mutant ( vdeltab14 ) , or revertant ( vb14 - rev ) viruses [ 37 ] at 2 p.f.u. / cell and at 2 and 4 h p.i. , cytoplasmic fractions were prepared and analysed by immunoblotting ( figure 5 ) .
the level of ikappabalpha was indistinguishable in infected or uninfected cells , and similarly there was no difference following infection with viruses that did or did not express b14 .
however , following infection by all viruses , the level of phospho - ikappabalpha was increased , but the increase was noticeably higher in cells infected with vdeltab14 , compared to vb14 and vb14 - rev .
to show that each virus caused equivalent infection , cell extracts were immunoblotted with antibody to the vacv intracellular protein n1 [ 24 ] , and n1 was detected at similar levels in each sample at 2 h p.i. and at slightly higher levels in each sample later during infection ( 4 h ) ( figure 5 , bottom panel , lanes 2 - 4 and 6 - 8 ) .
in contrast , b14 was present in vb14 - and vb14 - rev - infected cells only .
as expected , each vacv protein was absent in mock - infected cells .
this suggested that b14 reduces ikk activity during vacv infection .
figure 5 b14 reduces the phosphorylation of ikappabalpha in vacv - infected cells cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from hela cells at the indicated times after mock - infection ( m ) or infection with vb14 ( w ) , vdeltab14 ( delta ) , and vb14 - rev ( r ) at 2 p.f.u. per cell .
cytosolic proteins ( 15 mug per lane ) were resolved by sds - page ( 15 % gel ) and analysed by immunoblotting with the abs indicated on the right .
sizes of bands detected are indicated on the left in kda .
the effect of b14 on ikk activity in the absence of other vacv - encoded nf - kappab inhibitors was investigated next using an in vitro kinase assay .
plasmids expressing traf2 or ha - tagged ikkbeta were co - transfected with or without pci - b14 .
traf2 acts as an intracellular stimulator of ikk activity .
extracts from transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti - ha mab .
the activity of the immunoprecipitated ikk complex was studied using a synthetic ikappabalpha peptide substrate and 32p - gamma - atp followed by sds - page and autoradiography .
notably , the level of the phospho - ikappabalpha peptide was reduced in the presence of b14 , indicating b14 inhibited ikk activity ( figure 6 ) .
coomassie blue staining of the sds - polyacrylamide gel indicated that similar amount of the immunoprecipitated ha - ikkbeta and substrate peptides were applied in the assay ( figure 6 , lower panels ) .
figure 6 b14 inhibits ikk - mediated phosphorylation of ikappabalpha hek 293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins ( 2 mug of vectors expressing b14 , traf2 , and ha - ikkbeta ) .
the empty vector pci was used to adjust the total dna added to 6 mug per reaction per 10 cm dish .
after 24 h , 1.5 mg of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti - ha mab for 3 h at 4 degreesc .
the immune complex was incubated with 5 mug of ikappabalpha peptide and 5 muci 32pgammaatp for 10 min at 30 degreesc .
the kinase assay was terminated by adding protein loading buffer and the mixture was resolved and analysed by coomassie staining followed by autoradiography ( top panel , kinase assay ) .
protein markers ( kda ) were indicated on the left .
n.s. indicates non - specific band .
to study the effect of b14 on ikk activity further , the ikk complex was activated by overexpression of either ikkalpha or ikkbeta ( figure 7a ) , and b14 was found to inhibit this activation significantly and in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 7a ) .
this indicated that b14 acts at , or downstream of , the ikk signalosome .
the site of action was investigated further using ikk constitutively active mutants , ikkalpha ss / ee and ikkbeta ss / ee that contain mutations in the activation loop [ 2 ] ( figure 7b ) .
b14 inhibited ikkalpha ss / ee significantly and in a dose - dependent manner .
in contrast , there was only a small ( 15 %) reduction of ikkbeta ss / ee - induced nf - kappab activation in the presence of the highest amount of b14 .
these findings imply that once ikkbeta is activated , b14 can no longer prevent nf - kappab activation and also suggest a model in which b14 inhibits activation of the ikk complex by preventing phosphorylation of ikkbeta in the activation loop .
figure 7 the effect of b14 on ikkalpha and ikkbeta - induced nf - kappab activation hek 293 cells were co - transfected with reporter plasmids for nf - kappab ( 90 ng ) , tk - rhl as internal control ( 10 ng ) , and the indicated amount of plasmids expressing either wild type ikkalpha or ikkbeta ( a ) , constitutively active ikkalpha or ikkbeta ( b ) , or b14 ( a and b ) .
the total amount of dna applied in each reaction was adjusted to 500 ng using pci empty vector .
after 24 h , the cells were lysed and the activities of both luciferases were measured using dual - specific luciferase assay kit ( promega ) in triplicates .
differences in the fold activation of the nf - kappab reporter induced by the indicated ikk subunit in cells transfected with the empty vector and cells expressing b14 were analysed by student 's t - test and the p - values are indicated : * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 .
this hypothesis was tested directly by using ab to detect ikkbeta that has been phosphorylated in the activation loop at serine 177 and 181 ( figure 8 ) .
ha - tagged ikkbeta was transfected into 293 t cells either alone or together with increasing concentrations of b14 .
in the absence of transfected ha - ikkbeta no phospho - ikkbeta was detected , but after addition of ha - ikkbeta , phospho - ikkbeta was observed easily and was reduced in a dose - dependent manner as the concentration of b14 increased .
notably , while the amount of phospho - ikkbeta decreased in the presence of b14 , the amount of total ha - ikkbeta remained fairly constant and blotting for tubulin confirmed equal loading of samples .
therefore , b14 inhibits nf - kappab activation by preventing phosphorylation of ikkbeta in the activation loop .
figure 8 b14 inhibits phosphorylation of ikkbeta on ser 177 / 181 hek 293t cells were transfected with vectors expressing b14 ( 3 , 1.2 , and 0.6 mug ) and ha - ikkbeta ( 2 mug ) .
the empty vector pci was used to adjust the total dna added to 5 mug per reaction per 6 cm dish .
after 24 h , cell lysates were resolved by sds - page ( 15 % gel ) and analysed by immunoblotting using the abs indicated on the right ( the anti - ha mab was used to detect total ha - ikkbeta ) .
sizes of bands detected are indicated on the left in kda .
discussion in this study , vacv protein b14 is shown to inhibit the ikk complex and to downregulate nf - kappab - dependent gene expression , which is crucial for the innate and adaptive immune response to infection [ 3,4 ] .
our previous in vivo study , using recombinant vacvs that do or do not express b14 , demonstrated b14 is an intracellular virulence factor that modulates the inflammatory response in vivo [ 37 ] .
the activity of b14 described here is consistent with this phenotype : downregulation of nf - kappab - dependent expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines will alter recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of infection and so diminish the ability of the host to fight infection .
notably , a virus lacking the b14r gene was attenuated compared to parental virus [ 37 ] .
the ikk complex is critical for activation of nf - kappab [ 3,44 - 46 ] and therefore is a logical target for modulation by pathogens [ 4,47 ] .
b14 is one of several vacv proteins that inhibit signaling pathways leading to nf - kappab activation , but these proteins all have non - redundant functions because when the gene encoding each inhibitor is deleted individually , the deletion mutant displays an in vivo phenotype [ 24,29 - 31,37 ] .
therefore , these proteins must each have distinct functions .
in this regard , b14 differs from a46 and a52 in that it targets a broader array of immune signaling pathways ; for instance , a46 and a52 inhibit il - 1 but not tnf - induced signaling , whereas b14 inhibits both ( figure 1a ) .
also a46 and a52 target the signaling pathways upstream of the ikk complex [ 29 - 31 ] , whereas b14 targets the activity of the ikk complex .
b14 also differs from n1 in that n1 was reported to inhibit signaling pathways leading to nf - kappab activation [ 32 ] and to ifn responses via tbk1 [ 32 ] , whereas b14 did not inhibit ifn responses induced by either ifnalpha or poly ( i : c ) ( figure 1e ) .
n1 was reported to target to the ikk signalosome by binding to the kinase complex when both components were overexpressed [ 32 ] .
however , three independent experiments shown here contradict this : first , n1 did not bind to ikk components in the lumier assay ( figure 2b ) ; second , n1 did not co - purify with ikk during biochemical fractionation of infected cells ( figure 2c ) ; and third , n1 did not co - precipitate with ikk components using the anti - nemo mab ( unpublished data ) .
in addition , we showed previously that under the conditions tested n1 did not affect nf - kappab activation in vacv - infected cells [ 33 ] .
therefore , b14 , but not n1 , associates with the ikk complex and thereby inhibits nf - kappab responsive gene expression .
concerning the site of action of b14 , it is clear that b14 shuts down expression of reporter genes with nf - kappab - responsive promoters in response to multiple stimuli ( figure 1 ) and that within infected cells the overall level of ikappabalpha is not altered by virus infection ( figure 5 ) or by the expression of b14 in resting cells ( figure 4 ) .
however , in the presence of b14 there is a reduced level of phospho - ikappabalpha in the infected cell lysates ( figure 5 ) and a reduced degradation of ikappabalpha in tnfalpha - stimulated cells .
these findings suggest a possible effect of b14 on the ikk activity .
direct evidence for the reduced phosphorylation of ikappabalpha by ikk in the presence of b14 was provided by an in vitro kinase assay using a synthetic ikappabalpha peptide substrate and ikk that had been immunoprecipitated from cells ( figure 6 ) .
therefore , the mechanism of action of b14 lies upstream of ikappabalpha phosphorylation .
consistent with this , b14 was found to co - purify with the ikk complex from infected cells and to co - precipitate with the ikk complex using specific antibodies either against tagged b14 , nemo ( figures 2 and 3 ) , or against ikkalpha / beta ( unpublished data ) .
notably , the assembly of the ikk complex was not interrupted by b14 .
furthermore , use of ikk null mefs revealed that ikkbeta is the target of b14 in the complex and b14 did not bind to or disrupt the ikkalpha - nemo complex ( figure 3b ) .
these findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of b14 on the activity of the ikk complex is not due to disassembly of the ikk complex .
b14 inhibited nf - kappab activation driven by overexpression of either ikkalpha or ikkbeta ( figure 7a ) or by expression of the constitutively active ikkalpha ss / ee mutant in which the ser176 and ser180 in the activation loop were mutated to glutamic acid ( figure 7b ) .
in contrast , b14 was unable to inhibit nf - kappab gene expression by a similar constitutively active ikkbeta ss / ee mutant ( figure 7b ) , indicating ikkbeta but not ikkalpha is the target for b14 .
furthermore , b14 associated with the ikk complex via ikkbeta ( figure 3 ) and inhibited phosphorylation of ikkbeta in the activation loop ( figure 8 ) , thereby downregulating the activity of the ikk complex .
however , once the ikkbeta subunit is activated , b14 may not be inhibitory .
b14 co - purified with the ikk complex but was also present in a 160 - kda complex , much larger than the mass of monomeric b14 ( 17.3 kda ) .
consistent with these findings , recombinant b14 made in escherichia coli was oligomeric ( unpublished data ). whether b14 is the only protein in the 160 - kda complex or whether it is complexed with other unidentified cellular or viral protein ( s ) is unknown .
however , its presence in this complex suggests b14 might have function ( s ) additional to that described here .
for instance , the slight increase of pma - induced ap - 1 activity in the presence of b14 ( figure 1d ) may result from interaction of b14 with an unidentified protein ( s ) .
alternatively , this may be a consequence of the downregulation of nf - kappab responsive genes that negatively regulate ap - 1 activity .
there is ample precedent for small vacv proteins having more than one immunomodulatory activity .
for instance , protein a52 is both a tlr inhibitor and an activator of p38 kinase to modulate il - 10 [ 48 ] .
in summary , vacv virulence factor b14 inhibits the ikk signalosome by preventing phosphorylation of ikkbeta in the activation loop , resulting in inhibition of nf - kappab - dependent gene expression .
this mechanism of action fits with the observed increased inflammatory response in vivo to infection with a virus lacking gene b14r [ 37 ] .
overall our findings reveal a novel strategy used by vacv to modulate cellular signaling pathways to aid viral immune evasion .
the b14 may be an interesting target to develop anti - inflammatory therapeutics directed against the ikk complex .

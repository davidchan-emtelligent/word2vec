the influenza virus type a ( iva ) is an important pathogen which is able to cause annual epidemics and even pandemics .
this fact is the consequence of the antigenic shifts and drifts capabilities of iva , caused by the high mutation rate and the reassortment capabilities of the virus .
the hemagglutinin ( ha ) protein constitutes the main iva antigen and has a crucial role in the infection mechanism , being responsible for the recognition of host - specific sialic acid derivatives .
despite the relative abundance of ha sequence and serological studies , comparative structure - based analysis of ha are less investigated .
the 3dflu database contains well annotated ha representatives : 1192 models and 263 crystallographic structures .
the relations between these proteins are defined using different metrics and are visualized as a network in the provided web interface .
moreover structural and sequence comparison of the proteins can be explored .
metadata information ( e.g. protein identifier , iva strain , year and location of infection ) can enhance the exploration of the presented data. with our database researchers gain a useful tool for the exploration of high quality ha models , viewing and comparing changes in the ha viral subtypes at several information levels ( sequence , structure , esp ) .
the complete and integrated view of those relations might be useful to determine the efficiency of transmission , pathogenicity and for the investigation of evolutionary tendencies of the influenza virus .
database url : http :// nucleus3d.cent.uw.edu.pl / influenza introduction the influenza virus type a ( iva ) is one of the most important , untamed pathogens , which can easily overcome the immunological control of a host and escape the pharmaceutical treatment with specific drugs ( 1 ) .
the virus is responsible for recurrent epidemics causing hundreds of thousands of fatal cases annually ( 2 ) .
the hemagglutinin ( ha ) protein is the main antigen of iva and exhibits a remarkably high degree of polymorphism .
the ha regulates the influenza virus entry into the host cell , thus it has a strong impact on both pathogenicity and epidemiological consequences of the iva infection .
furthermore the protein plays a crucial role in the virus' mechanism of action , defining the likelihood of the interaction between the host cells ( e.g. human , swine , chicken , mallard , duck and other bird and mammal species ) and the infecting virus .
the specific sequence and structural features of the binding site of a given ha protein are responsible for the differential recognition of host - specific sialic acid derivatives ( 3 , 4 ) .
hence the analysis of ha variability at the molecular level is crucial for the correct understanding of the specific organisms' risk of infection .
for example , it has been recently shown that some strains of a / h5n1 serotype , isolated from birds , can convert to human - specific strains .
these strains can effectively infect mammals by airborne droplet transmission , by mutating only four positions in its ha ( 5 ) .
although the analysis of ha genetic variability is classically applied to sequence and serological data , a comparative analysis of ha structure - based data could enhance the prediction of potentially dangerous viral strains , allowing the estimation of risk of pandemics .
the 3dflu database contains a collection of ha homology models , which represent the receptor binding site variability of this protein across the most common influenza strains .
only specific iva - serotypes ( h1 , h2 , h3 , h5 , h7 , h9 , h10 ) were chosen as they represent either serotypes which caused human pandemics in the last century : 1918 ( h1 ) , 1957 ( h2 ) and 1968 ( h3 ) ( 6 ) or the avian - infecting serotypes ( h5 , h7 , h9 , h10 ) for which sporadic human infections with high fatality rate were recorded ( 7 - 10 ) .
another criterion for selecting this specific set of serotypes was the availability of multiple crystallographic structures .
additionally , ha structures obtained from the protein data bank ( pdb ) database ( 11 ) were also included .
insightful structure - based information for all the entries are provided , along with the metadata obtained from different public sources .
the web - application was designed to enable the easy access to the resources available in the database .
these include the visualization of structures , sequences and various types of relations between the proteins .
several influenza - focused web - accessible databases such as : the ncbi influenza virus resource ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / genomes / flu / flu.html ( 12 ) , global initiative on sharing avian influenza data epiflu database ( gis - aid , http :// www.gisaid.org ) ( 13 ) , the influenza virus database , ( http :// influenza.psych.ac.cn /) ( 14 ) , the openflu database ( http :// openflu.vital - it.ch ) ( 15 ) and the influenza research database ( ird , http :// www.fludb.org ) ( 16 ) , are already available .
however 3dflu presents a unique aggregation of ha - selected information .
the interactive exploration of these proteins and their relations is facilitated by the provided web interface. with our database researchers gain a tool to access several layers of information about influenza virus ha. such integrated view might be useful to determine the efficiency of transmission , pathogenicity and evolutionary tendencies of the virus .
the collected models can be utilized by other researchers in applications such as virtual high - throughput screening for designing new ha inhibitors , or prediction of a host shift , by a given iva serotype that might results in a global epidemic .
methods data sources the ha sequences were extracted from the following databases : uniprot ( http :// www.uniprot.org /) , ncbi ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /) , embl - ebi ( http :// www.ebi.ac.uk /) , ird ( https :// www.fludb.org /) and gisaid ( http :// platform.gisaid.org /) .
the metadata were retrieved from the original data sources and afterwards manually curated .
for each entry the following metadata were retrieved : virus subtype , year of the infection , host species and geographic location of the infected host .
it must be noted that in four cases ( abd79101 , abd79112 , agq47740 , agq47776 ) information about localization is missing while for three entries ( ago00313 , ago00337 , agq47835 ) no date of infection is available .
all the available crystal structures of ha were downloaded from the pdb ( http :// www.rcsb.org ) .
the structures were selected on the basis of their completeness ( ha fragments were removed ) and crystallographic quality .
structures with resolution values > 3.0 a or free r - values > 0.3 were automatically discarded .
homology modeling the templates for the homology modeling were selected using blastp ( version 2.2.28 +) ( 17 ) .
for each target sequence the closest available structure , having a resolution value lower than 3.0 a and a free r - value lower then 0.3 , was selected as a template .
multiple sequence alignments ( msas ) between templates and target sequences were constructed using the pcma software ( version 2.0 ) ( 18 ) .
the models were built using modeller ( version 9.15 ) ( 19 ) .
ten structures were reckoned for each model .
for each entry the pseudo - energy criterion , returned by the method , was used to select the best model .
the quality of each model was further assessed using the qmean ( 20 ) and molprobity ( 21 ) servers .
both servers provide access to scoring functions which estimate the quality of the models , also allowing the identification of potentially unreliable regions .
the validation of our homology modeling routine is provided in the supplementary materials .
structural analysis tm - align ( 22 ) was used for the structural alignment of pdb structures and protein models .
the adaptive poisson - boltzmann solver software package ( apbs , version 1.4.1 ) ( 23 ) was then applied to compute the electrostatic potentials ( esp ) .
the center of the ha 's globular domain was empirically selected as the center of the esp grid .
the grid dimensions were 56.0 , 44.8 and 44.8 a , while the number of points per axis were 161 , 129 and 129 for the x , y and z axes , respectively .
the distance between each point in the cubic grid is therefore 0.35 a. similarities between protein pairs were measured in terms of sequences , structures and electrostatic potentials .
the sequence similarity score was obtained applying the python library pairwise2 ( http :// biopython.org /) .
the proposed global sequence alignment was scored using blosum62 matrix .
the root - mean - square deviations ( rmsd ) of atomic positions were computed using tm - align ( 22 ) .
finally the esp similarities were obtained from the protein interaction property similarity analysis software ( 24 ) .
the msa of the protein sequences was performed using pcma ( 18 ) and 3d - coffee ( 25 ) .
the secondary structural elements for each model were computed with the use of dssp ( 26 ) .
the mobility of protein residues was estimated applying the gaussian network model ( gnm ) .
the python library prody ( 27 ) containing the gnm implementation was used for this purpose .
selected amino acid indexes were applied to the protein sequences in order to describe them in terms of specific physico - chemical properties .
the following list of high - quality indexes ( 28 ) was extracted from the amino acid index database ( 29 ) : blam930101 , biov880101 , maxf760101 , tsaj990101 , nakh920108 , cedj9 70104 , lifs790101 , miys990104 .
the schematic representation of the data preparation is given in the supplementary figure s1 .
if not stated otherwise , the default parameters were used for all the above mentioned programs .
protein network visualization each protein is defined as a node in a force - network model .
each edge has an elastic constant defined as a function of the distance between the two proteins considered , using the selected metric .
the spring constant kij is defined by the equation 1 , where the distance scale d and the exponent a are chosen empirically .
moreover , for performance reasons only the links having a value above a manually set threshold were included in the computation .
the position was computed applying the force layout from the d3.js library ( https :// d3js.org /) .
( 1 ) dij = e - ( dijd ) a database structure the database is available for download as a single compressed file .
it contains the following data : metadata for all the entries .
processed 3d structures for both pdb entries and models .
distance matrices ( rmsd , esp , sequence similarity ) .
sequence and structural alignments .
hqi indexes .
electrostatic potential grids calculated with apbs .
the data structure is described in details in the supplementary materials .
results data initially all the available sequences of the h1 , h2 , h3 , h5 , h7 , h9 , h10 serotypes were extracted from publicly available databases .
this procedure resulted in 22 800 unique sequences .
according to our estimations up to 7 % of those might contain different types of errors .
in order to enhance the quality of the final data , the original data were initially manually processed .
the sequences containing ambiguous iupac codes ( http :// www.bioinformatics.org / sms / iupac.html ) were treated as uncertain and consequently excluded. from the obtained set only unique sequences were selected .
if multiple sequences shared the same gene identifier the one with the earliest date of sample isolation was chosen as a representative of that subset .
as a consequence out of the 22 800 sequences originally downloaded 21 984 were maintained in the curated version of the sequence database .
for modeling purposes a subset of sequences was selected .
firstly the amino acids responsible for the interaction with sialic acid derivatives were selected .
these include k133a , g134 , v135 , t136 , a137 , t155 , k156 , p185 , p186 , d190 , s193 , l194 , d225 , q226 , a227 , g228 ( amino acids and their numbering as in 1rd8 structure , representing the earliest recovered , full length ha sequence of the spanish flu 1918 - 1920 ) .
secondly all the sequences sharing identical residues at the above mentioned positions were grouped. from each group a single sequence was selected .
in our opinion the resulting 1192 proteins are sufficient to describe the sequence variability of the has receptor - binding site .
the workflow of the data preparation is described in the supplementary figure s1 .
the ha glycoprotein is a trimer , with each monomer synthesized as a single polypeptide chain ( ha0 ) .
next ha0 is cleaved into two subunits , ha1 and ha2 .
the former contains globular region encompassing the receptor binding site and regions recognized by host immune system .
the latter is folded mainly into a helical coiled - coil structure and is responsible for both the fusion of the host and the virus membranes ( 30 ) and the attachment of ha to the virus lipid bilayer .
in our database , the ha2 subunit was removed from each analysed sequence due to its high sequence conservation .
furthermore all the sequences were aligned and the flanking amino acids not present in all sequences were discarded .
this allowed the preparation of sequences with similar length .
each of such pre - processed sequence was then used as a query for template identification .
the template with highest percentage of identity to the query sequence and highest coverage value was selected for modeling .
this procedure resulted in 43 templates .
next all entries were superimposed over one of the structures in the database ( pdb id : 4eda ) for the visualization purpose .
the obtained proteins originate from iva infecting two different classes of organisms ( aves and mammalian ) and over 250 different species .
the most represented species are pig ( sus scrofa , 485 sequences ) and human ( homo sapiens , 381 sequences ) .
avian are collectively well represented ( 324 sequences ) .
the hosts' infection occurred between 1918 and 2014 in six different continents .
moreover , seven different subtypes are present in our database .
detailed information is available in the supplementary figure s3 .
out of 286 proteins meeting the initial filters , a collection of 263 pdb structures passed the validation procedure described in methods .
just as for models the ha2 subdomain and the n - and c - terminus amino acids of ha1 were removed from pdb structures .
in contrast with the balanced host distribution found within the models , human ivas are overrepresented among the crystallographic structures ( 171 ) ( supplementary figure s4 ) .
moreover , the majority of crystallographic structures originate from asia ( 145 ) .
our database focuses mainly on the structural variability of the ha1 globular region containing the receptor binding site .
in the ha crystal structures , the spatial orientation of the globular region with respect to the long helical one can vary significantly from one protein to another .
thus the simultaneous superimposition of two complete structures might result in the incorrect alignment of their respective globular regions .
as a result the superposition was performed considering only the ha globular region .
this procedure allowed us to compare proteins in terms of structural - based properties .
the rmsd matrix of the superimposed entries was initially computed with tmalign and further used for the visualization ( as described in the ' web interface ' section ) .
as expected , the proteins having identical ha serotype ( e.g. h1 ) are generally clustered together .
however some serotype groups intersect ( e.g. h1 and h9 ) suggesting a possible evolutionary relation .
interestingly a clear distinction of the hosts cannot be achieved using only structural data .
the gnm was computed for each protein in both the model and crystal datasets .
the data generated by this coarse - grained protein dynamic model can be used to obtain information about the protein mobility at the amino acid scale .
the analysis of the crystal structures revealed a certain trend in the mobility of the amino acids involved in the substrate recognition ( supplementary figure s5 ) .
the receptor - binding site amino acids tend to be more mobile than the residues located in their proximity .
a statistically significant difference between the mobilities was observed ( two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov test equal 0.98 and p - value 4.89e - 22 ) .
this can be partially explained by the specific role of these amino acids .
upon the binding event the receptor binding site may change conformation to accommodate the ligand in contrast to neighboring residues .
despite this trend , it should be noticed that the results for specific ha could significantly vary from one to another .
this fact should be taken into account when analyzing the binding of ha and its ligand .
web interface protein distances matrices are computed using several metrics as described in the method section .
the matrices are then used by the visualization function , which represents the protein relations .
three different distance metrics can be applied to visually represent the interactions between proteins : sequence similarity score , rmsd value and esp distance .
the web interface allows an easy interaction with the data , offering two main functionalities to the user .
first the protein ' search ' window permits the text - based selection of proteins of interest .
the service allows searching entries by id , serotype , infected host , general location , continent , year of infection , strain name and structure source ( models or crystallographic structures ) .
the identified entries can also be alphabetically sorted by clicking at the name of a given column .
for instance the expression ' human europe 2009 ' will select has present in human iva which were causing infections in europe during the year 2009 ( as shown in the supplementary figure s2 ) .
moreover , by clicking at the id of a give entry , the user will be redirected to either the rcsb or to the ncbi genbank webpage .
for each entry identified with a search , the sequence , structure and electrostatic potential grid can be downloaded using the links provided in the ' download ' column .
for each pdb entry the link to the corresponding publication is provided under the ' publication ' column .
the second functionality is embedded in the ' exploration ' window consisting of three panels ( figure 1 ) .
the network representation panel provides the means to explore the protein relations .
the user may define the data source ( either crystallographic structures or homology models ) and the protein metric used to visualize the interactions .
all these properties can be selected using the appropriate fields located on the upper left of the panel .
the color scheme applied to the network 's nodes is based on the metadata information .
the user chooses a metadata category by clicking on the fields positioned on the upper right side of the panel .
a specific legend is presented , depending on the selected field .
the elastic network allows selecting and dragging any node .
upon changing the position of the node , the network dynamically re - adjusts the placement of all the other nodes .
it is possible to highlight all the nodes sharing a common property by passing the cursor over a specific marker within the legend .
furthermore , all the available metadata information is shown when passing a cursor over a node in the dynamic network .
the search bar positioned under this panel facilitates the identification of the specific network elements .
the nodes with metadata matching the inserted text are then highlighted .
the automatic intersection between this search and the already mentioned color scheme for the metadata category allows to easily visualize different layers of metadata information for the selected proteins .
the search engine behaves in the same manner as in the ' search ' window figure 1 .
the exploration window of the database web visualization .
the window includes several panels : on the left the network representation of the protein distances ( esp , rmsd , sequence similarity ) with the search field ; on the right the structure visualization ( top ) and the sequence ( bottom ) of the user - selected entries .
when a node is selected , the structure of the associated protein is visualized in the structural panel .
the user can choose between the visualization of a single structure at a time , or the superposition of multiple structures .
this feature is controlled by selecting the appropriate field from the drop down menu positioned on the top of the panel .
up to five different nodes can be selected and visualized simultaneously .
different representations ( cartoon , lines , tube etc. ) are available for the structures .
the aligned sequences of the selected structures are displayed in the sequence panel located below the structural panel .
each amino acid type has a distinctive color to improve the visibility of the differences between the analysed the proteins .
all the above mentioned functionalities were implemented using open source technologies ( d3.js and pv - webgl protein viewer ) .
the web interface was tested on the following web browsers : internet explorer 11.0.29 , mozilla firefox 45.0.1 , safari 9.1 , google chrome 49.0 .
in the ' dataset ' window a link to download the raw files constituting this database is provided .
thus , users can perform other structure - based analysis on the gathered data .
in this window , we also provide a brief description of the data and the file organization of the database .
supplementary data supplementary data are available at database online .

purpose of review .
studies have been published in the field of autoimmune thyroid diseases since january 2005 .
the review is organized into areas of etiology , autoimmune features , autoantibodies , mechanism of thyroid cell injury , b - cell responses , and t - cell responses .
also it reviews the diagnosis and the relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease , neoplasm , and kidney disorders .
recent findings .
autoimmune thyroid diseases have been reported in people living in different parts of the world including north america , europe , baalkans , asia , middle east , south america , and africa though the reported figures do not fully reflect the number of people infected per year .
cases are unrecognized due to inaccurate diagnosis and hence are treated as other diseases .
however , the most recent studies have shown that the human autoimmune thyroid diseases ( aitds ) affect up to 5 % of the general population and are seen mostly in women between 30 and 50 years. summary .
autoimmune thyroid disease is the result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors .
overall , this review has expanded our understanding of the mechanism involved in pathogenesis of aitd and the relationship between autoimmune thyroid disease , neoplasm , and kidney disease .
it has opened new lines of investigations that will ultimately result in a better clinical practice .
1. introduction the principal diseases of the human thyroid gland are goiter ( diffuse or nodular ) , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism , autoimmune thyroiditis , and neoplasm [ 1 ] .
the thyroiditis types cause inflammation of thyroid tissue and can release preformed hormone from the colloid space , causing thyrotoxicosis , which is transient and followed by recovery or development of hypothyroidism .
in acute and subacute thyroiditis , thyroid tenderness and neck pain are often present .
on the other hand , silent thyroiditis is devoid of the local symptoms [ 2 ] .
in the usa and canada , the extrapolated prevalences are 5,873,108 and 650,157 , respectively .
in austria and belgium , the prevalences are 163,495 and 206,965 , respectively .
in bosnia and macedonia , the prevalences are 8,152 and 40,801 , respectively .
for china and india , the prevalences are 25,976,952 and 21,301,412 , respectively , while in egypt and iran they are 1,522,348 and 1,350,064 , respectively .
south africa has a prevalence of 888,969 [ 3 ] .
the annual incidence of hashimoto 's thyroiditis worldwide is estimated to be 0.3 - 1.5 cases per 1000 persons , whereas graves' disease is estimated at about 5 per 10,000 people [ 4 ] .
the human aitds broadly include graves' disease ( gd ) and hashimoto 's thyroiditis ( ht ) which are the most common causes of thyroid gland dysfunctions and nonendemic goiter [ 4 ] .
these conditions arise due to complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors [ 5 ] and are characterized by reactivity to self - thyroid antigens which are expressed as distinctive inflammatory or antireceptor autoimmune diseases [ 6 , 7 ] .
among the major aitd susceptibility genes that have been identified and characterized is the hla - dr gene locus , as well as non - mhc genes including the ctla - 4 , cd40 , ptpn22 , thyroglobulin , and tsh receptor genes [ 8 ] .
the major environmental triggers of aitd include iodine , medications , infection , smoking , stress , and genetic predisposition to aitd which lead to novel putative mechanisms by which the genetic - environmental interactions may lead to the development of thyroid autoimmunity [ 9 ] .
the first pathological features of autoimmune thyroiditis were described in 1912 [ 10 ] when patients with goiter exhibited diffuse lymphocyte infiltration , atrophy of follicular cells , presence of granulated thyrocytes ( oncocytic cells or hurtle 's cells ) , and fibrosis in the histological pictures of their thyroid tissues [ 10 ] .
the hashimoto 's thyroiditis disorder is directed against thyroid antigens and is the most common cause of hypothyroidism [ 11 ] .
the incidence is 0.3 to 1.5 per 1000 persons per year , and it is 4 to 10 times more common in women than in men [ 8 , 11 , 12 ] .
hashimoto 's thyroiditis is more prevalent in areas with a high dietary iodinized salt intake , and smoking increases the risk [ 8 ] .
goiter can be seen on presentation , but thyroid atrophy is more common .
hashimoto 's thyroiditis is associated with other endocrine diseases in polyglandular autoimmune failure syndrome ( addison 's disease , type 1 diabetes mellitus , and hypogonadism ) [ 8 ] .
the diagnosis is made by clinical features , elevated tsh , low thyroid hormone , and the presence of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies ( anti - tpo ) [ 13 ] .
graves' disease , on the other hand , involves the binding of autoantibodies to tsh receptor which leads to stimulation .
it is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis [ 14 ] .
receptor activation stimulates thyrocyte growth and function [ 15 ] .
the disease is more common in whites and asians , and the incidence is lower in african americans , and female - to - male ratio is 3.5 : 1 [ 16 ] .
it is more common in patients with a family history of thyroid disease , especially graves' disease .
graves' disease features include swelling over the anterior shin ( pretibial myxedema ) , thyroid eye disease ( prominence of eyes , lid lag , globe lag , exophthalmos , lid edema , chemosis , and extraocular muscle weakness ) , and increased pigmentation and vitiligo .
thyroid ophthalmopathy is present in about 50 % of graves' patients .
smoking is a risk factor , and therapeutic options include local measures to combat inflammation - - glucocorticoids , plasmapheresis , and immune suppressants as well as orbital radiation , decompressive surgery , and thyroid ablation [ 2 ] .
2. etiology the etiology of aitd is multifactorial .
susceptibility to the disease is determined by a combination of immune mechanism , genetics , and environmental ( iodine , infection , and stress ) and constitutional factors .
3. immune mechanisms a variety of immune mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of graves' hyperthyroidism .
the major mechanisms for which there is some evidence are molecular mimicry ( specificity crossover ) , thyroid - cell expression of hla ( human leukocyte - associated ) molecules ( antigens ) , and bystander activation [ 17 ] .
4. molecular mimicry molecular mimicry implies structural similarity between some infectious or other exogenous agent and human proteins , such that antibodies and t cells activated in response to the exogenous agent react with the human protein , in this instance one or more thyroid proteins .
as an example , in an analysis of 600 monoclonal antibodies raised against a large variety of viruses , 4 percent of the monoclonal antibodies cross - reacted with uninfected tissues [ 18 ] .
5. thyroid cell abnormal expression of hla ii molecules thyroid epithelial cells from patients with autoimmune thyroid disease ( including graves' disease ) but not normal subjects express mhc class ii molecules , notably hla - dr molecules [ 19 ] .
this expression could be the direct result of viral or other infections of thyroid epithelial cells , or it may be induced by cytokines such as interferon - gamma produced by t cells that have been attracted to the gland either by an infection or directly because of the presence of thyroid antigens [ 20 ] .
class ii molecule expression provides a mechanism for presentation of thyroid antigens to and activation of autoreactive t cells , with the potential for persistence of thyroid disease [ 20 ] .
several experimental observations provide support for this hypothesis : induction of class ii molecules on thyroid epithelial cells by interferon - gamma can induce autoimmune thyroiditis in susceptible mice [ 21 ] ; viruses can directly induce class ii molecule expression on thyroid cells , independent of cytokine secretion [ 20 , 22 ] ; thyroid epithelial cells expressing class ii molecules can present viral peptide antigens to cloned t - cells [ 23 ] ; thyroid antigen - specific t cell clones in normal rats react specifically with cloned autologous thyroid cells in the absence of more conventional antigen - presenting cells [ 24 ] ; and an animal model of graves' disease induced by cells expressing the tshr is only effective when the cells also express mhc class ii antigens [ 25 , 26 ] .
these findings strongly support the view that an insult , such as infection , may induce class ii molecule expression on human thyroid cells and that these cells then may act as antigen - presenting cells to initiate an autoimmune response [ 20 ] .
the expression of a t - cell costimulator molecule , cd40 , on thyroid epithelial cells indicates that costimulatory molecules are available for this action .
in addition , intrathyroidal dendritic cells and b cells may also serve as potent antigen - presenting cells [ 27 , 28 ] .
the description of hyperthyroidism in mice immunized with fibroblasts coexpressing class ii molecules and human tsh receptors provides further evidence that cells need not be " professional " antigen - presenting cells to present antigen so long as they can acquire the ability to express class ii molecules [ 29 ] .
6. bystander activation in order for hla class ii antigen expression and presentation of antigens to be realized , there must be a local insult to initiate the responses .
as mentioned above , this may take the form of a direct insult to the thyroid by a viral infection of the thyroid cells or of immune cells .
even the arrival of activated t cells within the thyroid gland may perhaps initiate such a series of events in a susceptible subject with the appropriate immune repertoire [ 30 ] .
evidence shows that such bystander activation of local t cells , which may not be thyroid specific , may exert via cytokines a marked activation effect on resident thyroid - specific t cells .
evidence for such bystander effects has been obtained in an animal model of viral - induced autoimmune insulitis and in experimental autoimmune thyroiditis [ 31 ] .
7. precipitating and predisposing factors for graves' disease several factors that predispose to or initiate graves' hyperthyroidism have been proposed and include genetic susceptibility , infection , stress , sex steroids , smoking , pregnancy , and drugs as reviewed in the sections that follows [ 32 ] .
8. genetic susceptibility there is abundant epidemiologic evidence for genetic susceptibility to graves' hyperthyroidism and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis [ 14 , 33 ] .
the diseases cluster in families and are more common in women .
the concordance rate in monozygotic twins is 20 to 40 percent [ 34 ] .
the sibling recurrence rate for graves' disease exceeds 10.0 [ 35 ] .
there is an association between autoimmune thyroid disease and certain alleles of ctla - 4 ( cytotoxic t lymphocyte - antigen / associated protein 4 ) .
as an example , in one study of 379 patients with graves' hyperthyroidism in the united kingdom , 42 percent had a particular allele ( g allele ) of the ctla - 4 gene , as compared with 32 percent of 363 normal subjects [ 36 ] .
there is an association with certain alleles of hla on chromosome 6 .
as an example , a study of caucasian patients in north america found that hla - drb1 * 08 and drb3 * 0202 were associated with the disease and that drb1 * 07 was protective [ 5 , 37 , 38 ] .
9. infection if infection was the cause of graves' hyperthyroidism , an identifiable agent should be present in the majority of patients and it should be possible to induce the disease by transferring the agent .
possible infections of the thyroid gland itself ( subacute thyroiditis and congenital rubella ) have been associated with thyroid autoimmune disease and could initiate class ii molecule expression [ 39 ] .
hepatitis c infection is a well - recognized precipitator of autoimmune thyroid disease when treated with interferon therapy .
there is , however , no evidence that these or any other infections or exposures lead directly to autoimmune thyroid disease [ 39 - 41 ] .
10. stress as compared with normal subjects or patients with toxic nodular goiter , patients with graves' hyperthyroidism more often give a history of some type of psychologic stress in particular negative life events such as loss of a spouse before the onset of their hyperthyroidism [ 42 - 44 ] .
in general , stress appears to induce a state of immune suppression , possibly mediated by the actions of cortisol on immune cells .
suppression of stress may be followed by rebound immunologic hyperactivity .
such a response could precipitate autoimmune thyroid disease in genetically susceptible subjects [ 42 - 44 ] .
11. sex steroids more women develop graves' hyperthyroidism than men , with a ratio of approximately 7 : 1 ; an effect that is often said to be mediated in some way by more estrogen or less testosterone [ 45 ] .
there is a large body of evidence that moderate amounts of estrogen enhance immunologic reactivity to self - antigens [ 46 , 47 ] .
however , it is just as likely that the x chromosome is the source of the enhanced susceptibility rather than sex steroids since the susceptibility continues after the menopause .
for example , x - chromosome inactivation has been associated with autoimmune thyroid disease [ 45 ] .
12. smoking smoking is a risk factor for graves' hyperthyroidism ( relative risk approximately 2.0 ) and an even stronger risk factor for graves' ophthalmopathy [ 48 - 50 ] .
13. pregnancy graves' disease is uncommon during pregnancy because hyperthyroidism is associated with reduced fertility and increased pregnancy loss .
in addition , pregnancy is a time of immune suppression so that the disease tends to improve as pregnancy progresses .
during pregnancy , both t - cell and b - cell functions are diminished , and the rebound from this immunosuppression may contribute to the development of postpartum thyroid disease [ 51 ] .
it has also been suggested that fetal microchimerism ( the presence of fetal cells in maternal tissue ) might play a role in the development of postpartum autoimmune thyroid disease [ 52 ] .
up to 30 percent of young women give a history of pregnancy in the 12 months before the onset of graves' disease , indicating that postpartum graves' disease is a surprisingly common presentation and that pregnancy is a major risk factor in susceptible women [ 53 ] .
14. drugs iodine and iodine - containing drugs such as amiodarone may precipitate graves' disease , or a recurrence of graves' disease , in a susceptible individual [ 48 , 54 ] .
iodine is most likely to precipitate thyrotoxicosis in an iodine deficient population simply by allowing the tshr - ab to be effective in stimulating the production of thyroid hormone. whether there is any other precipitating event is unclear .
iodine and amiodarone may also damage thyroid cells directly and release thyroid antigens to the immune system [ 55 ] .
15. predisposing and precipitating factors for hashimoto 's thyroiditis infection , stress , sex steroids , pregnancy , iodine intake , and radiation exposure are the known possible precipitating factors for hashimoto 's thyroiditis [ 56 ] .
fetal microchimerism within the maternal thyroid is also a possibility [ 52 , 56 - 59 ] .
16. genetic susceptibility there is genetic susceptibility to hashimoto 's thyroiditis , and much has been learned in recent years concerning the susceptibility genes for this disorder in particular and for autoimmune thyroid disease in general [ 60 ] .
evidence for genetic susceptibility to hashimoto 's thyroiditis includes the following observations .
the disease clusters in families , sometimes alone and sometimes in combination with graves' disease [ 61 ] .
the sibling recurrence risk is > 20 [ 35 ] .
the concordance rate in monozygotic twins is 30 to 60 percent despite random combinations of t - cell receptor and antibody v genes at the time of recombination [ 62 ] .
there is an association , albeit relatively weak , with certain hla alleles such as dr3 .
there is linkage to certain alleles of the gene for ctla - 4 .
the thyroglobulin gene has been linked to autoimmune thyroid disease and has been suggested to code for tg forms with different immune reactivity [ 15 ] .
17. infection no infection is known to cause or even be closely associated with hashimoto 's thyroiditis in humans [ 63 ] , although thyroiditis can be induced in experimental animals by certain viral infections [ 57 ] .
patients with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis ( presumed to be a viral infection ) and congenital rubella may have thyroid antibodies for a few months after their illnesses , and the infections could initiate expression of mhc class ii molecules in the thyroid gland .
however , neither disorder is known to be commonly followed by chronic thyroiditis although evidence of thyroid autoimmunity may persist [ 64 ] .
18. stress stress of various types has been linked to hashimoto 's thyroiditis .
the proposed mechanisms include induction of immune suppression by nonantigen - specific mechanisms , perhaps due to the effects of cortisol or corticotropin - releasing hormone on immune cells , followed by immune hyperactivity leading to autoimmune thyroid disease [ 58 ] .
19. sex steroids and pregnancy more women than men have hashimoto 's thyroiditis , suggesting a role for sex steroids .
however , older women may be more likely to have hashimoto 's thyroiditis than younger women , suggesting that the presence or absence of estrogen may not be the important factor [ 65 ] .
another possible explanation for female predominance is skewed x - chromosome inactivation , which was found in 34 percent of female twins with autoimmune thyroid disease and only 11 percent of controls [ 45 , 66 ] .
it is possible that the self - antigens on the inactivated x - chromosome might not be expressed sufficiently to allow tolerance .
during pregnancy , there is a marked increase in cd4 + cd25 + regulatory t cells which lead to diminished functions of both t cells and b cells , and the rebound from this immunosuppression is thought to contribute to the development of postpartum thyroiditis [ 65 ] .
pregnancy - associated immune suppression is associated with a shift to th2 t cells and a shift in cytokine profiles [ 65 ] .
a variety of local factors at the immune cell - trophoblast interface are also known to be important modulators of immune function in pregnancy .
the trophoblast cells located in the placenta , and subject to maternal immune surveillance serve as physical barriers between mother and fetus and have been shown to express several immune modulating molecules , such as hla - g , fasl , and indoleamine 2,3 - dioxygenase as well as secreting a variety of cytokines [ 67 ] .
hla - g is one of the members of the mhc class i family and is known to inhibit natural killer cell function and dendritic cell maturation .
fas ligand interacts with fas antigen and induces apoptotic cell death of fetal antigen - reactive maternal lymphocytes .
indoleamine 2,3 - dioxygenase , which catalyzes tryptophane in lymphocytes , has proven to be critical in the maintenance of allogeneic pregnancy in mouse [ 68 ] .
other than these local modulators , progesterone produced by the placenta affects cytokine profiles across the whole maternal immune system .
approximately 20 percent of patients with postpartum thyroiditis go on to develop classical hashimoto 's disease in later years [ 69 ] .
20. iodine intake mild iodine deficiency is associated with lower prevalences of hashimoto 's disease and hypothyroidism , while excessive intake is associated with a higher prevalence [ 70 ] .
as an example , in china , autoimmune thyroiditis was found in 0.3 percent of those with mildly deficient iodine intake and 1.3 percent of those with excessive iodine intake [ 56 ] .
21. radiation exposure following the tragic chernobyl nuclear accident , the exposed children developed a high frequency of thyroid autoantibodies [ 71 ] .
all the evidence suggests that the presence of thyroid antibodies increases the risk of developing thyroid dysfunction [ 4 , 72 ]. whether background radiation to which we are all exposed has any role in susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease is unknown .
in a population - based study of 4299 subjects , 160 had an occupational exposure to ionizing radiation , nearly 60 percent of the subjects worked in a nuclear power plant , while the rest were either medical or laboratory workers .
ten percent of the female subjects with radiation exposure met criteria for autoimmune thyroid disease ( anti - tpo antibodies greater than 200 iu / ml and hypoechogenicity on ultrasound ) compared to 3.4 percent of those without an exposure .
subjects with greater than five years of exposure to ionizing radiation were particularly at high risk [ 73 ] .
22. fetal microchimerism fetal cells have been identified within maternal thyroid glands in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease .
such cells may initiate graft versus host reactions with the thyroid gland and play a significant role in the development of hashimoto 's thyroiditis .
to date , however , this remains hypothetical .
23. autoimmune features all forms of thyroid autoimmunity are associated with a lymphocytic infiltrate in the thyroid .
these lymphocytes are largely responsible for generating both t - and b - cell - mediated autoreactivity .
other sites such as thyroid draining lymph nodes and bone marrow may also contain thyroid autoreactive lymphocytes in aitd .
the initial autoimmune response by cd4 + t cells appears to upregulate the secretion of interferon - gamma resulting in enhancing the expression of mhc ii molecules on thyrocytes .
this most likely triggers expansion of autoreactive t cells and gives rise to the characteristic inflammatory response , and as the disease progresses , thyrocytes are targeted for apoptosis resulting in hypothyroidism .
another contributing factor to the observed hypothyroidism in hashimoto 's thyroiditis patients could be the circulating tsh inhibitory antibodies .
graves' disease on the other hand represents the other end of spectrum wherein the patients suffer from hyperthyroidism .
the activation of thyroid specific cd4 + t cells leads to the recruitment of autoreactive b cells and the mounting of thyroid stimulatory immune response via antithyroid antibodies [ 74 ] .
24. autoantibodies 24.1 .
thyroid peroxidase ( tpo ) antibodies thyroid peroxidase ( tpo ) antibodies are the key thyroid enzyme catalyzing both the iodination and coupling reaction for the synthesis of thyroid hormone .
it is membrane bound and found in the cytoplasm and in high concentration on the apical microvillar surface of thyrocytes .
it is of mol wt between 100 to 105 - kda and previously was known as thyroid microsomal antigen [ 75 ] .
multiple t - and b - cell epitopes exist within the molecule , and the antibody response to tpo is restricted at the level of the germ line heavy and light chain variable ( v ) region [ 76 ] .
anti - tpo autoantibodies are found in over 90 % of patients with autoimmune hypothyroidism and graves' disease .
together with thyroglobulin ( tg ) antibodies , these are the predominant antibodies in autoimmune hypothyroidism ( ah ) .
anti - tpo antibodies are mainly of the igg class 1 and igg4 subclasses in excess [ 77 - 79 ] .
24.2 .
thyroglobulin ( tg ) antibodies thyroglobin ( tg ) is a 660 - kda glycoprotein composed of two identical subunits of 330 kda each .
it is secreted by the thyroid follicular cells into the follicular lumen and stored as a colloid substance within the thyroid follicles .
each tg molecule has around 100 tyrosine residues , a quarter of which are iodinated .
these residues couple to for triiodothyronine ( t3 ) and thyroxine ( t4 ) .
the sequence of human tg has been determined [ 80 ] .
when tsh stimulates the thyroid cell , tg is endocytosed and hydrolyzed in lysosome releasing t3 and t4 .
the exact location of t - and b - cell epitopes within tg is uncertain [ 81 ] .
thyroglobulin autoantibodies are found in less than 60 % of patients with lymphocytic thyroiditis and 30 % of graves' disease patients .
they are polyclonal and mainly of igg class with all four subclasses represented .
tsh regulates the cell surface expressions of tpo and tg altering the transcription of these two proteins , possibly at the gene promoter level .
these effects are mimicked by autoantibodies ( both blocking and stimulating ) in sera of patients with graves' disease [ 82 ] .
24.3 .
thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( tsh - r ) antibodies thyroid stimulating hormone receptor ( tsh - r ) is the prime autoantigen in graves' disease and atrophic thyroiditis .
it is located on the basal surface of thyroid follicular cells [ 83 ] .
in graves' disease , thyroid stimulating antibodies ( tsabs ) bind to the receptor and stimulate the thyroid cell to produce excessive amount of thyroid hormones resulting in hyperthyroidism .
in patients with atrophic thyroiditis , the major antibody is the tsh to its receptor , thus preventing stimulation of thyroid cell .
this results in diminished thyroid hormone output , atrophy of thyroid gland , and the clinical state of hypothyroidism [ 83 , 84 ] .
24.4 .
mechanism of thyroid cell injury several antibody and cell - mediated mechanisms contribute to thyroid injury in autoimmune thyroid disease .
in general , in cases of hashimoto 's thyroiditis , the expressions of death receptor cd95 and death receptor ligands cd95l in the thyroid tissue appear to be much higher compared to their normal counterparts .
also the expression of positive effectors of apoptosis and caspases 3 and 8 as well as bax and bak appear to be relatively high in thyroiditis samples as compared to controls .
this expression pattern supports enhanced apoptosis as the mechanism underlying the loss of thyrocytes in hashimoto 's thyroiditis .
in graves' disease , there is highly elevated expression of negative modulators of apoptosis ( cflip , bcl - 2 , and bcl - xl ) .
this supports the role for apoptosis inhibitory mechanism .
although in both cases there is significant expression of fas / cd95 and its ligand , only in hashimoto 's thyroiditis , the thyrocytes undergo apoptosis .
the role of cytokines in the development of autoimmune disorders has also been explained [ 85 ] .
in case of hashimoto 's thyroiditis , a th1 disease , the cytokine interferon - gamma appears to play a crucial role in the pathology of the disease by enhancing the expression of caspases and thereby sensitizing cells to fas - mediated apoptosis .
in contrast , in the th2 - mediated graves' disease , the cytokines il4 and il - 10 regulate the expressions of two anti - apoptotic proteins bcl - xl and cflip , which offers resistance to fas - mediated apoptosis .
this proves the necessary modulatory roles played by the th1 and th2 cytokines in the development of autoimmune disorders [ 74 ] .
24.5 .
b cell responses thyroglobin ( tg ) and tpo antibodies occur in very high concentration in patients with hashimoto 's thyroiditis and primary myxedema .
these antibodies are less common but still frequent in graves' disease , whereas tpo rather than tg antibodies are frequent in postpartum thyroiditis [ 86 ] .
both of the antibodies show partial restriction to the igg4 subclass [ 76 ] .
tg antibodies usually mediate antibody - mediated cytotoxicity ( adcc ) , whereas tpo antibodies form terminal complement complexes within the thyroid gland .
cell - mediated injury may be necessary for tpo antibodies to gain access to their antigen and become pathogenic [ 87 ] .
24.6 .
t - cell responses both cd4 + and cd8 + t cells occur in thyroid lymphocytic infiltrate with a preponderance of cd4 + cells .
there is an increase in activated t - cell expressing markers like hla - dr. cytokines including il - 2 , interferon - gamma , tumor necrosis factor , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 2 , il - 10 , il - 12 , il - 13 , and il - 15 are produced by the lymphocytes with some variation between patients [ 88 ] .
thyroid cells express mhc class ii and behave as antigen presenting cells ( apc ) .
expressions of icam - 1 , lfa - 3 , and mhc class i by thyrocytes are enhanced by il 1 , tumor necrotic factor , and interferon - gamma [ 89 ] .
this response increases the ability of cytotoxic t cell to mediate lysis .
humoral immunity exacerbates cell - mediated damage both by direct complement fixation ( tpo antibodies ) and by adcc [ 13 ] .
complement attack initiated via the classic or alternative pathway impairs the metabolic function of thyroid cells and induces them to secrete il - 1 , il - 6 , reactive oxygen metabolites , and prostaglandins .
all of these enhance the autoimmune process [ 90 ] .
24.7 .
diagnosis of autoimmune thyroid disease diagnosis of aitd is based upon clinical features and supported laboratory investigations .
the patient may be euthyroid , hypothyroid , or hyperthyroid depending on the type of disease and the stage of the disease .
aitd is detected by measuring circulating antibodies against tpo and tg. a negative test for both antibodies excludes aitd , as 98 % of patients are positive for either antibody .
tpo ab is more specific and sensitive than tg ab in the diagnosis of autoimmune hypothyroidism .
elevated tsh with tpo antibodies is the gold standard for diagnosis of chronic hashimoto 's thyroiditis .
tsh abs that stimulates the tsh - r in grave 's disease is measured to predict neonatal thyrotoxicosis .
they can be measured by thyroid receptor assays or bioassays .
24.8 .
autoimmune thyroid disease and neoplasms thyroiditis and thyroid antibodies are found in a quarter to a third of the patients with thyroid cancer [ 91 ] .
pre - existing hashimoto 's thyroiditis is the major risk factor for development of non - hodgkin 's lymphoma of thyroid [ 92 ] .
studies have also shown that there is an increased frequency of autoimmune thyroiditis in women with breast cancer [ 93 ] .
24.9 .
autoimmune thyroid disease and kidney disorder endocrine abnormalities have been reported in patients with kidney diseases [ 94 ] .
thyroid dysfunction causes remarkable changes in glomerular and tubular functions , and in electrolyte and water homeostasis [ 95 ]. from a clinical practice viewpoint , it should be mentioned that both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are accompanied by remarkable alterations in the metabolism of water and electrolyte , as well as in cardiovascular function [ 96 ] .
25. conclusion autoimmune thyroid disease occurs as a result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors .
the disease occurs due to autoreactive lymphocytes escaping tolerance .
both cell - mediated and humoral responses contribute to tissue injury in autoimmune thyroid disease .
diagnosis of aitd is based upon clinical features and supported laboratory investigations .
aitd has been associated with neoplasm and kidney disorders .

addictive drugs , such as opioids , ethanol , cocaine , amphetamine , and phencyclidine ( pcp ) , affect many functions of the nervous system and peripheral organs , resulting in severe health problems .
g protein - activated inwardly rectifying k + ( girk , kir3 ) channels play an important role in regulating neuronal excitability through activation of various gi / o protein - coupled receptors including opioid and cb1 cannabinoid receptors .
furthermore , the channels are directly activated by ethanol and inhibited by cocaine at toxic levels , but not affected by methylphenidate , methamphetamine , and 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( mdma ) at toxic levels .
the primary pharmacological action of pcp is blockade of n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor channels that are associated with its psychotomimetic effects .
pcp also interacts with several receptors and channels at relatively high concentrations .
however , the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of pcp remain to be clarified .
here , we investigated the effects of pcp on girk channels using the xenopus oocyte expression system .
pcp weakly but significantly inhibited girk channels at micromolar concentrations , but not kir1.1 and kir2.1 channels .
the pcp concentrations effective in inhibiting girk channels overlap clinically relevant brain concentrations in severe intoxication .
the results suggest that partial inhibition of girk channels by pcp may contribute to some of the toxic effects after overdose .

introduction g protein - activated inwardly rectifying k + ( girk ) channels ( also known as kir3 channels ) are members of a family of inwardly rectifying k + ( kir ) channels that includes seven subfamilies [ 1 ] .
four girk channel subunits have been identified in mammals [ 1 ] .
neuronal girk channels are predominantly heteromultimers composed of girk1 and girk2 subunits in most brain regions or homomultimers composed of girk2 subunits in the substantia nigra , whereas atrial girk channels are heteromultimers composed of girk1 and girk4 subunits [ 2 ] .
girk channels play an important role in the inhibitory regulation of neuronal excitability in most brain regions and heart rate through activation of various gi / o protein - coupled receptors , such as opioid , cb1 cannabinoid , and d2 dopamine receptors [ 2 ] .
furthermore , the channels are modulated by various psychoactive agents , such as ethanol , antipsychotics , antidepressants , anesthetics , and hormones [ 2 - 11 ] .
recently , we demonstrated that cocaine at toxic levels inhibited girk channels expressed in xenopus oocytes .
in contrast , methylphenidate , methamphetamine , and 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( mdma ) at toxic levels had little effect on girk channels , although these drugs at higher concentrations inhibited the channels to a lesser extent than cocaine [ 12 ] .
phencyclidine ( pcp ) has been used as a drug of abuse , although it was originally developed as a general anesthetic in the 1950s [ 13 , 14 ] .
the primary pharmacological action of pcp is blockade of n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor channels that are associated with its psychotomimetic effects [ 13 , 14 ] .
pcp at relatively high concentrations interacts with several receptors and channels , namely , sigma , micro - opioid , nicotinic - and muscarinic - acetylcholine receptors , voltage - gated k + , na + and ca2 + channels , and adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) - sensitive k + channels [ 14 , 15 , 16 ] .
however , the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of pcp have not yet been sufficiently clarified .
in the present study , we investigated the effects of pcp on girk channels and other kir channels using the xenopus oocyte expression system .
methods for xenopus oocyte experiments [ 4 , 5 ] , xenopus laevis oocytes were injected with mrna for girk1 / girk2 or girk1 / girk4 combinations , girk2 , kir1.1 , or kir2.1 .
the oocytes were incubated at 19degreesc in barth 's solution and defolliculated after collagenase treatment .
whole - cell currents of the oocytes were recorded with a conventional two - electrode voltage clamp .
oocytes were superfused with a high - potassium solution containing 96 mm k + .
the membrane potential was held at - 70 mv. the values obtained are expressed as mean +/ - sem , with n indicating the number of oocytes tested .

results in xenopus oocytes injected with girk1 and girk2 mrna , pcp reversibly reduced basal girk inward currents ( fig. ( 1a )) .
similar results were observed in oocytes injected with either girk1 and girk4 mrna or girk2 mrna .
however , in oocytes expressing either kir1.1 or kir2.1 channels , pcp caused no significant response even at 100 microm ( less than 5 na , n = 4 , fig. ( 1a )) .
additionally , in uninjected oocytes , 100 microm pcp and 3 mm ba2 + , a kir channel blocker , caused no significant response ( fig. ( 1a )) .
the results suggest that pcp inhibits girk channels .
the inhibition by pcp was concentration - dependent ( n = 4 , fig. ( 1b )) .
discussion we demonstrated that pcp at micromolar concentrations inhibited brain - type girk1 / 2 and girk2 channels and atrial - type girk1 / 4 channels expressed in xenopus oocytes .
at 100 im or less , the inhibitory effects of pcp were more potent than those of cocaine , methylphenidate , methamphetamine , and mdma ( fig. ( 2 )) .
in other kir channel subfamilies , kir1.1 and kir2.1 channels were insensitive to these psychostimulants [ 12 ] and pcp , whereas pcp inhibited cardiac atp - sensitive k + channels , which comprise four pore - forming kir6 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor subunits , with an ic50 value of approximately 20 microm [ 16 ] .
further studies using girk / kir1.1 and girk / kir2.1 chimeric channels and mutant girk channels may clarify the critical sites mediating the effects of pcp on girk channels .
the use of pcp as a drug of abuse is an important medical problem .
serum pcp concentrations after overdose were reported to reach up to approximately 10 microm in some postmortem cases , up to 45 microm in one massive overdose case [ 17 ] , and up to approximately 3.3 microm in some nonfatal cases [ 18 ] , although serum concentrations in most intoxication cases ranged widely from nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations [ 17 , 18 ] .
furthermore , the concentrations in the brain were reported to be from 3 to 14 - fold higher than those in serum [ 19 ] .
additionally , because the early phase elimination rate after administration of pcp is relatively high [ 19 ] , the peak concentrations would be higher than the concentrations measured .
therefore , the pcp concentrations effective in inhibiting girk channels overlap the clinically relevant brain concentrations in severe intoxication or fatal cases .
pcp concentrations in severe intoxication cases are associated with coma , seizures , muscle rigidity , and respiratory arrest [ 20 ] .
girk2 knockout mice show spontaneous seizures and are more susceptible to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol than wild type mice [ 21 ] .
furthermore , girk inhibitors can depolarize the membrane potential and induce action potentials [ 22 ] .
because girk channels play an important role in regulating cell excitability , even partial inhibition of neuronal girk channels by pcp might contribute to the incidence of seizures and some of neuropsychiatric complications observed in severe or fatal cases after overdose .
girk channels may be considered as important molecules mediating the effects of pcp , cocaine , opioids , cannabinoids , and ethanol among addictive drugs .

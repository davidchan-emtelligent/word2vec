background in diagnosing celiac disease ( cd ) , serological tests are highly valuable .
however , their role in following up children with cd after prescription of a gluten - free diet is unclear .
this study aimed to compare the performance of antibody tests in predicting small - intestinal mucosal status in diagnosis vs. follow - up of pediatric cd. methods we conducted a prospective cohort study at a tertiary - care center .
148 children underwent esophohagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies either for symptoms +/ - positive cd antibodies ( group a ; n = 95 ) or following up cd diagnosed >= 1 year before study enrollment ( group b ; n = 53 ) .
using biopsy ( marsh >= 2 ) as the criterion standard , areas under roc curves ( aucs ) and likelihood - ratios were calculated to estimate the performance of antibody tests against tissue transglutaminase ( tg2 ) , deamidated gliadin peptide ( dgp ) and endomysium ( ema ) .
results aucs were higher when tests were used for cd diagnosis vs. follow - up : 1 vs. 0.86 ( p = 0.100 ) for tg2 - iga , 0.85 vs. 0.74 ( p = 0.421 ) for tg2 - igg , 0.97 vs. 0.61 ( p = 0.004 ) for dpg - iga , and 0.99 vs. 0.88 ( p = 0.053 ) for dpg - igg , respectively .
empirical power was 85 % for the dpg - iga comparison , and on average 33 % ( range 13 - 43 ) for the non - significant comparisons .
among group b children , 88.7 % showed mucosal healing ( median 2.2 years after primary diagnosis ) .
only the negative likelihood - ratio of ema was low enough ( 0.097 ) to effectively rule out persistent mucosal injury .
however , out of 12 ema - positive children with mucosal healing , 9 subsequently turned ema - negative .
conclusions among the cd antibodies examined , negative ema most reliably predict mucosal healing .
in general , however , antibody tests , especially dpg - iga , are of limited value in predicting the mucosal status in the early years post - diagnosis but may be sufficient after a longer period of time .
pediatrics celiac disease follow - up endomysial antibodies sensitivity specificity background celiac disease ( cd ) is a multi - systemic autoimmune disease triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals .
cd creates small - intestinal mucosal injury of different severity [ 1 ] .
an effective treatment allowing mucosal healing is the gluten - free diet ( gfd ) .
the goals of treatment are not only symptomatic improvement but also avoiding complications , which could arise even in patients having become asymptomatic on a gfd [ 2,3 ] .
furthermore , achieving mucosal healing might be crucial because of an increased risk of lymphoproliferative malignancy among patients with persistent villous atrophy [ 4 ] .
international cd guidelines propose regular follow - up of cd patients [ 5 - 7 ] .
among the follow - up modalities , re - biopsy may be undertaken to prove mucosal healing , which children achieve more often than adults [ 8 ] .
however , its invasiveness , discomfort and possible complications limit the use of re - biopsy in routine follow - up [ 5,6 ] .
therefore , reliable non - invasive surrogate markers of mucosal healing are highly desirable .
whereas antibody tests are of irreplaceable value in diagnosing untreated cd [ 6 ] , controversy exists over whether these tests can reliably indicate mucosal healing [ 8 - 11 ] .
concerning the correlation between follow - up histology and non - invasive biomarkers , children with cd are an understudied population .
specifically , there is a lack of prospective pediatric studies evaluating current biomarkers used in clinical practice for monitoring purposes .
the purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the performance of up - to - date antibody tests in predicting mucosal status in children with untreated cd vs. in children after prescription of a gfd .
methods study design and subjects between july 1 , 2009 , and december 31 , 2010 , a prospective , cross - sectional cohort study was performed at st. anna children 's hospital .
following written informed parental consent , all consecutively enrolled children ( n = 148 ) underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies ( egd ) .
the participating children were divided into groups according to whether egd was performed for diagnostic or follow - up purposes ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 recruitment flow chart .
group a comprised 95 children on a gluten - containing diet , 32 of them became diagnosed with cd ( group a1 ) and 63 were referred to egd due to non - celiac dyspepsia ( group a2 ) .
the predominant complaints in group a1 children were abdominal pain ( 31.3 %) , failure to thrive or short stature ( 18.8 %) , chronic diarrhea ( 6.3 %) , flatulence ( 6.3 %) , recurrent headache ( 6.3 %) and constipation ( 3.1 %) .
a first - degree relative with cd ( 18.8 %) , iga - deficiency ( 3.1 %) , autoimmune thyroiditis ( 3.1 %) , and iron deficiency anemia ( 3.1 %) were the remaining reasons for cd screening in group a1 .
diagnosis of cd was based on positive iga antibodies against endomysium ( ema ) in iga - competent children or igg - antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides ( dgp - igg ) in children with iga - deficiency along with biopsy results consistent with cd ( marsh >= 2 ) and positivity of hla - dq2 and / or hla - dq8 .
cd was ruled out by negative biopsy results .
group b comprised 53 children with cd after prescription of a gfd >= 1 year before study enrollment ( median 2.2 , range 1 to 12.9 ) .
cd had been proven by positive ema or iga antibodies against tissue transglutaminase ( tg2 - iga ) , biopsy evidence and positivity of hla - dq2 and / or hla - dq8 .
group b children had received regular follow - up according to the recommendations then in force [ 7 ] .
within the 18 - month study period , a total of 79 children presented for routine cd follow - up. all of these children were invited to participate in the study independent of the presence of symptoms or their adherence to the gfd according to dietary interview .
as such they were unselected and only chosen by their willingness to undergo follow - up endoscopy .
in this context , 26 of 79 eligible children opted out of the study .
the predominant complaints in group b were abdominal pain ( 15.1 %) , constipation ( 1.9 %) and aphthous stomatitis ( 1.9 %) .
within group b , 79.2 % of children were symptom - free .
endoscopy , biopsies and histology all egds were performed in anesthesiologist - controlled deep sedation with propofol .
four biopsies were taken from the second part and two from the bulb of the duodenum .
biopsies were staged by two experienced pathologists ( ga and ac ) who were blinded to subject identity and indication for biopsy .
intestinal histological findings were classified according to a modified marsh classification [ 1 ] using >= 30 lymphocytes / 100 epithelial cells as cut - off for pathological intraepithelial lymphocytosis [ 12 ] .
in cases of initial disagreement , a consensus diagnosis was reached using a multihead microscope .
mucosal healing in group a was defined as marsh < 2 .
cd serology blood for serology was taken in the week before egd .
in all children , total iga levels were determined .
iga - deficiency was defined as serum iga < 0.07 g / l [ 13 ] .
all iga - based tests were evaluated only after exclusion of iga - deficient children .
four commercial enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays were used for detection of tg2 - iga , tg2 - igg , dpg - igg , and dpg - iga ( table 1 ) .
sera were also tested for ema by indirect immunofluorescence using monkey esophagus ( table 1 ) , at the initial dilution of 1:5 and , when positive , titrated up to the end point .
a single experienced technician assessed all slides .
cd serology kits from different companies were used because eurospital tg2 - iga and orgentec ema had been our routine test kits since 2005 onwards and on request werfen austria , diagnostic divisions , was willing to complete the armamentarium of current cd antibodies by providing inova antibody kits free of charge during the study .

statistics data of continuous and categorical variables were reported using median and interquartile range ( iqr ) on the one hand and counts and percentages on the other hand .
for comparisons on categorical data chi - square and fisher exact test were used while mann - whitney u and kruskal - wallis tests were used to compare continuous data .
unless otherwise specified , bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons in post - hoc - tests .
kappa coefficients were used to examine agreement among pathologists in classifying histological findings .
performances of non - invasive tests were evaluated by roc curve analysis .
areas under roc curves ( auc ) , summary measures of overall diagnostic performance , were reported with their 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) ; auc > 0.9 was considered a high diagnostic test performance [ 14 ] .
to rank the performance of tests when used for diagnosing cd , aucs of roc curves derived from group a were compared [ 15 ] .
to rank the performance of tests when used for follow - up monitoring of cd , aucs of roc curves derived from group b cases were compared .
furthermore , we compared the performance of each single test when used for diagnosis vs. for follow - up monitoring of cd [ 16 ] .
we also used roc curve analysis to determine the optimal cut - off point for each test and calculated further performance measures like sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative likelihood - ratios ( lr + and lr - ) with 95 % cis .
where there was a 2x2 table with an empty cell 0.5 was added to each cell .
tests with either a lr + > 10 or lr - < 0.1 were considered informative and clinically useful [ 17 ] .
statistical calculations were performed with spss , version 20.0 ( spss , chicago , ill ) , and the free software r [ 18 ] .
for all statistical analyses , bonferroni corrected two - tailed p - values < 0.05 were considered significant .
ethics approval the institutional review board at st. anna children 's hospital approved this study .
since obtaining follow - up biopsies in children with cd deviates from our clinical practice , all group b children were covered by a clinical trial insurance policy valid throughout the 18 - month study period .
results demographics age of the 148 children ranged from 2 to 19 years ( median 11.3 ) .
children with newly diagnosed cd ( group a1 ) were younger ( median age in years [ iqr , min to max ] : 7.8 [ 6.2 , 2.0 to 17.6 ]) than both dyspeptic children ( group a2 ) ( median age in years [ iqr , min to max ] : 12.6 [ 5.3 , 3.3 to 18.0 ]) and group b children ( median age in years [ iqr , min to max ] : 11.8 [ 4.8 , 4.2 to 19.1 ]) ( p < 0.001 ) .
in all groups , girls outnumbered boys ( girls / boys in group a1 : 23 / 9 ; in group a2 : 48 / 15 ; in group b : 33 / 20 ) ( p = 0.26 ) .
performance of antibody tests in group a in predicting mucosal status in group a , tg2 - iga , dgp - iga and dgp - igg assays showed high diagnostic performance , exhibiting aucs >= 0.96 ( figures 2 and 3 , table 2 ) .
tg2 - igg performed less well , exhibiting an auc of about 0.85 .

within group a1 , all children had positive ema , positive ema being an inclusion criterion .
therefore , no performance evaluation for ema using roc curve analysis was done in group a. within group a2 , positive ema were found in 3 children ( specificity 0.94 ; 95 % ci 0.86 to 0.99 ) who all had marsh 0 as the result of the small intestinal biopsy. of these ema - positive group a2 children , 2 tested positive for tg2 - iga as well .
in 2 children , all antibody titres normalized on follow - up under gluten - containing diet within 6 months .
one these two children still had marsh 2 in a follow - up biopsy 28 months later .
the third ema - positive group a2 child was placed on a gfd by her parents for 2.5 years before presenting for follow - up visit .
at this visit , she was seronegative .
she is currently undergoing a gluten challenge from november 2012 onwards .
at her last visit in october 2013 she was still seronegative .
performance of antibody tests in group b comparing the performance of antibody tests in predicting mucosal status in group a vs. b , all tests performed less well in group b ( figures 2 and 3 , table 2 ) .
this performance loss was significant at an uncorrected level of alpha = 0.05 in case of dpg - iga ( p uncorr. = 0.004 ) .
empirical power ( calculated using 1000 bootstrap samples ) was 85 % for this comparison , and on average 33 % ( range 13 - 43 ) for the non - significant comparisons .
within group b , ema performed best followed by dgp - igg and tg2 - iga .
among the lrs obtained in group b , only the negative lr of ema was low enough ( 0.097 ) to effectively rule out persistent mucosal injury ( table 2 ) .
however , within group b , positive ema were detected in 18 children , 12 of whom exhibited mucosal healing. of these children with ema - positivity despite mucosal healing , all 12 had marsh 0 as the result of the small intestinal biopsy ; 9 ( 75 %) became ema - negative on further follow - up within the next 20 months .
before study enrollment , all of these 12 children initially had ema >= 1:160 and marsh >= 3a at diagnosis except one girl with ema 1:80 and marsh 2 .
on enrollment , all these children still had positive ema ranging from 1:5 to 1:80 despite marsh 0 in the study biopsies after a median of 1.5 years on a gfd .
comparing the duration of the gfd in group b children with mucosal healing , ema - positive children had been on the gfd for a shorter period of time ( median age in years [ iqr , min to max ] : 1.5 [ 0.8 , 1.0 to 3.0 ]) than the ema - negative children ( median age in years [ iqr , min to max ] : 2.3 [ 5.5 , 1.0 to 12.9 ]) ( p = 0.008 ) .
overall , of the group b children exhibiting marsh 0 , 4 had positive tg2 - iga , 15 positive tg2 - igg , 12 positive ema , 16 positive dpg - iga , and 10 positive dpg - igg .
all 35 ema - negative group b children with mucosal healing ( 34 children with marsh 0 and one with marsh 1 ) also had negative tg2 - iga .
histology in group a1 , where all children had histology consistent with cd , severe mucosal injury ( marsh 3b or 3c ) was found in 28 children ( 87.5 %) while the remaining 4 children ( 12.5 %) showed marsh 3a .
in group a2 , histology showed gastritis in 39 children , esophagogastritis in 8 , esophagitis in 1 , gastric ulcer in 1 and normal mucosa in 14 .
mucosal healing was found in 47 of 53 ( 88.7 %) group b children ( figure 4 , table 3 ). of these children with mucosal healing , 46 showed marsh 0 ( 86.8 %) and one marsh 1 ( 1.8 %). of those children with mucosal injury , one showed marsh 2 ( 1.8 %) , two marsh 3a ( 3.8 %) and 3 ( 5.7 %) marsh 3b ( figure 4 ) .

before reaching consensus , histological classification differed in 19 children ( 12.8 %) ; however , in only 2 of these children , classification differences pertained to the presence or absence of mucosal injury ( marsh >= 2 ) .
the pathologists finally agreed on marsh >= 2 in both children .
no adverse events of endoscopy including biopsies were encountered .
iga - deficient children in total , four children ( 2.7 %) , all girls , were iga - deficient .
three girls belonged to group a1 , one to group a2 .
discussion in this study , we provide evidence that antibody tests are more reliably predicting mucosal status in children with cd before than in children after prescription of a gfd .
in our patients , according to aucs ( figure 2 ) , tg2 - iga , dpg - igg and dpg - iga antibody tests performed very well in diagnosing cd in group a , similar to the performances reported elsewhere [ 19 ] .
however , when used for monitoring mucosal status in cd after a median of 2.2 years after primary diagnosis ( group b ) , all tests suffered a performance loss turning out to be significant in case of dpg - iga .
according to lrs , additional parameters quantifying the non - invasive tests' performance , tg2 - iga , dgp - igg and - iga antibodies were most informative and clinically useful with respect to diagnosing cd in group a. conversely , the limited ability to detect mucosal injury in group b was reflected by lrs + in all tests being < 10 .
regarding lrs - , only negative ema had an lr - < 0.1 thus being an informative and clinically useful marker of mucosal healing in cd [ 17 ] .
positive ema , however , were detected in 18 children from group b. twelve of these ema - positive children showed mucosal healing , a finding that reflects faster mucosal recovery than ema - seroconversion .
indeed , ema - positive children exhibiting mucosal healing had been on the gfd for a significantly shorter period of time than the ema - negative children .
moreover , 9 of 12 developed ema - negativity on further follow - up. this delayed seroconversion might partially explain positive ema in subjects showing mucosal healing [ 10 ] .
however , adherence to the dietary treatment was not evaluated in this study nor was small intestinal mucosa examined for iga deposits [ 20 ] .
therefore , we cannot rule out that serum ema - positivity is more sensitive than gross histological damage to detect minor dietary transgressions .
positive ema without histological evidence of cd were also detected in 3 children from group a2 .
ema normalized on a normal gluten - containing diet in 2 of the ema - positive group b children while the third became seronegative on a self - prescribed gfd and stayed seronegative even after a 11 - month gluten challenge .
however , since ema is a very strong predictor of a subsequent cd diagnosis [ 21 ] , there is need of further follow - up in these children including endoscopy .
all the children participating in the study underwent egd as criterion standard for the evaluation of the diagnostic reliability of the antibody tests .
in the light of the possibility to diagnose cd without biopsies [ 6 ] , an important finding of our study was that experiences with the diagnostic biopsy did not deter two thirds of the children eligible for group b from undergoing re - biopsy .
we found mucosal healing in the majority of the re - biopsied children , 90 % of them had marsh < 2 .
all group b children with mucosal injury were >= 9 years old and belonged to the subgroup that had been on a gfd < 2 years .
in children , the long - term mucosal healing rate was reported to be 100 % and histological recovery might even occur after more than 2 years after primary diagnosis [ 22 ] .
in contrast , it has been shown that children diagnosed after the age of 4 tend to follow the gfd less strictly and therefore are expected to have a higher prevalence of mucosal injury [ 23 ] .
surprisingly , a very low frequency ( 1.8 %) of isolated increase of intraepithelial lymphocyte count ( marsh 1 ) was found among group b children .
this finding could be related to the somewhat high cut - off for an increased intraepithelial lymphocyte count used in the study (>= 30 lymphocytes / 100 epithelial cells ) .
this study has several strengths .
in the first place , it was conducted in children .
concerning the correlation between follow - up histology and serology , most of the studies investigating this correlation were conducted in adults [ 2,3,8,9,11,24 - 27 ] .
however , in one pediatric study on the value of dgp - antibodies in the follow - up of cd , only 13 children had both re - endoscopy and follow - up serology [ 28 ] .
another study with children is of limited value in the aspect that only seroconverted children were included [ 29 ] .
then , in contrast to the current study , most of the studies reporting on correlations between follow - up histology and serologies are retrospective [ 2,26,28,29 ] .
another strength of the current study was the cut - off point being adjusted for the study population in case of all antibody tests according to roc analysis ( table 1 ) .
this adjustment is especially important in children since manufacturers' cut - offs are usually based on data from adults .
a further advantage was the use of aucs .
aucs as effective single indicators of the agreement between a test and a reference standard facilitate the comparison of the overall performance between different non - invasive diagnostic tests [ 15,16 ] .
additionally , in order to increase the reliability of the reference standard , two pathologists , before reaching a consensus diagnosis , independently reviewed all biopsy samples , which had been taken according to guidelines [ 7,30,31 ] .
furthermore , we were able to systematically examine all recommended serologic tests .
in contrast to recent recommendations for the use of dgp - iga in monitoring treated cd [ 5 ] , we found that dgp - iga suffered a significant performance loss when used for follow - up in children .
we therefore consider dgp - iga less reliable for follow - up purposes compared with ema , tg2 - iga and dgp - igg .
for the comparisons regarding the performance loss of the serologic tests other than dgp - iga , mean empirical power was rather low , a finding we consider an important limitation of this study .
therefore , future research is needed to further clarify the correlation of ema , tg2 - iga and dgp - igg with follow - up histology or identify other reliable non - invasive follow - up tests in cd. conclusion in conclusion , this study demonstrates the limited value of serologic testing in the follow - up of pediatric cd with respect to the mucosal status .
only the normalization of ema indicates mucosal healing with acceptable accuracy .
as long as there is a lack of more reliable tools for non - invasive follow - up , ema should be used as follow - up tool of first choice .
however , more reliable non - invasive follow - up tools would be of great clinical and research utility with respect to the individualization of the gfd strictness and upcoming studies evaluating the efficacy of new cd treatment modalities , respectively .

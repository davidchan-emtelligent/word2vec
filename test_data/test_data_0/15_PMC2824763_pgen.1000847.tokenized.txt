to investigate the underlying mechanisms of t2d pathogenesis , we looked for diabetes susceptibility genes that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) in a han chinese population .
a two - stage genome - wide association ( gwa ) study was conducted , in which 995 patients and 894 controls were genotyped using the illumina humanhap550 - duo beadchip for the first genome scan stage .
this was further replicated in 1,803 patients and 1,473 controls in stage 2 .
we found two loci not previously associated with diabetes susceptibility in and around the genes protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type d ( ptprd ) ( p = 8.54x10 - 10 ; odds ratio [ or ] = 1.57 ; 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] = 1.36 - 1.82 ) , and serine racemase ( srr ) ( p = 3.06x10 - 9 ; or = 1.28 ; 95 % ci = 1.18 - 1.39 ) .
we also confirmed that variants in kcnq1 were associated with t2d risk , with the strongest signal at rs2237895 ( p = 9.65x10 - 10 ; or = 1.29 , 95 % ci = 1.19 - 1.40 ). by identifying two novel genetic susceptibility loci in a han chinese population and confirming the involvement of kcnq1 , which was previously reported to be associated with t2d in japanese and european descent populations , our results may lead to a better understanding of differences in the molecular pathogenesis of t2d among various populations .
author summary type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) is a complex disease that involves many genes and environmental factors .
genome - wide and candidate - gene association studies have thus far identified at least 19 regions containing genes that may confer a risk for t2d .
however , most of these studies were conducted with patients of european descent .
we studied chinese patients with t2d and identified two genes , ptprd and srr , that were not previously known to be involved in diabetes and are involved in biological pathways different from those implicated in t2d by previous association reports .
ptprd is a protein tyrosine phosphatase and may affect insulin signaling on its target cells .
srr encodes a serine racemase that synthesizes d - serine from l - serine .
both d - serine ( coagonist ) and the neurotransmitter glutamate bind to nmda receptors and trigger excitatory neurotransmission in the brain .
glutamate signaling also regulates insulin and glucagon secretion in pancreatic islets .
thus , srr and d - serine , in addition to regulating insulin and glucagon secretion , may play a role in the etiology of t2d .
our study suggests that , in different patient populations , different genes may confer risks for diabetes .
our findings may lead to a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of t2d .
introduction type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) affects at least 6 % of the world 's population ; the worldwide prevalence is expected to double by 2025 [ 1 ] .
t2d is a complex disorder that is characterized by hyperglycemia , which results from impaired pancreatic beta cell function , decreased insulin action at target tissues , and increased glucose output by the liver [ 2 ] .
both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of t2d .
the disease is considered to be a polygenic disorder in which each genetic variant confers a partial and additive effect .
only 5 % - 10 % of t2d cases are due to single gene defects ; these include maturity - onset diabetes of the young ( mody ) , insulin resistance syndromes , mitochondrial diabetes , and neonatal diabetes [ 3 ] - [ 5 ] .
inherited variations have been identified from studies of monogenic diabetes , and have provided insights into beta cell physiology , insulin release , and the action of insulin on target cells [ 6 ] .
much effort has been devoted to finding common t2d genes , including genome - wide linkage , candidate - gene , and genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) .
whole - genome linkage scans have identified chromosomal regions linked to t2d ; however , with the exception of regions 1q [ 7 ] - [ 13 ] and 20q , which have been repeatedly mapped , linkage results vary from study to study [ 14 ] - [ 19 ] .
candidate - gene studies have provided strong evidence that common variants in the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - r ( pparg ) [ 20 ] , potassium inwardly - rectifying channel j11 ( kcnj11 ) [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] , transcription factor 2 isoform b ( tcf2 ) [ 24 ],[ 25 ] , and wolfram syndrome 1 ( wfs1 ) [ 26 ] genes are associated with t2d .
these genes all have strong biological links to diabetes , and rare , severe mutations cause monogenic diabetes .
gwas have accelerated the identification of t2d susceptibility genes , expanding the list from three in 2006 to over 20 genes in 2009 .
there are now at least 19 loci containing genes that increase risk of t2d , including pparg [ 27 ] , kcnj11 [ 27 ] , kcnq1 [ 28 ],[ 29 ] , cdkal1 [ 27 ],[ 29 ] - [ 33 ] , cdkn2a - 2b [ 27 ],[ 32 ],[ 33 ] , cdc123 - camk1d [ 34 ] , mtnr1b [ 35 ] - [ 37 ] , tcf7l2 [ 31 ],[ 38 ],[ 39 ] , tcf2 ( hnf1b ) , hhex - kif11 - ide [ 27 ],[ 32 ],[ 33 ],[ 38 ] , jazf1 [ 34 ] , igf2bp2 [ 27 ],[ 29 ],[ 32 ] , slc30a8 [ 27 ],[ 32 ],[ 33 ],[ 38 ] , thada [ 34 ] , adamts9 [ 34 ] , wfs1 [ 26 ] , fto [ 27 ],[ 31 ] , notch2 [ 34 ] , and tspan8 [ 34 ] .
variants in these genes have been identified almost exclusively in populations of european descent , except for kcnq1 ; individually , these variants confer a modest risk ( odds ratio [ or ] = 1.1 - 1.25 ) of developing t2d .
kcnq1 was identified as a t2d susceptibility gene in three gwa scans in japanese individuals , highlighting the need to extend large - scale association efforts to different populations , such as asian populations [ 28 ],[ 29 ],[ 40 ] .
the association of other previously reported loci ( cdkal1 , cdkn2a - 2b , igf2bp2 , tcf7l2 , slc30a8 , hhex , and kcnj11 ) with t2d were also replicated in the japanese population [ 29 ],[ 40 ],[ 41 ] .
to date , a gwa scan for t2d has not been conducted in the han chinese population , although the association of some known loci have been confirmed , including kcnq1 and cdkal1 , cdkn2a - 2b , mtnr1b , tcf7l2 , hnf1beta , and kcnj11 [ 42 ] - [ 47 ] .
therefore , we conducted a two - stage gwa scan for t2d in a han chinese population residing in taiwan .
there were a total of 2,798 cases and 2,367 normal controls ( 995 cases and 894 controls in stage 1 , 1,803 cases and 1,473 controls in stage 2 ) .
our accomplished objective was to identify new diabetes susceptibility loci that were associated with increased risk of t2d in a han chinese population .
results association analysis we conducted a two - stage gwas to identify genetic variants for t2d in the han - chinese residing in taiwan .
in the first stage , an exploratory genome - wide scan , we genotyped 995 t2d cases and 894 population controls using the illumina hap550duov3 chip ( figure 1 and table s1 ) .
for each sample genotyped in this study , the average call rate was 99.92 +/ - 0.12 % .
after applying stringent quality control criteria , high - quality genotypes for 516,737 snps ( 92.24 %) were obtained , with an average call rate of 99.92 +/ - 0.24 % ( table s2 ) .
the results of principal component analysis in stage 1 revealed no evidence for population stratification between t2d cases and controls ( p = 0.111 , fst statistics between populations < 0.001 ) ( text s1 ; figure s1 ) .
multidimensional scaling analysis using plink [ 48 ] produced similar results ( text s1 ; figure s2 ) .
furthermore , genomic control ( gc ) with a variance inflation factor lambda = 1.078 ( trend test ) did not substantially change the results of this gwas ( table s3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1000847.g001 figure 1 graphical summary of t2d gwas in a han chinese population .
t2d association was determined for snps on the illumina humanhap550k - duo chip .
the y - axis represents the - log10 p value and the x - axis represents each of the 516,212 snps used in the primary scan of 995 t2d cases and 894 controls .
we selected eight snps in seven regions : rs9985652 and rs2044844 on 4p13 , rs7192960 on 16q23.1 , rs7361808 on 20p13 , rs1751960 on 10q11.23 , rs4845624 on 1q21.3 , rs391300 on 17p13.3 , and rs648538 on 13q12.3 .
these snps had association p values of < 10 - 5 at stage 1 with any of the genotype , allele , trend , dominant , and recessive models for subsequent cross - platform validation using sequenom ( table 1 ; table s3 ) .
for snps with weaker associations ( p value between 10 - 4 and 10 - 5 ) , we searched for novel susceptibility candidates for t2d as implicated by ( 1 ) gene function identified by a bioinformatics approach and ( 2 ) an animal model showing defects in glucose homeostasis caused by genes within the same subfamily .
therefore , we selected snp rs17584499 ( p = 2.4x10 - 5 under best model ) for further investigation .
rs17584499 lies within protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type d ( ptprd ) .
we hypothesized that ptprd might play a role in the regulation of insulin signaling , because its subfamily members leukocyte common antigen - related ( lar ) and protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma ( ptprs ) exhibit defects in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in knockout and / or transgenic mice [ 49 ] - [ 51 ] .

we also evaluated the most significant snp ( rs231361 ) within kcnq1 , which was previously reported to be a diabetes susceptibility gene in a japanese population , as well as in populations of korean , chinese , and european ancestry [ 28 ],[ 29 ] .
together , these ten snps - - the 8 snps with association p < 10 - 5 , rs17584499 , and rs231361 - - were cross - platform validated and yielded consistent results using both illumina and sequenom .
the concordance rate for stage 1 samples typed on the illumina and sequenom platforms was 99.1 %+/ - 0.84 % ( table s4 ) .
we took these ten snps and an additional 29 neighboring snps within the linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) block forward to replicate in 3,803 additional samples ( stage 2 ; 1,803 cases and 1,473 controls ) .
the average call rate for each sample was 96.13 %+/ - 4.66 % .
after applying stringent quality control criteria , high - quality genotypes for 35 snps ( 89.7 %) were obtained , with an average call rate of 98.96 %+/ - 0.24 % ( table s2 ). of the ten snps selected in stage 1 , only three snps still showed a strong association in the stage 2 analysis : rs17584499 in ptprd at 9p24.1 - p23 , rs231359 in kcnq1 at 11p15.5 , and rs391300 in serine racemase ( srr ) at 17p13.3 ( table 1 ) .
we were unable to replicate the association between t2d and the remaining seven snps in atp8a1 / grxcr1 , maf / wwox , sirpa , lyzl1 / svil , rorc / tmem5 , and katnal1 in the stage 2 analysis ( table 1 ) .
joint analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 data revealed consistent results with stage 2 .
the most significant associations were found for rs391300 , rs17584499 , and rs231359 ( table 1 ; figure 2 ) .
these associations remained significant after calculating p values using 108 permutations of the disease state labels .
joint association analysis was performed with all of the 2,798 t2d cases and 2,367 controls ; this could achieve a power of 0.85 to detect a disease allele with a frequency of 0.15 and an or of 1.5 , assuming a disease prevalence of 0.06 , at a significant level of 0.05 ( table s5 ) .

green diamonds in the kcnq1 region ( c ) represent reported t2d - associated snps genotyped in all samples of joint analysis .
estimated recombination rates ( right y - axis ) based on the chinese hapmap population was plotted to reflect the local ld structure around the significant snps .
gene annotations were taken from ncbi .
identification of two novel t2d loci and confirmation of kcnq1 association two previously unknown loci were detected in our joint analysis of gwas data .
the strongest new association signal was found for rs17584499 in intron 10 of ptprd ( p = 8.54x10 - 10 [ trend test ] ; allelic or = 1.57 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] = 1.36 - 1.82 ) ( table 1 ; figure 2 ) .
the second strongest signal was found with rs391300 ( p = 3.06x10 - 9 [ trend test ] ; or = 1.28 , 95 % ci = 1.18 - 1.39 ) .
the nearby snp rs4523957 also demonstrated a significant association ( p = 1.44x10 - 8 ; or = 1.27 , 95 % ci = 1.17 - 1.38 ) .
snps rs391300 and rs4523957 were in tight ld with one another ( r 2 = 0.942 in hapmap hcb ) , and were located within the serine racemase gene ( srr ) .
snp rs231361 , located in intron 11 of kcnq1 , had a less significant association with t2d , and was selected in stage 1 ( p = 1.49x10 - 4 [ trend test ] ; or = 1.39 , 95 % ci = 1.17 - 1.64 ) ( table 1 ) .
we further genotyped eight additional snps within the same ld block from the hapmap asian group data : rs231359 yielded a p value of 4.56x10 - 4 with a trend test ( or = 1.36 , 95 % ci = 1.14 - 1.61 ) ( figure 2 ) .
rs231361 and rs231359 were in strong ld with one another ( r 2 = 1 in hapmap hcb ) , and were located approximately 164 kb upstream of snp rs2237897 , which was previously reported to be significantly associated with t2d in a japanese population [ 28 ],[ 29 ] .
we took rs231361 , rs231359 , and neighboring snps within the ld block forward to replicate in stage 2 .
joint analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 data revealed that rs231359 had an even stronger association with t2d than did rs231361 ( rs231359 : p = 3.43x10 - 8 , or = 1.33 , 95 % ci = 1.2 - 1.48 ; rs231361 : p = 2.89x10 - 7 , or = 1.3 , 95 % ci = 1.18 - 1.44 ) .
additional snps that were reported to be significantly associated with t2d in a japanese population were further genotyped [ 28 ],[ 29 ] .
the average call rate for each sample was 99.12 %+/ - 7.21 % .
after applying stringent quality control criteria , we obtained high - quality genotypes with an average call rate of 99.16 %+/ - 0.18 % ( table s2 ) .
snp rs2237895 showed the strongest association with t2d of all the genotyped snps in kcnq1 ( p = 9.65x10 - 10 ; or = 1.29 , 95 % ci = 1.19 - 1.40 ) ( figure 2 and figure s3 ; table s6 ) .
conditioning on the rs2237895 , the statistical significance of rs231361 ( or rs231359 ) disappeared .
it seems the same underlying biological effect between the 2 snps ( table s7 ) .
subsequently , we sequenced all of the exons , intron - exon boundaries , and up to 1.2 kb of the promoter region of the kcnq1 gene in 50 individuals with t2d , and identified 42 polymorphic variations , including one nonsynonymous p448r polymorphism and two novel snps with minor allele frequency > 0.03 .
we then genotyped the two novel snps and one nonsynonymous polymorphism ; however , none of these snps showed an association with t2d ( table s6 ) .
discussion our gwas for t2d in a han chinese population found two previously unreported susceptibility genes .
all of the significant variants detected in our study showed modest effects , with an or between 1.21 and 1.57 .
two loci with less - significant associations in our primary scan ( stage 1 ) , ptprd and kcnq1 , were selected for further replication ; both showed compelling evidence of association in joint analysis .
the susceptibility loci we identified in this study need to be further replicated in additional populations. of the 18 loci previously reported to be associated with t2d ( with the exception of kcnq1 ) , none of the p values for any of the snps within or near the genes reached 10 - 5 using allele , genotype , trend , dominant , or recessive models ( table s8 ; figure s4 ) .
three snps within cdkal1 , jazf1 , and hnf1b had the lowest p values , ranging from 5x10 - 4 to 10 - 5 , among the 18 known loci ( table s8 ) .
no significant associations were found within these regions in our han chinese population .
the strongest new signal was observed for rs17584499 in ptprd .
the overall fst among 11 hapmap groups for rs17584499 was estimated to be 0.068 [ 52 ] , which indicated a significant difference in allele frequencies among the populations ( p < 0.0001 , chi - square test ) ( table s9 ) .
ptprd is widely expressed in tissues , including skeletal muscle and pancreas , and is expressed highest in the brain .
ptprd - deficient mice exhibit impaired learning and memory , early growth retardation , neonatal mortality , and posture and motor defects [ 53 ] .
multiple mrna isoforms are expressed by alternative splicing and / or alternative transcription start sites in a developmental and tissue - specific manner [ 54 ],[ 55 ] .
ptprd belongs to the receptor type iia ( r2a ) subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases ( ptps ) .
the r2a ptp subfamily comprises lar , ptprs , and ptprd .
the r2a family has been implicated in neural development , cancer , and diabetes [ 56 ] .
although the complex phenotype including neurological defects seen in knockout mice could obscure the roles of these genes in glucose homeostasis , lar - and ptprs - deficient mice were demonstrated to have altered glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity [ 49 ] - [ 51 ] .
transgenic mice overexpressing lar in skeletal muscle show whole - body insulin resistance [ 57 ] .
because r2a subfamily members are structurally very similar [ 54 ] , ptprd could play a role in t2d pathogenesis and should be further characterized .
the second new association locus was found for rs391300 and rs4523957 in the biologically plausible candidate gene srr .
srr encodes a serine racemase that synthesizes d - serine from l - serine [ 58 ],[ 59 ] .
d - serine is a physiological co - agonist of the n - methyl d - aspartate ( nmda ) class of glutamate receptors , the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors mediating synaptic neurotransmission in the brain [ 60 ],[ 61 ] .
nmda receptor activation requires binding of glutamate and d - serine , which plays a neuromodulatory role in nmda receptor transmission , synaptic plasticity , cell migration , and neurotoxicity [ 62 ] .
d - serine and srr are also present in the pancreas [ 63 ] .
glutamate signaling functions in peripheral tissues , including the pancreas , and positively modulates secretion of both glucagon and insulin in pancreatic islets [ 64 ] - [ 66 ] .
the nearby snp rs216193 also showed significant association ( p = 2.49x10 - 6 ) ; this snp resides 3.8 kb upstream from srr , within smg - 6 homolog , nonsense mediated mrna decay factor ( c. elegans ) ( smg6 ) .
rs216193 was in tight ld with rs391300 ( r 2 = 0.942 in hapmap hcb ) .
based on their biological functions and the association results , neither smg6 nor any of the nearby genes tsr1 , sgsm2 , mnt , and mett10d were compelling candidates for association witht2d .
however , srr was significantly associated with t2d ; thus , we suggest that dysregulation of d - serine could alter glutamate signaling and affect insulin or glucagon secretion in t2d pathogenesis .
rs7192960 also had a suggestive association with t2d ( p = 1.32x10 - 5 ; or = 1.21 , 95 % ci = 1.11 - 1.33 ) .
this snp which lies approximately 211 kb downstream of v - maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog ( avian ) ( maf ) and 170 kb downstream of ww domain containing oxidoreductase ( wwox ) .
wwox is a tumor suppressor gene that spans the second most common human fragile site fra16d [ 67 ],[ 68 ] , and is disrupted in many tumors , including pancreatic carcinoma [ 67 ] , [ 69 ] - [ 73 ] .
maf encodes the transcription factor c - maf , a member of the maf family of basic - zip ( bzip ) transcription factors .
c - maf is involved in development and differentiation of the lens [ 74 ],[ 75 ] , kidney [ 76 ] , immune system [ 77 ] , adipose tissue [ 78 ] , and pancreas [ 79 ] .
it is expressed in alpha cells of the pancreatic islets [ 80 ] , and is a strong transactivator of the glucagon promoter that regulates glucagon gene expression [ 80 ],[ 81 ] .
c - maf is also associated with early - onset and morbid adult obesity [ 82 ] .
our gwas revealed that kcnq1 , which was previously reported to be associated with t2d in several populations , was also associated with t2d in a han chinese population residing in taiwan .
kcnq1 encodes the pore - forming alpha subunit of a voltage - gated k + channel ( kvlqt1 ) , which is involved in repolarization of the action potential in cardiac muscle [ 83 ],[ 84 ] .
mutations in kcnq1 cause long qt syndrome [ 85 ],[ 86 ] and familial atrial fibrillation [ 87 ] .
kcnq1 is widely expressed , including in the heart , brain , kidney , liver , intestine , and pancreas [ 88 ] - [ 90 ] .
it is also expressed in pancreatic islets , and blockade of the kvlqt1 channel stimulates insulin secretion in insulin - secreting ins - 1 cells [ 91 ] .
kcnq1 knockout mice have cardiac dysfunctions [ 88 ],[ 92 ] and enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity [ 93 ] .
in our study , variants in the coding region did not show an association with t2d .
the functional variant ( s ) could be located in the regulatory element of kcnq1 , rather than in the coding region .
we did not find an association between either cdkal1 or igf2bp2 and t2d , in contrast with the results described in a previous study [ 29 ] , nor did we find t2d associated with various other genes identified in populations of european descent .
in conclusion , we identified two previously unknown loci that are associated with t2d in a han chinese population , and confirmed the reported association of kcnq1 with t2d .
the novel t2d risk loci may involve genes that are implicated in insulin sensitivity and control of glucagon and insulin secretion : ptprd may participate in the regulation of insulin action on its target cells , while srr variants may alter glutamate signaling in the pancreas , thus regulating insulin and / or glucagon secretion .
our study suggests that in different patient populations , different genes may confer risks for diabetes , which may lead to a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of t2d .
materials and methods ethical statement the study was approved by the institutional review board and the ethics committee of each institution .
written informed consent was obtained from each participant in accordance with institutional requirements and the declaration of helsinki principles .
subject participants a total of 2,798 unrelated individuals with t2d , age > 20 years , were recruited from china medical university hospital ( cmuh ) , taichung , taiwan ; chia - yi christian hospital ( cych ) , chia - yi , taiwan ; and national taiwan university hospital ( ntu ) , taipei , taiwan .
all of the t2d cases were diagnosed according to medical records and fasting plasma glucose levels using american diabetic association criteria .
subjects with type 1 diabetes , gestational diabetes , and maturity - onset diabetes of the young ( mody ) were excluded from this study .
for the two - stage gwas , we genotyped 995 t2d cases and 894 controls in the first exploratory genome - wide scan ( stage 1 ) .
in the replication stage ( stage 2 ) , we genotyped selected snps in additional samples from 1,803 t2d cases and 1,473 controls .
the controls were randomly selected from the taiwan han chinese cell and genome bank [ 94 ] .
the criteria for controls in the association study were ( 1 ) no past diagnostic history of t2d , ( 2 ) hba1c ranging from 3.4 to 6 , and ( 3 ) bmi < 32 .
the two control groups were comparable with respect to bmi , gender , age at study , and level of hba1c .
all of the participating t2d cases and controls were of han chinese origin , which is the origin of 98 % of the taiwan population .
details of demographic data are shown in table s10 .
genotyping genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood using the puregene dna isolation kit ( gentra systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) .
in stage 1 , whole genome genotyping using the illumina humanhap550 - duo beadchip was performed by decode genetics ( reykjavik , iceland ) .
genotype calling was performed using the standard procedure implemented in beadstudio ( illumina , inc. , san diego , ca , usa ) , with the default parameters suggested by the platform manufacturer .
quality control of genotype data was performed by examining several summary statistics .
first , the ratio of loci with heterozygous calls on the x chromosome was calculated to double - check the subject 's gender .
total successful call rate and the minor allele frequency of cases and controls were also calculated for each snp .
snps were excluded if they : ( 1 ) were nonpolymorphic in both cases and controls , ( 2 ) had a total call rate < 95 % in the cases and controls combined , ( 3 ) had a minor allele frequency < 5 % and a total call rate < 99 % in the cases and controls combined , and ( 4 ) had significant distortion from hardy - weinberg equilibrium in the controls ( p < 10 - 7 ) .
genotyping validation was performed using the sequenom iplex assay ( sequenom massarray system ; sequenom , san diego , ca , usa ) .
in the replication stage ( stage 2 ) , snps showing significant or suggestive associations with t2d and their neighboring snps within the same ld block were genotyped using the sequenom iplex assay .
the neighboring snps in the same ld were selected from the hapmap asian ( chb + jpt ) group data for fine mapping the significant signal .
statistical analysis t2d association analysis was carried out to compare allele frequency and genotype distribution between cases and controls using five single - point methods for each snp : genotype , allele , trend ( cochran - armitage test ) , dominant , and recessive models .
the most significant test statistic obtained from the five models was chosen .
snps with p values less than a = 2x10 - 8 , a cut - off for the multiple comparison adjusted by bonferroni correction , were considered to be significantly associated with the traits .
the joint analysis was conducted by combining the data from the stage 1 and 2 samples .
we also applied fisher 's method to combine p values for joint analysis .
the permutation test was carried out genome - wide for 106 permutations , in which the phenotypes of subjects were randomly rearranged .
for better estimation of empirical p values , the top snps were reexamined using 108 permutations .
each permutation proceeded as follows : ( 1 ) the case and control labels were shuffled and redistributed to subjects , and ( 2 ) the test statistics of the corresponding association test was calculated based on the shuffled labels .
the empirical p value was defined as the number of permutations that were at least as extreme as the original divided by the total number of permutations .
detection of possible population stratification that might influence association analysis was carried out using principle component analysis , multidimensional scaling analysis , and genomic control ( text s1 ) .
quantile - quantile ( q - q ) plots were then used to examine p value distributions ( figure 3 and figure s5 ) .

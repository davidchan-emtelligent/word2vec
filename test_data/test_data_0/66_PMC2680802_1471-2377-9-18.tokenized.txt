background there is growing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in atherogenesis .
previous studies show that c - reactive protein ( crp ) , an inflammatory marker , is associated with stroke outcomes and future vascular events .
it is not clear whether this is due a direct dose - response effect or rather an epiphenomenon .
we studied the effect of crp measured within 24 hours after stroke onset on functional outcome , mortality and future vascular events .
methods we prospectively studied 498 patients with ischemic stroke who were admitted within 24 hours after the onset of symptoms .
crp and nih stroke scale ( nihss ) were measured at the time of admission .
short - term functional outcome was measured by modified rankin scale ( mrs ) and barthel adl index ( bi ) 7 days after admission .
patients were followed for up to 2.5 years for long - term mortality and future vascular events data .
results the median crp at admission was 3 mg / l. high crp was associated with high nihss ( p = 0.01 ) and high long - term mortality ( p < 0.0001 ) .
after adjusting for confounding variables , high crp remained to be associated with high nihss ( p = 0.02 ) and high long - term mortality ( p = 0.002 ) .
high crp was associated with poor short - term functional outcomes ( mrs > 3 ; bi < 95 ) ( p = 0.01 ; p = 0.03 ) .
however , the association was not significant after adjusting for confounding variables including stroke severity ( p = 0.98 ; p = 0.88 ) .
high crp was not associated with future vascular events ( p = 0.98 ) .
conclusion admission crp is associated with stroke severity and long - term mortality when measured at least 24 hours after onset .
there is a crude association between high crp and short - term functional outcome which is likely secondary to stroke severity .
crp is an independent predictor of long - term mortality after ischemic stroke .
background there is growing evidence that c - reactive protein ( crp ) , a peripheral marker of inflammation , is also a marker of generalized atherosclerosis [ 1 ] .
this relationship between inflammation and atherosclerosis make crp a potential marker for prognosis after vascular events and a potential predictor of future vascular events .
large population - based studies show that high crp is a risk factor for future cardiovascular events [ 2 - 4 ] .
the recent jupiter trial shows that the use of rosuvastatin in patients with high crp has a significant impact both in reducing the crp level and in lowering future vascular events [ 5 ] .
this indicates the role of inflammation in atherogenesis and suggests that crp can be used as marker of future events .
the role of crp as a marker during and after ischemic stroke is less extensively studied in comparison to coronary artery disease .
the rotterdam study shows that although high crp is associated with the risk for future stroke , it is not useful for individual stroke prediction [ 6 ] .
on the other hand the framingham study shows that high crp is associated with a greater risk for ischemic stroke or tia [ 7 ] .
studies in patients who already had a stroke shows an association between high crp and stroke presentation , outcomes and future vascular events [ 8 - 14 ] .
the sample sizes in these studies , however , have been relatively modest , and follow - up usually short ( 3 - 12 months ) .
we conducted a collaborative review of 11 studies published between 1999 and 2004 .
there was substantial variation in sample sizes ( range 37 - 716 ) , study design ( prospective , retrospective , controls included ) , subtype of stroke included and main outcome measures [ 8 - 12,14 - 19 ] .
moreover , the results from some studies were negative .
in their pivotal review , di napoli et al concluded that there is insufficient evidence to justify the routine use of crp for either primary or secondary risk stratification for cerebrovascular disease alone [ 20 ] .
in addition , only few studies have analyzed the relationship between elevated admission crp levels and stroke severity or stroke etiology .
in short , there is need for more studies to clarify the exact role of crp in cerebrovascular disease .
the aim of this study was to help clarify the role of early crp in ischemic stroke by determining its association with stroke severity , stroke etiology , functional outcome , mortality and future vascular events , in a larger study than most of the previous studies .
methods data for this prospective study was obtained at haukeland university hospital , bergen , norway , which serves a well - defined population of 235,000 .
the study was done as a part of a cohort study ( the bergen stroke study ) in which data was collected from all ischemic stroke patients admitted to the department of neurology from february 2006 to september 2008 .
patients who were admitted more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms were excluded .
patients who were found with stroke or awoke with stroke were included if it was known that the patient had been normal < 24 hours before blood sampling .
patients whose clinical and radiological findings were not consistent with stroke were excluded from the study .
at admission , plain ct scan of the head was done to rule out haemorrhage .
blood samples for crp were taken at the time of admission , and analyzed by tina - quant latex method using modular p ( roche diagnostics ) .
the nih stroke score ( nihss ) was assessed by a neurologist at the time of admission .
the nihss was categorized as 0 - 7 , 8 - 14 and > 14 .
eligible candidates were given intravenous thrombolysis according to sits - most protocol [ 21 ] .
risk factors were defined according to protocol .
hypertension ( htn ) was defined as treatment with antihypertensive drugs before stroke onset or introduction of antihypertensive drugs before discharge .
diabetes mellitus ( dm ) was defined as treatment with glucose lowering medications or diet prior to stroke onset , or a fasting serum glucose > 7.7 mmol / l during hospital stay .
smoking was defined as the use of at least one cigarette per day prior to stroke onset .
based on the clinical presentation of stroke , patients were classified according to the oxford community stroke project ( ocsp ) classification [ 22 ] .
the etiology of stroke was classified according to toast criteria [ 23 ] .
clinical details such as physiologic parameters , type of treatments and radiographic findings were registered .
age was categorized as < 50 , 50 - 59 , 60 - 69 and >= 70 years .
outcome was measured by modified rankin scale ( mrs ) and barthel adl index ( bi ) 7 days after stroke onset .
poor outcome was defined as mrs > 2 or bi < 95 .
survival data was obtained from the national population registry of norway , where all the permanent residents are registered .
admissions for acute vascular events after the index stroke admission were obtained from searches of the electronic discharge diagnosis registry at the hospital using icd10 codes i20 , i21 , i22 , i63 , g45 ( excluding g454 ) , i61 , i74 .
these electronic events were then manually validated by two of the authors ( jb , ti ) and the time to first future event of each type ascertained .
approximately half of the electronic discharge registry events were false positives because of the re - use of the acute vascular event diagnosis when the " sequelae of " should have been used .
informed consent was obtained from all patients .
the study was approved by the local ethical committee .
analysis due to the skewed distribution of crp , we chose somewhat arbitrary cut points for crp of 3 and 10 mg / dl , corresponding approximately to the median ( 50 %) and upper 20 % distribution .
the 3 mg / dl cut point corresponds to the " high " crp level in previous primary prevention studies [ 24 ] .
first , the prevalence of an elevated crp was studied in various groups such as pre - stroke demographic factors , pre - existing illness , risk factors for stroke , stroke severity and time to hospital .
a multivariate analysis was then performed to identify independent predictors of an elevated crp .
to study the association of crp with stroke severity , etiology and outcomes we performed the following analysis .
the crude association of categories of crp with stroke severity ( nihss and ocsp ) , etiology ( toast ) , functional outcome ( mrs and bi ) , mortality and future vascular events was computed .
the pearson chi2 test was used for count table data , and the log rank test used for survival - type tables .
for the adjusted analysis , logistic regression was used for most analyses .
for dependent variables with two outcome levels , ordinary logistic regression was .
for dependent variables with more than two outcome levels , multivariate logistic regression was performed .
for survival - type outcomes , cox regression was used .
for dependent variables except stroke severity , we adjusted for age , sex , diabetes , thrombolysis and stroke severity ( nihss ) .
when stroke severity was the dependent variable , adjustment was done for age , sex , thrombolysis and the presence of dm. results during the inclusion period , 743 patients with ischemic stroke were registered. of these , 238 were excluded because the interval between stroke onset and blood sampling was > 24 hours. of the remaining , seven did not have an admission crp , leaving 498 patients for the present analysis .
the population characteristics with regards to important pre - stroke risk factors , stroke presentation and outcomes are shown in table 1 .
the mean age ( sd ) of the study population was 69.3 ( 14 ) years .
men , on average , were 7.5 years younger than women .
the distribution of crp ( mg / l ) values was highly skewed ( median 3 , 90 % percentile 18 ) , with a somewhat higher geometric mean value in women ( 3.7 ) than in men ( 3.1 ) ( p = 0.08 ) .

in univariate analysis , only stroke severity ( nihss , ocsp ) and pre - existing diabetes were significant .
in a multivariate model including one measure of stroke severity ( nihss ) and pre - existing diabetes , an elevated crp was independently predicted both by stroke severity and pre - existing diabetes ( p = 0.03 ; p = 0.04 ) .

in table 3 we show the association of crp with stroke severity , etiology , short - term outcome , mortality and future vascular events .
an elevated crp was associated with increased stroke severity ( nihss , ocsp ) ( p = 0.01 , p = 0.006 ) .
seventy nine percent of the low - crp group had a mild stroke ( nihss < 7 ) , whereas only 60 % of the high - crp group had a mild stroke .
the most common stroke subtype in the high crp group was taci ( 29 %) , whereas in the low and medium crp groups the most common presentation was paci ( 41 % and 49 %) .
the likely etiology of stroke on the toast classification was statistically significantly associated with crp ( p = 0.04 ) .
the high crp group had a higher frequency of stroke of cardioembolic origin ( 38 % in the high crp group vs. 21 % in the low crp group ) .
crp was associated with short - term functional outcome on mrs ( p = 0.04 ) , with the high crp group having a 44 % risk for a poor outcome vs. 26 % for the low crp group .
crp was associated with short - term functional outcome on bi ( p = 0.03 ) , with the high crp group having a 40 % risk for poor outcome vs. 24 % for the low crp group .
crp was not associated with future hospital admissions for vascular events ( p = 0.98 ) .

the unadjusted analysis showed a significant association with stroke severity , functional outcomes , mortality and etiology .
stroke severity was associated with admission crp even after adjusting for age , sex , intravenous thrombolysis and the presence of dm. after adjustment , crp was predictive of mortality but not for functional outcomes .

discussion our study in ischemic stroke patients shows that a high crp at admission is associated with more severe stroke , cardioembolic etiology , poor functional outcome and high mortality .
after adjusting for the effect of confounding factors , high crp remained to be associated with more severe stroke and high mortality , but not with functional outcome or etiology .
crp was not associated with future vascular events .
the association between high crp and a high stroke severity remains unexplained .
there is a distinct possibility that elevated crp is a direct response to the extent of cerebral tissue injury [ 25 ] .
but as an inflammatory marker , it is also possible that high crp is associated with underlying processes that cause a more severe stroke .
a small number of papers with a relatively small number of patients have studied the time course of crp after stroke onset [ 19,26 - 28 ] .
some of them have found an increase in crp after stroke .
the level of increment had been either very small - about one unit increase [ 19,27,28 ] , or a very large increase ( 10 units increase in 24 hours ) [ 26 ] .
these discrepancies , too , remain unexplained. whether high crp causes more severe stroke or vice versa needs to be further studied in population - based larger cohort studies , or in clinical studies with very early and closely spaced repeated measurements .
the prognostic significance of early crp after stroke has significant clinical implications .
previous stroke studies have shown an association between high crp and poor outcome [ 8,10,11,13,14,29 ] .
our study showed that the long - term mortality was significantly associated with crp even after adjusting for age , sex and stroke severity .
we measured long - term mortality over a period of 2.5 years .
since we did not have data on the causes of death , we cannot be certain that the high mortality in patients with elevated crp is due to vascular events .
if most of the death were secondary to a vascular event , we would anticipate a similar association between crp and future vascular events .
however , this was not found in our study .
the results from a previous study also shows that crp is associated with the risk of death but not with vascular death or future vascular events [ 12 ] .
in clinical practice we may consider high crp as a " red flag " marker of high mortality , but the therapeutic implications of this finding remain uncertain .
the positive association between high crp and cardioembolic etiology is rather intricately related to stroke severity .
stroke secondary to cardioembolism tends to have a higher stroke severity .
in our study the mean nihss of stroke secondary to cardioembolism ( 7.7 ) was higher than large - artery ( 4.2 ) , small - vessel ( 3.1 ) , and unknown ( 5.1 ) .
this might explain why the association between high crp and cardioembolism was no more significant after adjusting for confounding factors including stroke severity .
apart from that , a large proportion of patients in our study ( 42 %) had unknown etiology which may add further uncertainty .
our study , in which crp was measured within 24 hours after stroke onset , showed a crude association between high crp and poor short - term functional outcome .
however , when adjustment was done for confounding factors including stroke severity , the association was no more significant .
we speculate that high crp by itself is not damaging per se. it is probably an epiphenomenon for poor outcome .
a recent large population genetics study suggests that crp is partly genetically determined , and that a high crp level is not damaging per se [ 30 ] .
studies in patients free of vascular disease at baseline show a positive association between high crp and future vascular events [ 31 - 33 ] , we failed to show such an association in stroke patients when crp was measured within 24 hours after stroke onset .
a few previous studies were done in which crp was measured early after stroke onset ( within 12 hours ) [ 15,19,34 ] .
two of those studies failed to show any association between crp and future vascular events [ 15,19 ] , but one of them showed an association between high crp and future vascular events [ 34 ] .
chronic inflammation is considered to be a risk factor for future vascular events [ 35 ] .
baseline crp in the absence of obvious causes like infection or inflammation may represent the chronic inflammatory status of a patient .
crp level after the acute phase of stroke , however , is confounded by many factors including index stroke severity , co - existing infections , stress and complications of stroke such as deep vein thrombosis [ 14 ] .
some of limitations of our study must be acknowledged .
crp was measured only at one time point ( at admission ) .
single crp measurement can be influenced by many factors such as infections , stress , timing of measurement and lab error .
serial measurements of crp were not available because this was not considered during the planning of the epidemiological cohort that this study arises from .
another limitation of the study was the un - availability of a cause - specific survival data .
data on mortality from vascular events only , would have been more ideal as this would directly link the role of crp in stroke outcome .
another limitation of this study was the substantial heterogeneity in stroke , and the subsequent necessity of a relatively large sample size to detect effects .
however , compared to the previous studies , this is a relatively large study .
given that the etiology of stroke is complex , the sample size problem is expected .
conclusion a high admission crp in ischemic stroke patients is clearly associated with more severe stroke and high long - term mortality .
the clinical implications of these findings are unclear at present .
it remains to be seen whether crp is a marker of stroke severity , or is a response to stroke , or a mixture of both .

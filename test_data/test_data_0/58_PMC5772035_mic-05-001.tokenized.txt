inhibition of amebic lysosomal acidification blocks amebic trogocytosis and cell killing .
amebiasis entamoeba trogocytosis cytotoxicity work from the authors' lab was supported by nih grant r01 ai026649 .
trogocytosis , the intracellular transfer of fragments of cell material ( including intact proteins but not whole cells ) has been implicated in both microbial pathogenesis and the host defense against pathogens .
although trogocytosis has been observed in a number of organisms , from humans to amebae , the process remains poorly understood .
entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite and human pathogen that kills human cells in a nibbling - like process termed amebic trogocytosis .
we have recently found that amebic lysosomes play a key role in amebic trogocytosis and cell killing .
impairing lysosome acidification with pharmacological inhibitors dramatically decreased amebic trogocytosis and cell killing .
our data suggest that these inhibitors do not block the ingestion of an initial fragment , but rather prevent continued trogocytosis and the ingestion of multiple fragments .
these findings raise a number of interesting biological questions , notably how do lysosomes function in amebic trogocytosis ?
a deeper understanding of the role of lysosomes in trogocytosis could provide interesting insights into trogocytosis as a fundamental biological process .
entamoeba histolytica causes potentially fatal diarrhea , dysentery and liver abscesses in humans 1 .
tissue destruction is the hallmark of invasive e. histolytica infection , manifesting as massive intestinal ulceration and abscesses at other sites .
this tissue destruction is likely driven by amebic trogocytosis 2 .
amebic trogocytosis begins with the attachment of the parasite to a host cell , followed by ingestion of fragments of the host cell .
the fragments appear to be surrounded by two membranes , an outer membrane derived from the amebic plasma membrane and an inner layer derived from the host membrane .
the fragments were shown to contain host cell membrane , cytoplasm , and mitochondria .
the parasite continues to ingest fragments of the host cell until the host cell eventually dies .
it appears that this continued ingestion of multiple fragments is necessary for cell killing and pathogenesis 2 .
unfortunately , little is known about the mechanism of amebic trogocytosis .
trogocytosis has been observed in a number of other organisms .
in humans , trogocytosis has been observed in lymphocytes , including t - , b - , nk and dendritic cells .
in lymphocytes , trogocytosis has been implicated in cell - cell communication ( with ingestion of the t cell receptor complexed with hla from antigen presenting cells implicated in sustained activation of t cells ) and defense against pathogens 34 .
the process is distinguished from other methods of intracellular transfer , such as phagocytosis , by the transfer of pieces of cell material ( including intact proteins but not whole cells ) , the requirement for close cell - cell contact , and the rapid rate of uptake ( within minutes ) , all of which are reminiscent of what we observe in amebic trogocytosis 3 .
in t - and nk - cells , trogocytosis is a metabolically active process that requires signaling in the acceptor cell , and modulation of both the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular ca2 + 5 .
small gtpases and phosphatidylinositide 2 - kinase ( pi3k ) have also been identified as key players in t - cell trogocytosis 5 .
a process referred to as trogocytosis has been observed in the free - living amoeba naegleria fowleri , a human parasite that may use this process to destroy host cells , but again the mechanism is unknown 67 .
a trogocytosis - like process observed in plasmodium falciparum - infected red blood cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria 678 .
trogocytosis also plays a role in the spread of the intracellular bacteria francisella tularensis 9 .
early research indicated that inhibiting amebic lysosomal acidification impaired amebic killing of human cell 10 .
interestingly , studies comparing e. histolytica with the less - pathogenic species entamoeba dispar have noted that acidification of the phagosomes takes significantly longer in e. dispar and does not reach the same level of acidification , suggesting a role for lysosomes in the pathogenesis of amebiasis 11 .
in our recent work , we found that inhibition of lysosome acidification by either a weak base or a vacuolar - atpase inhibitor significantly decreased amebic trogocytosis and cell killing 12 .
we observed that interference with acidification does not impact the initiation of amebic trogocytosis , but rather impairs continued ingestion and cell killing .
treatment with acidification inhibitors also decreased phagocytosis , suggesting that lysosomes play a crucial role in this process as well .
importantly , fluid - phase endocytosis was not affected , indicating that these drugs do not simply block all endocytic processes 12 .
there are several possible roles that lysosomes might play in amebic trogocytosis ( figure 1 ) : lysosomes might be required for efficient degradation of the ingested fragments , for rapid recycling of ingested receptors and membrane , or for the rapid formation of an acidified synapse at the site of ameba - host interaction .
during amebic trogocytosis , parasites ingest numerous host cell fragments , which must be degraded .
in eukaryotes , it is well established that lysosomes are crucial for the turnover of ingested material .
breakdown of material in the lysosome requires lysosomal enzymes , many of which are ph - dependent .
weak bases , such as the ammonium chloride used in our studies , raise the ph of amebic lysosomes , which would impair the function of ph - dependent lysosomal enzymes 10 .
indeed , previous work has shown that concanamycin a - treated parasites fail to acidify their phagosomes to normal levels and are impaired in their ability to degrade phagocytosed leishmania 11 .
thus it is possible that lysosomes are crucial for continued amebic trogocytosis and cell killing because they are required for efficient degradation of the ingested host fragments .
figure 1 figure 1 : model of possible roles for amebic lysosomes in amebic trogocytosis and cell killing .
amebic lysosomes might be required for rapid degradation of the ingested fragments , for efficient recycling of ingested receptors and membrane , or for the rapid formation of an acidified synapse at the site of ameba - host interaction .
blue triangles vesicles indicate v - atpases .
red ovals indicate amebic rab7b .
previous work has shown that trogocytosed fragments are surrounded by amebic membrane , likely derived from the amebic plasma membrane 2 .
thus , it is likely that the amebae internalize plasma membrane and surface receptors as they ingest fragments .
our data show that interference with acidification blocks receptor - dependent processes - both amebic trogocytosis and phagocytosis - but does not impair a receptor - independent process , fluid - phase endocytosis 12 .
together these data suggest that rapid recycling of membrane and receptors , facilitated by the amebic lysosomes , may be required for continued amebic trogocytosis and , thus , cell killing .
it has been suggested that amebic lysosomes may form an acidified synapse at the site of host cell attachment similar to the synapse created by mammalian osteoclasts , which secrete lysosomes into an acidified synapse during bone matrix degradation 13 .
live confocal microscopy and electron microscopy have both shown a massive accumulation of actin and exclusion of vesicles at the site of active host fragment ingestion , making this hypothesis less likely 2 .
however , it is possible that amebic lysosomes fuse at the ameba - host interface after attachment but before active ingestion begins .
in conclusion , this work sheds new light on an observation , first made 30 years ago , that weak bases inhibit amebic killing of human cells , by demonstrating that acid vesicle neutralization acts through the inhibition of trogocytosis .
this work raises several interesting questions and further investigation will contribute to a better understanding of the nature of trogocytosis as a fundamental biological process .

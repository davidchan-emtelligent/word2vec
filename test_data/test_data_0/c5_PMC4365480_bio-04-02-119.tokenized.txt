abstract epigenetic silencing is critical for maintaining germline stem cells in drosophila ovaries .
however , it remains unclear how the differentiation factor , bag - of - marbles ( bam ) , counteracts transcriptional silencing .
we found that the trimethylation of lysine 36 on histone h3 ( h3k36me3 ) , a modification that is associated with gene activation , is enhanced in bam - expressing cells .
h3k36me3 levels were reduced in flies deficient in bam .
inactivation of the set2 methyltransferase , which confers the h3k36me3 modification , in germline cells markedly reduced h3k36me3 and impaired differentiation .
genetic analyses revealed that set2 acts downstream of bam .
furthermore , orb expression , which is required for germ cell differentiation , was activated by set2 , probably through direct h3k36me3 modification of the orb locus .
our data indicate that h3k36me3 - mediated epigenetic regulation is activated by bam , and that this modification facilitates germ cell differentiation , probably through transcriptional activation .
this work provides a novel link between bam and epigenetic transcriptional control .
drosophila germ cell differentiation factor histone modification transcriptional control introduction post - translational modifications to core histone proteins are proposed to regulate essential cellular functions , including transcriptional activation and repression .
for instance , histone h3 methylations at lysine 4 ( h3k4 ) and at lysine 36 ( h3k36 ) are usually associated with gene activation , whereas methylations of lysine 9 ( h3k9 ) and lysine 27 ( h3k27 ) are associated with gene repression .
several histone modifications play fundamental roles in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells , particularly with respect to their developmental potential ( bloushtain - qimron et al. , 2009 ; jiang et al. , 2011 ) ; histone modifications are also associated with the maintenance of stem cells in adult tissues ( buszczak et al. , 2009 ) .
in the adult drosophila ovary , the germline stem cells ( gscs ) at the tip of the germaria are maintained in their niche .
after gsc division , the daughter cell that is displaced from the niche becomes a cystoblast , and subsequently differentiates into a 16 - cell cyst interconnected by the branched fusome ; 1 germ cell develops into the oocyte and the other 15 germ cells form nurse cells .
the bone morphogenic protein ( bmp ) - like molecules produced from the niche maintain gscs by directly repressing bag - of - marbles ( bam ) , which encodes a key differentiation factor ( ohlstein and mckearin , 1997 ; chen and mckearin , 2003b ) .
when a cystoblast exits the niche , the bam produced in the cystoblast antagonizes the nanos / pumilio translational repressor complex to promote differentiation ( li et al. , 2009 ) .
in addition to bmp signalling , epigenetic silencing is essential for gsc maintenance .
the functions of scrawny and eggless , both of which encode histone - modifying enzymes that are associated with gene silencing , are required for gsc maintenance ( buszczak et al. , 2009 ; wang et al. , 2011 ) .
however , the mechanisms by which epigenetic regulation promotes differentiation , and by which bam counteracts gene silencing remain unclear .
we found that the levels of trimethylation of h3k36 ( h3k36me3 ) in cystoblasts were enhanced by set2 methyltransferase .
set2 acted downstream of bam and promoted differentiation .
furthermore , set2 activated orb expression , which is required for cyst differentiation .
our results indicate that h3k36me3 in cystoblasts is developmentally controlled by bam , and that this modification facilitates cystoblast differentiation , probably through transcriptional activation .

results and discussion h3k36me3 is associated with cystoblast differentiation to examine histone modifications in differentiating germ cells , we stained wild - type ovaries using monoclonal antibodies specific for histone modifications ( fig. 1 ; kimura et al. , 2008 ) .
we found that the h3k36me3 histone modification associated with active genes accumulated in differentiating cystoblasts ( fig. 1f,g ) .
h3k36me3 signals were increased in the differentiating cystoblasts that expressed the bam reporter gene ( bam - gfp ; chen and mckearin , 2003a ) ( fig. 1h ). by contrast , the h3k27me3 modification associated with gene repression accumulated in early germ cells , and its signals decreased as the cells differentiated ( fig. 1e,i ) .
these results suggest that the h3k36me3 levels were upregulated in differentiating cystoblasts .
next , we examined h3k36me3 levels in the ovaries of the third instar larvae and bam86 mutant adult females , both of which contain undifferentiated germ cells .
although h3k27me3 signals were detected in these undifferentiated germ cells , we did not detect strong h3k36me3 signals ( fig. 1j - m ) .
taken together , these data supported the idea that h3k36me3 - mediated epigenetic regulation may be involved in germ cell differentiation. fig. 1. h3k36me3 is upregulated in differentiating cystoblasts .

( l,m ) bam86mutant ovarioles were double - stained for h3k27me3 ( l , magenta ) or h3k36me3 ( m , magenta ) and vas ( green ) .
set2 is required for both h3k36me3 accumulation and cyst formation set2 methyltransferase is responsible for the h3k36me3 modification ( larschan et al. , 2007 ; stabell et al. , 2007 ) .
immunostaining revealed that , in the germarium region , set2 was expressed in most of the germline cells , and that nuclear set2 levels increased in differentiating cystoblasts ( fig. 2a ) .
to determine whether set2 participates in h3k36me3 accumulation and differentiation , we inhibited set2 expression by using an uas - set2.ir line ( stabell et al. , 2007 ) .
set2 levels in germ cells were reduced by the expression of set2 rnai ( supplementary material fig. s1 ) .
specifically , while set2 signals in differentiating cystoblasts were detected in 100 % of control ( nanos - gal4 /+) germaria ( n = 97 ) , the set2 signals in the cystoblasts were significantly reduced in 57 % of the germaria , when set2 rnai was expressed in germ cells under the control of the nanos - gal4 driver ( n = 170 ; supplementary material fig. s1 ) .
next , we investigated h3k36me3 levels in the ovaries expressing set2 rnai .
as expected , h3k36me3 levels were reduced as a consequence of set2 rnai treatment .
in control ovaries , h3k36me3 signals in differentiating cystoblasts were detected in 97 % of germaria ( fig. 2b ; n = 30 ). by contrast , when set2 rnai was expressed in germ cells under the control of the nanos - gal4 driver , h3k36me3 signals in cystoblasts were severely reduced in 41 % of the germaria ( fig. 2c ; n = 39 , p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , germ cell differentiation was impaired because of the expression of set2 rnai .
in 96 % of the control germaria , cysts with branched fusomes were observed ( fig. 2d ; n = 47 ) .
however , fragmented fusomes were detected in 34 % of the germaria expressing set2 rnai ( fig. 2e ; n = 67 ; p < 0.001 ) .
these results indicate that set2 was required for both h3k36me3 accumulation and cyst formation .
we next performed mosaic analysis by using a set2 null allele set21 ( larschan et al. , 2007 ) .
strong h3k36me3 signals were observed in 80 % of the control germline clones ( fig. 2f ; n = 30 ). by contrast , h3k36me3 levels were considerably reduced in 74 % of the set2 - cystoblasts ( fig. 2g ; n = 38 ) .
furthermore , we observed a differentiation defect similar to that induced by set2 rnai treatment in 84 % of set2 - mutant cysts ( fig. 2h ; n = 37 ) .
these results suggest that set2 is intrinsically required both for h3k36me3 accumulation in cystoblasts and for differentiation. fig. 2. set2 is required for h3k36me3 accumulation and cyst formation .

set2 acts downstream of bam to investigate the potential regulatory link between set2 and bam , we analyzed their genetic interaction .
reduction in set2 activity by introduction of a single copy of set21 dominantly increased the number of germaria with the differentiation defect in bam86 /+ flies ( fig. 3a - c ) .
fragmented fusomes were observed in 26 % of germaria from the set21 /+ ; bam86 /+ females ( n = 125 ) , as compared to 5 % in bam86 /+ ( n = 77 ) and 3 % in set21 /+ ( n = 68 ) females .
these results indicated that set2 cooperates with bam to promote cyst formation .
to determine whether bam expression requires set2 activity , we examined bam expression in set2 - germline clones by immunostaining .
indeed , set2 activity in germ cells was dispensable for bam expression ( supplementary material fig. s2 ) .
conversely , nuclear set2 expression in the germ cells was significantly reduced by bam mutation , suggesting that bam is involved in the regulation of set2 in these cells ( fig. 3d,e ) .
this result is consistent with the observation that h3k36me3 levels were reduced by bam mutation .
moreover , reducing of bam activity by introducing of a single copy of bam86 dominantly increased the number of germaria with weaker h3k36me3 signals in set21 /+ flies .
decreased h3k36me3 signals in the cystoblasts were observed in 29 % of germaria from the set21 /+ ; bam86 /+ females ( n = 157 ) , as compared to 3 % in set21 /+ ( n = 117 ) and 2 % in bam86 /+ ( n = 134 ) females ( supplementary material fig. s3 ) .
these data prompted us to explore the mechanism of regulation of set2 activity by bam. fig. 3. set2 genetically interacts with bam .
( a - c ) ovarioles from bam86 /+( a ) , set21 /+ ( b ) and set21 /+ ; bam86 /+ ( c ) were double - stained for 1b1 ( magenta ) and vas ( green ) .

( h ' , i ') 1b1 channel is shown separately .
while a cyst occupies the niche in the ovariole expressing hs - bam ( h , arrow ) , a gsc is found in the ovariole expressing both hs - bam and set2 rnai ( i , arrowhead ) .
( j ) the gsc loss of phenotype induced by bam is suppressed by set2 rnai .
data represent the mean +/ - s.d .
* p < 0.02 .
to address whether bam is sufficient for h3k36me3 accumulation , we examined h3k36me3 levels in the ovaries carrying the hs - bam transgene , which is used to ectopically express bam + by heat shock treatment ( ohlstein and mckearin , 1997 ) .
no gscs with a strong h3k36me3 signal were observed in germaria from wild - type females 1 hour post - heat shock ( phs ; n = 42 ) .
however , h3k36me3 levels in the gscs were significantly increased in 51 % of the germaria from hs - bam females 1 hour phs ( fig. 3f,g ; n = 65 ) , indicating that ectopic bam expression is sufficient for h3k36me3 accumulation .
because set2 is responsible for h3k36me3 , we speculated that bam may regulate set2 activity to control h3k36me3 accumulation and gsc differentiation .
to determine whether set2 activity is required for these bam - mediated processes , we examined the effect of a reduction in set2 activity on the gsc differentiation induced by bam .
when bam + was ectopically expressed by heat shock , gsc differentiation was induced as previously reported ( ohlstein and mckearin , 1997 ) .
in 71 % of ovaries from hs - bam flies dissected 24 hours phs , we found that differentiating cysts , instead of gscs , occupied the tip of germaria ( n = 79 ; fig. 3h ). by contrast , when both bam and set2 rnai were ectopically expressed , gsc loss was significantly suppressed ( 19.6 % , n = 189 ; p < 0.02 ) ( fig. 3i,j ) .
these data suggest that set2 activity is regulated by bam , and that set2 acts downstream of bam and promotes differentiation .
we found that nuclear set2 levels were increased in differentiating cystoblasts ( fig. 2a ) .
furthermore , nuclear set2 levels in germ cells were reduced by bam mutation ( fig. 3e ) .
we speculated that bam may regulate set2 nuclear localization .
therefore , we examined whether bam expression is sufficient for set2 nuclear accumulation .
we investigated the subcellular localization of set2 in hs - bam flies cultured at 30degreesc ( see materials and methods ) .
first , we examined h3k36me3 levels in the gscs .
h3k36me3 levels in gscs were increased in 36 % of the germaria from the hs - bam females ( n = 84 ) , as compared to 6 % in wild - type females ( n = 79 , p < 0.01 ; supplementary material fig. s4a,b ) .
this result suggests that the ectopic expression of bam is sufficient for h3k36me3 accumulation .
next , we investigated set2 subcellular localization in gscs of hs - bam females cultured at 30degreesc .
nuclear set2 levels in gscs were increased in 54 % of the germaria from the hs - bam females ( n = 65 ) , as compared to 12 % in wild - type females ( n = 79 , p < 0.01 ; supplementary material fig. s4c,d ) .
these results suggest that bam promotes the nuclear accumulation of set2 .
set2 function is required for the proper activation of orb expression in cysts to understand the mechanism by which set2 regulates germ cell differentiation , we analyzed the genetic interaction between set2 and the differentiation genes a2bp1 and orb , both of which are required for cyst differentiation ( lantz et al. , 1994 ; tastan et al. , 2010 ) .
reduction of set2 activity by introduction of a single dose of set21 dominantly increased the number of germaria exhibiting a differentiation defect in orbdec /+ flies ( fig. 4a - c ) .
in 24 % of germaria from the set21 /+ ; orbdec /+ females , fragmented fusomes were observed ( n = 132 ) , as compared with 4 % in orbdec /+ ( n = 73 ) and 7 % in set21 /+ females ( n = 106 ). by contrast , the reduction of set2 activity did not significantly affect cyst formation in a2bp1kg06463 /+ ovaries ( data not shown ) .
these results implied that set2 function is required to specifically regulate orb expression and promote cyst formation .
to confirm this , we examined orb expression in set2 - cyst clones .
deletion of set2 led to the delayed activation of orb .
although 74 % of the control cyst clones located at the boundary of germarium regions 1 and 2a initiated orb expression ( n = 50 ) , only 31 % of set2 - cyst clones expressed orb ( fig. 4d,e ; n = 62 , p < 0.001 ) .
most ( 61 %) of the set2 - cyst clones in germarium region 2b recovered orb expression ( n = 62 ) .
these observations suggest that set2 was required for the proper activation of orb in differentiating cysts .
next , we investigated the h3k36me3 state of the orb locus in the ovaries .
chip assays demonstrated that the h3k36me3 enrichment in the 3 ' - utr region of orb was significantly higher than in the 5 ' - utr region ( fig. 5b - d ) .
it has been reported that the h3k36me3 modification exhibits a 3 ' - bias , such that h3k36me3 is preferentially enriched at the 3 ' regions of actively transcribed genes ( larschan et al. , 2007 ; barski et al. , 2007 ) .
our results support the idea that orb expression in differentiating cysts is controlled in part by h3k36me3 - mediated epigenetic regulation. fig. 4. set2 is required for the proper activation of orb expression in cysts .
( a - c ) ovarioles from orbdec /+ ( a ) , set21 /+ ( b ) and set21 /+ ; orbdec /+ ( c ) were double - stained for 1b1 ( magenta ) and vas ( green ) .

data represent the mean +/ - s.d. the significance was calculated by comparing the values detected at the 5 ' - or 3 ' - utrs (* p < 0.05 ; analysis of variance ) .

ovaries dissected from wild - type and bam86 mutant flies were used for the chip assay .
the values are expressed as a fold increase relative to the igg control .
the significance was calculated by comparing the values obtained using wild - type and bam mutant ovaries (* p < 0.05 ; analysis of variance ) .
all chip assays were performed in 3 biological replicates .
next , we investigated the h3k36me3 status in the orb gene in bam86 mutant ovaries .
chip assays showed that bam mutation reduced the amount of h3k36me3 in the 3 ' - utr region of the orb gene ( fig. 5d ) .
the h3k36me3 modification is linked to transcriptional elongation ( krogan et al. , 2003 ) .
therefore , our results suggested that bam activates orb expression through the epigenetic control .
additionally , h3k4me3 and rna polymerase ii levels in the 5 ' - utr region of the orb gene were also reduced by bam mutation ( fig. 5d ) , implying a role for bam in transcriptional initiation .
to investigate this possibility , further investigation will be needed in order to identify the enzymes responsible for h3k4me3 and exploring the interactions between bam and those enzymes .
our results showed that h3k36me3 levels are regulated by bam .
as a cytoplasmic protein , bam may indirectly regulate set2 nuclear localization .
set2 exerts its functions through the interactions with cofactors ( fuchs et al. , 2012 ) .
understanding the mechanism by which bam regulates set2 will require the identification of the cofactors that mediate the nuclear transport of set2 .
our data suggest a link between bam and epigenetic transcriptional control .
bam may counteract epigenetic silencing in gscs through h3k36me3 - mediated epigenetic regulation .
we show that orb expression is activated by epigenetic regulation .
because orb encodes a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element - binding protein , orb may control translation in differentiating cysts in a polyadenylation - associated manner .
bam antagonizes the nanos / pumilio complex , which suppresses the translation of target mrnas that encode differentiation factors ( li et al. , 2009 ) .
however , the identity of the target mrnas and the mechanisms for transcriptional activation have not yet been elucidated .
because set2 is required for bam - induced gsc differentiation , studies focused on identifying the genes marked by h3k36me3 and on their epigenetic regulation will aid in the identification of the differentiation genes .
because set2 is linked to transcriptional elongation ( krogan et al. , 2003 ) , differentiation genes in gscs might be poised for expression , but may be kept awaiting bam expression for full activation .
we anticipate that our results will facilitate a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gametogenesis .

a 62 - year - old female presented with numerous soft tissue lesions of her scalp and bilateral preauricular region .
several of these have been biopsied or removed with a diagnosis of cylindromas .
cylindromas are benign tumors with a differentiation towards apocrine sweat glands that increase in number and size throughout life .
multiple scalp cylindromas may coalesce and cover the entire scalp , resulting in the " turban tumor. " these are often associated with the autosomal dominant brooke - spiegler syndrome with coexistent facial trichoepitheliomas and spiradenomas .
there is a very rare association between cylindromas and basal cell adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the parotid gland , with only 17 reported cases .
ours is the first ct demonstration of both the scalp and parotid gland findings in this uncommon situation .
1. introduction cylindromas are benign tumors histologically similar to sweat glands .
multiple scalp cylindromas may coalesce to cover the entire scalp , resulting in the so - called " turban tumor. " multiple scalp cylindromas are often associated with brooke - spiegler syndrome .
there is a rare association between cylindromas and basal cell adenoma as well as adenocarcinoma of the parotid gland .
this is the first case to demonstrate the ct appearance of both the scalp and parotid gland findings in this uncommon syndrome .
2. case report a 62 - year - old female presented with a long history of numerous soft tissue lesions bulging from her scalp as well as her preauricular ( parotid ) region .
these were noted to range in size from 2 mm to 2 cm diameter ( figures 1 - 6 ) .
multiple similar appearing facial lesions were also noted .
several of these lesions have been biopsied or removed in the past .
unfortunately , many have continued to grow and many have recurred .
3. discussion cylindromas are benign tumors that histologically demonstrate a differentiation towards apocrine sweat glands .
they usually begin to appear in the second or third decades and tend to gradually increase in number and size throughout life [ 1 , 2 ] .
multiple scalp cylindromas may coalesce and cover the entire scalp , resulting in the so - called " turban tumor. " these are typically associated with hair loss .
the presence of multiple scalp cylindromas is often associated with the autosomal dominant brooke - spiegler syndrome , a condition in which there are coexistent facial trichoepitheliomas and spiradenomas [ 3 ] .
this syndrome is caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor cyld gene localized to chromosome 16q [ 1 , 3 ] .
brooke - spiegler syndrome tends to affect women more frequently than men .
although usually benign , rare transformation of cylindromas to malignant cylindrocarcinomas has been described .
there is a very rare association between cylindromas and basal cell adenoma as well as adenocarcinoma of the parotid gland .
however , only 17 such cases have been reported [ 4 ] .
ours is the 18th and represents the first case to demonstrate the ct appearance of both the scalp and parotid gland findings in this uncommon syndrome .

objectives although a number of population - based studies have examined the characteristics of teens who attempt to quit smoking , few have identified the characteristics of youth who participate in structured cessation interventions , particularly those with demonstrated effectiveness .
the purpose of the present study is to describe the sociodemographic and smoking - related characteristics of teen smokers who participated in the american lung association 's not on tobacco ( n - o - t ) program , spanning eight years .
n - o - t is the most widely used teen smoking cessation program in the nation .
methods drawn from multiple statewide n - o - t studies , this investigation examined data from 5,892 teen smokers ages 14 - 19 who enrolled in n - o - t between 1998 - 2006 .
we demonstrate similarities and differences between n - o - t findings and existing data from representative samples of us teen smokers where available and relevant .
results n - o - t teens started smoking earlier , were more likely to be poly - tobacco users , were more dependent on nicotine , had made more previous attempts to quit , and were more deeply embedded in smoking contexts than comparative samples of teen smokers .
additionally , n - o - t teens were moderately ready to quit smoking , believed important people in their lives would support their quit efforts , yet had deficits in their confidence with quitting .
conclusion this profile of n - o - t teens can guide efforts for targeted recruitment strategies to enhance intervention reach for teen smoking cessation .
findings provide guidance for marketing and recruitment efforts of intensive , school - based cessation interventions among established teen smokers , particularly those who want to quit .
study results may shed light upon who is and is not enrolling in n - o - t. background nearly one quarter of us high school teens currently smoke [ 1 ] and most will become adult smokers .
the health and economic burden of smoking is staggering .
over 6.4 million of today 's current teen smokers will eventually die of smoking - related diseases. between 1995 and 1999 , smoking was responsible for over 440,000 us deaths per year and cost the nation over $ 150 billion in annual health - related economic losses. of these economic losses , $ 81.9 billion were related to mortality - related productivity [ 2 ]. with almost 4,000 new youth initiating smoking each day , there is an unequivocal need for medical and public health communities to identify and disseminate evidence - based interventions targeted to teens who smoke and who are motivated to quit .
research has shown that the majority of adolescent smokers want to quit ,[ 1,3 ] but most spontaneous attempts end in failure [ 3 ] .
some teen smokers have both access to , and the willingness to join , a teen cessation program .
however , many teens who may benefit from these programs are unaware that the programs exist .
this begs the question : how can we increase teens' utilization of effective smoking cessation programs ?
although some research studies relate indirectly to this question , many critical factors remain unaddressed .
for instance , numerous epidemiological studies have delineated the psychosocial predictors of smoking cessation among youth and young adults [ 4 - 6 ] .
to date , these types of population - based studies have not examined the characteristics of teens who specifically attempt quitting through structured cessation interventions .
in addition , teen smoking cessation investigations have focused primarily on efficacy [ 5,6 ] , leaving unanswered questions regarding intervention reach , access , and utilization .
an initial step to increasing utilization of effective interventions is to determine the profile of teen consumers of those interventions .
clearly , numerous factors could comprise a composite profile of teen smokers .
however , it is important that descriptive studies examine factors demonstrated as related to teen smoking behavior .
as supported in the literature , some of these factors include ( 1 ) demographic factors such as age , race , gender , and socioeconomic status [ 7 - 9 ] ; ( 2 ) smoking history and current smoking patterns [ 9 - 11 ] , such as weekday and weekend cigarette consumption [ 11 - 15 ] ; and ( 3 ) readiness to quit smoking [ 5,9,16 - 18 ] .
a profile of current teen smokers willing to join accessible and proven cessation interventions may provide crucial information for the development and evaluation of recruitment strategies .
effective recruitment will increase intervention reach .
an extensive literature review revealed only two studies that specifically explored the characteristics of teens who participate in tobacco cessation interventions .
one intervention study was part of the two - phased helping young smokers quit ( hysq ) initiative [ 18 ] .
phase ii of this initiative , includes a longitudinal evaluation of 42 promising programs and the youth who participate in them .
the analytic goal of the hysq multilevel investigation is to uncover relationships between " aggregated program attributes and youth participant outcomes. " the hysq study findings may provide information on programs with varying degrees of effectiveness and dissemination potential .
in fact , initial results indicated that the majority of participants did not change their smoking patterns , suggesting limited intervention efficacy when participant data across all cessation programs were collapsed .
unfortunately , the heterogeneity of programs included in that study makes it highly unlikely that any definitive conclusions can be made regarding the users of particular types of programs or interventions , most notably , those with previously established effectiveness .
the other study , reported by barker and colleagues ,[ 19 ] presents key findings from the national youth smoking cessation survey ( nyscs ) , which is a two - year longitudinal epidemiologic study of lifetime use of smoking cessation methods among teen and young adult smokers 16 to 24 years .
this study included a random sample of 2,582 youth and young adult smokers who had tried to quit .
respondents answered questions about cessation methods , including knowledge , perceived availability , and use of assisted and unassisted quitting methods .
the authors reported that adolescent and young adult smokers who tried quitting were more likely to use unassisted quitting methods than assisted quitting methods .
differences in utilization of cessation methods by gender were also noted where females were more likely to seek help from health professionals , quit with a friend , and use self - help cessation materials , but were less likely to use nicotine gum .
males were more likely to exercise or switch to smokeless tobacco or other tobacco products as cessation strategies .
while this study provides descriptive findings related to utilization of cessation methods among a nationally representative random sample of youth and young adult smokers , it does not provide detailed information with respect to a single smoking cessation program targeted to reach established but motivated adolescent smokers .
the present investigation provides a focused exploration of years of data from a single , evidence - based teen smoking cessation program delivered to diverse youth in a variety of settings .
the findings of this study compliment both the hysq and nyscs studies and enhance the knowledge about how to increase consumer ( i.e. , teen ) demand for evidence - based teen cessation services .
to address this current research gap in teen smoking cessation , the present study generated a profile of baseline characteristics from seven years of research on the american lung association 's not - on - tobacco ( n - o - t ) program .
n - o - t is a 10 - session theory - based program delivered by trained facilitators [ 4,20,21 ] .
n - o - t was developed specifically for adolescents , with program content and methods geared toward relevant developmental issues ( e.g. , coping skills , decision making , autonomy , peer pressure , and so on ) .
n - o - t sessions cover topics such as the following : myths and realities about smoking ; understanding addiction ; health and social impacts of smoking on mind and body ; sharing the quitting experience ; avoiding risky situations and relapse ; stress management ; handling pressure from friends and family ; understanding tobacco advertising ; and staying committed to quitting .
effectiveness studies on the n - o - t program reveal end - of - program intent - to - treat quit rates between 15 % and 19 % for 1998 - 2003 [ 20 ] .
these rates are among the highest quit rates reported in the literature .
the state - of - the - art in teen smoking cessation shows that a handful of programs or strategies demonstrate meaningful results [ 14,18,22 ] .
a systematic review of two and a half decades of youth tobacco - use cessation found an average quit rate of 14 %[ 14 ] .
only two programs receive praise as evidence - based programs : n - o - t and project ex [ 14,18,22 ] .
n - o - t 's success has resulted in federal recognition as a substance abuse and mental health administration ( samhsa ) evidence - based model program , a national cancer institute ( nci ) research tested intervention program , and an office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention ( ojjdp ) model program .
moreover , a cost - effectiveness analysis comparing n - o - t to a minimal - contact brief intervention indicated that n - o - t is a highly cost effective option for school - based tobacco intervention [ 21 ] .
importantly , n - o - t has been disseminated in 48 states , is currently the most widely used smoking cessation program in the nation , and has been rigorously assessed for adoptability .
in fact , a recent survey of youth smoking cessation programs found n - o - t to be the most widely used intervention in the nation [ 18 ] .
the study purpose is to identify the sociodemographic and smoking - related characteristics of teen smokers who participated in the n - o - t program .
findings will help elucidate the profile of young smokers that have participated in n - o - t and inform the literature concerning characteristics related to young smokers' utilization of school - based smoking cessation programs methods participants data for the present analysis were taken from a five - state sample of teen smokers ( n = 6,635 ) who voluntarily participated in either matched - design or field studies of the n - o - t program between 1998 and 2006 [ 20 ] .
as a part of larger statewide n - o - t evaluation studies , participants represented youth from fl , nc , nj , wi , and wv. researchers collected participant data prior to the onset of intervention , across all evaluations .
because n - o - t is designed for regular smokers , likely to be addicted , eligible participants had to smoke >= 5 cigarettes per day .
they also had to be enrolled at the school sites .
the n - o - t program is designed for 14 - to 19 - year - old regular smokers ; therefore , analyses included only participants within that age range .
given these criteria , the final overall sample included 5,892 teens .
importantly , not all study instruments were administered in all studies ; therefore , the sample size analyzed in the present study varied depending on the questionnaire ( s ) or variables being examined .
all study procedures received institutional review board approval .
data sources we identified 24 baseline variables consistently demonstrated in the literature as significantly related to teen smoking to assure that relevant characteristics were assessed ( refer to table 1 ) .
specifically , we assessed variables related to basic demographics ,[ 5,11,13,23 ] smoking history ,[ 3,5,13,14 ] and intervention readiness [ 15,23 - 25 ] .
table 1 indicates the data sources and response options used for the selected variables .
two study variables warrant additional details beyond what is provided in table 1 - " nicotine dependence " and " stages of change. " the study assessed nicotine dependence using the widely accepted fagerstrom tolerance questionnaire ( ftq )[ 26 ] .
throughout the years , ftq developers made various modifications to adapt its use for teens , validating the ftq and utilizing it to measure nicotine dependence among adolescent smokers .
thus , over time , our n - o - t studies used two different versions of the ftq instrument .
the first version was the original eight - item questionnaire developed by fagerstrom , with a score range of 0 - 11 [ 24,26 ] .
the second version was a seven - item revision of the original ftq [ 24,25 ] specifically developed for teens ; with a score range of 0 - 9 .
the modified ftq eliminated one item related to cigarette brand .
both instruments rendered a sum score of nicotine dependence ranging from no dependence to high dependence .
to assure that our data were uniform for analyses , we collapsed data from both versions of the instrument into three levels of nicotine dependence ( low , moderate , and high ) .
we then merged all data into these appropriate standardized subgroups .
consistent with ftq scoring recommendations , scores were 0 - 2 ( low dependence or no dependence ) , 3 - 5 ( moderate dependence ) , and 6 or higher ( high dependence ) .

these factors included motivation to quit , confidence to quit , and stages of change ( refer to table 1 ) .
it is essential to explore readiness because smoking cessation interventions are less likely to achieve success with smokers who are not ready to quit [ 28 ] .
we used stages of change [ 25 ] as part of the readiness construct rather than a stand alone measure of readiness , as is often used .
as previously noted , research shows that many variables influence readiness .
readiness is not a linear process and may involve fluid movement in and out of certain stages at various points in time [ 25 ] .
our construct reflected participants' state of readiness at baseline , a fixed point in time .
our stages of change variable included response options suggested by prochaska and colleagues in the transtheoretical model [ 25 ] .
the five stages of change were precontemplation , contemplation , preparation , action , and maintenance ( scaled from 1 - 5 , respectively ) .
the study defined precontemplation as " do not plan to quit in next 6 months " ; contemplation as " plan to quit in next 6 months " ; preparation as " plan to quit in next 30 days " ; action as " made a serious quit attempt in past 6 months " ; and maintenance as " quit less than 6 months ago. " the transtheoretical model posits that successful behavior change requires moving through these five stages .
analyses as shown in table 1 , we grouped the 24 baseline variables into three different categories : basic demographics , which included age , gender , grade , and living arrangements ; smoking history , including age of trying first cigarette , other tobacco use , number of cigarettes smoked per day on weekdays and weekends , nicotine dependence level , previous quit attempts , and smoking status of parents and friends ; and intervention readiness , which included smoking - related psychosocial variables such as motivation and confidence to quit , and stages of change .
the variable values are shown in table 1 .
we conducted frequency analyses for all variables , and mean values were calculated , as appropriate .
because some research shows that the stages of change construct alone does not capture the full state of readiness ,[ 29 - 32 ] for some analyses , we collapsed our readiness factors to form an aggregate readiness to quit smoking score .
using the values shown in table 1 , the overall readiness score ranged between 3 and 15 .
in addition to basic descriptive statistics , the present study utilized pearson 's product moment and point - biserial correlations and multiple linear regression with backward elimination .
given the multiple comparisons and analyses made in the present study , we controlled for type i error using a method called the false discovery rate ( fdr ) .
in contrast to methods that are designed to control for any false positive ( e.g. , bonferroni methods ) , the fdr method controls for the proportion of false positive that could be expected given the total number of tests .
the fdr method has the advantage of increased power , efficiency , and less risk of type ii errors than bonferroni procedure .
fdr values can be interpreted as the confidence in that prediction ; for example , a fdr value of . 20 would suggest that no more of 20 % of the findings are erroneous .
whereas no standard has been set for a cut - off for " acceptable " fdr levels , we have used a conservative level of . 05 .
for ease of presentation , all results presented as significant at a level of p < . 05 were found to have fdr values < . 05 .
cases where p values of < . 05 had fdr values greater than . 05 are specifically noted .
results basic demographics among all participants , there were more females than males ; the mean age was 16 ( sd = 1.15 ) , and grades 9 - 12 were almost equally represented .
almost half ( 43.90 %) of the teens lived with both biological parents .
a majority of teens were white ( 74.75 %) .

in the past 30 days ( current use ) , only 12.65 % had also used smokeless tobacco , but 44.75 % had smoked cigars .
very few teens ( 5.26 %) had ever used any type of nicotine replacement .
among all youth , most ( 78.18 %) previously made at least one attempt to quit smoking cigarettes , despite unfavorable smoking environments where 65.27 % of parents , 55.19 % of siblings , and 93.46 % of close friends were smokers .
our study showed that youth smoked more than half a pack of cigarettes ( mean = 12.03 , sd = 10.45 ) per day on weekdays and almost one pack ( mean = 18.29 , sd = 12.68 ) per day on weekends , upon program enrollment .
participants had moderate to high ftq nicotine dependence scores .
specifically , scores were 0 - 2 ( low dependence or no dependence , 10.98 %) , 3 - 5 ( moderate dependence , 30.03 %) , and 6 or higher ( high dependence , 58.99 %) .

correlations among basic demographics , smoking history , and intervention readiness we examined relationships across variables , with the assumption that certain demographic and smoking history variables would be related to intervention readiness .
none of the basic demographic factors were related to intervention readiness .
among the smoking history variables , only amount of smoking was significantly related to overall readiness ( i.e. , the aggregate readiness score ) .
specifically , pearson 's correlation showed that the higher the number of cigarettes smoked per day on weekdays and weekend days , the lower the readiness scores ( weekday : r ( 266 ) = - 0.19 , p = 0.01 ; weekend : r ( 267 ) = - 0.20 , p < 0.001 ) .
although not related to readiness , there were other pearson correlations worthy of discussion .
analysis showed positive associations between number of cigarettes smoked per weekday , weekend day and level of nicotine dependence ( weekdays : r ( 669 ) = 0.47 , p < 0.001 ; weekends : r ( 669 ) = 0.47 , p < 0.001 ) and a negative correlation with age of first try ( weekdays : r ( 5750 ) = - 0.15 , p < 0.001 ; weekends : r ( 5726 ) = - 0.17 , p < 0.001 ) .
age of first try was negatively correlated with both nicotine dependence ( r ( 654 ) = - 0.11 , p = 0.004 ) , and parent smoking status ( r ( 2251 ) = - 0.16 , p < 0.001 ) .
next , motivation to quit was positively correlated with confidence to quit ( r ( 949 ) = 0.54 , p < 0.001 ) .
finally , the more support teens perceived from parents , siblings , and close friends , the higher was their motivation to quit ( parental support : r ( 423 ) = 0.13 , p = 0.01 ; sibling support : r ( 380 ) = 0.11 , p = 0.02 ; friend support : r ( 425 ) = 0.20 , p < 0.001 ) and was their confidence to quit ( parental support : r ( 423 ) = 0.10 , p = 0.039 ; sibling support : r ( 380 ) = 0.10 , p = 0.04 ; friend support : r ( 425 ) = 0.13 , p = 0.08 ) .
explanation of variance in smoking variables and intervention readiness to understand the relation between variables , we conducted multiple linear regression analyses with backward elimination .
this method begins with a saturated model with all relevant predictors entered simultaneously .
next , each predictor is evaluated , one at a time , for the reduction of the overall model r2 that would result from that variable 's deletion from the model .
variables removed resulting in an insignificant reduction in r2 are then deleted .
a final model results when no further predictor variable can be deleted from the model .
for these regression analyses , we entered the demographic , smoking history , and intervention readiness variables into the model as predictors .
for the purposes of the regression analyses , categorical variables ( race , living arrangement ) were dummy coded and each variable was entered separately .
additionally , to examine the potential influence of the state in which the participants lived , we dummy coded state ( nj , wv , nc , wi , fl ) and included the resulting variables in the analysis .
this resulted in a total of 32 predictor variables .
a power analysis demonstrated that the current sample size ( n = 5,892 ) was sufficient to detect a very small effect size ( f2 = . 01 ) with power of . 99 , alpha = . 01 with 32 predictors in the model .
weekday smoking frequency for the initial model , weekday smoking was removed from the list of predictor variables and added as the dependent variable .
the overall initial model was significant , f ( 28 , 144 ) = 7.57 , p < . 001 , and accounted for over half the variance in weekday smoking , adjusted r2 = . 52 .
likewise , the final model was significant , f ( 6 , 166 ) = 36.66 , p < . 001 and explained over half the variance in weekday smoking , adjusted r2 = . 55 .
the final model eliminated 25 of the initial predictor variables , with only the race (" other race " dummy - coded variable ; p = . 008 ) , gender ( p = . 001 ) , use of cigars ( p = . 02 ) , previous quit attempts ( p = . 03 ) , number of cigarettes smoked on weekends ( p < . 001 ) and nicotine dependence ( p = . 001 ) remaining as significantly associated with weekday smoking .
in the final model , " other " race , male gender , nicotine dependence level , having had a previous quit attempt , use of cigars and number of cigarettes smoked on weekends were all associated with an increase in weekday smoking .
weekend smoking frequency similar to the previous model , the initial model examining weekend smoking as the dependent variable was significant , f ( 28 , 144 ) = 7.11 , p < . 001 , and accounted for half the variance in weekend smoking , adjusted r2 = . 50 .
the final model was also significant , f ( 7 , 165 ) = 28.45 , p < . 001 , and accounted for just over half the variance in weekend smoking , adjusted r2 = . 53 .
the final model eliminated 24 of the initial predictor variables leaving race (" other race " dummy - coded variable ; p = . 45 ) , living with mother and step father ( p = . 05 ) , gender ( p = . 59 ) , age of first tobacco use ( p = . 014 ) , use of cigars ( p = . 005 ) , weekday cigarette use ( p < . 001 ) , and level of nicotine dependence ( p = . 016 ) .
in the final model , younger age of first tobacco use , cigar use , number of cigarettes smoked on weekdays and nicotine dependence were all associated with an increase in weekend cigarette smoking .
in contrast to weekday smoking , the " other " race category was associated with less weekend smoking .
level of nicotine dependence again , the initial model examining nicotine dependence as the dependent variable was significant , f ( 28 , 144 ) = 3.48 , p < . 001 , and accounted for just over one - quarter of the variance in nicotine dependence smoking , adjusted r2 = . 28 .
the final model was also significant , f ( 5 , 167 ) = 16.10 , p < . 001 , and accounted for nearly one - third of the variance in nicotine dependence smoking , adjusted r2 = . 31 .
a total of 26 of the initial predictor variables were eliminated in the final model leaving state ( florida ; p = . 001 ) , race (" caucasian " dummy coded variable ; p = . 094 ) , living with father alone ( p = . 01 ) , weekday smoking ( p < . 001 ) , and weekend smoking ( p = . 032 ) .
the final model demonstrated that living with a father alone , and both weekday and weekend smoking frequency were related to nicotine dependence .
in addition , being from the state of florida was associated with lower levels of nicotine dependence .
motivation to quit both the initial model , f ( 28 , 144 ) = 4.06 , p < . 001 , and the final model , f ( 4 , 168 ) = 26.05 , p < . 001 , with motivation to quit as the dependent variable were significant .
additionally , both the initial model , adjusted r2 = . 34 , and the final model , adjusted r2 = . 38 , explained over a third of the variance in motivation to quit .
the final model eliminated 27 of the initial predictor variables , leaving in the final model age ( p = . 08 ) , confidence in quitting ( p < . 001 ) , stage of change , ( p = . 004 ) , and status of boy / girlfriend smoking ( p = . 002 ) .
the final model demonstrated that increased age , increased confidence and higher stages of change were associated with higher levels of motivation to quit .
having a boy or girlfriend who smokes was associated with less motivation to quit .
confidence in quitting the initial model with confidence in quitting as the dependant variable was significant , f ( 28 , 144 ) = 4.35 , p < . 001 and accounted for over a third of the variance , adjusted r2 = . 35 .
likewise , the final model was significant , f ( 9 , 163 ) = 12.61 , p < . 001 , and accounted for 38 % of the variance in confidence in quitting , adjusted r2 = . 38 .
see table y for results .
in the final model , 22 of the initial predictor variables were eliminated , leaving caucasian race ( p = . 05 ) , asian race , ( p = . 08 ) , hispanic race ( p = . 008 ) , living with mother and step father ( p = . 06 ) , living with other guardians ( p = . 04 ) , use of cigars ( p = . 07 ) , smoking status of boy / girlfriend ( p = . 002 ) , cigarettes smoked on weekends ( p = . 03 ) and motivation to quit ( p < . 001 ) .
in this model , hispanic race , use of cigars , number of cigarettes smoked on weekdays , and having a boy or girlfriend who smokes were all associated with less confidence in quitting .
living with a guardian other than parents / grandparents and higher levels of motivation to quit were associated with increased levels of confidence .
stage of change for the purposes of these analyses , stage of change was treated as a continuous variable , with higher scores indicating higher or more advanced " stages " of the change .
the initial model was significant , f ( 28 , 144 ) = 1.81 , p = . 013 and accounted for a quarter of the variance , adjusted r2 = . 25 .
the final model was also significant , f ( 5 , 167 ) = 8.28 , p < . 001 and accounted for 20 % of the variance , adjusted r2 = . 20 .
the final model eliminated 28 of the initial predictors leaving only living situation ( mother and stepfather ; p = . 09 ) , grade ( p = . 03 ) , previous quit attempts ( p = . 001 ) , and motivation to quit ( p < . 001 ) .
in the final model , higher grade , previous quit attempts and higher motivation to quit were associated with higher stages of change .
discussion our sample reflected a diverse group of teen smokers ; approximately 75 % were white , followed by 12 % hispanic .
the racial and ethnic percentages in our sample were equivalent to the sample of teen smokers surveyed by the hysq study [ 18,33 ] .
our sample initiated regular smoking at the age of 12 years .
for decades , the literature indicated an us average age of smoking onset between ages 15 and 16 [ 1,2 ] .
consistencies were found among the self reported data from teens regarding their smoking histories [ 34 ] .
our sample , similar to those found by hysq , reported smoking onset at least three years earlier .
given a participant mean age of 16 , seemingly these young intervention seekers had smoked for four to five years before they joined a cessation program .
we also found that the earlier a teen began smoking , the greater was his / her level of nicotine dependence .
as expected , frequency of weekday and weekend smoking also were highly correlated with dependence [ 35 ] .
the n - o - t teens were not experimental smokers - they were moderately to highly nicotine dependent .
this level of dependence contrasts with data from other findings in which nearly 80 % of teen smokers were classified as having low or very low levels of nicotine dependence as measured by the revised fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence [ 35 - 37 ] .
n - o - t is designed for regular smokers , likely to be addicted , which may account for this difference [ 38 ] .
importantly , this finding validates the enrollment of n - o - t 's intended population of addicted smokers , as indicated by teens' self - selection into the program .
additionally , approximately half of the sample consisted of poly - tobacco users at baseline ; cigars were the most frequently used secondary tobacco product , followed by smokeless tobacco .
our sample of teens were about 60 % more likely than other teens to use smokeless tobacco and over 200 % more likely to use cigars than other national samples of teen smokers [ 36,37 ] .
because n - o - t is designed for regular cigarette smokers , our studies did not enroll youth who used only smokeless , cigars , or any other form of tobacco. by design , participants must smoke cigarettes to be eligible for n - o - t. our sample of n - o - t teens smoked daily , consuming at least a pack per day on weekends and just over a half a pack a day monday through friday .
similar to other research , the regression analyses showed that being male with advanced smoking behaviors , including poly - tobacco use , high dependence , and previous quit attempts , were associated with the highest levels of weekday smoking [ 39,40 ] .
advanced smoking behaviors , regardless of gender , were associated with heavy weekend smoking .
we acknowledge a range of daily intake as suggested by the standard deviations reported in table 3 .
however , the point remains that n - o - t participants smoked daily , some more heavily than others did .
living with " father only " was also predictive of dependence levels .
perhaps this is the result of lower supervision and monitoring of adolescent behavior in father - only homes , or possible exposure to parental smoking if the father is a current or former smoker .
indeed , research has found that adolescents from father - only homes engage in more alcohol and drug behaviors , as well as engage in more delinquent behaviors than those from mother - only and intact families [ 41 - 45 ] .
high daily smoking rates among n - o - t teens also may explain higher nicotine dependence scores than found in previous teen studies .
other n - o - t studies have shown high dependence levels among participants [ 4,38 ] .
in contrast , the hysq study found that among all us teen smokers who enrolled in cessation programs , only about half reported smoking every day in the past 30 days [ 18 ] .
generally , this suggests that a high percentage of light or experimenting smokers participated in the hysq study .
comparisons reveal that upon enrollment , n - o - t teens smoke with greater intensity and frequency than the general group of intervention seekers in the hysq sample .
these teens may be more attracted to intensive programs , such as n - o - t , because they can clearly identify themselves as regular smokers with a significant enough habit to require intensive intervention .
as found in other n - o - t studies , few n - o - t teens in the current sample had ever used any type of nicotine replacement .
in fact , in our previous n - o - t studies , teens expressed a strong opposition for nicotine replacement [ 2,38 ] .
only 5 % of our n - o - t sample reported ever using any type of nicotine replacement .
in contrast , other studies have found higher usage of nicotine replacement among teen smokers [ 46 - 48 ] .
for example , a study of tennessee teens found that almost 17 % of daily smokers reported using nicotine replacement at least once [ 48 ] .
in hysq , 66 % of teens had used some method to help them quit smoking ; over 20 % of those teens reported using nicotine replacement [ 18 ] .
overall , our findings on smoking history suggest that n - o - t attracts teens who are heavy smokers , highly addicted , and who are less interested in pharmaco - intervention as an aid to smoking cessation .
it likely that other programs recruit or enroll light or experimenting smokers .
interestingly , a recent paper by backinger and colleagues [ 49 ] found that cessation program recruitment and retention were higher for youth who smoke > 6 cigarettes per day .
given that our sample had been smoking for several years , was smoking nearly a pack of cigarettes a day , and was at least moderately dependent on tobacco , it is no surprise that they were not novices at quit attempts .
prior to joining n - o - t , 78.18 % of our sample had made previous quit attempts .
previous studies have found that between approximately 27 % and 54 % of current teen smokers have made attempts to quit smoking [ 48,50 ] .
more participants reported their motivation to quit as high or very high as compared with their confidence to quit .
unsuccessful previous quit attempts may explain why teen have low confidence in their abilities to quit but remain motivated .
consistent with the voluntary nature of n - o - t , enrollees were moderately motivated and moderately confident regarding their capacity to quit smoking .
most planned to quit smoking in the next 1 - 6 months , the general timeframe of n - o - t participation .
being older , more confident , and in higher stages of change were associated with higher motivation to quit .
having a romantic boy / girlfriend who smokes was associated with less motivation and less confidence to quit .
other factors associated with low confidence were being hispanic , heavy weekday smoking , and cigar use .
similar to past research with teen smokers , the heavier smokers were more nicotine dependent [ 29 ] and less ready to quit smoking [ 30 ] .
teens in higher grades , with previous quit attempts , and higher motivation were the most likely sub - group to be in advanced stages of readiness .
heavy smokers may show lower readiness because they lack confidence in their ability to quit , suggesting that cessation programs should address confidence issues at program start up , especially among addicted , heavy smokers .
success with cessation can depend on the balance between a smoker 's readiness to stop smoking and his or her level of dependence on cigarettes .
almost all n - o - t teens had significant people in their social networks who smoke - namely , parents , siblings , friends , and boy / girlfriends .
most teens perceived that friends and family would support their efforts to quit smoking .
interestingly , our participants reported that parents were less likely to support quitting than were age - mates .
ample research has found that such environmental contexts are clearly related to ongoing smoking and failed cessation attempts [ 28 - 30 ] .
for example , age of first try was correlated with parent smoking status , suggesting that parent smoking increases the risk of early onset smoking among offspring .
a related finding showed positive relations between parent smoking and sibling smoking .
decades of research in developmental psychology and social learning show that familial influences are one of the primary predictors of youth health behavior , including smoking .
despite past research highlighting peer influences on youth smoking , recent research has focused on , and identified , strong associations among family and other environmental predictors and teen smoking [ 44 - 46 ] .
certainly , family influences on onset and readiness to quit smoking were evident in this study .
unfortunately , our sample appeared to be deeply immersed in a smoking culture , both at home and within their peer context ; they had more parents who smoke and more friends who smoke than most teen smokers .
these findings have important implications for program recruitment .
n - o - t teens may represent a group of " hard core " adolescent smokers who bring significant challenges to any cessation attempt .
thus , effective recruitment may require that potential n - o - t participants have face - to - face communication with facilitators and n - o - t " graduates. " this type of active recruitment may be important to convey up front how the program helps youth deal with these specific barriers to quitting , such as parents and friends who smoke , high levels of daily use and nicotine addiction , as well as low confidence in quitting .
what we learned about teens who participated in n - o - t also shed light on who is not participating , such as low dependent , low frequency smokers , and late starters .
more specifically , describing typical users of school - based smoking cessation programs can also help to identify groups of teens who are not utilizing services , as represented by the small percentage of adolescent and young adult smokers using assisted quitting methods in the nyscs [ 19 ] .
future studies should determine recruitment methods necessary to engage their participation and generate demand .
limitations caution is warranted in the application of findings nationally .
results may be most applicable to states or local areas with demographically similar populations and smoking characteristics as found in our sample .
another limitation may be in using descriptive data to generalize about n - o - t participant characteristics .
this study did not determine reasons for participation .
the field needs additional in - depth study to address motivation or reasons for program participation .
participation may be related to intrinsic motivation or it may also be related to the tobacco control environment at state and local levels .
conclusion a primary study objective was to present a profile of youth from across the us who voluntarily participated in the n - o - t program .
generally , we found that teens who sought n - o - t intervention started smoking during their preteen years , were poly - tobacco users , were highly dependent on nicotine , had made previous attempts to quit ( and were not favorable toward nrt ) , were daily smokers , and were deeply embedded in smoking contexts .
interestingly , we did not identify sociodemographic factors that predicted intervention readiness as measured in our study .
it is possible that other , unmeasured factors influence a teen smoker 's readiness to quit using a teen smoking cessation program .
it is also possible that a better measure of readiness needs to be identified .
however , as discussed above , we found a few interesting results when we entered the individual variables ( within the construct ) into the regression model .
in depth research is needed to explore this issue .
although we found a few sources of comparative data for the general us teen smoking population and from other intervention seekers , it would be useful in the future to explore a cohort sample of teen smokers comprised of both intervention seekers and nonintervention seekers .
the development of effective recruitment strategies for teen smoking cessation interventions will be best informed by identifying the characteristics of both treatment - and non treatment - seeking smokers .
however , the importance of the current study should not be minimized .
experts have underscored the importance of recruitment .
this composite profile of teen smokers who participated in n - o - t can guide efforts for targeted recruitment strategies to enhance intervention reach for n - o - t and similar programs with demonstrated efficacy .
our findings are particularly relevant to marketing and recruitment efforts of the n - o - t program , the most widely used program in the us [ 18 ] and the most widely evaluated smoking cessation program in the world [ 50 ] .

the objective of this article is to implement the potential exp ( - phi ( eta )) - expansion method to search solitary wave solutions for nonlinear evolution equations via the fourth order boussinesq equation .
in former literature , the solitary wave solutions to the boussinesq equation have not been studied by this method .
the article is organized as follows : in methodology section , we give the description of the exp ( - phi ( eta )) - expansion method .
we apply this method to the fourth order boussinesq equation in the application section .
2d and 3d graphs are given in the graphical representations of the solutions section .
finally , in conclusion section , we draw our conclusions .
methodology let us consider the nonlinear evolution equation in the form 1 where u = u ( x , t ) is an unknown function , f is a polynomial in u ( x , t ) and its derivatives in which highest order derivatives and nonlinear terms are involved and the subscripts indicate partial derivatives .
in order to investigate solitary wave solutions of ( 1 ) by using the exp ( - phi ( eta )) - expansion method , we have to perform the following important steps : step 1 .
we combine the real variables x and t by a compound variable eta 2 where v is the celerity of the traveling wave. by means of traveling wave transformation ( 2 ) , eq .
( 1 ) switch into an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for u = u ( eta ) : 3 where h is a polynomial of u and its derivatives and the superscripts refer to the ordinary derivatives with respect to eta .
step 2 .
assume the traveling wave solution of ( 3 ) can be articulated as follows : 4 ai ( 0 <= i <= n ) are constants to be determined , such that an != 0 and phi = phi ( eta ) satisfies the following auxiliary equation : 5 depending on the parameters involved , eq .
( 5 ) has the subsequent solutions : when mu != 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu > 0 , 6 when mu != 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu < 0 , 7 when mu = 0 , lambda != 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu > 0 , 8 when mu != 0 , lambda != 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu = 0 , 9 when mu = 0 , lambda = 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu = 0 , 10 step 3 .
the positive integer n can be determined by considering the balance between the highest order derivatives and the nonlinear terms of the highest order appearing in ( 3 ) .
step 4 .
we substitute eq .
( 4 ) into eq .
( 3 ) and then we take into consideration the function exp ( - phi ( eta )) .
in consequence of this substitution , we obtain a polynomial in exp ( - phi ( eta )) .
we collect all the coefficients of identical power of exp ( - phi ( eta )) and equalize to zero delivers a system of algebraic equations whichever can be solved to find an , ...... , v , lambda , mu. the values of an , ...... , v , lambda , mu along with general solutions of eq .
( 5 ) complete the determination of the solution of eq .
( 1 ) .
application in this section , we will use the exp ( - phi ( eta )) - expansion method to construct the exact solutions and then the solitary wave solutions to the fourth order boussinesq equation .
let us consider the equation 11 the above model ( 11 ) was introduced by boussinesq to illustrate the propagation of long waves in shallow water ( lai et al .
2008 ) , where u ( x , t ) is the elevation of the free surface of the fluid , where the subscripts denoting partial derivatives .
the equation also arises in many other physical applications , such as , nonlinear lattice waves , iron sound waves in plasma , and vibrations in a nonlinear string .
it was also applied to the study of the percolation of water in porous subsurface strata .
equation ( 11 ) possesses solitary waves , extract from traveling wave solutions and boussinesq was the first who gave a scientific explanation of their existence .
we utilize the traveling wave variable u ( eta ) = u ( x , t ) , eta = x - vt and this operation changes ( 11 ) to the following ode : 12 integrating eq .
( 12 ) twice with respect to eta yields : 13 where c is an integration constant to be determined .
balancing the highest order nonlinear term u2 and linear term of the highest order u '' appearing in ( 13 ) , yields n = 2 .
therefore , the solution of eq .
( 13 ) takes the form 14 where a0 , a1 , a2 are arbitrary constants such that a2 != 0 .
we substitute eq .
( 14 ) into eq .
( 13 ) and taking consideration eq .
( 5 ) , it generates a polynomial and then setting the coefficients of exp ( - phi ( eta )) to zero , yields 17 18 19 20 solutions of eqs .
( 17 ) - ( 20 ) , yield where lambda , mu and a0 are arbitrary constants .
substituting the values of v , a0 , a1 , a2 into eq .
( 14 ) , yields 21 where by using the solutions of eq .
( 5 ) into eq .
( 21 ) , we obtain the succeeding traveling wave solutions of the fourth order boussinesq equation : type 1 : when mu != 0 , lambda2 - 4mu > 0 , where and e is an arbitrary constant .
type 2 : when mu != 0 , lambda2 - 4mu < 0 , where and e is an arbitrary constant .
type 3 : when mu = 0 , lambda != 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu > 0 , where and e is an arbitrary constant .
type 4 : when mu != 0 , lambda != 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu = 0 , where and e is an arbitrary constant .
type 5 : when mu = 0 , lambda = 0 , and lambda2 - 4mu = 0 , where and e is an arbitrary constant .
solitary wave solutions represent an important type of solutions for nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) as many nonlinear partial differential equations have been found to have a variety of solitary wave solutions .
it is familiar that searching of exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations plays a significant role in the study of nonlinear physical phenomena .
exact traveling wave solutions are useful for verifying the accuracy and stability of popular numerical schemes such as the finite difference and finite element methods .
the solitary wave solutions obtained in this article are encouraging , applicable , and could be helpful in analyzing long wave propagation on the surface of a fluid layer under the action of gravity , iron sound waves in plasma , and vibrations in a nonlinear string .
graphical representation of the solutions solitary waves can be obtained from each traveling wave solution by setting particular values to its unknown parameters. by adjusting these parameters , one can get an internal localized mode .
in this section , we have presented some graphs of solitary waves constructed by taking suitable values of the involved unknown parameters to visualize the underlying mechanism to the original physical phenomena .
using mathematical software mathematica , two and three - dimensional plots of the obtained solutions have been shown in figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 .

the obtained solutions of the fourth order boussinesq equation incorporate four types of explicit solutions namely hyperbolic , trigonometric , exponential , and rational function solutions. from these explicit results we observe that solutions u1 ( eta ) and u2 ( eta ) are soliton and the rest of the three solutions are cuspon .
the above solitary wave solutions might be useful in analyzing the propagation of long waves in shallow water , iron sound waves in plasma , and vibrations in a nonlinear string .
conclusions in this article , we have successfully formulated solitary waves solutions from the traveling wave solutions to the fourth order boussinesq equation through the exp ( - phi ( eta )) - expansion method .
the procedure is simple , direct and constructive with the help of a computer algebra system .
the method is quite efficient and practically well suited to be used in finding solitary wave solutions of nlees and the attained solutions demonstrated the competence of the exp ( - phi ( eta )) - expansion method .
we also observed that the method is straightforward and can be applied to many other nonlinear evolution equations .

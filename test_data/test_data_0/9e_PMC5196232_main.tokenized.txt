this paper presents data related to an article entitled " green tea flavor determinants and their changes over manufacturing processes " ( han et al. , 2016 ) [ 1 ] .
green tea samples were prepared with steaming and pan firing treatments from the tender leaves of tea cultivars ' bai - sang cha ' (' bas ') and ' fuding - dabai cha ' (' fud ') .
aroma compounds from the tea infusions were detected and quantified using hs - spme coupled with gc / ms. sensory evaluation was also made for characteristic tea flavor .
the data shows the abundances of the detected aroma compounds , their threshold values and odor characteristics in the two differently processed tea samples as well as two different cultivars .
specifications table table subject area chemistry more specific subject area aroma type of data table how data was acquired hs - spme coupled with gc / ms data format analyzed experimental factors green tea samples were prepared from the fresh leaves of two cultivars following two different processing technology .
then the infusions were prepared brewing the sample leaves in the hot water for 5 min .
experimental features volatile aroma compounds present in the tea infusions were identified and quantified using hs - spme coupled with gc - ms. data source location shucheng , anhui , china ( 31degrees31 ' 87 '' n , 117degrees02 ' 84 '' e ) data accessibility data is available with this article value of the data * this adds to the limited public datasets available to compare the aroma compounds between the infusions prepared from differently processed green teas as well as from different cultivars .
* threshold values and odor characteristics of detected volatiles will allow researchers to compare their data independently .
* standard curves established using authentic compounds can be used by other researchers to quantify the volatiles .
* the data provides information about the changes specific to processing technology and cultivar differences .
1 data the data presented in table 1 , table 2 , table 3 , table 4 , table 5 , table 6 display standard curves for compound quantification , tea sensory evaluation results , aroma compounds with varied abundances , perception threshold values in the infusions of the steamed processed ( st ) and pan firing processed ( pa ) teas from cultivars ' bas' and ' fud ' .
dynamic changes in the abundance of different flavor compounds due to the processing treatments and cultivars can be found in the associated article [ 1 ] .
2 experimental design , materials and methods 2.1 chemicals for volatile profiling , authentic standards of linalool , linalool oxides , geraniol , citral , beta - myrcene , limonene , beta - ocimene , nerol , trans - nerolidol , farnesene , beta - ionone , geranyl acetone , naphthalene , cis - 3 - hexen - 1 - ol , nonanal , benzene acetaldehyde , methyl salicylate , cis - hexenyl acetate , methyl jasmonate , cis - 3 - hexenyl hexanoate , 3 - octen - 1 - ol , indole and ethyl decanoate were purchased from sigma - aldrich ( shanghai , china ) .
cis - jasmone was purchased from aladdin industrial inc .
( shanghai , china ) .
2.2 volatile profiling tea infusions were prepared using the fresh leaf samples and final product tea samples from two cultivars .
volatile collection , identification and quantification were conducted according to wang et al .
[ 7 ] using headspace - solid phase micro - extraction ( hs - spme ) coupled with gas chromatography ( agilent 7697a )/ mass spectrometry ( agilent 7890a ) ( gc / ms ) with some minor modifications .
in our experiments , 5 ml tea infusion was used for headspace volatile collection with the fiber ( 65 mum pdms / dvb , supelco , bellefonte pa , usa ) for 1 h. db - 5 capillary column ( 30 mx0.25 mmx0.25 microm , agilent ) was used for gc / ms analysis .
the assays were carried out in triplicate for each sample .
ethyl decanoate ( 0.01 % , 10 mul ) was added to the samples as the internal standard .
chemicals were identified by comparing with either the standard substance or the nist database [ 8 ] .
compounds quantification were calculated based either on the calibration curves established using series diluted solutions prepared with authentic standards or on the peak areas of the internal standard .
the concentrations of the volatiles were expressed as mug kg - 1 dw .
2.3 sensory evaluation of tea infusions three grams ( accurate to 0.01 g ) of the processed tea was infused with 150 ml of distilled boiling water for 5 min. by using a sieve , infused leaves were removed and tea infusions were transferred to glasses .
the sensory evaluation was carried out by five trained panelists .
they were instructed to evaluate the sensory responses regarding taste , aroma , and overall flavor quality by giving a score within 100 and also to note down the flavor characteristics of the samples .
subsequent analyses of the samples were performed in triplicate.the order of the samples was randomized. between the tastes of the samples , every panelist drank natural mineral water and ate unsalted cracker to vanish the taste .
final sensory scores were statistically analyzed using t - test ( p < 0.05 ) .

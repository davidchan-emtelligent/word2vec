background identification of stem cells from a corneal epithelial cell population by specific molecular markers has been investigated previously .
expressions of p63 , abcg2 and k14 / k5 have all been linked to mammalian corneal epithelial stem cells .
here we report on the limitations of k14 / k5 as a limbal stem cell marker .
methodology / principal findings k14 / k5 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry , western blotting and real time pcr and compared between bovine epithelial cells in the limbus and central cornea .
a functional study was also included to investigate changes in k5 / 14 expression within cultured limbal epithelial cells undergoing forced differentiation .
k14 expression ( or its partner k5 ) was detected in quiescent epithelial cells from both the limbal area and central cornea .
k14 was localized predominantly to basal epithelial cells in the limbus and suprabasal epithelial cells in the central cornea .
western blotting revealed k14 expression in both limbus and central cornea ( higher levels in the limbus ) .
similarly , quantitative real time pcr found k5 , partner to k14 , to be expressed in both the central cornea and limbus .
following forced differentiation in culture the limbal epithelial cells revealed an increase in k5 / 14 gene / protein expression levels in concert with a predictable rise in a known differentiation marker .
conclusions / significance k14 and its partner k5 are limited not only to the limbus but also to the central bovine cornea epithelial cells suggesting k14 / k5 is not limbal specific in situ .
furthermore k14 / k5 expression levels were not lowered ( in fact they increased ) within a limbal epithelial cell culture undergoing forced differentiation suggesting k14 / k5 is an unreliable maker for undifferentiated cells ex vivo .
introduction the cornea is the transparent tissue at the front of the eye ; corneal epithelial cells , which are its external cell layers , are supported by corneal epithelial stem cells , located in the limbus , an area where the central cornea and conjunctiva meets .
corneal epithelial stem cells give rise to renewal of the corneal surface , as part of normal cell death or repair [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
the mechanisms that control corneal epithelial stem cell differentiation are not fully understood , although several cell signaling pathways have been proposed to regulate corneal epithelial stem cell activities , as others have shown [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
identification of the epithelial stem cells from a corneal cell population by specific molecular markers has been intensively investigated for over the last 10 years .
p63 [ 8 ] , abcg2 [ 9 ] and k14 [ 10 ] have been reported to be positively expressed in mammalian corneal epithelial stem cells , and k3 [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , k12 [ 13 ] , and cx43 [ 14 ] have been shown to be only positively expressed in terminally differentiated corneal epithelial cells .
however , there still remains no decisive stem cell marker .
therefore , to identify corneal epithelial stem cells a combination of various cell makers including both positive and negative putative corneal epithelial stem cell makers must be used [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
p63 , abcg2 and k14 have been shown to accumulate in basal cells within the limbus .
histological [ 19 ] and molecular [ 1 ] studies of limbal basal cells has demonstrated that these cells have typical adult somatic stem cell features , such as small cell size , large nuclear to cytoplasm ratio [ 3 ] , and ability to form holoclones [ 20 ] .
limbal epithelial basal layers are also responsible for corneal epithelial wound healing in mammalian cornea [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , further proof that , corneal limbal stem cells are believed to be exclusive to the limbus .
these stem cells can provide daughter cells , which populate the corneal epithelium centripetally , differentiating as the move from the limbal area of the limbus to central cornea .
however , recently it has been shown that after serial transplantation , mouse corneal epithelium is self - maintained suggested from that central cornea epithelium contains oligopotent stem cells [ 4 ] .
this result conflicts with the previous limbal basal epithelial stem cell hypothesis , and subsequently questions the reliability of several limbal specific corneal epithelial stem cell markers .
keratin 14 has been proposed as a marker for epidermal stem cells in skin [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , and it has also been shown that its expression highlights the basal cells of limbal epithelium with its keratin pair partner , k5 .
k5 / 14 pairs have been shown positive to bovine limbal basal layers , suggesting k5 / 14 as a potential corneal stem cell marker [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
however , in the rabbit cornea , k14 positive cells were confined not only to the basal but also to the suprabasal layers of the limbal epithelium [ 26 ] .
this discrepancy highlights the difficulty of interpreting data obtained from k5 / k14 in human and animal models .
in this paper , our hypothesis is that a traditional corneal epithelial stem cell marker , k14 is not ideal for the identification corneal epithelial stem cell especially in expanded cells .
we report here that k14 expression was observed in both bovine limbus and central cornea and that k14 expression was found to increase in limbal epithelial cells , after air - lifting treatment , a cell culture technique well known to increase cell differentiation and promote cell - cell barrier function [ 18 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
materials and methods preparation of human am as substrate for limbal stem cells expansion cryopreserved human am was collected from the division of ophthalmology and visual science , queens medical centre , nottingham , uk with approval from the local research ethics committee ( nottingham ) .
the membranes were washed with sterile phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) containing penicillin ( 100iunits / ml ) and streptomycin ( 100 microg / ml ) ( gibco ; uk ) within a class ii microbiology safety cabinet , before they were cut into pieces ( approximately 4 cm2 ) and immediately stored at - 80degreesc in pbs .
before use , the am was thawed and washed in sterile pbs .
am was positioned with its native epithelium side up within transwell inserts held inside six well culture plates ( corning ; uk ) .
bovine corneal epithelial cells preparations bovine cornea has a structure and biochemical makeup similar to human cornea .
like human cornea bovine corneal stem cells have been localized to the basal layers of the limbus [ 10 ] , and have successfully been used as an alternative source of human limbal stem cells for basic research [ 18 ] , [ 30 ] - [ 32 ] .
bovine eyes were collected ( chity wholesale abattoir , guildford , uk ) within 2 hours of death and transported on ice before corneas were dissected for epithelial cell isolation .
the whole limbal ring tissue from each eye , including the subconjunctival tenon 's capsule , was cut into 10 - 12 pieces ( approximately 5 mm long ) and incubated for 12 hours at 37degreesc in basal culture medium with 0.02 % type ia collagenase ( sigma - aldrich ; uk ) .
the epithelium was peeled from the enzyme - treated limbal pieces , and incubated with 0.05 % trypsin / edta for 10 min at 37degreesc , and the cell sheets were dissociated into single cells by agitation through a 22 gauge needle .
the suspension of corneal limbal epithelial cells , was placed in to supplemented media ( dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium and ham 's f12 ( 1:1 ) ( dmem / f12 ) ( gibco ; uk ) including 5 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , 2 ng / ml human epidermal growth factor ( hegf ) , 5 microg / ml insulin , b27 supplement [ 31 ] medium and penicillin streptomycin ( invitrogen ; uk ) , and seeded onto either am ( spread on the bottom of culture inserts ) .
am and cells were submerged in supplemented media for 2 weeks and then exposed to air by lowering the medium level ( air - lifting ) for 1 week to promote corneal epithelial cells differentiation .
cultures were incubated at 37degreesc under 5 % co2 for approximately 3 - 4 weeks ; media was replaced every 2 days .
immunohistochemistry fresh bovine corneal pieces ( dissected from bovine eye balls ) and limbal epithelial cells expanded upon am ( collected using a 6 mm biopsy ( brymill , uk ) before ( 2 weeks ) and after air - lifting ( 3 weeks ) , were embedded in tissue tek o.c.t. compound ( agar aids ; uk ) , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at - 80degreesc prior to being sectioned .
cryostat sections ( 7 microm thick ) were placed onto poly - lysine coated slides and air - dried for 2 hours .
slides were then fixed in 100 % methanol at - 20degreesc for 15 min and in acetone ( - 20degreesc ) for 5 min before they were washed in pbs .
tissue sections were incubated with 1 % goat serum or bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) at room temperature for 30 min to block non - specific binding .
blocked sections were incubated in anti - k14 ( 1:100,guinea pig , polyclonal , progen , germany ) , anti - k3 ( 1:50 , mouse,monoclonal , chemicon , uk ) , anti - integrin alpha6 ( 1:100 , mouse , monoclonal , progen , germany ) primary antibodies overnight at 4degreesc and washed for 5 min in pbs .
horse anti - mouse ( 1:50 , vector labs , uk )/ goat anti - guinea pig ( 1:100 , progen , germany ) secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores were applied for 60 minutes at room temperature .
unbound secondary antibodies were removed by washing in pbs and sections were mounted under glass cover slips using dapi mounting media ( vector labs , u.k. ) .
negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody with pbs .
mounted sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy ( imager a1 , zeiss , germany ) .
isolation of rna and cdna synthesis total rna was isolated from cells cultured on am ( n = 6 ) , from fresh bovine cornea ( central and limbal region , n = 4 ) using the tri reagent ( sigma , poole , uk ) , according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
total rna was quantified spectrophotometrically ( ge healthcare , uk ) , and 1 ng rna was reverse - transcribed using revertaid h minus first strand cdna synthesis kit ( fermentas , u.k. ) , following the manufacturer 's protocol .
real - time quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) a custom - made perfectprobe assay ( primerdesign , u.k. ) was used to quantify keratin 12 gene ( accession number : xm _ 001255461 ) and keratin 5 ( accession number : af102774 ) expression .
each reaction was performed in triplicate on three different replicate samples with a final reaction volume of 20 microl containing 10 microl 2x qpcr mastermix ( primerdesign , u.k. ) , 1 microl reconstituted perfectprobe primer / probe mix ( primerdesign , u.k. ) , 4 microl pcr - grade water ( primerdesign , u.k. ) and 5 microl cdna ( 1:10 of original concentration ) .
non - template controls were also run .
real - time reactions were performed within a 96 - well plate ( fisher , u.k. ) in the abi prism 7700 sequence detector ( applied biosystem , u.k. ) .
the real time pcr data was analyzed by delta - delta ct - method ; therefore , the k12 and k5 mrna expression level were approximate .
western blotting proteins from bovine limbal cells , central corneal epithelial cells , and epithelial cells grown on am with and without air - lifting ( 4 microg total protein for each condition ; estimated using the modified lowry assay ) , were separated by one - dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) using 10 % gels .
they were transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride ( pvdf ) membranes and non - specific binding to membranes was blocked by incubation with 5 % ( w / v ) milk dissolved in 1x tris - buffered saline - tween ( tbs - t ) ( 20 mm tris - base , 0.14 m nacl , 0.1 % tween ( r ) - 20 ; ph 7.6 ) .
membranes were incubated with mouse anti - k3 , anti - k14 and anti - gapdh primary antibody ( 1 microgml - 1 ) diluted in 2 % ( w / v ) milk dissolved in 1x tbs - t at 4degreesc overnight .
blots were washed for 45 min in 1x tbs - t before incubation with an anti - mouse hrp - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1:6000 dilutions ) for 2 h at room temperature .
proteins were detected on x - ray film using an enhanced chemiluminescence ( ecl ) system .
statistical analysis student 's t - tests ( unpaired ) were performed using microsoft excel .
results are presented as the mean of 3 individual experiments with standard error of mean ( s.e.m. ) and p - value <= 0.05 was considered significant .
results location of keratin 14 and keratin 3 expression in vivo bovine cornea k14 positive cells were observed in the basal layers of limbus , whereas k14 expression was not detected in the superior cell layers ( figure 1a ) .
in contrast , within the central cornea , k14 positive cells were distributed throughout the epithelial cell layers ( figure 1b ) .
epithelial cells stained with k3 were detected in limbal superior layers , but absent in the basal cell layers ( figure 1c ) ; k3 positive cells were highly expressed in the central cornea , and present throughout all the epithelial cell layers ( figure 1d ) .

k14 ( green ) positive cells were only detected to the basal layer of limbus ( a ) , but its expression was also seen throughout central corneal layers ( b ) .
although k3 ( red ) expression is absent in the limbal basal layer cells ( c ) , k3 highlights whole central corneal cell layers ( d ) .
control sections for limbal ( e ) and central cornea ( f ) show no background staining .
quantification of keratin 14 and keratin 3 expression to quantify mrna levels of k12 ( works as a pair with k3 ) and k5 ( works as a pair with k14 ) expression , we applied real - time pcr .
in general , k5 mrna had a similar expression level in central cornea and limbus ( figure 2 ) ; and k12 mrna expression level was also found not to be significantly different between central cornea and limbus .

real - time pcr results demonstrated that k5 mrna level in limbus and central cornea is not statistically significant ( a ) .
however , k14 protein in the limbus showed higher expression than the central cornea ( b ) .
k12 mrna ( a ) and k3 protein ( b ) showed similar expression level both in central and limbal cornea .
western blotting was used to examine k3 and k14 protein expression .
k14 protein level expression was clearly higher in limbus than in central cornea .
k3 protein level showed strong expression both in limbus and central cornea ( figure 2 ) .
k14 expression in cultured epithelial cells before and after air - lifting bovine limbal epithelial cells were isolated and then cultured on intact am for two weeks plus a further week following air - lifting , resulting in stratification of the cultured cells into 5 - 7 cell layers .
k14 expression was observed throughout all cell layers after 2 weeks in culture ( figure 3a ) .
following air - lifting , k14 expression appeared slightly reduced in the superior cell layers , but was still strongly expressed in the basal cell layers ( figure 3b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0013192.g003 figure 3 air - lifting treatment had limited effect on k14 expression in cultured cells .
k14 expression in limbal epithelial cells cultured on amniotic membrane before air - lifting ( a ) and after air - lifting ( b ) .
no labeling was seen in the control section ( c ) .
real - time pcr results demonstrated that in cultured limbal epithelial cells , after a week air - lifting , k5 mrna expression level had slightly increased ( but not statistically significant ) .
this observation was also confirmed by k14 protein expression , i.e. western blotting results showed that k14 protein expression increased after air - lifting , which mirrored the results obtained from real - time pcr ( figure 4 ) .

following air - lifting , k5 mrna level in the cultured cells increased nearly 3 fold ( a ) , and k14 protein showed a clear increase in its level after air - lifting treatment ( b ) .
( ba : before air - lifting , aa : after air - lifting ) .
discussion corneal epithelial stem cells have been proposed to be exclusively located to the basal layer of limbal region [ 22 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
k14 expression , as a proposed corneal epithelial stem cell marker , highlights the basal cell layer within the corneal limbus [ 10 ] , but information on its expression in the central cornea is limited .
k3 is a differentiated cell marker [ 11 ] , which is usually found expressed in superior layers of limbal epithelium , and throughout central corneal epithelium .
however our results , using multiple approaches , demonstrate that within intact bovine cornea , k14 expression is not only located to the basal layer of limbal epithelium , but is also found in the central corneal epithelium , similar to k3 expression pattern .
in our studies of k14 protein distribution across the ocular surface , immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) results clearly showed that k14 positive cells covered the majority of limbal basal layer cells , and also all cell layers in central cornea .
these results suggest that either i ) corneal epithelial stem cells are not restricted to the limbal basal layers ; or ii ) k14 is not a precise corneal epithelial stem cell marker .
corneal epithelial stem cells have recently been proposed to be distributed throughout cornea , implying that the corneal limbus is not the only niche for corneal stem cells [ 4 ] .
based on this hypothesis , the stem cell markers should be able to detect stem cells not only located in the limbal basal cell layer , but also multiple locations throughout cornea .
our k14 expression fit this hypothesis , i.e. expression is not restricted to the limbus region , but is also found to be positive in central cornea .
therefore , this may offer an explanation of our results regarding k14 expression .
however , although k14 was located to the basal cell layer of the limbus , it has also been found positive in conjunctiva cells [ 35 ] , thus , the reliability of applying k14 as a distinct stem cell marker requires further examination .
in our studies we quantified k5 / 12 mrna and k3 / 14 protein level in cornea .
real - time pcr ( rtpcr ) results demonstrated that the k5 / k12 mrna relative expression ratio is more than 1 / 6 (~ 17 %) higher in the limbus , and western blotting ( wb ) results showed the k14 expression is also higher than k3 in limbus .
although the ratio between stem cells and differentiated cells in corneal limbus is not well defined , it is generally accepted that only 10 % of limbal basal cells are stem cells [ 1 ] .
therefore , k5 / 14 pair is expressed in more than just corneal epithelial stem cells , and must also include a certain amount of differentiated corneal epithelial cells .
k5 / 14 positive cells are likely to include cells in varying states of differentiation i.e. from stem cells to transit amplifying cells ( tac ) and finally to terminal differentiated cells .
throughout this process a cell may express several different profiles of differentiation and progenitor markers at any one moment within a tissue .
air - lifting , as a cell culture technique , was originally developed to create sheets of skin cells for transplantation and to promote epidermal cell differentiation [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] , this technique has since been applied successfully to corneal cell culture [ 18 ] .
to further investigate the k5 / 14 as a stem cell marker , we cultured limbal epithelial cells on am for 2 weeks , and then artificially promoted cell differentiation by employing the air - lifting technique .
interestingly , ihc results showed that air - lifting had a limited effect on k14 protein amount and distribution , and rtpcr and wb results showed that both k5 mrna level and k14 protein level were actually slightly increased after air - lifting .
therefore , these results appear counter intuitive since air - lifting is thought to increase the level of differentiation in these cells .
these lines of evidence suggest that the observed multiple locations of k14 positive cells is not because the corneal stem cells reside in more than one niche , in contrast , it is more likely due to the dynamic state of the corneal epithelial stem cells differentiation states .
in conclusion , k14 has been proposed as a limbal stem cell marker for mammalian cornea , and this is consistent with our results , since k14 highlighted the basal layer of the bovine limbal region ( an area known to contain epithelial stem cells ) .
therefore , k14 can be thought of as a stem cell marker under specific circumstances , i.e. within the limbus of a quiescent cornea .
however , this paper also used multiple lines of evidence to demonstrate that k14 expression is not always specific to limbal stem cells , as its accuracy is degraded in cells actively undergoing differentiation .
in summary , our results highlight the fact that a decisive molecular corneal stem cell marker remains out of reach and the difficulties of identifying robust stem cell markers is hampered by the inherent dynamic status of the stem cell .

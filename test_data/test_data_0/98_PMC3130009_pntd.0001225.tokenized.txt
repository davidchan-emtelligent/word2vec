background paramyosin is a thick myofibrillar protein found exclusively in invertebrates .
evidence suggested that paramyosin from helminths serves not only as a structural protein but also as an immunomodulatory agent .
we previously reported that recombinant trichinella spiralis paramyosin ( ts - pmy ) elicited a partial protective immunity in mice .
in this study , the ability of ts - pmy to bind host complement components and protect against host complement attack was investigated .
methods and findings in this study , the transcriptional and protein expression levels of ts - pmy were determined in t. spiralis newborn larva ( nbl ) , muscle larva ( ml ) and adult worm developmental stages by rt - pcr and western blot analysis .
expression of ts - pmy at the outer membrane was observed in nbl and adult worms using immunogold electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining .
functional analysis revealed that recombinant ts - pmy ( rts - pmy ) strongly bound to complement components c8 and c9 and inhibited the polymerization of c9 during the formation of the membrane attack complex ( mac ) .
rts - pmy also inhibited the lysis of rabbit erythrocytes ( er ) elicited by an alternative pathway - activated complement from guinea pig serum .
inhibition of native ts - pmy on the surface of nbl with a specific antiserum reduced larvae viability when under the attack of complement in vitro .
in vivo passive transfer of anti - ts - pmy antiserum and complement - treated larvae into mice also significantly reduced the number of larvae that developed to ml. conclusion these studies suggest that the outer membrane form of t. spiralis paramyosin plays an important role in the evasion of the host complement attack .
author summary trichinellosis is a serious food borne parasitic disease caused by the consumption of meat contaminated with the infective larvae of trichinella spiralis .
the ability of the tissue - dwelling parasite to evade the host complement attack is essential for its survival and for establishing infection in the host .
this study describes the expression of paramyosin , a muscular protein in invertebrates , on the surface of trichinella spiralis and its role in the defense against the host complement attack as a survival strategy .
using a specific antiserum , expression of trichinella spiralis paramyosin was detected on the outer membrane of the adult worms and newborn larvae .
functional analysis revealed that recombinant trichinella spiralis paramyosin protein strongly bound human complement components c8 and c9 and inhibited the formation of the complement membrane attack complex .
neutralization with a specific antiserum greatly impaired the protective effect of paramyosin on the viability and infectivity of trichinella spiralis newborn larva when under attack by complement .
these studies suggest that the outer membrane form of trichinella spiralis paramyosin plays an important role in the evasion of the host complement attack and is therefore a good target for vaccine and pharmaceutical development .
introduction trichinellosis is one of the common parasitic zoonoses and is a serious public threat in both developing and developed countries [ 1 ] - [ 6 ] .
trichinella spiralis ( t. spiralis ) infection is initiated by the consumption of meat contaminated with infective muscle larvae ( ml ). with the aid of host gastric juice , ml are released from cysts and migrate to the small intestine where they develop into adult worms in 2 - 3 days .
five days post - infection , gravid females begin to produce newborn larvae ( nbl ) , which penetrate the intestinal mucosa and enter the lymphatic vessels and bloodstream [ 7 ] .
nbl travel through capillaries to various organs and finally invade the muscles , where they form cysts .
during the life cycle of t. spiralis in the host , all developmental stages are exposed to host complement , which is the first line of defense against pathogenic organisms and is a functional bridge between the innate and adaptive immune responses [ 8 ] .
the ability to evade complement attack is essential for the survival of parasites within their respective hosts [ 9 ] .
as early as 1911 , the presence of complement - fixing antigens from larvae of t. spiralis was reported in antiformin extracts of pepsin - digested rat muscle [ 10 ] .
complement - fixing antigens have since been used to diagnosis of trichinosis of trichinellosis [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
subsequent studies have reported that the complement elements c3 , c5 [ 13 ] , c1q , c8 and c9 [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] directly bind the ml of t. spiralis .
all three stages of t. spiralis are capable of activating complement via the classical or alternative pathways [ 14 ] , or the lectin pathway [ 16 ] .
however , it is still unknown whether the activation of the complement is detrimental or beneficial to the parasite .
nbl might be the most potent activators [ 13 ] .
molecules or structures on the outermost cuticle / epicuticle of the parasite directly bind complement and appear to protect the parasite from an attack by inhibiting the formation of the membrane attack complex ( mac ) [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
rats with normal levels of c6 or those with a c6 - deficiency have similar susceptibilities to infection by t. spiralis .
however , c3 , c8 and c9 were found to bind worms , suggesting that t. spiralis has efficient mechanisms for protecting against complement attack [ 15 ] .
however , the precise molecular basis for this resistance is still unknown .
paramyosin is a thick myofibrillar protein found exclusively in invertebrates [ 17 ] .
experimental evidence has shown that paramyosin from helminths serves not only as a structural protein but also as an immunomodulatory agent [ 18 ] - [ 22 ] .
it has been reported that paramyosin from taenia solium inhibits c1 function [ 18 ] .
paramyosin from schistosoma mansoni acts as an immunological defense molecule by binding c1q [ 18 ] , the fc fragment of igg [ 19 ] , c8 and c9 [ 20 ] - [ 21 ] .
recently , paramyosin from clonorchis sinensis was shown to bind both human collagen and c9 [ 22 ] .
in our previous study , a full - length cdna encoding t. spiralis paramyosin ( ts - pmy ) was cloned by immunoscreening an adult t. spiralis cdna library with infected immune sera [ 23 ] , recombinant ts - pmy ( rts - pmy ) elicited partial protective immunity against a t. spiralis larval challenge in balb / c mice [ 24 ] .
in the present study , we investigated ability of rts - pmy to bind to host complement components and to protect against host complement attack .
our data show that rts - pmy binds complement components c8 and c9 and inhibits the complement - mediated killing of nbl , providing more evidence that ts - pmy plays an important role in the evasion of the host immune response to facilitate the survival of t. spiralis in its host .

results 1 .
expression and localization of ts - pmy in different developmental stages of t. spiralis the transcription of ts - pmy mrna at different developmental stages in t. spriralis was analyzed by rt - pcr with ts - pmy specific primers .
ts - pmy mrna was transcribed in all developmental stages ( ml , nbl and adult worm ; figure 1a ) .

2. enhanced complement - mediated killing of nbl treated with anti - rts - pmy rabbit serum to determine whether ts - pmy expressed on the parasite surface protects nbl from being killed by the host complement , heat - inactivated rabbit anti - rts - pmy serum was used to block ts - pmy on the nbl .
the antiserum - or normal rabbit serum - treated nbl were challenged with the complement from fresh ngs .
as shown in figure 2 , after being blocked with anti - rts - pmy serum , nbl viability was significantly decreased following incubation with fresh ngs compared to those of the normal rabbit serum group .

complement components have been implicated in the killing of strongyloides stercoralis larvae [ 37 ] and schistosoma mansoni schistosomula [ 21 ] .
the ability to evade complement attack is essential for the survival of tissue - dwelling nematodes within hosts .
many parasites , especially those living in or in contact with blood , seem to have developed parallel routes to escape complement attack [ 38 ]. t. spiralis infective larvae ( ml ) , adults and nbl are able to bind to the complement components [ 14 ] and evade complement - mediated killing [ 15 ] .
however , the mechanism by which t. spiralis evades complement - mediated killing is still not completely understood .
paramyosin is an essential muscle protein in invertebrates , forming the core of thick myofilaments that determine the length and stability of muscles [ 17 ] .
it has been suggested that the surface expression of paramyosin by schistosoma mansoni [ 20 ] and taenia solium [ 39 ] may inhibit the complement cascade of the immune system .
thus , in the present study , we examined the expression and localization of ts - pmy in the three developmental stages of t. spiralis and showed that ts - pmy is present on the outer membrane of the cuticle of the adults and nbl of t. spiralis .
our results were consistent with other observations that identified paramyosin in the tegument and on the surface of schistosoma mansoni , schistosoma japonicum [ 19 ] , echinococcus granulosus [ 40 ] , taenia solium [ 39 ] and fasciola hepatica [ 41 ] .
the existence of a surface - exposed form of paramyosin suggests a role as a potential modulator of the host immune system .
it was previously observed that paramyosin on the surface of helminth parasites bound to the fc of igg [ 19 ] and iga [ 42 ] , collagen and at least three complement components , c1q [ 18 ] , c8 and c9 [ 20 ] .
the fact that ts - pmy is expressed on the outermost layer of the parasite indicates a possible role in the first line of defense against the host immune response .
our data confirmed that surface - exposed ts - pmy binds to complement c8 and c9 , which are important components of the complement activation cascade and comprise the membrane attack complex ( mac ) [ 43 ] .
polymerization of c9 induced by zn2 + was highly inhibited by rts - pmy , indicating that the assembly of the mac was impaired .
the alternative complement pathway that activates the complement complex or poly - c9 on the rabbit erythrocytes ( er ) was also greatly inhibited by rts - pmy .
these studies suggest that ts - pmy binding to c8 and c9 inhibits the assembly and formation of the mac , creating an effective strategy for the parasite to evade complement attack [ 28 ] .
similar strategies are also adopted by schistosoma mansoni [ 28 ] , entamoeba hisolytica [ 44 ] , herpesvirus saimiri [ 45 ] and trypanosoma cruzi [ 46 ] .
functional analysis in this study revealed that rts - pmy inhibited the lysis of er triggered by guinea pig serum , indicating that the binding of ts - pmy to c8 / c9 or other complement elements inhibits the complement activation pathways .
whole t. spiralis worms also inhibited of complement - mediated hemolysis [ 14 ] , suggesting that native ts - pmy or other modulating molecules on the surface of the worm might have similar functions as complement inhibitors .
such observations are consistent with the findings of other studies of paramyosin in schistosoma mansoni [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
additional evidences from this study show that native ts - pmy on the surface of t. spiralis effectively protected nbl from attack by host complements .
blocking ts - pmy on the surface of t. spiralis with anti - rts - pmy antiserum reduce of nbl viability when under attack by complement in vitro .
in vivo passive transfer experiments with nbl treated with anti - ts - pmy antiserum and ngs also showed a significant reduction in the number of nbl that developed into ml in mouse muscle , indicating that the infectivity of these larvae after ts - pmy blocked by antibodies was seriously impaired .
our studies suggest that the outer membrane form of paramyosin expressed by t. spiralis has a role in host immunomodulation , presumably by inhibiting the formation of the mac and thereby protecting the parasite from being damaged by activated complement .
this modulation is an effective survival strategy for t. spiralis to live within its host .
disruptions of the immunomodulatory function of ts - pmy could be explored as an alternative strategy to control t. spiralis infection .
as a result , t. spiralis paramyosin is under further evaluation as a potential laboratory reagent to study host complement function and as a potential vaccine antigen .
the specific epitope in ts - pmy that reacts with the complement or elicits protective immunity is currently being defined .

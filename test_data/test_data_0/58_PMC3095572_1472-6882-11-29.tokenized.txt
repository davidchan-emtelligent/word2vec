background thymoquinone is an active principle of nigella sativa seed known as " habbah al - sauda " in arabic countries and " sinouj " in tunisia .
bacterial biofilms tend to exhibit significant tolerance to antimicrobials drugs during infections .
methods the antibacterial activity of thymoquinone ( tq ) and its biofilm inhibition potencies were investigated on 11 human pathogenic bacteria .
the growth and development of the biofilm were assessed using the crystal violet ( cv ) and the 2 , 3 - bis [ 2 - methyloxy - 4 - nitro - 5 - sulfophenyl ] - 2h - tetrazolium - 5 - carboxanilide ( xtt ) reduction assay .
results tq exhibited a significant bactericidal activity against the majority of the tested bacteria ( mics values ranged from 8 to 32 mug / ml ) especially gram positive cocci ( staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 ) .
crystal violet assay demonstrated that the minimum biofilm inhibition concentration ( bic50 ) was reached with 22 and 60 mug / ml for staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 respectively .
in addition our data revealed that cells oxidative activity was influenced by tq supplementation .
in the same way , tq prevented cell adhesion to glass slides surface .
conclusion the ability of tq to prevent biofilm formation warrants further investigation to explore its use as bioactive substances with antibiofilm potential .
background a biofilm is a community of cells attached to biotic or abiotic surface [ 1,2 ] .
it allows micro - organisms to survive in hostile environmental conditions [ 2 ] .
pathogenic bacteria released from the biofilm lead to food hygiene problems [ 3 ] .
conventional methods for biofilm removal are generally inadequate .
biofilm formation required the polysaccharide intercellular adhesion which contributed to cells protection against host immune system [ 4,5 ] .
prevention of biofilm formation effect of plants has been largely reported against listeria monocytogenes [ 6 ] , pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 7 ] , streptococcus mutans [ 8 - 10 ] , staphylococcus aureus [ 11,12 ] , candida albicans [ 13 ] and oral pathogens [ 14 ] .
the presence of rich biological active compounds in nigella sativa volatile oil has highlighted its traditional medicinal use [ 15 ] .
black seed of nigella sativa l. have been used in middle eastern folk medicine as a natural remedy for various diseases for over 2000 years [ 16 ] .
many active principles have been isolated from nigella sativa seed [ 17 ] including thymoquinone ( tq ) .
tq ( 2 - isopropyl - 5 - methyl - 1,4 - benzoquinone ) was the bioactive constituent of this oil [ 18 ] showing antibacterial [ 19,20 ] and antifungal activity [ 21 ] .
in addition a great antibacterial action of tq against paenibacillus larvae was observed ( mic values ranging from 8 to 16 mg / ml ) [ 22 ] .
alkharfy et al. , [ 23 ] reported that th treatment reduced mortality in mice following lipopolysaccharid and live esherichia coli challenge by 80 - 90 % .
more recently , tq inhibits the proliferation of mcf - 7 / dox cells [ 24 ] .
this study was undertaken to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of tq and its potency to prevent biofilm formation against human pathogenic bacteria .
methods organisms and chemicals in this study , the antibacterial activity of tq was tested on 11 human pathogenic strains including gram negative bacilli : escherichi coli atcc 35218 , salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 , pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 , vibrio alginolyticus atcc 33787 , vibrio paraheamolyticus atcc 17802 ; gram positive bacilli : bacillus cereus atcc 14579 , listeria monocytogene atcc 19115 and gram positive cocci : enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 , micrococcus luteus ncimb 8166 , staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 , staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 ( table 1 ) .

b , minimum bactericidal concentration .
tq , gentamycin and erythromycin was purchased from sigma ( sigma - aldrich , switzerland ) .
minimum inhibitory concentration determination the broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) and minimum bactericidal concentration ( mbc ) of tq ( 0 to 512 mug / ml ) , gentamycin ( 0 to 256 mug / ml ) and erythromycin ( 0 to 256 mug / ml ) as recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards institute [ 25 ] .
an overnight culture ( 37degreesc ) of the tested strains were diluted 10 - fold in fresh tryptic soy broth ( tsb ) and incubated ( 37degreesc ) until they reached exponential growth phase .
serial two - fold dilutions of tq in mueller hinton ( mh ) broth ( biorad , france ) were prepared in a 96 - wells plate ( 190 mul per well ) .
the inocula ( 10 mul ) containing 5 .
106 cfu / ml of each reference strain were added to each well and the tested compound .
a number of wells were reserved in each plate to test the sterility control of the medium ( no inoculum added ) and inoculum viability ( no compound added ) .
after incubation for 24 h at 37degreesc , bacterial growth was evaluated by the presence of turbidity and a pellet on the well bottom .
the mic was defined as the concentration that completely inhibited visible cell growth during a 24 - h incubation period at 37degreesc minimum bactericidal concentration determination to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration ( mbc ) values , 10 mul of each well medium with no visible growth was removed and inoculated in mh plates .
after 24 h of incubation at 37degreesc , the number of surviving organisms was determined .
mbc was defined as the lowest concentration at which 99 % of the bacteria were killed .
each experiment was repeated at least twice [ 26 ] .
effect of thymoquinone on biofilm formation crystal violet assay tq was tested for its potential to prevent biofilm formation of four reference strains ( table 2 ) .
the tq was added to the growth medium at the time of inoculation and the cells were allowed to form biofilms [ 6 ] .
prevention of biofilm formation by tq was examined by microdilution , similar to the mic assay for planktonic cells .
a two - fold serial dilution was prepared in 96 - well polystyrene tissue culture plates containing tsb broth with 2 % glucose ( w / v ) , with final concentrations of tq ranging from 0 to 512 mug / ml. table 2 antibiofilm effect of thymoquinone against four positive biofilm strains strains inhibition of biofilm development (%) crystal violet assay xtt assay abic50 ( mug / ml ) bbic90 ( mug / ml ) bic50 ( mug / ml ) bic90 ( mug / ml ) enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 85 349 44 145 staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 22 75 20.5 51 staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 60 109 40 90 pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 > 512 > 512 > 512 > 512 a , minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of tq that showed 50 % inhibition on the biofilm formation .
b , minimum biofilm inhibition concentration of tq that showed 90 % inhibition on the biofilm formation .
the medium without tq was used as the non - treated well and the medium with tq as the blank control .
aliquots of bacterial suspension ( 10 mul ) were inoculated in tissue culture plate wells ( 5.104 cfu / ml , final concentration ) .
following incubation at 37degreesc for 24h , culture supernatants from each well were decanted and planktonic cells were removed by washing three times with phosphate - buffered saline ( 7 mm na2hpo4 , 3 mm nah2po4 and 130 mm nacl at ph 7.4 ) .
cells in biofilm were fixed with methanol during 15 min , air dried and stained with 1 % crystal violet [ 27 ] .
biofilm formation was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using a microplate reader ( gio. de vita e c , italy ) .
in order to asses the ability of tq to prevent biofilm formation , the percentage of biofilm inhibition was calculated using the equation [( od growth control _ od sample )/ od growth control ] x 100 [ 6 ] .
each assay was repeated three times .
the minimum biofilm inhibition concentration ( mbic50 ) was defined as the lowest concentration of tq that showed 50 % inhibition on the biofilm formation .
assessment of biofilm metabolic activity using xtt reduction assay the metabolic activity of cells in biofilm was assessed using the xtt [ 2 , 3 - bis ( 2 - methyloxy - 4 - nitro - 5 - sulfophenyl ) - 2h - tetrazolium - 5 - carboxanilide ] reduction assay according to methods described previously [ 6,28 ] which measures the reduction of a tetrazolium salt by metabolically active cells to a coloured water soluble formazan derivative that can be easily quantified colorimetrically .
a two - fold serial dilution of tq ( final concentrations from 0 to 512 mug / ml ) was prepared in 96 - well polystyrene tissue culture plates containing tsb broth with 2 % glucose ( w / v ). than the plates were inoculated in the same way as described for crystal violet assay .
xtt ( sigma - aldrich , switzerland ) solution ( 1 mg / ml ) was prepared in pbs , filter sterilized and stored at - 80degreesc .
menadione ( sigma - aldrich , switzerland ) solution ( 1 mm ) was prepared in acetone and sterilized immediately before each assay .
following incubation , the biofilms were first washed five times with pbs , and then 100 mul pbs and 12 mul xtt - menadione solution ( 12.5:1 v / v ) were added to each of the prewashed wells and the control wells .
the plate was then incubated for 3 h in the dark at 37degreesc .
following incubation , 100 mul of the solution was transferred to fresh wells , and the colour change in the solution was measured with a multiskan reader at 492 nm. the absorbance values for the controls were then subtracted from the values of the tested wells to eliminate spurious results due to background interference .
the percentage of biofilm inhibition was calculated using the equation [( od growth control _ od sample )/ od growth control ] x 100 .
each assay was repeated three times .
microscopic techniques prevention of biofilm formation by tq was confirmed by microscopic technique .
briefly , strains were allowed to grow on round covers glass slides ( diameter 1 cm ) placed in 24 - well polystyrene plates ( greiner bio - one , france ) supplemented with tq ( 0 , mic , 2 x mic ) , incubated for 24 h at 37degreesc and stained with 1 / 20 giemsa ( sigma , switzerland ) solution ( v / v ) for 20 min at room temperature .
stained glass pieces were placed on slides with the biofilm pointing up and were inspected by light microscopy at magnifications x100 .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed on spss v.17.0 statistics software .
statistical differences and significance were assessed by one - way anova test and wilcoxon signed ranks test , as appropriate , to evaluate the biofilm inhibition according the type of strains and the tq supplementation .
a p value < 0.05 was considered significant .
results effect of thymoquinone on viability of planktonic cells tq demonstrated selective antimicrobial properties .
as presented in table 1 , it exhibited bactericidal activity on 7 out of 11 tested strains with mic and mbc values ranging from 8 to 32 mug / ml and 8 to 64 mug / ml , respectively .
this activity is nearly similar to the tested antibiotics ( gentamycin and erythromycin ) .
however , gram negative bacilli ( escherichia coli atcc 35218 , salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 , pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 ) , seem to be resistant to tq action ( mic and mbc > 512 mug / ml ) .
we noted also that the mbc values of tq were 2 - 4 times higher than the mics values .
inhibition of biofilm formation crystal violet assay prevention of biofilm formation by tq was tested on four positive strains ( table 2 ) .
results were expressed as inhibition percentages of biofilm development .
tq showed a significant inhibitory effect ( p < 0.05 ) on biofilm formation of staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 with a dose dependent manner .
as presented in table 2 , the lower bic50 of tq was observed for staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 ( 22 mug / ml ) , followed by staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 ( 60 mug / ml ) and enterococcus feacalis atcc 29212 ( 85 mug / ml ) .
our results demonstrated that tq induced prevention of 90 % of biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 , staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 when used at 75 , 109 and 349 mug / ml respectively , suggesting that its strong biofilm inhibition potencies is not restricted to staphylococci .
however , our data showed also that tq do not prevent 50 % of biofilm formation in the case of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 .
effect of thymoquinone on biofilm oxidative activity in the presence of tq , the metabolic oxidative activity of cells in biofilms was distinctly reduced after 24 h of incubation ( table 2 ) .
our data also provides preliminary evidence that tq affect the oxidative activity of all the tested strains compared to the non treated biofilm ( table 2 ) .
the bic50 was observed with tq concentration about 20.5 , 40 and 44 mug / ml for staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 ; staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 ; and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 respectively ( table 2 ) .
moreover , bic90 was very low ( 51 , 90 and 145 mug / ml ) suggesting that tq is efficient for prevention of biofilm formation .
we noted also that pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 was less susceptible to tq than the others strains .
a statistical significant difference in prevention of biofilm formation between the treated strains with tq (> 4 mug / ml ) and control was found ( p < 0.001 ) .
these results indicated that in addition to reducing the number of adherent bacteria assessed by crystal violet assay , tq has an effect on the metabolic activity of cells embedded in biofilm .
prevention of biofilm formation on glass microscope slide covers prevention of biofilm formation by tq was confirmed by microscopic visualization .
as shown in figure 1 , a moderate reduction of biofilm formation was observed with tq supplementation ( 1 mic ) on the strong biofilm formers ( staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 ) whereas the biofilm former was significantly inhibited with 2 x mic tq supplementation. with this last concentration , the biofilm former of enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 decreased but was not wholly suppressed .
figure 1 microscopic visualization of the effect of thymoquinone on four biofilm positives strains cultured on glass slides covers .
prevention of biofilm formation effect of tq was as followed : for s. aureus atcc 25923 a , non treated slides ; aa , cells supplemented with tq mic ; aaa , cells supplemented with tq 2 x mic .
for s. epidermidis cip 106510 , b , positive control ( non treated slides ) ; bb , cells supplemented with tq mic ; bbb , cells supplemented with tq 2 x mic.for e. faecalis atcc 29212 , c , non treated slides ; cc , cells supplemented with tq mic ; ccc , cells supplemented with tq 2 x mic .
for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 , d , non treated slides ; dd , cells supplemented with tq mic ; ddd , cells supplemented with tq 2 x mic .
discussion based on our present results , tq exhibited a selective antibacterial effect against seven bacteria , particularly gram positive strains with low mics values ( table 1 ) .
this result correlate with kokoska et al. , [ 29 ] who reported that thymoquinone exhibited potent growth - inhibitory effect against gram - positive bacteria , with mics ranging from 8 to 64 mug / ml. bacteria in biofilm have been shown to be much more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic form [ 30 ] .
the success of natural compounds in inhibiting cell attachment is a promising tool for reducing microbial colonization on various surfaces [ 31 ] .
application of anti - adhesion agents appears to be a very interesting approach in the prevention of microbial infection [ 32,33 ] .
in order to find a natural compound able to inhibit and prevent microbial biofilm formation , we tested the effect of tq on four biofilm positives strains .
crystal violet assay showed that tq reduce the number of adherent bacteria and the bic50 was reached with 22 and 60 mug / ml for staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 respectively ( table 2 ) .
we noted also that the medium supplemented with 75 mug / ml of tq induce 90 % biofilm inhibition in the case of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 ( table 2 ) .
for enterococcus feacalis atcc 29212 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 , bics90 was higher than 100 mug / ml. a statistically significant inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 was noted after tq supplementation ( p < 0.001 ) .
prevention of biofilm formation by tq was also confirmed using xtt assay .
at 51 mug / ml tq supplementation , it exhibited a significant biofilm inhibition percentage of staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 that was more than 90 % ( table 2 ) .
in addition bic90 was reached with 90 and 145 mug / ml supplementation for staphylococcus epidermidis cip 106510 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 respectively ( table 2 ) .
the wilcoxon signed ranks test showed a statistical significant difference between the none treated and the treated cells with concentrations over 4 mug / ml ( p < 0.001 ) .
most antibiotics are up to 1000 - times less efficient against bacteria in biofilm than in suspension [ 34 ] , which makes tq a very promising treatment alternative .
inhibition of biofilm formation assessed by xtt do not correlate with crystal violet assay , similar result has been reported for plant extracts between the biomass and metabolic activity [ 6 ] .
our results revealed that tq efficiently kills staphylococci in suspension and prevent biofilms formation .
this effect on biofilm formation was confirmed by microscopic analysis of strains grown on the surface of glass slides covers .
we observed a biofilm inhibition when we inoculated the strain with a concentration of tq equal to mic and 2 x mic .
statistical analysis revealed a significant difference between the percentage of biofilm inhibition obtained after tq supplementation ( 2 x mic ) between treated cells and non treated ones ( p < 0.001 ) .
conclusion tq significantly affects pathogenic bacteria at low concentrations .
its antimicrobial and biofilm inhibition potencies allows us to suggest its inclusion in the arsenal of bioactive substances and subjecting it to further research , such as in vivo compatibility tests in many biological models .
however , further work needs to be done to determine the main mechanism by which tq affect biofilm formation .

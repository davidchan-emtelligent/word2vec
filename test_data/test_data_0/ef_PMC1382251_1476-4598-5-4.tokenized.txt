background dal - 1 ( differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung )/ 4.1b is a member of the protein 4.1 superfamily that has been shown to suppress growth in lung , breast and brain tumor cells .
in the case of the caspase - 3 deficient mcf - 7 breast cancer cells , this growth suppression has been shown to be partially mediated by the induction of apoptosis .
however the exact mechanism of action of dal - 1 / 4.1b is unknown .
recently , protein arginine n - methyltransferase 3 ( prmt3 ) was identified as a dal - 1 / 4.1b interacting protein .
protein arginine methyltransferases ( prmts ) posttranslationally methylate the arginine residues of proteins , a modification which has been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular processes including nuclear - cytoplasmic transport , signal transduction , and transcription .
results to investigate the role of protein methylation in cell death induced by dal - 1 / 4.1b , dal - 1 / 4.1b - inducible mcf - 7 cells were examined for apoptosis and caspase activation in the absence and presence of the protein methylation inhibitor adenosine dialdehyde ( adox ) .
flow cytometry analysis revealed that apoptosis was primarily associated with the activation of caspase 8 , and inhibition of this activation blocked the ability of dal - 1 / 4.1b to induce cell death .
conclusion these results suggest that protein methylation cooperates with dal - 1 / 4.1b - associated caspase 8 - specific activation to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells .
background differentially expressed in adenocarcinoma of the lung ( dal - 1 )/ 4.1b is a tumor suppressor gene belonging to the protein 4.1 superfamily [ 1 ] .
like other members of this family , dal - 1 / 4.1b localizes to the cell membrane and contains an n - terminal 4.1 / ezrin / radixin / moesin ( ferm ) domain [ 2 ] and spectrin / actin binding sequences .
when introduced into dal - 1 / 4.1b - null lung , breast and meningioma cancer cell lines , this protein 4.1 family member significantly suppresses growth , in part through the induction of apoptosis [ 1,3,4 ] .
however , the pathways via which dal - 1 / 4.1b exerts its growth suppressing properties are still poorly understood .
the ferm domain of the founding family member protein 4.1r has been found to associate with several membrane proteins , including erythrocyte band 3 , calmodulin , glycophorin c , p55 and spliceosome - associated picln [ 5 - 7 ] .
similarly , merlin / nf2 associates with several transmembrane proteins including cd44 via residues in the n - terminal ferm domain [ 8,9 ] .
the interaction of merlin / nf2 with cd44 has been shown to be critical for its growth suppression [ 8,10 ] .
hypothesizing that the unique binding partners for dal - 1 / 4.1b may help elucidate its mechanism of action as a negative growth regulator , yeast two - hybrid analysis was performed using the 336 residues of dal - 1 / 4.1b ferm domain and a fetal lung cdna library .
several strongly associating proteins , including 14 - 3 - 3 protein isoforms beta , gamma and eta [ 11 ] and protein arginine n - methyltransferase 3 ( prmt3 ) [ 12 ] were identified .
prmt3 and its family members post - translationally form asymmetric omega - ng , ng - ( type i enzymes ; prmt1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 ) or symmetric w - ng , n'g - ( type ii enzymes ; prmt5 ) dimethylarginine residues on proteins .
this protein modification has been shown to regulate transduction of signals to the nucleus , transcription regulation through nuclear receptors , and rna transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm [ 13 - 19 ] recently we have reported that dal - 1 / 4.1b regulates the methylation of substrates by prmt3 [ 12 ] and prmt5 [ 20 ] both in vitro and in cultured cells .
based on these findings , post - translational protein methylation may be one mechanism by which dal - 1 / 4.1b suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in mcf - 7 cells .
to address this , dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis and caspase activation were analyzed in both control and hypomethylated mcf - 7 cells .
these studies show that dal - 1 / 4.1b induces apoptosis via caspase 8 activation and that hypomethylation of cellular proteins increases apoptosis as well as dal - 1 / 4.1b protein levels .
these findings suggest that the interaction of the tumor suppressor dal - 1 / 4.1b and protein methylation pathway components is biologically important in controlling tumorigenesis .
results dal - 1 / 4.1b induces apoptosis in mcf - 7 cells via a caspase 8 dependent pathway previous work from this laboratory identified dal - 1 / 4.1b protein as a growth suppressor and apoptosis - inducing protein in mcf - 7 cells , which themselves do not express endogenous dal - 1 / 4.1b [ 3 ] .
in agreement with this finding , dal - 1 / 4.1b - inducible mcf - 7 cl27 cells underwent apoptosis when treated with 2 mum muristerone a for 48 hours to induce dal - 1 / 4.1b expression .
the presence of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein was confirmed by both western blot analysis and flow cytometry ( facs )( figure 1a and 1b ) .
tunel analysis revealed that 48 hours of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein expression induced apoptosis .
not all cells in the mcf - 7 cl27 clone express robust levels of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein , even after repeated subcloning .
therefore we also analyzed the sub - population of cells that showed high levels of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein .
in that analysis , apoptosis levels reached approximately 80 % ( figure 1c ) .
figure 1 induction of dal - 1 / 4.1b - expression in mcf7 cl27 cells induces apoptosis. a. western blot analysis showing the induction of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein in mcf - 7 cl27 cells following treatment with 2 mum muristerone for 48 hours. b. flow cytometric analysis confirming the induction of dal - 1 / 4.1b in cells treated with 2 mum muristerone ( clear peak ) as compared to untreated cells ( grey peak ). c. the level of apoptosis in the total cell population and in cells specifically expressing measurable levels of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein was determined by tunel assay and detected by facs .
to better understand the apoptotic mechanisms invoked in mcf - 7 cells upon expression of dal - 1 / 4.1b , global as well as specific caspase activation was examined .
fam - vad - fmk , a potent inhibitor of caspase activity that irreversibly binds to the reactive cysteine residue of the large subunit of caspases 1 - 9 , was incubated with mcf - 7 cl27 cells with or without induction of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein expression to assess global caspase activation .
these probes utilize carboxyfluorescein ( fam ) - labeled peptide fluoromethyl ketone ( fmk ) caspase inhibitors ( fam - peptide - fmk ) and allow the fluorescent detection of active caspases in living cell systems .
as shown in figure 2a , the presence of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein increased global caspase activation levels by 2.5 - fold suggesting that dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis proceeds through a caspase - dependent pathway .

clear bars represent untreated cells ; grey bars represent dal - 1 / 4.1b - expressing cells .
caspase 1 , p = 0.232 ; caspase 2 , p = 0.64 ; caspase 6 , p = 0.625 ; caspase 8 , p = 0.007 ; caspase 9 , p = 0.16 ; caspase 10 , p = 0.10 ; caspase 13 , p = 0.039. c. caspase 7 activation was investigated by western blot analysis of parp cleavage on proten lysates from uninduced and dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced mcf - 7 cl27 cells. d. inhibition of caspase 8 activation blocks dal - 1 / 4.1b - associated apoptosis in a dose - dependent manner .
this suggests that caspase 8 activation is critical for the induction of cell death by this tumor suppressor protein .
three main effector caspases , caspases 3 , 6 and 7 , are thought to be directly involved in the execution of caspase - dependent apoptosis .
importantly , mcf - 7 , as well as the derivative dal - 1 / 4.1b - inducible cl27 cell line , are caspase 3 - deficient [ 21 ] .
therefore , we tested the ability of dal - 1 / 4.1b expression to activate specific caspases other than caspase 3 and including caspases 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 13 .
using caspase specific binding peptides , only caspase 8 ( p = 0.007 ) showed highly statistically significant activation when compared with cells without dal - 1 / 4.b ( figure 2b ) .
caspase 7 is thought to function downstream of caspase 3 but in some cases , caspase - 7 can be activated in caspase - 3 deficient cells , inducing cleavage of parp [ 22 - 25 ] .
western blot analysis shows no parp cleavage in response to induced dal - 1 / 4.1b expression ( figure 2c ) , suggesting that caspase - 7 is not specifically activated during dal - 1 / 4.1b - associated apoptosis in these cells .
if caspase 8 is directly involved in dal - 1 / 4.1b - associated apoptosis , then inhibition of caspase 8 activation should prevent cells from dying in response to the presence of the dal - 1 / 4.1b protein .
in support of this hypothesis , incubation of dal - 1 / 4.1b - expressing mcf - 7 cl27 cells with the caspase 8 - specific inhibitor z - ietd - fmk resulted in blockage of apoptosis in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 2d ) .
incubation of cells with this inhibitor in the absence of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein had no effect .
several publications have previously documented the ability of caspase 8 activation to mediate the cleavage of downstream substrates and induce apoptosis in the absence of activation of downstream effecter caspases 3 , 6 and 7 [ 26 ] .
therefore , dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis in mcf - 7 cl27 cells may involve a caspase 8 - dependent pathway which functions independent of the major effector caspase pathways .
while our data suggests that caspase 8 is primarily involved in dal - 1 / 4.1b mediated apoptosis in mcf - 7 cells , the possibility that caspase 3 would also be activated , if present , was tested .
to this end , caspase 3 - expressing mcf - 7 cl27 cells were generated [ 21,27 ] and caspase 3 expression confirmed in several isolated clones ( figure 3a ) .
subsequent induction of dal - 1 / 4.1b expression in these clones ( as represented by cl27.11 in figure 3b ) did not enhance the previously measured level of apoptosis in these cells ( 8 %) [ 3 ] suggesting that dal - 1 / 4.1b - associated apoptosis does not require this major effector caspase .
figure 3 restoration of caspase 3 expression does not enhance dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis. a. western blot analysis of caspase - 3 - deficient mcf - 7 and dal - 1 / 4.1b - inducible cl27 cells .
cl 27.2 , cl 27.7 and cl 27.11 are caspase - 3 - expressing mcf - 7 dal - 1 / 4.1b - inducible clones. b. apoptosis levels measured up to 4 days after dal - 1 / 4.1b - expression in mcf - 7 cl 27.11 cells .
tunel positive cells were counted in a microscopic field of 200 cells as previously reported [ 3 ] the expression of caspase - 3 does not significantly alter the apoptosis levels over that previously shown in figure 2a for the caspase - 3 - deficient mcf - 7 cl27 cells .
protein methylation and dal - 1 / 4.1b cooperate to induce apoptosis in mcf - 7 cells given that dal - 1 / 4.1b has recently been shown to modulate the ability of the arginine methyltransferases prmt3 [ 12 ] and prmt5 [ 20 ] to methylate cellular substrates , we asked whether posttranslational protein methylation might also play a role in dal - 1 / 4.1b - associated apoptosis .
to address this , dal - 1 / 4.1b - inducible mcf - 7 cl27 cells were grown for 48 hours in the presence of 30 mum periodate - oxidized adenosine ( adox ) .
adox , an inhibitor of s - adenosylhomocysteine ( adohcy ) hydrolase , which elevates the levels of adohcy in cultured mammalian cells .
since adohcy is a product inhibitor of methyltransferases using adomet as the methyl donor , adox can reduce the activity of protein methyltransferases in cultured cells and consequently allow the accumulation of hypomethylated protein substrates .
hypomethylated mcf - 7 cl27 cell lysates were collected and the methylation status of endogenous prmt substrates analyzed by western blot using the anti - asymmetric dimethylarginine antibody asym 24 .
figure 4a shows that asymmetrically dimethylated proteins in mcf - 7 cl27 cells were significantly , although not completely , inhibited by treatment with 30 mum adox .
higher adox concentrations resulted in significant cellular toxicity ( data not shown ) .
figure 4 hypomethylation modulates apoptosis in mcf - 7 cl27 cells. a. western blot analysis with the anti - asymmetric dimethylarginine antibody asym24 ( upstate biochemical ) shows significant reduction in the methylation of proteins in mcf - 7 cl27 cells when treated with 30 mum adox for 48 hours. b. tunel and global caspase activation assays show that adox - associated hypomethylation specifically increases the percentage of apoptotic cells in the presence of dal - 1 / 4.1b protein .
grey bars show the percentage of apoptotic cells as measured by tunel .
black bars represent the percentage of global caspase activation .
to determine the effect of protein hypomethylation on dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis , mcf - 7 cl27 cells were induced to express dal - 1 / 4.1b protein in the presence of 30 mum adox and analyzed for apoptosis levels as well as global caspase activation .
while treatment with adox had no effect on apoptosis , protein hypomethylation significantly increases the induction of cell death by dal - 1 / 4.1b ( figure 4b ) .
this suggests that the modulation of protein methylation may be an important mechanism of dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis .
discussion apoptosis is traditionally characterized by a series of morphological features such as chromatin condensation , nuclear fragmentation , and the appearance of membrane - enclosed apoptotic bodies .
many proteins , including the caspase family of aspartate - specific cysteine proteases , have been reported to play a pivotal role in the apoptotic process [ 28 - 31 ] .
however , caspase - independent pathways are emerging [ 32 ] .
it has been shown previously that expression of the tumor suppressor dal - 1 / 4.1b can induce apoptosis in mcf - 7 breast cancer cells [ 3 ] but the mechanism ( s ) involved have not yet been identified .
more recently , it was reported that dal - 1 / 4.1b interacts with members of the protein arginine n - methyltransferase family ( prmts ) and modulates the posttranslational methylation of cellular substrates .
in addition , it was determined that dal - 1 / 4.1b was not itself a substrate for this post - translational arginine methylation [ 12 ] .
in this report , we examined the caspase - dependence of dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis and the effect of inhibiting protein methylation on this cell death in mcf - 7 cells , to determine if post - translational protein methylation is one potential mechanism through which dal - 1 / 4.1b exerts its growth suppressive properties .
previously [ 3 ] and in this report , induction of dal - 1 / 4.1b expression was shown to induce apoptosis in mcf - 7 cells .
examination of a series of caspases revealed that these apoptotic events occurred without activation of the three major effector caspases ( caspases 3 , 6 and 7 ) but did result in a significant increase in caspase 8 ( p = 0.007 ) activation .
the addition of the caspase 8 - specific inhibitor z - vad - fmk blocked the ability of dal - 1 / 4.1b to stimulate apoptosis in these cells in a dose dependent manner .
furthermore , restoration of caspase 3 expression did not increase the measured levels of apoptosis following dal - 1 / 4.1b expression demonstrating that this caspase is not activated even when present .
however , restoration of caspase - 3 expression was recently shown to sensitize mcf - 7 cells to radiation - induced apoptosis exhibiting the hallmarks of a traditional effector caspase activation pathway [ 33 ] .
our results suggest that cell death induced by dal - 1 / 4.1b expression does not proceed via a classic caspase activation cascade , but rather relies solely on one caspase , caspase 8 .
this lack of effector caspase activation in dal - 1 / 4.1b - induced apoptosis is intriguing .
activation of these caspases is one of the major characteristics in the programmed cell death process [ 34 ] .
however , some cells survive caspase activation , and accumulating evidence suggests that many caspase - activating apoptotic stimuli , including oncogenes , p53 , dna - damaging drugs , proapoptotic bcl2 - family members , cytotoxic lymphocytes , and in some cases even death receptors , do not necessarily require activation of the known effector caspases for programmed cell death to occur [ 35 ] .
activation of upstream caspases such as caspase 8 has been reported in both mitochondrial - independent and - dependent pathways [ 36 - 39 ] .
activated caspase 8 has been reported to trigger cell death by activating either effector caspases 3 , 6 or 7 , or dna damage enzymes such as endonuclease g and aif .
caspase - induced release of endog from mitochondria results in cell apoptosis .
li and colleagues [ 26 ] reported apoptosis with activated caspase 8 without activation of effector caspases .
a parallel condition - activated caspase 8 without activation of caspases 3 , 6 , or 7 - occurs when dal - 1 / 4.1b protein is expressed in mcf - 7 cells although preliminary studies did not show the release of endog into the cytoplasm ( data not shown ) .
caspase - 8 can also cross talk with calpain - dependent apoptotic pathways .
benjamin and colleagues found that both caspase - 8 inhibitor z - ietd and calpain inhibitors can protect mature mouse oligodendrocytes from cell death initiated by staurosporine , thapsigargin and kainite [ 40 ] .
their results suggest that crosstalk occurs between the caspase and calpain pathways , upstream of an irreversible cascade leading to cell death in mature oligodendrocytes .
the cross - talk between caspase 8 and calpain has also been identified in vascular smooth muscle cells during fas - associated apoptosis [ 41 ] .
dal - 1 / 4.1b could also induce apoptosis through membrane protein proteases such as calpains .
a related 4.1 family tumor suppressor , nf2 , has been shown to interact with calpains in neurofibromatosis - related tumors [ 42 ] .
in the case of the nf2 tumors , some patients lacking functional mutations in the nf2 gene have concomitant overactive calpain protease activity , which effectively degrades the existing nf2 protein , creating a " loss of tumor suppressor protein " - equivalent environment .
the potential relationship between dal - 1 / 4.1b and calpains and their relationship to apoptosis is important to examine further .
although protein methylation has been shown to be involved in such cellular processes as signal transduction and transcription [ 43 ] no evidence connecting protein methylation and apoptosis has been reported previously .
adox , an inhibitor of s - adenosylhomocysteine ( adohcy ) hydrolase , can inhibit methylation by elevating the cellular level of adohcy to inhibit the activity of methyltransferases [ 44 ] .
as adohcy is a general inhibitor of the once carbon metabolism pathway , its elevation could also inhibit dna as well as rna methylation events .
hypomethylation of cellular methyl - accepting protein substrates by adox has been demonstrated previously [ 44 - 49 ] and confirmed in this study ( figure 4a ) .
rat pheochromocytoma ( pc12 ) cells treated with 30 mum adox for 72 hours were found to undergo a 50 % decrease in growth rate [ 44 ] .
in the present analysis , apoptosis levels in mcf - 7 cells were not affected by the hypomethylating treatment of cells with 30 mum adox for 48 hours .
however , adox treatment appeared to enhance apoptosis when the dal - 1 / 4.1b protein was expressed in mcf - 7 cells .
rna methylation has also been shown to be altered by adox treatment [ 50 ] and such methylation could regulate protein synthesis [ 51 - 53 ] .
dal - 1 / 4.1b has previously been shown not to be a substrate for prmt3 - ( singh et al. , 2004 ) or prmt5 - mediated ( jiang et al. , 2005 ) arginine methylation but no information is currently available as to the presence of methylated dal - 1 / 4.1b mrna species .
further investigation into the relationship between dal - 1 / 4.1b , protein methylation and apoptosis is required to determine the exact mechanism ( s ) by which tumor cell growth and apoptosis are regulated by these proteins .
the determination that caspase 8 activation occurs in the absence of effector caspase activation suggests a potentially novel pathway combining aspects of both traditional caspase - dependent cell death and the emerging effector caspase - independent pathways of apoptosis .
furthermore , the interaction between a tumor suppressor ( dal - 1 / 4.1b ) and a post - translational methylation enzyme ( prmts ) is likely to be an important modulator of this pathway and so be of significant biological importance in controlling tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells .
conclusion in this report , caspase 8 - specific activation by the tumor suppressor dal - 1 / 4.1b is identified in the absence of activation of effector caspases 3 , 6 , or 7 , suggesting a potentially novel apoptotic pathway combining aspects of both traditional caspase - dependent cell death and the emerging effector caspase - independent pathways of apoptosis .
second it is shown that there is cooperation between dal - 1 / 4.1b and post - translational protein methylation in the induction of apoptosis in mcf - 7 cells .
this suggests that the previously published interaction between the tumor suppressor dal - 1 / 4.1b and the post - translational methylation enzymes ( prmts ) is likely to be an important modulator of this apoptotic pathway and so be of significant biological importance in controlling tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells .

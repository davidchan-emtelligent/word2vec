1 data in this data article , the data of the spr measurements using a system with protein g and immunoglobulin g1 ( igg1 ) as an analyte and a ligand , respectively , are measured .
the experimental data and the calculated curve according to equations described in ref .
[ 1 ] are presented ( fig. 1 ) .
the analytical centrifugation measurement of the analytes is documented .
2 experimental design , materials and methods 2.1 sample the variant of streptococcal protein g b1 domain ( q32h / d36e / n37h / d40h / e42h / d47p / a48e ) , pg0919 , designed and characterized previously [ 2 ] , is a monomeric igg - binding protein .
a tandem protein , in which two pg0919 are connected by a linker sequence ( unpublished ) , is regarded as the dimer of pg0919 .
pg0919 and the linked dimer of pg0919 , both of which were expressed in escherichia coli and purified as previously reported [ 2 ] , were used .
the lyophilized powder of the proteins was dissolved in water and dialyzed against hbs - t buffer solution composed of 0.01 m hepes , 0.15 m nacl , and 0.05 % ( v / v ) polyoxyethylene ( 20 ) sorbitan monolaurate ( ph 7.4 ) .
the ultraviolet absorption was measured by v - 730bio ( jasco co. ltd. , japan ) using a quartz cuvette with a 1 cm path length to determine the protein concentration .
the extinction coefficients at 280 nm , calculated based on the amino acid sequence [ 3 ] , were 1.551 cm - 1 ( g / l ) - 1 for pg0919 and 1.628 cm - 1 ( g / l ) - 1 for the linked dimer of pg0919 .
2.2 surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) spr measurement was performed with a biacore t200 ( ge healthcare uk ltd. , england ) .
10 kru ( response unit ; 1 ru = 1 pg / mm2 ) of a monoclonal humanized immunoglobulin g1 with a molecular weight of 148 kda was immobilized on a sensor chip cm5 ( ge healthcare uk ltd. ) .
hbs - t buffer solution was used for the measurement .
the temperature was set at 298 k. the concentrations of pg0919 and the linked dimer of pg0919 were 9.28x10 - 2 and 7.08x10 - 2 microg / ml , respectively .
2.3 analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity measurements were performed on a proteomelab xl - i ( beckman coulter , inc. , brea , ca ) with rotor speeds of 40 krpm at 293 k. absorbance at 280 nm was used to monitor the protein concentration in a double sector cell .
prior to the measurements , the proteins were dialyzed overnight against a buffer solution containing 0.01 m sodium phosphate and 0.15 m nacl ( ph 6.9 ) .
the initial protein concentrations were set at 0.6 and 0.5 mg / ml for pg0919 and the linked dimer of pg0919 , respectively .
the sedimentation velocity data were processed with the program sedfit using sedimentation coefficient distribution analysis [ 4 ] .
2.4 mathematical equations the additional amino acid residues introduced into the linked dimer of pg0919 make the molecular weight ( 18,375 da ) 2.86 times larger than that of pg0919 ( 6427 da ) , the monomer .
because the ratio between the molecular weights of the monomer and the linked dimer is non - natural number , the formulas for calculating a mass - dependent spr response described in the reference [ 1 ] are tuned and written here , although the essence of the formulation is identical .
when the analyte is a mixture of the monomer and the linked dimer , each of which has a one - to - one binding with a ligand , the spr response signal , r , is expressed as : ( 1 ) r = rp1 + rp2where the p1 and p2 subscripts designate the monomer and the linked dimer , respectively .
the time dependence of r is given by : ( 2 ) dr / dt = drp1 / dt + drp2 / dt,where drp1 / dt = mp1gkc,p1 [ p1bulk ] , drp2 / dt = mp2gkc,p2 [ p2bulk ] , m is the molecular weight of the analyte , g is a factor converting concentration to an r value , and kc is the mass transport coefficient .
[ p1bulk ] and [ p2bulk ] are the concentration of the monomer and the linked dimer , respectively , in the bulk .
the weight concentration of the monomer and the linked dimer are expressed by : ( 3 ) p1bulkw = mp1p1bulkand , ( 4 ) p2bulkw = mp2p2bulk. eq .
( 2 ) can be rewritten as : ( 5 ) dr / dt = gkc,p1p1bulkw + gkc,p2p2bulkw .
the total weight concentration of the analytes , [ pbulk ] w , is defined by : ( 6 ) pbulkw = p1bulkw + p2bulkw,where [ p1bulk ] w = ( 1 - gamma )[ pbulk ] w , [ p2bulk ] w = gamma [ pbulk ] w , and gamma is a constant ( 0 <= gamma <= 1 ). eq .
( 5 ) is rewritten as : ( 7 ) dr / dt = gpbulkw (( 1 - gamma ) kc,p1 + gammakc,p2 ). with respect to the spr response ( dr / dt ) exp experimentally determined , one can determine the concentration .
when all the analytes are assumed to be the monomer [ i.e. , gamma = 0 in eq .
( 7 )] , the determined concentration ( as a weight concentration ) , cwp , is : ( 8 ) cwp,gamma = 0 = dr / dtexp /( gkc,p1 ) , where cwp , gamma = 0 is cwp when gamma = 0 .
on the other hand , an exact concentration given by eq .
( 7 ) is : ( 9 ) cwp = pbulkw = dr / dtexp /{ g (( 1 - gamma ) kc,p1 + gammakc,p2 )} , the ratio between cwp and cwp , gamma = 0 is : ( 10 ) cwp / cwp,gamma = 0 = kc,p1 /(( 1 - gamma ) kc,p1 + gammakc,p2 )= 1 /( 1 - gamma + gamma ( kc,p1 / kc,p2 ) - 1 ) .
on the basis that the value of kc depends on the diffusion coefficient , d , of the analyte [ 2 ] , if the analytes are the linked dimer only [ i.e. , gamma = 1 in eq .
( 7 )] in actual , the ratio between cwp and cwp , gamma = 0 is : ( 11 ) cwp / cwp,gamma = 0 = kc,p1 / kc,p2 = dp1 / dp22 / 3 = sp1 / sp22 / 3mp1 / mp2 - 2 / 9,where s is ( f / f0 ) - 1v - 1 / 3 .
f / f0 and v are the friction factor and the specific volume , respectively , of the analyte .
when the friction factor and the specific volume of the monomer are the same as those of the linked dimer (( f / f0 ) p1 =( f / f0 ) p2 and vp1 = vp2 ) , eq .
( 11 ) is written as : ( 12 ) cwp / cwp,gamma = 0 = kc,p1 / kc,p2 = mp1 / mp2 - 2 / 9 = q2 / 9,where q is mp2 / mp1 .
in eq .
( 12 ) , the deviation of the concentration from the actual concentration is expressed as the ratio between kc,p1 and kc,p2 .
the meaning of eqs .
( 11 ) , ( 12 ) are equivalent to that of the equations , eqs .
( 23 ) - ( 24 ) , in ref .
[ 1 ] .
3 data analysis kc,p1 / kc,p2 is expressed as : ( 13 ) kc,p1 / kc,p2 = drp1 / dt / p1bulkw / drp2 / dt / p2bulkw.both ( drp1 / dt )/[ p1bulk ] w and ( drp2 / dt )/[ p2bulk ] w were experimentally available .
drp1 / dt and drp2 / dt were determined by the spr method .
[ p1bulk ] w and [ p2bulk ] w were determined by a ultraviolet absorption measurement .
the experimental data are shown in fig. 1. the experiments gave kc,p1 / kc,p2 of 1.31 +/ - 0.01 .
the error represents the uncertainty of the value in the fitting analysis. eq .
( 12 ) with q = 2.86 gives kc,p1 / kc,p2 of 1.26. by using the physicochemical parameters [( f / f0 ) p1 = 1.25 and ( f / f0 ) p2 = 1.56 determined by the present analytical ultracentrifugation , vp1 = 0.730 and vp2 = 0.716 cm3 / g calculated on the basis of the sequence [ 5 ] , eq .
( 11 ) gives kc,p1 / kc,p2 of 1.46 .
we also measured the spr of the solution of the mixture of the monomer and the linked dimer with gamma = 0.43. with respect to the relation : ( 14 ) drp1 / dt / p1bulkw / dr / dt / pbulkw = kc,p1 /(( 1 - gamma ) kc,p1 + gammakc,p2 )= 1 /( 1 - gamma + gamma ( kc,p1 / kc,p2 ) - 1 )= 1 /( 1 - gamma + gammasp1 / sp2 - 2 / 3q - 2 / 9 ) , the experiment determined the left side of the equation to be 1.11 +/ - 0.01 .
the right side of the equation is theoretically given as 1.10 and 1.16 with sp1 / sp2 = 1 and sp1 / sp2 = 1.24 , respectively , the latter of which was calculated by use of the physicochemical parameters .
the experimental and theoretical values were close to each other .

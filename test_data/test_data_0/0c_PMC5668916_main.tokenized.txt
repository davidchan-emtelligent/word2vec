background aquaporin - 8 ( aqp8 ) , a member of the aquaporin water channel family , is expressed in various tissue and cells , including liver , testis , and pancreas .
aqp8 appears to have functions on the plasma membrane and / or on the mitochondrial inner membrane .
mitochondrial aqp8 with permeability for water , h2o2 and nh3 has been expected to have important role in various cells , but its information is limited to a few tissues and cells including liver and kidney .
in the present study , we found that aqp8 was expressed in the mitochondria in mouse adipose tissues and 3t3 - l1 preadipocytes , and investigated its role by suppressing its gene expression .
methods aqp8 - knocked down ( shaqp8 ) cells were established using a vector expressing short hairpin rna .
cellular localization of aqp8 was examined by western blotting and immunocytochemistry .
mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential , oxygen consumption and atp level measurements .
results in 3t3 - l1 cells , aqp8 was expressed in the mitochondria .
in shaqp8 cells , mrna and protein levels of aqp8 were decreased by about 75 % .
the shaqp8 showed reduced activities of complex iv and atp synthase ; it is probable that the impaired mitochondrial water handling in shaqp8 caused suppression of the electron transport and adp phosphorylation through inhibition of the two steps which yield water .
the reduced activities of the last two steps of oxidative phosphorylation in shaqp8 cause low routine and maximum capacity of respiration and mitochondrial hyperpolarization .
conclusion mitochondrial aqp8 contributes to mitochondrial respiratory function probably through maintenance of water homeostasis .
general significance the aqp8 - knocked down cells we established provides a model system for the studies on the relationships between water homeostasis and mitochondrial function .
highlights * aqp8 was expressed in mouse adipose tissues and 3t3 - l1 preadipocytes .

* knockdown of aqp8 lowered routine and maximum capacity of mitochondrial respiration .
* knockdown of aqp8 reduced activities of complex iv and atp synthase in mitochondria .
* aqp8 contributes to maintain mitochondrial respirationprobably via water excretion .
abbreviations tmre , tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester fccp , carbonyl cyanide 4 - ( triflouromethoxy ) phenylhydrazone keywords aquaporin - 8 3t3 - l1 cells mitochondria adipocyte 1 introduction the major function of mitochondria is the production of atp by oxidative phosphorylation. through this process , a large amount of water is also formed .
at the last step of the electron transport chain ( etc ) mediated by cytochrome c oxidase ( complex iv ) , electrons are finally passed to oxygen to yield water .
in addition , atp synthase - mediated production of atp is coupled with equimolar formation of water .
thus , production of water as a byproduct of atp synthesis is inevitable and appropriate water handling is of crucial importance for the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity and function .
concerning the water transport across the mitochondrial membrane , channel mediated pathways such as aquaporins and the mitochondrial permeabilization pore have been postulated in addition to simple lipid bilayer diffusion .
however , the details of such facilitated pathways remain largely unknown and more information has to be obtained .
aquaporins ( aqps ) are a family of membrane transport proteins which play a role in water transport across biological membranes .
at least thirteen aqps ( aqp0 ~ 12 ) have been identified in mammals .
most of them are localized in the plasma membrane and are involved in water transport into and / or out of cells and specific functions of the cells ; reabsorption of water in proximal tubular cells , water permeability of the blood - brain - barrier , and salivary secretion [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
aqp8 was initially thought to be localized to the plasma membrane when it was cloned and identified in testis , liver , colon and heart [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
but later it was found to be present on the inner mitochondrial membrane of liver , kidney and neural stem cells and was expected to play a role in unconditional transport of metabolic water produced in mitochondria [ 7 ] .
aqp8 was recently reported to be involved in the mitochondrial transport of h2o2 in the hepatocytes [ 8 ] and nh3 in the renal tubular cells [ 9 ] and hepatocytes [ 10 ] .
however , the fact that aqp8 also shows high permeability to water comparable or superior to that of aqp1 [ 11 ] suggests its involvement in mitochondrial water flux .
to achieve a comprehensive understanding of aqp8 function , accumulation of experimental evidence in various types of cells is needed .
the mitochondrial type aqp8 was distinct from the plasma membrane form in terms of molecular weight .
in many cell types , aqp8 is simultaneously expressed in the plasma membrane and mitochondria .
in the liver and testis , the two organs which show most active aqp8 synthesis , aqp8 was detected by western blot analyses as two bands ; the band of about 28kda was observed in the inner mitochondrial membrane - enriched fraction [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] and the other one of about 34kda in the plasma membrane fractions [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
the 34kda band was converted to the 28kda band by n - glycosidase treatment [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
in this study , we found that , in mouse adipose tissues and 3t3 - l1 preadipocytes , the mitochondrial type aqp8 is dominantly expressed .
we therefore created an aqp8 - knocked down cell line in which we have investigated the role of aqp8 on mitochondrial function , and showed that knockdown of aqp8 leads to significantly impaired mitochondrial function , suggesting a significant role for aqp8 for normal mitochondrial bioenergetic homeostasis .

2.14 statistical analyses the data were expressed as mean +/ - s.d. the significance of the difference between the mean values of groups was evaluated by student 's t test .
results were considered significant if either * p < 0.05 or ** p < 0.01 3 results 3.1 aqp8 is expressed in 3t3 - l1 cells and mouse adipose tissues , and localizes to mitochondria in western blots ( fig. 1a ) , an aqp8 - immunoreactive band of 28kda ( arrow ) , corresponding to the molecular weight of the mitochondrial type aqp8 , was detected as the major one in 3t3 - l1 cells and adipose tissues of c57bl / 6j and balb / ccrslc mice .
additionally a minor band of about 38kda was observed in 3t3 - l1 cells. fig. 1b shows that the 38kda band was the major one in mouse liver homogenate and that a few minor bands in 30 - 38 kda range were observed in addition to the 28kda band in the liver .
the bands in 30 - 38kda were observed in the aqp8 - overexpressed 3t3 - l1 cells ( fig. 1b ) .
they were also expressed in wild type of 3t3 - l1 cells as extremely minor bands and were markedly reduced by n - glycosidase digestion ( fig. 1c ) , suggesting that all of them are glycosylated type aqp8s and that multiple species of glycosylated type aqp8 exist in mouse liver and 3t3 - l1 cells .
these results are consistent with previous reports indicating that liver expressed both types of aqp8 , that is , non - glycosylated and glycosylated types .
on the other hand , 3t3 - l1 cells and adipose tissues predominantly express the non - glycosylated type which has been considered to be expressed in mitochondria. fig. 1 expression of aqp8 .
a : western blotting of aqp8 in 3t3 - l1 cell lysate and homogenates of adipose tissue in c57bl / 6j and balb / ccrslc mice .

the molecular weight of the band pointed by the arrow was estimated to be approximately 28kda .
b : western blots for the expression of aqp8 in lysates of 3t3 - l1 cells and aqp8 - overexpressed cells ( oe ) and tissue homogenates of liver in c57bl / 6j mice .

c : n - glycosidase treatment of aqp8 proteins in 3t3 - l1 cell lysate .
aliquots ( 25 microg protein ) of the cell lysate were digested with (+) and without ( - ) n - glycosidase f for 24 , 48 , or 72 h at 37 degreesc .
the bands pointed by the arrow - head , which have molecular weights of 30 - 38 kda , were markedly reduced after the digestion. fig. 1 to confirm the mitochondrial localization of aqp8 in 3t3 - l1 cells , western blotting of purified mitochondria and mitoplast ( fig. 2 ) and immunofluorescence staining ( fig. 3 ) were performed .
in western blotting , the 28kda mitochondria type band was more intense in the mitochondria fraction and the mitoplast than in the whole cell lysate .
the same intensity pattern was observed with the inner mitochondria membrane marker complex iii and v. fig. 3 shows co - localization of aqp8 with mitochondrial marker proteins , cytochrome c and the voltage - dependent anion channel ( vdac ) .
especially , the aqp8 fluorescence coincided well with cytochrome c fluorescence .
the percentages of colocalized pixels with cytochrome c or vdac to all pixels of aqp8 were 90.6 +/ - 2.8 and 85.1 +/ - 5.8 % , respectively .
these results confirm that aqp8 is localized to the mitochondria in 3t3 - l1 cells. fig. 2 expression of aqp8 in mitochondria and mitoplast fractions in 3t3 - l1 cells .

fig.3 3.2 establishing stably aqp8 - knocked down cells to investigate the function of aqp8 in the mitochondria , we transfected the 3t3 - l1 cells with a plasmid coding shrna designed against aqp8 , and a clone with high ability of differentiation to adipocytes was selected and named shaqp8 .
the mrna level of aqp8 in the shaqp8 cells was less than 26 +/ - 4 % of control cells ( fig. 4a ) .
western blot analysis showed that the amount of the 28kda protein in shaqp8 cells was about 27 +/ - 7 % of that in the control cells ( fig. 4b ( a ) and ( b )) .
in shaqp8 cells , the band of 28kda was the major one and its intensity was increased in mitochondria and mitoplast fractions as observed in 3t3 - l1 cells , suggesting that the localization of aqp8 is the same as 3t3 - l1 cells ( fig. 4b ( c )). fig. 4 levels of the aqp8 expression in aqp8 - knocked down cells .

it was noticed that the mitochondria were swollen and were more electron - lucent in the shaqp8 cells ( fig. 10c and d ) , compared with in control cells ( fig. 10a and b ) .
the cristae in the mitochondria of shaqp8 cells , however , were still tightly packed .
these results suggest that aqp8 knockdown causes mitochondrial swelling , consistent with a role of aqp8 in the regulation of mitochondrial water permeability. fig. 10 electron micrographs of mitochondria .
typical transmission electron microscopy images of mitochondria in a control cell ( a and b ) and in an shaqp8 cell ( c and d ) .
the right images ( b and d ; scale bar , 200 nm ) show higher magnification on the left ( a and c ; scale bar , 1 microm ) , respectively. fig. 10 4 discussion it has been reported that adipocytes express aqp3 , 7 , 9 , 10 and 11 [ 24 ] on the plasma membrane .
these aqps are aquaglyceroporins , a subset of the aqp family , which has the permeability not only for water but also for glycerol , a substrate of lipogenesis and a product of lipolysis in adipocytes .
it appears that the aquaglyceroporins in adipocytes are responsible for the flux of water and glycerol across the plasma membrane [ 25 ] .
in this report , we demonstrated that adipose tissues and preadipocyte 3t3 - l1 cells also express aqp8 , which has permeability for water but not for glycerol .
the majority of aqp8 in adipose tissues and 3t3 - l1 cells was the unglycosylated type and was localized in the mitochondria .
based on these results , we considered that 3t3 - l1 cells would provide a model system for studying the role of aqp8 in the mitochondria .
we undertook knockdown of aqp8 in 3t3 - l1 cells and established a clone , shaqp8 , whose expression level was about one forth of the wild type .
the aqp8 - knocked down ( shaqp8 ) cells we established appeared to have impaired mitochondrial function .
it showed low routine level and low maximum capacity of respiration ( fig. 6a , c ) , while the protein levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes , complex i - v , was not altered ( fig. 8 ) .
these results suggest that the rate of oxygen consumption per unit of the electron transport chain was decreased in the shaqp8 cells .
the cellular atp level in shaqp8 cells was significantly reduced to approximately 85 % of that in controls , which had no apparent effect on the viability of cells ( fig. 9 ) .
the activities of two enzymes which produce water as a byproduct , cytochrome c oxidase and atp synthase , but not complex i , were significantly reduced by aqp8 knockdown ( fig. 7 ) .
this was not accompanied by changes in the expression levels of these proteins ( fig. 8 ) .
these observations lead us to the hypothesis that the reduced aqp8 expression disrupts normal mitochondrial water flux , and lowers electron transport activity and atp synthesis through inhibition of the water - generating processes ( fig. 11 ). fig. 11 predicted schema of mitochondrial dysfunction in aqp8 - knocked down cells .
in 3t3 - l1 cells , aqp8 is localized in the mitochondrial membrane and is responsible for the efflux of water generated by oxidative phosphorylation .
its knockdown results in impaired mitochondrial water efflux and inhibits complex iv of the electron transfer system and atp synthase , the steps in the atp synthesizing pathway which yield water as a byproduct .
the inhibition of complex iv results in reduced o2 consumption , and the inhibition of atp synthase , a consumer of the proton gradient , causes mitochondrial hyperpolarization. fig. 11 in shaqp8 cells , marked swelling of the mitochondria was observed by electron microscopy ( fig. 10c and d ) .
this implies that aqp8 is indeed responsible for water excretion from the mitochondria in 3t3 - l1 cells and that its knockdown affects mitochondrial function .
to clarify the precise mechanisms of mitochondrial swelling , further studies including three - dimentional analysis of the dynamic changes in mitochondrial morphology , measurement of intramitochondrial osmolarity and the activities of mitochondrial transporters are needed .
one of the factors which might affect mitochondrial volume regulation is the permeability transition pore ( ptp ) , which opens in response to various stimuli such as increase in intracellular ca2 + concentration and is accompanied by mitochondrial depolarization [ 26 ] .
in case of the shaqp8 cells , the mitochondrial membrane potential was rather hyperpolarized , which suggests that the opening of ptp is not the major cause of decreased mitochondrial function .
the effect of aqp8 knockdown appears to be different among cell types .
transient knockdown of aqp8 in hepg2 cells was reported to result in mitochondrial depolarization and cell death , which was attributed to reduced h2o2 extrusion from the mitochondria [ 8 ] .
in contrast , in shaqp8 cells , the mitochondrial membrane was hyperpolarized ( fig. 5 ) , and the cells were viable and differentiation towards adipocytes could be induced .
this might be related to difference in cellular localization and function of aqp8 ; in the hepatocytes , aqp8 was expressed both on the plasma membrane and in the mitochondria while , in 3t3 - l1 cells , aqp8 was localized to the mitochondria .
the adipose tissue has not received much attention in mitochondria research so far .
we report here , for the first time , that aqp8 is expressed in adipocytes .
aqp8 was expressed in the mitochondria and its suppression resulted in reduced mitochondrial respiration .
cellular mitochondrial density and expression level of proteins related to mitochondrial respiration increases during adipocyte differentiation [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] suggesting that mitochondrial respiration is essential for some adipocyte - specific function .
in addition , the relationships between mitochondrial dysfunction and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been studied [ 29 ] .
for example , inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in adipocytes by knocking down mitochondrial transcription factor a ( tfam ) or application of several mitochondrial respiration inhibitors induced insulin resistance [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] and impaired adipokine secretion [ 32 ] .
in this connection , several important questions remain to be answered. whether or not aqp8 is ( i ) co - regulated with the proteins in mitochondrial respiration , ( ii ) related to the specific function in adipocytes , and ( iii ) involved to pathological changes of adipocytes in type 2 diabetes .
the shaqp8 cells established in the present study should provide a useful experimental system for the investigation of these questions .

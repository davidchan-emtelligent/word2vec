case report we report the case of a 22 years old male patient , who presented with a vesicular eruption , bacterial over infected , with a group pattern distribution throughout the entire skin , evolving for approximately three months .
the patient was previously treated for this condition with systemic antibiotics , which he could not mention , being diagnosed with superficial folliculitis .
however , no improvement was noticed .
he denied unprotected sexual intercourse .
the patient was clinically examined and we performed routine tests , immunologic assays , bacteriological swab and skin biopsy .
general examination showed generalized , painless micropoly - lymphadenopathy and continuous muscle pain in the lower legs .
dermatological assessment of lesions revealed a disseminated eruption on the entire skin , including the face and penis sheath , consisting of erythematous plaques with the surface covered by crusts and vesicles arranged in groups , with various sizes ( diameter 1 - 3 cm ) and clearly defined edges .
the presumptive diagnosis was secondary syphilis , and in order to rule out the differential diagnosis of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta , eosinophilic folliculitis and systemic lupus erythematosus we performed a series of tests including immunologic assays , viral markers for hcv , serology for syphilis , bacteriological swab from the lesions and a skin biopsy .
the results were positive for syphilis and staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the lesions .
histopathological appearance of psoriasiform and lichenoid dermatitis with plasma cells was interpreted in the context of secondary syphilis , confirming our diagnosis .
the patient eventually admitted having multiple unprotected sexual contacts .
we tested for hiv ag / ac ( 1 + 2 ) , which was positive .
conclusion the patient was treated for syphilis in our department and he was referred to the infectious diseases hospital for proper evaluation and treatment for hiv infection .
the particularity of the case consists in the uncommon aspect of the eruption in this hiv - syphilis co - infection .
consent written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images .
a copy of the written consent is available for review by the editor of this journal .

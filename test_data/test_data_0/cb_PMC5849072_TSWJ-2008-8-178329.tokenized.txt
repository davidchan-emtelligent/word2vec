a case of a male fetus with sonographic diagnosis of hydrops fetalis at 19 - week gestation is reported .
the fetus had anasarca , bilateral massive pleural effusion , and ascites , in addition to cardiac arrhythmia and congenital gastric outlet obstruction .
mother 's clinical history and laboratory workup excluded immune hydrops .
the etiological dilemma and fetal outcome are discussed .
we concluded , based on this case , that when fetal hydrops occurs early and is associated with multiple congenital anomalies , prolonging the pregnancy may be futile .

background due to the importance of penicillium chrysogenum holding in medicine , the genome of low - penicillin producing laboratorial strain wisconsin54 - 1255 had been sequenced and fully annotated. through classical mutagenesis of wisconsin54 - 1255 , product titers and productivities of penicillin have dramatically increased , but what underlying genome structural variations is still little known .
therefore , genome sequencing of a high - penicillin producing industrial strain is very meaningful .
results to reveal more insights into the genome structural variations of high - penicillin producing strain , we sequenced an industrial strain p. chrysogenum ncpc10086. by whole genome comparative analysis , we observed a large number of mutations , insertions and deletions , and structural variations .
there are 69 new genes that not exist in the genome sequence of wisconsin54 - 1255 and some of them are involved in energy metabolism , nitrogen metabolism and glutathione metabolism .
most importantly , we discovered a 53.7 kb " new shift fragment " in a seven copies of determinative penicillin biosynthesis cluster in ncpc10086 and the arrangement type of amplified region is unique .
moreover , we presented two large - scale translocations in ncpc10086 , containing genes involved energy , nitrogen metabolism and peroxysome pathway .
at last , we found some non - synonymous mutations in the genes participating in homogentisate pathway or working as regulators of penicillin biosynthesis .
conclusions we provided the first high - quality genome sequence of industrial high - penicillin strain of p. chrysogenum and carried out a comparative genome analysis with a low - producing experimental strain .
the genomic variations we discovered are related with energy metabolism , nitrogen metabolism and so on. these findings demonstrate the potential information for insights into the high - penicillin yielding mechanism and metabolic engineering in the future .

issue - copyright - statement ( c ) biomed central ltd 2014 background penicillin and beta - lactam antibiotic play a significant role in human medical history [ 1 , 2 ] since fleming 's discovery of the filamentous fungus penicillium notatum in 1929 [ 3 ] .
the regulation of penicillin biosynthesis has been studied for many years , together with much more proteins or pathways were discovered [ 4 - 9 ] .
the improvement of p. chrysogenum strains to obtain higher penicillin yields is a main intense objective in industrial research [ 10 , 11 ] .
due to the importance of p. chrysogenum , the genome sequence of low - penicillin producer wisconsin54 - 1255 , which is widely used in laboratories , was sequenced and a number of genes responsible for key steps in penicillin production were identified [ 12 ] .
the precursors for penicillin biosynthesis , genes encoding microbody proteins and transporters were found , illustrating potential for future genomics - driven metabolic engineering [ 12 ]. through classical mutagenesis and screening methods , product titers and productivities of penicillin have dramatically increased since wisconsin54 - 1255 strain , but how low - penicillin producer strain was transformed into an efficient producer through improvement is still challenging .
for commercial reasons , the improvement of p. chrysogenum strains has never been stopped .
the productivity of industrial used strains is far more higher than their ancestor , and the progress was mainly obtained by classical mutagenesis and screening methods .
because mutations were random , most of the genetic changes in high yield strains were unclear .
although some significant structural variations ( svs ) [ 8 , 9 , 13 ] and differential expression profiling [ 12 , 14 , 15 ] have been found in high - penicillin producing strains , little is known about the underlying whole genomic changes between low - producing laboratorial strain and high - producing industrial strain .
to gain more insight into the genome structural variations of high - penicillin producing strain , we sequenced a chinese industrial strain ncpc10086 .
we also offer a comprehensive comparative genomics analysis [ 16 - 19 ] to find all mutations and large - scale structural variations between ncpc10086 and the first published genome of p. chrysogenum strain , wisconsin54 - 1255 [ 12 ] .
some variations including mutations , indels and structural variations were considered for their potential biological impact for penicillin biosynthesis .
our genome sequence data and analyses explore the differences between high - and low - yield p. chrysogenum strains and demonstrate the potential useful information to improve strains by direct genetic engineering tools .
results genome sequencing , assembly and general characeristics we sequenced the genome of p. chrysogenum ncpc10086 using a whole - genome shotgun sequencing strategy [ 20 , 21 ] .
owing to different sequencing technologies have various advantages and disadvantages [ 22 , 23 ] , we generated a high quality genome assembly using a combination of first and second generation sequencing platforms and strategies ( table 1 ) .
first , we generated single - end reads using roche 454 pyrosequencing platform [ 24 ] and mate - pair reads with 3 - 4 kb and 6 - 8 kb insert fragment sizes , using abi 3730 and megabace 1000 sanger sequencing platforms [ 25 ] , respectively .
then we generated mate - pair reads with 1 - 2 kb insert fragment size using illumina hiseq 2000 sequencing platform [ 26 , 27 ] and used all mate - pair reads to join contigs into scaffolds .
overall , we get 204x sequencing coverage of high quality reads for de novo assembly ( table 1 ) .

the length of longest contig is 1,655 kb , which indicates fine continuity of assembly .
owing to the deeper sequencing data , the contig n50 of ncpc10086 is 661 kb which is 70 % higher than wisconsin54 - 1255 ( 389 kb ) .
the scaffold n50 of our genome is 2.8 mb and the longest scaffold is 4,063 kb , illustrating our genome is suitable for structural variations detection , especially large - scale translocations .
the gene structures were predicted with a combined de novo and homology - based approach .
firstly , we masked all the repeat sequences in the genome and used fgenesh ( v 3.1.2 )[ 28 ] and genemark - es ( v 2.3e )[ 29 ] to provide an initial set of 11,284 predicted orfs .
secondly , we took advantage of the gene prediction results of wisconsin54 - 1255 [ 12 ] to revise and complement our predicted genes by homology searches .
at last , the former two results were integrated together , and 13,290 protein - coding genes were predicted in p. chrysogenum ncpc10086 genome ( table 2 ) .
gc content of the genome is 48.9 % and every 2,430 bp has one gene .
the mean gene length is 1,499 bp and most of the genes have introns .

we found 12,906 genes have homolog in nr , 9,371 genes have protein structural domains in interproscan , and 7,625 genes have homolog in swiss - prot / uniprotkb , and 6,831 genes can be classified in go. there are 6,140 genes can be annotated by all four gene annotation systems ( figure 1a ) , suggesting these genes are well studied .
the second large genes group is nr - specific with the number of 3,510 , which indicates functions of these genes are just beginning to be understood .
the following two large groups are 1,362 genes with homolog in swiss - prot database and 1,081 genes with protein domain in interproscan .
both of them cannot be assigned to go system , indicating functions of these genes are little known but ready for deeper investigation in some extent .
there are 6,831 genes can be assigned at least one go term for describing cellular component , biological process and molecular function classification ( figure 1b ) .

genome comparison analysis between p. chrysogenum ncpc10086 and wisconsin54 - 1255 p. chrysogenum wisconsin54 - 1255 is a low - penicillin producer strain widely used in libraries .
the genome sequence of wisconsin54 was well sequenced in 2008 , which is the first published genome of p. chrysogenum [ 12 ] .
the evolutionary relationship between wisconsin54 - 1255 and our sequenced high - penicillin strain ncpc10086 is very close .
here we offer a comprehensive genome comparison analysis between these two p. chrysogenum strains , and try to figure out some interesting genomics discrepancy .
to access comparative genomics statistics results , we aligned all the genes of wisconsin54 - 1255 to the scaffolds of ncpc10086 to detect gene mutations .
there are 12,943 predicted genes in wisconsin54 - 1255 and 13,290 predicted genes in ncpc10086. and we discovered 11,573 genes are identical between two strains , 89 % for wisconsin54 and 87 % for ncpc10086 , which indicates these two genomes are very conservative ( figure 2a ) .
as to the non - identical genes , 1,154 genes' identity are higher than 90 % , part of them leading to mutations , and only 22 genes have less than 60 % identity .
in addition , we complemented 64 genes , which are partial in wisconsin54 - 1255 and 514 noncoding sequence regions are redefined as protein - coding genes .
using wisconsin54 - 1255 genome sequence as a reference , we realigned 50x high - quality short reads of ncpc10086 from illumina hiseq 2000 to identify single nuclear variations ( snvs ) .
in order to differentiate sequencing errors from mutations , we used three thresholds to filter out unreliable mutation results : ( 1 ) we required at least five reads for each mutation ; ( 2 ) average quality of each mutation had to be higher than 20 ; ( 3 ) there had to be at least one pair of mate - pair reads to support .
we got 759 snvs in coding regions and 1,813 snvs in noncoding regions .
there are 135 snvs in intron regions , 177 are synonymous mutations and 447 are non - synonymous mutations , including 34 termination codon mutations .
all snvs result in coding region is described as figure 2b .
furthermore , we found 35 deletions and 19 insertions in exon regions , 86 copy number variations ( cnvs ) with the total size of 176,684 bp. the polymorphic genes with non - synonymous mutations are listed in additional file 1 .
figure 2 the single nuclear variations ( snvs ) statistics between ncpc10086 and wisconsin54 - 1255 .
( a ) we discovered 11,573 genes are identical and 759 snvs between two strains .
( b ) among them , 135 snvs take place in intron regions , 177 snvs are synonymous mutations and 447 snv are non - synonymous mutations including 34 termination codon mutations .
besides , we found 69 new genes that do not exist in the available genome sequence of wisconsin54 - 1255 [ 12 ] .
we analyzed these new genes carefully and figured out several metabolism , biosynthesis and degradation ( table 3 ) .
firstly , pch125g10680 , pch106g00010 , pch114g00050 genes involved in amino sugar , nucleotide sugar metabolism , n - glycan biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation may provide more energy in high - penicillin producer for penicillin synthesis .
secondly , we found another new gene , pch106g00010 , involved in nitrogen metabolism , which is up regulated strongly in cultures supplemented with the side chain precursor paa ( phenylacetic acid ) in high - producing strain [ 36 ] .
the last but not the least , the new gene , pch018g00010 , was discovered to participate in glutathione metabolism that may boost production of penicillin .
the biosynthesis of cysteine is precursor for the penicillin biosynthesis , and the genes involved in this pathway were over expressed in the high - penicillin producing strain [ 12 ] .
as to the previous study [ 37 ] , the increase in the cysteine biosynthesis requires a large nadph supply , but the oxidized glutathione under oxidative stress also requires nadph , which could reduce the cysteine biosynthesis .
so , we presume that glutathione metabolism may save nadph and indirectly promote the penicillin production .

[ 13 ] .
three penicillin biosynthetic genes , pcbab , pcbc and pende are gathered in this cluster ( figure 3a ) .
copy number and fragment arrangement are key features about pbc , which could impact on the yield of penicillin .
pbc was amplified five to sixteen copies in different high - penicillin producers , such as five or six copies for as - p - 78 and twelve to fourteen copies for e1 [ 13 ] ( figure 3b ) .
as to the low - productive strain wisconsin54 - 1255 , pbc just has one single copy with the length of 56.9 kb , consisting of a 53.7 kb fragment and a 3.2 kb shift fragment bounded by a conserved tgtaaa / t hexanucleotide [ 8 ] ( figure 3a ). through reads coverage detection method , we found seven copies of pbc in ncpc10086 with the length of 56.9 kb , including two copies for 110.6 kb fragment of d - - eg ' - - f'e ' - - d ' and 56.9 kb fragment of e ' - - d'f - - g , and one copy for 56.9 kb fragment of e ' - - d'g ' - - f ' ( figure 3b ) .
compared with the previous investigations [ 8 , 9 , 13 , 40 ] , one pbc fragment arrangement in ncpc10086 is unique and has never been reported before , orange bar and blue letters shown in figure 3b .
it is a 53.7 kb " new shift fragment " in our genome .
we believe the tttaca hexanucleotide and its inverse complement tgtaaa could be hot spots for site - specific recombination after mutation with nitrosoguanidine .
unfortunately , the length of pbc is so long that we cannot get the full precise arrangement of these copies .

( a ) pbc region of wisconsin54 - 1255 is about 56.9 - kb , consisting of 53.7 - kb fragment and 3.2 - kb shift fragment bounded by a conserved tgtaaa / t hexanucleotide .
( b ) pbc fragment arrangement schematic .
we discovered a new shift fragment in ncpc10086 , marked with orange bar and blue letters .
the genes involved in fungal secondary metabolic pathways share a common tendency towards physical cluster , with a preference for subtelomeric regions [ 41 ] .
the wide range of translocation is a very interesting phenomenon happened in industrial filamentous fungus , for example , aspergillus niger [ 16 ] .
comparison with wisconsin54 - 1255 , we found two large fragment translocations in ncpc10086 .
one is a 266 kb fragment in subtelomere ( position 5,739,429 - 6,005,263 in scaffold22 of wisconsin54 - 1255 ) transferred to the around centromere in ncpc10086 and the range of translocation is about 3 mb ( figure 4a ) .
to avoid the possibility of assembly error , we realigned mate - pair reads around the breakpoint of translocation and found enough reads to across the breakpoint ( figure 4b ) .
moreover , we did pcr identification around the breakpoint and only ncpc ( n ) has band with estimated size ( figure 4c ) .
this 266 kb fragment of translocation includes 107 genes from pc22g24360 to pc22g25450 and their mean genes size is 1,638 bp. unfortunately , the functions of most genes are unknown except for pc22g24480 ( nre ) , which encodes a regulator of nitrogen metabolite repression ( red boxed in figure 4a ) .
we hypothesize that the translocation of pc22g24480 may promote the nitrogen metabolism in ncpc10086 , corresponding to the " new " gene discovered in nitrogen metabolism , which is described earlier in this article .
another translocation is a 1,202 kb fragment ( position 387,513 - 1,589,522 bp in scaffold18 of wisconsin54 - 1255 ) transferred to scaffold072 of ncpc10086 starting at position 148,434 bp ( figure 5a ) .
the 1,202 kb fragment consists of 494 genes from pc18g01610 to pc18g06720 and their mean size is 1,480 bp. those genes associate with energy metabolism and peroxisome pathway , such as pc18g02420 , which encodes mitochondrial adp / atp carrier , and pc18g02550 , which encodes pex - 2 ( red boxed in figure 5a ) .
we also did mate - pair reads alignment around the breakpoint of translocation ( figure 5b ) and pcr identification ( figure 5c ) to certificate this translocation .

at last , we focused on some genes involved in homogentisate and the regulators of penicillin biosynthesis .
table 4 shows the comparison results of these genes between wisconsin54 - 1255 and ncpc10086 .
paha gene encodes a phenylacetate 2 - hydroxylase that catalyzes the first step of phenylacetate catabolism , decreasing the precursor availability for penicillin biosynthesis [ 42 ] .
owing to a point mutation ( c598 - - > t ) in paha gene , the homogentisate pathway for paa catabolism has been reported to be largely inactivated but the penicillin yield is increased in wisconsin54 - 1255 [ 42 ] .
based on the comparative genomics analysis , we found paha gene was shown in a 27.1 kb translocation , but paha gene is identical between the two strains .
three other genes , pahb ( pc22g02230 ) , pahc ( pc16g01770 ) and pahd ( pc21g22560 ) , are strongly similar to paha and all of them belonging to cytochrome p450 monooxygenases .
for pahc gene , there is a mutation ( g482 - - > c ) causes a single amino - acid substitution at position 129 of the protein : an alanine residue in strain wisconsin 54 - 1255 has been substituted to proline in ncpc10086 strain ( a129p ) .
for pahd gene , we found a synonymous mutation ( c1976 - - > t ) .
all the promoter sequences of these genes are all the same .
pclaea gene was found as a global regulator of secondary metabolism , including penicillin biosynthesis , sporulation and pigmentation in p. chrysogenum [ 43 ] , which is identical in sequence in the genome of wisconsin54 - 1255 and ncpc10086 with the same copy number .
due to pclaea gene encodes a velvet - like complex , we checked another velvet - like complex pcvela .
its corresponding pcvela gene is a key regulator of metabolism , acting both as an activator and repressor of secondary metabolism in p. chrysogenum [ 44 ] .
there is a mutation ( c1002 - - > t ) in pcvela gene of ncpc10086 causes glutamine315 to stop codon ( q315stop ). through functional domain scanning , we can see that position 28 - 238 is velvet factor non - mutated .

a total genome size of 32.3 mb was assembled with contig n50 of 661 kb and scaffold n50 of 2.8 mb. the gene structures were predicted with a combined de novo and homology - based approach , and annotated by four gene annotation systems. by whole genome comparative analysis , we observed a large number of mutations , insertions and deletions , and structural variations .
there are 69 " new " genes that not exist in the genome sequence of wisconsin54 - 1255 and some of them are involved in energy metabolism , nitrogen metabolism and glutathione metabolism .
as was expected , the high - penicillin producing strain needs more energy for penicillin synthesis , sorting , transport and processing , and we confirm some new genes participate in it. one " new " gene was discovered in nitrogen metabolism , which is up regulated strongly in cultures supplemented with the side chain precursor paa ( phenylacetic acid ) in high - producing strain [ 36 ] .
both cysteine biosynthesis and the oxidized glutathione need nadph , if glutathione metabolism is more active , nadph could be reserved for more cysteine biosynthesis to improve the penicillin production .
our " new " gene involved in glutathione metabolism may impact on this process .
the penicillin biosynthetic genes cluster ( pbc ) is the well - known dominant core for penicillin production existing in all strains ; copy number and fragment arrangement are the key features for pbc .
the high - penicillin producing strain , ncpc10086 , has seven copies of pbc and one 53.7 kb " new shift fragment " with unique arrangement type .
the tttaca sequence and its inverse complement tgtaaa sequence could be hotspots for site - specific recombination after multiple mutations .
this process may aim to repair damage from mutations by nitrosoguanidine .
we found two large translocations in ncpc10086 ; one is a 266 kb fragment in subtelomere transferred to centromere including genes regulating nitrogen metabolite repression ; another is a 1,202 kb fragment consists of a mitochondrial adp / atp carrier involved in energy metabolism and peroxin - 2 gene involved in peroxysome pathway .
due to our comparative genomics statistics results , we predicted that energy metabolism and nitrogen metabolism plays an important role in penicillin production together with glutathione metabolism and peroxysome pathway .
to further analysis genes involved in those processes , we looked into two types of genes deeper , paha gene set and velvet - like complex genes .
translocation , stop codon mutation , synonymous and non - synonymous mutations are found there .
these variations may impact the homogentisate pathway for paa catabolism as well as global regulation of secondary metabolism , including penicillin biosynthesis , sporulation and pigmentation .
we found out many mutations and structural variations , but how many of them and how they affect the penicillin yield is still a formidable challenge .
efficient approaches to narrow down the possibilities are to sequence more genomes for common variations and system biological investigation using " omic " data [ 45 ]. through genome resequencing and functional analysis , identification of precise mutations in strains with altered phenotypes will add insight into specific gene functions and guide further metabolic engineering efforts .
conclusions this is the first high - quality genome of high - penicillin producing industrial stain of penicilliumchrysogenum , which can provides abundant genetic information for broad biomedical researchers. through comparative genomics analysis with low - producing strain , we found a lot of mutations , insertions and deletions , and structural variations .
moreover , we showed some " new " genes not existent in the public genome sequence of wisconsin54 - 1255 involved in energy metabolism , nitrogen metabolism and glutathione metabolism .
most remarkably , for the penicillin biosynthesis cluster , we are surprised to find a 53.7 kb new " shift fragment " in our high - producing strain and the type of fragment arrangement is unique .
in addition , we addressed a 266 kb translocation including a regulator of nitrogen metabolite repression and a 1,202 kb translocation including genes involved in energy metabolism and peroxysome pathway .
our findings lay a foundation for the insights into the high - penicillin producing mechanism and metabolic engineering in the future .
methods source of sample and culture conditions p. chrysogenum ncpc10086 strain was selected for genome sequencing as it was commercialized in north china pharmaceutical group corporation .
spore suspensions of ncpc10086 were inoculated in 40 ml of seed medium ( 20 g / l sucrose corn steep liquor , 20 g / l sucrose , 5 g / l yeast extract , 5 g / l caco3 , ph 5.8 ) in 250 ml flasks and incubated on a rotary shaker ( 250 r.p.m. ) at 26degreesc for 24 h. two milliliters of seed culture were transferred to 40 ml of fermentation medium ( 35 g / l lactose , 30 g / l corn steep liquor , 5 g / l ( nh4 ) 2so4 , 1 g / l kh2po4,1 g / l , k2so4 , 10 g / l caco3 , 2 g / l phenylacetic acid , 6 ml / l corn oil , ph 6.0 ) and grown at 26degreesc with shaking at 250 r.p.m. genome sequencing and assembly the genome of p. chrysogenum ncpc10086 strain was sequenced by whole genome random sequencing method [ 20 , 21 ] .
we used roche 454 gs flx system to produce 18x coverage single - end reads with an average read length of 410 bp to do contig assembly .
moreover , 3 - 4 kb and 6 - 8 kb mate - pair libraries were produced to do contig and scaffold assembly , with 5x coverage sequenced by abi 3730 system and 1x coverage sequenced by megabace1000 system .
abi 3730 and megabace1000 produced an average read length of 659 bp and 739 bp respectively .
phred and phrap [ 46 , 47 ] were used to deal with the raw data from abi 3730 and megabace1000 .
hybrid assembly was performed using newbler [ 24 ] with all single - end and mate - pair reads by overlap - layout - consensus strategy .
after assembly , we aligned our contigs to the reference sequence [ 12 ] to predict the gaps sizes distribution in our genome .
according to the gaps size distribution , we designed 1 - 2 kb mate - pair inserted fragment library to do scaffolding .
we mapped the mate - pair high quality reads onto the scaffolds and used the reads to fill the gaps if one of the mate - pair reads located at the edge of gaps .
at last , redundant sequences were deleted through self - alignment .
gene prediction and annotation the repeat sequences of p. chrysogenum ncpc10086 were masked throughout the genome using repeatmasker ( v 3.3.0 ) and the repbase library ( 20120418 ) [ 48 ] with tandem repeats finder ( v 3.2.1 )[ 49 ] .
the gene structures were predicted with a combined de novo and homology - based approach .
firstly , for all repeat - masked scaffolds larger than 1 kb , fgenesh ( v 3.1.2 )[ 28 ] and genemark - es ( v 2.3e )[ 29 ] were performed on the whole genomic sequence to provide an initial set of predicted orfs .
fgenesh is trained on sequences of penicillium funiculosum and genemark - es is upon the self - training algorithm for fungal genomes .
preference was given to fgenesh genes , and all predicted protein should be larger than 10aa .
secondly , we use the gene prediction results of p. chrysogenum wisconsin54 - 1255 to revise and complement our predicted genes by homology searching .
at last , the former two results were integrated together as predicted genes .
all predicted proteins were blastp [ 50 ] against databases of genbank 's non - redundant proteins , interproscan [ 30 ] , swiss - prot / uniprotkb [ 32 ] and gene ontology ( go ) , and the best alignment of every protein was considered its annotation .
no alignment results by blastp of predicted proteins were automatically considered as hypothetical proteins .
we presented unique and shared proteins among four gene annotation systems by venn diagram ( http :// bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es / tools / venny / index.html ) .
wego [ 51 ] was used to plot go annotation results .
the pathway analysis is carried out by kaas ( v 1.67x ) with sbh method [ 52 ] .
calling single nuclear variations ( snvs ) , insertions and deletions ( indels ) and copy number variation ( cnvs ) based on the assembled p. chrysogenum wisconsin54 - 1255 , we realigned all of the high - quality reads with the genome by soap ( v 2.21 ) [ 53 ] to identify the snvs .
in the reads gap - free alignment process , at most two mismatches were allowed between a read and the reference , and best hits were selected .
multiple reads mapping results were filtered .
we use soapsnp ( v1.03 )[ 54 ] , a statistical model based on bayesian theory and illumina quality system , to calculate a probability for each possible genotype at each position on the reference genome .
we used five thresholds to filter out unreliable snv results : ( 1 ) we required at least five reads for each snv ; ( 2 ) average quality of each snv had to be higher than 20 ; ( 3 ) the overall depth had to be less than 150 ; ( 4 ) the approximate copy number of flanking sequences had to be less than 2 ( to avoid misreading snv caused by the alignment of similar reads from repeat units or by copy number variations ) ; ( 5 ) there had to be at least one pair of mate - pair reads to support .
for indel detection , we use pindel ( v0.2.4 ) [ 55 ] to find breakpoints of large deletions and medium - sized insertions from paired - end or single reads .
the short reads alignment is by bwa - backtrack ( v0.5.9 ) [ 56 ] and long reads is by bwa - sw [ 57 ] .
we use sam tools ( v0.1.17 ) [ 58 ] to manipulate alignments in the sam format .
copy number variations detection is by cnv - seq [ 59 ] which is based on a robust statistical model with 50x high - quality reads from illumina hiseq 2000 .
identification of structural variations we used blat ( v 34 ) [ 60 ] with default parameter to align scaffolds of p. chrysogenum ncpc10086 to the reference , whole genome of p. chrysogenum wisconsin54 - 1255 , to search colinearity between them .
the alignment results of each scaffold indicate a candidate location of the scaffold .
for scaffolds with multiple hits , the top ten hits with highest sequence similarity remained as candidate locations .
the alignment with the longest matches in a linear orientation between a scaffold and the reference was picked as ' best - hit ' of the scaffold .
after finding structural variations , we use blastn with parameter ' 1e - 5 ' to check the detail alignment results .
we randomly pick up 20x mate - pair reads from 180x high - quality illumina hiseq 2000 reads .
reads mapping is by soap ( v 2.21 ) [ 53 ] and the alignment result is visualized by mapview ( v 3.4.1 ) [ 61 ] .

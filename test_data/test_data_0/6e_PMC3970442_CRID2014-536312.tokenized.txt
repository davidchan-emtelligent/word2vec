this is an atypical case report of a 20 - year - old male patient who suffered from unusual unilateral , gingival enlargement together with rapidly progressive alveolar bone loss .
the enlarged gingiva completely covered his left posterior teeth in both arches .
the patient was diagnosed with gingival fibromatosis and aggressive periodontitis based on the clinical , histological , and radiographic findings .
the gingival enlargement was treated by conventional gingivectomy under local anaesthesia .
the postoperative result was uneventful .
1. introduction gingival fibromatosis , gingivomatosis [ 1 ] , diffuse fibroma [ 2 ] , familial elephantiasis [ 3 ] , idiopathic fibromatosis , hereditary gingival hyperplasia , gigantism of gingiva , and hypertrophic gingiva are slowly progressive fibrous enlargements of the maxillary and mandibular gingiva .
gingival fibromatosis may be an inherited condition as in hereditary gingival fibromatosis or may be associated with medications or may be idiopathic .
it may also be caused by inflammation or leukemic infiltration .
the gingival fibromatosis may occur as an isolated finding or be associated with one of several hereditary syndromes , for example , rutherford 's syndrome , jones' syndrome , murray - puretic - drescher syndrome , laband syndrome , ramon 's syndrome , hypothyroidism , and so forth [ 4 ] .
the syndromic characteristic most commonly seen in association with hereditary gingival fibromatosis is hypertrichosis [ 5 ] .
it is characterized by massive gingival enlargement that appears to cover the tooth surfaces .
the enlargement may be associated with one or more teeth , involve one or more quadrants , or may be generalized .
the cause of enlargement is unknown but there appears to be a genetic predisposition .
gingival hyperplasia produces conditions favorable for the accumulation of plaque and materia alba by accentuating the depth of gingival sulcus and by interfering with effective hygiene measures .
the secondary inflammatory changes further increase the size of the preexisting gingival hyperplasia [ 6 ] .
aggressive periodontitis is a genetically inherited disease that represents a severe and rapidly progressive form of periodontitis [ 7 ] .
this form of periodontitis presents peculiar clinical presentation , occurring around puberty with an apparent lack of local factors such as heavy amounts of plaque and calculus in patients with reasonably good oral hygiene .
aggressive periodontitis is characterized by the following major common features : early age of clinical manifestation , noncontributory medical history , rapid attachment loss and bone destruction , familial aggregation .
this paper presents a rare case of a nonsyndromic idiopathic gingival enlargement associated with aggressive periodontitis and its management .
2. case report a 20 - year - old male patient reported at the department of periodontology , seema dental college and hospital , rishikesh , with chief complaint of gingival swelling around left upper and left lower posterior teeth and inability to chew food from the left side .
patient gave history of trauma to the left side of his face three months ago after which the gingival swelling first appeared and gradually increased to its present size .
however , no correlation was found between trauma and gingival enlargement .
the patient came for treatment only when the swelling started interfering with mastication .
medical history was non contributory in this case .
he could not provide adequate family history as he was illiterate and was not able to provide the details .
upon intraoral examination , gingiva seemed to be grossly enlarged on left side .
the gingival enlargement extended from first premolar to second molar region in both maxillary arch ( figure 1 ) and mandibular arch ( figure 2 ) .
the enlargement was firm and fibrotic accompanied by an inflammatory component probably due to his inability to maintain adequate personal oral hygiene .
the gingival enlargement extended from the buccal to the lingual palatal mucosa .
the diffuse type of enlargement involved marginal , interdental , and attached gingiva .
the periodontal probing revealed deep pockets in relation to the involved teeth .
mobility was also present in all the involved teeth .
2.1 .
radiological examination panoramic view revealed presence of remaining bone in the range of 30 to 35 % on left side of both arches .
bone loss was severe in relation to maxillary left first molar and mandibular left first molar ( figure 3 ) .
2.2 .
hematological examination routine hematological investigations revealed hemoglobin 12.6 % and differential leucocyte count of polymorphonuclear leukocytes 75 % , lymphocytes 23 % , monocytes 0 % , eosinophils 2 % , and basophils 0 % .
2.3 .
histological examination incisional biopsy was performed which showed stratified squamous epithelium overlying the connective tissue stroma .
in few areas , flattening of the rete ridges was seen whereas in other areas they appeared elongated .
the connective tissue appeared densely collagenized and was seen to be interspersed with plump - and spindle - shaped fibroblasts .
few chronic inflammatory cells mainly consisting of lymphocytes were seen dispersed throughout the section .
areas of small - to medium - sized endothelial lined blood vessels were also evident ( figure 9 ) .
based on the above findings , the diagnosis of gingival fibromatosis along with aggressive periodontitis was established .
2.4 .
treatment initial therapy comprised of conventional periodontal therapy .
the enlarged tissue was removed by the external bevel gingivectomy under local anesthesia .
the surgery was performed in two stages , left maxillary arch in the first stage ( figures 4 and 5 ) and left mandibular arch in second stage ( figure 6 ) .
the gap between the two procedures was three weeks .
periodontal dressing was applied .
antibiotics , fortified b - complex , and anti - inflammatory agents were prescribed for one week .
postsurgical healing was uneventful .
periodontal dressing was removed after one week .
the surgical area was generously irrigated with betadine and normal saline .
postoperative instructions were reinforced and patient was recalled after one week and then after one month for postsurgical evaluation .
healing was uneventful after one month ( figures 7 and 8 ) .
patient was satisfied with the result .
2.5 .
discussion gingival fibromatosis is seen frequently to be associated with various syndromes .
it has been associated with rutherford 's syndrome , laband syndrome , cross syndrome , murray - puretic - drescher syndrome , jones' syndrome , hypertrichosis , and epilepsy .
it can also be caused by a number of factors , including inflammation , leukemic infiltration , and use of medications such as phenytoin , cyclosporine , or nifedipine .
this paper reports a case of severe gingival enlargement on left posterior region in both arches .
blood investigation did not reveal any abnormality .
the clinical and histological features and systemic examination excluded the diagnosis of neoplastic enlargement .
gingival hyperplasia occurs in some patients taking certain drugs such as phenytoin , cyclosporine , and nifedipine .
the patient had not taken any of these drugs .
the patient was normal without any symptoms of mental retardation .
he did not suffer from epilepsy or hypertrichosis nor did he have any tumors or corneal dystrophy .
no skeletal deformities or defects of the skin or fingernails were observed .
thus , it is unlikely that the syndromes mentioned earlier were related to this gingival enlargement .
in many types of gingival enlargement , the rapid loss of alveolar bone or attachment level is not observed .
however , this patient exhibited rapidly progressive destruction of the periodontal tissues .
alveolar bone loss was observed in his oral radiograph .
there was a lack of clinical inflammation despite the presence of deep periodontal pockets and advanced bone loss .
the amount of plaque on the affected teeth was minimal , which seemed inconsistent with the amount of periodontal destruction present .
in this case , the patient is a young 20 - year - old male , with a noncontributory medical history and severe bone destruction relating it to the diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis .
regarding familial aggregation , patient was not able to explain properly about family members as he belongs to a nearby village and was an illiterate person .
the first case of this kind was reported in 2004 by casavecchia et al .
[ 8 ] .
before 2004 , no such case was reported .
historically , gingival fibromatosis has been reported to be an associated finding with various other syndromes or disorders but has not been reported in coexistence with aggressive periodontitis .
they performed genetic analysis as well as analysis of neutrophil function but could not establish the common mechanism , if any , that could be involved in the pathogenesis of these two entities .
after casavecchia et al. , three such cases have been reported where there was nonsyndromic , idiopathic gingival enlargement associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis [ 9 - 11 ] .
aggressive periodontitis is typically characterized by familial aggregation because of evidence of genetic predisposition that was derived from segregation analysis of affected families .
mendelian inheritance occurs and autosomal ( dominant and recessive ) transmission and x - linked transmission have been proposed [ 11 ] .
this patient had a diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis with idiopathic gingival fibromatosis based on his clinical findings and no significant family history .
the results of the histopathologic evaluation in this case revealed the features of fibrous gingival hyperplasia , that is , the presence of a thickened acanthotic epithelium with elongated rete ridges and densely arranged collagen bundles with numerous fibroblasts and with some areas of neovascularization .
the treatment need varies according to the degree of severity ; when the enlargement is minimum , thorough scaling of the teeth and home care may be essential to maintain good oral health .
the relative increase in the gingival mass contemplates the need for surgical intervention .
in the past , treatment included extraction of all involved teeth and reduction of alveolar bone .
many techniques have been used for excision of enlarged gingival tissues including external or internal bevel gingivectomy in association with gingivoplasty , an apically positioned flap , electrocautery , use of twelve fluted carbide bur in high speed hand piece , and co2 laser [ 5 ] .
however , the most widely used method of removing large quantities of tissue is the conventional external bevel gingivectomy [ 12 ] .
recurrence is a common feature over varying periods .
in several reported cases , there was no recurrence in a period of 2 years [ 13 ] , 3 years [ 14 ] , or even 14 years [ 15 ] of followup .
for the present case , external bevel gingivectomy under local anaesthesia was done in both maxillary and mandibular arches .
healing was uneventful and patient was satisfied .
patient was told about recurrence and was instructed to follow routine oral hygiene measures strictly to prevent recurrence .
3. conclusion this is a rare case presentation of a true combined lesion of gingival enlargement with generalized aggressive bone destruction , which is not a common feature seen together .
diagnosis was based primarily on clinical radiographic and histopathologic assessments .
however , further research including immunological and genetic testing is needed to establish association between the two conditions .

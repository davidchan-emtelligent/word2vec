to investigate the utility of fundus autofluorescence ( faf ) and optical coherence tomography ( oct ) in the evaluation of cystoid macular edema ( cme ) following cataract surgery .
materials and methods .
forty eyes of 29 patients undergone phacoemulsification , with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation surgery .
central macular thickness ( cmt ) of the patients was evaluated using oct and faf preoperatively and postoperative 1st , 30th , 60th , 90th , and 180th days. results .
cme was detected in three eyes ( 7.5 %) of two patients using oct .
hyperautofluorescence ( haf ) was detected in two of these three eyes and resolved with treatment .
in the remaining 37 eyes without cme , there was a significant increase in visual acuity when compared to preoperative values ( p = 0.008 ) mean macular thicknesses ( mmt ) of the eyes without cme were 174 +/ - 20 mum preoperatively and 179 +/ - 22 mum at day 1 , 178 +/ - 19 mum at 1st month , and 168 +/ - 10 mum at 6th month postoperatively .
in the eyes with cme , the mmts , measured with oct were 189 +/ - 23 mum preoperatively and 432 +/ - 361 on day 1 , 343 +/ - 123 mum at 1st month , 345 +/ - 196 at 2nd month , and 200 +/ - 36 mum at 6th month postoperatively. conclusion .
we found a moderate increase in cmt in the first 3 months postoperatively , in the eyes without cme which did not cause visual disturbances .
faf is a noninvasive , rapid method for the evaluation and follow - up of cme following cataract surgery .
1. introduction cystoid macular edema ( cme ) is the formation of fluid - filled cystoid spaces between the outer plexiform and inner nuclear layers of the retina , resulting from disruption of the blood - retinal barrier .
it is a common complication observed after cataract surgery , with or without other complications .
the rate of cme increases in the presence of diabetic retinopathy and uveitis .
although the pathogenesis is still not fully understood , the diagnosis is usually easily confirmed by clinical or angiographic examinations. with modern surgical techniques the incidence of cme has decreased to 1 % [ 1 , 2 ] .
the incidence of angiographic cme , without clinical macular edema , has been reported to be around 10 - 20 % following cataract surgery .
while it usually occurs 4 - 12 weeks following surgery ; there are a few cases reported after many months or years after the surgery [ 3 ] .
optical coherence tomography ( oct ) is a noninvasive and quantitative imaging modality , which provides cross - sectional images of the retina , with the help of ~ 800 nm diode laser light [ 4 - 7 ] .
oct has become an important diagnostic method , especially in retinal diseases , such as cme , diabetic macular oedema , macular hole , and glaucoma .
autofluorescence ( af ) can be defined as light scatter from the structures in the eye , without the use of fluorescein dye .
fundus autofluorescence ( faf ) arises from lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) cells [ 8 ] .
hyper - autofluorescence ( haf ) in cme occurs as a result of the displacement of macular pigments into the cystoid gaps .
haf also occurs when inflammation triggers the pro - oxidative pathway .
blue light with a wavelength of 488 nm is used for faf imaging using heidelberg retinal angiography ( hra ) or a modified fundus camera [ 9 , 10 ] .
in the present study , we evaluated the central macular thickness ( cmt ) using noninvasive methods , including oct and faf , in patients who underwent cataract surgery without complication , using phacoemulsification ( phaco ) with posterior intraocular lens ( pciol ) implantation .
2. materials and methods for this study , patients were selected from those who were diagnosed with juvenile or senile cataracts , who underwent phaco and pciol implantation with no complications , between october 2008 and june 2009 at the department of ophthalmology , istanbul university , istanbul faculty of medicine .
preoperatively , complete ophthalmologic examinations of the patients were performed , including uncorrected and best corrected visual acuities ( bcva ) , manifest refraction , keratometry , axial length , intraocular pressure , and biomicroscopic and posterior segment examinations .
cmt of each eye was evaluated by a spectral domain - scanning laser ophthalmoscope oct ( sd - slo / oct ) ( oti , toronto , canada ) .
af images were obtained using a hra 1 device ( heidelberg engineering , germany ) , using the fluorescein mode without injection of fluorescein and using the red - free mode after the pupils were dilated and focused on the retina .
the 30 micron visual field mode was used to obtain faf images .
a series of 20 images were recorded , digitalized , aligned , and averaged using image analysis using hra 1 device .
patients with any ocular pathology , other than cataracts , were excluded from the study .
the study was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the declaration of helsinki .
cataract surgery was performed under local anesthesia , except for two patients whose operations were carried out under general anesthesia .
standard phaco procedures were performed on patients , with a 3 mm clear corneal incision and a foldable pciol implantation .
eyes that experienced any intraoperative complication were excluded from the study .
topical prednisolone sodium phosphate 1 % ( norsol , bilim ilac , turkey ) , six times daily , and topical tobramycin 0.3 % ( tobrex , alcon , usa ) , four times daily , were prescribed to the patients in the postoperative period .
postoperative examinations of the patients were performed on days 1 , 30 , 60 , 90 , and 180 .
patients were divided into two groups depending on the presence or absence of cme .
an additional examination was performed for patients with cme at 2 months following the operation .
preoperative and postoperative values were recorded and compared between the two groups .
depending on clinical recovery , diclofenac sodium 75 mg tb ( voltaren sr , novartis , usa ) , once daily , ketorolac tromethamine 0.5 % ( acular , allergan , irvine , ca ) , four times daily , and topical prednisolone acetate 1 % ( pred forte , allergan , irvine , ca ) were given to the patients with cme who showed no improvement in bcva .
the findings of the study were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences ( spss ) for windows 16.0 .
the friedman nonparametric analysis of variance was performed for repeated measurements .
the wilcoxon test was used for comparisons in pairs by applying a bonferroni correction .
pearson 's correlation tests were used to determine the strength of the relationships between the measurements .
significance was evaluated at the level p < 0.05 .
3. results forty eyes of 29 patients were included in this study .
eleven of the 29 patients were male ( 37.9 %) , and 18 were female ( 62.1 %) .
the mean age of the patients was 61.03 +/ - 16.72 years ( range 10 - 79 years ) .
the mean ages of the patients with cme and the patients without cme were 70.5 +/ - 10.6 and 60.33 +/ - 17.01 , resepectively .
changes in visual acuity and cmt of patients are shown in table 1 .
in the preoperative period , faf and oct images of the patients were normal .
the foveal examination of the patients with slit lamp biomicroscopy , by using a + 90 d noncontact lens , revealed cme in all eyes with the cmt approximately >= 200 mum .
postoperative bcva did not increase in three of the eyes of two patients ( 7.5 %) , and cme was detected in these eyes by the use of oct , faf and during routine examination at 1 month .
a significant increase in the bcva was observed in the eyes without cme after 1 month when compared to the examination at day 1 ( p = 0.001 ) and at 3 months when compared to the examination at 1 month ( p = 0.02 ) , postoperatively ( table 2 ) .
during the followup , there was a significant increase in cmt in the eyes without cme between the preoperative evaluation and day 1 postoperative ( p = 0.03 ) , at 1 month and 3 months ( p = 0.05 ) , and a significant decrease in cmt was seen at 6 months , when compared to the examination at 3 months ( p = 0.04 ) ( table 3 ) .
the cmt in patients without cme decreased to normal levels at 3 months .
however , the preoperative values were lower than the postoperative values measured at 6 months which was not statistically significant .
there was no significant correlation between bcva and cmt in any of the postoperative examinations .
cme was detected in three of the eyes of two patients at 1 month , but haf was observed only in two of these three eyes .
the change in bcva and the cmt and faf and oct images of these three patients are shown in figure 1 .
4. discussion cme is the most common cause of unexpected loss of vision after uncomplicated cataract surgery [ 11 ] .
cme was first described by irvine after intracapsular cataract extraction ( icce ) in 1953 [ 12 ] .
in cme following cataract surgery , there are three mechanisms attributing to the etiology of cme : the effect of vitreoretinal traction , light damage , and production of prostaglandins .
development of clinically significant cme , with a decrease in the visual acuity , following modern cataract surgery has been reported at a rate from 0.2 % to 14 % [ 2 , 13 ] .
fundus fluorescein angiography ( ffa ) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cme .
however , as ffa is an invasive and qualitative method , to detect cme without a decrease in visual acuity , there is a tendency to use noninvasive and quantitative methods .
oct and faf are good , noninvasive , quantitative , and reproducible methods that are used currently .
ffa was compared with oct by mitne et al. for the diagnosis of cme , who found an 88 % correlation between the two methods [ 14 ] .
the same comparison was performed by antcliff et al. who reported that the sensitivity and specificity of oct was 96 % and 100 % , respectively [ 15 ] .
in a study carried out by perente et al. involving 102 patients who underwent phaco and pciol implantation , the cmt ( measured using oct ) increased significantly between 1 month and 6 months , postoperatively [ 16 ] .
in a similar study , jagow et al. observed a moderate increase in the macular thickness between the 1st week and 6th week , postoperatively , but there was no significant correlation between the cmt and bcva [ 17 ] .
using oct , sourdille and santiago found an association between the increase in the cmt and the decrease in vision after the 1st week postoperative [ 18 ] .
in the present study , cme has been noticed using oct in 7.5 % of patients after surgery .
all of these patients had an unsatisfactory increase in visual acuity .
the mean age of the patients with cme was higher than those without cme .
this is consistent with publications advocating that aging may predispose the development of cme [ 19 ] .
furthermore , the cmt of those patients without cme increased significantly on day 1 following surgery , compared to the preoperative values , using oct .
light exposure during surgery may explain the increase of the cmt in these patients .
faf is a new and useful tool for obtaining information on baseline fluorescence from the rpe , as caused by lipofuscin .
lipofuscin mainly accumulates as a result of incomplete destruction of the outer segments of the photoreceptors .
a further cause of haf is inflammation , which triggers the pro - oxidative pathway .
faf is used for diagnosing age - related macular degeneration , hereditary retinal diseases , such as stargardt disease , retinitis pigmentosa , and cone dystrophies [ 20 , 21 ] .
displacement of macular pigments due to cystoid gaps in the cme may lead to haf .
holz et al. stated that extracellular fluid containing retinoid proteins emits autofluorescence .
therefore , in addition to the accumulation of lipofuscin , haf may be caused by extracellular liquid in the presence of macular edema [ 9 , 10 , 22 ] .
ffa and faf were carried out by mcbain et al. in 34 patients suspected of having cme [ 23 ] .
the sensitivity and specificity of faf was found to be 81 % and 69 % , respectively , for the diagnosis of cme .
macaluso et al. and camparini et al. evaluated patients with cme that developed due to various reasons [ 24 , 25 ] .
they observed a consistency between faf and ffa in all cases .
similarly , in a further study involving 14 patients , ffa and faf were found to be correlated with the cme [ 26 ] .
peng and su reported that the correlation between faf and ffa was 87 % in the cme from patients with different origins [ 27 ] .
similarly , pece et al. and vujosevic et al. reported the haf as 64.7 % and 76.8 % , respectively [ 28 , 29 ] .
faf has some limitations in cme .
there is a correlation between the size of the cyst and haf in cme [ 8 ] .
severity of the cme which may be seen as leakage in fa and as increased foveal thickness in oct also exhibit significant correlation with haf [ 28 , 29 ] .
so , small - sized cysts with relatively thinner fovea may not be visualized in faf .
haf in cme is usually apparent under 488 nm excitation while may not be seen under 580 nm excitation [ 26 ] .
in the current study , one of the eyes with cme could not be detected with faf image .
while we used hra which has 488 nm excitation , we suggested that this was associated with the small size of the cyst in this eye .
in our study , haf could not be detected in the eyes without cme .
however , haf was detected in two of the three eyes with cme and was also observed using oct .
the abnormalities in these three eyes were resolved following treatment .
furthermore , we found that the moderate increase in the cmt in the first 3 months did not cause a decrease in the visual acuity in the patients without cme , and the thickness of the macula gradually decreased and returned to preoperative values within 3 months after surgery .
the increased cmt values were regressed in the patients with cme , and haf also disappeared as a result of the medical treatment , and after 6 months there was no permanent vision loss in any of the eyes .
however , the results of our study are somewhat limited due to the small number of patients and lack of a control group .
nevertheless our results were comparable with the results of the previous studies particularly in demonstration of the relationship between the cyst size and haf .
in conclusion , in the evaluation of the macula in patients who underwent uncomplicated phaco surgery , haf was correlated with oct , demonstrating that haf can be used as a noninvasive , fast , and convenient method for diagnosis and followup , in the absence of oct .

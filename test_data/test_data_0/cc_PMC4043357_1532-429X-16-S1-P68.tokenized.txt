we aim to characterize the exercise recovery kinetics in the calf muscle of healthy volunteers by combining treadmill exercise and magnetic resonance ( mr ) relaxometry ( t1 , t2 and t2 *) , and to investigate their relation with age and treadmill exercise duration .
methods twenty four healthy volunteers ( age : 23 - 79 years , 12 males ) performed bruce treadmill stress test to at least 81 % of age - predicted maximum heart rate on an mr - compatible treadmill adjacent to a 1.5t mri system .
single slice axial t1 ( tr / te / ti = 1200 / 1.1 / 125 , 205 , 285 , 1325 , 1405 , 1485 , 2525 , 2605 , 2685 , 3885 ms , fa = 35degrees , 1 nex , 1.9 x 1.9 x 8 mm3 , 1:02 min : s ) , t2 ( tr / tet2p = 2500 / 0 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 ms , fa = 70degrees , 2 nex , 1.9 x 1.9 x 8 mm3 , 50 s ) and t2 * ( tr / tes = 740 / 2.1 , 4.2 , 6.6 , 8.9 , 11.3 , 13.7 , 16.1 , 18.4 ms , 2 nex , fa = 18degrees , 1.9 x 1.9 x 8 mm3 , 31 s ) maps were sequentially acquired for ~ 15 minutes at rest , and for ~ 45 minutes post exercise ( figure 1a ) .
the relaxometric values from small regions in anterior tibialis ( ta ) , soleus ( sol ) , medial ( mg ) and lateral gastrocnemius ( lg ) muscles were recorded , averaged over both legs and plotted against time ( figure 1b ) .
rest , peak exercise , peak - rest difference , end of exercise recovery and decay rate values was checked against age and exercise test duration using pearson 's correlation .
figure 1 a. time course of exercise induced changes in the left calf muscles of a 30 year old male volunteer .
axial t1 ( top row ) , t2 ( middle row ) and t2 * ( bottom row ) maps acquired before exercise ( pre ) , immediately after exercise ( post 1 ) , at ~ 20 minutes ( post 9 ) and at ~ 45 minutes ( post 18 ) are shown. b. exercise - induced time course changes of mean t1 ( a ) , mean t2 ( b ) and mean t2 * values ( c ) of the four calf muscle groups in 24 volunteers before ( pre ) and after exercise ( post _ 1 to 18 - ~ 2:20 minute intervals ) .
graph in blue - ta , red - sol , green - mg and purple - lg. results t1 , t2 and t2 * demonstrated a significant increase from rest with exercise , followed by gradual recovery .
t2 at rest ( r2 _ ta = 0.48 , r2 _ sol = 0.47 , r2 _ mg = 0.44 , r2 _ lg = 0.53 ) , peak t1 , t2 and t2 * ( r2 = 0.49 , 0.52 , and - 0.52 ) in sol , end of exercise t2 in sol , mg and lg ( r2 = 0.66 , 0.47 , and 0.57 ) and t2 decay rate for ta ( r2 = 0.47 ) were related to age .
the peak - rest differences of t1 , t2 and t2 * in mg ( r2 = 0.46 , 0.53 , and 0.61 ) and lg ( r2 = 0.58 , 0.50 , and 0.47 ) were correlated with test duration ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 examples of significant correlations ( p < 0.05 ) observed in relaxometric measures with age ( a - c ) and treadmill test duration ( d - f ) .
conclusions we investigated treadmill exercise induced changes in normal calf muscles , and showed the exercise induced response can be quantified by mr relaxometry , and is age and exercise duration dependent .
in future patient studies , we will explore the integration of the clinical indices of disease severity ( abi - ankle brachial index , initial and absolute claudication distance ) with mr relaxometric measures to enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology and severity of pad .

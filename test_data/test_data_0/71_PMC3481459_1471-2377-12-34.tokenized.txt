background spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is a disease with high morbidity , high disability rate , high mortality , and high economic burden. whether patients can benefit from surgical evacuation of hematomas is still controversial , especially for those with moderate - volume hematomas in the basal ganglia .
this study is designed to compare the efficacy of endoscopic surgery and conservative treatment for the moderate - volume hematoma in spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage .
methods patients meet the criteria will be randomized into the endoscopic surgery group ( endoscopic surgery for hematoma evacuation and the best medical treatment ) or the conservative treatment group ( the best medical treatment ) .
patients will be followed up at 1 , 3 , and 6 months after initial treatment .
the primary outcomes include the extended glasgow outcome scale and the modified rankin scale .
the secondary outcomes consist of the national institutes of health stroke scale and the mortality .
the barthel index ( bi ) will also be evaluated .
the sample size is 100 patients .
discussion the ecmoh trial is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate if endoscopic surgery is better than conservative treatment for patients with moderate - volume hematomas in the basal ganglia .
trial registration chinese clinical trial registry : chictr - trc - 11001614 ( http :// www.chictr.org / en / proj / show.aspx ? proj = 1618 ) endoscopic surgery conservative treatment moderate - volume hematoma spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage background spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ( sich ) is a disease with high morbidity , high disability rate , high mortality , and high economic burden [ 1,2 ] .
its annual incidence is about 20 cases per 100,000 population [ 3,4 ] .
more than 70 % patients end up with death or dependence [ 5,6 ] .
the main clinical management of sich includes surgical and medical treatment. whether patients can benefit from surgery is still controversial , especially for those with basal ganglia hemorrhage , which is the major subtype of sich [ 7 ] .
surgical evacuation of hematomas can relieve the mass effect and reduce the harmful substance released during their coagulation , liquefaction , and resolution [ 8 - 10 ] , but surgical procedures may also injure the brain tissue , and cause other operative complications .
these disadvantages reduce the benefit of surgery .
some clinical trials were carried out to compare surgery with medical treatment .
the most famous trial is the stich trial conducted by mendelow et al .
[ 5 ] .
1033 patients were randomized .
after 6 months follow - up , 26 % of patients in the early surgery group had a favourable outcome compared with 24 % in the group of initial conservative treatment .
early surgery did not show significant advantages .
however , in this study less than 25 % of the operations were minimally invasive .
trials of stereotactic surgery or craniopuncture were also carried out [ 11 - 13 ] .
but none of the trials and systematic reviews provide sufficient evidence for the choice of treatments [ 6,14 - 16 ] .
in clinical practice , neurologists and neurosurgeons tend to choose conservative treatment for patients with small - volume hematomas , and surgery for those with large - volume hematomas [ 17 ] .
however , when the volume of the hematoma exceeds 60 ml , neither of the methods give much help [ 18 ] .
treatments for moderate - volume hematomas have the most uncertainty .
some recently randomized trials indicate these patients may benefit from minimally invasive surgery [ 13,19 ] .
kim et al .
[ 19 ] randomized 387 patients with basal ganglia or thalamus hematomas to stereotactic - guided evacuation ( group a ) or conservative treatment ( group b ) , and the mean hematoma volume was 23.1 ml. at the end of 6 months follow - up , the mean score of modified barthel index was 90.9 in group a and 62.4 in group b , and the mean score of modified rankin scale was 1.2 in group a and 3.0 in group b. patients received stereotactic - guided evacuation had better clinical outcomes and motor function .
endoscopic surgery is one of the minimally invasive ways for hematoma evacuation .
compared with other surgical methods , it has advantages as follows .
a ) .
the hematoma evacuation is performed under direct vision of neurosurgeons .
it 's much easier to spot any bleeding site , so that the risk of postoperative rebleeding is lower .
b ) .
the evacuation rate of hematomas is higher because of a wider vision .
c ) .
this also leads to less brain retraction and brain tissue injury .
d ) .
the operation time is shorter .
cho et al .
[ 20 ] carried out a randomized controlled trial which compared endoscopic surgery , stereotactic aspiration and craniotomy .
the results showed endoscopic surgery had the highest hematoma evacuation rate , the lowest mortality and complication rate , and shorter waiting time than stereotactic aspiration .
however , there are few randomized controlled trials which contrast endoscopic surgery and conservative treatment .
the trial completed by auer et al .
[ 21 ] in 1989 , showed 28 % lower of the mortality in the endoscopic surgery group than the medical treatment group after 6 months follow - up. but this trial did not restrict the volume of hematomas .
it 's not clear whether endoscopic surgery gives this type of patients better outcomes , so we have designed this study to find more clues for the clinical management of sich .
methods study objective to compare the efficacy of endoscopic surgery and conservative treatment for the moderate - volume hematoma in spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage .
inclusion criteria . spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage confirmed by computed tomography ( ct ) .
.
the volume of the hematoma is between 20 ml to 40 ml. small intraventricular hemorrhage is not counted .
.
admission within 36 hours from the ictus .
.
age between 15 to 75 years old .
.
glasgow coma score ( gcs ) >= 8 .
exclusion criteria . any sign of brain herniation , including deep coma , unilateral or bilateral pupil dilation , abnormal posture , or unstable vital signs .
.
hemorrhage caused by aneurysm , vascular malformations , tumor apoplexy , trauma , or cerebral infarction .
computed tomography angiography will be performed .
.
large intraventricular hematomas which occupy half of the cross section area of the lateral ventricle on ct scans , or hydrocephalus caused by hematocele .
.
primary intraventricular hemorrhage .
.
dysfunction of blood coagulation , thrombocytopenia , or history of taking any kind of drugs which affect coagulation function in the past 40 days .
.
before the ictus , the patient has severe physical or mental illness which causes significant disability , or the patient has other severe comorbidity .
.
the patient is pregnant .
sample size the rate of the favourable outcome of patients with basal ganglia hemorrhage is about 30 % for conservative treatment [ 5,6 ] and 60 % for endoscopic surgery [ 22 - 24 ] .
a sample size of 86 will be required with a significance level of 5 % ( 2 - sided ) and a power of 80 % .
in consideration of the loss to follow - up , the sample size is enlarged to 100 .
randomization the minimization method is adopted for the patients allocation , and it 's performed by a minimization software .
when the qualification of a patient is confirmed , the investigator sends the basic information of the patient to a special trialist who is responsible for patients randomization .
after the information of the patient is imported , the software will randomize him / her into the endoscopic surgery group or the conservative treatment group .
the presetted variables for minimization are age , hematoma volume , and admission gcs .
the allocation of patients cannot be changed .
if the patients' condition deteriorates during conservative treatment , and the surgical indications are clear , hematoma evacuation will be performed after fully informed consent .
blinding both patients and surgeons cannot be blinded .
in order to minimize the measurement bias , the following procedures are made .
a ) .
patient outcomes will be measured by two special investigators who are not involved in the allocation and the treatment .
before the outcome measurement starts , patients , their relatives , and the related medial staff will be told not to reveal any information about the treatment .
b ) .
every patient will have a gauze covered on the hemorrhage side of the head to conceal the scar or baldness .
c ) .
because the follow - up forms and the treatment forms are printed on the same set of case report form ( crf ) , these two investigators must hand in a copy of the original score sheets to the quality monitoring board ( qmb ) , before they are allowed to get the crf of the patient .
d ) .
the statistical analysis will be made by a statistician who does n't participate in the implementation of the trial , and the treatment information of the groups will be blinded .
measurement of the hematoma volume the abcs method is adopted to measure the hematoma volume : volume ( ml ) = ( a x b x c )/ 2 [ 25 ] .
" a " is the long axis of the hematoma on the ct slice where the hematoma has the largest area .
" b " is the longest axis of the hematoma perpendicular to the long axis on the same ct slice .
" c " is the product of the interslice distance and the count of slices on which the hematoma is visible .
the intraventricular hematoma is not counted .
the rebleeding or hematoma expansion is defined as a 10 ml increase between two ct scans .
treatments endoscopic surgery group this group of patients will receive endoscopic surgery and the best medical treatment .
the surgery will be performed as soon as possible after the randomization , and the medical treatment will be started immediately .
neurosurgeons will decide surgical approaches according to the location , size , and shape of hematomas .
the hematomas will be evacuated as much as possible with the help of the angled endoscope , but the stiffly attached clot wo n't be removed by force in order to prevent unnecessary damage , and the restricted intracavity operation will be the principle during the hematoma evacuation .
a " rebleeding test " will be performed after the hemostasis .
for patients with hypertension , the blood pressure will be slowly elevated to the level before the anesthesia , and for other patients , a raise of 20 ~ 30 mmhg will be gained .
the anesthetist will maintain this level of blood pressure for 10 minutes .
only if there is no new bleeding site , neurosurgeons can start to close .
conservative treatment group the best medical treatment will be provided to this group of patients right after the admission .
a " multistep blood pressure control " will be carried out .
the range of the first reduction is limited to 20 % of the admission level for patients with hypertension , and it should be accomplished in half an hour .
if the patients' systolic blood pressure exceeds 225 mmhg , the goal is lower than 180 mmhg .
the level of blood pressure will be maintained for 8 hours and gradually reach the normal standard in 72 hours .
after patients are stabilized , the rehabilitation will be started as early as possible .
follow - up patients will be followed up at 1 , 3 , and 6 months after initial treatment .
outcome assessment both investigators have been trained at least 20 hours by multimedia , bedside practice , and a qualification exam , before they start to evaluate patient outcomes .
primary outcomes the primary outcomes of the study are the extended glasgow outcome scale ( gose )[ 26 ] and the modified rankin scale ( mrs ) at 6 months after initial treatment .
both scales will be measured with structured interviews .
secondary outcomes the secondary outcomes include the national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) and the mortality after 6 months since initial treatment .
other outcome the barthel index ( bi ) will also be evaluated .
ethics this study is conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and guideline for good clinical practice .
all patients and their relatives are fully informed about the trial , and they have had a copy of the informed consent form .
the trial is approved by the biological and medical ethics committee ( bmec ) of west china hospital ( 2011reviewed - no.92 ) .
data collection and management the allocation data of patients is kept by the trialist who specializes in randomization .
neurosurgeons should fill in crf except the follow - up forms , which must be completed by another two investigators trained for outcome assessment .
double input will be used in the data entry .
the qmb and the principal investigator will check and examine the data , then the database will be locked and sent to a statistician .
adverse and severe adverse events adverse event ( ae ) is any undesirable incident happening to patients during the study .
it will be recorded on crf , including a description of the event , the correlation with the trial , the starting date , the ending date , actions taken and their efficacy , and the patient outcome .
severe adverse event ( sae ) is defined as the event of death or vegetative state .
severe disability is not included , because basal ganglia hemorrhage tends to cause severe disability .
sae will also be recorded on crf .
all aes and saes will be reported to the qmb and the bmec , and the time limit for sae report is 24 hours .
statistical analysis both intention to treat ( itt ) and per - protocol ( pp ) analysis will be performed .
the level of significance is 0.05 , and power is 80 % .
the quantitative data will be analyzed by t - test .
chi - square test will be used to analyze the categorical data .
for the ordinal data , wilcoxon rank test is adopted. and survival analysis will be carried out for further comparison of mortality .
logistic regression will be used to adjust the effect of multivariables .
discussion spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage is very likely to cause death , independence , disability , and lead to a great financial burden , so it 's always a hot issue in neurology and neurosurgery .
there are already more than 10 randomized controlled trials referring to the treatment choices of sich , but we still designed this study due to the following reasons .
a ) .
to evacuate or not , it 's controversial , especially for moderate - volume hematomas .
b ) .
it 's reasonable to evacuate the hematoma considering its mechanical , chemical , and biological harm to the brain tissue [ 8 - 10 ] .
c ) .
as a minimally invasive technique , endoscopic surgery may reveal the benefit of the hematoma evacuation , which is probably covered by the secondary injury caused by traditional craniotomy .
d ) .
there is a lack of randomized controlled trial focusing on endoscopic surgery for the moderate - volume hematoma in spontaneous basal ganglia hemorrhage .
for patients in the conservative treatment group , if their condition deteriorates because of hematoma expansion or rebleeding during the trial , and the surgical indications are clear , then hematoma evacuation should be performed .
the crossover will be analyzed in both ways : itt and pp. surgical approaches for the hematoma evacuation in the basal ganglia include the temporal approach , the frontal approach , and the transsylvian approach .
the last one is often performed under the microscope , so it wo n't be applied in this study .
the temporal approach usually provides the shortest distance from the cortex to the hematoma , but it may cause injury to the visual pathway , and if the hematoma is elliptical , neurosurgeons may fail to evacuate the frontal part of the hematoma because of the blind angle .
in the frontal approach , the trajectory of endoscope is parallel to the long axis of the hematoma , so neurosurgeons get a better view through this approach , and it 's advised to be used for hematomas larger than 50 ml [ 27 ] .
however , for small and moderate volume hematomas , much further distance is needed to reach them by the frontal approach , which means more brain tissue damage .
also , the aspect ratio of moderate - volume hematomas is more approximate to 1:1 than the large ones , which makes fewer blind angle through the temporal approach .
in this study , surgical approaches will be decided according to the location , size , and shape of hematomas .
in conclusion , the ecmoh trial is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess if endoscopic surgery is better than conservative treatment for patients with moderate - volume hematomas in the basal ganglia .

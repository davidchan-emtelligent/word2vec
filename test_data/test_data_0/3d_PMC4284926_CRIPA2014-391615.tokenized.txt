carcinosarcomas of the ureter are rare biphasic neoplasms , composed of both malignant epithelial ( carcinomatous ) and malignant mesenchymal ( sarcomatous ) components .
carcinosarcomas of the urinary tract are exceedingly rare .
we report a unique case of a carcinosarcoma of the ureter with a chondrosarcoma and small cell tumor component arising in a 68 - year - old male who presented with microscopic hematuria .
ct intravenous pyelogram revealed right - sided hydroureter and hydronephrosis with thickening and narrowing of the right ureter .
the patient underwent robot - assisted ureterectomy with bladder cuff excision and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy .
the patient is disease - free at 32 months after treatment .
we provide a brief synoptic review of carcinosarcoma of the ureter and bladder with utilization of immunohistochemical ( ihc ) stains and potential diagnostic pitfalls .
1. introduction carcinosarcomas of the ureter are rare malignant neoplasms with only around a dozen case reports within the literature [ 1 - 14 ] .
they are biphasic neoplasms composed of both malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components .
these aggressive tumors are more commonly found within the uterus , where they are also known within the gynecologic pathology nomenclature as malignant mixed mesodermal tumors ( mmmt ) .
they are usually present in elderly patients with a median age of 72 ( mean age 64 ) and are histologically of high grade with an advanced stage at diagnosis and subsequent poor prognosis. of reported cases of ureteral carcinosarcoma , the epithelial components most often are comprised of urothelial ( transitional cell ) carcinoma , carcinoma in situ , adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , or small cell carcinoma .
the stromal or sarcomatous component most often consists of osteosarcoma , chondrosarcoma , leiomyosarcoma , or rhabdomyosarcoma [ 13 , 14 ] .
due to the limited number of cases , there is no clear consensus on treatment regimens and impact on survival .
we present a rare case of carcinosarcoma of the ureter and review the histopathogenesis and immunohistochemical staining profile and discuss current treatment strategies and prognosis .
2. case presentation a 68 - year - old male presented with microscopic hematuria on routine physical exam , and further work - up revealed right - sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter with a transition zone in the right ureter .
the patient was referred to our institution for consideration of right - sided robot - assisted ureteral excision .
evaluation with ureteroscopy found a mass in the right mid to distal ureter that was biopsied and read as high grade urothelial carcinoma .
the patient subsequently underwent robotic - assisted right distal ureterectomy with bladder cuff excision .
macroscopically , there was no distinct mass but an ulcerated and hemorrhagic mucosa in the right ureter extending 7 cm in length with concurrent stricture .
microscopic examination of this specimen revealed a biphasic neoplasm composed of both malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components ( figure 1 ) .
the epithelial components consisted of high grade urothelial carcinoma with multifocal carcinoma in situ , focal areas demonstrating glandular / enteric differentiation , and a small cell carcinoma component .
the mesenchymal component was composed of a high grade chondrosarcoma .
immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the epithelial components were immunoreactive with cam 5.2 , cytokeratin 7 , and focally with cytokeratin 20 .
the small cell carcinoma component was positive for cd56 , but other neuroendocrine markers including synaptophysin and chromogranin were negative .
the high grade chondrosarcoma component was not stained .
the morphologic and immunoprofile was consistent with a carcinosarcoma .
the tumor was muscle invasive and the pathologic stage was pt2nx , according to the ajcc 7th edition .
the patient was given the option of adjuvant therapy secondary to the high grade nature of the malignacy with muscle invasion and concurrent small cell carcinoma component .
he received three cycles of cisplatin and gemcitabine chemotherapy .
after 32 months of follow - up , the patient is alive and disease - free with negative ct and pet scans .
3. discussion carcinosarcomas are aggressive neoplasms that can occur anywhere in the body but commonly occur within the uterus in women and the bladder in men .
these malignant tumors most often occur in older patients , greater than 60 years of age , and are more frequent in men than women ( m : f ratio of 4 : 1 ) [ 13 ] .
carcinosarcomas of the ureter are biphasic tumors with distinct carcinoma and sarcomatous components .
historically within the literature there has been a lack of consistency and clarity in the histogenesis of these lesions as well as the nomenclature .
the terms carcinosarcoma and sarcomatoid carcinoma ( spindle cell neoplasms ) have often been used interchangeably , although now we appreciate that these tumors are different based on the fact that carcinosarcomas have a true mesenchymal component distinctive from the epithelial component [ 15 , 16 ] .
sarcomatoid carcinomas are epithelial - derived neoplasms that morphologically resemble sarcomas but only stain with epithelial markers such as cytokeratins ( unlike carcinosarcomas which stain with both epithelial and mesenchymal markers ) .
the origin and evolution of carcinosarcomas have also been questioned with multiple theories ranging from a common stem cell origin to a collision tumor resulting from two different tumors ( sarcoma and carcinoma ) converging within the same tumor [ 15 , 16 ] .
recent studies have supported the monoclonality of these neoplasms , suggesting divergence from a common precursor stem cell origin [ 17 ] .
carcinosarcoma of the ureter is a rare malignant tumor with poor outcomes involving frequent recurrence within months and death from disease within two years [ 13 , 14 ] .
it is important to differentiate and distinguish carcinosarcomas from more common , and perhaps less aggressive , neoplasms that often occur in this region including carcinomas with osseous or cartilaginous metaplasia , spindle cell carcinomas ( spindle cell neoplams ) , carcinomas with a pseudosarcomatous stroma , and collision tumors .
this can be reliably done by the pathologist using immunohistochemical stains , cytological features , and relationship of the carcinoma to the stroma or suspected sarcomatous component of the tumor .
the epithelial components of ureteral carcinosarcomas often include urothelial carcinoma , carcinoma in situ , small cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma .
the stromal components often consist of chondrosarcoma , osteosarcoma , leiomyosarcoma , malignant fibrous histiocytoma , and , less commonly , rhabdomyosarcoma .
potential pitfalls confronting pathologists can distinguish a high grade urothelial carcinoma from a small cell / neuroendocrine neoplasm on biopsy alone , especially if there is tissue crush artifact or sampling bias .
in these examples one might employ a neuroendocrine marker , in addition to a cytokeratin , to rule out small cell carcinoma , as this diagnosis could affect preoperative or postoperative oncologic therapy and prognosis .
prior literature indicates that cd56 is the immunohistochemical stain that most consistently demonstrates positive staining in small cell tumors [ 18 ] .
most patients with carcinosarcoma of the ureter present clinically with hematuria ( microscopic and gross ) and evidence of ureteral obstruction with obstructive nephropathy .
imaging can often locate a space occupying lesion of the ureter or retroperitoneum .
significant past medical or social history can include exposure to chemotherapy or radiation for risk of developing carcinosarcoma in general .
smoking history has been identified as a possible significant contributing factor for rare primary small cell carcinomas of the ureter [ 18 ] .
our patient with a small cell tumor component had a past medical and social history significant for smoking .
aggressive surgical management is the treatment of choice in management of patients with carcinosarcoma of the ureter .
literature reports suggest that nephroureterectomy is the recommended procedure for surgically treating these lesions [ 13 ] .
this potentially depends on the focality of the tumor and proximity of the tumor to the kidney .
in our patient , the location of the tumor in the mid to distal ureter lent itself to a minimally invasive approach given the patient 's age and medical comorbidities .
a strong need to preserve the patient 's renal function was an added influence in decision making .
a robotic - assisted laproscopic resection of the diseased segment of ureter and bladder cuff was performed with ureteroneocystostomy .
though the patient had high grade disease on biopsy , a thorough ureteroscopy was performed to ensure that there was no disease in the rest of the ureter and renal pelvis .
biopsies of the disease - free margin of ureter were taken and were negative .
renal pelvis washings were also performed and revealed no malignant cells .
secondary to the rarity of these lesions , low number of patients to conduct meaningful prospective studies , and lack of long term follow - up , there is no clear consensus on radiochemotherapy regimens and impact on survival .
the literature suggests that the prognosis is universally poor and that neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy may not improve prognosis [ 13 , 14 ] .
however , reports involving carcinosarcoma of the bladder , which is far more common than carcinosarcoma of the ureter , have demonstrated that a small number of patients have experienced a survival benefit with combined surgery and radiation or chemotherapy [ 19 - 21 ] , with one case obtaining a complete pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [ 19 ] .
the studies directly correlate stage of tumor with survival and disease - free interval [ 20 , 21 ] .
additionally , studies involving rare , pure small cell carcinomas of the ureter have demonstrated a small survival advantage in patients who underwent surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy , which is pertinent in cases of carcinosarcoma with a small cell component [ 18 ] .
given the concern for residual microscopic disease and final pathology in our case , the decision was made to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy .
a combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine was used .
the organ of disease origin and type of epithelial component in carcinosarcomas may be important factors in deciding upon which regimen to use .
in addition , some confounding variables which could account for the apparent ineffectiveness of chemotherapy regimens include improper histological classification , focality of the tumor , size and depth of invasion , distance from or involvement of the renal pelvis , and / or genetic makeup of the tumor itself ( inherently aggressive and unresponsive to treatment ) .
our patient is currently disease - free 32 months after treatment , suggesting a role for combined surgical and oncological treatment in the management of these patients .
recognition of this rare entity is important for urologists and pathologists alike to accurately diagnose these lesions and treat them aggressively .
though overall prognosis remains poor for the majority of patients , our case suggests multimodal therapy may provide an avenue for prolonged survival in carcinosarcomas of the ureter .

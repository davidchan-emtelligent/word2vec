background prevalence of metabolic syndrome ( ms ) is rapidly increasing worldwide .
to investigate the spread of ms risks and its relationship with eating habits including fish intake , we carried out a health examination for young and middle - aged men .
methods the subjects were 97 healthy men ( 20 to 50 years ) living in mwanza , located on the shore of lake victoria in tanzania .
the health examination was conducted according to the basic protocol of who - cardiac ( cardiovascular diseases and alimentary comparison ) study .
this survey included anthropometric measurements , a dietary questionnaire , blood pressure measurement , and blood and 24 - hour urine ( 24u ) collection .
excretions of sodium , potassium and taurine ( tau ) in 24u were estimated as the biomarkers of salt , vegetable and fish product intakes respectively .
results in this survey , 62.5 % of the young and 63.3 % of the middle - aged adults had ms risks .
the most prevalent ms risk factor was increased blood pressure ( 50.0 % of young adults and 53.1 % of the middle - aged ) .
tau excretions in 24u and n - 3 fatty acid levels in plasma were significantly lower in young adults than those in the middle - aged ( both p < 0.05 ) .
the eating frequencies of non - traditional foods such as donuts and ice cream showed negative correlations with age ( r = - 0.282 , p < 0.01 and r = - 0.246 , p < 0.05 ) , while salt intake positively correlated with age ( r = 0.236 , p < 0.05 ) .
tau excretion in 24u was inversely correlated with atherosclerosis index ( r = - 0.306 , p < 0.01 ) and fasting blood glucose ( r = - 0.284 , p < 0.05 ) .
conclusions young adults in mwanza had a decreased frequency of eating habit of fish products compared with the middle - aged as indicated by tau excretion in 24u and n - 3 fatty acid level in the plasma , and over half of young adults had one or more ms risks just as the middle - aged .
the change in food habit of lowered fish intake and raised exotic food intake might be concluded to increase ms risks in young men .
14 - 19 december 200917th international meeting of taurinefort lauderdale , fl , usa background metabolic syndrome ( ms ) is an increasing health problem throughout the world .
its epidemic is a severe problem among the elderly and young adults as well [ 1 ] .
people suffering from ms , such as obesity , high blood pressure ( bp ) , low level of high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , high level of triglycerides ( tg ) and impaired fasting blood glucose ( fbg ) , are more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) and diabetes .
even in developing countries cvd have become a major health problem and a leading cause of death [ 2,3 ] .
ms ( or cvd and diabetes ) is likely to become a serious public health problem in the future .
to prevent such an epidemic , it is important to evaluate and identify ms risks in young adults .
in the who - cardiovascular diseases alimentary comparison ( cardiac ) study the relation of cvd mortalities with biological markers of diet was assessed using 24 - hour urine ( 24u ) analysis ; a more reliable method for dietary habit assessment than questionnaire [ 4 ] .
taurine ( tau ) excretion in 24u was inversely associated with age - adjusted mortality rates of cvd in cardiac study [ 5,6 ] .
it was shown that the excretions of tau , sodium ( na ) and potassium ( k ) in 24u correlated well with dietary fish , salt and vegetable intakes , respectively , which credibly linked to the ms risks [ 7 ] .
tau is found in many foods but is most abundant in seafood .
recent epidemiological studies and animal experiments have shown that a high - fish diet , or intake of tau , prevents ms risks including obesity , hypertension and hypercholesterolemia .
thus , tau excretion might be a useful indicator for assessment of potential ms risks [ 8 - 10 ] .
our previous study in tanzania showed that the prevalence of hypertension and obesity has been increasing in urban areas more than in rural areas ( aged 48 - 56 years ) [ 11 ] .
a cross sectional population study of tanzanian people living in three differential ( urban , rural and semi - nomadic ) areas showed that the frequency of fish intake was inversely associated with cvd risks [ 12 ] .
in this study , we conducted a health survey to assess ms risks in young and middle - aged male africans living in the lakeshore area , an area that has not been investigated before .
furthermore , we evaluated the potential relationship between dietary habit and ms risks in young male africans as compared to those of middle - aged males .
methods subjects we carried out a health survey in urban mwanza , the second largest city in tanzania located on the shore of lake victoria .
participants were 97 men aged 20 to 50 years who were informed of the purpose and procedures about the study and signed an informed consent form .
the study included a bp survey , anthropometrical measurements , blood and 24u collection and a lifestyle questionnaire .
this study was approved by the ethics committees of mukogawa women 's university and weill bugando university college of health .
data collection all measurements and blood sampling were performed by an experienced physician and a nurse at a local community healthcare centre or hospital .
body weight and height were measured with subjects standing and wearing light clothes. from these results , body mass index ( bmi ; weight ( kg ) / height ( m ) 2 ) was calculated .
waist circumference ( wc ) was measured using a flexible steel measuring tape .
blood pressures and pulse rates were measured after a 5 - to 10 - minute rest using an automatic digital bp measurement system ( omron digital hem - 907 , tokyo , japan ) .
the mean of 3 readings was used in this analysis .
blood samples were taken after at least 10 hours of fasting .
blood analyses including serum total cholesterol ( tc ) , hdl - c , tg , fbg , haemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) were assessed at srl inc .
( tokyo , japan ) .
enzymatic methods for tc , hdl - c , tg and fbg , a latex agglutination method for hba1c and a gas chromatographic method for epa and dha were performed .
non - hdl - c was calculated by subtracting hdl - c from tc. the atherosclerosis index ( ai ) was calculated as non - hdl - c / hdl - c .
24u was collected using an aliquot cup ( izumi seisakusho , osaka , japan ) and various markers of diets were analyzed , including creatinine , na , k and tau .
na and k were determined by electrode methods and creatinine was analyzed by enzymatic method .
tau was assessed using high performance liquid chromatography .
sodium - potassium ratio ( na / k ) was calculated by the measured values and the amounts of daily excretion for tau and sodium chloride ( nacl ) were also calculated by the 24u volume .
success or failure in 24u collection was judged from the diagnostic criteria based on calculated values of the daily creatinine excretion in 24u .
the results of those who failed to complete 24u collection were excluded from the analyses .
we used international diabetes federation ( idf ) criteria to define the ms risks : wc >= 94 cm , bp >= 130 / 85 mmhg , fbg levels >= 100 mg / dl ( 5.6 mmol / l ) , tg levels >= 150 mg / dl ( 1.7 mmol / l ) and hdl - c levels < 40 mg / dl ( 1.0 mmol / l ) in men .
since the criteria was set to be lower than other criteria such as in the who or the national cholesterol education program - adult treatment panel iii definitions , we could detect people having ms risks at an earlier stage .
intake frequency was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire about 135 food items .
for each , eating frequency was assessed and categorized into 9 levels ; never in a month , 1 to 3 times per month , once per week , 2 to 4 times per week , 5 to 6 times per week , once per day , 2 to 3 times per day , 4 to 5 times per day and 6 or more times per day .
for simplification in some cases for analyses , they were divided into 4 groups ; less than once per month , 2 to 4 times per week , 5 to 6 times per week and more than once per day .
furthermore , information regarding employment , education , alcohol intake , smoking , medical history and physical activity were recorded .
data analysis differences between young adults and the middle - aged were investigated using the student 's t test .
prevalence rates of ms risk factors were compared using a chi - square test .
relationships between two parameters were assessed by a calculation of pearson 's correlation coefficients .
to compare characteristics among the three groups classified by the excretion levels of tau in 24u , analyses of one - way variance was used .
all statistical analyses were undertaken using the spss for windows package version 15 ( spss inc , chicago , il ) .
results are presented as means +/ - standard deviations .
a p value of 0.05 was set as the level of significance .
results characteristics of the young and the middle - aged adults a total of 97 men participated in this study and 74 men completed 24u collections successfully ( 76.3 % of all ) .
the average age was 31.2 +/ - 6.4 for all participants and 31.5 +/ - 6.2 years old for those who completed 24u , respectively .
the characteristics of young and middle - aged participants are shown in table 1 .
the excretions of tau in 24u and dha levels in plasma were significantly higher in the middle - aged than in young adults ( both p < 0.05 ) .
in contrast , na / k ratio was markedly lower in the former than in the latter ( p < 0.01 ) .
waist circumference was markedly higher among the middle - aged than young adults ( p < 0.05 ) .
bp , fbg and cholesterol levels did not vary significantly between the generation groups .
comparing the prevalence of ms risk factors such as increased wc , increased bp , elevated fbg , lowered hdl - c , and increased tg , no significant difference was observed between young and middle - aged men ( table 2 ) .
almost half of participants showed high bp ; 50.0 % in young adults and 53.1 % in the middle - aged and the number of people with impaired fbg was especially low .

as the tau excretion in 24u of the middle - aged was higher than that of young adults , the frequency of fresh fish intake showed positive correlation with the tau excretion ( data not shown ) .
we analyzed the relationship between intake frequencies of 38 items with age , which were selected limited to identifiable items as good or bad for health .
table 3 gives correlation coefficients , only confined to the items having significant connections .
negative correlation was revealed in six food items , showing the highest correlation of donuts with age ( r = - 0.282 , p < 0.01 ) and otherwise canned juice ( r = 0.247 , p < 0.05 ) and salt ( r = 0.236 , p < 0.05 ) identified to be positive correlations with age .

only significant data are shown ( p < 0.05 ) .
the ms risk factors and the excretion levels of tau in 24 - h urine the associations of urinary level of tau with ms risk factors were listed in table 4 .
the excretion of tau showed notably positive correlations with epa ( r = 0.506 , p < 0.001 ) , dha ( r = 0.551 , p < 0.001 ) and k ( r = 0.320 , p < 0.01 ) .
inverse correlations were found between the excretion of tau and ai ( r = - 0.306 , p < 0.01 ) , fbg ( r = - 0.284 , p < 0.05 ) and non - hdl - c ( r = - 0.278 , p < 0.05 ) .
participants in this analysis were divided into three groups by the excretion levels of tau ( low ; under 500 micromol / day , medium ; over 500 but less than 1000 micromol / day , high ; over 1000 micromol / day , data not shown ) .
there was no significant difference in the numbers of participants among three groups ( low , 29.7 % ; medium , 36.5 % ; high , 33.8 %) .
dha level in the plasma of the high tau group was higher than any other group ( p < 0.01 ) .
the non - hdl - c level in the plasma of the low tau group was found to have the highest level as compared to three groups ( p < 0.05 ) .
the prevalence of ms risks in the three groups was compared .
a significantly high prevalence of increased tg level was observed in the low tau group compared with the other groups ( low , 18.2 % ; medium , 0 % ; high , 4.0 % ; p < 0.05 , data not shown ) .

previous studies have reported that the frequency of fish eating is positively related with tau excretion in 24u justifying its use as a bio - marker of fish intake [ 13 ] .
similarly , plasma levels of dha and epa have also been shown to be positively correlated with the frequency of fish intake [ 14 ] .
this study verifies the positive relationship between tau in 24u with dha in plasma , and tau with fresh - fish intake frequency .
it is noteworthy that the prevalence of the ms risk factors in young adults ( mean age , 26.4 years ) and the middle - aged ( mean age , 36.2 years ) showed no significant difference .
ms risks are known to be more prevalent with advancing age among africans or black americans [ 15 ] .
the relatively high prevalence of ms risks ( 62.5 %) at this early age implies the exposure to a high risk of cardiovascular disease in future .
one of the reasons for this phenomenon might lie on their habitual assimilating of non - traditional foods .
the negative correlations of age with the intake frequency of donuts and ice cream indicate a tendency of younger men introducing westernized foods to their diet .
in this study , the significant correlations between the eating frequency of such unhealthy foods and socio - economic status including income or education level have not been shown .
however , undesirable changes in lifestyle based on urbanization and the socio - economic growth have resulted in the dramatic increase in ms prevalence [ 16 ] .
a recent study performed in urban tanzania revealed that the prevalence of obesity increased significantly in 1998 compared to in 1987 [ 17 ] , and the prevalence of hypertension and obesity has been increasing more in urban areas than in rural areas [ 11 ] .
a study in benin , west africa , revealed that a longer exposure to the urban environment was associated with a higher risk of hypertension and that socioeconomic status was positively correlated with abdominal obesity [ 18 ] .
another contribution to the higher risks of young adults involves the deterioration of fish diet .
people with a high level of tau excretions in 24u showed a preferable result in fbg , tc and non - hdl - c compared to those with a low level of it. the fact that administration of omega - 3 fatty acids including dha and epa , rich in fish products , was effective to dyslipidemia is consistent with our present result that the high tau group showed elevated dha and suppressed tc and non - hdl - c level [ 19 ] .
changes in dietary habit to eat less fish might accelerate the increasing ms risk factors .
it was reported that tau excretion in 24u showed a significant inverse correlation with ischemic heart disease in men and women and a positive correlation between fish intake and cvd in japanese [ 6 ] .
in the present study among the high na excretion group , the middle - aged with high tau excretion showed a lower percentage of ms risks , especially based on increased bp , than young adults with low tau excretion ( data not shown ) .
the beneficial effect of tau was supported by the finding that tau supplementation showed cardio - protective effects in stroke prone spontaneously hypertensive rats ( spshr ) given high salt diets [ 20 ] .
the correlation between age and salt intake was detected in the present study ; however the middle - aged rather than young adults would be somewhat protected by tau from the adverse effect of salt on increasing ms risks .
in the past , lake victoria provided a wide variety of fish species as well as important subsistence fishing .
the people living nearby benefitted from the valuable nutrition supply of fish in the lake .
after the introduction of exogenous fishes like nile perch to the lake , local small - scale fishing was pushed aside by large - scale commercial fishing which caused small fish , the main source of nutrition , to be unavailable for inhabitants [ 21 ] .
the change of fishery , biology , environment and socio - economics might bring alteration in food custom , which would have an impact on health conditions in the long view .
conclusions young adults in mwanza have a tendency to eat less fish products than middle - aged as indicated by tau excretion in 24u and omega - 3 fatty acid in plasma .
the changes in food habit including the low rate of fish intake especially in young men will increase ms risks , such as hypertension .

the extent to which defective innate immune responses contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) is not fully understood .
pulmonary surfactant protein a ( sp - a ) plays an important role in regulating innate immunity in the lungs .
in this study , we hypothesised that cigarette smoke ( cs ) and its component acrolein might influence pulmonary innate immunity by affecting the function of sp - a. indeed , acrolein - modified sp - a was detected in the lungs of mice exposed to cs for 1 week .
to further confirm this finding , recombinant human sp - a ( hsp - a ) was incubated with cs extract ( cse ) or acrolein and then analysed by western blotting and nanoscale liquid chromatography - matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionisation time - of - flight tandem mass spectrometry .
these analyses revealed that cse and acrolein induced hsp - a oligomerisation and that acrolein induced the modification of six residues in hsp - a : his39 , his116 , cys155 , lys180 , lys221 , and cys224 .
these modifications had significant effects on the innate immune functions of hsp - a. cse - or acrolein - induced modification of hsp - a significantly decreased hsp - a 's ability to inhibit bacterial growth and to enhance macrophage phagocytosis .
these findings suggest that cs - induced structural and functional defects in sp - a contribute to the dysfunctional innate immune responses observed in the lung during cigarette smoking .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) describes lung disorders characterised by incompletely reversible airflow obstruction .
copd affects populations worldwide1 and is predicted by the world health organization to become the third leading cause of death by 2030 .
cigarette smoke ( cs ) is a leading cause of copd .
cs contains a complex mixture of more than 5,000 chemicals , including reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and carbonyl compounds , which directly injure lung epithelial surfaces2 .
acrolein is the strongest electrophile among all alphabeta - unsaturated aldehydes in cs3 and is present at concentrations of 1 - 10 mum in the airway secretions and tracheal aspirates of smokers4 .
acrolein reacts with nucleophilic sites within proteins , such as cysteine , lysine , and histidine residues , through michael addition and schiff base formation3 , 5 , 6 .
recent studies have indicated that acrolein modification induces functional defects in its targets , such as extracellular matrix ( ecm ) protein7 , apolipoprotein e8 and protein disulphide isomerase , during cs exposure9 .
however , the mechanisms by which cs - induced functional changes in proteins are involved in the pathogenesis of copd , such as the susceptibility to bacterial infection , have not fully been elucidated .
as the primary organs of respiration , the lungs are directly exposed to the air and its constituent pollutants , pathogens , and allergens .
the pulmonary surfactant proteins sp - a and sp - d play important roles in innate immune responses in the airway and alveolar space that protect the lungs from exposure to harmful pathogens10 , 11 .
sp - a and sp - d belong to the c - type lectin superfamily and have host defence functions , including the regulation of mediator production , the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells , and anti - microbial activities12 , over the surface area of the lung .
sp - a , but not sp - d , binds to carbohydrates and to non - carbohydrates such as dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine13 , 14 and lipid a15 .
thus , sp - a plays an important role in the clearance of several varieties of pulmonary bacteria , such as s. aureus , pseudomonas aeruginosa , streptococcus and escherichia coli ( e. coli ) by interacting with such microbial pathogen - associated molecular pattern molecules ( pamps ) 16 - 18 .
recent studies have reported that cigarette smoke exposure can alter the sp - a levels .
the sp - a content in bal fluids is significantly lower in smokers than non - smokers19 .
in addition , rats chronically exposed to cs also have decreased levels of sp - a in bal fluids , but the lung tissue levels of sp - a are not changed20 .
in contrast , some reports have indicated that serum and sputum sp - a levels are significantly higher in smokers than in non - smokers21 - 23 .
in copd patients , the sp - a content in bal fluids is lower in smokers with emphysema than in those without emphysema24 .
in addition , the amount of sp - a in exhaled endogenous particles is lower in patients with copd compared with healthy non - smokers25 .
however , in another study , the lung tissues levels of sp - a have been found to be higher in copd patients compared with controls26 .
the expression of sp - a is also significantly elevated in the lung of cs - exposed mice with emphysema compared with air - exposed mice27 .
as described above , although recent studies have suggested that sp - a may be a potential biomarker for copd , these data reveal a lack of consensus regarding the sp - a levels in smokers and copd patients and the functional effects of cs on sp - a. recent studies have indicated that cs increases the risk of microbial infection by compromising the innate immune response , and this effect is considered to be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of copd28 , 29 .
moreover , kuzmenko et al.30 have indicated that the exposure of sp - a to phospholipid radicals results in oxidative modification and functional inactivation of sp - a. in the present study , we sought to determine whether cs directly modifies the structure of sp - a and if so , whether the modification ( s ) impairs the innate immune functions of sp - a. results detection of acrolein - modified sp - a in the lungs of cs - exposed mice acrolein is present at concentrations of 1 - 10 mum in the airway secretions and tracheal aspirates of smokers4 , and acrolein adducts are found in bronchoepithelial cells , epithelial and smooth muscle cells of the small vessels and inflammatory cells in the lungs of patients with copd31 .
because acrolein is also endogenously formed through oxidation reactions , to determine whether acrolein in cs directly affects sp - a structure and / or function , we examined the lungs of mice exposed to cs for 1 week .
in this model , we observed no differences in morphology ( data not shown ) , sp - a levels in the lung ( fig. 1a ) , or bal fluid ( data not shown ) of lungs exposed to cs for 1 week and non - exposed lungs .
to determine whether sp - a was modified by acrolein during cs exposure , we immunoprecipitated lung lysates with mab5f6 , an anti - acrolein monoclonal antibody specific for nepsilon - ( 3 - formyl - 3,4 - dehydropiperidino ) lysine ( fdp - lysine ) , the main product formed by the reaction of acrolein with lysine residues3 , 32 .
the immunoprecipitated materials were then subjected to western blot analysis with an anti - sp - a antibody .
acrolein - modified sp - a was more abundant in the lung extracts from cs - exposed mice than non - exposed mice ( fig. 1a ) .
however , several lung lysates in cs - exposed mice showed a decreased abundance of acrolein - modified sp - a. therefore , we determined the levels of aldehyde adducts of sp - a by using the aldehyde reactive probe n - ( aminoxyacetyl ) - n ' - biotinylhydrazine ( arp ) .
similar to the fig. 1a , arp - modified sp - a was also induced in cs - exposed lungs compared with non - exposed lung ( supplementary fig. s1 ) .
we next performed immunofluorescence staining of lung sections to examine the localisation of sp - a and acrolein adducts after cs exposure .
as shown in fig. 1b , sp - a was expressed at similar levels in the alveolar cells of cs - exposed lungs and non - exposed lungs , whereas acrolein adducts were detected at markedly higher levels in the bronchioles and alveolar cells of cs - exposed lungs compared with non - exposed lungs .
moreover , acrolein staining partially overlapped sp - a staining in alveolar cells .
these results indicated that lung sp - a was modified by acrolein after cs exposure for 1 week .

these experiments were performed with n = 8 mice per group , and representative results are shown .
acrolein - hsp - a adducts after treatment with cse or acrolein to clarify whether cs and acrolein could directly modify sp - a , we incubated purified recombinant human sp - a ( hsp - a , 5 mum ) with vehicle , acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ; equivalent to a 2:1 or 20:1 molar ratio of acrolein to sp - a , respectively ) , or cs extract ( 10 %) at 37 degreesc for 2 , 4 , or 24 h. of note , a recent study has shown that buffers containing > 100 mm tris - hcl and / or with ph > 8.0 interfere with the formation of acrolein - bovine serum albumin adducts33 .
in this study , we performed these incubations in 5 mm tris - hcl buffer at ph 7.4 .
at the end of the incubation , the treated hsp - a samples were subjected to reducing sds - page and western blotting with anti - sp - a antibody .
we detected no significant differences in the formation of acrolein - hsp - a adducts when the incubation was performed in phosphate - buffered saline and 5 mm tris - hcl buffer , ph 7.4 ( data not shown ) .
as shown in fig. 2a , the staining of sds - page gels revealed that the major species of hsp - a was monomeric , regardless of the presence of acrolein or cse .
although hsp - a dimers were formed after incubation with cse or 10 mum acrolein for 24 h , several oligomeric forms were detectable after incubation with 100 mum acrolein for 24 h ( fig. 2a , arrows ) .
next , to determine whether lysine residues in hsp - a were modified by acrolein , we performed western blotting with anti - acrolein antibody ( mab5f6 ) .
acrolein adducts of the hsp - a monomer and dimer were detected in the 10 mum acrolein - and cse - treated samples , and several oligomers were detectable after incubation with 100 mum acrolein for 24 h ( fig. 2b left ) .
these data suggested that exposure to cse induces acrolein modification of hsp - a. figure 2 the acrolein modification of recombinant hsp - a by acrolein and cse .
recombinant human sp - a ( 5 microm ) was incubated with vehicle , acrolein ( 10 or 100 microm ) , or cse ( 10 %) at 37 degreesc for the indicated times , and 10 microl aliquots were then subjected to sds - page .

these experiments were performed seven times , and representative results are shown .
aldehyde - hsp - a adducts after treatment with cse or acrolein using an aldehyde reactive probe ( arp ) as the anti - acrolein monoclonal antibody mab5f6 specifically reacts with fdp - lysine , we next determined whether acrolein and cse induced aldehyde adducts in sp - a by using an arp .
as in fig. 2 , arp - labeled hsp - a was markedly induced after a 4 h - incubation with acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ) or cse ( fig. 3a left ) .
thus , acrolein and cse increased the levels of aldehyde - hsp - a adducts .
figure 3 the modification of recombinant hsp - a by acrolein and cse .
recombinant human sp - a ( 5 microm ) was incubated with vehicle , acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ) , or cse ( 10 %) at 37 degreesc for 4 h .
( a ) the amount of aldehyde - protein adducts was determined by using arp .
arp - labeled sp - a was detected by streptavidin blotting ( left ) .
a gel stained with coomassie brilliant blue ( right ) .
( b ) the level of the oxidation of thiols in sp - a was determined by using iam .
iam - labeled sp - a was detected by streptavidin blotting ( left ) .
a gel stained with coomassie brilliant blue ( right ) .
these experiments were performed three times each , and representative results are shown .
free thiols in hsp - a after treatment with acrolein or cse cysteine thiols are well known targets of acrolein .
to determine whether acrolein and cse modify the free thiols in sp - a , we first incubated hsp - a with vehicle , acrolein , or cse and then added biotinylated iodoacetamide ( iam ) , which binds specifically to reactive thiols34 .
notably , the biotinylated iam labelling of hsp - a was markedly decreased after a 4 h incubation with acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ) or cse ( fig. 3b left ) .
thus , cse and acrolein modified the free thiols in hsp - a. secondary structure of acrolein - modified hsp - a a recent study has indicated that cs and acrolein induce structural changes in the protein disulphide isomerase by decreasing its ellipticity and helical content9 .
to determine whether acrolein alters the structure of hsp - a , we performed circular dichroism ( cd ) , a technique that is based on the absorption of polarised light and is commonly used to determine the secondary structure and folding properties of proteins35 , 36 .
although acrolein adducts were detected by western blotting after 4 h incubating acrolein with and hsp - a ( 20:1 molar ratio of acrolein to sp - a ) ( fig. 2c ) , there were no significant differences in the cd spectra of hsp - a incubated with vehicle or acrolein for the same time ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
these results therefore suggested that acrolein modification does not affect the secondary structure of hsp - a. identification of acrolein modification sites in hsp - a the potential targets of acrolein within proteins include the nucleophilic side chains of cysteine , histidine , and lysine residues .
to identify the acrolein modification sites in hsp - a , we used nano - lc / maldi - tof ms / ms and analysed the ms / ms data using the mascot daemon software .
hsp - a was treated with acrolein ( 20:1 molar ratio of acrolein to sp - a ) at 37 degreesc for 4 h , incubated with or without nabh4 , and then digested with trypsin to generate peptides .
the maldi - tof ms / ms analysis of trypsin digested acrolein - modified hsp - a was carried out in comparison with unmodified sp - a ( supplementary fig. s4 ) .
under non - reducing conditions ( fig. 4a ( upper ) and supplementary fig. s4a ) , there were five michael addition - type acrolein - modified residues , histidine ( his39 ) , cysteine ( cys155 and cys244 ) , and lysine ( lys180 and lysine221 ) , that formed m + 56 da adducts .
under reducing conditions ( fig. 4a ( lower ) and supplementary figs. s3 and s4b ) , there were three michael addition - type acrolein - modified residues , histidine ( his116 ) and lysine ( lys180 and lys221 ) , that formed m + 58 da adducts and one schiff base reaction - type acrolein modified lysine residue ( lys221 ) that formed a m + 43 da adduct .
overall , these results demonstrated that acrolein induced the modification of six residues ( his39 , his116 , cys155 , lys180 , lys221 , and cys224 ) in hsp - a ( fig. 4b ) .
as shown in fig. 4d , a homology model of the hsp - a neck and crd domains ( residues 104 - 248 ) based on the crystal structure of rat sp - a ( pdb id 1r13 ) was constructed by using swiss - model37 .
the crd in sp - a has a double - loop structure containing short and long loops ( residues 191 - 197 and 219 - 226 , respectively ) .
two of the acrolein - modified residues ( k221 and c224 ) are located in the long loop .

the protein backbone is shown in green , the double - loop structure in the crd domain is shown in blue , and acrolein - modified residues are highlighted in red .
effects of cse and acrolein modification on the anti - microbial functions of sp - a we next determined whether modification by cse and acrolein impaired the innate immune roles of sp - a. to assess the role of sp - a , we used 4 h treatments with acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ) or cse with sp - a. subsequently , dialysis was used to remove unreacted acrolein or cse .
the typical roles of sp - a in innate immunity are to inhibit bacterial proliferation38 and to enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages39 .
as first , we investigated the effects of the hsp - a modifications on its ability to inhibit bacterial growth .
unmodified or modified hsp - a was incubated with e. coli , and bacterial growth was monitored for up to 7 h ( fig. 5a , left ) .
as shown in fig. 5a right , the co - incubation of e. coli with unmodified hsp - a ( 10 mug / ml ) inhibited bacterial growth by 76.0 +/ - 3.0 % at 7 h. however , acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ) - modified and cse - modified sp - a decreased the inhibitory effect of hsp - a by 37.4 +/ - 3.1 % , 38.9 +/ - 4.7 % , and 35.9 +/ - 2.7 % , respectively ( fig. 5a right ) .
next , we examined the effects of hsp - a acrolein modification on its pro - phagocytic function by using the mouse macrophage cell line raw264.7 .
2 h of treatment with unmodified - , acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ) - modified , or cse - modified sp - a had no effect on the cell viability of raw264.7 cells ( data not shown ) .
as shown in fig. 5b , the pretreatment of cells with 50 mug / ml unmodified hsp - a significantly increased the phagocytic index by 1.51 +/ - 0.15 - fold , as compared with vehicle - treated cells .
however , acrolein ( 10 or 100 mum ) - or cse - modified sp - a significantly decreased the ability of sp - a to enhance the phagocytic activity of raw264.7 cells ( 1.14 +/ - 0.03 - fold , 1.24 +/ - 0.06 - fold , and 1.24 +/ - 0.06 - fold , respectively ; fig. 5b ) .
it is well established that sp - a directly binds to several pathogens and receptors12 .
thus , we next examined the binding abilities of sp - a to tlr4 and s. aureus after incubation with acrolein or cse .
because sp - a directly interacts with tlr4 and modulates phagocytosis through the tlr4 - mediated deleterious inflammatory response40 , 41 , we examined the binding of sp - a to tlr4 .
as shown fig. 5c , pre - incubation of hsp - a with 10 microm acrolein , 100 microm acrolein , and cse decreased the binding ability of hsp - a to tlr4 by 77.1 +/ - 4.6 % , 72.6 +/ - 5.2 % , and 71.9 +/ - 2.5 % , respectively. s. aureus is a common bacterium in patients with influenza pneumonia42 , and a recent study has reported that sp - a binds to s. aureus and induces its opsonisation43 .
we next assessed the binding ability of sp - a to s. aureus .
pre - incubation of hsp - a with 10 microm acrolein , 100 microm acrolein , and cse decreased the binding ability of hsp - a to s. aureus by 75.4 +/ - 3.5 % , 77.7 +/ - 5.3 % , and 71.9 +/ - 5.1 % , respectively ( fig. 5d ) .
these data indicated that the innate immune activities of sp - a were markedly attenuated by exposure to cse or acrolein .
figure 5 the cse or acrolein modification of sp - a reduces sp - a - induced inhibition of e. coli growth and phagocytosis by raw264.7 cells .
recombinant human sp - a ( 5 microm ) was incubated with vehicle , acrolein ( 10 or 100 microm ) , or cse ( 10 %) at 37 degreesc for 4 h and then dialyzed to remove the excess unreacted cse or acrolein .
( a ) cultures of e. coli were mixed with vehicle or 10 microg / ml of unmodified sp - a , acrolein ( 10 or 100 microm ) - modified sp - a , or cse - modified sp - a and incubated at 37 degreesc for 7 h. e. coli growth was measured by absorbance at 600 nm ( left ) .

discussion cs has been shown to cause defects in the function of the innate immunity in the lung28 , 44 - 46 , but how it promotes infection and lung disease is not fully understood .
the results of this study suggest that the modification of sp - a by acrolein is one mechanism by which cs may be detrimental to the innate immune response .
acrolein present in cs is one of the most important environmental risk factors for copd47 ; thus , we examined whether acrolein directly affected sp - a. we found that acrolein - and aldehyde - modified sp - a were detectable in the alveolar cells in the mouse lung within 1 week of cs exposure ( fig. 1 and supplementary fig. s1 ) .
fully assembled sp - a is an octadecamer that forms a bouquet - like structure ( fig. 6 ) .
sp - a has a collagen - like n - terminal region and a c - type carbohydrate recognition domain ( crd ) ( fig. 4c ) .
we and others have suggested that supratrimeric oligomerisation may be important for the function of sp - a in innate immunity40 , 48 .
in the present study , we demonstrated that incubation with cse or acrolein induces the formation of high molecular weight oligomers , acrolein - lysine adducts , and aldehyde adducts in hsp - a ( figs 2 and 3 ) .
however , acrolein modification did not affect the secondary structure of hsp - a , as shown by cd. we assessed the site ( s ) of acrolein modification by using nano - lc / maldi - tof ms / ms analysis and identified six specific acrolein - modified sites ( h39 , h116 , c155 , k180 , k221 , and c224 ) .
the crd in sp - a has a double - loop structure containing short and long loops ( residues 191 - 197 and 219 - 226 , respectively ) that are required for ca2 + - dependent carbohydrate binding17 , 49 .
two of the acrolein - modified residues ( k221 and c224 ) are located in the long loop ( fig. 4d ) , thus raising the possibility that cs exposure might alter carbohydrate binding .
figure 6 a model of the possible involvement of damaged sp - a in cs - induced innate immune dysfunction .
( a ) the lung is continuously exposed to airborne pathogens .
sp - a protects the lung by inhibiting bacterial growth and inducing macrophage phagocytic activity12 .
( b ) sp - a damage by cs attenuates its ability to inhibit bacterial growth and induce macrophage phagocytosis .
the structural and functional disruption of sp - a may thus contribute to cs - induced innate immune dysfunction .
several studies have investigated the mechanisms by which cs increases the risk of microbial infection28 , 50 .
recent reports have shown that copd exacerbation is associated with increased systemic inflammation triggered by respiratory bacteria and viruses51 , 52 .
in addition , kirkham et al.7 have indicated that cs - , acrolein - , or 4 - hydroxynoneral - modified ecm proteins promote macrophage adhesion and result in impaired to phagocytosis of macrophage7 .
sp - a also plays an important role in innate immune responses to eliminate microbes in the lung12 , and consequently , sp - a - deficient mice exhibit defects in microbial clearance11 .
among the roles played by sp - a in the innate immune response , we focused on its bacterial growth - inhibitory and macrophage pro - phagocytic activities .
notably , a 4 h incubation with cse or acrolein was sufficient to significantly decrease both activities of hsp - a ( fig. 5a and b ) .
furthermore , the binding affinities of sp - a to tlr4 and s. aureus were also significantly decreased ( fig. 5c and d ) .
because we found that acrolein modification significantly impaired the innate immune functions of hsp - a , our results suggested that the acrolein modification of the crd domain might be involved in the decreased ability of modified sp - a to bind to microbes and receptors and promote macrophage phagocytosis .
under normal circumstances , sp - a has anti - microbial abilities , such as inhibiting bacterial growth and enhancing macrophage phagocytosis in the lung12 ( fig. 6a ) .
however , during cs exposure , lungs are exposed to various type of chemicals , including ros and acrolein2 .
we showed that cs increases the acrolein modification of sp - a , especially in the long loop , thereby impairing the innate immune abilities of sp - a ( fig. 6b ) .
because innate immune responses are key regulators of the pathogenesis of copd , our observations suggest that acrolein - modified sp - a may be involved in cs - mediated suppression of innate immunity .
further investigation will be required to determine whether the structural and functional defects of sp - a induced by cs are involved in the pathogenesis of copd .

briefly , eight - week - old female c57bl / 6 mice were exposed to the smoke from 4 unfiltered cigarettes for one hour everyday over a period of a week .
the control mice were not exposed to air in the chamber , but maintained with the cs - exposed mice .
the mice tolerated cs exposure without any obvious evidence of toxicity ( carboxyhaemoglobin levels of 10 % and no weight loss ) .
western blot analysis mice were sacrificed 24 h after the final cs exposure to remove acute inflammation caused by smoke .
lung tissues were collected and homogenized in a lysis buffer ( cell lysis buffer : 20 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) , 150 mm nacl , 1 mm na2edta , 1 mm egta , 1 % triton , 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate , 1 mm , beta - glycerophosphate , 1 mm na3vo4 , and 1 microg / ml leupeptin ; obtained from cell signaling technology , danvers , ma ) containing complete protease inhibitor ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) .
protein samples were separated by sds - page and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( pvdf ) membranes ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , usa ) .
then , the membranes were incubated with blocking buffer ( block ace , ds pharma biomedical , osaka , japan ) .
next , the pvdf membranes were probed with the primary antibodies against sp - a ( ls - c312616 , lifespan biosciences , inc , seattle , wa ) or beta - actin ( 4967 , cell signaling technology ) .
after incubation with a horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) - conjugated anti - mouse ( w4021 ) or anti - rabbit ( w4011 ) antibody ( promega , fitchburg , wi ) , the immunoreactive bands were visualised using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( bd biosciences , franklin lakes , nj ) and imaged with an imagequant las - 4000 system ( ge healthcare , chicago , il ) .
the primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in immunoreaction enhancer solution ( can get signal , toyobo life science , osaka , japan ) .
immunoprecipitation protein g - sepharose 4 fast flow beads ( ge healthcare ) were incubated with an anti - acrolein antibody ( mab5f6 ; jaica , shizuoka , japan ) in washing buffer ( dulbecco 's phosphate - buffered saline containing 0.1 % tween 20 ) at 4 degreesc for 1 h and then washed to remove the unbound antibody .
aliquots of lung lysates ( 500 mug protein ) were incubated with anti - acrolein - protein g - sepharose beads overnight at 4 degreesc .

purification of recombinant hsp - a produced from cho - k1 cells the hsp - a purification procedures have been described previously40 .
briefly , a pee14 vector containing human sp - a1 cdna was transfected into cho - k1 cells , and recombinant hsp - a was expressed using the glutamine synthetase gene expression system .
for protein purification , hsp - a - expressing cho - k1 cells were cultured in serum - free ex - cell 302 medium ( safc biosciences inc. , buchs , switzerland ) for 3 days .
then , the supernatant was collected and applied to a mannose - sepharose column in 20 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.4 ) .
the bound proteins were eluted with 5 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.4 ) containing 50 mm edta and dialyzed against 5 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.4 ) .
preparation of cse cse was prepared as described previously54 from research - grade 3rf4 cigarettes .
cse was prepared fresh for each experiment by bubbling the smoke from one cigarette through 10 ml of 5 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.4 ) in a 15 - ml conical tube for 2.5 min .
the cse solution was filtered through a 0.22 - mum pore filter to remove any residual particles .
the cse preparation was measured on the basis of the absorbance at a wavelength of 320 nm .
100 % cse within absorbance values of 2.5 +/ - 0.2 ( 320 nm ) was used .
acrolein and cse modification of hsp - a purified hsp - a ( 5 mum ) was incubated with 10 or 100 mum acrolein or 10 % cse in 5 mm tris - hcl buffer ( ph 7.4 ) at 37 degreesc .
this buffer was used because buffer containing > 100 mm tris - hcl or at ph >= 8.0 has been shown to interfere with acrolein adduct formation33 .
for use in the assays of bacterial growth , macrophage phagocytosis , and binding to bacteria and tlr4 , samples were dialyzed against five changes of the tris - hcl buffer for 48 h by using a dialysis cassettes ( slide - a - lyzer dialysis cassette , 3,500 mwco , thermo fisher scientific ) , to remove the excess unreacted cse or acrolein .

an aliquot of sp - a ( 45 mul ) was incubated with 5 mul of biotinylated arp ( 1 mm ) at 37 degreesc for 1 h. samples were resolved by sds - page and transferred to a pvdf membrane , and the membrane was incubated with hrp - conjugated streptavidin .
the reactive bands were visualised using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( bd biosciences ) and analysed using an imagequant las 4000 system .
free thiol labelling with biotin iodoacetamide free thiols were detected by labelling with n - ( biotinoyl ) - n ' - ( iodoacetyl ) ethylenediamine ( biotin iam ; molecular probes ) 34 .
an aliquot of sp - a ( 5 mum , 10 mul ) was incubated with 40 mul biotinylated iam labelling buffer ( 50 mm pipes ( ph 7.4 ) , 50 mum diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid , and 100 mum biotin iam ) for 30 min at room temperature .
beta - mercaptoethanol ( 50 mm ) was then added for 15 min to stop the thiol labelling .
the samples were resolved by sds - page and transferred to a pvdf membrane , and the membrane was incubated with hrp - conjugated streptavidin ( bd biosciences ) .
the reactive bands were visualised using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit ( bd biosciences ) and analysed using an imagequant las 4000 system .
nanoscale liquid chromatography - matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionisation time - of - flight tandem mass spectrometry ( nano - lc / maldi - tof ms / ms ) analysis of acrolein adducts the procedure used for this analysis has been described previously55 .
hsp - a ( 25 mum ) was incubated with acrolein ( 500 mum ) at 37 degreesc for 4 h. after removal of the excess unreacted acrolein with a pd spintrap g25 , the samples were reduced with 100 mm nabh4 for 3 h at room temperature , neutralised with 2 n hcl , and precipitated with chloroform / methanol .
the precipitated protein was dissolved in 8 m urea and 50 mm nh4hco3 , reduced with 10 mm tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) phosphine hydrochloride , and alkylated with 2 - iodoacetamide .
the alkylated sample was digested by using sequencing - grade modified trypsin ( promega ) in the presence of 0.01 % proteasemax surfactant ( promega ) for 1 h at 50 degreesc .
the recovered peptides were then resolved by reverse - phase nano - lc ( dina nano lc system ; kya tech , tokyo , japan ) and then directly fractionated onto a maldi target plate with alpha - cyano - 4 - hydroxycinnamic acid by a spotter ( dina nano lc system ) .
maldi - ms and ms / ms were performed on an absciex tof / tof 5800 system ( ab sciex , tokyo japan ) .
the ms / ms data were processed and subjected to database searches by using mascot daemon ( matrixscience ) .
assay of bacterial growth e. coli strain k12 ( dh5alpha ; takara , shiga , japan ) was transfected with plasmid pcdna3.1 ( invitrogen ) to confer ampicillin resistance38 and grown in lb buffer with 50 mug / ml ampicillin .
bacterial growth was monitored by measurement of the absorbance at 600 nm ( od600 ) .
when the cultures reached the mid - logarithmic phase (~ 0.6 - 0.8 od ) , a 10 - mul aliquot was added to 2 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.4 ) containing 10 % lb , 50 mug ampicillin , and 10 mug / ml hsp - a. the tubes were shaken at 300 rpm for up to 7 h , and the od600 was monitored using a spectrophotometer ( u - 3010 , hitachi , tokyo , japan ) .

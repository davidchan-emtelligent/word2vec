abnormal embryo cortisol level causes developmental defects and poor survival in zebrafish ( danio rerio ) .
however , no study has demonstrated that maternal stress leads to higher embryo cortisol content in zebrafish .
we tested the hypothesis that maternal stress - associated elevation in cortisol levels increases embryo cortisol content in this asynchronous breeder .
zebrafish mothers were fed cortisol - spiked food for 5 days , to mimic maternal stress , followed by daily breeding for 10 days to monitor temporal embryo cortisol content .
cortisol treatment increased mean embryo yield , but the daily fecundity was variable among the groups .
embryo cortisol content was variable in both groups over a 10 - day period .
a transient elevation in cortisol levels was observed in the embryos from cortisol - fed mothers only on day 3 , but not on subsequent days .
we tested whether excess cortisol stimulates 11betahsd2 expression in ovarian follicles as a means to regulate embryo cortisol deposition .
cortisol treatment in vitro increased 11beta hsd2 levels sevenfold , and this expression was regulated by actinomycin d and cycloheximide suggesting tight regulation of cortisol levels in the ovarian follicles .
we hypothesize that cortisol - induced upregulation of 11betahsd2 activity in the ovarian follicles is a mechanism restricting excess cortisol incorporation into the eggs during maternal stress .

introduction plasma cortisol , the primary corticosteroid in teleosts , levels increase in response to stressor exposure in fishes [ 1 ] .
this involves the activation of hypothalamus - pituitary - interrenal ( hpi ) axis , including the release of corticotropin releasing factor from the hypothalamus , which stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) [ 2,3 ] .
acth acts on the interrenal tissue ( analogous to the adrenal gland in mammals ) to release cortisol into the circulation .
cortisol acts on target tissues to bring about physiological changes essential to regain homeostasis , and this is mediated by non - genomic and genomic signalling , including glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor activation [ 4,5 ] .
target tissue regulation of cortisol action also involves the inactivation of this steroid to its inactive metabolite cortisone by the enzyme 11beta - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 ( 11betahsd2 ) [ 3 ] .
in teleosts , hpi axis activation commences only after hatch , while maternally derived cortisol plays an important role in early embryo development prior to de novo cortisol synthesis [ 4 ] .
egg - laying vertebrates transfer maternal hormones , including cortisol into the egg during vitellogenesis [ 6,7 ] .
consequently , maternal stress and the attendant elevation in cortisol levels may lead to abnormal embryo cortisol content in fishes and the associated developmental dysfunction and reduced offspring viability [ 8 - 12 ] .
recent studies have demonstrated that an abnormal increase in embryo cortisol levels causes developmental defects in zebrafish ( danio rerio ) [ 4 ] , including abnormal craniofacial phenotype [ 13 ] and cardiac defects [ 14 ] .
studies in viviparous animals have shown that fetal blood cortisol levels are tightly regulated to buffer the harmful effects of glucocorticoids on development [ 15 ] .
the placental upregulation of 11betahsd2 by elevated maternal plasma cortisol levels is a mechanism protecting the fetus from the harmful effects of this steroid excess [ 16 ] .
however , it is not known whether this excess stress steroid checkpoint exists in the ovarian follicles of oviparous animals .
most studies in fishes used exogenous cortisol manipulation of the embryos to mimic a maternal stress scenario [ 4,13,14 ] .
no study has examined whether maternal stress will lead to excess cortisol deposition in the embryos of the asynchronous breeding zebrafish .
given the finding that excess zygotic cortisol levels influences developmental trajectories and phenotype in zebrafish [ 4 ] , we used this species as a model to test the hypothesis that maternal stress leads to the transfers of excess cortisol to the embryos in this asynchronous breeder .
this was tested by feeding mothers control or cortisol - spiked food for 5 days , followed by breeding daily for 10 days to measure temporal changes in embryo cortisol content .
this breeding regimen was followed because the timing of oogenesis to ovulation in zebrafish is around 10 days [ 17 ] .
we also carried out an in vitro study with isolated ovarian follicles from unstressed zebrafish mothers to determine whether elevated cortisol levels upregulate the gene encoding the enzyme 11betahsd2 , as a possible mechanism to limit the transfer of excess cortisol to the embryos during maternal stress .
2. material and methods 2.1 animal husbandry adult zebrafish ( tl strain ) were maintained in 10 l tanks on a recirculating system with a 14 : 10 light : dark cycle ( pentair aquatic habitats , apopka , fl , usa ) .
water was maintained at 28degreesc , ph 7.6 and 750 mus conductivity .
animals were fed twice daily with ziegler adult zebrafish diet ( pentair aquatic habitats , apopka , fl , usa ) .
2.2 cortisol treatment twenty - four adult female zebrafish were assigned to each of two 10 l tanks .
one group was fed control zebrafish diet as above , while the other group was fed diet laced with cortisol ( 25 mug cortisol ( g body mass ) - 1 d - 1 ) .
to date , no study has administered cortisol via feed to elevate endogenous cortisol levels in zebrafish ; however , this is a commonly used technique in other teleosts to limit endogenous cortisol elevation due to handling of fish for injections [ 18 ] .
as per these studies , zebrafish diet was prepared by soaking food pellets in 100 % ethanol either alone ( control ) or with ( 0.5 mg per g feed ) hydrocortisone ( sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo , usa ) and allowing the ethanol to evaporate as previously described [ 18 ] .
fish were maintained in a recirculating system at a density of 3.5 g l - 1 and were fed 2.5 % of their body weight twice per day .
the fish received an equivalent of 25 mug cortisol ( g body mass ) - 1 d - 1 .
we carried out preliminary studies to decide on the cortisol levels in the feed to mimic a maternal stress scenario .
fish were held under these conditions for 5 days , after which six fish from each group were sampled for measuring maternal cortisol levels .
the remaining fish were transferred to breeding tanks , both groups were fed as in s2.1 , and bred from the following day onwards for 10 days .
2.3 fish sampling on day 5 , fish ( n = 6 ) from each group were euthanized with an overdose of 2 - phenoxyethanol ( 1 : 1000 dilution ; sigma , oakville , on , usa ) .
they were blotted dry and the body mass ( bm ) , fork length ( fl ) and ovary weight ( ow ) recorded to calculate condition factor ( k = bmx100 / fl3 ) and gonadosomatic index ( gsi = ow / bmx100 ) .
there were no significant differences in either the k or gsi between the two groups .
whole body and ovary were snap frozen on dry ice and stored frozen at - 80degreesc for cortisol analysis later .
2.4 breeding female fish from each treatment ( n = 18 ) were divided among six tanks ( n = 3 per tank ) along with two unexposed males in each tank .
these tanks were divided into two breeding sets of three tanks for each treatment .
each breeding set was bred every other day for a total of 5 spawnings per set over a 10 - day period .
this approach was taken to avoid fatigue , and to maximize the daily embryo yield .
for daily breeding set - up ( at 18.00 h ) , fish were quickly netted and transferred into breeding traps in the same tank , and eggs were collected within 1 h of light ( at 08.00 h ) the following morning .
embryos were counted and pools of 20 were snap frozen on dry ice and stored at - 80degreesc for cortisol analysis .
2.5 cortisol analysis frozen whole body was ground into a powder with a chilled mortar and pestle on dry ice and extracted with diethyl ether ( 1 : 5 w / v ) as described previously [ 19 ] .
embryos were not extracted , as preliminary studies revealed no difference in the cortisol content between the extracted and unextracted embryos .
a competitive elisa , that was validated for zebrafish , was used to quantify cortisol levels in embryos and mothers as described previously [ 20 ] , with modifications .
briefly , high binding 96 - well plates ( immulon hb , vwr ) were coated with 100 mul of cortisol monoclonal antibody ( 1.6 mug ml - 1 ; east coast bio , me , usa ) in phosphate buffered saline ( 1xpbs ; 10x stock : 1.37 m nacl ; 27 m kcl , 18 mm kh2po4 ; na2hpo4 ) for 16 h at 4degreesc .
the plate was then washed with pbs with 0.05 % tween 20 ( 300 mul well - 1 ) , and blocked with 0.1 % bovine serum albumin ( 300 mul well - 1 ; sigma - aldrich ) for 1 h at room temperature .
standards comprised of hydrocortisone ( sigma ) serially diluted ( 0 - 25 ng ml - 1 ) in pbs and 50mul of either standards or samples were added to the wells in duplicate .
cortisol conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( 1 : 1600 dilution ; east coast bio , me , usa ) diluted in pbs was added to each well .
plates were incubated for 2 h , shaking , at room temperature .
the plate was washed as described above , followed by the addition of the detection reagent ( 41 mm tmb and 8 mm tbabh in 200 mm potassium citrate , ph 4 ) .
after 25 min , the reaction was stopped with 1 m sulfuric acid and read at 450 nm using a microplate reader ( versamax , molecular devices , ca , usa ) .
the intra - assay and inter - assay coefficient of variation was 4.3 % and 13.4 % , respectively , with a minimum detection limit of 0.5 ng ml - 1 .
2.6 cortisol regulation by ovarian follicles female fish ( n = 4 ) were euthanized with an overdose of 2 - phenoxyethanol ( 1 : 1000 dilution ; sigma , oakville , on , usa ) .
intact ovaries were removed , and placed in a petri dish of leibovitz 's ( l15 ) medium ( gibco , grand island , ny , usa ) .
ovarian follicles were mechanically dispersed using a pasteur pipette and evenly divided into six wells of a 24 - well plate .
follicles were immediately treated with cycloheximide ( 10 mug ml - 1 ; sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo , usa ) or actinomycin d - mannitol ( 10 mug ml - 1 ; sigma - aldrich ) to block translation and transcription , respectively [ 21 ] .
cortisol ( 100 ng ml - 1 hydrocortisone ; sigma - aldrich ) or vehicle control ( 0.01 % ethanol ) was added 30 min later and the follicles were incubated for 4 h at 28.5degreesc on a shaker .
the follicles were centrifuged at 13 000g for 2 min , media removed , and the tissue stored at - 80degreesc for transcript analysis .
2.7 transcript abundance transcript levels of 11betahsd2 and beta - actin in the ovarian follicles were measured by quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) using gene specific primers as described previously [ 22,23 ] .
total rna was extracted from ovarian follicles using ribozol reagent ( vwr , mississauga , on , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and quantified using a spectradrop micro - volume microplate ( versamax , molecular devices , ca , usa ) .
one microgram of rna was treated with dnase i ( thermo scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) to remove genomic contamination prior to cdna synthesis using the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
transcript levels of 11betahsd2 and beta - actin were measured by qpcr in triplicates using gene specific primers as described previously [ 23 ] .
briefly , 2 min at 94degreesc , 40 cycles of 95degreesc ( 30 s ) and a primer specific anneal temperature ( 30 s ; see below ) , followed by 10 min at 72degreesc .
the 11betahsd2 forward primer ( 5 ' - tgctgctggctgtacttcac - 3 ) and reverse primer ( 5 ' - tgcatccaacttctttgctg - 3 ') had an annealing temperature of 55degreesc and an amplicon size of 123 bp. the beta - actin forward primer ( 5 ' - tgtccctgtatgcctctggt - 3 ') and reverse primer ( 5 ' - aagtccagacggaggatgg - 3 ') amplified a 121 bp region at an annealing temperature of 60degreesc .
a standard curve was used to determine relative transcript abundances according to established protocols [ 22 ] .
all data were normalized to beta - actin , as this transcript remained unchanged between treatments , and the data are expressed as per cent control .
2.8 statistics data are shown as mean +/ - s.e. for overall embryo yield and cortisol levels ( maternal , ovary , overall embryo ) , data were analysed by student 's t - test .
for temporal embryo cortisol levels , a two - way anova was performed ( holm - sidak post hoc ) .
significant interactions were tested using either a student 's t - test ( for treatment ) or one - way anova ( for time effect ) .
a repeated measure one - way anova was performed for the ovarian follicle study ( holm - sidak post hoc ) .
embryo cortisol levels were log transformed to meet the assumptions of normality and equal variance .
untransformed data are shown in all figures .
a significance level ( alpha ) of 0.05 was used in all cases .

4. discussion our results suggest that cortisol - mediated transcriptional upregulation of 11betahsd2 in ovarian follicles may be a key mechanism protecting embryos from elevated cortisol levels associated with maternal stress .
we propose this tight control of embryo cortisol levels , despite the stress - induced elevation of this hormone in the mothers , as a key adaptive strategy to protect the embryo from the harmful effects of cortisol excess [ 4 ] .
it has long been maintained that cortisol is transferred to the developing oocyte during vitellogenesis , and this hormone is essential for early development [ 4,6,7 ] .
indeed , de novo synthesis of cortisol commences only after hatch , and a cortisol hyporesponsive period during embryogenesis is essential for zebrafish development [ 4,23 ] .
this is further justified by the developmental defects and poor survival seen in offspring raised from embryos with abnormal cortisol levels [ 4,13,14 ] .
consequently , it is essential that embryo cortisol levels are tightly regulated within narrow limits for proper development of zebrafish [ 4 ] .
in the present study , feeding of cortisol - spiked food did not affect whole - body cortisol content .
while the reason is unclear , this may be due to the 12 h time - lag between the last feeding and sampling for cortisol measurement .
also , it is important to note that we are measuring whole - body cortisol levels , and this may be masking any changes in the circulating levels of the steroid .
this notion is supported by the higher cortisol content in the ovary of the steroid - treated fish , suggesting a clear compartmentalization in this target tissue and may reflect elevated circulating levels of this hormone .
another factor may be the elevated water temperature , as other cortisol feeding studies have used cool water fish [ 18 ] .
given the bolus route of cortisol administration , and the higher water temperature ( 28.5degreesc ) , it is likely that the steroid is cleared within 12 h in zebrafish .
this is further supported by the observation that plasma cortisol clearance is faster in warm water fish compared with temperate fish [ 21 ] , suggesting a key role for temperature in modulating the clearance rate of this hormone .
our study is the first to report a temporal cortisol profile for embryos from the same asynchronous breeders over a 10 - day period .
the developing oocytes take around 10 days to progress from follicle to a mature egg in zebrafish ( figure 2a ) [ 17 ] .
the yolk bodies begin to form in stage iii oocytes ( day 6 ) [ 24 ] , and this is when steroid hormone incorporation is thought to occur [ 6 ] .
consequently , there would be a temporal delay ( approx. 8 - 9 days ) in the maximal cortisol content of freshly spawned embryos after the elevation in cortisol levels by feeding in the present study .
the transient increase in embryo cortisol content seen only in embryos bred on day 3 and 4 after a 5 - day cortisol feeding supports this temporal delay in cortisol accumulation in the oocytes .
the result suggests that maternal stress - mediated cortisol deposition is not a passive process and actively regulated during oogenesis in zebrafish .
interestingly , the embryo cortisol levels in subsequent days ( greater than 4 days ) of breeding were similar in the cortisol and control groups ( except on day 9 ) , leading to the proposal that a control mechanism at the level of the ovarian follicles may regulate embryo cortisol levels in this asynchronous breeder .
the temporal cortisol content even in the control group is highly variable .
it is unclear if this reflects temporal differences in maternal cortisol content or whether this is a reflection of the frequency of breeding and warrants further study .
to the best of our knowledge the variation in maternal cortisol deposition into the embryo and the associated mechanisms has yet to be studied in an asynchronous breeding fish .
our result demonstrates for the first time that 11betahsd2 transcript levels in zebrafish ovarian follicles are upregulated in response to elevated cortisol stimulation in vitro ( figure 3 ) .
11betahsd2 is a key corticosteroid - silencing enzyme that catalyses the conversion of this steroid to its inactive metabolite cortisone [ 3 ] .
this enzyme is active in the zebrafish ovary , including the theca and granulosa cells during early stages of oogenesis [ 25 ] , and can be inhibited by 18beta - glycyrrhetinic acid ( 18beta - ga ) , a 11betahsd2 inhibitor [ 19 ] , suggesting a key role for this enzyme in ovarian cortisol catabolism .
bioinformatics analysis revealed three putative glucocorticoid response elements in the promoter region of zebrafish 11betahsd2 [ 19 ] , suggesting transcriptional regulation of this enzyme by cortisol in zebrafish follicles .
in the present study , this was confirmed by a reduction in cortisol - induced 11betahsd2 transcript levels by the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin d. also , treatment with cycloheximide elevated the transcript levels in the cortisol group over and above that seen with just the steroid alone ( figure 3 ) .
the elevation in 11betahsd2 transcripts in the cycloheximide group may include accumulation of basally expressed transcripts due to the translational blockade , along with newly transcribed mrna in response to cortisol stimulation .
based on this result , we propose that stress - induced cortisol level increases 11betahsd2 mrna turnover in zebrafish ovarian follicles leading to enhanced breakdown of this steroid to its inactive metabolite cortisone .
the tight autoregulation of cortisol in the ovarian follicles due to upregulation of 11betahsd2 expression may be a key mechanism that limits the transfer of excess cortisol to the embryos from stressed mothers .
based on the transient elevation in embryo cortisol content , our current working model is that oocytes undergoing vitellogenesis at the time of exposure to cortisol will incorporate this steroid into the oocytes of asynchronously breeding fish ( figure 4 ) .
however , in response to exposure to cortisol excess , pre - vitellogenic follicles will upregulate 11betahsd2 in the theca / granulose cells and this may limit any further incorporation of excess cortisol into the oocytes during subsequent vitellogenesis ( figure 4 ) .
we propose the observed transient rise in embryo cortisol content seen only on day 3 and 4 embryos , but not on subsequent days in the present study , may represent the steroid incorporation during a narrow window prior to the upregulation of 11betahsd2 by cortisol exposure .
studies are underway to test this in vivo by exposing either unstressed or stressed zebrafish mothers to 11betahsd2 inhibitor 18beta - ga and measuring cortisol deposition in the oocytes and zygote .
we propose that the function of 11betahsd2 in the zebrafish ovarian follicles corresponds to its role in the placenta of mammals , that is , protecting fetal tissue from exposure to elevated maternal cortisol levels [ 15,16 ] .
therefore , the ability of the ovarian follicles to regulate cortisol levels may be a highly conserved phenomenon in both the oviparous and viviparous vertebrates to limit the negative effects of cortisol on developmental programming events [ 4 ] .
however , studies have shown a correlation between maternal stress / cortisol levels and elevated embryo cortisol content in other fishes [ 8 - 12 ] , suggesting other factors , including species specificity , ovarian hormonal concentration and / or dysregulation of 11betahsd2 , that could potentially influence maternal transfer of this steroid .
figure 4 .
working model for maternal deposition of cortisol into zebrafish oocytes .
in oocyte development , cortisol ( blue ) is incorporated during vitellogenesis , along with vitellogenin ( yellow ) .
therefore , excess cortisol may be deposited in the embryos in response to maternal stress and this is represented in the bottom panel of the figure ; the cortisol content shown is based on the highest level observed in the breeding study ( approx. 35 pg per embryo on day 3 ; figure 2c ) .
given that zebrafish are asynchronous breeders , oocytes are at multiple stages in the ovarian follicles and , therefore , pre - vitellogenic oocytes will also be exposed to cortisol excess during maternal stress .
we propose these pre - vitellogenic oocytes will upregulate 11betahsd2 levels ( by 4 h ; figure 3 ) in the theca / granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte ( top panel ) in response to cortisol excess .
this will result in the breakdown of cortisol to cortisone , thereby preventing excess maternal cortisol from being incorporated into the oocytes during subsequent vitellogenesis .
this is reflected in the basal embryo cortisol levels ( approx. 4 pg per embryo ; figure 2c ) seen in the cortisol group on days more than 4 days of breeding .
an interesting finding from this study was that the fecundity was higher in the cortisol - treated mothers compared with the fed controls .
although this was not consistent daily , the majority of the days showed higher fecundity in the cortisol group .
increased fecundity has been shown previously in rainbow trout ( oncorhynchus mykiss ) that were stressed early in vitellogenesis , compared with control fish or fish that were stressed late in oocyte maturation [ 26 ] .
most studies have focused on synchronously breeding salmonids , while little is known about stress / cortisol effects on asynchronous breeders [ 27 ] .
our results suggest that maternal stress , specifically increased cortisol stimulation , may act as a stimulus to increase spawning in the asynchronously breeding zebrafish .
this cortisol - mediated increase in fecundity may be an adaptive strategy to ensure procreation during periods of stress .
indeed , there is evidence to support the hypothesis that cortisol may have a stimulatory effect on maturation processes [ 28,29 ] , but the mechanism remains to be elucidated .
overall , maternal stress and the associated elevation of cortisol levels may lead to transfer of excess cortisol to the embryos in the asynchronously breeding zebrafish .
however , our results suggest that this elevated cortisol deposition is transient .
we hypothesize that vitellogenic oocytes may be susceptible to excess steroid uptake , and this occurs only within a small window before the upregulation of 11betahsd2 activity in the ovarian follicles in response to higher cortisol content .
this will result in the breakdown of cortisol to cortisone , thereby preventing any further steroid incorporation into the developing oocytes .
we propose that this tight maternal control of oocyte cortisol deposition is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon to effectively regulate and reduce excess cortisol incorporation in developing embryos , as excess zygotic cortisol content leads to developmental dysfunction [ 4 ] .

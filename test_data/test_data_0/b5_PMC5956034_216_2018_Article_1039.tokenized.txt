the use of polymers for the delivery of drugs has increased dramatically in the last decade .
to ensure the desired properties and functionality of such substances , adequate characterization in terms of the molar mass ( m ) and size is essential .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in the m and size of pvp - b - pamps when the amounts of the synthesis reactants in the two - step radical reaction were varied .
the determination of the m and size distributions was performed by an asymmetric flow field - flow fractionation ( af4 ) system connected to multiangle light scattering ( mals ) and differential refractive index ( dri ) detectors .
the results show that the m of the polymers varies depending on the relative amounts of the reactants and that af4 - mals - dri is a powerful characterization technique for analyzing polymers .
using af4 , it was possible to separate the product of the first radical reaction ( pvp - cta ) into two populations .
the first population had an elongated , rod - like or random coil conformation , and the second had a conformation corresponding to homogeneous spheres or a microgel structure .
pvp - b - pamps had only one population , which had a rod - like conformation .
the molar masses of pvp - cta and pvp - b - pamps found in this study were higher than those reported in previous studies .
keywords changes in molar mass synthesis pvp - b - pamps asymmetric flow field - flow fractionation ( af4 ) swedish international development agency ( sida / sarec ) issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh germany , part of springer nature 2018 introduction in recent decades , the use of polymers as a means of drug delivery has increased .
polymeric micelles have become an attractive option because of their capability to protect and extend the lifetime of a drug .
polymeric micelles can be divided in two categories : hydrophobically assembled micelles and polyion complex micelles , where cationic and anionic segments form polyion complex micelles .
in the present study , pvp ( poly - vinylpyrrolidone ) acts as the hydrophilic nonionic segment and pamps ( poly - 2 - acrylamido - 2 - methyl - 1 - propanesulfonic acid ) as the polyanion segment for the synthesis of pvp - b - pamps [ 1 ] .
in this sense , the use of pvp in polymeric micelles has been demonstrated to form microgels , which showed no toxicity when they were used in saline solutions as a blood extender [ 2 , 3 ] .
in addition , pvp - b - pamps in combination with peg - b - p4vp could be used as a drug delivery system [ 4 ] .
the physical and mechanical properties of polymers depend on the molecular architecture , molar mass ( m ) , size , and distributions [ 5 ] .
the two fundamental properties , the size and m of polymers , can be experimentally determined in a number of ways .
batch - mode determinations can be performed with techniques such as viscometry , light scattering , and osmometry .
these techniques provide differently weighted size or m averages , but little or no information is obtained on the size or m distributions .
to generate an accurate characterization , separation methods connected to various detectors are typically used .
the most commonly used separation method for polymers is size exclusion chromatography ( sec ) .
in this technique , the size and m can be estimated either with a standard calibration curve or by absolute determination of both the m and average size by utilizing online multiangle light scattering ( mals ) in combination with concentration determination via , for instance , differential refractive index ( dri ) detection .
sec has some limitations , which include the adsorption of sample components to the column , the degradation of large species due to shear forces in the column , and the co - elution effects that can arise , for instance , from the presence of branches in the polymers [ 6 - 8 ] .
this can produce abnormal elution effects that make the determination of the m distribution difficult or impossible [ 8 , 9 ] .
some of the drawbacks of sec can be avoided by instead utilizing asymmetric flow field - flow fraction ( af4 ) [ 10 - 12 ] .
af4 has been shown to be suitable for the analytical separation of macromolecules and aggregated structures , and interest in the method has increased in recent years [ 13 , 14 ] .
the separation method is based on the longitudinal laminar flow of a carrier liquid through a separation channel in combination with a crossflow in a perpendicular direction over the channel .
the crossflow forces the sample components towards the ultrafiltration membrane , which acts as an accumulation wall .
at the accumulation wall , the components are confined to a thin concentrated layer .
in brownian mode af4 , the crossflow - induced transport is counteracted by the diffusion of the sample components and at steady state , a concentration profile is established in the sample zone .
the result is that sample components with a higher diffusion coefficient ( d ) , on average , will be distributed farther away from the accumulation wall than components with a lower d. as the flow profile along the separation channel is parabolic , the components distributed farther away from the accumulation wall will travel faster downstream and , thus , size separation is achieved .
one important parameter of the ultrafiltration membrane , which makes up the accumulation wall , is the cut - off , which must be sufficiently low to keep the sample in the channel as sample components smaller than the cut - off may permeate through the membrane .
an af4 system is most suitably connected to a mals detector and a concentration detector ( such as dri ) in a similar way as an sec system for the determination of size and m distributions .
as mentioned above , the adequate characterization of polymers is essential to ensuring the desired properties and functionality of the polymers .
in this study , the aim was to apply af4 - mals - dri in order to evaluate the changes in m and size when three different amounts of the reactants were varied in the two consecutive radical reactions that occur during the synthesis of pvp - b - pamps .

methods synthesis of pvp - b - pamps poly ( n - vinyl - pyrrolidone ) - block - poly ( 2 - acrylamido - 2 - methyl - 1 - propanesulfonic acid ) ( pvp - b - pamps ) was achieved through two consecutive radical reactions with 1 - vinyl - 2 - pyrrolidone ( vp ) and 2 - acrylamido - 2 - methyl - 1 - propanesulfonic acid ( amps ) , respectively .
reversible addition - fragmentation chain transfer ( raft ) using dmp and pvp , respectively , as the chain transfer agent ( cta ) controlled the radical reactions .

measurement of the specific refractive index increment ( dn / dc ) the specific refractive index increment ( dn / dc ) was measured using an optilab t - rex differential refractive index detector ( dri ) ( wyatt technology , dernbach , germany ) operating at a wavelength of 658 nm and 35 degreesc .
the flow rate was adjusted to 0.5 ml / min using an agilent 1100 series isocratic pump ( agilent technologies , waldbronn , germany ) with an in - line vacuum degasser and connected to a rheodyne manual injector ( kinesis , st neots , uk ) with a 1 ml sample loop. between the pump and the manual injector , a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane with a 100 nm pore size ( millipore corp. , bedford , ma , usa ) was placed to ensure that particle - free carrier entered the system .
to verify the calibration of the cell in the dri detector , an assay was performed using pre - prepared standard nacl solutions ( wyatt technology , dernbach , germany ) , injecting eight samples with different concentrations ( 0.1 - 5.0 mg / ml concentration range ) .
for analysis of the polymer samples , a series of six different concentrations was injected for each sample .
the sample solutions were prepared by dissolving the dried polymer in carrier liquid ( 1 mg / ml ) .
the composition of the carrier liquid was 10 mm nano3 ( applichem , a3125 , darmstadt , germany ) and 0.02 % nan3 ( bdh , 10369 , poole , uk ) , dissolved in milli - q water .
the remaining five solutions in the 0.1 - 0.8 mg / ml concentration range were prepared by dilution of the 1 mg / ml solution before injection .
the samples were filtered through a 0.20 mum cellulose acetate filter ( vwr syringe filter , 25 mm diameter , leuven , belgium ) .
each analysis was performed in triplicate , and the dn / dc value was determined from the slope of a plot of dri against the concentration .
the concentration used was corrected for the moisture content of the sample , which was determined gravimetrically using a moisture analyzer ( mac 110 / wh , radwag , radom , poland ) .
asymmetric flow field - flow fractionation ( af4 ) the polymer samples were analyzed with af4 - mals - dri using an eclipse 3 + system ( wyatt technology , dernbach , germany ) connected to a dawn heleos ii ( mals ) detector ( wyatt technology , dernbach , germany ) and an optilab t - rex differential refractive index detector ( dri ) ( wyatt technology , dernbach , germany ) .
both detectors operated at a wavelength of 658 nm. an agilent 1100 series isocratic pump ( agilent technologies , waldbronn , germany ) with an in - line vacuum degasser and an agilent 1100 series autosampler delivered the carrier flow and handled the sample injection into the af4 separation channel. between the pump and the channel , a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane with a 100 nm pore size ( millipore corp. , bedford , ma , usa ) was placed to ensure that particle - free carrier entered the channel .
the af4 channel was a long separation channel ( wyatt technology , dernbach , germany ) with trapezoidal geometry ( tip - to - tip length of 26.0 cm and inlet and outlet widths of 2.15 and 0.6 cm , respectively ) and with a nominal thickness of 350 mum .
the ultrafiltration membrane forming the accumulation wall was a regenerated cellulose membrane ( rc ) with a nominal cut - off of 10 kda ( merck millipore , bedford , ma , usa ) .
validation of the performance of the af4 system and the experimentally determined channel thickness was performed with bovine serum albumin ( bsa , sigma , a4378 , st , louis , mo , usa ) solution ( 1 mg / ml , w / v ) according to the procedure described in the literature ( matlab - based software : fffhydrad 2.2 ) [ 15 , 16 ] .
the actual channel height was determined to be 277 mum .
the composition of the carrier liquid was 10 mm nano3 ( applichem , a3125 , darmstadt , germany ) and 0.02 % nan3 ( bdh , 10369 , poole , uk ) , dissolved in milli - q water .
the separation method used a constant detector flow of 1 ml / min .
injection into the channel was performed with a flow rate of 0.2 ml / min for 6 min .
the sample volume injected into the channel was between 80 and 120 mul for an injected sample mass of approximately 80 - 120 mug .
the injected amount was optimized in order to ensure that no overloading occurred , i.e. , the retention time was independent of the amount injected .
after injection , a 4 min focusing / relaxation step was performed prior to elution with a focus flow identical to the initial crossflow .
the crossflow rate was programmed to decay exponentially using the following equation : 1 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ { q }_ c ( t )={ q }_ c ( 0 ){ e }^{\ left ( - \ frac {\ mathit {\ ln } 2 }{ t _{ 1 / 2 }} t \ right )} $$\ end { document } qct = qc0e - ln2t1 / 2twhere qc ( t ) is the crossflow rate as a function of time t after elution begins , qc ( 0 ) is the initial crossflow rate , and t1 / 2 is the half - life of the decay .
for all samples , the elution began with an initial crossflow of 2.4 ml / min , which decreased exponentially over time to 0.12 ml / min , t1 / 2 = 6 min , and then remained constant for 10 min .
finally , the channel was flushed without any crossflow for 10 min before the next analysis .
the recorded mals and dri data were processed using astra software ( ver. 6.1.5.22 , wyatt technology ) .
the m and rrms were obtained from fitting the mals data using the berry method [ 17 , 18 ] by performing a first order fit to the data obtained at scattering detectors 6 - 17 ( angles 42.8degrees - 152.5degrees ) .
the specific refractive index ( dn / dc ) calculated for each sample as described above was used , and the second virial coefficient was assumed to be negligible .
assuming homogeneous distribution of mass and a spherical shape , the apparent density was calculated from the determined m and rrms distributions [ 19 ] .
the apparent density for component i of the sample rhoi is given in the following equation : 2 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ \ widehat {\ rho _ i }=\ frac { m _ i }{ v {\ left ({ r }_{ rms }\ right )}_ i }\ cdotp q $$\ end { document } rhoi ^= mivrrmsi.qwhere m is the molar mass , v is the volume , and q is a scaling constant relating the physical radius of a sphere and rrms .
the mass recovery was determined from the ratio of the mass eluted from the separation channel ( integration of the dri signal ) to the injected mass .

mpc - 26 and mpc - 31 were not significantly different from each other but were different from the rests of the samples .
for the determination of the molar mass , the individual values of dn / dc of each sample were used .
molar mass , size , and conformation af4 - mals - dri was used to determine the weight - average molar mass ( mw ) and z - average root - mean - square radius ( rrms ) .
the analysis was performed in triplicate .
a summary of the results is shown in table 3 .
values of the separation channel recoveries for the first radical reaction were >= 76 % , and those for the second radical reaction were >= 101 % , which means that all or a large amount of the injected sample was analyzed without a major loss of components .

the trend of obtaining higher values for m from af4 than from sec is commonly observed for large polymers .
this trend is often due to the shear degradation in sec .
however , no information regarding the sec columns was given in the previous studies [ 1 , 4 ] .
thus , conclusions regarding the differences in the separation techniques are not possible to make .
figure 4 shows a representative af4 fractogram for samples from the first radical reaction ( mpc - 4 to mpc - 23 ) to yield pvp - cta .
the result shows the presence of two main populations ( fig. 4a ) .
in previous studies , where the polymer was synthesized under similar conditions , the second , larger - size population was not reported in the sec results [ 1 , 4 ] .
as mentioned above , no information about the sec column was given in these studies .
hence , it is not possible to know whether the result could be an artifact of the analysis .
the results in fig. 4 also show that the populations have different conformations .
the first population has different conformational properties , which scale strongly with increasing m ( as shown by a decrease in rrms / rhyd with an increase in m ) .
the lower - m species ( m of approximately 2.5 - 5.104 g / mol , fig. 4b ) have rrms / rhyd = 2.0 to 2.6 , corresponding to an elongated or rod - shaped conformation [ 20 ] .
in the same population , the somewhat higher - m species ( m of approximately 5 - 10.104 g / mol , fig. 4b ) have rrms / rhyd = 1.7 to 2.0 , which suggests a more flexible conformation , i.e. , a random coil [ 20 ] .
for the second and later - eluting population ( see fig. 4c ) , rrms / rhyd shows no scaling with m and has a value of approximately 0.7 .
it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the conformation from this value , as the error in the determination of rrms / rhyd is approximately +/ - 0.1 .
hence , rrms / rhyd = 0.7 +/ - 0.1 could correspond to both a microgel structure ( rrms / rhyd < 0.7 ) [ 21 ] or to a homogeneous - mass spherical object ( rrms / rhyd = 0.775 ) .
as the species are substantially larger and have very different behaviors that scale constantly with m , these results suggest a uniformity in conformation with increasing m , which in turn suggests that the species are supra - molecular aggregates .
it should be noted that the second population represented a very small fraction of the entire sample ( i.e. , a low dri signal , fig. 4a ). fig. 4 af4 fractogram for sample mpc - 5 .

it is possible to observe that mw decreases with an increasing amount of aibn (*) and when dmp () is varied , there was no remarkable variation in mw. thus , dmp had no effect on mw in the investigated range .
there appears to be no clear relationship between mw and the amount of vp () although rather large differences in mw were observed .
moreover , mw was almost the same when 75.6 mmol or 1.84 mmol of vp was used ( see tables 1 and 3 ; mpc - 4 and mpc - 20 , respectively ) , which could mean that 1.84 mmol is the minimal amount of vp needed to enable the synthesis of the polymer. fig. 5 changes in the mw of pvp - cta during the first radical reaction .

this population ( elution times of approximately 19 - 28 min , fig. 6a ) displays a rod - like conformation ( rrms / rhyd = 2.1 - 2.8 , see fig. 6b ) [ 20 ]. fig. 6 af4 fractogram for sample mpc - 24 .

a lower amount of aibn (*) resulted in a slightly higher mw. increases in the amount of amps () caused a decrease in mw , whereas increasing the amount of pvp - cta () caused an increase in mw which means that the mw is regulated by the addition of both reactants ( aibn and pvp - cta ) .
it can be noticed that pvp - cta seems to be the limiting reagent of the mw. a considerable increase in amps ( 0.55 mmol to 21.86 mmol , see tables 1 and 3 ; mpc - 24 and mpc - 28 , respectively ) did not lead to a decrease in mw , as expected according to the results shown in fig. 7. the fact that mw remained similar may have been due to the increase in pvp - cta ( 0.016 mmol to 0.02 mmol ; see table 1 ; mpc - 24 and mpc - 28 , respectively ). fig. 7 changes in the mw of pvp - b - pamps during the second radical reaction .
weight - average molar mass ( g / mol ) versus the amounts of aibn (*) , amps () , and pvp - cta () conclusion in this study , the change in mw when the amounts of the reactants were varied during each radical reaction , which yielded pvp - cta and pvp - b - pamps , was determined using af4 - mals - dri .
for the first radical reaction , pvp - cta was separated in two populations by af4 .
the first population displayed an elongated , rod - like or random coil conformation , and the second population had a very different conformation , which scaled constantly in relation to m , potentially suggesting the presence of supramolecular aggregates .
the presence of supramolecular aggregates has , to the best of our knowledge , not been reported previously in other studies on the same polymer .
additionally , it was found that different mw values of pvp - cta could be obtained by manipulating the amount of aibn , whereas dmp did not have a large effect on mw. in addition , the variation in the amount of vp showed no clear relationship with mw. for the second radical reaction , only one population with a rod - like conformation was found .
moreover , higher amounts of aibn and amps could produce a decrease in mw , whereas varying the amount of pvp - cta caused an increase in mw. it seems that pvp - cta could be the limiting reagent for the synthesis of pvp - b - pamps .
finally , it was shown that , using af4 , it was possible to obtain detailed information regarding pvp - cta and pvp - b - pamps .

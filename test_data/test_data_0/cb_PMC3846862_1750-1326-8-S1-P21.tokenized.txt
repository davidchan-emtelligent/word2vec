sequential proteolytic processing of app , catalyzed by beta - and gamma - secretase , generates the neurotoxic peptide amyloid - beta ( abeta ) , which accumulates in the brain and cause progressive neurodegeneration .
however , app is mainly processed through another pathway , where app is cleaved by alpha - and gamma - secretase , generating the secreted sappalpha fragment .
stimulation of alpha - secretase processing of app constitutes an important therapeutical strategy , not only since it precludes the formation of abeta , but also because the sappalpha fragment has been shown to have neuroprotective properties [ 1 ] .
app was the first plasma membrane protein shown to be o - glcnacylated [ 2 ] , a dynamic post - translational modification involving the attachment of beta - n - acetylglucosamine ( glcnac ) catalyzed by o - glcnac transferase and o - glcnacase .
however , the consequences of app o - glcnacylation have so far not been investigated .
material and methods we have used sirna and pharmacological inhibitors directed against o - glcnacase and o - glcnac transferase to determine these enzymes regulate o - glcnacylation of app .
o - glcnacylated proteins were immunioprecipiated from cell - lysates using an o - glcnac antibody , and app was then detected by western blot using .
the levels of sappalpha and abeta in the cell medium were analyzed using western blot and elisa .
the studies were mainly preformed in human sh - sy5y neuroblastoma cells , but other cell - lines were used as well as a comparison .
results here , we show that o - glcnacase and o - glcnac transferase regulate the level of app that is immunoprecipitated with o - glcnac antibody in human neuroblastoma sh - sy5y cells .
we also show that o - glcnacylation increases alpha - secretase processing , resulting in increased levels of the neuroprotective sappalpha fragment and decreased abeta secretion .
the proteolytic processing of the app homologue , aplp2 , remained unchanged in response to increased o - glcnacylation .
furthermore , the effect of o - glcnacylation on app processing seems to be specific for neuron - like cells , since the levels of sappalpha from the human embryonic kidney cell - line hek293 remains unchanged in response to inhibition of o - glcnacase , whereas the neuroblastoma cell - line sk - n - as show increased sappalpha levels , but not to the same extent as in sh - sy5y cells .
conclusions we conclude that increased o - glcnacylation selectively affects app processing in neuro - like cells .
our results implicate o - glcnacylation as a potential therapeutic target for alzheimer 's disease mattson mp cheng b culwell ar esch fs lieberburg i rydel re evidence for excitoprotective and intraneuronal calcium - regulating roles for secreted forms of the beta - amyloid precursor protein neuron 1993 10 243 254 10.1016 / 0896 - 6273 ( 93 ) 90315 - i 8094963 griffith ls mathes m schmitz b beta - amyloid precursor protein is modified with o - linked n - acetylglucosamine j neurosci res 1995 41 270 278 10.1002 / jnr.490410214 7650762

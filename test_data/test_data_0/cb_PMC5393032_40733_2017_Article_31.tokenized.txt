background little is known about asthma in the elderly as most studies of this condition have not included this patient group .
it is unclear whether leukotriene antagonists benefit older asthmatics .
we studied the effect of adding montelukast to the asthma treatment of elderly subjects .
methods twenty - five subjects 65 years old and older with asthma were evaluated at week 0 , 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , and 17 .
each subject received montelukast 10 mg and placebo each for 8 weeks in a cross - over design .
results montelukast for 4 or 8 weeks did not significantly affect act , daily symptom scores , number of puffs of albuterol , spirometric values , peripheral blood eosinophils , or serum ige vs. baseline or placebo .
similar results were obtained when analyzing subgroups of patients with lower act , lower fev1 , and higher eosinophils .
conclusions in this study of elderly asthmatics , montelukast had no effect on asthma symptoms , number of puffs of albuterol , spirometric values , peripheral blood eosinophils or serum ige .
these results will require confirmation in larger patient cohorts and in patients with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms .
keywords asthma elderly montelukast the sharpe - strumia research foundation of the bryn mawr hospitalssrf2015 - 01 columbo michele issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background about 13 % of the u.s. population is older than 65 years of age and this percentage is expected to double by the year 2050 [ 1 ] .
about 7 % of individuals 65 years old and older have asthma [ 1 ] .
however , little is known about asthma in these patients as few asthma studies have examined this patient group .
older patients with asthma are more likely to be underdiagnosed , undertreated , and hospitalized when compared with younger patients affected by this condition [ 1 ] .
the mortality of older asthmatics is higher than their non asthmatic counterparts [ 1 ] .
the u.s. national institute of aging stated that asthma 's pathophysiology is different in the elderly and there are many challenges in the treatments of these patients [ 1 ] .
leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that play a significant role in the pathogenesis of asthma .
in particular , leukotrienes are important in bronchoconstriction , airway edema , and mucus formation [ 2 , 3 ] .
they appear to decrease eosinophilic inflammation [ 4 ] .
leukotrienes are produced by mast cells , basophils , eosinophils , and other cells [ 3 ] .
montelukast ( singulair ( r )) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist us fda approved for the treatment of asthma in subjects who are 12 months old and older .
its benefits include improved asthma symptoms and spirometric values , and decrease of asthma exacerbations compared to placebo [ 5 ] .
in general , leukotriene inhibitors are considered less effective than inhaled corticosteroids [ 6 ] , but they may be beneficial when added to these drugs [ 7 ] .
there is little information regarding the effect of leukotriene antagonists in elderly asthmatics .
two studies of zafirlukast suggested that this leukotriene antagonist may be less effective in older patients [ 8 , 9 ] .
two open label studies in subjects older than 60 years old showed that treatment with montelukast may provide clinical benefit when added to inhaled corticosteroids [ 10 , 11 ] .
the main purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the effect of adding montelukast to elderly asthmatics' treatment regimen on asthma symptoms assessed by the asthma control test ( act ) ( primary objective ) , daily symptom scores , number of puffs of albuterol , and spirometric values .
this is a randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled , cross - over study .
secondary objectives of this study include investigating whether montelukast in elderly asthmatics affects the number of peripheral blood eosinophils and serum ige levels .
methods this study included six study visits at week 0 , 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , and 17 .
after a one week run - in period , the study subjects were given montelukast and placebo in a cross - over design .
they took montelukast 10 mg and placebo each for 8 weeks .
compliance with the study drugs , based on the returned study bottles and with the daily symptom diaries was very good (> 90 %) .
twenty - five subjects 65 years old and older with asthma completed this study .
twenty - four were caucasian and 1 african - american .
one additional subject discontinued his participation within the first few weeks for reasons unrelated to the study .
allergic sensitization was verified by allergy skin tests for relevant allergens .
current smokers and subjects with > 10 pack / year history of smoking were excluded from this study .
almost all of the study subjects were lifetime nonsmokers .
subjects with recent (< 4 weeks before randomization ) asthma exacerbation or treatment with systemic steroids , and history of hypereosinophilic disorders were also excluded .
treatment with montelukast or other leukotriene antagonist was not allowed for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization .
study participants were instructed to continue their regular asthma treatment , if any , without any change during the study period unless required by an asthma exacerbation .
the study subjects were recruited among interested and eligible patients with asthma followed in a suburban allergy and immunology practice .
spirometric values were obtained according to the ats / ars guidelines by a koko spirometer ( nspire health inc. , longmont , co ) .
the act is a tool that allows patients to report asthmatic symptoms on a scale from 1 ( severe ) to 5 ( no symptoms ) by answering questions about asthma control in the previous 4 weeks .
for the duration of the study , each subject filled a daily diary grading their asthma symptoms on a scale from 0 ( no symptoms ) to 5 ( very severe symptoms ) .
the number of puffs of albuterol was also reported daily .
peripheral blood eosinophils were enumerated and total serum ige measured at the mlh laboratories at weeks 9 and 17 .
the inhaled steroids used by the study subjects were fluticasone ( 14 ) , budesonide ( 4 ) , mometasone ( 3 ) , and beclomethasone ( 1 ) .
inhaled steroid doses are expressed as fluticasone equivalent .
long acting bronchodilators were salmeterol ( 12 ) , formoterol ( 5 ) , and vilanterol ( 1 ) .
data are expressed as the mean +/ - standard deviation and analyzed by the two tailed , paired t test with significance accepted at < 0.05 .
the number of 25 subjects was calculated as previously reported [ 12 ] .
in particular , the goal was set to see a 10 % improvement ( effect size ) of the act score following the treatment with montelukast vs. placebo .
in our earlier study of exhaled nitric oxide measurements in elderly asthmatics [ 13 ] , the mean act score was 22.2 and the standard deviation was 2.8 % ( n = 30 ) .
the calculated standardized effect size is 10 % of 22.2 ( 2.2 )/ 2.8 = 0.8 .
therefore , beta = 0.2 ( 1 / 0.8 ) .
for an alpha of 0.05 ( two tailed t test ) the number necessary to see a 10 % change is 25 .
this study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov ( nct02635334 ) .
results table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the study subjects .
most subjects were atopic ( 80 %) , on inhaled steroids ( 88 %) and long acting bronchodilators ( 72 %) , and had well controlled asthma .

at 8 weeks , daily symptom scores and number of puffs of albuterol per week seem decreased by montelukast when compared to placebo ( table 2 ) .
however , neither of such decreases was statistically significant .
montelukast exerted no effect on act , daily symptom scores , or puffs of albuterol / week when compared to baseline values ( p > 0.54 for all comparisons ) .

however , the fev1 values obtained at 4 and 8 weeks for both montelukast and placebo were reduced when compared to baseline ( p < 0.026 and p < 0.052 for montelukast and < 0.001 and p < 0.002 for placebo , respectively ) .

in these subjects , asthma symptoms and spirometric values were unaffected by montelukast ( data not shown ) .
discussion in this pilot study , we evaluated the effect of adding montelukast to the treatment of elderly subjects with asthma .
this group of patients has been mostly ignored in previous studies of this condition .
two open label studies in asthmatic subjects 60 years old and older showed clinical benefits from adding montelukast to inhaled corticosteroids with or without long acting bronchodilators [ 10 , 11 ] .
such benefits included a reduction of asthma exacerbations [ 10 , 11 ] , reduction of the percentage of days with asthma and short beta - receptor agonist [ 10 ] .
in the present study , adding montelukast for 4 and 8 weeks to our subjects' treatment had no effect on act or spirometric values .
montelukast for 8 weeks appeared to reduce daily symptoms scores and number of puffs of albuterol vs. placebo , but such results did not reach statistical significance , possibly due to the low baseline values .
indeed , a significant limitation of our results is that most study subjects had well controlled asthma .
the lack of effect of montelukast on clinical parameters could have been the result of this limitation .
a previous study showed that montelukast decreases peripheral blood eosinophils [ 6 ] .
another study failed to detect an effect of montelukast on sputum eosinophils when added to inhaled corticosteroids [ 11 ] .
in the present study of elderly asthmatics , montelukast did not affect peripheral blood eosinophils or serum ige levels .
montelukast appeared to decrease eosinophils in subjects with higher baseline blood counts of these cells , but these results did not reach statistical significance possibly due to the small number of observations .
although no clinical benefit of montelukast in these subjects was observed , it can be hypothesized that this subgroup of patients may be more responsive to this drug .
additional limitations of this study include the relatively small number of subjects who were almost exclusively caucasian .
it is possible that a longer duration of treatment might have yielded different results .
it is also possible that montelukast may have a positive effect on other important clinical parameters such as asthma exacerbations and asthma related emergency room visits that could not be assessed in our study .
conclusions in summary , in this study of stable elderly asthmatics , adding montelukast had no effect on asthma symptoms , use of albuterol , spirometric values , or peripheral blood eosinophils .
these results will require confirmation in larger studies enrolling subjects with uncontrolled asthma .

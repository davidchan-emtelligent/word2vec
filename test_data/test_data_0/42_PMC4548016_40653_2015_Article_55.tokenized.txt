children who have experienced early adversities are at risk for behavioral problems and trauma symptoms .
using a two - group , pre - post intervention design , the current study evaluated the effectiveness of a parent training utilizing trust - based relational intervention , a trauma - informed , attachment - based intervention , in reducing behavioral problems and trauma symptoms in at - risk adopted children .
children of parents in the treatment group ( n = 48 ) demonstrated significant decreases in behavioral problems on the strengths and difficulties questionnaire and significant decreases in trauma symptoms on the trauma symptoms checklist for young children after intervention .
scores for children in a matched - sample control group did not change .
findings suggest that trust - based relational intervention is effective at addressing many behavioral problems and trauma symptoms in children with histories of adversities .
keywords trust - based relational intervention trauma - informed intervention attachment intervention out - of - home placement adopted children parent training child behavior trauma symptoms issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer international publishing 2015 children who have experienced multiple and / or chronic adversities early in life , such as maltreatment , deprivation , and institutionalization , are at risk for poor developmental outcomes , including behavioral problems that can persist or get worse over time ( becker weidman 2009 ; kisiel et al. 2009b ) .
consistent with histories of early adversities , most children who have experienced out - of - home care , including institutional and foster placements , have experienced trauma ( for a review of the literature , see dovran et al. 2012 ) .
for example , children in out - of - home care are at an increased risk for abuse and neglect ( euser et al .
2013 , 2014 ; hobbs and hobbs 1999 ; johnson and dole 1999 ) .
in addition to high rates of maltreatment , children in institutional or foster care have , by definition , experienced separation from or loss of the caregiver .
these children are also at risk for having experienced other traumatic circumstances , including witnessing violence in the home or in armed conflict , exposure to natural disasters , and other chaotic or threatening environments ( hoksbergen and van dijkum 2001 ) .
behavioral problems are one of the most salient challenges in caring for children with histories of early adversities .
there is evidence of behavioral problems in post - institutionalized internationally adopted children ( e.g. , gunnar et al .
2007 ) , in at - risk domestically adopted children , and in mixed adoption samples ( e.g. , groza and ryan 2002 ; kocovska et al. 2012 ) .
findings include problems with internalizing behaviors ( fisher et al. 1997 ) , externalizing behaviors ( hoksbergen et al. 2004 ; merz and mccall 2010 ; smith et al .
2000 ; verhulst 2000 ) , attention problems ( merz and mccall 2010 ; groza 1999 ; gunnar et al .
2007 ) , thought problems ( groza 1999 ; hoksbergen et al. 2004 ) and social problems ( gunnar et al. 2007 ; hoksbergen et al. 2004 ) .
these behavioral problems can be extreme and / or pervasive ( e.g. , groza and ryan 2002 ; gunnar et al. 2007 ; maclean 2003 ; van der vegt et al. 2009 ) .
the long - term trajectory for children who experience early adversity is often troublesome , with longitudinal research suggesting that at - risk adopted children exhibit increasingly more problem behaviors as they reach adolescence ( verhulst and versluis - den bieman 1995 ; verhulst 2000 ) and that early adversity increases the level of behavioral problems into adulthood ( van der vegt et al. 2009 ) .
these studies provide evidence that the long - term effects of early adversity are often pervasive and persistent even after removal from adverse circumstances .
despite concern over the behavioral challenges in this vulnerable population , researchers note the paucity of empirical studies that assess trauma ( dovran et al. 2012 ; hoksbergen and van dijkum 2001 ) .
research suggests that children in foster care in the united states exhibit symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) at more than twice the rate of combat veterans ( pecora et al. 2009 ) .
further , post - institutionalized children exhibit ptsd characteristics in line with survival - seeking behavior ( hoksbergen et al. 2003 ) .
however , the majority of studies with this population do not address trauma symptoms .
for children with out - of - home placements , especially post - institutionalized , internationally adopted children , incomplete and / or unreliable information regarding pre - adoption circumstances ( gunnar et al .
2000 ) can make it difficult to confirm traumatic histories .
in addition , there are questions as to whether the current diagnostic criteria for ptsd is appropriate for children , both because it is not developmentally sensitive and because it does not distinguish between acute trauma ( exposure to a single overwhelming event such as a natural disaster ) and chronic or multiple traumas ( e.g. , deprivation and maltreatment over years of institutional care ) ( cook et al. 2005 ; van der kolk 2005 ) .
the diagnosis of complex trauma , described by van der kolk ( 2005 ) as " multiple , chronic and prolonged , developmentally adverse traumatic events , most often of an interpersonal nature ... and early - life onset " ( p .
402 ) captures the extended exposure to early adversities often suffered by children from institutional or foster care .
as complex trauma becomes a more widely - recognized framework for evaluating vulnerable children , early evidence provides a link between behavioral challenges and trauma ( kisiel et al. 2009a , b , 2014 ) .
for example , milot and colleagues ( milot et al. 2010 ) suggest that the association between behavioral problems and maltreatment might be mediated by trauma symptoms .
however , more empirical support is necessary to link the established behavioral problems seen in at - risk adopted children to trauma .
trust - based relational intervention as trauma - informed care the number of adoptive families potentially impacted by behavioral challenges and trauma symptoms in children with histories of early adversities is substantial .
over 240,000 children have been adopted into the united states from other countries since 1999 ( u.s. department of state ) , the majority of whom were institutionalized before adoption and at risk for multiple traumas , including maltreatment and deprivation ( gunnar et al. 2007 ) .
in addition , 50,000 children are adopted within the united states after child welfare agency involvement every year ( u.s. department of health and human services 2011 ) .
effective , trauma - informed interventions are necessary to support the large number of adoptive families caring for children whose histories of early adversity put them at risk for a range of developmental deficits ( ko et al. 2008 ) .
in their 25 - year review of empirical research of trauma in children with out - of - home placements , dovran and colleagues ( 2012 ) note that only one study could be found that focused on evidence - based treatment and trauma - informed care ( weiner et al. 2009 ) .
successful interventions must address the persistent and extreme behavioral issues often exhibited by at - risk adopted children , but also acknowledge underlying trauma that is often overlooked .
based on a review of the literature , howard bath has proposed three pillars of trauma - informed care that are necessary for helping children heal from complex trauma : felt - safety , self - regulation , and connection ( bath 2008 ) .
these appear to be the fundamental elements of established trauma - informed interventions , including the attachment , self - regulation , and competency model ( arc ; arvidson et al .
2011 ) , attachment and biobehavioral catch - up ( dozier et al. 2008 ) and circle of security ( hoffman et al. 2006 ). from an attachment theory perspective , it is notable that these trauma - informed interventions all recognize the importance of intervention within the context of the caregiving relationship .
indeed , the third pillar of trauma - informed care , connection , is the foundation for the first two pillars .
felt - safety is derived from trusting relationships ( eisenberger et al .
2011 ) , an idea that is central to attachment theory ( see bretherton 1992 ) .
further , self - regulation is also derived from sensitive , trusting relationships , through countless regulatory and attuned caregiver - child interactions ( schore 2001 ) .
researchers agree that for children suffering multiple or chronic early adversities , interventions targeting attachment are necessary ( cook et al. 2005 ; dozier et al. 2002 ; hawk and mccall 2010 ; maclean 2003 ) .
although behavioral change is a goal of intervention , the ultimate objective is to enhance the relationship between the child and caregiver , what dozier and colleagues call the " critical transducer of change " ( dozier et al. 2002 , p. 856 ) .
improving the quality of the child - caregiver relationship improves physical , mental , social , and emotional development in at - risk children ( dozier et al. 2002 ; st. petersburg - usa orphanage research team 2008 ) .
a high quality caregiver - child relationship , such as that found in a secure attachment dyad , can buffer against the harmful effects of early adverse experiences , including poor behavioral outcomes ( audet and le mare 2010 ; colonnesia et al. 2012 ; kriebel and wentzel 2011 ; mcgoron et al. 2012 ) .
tbri is a trauma - informed intervention grounded in attachment theory that seeks to improve outcomes for vulnerable children by ( 1 ) helping caregivers see the needs of children who have experienced relational trauma and ( 2 ) helping caregivers do what is necessary to meet those needs .
for intervention to be most effective the underlying trauma experienced by children with histories of maltreatment and deprivation must be addressed .
in line with the three pillars of trauma - informed care , tbri consists of three sets of principles that facilitate felt - safety , self - regulation , and connection : empowering principles , connecting principles , and correcting principles .
each set of principles has two associated sets of strategies .
the two sets of strategies associated with empowering principles are ( 1 ) ecological strategies , such as recognizing and managing transitions and establishing rituals that structure and connect and ( 2 ) physiological strategies , such as providing regular physical activity and sensory experiences and meeting nutritional and hydration needs .
the basic idea of the empowering principles is that by attending to these principles and strategies , caregivers can enhance a child 's capacity for self - regulation , decrease the likelihood of negative and disruptive incidents , and increase the likelihood of successful " connecting and correcting. " the sets of strategies associated with connecting principles are ( 1 ) mindful awareness , such as an awareness of the child , the self , and the environment and ( 2 ) engagement strategies , such as valuing eye contact , playful interaction , and healthy touch .
the connecting principles are based on attachment theory and research ( see cassidy and shaver 2008 ; siegel 2012 ) and are the " heart and soul " of tbri .
the connecting principles are not only important in their own right , as essential mechanisms for building trusting relationships , but are also the engine that makes both the empowering and the correcting principles work in practice .
the strategies associated with correcting strategies consist of ( 1 ) proactive strategies , such as teaching life value terms and behavioral scripts during playful interactions and ( 2 ) responsive strategies , such as using the ideal response and levels of response to respond to challenging behavior .
the correcting principles are used to deliberately shape behavior , but will only be effective to the extent that their practice is based on a firm foundation of empowering and connecting .
a more detailed explanation of tbri and how the principles are applied can be found in previous publications ( e.g. , purvis et al. 2013a , b ) .
the current study tbri has been used in a number of settings to effect change , including intensive home programs ( mckenzie et al. 2014 ) , residential treatment centers ( purvis et al. 2012 , 2014 ) , and schools ( parris et al .
2014 ) , but the current study is the first to use a randomized sample , pre - post design with a control group to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention .
consistent with research demonstrating the efficacy of trauma - informed , attachment - based interventions on behavioral outcomes for at - risk children ( dozier et al .
2002 ) and with research suggesting that trauma symptoms account for the relationship between early adversity and behavioral problems ( milot et al .
2010 ) , it is expected that behavioral problems and trauma symptoms will decrease for at - risk adopted children whose parents participate in a tbri trauma - informed parent - training program .
method participants participants consisted of 96 adoptive parents who responded to a recruitment notice for a study for parents interested in learning about the basic relationship and developmental needs of adopted children with histories of early adversities and practical strategies to improve outcomes for these children .
recruitment notices were posted on the university website , distributed by email through child welfare professionals across the united states , and emailed to parents on the research institute 's distribution list .
eligible participants included parents of children who were domestically or internationally adopted , were between the ages of 5 and 12 at the beginning of the study , and had resided in the adoptive home for at least 1 year .
in addition , parents or other immediate family members could not have participated in previous training or research studies hosted by the research institute .
parent training was offered free of charge. of the 492 eligible participants who responded to the recruitment notice , 167 indicated that they were available to travel to the university ( located in a large metropolitan area in the southern united states ) to attend 4 days of on - site parent training. of these 167 potential participants , 85 were randomly assigned to attend parent training ( treatment group ) .
the remaining 82 , along with the 325 eligible participants who indicated that they were interested in receiving training but were unavailable to attend on - site training , were randomly assigned to either an online treatment group ( n = 205 , reported elsewhere ) or a control group ( n = 202 ) .
participants in the control group were offered online training after the conclusion of the study .
reported here are results for the 48 participants in the treatment group and 48 participants in a matched sample control group who had complete data through the final round of data collection ( attrition rate = 29 % for treatment group , 14 % for control group ) .
control group participants were matched to treatment group on child sex , age , adoption type ( domestic vs. international ) , and age at adoption ( within 9 months ) .
means and standard deviations for continuous descriptive variables by group ( control vs. treatment ) for the child can be found in table 1 .
further , frequencies and percentage for categorical descriptive variables by group for the child can be found in table 2 .
means and standard deviations for continuous descriptive variables by group for the primary caregiver can be found in table 3 .
further , frequencies and percentage for categorical descriptive variables by group for the primary caregiver can be found in table 4 .
as can be seen in tables 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , the treatment and control groups did not differ significantly on any descriptive variables .

all participants provided informed consent before participating in research .
all participants participated in an online pretest approximately 2 weeks before intervention began , as well as an online posttest approximately 2 weeks after intervention ended .
primary caregivers completed the strengths and difficulties questionnaire ( sdq ; goodman 2001 ) and trauma symptoms checklist for young children ( tscyc ; briere 2001 ) at both pre - and posttest .
psychometric properties of the questionnaires for both pre and post treatment can be found in table 5 .
in addition , participants provided background information , including demographics and the child 's pre - adoption history , at pretest .
the questionnaires making up the pre - and posttest assessments were presented in random order at each administration .

the sdq assesses four domains of behavioral problems : emotional symptoms , conduct problems , hyperactivity / inattention , and peer problems .
added together , scores from these four subscales give a total difficulties score .
the sdq also assesses prosocial behavior .
each item is rated on a 3 - point scale ( 0 = not true to 2 = certainly true ) .
the sdq has good reliability and validity ( goodman 2001 ) .
trauma symptom checklist for young children the tscyc is a 90 - item caregiver - report measure of acute and chronic posttraumatic symptomology in children age 3 to 12 years old .
the tscyc yields eight clinical subscales : anxiety , depression , anger / aggression , post - traumatic stress - intrusion , post - traumatic stress - avoidance , post - traumatic stress - arousal , post - traumatic stress - total , sexual concerns , and dissociation .
the tscyc also contains two validity scales : response level , which indicates a tendency for reporters to over - respond , and atypical response , which indicates a tendency to under - respond .
each item is rated on a 4 - point scale ( from 1 = not at all to 4 = very often ) .
the tscyc clinical scales have good reliability ( average scale alpha of . 87 ; briere et al .
2001 ) and good convergent validity with other parent - report measures ( trauma symptom checklist for children , child behavior checklist , and the ucla ptsd index - parent form ; wherry et al. 2008 ) .
intervention protocol participants in the treatment group attended a 4 - day tbri parent training ( 6 h per day ) designed to teach strategies and skills intended to improve behavioral outcomes for children with histories of complex trauma .
the training consisted of 1 day each of tbri introduction & overview , empowering , connecting , and correcting principles .
the training utilized standardized presentations , presenter manuals , and participant workbooks routinely used in tbri workshops with various audiences interested in creating changes for children with early adverse histories , including audiences of child welfare professionals , teachers , and adoptive and foster parents .
each day of training consisted of interactive lectures with small and large group discussions , application activities such as role - plays and therapeutic groups , and video clips used to demonstrate principles and strategies .
trainers each had approximately 2 years experience using the standardized presentations , manuals , and workbooks .
results the outcomes of the parent training intervention on the sdq and tscyc subscales were examined by repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance ( mancovas ) with time ( pre and post ) as the within subjects factor , group ( treatment and control ) as the between subjects factor , and child 's sex and current age as the covariates .
tables 5 and 6 present the descriptive statistics and the mancova results for the sdq and tscyc subscales respectively .

caregiver reports of the child 's emotional problems , conduct problems , hyperactivity / inattention , and total difficulties were significantly lower at posttest than at pretest for the treatment group , but did not significantly change over time for the control group .
further , caregiver reports of the child 's prosocial behavior were significantly higher following intervention for the treatment group , but did not change over time for the control group .
results also revealed a significant main effect for time on the sdq peer problems subscale .
on average , parents reported more peer - related problems at posttest ( mpre = 3.26 , sd = 2.29 ; mpost = 3.31 , sd = 2.25 ) .
results also revealed significant interaction between time and child 's current age for the emotional problems ( f = 4.51 , p < . 05 , etap2 = . 05 ) , peer problems ( f = 7.65 , p < . 01 , etap2 = . 08 ) , and total difficulties ( f = 6.05 , p < . 05 , etap2 = . 06 ) .
parents reported that older children had a greater decrease in problem behavior than younger children from pretest to posttest regardless of group .
as can be seen in table 7 , results revealed significant interaction effects for time and group for t scores on four of the nine tscyc scales .
caregiver reports of the child 's anxiety , depression , and post - traumatic stress - arousal significantly decreased from pretest to posttest for the treatment group , but did not change significantly for the control group .
further , results showed a significant main effect for time and a significant interaction effect for time and group for the anger / aggression scale .
on average , parents reported lower levels of anger / aggression at posttest ( mpre = 68.06 , sd = 17.60 ; mpost = 65.53 , sd = 17.87 ) .
though both groups changed from pretest to posttest , the treatment group had a significantly larger decrease in anger / aggression scores at posttest ( mpre = 70.94 , sd = 18.44 ; mpost = 66.04 , sd = 18.43 ) than the control group ( mpre = 65.17 , sd = 16.75 ; mpost = 65.02 , sd = 17.30 ) .
no interaction effects were found on the tscyc scales between the child 's sex , current age , time , and group .

in terms of symptoms of trauma , parents in the treatment group reported that their children had significantly lower anxiety , depression , anger / aggression , and post - traumatic stress - arousal on the tscyc after intervention , while trauma symptoms in the control group remained unchanged .
in line with the principles of trauma - informed care , the core values of tbri are felt - safety , self - regulation , and connection .
although previous research suggests that focusing on these core values will result in behavioral change , this is the first tbri study to empirically assess change in trauma symptoms .
not surprisingly given their early adverse histories , children in the current sample are at risk for symptoms in line with a post - traumatic stress diagnosis , including arousal , intrusion , and avoidance. that a 4 - day parent training could effectively decrease trauma symptomology speaks to the importance of considering trauma in the context of the caregiver - child relationship .
indeed , although constructs such as " felt - safety " are difficult to capture in behavioral terms , decreases in arousal and anxiety suggest that children feel safe .
these findings are encouraging for the multitude of families seeking help for the behavioral challenges exhibited by their at - risk adopted children every day and are also important for researchers who seek to identify developmental domains that should be targeted for interventions .
notably , the improvements evident after intervention were not limited to one domain , but appeared in various domains that are addressed by the intervention .
for example , conduct problems are addressed proactively with tbri strategies , such as role - playing to practice " using your words. " hyperactivity is addressed with strategies focused on sensory stimulation .
emotional problems are addressed in activities such as creating a clay model representing something the child is afraid of and then smashing the model .
although one goal of the intervention is behavioral change , it is most effective in the context of the safety , security , and sensitivity of a healthy attachment relationship .
thus , although the intervention utilizes both proactive and responsive strategies for encouraging pro - social behavior and discouraging maladaptive behaviors , scripts such as " use your words " or " gentle and kind " carry no weight if not used appropriately by safe , nurturing adults who try to build connection even when correcting behavior .
consistent with this perspective , it is important that the intervention target caregivers , with the intention that positive outcomes will be more long - lasting if the caregiver is the medium for change .
limitations and future research although promising , there are limitations to the current sample .
participants consisted of volunteers who were interested in learning strategies for improving outcomes for their adopted children .
they had to have the means and time to travel to the training and the ability to be available for 4 days ; therefore , this sample might not represent the population as a whole .
another possible limitation is the use of parent - report measures of child behavior .
it is possible that problem behaviors decreased in the treatment group after intervention because parents wanted behaviors to decrease .
however , the post - intervention improvements in behavior and trauma symptoms are supported by post - intervention improvements found in other studies utilizing different measures for the same intervention principles , including changes in neurochemistry ( cross et al. 2011 ; purvis et al. 20111 ) , attachment behavior ( purvis et al. 2013a , b ) , and social / emotional skills ( purvis et al. 2011 ) .
in addition , other studies have found high validity between parent reports of behavior and other behavioral measures , including teacher report ( kriebel and wentzel 2011 ; miller et al. 2009 ) and self - report ( gagnon - oosterwaal et al. 2012 ) .
as is common in studies of adopted children with early adverse histories , especially post - institutionalized children , there was no direct measure of pre - adoption experiences .
the current study reports on short - term improvements in behavior and trauma symptoms .
although encouraging , future research should assess long - term follow - up of outcomes following intervention to examine whether behavioral improvements last .
if decreases in child behavioral problems and trauma symptoms are the result of changes to parent - child interactions stemming from tbri parent training , then a central question for future research is to what extent parents continue to use the skills and strategies learned in training .
on - site tbri training conducted face - to - face with tbri - trained staff is a valuable training model : it allows for a dialogue between participants and trainers during which questions can be answered immediately , skills can be practiced with feedback , participants have a devoted time and space in which to learn and have the context of a supportive environment from trainers and other participants .
however , on - site training also has its caveats : it limits the number of individuals who can attend training and it requires a lot of time and resources on the part of the training staff .
indeed , among the participants who were randomly assigned to the treatment group ( who had all indicated that they were available to attend training on location during the training dates ) , the main reason participants withdrew from the study prior to intervention was difficulty making travel arrangements ( e.g. , unable to find child care , take time off of work , or afford travel expenses ) .
the majority of participants who withdrew from the study expressed regret or frustration at not attending training .
future research will evaluate alternatives to on - site trainings led by research institute staff .
a promising alternative is web - based training , which aims to provide the same content but allows participants to progress through training at their own speed on their own timeframe , no travel required .
future research will report on the efficacy of a pilot study of tbri online .
children who have experienced chronic or multiple early adversities can bear the scars of their trauma long after removal from harsh environments .
the effects can manifest in a number of ways , including behavioral problems and trauma symptoms .
however , results of this study suggest that trauma - informed tbri training can improve child outcomes and give families hope .

to differentiate gastric motility and sensation between type ii diabetic patients and controls and explore different expressions of gastric motility peptides. methods .
eleven type ii diabetic patients and health volunteers of similar age and body mass index were invited .
all underwent transabdominal ultrasound for gastric motility and visual analogue scales .
blood samples were taken for glucose and plasma peptides ( ghrelin , motilin , and glucacon - like peptides - 1 ) by elisa method. results .
gastric emptying was significantly slower in diabetic patients than controls ( t50 : 46.3 ( 28.0 - 52.3 ) min versus 20.8 ( 9.6 - 22.8 ) min , p <= 0.05 ) and less antral contractions in type ii diabetic patients were observed ( p = 0.02 ) .
fundus dimensions did not differ .
there were a trend for less changes in gastrointestinal sensations in type ii diabetic patients especially abdomen fullness , hunger , and abdominal discomfort .
although the serum peptides between the two groups were similar a trend for less serum glp - 1in type ii diabetic patients was observed ( p = 0.098 ). conclusion .
type ii diabetic patients have delayed gastric emptying and less antral contractions than controls .
the observation that there were lower serum glp - 1 in type ii diabetic patients could offer a clue to suggest that delayed gastric emptying in diabetic patients is not mainly influenced by glp - 1 .
1. introduction gastrointestinal tract disorders are common in diabetic patients [ 1 , 2 ] .
more than 75 % of patients visiting diabetes mellitus clinics reported significant gastrointestinal symptoms [ 1 ] such as dysphasia , early satiety , reflux , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , constipation , and diarrhea .
the symptoms may be severe enough to substantially affect quality of life , induce poor sugar control , and progress with duration of diabetes mellitus .
the pathogenesis of the gastrointestinal abnormalities is multifactorial complex in nature which may involve autonomic neuropathy , motor dysfunction , glycemic control , psychological factors , and so forth and is not well understood [ 3 ] .
in diabetic patients with gastrointestinal symptoms , 68 % were found to have delayed gastric emptying [ 4 ] that influences the quality of life and sugar control in these patients .
owing to the fact that the pathogenesis is still poorly understood , it is rational that the effective medical treatment for these patients with diabetic dyspepsia is yet unavailable .
gastric motility is regulated by gastrointestinal motility hormones such as cholecystokinin , gastric inhibitor peptide , motilin , and ghrelin .
previous publications reported that motilin [ 5 , 6 ] and ghrelin [ 7 , 8 ] stimulated gastric motility and glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( glp - 1 ) inhibited gastric motility [ 9 , 10 ] .
we hypothesized that diabetic patients had lower motilin and ghrelin or higher glp - 1 and hence inhibited gastric motility and induced gastrointestinal symptoms .
therefore , we conducted this study to compare gastric motility and sensation between type ii diabetic patients and normal controls and explore the roles of different gastric motility peptides in this motility effect .
2. methods eleven patients ( 2 female ) with long - standing (> 5 years ) type ii diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and 11 healthy controls ( 2 female ) of similar age ( 58 +/ - 2 years ; 51 +/ - 5 years ) andbody mass index ( 25.0 +/ - 2.2 kg / m2 ; 23.7 +/ - 2.5 ) were invited to participatein current study from august 2009 to july 2010 .
the basic demographic data were listed in table 1 .
all patients gave written , informed consent , and the protocol was approved by both the institutional review board and the research ethics committee of kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital , taiwan ( irb 96 - 1583b ) .
patients were excluded if they had a historyof ketosis or dysautonomic or gastrointestinal symptoms determined by interview or from the review of medical records .
all patients with type ii diabetes mellitus in current study were prescribed with oral hypoglycemic agents instead of insulin therapy .
subjects were also excluded if they had previous gastrointestinal disease or abdominal surgery with the exception of uncomplicated appendectomy , herniorrhaphy , or gynecologicsurgery .
all patients must discontinue medications including anticholinergics , calcium channel blockers , 3 - adrenergicantagonists , or hormones 48 hours before the study except oral hypoglycemic agents .
they underwent physical examination , laboratory blood tests ( including white - cell and red - cell counts , measurement of blood sugar during fasting , and liver - function tests ) , abdominal ultrasonography , and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to rule out any structural cause for the symptoms .
each subject was studied on afternoons .
following a fast of 8 h for solids and liquids , the patients consumed 500 ml of chicken and corn soup ( united kanboo , taipei , taiwan ) , containing 118.6 kcal ( 2.6 g protein , 2.6 g fat , 21.2 g carbohydrate ) .
the soup was boiled and subsequently cooled to 37degreesc and was consumed over 5 min ( t = - 5 - 0 min ) .
all patients underwent transabdominal ultrasound to record antral area , fundic area , and diameterandantral contractions in regular time by using an aloka ssd - 2000 cl ultrasound machine ( aloka , tokyo , japan ) with a 3.5 - mhz annular array probe .
the frequency of antral contractions was defined as the number of contractions during a 25 - minute interval , recorded per five minutes , and the antral contractions were defined as one time while the maximal contraction - induced reduction of the antral area ( difference between relaxed and contracted area ) as a fraction of the relaxed area ( deltaa / a ) > 50 % as our previous study [ 11 ] .
all subjects were invited to denote their symptoms 10 min before test meal ingestion and 10 min after test meal ingestion .
a questionnaire with visual analogue scales ( vas ) for the symptoms of pain , nausea , abdominal discomfort , bloating , and abdominal fullness was administered every ten minutes till 90 min .
grading was made on a 100 mm unmarked line between " no symptom " at one end and " excruciating symptoms " at the other .
blood samples were taken at t = - 10 , 30 , 60 , and 90 minutes for measurement of blood glucose and plasma peptide levels .
blood glucose concentrations were immediately determined using a portable blood glucose meter ( medisense companion 2 meter ; medisense inc. , waltham , ma , usa ) .
the accuracy of this method has been confirmed using the hexokinase technique .
venous blood samples were collected into ice - chilled edta - treated tubes containing 400 kiu aprotinin / ml blood .
plasma was separated and samples stored at - 70degreesc for subsequent analysis of glp - 1 , ghrelin and motilin concentrations .
plasma ghrelin , motilin , and glp - 1 concentrations were measured by elisa ( ghrelin was measured by a commercial elisa kit ( phoenix pharmaceuticals inc. , burlingame , ca ) ; intra - and interassay coefficients of variation ( cv ) were less than 5 % and less than 9 % , respectively ; motilin and glp - 1 were also measured by a commercial elisa kit .
3. statistical analysis the curves for antral area , fundic area , diameter , antral contractions , and gastrointestinal sensation scores were compared by using repeated measures anova .
linear regression analysis was used to examine relationships between gastrointestinal sensations and gastric motility ( antral area , fundic area , diameter , and frequency of antral contraction ) .
results were shown as means +/ - standard deviation .
p values < 0.05 were considered significant .
mean values and standard deviations ( sd ) of each variable were calculated if not specifically noted otherwise .
statistical analysis was performed with student 's t - test for paired comparison .
the tests are two - tailed , and p < 0.05 is considered significant .
4. results all subjects tolerated the study well .
4.1 .
antral area and gastric emptying antral area was larger in type ii diabetic patients than normal controls especially after test meal ( antal area 15.6 +/ - 2.3 cm2 versus 12.6 +/ - 2.4 cm2 ) .
gastric emptying was more significant in normal controls than diabetic patients ( t50 : 20.8 ( 9.6 - 22.8 ) min versus 46.3 ( 28.0 - 52.3 ) min , p = 0.03 ) .
there was a statistical significance trend for smaller antral area in the normal controls between the two groups , p = 0.014 ( figure 1 ( a )) .
4.2 .
antral contractions there was a significant trend for less antral contractions in type ii diabetic patients during 90 minutes after the test meal ( p = 0.02 ) ( figure 1 ( b )) .
4.3 .
fundic area and diameter fundus dimensions did not differ between normal controls and type ii diabetic patients ( fundic area : p = 0.454 ; fundic diameter : p = 0.331 ) ( figures 1 ( c ) and 1 ( d )) .
4.4 .
gastrointestinal sensations soup ingestion was associated with increased abdominal fullness and bloating and decreased hunger and appetite scores only in control group but not in type ii diabetic patients .
figure 2 demonstrated a trend for less significant changes in gastrointestinal sensations in type ii diabetic patients especially abdomen fullness , hunger , and appetite in current study .
4.5 .
gastric motility peptides there were no differences in serum peptide ( motilin , ghrelin , and glp - 1 ) between the two groups but a trend for less serum glp - 1 in patients with type ii diabetes mellitus was observed ( p = 0.098 ) ( figure 3 ) .
5. discussion faraj and colleagues reported as high as 68 % of the diabetic patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with delayed gastric emptying [ 4 ] .
in current study , we observed that type ii diabetic patients were found to have larger gastric antral area on sonography .
type ii diabetic patients had delayed gastric emptying and less gastric contraction and experienced less postprandial sensation than normal volunteers probably owing to gastric atony and gastric paralysis ( gastroparesis ) in diabetic patients .
as we had shown that less gastric contraction in diabetic patients were correlated with less gastric emptying , there were reports indicating that diabetic patients had postprandial antral hypomotility , decreased temporal organization of antral pressure waves , and increased small intestinal motor activity .
all these gastric disorders occurred in long - term diabetic patients and were associated with peripheral neuropathy .
prolonged poor sugar control induced sympathetic nerve dysfunction .
samsom and colleagues observed a lower fasting fundal tone and a decrease in volume change of the gastric fundus after a nutrient drink in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to type i diabetes mellitus but the fundus dimensions between type ii diabetic patients with normal controls were not different in current study .
they used barostat to measure fundic volume and tone but we used ultrasound to detect fundic dimensions .
kumar and colleagues then emphasized more significant impairment in gastric fundic volume and the accommodation response to a test meal in diabetic patients [ 12 ] but we still did not observe the difference in our study .
the plausible explanation could be the low nutrient test meal we used in current study .
low volume test meal would not remain in the fundus long enough to be detected by abdominal ultrasound .
perhaps such drawback could be overcome if higher nutrient test meals were used .
other than this , computer tomography might be a better imaging study to overcome the difference .
type ii diabetic patients experienced less gastrointestinal sensation after a test meal than normal controls in spite of significant delaying gastric emptying and decreasing gastric contraction .
loo and colleagues found out that approximately 50 % of these patients with gastric motor disorders might be asymptomatic [ 13 ] .
it is still unclear about the actual roles of different motility expression in diabetic patients .
motilin had been reported to regulate the interdigestive migrating contractions ( imc ) , the fasted motor pattern in the gastrointestinal tract [ 14 ] , and ghrelin stimulated gi motility .
ghrelin induced premature phase iii contractions of imc in the human stomach [ 7 ] and intravenous ghrelin injection could accelerate gastric emptying and improve meal - related symptoms .
all these reports suggested that ghrelin could be a potential prokinetic agent .
more studies are mandatory to clarify the physiological role of plasma ghrelin and motilin in these digestive physiological events and stimulation of gastric emptying .
however , we observed no different motilin and ghrelin between diabetic patients and normal controls , only a trend of less serum glp - 1 expression in type ii diabetic patients in current study .
this could not well explain the pathology of delayed gastric emptying in our diabetic patients .
this was consistent with the findings of pala and colleagues who reported that glp - 1 levels were significantly lower in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to those with normal glucose tolerance [ 15 ] .
shirra and delgado - aros and colleagues observed that glp - 1 significantly inhibited gastric emptying and vagal function [ 16 , 17 ] .
rosenstock and colleagues even used glp - 1 agonists to treat diabetic patients [ 18 , 19 ] .
there was limitation in our study , small patient number that could cause why there was no difference in motility peptides in current study .
in conclusion , type ii diabetic patients have delayed gastric emptying and less antral contractions than normal controls and may be associated to less postprandial sensation .
the observation that less serum glp - 1 in type ii diabetic patients could offer a clue to understand that delayed gastric emptying in diabetic patients is not mainly regulated by glp - 1 .

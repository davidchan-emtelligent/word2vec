objective to evaluate possible associations between cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and peripheral artery disease ( pad ) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
research design and methods in this cross - sectional study , 67 patients with type 2 diabetes were included .
pad was identified by doppler ultrasonography : systolic ankle - brachial pressure index < 0.9 .
cardiovascular autonomic function , besides five conventional cardiovascular autonomic function tests , was assessed by heart rate variability ( hrv ; 24 - h ambulatory ecg recording ) in time and frequency domains ( spectral analyses ) and three dimensional return maps .
power spectral analyses ( psa ) were quantified in low frequency ( lf ) , high frequency ( hf ) , and very low frequency .
results patients with pad ( n = 30 ) had longer diabetes duration , higher systolic blood pressure ( bp ) , waist - to - hip ratio , hba1c test , and urinary albumin excretion ( uae ) than patients without pad .
most hrv indices in time domain were lower in patients with than without pad .
these patients also had lower psa indices ( lf = 0.19 +/ - 0.07 vs. 0.29 +/ - 0.11 n.u. ; lf / hf ratio = 1.98 +/ - 0.9 vs. 3.35 +/ - 1.83 ; p < 0.001 ) and indices of sympathetic ( three - dimensional return map : p1 - night 61.7 +/ - 9.4 vs. 66.8 +/ - 9.7 ; p = 0.04 ) and vagal ( 24 - h p2 54.5 +/ - 15.2 vs. 62.7 +/ - 2.9 ; p < 0.02 ) activities ( arbitrary units ) than patients without pad .
multivariate logistic regression analyses , adjusted for systolic bp , dm duration , hba1c test , and uae , confirmed the associations between impaired autonomic modulation and pad , except for p1 index .
conclusion in conclusion , patients with type 2 diabetes with pad had lower hrv indices than patients without pad , reflecting a dysfunction of cardiovascular autonomic modulation .
diabetes diabetic neuropathy autonomic neuropathy introduction patients with diabetes mellitus have a generalized atherosclerosis of the arterial bed , characterized by an early onset and a fast progression rate .
diabetes increases the risk for peripheral arterial disease ( pad ) 2 - to 3 - fold [ 1 ] .
moreover , pad , together with microvascular disease and peripheral neuropathy , is responsible for the high incidence of non traumatic amputations in patients with diabetes [ 1 ] .
intermittent claudication , the main clinical manifestation of pad , has been associated with increased mortality [ 2 ] .
the lower - extremity arterial calcification that occurs in pad has been considered as a correlate of coronary artery calcification , at least in type 1 diabetes [ 3 ] .
in patients with diabetes and pad , besides the presence of coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis [ 4 ] , cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy ( can ) can partially explain the high rate of cardiovascular mortality observed [ 5 ] .
disturbances in the autonomic system modulation seem to precede the increase in the thickness of the carotid intima , a predictor of atherosclerosis progression in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 6,7 ] .
can has been traditionally diagnosed by cardiovascular autonomic function tests [ 8 ] .
can can also be evaluated by heart rate variability ( hrv ) analyses [ 6 ] , through the quantification of very small heart rate changes from one cardiac cycle to the next .
this technology enables quantification of the relative influence of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems on the sinus node and , compared to conventional cardiovascular autonomic tests , has a higher sensitivity to detect autonomic abnormalities [ 9 ] .
hrv detects both instantaneous heart rate and r - r intervals of the electrocardiogram .
it is usually analyzed in time domain and frequency domain .
the latter is also known as power spectral analysis ( psa ) .
time domain indices evaluate the dispersion of the cardiac r - r intervals around the mean , and reflect overall autonomic modulation on the sinus node .
psa evaluates the variance of r - r intervals as a function of frequency and is calculated by mathematical algorithms .
the psa results exhibits three main components : very low frequency ( vlf ; with no clearly defined participation in hrv ) , low frequency ( lf ; mainly sympathetic modulation ) , and high frequency ( hf , parasympathetic modulation ) .
psa of hrv has been considered to be a useful tool in assessing the autonomic nervous system function in patients with diabetes [ 10 ] .
a comprehensive evaluation of the autonomic nervous system function in diabetic patients with pad has not been performed to date .
this knowledge may contribute to earlier diagnosis and intervention in patients at higher cardiovascular risk in order to decrease the rate of lower extremity amputations and mortality .
therefore , the aim of the current study was to evaluate possible associations of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction with pad in patients with type 2 diabetes .
research design and methods subjects this was a cross - sectional study nested in a prospective cohort .
patients with type 2 diabetes were selected from a cohort of consecutive outpatients attending the endocrine division at hospital de clinicas de porto alegre .
details of the original cohort have been previously published [ 11 ]. from the original cohort of 98 patients with type 2 diabetes , 84 patients were available for evaluation .
missing patients ( n = 14 ) did not differ from the included patients regarding age , diabetes duration , proportion of females , and ethnicity ( data not shown ) .
the definition of type 2 diabetes was based on age of onset (> 30 years old ) , no episodes of ketoacidosis and no need for insulin use during the first five years of diagnosis .
patients underwent a clinical and laboratory evaluation and the ethics committee approved the protocol .
all patients gave written informed consent .
general clinical evaluation all patients answered a standard questionnaire that included questions about age , diabetes duration , smoking habit ( defined as positive if the patient had smoked at least one cigarette a day for more than one year ) , and medications in use .
patients self - identified themselves as white or non - white ( mixed or black ) .
patients were weighed in light clothes , without shoes , and height was recorded .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight ( kilograms ) divided by squared height ( meters ) .
waist and hip circumferences were measured with a soft tape in the upright position , on bare skin at the level the umbilicus and iliac crest , during mid - respiration , to the nearest 0.5 cm. waist - to - hip ratio was calculated .
blood pressure ( bp ) was measured twice , in the sitting position , after a 10 - min rest to the nearest 2 mmhg , using an aneroid sphygmomanometer .
hypertension was defined as bp levels >= 140 / 90 mmhg or the use of antihypertensive medication .
indirect ophthalmoscopy was performed by an ophthalmologist through dilated pupils and diabetic retinopathy was classified as present ( any degree ) or absent .
the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease was based on the presence of at least one of the following : angina or possible infarct according to the who questionnaire for cardiovascular disease [ 12 ] ; resting ecg abnormalities [ minnesota codes : q and qs patterns ( 1 - 1 to 1 - 3 ) ; s - t junction ( j ) and segment depression ( 4 - 1 to 4 - 4 ) ; t - wave items ( 5 - 1 to 5 - 3 ) , and complete left bundle branch block ( 7 - 1 )] [ 12 ] , and / or perfusion abnormalities on myocardial scintigraphy at rest ( fixed ) or after infusion of dipyridamole .
based on their 24 - h urinary albumin excretion ( uae ) , patients were classified as normoalbuminuric (< 20 mug / min ) , microalbuminuric ( 20 - 199 mug / min ) or macroalbuminuric (> 199 mug / min ) [ 13 ] .
diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed in the presence of micro - or macroalbuminuria and was always confirmed in a second urine sample collected over a 3 - to 6 - month period [ 13,14 ] .
none of the patients with diabetic nephropathy had a doubtful etiology of their kidney disease ( e.g. absence of retinopathy , rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate , resistant hypertension , or heavy proteinuria ) [ 15 ] .
patients on angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists had their urine samples collected after a minimum three - weeks interruption of these medications .
the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy was established if the michigan score was greater than 2 .
this score is based on foot examination ( deformities , callus , infection , ulceration ) , ankle reflex response , tactile sensitivity ( normal , reduced or absent ) and vibration perception threshold ( normal , reduced or absent , 128 mhz tuning fork ) at the dorsum of great toe [ 16 ] .
the same trained examiner tested all participants .
peripheral artery disease assessment pad was accessed by systolic ankle - brachial bp ratio .
the systolic bp was obtained on the ankle ( posterior tibial and / or pedious arteries ) and arms ( brachial artery ) of both sides , using doppler ultrasonography [ 17 ] .
the systolic bp ratio was calculated by dividing the ankle bp by the ipsilateral arm bp. pad was defined by a ratio < 0.9 on any side .
patients were divided into two groups according to systolic bp ratio values : with and without pad .
autonomic nervous system evaluation cardiovascular autonomic function test the autonomic nervous system was assessed by cardiovascular autonomic function tests as validated by ewing and co - workers [ 8 ] , and autonomic neuropathy was diagnosed when at least 2 out of 5 tests were abnormal [ 8,18 ] .
potentially interfering drugs were weaned off before the tests .
no subject was on antiarrhythmic agents .
briefly , heart rate tests were performed with patients electrocardiographically monitored and heart rate was evaluated after 15 min of resting , before and after deep breath , during the valsalva maneuver , and after standing .
the bp tests evaluated the bp response one minute after standing up from lying down , and after sustained handgrip at 30 % of the maximum voluntary contraction capacity , using a handgrip dynamometer .
heart rate variability : time and frequency domain indices hrv was also evaluated using ecg recording by the time domain and frequency domain methods ( psa ) , as well as the three dimensional return maps , during the day and the night periods [ 10 ] .
the patients received verbal and written instructions to abstain from alcoholic and caffeinated beverages or caffeinated medications , and systemic decongestants , as well as to avoid vigorous exercises and not to wear elastic stockings from the day before the test .
they were also advised to maintain their usual daily activities and to answer a questionnaire regarding the number of cigarettes smoked and any exceptional activity ( extra physical activity or arguing ) on the day of examination .
for hrv analyses , ecg tapes were analyzed on a mars 8000 ( marquete ) scanner with a semiautomatic technique [ 10 ] .
this software distinguishes normal beats from ectopic and artifacts and builds a time series of normal r - r intervals .
non sinus beats were eliminated and , for psa , missing data were interpolated .
psa was computed for periods of 256 s using fast fourier transformation .
only segments free of interpolations were analyzed .
the following time domain hrv indices were calculated from 24 - h ecg recordings : mean of all r - r intervals , sd of the r - r intervals ( sdnn ) , mean of the sd of r - r intervals calculated in 5 - min segments ( sdnni ) , sd of averages of r - r intervals calculated in 5 - min segments ( sdanni ) , root mean square of successive differences of adjacent r - r intervals ( rmssd ) , and percentage of differences between adjacent r - r intervals > 50 ms ( pnn50 ) .
the frequency - domain analyses were performed at complete rest , with patients lying in the supine position , in order to avoid loss of stationarity .
during a 5 - minute period , the following spectral components were assessed : total power ( 0.003 - 1 hz ) , vlf (< 0.04 hz ) , lf ( 0.04 - 0.15 hz ) , hf ( 0.15 - 0.5 hz ) and lf / hf ratio .
lf component reflects both sympathetic and vagal tones , but mostly the sympathetic modulation , and hf component is closely related to respiratory frequency , reflecting vagal ( parasympathetic ) sinus node modulation .
the total power and lf / hf ratio , which is a measure of sympathovagal balance , were calculated for each patient .
the results of lf and hf were reported in absolute and normalized units ( n.u. ) .
heart rate variability : three - dimensional return map the three - dimensional return map , a method based on nonlinear dynamics , reflects sympathetic and vagal modulation as we demonstrated by autonomic blockade studies with propranolol and atropine , in a reproducible way [ 10 ] .
the map is constructed by plotting normal r - r intervals versus the difference between adjacent r - r intervals versus counts .
briefly , normal r - r intervals are plotted on the x - axis against the difference between adjacent r - r intervals on the y - axis .
whenever superimposition of points occurs , the number of superimposed points is expressed on the z - axis , normalized by the maximum density .
a set of indices ( p1 , p2 , p3 , mn ) is calculated to quantify the resulting three - dimensional images .
p1 represents sympathetic modulation and is increased during sympathetic blockade with propranolol but is not affected by the administration of atropine .
p1 is calculated as 100 minus the double of the mean slope between 10 and 90 % of maximum density , in the plane that intersects the distribution in its maximum concentration of points , perpendicular to normal r - r intervals .
p1 is inversely proportional to the mean slope of the distribution calculated at the maximum concentration of points .
as concentration of points increase , the slope will be higher and p1 will be smaller .
therefore , the higher the sympathetic activity , the lower the value attributed to p1 .
p2 and p3 represent vagal modulation , are reduced during vagal blockade with atropine but are not affected by the administration of propranolol .
to calculate p2 and p3 , three - dimensional images are displayed as 10 equally spaced contour curves : p2 is calculated as the maximal longitudinal length , and p3 , as the maximal transversal length of the outermost contour curve .
the general index mn was calculated as the product of p1xp2xp3x10 - 3 .
mn represents either branches of the autonomic nervous system being affected by propranolol and atropine [ 10 ] .
the 24 - h ambulatory ecg recording and cardiovascular autonomic function tests were performed in the same day by the same investigator .
nighttime was recorded as the period between the time when the patient went to bed and the time when the patient woke up in the next morning .
laboratory evaluation urinary albumin excretion rate ( uaer ) was measured by immunoturbidimetry ( microalb ; ames - bayer , tarrytown , ny , usa ; intra - and interassay coefficients of variations 4.5 % and 11.0 % , respectively ) .
glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c test ) was measured by a high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ; merck - hitachi l - 9100 glycated hemoglobin analyzer , reference range 4.7 - 6.0 % ; merck diagnostica , darmstadt , germany ) , fasting plasma glucose was measured by glucose - peroxidase colorimetric enzymatic method ( biodiagnostica , sao paulo , brazil ) .
creatinine was measured by the jaffe method and the lipid profile by a colorimetric method .
glomerular filtration rate was measured in 67 patients using the single - injection 51credta technique ( coefficient of variation = 12 %) [ 19 ] .
statistical analyses variables are described as means +/ - standard deviation ( variables with normal distribution ) , as median ( range ) ( variables without normal distribution ) and as the number of patients with the analyzed characteristic ( percentage ) .
student 's t - test was used for continuous , normally distributed variables ; mann - whitney 's u test was employed for non - normally distributed , continuous variables , and the chi - square test was used for categorical variables .
there are no clearly established cutoff points to identify normal / abnomal values for some hrv indices .
therefore , we decided to categorize hrv indices according to their tertiles , based on studied sample values .
this approach allows the identification of differences between groups since the lowest tertile for hrv indices should include the most abnormal values associated with can .
to evaluate if the hrv indices ( independent variables ) were associated with pad ( dependent variable ) , multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed , adjusted for potential confounders .
in these models , heart rate variability indices were categorized by tertiles and the upper ( 3rd ) for each index was considered as the reference ( or = 1 ) .
hrv indices were log - transformed before analyses .
p values < 0.05 ( two - tailed ) were considered statistically significant .
statistical analyses were performed using spss 18.0 ( spss , chicago , il ) .
results evaluation of can by hrv analyses was available in 67 out of 84 studied patients .
the reasons for the exclusion from the protocol were as follows : incomplete tests ( n = 10 ) , presence of more than 10 % of cardiac ectopic beatings on 24 h - ecg records , or cardiac arrhythmias that preclude the hrv analyses ( n = 7 ) .
frequency of pad in the included patients was not different from all studied patients ( 35.8 % vs. 35.7 % ; p = 0.881 ) .
clinical and laboratory characteristics of the 67 patients with and without pad are depicted in table 1 .
patients with pad had longer diabetes duration , higher waist - hip - ratio , and history of hypertension than those without pad .
diabetic chronic complications , including autonomic neuropathy as evaluated by conventional cardiovascular autonomic function tests , were more frequent in patients with pad as compared with patients without pad .
regarding laboratory variables , the pad group had a worse glycemic control and higher uae than the group without pad .
there was no difference in diabetes treatment between patients with and without pad .

heart rate variability : three - dimensional return map the three dimensional return map data ( table 3 ) shows sympathetic ( p1 ) , vagal ( p2 and p3 ) and global modulation ( mn ) during the 24 - h , day , and night periods .
p1 was lower during the night and p2 was lower at all periods in patients with pad in comparison with those without pad .
when p1 and p2 were stratified into tertiles , patients in the lowest tertiles had the highest frequency of pad ( figure 1c ) .
multivariate analyses logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of pad ( dependent variable ) with tertiles of hrv indices , taken into account possible confounders , namely , diabetes duration , glycemic control , triglycerides , and uae ( table 4 ) .
the 1st tertile of sdnn at day and sdnni at night increased the chance of pad being present 6.08 ( ci 95 % 1.24 - 29.9 ; p = 0.026 ) and 7.67 times ( ci 95 % 1.6 - 37.3 ; p = 0.012 ) , respectively .
having a high frequency index or a low frequency index in the lowest tertiles respectively raised the chance of pad 7.37 times ( ci 95 % 1.5 - 37.3 ; p = 0.016 ) and 6.17 times ( ci 95 % 1.1 - 35.1 ; p = 0.04 ) .
the 1st tertile of hf / lf ratio was also associated with an increased chance for the presence of pad ( or 7.42 , ci 95 % 1.5 - 37.1 ; p = 0.015 ) .
regarding the three dimensional return maps analyses , only a daily vagal modulation index ( p2 ) in the lowest tertile increased the chance for pad 8.42 times ( ci 95 % 1.5 - 47.5 ; p = 0.016 ) .
to take into account a possible effect of fasting plama glucose ( fpg ) at the start of the test , the same multivariate logistic regression analyses models were performed including fpg instead of hba1c .
no significant differences were observed in the main results ( data not shown ) .

sdnn = sd of the r - r intervals ; sdnni = mean of the sd of r - r intervals calculated in 5 - min segment ; p1 = index reflecting sympathetic modulation ; p2 = index reflecting vagal modulation ; upper index tertile ( 3rd ) for each index was considered as the reference ( or = 1 ) .
discussion in this sample of patients with type 2 diabetes , pad was associated with autonomic neuropathy , as evaluated both by conventional cardiovascular autonomic function tests and hrv indices .
this association remained even after adjustments for glycemic control , triglycerides , hypertension , diabetes duration , and uae .
moreover , the hrv analyses allowed the evaluation of sympathetic / parasympathetic balance in these patients .
the association of autonomic nervous system with pad was confirmed in the multivariate analyses for some of the time domain indices and frequency domain indices including the hf / lf ratio .
this means that there was an abnormal modulation of both vagal and sympathetic systems .
although the role of time and frequency domain indices in the evaluation of the autonomic nervous system has been widely debated , autonomic blockade studies confirm that these indices represent mostly vagal modulation of the sinus node [ 20 ] .
furthermore , in the multivariate analyses only the daily p2 index , which represents the parasympathetic component of hrv , was associated with pad .
in summary , we demonstrated an association of pad and abnormal autonomic nervous system and our data suggest that the most affected branch was the parasympathetic .
in the current study , day and night periods were analyzed separately .
in normal subjects there is a circadian pattern of heart rate autonomic modulation with a reduced hrv during the day , secondary to increased sympathetic activity , and an increased hrv during the night due to the predominance of vagal modulation .
in fact we demonstrated reduced hrv time and frequency domain indices at day and night and an abnormal p2 during the day only .
the association between pad and autonomic neuropathy could be explained by the insulin resistance observed in patients with type 2 diabetes .
in the edinburgh artery study , a higher prevalence of pad was observed in patients with diabetes in comparison with those without it , probably due to the higher systolic bp and triglycerides observed in these patients , both variables associated with insulin resistance [ 21 ] .
similarly , insulin resistance has been associated with low hrv [ 22 ] , reinforcing the idea that hyperinsulinemia could be associated with an increased sympathetic tonus [ 23 ] .
in the present study , a higher prevalence of hypertension and a larger waist - to - hip ratio were observed in patients with pad , parameters that have been associated with insulin resistance .
however , in the current study the association of hrv abnormalities with pad was independent of blood pressure , as demonstrated in the multivariate analyses .
this result suggests a direct association of autonomic dysfunction with pad .
a relationship of atherosclerosis with autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction has already been observed [ 24 ] .
however , as far as we known , no study demonstrated the association of pad with can .
the eurodiab data showed an association of low hdl cholesterol and high triglycerides in patients with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy , suggesting a role for an adverse lipid profile in the pathogenesis of can [ 25 ] .
autonomic neuropathy was already related to lower - extremity arterial calcification in type 1 diabetes [ 3 ] .
in patients with type 2 diabetes the lf index , a hrv parameter that reflects mainly sympathetic modulation , predicted progression of carotid atherosclerosis [ 7 ] and coronary artery disease [ 6,24,26 ] .
none of these studies evaluated the association of hrv abnormalities with pad .
possible limitations of the present study are related to the accuracy of hrv indices to evaluate sympathetic modulation .
maybe the use of controlled sympathetic stimulation - as head up tilt or mental stress - could add more information about the cardiac sympathetic modulation in these patients .
another factor that could have reduced the detection of hrv abnormalities in the current study was the exclusion of patients with arrhythmias since this group possibly had even lower hrv .
however , despite these methodological limitations , the consistent demonstration of differences in various hrv indices between patients with and without pad suggests that the results of the present study are true .
conclusion in this sample of patients with type 2 diabetes , those with pad had lower hrv indices than patients without pad , reflecting a dysfunction of cardiovascular autonomic modulation .
this impaired cardiac autonomic modulation might represent an additional cardiovascular risk factor for patients with type 2 diabetes and pad .
however , the role of these abnormalities as predictors of mortality in diabetic patients with pad should be evaluated in prospective studies .

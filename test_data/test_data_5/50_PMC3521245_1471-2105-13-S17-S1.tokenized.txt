ten years ago when asia - pacific bioinformatics network held the first international conference on bioinformatics ( incob ) in bangkok its theme was north - south networking .
at that time incob aimed to provide biologists and bioinformatics researchers in the asia - pacific region a forum to meet , interact with , and disseminate knowledge about the burgeoning field of bioinformatics .
meanwhile incob has evolved into a major regional bioinformatics conference that attracts not only talented and established scientists from the region but increasingly also from east asia , north america and europe .
since 2006 incob yielded 114 articles in bmc bioinformatics supplement issues that have been cited nearly 1,000 times to date .
in part , these developments reflect the success of bioinformatics education and continuous efforts to integrate and utilize bioinformatics in biotechnology and biosciences in the asia - pacific region .
a cross - section of research leading from biological data to knowledge and to technological applications , the incob2012 theme , is introduced in this editorial .
other highlights included sessions organized by the pan - asian pacific genome initiative and a machine learning in immunology competition .
incob2013 is scheduled for september 18 - 21 , 2013 at suzhou , china .
3 - 5 october 2012asia pacific bioinformatics network ( apbionet ) eleventh international conference on bioinformatics ( incob2012 ) bangkok , thailand background asia - pacific bioinformatics network ( apbionet ) [ 1 ] was founded in 1998 during the pacific symposium on biocomputing in hawaii .
its mission is to promote and advance bioinformatics as a scholarly scientific discipline in the asia - pacific region .
since then , apbionet has been engaged in the development of bioinformatics network infrastructure , primarily through training and organization of conferences .
these activities won apbionet the endorsement of asia - pacific advanced network ( apan ) [ 2 ] , the acknowledgment of subcommittee of biotechnology of association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) committee on science and technology ( cost ) [ 3 ] and the regional affiliation with international society for computational biology ( iscb ) [ 4 ] .
since 2002 , the international conference of bioinformatics ( incob ) series of conferences has evolved into a major forum for fostering apbionet 's mission and for advancing the theory and practice of bioinformatics .
the incob community comprises practitioners , scientists and students spanning biology , computation , and biotechnology fields .
the progress and maturation of bioinformatics in the asia - pacific region are documented in editorials of previous incob supplements in bmc bioinformatics [ 5 - 10 ] and bmc genomics supplements [ 11 - 14 ] .
shortly after incob2012 , apbionet was incorporated in singapore as a public limited liability company .
the legal and organizational structure of asia pacific bioinformatics network ltd .
will ensure quality , sustainability and continuity of its mission to advance bioinformatics across the region and beyond .
overview apbionet 's 11th international conference on bioinformatics [ 14 ] was held in bangkok , thailand on oct 3 - 5 , 2012 .

several scoring systems are available to estimate prognosis and assist in selecting treatment methods for non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) patients with brain metastasis , including recursive partitioning analysis ( rpa ) , basic score for brain metastases ( bs - bm ) , and diagnosis - specific graded prognostic assessment ( ds - gpa ) .
lung - molgpa is an update of the ds - gpa that incorporates egfr and / or alk mutation status .
the present study tested the applicability of these four indexes in 361 lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastasis .
potential predictive factors in our independent multivariate analysis included patient age , karnofsky performance status , egfr and alk mutation status , and use of targeted therapy .
in the log - rank test , all four systems predicted overall survival ( os ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
harrell 's c indexes were 0.732 , 0.724 , 0.729 , and 0.747 for rpa , bs - bm , ds - gpa , and lung - molgpa , respectively .
our results confirmed that the lung - molgpa index was useful for estimating os in our patient cohort , and appeared to provide the most accurate predictions .
however , the independent prognostic factors identified in our study were not entirely in agreement with the lung - molgpa factors .
in an era of targeted therapy , lung - molgpa must be further updated to incorporate more specific prognostic factors based on additional patient data .
lung cancer adenocarcinoma brain metastass gene alterations prognosis introduction brain metastases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) [ 1 ] .
brain metastasis ( bm ) risk in nsclc is 40 % over the course of the disease [ 2 , 3 ] .
the prognosis for patients with bms is generally poor ; without treatment , median survival is estimated at 1 - 2 months. with whole brain radiotherapy ( wbrt ) , the standard treatment for bms regardless of histological subtype , median survival is 4 - 6 months [ 4 , 5 ] .
several prognostic scoring systems based on independent prognostic factors have been developed to evaluate pretreatment variable contributions , help in selecting the appropriate treatment for individual patients , and guide future research .
widely accepted prognostic systems include , recursive partitioning analysis ( rpa ) , basic score for brain metastases ( bs - bm ) , and the graded prognostic assessment index ( gpa ) [ 6 - 8 ] .
however , prognostic factors vary with cancer type and histological subtype .
many cancers that commonly result in bms , including nsclc , small - cell lung cancer , breast cancer , melanoma , and renal carcinoma , involve different prognostic factors .
accordingly , sperduto , et al. developed a diagnosis - specific prognostic factors index ( ds - gpa ) [ 9 ] .
the nsclc gpa includes age , karnofsky performance status ( kps ) , extracranial metastases , and number of bms .
although the ds - gpa stratified patients with bms by primary site and highlighted characteristics of tumors that metastasize to the brain , the various primary tumor genotypes did not fit within the prognostic classification system .
additionally , gene alterations were also important prognostic factors for bms [ 10 - 13 ] .
prognoses of lung adenocarcinoma patients with bms are often associated with gene mutation status , including mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , anaplastic lymphoma kinase - rearranged ( alk ) , and v - ki - ras2 kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( kras ) [ 10 , 14 , 15 ] .
to further refine the nsclc - specific gpa , a new prognostic system , lung - molgpa , was proposed based on 2,186 nsclc patients with bms .
this new system included not only age , kps , extracranial metastases , and number of bms , but also egfr and alk mutation status [ 16 , 17 ] .
the present study reappraised the new lung - molgpa index to determine its applicability in a chinese patient cohort .
the resultant scores were compared with those from three other published prognostic systems ( rpa , bs - bm , ds - gpa ) , and predictive values were assessed .
results patient characteristics and treatment by the end of the follow - up period for the 361 patients diagnosed with bms from lung adenocarcinoma , 160 ( 44.3 %) had confirmed egfr mutations and 10 ( 2.8 %) had alk mutations ; one patient had both .
pretreatment patient demographics are shown in table 1 .
patients were predominantly male ( 52.6 %) and nonsmokers ( 56.8 %) .
median age at diagnosis was 57 years ( range , 28 - 80 ) .
most patients ( 75.9 %) presented with a kps > 70 .
more than half of the patients had >= 2 brain lesions .
approximately 73.4 % had uncontrolled primary tumors and 61.8 % presented with extracranial metastases .
in total , 107 patients ( 29.6 %) were treated with radiotherapy only ( 77 patients with wbrt , 20 with srs , and 10 with srs plus wbrt ) , 71 ( 19.7 %) received an egfr - tki or alk - tki only ( 76.1 % of these had egfr or alk mutations ) , and 55 ( 15.2 %) were treated with rt plus an egfr - tki ( egfr - tki concurrently or sequentially with radiotherapy ) .
the remaining 63 patients received chemotherapy .
sixty - five patients received steroid treatment or best supportive care .

overall survival and prognoses at the last follow - up in january 2017 , 112 patients ( 31.0 %) were still alive .
median survival time was 11.3 months ( 95 % ci : 9.596 - 13.004 ) , and one - year survival rate was 46.9 % .
potential os predictive factors are shown in table 2 .
in univariate analyses , pretreatment prognostic factors predicting better os included female gender , age < 65 years , egfr or alk mutation , high kps , and no extracranial metastases .
however , only female gender was significant ( p = 0.055 ). of the various treatments , egfr - tkis resulted in the best os ( figure 1 ) .
in multivariate analyses , os predictive factors included age , egfr or alk status , kps , and targeted therapy .

discussion prognostic indexes are important tools for estimating prognosis and tailoring treatments for individual patients with bms .
such indexes are usually established by summing the prognostic weights of independent factors in cox regression models and then dividing these into risk zones .
however , independent prognostic factors vary depending on the primary tumor site , and other biological makers may also play roles .
the recently published nsclc - specific lung - molgpa index is the first to incorporate both traditional factors , such as patient age and gender , and egfr and alk mutation status [ 16 , 17 ] .
our assessment showed that the lung - molgpa index offers medium os predictive ability in lung adenocarcinoma patients with bms .
in our study , all four of the published prognostic indexes assessed could predict patient prognosis , demonstrating the reliability and clinical relevance of these scores .
however , the lung - molgpa is the first prognostic system , updated from the lung - ds - gpa , that includes potential biomarker statuses .
harrell 's concordance indexes ranged from 0.724 - 0.747 ( medium predictive ability ) for the four indexes , with the lung - molgpa performing best .
however , multivariate analysis results in the present study did not totally agree with those of sperduto , et al .
[ 16 ] .
independent pretreatment prognostic factors in the cox regression model were kps , egfr and alk status , and age .
in our study , number of metastases and control of primary tumor , which are included in the lung - molgpa index , were not significant .
we suggest three possible reasons for these discrepancies .
first , treatments in the present study differed from those in the study by sperduto , et al. , in which all bm patients were treated with wbrt or srs .
in our study , 34.9 % of patients received targeted therapy , which systematically treated both cranial and extracranial lesions [ 18 ] .
therefore , number of metastases and control of primary tumor might not appear significant in our multivariate analysis .
targeted therapy is now widely recognized as the first - line treatment for patients with egfr mutations [ 19 - 21 ] , and radiotherapy appears to offer these patients no survival benefit [ 22 , 23 ] .
our study also showed that egfr - tki treatment alone was the most effective of the options evaluated via log - rank test .
our multivariate analysis , which included both pretreatment and treatment factors , showed that both gene mutation status and targeted therapy could predict prognosis .
this confirms the need to incorporate gene statuses into prognostic indexes for lung adenocarcinoma patients with bms .
second , due to egfr mutation variations between chinese and western patients , the present study had a higher egfr mutation rate than the sperduto , et al. study ( 44.3 % vs. 29 %) [ 24 , 25 ] .
thus , more patients in our study were treated with egfr - tkis , potentially impacting our results .
finally , sperduto , et al. reported that only 54 % of patients ( 816 / 1,521 ) had confirmed egfr and / or alk alternations .
this finding might have reduced the weight of gene alterations and thus affected cox regression analysis results .
our findings suggest that identification of novel independent pretreatment prognostic factors would increase nsclc bm patient prognostic index accuracies .
our study had several limitations .
initially , only 106 patients had been tested with alk mutations status .
this may underscore the effects of this gene alteration in multivariate analysis .
additionally , the number of non - adenocarcinoma nsclc patients with gene mutations was small , and this subgroup was not studied .
the egfr mutation rate in patients without adenocarcinoma of the lung is < 5 % [ 26 ] .
in our study , 11 / 47 non - adenocarcinoma patients with bms ( 23.4 %) had egfr mutations .
a specific prognostic system for this patient subgroup is needed .
in conclusion , we confirmed that the lung - molgpa index could be useful in estimating os in patients with bms from lung adenocarcinoma .
the lung - molgpa appeared to offer the most accurate predictions of the four systems assessed .
however , the independent prognostic factors found in our study did not entirely match those of the lung - molgpa index .
in the era of targeted therapy , this index must be further updated to incorporate more specific prognostic factors based on additional patient data .
materials and methods patient eligibility a total of 2,823 patients with nsclc and egfr mutations were identified between january 2010 and august 2016 from our lung cancer medical database .
all egfr mutations were identified by direct dna sequencing or amplification refractory mutation system ( arms ) .
some patients were also tested for alk mutations by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) or immunohistochemical ( ihc ) staining .
patients selected for this study had been diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma and bms via computed tomography ( ct ) and / or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) at diagnosis or during the course of treatment .
patients with synchronous lung cancer and other cancers were excluded .
patient clinical and treatment data , follow - up examination results , and / or date of death were available .
as a result , 408 patients were diagnosed with bms .
thirty - one patients with squamous cell lung cancer , six with neuroendocrine carcinoma , four with small cell lung cancer , two with synchronous lung cancer and esophageal carcinoma , one with breast cancer , and one with cervical cancer were excluded from the study .
two additional patients were excluded due to incomplete clinical data .
in total , 361 patients met the selection criteria .
patient - related variables included age , gender , kps , primary lesion status ( controlled vs. uncontrolled ) , extracranial systemic metastases ( present or absent ) , number of bms ( single vs. multiple ) , gene mutation status ( egfr - or alk - positive vs. egfr - negative and alk - negative / unknown ) .
treatment options included wbrt , stereotactic radiosurgery ( srs ) , management with egfr - tkis ( tyrosine kinase inhibitors ; gefitinib or erlotinib ) , chemotherapy , and targeted therapy and radiotherapy combined .
the institutional review board of shanxi cancer hospital approved the study .
the primary endpoint of this study was overall survival ( os ) , defined from the date of bm diagnosis to death or last follow - up. os and prognostic factors were evaluated in uni - and multivariate analyses .
patients were stratified according to rpa , ds - gpa , and bs - bm criteria separately .
rpa , gpa , bs - bm , and nsclc - specific gpa parameters are shown in table 4 .
differences between the systems and their predictive values were evaluated .

background and aims increased evidence suggests a pro - atherogenic role for conventional dendritic cells ( cdc ) .
however , due to the lack of an exclusive marker for cdc , their exact contribution to atherosclerosis remains elusive .
recently , a unique transcription factor was described for cdc , namely zbtb46 , enabling us to selectively target this cell type in mice .
methods low - density lipoprotein receptor - deficient ( ldlr - / - ) mice were transplanted with bone marrow from zbtb46 - diphtheria toxin receptor ( dtr ) transgenic mice following total body irradiation .
zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras were fed a western - type diet for 18 weeks while cdc were depleted by administering diphtheria toxin ( dt ) .
results although we confirmed efficient direct induction of cdc death in vitro and in vivo upon dt treatment of zbtb46 - dtr mice , advanced atherosclerotic plaque size and composition was not altered .
surprisingly , however , analysis of zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras showed that depletion of cdc was not sustained following 18 weeks of dt treatment .
in contrast , high levels of anti - dt antibodies were detected .
conclusions because of the observed generation of anti - dt antibodies and consequently the partial depletion of cdc , no clear decision can be taken on the role of cdc in atherosclerosis .
our results underline the unsuitability of zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - mice for studying the involvement of cdc in maintaining the disease process of atherosclerosis , as well as of other chronic inflammatory diseases .

introduction the pathophysiological process of atherosclerosis is marked by chronic inflammation mediated by both innate and adaptive immune responses [ 1,2 ] .
dendritic cells ( dc ) , the most potent antigen - presenting cells of the body , were found to be central in regulating these immune responses [ 3,4 ] .
the presence of dc has been reported in atherosclerotic plaques [ 5 - 8 ] , and dyslipidemia associated with atherosclerosis was found to alter dc activation and migration [ 9 ] .
in addition , it was shown that vascular dc play a pivotal role in the earliest accumulation of lipids in the aortic wall [ 10 ] , which forces us to reconsider the widely held view that monocytes are the earliest immune cells to contribute to lesion development .
in the steady state , dc are essential in preserving arterial homeostasis by maintaining tolerance to self - antigens .
however , after encountering modified antigens from the arterial wall under pro - inflammatory conditions , dc migrate into draining lymphoid tissues , where they may activate t cells specific for these antigens , thereby inducing and maintaining atherosclerotic inflammation [ 3,4 ] .
the majority of murine dc belong to the conventional ( c ) dc subset , which can be further classified into cdc type 1 , encompassing lymphoid tissue - resident cd8alpha + cdc and their migratory counterparts cd103 + cdc , and cd11b + cdc type 2 [ 11 ] .
cd103 + cdc are likely tolerogenic and protect against atherosclerosis by regulating local homeostasis of regulatory t cells ( treg ) [ 12 ] .
furthermore , we previously found that cd11b + cdc are the most predominant subset in human plaques and that circulating numbers of cd11b + cdc in mice strongly correlate with inflammation in early plaque development [ 13 ] .
the past few years , researchers have attempted to clarify the specific contribution of cdc in atherosclerotic mice , with mixed or unsatisfactory results due to the lack of selective markers expressed on individual dc populations [ 10,14 - 16 ] .
recently , a novel and evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factor was identified , zbtb46 ( also known as btbd4 or zdc ) , which is exclusively expressed by pre - cdc , and lymphoid organ - and tissue - resident cdc , but not monocytes or other immune populations [ 17,18 ] .
this has led to the development of a new mouse model in which the receptor for diphtheria toxin ( dtr ) was inserted into the 3 ' untranslated region of the zbtb46 locus to serve as a way to specifically deplete cdc [ 17 ] .
in the present study , we aimed at further elucidating the contribution of cdc , derived from pre - cdc , in the context of atherosclerosis .
for this , lethally irradiated , atherosclerosis - prone , low - density lipoprotein receptor - deficient ( ldlr - / - ) mice were transplanted with bone marrow from zbtb46 - dtr donor mice , allowing for specific depletion of cdc following administration of dt. the impact of this depletion was studied by analyzing immune cell distribution in blood and all relevant tissues , including spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes ( ln ) .
materials and methods bone marrow transplantation and atherosclerosis induction in mice bone marrow chimeras were obtained through a bone marrow transplantation .
male and female 8 - 10 weeks old ldlr - / - recipient mice ( jackson laboratory ; stock number 002207 ) were exposed to a single dose of 10 gray total body irradiation using an x - rad 320 ( precision x - ray ) 3h before reconstitution with 1x107 bone marrow cells from zbtb46 - dtr transgenic mice ( jackson laboratory ; stock number 019506 ) via tail vein injection .
drinking water with antibiotics ( 0.15mg / ml baytril ( r ) ; bayer ) and 5g / l sucrose ( life technologies ) was introduced one week before irradiation until 3 weeks after transplantation .
after a recovery period of 4 weeks , zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras were fed a western - type diet ( wd ) containing 0.2 % cholesterol ( 4021.90 ; ab diets ) for 18 weeks .
treatment protocol for transient cdc ablation , mice were injected intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) with 20ng diphtheria toxin ( dt ; sigma - aldrich ) per gram of body weight ( ng / g.bw ) .
to maintain cdc ablation , zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras received 4ng dt / g.bw on the 3rd day after the initial dt injection and every 3rd day thereafter .
control mice were injected with water for injection ( nacl 0.9 % , braun ) .
at the end of the experiment , mice were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital ( 250mg / kg.bw , i.p. ) .

results the zbtb46 - dtr mouse model enables cdc depletion both in vitro and in vivo to validate the sensitivity of cdc to dt and the competence of the zbtb46 - dtr mouse model to deplete cdc , in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed .
treatment of bmdc of zbtb46 - dtr mice with 2000ng / ml dt resulted in a significantly lower proportion of immature and mature cdc ( fig 1a and 1b ) that could be recovered from the in vitro cell culture .
this reduction was accompanied by a concomitant increase in annexin - v - positive cells ( fig 1c ). by contrast , immature and mature bmdc from wild - type mice were insensitive to dt treatment , as evidenced by similar proportions of annexin - v - positive cells following dt treatment ( s1 fig ) .

the in vivo experiment was performed following the method described by meredith et al .
[ 17 ] .
in brief , zbtb46 - dtr mice were sacrificed 14h after a single injection with vehicle or 20ng dt / g.bw. flow cytometric analysis of splenocytes demonstrated a significant drop ( 72 %) in the percentage of total cdc 14h after dt injection ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
as part of the in vivo validation of the zbtb46 - dtr model , a cleaved caspase - 3 staining was applied to a limited number of spleens .
quantification of the number of cleaved caspase - 3 - positive cells showed a significant difference between the two groups , thereby confirming elevated cell death in vivo after dt administration ( fig 2c ) .
interestingly , the cells undergoing apoptosis are not macrophages , committed erythroid progenitors or endothelial cell populations [ 18 ] , as cells positive for cd68 , ter119 , and cd31 do not co - express caspase - 3 ( fig 2d - 2f ) .
double staining of cleaved caspase - 3 and cd11c , which is used here as a pan marker for dc , revealed the presence of apoptotic cd11c + cells in spleens of dt - treated mice ( fig 2g , arrow heads ) .
however , it needs to be noted that apoptosis of cd11c + cells could also be detected in the control samples , albeit cd11c staining in these samples was not optimal .

arrow heads indicate apoptotic cd11c + cells ; scale bar = 50mum .
long - term dt treatment does not affect the leukocyte profile in blood , spleen and ln similar to cd11c - dtr mice , it is described that a single injection of dt is lethal in zbtb46 - dtr mice within 24 - 48h , probably due to the expression of zbtb46 in committed erythroid progenitors and endothelial cells .
therefore , experiments involving prolonged dt administration necessitate the use of radiation chimeras in which non - hematopoietic cells remain of recipient origin , insensitive to dt [ 17,23 ] .
in this study , lethally irradiated ldlr - / - mice were grafted with bone marrow cells from zbtb46 - dtr mice to generate zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras .
a degree of chimerism of > 90 % was considered successful .
on average , a chimerism degree of 94.1 +/ - 2.4 % was achieved .
for long - term administration of dt ( 18 weeks ) , the treatment protocol was followed as described by meredith et al .
[ 17 ] .
in brief , zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeric mice were injected every 3 days with 4ng / g.bw dt. upon sacrifice , blood , spleen , and mediastinal ln were collected for flow cytometric analysis ( s2 fig , gating strategy ) .
total leukocyte numbers in blood , spleen , and ln did not differ between the control and treatment group ( fig 3a ) .
total cdc were significantly reduced from blood and spleens of dt - treated zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeric mice ( fig 3b ) .
no differences could be seen in cdc numbers in the ln , nor in cd11b + and cd103 + cdc subsets ( fig 3c and 3d ) .
as leukocytes crucially affect atherosclerosis , we examined the effect of chronic dt treatment of zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras on other leukocyte subpopulations as well .
flow cytometric analysis of blood , spleen and ln did not reveal any significant differences in the proportion of t cells , b cells , nk cells or neutrophils ( fig 3e - 3h ) .
in addition , the percentage of ly - 6clow and ly - 6chigh monocytes in blood did not differ between the control and treatment group ( fig 3i ) .

chronic dt administration does not affect atherosclerosis in zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - mice in parallel with the flow cytometric analysis , we examined whether long - term dt administration had an impact on atherosclerosis .
therefore , zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeric mice were fed a wd diet while injected with 4ng / g.bw dt every 3 days for 18 weeks .
dt administration was well tolerated , with no differences in body weight between the control and experimental group ( table 4 ) .
noteworthy , as a result of the irradiation therapy , the fur of all mice grayed .
analysis of the spleen weight revealed a significant decrease in dt treated mice .
there was no significant difference for heart weight between the two groups ( table 4 ) .
furthermore , plasma cholesterol levels did not differ between the control and dt - treated group ( table 4 ) .

oil - red - o stained cryosections were used to determine the plaque area .
plaques in the aortic root did not show a difference in size between control and dt - treated chimeras ( fig 4a ) .
features of plaque stability were similar in both groups , as no changes were observed in vascular smooth muscle cell content and total collagen ( fig 4b and 4c ) .
moreover , the degree of necrosis did not differ between control ( 25.28 +/ - 2.56 %) and dt - treated mice ( 27.48 +/ - 2.71 %) ( p = 0.792 ) .
dt binds to hb - egf ( which acts as dtr ) and , following internalisation , inhibits protein synthesis which rapidly induces apoptosis [ 24 ] .
nonetheless , staining of plaques with cleaved caspase - 3 antibody did not show a significant increase in plaque apoptosis between control and dt - treated chimeras ( fig 4d ) .
consequently , no difference was observed in the proportion of cd11c + cells within plaques ( fig 4e ) .

data that failed the levene 's test of homogeneity of variances were mathematically transformed before statistical analysis was performed .
insufficient cell depletion is mediated by anti - dt humoral immunity , but independent of dtr resistance since the efficacy of dt - mediated cell ablation may be hampered by the development of neutralizing anti - dt antibodies upon repeated administration of dt [ 22 ] , we determined the presence of antibodies directed against dt in plasma samples of untreated ( control ) and dt - treated mice .
indeed , dt - specific antibodies of the igg1 isotype were detected after 18 weeks of treatment with dt ( od450 3.12 +/ - 0.18 vs. 0.35 +/ - 0.02 in control mice ; fig 5a ) , which could account for the ineffectiveness of this mouse model to achieve long - term cdc depletion using the dt - mediated technology .

an fmo sample is used as control ( grey ) .
previously , it was also described that following continuous dt treatment a cell population lacking dtr expression and hence resistant to further dt - mediated depletion emerged [ 25,26 ] .
in order to exclude the possibility that the lack of an effect on atherosclerosis development is due to the loss of dtr expression on dc , we compared intracellular dtr expression by flow cytometric analysis between splenic cdc from zbtb46 - dtr mice before dt treatment and splenic cdc from zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras at the end of the study .
splenic cdc from ldlr - / - mice were used as a control .
as shown in fig 5b , splenic cdc from zbtb46 - dtr mice before dt treatment as wells as from zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras after chronic dt treatment robustly express intracellular dtr .
discussion up till now , investigating the contribution of cdc to atherosclerosis was hampered by the fact that there is no selective marker exclusively expressed by cdc .
nevertheless , depletion of dc was first achieved by jung et al. who used the murine cd11c promoter for the transgenic expression of human dtr [ 14 ] .
when bred onto the ldlr - / - background , dt treatment resulted in a marked reduction in intimal cd11c + cells and a 55 % decrease in accumulation of lipids during the earliest stages of plaque formation [ 10 ] .
prolonging the lifespan of dc ( and cd11c - expressing macrophages ) in mice that carry cd11c - specific expression of the anti - apoptotic hbcl2 , did not accelerate plaque progression [ 16 ] .
moreover , cholesterol levels were reduced in these mice , whereas depletion of dc resulted in enhanced cholesterolemia , indicative of a potential role for dc in cholesterol homeostasis [ 16 ] .
nevertheless , a major drawback of using the cd11c - dtr mouse model is the depletion of other immune cells besides dc , also expressing cd11c such as metallophilic and marginal zone macrophages [ 27 ] .
depletion of monocytes and macrophages in cd11b - dtr transgenic mice was shown to differentially affect atherosclerosis .
unfortunately , the authors did not investigate whether the cd11b + cdc subpopulation was also depleted [ 28 ] .
constitutive deficiency of the chemokine receptor cx3cr1 in apolipoprotein e - deficient ( apoe - / - ) mice resulted in an impaired accumulation of dc in the aortic wall and reduced atherosclerotic burden at early stages [ 29 ] .
however , cx3cr1 is also required for monocyte recruitment and survival .
here , we used the recently developed zbtb46 - dtr mouse model which allows specific depletion of cdc and their precursors , while sparing other hematopoietic cells [ 17,18 ] .
zbtb46 acts as a suppressor of dc activation and mhc class ii expression in the immature state [ 30 ] .
in the present study , we aimed at dissecting the exact role of cdc in the context of atherosclerosis .
in analogy to the experiments conducted by meredith et al .
[ 17 ] , our in vitro and in vivo validation experiments confirmed that cdc could be depleted upon injection of dt in a zbtb46 - dtr mouse model .
however , we were not able to reach the same degree of depletion as reported by meredith et al .
[ 17 ] , who demonstrated a near complete ablation of cdc in spleens of dt - treated zbtb46 - dtr mice .
here , depletion of cdc could not be fully sustained for a longer period of time in zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras , despite continuous dt injections .
except for a partial depletion in blood and spleen , no depletion of cdc was observed in ln after 18 weeks of dt treatment .
in most studies reported so far , only short term dt administration is used to evaluate depletion efficiency in vitro and in vivo .
in general , studies examining atherosclerosis in dtr mouse models for more than 2 weeks are scarce and often do not detail on dc numbers in the circulation or associated lymphoid tissues .
on the basis of previously published reports regarding the kinetics of dc depletion in dtr transgenic mice , a twice - weekly dt administration regimen was chosen for the long - term depletion of cdc in zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras [ 14,17 ] .
however , following 18 weeks of dt treatment , anti - dt antibodies arise in the circulation of treated animals , possibly explaining the inefficient depletion in this study , in agreement with a recent study by wang et al. [ 31 ] .
although even incomplete depletion in cd11c - dtr mice ( with 70 - 80 % efficacy ) was reported to alter the balance of the immune response [ 32 ] , and decrease inflammatory cytokine production in atherosclerosis [ 33 ] by others , we could not confirm these findings .
for this , we hypothesize that the remaining dc potently stimulate the immune response , and that consequently any partial depletion would not be sufficient to suppress the long - term development of atherosclerosis in zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - chimeras .
while anti - dt antibody levels should be carefully monitored when dt treatment is used for more than 2 weeks , at the same time efforts should be made to ascertain whether the development of anti - dt antibodies can be avoided , be reduced or delayed , such as less frequent administration or lower dose of dt. very recently , an inducible system for cdc depletion was developed by loschko et al .
[ 34 ] who introduced a loxp - flanked transcriptional stop element in front of the dtr , and inserted this cassette into the zbtb46 gene ( zdclsldtr ) .
to restrict dtr expression to cdc , zdclsldtr mice were crossbred with transgenic mice expressing cre under the control of the csf1 receptor gene ( csf1rcre ) [ 34 ] .
in csf1rcre + zdclsldtr mice expression of dtr under the control of zbtb46 is restricted to cdc which bypasses endothelial cells and omits the use of bone marrow chimeras .
cdc can be efficiently depleted for at least 4 weeks in these mice .
however , as previously demonstrated [ 35 ] , the authors reported increased levels of flt3l upon cdc depletion , whereas it is not known if anti - dt immunity occurs in these mice upon repeated administration of dt. altogether , it is unclear from these observations if cdc depletion is sustained longer than 4 weeks .
although in our hands incomplete depletion does not impact atherosclerosis , this is not always the case .
others reported that dt treatment of apoe - / - cd11c - dtr bone marrow chimeras resulted in a significant dc depletion of approximately 78 % in the aorta and spleen .
as a result , transient depletion reduced oxldl uptake and cytokine expression in the aortas of dt - injected mice .
however , these mice were fed a wd for 12 weeks , of which they were injected with dt during the last 2 weeks , whereas in the present study , we started dt treatment before the onset of atherosclerosis and repetitively injected dt up to 18 weeks [ 33 ] .
albeit that it is possible that an 18 - week follow up period is too long in order to observe an effect on plaque development , because these mice are already in a more progressive stage of disease , it would be interesting to longitudinally investigate the role of cdc in the initiation of atherosclerotic plaque development at earlier time points of the disease before the onset of anti - dt antibodies .
others recently suggested the emergence of targeted cell populations that have lost dtr expression as an explanation for insufficient cell depletion in dtr models [ 25,26 ] .
however , our results demonstrate that , even after long - term dt treatment , the receptor for dt is present on splenic cdc to the same extent as on splenic cdc from untreated zbtb46 - dtr mice .
zbtb46 expression was shown to be restricted to cdc precursors ( pre - cdc ) and lymphoid organ - and tissue - resident cdc .
however , satpathy et al .
[ 18 ] demonstrated that a major subpopulation of pre - cdc in the bone marrow expressed the plasmacytoid ( p ) dc marker siglech , and that by inserting a gfp reporter cassette into the zbtb46 locus , four distinct pre - cdc populations could be defined by zbtb46 vs. siglech expression .
importantly , they showed that , although siglech is specific for pdc in peripheral organs , bone marrow progenitors expressing siglech but not zbtb46 , retain the potential to develop into cdc [ 18 ] .
hence , although in the zbtb46 - dtr mouse model cdc and zbtb46 - expressing pre - cdc are depleted , other pre - cdc capable to replenish cdc in the periphery may exist in the bone marrow .
in this perspective others demonstrated that zbtb46 deficiency alters the cdc subset composition in the spleen in favor of cd8 + cdc [ 30 ]. whether this could have contributed to the immune - mediated pathogenesis seen here should be further examined .
nevertheless , we found no differences in the proportions of cd11b + and cd103 + cdc between control and dt - treated mice .
additionally , zbtb46 - dtr mice provide a model to ablate pre - dc - derived cdc while sparing other hematopoietic cells [ 17 ] .
however , as a consequence of hypercholesterolemia , blood monocytes can be recruited into the intima where they can give rise to phenotypically similar monocyte - derived cd11b + dc populations making it difficult to observe a relative contribution of cdc derived from pre - dc versus those derived from monocytes in the context of atherosclerosis .
yet , we did not observe any changes in circulating monocyte subsets .
taken together , as a possible consequence of the development of anti - dt antibodies , zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - mice become resistant to dt treatment during 18 weeks resulting in a partial recovery of the cdc .
for this , we cannot pinpoint the role of cdc in atherosclerosis and conclude that the zbtb46 - dtr - - > ldlr - / - mouse model is not suitable to study the involvement of cdc in atherosclerosis , or in other chronic inflammatory diseases. whether or not bona fide cdc significantly contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation and stability remains to be determined .

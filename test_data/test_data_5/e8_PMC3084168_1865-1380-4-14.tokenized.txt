diabetic foot wounds represent a class of chronic non - healing wounds that can lead to the development of soft tissue infections and osteomyelitis .
we reviewed the case of a 44 - year - old female with a diabetic foot wound who developed gas gangrene while treating her wound with tea tree oil , a naturally derived antibiotic agent .
this case report includes images that represent clinical examination and x - ray findings of a patient who required broad - spectrum antibiotics and emergent surgical consultation .
emergency department ( ed ) detection of these complications may prevent loss of life or limb in these patients .
background the lifetime incidence of diabetic foot ulcers may be as high as 25 % [ 1 ] ; however , gas gangrene is not common in these patients .
the most common causative organism in gas gangrene is clostridium perfringens [ 2 ] .
it is also important to rule out underlying osteomyelitis .
in patients with diabetic foot ulcers , streptococcus group a , staphlococcus aureus and pseudomonas may be present .
if surgical debridement and antibiotics are not effective , amputation may be required .
tea tree oil , the essential oil of melaleuca alternifolia , is a commonly available , naturally derived , topical antiseptic .
tea tree oil is known to possess antibiotic activity toward a broad spectrum of pathogens , including methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) and candida albicans [ 3 ] .
case presentation a 44 - year - old female with a history of diabetes presented to the emergency department complaining of increased right foot pain for 3 - 4 days with redness and swelling .
she had been applying tea tree oil to the wound .
her vital signs were blood pressure : 91 / 50 , heart rate : 111 , respiratory rate : 20 , temperature : 36.4degreesc and oxygen saturation : 100 % on room air .
there were swelling and inflammation to the right foot and a foul - smelling odor .
dark blisters were noted with erythema tracking up the lateral aspect of the leg .
there was a 4 x 3 x 2.5 cm ulcer plantar surface of the foot with maceration of the periwound skin and a serosanguinous drainage that had a mild odor .
she was able to plantar and dorsiflex , and had diminished fine sensation .
the patient had 1 + dorsalis pedis pulses and normal capillary refill .
laboratory studies showed a wbc of 14.7 , neutrophils 74 % with 17 % bands .
radiographs of the right foot showed subcutaneous and deep fascial emphysema of the foot with extension along the plantar surface .
irregularities consistent with osteomyelitis of the distal first metatarsal and distal second proximal phalanx were noted .
after admission , the patient was treated with clindamycin and underwent a transmetatarsal amputation .
blood cultures were negative , and wound cultures were deemed inconclusive .
wound infection developed , and the patient was treated with vancomycin and moxifloxacin .
an ankle disarticulation was performed .
the wound did well at that point and the rest of the hospital course , and outpatient management was unremarkable .
discussion diabetic foot ulcers are a significant complication and are credited with causing 85 % of limb amputations among diabetics .
in a review by sing et al. , limb amputation was associated with 39 - 80 % 5 - year mortality [ 1 ] .
diabetic foot ulcers are usually the result of some minor trauma that may be secondary to the patient 's decreased sensation .
ulceration in areas of increased pressure is also common .
usually offloading , debridement , advanced wound care dressings and close follow - up result in improvement of these wounds .
hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also commonly used as an adjunct in the care of these wounds .
these are chronic wounds and require weeks of therapy and numerous clinic visits .
when care is not taken to prevent infection , the wounds can become deep , and osteomyelitis and serious soft tissue infection may occur .
tea tree oil a particularly interesting element of this case is the patient 's use of the home remedy , tea tree oil .
this essential oil is bactericidal and known to have some broad - spectrum antibiotic affects [ 3 - 8 ] .
tea tree oil is one of a number of essential oils that possesses an active monoterpene constituent .
in a study by cox et al. , the monoterpene in tea tree oil was shown to damage cell membranes and inhibit cellular respiration in escheria coli , staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans [ 4 ] .
it has also been shown to have activity against pseudomonas species [ 6 ] .
tea tree oil has been demonstrated to have antibiotic effects on a number of bacteria , including important skin flora like methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus [ 3 ] .
in addition to its antiseptic , antibiotic and antifungal activity , tea tree oil also has some anti - inflammatory effects [ 7 ] .
the antiseptic property of tea tree oil likely explains the lack of useful wound culture results in this case .
assessement pain is a common presenting complaint and may be the first sign in patients with gas gangrene .
bullae and the bluish skin discoloration are classic findings of gas gangrene and were noted have begun to show at the time of presentation of this case ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
edema and crepitus are usually present at the time of diagnosis ; however , some references state that as many as 50 % of cases may not have discernable crepitus or gas on radiographs on initial presentation [ 9 ] .
the patient 's periwound areas were also quite macerated .
this was due to the moderate amount of serosanguinous drainage the patient was having , which is also common with gas gangrene .
this drainage is often described as having a " sickly sweet " odor .
figure 1 dorsal aspect reveals ulceration of secong digit , blisters and discoloration .
figure 2 plantar aspect reveals diabetic foot ulcer .
x - ray images should be obtained in patients with diabetic foot ulcers to evaluate for the presence of osteomyelitis and gas in the soft tissues .
osteomyelitis was noted in this case ; however , the soft tissue gas is much more prominent ( figure 3 ) .
the presence of gas on x - ray of the affected area should prompt the clinician to obtain images up to the next proximal joint in order to ascertain the extent of the infection [ 10 ] .
in cases where gas is not seen , but deep space soft tissue infection is suspected , computed tomography ( ct ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) may be appropriate .
figure 3 x - ray reveals soft - tissue gas consistent with gangrene .
management emergency department treatment for patients with signs of cellulitis with or without crepitus includes intravenous ( iv ) antibiotics .
antibiotic choice is varied and may be institutionally dependent .
broad - spectrum penicillins , such as piperacillin - tazobactam , are most commonly employed [ 11 ] .
superficial wounds can be debrided , and eschers and fibrous caps removed , if the ed practitioner is skilled in these procedures .
drainage and debrided material should be cultured .
clinical response to therapy and culture results are usually used to direct changes in antibiotic therapy during the inpatient phase of management .
it is important to remember that ( iv ) and oral antibiotics do not penetrate devascularized tissues .
gangrene and deep space infections require surgical debridement in the operating room .
some patient presentations may be complicated by sepsis or shock , and iv fluid therapy is indicated along with other supportive measures .
aggressive debridement may be necessary for wounds associated with crepitus .
surgical exploration may help determine whether the condition is crepitant cellulitis verses gas gangrene .
necrotic and infected tissues , including muscle and fascia , should be removed , and healthy tissues should be preserved if possible .
during surgical exploration , it may become apparent that amputation is necessary , which is the case in 25 % of severe diabetic foot infections [ 10 ] .
in addition to its role in chronic management of diabetic foot ulcers , hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( hbot ) may have a role in the acute management of patients that develop infectious complications of their wound ( s ) .
a review by kaide et al. states that hbot has been shown to suppress alpha toxin of clostridium , enhance leukocyte - killing activity , enhance destruction of anaerobic bacteria , suppress bacterial growth , enhance antibiotic effects , and improve tissue repair in poorly vascularized tissues [ 9 ] .
the review also states that hbot , when added to antibiotics and surgery , has also been found to reduce the rate of mortality and morbidity ( including amputation ) .
during surgery , patients undergoing hbot were found to have clearer demarcation between viable and necrotic tissues , allowing for improved surgical debridement .
conclusion although an uncommon complication of diabetic foot ulcer , gas gangrene may develop in patients with these chronic non - healing wounds .
special care must be taken in the ed evaluation of these wounds to rule out the diagnosis of soft tissue infections , as well as osteomyelitis .
the management of gas gangrene requires rapid recognition and immediate therapy .
in addition to broad spectrum antibiotics and surgical consultation , the ed physician may also consider consulting for hbot and icu evaluations if appropriate .

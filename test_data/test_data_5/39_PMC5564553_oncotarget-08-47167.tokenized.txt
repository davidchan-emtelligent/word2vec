we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in the nuclear assembly factor 1 ( naf1 ) and tnfaip3 - interacting protein 1 ( tnip1 ) gene were associated with susceptibility to esophageal cancer in a chinese han population .
five snps were genotyped and their relationship with esophageal cancer risk was analyzed in a sample of 386 esophageal cancer patients and 495 unrelated healthy controls recruited from the first affiliated hospital of xi'an jiaotong university .
patients with the ag genotype of rs2320615 were at lower risk of developing esophageal cancer than those with the gg genotype ( adjusted odds ratio [ or ] = 0.64 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] = 0.46 - 0.90 , p = 0.009 ) .
the rs2320615 snp was found to be associated with a decreased the risk of esophageal cancer in the dominant model ( adjusted or = 0.70 , 95 % ci = 0.51 - 0.96 , p = 0.026 ) .
these results provide the first evidence that the rs2320615 in naf1 was associated with reduced risk of esophageal cancer .
further studies with larger samples are warranted to confirm our findings .
esophageal cancer genetic polymorphism naf1 han chinese case - control introduction esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer - related mortality worldwide because of its extremely aggressive nature and the poor survival rate of affected patients [ 1 , 2 ] .
the risk of esophageal cancer has been associated with various environmental and genetic factors , as well as their interactions .
epidemiological evidence indicates that the most important environmental risk factors for esophageal cancer development include cigarette smoking , alcohol drinking , malnutrition , inadequate intake of fruits and fresh vegetables , and frequent consumption of pickled vegetables [ 3 , 4 ] .
however , not all people exposed to these hazards eventually suffer from esophageal cancer .
recent studies have suggested the importance of genetic polymorphisms in the carcinogenesis and development of esophageal cancer [ 5 , 6 ] .
previous studies identified the nuclear - assembly factor 1 ( naf1 ) protein is an essential h / aca assembly factor , which might have a central role in coupling h / aca snornp assembly interact with the carboxy terminal domain ( ctd ) of rna polymerase ( pol ) ii , and could facilitate recruitment and binding of the h / aca core proteins to the nascent snorna sequences [ 7 , 8 ] .
in addition , a genome - wide meta - analysis found that one snp ( rs7675998 ) in naf1 was associated with telomere length ( p = 4.35x10 - 16 ) [ 9 ] .
rs2320615 was reported to be the best surrogates for rs7675998 ( pairwise r2 = 0.89 ) [ 10 ] and which was found to be associated with longer tl ( p - trend = 3.3x10 - 4 ) [ 11 ] .
interestingly , short telomere lengths have been associated with esophageal carcinogenesis [ 12 ] .
tnip1 ( tnfalpha - induced protein 3 - interacting protein 1 ) , alternatively called abin - 1 ( a20 - binding inhibitor of nf - kappab activation ) or naf1 ( nef - associated factor 1 ) .
tnip1 is a human cellular protein initially identified as interacting with the hiv proteins nef [ 13 ] and matrix [ 14 ] .
it has been reported that tnip1 are associated with some diseases , such as leukemia - lymphoma [ 15 ] , systemic lupus erythematosus [ 16 - 18 ] , psoriatic arthritis [ 19 ] , systemic sclerosis [ 20 , 21 ] , asthma [ 22 ] , and gastric carcinoma [ 23 ] .
a previous study revealed that tnip1 inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa - b ( nf - kappab ) [ 24 ] , and another study demonstrated that blocking the nf - kappab signaling pathway inhibited esophageal cancer proliferation and metastasis [ 25 ] .
given the importance of telomere length and the nf - kappab signaling pathway in the development and maintenance of esophageal cancer , we hypothesized genetic polymorphisms in naf1 and tnip1 may influence esophageal cancer susceptibility .
to test this hypothesis , we designed a case - control study including 386 esophageal cancer patients and 495 healthy controls to investigate the potential associations between snps and the risk of esophageal cancer in a han chinese population .
results the basic characteristics of the cases and controls included in this study are summarized in table 1 .
in total , 386 esophageal cancer patients ( 308 males and 78 females ) with a mean age of 60.9 (+/ - 9.0 ) years and 495 healthy controls ( 180 males and 315 females ) with a mean age of 54.5 (+/ - 9.4 ) years were enrolled in our study .
the age and gender distributions differed significantly between the cases and healthy controls ( p < 0.001 ) .
to eliminate any residual confounding effects , we adjusted for the variables of age and gender in the subsequent multivariable unconditional logistic regression analysis .
table 1 characteristics of esophageal cancer cases and healthy controls variable case n (%) control n (%) p total 386 495 gender < 0.001 male 308 ( 79.8 ) 180 ( 36.4 ) female 78 ( 20.2 ) 315 ( 63.6 ) age , < 0.001 yrs ( mean +/ - sd ) 60.9 +/ - 9.0 54.5 +/ - 9.4 p values were calculated with pearson 's chi2 test ( gender ) and welch 's t test ( age ) .
p < 0.05 indicates statistical significance .
the five snps ( rs2320615 , rs3792792 , rs4958881 , rs7708392 , and rs10036748 ) were successfully genotyped in the esophageal cancer cases and healthy controls .
the average snp call rate was 98.3 % in cases and controls .
the sequences of primers for each snp polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and single base extension reaction are listed in table 2 .
the minor allele frequencies for the five snps in the patient samples and normal controls are shown in table 3 .
we used a chi2 test to compare the differences in the frequency distributions of alleles between cases and controls , but no significant associations between the alleles of the five snps were detected .
one snp ( rs4958881 ) was excluded from further analyses because it deviated from hardy - weinberg equilibrium in controls ( p < 0.001 ) .

as shown in figure 1 , we conducted linkage disequilibrium analysis for the four snps , and one linkage disequilibrium block consisted of two snps ( rs7708392 and rs10036748 ) which exhibited statistically significant linkage ( r2 = 0.98 ) .
figure 1 haplotype block map for the three snps in the tnip1 gene the ld between two snps is expressed as a standardized d ' value ( red schemes ) .
discussion this case - control study was designed to investigate whether genetic variants of naf1 and tnip1 were associated with the risk of esophageal cancer in the han chinese population .
our data demonstrated that the rs2320615 in naf1 was associated with significantly reduced risk of esophageal cancer .
naf1 encodes a protein important for the assembly of h / aca human telomerase rna [ 8 ] .
this chaperone protein is involved in the formation and activity of telomerase , and a previous study indicated that naf1 polymorphism ( rs7675998 ) is associated with mean telomere length [ 9 ] .
interestingly , short leukocyte telomere lengths are associated with significantly increased risk of developing esophageal cancer [ 12 ] .
our results suggested that naf1 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of esophageal cancer .
however , it remains unclear whether these naf1 polymorphisms affect telomere length by affecting specific protein synthesis and function , and ultimately the susceptibility to esophageal cancer .
this assumption will be tested in future gene functional experiments .
our results demonstrated that the genotype ag of rs2320615 in naf1 was associated with a significantly reduced risk of esophageal cancer .
a study found that the rs2320615 is associated with longer telomere length [ 11 ] .
because we did not explore the association of the snp with telomere length and the association between telomere length and esophageal cancer risk in this study , it is unclear whether these snps affect telomere length , which in turn affects the risk of esophageal cancer .
it is possible that polymorphisms can affect the expression of genes and thus render individuals susceptible to esophageal cancer .
we will confirm our results and speculation in future studies .
two recent gwass revealed that rs7708392 and rs10036748 were associated with the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus [ 16 , 17 ] .
a previous report also indicated that the g allele of rs7708392 and the c allele of rs10036748 were associated with increased risk of gastric carcinoma , and that the haplotype ct ( rs7708392 - rs10036748 ) was associated with a reduced risk of gastric carcinoma [ 23 ] .
in addition , a significantly decreased association was found between the allele t of rs10036748 and asthma risk [ 22 ] .
recently , the nf - kappab signaling pathway was reported to be associated with tumorigenesis in esophageal cancer [ 25 ] .
nf - kappab is a ubiquitous transcription factor that involves in immunity and inflammation , regulates cell proliferation , apoptosis and migration , and is constitutively activated in a number of human cancers , including some esophageal cancers [ 26 - 28 ] .
previous studies have demonstrated that tnip1 can inhibit nf - kappab activity [ 29 , 30 ] .
however , no significant association between tnip1 and esophageal cancer risk was found in the study .
there are some limitations to the present case - control study .
first , the relatively small sample did not have sufficient statistical power to reflect the precise association between snps and the susceptibility to esophageal cancer .
second , many other risk factors ( e.g. , smoking , alcohol drinking ) were not included due to a lack of corresponding clinical information .
third , biological function analyses were not conducted and deserve further study .
in conclusion , the current study has identified that rs2320615 in the naf1 was associated with the risk of esophageal cancer in the han chinese population .
these findings provide a theoretical foundation for further research ( with a large sample ) into the association between naf1 and tnip1 and esophageal cancer risk in other populations .
materials and methods study subjects we recruited 386 patients who were diagnosed with esophageal cancer at the first affiliated hospital of xi'an jiaotong university between july 2014 and october 2015 .
the 495 controls without histories of cancer or other major diseases were randomly selected from the health evaluation center at the same hospital during the same time period .
all participants were of ethnic han origin , and their ancestors had lived in the region for at least three generations .
patients who previously had cancer , radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded .
all cases were recruited without any restrictions regarding age , sex , or disease stage .
in addition , each subject was personally questioned by trained interviewers , who used a pre - tested questionnaire to obtain basic information , including demographic data ( e.g. , age , sex ) and some clinical information .
this study was approved by the ethical committee of the first affiliated hospital of xi'an jiaotong university , and complied with the world medical association declaration of helsinki .
all individuals gave written informed consent to be included in the study .
dna extraction a vacutainer was used to collect a peripheral venous blood sample ( 5 ml ) fromeach study subject , and the sample was transferred to a tube containing ethylenediamine tetra - acetic acid .
all blood samples were stored at - 20degreesc until dna extraction .
genomic dna was isolated from whole blood with the goldmag - mini whole blood genomic dna purification kit according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( goldmag. co. ltd. , xi'an , china ) .
the concentration of the isolated dna was measured with a spectrophotometer ( nanodrop 2000 ; thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) at wavelengths of a260 and a280 nm. the dna was diluted with qiagility to a final concentration of 20 ng / mul .
snp selection and genotyping five snps ( rs2320615 , rs3792792 , rs4958881 , rs7708392 and rs10036748 ) with had minor allele frequency > 5 % in the hapmap of the chinese han beijing population that have been reported to be associated with the risk of several diseases and cancers , including systemic lupus erythematosus [ 16 - 18 ] , systemic sclerosis [ 21 ] , asthma [ 22 ] , and gastric carcinoma [ 23 ] .
they were selected for further genotyping .
primers for the amplification process and single base extension reactions were designed with sequenom mass - array assay design 3.0 software ( sequenom , san diego , ca , usa ) .
genotyping of the snps was performed with the sequenom massarray platform [ 31 ] ( sequenom , san diego , ca , usa ) according to the standard instructions recommended by the manufacturer .
sequenom typer 4.0 software was used for data management and analyses .
statistical analysis for cases and controls , we analyzed the gender distribution using pearson 's chi2 test and the age distribution by welch 's t test .
we analyzed the genotype frequencies in the controls with fisher 's exact test to determine whether the five snps departed from hardy - weinberg equilibrium .
the differences in the snp allele and genotype distributions between patients and controls were evaluated with chi - squared test / fisher 's exact tests .
genetic model analyses ( dominant , recessive and additive ) were performed with plink software to assess the significance of the snps .
the associations of the snps with the risk of esophageal cancer were estimated from the odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) , which were determined by unconditional logistic regression and adjusted for age and gender [ 32 ] .
the p - values reported are two - sided , and values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant .
we used the haploview software package ( version 4.2 ) platform for analyses of pairwise linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) and haplotype structure [ 10 ] .
all statistical analyses were performed with microsoft excel and spss 19.0 ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) .

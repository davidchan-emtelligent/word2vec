background as the number of young patients receiving total hip arthroplasty increases , bone - saving implantations facilitating possible future revision , such as the cut femoral neck prosthesis , are gaining importance .
there have been few medium - term results reported for this prosthesis , however , and its migration pattern has not been analyzed .
patients and methods 39 consecutive cut femoral neck prostheses were implanted in 32 patients , mean age 37 ( 17 - 58 ) years , with symptomatic osteoarthritis and either less than 55 years of age or with an anatomic anomaly preventing implantation of a diaphyseal stem ( n = 1 ) .
patients were followed prospectively using routine clinical examination and radiostereometric analysis ( rsa ) at 6 , 12 , 26 , and 52 weeks postoperatively and annually thereafter .
this study evaluated the 5 - year follow - up results .
results the mean harris hip score increased from 26 ( 3 - 51 ) points preoperatively to 84 ( 66 - 98 ) , 86 ( 55 - 98 ) , and 87 ( 47 - 98 ) points at 3 , 12 , and 60 months .
3 stems were revised : 1 after luxation following excessive subsidence due to an undersized component and 2 due to persistent strong thigh pain .
5 - year survival was 95 % ( 95 % ci : 87 - 100 ) .
initial migration varied widely in magnitude ; median total tip migration was 0.42 mm ( 0.09 - 9.4 ) at 6 weeks , 0.92 mm ( 0.18 - 5.9 ) at 1 year , and 1.10 mm ( 0.13 - 6.4 ) at 5 years .
even after high initial migration , stabilization was achieved in 31 of the 35 rsa - evaluable implants .
3 prostheses showed progressive continuous migration throughout the entire follow - up period , and were considered to be loose , suggesting reduced long - term survival .
interpretation currently , we cannot recommend the cut femoral neck prosthesis as a routine treatment option in ( young ) patients requiring tha .
the cut prosthesis may not reach the 90 % survival benchmark at 10 years , and the prosthesis is difficult to implant .
if initial stabilization is achieved , however , aseptic loosening is unlikely .
a good clinical outcome was seen in the surviving prostheses .
we will continue to follow this patient group .
as both the number of young patients receiving total hip arthroplasty and the current life expectancy are increasing , the frequency of revision surgery is also expected to increase ( walker et al. 2005 , huo et al. 2008 ) .
to maximize the potential for successful possible future revision , several prostheses that require only minor bone loss for implantation have been developed ( morrey 1989 , walker et al. 2005 , rohrl et al. 2006 ) .
one of these prostheses is the femoral neck prosthesis cut ( eska implants , lubeck , germany ) ( thomas et al. 1999 , 2004 ) .
the cut prosthesis allows cementless metaphyseal fixation of the femoral component .
only the femoral head is resected , and the femoral neck is retained to support the implant .
mechanical and experimental studies of the cut prosthesis showed a favorable strain distribution with prevention of the strain decrease and subsequent bone resorption in the proximal femur commonly seen with diaphyseal stems ( koebke et al. 2000 , specht et al. 2003 , decking et al. 2006 , 2008 ) .
only short and medium - term clinical results of the cut prosthesis have been published ( thomas et al. 2004 , ender et al. 2007 , rudert et al. 2007 , ishaque et al. 2009 , steens et al. 2010 ) .
in these reports , the reported medium - term survival varied from 50 % to 98 % .
this was mainly due to varying revision rates for aseptic loosening , which accounted for the majority of failures .
using radiostereometric analysis ( rsa ) , migration - - and therefore fixation - - of prostheses can be assessed with high accuracy .
excessive early migration of implants is associated with long - term aseptic loosening , and rsa is a suitable tool for early evaluation of long - term implant performance ( karrholm et al. 1994 , ryd et al. 1995 , hauptfleisch et al. 2006 , nelissen et al. 2011 ) .
in this paper we report the 5 - year clinical and rsa follow - up results of 39 consecutive cut prostheses implanted for symptomatic osteoarthritis in a young patient population .
we evaluated prosthesis survival , estimated the rate of aseptic loosening as determined by rsa , and assessed the influence of implant positioning on migration .
patients and methods between july 2002 and february 2007 , 39 consecutive cut prostheses were implanted in 32 consecutive patients ( 12 male , 20 female ; 7 bilateral ) for symptomatic osteoarthritis who were either less than 55 years of age or had an anatomical anomaly preventing implantation of a regular diaphyseal stem .
mean age was 37 ( 17 - 58 ) years .
the preoperative diagnosis in the patients younger than 55 years was primary osteoarthritis in 9 hips and secondary osteoarthritis in 29 hips .
osteoarthritis was secondary to osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( 9 ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( 6 ) , juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( 5 ) , developmental dysplasia ( 4 ) , morbus morquio ( 2 ) , epiphysiolysis ( 1 ) , septic monoarthritis ( 1 ) and monoarthritis of unknown cause ( 1 ) .
in 1 patient , the anatomical appearance necessitated placement of this short - stemmed prosthesis : a 58 - year - old woman with osteoarthritis secondary to congenital arthrogryposis multiplex who had a fork - deformed femur .
the cut prosthesis is made of a cocrmo alloy .
the femoral component consists of a body and a modular conus with various angles and lengths in order to restore leg length and offset .
the surface of the prosthesis has a macroporous spongious metal surface structure to facilitate bone ingrowth .
2 experienced orthopedic surgeons ( rghhn and hjo ) operated on the patients using a lateral approach in the lateral decubital position .
the senior author learned the technique from one of the prosthesis designers .
in 37 cases , the cut prostheses was combined with the standard press - fit cup ( eska implants , lubeck , germany ) and in 2 cases it was combined with a press - fit mallory head cup ( biomet , warsaw , in ) .
in all cases , a polyethylene liner was combined with a ceramic head .
for rsa analysis , 6 - 10 1 - mm tantalum balls ( industrial tectonics , ann arbor , mi ) were inserted into the proximal femur during surgery .
furthermore , the implant manufacturer attached 1 marker at the distal tip of the hook - shaped end of the prosthesis ( figure 1 ) .
attachment of additional markers to the prosthesis without fundamentally altering the design of the prosthesis was attempted , but proved unsuccessful .
also , usage of the femoral head as an additional prosthesis marker , which is common in rsa of femoral components , was not feasible due overprojection of the metal - backed acetabular component .
thus , only translations of the tip could be determined .
the first rsa radiographs were taken in the first postoperative week before ambulation ( median 4 ( 1 - 7 ) days postoperatively ) .
the patients were allowed minimal weight bearing using 2 crutches in the first 3 postoperative weeks , partial weight bearing using 1 crutch during the next 3 postoperative weeks , and full weight bearing thereafter .

note the rsa marker at the distal tip of the prosthesis .
patients were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks , 3 months , 6 months , 1 year , and annually thereafter .
at each evaluation , the harris hip score and rsa radiographs were obtained .
conventional anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were obtained at 6 weeks , 1 year , 2 years and 5 years of follow - up. none of the patients were lost to follow - up , but 1 patient was unable to attend the most recent follow - up due to pregnancy .
mean length of follow - up was 7.0 ( 4.8 - 9.5 ) years .
37 5years prostheses had at least 5 years of follow - up. marker - based rsa measurements were performed ( mb - rsa software ; medis specials , leiden , the netherlands ) ( kaptein et al. 2003 ) .
the first rsa examination served as the reference for all further examinations ; all evaluations are related to the position of the prosthesis relative to the bone at that time .
migration is expressed along the longitudinal , transverse , and sagittal axes .
accuracy of individual rsa measurements was given by the limits of the 95 % prediction interval of the accuracy of zero motion ( valstar et al .
2005 ) , calculated as 1.96sqrt ( sumd2 / 2n ) ( ranstam et al .
2000 ) using 25 double examinations obtained at 1 - year follow - up. individual measurement accuracy was +/ - 0.08mm for medial - lateral translation , +/ - 0.08 mm for cranial - caudal translation , +/ - 0.22 mm for anterior - posterior translation , and +/ - 0.25 mm for total translation .
in 3 of 39 prostheses , there were insufficient or incorrectly placed rsa markers and these patients were unsuitable for rsa analysis .
in addition , 1 patient refused further rsa examinations after the 6 - week postoperative rsa radiograph and this patient was excluded from migration analysis .
in these 4 patients , routine clinical and radiographic follow - up was performed .
thus , rsa follow - up was complete in 35 of 39 prostheses .
for all examinations , the rigid body error was below 0.35 and the condition number was below 56 ; these values satisfy the marker stability and distribution criteria according to the rsa guidelines of valstar et al .
( 2005 ) .
no examinations had to be excluded .
preoperative offset and caput collum diaphyseal angle ( ccd angle ) were measured on conventional preoperative pelvic radiographs .
on conventional postoperative pelvic radiographs , the amount of femoral neck resection ( no femoral neck engagement , less than 50 % resection , or more than 50 % resection ) , alignment of the stem , postoperative offset and ccd angle , distance of the proximal stem to the medial femoral cortex , and distance of the distal stem to the lateral femoral cortex were determined .
the presence of radiolucent lines and stress shielding was assessed in 5 zones around the stem ( figure 2 ) .

informed consent from the patients and approval of the institutional review board were obtained for the study .
statistics values are reported as mean ( sd ) and range , or as median ( range ) .
estimates are reported as mean with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
the kaplan - meier method was used to estimate survival of the prostheses .
initial ( 0 - 2 years ) and steady - state (>= 2 years ) migration were analyzed using a linear mixed model with random slope and random intercept , which accounts for the repeated measurements of migration over time and the correlation of these measurements in patients .
variables in the analysis were : days to the first postoperative rsa examination , alignment of the stem , postoperative ccd angle , change in ccd angle and offset , categorized distance ( 0 - 2 , 2 - 4 , 4 - 6 , > 6 mm ) to the medial and lateral cortex , the amount of femoral neck resection , and the occurrence of stress shielding ( steady - state migration only ) .
any p - value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
we used spss statistical software version 17.0 .
results clinical results the mean harris hip score increased from 26 ( sd 16 , range : 3 - 51 ) points preoperatively to 84 ( sd 8.4 , 66 - 98 ) points at 3 months , 86 ( sd 12 , 55 - 98 ) points at 1 year , and 88 ( sd 14 , 47 - 98 ) points at 5 years ( p < 0.001 ) .
34 of 39 thas had a good or very good result ( with a mean score during 1 - 5 years of between 81 and 100 points ) .
the mean preoperative ccd angle was 138degrees ( sd 7.9 , 117 - 154 ) .
the mean preoperative offset was 35 ( sd 11 , 10 - 65 ) mm. postoperatively , the mean ccd angle was 138degrees ( sd 7.7 , 119 - 153 ) and the mean offset was 35 ( sd 8.1 , 16 - 59 ) mm. the mean inclination angle of the stem was 151degrees ( sd 8 , 136 - 167 ) .
mean distance from the medial cortex and lateral cortex was 2.8 mm ( sd 1.5 , 0 - 6 ) and 1.8 mm ( sd 1.9 , 0 - 8 ) , respectively .
the femoral neck was correctly resected in 32 prostheses ( no engagement in 12 prostheses , less than 50 % engagement in 19 prostheses , and more than 50 % engagement in 8 prostheses ) .
during follow - up , radiolucent lines < 1 mm were noted in zone 1 in 2 prostheses and in zone 4 in 2 prostheses .
in 1 prosthesis , a radiolucent line of 1 - 2 mm was present in zones 1 and 4 , and in 1 prosthesis a radiolucent line of > 2 mm was present in zone 1 and one of 1 - 2 mm was present in zone 4 .
in another prosthesis , a radiolucent line of > 2 mm was present in both zone 1 and zone 4 .
stress shielding was noted in zone 5 in 5 patients .
during follow - up , 3 stems were revised at 43 days , 4.8 years , and 5.8 years postoperatively for various reasons ( table 1 ) .
no stems were revised for aseptic loosening .
the 5 - year survival was 95 % ( 95 % ci : 87 - 100 ) ( figure 3 ) .

rsa results the initial migration varied widely in magnitude between different prostheses ( figure 4 ) .
the median total tip migration , i.e. the vector length , was 0.42 ( 0.09 - 9.36 ) mm at 6 weeks , 0.92 ( 0.18 - 5.94 ) mm at 1 year , and 0.89 ( 0.13 - 6.39 ) mm at 5 years .
the overall initial migration pattern of the tip was composed of subsidence and lateralization ( table 2 ) .
migration of more than 1 mm in the medial - lateral direction was measured for 13 prostheses ( all 13 lateral ) , over 1 mm in the cranial - caudal direction for 8 prostheses ( all 8 subsidence ) , and over 1 mm in the anterior - posterior direction for 8 prostheses ( 3 anterior , 5 posterior ) ( figure 5 ) .

total tip migration of 35 cut prostheses .
represented are : 3 failures ( solid red lines ) , 3 prostheses showing continuous excessive migration ( dashed red lines ) , 29 stable unrevised prostheses ( solid black lines ) , and 1 cut prosthesis of larger size implanted in revision case 1 ( dashed black line ; see table 1 for details ) .

medial - lateral ( upper ) , cranial - caudal ( middle ) , and anterior - posterior ( lower ) tip translation of the 35 cut prostheses .
for the 29 stable , unrevised prostheses , the mean translation with range ( bars ) is shown for those prostheses with translation below 1 mm ; stable , unrevised prostheses with translation higher than 1 mm are shown as individual ( solid black ) lines .
also shown are 3 failures ( solid red lines ) , 3 prostheses showing continuous excessive migration ( dashed red lines ) , and 1 cut prosthesis of larger size implanted in revision case 1 ( dashed black line ) .
based on the total tip migration , 1 prosthesis showed rapid initial migration without any tendency to stabilize ( figure 4 , revision 1 ) .
3 additional prostheses in 3 patients showed continuous excessive migration , i.e. migration over the detection threshold of 0.25 mm on more than 1 occasion and continuing after 2 years of follow - up ( figure 4 ) .
these prostheses also showed the highest progressive migration rate in the medial - lateral direction ( figure 5 ) .
these 3 prostheses were considered to be loose .
furthermore , radiolucent zones in both zone 1 and zone 4 were present only in these 3 prostheses .
this radiolucency in combination with the measured migration is consistent with progressive varisation of the prosthesis .
when these 3 prostheses were considered to be additional failures , the 5 - year survival for the combined endpoint revision and ( radiographic ) loosening was 86 % ( 95 % ci : 74 - 98 ) .
it is noteworthy that these 3 prostheses already showed the highest total tip migration rate 6 months postoperatively , and that this remained the case throughout the entire 5 years of follow - up. also , tip migration higher than 1 mm between 6 months and 2 years postoperatively was measured in these cases only : 2.28 , 1.74 , and 1.16 mm in these cases as opposed to migration below 0.89 mm for the stable prostheses ( mean 0.27 , range : 0.01 - 0.89 ) .
distance between the prosthesis and the proximal medial cortex and stem alignment were associated with the initial amount of medial - lateral migration of the tip ( - 0.76 mm per 2 mm distance , 95 % ci : - 1.26 to - 0.26 ( p = 0.005 ) and 0.06 mm per degree , 95 % ci : 0.03 - 0.11 ( p = 0.04 )) .
distance between the prosthesis and the lateral cortex was associated with initial longitudinal migration ( 0.52 mm per 2 mm distance , 95 % ci : 0.02 - 1.02 ( p = 0.04 )) .
no factors were found to be associated with initial migration in the anterior - posterior direction .
also , no factors were found to be associated with the ( continuous ) steady - state migration in any of the 3 directions .
discussion in this study , we analyzed the medium - term clinical and rsa results of 39 consecutive cut femoral neck prostheses implanted for symptomatic osteoarthritis in young patients with heterogeneous and even rare underlying pathologies .
34 of 39 thas had a good clinical outcome .
3 of the 39 prostheses were revised : 1 prosthesis was revised because of dislocation following excessive subsidence due to usage of an undersized component and 2 prostheses , which were both firmly fixed , were revised due to severe , persistent thigh pain .
severe persistent pain of the operated hip as a reason for revision is not uncommon after implantation of a cut prosthesis , and has been reported by several authors ( ender et al. 2007 , ishaque et al. 2009 , steens et al. 2010 ) .
as such , it may be a characteristic of this particular prosthesis .
using rsa , 3 additional prostheses were found to show continuous , excessive migration during the entire follow - up period and these prostheses were considered to be loose .
only these 3 prostheses showed radiolucent lines in zones 1 and 4 , and the excessive continuous migration was mainly in the medial - lateral direction , which is compatible with the reported failure mode of the prosthesis - - of increased horizontal migration and varisation ( ender et al. 2007 , ishaque et al. 2009 , steens et al. 2010 ) .
unfortunately , no factors could be related to loosening : no excessive ( medial ) bone resorption was present and no gross abnormalities , regarding for example stem alignment or the amount of femoral neck resection , were noted .
however , so far , revision has not been required for these 3 prostheses .
the other 31 rsa - evaluable prostheses stabilized within the first preoperative year .
several authors have reported medium - term survival of the cut prosthesis ( table 3 ) ( thomas et al. 2004 , ender et al. 2007 , rudert et al. 2007 , ishaque et al. 2009 , steens et al. 2010 ) .
our 5 - year survival rate of 95 % is in agreement with these reported rates .
in these reports , aseptic loosening was the main reason for revision but its incidence varied considerably .
this may be due to the different assessment times , variation in the decision about when to perform revision surgery , or difficulty in establishment of the diagnosis of aseptic loosing .
using rsa , the rate of aseptic loosening of implants can be established with a high degree of certainty .
we identified 3 additional prostheses that were aseptically loose , and revision surgery may be necessary within the next 5 years .
if so , the 10 - year survival may be at best 83 % .
management of young patients requiring tha is difficult .
survival of conventional ( uncemented diaphyseal ) tha is generally lower than tha in the elderly , with 10 - year survival of 88.5 - 91.0 % in patients younger than 60 years reported by the nordic arthroplasty registries ( eskelinen et al. 2005 , havelin et al. 2009 ) .
the results of resurfacing tha , often advocated for these patients , may be substantially inferior to those of diaphyseal tha ( duijsens et al. 2005 , springer et al. 2009 , johanson et al. 2010 , simpson and villar 2010 ) .
a femoral neck prosthesis provides an alternative treatment option and has , like resurfacing tha , the potential to function as an intermediate step towards eventual placement of a diaphyseal tha .
minimal bone loss is required for implantation and , in the case of the cut femoral neck prosthesis , the subsequent favorable strain distribution and prevention of proximal femoral stress shielding after implantation facilitate possible future revision tha .
medium - term survival of the cut femoral neck prosthesis is satisfactory in these young patients and comparable to that of other femoral neck thas ( zelle et al. 2004 , stukenborg 2007 , corner et al. 2008 ) .
our results do , however , suggest that the expected long - term survival of the cut femoral neck prosthesis in these young patients may not reach the nice - benchmark survival of 90 % at 10 years ( national institute of clinical excellence ( nice ) 2003 ) .
furthermore , as noted by us and others ( ender et al. 2007 , ishaque et al. 2009 , steens et al .
2010 ) , implantation of the cut femoral neck prosthesis is a demanding procedure - - even for skilled surgeons familiar with its implantation technique .
thus , at the moment , we cannot recommend the cut femoral neck prosthesis as a routine treatment option in ( young ) patients requiring tha , and we should await the results of longer follow - up. the present study demonstrates the feasibility of rsa - measured migration for assessment of performance of femoral neck prostheses at short - term follow - up. all 3 migrating prostheses that were found to be loose showed a distinctively high migration rate incompatible with stabilization between 6 months and 2 years of follow - up. thus , these prostheses would also be indicated to have a high risk of future revision due to aseptic loosening at short - term follow - up , and analysis of the 2 - year migration results would have led to similar conclusions regarding the expected numbers at risk of future revision due to aseptic loosening .
this expected rate of aseptic loosening is certainly high enough to defer widespread introduction until the results of longer - term follow - up become available .
it is interesting to note that in case of the cut femoral neck prosthesis , the magnitude of the initial migration cannot be considered to be the only predictive measure to assess fixation .
this contrasts with common practice in rsa research , which is based on the findings for diaphyseal stems ( karrholm et al. 1994 , hauptfleisch et al .
2006 ) and tibial components for total knee arthroplasty ( ryd et al. 1995 ) .
we found that large initial migration in either 1 of the 3 orthogonal directions could be compatible with subsequent stabilization of the prosthesis in that direction , but that a high migration rate during the first 2 years was indicative of failure of the implant to stabilize .
this indicates that in terms of interpretation of rsa results with respect to possible future failure of an implant , it is not only the magnitude of the initial migration that should be assessed but also whether a plateau phase with stabilization of the implant has been reached .
it is recommended that the cut prosthesis should have contact with both the medial and lateral femoral cortex ( rudert et al. 2007 ) .
although a suboptimal position of the prosthesis was associated with increased initial migration , this did not influence subsequent stabilization of the prosthesis and a certain degree of suboptimal positioning appears to be tolerated .
unfortunately , we were unable to identify factors associated with continuous , excessive migration .
the fact that implant migration was measured using only 1 marker on the prosthesis tip was a limitation of our study : rotation of the prosthesis could not be measured .
more specifically , although not necessarily disadvantageous , it is the movement of the prosthesis tip that is measured and not the movement of the ( gravitational ) center of the prosthesis .
if the prosthesis migrates ( rotates ) around this tip marker , no migration is measured - - although the prosthesis actually does migrate .
however , this scenario is unlikely since the marker is located at the tip of the hook - shaped distal end , which is very unlikely to function as the ( instantaneous ) center of rotation of the prosthesis at any time .
another limitation of the study was the small study group and the absence of a formal power analysis , even though the sample was large enough for meaningful assessment of migration and survivorship .
in conclusion , at the moment we cannot recommend the cut femoral neck prosthesis as a routine treatment option in ( young ) patients requiring tha .
the cut prosthesis may not reach the 90 % survival benchmark at 10 years , and the prosthesis is difficult to implant .
if initial stabilization is achieved , however , aseptic loosening is unlikely and a good clinical outcome is seen in the surviving prostheses .
we will continue to follow this patient group .

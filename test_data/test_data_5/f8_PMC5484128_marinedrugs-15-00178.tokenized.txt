the protective effects of a chondroitin sulfate - rich extract ( cse ) from skate cartilage against lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) - induced hepatic damage were investigated , and its mechanism of action was compared with that of chondroitin sulfate ( cs ) from shark cartilage .
icr mice were orally administrated 200 mg / kg body weight ( bw ) of cs or 400 mg / kg bw of cse for 3 consecutive days , followed by a one - time intraperitoneal injection of lps ( 20 mg / kg bw ) .
the experimental groups were vehicle treatment without lps injection ( nc group ) , vehicle treatment with lps injection ( lps group ) , cs pretreatment with lps injection ( cs group ) , and cse pretreatment with lps injection ( cse group ) .
hepatic antioxidant enzyme expression levels in the cs and cse groups were increased relative to those in the lps group .
in lps - insulted hepatic tissue , inflammatory factors were augmented relative to those in the nc group , but were significantly suppressed by pretreatment with cs or cse .
moreover , cs and cse alleviated the lps - induced apoptotic factors and mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) .
in addition , cs and cse effectively decreased the serum lipid concentrations and downregulated hepatic sterol regulatory element - binding proteins expression .
in conclusion , the skate cse could protect against lps - induced hepatic dyslipidemia , oxidative stress , inflammation , and apoptosis , probably through the regulation of mapk signaling .

introduction chondroitin sulfate ( cs ) is a glycosaminoglycan that is present in the extracellular matrix of animal tissue , especially in cartilages , skin , blood vessels , ligaments , and tendons , where it forms an essential component of proteoglycans ( figure 1 ) [ 1,2 ] .
cs plays an important role in the elasticity and function of articular cartilage .
in addition to these structural properties , cs exhibits a wide variety of biological functions due mainly to the presence of rare oversulfated building units in its domain structure that interact specifically with other molecules [ 3 ] .
cs is currently recommended by the european league against rheumatism as a sysadoa ( symptomatic slow - acting drug for osteoarthritis ) in the treatment of knee and hand osteoarthritis , based on research evidence and meta - analysis of numerous clinical studies [ 4 ] .
the anti - inflammatory activity of cs has been suggested as a major function in the cellular system and human studies [ 5 ] .
consequently , the beneficial effects of cs have been recognized in chronic inflammatory diseases , such as atherosclerosis [ 6 ] , inflammatory bowel disease [ 7 ] , and psoriasis [ 8 ] .
the liver is a major metabolic organ and plays a critical role in the defense of the body against bacteria and bacterial products , including lipopolysaccharides ( lpss ) [ 9 ] .
impaired hepatic function , typically leading to hepatic encephalopathy and hydroperitoneum , is a common feature of the acute liver failure induced by lps [ 10 ] .
lps stimulates kupffer cells , the resident macrophages of the liver , to release toxic mediators , such as tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , interleukins ( ils ) , platelet - activating factors , reactive oxygen species , and nitrogen species [ 11 ] .
these proinflammatory mediators as well as the oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by lps lead to hepatocyte death , which subsequently causes liver failure [ 12 ] .
members of the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) family , including p38 kinase , c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) , and extracellular signal regulated kinase ( erk ) , serve to regulate diverse cellular responses to extracellular stimuli , and modulate various cellular activities , including gene expression , mitosis , differentiation , and cell survival / apoptosis [ 13 ]. with regard to the regulation of mapks , it is well known that nuclear factor - kappab ( nf - kappab ) is a transcription factor involved in the expression of tnf - alpha and il - 1 [ 14 ] .
the mapk cascade plays a pivotal role in hepatocyte apoptosis and is considered to be an attractive therapeutic target .
therefore , an insight into the regulation of signaling pathways by mapks and nf - kappab / activator protein - 1 is indispensable for the future development of therapies to inhibit inflammation and apoptosis in acute liver injury .
the common skate ( raja kenojei ) is a benthic animal living in the deep sea .
because only the meat portion is usually consumed , this organism yields approximately 30 % of its weight in byproducts , consisting mostly of skin , bone and cartilage .
these leftover products are a rich source of cs [ 15 ] .
on the market , cs for drug purposes is produced from various sources , including cattle , pigs , chicken , or cartilaginous fish such as sharks [ 16 ] .
in this study , the protective effects of the cs - rich extract ( cse ) of skate cartilage against lps - induced oxidative stress , inflammation , and apoptosis were studied , and its mechanism of action was compared with that of cs of shark cartilage origin .
the mouse lps - induced hepatic injury model used is a practical tool for the evaluation of nutraceutical or bioactive compounds that interfere with hepatic apoptosis and inflammatory liver injury .
2. results 2.1 .
effects of skate cse on lps - induced decrease in body and liver weights as shown in table 1 , the final body weight of mice determined at 24 h after intraperitoneal lps injection was significantly decreased in the lps group compared to that in the nc group , although the initial body weights among all the experimental groups ( 37.7 - 38.0 g ) were similar .
there were significantly less body weight changes during 3 days in the cs and cse groups than in the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
lps treatment also significantly decreased the liver weight in the lps group relative to that in the nc group , whereas cs and cse treatments effectively protected against the reduction of liver weight ( table 1 ) .
2.2 .
effects of skate cse on lps - induced peroxynitrite radical production , serum lipids , and hepatic function parameters as depicted in table 2 , the serum peroxynitrite ( onoo - ) levels were 148.8 % higher in the lps group than in the nc group , whereas cs and cse administration effectively decreased the levels by 30.6 % and 29.8 % , respectively , relative to that of the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
serum concentrations of triglyceride and total cholesterol were significantly increased by the lps injection ( table 2 ) .
in the cs and cse groups , the serum triglyceride concentration was reduced by 35.7 % and 47.0 % , respectively , relative to that in the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
a significant decrease in the total cholesterol concentration was observed in both the cs and cse groups ( 21.7 % and 25.6 % , respectively ) compared with that in the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
lps triggered a considerable increase in the alanine transaminase ( alt ) and aspartate transaminase ( ast ) activities ( figure 2 ) .
however , compared with the levels in the lps group , the alt levels were 45.2 % and 41.1 % lower ( p < 0.05 ) and the ast levels 52.9 and 48.9 % lower ( p < 0.05 ) in the cs and cse groups , respectively .
2.3 .
effects of skate cse on the protein expression of antioxidant enzymes in lps - induced hepatic tissue to determine the effects of cs and cse on antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , catalase , and glutathione peroxidase ( gpx ) , western blot analysis was used to detect the hepatic protein levels in lps - treated mice .
except for sod , the protein expression levels of antioxidant enzymes were significantly downregulated at 24 h after lps injection ( figure 3 ) .
as expected , pretreatment with cs or cse markedly elevated the expression of catalase and gpx in the lps - treated hepatic tissue , whereas that of gpx was increased by 18 % and 21 % in the cs and cse groups , respectively , relative to the lps group levels ( p < 0.05 ) .
the augmentation of catalase and gpx expression by cs was higher than that by cse .
2.4 .
effects of skate cse on the protein expression of proinflammatory factors in lps - induced hepatic tissue the effects of cs and cse on lps - induced changes in the hepatic proinflammatory tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , cyclooxygenase ( cox ) - 2 , and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) proteins are shown in figure 4 .
the lps group showed a significant increase in expression of hepatic proinflammatory factors .
on the other hand , the tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , cox - 2 , and inos expression levels of the cs group were significantly lower ( by 38.2 % , 19.4 % , 42.5 % , and 27.8 % , respectively ) than those of the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
the tnf - alpha , cox - 2 , and inos expression levels of the cse group were also significantly lower ( by 29.4 % , 37.9 % , and 21.8 % , respectively ) than those of the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
2.5 .
effects of skate cse on the protein expression of anti - and pro - apoptotic mediators in lps - induced hepatic tissue lps stimulated the hepatic apoptosis pathway in the mice , resulting in decreased anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 and survivin levels , and increased pro - apoptotic bax and cytochrome c expression , compared with those of the nc group ( figure 5 ) .
the expression levels of bax in the cs and cse groups were reduced by 32.9 % and 24.4 % , respectively , compared with that in the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas the cytochrome c protein expression levels were decreased significantly by 30.0 % and 16.0 % , respectively .
there was no significant difference in the expression of survivin among experimental groups .
2.6 .
effects of skate cse on the protein expression of cell signaling transduction - related factors in lps - induced hepatic tissue several important mechanisms of cell regulation involve signal transduction via mapks .
to understand the signaling mechanisms of lps - induced expression of hepatic inflammatory factors ( tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , cox - 2 , and inos ) , we determined the activation patterns for p38 , erk1 / 2 , and c - fos .
lps upregulated the phosphorylated forms ( i.e. , activated forms ) of p38 , erk1 / 2 , and c - fos ( figure 6 ) , but these effects were attenuated by the cs or cse pretreatments .
the p - p38 , p - erk , and c - fos expression levels in the cs group were decreased by 43.6 % , 24.0 % , and 54.2 % , respectively , and those in the cse group by 39.1 % , 16.0 % , and 42.7 % , respectively , compared with the levels in the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
2.7 .
effects of skate cse on the protein expression of lipid metabolism - related transcription factors in lps - induced hepatic tissue to investigate the effect of lps treatment on lipid metabolism in the liver , the levels of hepatic nuclear transcription factors such as sterol regulatory element - binding protein ( srebp ) - 1 and srebp - 2 were determined by western blot analysis .
lps treatment significantly increased the protein expression of srebp - 1 and srebp - 2 , but this effect was attenuated by cs or cse administration ( figure 7 ) .
srebp - 1 expression in the cs group was 20.8 % lower than that in the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
in the cse group , the srebp - 1 and srebp - 2 expression levels were 25.0 % and 33.1 % lower , respectively , than those in the lps group ( p < 0.05 ) .
3. discussion in the present study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of skate cses on proinflammatory and apoptotic mediators , and explored the possible mechanism of action of the compound in the liver of lps - injected mice .
lps , a bacterial endotoxin , causes serious damage in critical organs , such as the liver [ 17 ] .
we found that cse could protect mice against lps - induced hepatic damage by decreasing oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine and apoptotic marker expression , with concomitant upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and downregulation of the mapk - dependent signaling pathway .
moreover , cse attenuated lps - induced hyperlipidemia by downregulating hepatic srebps levels .
these beneficial effects of cse were comparable to those of cs. under normal conditions , alt is located in the cytoplasm , and ast is present in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of the liver .
when the structure of the liver is damaged , alt and ast are released into the circulatory system , resulting in increased activities in the blood [ 18 ] .
in this study , cse significantly alleviated the increased activity of ast and alt mediated by lps , revealing that skate cs has a preventative effect against lps - induced liver damage .
oxidative stress elevation is a common pathophysiological state observed in lps - induced hepatic injury .
thus , augmentation of the antioxidant defense system in the body becomes necessary during infections , because redox imbalance is caused by the depletion of endogenous antioxidants , such as the antioxidant enzymes , and alteration of the glutathione redox status [ 19 ] .
numerous studies have tried to find new nutraceutical products with antioxidant and anti - inflammatory properties from natural sources , including plants or marine materials , to reverse and / or prevent hepatotoxicity [ 20,21,22 ] .
cs demonstrated protective effects against ccl4 - induced hepatotoxicity , attributed to its free radical - scavenging activity [ 23 ] .
in addition , treatment with cs restored the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the liver of ccl4 - injected [ 24 ] and ovariectomized rats [ 25 ] .
these results are in line with those of our study .
in the current study , the single injection of lps elevated oxidative stress in the mice , whereupon the serum onoo - level increased but hepatic antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and gpx were significantly downregulated .
cse or cs administration to the mice prior to lps treatment was able to significantly inhibit onoo - production and upregulate gpx .
in response to lps , proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes are induced through nf - kappab activation in the kupffer cells , which are liver - resident macrophages [ 26 ] .
overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines has a detrimental effect , provoking an inflammatory reaction [ 27 ] that is dominated by the proinflammatory enzymes cox - 2 and inos .
elevated inflammation in the liver causes liver damage [ 28 ] .
therefore , any substance that can attenuate the production of the proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes would be beneficial for delaying the progression of inflammation .
in the present study , both cse and cs were able to decrease the lps - induced hepatic inflammation in the mice via downregulation of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , cox - 2 , and inos .
it is apparent that cse , like cs , has regulatory effects on the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines and enzymes .
cell survival is enhanced under the conditions of high bcl - 2 and low bax expression .
previous studies have shown that lps upregulates the pro - apoptotic bax and downregulates the anti - apoptotic bcl - 2 levels [ 29 ] .
however , cs pretreatment significantly attenuated 6 - hydroxydopamine - induced apoptotic signals , including imbalance of the bcl - 2 / bax ratio , release of cytochrome c , and activation of caspase - 9 and caspase - 3 in a human neuroblastoma cell line [ 30 ] .
our current study has demonstrated that cse , like cs , inhibits the lps - induced increase of bax and decrease of bcl - 2 expression in the liver of mice .
moreover , cse and cs diminished the lps - induced elevation of cytochrome c release , which is in line with previous findings [ 30,31 ] .
cs could exert its anti - apoptotic effect by mitigating lps - induced mitochondrial dysfunction .
to gain insight into the mechanism by which cse or cs inhibits inflammation and apoptosis in the lps - insulted liver of mice , we investigated mapk signaling in the tissue .
numerous studies have shown that all mapks are activated by lps [ 32,33,34 ] .
the mapks ( viz. , p38 kinase , jnk , and erk ) react to extracellular stimuli and control a variety of cellular activities , including gene expression , mitosis , differentiation , and apoptosis [ 35 ] .
in this study , we focused on mapks because they have been implicated in lps - induced inflammation and apoptosis .
we found that cse and cs inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 and erk .
in il - 1beta - stimulated cultured rabbit chondrocytes , cs decreased the il - 1beta - induced phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 and abrogated p38 mapk phosphorylation [ 35 ] .
the results from our study and other researchers suggest that inhibition of the phosphorylation of mapks by cse or cs may contribute to the anti - inflammatory and anti - apoptotic effects in the liver of lps - induced mice .
hyperlipidemia frequently accompanies infectious and inflammatory diseases [ 36 ] .
several reports have demonstrated that lps promotes hyperlipidemia via srebp activation [ 37 ] .
in this study , cse and cs significantly reduced serum lipid levels as well as hepatic srebp protein expression , which are in accordance with other reports [ 38 ] .
cs reduced the serum triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in high - fat diet - fed rats [ 39 ] .
our results suggest that both cse and cs could effectively ameliorate lps - induced hyperlipidemia , likely through the inhibition of hepatic lipid synthesis , which is regulated by the nuclear transcription factor srebp. from im et al .
[ 40 ] , the disaccharide composition of the cs obtained from skate cartilage is very similar to that from shark cartilage .
mammalian cs is generally composed of monosulfated disaccharides , such as deltadi - 4s ( cs a ) and deltadi - 6s ( cs c ) , whereas marine cs contains oversulfated disaccharides , including deltadi - 2,6dis ( cs d , shark cartilage ) , deltadi - 4,6dis ( cs e , squid , salmon ) , and deltadi - 3,4dis ( cs k , king crab ) [ 41,42,43 ] .
although many commercial suppliers have obtained cs from mammalian species , which are more cost - effective than marine sources , there is increasing concern about the risk of animal epidemics , including bovine spongiform encephalopathy , foot - and - mouth disease , and bird influenzas .
in addition , because of the restricted killing of sharks and high price of the raw material , cs from shark cartilage has a limited availability .
thus , the development of cs from the byproducts of other marine species , such as skate , is needed .
in the present study , the liver - protecting effects of skate cse were comparable to those of shark cs. therefore , skate cartilage would be a good and readily available source for the development of cs for the functional food market .
4. materials and methods 4.1 .
chondroitin sulfate - rich extract of skate cartilage the cse was kindly provided by our collaborator ( yeongsan skate co. , ltd. , busan , korea ) .

the animals were maintained under a 12 h light / dark cycle , and housed at a controlled temperature ( 24 degreesc ) and humidity ( 55 % +/ - 5 %) .
after 1 - week acclimation , the mice were divided into 4 groups ( n = 8 ) on the basis of their body weights : vehicle pretreatment without lps injection ( nc group ) , vehicle pretreatment with lps injection ( lps group ) , cs pretreatment with lps injection ( cs group ) , and cse pretreatment with lps injection ( cse group ) .
the vehicle - treated nc and lps groups were given distilled water , whereas the cs and cse groups were orally administered 200 mg / kg body weight ( bw ) of cs and 400 mg / kg bw of cse , respectively , via a stomach tube , on a daily basis for 3 consecutive days .
then , the mice were intraperitoneally injected with lps ( 20 mg / kg bw ) .
the dose of cs was based on the previous report of ha and lee [ 23 ] , whereas the dose of cse was calculated from the above - mentioned cs content .
after 24 h of lps injection , blood was drawn from the heart .
the liver was excised after perfusion with ice - cold pbs and kept at - 80 degreesc until analysis .
the animal experimental protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and animal ethics committee of daegu hanny university ( approval no .
dhu2017 - 001 ) and the experiments were performed according to the guidelines for animal experimentation .
4.3 .
measurement of onoo - level in the serum the onoo - level was evaluated using the method of kooy et al .
[ 45 ] , with minor modifications .
serum was added to a rhodamine solution [ 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer , 90 mm nacl , 5 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid , and dihydrorhodamine ( dhr ) 123 ] , and then the fluorescence of rhodamine 123 ( the reduced form of dhr 123 ) was measured at 485 - nm excitation and 535 - nm emission with a fluorescence plate reader at every 5 min for 30 min .
4.4 .
preparation of nuclear and post - nuclear fractions nuclear protein extraction was performed according to the method of komatsu [ 46 ] .
in brief , liver tissues were homogenized with ice - cold lysis buffer containing 5 mm tris - hcl ( ph 7.5 ) , 2 mm mgcl2 , 15 mm cacl2 , and 1.5 m sucrose , and then 0.1 m dithiothreitol ( dtt ) and a protease inhibitor mixture solution were added .
after centrifugation ( 10,500x g for 20 min at 4 degreesc ) , the pellet was suspended in extraction buffer containing 20 mm 2 - [ 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazyl ] ethanesulfonic acid ( ph 7.9 ) , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 0.42 m nacl , 0.2 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid , and 25 % ( v / v ) glycerol , and then 0.1 m dtt and a protease inhibitor mixture solution were added .
the mixture was placed on ice for 30 min .
the nuclear fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the mixture at 20,500x g for 5 min at 4 degreesc .
to obtain the post - nuclear fraction , the liver tissue was homogenized with ice - cold lysis buffer ( ph 7.4 ) containing 137 mm nacl , 20 mm tris - hcl , 1 % tween 20 , 10 % glycerol , 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and a protease inhibitor mixture solution .
the homogenate was then centrifuged at 2000x g for 10 min at 4 degreesc .
the protein concentration in each fraction was determined using a bio - rad protein assay kit ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca , usa ) .
4.5 .
immunoblotting analysis for the determination of c - fos , srebp - 1 , srebp - 2 , and histone , 10 g of protein from each nuclear fraction was electrophoresed on a 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel .
the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , which was then blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) skim milk solution for 1 h and thereafter incubated overnight with primary antibodies to c - fos , srebp - 1 , srebp - 2 , and histone at 4 degreesc .
after the blots had been washed , they were incubated with anti - rabbit or anti - mouse igg horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 20 degreesc .
additionally , 10 - 15 g protein samples of each post - nuclear fraction of sod , catalase , gpx , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , cox - 2 , inos , bcl - 2 , survivin , bax , cytochrome c , p - p38 , p - erk , and beta - actin were electrophoresed by 8 - 15 % sds - page .

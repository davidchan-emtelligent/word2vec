the purpose of this investigation was to assess the balance between the personal and professional lives of trainees and young european specialists in clinical microbiology ( cm ) and infectious diseases ( id ) , and determine differences according to gender , country of training , workplace and specialty .
the steering committee of the trainee association of the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases ( escmid ) devised a questionnaire survey consisting , beyond the demographic questions , of nine yes / no questions , 11 likert scale self - evaluations and one open - response item on parenthood , working conditions , quality of life , alcohol consumption and burnout .
this anonymous survey in english was held between april and july 2015 among european cm / id trainees and young specialists (< 3 years after training completion ) .
responses from 416 participants with a mean age of 32 years [ standard deviation ( sd ) 5 years ] were analysed .
females and physicians from northern / western europe ( nwe ) benefit more from paternity / maternity leaves even during training than their counterparts .
among all respondents , only half of breastfeeding mothers enjoyed the benefit of working hours flexibility .
only two - thirds of respondents found their working environment stimulating .
in comparison to colleagues from other parts of europe , trainees and young specialists from southern / eastern europe ( see ) had less frequent regular meetings with mentors / supervisors and head of departments where trainees' issues are discussed .
also , physicians from see were more frequently victims of workplace mobbing / bullying in comparison to those from other regions .
finally , multivariate analysis showed that female gender , see region and id specialty were associated with burnout feelings .
female gender and country of work from see largely determine satisfactory working conditions , the possibility of parenthood leaves , amount of leisure time , mobbing experiences and burnout feelings among european cm / id trainees and young specialists .

university medical center utrechtissue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh germany 2017 introduction achieving balance between personal and professional life is extremely important for each individual .
physicians are among the most susceptible individuals failing to achieve this balance due to heavy work demands , long working hours , shift work ( including night shifts ) and staff shortages .
imbalance between professional and personal life is a well - known risk factor for work stress and burnout [ 1 , 2 ] .
the consequences of long periods of excessive work under stress conditions and burnout could have serious outcomes for the wellness of individual physicians [ 3 ] .
burnout is a very important predictor in career satisfaction as well .
in addition , it can be one of the core elements underlying the strikingly high prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms ( 28.8 %) among resident physicians [ 4 ] .
as of 2013 , more than 180 reports have documented that physicians are highly dissatisfied with their jobs [ 5 ] .
in the unites states , a recent survey showed that physicians ( from all specialty disciplines ) early in their career had the lowest career satisfaction , greatest rates of work - home conflicts , more difficulty resolving work - home conflicts in a manner that allowed both work and home responsibilities to be met , and greater depersonalisation in comparison to physicians more advanced in their careers [ 6 ] .
to the best of our knowledge , no study has been published in peer - reviewed literature that addresses these important questions among trainees and young specialists in clinical microbiology ( cm ) and infectious diseases ( id ) in europe , whereas surveys with similar aims were conducted among european trainees in other specialties , such as surgical oncology [ 7 ] .
therefore , the trainee association of the european society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases ( tae ) , whose paramount goal is to improve collaboration among trainees and to improve their learning path during residency , devised a questionnaire survey to assess several aspects related both to training and to the balance between personal and professional life ( work - life balance ) .
the results addressing issues such as training satisfaction rate and the adequacy of the training itself are published elsewhere [ 8 ] .
the present paper focuses on different aspects of work - life balance , including parenthood , working conditions , quality of life , activities during leisure time , alcohol consumption and burnout .
materials and methods survey strategy the present study is a survey conceived by the steering committee of the tae on the quality of life ( qol ) perceived during medical postgraduate training across europe .
a pilot phase involving 32 participants from different european countries was conducted in order to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of the questionnaire , leading to the necessary amendments .
the final survey was available online from 26 april to 13 july 2015 , through the open source software lime survey ( lime survey gmbh , hamburg , germany ) addressing several aspects of trainees' qol : work flexibility for physicians becoming parents during training , workplace mobbing experience ( i.e. bullying of an individual by a group ; it concerns repetitive behaviours by peers and superiors that makes the workplace and daily activities of the subject uncomfortable ) , burnout feelings , adequate trainee representation on boards where the policy on training conditions is discussed , presence of a stimulating work environment , activities during free time and alcohol consumption .
the survey was aimed at european trainees and young specialists (< 3 years after training completion ) in cm and id , so as to have a reliable and current overview of the actual conditions of their training .
the survey was promoted during the escmid 's european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases ( eccmid ) annual meeting attracting more than 10,000 participants , on the escmid website , via tae national contact persons and through the escmid members' mailing list .
before starting to fill out the questionnaire survey , every respondent was informed about the purpose of the survey and that anonymity would be ensured .
the general purpose was to determine possible differences across the above - mentioned qol domains according to four variables : gender , country ( not referring to nationality but to the place of training ) , workplace ( university or non - university environment ) and specialty. of note , participation of young physicians from non - european countries was allowed , as escmid membership is not restricted to european countries .
in detail , because of only a small number of entries from the majority of countries , the five geographic categories used regularly by the escmid [ 9 ] have been turned into two , northern / western europe ( nwe , including northern and western europe ) and southern / eastern europe ( see , including southern , south - eastern and south - western europe ) , then adding an all - encompassing category ( eeu , namely extra - europe ) for all the non - european countries ( online supplementary file 1 ) ; regarding the fourth variable , participants have been labelled as trainees / young specialists in id , in cm , in both id / cm ( in a few countries , cm and id exist as a combined specialty ) and in any other field ( another all - encompassing category of physicians neither id nor cm ) .
questionnaire domains the survey included , beyond demographic questions , nine yes / no questions , 11 likert scale self - evaluations and one open - response item on the following topics ( all answers , including the ones from young specialists , are related to the training period ) : socio - demographic information such as gender , country of work , workplace , specialty as previously explained and marital status ; parenthood issues during training , with a subjective assessment of the way the training rules fit with their parental needs ( five - point likert scale , 1 = completely dissatisfied , 5 = completely satisfied ) ; the presence of trainees' representative ( s ) on the board ( s ) wherein training policies are discussed and the regular implementation of meetings of trainees with their mentors and heads of department ; self - assessment of the quality of the training work environment , whether it is stimulating or not ; leisure time , namely favourite activities ( e.g. fitness / sports , family , cinema / theatre , reading / taking courses , other ) and the possibility to perform physical exercise as well as volunteer work ; problems in carrying out daily job - related tasks , consisting of three items ( three - point likert scale , 1 = does not present a problem , 3 = this presents a big problem ) about unfriendly colleagues , too many management commitments , too many working hours , increasing computerisation , low salary and hostile patients ; mobbing experience ( yes / no ) , namely exposure to threats to professional status and to personal standing ( such as motiveless menaces to be downgraded or to be rejected at the final exams ) , isolation and destabilisation [ 10 ] ; burnout ( defined as a pathological syndrome in which emotional depletion and maladaptive detachment occur because of prolonged occupational stress ) , consisting of four items ( five - point likert scale , 1 = never , 5 = very often ) upon how often respondents feel they are achieving less than deserved , frustrated , misunderstood / unappreciated , worn out [ 11 ] ; alcohol consumption , meaning how frequently a glass of alcohol is consumed ( likert scale 0 - 4 , 0 = never , 4 = 4 glasses or more a week ) ; subjective assessment of overall qol , namely the necessity to work during free time to fulfil work demands ( 0 - 4 likert scale , 0 = never , 4 = nearly every day ) , whether the workload fits with social and family commitments ( 0 - 3 likert scale , 0 = not very well , 3 = well ) and whether respondents regret the specialty they have chosen .
statistical analysis the results were collected by promente social research ( sarajevo , bosnia and herzegovina ) , which prepared the database for further evaluation and in - depth examination .
the analysis was performed by the members of steering committee of the tae .
categorical variables were summarised by frequencies and percentages , and continuous variables were summarised by means and standard deviation ( sds ) .
the responses to likert scale questions were deemed to be equidistant and symmetric , and summarised as mean and sd. the continuous variables were investigated by separate factorial multivariate ( by using wilk 's lambda test ) and univariate analysis of variance ; f - and p - values are reported along with partial eta square ( eta2 ) for estimation of effect size .
categorical variables were analysed through chi - square tests , and with fisher 's exact test when appropriate .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
when necessary , reliability analysis by a cronbach 's alpha test was performed , in order to understand whether questions about certain domains all measured the same latent variable coherently : only values of or superior to 0.7 have been considered satisfactory [ 12 ] .
all analyses were carried out by using ibm spss statistics for windows version 23.0 ( ibm corp. , armonk , ny ) .
results data from 416 participants were analysed .
table 1 illustrates the main characteristics of the respondents participating in the survey .
the mean age of respondents was 32 years ( sd 5 years ) .
most respondents came from italy ( n = 50 ; 12 %) , croatia ( n = 37 ; 9 %) , spain ( n = 35 ; 8 %) , portugal ( n = 34 ; 8 %) , france ( n = 33 ; 8 %) , the netherlands ( n = 32 ; 8 %) and turkey ( n = 26 ; 6 %) .

respondents working in nwe are more often married or cohabitant .
no differences were observed concerning gender , speciality and workplace .
in total , 128 / 416 ( 30.8 %) participants stated they had a child during their training : 45 / 157 ( 28.7 %) men and 83 / 259 ( 32.0 %) women ( p = 0.469 ) .
a further analysis in this subgroup showed that female physicians from nwe benefit more from paternity / maternity leaves during training than their counterparts ( table 2 ) : overall , 87 / 128 ( 68.0 %) respondents who became parents stated that they had paternity or maternity leave ( 51.1 % and 77.1 % , respectively ) .
moreover , the evaluation of working hours flexibility for breastfeeding mothers showed that 43 / 87 ( 49.4 %) enjoyed this benefit , which was not different across countries ( p = 0.068 ) , workplace ( p = 0.516 ) or speciality ( p = 0.386 ) .
finally , the assessment of self - perceived satisfaction regarding the general flexibility guaranteed to parents during training showed only differences for gender : men were more satisfied than women ( table 2 ) .
no interaction between the variables was found .

trainees from see had the least physical activity ( table 3 ) , whereas participants from the same region reported the highest participation in volunteer work .
there were no other statistically significant differences regarding physical activity .
among the principal activities during free time , ' time with family ' was preferred by the majority of respondents : 191 / 416 ( 45.9 %) .
interestingly , this was also the only activity that was different across gender : 61 / 157 ( 39.9 %) males spent time with family versus 130 / 259 ( 50.2 %) females ( p = 0.009 ) .
other favourite activities performed by respondents were : fitness / sport 85 / 416 ( 20.4 %) , going to the cinema / theatre 58 / 416 ( 13.9 %) and taking recreational courses 38 / 416 ( 9.1 %) .
mobbing experience altogether , 91 / 416 ( 21.9 %) respondents claim they have experienced mobbing during training .
physicians from see reported more mobbing in comparison to those from other regions ( table 3 ) .
although not statistically significant , there was a tendency for more mobbing experience among females than in males and more in people working in university centres compared to physicians working at other sites .
burnout respondents were asked to fill in a four - item questionnaire on the topic of burnout ( table 4 ) , of which the internal validity was confirmed by a high cronbach 's alpha ( 0.824 ) .
the multivariate analysis ( online supplementary file 3 ) showed a significant difference for gender , country of work and specialty .
females have more major burnout feelings than males , especially feelings of ' achieving less than deserved ' and ' feeling worn out . '
physicians from see have more intense burnout feelings in all of the four domains .
id trainees / young specialists showed major burnout feelings with respect to the domains ' achieving less than deserved ' and ' frustration . '

the impact of work on personal commitment was expressed on a four - point likert scale : not very well (= 0 ) , not well (= 1 ) , well (= 2 ) and very well (= 3 ) discussion the major conclusions of our study are as follows : ( i ) gender differences exist across different dimensions in the personal lives among id / cm european trainees ; ( ii ) working conditions of an id / cm trainee are dependent on the european region where the training has been performed ; ( iii ) family time is the most appreciated activity during free time .
our study showed that parenthood is perceived by a number of participants as having a significant negative impact on the professional career of young physicians , especially of our female colleagues .
this is probably the result of an increased proportion of female medical graduates and , consequently , female trainees in both cm and id in recent years in europe [ 13 , 14 ] , and traditional opinion ( still prevailing in the majority of european countries ) that parenthood is mainly the mother 's responsibility .
additionally , about half of breastfeeding mothers in this study enjoyed the benefit of working hours flexibility , which can be a significant obstacle for an advanced and academic career , as previously shown by other studies [ 15 , 16 ] .
thus , it might be wise to provide mentoring programmes , role models and flexible career structures , which can support female physicians .
according to this survey , the satisfaction of having working hours flexibility as a parent during training was surprisingly higher among male physicians .
it has been shown that parenthood also has an impact on an individual 's satisfaction with his or her career besides the impact on subjective career success [ 17 ] .
our data show that young physicians from see had less stimulation from their work environment , performed less physical activity during their free time , did voluntary work more often and had been subjected to more mobbing compared to their peers in nwe .
previous studies reported complaints of bureaucratic tasks , little time for education and poor support from tutors / supervisors in both greece [ 18 , 19 ] and spain [ 20 ] .
even high - income countries could not offer the ideal work conditions to medical residents , as shown by the recent troubled negotiations in the united kingdom between the government and junior doctors on a new contract entailing a quantitative improvement of staffing levels in hospitals , especially during nights and weekends [ 21 ] .
the proposal stems from two premises that are attributed to a lack of personnel : the so - called ' weekend effect ,' namely the presumed higher mortality risk for patients hospitalised on saturdays and sundays [ 22 ] , and the delays to discharge from hospital ( thereby increasing hospital length of stay and costs ) [ 23 ] .
the morale among uk young physicians is low , owing to overwhelming workloads , poor quality of training and lack of flexibility in working schedules [ 24 ] .
unhappy and unsatisfied doctors are associated with worse patient outcomes [ 24 ] .
in our survey , this pattern of remarkable dissatisfaction especially concerns the participants from see (> 50 %) .
it is particularly worrisome that they report , besides a non - stimulating work environment , the lack of opportunities , e.g. including regular and official meetings with their tutors and heads of department to voice their malcontent , directly or through representatives .
advanced and multi - faceted mentorship programmes , including clinical , professional and academic components , with constant assistance and feedback , were much appreciated by residents [ 25 ] .
other worrisome aspects are the higher values trainees and young specialists from see report in terms of mobbing and burnout experience at work .
burnout among healthcare professionals has become an important issue over the past several years , and it may be broadly defined as a state of mental and physical exhaustion due to work or caregiving activities [ 26 ] .
the 22 - item maslach burnout inventory , tested also on medical residents [ 27 ] , is the most commonly used questionnaire [ 28 ] , although it is not the only tool to assess the main related domains such as exhaustion , depersonalisation and reduced personal accomplishment [ 26 ] .
we devised a simplified likert scale questionnaire that was statistically reliable after running a proper cronbach 's alpha test .
burnout varies across different residency specialties , from 75 % in obstetrics - gynaecology to 27 % in family medicine [ 26 ] .
our survey notably states that females , physicians from see and id physicians are often affected by this syndrome .
several factors are deemed important in contributing to residents' burnout , such as time demands , difficult job situations , lack of control and work planning [ 26 ] .
in a study conducted among dutch residents , gender differences were also relevant [ 29 ] ; in our study , women have more burnout feelings than men .
preventive and therapeutic approaches should include workplace - driven and individual - driven measures , such as workload modification , diversification of work duties and stress management training [ 26 ] , but also take into account gender and the interference between home and work .
this survey emphasised family time as the most appreciated leisure activity .
indeed , many studies have shown that certain medical specialities , such as surgery , are highly incompatible with a satisfactory work - family balance [ 30 - 33 ] .
the burden of family duties is disproportionally taken over by women , as identified in a recent survey among european cm / id specialists [ 9 ] .
an important limitation of this survey is the uncertainty of whether the participants adequately represent the entire population of cm / id trainees in europe .
unfortunately , reliable information on the number of cm / id trainees in the majority of european countries is lacking , which hindered the estimation of the representativeness of our survey .
furthermore , this study is limited by the inherent limitations of opinion - based surveys .
we did not combine these quantitative data with qualitative data in order to explore perceptions in parenthood , mobbing experience and burnout more in depth .
in conclusion , the first survey among european trainees in cm and id shows heterogeneity in satisfaction on having an adequate work - life balance , which is known to be an important factor for the prevention of work stress and burnout , but also the quality of medical care .

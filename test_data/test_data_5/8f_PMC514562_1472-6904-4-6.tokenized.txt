background baclofen is a gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) analog that has inhibitory effects on spinal cord reflexes and brain .
intrathecal baclofen ( itb ) therapy consists of long - term delivery of baclofen to the intrathecal space .
intrathecal baclofen has been used to treat spasticity due to cerebral palsy , brain or spinal cord injury , multiple sclerosis , dystonia , stroke and stiff - man syndrome , particularly for those patients who are unresponsive to conservative pharmacotherapy or develop intolerable side effects at therapeutic doses of oral baclofen [ 1 ] .
side effects such as drowsiness , nausea , headache , muscle weakness and light - headedness can occur as a result of the pump delivering an incorrect dose of baclofen .
sudden cessation of itb administration can cause mild symptoms like reappearance of baseline level of spasticity associated with pruritis , anxiety and disorientation [ 2 ] .
these mild symptoms represent " loss of drug effect " .
all patients experience " loss of drug effect " when itb is discontinued , only a small ( but unknown ) proportion of patients develop a full - blown potentially life - threatening withdrawal syndrome .
we report a case of itb withdrawal syndrome developing hyperthermia , severe spasticity , disseminated intravascular coagulation , rhabdomyolysis , acute renal failure and multisystem organ failure .
case presentation a 24 - year - old man was admitted to our intensive care unit ( icu ) with a possible diagnosis of seizure disorder and sepsis .
he had a past medical history of cerebral palsy and spastic quadriparesis .
three years ago , he had an itb pump implanted for spasticity refractory to the high doses of oral baclofen .
he had a significant improvement in spasticity , social and functional capacity in the past three years .
later , he developed some disorientation and increased spasticity .
he was taken to a local physician who prescribed oral baclofen ( 120 mg daily in four divided doses ) for his increased spasticity .
he also advised him to have his itb pump checked immediately .
the following day , his spasticity increased even after taking oral baclofen .
he developed multiple seizures and respiratory distress in the next 24 - hour period .
subsequently , he was admitted in a local hospital where he was orally intubated and transferred to our icu for aggressive management .
on presentation , his temperature was 104.6degreesf ( 40.3degreesc ) , heart rate 127 beats per minute , and the blood pressure was 85 / 45 mm / hg. his ventilator settings were : assist - control ventilation mode ; respiratory rate , 15 breaths per minute ; tidal volume , 650 ml ; positive end expiratory pressure ( peep ) , 5 cm h2o ; and fio2 , 60 % .
his spontaneous respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100 % was noted on pulse oximetry .
in the local hospital , he was documented to have a high fever of 107degreesf ( 41.6degreesc ) and he had received intravenous lorazepam , phenytoin , pantoprazole , piperacillin / tazobactem and dopamine .
on physical examination , neurologically he was unconscious with decerebrate posturing and his glasgow coma scale was 6 .
he had an absent corneal and gag reflexes .
he was moving all four limbs in response to noxious stimuli .
he was also noted to have an extreme spasticity in all four limbs .
lung examination revealed decreased breath sounds in the left lower base .
cardiac examination was unremarkable .
he had a palpable baclofen pump on abdominal wall and bowel sounds were heard .
the differential diagnoses were septic shock , meningitis , neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia .
the initial laboratory results showed serum creatinine phosphokinase ( cpk ) 5250 u / l ( normal , 25 - 235 u / l ) and cpk - mb fraction 12.1 ng / ml ( normal , 0.5 - 6.3 u / l ) .
serum chemistry revealed sodium 142 mmol / l , potassium 5.1 mmol / l , chloride 120 mmol / l , bicarbonate 13 mmol / l , and creatinine 2.1 mg / dl. hemogram showed white blood cell count 12.2 k / ul , hemoglobin 16.5 g / dl and platelet count 9 k / ul ( normal , 130 - 400 k / ul ) .
liver function test showed aspartate aminotransferase ( alt ) 1128 u / l , alanine aminotransferase ( ast ) 1140 u / l , alkaline phophatase 90 u / l , total bilirubin 1.2 mg / dl , conjugated bilirubin 0.7 mg / dl , prothrombin time 20.2 seconds ( normal , 10 - 12.5 seconds ) , and inr 2.0 ( normal , 0.9 - 1.1 ) .
blood and urine cultures were obtained .
chest radiograph was normal .
a computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the chest revealed atelectasis of the left lung base .
his ct scan of head did not show any acute infarct or bleeding .
his initial management included intravenous fluids , norepinephrine , platelet transfusion , phenytoin , propofol and broad - spectrum antibiotics ( vancomycin , ceftriaxone ) for suspected meningitis and septic shock .
he received intravenous lorazepam ( 4 - 8 mg every four hours ) for his spasticity .
next day , his spasticity improved and an itb specialist investigated his baclofen pump .
his baclofen pump analysis revealed that it was stopped due to some programming error , which was restarted at a previously prescribed baclofen rate ( 260 mug / day ) .
on third hospital day , his serum cpk was 15,878 u / l , ast was 2566 u / l , alt was 2993 u / l , while cpk - mb fraction came down to 3.4 ng / ml. his urine output decreased (< 400 ml / day ) and serum creatinine increased in the range of 5 - 6 mg / dl. later , he was hemodialyzed few times during the course of hospitalization due to acute renal failure .
his echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 - 25 % and severe global hypokinesis .
his electroencephalogram did not reveal any epileptogenic activity .
he developed full - blown multisystem organ failure with an evidence of shock liver , renal failure , respiratory failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation and myocardial depression .
his nutrition was started on nasogastric tube feedings , and proper ventilator care was taken through a tracheostomy tube .
his serum baclofen obtained at the time of admission was less than 0.02 mug / ml ( expected values , 0.08 - 0.4 mug / ml ) .
after a three - week course of aggressive management in icu , he was weaned off from the ventilator and his multiple organ shock resolved .
at a six - month follow - up , he was observed in a nursing home with his baseline functional , social , and family activities .
discussion intrathecal baclofen provides an effective improvement in the spasticity of patients whose spasticity is not sufficiently managed by oral baclofen or other oral anti - spastic medications [ 1 ] .
regardless of the cause of spasticity ( cerebral or spinal ) , anti - spastic effects of baclofen occur at spinal level .
poor response of oral baclofen in many patients can be explained by the fact that the spinal cord represents only about 2 % mass of the brain , and receives proportionately a lower blood flow as a fraction of cardiac output .
therefore , cerebral side effects often occur before therapeutic anti - spastic effects of oral baclofen are observed .
a programmable itb pump provides a direct , pattern - controlled delivery of baclofen to the spinal cord .
precise delivery of the itb pump yields better spasticity reduction at 1000 times lower than the doses of oral baclofen .
in addition , the adverse effects are minimized as compared with oral baclofen .
itb provides reduced tone , spasms and pain , improves speech , mobility , sleep quality and bladder control , with a response rate up to 97 % in adults and children [ 3,4 ] .
the itb pump is approximately 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick .
it is surgically implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of anterior abdominal wall .
baclofen is delivered via a silicone rubber catheter into the lumbar subarachanoid space .
the itb pump delivers approximately 100 - 900 mug / day of baclofen , and it is titrated for the desired clinical response .
it is also equipped with an alarm that signals low volume , low battery , or malfunction .
nine years ago , catheter or pump - related malfunction that leads to an overdose or withdrawal has been reported in 40 % of the patients with itb pump [ 5 ] .
catheter system , operative techniques and programming system of the itb pump have now been improved significantly to reduce the incidence of an overdose or withdrawal .
the precise mechanism of action of baclofen as a muscle relaxant and anti - spasticity agent is not fully understood .
baclofen inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord level [ 6 ] , possibly by decreasing excitatory neurotransmitter release from primary afferent terminals , although actions at supraspinal sites may also contribute to its clinical effects .
baclofen also causes enhancement of vagal tone and inhibition of mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine neurons ( directly or via inhibiting substance p ) [ 7 ] .
baclofen is a structural analog of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gaba , and may exert its effects by stimulation of the gabab receptor to cause muscle relaxation .
baclofen reduces increased muscle tone , babinski sign , tendon reflexes , ankle clonus and sometimes decreases muscle force .
long - term itb infusion causes down - regulation of gabab receptors in the cns and spinal cord .
down - regulation of gabab receptors accounts for the decreased sensitivity to the baclofen over time .
although gabab receptors are down - regulated , it is the baclofen itself that causes increased inhibitory tone in the cns and spinal cord [ 8 ] .
therefore , abrupt itb withdrawal results in a predominance of excitatory effects and simulates other conditions that are associated with cns hyperexcitability and severe spasticity .
sudden cessation of itb administration can cause mild symptoms like reappearance of baseline level of spasticity associated with pruritis , anxiety and disorientation .
these mild symptoms represent " loss of drug effect " .
all patients experience " loss of drug effect " when itb is discontinued .
however , more severe symptoms like hyperthermia ( 109.4degreesf ) , myoclonus , seizures [ 9 - 12 ] , rhabdomyolysis , disseminated intravascular coagulation , multisystem organ failure [ 10 ] , cardiac arrest , coma and death [ 9,12,13 ] have been well reported , and represents a full - blown life - threatening itb withdrawal syndrome .
food and drug administration ( fda ) of usa has included a drug label warning for baclofen withdrawal syndrome in april 2002 [ 1,13 ] .
differential diagnoses include malignant hyperthermia , neuroleptic - malignant syndrome , autonomic dysreflexia , sepsis and meningitis .
itb withdrawal syndrome has been fatal in some cases .
six patients have died out of 27 cases reported to fda [ 13 ] .
most reported episodes of itb withdrawal were caused by preventable human errors or oversights .
however , catheter dislodgement , catheter migration and kinks , and other catheter - related issues might be more common than pump - related malfunctions [ 1,14 ] .
close attention to pump refilling and programming procedures may reduce the incidence of itb withdrawal syndrome .
benzodiazepines are helpful in controlling spasticity and seizures during itb withdrawal syndrome [ 1,10 ] .
benzodiazepines activate central receptors and gabaa receptors of spinal cord by different mechanisms [ 1 ] .
therefore , itb induced down - regulation of gabab receptors do not interfere with benzodiazepine 's mechanism of action .
during a planned removal of itb pump due to infection or other causes , premedication with high doses of benzodiazepines and augmented oral baclofen is usually administered in the hospitals to prevent spasticity .
similarly , high doses of oral baclofen is also tried in some cases of itb withdrawal syndrome [ 15,16 ] .
but failure of high doses of oral baclofen ( 80 mg three times daily ) have been reported recently [ 17 ] .
high doses of oral baclofen may not be adequate to treat or prevent itb withdrawal because of down - regulation of central gabab receptors due to chronic itb administration .
moreover , it has been suggested that it may take many hundreds of grams of oral baclofen to achieve a therapeutic baclofen level in the cerebrospinal fluid , compared to the patients who had effective spasticity control with an itb pump [ 17 ] .
although , our patient received oral baclofen ( 120 mg daily in four divided doses ) initially but these doses may be low enough to prevent itb withdrawal syndrome .
failure of high doses of oral baclofen suggests that resumption of gabab receptor agonist by prompt restoration of itb pump and proper supportive care might be the best treatment .
similarly , high - dose benzodiazepines may be effective because of similar mechanism of action on widespread cns gabaa receptors .
high - dose benzodiazepines could be an initial life saving strategy even before analysis and restoration of itb pump is achieved , or in cases , where resumption of itb administration is not as simple as correcting a programming error .
intrathecal baclofen bolus is appropriate , but due to the risk of inadvertent overdose , an experienced physician should immediately perform reinstitution of itb pump .
we had restarted itb in our patient at a previously prescribed dose .
however , a much higher dose of baclofen could have safely been given to overcome the spasticity since the patient was in an icu .
high - dose dantrolene ( a direct muscle relaxant that acts on sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle ) has been tried to reduce spasticity and fever in itb withdrawal syndrome [ 18 ] .
reduction in fever may be due to cessation of repetitive and thermogenic contractions of muscle fibers .
it is unlikely that dantrolene has any gaba agonistic effects , and administration of dantrolene may not be accompanied by any correction in anomalies of cns functions .
therefore , seizures , autonomic instability and death may occur in itb withdrawal syndrome even after controlling spasticity with dantrolene .
cyproheptadine ( a non - selective serotonin antagonist ) has also been used postulating that itb withdrawal may be a form of serotonergic syndrome that occurs from the loss of gabab receptor - mediated presynaptic inhibition of serotonin [ 19 ] .
we did not consider dantrolene or cyproheptadine in our patient due to lack of sufficient clinical support in the treatment of itb withdrawal syndrome .
there was a three - day period of delay in diagnosing the itb withdrawal syndrome leading to deterioration and multisystem organ failure .
however , our patient had a successful recovery in response to restoration of baclofen pump and adequate intensive care management .
conclusions baclofen withdrawal syndrome is a potentially life - threatening complication of intrathecal baclofen pump .
empty pump reservoir , catheter leaks or displacement , pump malfunction , programming error and refill of pump with improper drug concentration are the possible mechanisms which could lead to an itb withdrawal syndrome .
regular check - up of the itb pump by a specialist , educating patients and their caregivers may decrease the incidence of itb withdrawal syndrome .
oral baclofen replacement may not be an effective method to treat or prevent itb withdrawal syndrome .
early recognition of syndrome , high - dose benzodiazepines , prompt analysis of the itb pump with reinstitution of baclofen , and proper intensive care management are mainstays for the management of itb withdrawal syndrome .

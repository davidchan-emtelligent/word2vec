background a number of studies have reported that smoking rates are higher and smoking cessation rates are lower in patients with mental disorders than in the general population .
despite the harmful effects of smoking , implementing total smoking bans in mental health hospitals is difficult .
we investigate the status of smoking bans and the barriers to the implementation of total smoking bans in japanese mental health hospitals .
methods a questionnaire survey was administered to the directors of 1242 japanese mental health hospitals in march 2013 .
results forty - nine percent ( n = 612 ) of the hospital directors responded. of these , 24 % implemented total smoking bans and 14 % limited the bans to hospital buildings .
in 66 and 68 % of the remaining hospitals , smoking rooms were located in open and closed wards , respectively , and completely separate from nonsmoking areas .
hospitals that had not implemented total smoking bans were concerned that introducing a total ban would exacerbate patients' psychiatric symptoms ( 46 %) or increase the incidence of surreptitious smoking ( 65 %) .
however , of the hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans , only 2 and 30 % identified " aggravation of psychiatric symptoms " and " increased surreptitious smoking " as disadvantages , respectively .
the other concerns regarding the implementation of total smoking bans were staff opposition ( 21 %) and incidence of smoking around hospital grounds ( 46 %) .
these concerns were overcome by educating staff about smoking and cleaning the area around the hospital .
conclusions there are some barriers to implementing total smoking bans in japanese mental health hospitals .
however , our study indicates that implementation of total smoking bans in mental health hospitals was minimally problematic and that barriers to the implementation of smoking bans could be overcome .
as the current number of hospitals that have implemented total smoking bans is low in japan , more hospitals should introduce total smoking bans .

keywords smoking ban mental health hospital psychiatric symptoms tobacco japan issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and a considerable public health problem worldwide [ 1 ] .
the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control came into force in 2005 to protect present and future generations from the devastating health , social , environmental , and economic consequences of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke [ 2 ] .
recently , the provision of legislation to facilitate smoke - free policies in the workplace and public places has increased in a number of countries [ 3 ] .
in japan , the health promotion act was introduced in 2002 to maintain health and prevent the spread of modern disease [ 4 ] .
according to this law , superintendents of facilities used by a large number of people - - such as schools , hospitals , and public amenities - - are required to protect users from secondhand smoke , which is a risk factor for lung cancer [ 5 ] and heart disease mortality [ 6 ] .
in addition , the notice " concerning measures for passive smoking prevention " was issued by the director general of the health service bureau ( 2010 ) , and municipalities established regulations to introduce a total smoking ban in public places with heavy human traffic to reduce passive smoking .
however , compliance with these laws was not obligatory .
previous studies have reported that smoking rates are higher and smoking cessation rates are lower in people with mental disorders than in mentally healthy individuals [ 7 , 8 ] .
consequently , the former have a high risk of death due to smoking .
individuals with major depression , alcohol disorders , and schizophrenia have been found to have high mortality rates for vascular diseases and cancer [ 9 ] .
however , for many decades in mental health hospitals in japan , cigarette smoking has been permitted as a largely acceptable practice and has been considered a matter of personal preference [ 10 ] .
this may be related to the unique position occupied by smoking within the practice and culture of psychiatric care [ 11 ] .
further , there are barriers to implementing total smoking bans in mental health settings .
they are concerns such as the anticipated increase in aggression and psychiatric symptoms , opposition of staff who smoke [ 12 ] , and the belief that clandestine smoking constitutes an enhanced fire hazard risk [ 3 ] .
in two prefectures in japan , legislation imposing smoking bans is enforced in public spaces .
in one of them , a smoking room completely separated from nonsmoking areas in all hospitals is allowed .
in the other , smoking is allowed in psychiatric units .
the japan council for quality health care also compelled general hospitals to introduce total smoking bans except for psychiatric units .
thus , japanese mental health hospitals are clearly exempt from these regulations .
although smoking bans are poorly implemented in japanese mental health hospitals , no study has examined the status of smoking bans in these care settings .
in america , the mayo medical center , including its psychiatric units , implemented a smoke - free policy in 1989 [ 13 ] .
in switzerland , smoking rooms were removed and smoking was completely prohibited indoors in psychiatric units in 2006 [ 14 ] .
however , in japan , the first total smoking ban in a mental health hospital was implemented only in 2004 [ 10 ] .
the implementation of smoke - free policies in mental health hospitals began considerably later in japan than other countries .
while both people with and without mental disorders should be protected from smoking - related harm , the implementation of total smoking bans in mental health hospitals in japan seems to be suboptimal relative to general hospital settings .
this suggests that there are unique attitudinal barriers to the implementation of total smoking bans within mental health settings in japan , as in other countries [ 15 ] .
accordingly , the present study examined the status of smoking bans in mental health hospitals and assessed attitudes toward total smoking bans in japan .
we defined the term " smoking ban " to mean the prohibition of smoking regardless of the presence or absence of penalty .
methods design and setting a cross - sectional study was conducted .
a list of private mental health hospitals in japan , which included 1208 institutions , was obtained from the japanese association of psychiatric hospitals , and a list of public 34 mental health hospitals composed primarily of psychiatric units was obtained from the japan municipal hospital association website ( https :// www.jmha.or.jp / jmha /) .
a total of 1242 mental health hospitals were included in this study .
some had long - term care wards and / or general wards other than psychiatric wards .
procedures questionnaires were mailed to the hospital directors at the beginning of march 2013 , and we asked them to complete the survey and return the responses by march 31 , 2013 .
measures the questionnaire was designed to collect information on the attitude to smoking bans in mental health hospitals , referring to previous research on this topic [ 7 , 16 ] .
questionnaires asked about the following : ( 1 ) the status of smoking bans in hospitals in march 2013 , ( 2 ) plans to introduce a smoking ban in the future , ( 3 ) reasons for the hospital 's reluctance to implement a total smoking ban , ( 4 ) the support provided to hospital patients to facilitate smoking cessation , ( 5 ) the hospital 's reason for introducing a total smoking ban , ( 6 ) perceived advantages of introducing a total smoking ban , and ( 7 ) perceived disadvantages of introducing a total smoking ban .
the questionnaire consisted of multiple - choice questions , and if none of the choices corresponded with participants' answers , they could choose " other " and enter their own responses .
questions 1 and 4 were applicable to all hospitals ; questions 2 and 3 were applicable to hospitals that had not implemented total smoking bans ; questions 5 , 6 , and 7 were applicable to the hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans .
the primary outcome measure was the proportion of the mental health hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans .
the secondary outcome measure was the attitude to smoking bans in mental health hospitals reported via the questionnaire .
data analysis questionnaire responses were coded and entered into spss ( v. 18 ) .
we compared the mean number of inpatient beds and distribution of hospital location between respondents and non - respondents , using a t test and a chi - square test , respectively .
results smoking ban status in mental health hospitals the response rate was 49.3 % ( 612 out of 1242 hospitals ) .
the number of inpatient beds in the participating hospitals is summarized in additional file 1 : table s1 .
as of march 2013 , 23.5 % of the participating hospitals had implemented total smoking bans , and 14.4 % had limited the implementation of smoking bans to hospital buildings .
implementation of smoking bans did not significantly differ between public and private hospitals ( chi2 = 0.53 , p = 0.75 ). of the hospitals that had not implemented total smoking bans , 7.7 % planned to do so in the future .
figure 1 shows the smoking arrangements established by hospitals that had not implemented smoking bans encompassing their entire grounds or those with bans limited to hospital buildings .
in 68 and 66 % of these hospitals , smoking rooms were located in closed and open wards , respectively , and were completely separate from nonsmoking areas .
in addition , 54 % reported that smoking bans were in force in their outpatient wards , and 71 % reported that smoking areas were located outside hospital buildings , close to outdoor nonsmoking areas in the hospital grounds .
further , 2.9 % of all participating hospitals had simply established smoking rooms next to nonsmoking areas .
approximately , 75 % of the hospitals that had introduced total smoking bans had done so after 2010 ( fig. 2 ). fig. 1 smoking arrangements in hospitals where smoking bans do not encompass the entire grounds or where bans are limited to hospital buildings fig. 2 change in the number of the hospitals implementing smoking bans questionnaire concerning the implementation of smoking bans hospitals that had not implemented total smoking bans were concerned that introducing a ban would exacerbate patients' psychiatric symptoms ( 45.1 %) or increase the incidence of surreptitious smoking ( 65.0 % ; additional file 1 : table s2 ) .
however , only 1.7 and 30.2 % of hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans cited " aggravation of psychiatric symptoms " and " increased surreptitious smoking " as disadvantages ( additional file 1 : table s3 ) .
another concern regarding the implementation of smoking bans was that the incidence of smoking around hospital grounds would increase ( 46.0 %) .
in addition , the main disadvantage of total smoking bans ( 52.6 %) , cited by the hospitals that had implemented them , was that residents living nearby complained about people smoking outside hospital grounds , near their homes .
in addition , 59.4 and 20.9 % of the hospitals that had not implemented total smoking bans expressed concern that inpatients and staff members , respectively , would not consent to a ban .
some respondents reported that total smoking bans should not be enforced , as they violate patients' rights to smoke .
approximately , 70 % of the hospitals provided smoking cessation support for patients ( additional file 1 : table s4 ) ; they also provided nicotine patches at low prices and held smoking cessation workshops for staff members .
the hospitals' reasons for implementing total smoking bans are described in additional file 1 : table s5 .
almost 90 % of the hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans identified the social trend toward smoking bans in the healthcare field as the reason for the implementation of total bans .
in addition , 26.8 % reported that they had implemented a total smoking ban following an evaluation by the japan council for quality health care .
other reasons included compliance with local regulations or national notices and prevention of problems caused by smoking , such as fire and stained hospital walls .
the perceived advantages of implementing a total smoking ban are shown in additional file 1 : table s6 .
a total of 75.2 % of respondents reported that the cleanliness of their hospitals had improved , 56 % reported a reduction in staff smoking rates , and 53.9 % reported a decrease in problems caused by smoking .
importantly , a few respondents reported that they had received positive feedback regarding the ban from patients ( 14.9 %) and residents living nearby ( 4.3 %) .
other advantages included reduced costs and effort over cigarettes , a decrease in secondhand smoke , and health benefits .
the disadvantages of total smoking bans are described in additional file 1 : table s3 ; 44.8 % of respondents chose " other ," while approximately 30 % reported that they had not experienced any problems related to the implementation of a total smoking ban .
discussion this study investigated the status of smoking bans in japanese mental health hospitals .
a total of 23.5 % of the participating mental health hospitals had implemented total smoking bans when the survey was conducted in march 2013 , and the number of mental health hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans had increased since 2010 .
this increase could have been related to the notice " concerning measures for passive smoking prevention " issued by the director general of the health service bureau on february 25 , 2010 [ 17 ] .
however , compliance with this notice was voluntary .
yamato et al. reported that 86 % of japanese university hospitals with psychiatric wards had implemented total smoking bans in 2011 .
in the united kingdom , 13 % of mental health establishments and 41 % of acute trusts have implemented smoke - free policies that apply to the entire premises , including the hospital grounds , without exemption [ 3 ] .
in the united states , 88.1 % of psychiatric / alcohol - chemical dependency hospitals and 95 % of general hospitals complied with smoking ban standards [ 18 ] .
as the differences in the prevalence of smoking bans between general and mental health hospitals varied between countries , implementation of smoking bans appears to be more difficult in psychiatric than general hospitals .
a number of studies have reported obstacles to the implementation of total smoking bans in mental health hospitals [ 15 , 19 ] .
the present results indicated that directors of japanese hospitals were concerned that an introduction of a total smoking ban would exacerbate patients' psychiatric symptoms ; however , only a small number of directors from the hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans reported this outcome .
similarly , wye et al. reported that in australian mental health hospitals , the greatest barriers to successful total smoking ban implementation were fear of aggression and noncompliance in patients [ 20 ] .
cole et al. conducted their research at a new york state psychiatric facility and demonstrated a small but statistically significant decrease in global assessment of function scores but no significant changes in baseline brief psychiatric rating scale scores , after the implementation of a smoke - free policy [ 21 ] .
a discrepancy between anticipated and observed exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms has also been reported [ 19 , 22 , 23 ] .
our results were congruent with those of other studies indicating concern regarding staff opposition to implementing a total smoking ban [ 20 , 24 ] .
this may be partly due to a lack of knowledge among or higher incidence of smoking in mental health hospital staff members than those of other hospitals [ 19 ] .
a number of previous studies reported that staff members who smoked were more likely to hold negative beliefs regarding smoke - free policies [ 11 , 25 ] .
staff acceptance of total smoking bans has been associated with successful implementation of smoking bans [ 26 ] .
therefore , some studies have noted that training staff members to recognize and manage nicotine withdrawal and relapse , and supporting individuals in smoking cessation are important factors in successful implementation of smoking bans [ 11 , 20 , 26 ] .
in our study , 20.4 % of respondents reported staff opposition to be a barrier to implementing smoking bans ; it may be important to educate them to increase the implementation of total smoking bans in japanese mental health hospitals .
in accordance with previous research findings [ 20 ] , 75 % of respondents reported that the cleanliness of their hospitals improved following the implementation of total smoking bans .
approximately , 50 % of the respondents from hospitals that had implemented total smoking bans reported that they had received complaints from residents living nearby because of an increase in smoking outside hospital grounds , near their homes .
regarding the advantages of total smoking bans , a few respondents chose " receiving positive feedback from residents living nearby. " to address this complaint , some hospitals reported that staff cleaned the areas outside hospital grounds regularly .
while a total smoking ban was previously reported to reduce staff members' workload [ 20 ] , respondents in this study reported that the implementation of total smoking bans created additional work for staff members , such as cleaning areas outside hospital grounds because of an increase in smoking in these areas .
secondhand smoke exposure , like firsthand smoke , causes death , diseases , and disability [ 27 ] and only total smoking bans can protect people from secondhand smoke [ 28 ] .
at this point , in mental health settings , patients in closed wards are exposed to secondhand smoke .
we consider it important for all patients , especially in mental health settings , for total smoking bans to be implemented .
as mentioned above , our research indicated some obstacles that japanese directors had concerns about .
previous studies reported that the barriers to implementing smoking bans were issues related to patients' rights and opposition from staff who smoke and who believe that a smoke - free policy would adversely affect psychiatric patients' mental health [ 15 ] .
the key features in mental health hospitals where smoking bans have been effectively implemented are staff education and support , patient preparation , provision of nicotine replacement therapy ( nrt ) , establishment of overarching strategy aimed at long - term quitting with evidence , and changes in smoking culture [ 26 , 29 - 31 ] .
however , nrt is covered by health insurance for outpatients but not for inpatients in all hospitals , including pubic hospitals .
additionally , in the japanese mental health hospitals that successfully implemented total smoking bans , the strong leadership of committees , including the directors , has overcome the barriers to smoking bans by educating patients and staff in workgroups [ 10 ] .
among the developed countries ( e.g. , g8 ) , only japan has no national law imposing smoking bans in public places [ 32 ] .
to improve the implementation of total smoking bans in mental health hospitals , the establishment of a national law that obligates smoking bans may be necessary .
this study had some limitations .
first , approximately 50 % of the potential participants did not return the questionnaire .
there were no significant differences in the location of hospitals ( chi2 = 4.21 , p = 0.52 ) and the number of beds ( t = 1.14 , p = 0.26 ) between responding and non - responding hospitals .
however , the hospitals that did not answer the questionnaire were not likely to have implemented smoking bans ; therefore , we may have overestimated the proportion of mental health hospitals that had implemented smoking bans .
further , we sent no reminders to the directors of hospitals , so the response rate could be improved by sending reminders .
second , the questionnaires were sent to hospital directors , and their beliefs may differ from those of clinical staff working in mental health hospitals .
third , the questions about the implementation of total smoking bans differed between the hospitals that implemented total smoking bans and those that did not .
therefore , we could not directly compare directors' attitude toward total smoking bans between these mental health settings , and could not detect which hospitals are more likely to undertake total smoking bans .
conclusions in this study , we shed light on the status of smoking bans in japanese mental health hospitals and revealed their directors' attitudes to implementing total smoking bans .
the results indicated that concerns regarding the introduction of total smoking bans were less problematic than expected in hospitals that had already implemented bans .
as the number of hospitals that have implemented total smoking bans is low in japan , our findings show the need for increased implementation of total smoking bans in mental health hospitals .

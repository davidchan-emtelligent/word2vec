abstract background : transcaval inferior vena cava ( ivc ) filter penetration involving the urinary tract is rare , but has been previously reported .
we herein present unique management of symptomatic hydronephrosis secondary to erosion of an ivc filter limb into the lumen of the proximal right ureter .
case presentation : a 59 - year - old woman presented with abdominal and right flank pain in october 2015 and was found to have right hydronephrosis , apparently secondary to obstruction from erosion of an ivc filter limb into the proximal right ureter .
this was effectively managed with percutaneous , endovascular , and endourologic procedures , without the need for a major invasive surgical procedure .
conclusion : endovascular removal of the ivc filter was performed safely in this case and can be considered when the urinary tract is involved in filter erosion .
introduction and background transcaval inferior vena cava ( ivc ) filter penetration is a well - recognized but often inconsequential complication of an ivc filter placement procedure .
involvement of the urinary tract requiring intervention , although rare , has been previously reported .
we present a case in which symptomatic hydronephrosis secondary to erosion of a filter limb into the lumen of the proximal right ureter was effectively managed with minimally invasive techniques , without need for invasive surgical intervention .
presentation of case clinical history a 53 - year - old woman presented with a 1 - month history of fluctuating abdominal and right flank pain .
medical history was significant for multiple prior abdominal operations , recurrent small bowel obstructions , and chronic abdominal pain .
in addition , she had recurrent deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) and noncompliance with anticoagulation , leading to the placement of a cook celect ( r ) retrievable ivc filter ( bloomington , in ) in 2011 .
on initial presentation , she was afebrile and had normal vitals .
physical examination revealed mild diffuse abdominal tenderness and mild right costovertebral angle tenderness .
laboratory evaluation was largely unremarkable without leukocytosis or elevated serum creatinine .
microscopic urinalysis did not show pyuria or hematuria .
imaging a ct of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained in the emergency room , which revealed moderate right hydronephrosis secondary to an eroded ivc filter limb projecting in the right proximal ureteral lumen ( figs. 1 and 2 ) .
her complicated history had led to multiple previous ct scans , allowing for radiographic tracking of gradual migration of the filter limb into the ureter on sequential scans. fig. 1. axial cut ct showing erosion of multiple ivc filter limbs , including limb projecting into lumen of right ureter with proximal hydroureteronephrosis. fig. 2. coronal cut ct with additional demonstration of filter limb penetrating right ureter .
intervention the patient was evaluated by the urology , vascular surgery , and interventional radiology services .
as there was no evidence of renal compromise , infection , hematuria , or hemodynamic compromise , no emergent intervention was performed .
review of her medical history revealed that her prior dvts had occurred during previous periods of prolonged immobility .
she was currently much more physically active .
a hypercoagulability work - up was negative .
due to these factors and the symptomatic erosion of her filter , decision was made for retrieval of the filter .
this was effectively performed through an endovascular approach by the interventional radiology service , using the right internal jugular vein for access .
the filter retrieval hook was not embedded in the caval wall , which allowed it to be snared easily with a filter retrieval device .
after this , the entire filter was withdrawn back into a sheath and removed .
concomitantly , percutaneous access for antegrade nephrostogram was performed ( fig. 3 ) , which revealed some narrowing at the site of penetration but no contrast extravasation .
a nephroureteral stent was effectively placed .
postprocedure course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home. fig. 3. antegrade nephrostogram immediately after filter retrieval showing luminal narrowing at site of limb penetration , without evidence of extravasation .
two months later , a cystoscopy , retrograde pyelogram , and diagnostic ureteroscopy were performed to evaluate the ureter at the site of ivc filter tine erosion .
retrograde pyelogram and ureteroscopy showed improved but still mild narrowing at the site of injury .
no urinary extravasation was noted .
the percutaneous nephroureteral stent was exchanged for an indwelling ureteral stent .
the ureteral stent was left in place for 1 month and then removed .
two months after ureteral stent removal , diuretic renography showed no evidence of obstruction .
discussion and literature review filter penetration is a well - recognized potential occurrence after ivc filter placement .
cook celect ( r ) filters are a relatively new model of retrievable ivc filter .
these filters , made of a cobalt chromium alloy with platinum tungsten alloy radiopaque markers , are rated mri conditional by the manufacturer , allowing for usage of mri up to 3.0 tesla .
interestingly , these filters have been noted to have an especially high rate of penetration , which increases with length of dwell time.1 filter penetration can often be asymptomatic and alone is not considered an indication for filter retrieval , but complications can arise when surrounding organs are affected .
most commonly impacted is the duodenum , and involvement of the urinary tract is rare.1 different management strategies have been used , and in some instances open surgical intervention has been indicated .
in this case , the filter was effectively removed through an endovascular approach .
no contrast extravasation was seen on postremoval inferior venocavogram .
in one series , at this time published in abstract form only , extravasation occurred after 3 % of complex filter retrievals .
this was managed effectively with balloon tamponade and observation.2 cook celect filters have been retrieved with high rates of success in the past , as high as 96 % in one series.3 interestingly , this case highlights effective retrieval of a cook celect filter 1703 days after placement , which we believe is the longest reported dwell time before an effective retrieval of this filter model .
a recently published case report described right hydronephrosis secondary to a misplaced ivc filter in the right gonadal vein .
open surgical intervention was required in this patient.4 conclusion ureteral injury from ivc filter penetration is a rarely noted complication .
in select patients , ivc filter penetration involving the urinary tract can be managed with minimally invasive techniques without need for open surgical intervention .

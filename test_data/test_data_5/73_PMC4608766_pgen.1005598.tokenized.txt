the precise regulation of microrna ( mirna ) transcription and processing is important for eukaryotic development .
plant mirnas are first transcribed as stem - loop primary mirnas ( pri - mirnas ) by rna polymerase ii,then cleaved in the nucleus into mature mirnas by dicer - like 1 ( dcl1 ) .
we identified a cycling dof transcription factor , cdf2 , which interacts with dcl1 and regulates the accumulation of a population of mirnas .
cdf2 binds directly to the promoters of some mirnas and works as a transcription activator or repressor for these mirna genes .
cdf2 binds preferentially to the pri - mirnas regulated by itself and affects dcl1 - mediated processing of these pri - mirnas .

introduction the 20 - 22 nt - long micrornas ( mirnas ) are essential regulators in many biological processes in almost all eukaryotes [ 1 ] .
mirnas are processed from stem - loop primary transcripts ( pri - mirnas ) , which are transcribed by dna - dependent rna polymerase ii [ 2 ] .
in plants , pri - mirnas are captured by the rna - binding protein dawdle ( ddl ) , which presumably stabilizes pri - mirnas [ 3 ] , then processed in a two - step manner in the nucleus into mature mirnas by a single rnase iii enzyme , dicer - like1 ( dcl1 ) [ 4 ] and its partner , the double - strand rna - binding domain ( dsrbd ) protein hyponastic leaves1 ( hyl1 ) [ 5 ] .
other proteins involved include the zinc finger domain protein serrate ( se ) [ 6 ] , c - terminal domain phosphatase - like 1 ( cpl1 ) [ 7 ] , the nuclear cap - binding complex [ 8 ] , tough [ 9 ] , and mos2 [ 10 ] .
cycling dof transcription factors ( cdfs ) are members of the dna - binding with one finger ( dof ) gene family [ 11,12 ] .
the roles of several dof - type zinc finger transcription factors are known .
the dof affecting germination 1 ( dag1 ) mutant does not require light for germination [ 13 ] , in contrast to the dag2 mutant [ 14 ] .
overexpression of atobp3 in arabidopsis resulted in altered root development and yellowish leaves [ 15 ] .
atcog1 is a negative regulator in the phya and phyb signaling pathways [ 16 ] .
cdfs are involved in photoperiodic flowering ; each cdf mutant exhibits an early flowering phenotype [ 11 ] .
dofs may also function in flowering regulation in bamboo [ 17 ] .
the blue light photoreceptor fkf1 interacts with cdf transcription factors for poly - ubiquitination - dependent degradation [ 18 ] .
several factors were recently identified to be involved in mirna transcription and processing .
not2 coordinates mir transcription and efficient dcl1 recruitment in arabidopsis mirna biogenesis [ 19 ] .
the transcription factor cdc5 reduces mir promoter activity , interacts with the dcl1 complex , and is required for mirna processing in arabidopsis [ 20 ] .
mecp2 inhibits gene transcription and also suppresses mirna processing by binding to the rna - binding domains of human dgcr8 [ 21 ] .
drosha and dcl4 modulate transcription termination of hiv - 1 and fca , respectively [ 22,23 ] .
therefore , it is of interest to address whether and how the transcription and processing of pri - mirnas are coordinated .
in this study , we identified the transcription factor cdf2 that interacts with dcl1 .
we uncovered the roles of cdf2 in mirna biogenesis at both the transcription and post - transcription levels to regulate plant flowering .
results and discussion cdf2 interacts with dcl1 to identify new components involved in regulation of mirna biogenesis , we performed a yeast two - hybrid screening for proteins that interact with the two c - terminal dsrbds of dcl1 ( dcl1 - rbd , aa 1733 - 1910 ) , which complement the phenotypes of hyl1 mutant and are important for protein - protein interactions and pri - mirna bindings [ 24 , 25 ] .
among the obtained 54 independent prey clones , 15 represented dcl1 , which is consistent with the findings of previous studies that dcl1 can interact with itself [ 24,25 ] .
four independent prey clones contained various c - terminal fragments of cdf2 .
we then examined the interactions between full length of dcl1 / hyl1 and cdf2 by yeast two - hybrid assays , the results showed that cdf2 can interact with dcl1 and hyl1 ( fig 1a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005598.g001 fig 1 cdf2 interacts with dcl1 .
( a ) yeast two hybrid assays show the interactions between cdf2 and dcl1 - rbd or hyl1 .
co - transformed yeast colonies were spotted on the selective sc medium minus trp and leu , and then grown on sc medium minus his , trp , and leu supplemented with 5mm 3 - amino - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole ( 3 - at ) .
( b ) gst and mbp pull - down assays show the interaction between cdf2 and dcl1 .
( c ) co - ip assay shows the interaction between cdf2 and dcl1 .
the protein extracts from 22 - day - old arabidopsis plants coexpressing pcdf2 : : cdf2 - ha and pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp were incubated with anti - ha - conjugated agarose .
the pellet was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti - ha and anti - gfp antibodies .
( d ) bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( bifc ) assays show that cdf2 or the c - terminal fragment of cdf2 ( cdf2 - c ) interact with dcl1 / hyl1 in d - bodies , while no interactions were observed between cdf2 and dcl1 - 9 or the n - terminal fragment of cdf2 ( cdf2 - n ) and dcl1 .
scale bar = 10mum .
( e ) yeast two hybrid assays show that the c terminal fragment of cdf2 interacts with dcl1 - rbd .
c1 , aa 189 - 457 ; c2 , aa 271 - 457 ; c3 , aa 360 - 457 .
we confirmed the interaction between dcl1 and cdf2 using maltose - binding protein ( mbp ) and glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) pull - down assays .
the purified fusion proteins mbp - cdf2 , mbp - dcl1 - rbd , gst - cdf2 , and gst - dcl1 - rbd were clearly observed on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) gel stained with coomassie dye ( s1 fig ) the gst and mbp proteins were included in parallel assays as negative controls ( fig 1b ) .
the pull - down results showed that the fusion proteins mbp - dcl1 - rbd and gst - dcl1 - rbd interact with gst - cdf2 and mbp - cdf2 , respectively , whereas no interactions with the controls were observed ( fig 1b ) .
co - ip experiments were then performed to confirm the interaction in vivo .
total proteins were extracted from 22 - day - old arabidopsis plants coexpressing hemagglutinin ( ha ) - labeled cdf2 ( pcdf2 : : cdf2 - ha ) and yellow fluorescent protein ( yfp ) - labeled dcl1 ( pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp ) , which were generated by crossing pcdf2 : : cdf2 - ha with pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp transgenic lines [ 26 ] ( s2a - s2d and s5b figs ) .
for a negative control , the proteins were extracted from the plants co - expressing pcdf2 : : cdf2 - ha / cdf2 and p35s : : yfp .
these proteins were then incubated with ha - conjugated agarose beads to immunoprecipitate dcl1 .
dcl1 - containing complexes were separated by a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) and immunoblotted with anti - green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) and anti - ha antibodies , respectively .
cdf2 was observed to interact with dcl1 ( fig 1c ) .
bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( bifc ) assays were performed to further investigate the interaction between cdf2 and components in microprocessor .
as shown in fig 1d , we found that cdf2 interacts with dcl1 / hyl1 in nuclear dicing bodies , possibly through the c - terminal fragment of cdf2 ( cdf2 - c ) .
in contrast , no interactions were observed between cdf2 and dcl1 - 9 , a c - terminal dsrbds - truncated form of dcl1 , or the n - terminal fragment of cdf2 ( cdf2 - n ) and dcl1 .
we then determined the fragment of cdf2 which interacts with dcl1 using a yeast two - hybrid assay .
cdf2 contains an n - terminal dof domain and a c - terminal fragment of unknown function .
the results showed that the c - terminal fragments of cdf2 interacted with dcl1 as strongly as the full - length cdf2 ( fig 1d ) , we then narrowed down the fragment that interacts with dcl1 , we found that the fragments of cdf2 ( aa 361 - 398 , aa 396 - 457 , aa 396 - 421 and 385 - 400 ) failed to bind to dcl1 ( s3 fig ) , indicating that the interaction between cdf2 and dcl1 was mediated by the c - terminal region ( aa 360 - 436 ) of cdf2 .
the accumulation of a group of mirnas is affected by cdf2 as cdf2 interacts with the microprocessor dcl1 / hyl1 , we then investigated if mirnas are regulated by cdf2 .
to this end , we applied high - throughput sequencing to analyze the global mirnas in 22 - day - old plants of col and cdf2 , using dcl1 - 9 mutant as a control .
totally , 114,892,98 , 123,492,11 and 130,812,02 reads were obtained from wt , cdf2 and dcl1 - 9 , and 13,233,29 ( 54.98 %) , 24,975,74 ( 75.97 %) and 11,882,21 ( 53.42 %) reads , representing 7,275,87 , 18,973,61 and 6,346,98 distinct sequences , respectively , matched the arabidopsis genome .
the sequencing data for all known mirnas were subjected to hierarchical clustering in an unsupervised manner to analyze the extent of differential mirnas [ 27 ] ( figs 2a and s4 , s1 and s2 tables ) .
at least 1.5 - fold changes in the levels were observed for 72 of 195 mirnas detected in both col and the cdf2 mutant .
among these , 52 ( 72 %) were significantly downregulated , whereas 20 ( 28 %) were upregulated .
the small rna - seq results were validated by northern blotting of mir156 , mir319 , mir167 , mir172 , mir160 , mir165 , mir170 , and mir171 repressed or activated by cdf2 , respectively ( figs 2b and s5a ) .
in contrast , almost all of the mirnas are downregulated in dcl1 - 9 mutant ( s4 fig , s2 table ) .
to minimize the potential effect of different developmental stages between col and cdf2 mutant on the interpretation of our data , we performed northern blots using inflorescences of col , cdf2 and pcdf2 : : cdf2 - ha / cdf2 , which was generated by crossing of cdf2 mutant with the pcdf2 : : cdf2 - ha / col line .
we found that the expressional levels of these mirnas are similar to those in 22 - day - old seedlings .
in addition , the pcdf2 : : cdf2 - ha / cdf2 line restored the phenotypes and mirnas levels of cdf2 mutant ( s2b and s5b figs ) , taking together , we concluded that cdf2 regulates biogenesis of a population of mirnas .

( b ) northern blots show the levels of mirnas in seedlings of col and cdf2 mutant .
u6 serves as a loading control .
cdf2 regulates the transcription of a population of primary mirnas to address the molecular mechanism of the effect of cdf2 on mirna abundance , we first examined the expressional levels of dcl1 and hyl1 , the two main components involved in mirna biogenesis , in cdf2 mutant and cdf2 overexpression lines ( s6 fig ) , the result shows that the expression levels of the genes are similar to those in col .
we then analyzed the levels of 19 pri - mirnas , for which their mature mirnas show at least 1.5 - fold differences ( s1 table ) , by quantitative real - time pcr ( qrt - pcr ) in seedlings of cdf2 mutant and cdf2 - overexpressing ( p35s : : cdf2 / col ) lines .
as shown in fig 3a , the relative levels of pri - mirnas between cdf2 and p35s : : cdf2 / col are predominantly opposite for all 19 pri - mirnas .
some of pri - mirnas ( pri - mi172a and pri - mir394a ) are up - regulated , while others down - regulated in cdf2 mutant ( fig 3a ) , indicating that cdf2 acts as both a transcriptional activator and repressor , which is similar to other dof proteins , e.g. , maize dof2 exhibits either activation or repression activities on different promoters [ 28 ] ; the barley dof factor ( prolamin - box binding factor ) activates the transcription of b - hordein , but represses the transcription of cathepsin b - like protease [ 29 ] .
the distinct roles of cdf2 in mirna transcription may be defined by the components forming different transcriptional machinery to be recruited to different promoters .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005598.g003 fig 3 cdf2 acts as a transcription factor for some mirna genes .
( a ) the relative levels of pri - mirnas in col , cdf2 , p35s : : cdf2 / col , p35s : : dcl1 / col lines examined by real - time pcr .
the relative fold changes were normalized to actin .
data are given as means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
( b ) chip - pcr analysis of five promoter fragments of mirna genes in wild - type and pcdf2 : cdf2 - yfp / col seedlings .
chip assays were performed using the 22 - day - old col - 0 and pcdf2 : : cdf2 - yfp / col seedlings expressing the cdf2 - yfp fusion protein .
dna was amplified using primers specific to 6 mirna promoter regions .
( c ) chip followed by real time pcr of 6 promoter fragments of mirna genes in col and pcdf2 : : cdf2 - yfp / col seedlings .
relative enrichment of fragments was calculated with ha antibodies as the control .
data are given as means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
( d ) and ( e ) pmir172a : : gus in col , cdf2 and p35s : : dcl1 / col in seedlings ( d ) and flowers ( e ) , respectively .
thirty plants containing gus were analyzed for each of genotypes .
( f ) the transcript levels of gus driven by mir172b promoter in col , cdf2 and p35s : : dcl1 / col .
gus transcript levels were determined by qrt - pcr .
data are given as means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
to determine whether cdf2 binds to the promoters of these mirna genes or not , we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation - pcr ( chip - pcr ) assay using gfp antibody - precipitated chromatin from pcdf2 : : cdf2 - yfp transgenic plant ( s2a fig ) .
we focused on the promoters of mirna genes for which the levels of pri - mirnas changed in the cdf2 mutant ( fig 3a , s2 table ) .
the promoter fragments of mirna genes ( including mir156a , mir319b , mir160b , mir167b , and mir172b ) were amplified from gfp antibody - immunoprecipitated , but not from ha antibody - immunoprecipitated pcdf2 : : cdf2 - yfp / col samples ( figs 3b , 3c and s2a ) .
importantly , the promoter fragment of mir164a , which is not regulated by cdf2 ( fig 3a ) , was not amplified from gfp antibody - immunoprecipitated pcdf2 : : cdf2 - yfp / col ( fig 3b and 3c ) .
in contrast , no apparent enrichment of fragments in col was observed ( fig 3b ) .
to further test the effect of cdf2 on the mirna expression , we used a beta - glucuronidase ( gus ) reporter gene driven by the promoter of mir172a whose expression is repressed by cdf2 ( fig 3a ) .
this system was previously used to determine the function of ddl , cdc5 , and not2 in the regulation of mir gene transcription [ 3,19,20 ] .
we crossed cdf2 with transgenic plants containing pmir172a : : gus .
in the second ( f2 ) generation , we obtained cdf2 / cdf2 , cdf2 / cdf2 and cdf2 / cdf2 genotypes containing pmir172a : : gus .
gus was markedly increased in cdf2 / cdf2 compared to that in cdf2 + plants ( fig 3d and 3e ) .
quantitative rt - pcr analysis indicated that the gus mrna levels in cdf2 mutant were increased at different developmental stages ( fig 3f ) .
together , we conclude that cdf2 regulates the transcription of a group of mirna genes .
cdf2 affects the post - transcriptional processing of a subset of primary mirnas to investigate the biological role of the interaction between cdf2 and dcl1 in mirna biogenesis , we performed rna competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays to test whether cdf2 affects the well - known binding activity of dcl1 - rbd to pri - mirnas .
the reactions were performed using a fixed dcl1 - rbd concentration and increasing amounts of cdf2 .
interestingly , similar to dcl1 - rbd ( figs 4a , lane1 , and s7a - s7d , lane1 ) , cdf2 was also observed to bind to pri - mir167b ( figs 4a , lane2 , and s7a - s7d , lane2 ) , and the binding ability of dcl1 - rbd to the pri - mirna decreased as the concentration of cdf2 increased ( figs 4a and s7a - s7d , lane 3 - 7 ) , indicating that the interaction between cdf2 and dcl1 - rbd affects the binding of dcl1 - rbd to the pri - mirna in vitro .
in addition , we also found that the binding of cdf2 to pri - mirnas was mainly mediated by its c - terminal fragment ( s7e fig ) .
to test the pri - mirna binding of cdf2 in vivo , an rna immunoprecipitation assay was performed .
using a gfp antibody , we immunoprecipitated cdf2 - yfp and dcl1 - yfp complexes from the 22 - day - old seedlings of pcdf2 : : cdf2 - yfp / col ( s2a fig ) , pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp / col , pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp / cdf2 , and pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp / col x p35s : : cdf2 - ha / col line which was generated by crossing pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp with p35s : : cdf2 - ha transgenic lines , using col as a negative control of plants .
in parallel , an igg antibody - immunoprecipitated samples from these lines were used as a negative control of the antibody .
interestingly , the immunoprecipitated cdf2 - yfp complex ( s8 fig ) contains pri - mir156a , pri - mir172b , pri - mir319b , and pri - mir167b , which have altered levels in the cdf2 mutant , but not pri - mir164a , which showed no change in cdf2 mutant ( fig 4b , s1 table ) .
in contrast , dcl1 was able to bind to all 5 pri - mirnas examined ( fig 4b ) .
the bindings of the dcl1 to pri - mirnas increase in the pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp / cdf2 and decrease in the line of pdcl1 : : dcl1 - yfp / col x p35s : : cdf2 - ha / col .
these results suggested that cdf2 binds mainly to the cdf2 - regulated pri - mirnas in vivo , possibly due to that cdf2 has more accessibility to these pri - mirnas transcribed with the aid of the transcription complex containing cdf2 , this was supported by a recent report that transcription and processing of primary micrornas are coupled by elongator complex [ 30 ] , resulting in that cdf2 only affects the processing of a subset of pri - mirnas .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005598.g004 fig 4 cdf2 binds to pri - mirnas and affects the binding of dcl1 to pri - mirnas .
( a ) rna emsas show the effect of cdf2 on the binding of dcl1 to pri - mirna167 .
( b ) an rip assay was performed using 22 - day - old plants , rna fragments were immunoprecipitated with the gfp antibody and subsequently subjected to qrt - pcr analysisfor the indicated pri - mirnas .
data are given as means +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
we also compared the the levels of steady - state pri - mirnas among col , hyl1 , cdf2 and hyl1 / cdf2 mutants ( s9 fig ) .
interestingly , for pri - mir164 which was not affected by cdf2 at both transcriptional and post - transcriptional levels , the amount of pri - mir164 in hyl1 is similar to that in hyl1 / cdf2 .
other pri - mirnas were regulated by hyl1 and cdf2 in different degrees ( s9 fig ) .
as cdf2 interacts with dcl1 , and affects the binding of dcl1 to pri - mirnas ( figs 4a and s7a - s7d ) , we then evaluated the role of cdf2 in dcl1 - mediated mirna processing in vivo .
to this end , we compared the accumulation levels of five mirnas , including mir156 , mir167 , mir319 , and mir172 which are regulated by cdf2 , and mir164 which is not regulated by cdf2 , in col , cdf2 , p35s : : cdf2 - yfp / col ( s10a fig ) , and dcl1 - 9 lines .
we found that the accumulation levels of mir156 , mir167 , mir319 , and mir172 in p35s : : cdf2 - yfp / col were significantly lower than that in cdf2 mutant and col lines ( fig 5a ) .
in contrast , mir164 accumulation level in the p35s : : cdf2 - yfp / col line is similar to that in col , possibly due to that cdf2 does not bind to mirna164 in vivo which is not regulated at the transcriptional level by cdf2 ( fig 4b ) .
we also observed that the levels of cdf2 and mirnas in plants expressing cdf2 - yfp under the control of its endogenous promoter ( pcdf2 : : cdf2 - yfp / col ) were very similar to those in col ( s10a and s10b fig ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005598.g005 fig 5 cdf2 suppresses the posttranscriptional processing of pri - mirnas .
( a ) northern blots show that overexpression of cdf2 reduce the accumulation of mirnas indicated .
( b ) northern blots show that the levels of mir156 and mir172 in p35s : : mir156 / col and p35s : : mir156 / cdf2 or p35s : : mir172 / col and p35s : : mir172 / cdf2 plants .
as cdf2 can affect the accumulation of mirnas at both the transcriptional and post - transcriptional levels , to further test if cdf2 affects the post - transcriptional processing of pri - mirnas or not , we crossed the transgenic lines of p35s : : mir156 / col and p35s : : mir172 / col with the cdf2 mutant , then compared the accumulation levels of mirna156 in p35s : : mir156 / col and p35s : : mir156 / cdf2 plants by northern blot ( the mir156 transcripts were similar to each other in these two lines as shown in s11 fig ) , and found that the accumulation level of mir156 is lower in p35s : : mir156 / col than that in p35s : : mir156 / cdf2 ( fig 5b ) .
we also compared the levels of mirna172 in p35s : : mir172 / col and p35s : : mir172 / cdf2 ( the mir172 transcripts were similar to each other in these two lines as shown in s11 fig ) , the results showed that the mir172 level is lower in p35s : : mir172 / col than that in p35s : : mir172 / cdf2 ( fig 5b ) , suggesting that cdf2 suppresses the post - transcriptional processing of mirnas , possibly because cdf2 binds to these pri - mirnas regulated by itself at transcriptional level ( fig 4b ) , and cdf2 interacts with dcl1 / hyl1 which might sequester dcl1 / hyl1 , resulting in decreased mirna processing by the dcl1 / hyl1 microprocessor .
in animals , several factors were found to inhibit the activities of drosha and dicer , including adar ( adenosine deaminase acting on rna ) enzymes that participate in adenosine - to - inosine ( a - to - i ) rna editing to prevent effective processing of specific pri - mirnas by drosha [ 31 ] ; estrogen - bound estrogen receptor alpha , which associates with the drosha complex and prevents the conversion of pri - mirnas to pre - mirnas [ 32 ] ; lin28 , which blocks the accumulation of mature mirnas by repression of both drosha and dicer activities [ 33,34,35 ] ; and tut4 , which is recruited by lin28 to specific pri - mirnas , leading to 3 ' terminal uridylation and degradation of pri - mirnas [ 36,37 ] .
mecp2 suppresses mirna processing by binding to the rna - binding domains of human dgcr8 [ 21 ] .
we then investigated the effect of cdf2 on the expressions of components involved in mirna processing .
as shown in s12 fig , compared to those in wild type , the expressions of se , mos2 , cdc5 , tough , ddl , not2 and cpl1 are down - regulated in cdf2 mutant and upregulated in the cdf2 overexpression line , while the effect of cdf2 on the expression of hyl1 and dcl1 is not obviously .
the result implicated that cdf2 might regulate biogenesis of mirnas indirectly by regulating the expressions of mirna processing proteins in addition to its direct roles in transcriptional and post - transcription regulations of pri - mirnas .
similarly , cho et al .
[ 39 ] found that the immensely accumulated dcl1 level in hyl1 - 2 and se - 1 mutants , and the increased level of se in hyl1 - 2 mutant .
it is of interest to investigate the potential feedback regulatory network among components involved in mirna biogenesis .
cdf2 plays a role in flowering through a pathway same as mir156 / mir172 several cdf2 - regulated mirnas are involved in flowering , including mir156 , mir160 , mir167 , mir172 , mir165 / mir166 , and mir319 [ 38 ] , we investigated if mirnas contribute to the earlier flowering phenotype of cdf2 mutant [ 11 ] .
we focused on mir156 and mir172 , two widely studied mirnas [ 40 ] ( s1 table ) .
it was reported that mir156 mutant line flowers earlier and mir172 mutant flowers later [ 38,41 ] , in accordance to the early flowering phenotype of the cdf2 mutant in which the level of mir156 decreases ( s1 table ) and its target squamosa promoter binding protein - like ( spl ) proteins increase ( s13a fig ) , whereas mir172 increases ( s1 table ) and its target ap2 decreases in cdf2 ( s13b fig ) [ 42,43 ] , supporting a role of cdf2 in mirna regulation .
we then first investigated the genetic relationship between cdf2 and mir156 .
to this end , we generated mir156a / mir156c / cdf2 triple mutant and found that the flowering time of this triple mutant flowered not earlier than either cdf2 or mir156a / mir156c lines ( fig 6a , 6c and 6d ) , suggesting that cdf2 and mir156 regulate flowering through the same pathway .
in addition , mir156 overexpression in cdf2 mutant showed the same late flowering phenotype as mir156 overexpression in col ( figs 6a , 6c , 6d , s10 and s13a ) , indicating that mir156 acts genetically downstream of cdf2 to regulate flowering .
next , we overexpressed mir172 in cdf2 mutant and found that this overexpression line ( p35s : : mir172 / cdf2 ) did not display earlier flowering phenotype than cdf2 mutant or mir172 overexpressed line in col ( figs 6b - 6d , s10 and s13b ) , suggesting that cdf2 and mir172 regulate flowering through the same signaling pathway .
together , these results indicated the role of cdf2 in mir156 activation and mir172 suppression which participate in the flowering time control .
we next generated cdf2 / hyl1 double mutants , we found that the flowering of cdf2 / hyl1 - 2 plants was similar to the hyl1 - 2 single mutant [ 11,44 ] ( s14a - s14c fig ) , suggesting that cdf2 and hyl1 regulate flowering through the same pathway .
cdf2 was reported to be a transcriptional repressor of constans ( co ) to control flowering , our results thus revealed a new pathway for regulating the flowering through cdf2 and mirnas which might be independent of co .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1005598.g006 fig 6 cdf2 is in the same pathway as mir156 and mir172 to regulate flowering .

in summary , we have revealed the previously unknown roles of cdf2 in the transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation of a subset of pri - mirnas .
at the transcriptional level , cdf2 works as a transcription activator or repressor to regulate the transcription of a group of mirna genes .
we also found that cdf2 interacts with dcl1 and preferentially binds to the pri - mirnas regulated transcriptionally by itself in vivo , which might affect the binding of dcl1 to pri - mirnas or sequester the microprocessor dcl1 / hyl1 , resulting in the influence on pri - mirna processing. by transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation of a group pri - mirnas , cdf2 may precisely regulate a population of mirnas to maintain proper development of the plants through the coordination of transcription and processing of a group of pri - mirnas .
in addition , cdf2 was found to regulate the expressions of components involved in mirna biogenesis , therefore it may affect mirna biogenesis through regulating the levels of these components .
cdf2 was known to interact with blue light photoreceptor lkp2 and fkf1 and contribute to blue light signaling [ 18 ] , it is therefore particularly interesting to study the roles of mirnas in light signaling pathways which was implicated in a recent study showing that the e3 ligase cop1 essential for light signaling stabilizes hyl1 to retain mirna biogenesis [ 39 ] .

steroid - associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head remains a challenging problem in orthopedics worldwide .
one pathomechanism is ischemia of the femoral head , as a result of thrombus formation and vasoconstriction .
the present study investigates the effects of combination prevention with enoxaparin and egb 761 on steroid - associated onfh in rabbits .
rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups ( control group , model group , enoxaparin group , ginkgo group , and combination group ). with the exception of the control group , the groups of rabbits were modeled with lipopolysaccharide and methylprednisolone acetate .
starting with modeling , the enoxaparin group and ginkgo group were injected with 1 mug / kg / day enoxaparin subcutaneously and orally given 40 mg / kg / day egb 761 for 4 weeks , respectively ; the combination group received both treatments .
after modeling for 6 weeks , the hematology data indicated prolonged pt and aptt in the three prevention groups .
the micro - ct examination revealed higher bone density and better structure ; histomorphometry revealed significant pathological changes .
immunohistochemistry revealed higher expression of bmp - 2 and vegf , thus revealing better osteogenesis and angiogenesis activities .
among the three prevention groups , the combination group had the most efficient results .
in conclusion , the combined prevention with an anticoagulant and a vasodilator has the potential to decrease the incidence of steroid - associated onfh in rabbits .

introduction osteonecrosis of the femoral head ( onfh ) has been reported to occur in patients who undergo long - term or heavy glucocorticoid use as a treatment for underlying diseases , such as systemic lupus erythematosus , nephrotic syndrome , and renal transplantation [ 1 ] .
onfh , as a progressive and degenerative bone disease , leads to the collapse of the femoral head , which subsequently destroys the hip joint and affects the patient 's activities [ 2 ] .
one of the most common treatment options for patients with advanced onfh is total hip replacement .
however , steroid - associated onfh tends to occur in individuals aged 30 - 50 y , and the joint prosthesis is not sufficiently durable for younger patients with steroid - associated onfh [ 3 , 4 ] .
effective nonsurgical treatment in the early stages of onfh would be preferable to total hip replacement .
the precise pathogenesis of steroid - associated onfh remains unclear .
several possible factors relating to the pathogenesis of onfh have been suggested on the basis of both human and animal studies , including coagulation abnormalities , hyperlipidemia , endothelial dysfunction , and oxidative stress [ 5 - 9 ] .
these factors have been thought to be related to an interruption of the bone vascular circulation and to result in bone ischemia .
moreover , many experimental studies have revealed that glucocorticoids directly injure endothelial cells , thus resulting in vasoconstriction , disturbance of the coagulation - fibrinolysis system , and thrombus formation in the femoral head , which consequently decrease the blood circulation of the trabecular bone and finally lead to onfh [ 10 , 11 ] .
therefore , maintaining the blood circulation of the femoral head is likely to be an effective measure to prevent steroid - associated onfh .
an insufficient blood circulation to the femoral head is likely caused by thrombus formation and vasoconstriction [ 12 , 13 ] .
in the present study , enoxaparin , a low molecular weight heparin , was used as an anticoagulant to prevent thrombosis .
glueck et al. , in a human pilot study , have demonstrated that enoxaparin prevents the progression of ficat stages i and ii osteonecrosis of the hip associated with thrombophilia or hypofibrinolysis or both [ 14 ] .
in a rat model of mechanical induced osteonecrosis generated by incising the periosteum of the neck and cutting the ligamentum teres , enoxaparin has an anticoagulant effect preventing the occurrence of osteonecrosis [ 15 ] .
enoxaparin treatment , when simultaneously administered with high dose glucocorticoid in rabbits , decreases empty lacunae and necrotic osteocytes [ 12 ] .
extracts of ginkgo biloba leaves ( egb 761 ) have effects including dilating blood vessels , preventing thrombus formation , decreasing levels of blood lipids , scavenging free radicals , and preventing lipid peroxidation [ 16 ] .
it has been widely used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and peripheral blood vessel diseases [ 17 , 18 ] .
egb 761 induces the relaxation of the rat thoracic aorta and is associated with an increase in endothelial intracellular calcium levels [ 19 ] .
in in vivo experiments after induction with a high cholesterol diet ( hcd ) , egb 761 improved endothelial function by lowering total plasma cholesterol levels in hamsters [ 20 ] .
the effects of either an anticoagulant or a vasodilator alone to prevent glucocorticoid - associated onfh have recently been assessed .
in this study , the model of glucocorticoid - associated onfh was established in rabbits and we used combined treatment with an anticoagulant ( enoxaparin ) and a vasodilator ( egb 761 ) , which prevented the development of glucocorticoid - associated onfh more effectively than either treatment alone in rabbits .
we also evaluated how enoxaparin and egb 761 influenced hematological parameters .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
animals adult male healthy new zealand white rabbits weighing 2.5 - 3.5 kg were purchased from dalian medical university in dalian , china .
all of the procedures were conducted according to the care and use of laboratory animals guidelines established by the national institutes of health ; rabbits were housed in conventional cages and a standard laboratory diet and water were maintained .
before the experiment , the rabbits were acclimated for 1 week .
2.2 .
drugs and chemicals enoxaparin ( clexane , sanofi , france ) and egb 761 ( ginaton , germany ) were purchased from the affiliated zhongshan hospital of dalian university ( dalian , china ) .
the egb 761 used in our study was standardized to 9.6 mg ginkgo flavone glycosides and 2.4 mg terpene lactones ( ginkgolides , bilobalide ) .
2.3 .
experimental design rabbits were divided into 5 groups and were processed as follows .
control group ( n = 6 ) : it was the normal group ; rabbits were given equal volumes of saline .
model group ( n = 6 ) : rabbits were intravenously injected with 10 mug / kg lipopolysaccharide ( sigma , usa ) and then injected intramuscularly with 20 mg / kg of methylprednisolone acetate ( pfizer , usa ) 3 times with a time interval of 24 h to construct the model .
the steroid - associated onfh rabbit model was prepared using a previously published inductive protocol [ 21 ] .
enoxaparin group ( n = 6 ) : model rabbits received only enoxaparin ( subcutaneous injection , 1 mug / kg / day ) for 4 weeks .
ginkgo group ( n = 6 ) : model rabbits received only egb 761 ( oral administration , 40 mg / kg / day ) for 4 weeks .
combination group ( n = 6 ) : model rabbits received enoxaparin ( subcutaneous injection , 1 mug / kg / day ) combined with egb 761 ( oral administration , 40 mg / kg / day ) for 4 weeks .
six weeks later , the rabbits were sacrificed , and the femoral heads of the rabbits in each group were obtained and assessed with micro - ct scanning and histopathology and immunohistochemistry analyses .
2.4 .
coagulation measurement blood samples were collected from the marginal ear veins while the animals were in a fasting state .
the samples were obtained in the early morning at week 6 after the methylprednisolone injection .
the platelet free plasma was used to determine the prothrombin time ( pt ) and the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) .
2.5 .
micro - ct assay all femoral head samples were scanned with an inveon micro - ct manufactured by siemens ( berlin , germany ) with mid - high resolution .
the scanning protocol was 80 kv and 500 mua , with an effective pixel size of 15.48 mum .
a volume of interest ( voi ) was selected from these regions for three - dimensional reconstruction , and the following bone parameters were analyzed : ct value , bone volume / total volume ( bv / tv ) , trabecular thickness ( tb.th , mm ) , and trabecular spacing ( tb.sp , mm ) .
2.6 .
tissue sample preparation the rabbits were euthanized at 6 weeks .
the femoral heads from both sides were harvested .
the femoral heads were fixed in 4 % neutral paraformaldehyde solution for 7 days and decalcified in 10 % ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ) buffer ( ph = 7.2 ) .
the edta buffer was replaced every 7 days .
the degree of decalcification was measured using micro - ct. the femoral head was gradually dehydrated using dimethyl benzene and embedded in paraffin after 8 weeks of decalcification .
the paraffin block was cut into 4 - mm - thick sections and glued onto microslides pretreated with polylysine .
the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) .
2.7 .
evaluation of steroid - associated onfh the osteonecrotic changes and repair processes in steroid - treated rabbits were observed by histopathological examination using a light microscope six weeks after modeling .
the slides were evaluated in a blinded fashion by three independent observers .
the evaluation criteria for osteonecrosis were based on a report by yamamoto et al .
[ 22 ] .
osteonecrosis was deemed to be present when there was necrosis of medullary hematopoietic cells or fat cells or there were empty lacunae or condensed nuclei in osteocytes .
the number of empty lacunae in five random regions in each section ( 5 sections in each group ) was counted and the percentage of empty lacunae was calculated .
2.8 .
immunohistochemistry to analyze the angiogenesis and osteogenic potential in the femoral head , immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies specific for vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) ( mouse antibody , dilution 1 : 200 , abcam , cambridge , ma , uk ) and bone morphogenetic protein - 2 ( bmp - 2 ) ( mouse antibody , dilution 1 : 100 , abcam , cambridge , ma , uk ) .
briefly , sections were immersed in 3 % hydrogen peroxide in 0.01 m phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity and then were rinsed several times in pbs .
after being blocked with 10 % goat normal antiserum ( solarbio , beijing , china ) for 30 min at room temperature , sections were treated with a primary antibody overnight at 4degreesc and incubated with the hrp - conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min .
to reveal the immunoreactivity ( ir ) , the sections were then reacted with diaminobenzidine solution in the dark .
finally , the sections were treated with hematoxylin and mounted .
the sections without primary antibody processing were used as negative controls .
each test was repeated 3 times .
the sections were observed and photographed .
imagepro plus 6.0 software was used to analyze quantitatively and to calculate the mean density .
five random regions in each section ( 3 sections in each group ) were selected and the mean density was calculated as the ratio of iod to the selected area .
2.9 .
statistical analysis data were analyzed using graphpad prism 6.0 statistical software and are expressed as the means +/ - sem .
a one - way anova was used to analyze the significant differences among the different groups .
comparisons between two groups were performed with tukey tests .
p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between groups .
3. results 3.1 .
coagulation analysis to investigate the coagulation state of the model group and the potential effects of enoxaparin and egb 761 , the coagulation states were evaluated by measuring the pt and aptt .
in the model group , pt was 6.90 +/ - 0.33 s , significantly lower than that of the control group ( 8.32 +/ - 0.33 s , p = 0.0106 < 0.05 ) , which showed hypercoagulability of the femoral heads .
compared with model group , enoxaparin group and ginkgo group resulted in a prolongation of pt but not significant , which was 7.82 +/ - 0.23 s ( p = 0.1662 ) and 7.30 +/ - 0.19 s ( p = 0.8436 ) , respectively ; the combination group showed the best results : the pt reached 8.08 +/ - 0.27 s , representing a significant prolongation compared with model group ( p = 0.0418 < 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ( a )) .
the effect on aptt is shown in figure 1 ( b ) .
neither enoxaparin nor ginkgo caused significant prolongation in aptt , which was 21.47 +/ - 1.44 s ( p = 0.7625 ) and 24.12 +/ - 1.56 s ( p = 0.9321 ) , respectively , compared with that in the model group ( 20.15 +/ - 1.89 s ) .
the aptt of the combination group was 29.80 +/ - 0.76 s ( p = 0.0084 < 0.01 ) , significantly lower than the model group , and was closest to the control group ( 33.15 +/ - 1.89 s ) .
3.2 .
micro - ct micro - ct images indicated that the trabecular bone was sparser and more disordered in the subchondral bone in the model group compared with the control group ( figure 2 ) .
the ct value , mean rate value of bone volume and total volume ( bv / tv ) , and trabecular thickness ( tb.th ) in the model group were all lower than those in the control group , whereas the trabecular spacing ( tb.sp ) was higher .
the data from the trabecular bone showed changes in the three prevention groups .
the ct value in the combination group ( 1546 +/ - 20.50 ) was significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) than that in the model group ( 1291 +/ - 59.46 ) .
the bt / tv in the combination group ( 0.66 +/ - 0.09 ) was significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) than that in the model group ( 0.51 +/ - 0.04 ) .
the tb.th was greater ( p < 0.05 ) in the combination group ( 0.18 +/ - 0.01 mm ) than in the model group ( 0.14 +/ - 0.02 mm ) .
the tb.sp was lower ( p < 0.05 ) in the combination group ( 0.087 +/ - 0.007 mm ) than in the model group ( 0.12 +/ - 0.013 mm ) ( figure 3 ) .
3.3 .
histology histological examinations revealed that the typical early stage of osteonecrosis was observed in the model group .
the trabecular bone displayed a disordered structure , which appeared thinner and sparser , the fracture of trabecular bone led to the formation of necrotic bone tissue , and the trabecular space was larger .
in addition , osteoclasts were observed , and the apoptosis of osteocytes led to the appearance of more empty lacunae ( 30.63 +/ - 12.11 %) accompanied by local bone marrow cell necrosis or myelofibrosis ; hypertrophic fat cells and the adipose area in bone marrow were increased .
in the enoxaparin and ginkgo groups , compared with the model group , the trabecular bone ranged regularly , and fewer empty lacunae were observed , 18.72 +/ - 6.23 % ( p = 0.038 < 0.05 ) and 19.08 +/ - 4.63 % ( p = 0.046 < 0.05 ) , respectively .
in the enoxaparin and ginkgo groups , hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow cavity were rich , and osteoclasts were not found .
there were no obvious pathological changes appearing in the combination group , and the ratio of empty lacunae is 13.22 +/ - 3.45 ( p = 0.0012 < 0.01 ) compared with the model group ( figure 4 ) .
3.4 .
immunohistochemistry the expression of angiogenic factors including vegf and osteogenic factors including bmp - 2 in the femoral heads from each group was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining and quantitative analysis .
the appearance of a yellow brown substance indicated positive staining ( a , e ) .
the model group showed slight bmp - 2 ( figures 5 ( a ) and 5 ( i )) immunoreactivity and vegf ( figures 5 ( b ) and 5 ( j )) immunoreactivity in the bone tissue .
in the enoxaparin group and ginkgo group , increased bmp - 2 ( figures 5 ( b ) , 5 ( c ) , and 5 ( i )) and vegf ( figures 5 ( f ) , 5 ( g ) , and 5 ( j )) expression levels were observed .
the combination group showed significant increased expressions of bmp - 2 ( figures 5 ( d ) and 5 ( i )) and vegf ( figures 5 ( h ) and 5 ( j )) compared with the model group , especially in the bone marrow .
4. discussion in this study , we successfully constructed a model of early stage steroid - associated onfh in rabbits , which was based on the osteonecrosis model established by qin et al .
[ 21 ] .
only early stage changes of onfh appeared ; there was no subchondral bone collapse demonstrated in this model or pathogenetic changes of steroid - associated onfh in rabbits similar to those observed in human onfh .
but rabbits do not walk upright , so the model can not completely simulate the load bearing of human femoral head .
we used this model to detect whether the combined applications of enoxaparin and egb 761 could be used as a preventive therapy against steroid - associated onfh .
glucocorticoids led to osteonecrosis in the femoral head , as demonstrated by the increased number of empty lacunae and necrotic osteocytes .
the simultaneous administration of enoxaparin and egb 761 in the osteonecrosis model prolonged blood coagulation time and decreased the number of necrotic osteocytes and empty osteocyte lacunae , as compared with the model group .
this result suggested that enoxaparin and egb 761 prevent steroid - associated onfh effects on circulation and bone by improving hypercoagulability .
steroid - associated onfh is closely related to hypercoagulability .
reports have suggested that intravascular coagulation ( ic ) , as an intermediary mechanism caused by hypercoagulability and intraosseous fat embolism , is the most common pathway leading to nontraumatic on [ 23 ] .
the altered fat metabolism could increase serum lipid levels ( triglyceride and cholesterol ) and a fat embolism resulted in vascular occlusion which accelerated the ischemia .
it is reported that the inhibition of both thrombosis and lipid deposition could reduce the incidence of steroid - associated onfh .
hematologic evidence of intraosseous hypercoagulability has been found on the basis of both human and animal studies of on [ 24 , 25 ] .
hypercoagulability , a pathological process mediated by a variety of factors and hematological changes , plays an important role in the process of thrombus formation [ 26 ] .
moreover , steroid treatment enhances hypercoagulability , induces venous thrombosis , decreases blood circulation , and leads to onfh [ 27 , 28 ] .
consistent with this idea , blood flow reduction in the femoral head and hypercoagulability of plasma have been observed in a swine model after 24 h of steroid treatment [ 29 ] .
likewise , high dose steroid administration in a rabbit model has been found to potentiate the magnitude of osteonecrosis by increasing hypercoagulability , which subsequently induces thrombus formation [ 30 ] .
additionally , steroids are known to modulate other vasoactive mediators .
they facilitate the expression of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin - 1 [ 31 ] and suppress the production of vasodilators such as bradykinin , prostacyclin , and nitric oxide [ 32 - 34 ] .
hence , steroids enhance the constriction of femoral head arteries by modulating vascular responsiveness to vasoactive substances .
vasoconstriction causes a decrease in femoral head blood flow and exacerbates the hypercoagulability in the femoral head [ 9 ] .
hypercoagulability or vasoconstriction induced by steroids contributes to femoral head ischemia , thus ultimately leading to onfh .
therefore , maintaining the blood circulation in the femoral head is necessary to prevent steroid - associated onfh .
our study demonstrated administration of high dose steroids - associated onfh in rabbits .
we observed signs of early osteonecrosis in the model group .
the micro - ct result showed that the ct value , bv / tv , and tb.th decreased significantly , whereas the tb.sp increased significantly in the model group .
moreover , histopathological examination also showed that the trabecular structure was disordered and that the number of empty lacunae was increased in the model group .
at the same time , we also detected coagulation parameters , pt and aptt .
the pt ( p < 0.05 ) and aptt ( p < 0.001 ) in the model group were significantly lower than those in the control group at 6 weeks after steroid administration .
pt and aptt are performance indicators reflecting the efficiency of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways .
the shortening of pt and aptt reflects a hypercoagulable blood state and a tendency toward thrombosis .
therefore , our study showed that steroids cause hypercoagulability , thereby promoting thrombosis and femoral head ischemia , and finally leading to onfh .
these results are consistent with findings from previous studies [ 30 ] .
drops of ginkgo biloba leaf extract have many pharmacological effects .
the extract promotes a maintenance of arterial and venous vascular tone via stimulation of catecholamine release and inhibition of degradation , together with an arterial relaxant effect via stimulation of prostacyclin and endothelium - derived relaxing factor production [ 35 ] .
this extract has widely been used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and peripheral vascular diseases [ 17 , 18 , 36 ] .
however , the use of this extract in the prevention of onfh has rarely been reported [ 37 ] .
it not only leads to the vasodilation of blood vessels but also promotes osteogenesis [ 20 ] .
oral administration of egb 761 has been found to restore bone mineral density and microstructure in aged ovariectomized rats [ 38 ] .
egb 761 has been found to promote osteoblast genesis and to decrease bone marrow adipogenesis [ 39 ] .
on the basis of the effects of the extract of ginkgo biloba leaf drops , we chose egb 761 as a vasodilator to relieve steroid - associated vasoconstriction .
in addition , enoxaparin was chosen as an anticoagulant to prevent steroid - associated thrombosis , on the basis of previous clinical studies [ 14 ] and animal studies [ 12 ] .
the results of this study showed that pt and aptt were prolonged slightly more in the enoxaparin group and ginkgo group , but there were no significant differences compared with the model group .
when we simultaneously administered enoxaparin and egb 761 to the high dose steroid group , pt ( p < 0.05 ) and aptt ( p < 0.01 ) showed a significant prolongation , as compared with the model group .
bone repair was evaluated by micro - ct scanning and he staining .
micro - ct scanning indicated that the combination group had more new bone formation and better microstructural parameters than the model group , a result further confirmed by he staining .
the results of this study preliminarily showed that the combined effects of enoxaparin and egb 761 prevent steroid - associated onfh by improving hypercoagulability in rabbits .
the local expression levels of bmp - 2 and vegf were detected in this study .
bmp - 2 has an important and significant role in inducing osteogenesis , the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the femoral head in response to necrosis .
studies have demonstrated that the content of bmp - 2 reflects the bone formation ability of osteoblasts [ 40 ] .
the main functions of vegf are to promote the regeneration of blood vessels by mitosis of vascular endothelial cells and to increase vascular permeability [ 41 ] .
in addition , vegf has been reported to promote bone repair and bone regeneration in part by inducing angiogenesis [ 42 ] .
glucocorticoid decreases the expression of bmp - 2 , thereby inhibiting the maturity of osteoblasts and slowing the process of bone formation [ 43 ] .
meanwhile , it decreases the expression of vegf and disrupts the process of vascularization and the growth of new blood vessels in the necrotic bone [ 44 ] .
in our study , immunohistochemical results showed that the expression of bmp - 2 and vegf in the femoral heads significantly increased in the combination group .
this finding demonstrated that the combined applications of enoxaparin and ginkgo enhanced angiogenesis and maintained bone structure by improving hypercoagulability , which in turn prevented the occurrence of steroid - associated onfh in rabbits .
thus , these results showed that the combined application of an anticoagulant ( enoxaparin ) and a vasodilator ( egb 761 ) can prevent or delay the progression of the early stages of steroid - associated onfh .
although this treatment cannot completely stop the progression of steroid - associated osteonecrosis , it appears to enhance angiogenesis - osteogenesis in femoral heads .
although no bleeding site was found in the experiment , possible systemic side effect of enoxaparin or ginkgo may not have been controlled well and may thus have resulted in a risk for bleeding .
thus , more tests should be made to verify and evaluate the risk of bleeding before this preventive therapy could apply clinically in human steroid - associated osteonecrosis of femoral head .
in addition , precise molecular mechanisms of this prevention method should be clarified in the future .
in summary , this study indicated that the combined administration of enoxaparin and egb 761 enhances angiogenesis and bone repair by improving hypercoagulability associated with early stage onfh in a rabbit model and may provide an efficient , inexpensive , and simple therapy to prevent early stage onfh .

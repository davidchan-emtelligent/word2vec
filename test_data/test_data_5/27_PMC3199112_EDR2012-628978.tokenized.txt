1. introduction the prevalence of diabetes mellitus has been increasing worldwide during recent years , and this is estimated to continue in the future [ 1 , 2 ] .
diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus and is the most common cause of end - stage renal disease [ 3 , 4 ] .
the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its complications , including diabetic nephropathy , has therefore become a major health problem worldwide .
there is now an urgent need to identify new therapeutic target molecules or cellular processes that underlie the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy to establish an additional therapeutic option .
hyperglycemia - mediated alteration of extra - and intracellular metabolism , such as advanced glycation end products [ 5 ] , increased protein kinase c activity [ 6 ] , and abnormal polyol metabolism [ 7 ] , has been recognized as classical pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
in addition , intracellular stress associated with renal hypoxia [ 8 , 9 ] , mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 10 - 13 ] , and endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress [ 14 - 16 ] has recently been proposed and focused as new pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
thus , to maintain the cellular homeostasis against stress condition derived from organelle dysfunction or hypoxia may be a new therapeutic target of diabetic nephropathy .
autophagy , a lysosomal protein degradation pathway in cells , plays a crucial role in removing protein aggregates as well as damaged or excess organelles to maintain intracellular homeostasis and cell integrity [ 17 ] .
it has recently been highlighted because it can be stimulated by multiple types of cellular stressors including starvation , hypoxia , or er stress .
the study of autophagy in mammalian systems and in disease states is advancing rapidly , and many investigators are entering this new and exciting field ( figure 1 ) .
it has been revealed that autophagy plays a crucial role in several organs , especially in metabolic organs , and that its alteration is involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic [ 18 - 21 ] and age - related diseases [ 22 - 27 ] .
the functional role of autophagy in the kidneys is currently under intense investigation ( figure 1 ) , and it has been revealed that autophagy has a renoprotective role in several animal models including those used for aging and acute kidney injury [ 26 - 31 ] .
however , the role of autophagy in diabetic nephropathy remains unclear .
alteration of several nutrient - sensing pathways is related to the development of metabolic diseases , such as type 2 diabetes and its vascular complications .
major nutrient - sensing pathway involves the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) [ 32 - 35 ] , amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) , [ 36 - 40 ] and oxidized nad - ( nad + - ) dependent histone deacetylase ( sirt1 ) [ 41 - 43 ] , which are also recognized as the regulatory factors of autophagy under nutrient - depleted condition .
as described above , autophagy can be induced by intracellular stresses that are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy [ 44 ] .
thus , alteration of these nutrient - sensing pathways under diabetic condition may impair the autophagic stress response stimulated by intracellular stress , which may lead to exacerbation of organelle dysfunction and subsequent diabetic nephropathy .
the above findings lead us to hypothesize that autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and is a potential therapeutic option .
therefore , we provide a systematic review of autophagy and discuss its therapeutic potency in diabetic nephropathy to help future investigations in this field .
2. autophagy the term autophagy is derived from greek and means self - eating .
it is highly conserved from yeast to mammals and is a bulk degradation process that is involved in the clearance of long - lived proteins and organelles .
autophagy has two major roles in cells : to recycle intracellular energy resources in response to nutrient - depleted conditions and to remove cytotoxic proteins and organelles under stressful conditions .
autophagy works to maintain cell homeostasis under various stressful conditions .
several types of autophagy have been recognized in cells : macroautophagy , microautophagy , and chaperone - mediated autophagy ; these differ in their mechanisms and functions [ 45 , 46 ]. of these three types of autophagy , macroautophagy is most prevalent and hereafter is referred to as autophagy .
in this paper , we focus on the mechanisms and functions of autophagy .
3. molecular mechanisms of autophagy during macroautophagy , de novo isolation membranes ( phagophores ) elongate and fuse while engulfing a portion of the cytoplasm within double - membraned vesicles ( autophagosomes ) ( figure 2 ) .
several origins of autophagosomes have been reported , including the er [ 47 - 49 ] , mitochondria [ 50 ] , and plasma membrane [ 51 ] .
four major steps are involved in the formation of autophagosomes : initiation , nucleation , elongation , and closure .
during these steps , autophagy - related proteins are involved ( figure 2 ) .
autophagy is initiated by the unc - 51 - like kinase ( ulk ) 1 ( mammalian ortholog of the yeast autophagy - related genes ( atg ) 1 ) complex , which is composed of ulk1 ser / thr protein kinase , atg13 , and fip200 ( mammalian homolog of the yeast atg17 ) [ 52 - 54 ] .
the phosphorylation of atg13 and fip200 by ulk1 is essential for triggering autophagy .
phagophore nucleation is dependent on beclin 1 ( atg6 in yeast ) - - an hvps34 or class iii phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) complex , which consists of hvps34 , hvps15 , beclin 1 , and atg14 [ 55 , 56 ] .
during autophagosome elongation / closure , two dependent ubiquitin - like conjugation systems are involved : atg12 and lc3 ( the mammalian ortholog of the yeast atg8 ) [ 57 ] .
the atg12 - atg5 conjugate , which forms the atg12 - atg5 - atg16 complex , contributes to the stimulation and localization of the lc3 conjugation reaction .
the cytosolic isoform of lc3 ( lc3 - i ) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine through two consecutive ubiquitination - like reactions that are catalyzed by e1 - like enzyme atg7 and the e2 - like enzyme atg3 to form lc3 - ii [ 58 ] .
thus , lc3 - ii formation is recognized as a marker of existence of autophagosomes in cell or animal experiments [ 59 - 61 ] .
after formation , the autophagosomes merge with the lysosomal compartment to form autolysosomes .
the protein p62 , also known as sequestosome 1 ( sqstm1 ) , is known to localize to autophagosomes via lc3 interaction and to be constantly degraded by the autophagy - lysosome system [ 62 , 63 ] .
the accumulation of p62 is observed in autophagy - deficient cells [ 62 , 63 ] .
4. methods available for monitoring autophagy it is necessary to keep in mind several important points as we monitor and assess the autophagy activity to prevent misconceptions .
some reviews about the methods for autophagy research have been published [ 59 - 61 ] .
as briefly below summarized , some methods including electron microscopy ( em ) , detection of endogenous lc3 or green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) - lc3 by fluorescence microscopy , and detection of lc3 - ii by western blotting are useful in monitoring the number of autophagosomes .
however , these methods have some limitations .
an accumulation of autophagosomes does not always mean increased formation of autophagosomes and may represent inhibited maturation of autolysosomes ( or amphisomes ) .
simply counting the number of autophagosomes is insufficient for assessing autophagy activity .
autophagy flux is a term that represents a serial process of autophagy , including the synthesis of autophagosomes , the delivery of cargo to lysosomes , and the degradation of autolysosomes .
to distinguish whether the accumulation of autophagosomes is caused by induction of autophagy or inhibition of autophagosome maturation and / or degradation of autophagic substrates in the lysosome , and then assess autophagy activity , an autophagy flux assay is more reliable than counting the number of autophagosomes .
there are some useful assays to monitor autophagy flux .
these include the lc3 turnover assay , or measurement of total levels of autophagic substrates such as lc3 , gfp - lc3 , and p62 .
furthermore , several types of autophagy inhibitors and activators have recently become available to modulate the activity of autophagy processes .
pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy are pi3 - kinase inhibitors such as wortmannin , ly294002 , or 3 - methladenine ( 3 - ma ) and inhibitors that block autophagosome - lysosome fusion or degradation of autophagic cargo in autolysosomes , such as e64d , pepstatin a , and bafilomycin a. however , a major problem is that there are no highly specific inhibitors or activators of autophagy .
thus , it is strongly recommended that pharmacological studies should be combined with studies that investigate deficiency / reduction of autophagy - related genes by genetic knockout / knockdown of atg genes or dominant - negative mutant autophagy proteins , including atg3 , atg5 , atg7 , and beclin 1 .
5. role of nutrient stress in autophagy and diabetic nephropathy the kidney is a structurally complex organ and is essential in several functions including excretion of the waste products of metabolism , regulation of body fluid volume , maintenance of appropriate acid balance , and secretion of a variety of hormones .
the basic unit of the kidney is the nephron , which consists of a glomerulus and a series of tubules lined by a continuous layer of epithelial cells ( figure 3 ) .
the glomerulus consists of mesangial cells and a capillary wall with endothelial cells , glomerular basement membrane , and visceral epithelial cells ( podocytes ) ( figure 3 ) .
among them , since podocytes play essential role to maintain glomerular filtration barrier , podocyte injury leads to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis , which are major features of diabetic nephropathy .
podocytes are terminally differentiated cells with a limited proliferative capacity .
therefore , the fate of podocyte depends on its ability to cope with stress .
excess fluid filtered through glomerulus enters urinary space and is reabsorbed by the proximal tubular cells ( figure 3 ) .
the proximal tubular cells serve as a system to degrade several molecules reabsorbed from urinary space .
thus , autophagy may be essential to maintain their homeostasis and functions in both podocytes and proximal tubular cells , which might be altered in diabetic condition .
if autophagy system is altered in diabetic condition , this alteration of autophagy may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
as expected , autophagy has been identified in both podocytes and proximal tubular cells and is regulated by a variety of stimuli including nutrient stress .
nutrient depletion is the most potent physiological inducer of autophagy , among several that have been reported to regulate autophagy .
here , we show the roles of mtor , ampk , and sirt1 , in the regulation of autophagy .
the alteration of these pathways is involved in the pathogenesis of several kidney diseases including diabetic nephropathy .
5.1 .
mtor several studies have shown that hyperactivation of the mtor pathway in diabetic nephropathy plays a pivotal role in the hypertrophy of existing glomerular and tubular cells [ 64 , 65 ] and is associated with podocyte injury and the progressive decline of glomerular filtration rates .
other studies have suggested that inhibition of the mtorc1 pathway with rapamycin has renoprotective effects on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in models of type 1 [ 33 ] and type 2 diabetes [ 32 , 66 - 69 ] .
some reports have shown the additive renoprotective effects of rapamycin treatment including prevention of mesangial expansion and glomerular membrane thickness in type 1 diabetic rats [ 33 ] and attenuation of increased glomerular expression of laminin - beta1 protein in type 2 diabetic mice [ 32 , 67 ] .
it has been reported that activation of the mtor pathway is involved in the increased expression of profibrotic cytokines , such as tgf - beta1 and connective tissue growth factor , and subsequent interstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy [ 32 - 34 ] .
furthermore , more recent reports have shown that mtorc1 activity is essential to maintain podocyte homeostasis , but its hyperactivation is a causes of glomerular lesion of both type 1 and type 2 diabetic nephropathy [ 68 , 69 ] .
complete deletion of podocyte mtorc1 activity in podocyte - specific raptor - deficient mice causes podocyte injury [ 68 ] .
in contrast , podocyte - specific mtorc1 hyperactivation by podocyte - specific tuberous sclerosis complex ( tsc ) 1 - knockout mice show podocyte injury and glomerular lesion similar to diabetic nephropathy [ 69 ] .
finally , podocyte - specific raptor - heterozygous mice show partial deletion of mtorc1 activity in podocyte and resistance to the development of diabetic nephropathy in both stz - induced type 1 diabetic mice [ 68 ] and type 2 diabetic db / db mice [ 69 ] .
in addition to the above - mentioned function , inhibition of autophagy is a main role of mtor pathway [ 44 , 58 , 70 ] .
among the several signaling pathways that regulate autophagy in mammalian cells , the classical pathway of serine / threonine kinase , mtor , plays a major role in the negative regulation of autophagy because it integrates signals that are emitted by growth factors , amino acids , glucose , and energy status [ 71 ] .
autophagy is inhibited by the activation of tor under hypernutrient conditions [ 44 , 58 ] .
the mtor pathway involves two functional complexes : mtor complex 1 ( mtorc1 ) and mtorc2 .
mtorc1 , which consists of the mtor catalytic subunit , regulatory associated protein of mtor ( raptor ) , g protein beta - subunit - like protein ( gbetal ) , proline - rich akt substrate of 40 kda ( pras40 ) , and dep domain - containing mtor - interacting protein ( deptor ) [ 72 ] , is sensitive to the immunosuppressant rapamycin [ 73 , 74 ] .
this complex regulates cell growth , metabolism ( by integrating amino acid and growth factor signals ) , energy , and oxygen status [ 75 ] .
the mtorc1 complex suppresses autophagy via phosphorylation and inactivation of ulk1 , an initiator of autophagosome formation [ 76 ] .
although no direct evidences have been provided , hyperactivation of mtor pathway may suppress autophagy in podocyte and tubular cells in diabetic condition .
furthermore , enhanced activity of autophagy may be involved in the renoprotective effects of rapamycin treatment in diabetic nephropathy .
the mtorc2 complex is less sensitive to rapamycin and includes mtor , rapamycin - insensitive companion of mtor ( rictor ) , gbetal , stress - activated protein kinase - interacting protein 1 ( sin1 ) , protein observed with rictor ( protor ) , and deptor [ 75 , 77 ] .
the mtorc2 complex regulates cytoskeletal organization , metabolism , and cell survival [ 75 , 78 , 79 ] .
however , until now , the role of mtorc2 in regulation of autophagy has remained unclear .
5.2 .
ampk ampk is activated under energy - depleted conditions and is likely to be suppressed in diabetic nephropathy .
it has been reported that ampk is inactivated ( decreased phosphorylation of ampk ) in glomeruli and tubules in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic animal models [ 40 , 81 - 84 ] , which are reversed by agents such as metformin and resveratrol along with attenuation of diabetic glomerular and tubular injury [ 40 , 85 , 86 ] .
this introduces the question of how decreases in ampk activity can be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
in type 1 and 2 diabetic kidneys , intrarenal lipid metabolism is altered , which is characterized by enhanced renal lipogenesis and suppressed lipolysis [ 87 - 90 ] .
ampk - mediated phosphorylation inactivates a lipogenic enzyme , acetyl - coa carboxylase , which results in decreased lipogenesis and enhanced lipolysis [ 91 ] .
decreases in renal ampk activity in these mouse models may be a mechanism of altered renal lipid metabolism and subsequent lipotoxicity - associated renal damage .
since ampk can affect various cellular metabolism as wells as lipid metabolism [ 92 , 93 ] , the other molecular mechanism should be involved in ampk - mediated renoprotection .
ampk plays a central role in the integration of several stress stimuli and is a positive regulator of autophagy in response to nutrient - depleted conditions .
ampk monitors the energy status of the cell by sensing its amp / atp ratio [ 93 ] .
several upstream kinases , including liver kinase b1 ( lkb1 ) , calcium / calmodulin kinase kinase ( camkii ) beta , and tgf - beta - activated kinase - 1 ( tak1 ) , can activate ampk by phosphorylating a threonine residue on its catalytic alpha subunit [ 93 ] .
ampk can crosstalk with the mtorc1 signal during multiple steps of autophagy regulation .
ampk induces autophagy by inhibiting mtorc1 activity via phosphorylation of its regulatory - associated proteins [ 44 , 58 , 94 ] .
recent studies have shown that ampk - dependent phosphorylation of ulk1 induces autophagy [ 94 , 95 ] .
a balance between mtorc1 and ampk likely directly regulates ulk1 activity and subsequent autophagy initiation [ 44 ] .
thus , in addition to the above - mentioned mechanism , ampk - mediated induction of autophagy may be involved in its renoprotection .
ampk activation may be linked to autophagy for the maintenance of renal homeostasis in diabetic kidney .
5.3 .
sirt1 sirtuins , the silent information regulator 2 family , were originally identified as nad + - dependent deacetylases in experiments in lower species and consist of seven members , sirt1 - sirt7 , in mammals [ 96 , 97 ] .
sirtuins have been identified as antiaging molecules under calorie - restricted conditions and environmental stress .
some mammalian sirtuins , especially sirt1 , have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of aging , or in the pathogenesis of age - related metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes [ 41 , 42 , 96 ] .
an increase in the intracellular concentration of nad + by caloric restriction can activate sirt1 .
results that demonstrate the role of sirt1 in autophagy are still lacking compared with those for mtor and ampk , but they have recently been increasing .
sirt1 can deacetylate essential autophagic factors such as atg5 , atg7 , and lc3 [ 98 ] and has been shown to induce autophagy .
furthermore , sirt1 deacetylates the transcription factor forkhead box o3a ( foxo3a ) , which leads to enhanced expression of proautophagic bcl2 / adenovirus e1v 19 - kda interacting protein 3 ( bnip3 ) [ 26 ] .
renal expression of sirt1 decreases in type 1 diabetic animal models [ 99 , 100 ] .
also , reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( nadh ) are metabolites of glucose and fatty acids .
thus , nad +/ nadh ratios are decreased in cells under conditions where nutrients are in excess , such as diabetes .
sirt1 - deacetylase activity should decrease in diabetic nephropathy .
although direct renoprotective effects of sirt1 in diabetic nephropathy have yet to be elucidated , sirt1 has shown renoprotective activity in aging kidneys and fibrotic kidney diseases .
the previously mentioned findings lead us to speculate that activation of sirt1 should also have therapeutic efficacy in diabetic nephropathy .
furthermore , sirt1 - induced autophagy activation may contribute to sirt1 - mediated renoprotective effect in diabetic nephropathy .
6. regulation of autophagy by intracellular stress besides nutrient stress , autophagy is upregulated by several intracellular stresses , such as hypoxia , ros , and er stress [ 44 ] .
based on recent reports , this process is probably a compensatory response to maintain cell integrity .
furthermore , these intracellular stresses have recently been focused on as a pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy , in addition to the classical pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
6.1 .
oxidative stress under conditions where nutrients are in excess , such as diabetes and obesity , the production of ros in the kidneys is enhanced by high glucose concentrations [ 101 , 102 ] .
furthermore , high levels of free fatty acids , especially polysaturated fatty acids , also induce ros production in the kidneys [ 88 , 103 ] .
oxidative stress is a by - product of mitochondrial respiration and is associated with cell dysfunction .
actually , a recent report has shown abnormal mitochondrial morphology in diabetic kidney [ 95 , 104 ] , suggesting that diabetic kidney fails to remove damaged mitochondria .
thus , restoring the ability to control mitochondria homeostasis should be a therapeutic target of diabetic nephropathy .
mitochondrial quality control is mediated by mitochondrial autophagy ( mitophagy ) [ 105 ] .
similarly , oxidative stress can induce autophagy to remove damaged mitochondria to protect cells .
thus , autophagy - mediated quality control of mitochondria and subsequent reduction of ros should be essential to protect kidney in diabetic condition .
it has been reported that exogenous hydrogen peroxide activates protein kinase rna - like er kinase ( perk ) , which subsequently phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor - 2alpha , activates atg4 , and inhibits mtor [ 106 ] .
in response to cellular stress or damage , mitochondrial membranes can be permeabilized .
the autophagic recognition of depolarized mitochondria is mediated by a refined voltage sensor , which involves the mitochondrial kinase , phosphatase , and tensin homolog - induced putative kinase 1 .
6.2 .
hypoxia in early - stage diabetic nephropathy , hypoxia is aggravated by manifestations of chronic hyperglycemic abnormalities of red blood cells [ 107 , 108 ] , oxidative stress [ 109 ] , and diabetes mellitus - induced tubular apoptosis ; as such , tubulointerstitial hypoxia in diabetes mellitus might be an important early event .
hypoxia is also a stimulatory factor of autophagy .
hypoxia - induced autophagy largely depends on hypoxia - inducible factor - 1alpha ( hif - 1alpha ) , which is a transcription factor that is activated and stabilized under hypoxic conditions [ 110 , 111 ] .
hif - 1alpha activates transcription of bnip3 and bnip3l and subsequently induces autophagy .
normally , beclin 1 interacts with bcl - 2 proteins .
bnip3 can disrupt this interaction , liberating beclin 1 from bcl - 2 in cells and leading to autophagy .
thus , hif1alpha - induced bnip3 overexpression promotes autophagy [ 112 ] .
the transcription of bnip3 is also upregulated by the transcription factor foxo3 , which is deacetylated and positively regulated by sirt1 [ 26 ] .
hypoxia causes damage to the mitochondria and intracellular accumulation of ros [ 113 ] .
removing the damaged mitochondria under hypoxic conditions is also an important role of bnip3 - mediated autophagy .
thus , to investigate whether hypoxia - induced and sirt1 - mediated autophagy is altered in diabetic kidney is interesting .
if it is altered , to restore autophagy activity even under diabetic condition should be important to protect kidney form hypoxia .
6.3 .
er stress er stress has recently been focused as a pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
the induction of er stress and subsequent apoptosis by hyperglycemia and high levels of free fatty acids ( polysaturated fatty acids ) are observed in podocytes [ 114 ] .
additionally , in proteinuric kidney diseases , including diabetic nephropathy , massive proteinuria filtered from glomeruli causes er stress responses and subsequent apoptosis in renal tubular cells [ 14 , 115 ] .
thus , to suppress inadequate er stress is thought as a therapeutic strategy of diabetic nephropathy .
it is known that er stress as well as hypoxia and ros also cause autophagy .
the er is not only involved in protein synthesis and maturation but may also constitute a major source / scaffold for the autophagic isolation membrane [ 47 ] .
when misfolded proteins are not exported efficiently to the cytoplasm and accumulate in the er , the unfolded protein response ( upr ) is often induced [ 116 - 118 ] .
the upr consists of three main branches that are controlled by the er membrane proteins : perk ; activating transcription factor - 6 ( atf6 ) ; inositol requiring enzyme 1 ( ire1 ) [ 116 - 118 ] .
among these upr - related proteins , perk and atf6 have been reported to induce autophagy [ 44 ] .
perk induces the transcriptional activation of lc3 and atg5 through the action of the transcription factors atf4 and ccaat - enhancer - binding protein homologous protein , respectively [ 119 ] .
it has been suggested that ire1 is also involved in the induction of autophagy by phosphorylation of beclin 1 via c - jun nh2 - terminal kinase - 1 [ 44 ] .
enhanced and prolonged er stress causes several pathogenic features such as apoptosis and inflammation [ 117 , 118 ] .
thus , autophagy - mediated er degradation ( erphagy ) may be required for cell protection from prolonged cytotoxic er stress shown in diabetic kidney .
7. autophagy in the kidneys the study of autophagy has previously been undertaken in lower species .
the study of autophagy in mammalian systems is advancing rapidly and has revealed that mammalian autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of various metabolic or age - related diseases [ 18 - 27 ] .
recently , nephrologists have also entered this exciting field of study .
in this section , we review recent studies on the pathophysiology of autophagy in the kidneys .
autophagy has been observed in various parts of the kidneys , including proximal tubules , and thick ascending limbs .
in particular , in podocytes , higher levels of constitutive autophagy have been observed using gfp - lc3 transgenic mice even under normal conditions [ 27 ] .
as for the role of autophagy in renal pathophysiology , several researchers have reported the significance of autophagy in experimental renal injury models .
in several experimental animal models of glomerulonephritis , including puromycin aminonucleoside and adriamycin - induced proteinuria , autophagy has been identified and shown to play renoprotective and antiproteinuric roles in podocytes through the use of podocyte - specific atg5 knockout mice [ 27 ] .
it has been recently reported that the normal aging process suppresses autophagy in podocytes , and that podocyte - specific deletion of atg5 leads to glomerulopathy in aging mice that is accompanied by accumulation of oxidized and ubiquitinated proteins , er stress , and proteinuria [ 27 ] .
in renal tubules as well as in podocytes , autophagy has been reported to play a renoprotective role under several pathological conditions .
in renal ischemia - reperfusion injury models , the upregulation of autophagy to protect the kidneys was observed using 3 - ma , chloroquine [ 28 ] , and proximal tubular epithelial cell - specific atg5 knockout mice [ 29 ] .
additionally , in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury models , the increase of autophagosomes was observed by em , lc3 - ii western blotting [ 30 ] , and gfp - lc3 transgenic mice [ 31 ] .
hypoxia is one of the causes of renal tubular damage in aged kidney [ 120 ] .
we have previously shown that hypoxia - induced autophagy activity declined with age , which led to accumulations of damaged mitochondria and mitochondrial ros in the kidney [ 26 ] .
interestingly , long - term calorie restriction ( cr ) restored autophagy activity even in aged kidney [ 26 ] .
as a mechanism , sirt1 - mediated autophagy was essential in cr - mediated renoprotection in aged kidney [ 26 ] .
bnip3 expression is essential to induce autophagy under hypoxic condition [ 121 ] and is positively regulated by a transcriptional factor foxo3a [ 122 ] .
this regulation was altered in aged kidney .
on the other hand , cr - mediated sirt1 activation deacetylated and activated foxo3a transcriptional activity and subsequent bnip3 - mediated autophagy even in aged kidney [ 26 ] .
furthermore , the kidney of heterozygous sirt1 - knockout mice showed lower autophagy activity along with the decrease in bnip3 expression , and thus they were resistant to cr - mediated antiaging effects [ 26 ] .
this finding suggests that sirt1 is essential for cr - mediated renoprotection .
thus , accumulative evidence has demonstrated the pathophysiological importance of autophagy in the kidneys ( table 1 ) .
however , the role and existence of autophagy in other types of renal cells besides podocytes and proximal tubular cells is not known .
8. perspective it is evident that the above - mentioned nutrient - sensing signals exist in the kidneys .
however , what are their physiological roles in this organ ?
the kidneys require sufficient amounts of atp for maintenance of their functions and avidly consume oxygen to drive mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation among major organs .
a small percentage of oxygen consumed by mitochondria is incompletely reduced to ros , and this unremitting generation of oxidants during mitochondrial respiration , albeit in small amounts , may cumulatively damage the kidneys , which are heavily dependent on mitochondrial metabolism .
regulating mitochondrial metabolism in response to nutrient conditions via regulation of autophagy that can remove damaged mitochondria and subsequent ros may be a physiological role of renal nutrient - sensing signals .
autophagy is regulated by nutrient conditions , and its alteration associates with various metabolic and age - associated diseases .
although studies on autophagy have methodological limitations , as outlined above , it is evident that autophagy deficiency is associated with podocyte and tubular cell injuries from the studies using atg5 - knockout mice [ 27 , 29 ] .
these findings lead us to hypothesize that autophagy is altered in diabetic kidneys , and autophagy deficiency should contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy .
altered nutrient - sensing signals in diabetic kidneys may contribute to accumulation of mitochondrial ros via suppression of autophagy , which may be associated with initiation of the early stages of diabetic nephropathy .
both hypoxia and proteinuria - induced er stress contribute to proximal tubular cell damage in the progressive and overt stages of diabetic nephropathy .
why do diabetic kidneys show a weakness against these stresses ?
how can we protect the kidneys from these stresses even under diabetic conditions ?
one answer may be derived from autophagy studies .
autophagy deficiency in diabetic kidneys may make tubular cells fragile under hypoxic and er stress and possibly lead to progression of diabetic nephropathy ( figure 4 ) .
activation of autophagy may be a therapeutic option for the advanced stages of diabetic nephropathy .
9. concluding comments in recent decades , numerous investigators have been making efforts to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy to develop new therapeutic strategies .
however , end - stage renal disease due to diabetic nephropathy continues to increase worldwide .
there is an urgent need to identify additional new therapeutic targets for prevention of diabetic nephropathy .
we have provided a perspective on whether autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and whether it is an acceptable new therapeutic target .
unfortunately , there have still not been many studies that have focused on autophagy in diabetic nephropathy .
in the next few years , studies using atg - gene knockout / knockdown mice combined with different methodologies will elucidate this possibility .
finally , these studies will ultimately give us a clearer perspective as to whether autophagy should be considered as a novel therapeutic target to halt the progression of diabetic nephropathy .

the number of autophagy - related papers in all fields has increased remarkably over recent decades .
corresponding with the increase of autophagy - related papers in all fields , publication of autophagy - related papers in nephrology fields , also gradually increased .
figure 2 scheme of autophagic pathways .
autophagic pathways consist of four steps : initiation , nucleation , elongation , and closure .
autophagy is initiated by the nucleation of an isolation membrane ( phagophore ) .
the phagophore elongates and closes on itself to form an autophagosome .
fusion of an autophagosome with a lysosome forms an autolysosome and , where the acid hydrolases in the lysosome , breaks down the inner membrane and cytoplasmic contents .
figure 3 schematic representation of nephron .
the basic unit of the kidney is the nephron , which consists of a glomerulus and a series of tubules lined by a continuous layer of epithelial cells .
the glomerulus consists of mesangial cells and a capillary wall with endothelial cells , glomerular basement membrane , and visceral epithelial cells ( podocytes ) .
fluid containing albumins and waste products is filtered through glomerulus , enters urinary space , and is reabsorbed by the proximal tubular cells .
figure 4 regulation of autophagy by nutrient and intracellular stresses and the relationship between autophagy and the progression of diabetic nephropathy .
under normal conditions , intracellular stresses such as hypoxia , mitochondrial ros , and er stress induce autophagy .
nutrient depletion enhances autophagy by inhibiting mtorc1 and by activating ampk and sirt1 .
this activation of autophagy helps to maintain intracellular homeostasis and may have renoprotective effects .
in contrast , under diabetic conditions , high glucose or ffa levels increase intracellular stresses , leading to the progression of diabetic nephropathy .
furthermore , nutrient excess and high glucose levels under diabetic conditions inhibit autophagy by inhibiting ampk and sirt1 , and by activating mtorc1 .
this inactivation of autophagy may reinforce the progression of diabetic nephropathy .

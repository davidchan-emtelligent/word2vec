hpv vaccine has been recently added to the iran drug list , so decision makers need information beyond that available from rcts to recommend funding for this vaccination .
modeling and economic studies have addressed some of those information needs .
we reviewed cost effectiveness studies to find a suitable model for iranian population to determine the potential cost effectiveness of hpv vaccine program based on domestic available epidemiologic data .
articles were obtained from an extensive literature search to determine the cost effectiveness of implementing an hpv vaccination program with routine cervical cancer screening .
a total of 64 studies were included in this review .
although the studies used different model structures , baseline parameters and assumptions ( either a markov , hybrid , or dynamic model ) .
most of the proposed cost effectiveness models need to model the probability of hpv acquisition , the possible progression from hpv infection to cin i , cin ii , cin iii and cervical cancer , the probability of hpv transmission which are not available in iranian epidemiologic data .
based on the available epidemiologic data in iran , the simplified and it requires substantially fewer assumptions than the other more complex markov and hybrid models , therefore we decided to use this model for the evaluation of cost effectiveness of hpv vaccine in iran .
key words cost effectiveness simple model hpv vaccine iran introduction the human papilloma virus ( hpv ) is among the most common sexually transmitted viruses .
chronic infection with certain subtypes of the hpv is the primary cause of cervical cancer and its precancerous lesions .
at least 50 % of the adult population is infected with this virus during their lifetime .
despite screening programs for cervical cancer , it remains the second most common cause of cancer - related death among women worldwide ( 1,2 ) .
gardasil is a quadrivalent vaccine of subtypes 6 , 11 , 16 and 18 of the hpv .
on the average , 70 % of cervical cancers are caused by infection with subtypes 16 and 18 , and 90 % of genital wards are caused by subtypes 6 and 11 of the hpv ( 3,4 ) .
vaccines are essential tools for preventing the diseases .
they will protect the vaccinated individual and help to protect the community by reducing the spread of infectious agents ( 5 ) .
there is no completely secure way for protecting sexually active adults against genital warts , and the current therapy modalities are often painful , time - consuming and with high risk of recurrence .
therefore , gardasil vaccine may be quite helpful with its protective properties .
gardasil is administered for women aged 9 - 26 years for preventing diseases caused by the hpv subtypes 6 , 11 , 16 and 18 , including cervical cancer , genital warts , and precancerous or dysplastic lesions ( 6 ) .
gardasil vaccine is part of the national immunization program in the united states , canada and australia , among others .
it is covered by insurance in canada and australia .
gardasil has been registered and is in use in 124 countries .
moreover , it is part of the national immunization program in 19 countries of the world which means it is administered to all girls aged 11 - 12 years ( 7 ) .
in june 2006 , the american food and drug administration ( fda ) approved gardasil vaccine ( produced by merck & co. ) for girls aged 9 - 26 years ( 8 ) .
the efficiency of gardasil is 100 % if administered prior to the first sexual contact ( 8 ) .
numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate its cost - effectiveness by calculating the cost necessary for one quality - adjusted life year .
none of them were cost saving for quadrivalent hpv vaccine ( 9 ) .
these include various models such as markov model , decision model , dynamic model , transmission or a combination ( 9 ) .
studies conducted so far have mostly addressed its impact on cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( cin ) ( 10 ) .
few studies have dealt with the cost - effectiveness of gardasil regarding other malignancies caused by the hpv ( 11 ) .
the national immunization program of girls prior to sexual activity has been shown to reduce hpv - related mortality and morbidity and to be cost - effective ( 12 - 16 ) .
since hpv infection is asymptomatic , it is growing silently ( 17 ) .
this vaccine is also recommended for 13 - 26 - year - old females even if the female is already sexually active and could have contracted hpv infection ( 8 ) .
vaccination can cause immunity both directly and indirectly through herd immunity ( 18 ) .
for the hpv vaccine , the exact total duration of protection is not known yet , because the current maximum length of clinical trials is around 6 years .
consequently , it could be argued that base - case analysis on the cost - effectiveness of the hpv vaccine should not use durations of protection beyond 6 years , let alone lifelong protection ( 19 ) in order to determine the long term benefit of this vaccine and impact of vaccine program on the future rate of cervical cancer , many pharmacoeconomists used mathematical model .
some models focused on cost effectiveness of different strategies ( 20 - 23 ) .
our objective is to review these cost effectiveness studies to find a suitable model for iranian population to determine the potential cost effectiveness of hpv vaccine ( gardasil ) program based on domestic available epidemiologic data .
experimental methods of literature review search strategy development in order to have a complete review of all cost - effectiveness models for hpv vaccine , we developed a search strategy .
in this step " the content - related keywords " were defined and combined it with " and " or " or " .
to assure the quality of the review and increasing the search sensitivity , we did n't use " and " frequently .
as many diseases are related to hpv , in our search query we mentioned the following keywords based on pico model : papillomavirus , hpv and human papilloma virus .
for searching the intervention part " vaccine " , " prevention " and " prophylactic " combined with " or " .
the c - cerg strategy was used to search the title , abstract and keyword fields within records of both cost - effectiveness studies and hta reports .
this method is the most documented search strategy in this field ( 24 ) .
search in electronic database for economic evidences the search query was " (" human papilloma virus " or papillomavirus or hpv or ( papilloma and viru *)) and ( vaccin * or preven *)" without any limitations .
nhseed , hta , dare , cea registry , pede , econlit and euronheed were our search databases .
inclusion criteria and quality assurance all published english - language studies were included in the review that assessed the icer of hpv vaccine compared with other alternative strategy like cervical cancer screening .
to find directly related studies , all obtained studies were categorized based on below criteria : directly relevant ( r1 ) : containing the full economic evaluation studies , considering the cost of quadrivalent hpv vaccine as a main intervention compared to other alternatives .
indirectly relevant ( r2 ) : quadrivalent hpv vaccine was not evaluated as main intervention , using different target group ( different age or gender ) , focused on diagnosis , treatment of cervical cancer or screening only , and other vaccines as a main alternative .
irrelevant ( r3 ) : focus on other viral infection .
results through literature review , 39 studies in nhseed database , 26 studies in hta , and 10 studies in dare were found .
these three databases are related to crd .
moreover , 46 studies in cea registry , 35 studies in pede , 2 studies in econlit , and 26 studies in euronheed were addressed during the review of the literature .
overall , a total number of 241 studies were found of which , only 148 remained in second step after omitting duplicate studies among databases .
for the next step and based on the inclusion criteria and relevancy criteria , 64 studies were categorized in r1 , 81 studies in r2 , and 3 studies in r3 .
after this step we had three expert panels to find the best and suitable model for iran .
in our study we defined an expert panel consists of 6 members ; two gynecologists , two onco - gynecologists , one expert of systematic review and one expert of pharmacoeconomy .
in the first expert panel and after reviewing 64 studies , 20 studies were defined as exactly related , which used defined models for their studies ( table 1 ) .
the result and summary of these studies categorized based on the used technologies , kind of economic study , effectiveness and cost data , kind of model , time horizon , and discount rate .
after summarizing 20 studies , the second expert panel discussed the methods and needed data of the selected studies .
based on the feedback of this panel , 6 studies were selected for modeling which is appraised and summarized in the discussion section .
finally , in third expert panel and based on the available epidemiologic data in iran and experts' opinion , we defined one of these models as a basic model for iranian cohort model .
discussion in this section , five major articles including elbasha et al. , 2007 , brisson et al. , 2007 , kulasingam et al. , 2007 , bergeron et al. , 2008 , kulasingam et al. , 2008 and chesson et al. , 2008 have been addressed in a thematic order as follows : choice of interventions or alternative interventions elbasha et al. , 2007 : the rationale for choosing alternatives is clear and precise in terms of addressing the current status of care ( no vaccination strategy ) alongside all possible vaccination options .
different conditions must be considered when applying the results .
brisson et al. , 2007 : this study compares vaccination of young girls with anti hpv 16 / 18 and anti hpv 6 / 11 / 16 / 18 versus no vaccination plan .
the latter represents the " do nothing " option , which is the current practice in the study site ( canada ) .
evidently , the status quo of service provision in the country must be assessed before trying to universalize the results .
kulasingam et al. , 2007 ( australia ) : the rationale for selecting alternative interventions is clear and appropriate .
the new approach to population - based immunization has been compared to the current standard practice in australia .
nevertheless , it must be noted that the base strategy of cervical cancer screening alone may not be a suitable representative of the routine care practice in countries , which have already begun hpv vaccination .
in sensitivity analysis , different vaccination programs ( in different populations ) have been considered , which may be logical and acceptable for other countries .
bergeron et al. , 2008 : both interventions are reported clearly and elaborately enough .
in addition , the choice of alternative strategy is very well justified .
this strategy consists of screening from 25 to 65 years of age every three years in france .
kulasingam et al. , 2008 ( uk ) : two options selected for prevention of cervical cancer are completely described .
the profile of the population study , vaccination program and screening tests are mentioned .
chesson et al. , 2008 : no vaccination scenario as the second strategy was appropriate .
validity of effectiveness and benefit index estimation elbasha et al. , 2007 : parameters of effectiveness have been adopted from published studies .
however , the authors do not mention their search strategy or inclusion criteria .
also , the reason for selecting these particular estimates is not mentioned .
the study mentions a review of literature but fails to indicate its strategies and methodology for review .
also , the information of the initial studies is not mentioned , making it impossible to assess validity of data from the initial studies .
qaly estimation uses a decision - making tree model .
the methods used for estimating desirability weights are not mentioned and are simply said to have been derived from published studies .
interest has been conducted appropriately .
qaly is a good choice since it considers the most important health aspects ( survival and quality of life ) and provides a basis for comparison with other healthcare interventions .
brisson et al. , 2007 : model parameters are derived from published studies .
however , the authors do not mention the search strategies or inclusion criteria for selecting the initial studies .
in addition , the study design is not specified .
in general , it is difficult to evaluate the quality of effectiveness data in these studies .
using qaly as an index of benefits makes it possible to compare the findings of this study with others addressing vaccination programs and other interventions .
the desirability coefficients for adjusted life expectancy based on quality of life are derived from published literature , but the study does not mention the method used for evaluating different health states .
the interest rate of health benefits in the future is appropriate .
kulasingam et al. , 2007 ( australia ) : clinical data , for the most part , adopted from published studies , which are not mentioned , except in the case of data derived from the national database .
therefore , it is impossible to evaluate the validity of these estimations objectively without information regarding the scope , sample size , and follow - up procedures of the original studies , which served as source .
however , extensive sensitivity analysis and choice of the most acceptable analysis value improve the power of clinical estimations .
using two benefit indices , with expected qaly values smaller than ly values , suggests the importance of evaluating quality of life in women with cancer .
bergeron et al. , 2008 : the authors do not mention using a systematic review of the literature for finding all relevant effectiveness and clinical data .
an explanation on the method of integrating and summarizing data obtained from studies has not been provided .
nevertheless , a summary about all parameters used in the model and their sources has been mentioned in the study .
in addition , sources of desirability estimations are clearly mentioned .
kulasingam et al. , 2008 ( uk ) : effectiveness data are obtained from a spectrum of published studies .
however , the selection strategy is not mentioned .
clinical outcomes used for evaluating the advantages of two preventive strategies were selected in favor of vaccination and screening strategy .
some health benefits were excluded from the study .
desirability coefficients were adopted from a published and an unpublished study under supervision of experts and authors , which may cause some degree of bias .
the reported data do not allow for evaluating methods of desirability assessment .
the model structure is not presented visually .
nevertheless , a comprehensive description of different health states and possible transmissions has been provided .
chesson et al. , 2008 : the databases were relevant and valid .
the treatment effects were based on trials , which characterized by high internal validity .
the clinical and the utility valuations derived from the literature .
the use of qalys was appropriate because they capture the impact of the disease on patients' health .
validity of cost estimation elbasha et al. , 2007 : it appears that cost analysis is performed from the payer 's point of view .
all cost groups have been included in the analysis .
different cost groups are reported , although details of costs are not mentioned .
the authors maintain that including indirect costs would reduce the desirability cost and thus improve the appeal of vaccination strategies .
no specific source has been provided for this information .
mentioning the reference year of reported costs makes it easy to convert the costs for different time periods .
costs have not been statistically analyzed , but the changes in estimation of major costs have been included in sensitivity analysis .
brisson et al. , 2007 : economical analysis is performed from the payer 's point of view , and all major cost items seem to have been included in the analysis .
uncertainty of cost data and consumed resources are addressed in sensitivity analysis .
future costs are interested appropriately .
these factors improve the applicability of the findings .
moreover , the reference year of cost estimations are mentioned clearly , which makes it easier for future calculations .
kulasingam et al. , 2007 ( australia ) : the cost groups considered in the study appear to be appropriate for the approach taken to analysis .
details of cost items are not given and some expenses are mentioned generally .
costs are obtained from national health care services , which reflect the local accounting systems .
consumed resources are obtained from published studies .
key assumptions of the study are addressed in sensitivity analysis .
bergeron et al. , 2008 : the economical viewpoints used are clearly expressed .
it seems that all cost items are considered based on their relation to the two viewpoints adopted .
sources of cost data ( mainly from official french sources or articles published in france ) are well presented .
in addition , the authors have appropriately reported the time period of the study , interest rate , reference year of prices and currencies .
kulasingam et al. , 2008 ( uk ) : the costs considered in the model are an appropriate reflection of the viewpoint adopted ( nhs ) .
methods of cost - assessment , modifications , sources of cost data and cost - service unit are presented appropriately and elaborately .
costs are modified for inflation rate .
nevertheless , the cost results of each strategy are not reported .
moreover , cost information is not mentioned for values consumed from each source .
chesson et al. , 2008 : the perspective was societal .
the analysis of costs followed a similar approach to the clinical analysis , in that macro - categories were presented without a detailed breakdown of items .
the cost estimates varied in the sensitivity analysis .
analysis and findings elbasha et al. , 2007 : the authors state that their findings generally agree with those of previous studies .
nevertheless , the study yields considerable discrepancies with findings of other economic evaluations , which the authors attempt to account for .
the study deals briefly with the issue of applicability of its findings in the section of sensitivity analysis .
alternative scenarios are considered in this section .
the authors have also highlighted some strengths of their analysis , including use of reliable data , clarity and flexibility .
also , certain limitations of the study have been mentioned , including the fact that the model deals mainly with hpv transmission from the opposite sex .
nevertheless , many assumptions of the study are biased towards different vaccination strategies .
brisson et al. , 2007 : the authors do not seem to be biased in presenting their findings .
furthermore , the conclusion is a good reflection of the scope of analysis .
the authors compare their findings with those from other countries and to some extent have managed to justify the discrepancies in desirability cost ratios .
kulasingam et al. , 2007 ( australia ) : cost and benefits are appropriately integrated .
however , the overall sum of costs and benefits are only presented graphically and only the cost - effectiveness ratios are mentioned .
sensitivity analysis has been conducted and reported appropriately .
a wide range of possible scenarios and alternative assumptions are addressed in sensitivity analysis , which indicates the power of the study .
bergeron et al. , 2008 : details of the markov model , which was used for modeling costs and outcomes of each intervention , are presented , but relevant diagrams are lacking in the text .
the model was previously designed for the united states and then modified for the european status .
although a series of univariate sensitivity analyses were included to measure uncertainty of model findings , using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis may have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the model 's overall uncertainty .
methods and results are sufficiently explained .
the limitations of the study are mentioned in the discussion section .
kulasingam et al. , 2008 ( uk ) : crude costs and health outcomes are integrated as cost - effectiveness ratios .
observational epidemiologic data in england confirm the validity of parameters related to cervical cancer risk .
univariate sensitivity analyses are comprehensive and address all key parameters in an acceptable spectrum .
while accepting the limitations of the study , the authors have attempted to justify them .
these include the lack of powerful data on desirability coefficients of the health states in questions , lack of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis , and possibility of underestimating health benefits .
the authors have compared their findings with those or other studies and discussed the possible applicability of their results .
in general , appropriate methods are used for the study .
however , the study has limitations in estimating desirability , cost reports and lack of probabilistic sensitivity analysis .
it appears that the authors have provided a correct discussion of their analysis .
chesson et al. , 2008 : the icers were presented in this study .
the method of this study was mentioned online .
the sensitivity analysis investigated the issue of uncertainty , using a deterministic approach , which was useful in terms of identifying the most influential model inputs .
based on the modeling of cost effectiveness , six studies have been selected and categorized as follows : brisson et al. , 2007 , kulasingam et al. , 2007 , bergeron et al. , 2008 , and kulasingam et al. , 2008 made use morkov models elbasha et al. , 2007 , and chesson et al. , 2008 made use of dynamic models a number of limitations are included in all discussed models .
the studies , which used markov models , did not take into account the herd immunity , which may result in underestimating the cost effectiveness of vaccination .
the studies that used dynamic transmission models did not consider the homosexual and bisexual effect of vaccination , which is not very important in iran .
among these six models and based on the available epidemiologic data in iran , chesson et al .
2008 , is simplified and it requires substantially fewer assumptions than the other more complex markov and hybrid models do. therefore , we decided to use this model for the evaluation of cost effectiveness of gardasil in iran .
on the other hand , this simplified model was compared to previous complicated markov , hybrid and dynamic models like the markov model of goldie et al ( 45 ) , the markov model of sanders and taira ( 46 ) , the hybrid model of taira et al .
( 47 ) , and the dynamic model of elbasha et al .
( 25 ) .
the findings were consistent with those from other published cost - effectiveness models ( 48 ) .
another advantage of this model is that there is no need to model the probability of hpv acquisition , the possible progression from hpv infection to cin i , cin ii , cin iii and cervical cancer , and the probability of hpv transmission , which are not available in iranian epidemiologic data .
age - specific incidence rates of cervical cancer ( asir cc ) is available in iran .
it is mentioned in 2008 population - based cancer registries in iran .
this model needs the following data which are available in iran : age - specific incidence rates of cervical cancer treatment cost of hpv adverse health outcomes costs averted by vaccination qalys saved by vaccination conclusion cervical cancer would be considered as a preventable cancer by vaccination .
generally hpv vaccine will have an influential impact on prevention of cervical cancer and finally on the epidemiology of hpv related cancers .
the most important note for using hpv vaccine is the age of individuals and their history of sexual activities .
most of the models compared the screening with vaccination and all included studies showed that adding this vaccine to the national vaccination program will be cost - effective based on the cost - effectiveness threshold of 50,000 usd per qaly .
as most of these studies were done in the united states , mentioned cost per qaly is suitable for usa .
for developing countries like iran , world health organization ( who ) has recommended a cost - effectiveness threshold indicating that a healthcare technology is cost effective if the icer is less than three times the gdp ( gross domestic production ) per capita who 's recommendation about threshold of developing countries considers icer less than triplet of gdp of iran for 2012 is 5,810 $ .
based on who recommendation , icer less than 17,430 usd per qalys could be considered cost - effective .
the chesson et al. , 2008 model is simple and could be applicable in different countries with limited data .
on the other hand , the results of this model were consistent with published studies based on the more complex models whereas key assumptions have been similar .
the authors stated and demonstrated that their findings were consistent with those from other published cost - effectiveness studies .
the main advantage of this model was its simplicity , which required fewer assumptions compared with more complex models .
the biggest drawback of their analysis , as the authors stated , was the limited understanding of the impact of changes in screening strategies on the cost - effectiveness of hpv vaccination .
acknowledgements no sources of funding were used to conduct this study or prepare this manuscript .
the authors have no conflicts of interest that are directly relevant to the content of this review .

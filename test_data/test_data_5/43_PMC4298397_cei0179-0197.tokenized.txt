programmed cell death - 1 ( pd - 1 ) plays an important role in peripheral t cell tolerance , but whether or not it affects the differentiation of helper t cell subsets remains elusive .
here we describe the importance of pd - 1 in the control of t helper type 1 ( th1 ) cell activation and development of forkhead box protein 3 ( foxp3 +) regulatory t cells ( tregs ) .
pd - 1 - deficient t cell - specific t - bet transgenic ( p / t ) mice showed growth retardation , and the majority died within 10 weeks .
p / t mice showed t - bet over - expression , increased interferon ( ifn ) - gamma production by cd4 + t cells and significantly low foxp3 + treg cell percentage .
p / t mice developed systemic inflammation , which was probably induced by augmented th1 response and low foxp3 + treg count .
the study identified a unique , previously undescribed role for pd - 1 in th1 and treg differentiation , with potential implication in the development of th1 cell - targeted therapy .
foxp3 + regulatory t cells helper t cell subsets programmed cell death - 1 t cell tolerance th1 cells introduction naive cd4 + t cells can differentiate into at least four subsets ; t helper type 1 ( th1 ) , th2 , th17 and regulatory t cells ( tregs ) 1 - 4 .
th1 cells predominantly produce proinflammatory cytokines [ interferon ( ifn ) - gamma and interleukin ( il ) - 2 ] and are necessary for the elimination and control of many intracellular pathogens 5 .
the transcription factor t - bet is thought to be both necessary and sufficient for th1 cell differentiation from naive t cells 6 - 8 , and directly controls ifn - gamma gene expression .
although th1 responses are essential for the control and prevention of diseases , activation of th1 cells in response to self - antigen or innocuous antigens ( derived from food , airborne particulate material or from gut commensals ) is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases , such as multiple sclerosis 9 , rheumatoid arthritis 10 , systemic lupus erythematosus 11 , intestinal inflammation 12 - 14 , type 1 diabetes 15 , contact dermatitis and contact hypersensitivity ( chs ) 16 - 18 .
therefore , the mechanism involved in the regulation of th1 cell activation is important for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases induced by the abnormal th1 immune response .
to examine the regulation of th1 cell activation , we focused upon programmed cell death - 1 ( pd - 1 ) , a type 1 transmembrane protein composed of immunoglobulin superfamily domain , a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain containing an immune - receptor tyrosine - based inhibitory motif ( itim ) and an immune - receptor tyrosine - based inhibitory switch motif ( itsm ) 19,20 .
although pd - 1 was identified initially as a gene that induced programmed cell death 21 , subsequent experiments indicated that pd - 1 expression is induced in activated t cells , b cells and monocytes , and it is now clear that the major function of pd - 1 is to attenuate the immune response 21 - 26 .
pd - 1 / pd - l1 interactions are considered to inhibit t cell receptor ( tcr ) signalling 27 , resulting in the suppression of immune response induced by interaction with dendritic cells ( dc ) 28 .
although recent studies showed that t - bet is directly bound to a t - bet regulatory region upstream of the pdcd1 gene and represses the expression of pd - 1 29,30 , it remains to be determined whether or not pd - 1 specifically affects the expression of t - bet and differentiation of th1 cells .
the present study was designed to further investigate the role of pd - 1 on the differentiation and function of th1 cells .
for this purpose , we crossed pd - 1 knock - out ( ko ) mice and t - bet transgenic ( t - bet tg ) mice under the control of the cd2 promoter .
surprisingly , pd - 1 ko x t - bet tg ( p / t ) mice showed growth retardation , and the majority of p / t mice died within 10 weeks .
mononuclear cell infiltration was observed in the liver , pancreas and intestine , and immunohistochemical analysis identified infiltrating cells in liver as cd3 + cd4 + t cells .
t - bet expression and ifn - gamma production were increased appreciably in splenic cd4 + t cells in p / t mice .
moreover , forkhead box protein 3 ( foxp ) 3 + cd4 + t cells were decreased significantly in the spleen and thymus in p / t mice compared with wild - type ( wt ) , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice .
in - vitro experiments showed no induction of foxp3 expression on cd4 + t cells from p / t mice under treg differentiation conditions with transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - beta .
recombination activating gene 2 ( rag - 2 ) ko mice transferred with splenocytes of p / t mice showed body weight loss , together with inflammatory cell infiltration in liver , pancreas , intestine and skin , similar to p / t mice .
co - transfer of cd4 + cd25 - t cells of p / t mice with cd4 + cd25 + cells isolated from wt mice attenuated infiltration of mononuclear cells in liver , pancreas , intestine and skin in rag - 2 ko mice .
the results indicated that pd - 1 deficiency in t - bet tg mice caused systemic inflammation , resulting in a short life span , which was due probably to an augmented th1 response and reduction of foxp3 + cd4 + regulatory t cells .
the findings suggested that the control of pd - 1 signal transduction could be a new therapeutic approach for inflammatory disorders induced by the th1 immune response .
materials and methods mice cd2 t - bet transgenic mice 31,32 were prepared by back - crossing mice on the c57bl / 6 background .

mice were observed every other day for clinical signs of autoimmune syndromes .
histological determination of autoimmune responses against various organs and tissues was conducted at 10 weeks after transfer .
measurement of serum autoantibodies of sera sera were obtained from mice at 6 - 10 weeks of age .
the levels of anti - nuclear antibody ( ana ) in serum were measured using the hepana test ( mbl ) and the indirect immunofluorescence assay to analyse the primary reaction ( reacting in the antigen fixation slide and sample ) and the second - order reaction [ reacting in the fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) - labelled antibody ] .
the levels of anti - double - stranded ( ds ) dna antibody in serum were measured by using the anti - dsdna mouse elisa kit ( shibayagi , japan ) ; elisa to analyse the primary reaction ( reacting in the antigen fixation well and diluted sample ) , the second - order reaction ( reacting in the peroxidase binding anti - mouse igg antibody ) and tertiary reaction ( reacting in the tmb ) .

p - values less than 0.05 were considered significant .
results over - expression of t - bet shortens the life span of pd - 1 ko mice to examine the effect of t - bet over - expression in pd - 1 ko mice , we generated t - bet over - expressing pd - 1 ko mice by crossing t - bet transgenic ( t - bet tg ) mice under the promoter of cd2 gene with pd - 1 ko mice ( pd - 1 ko x t - bet tg mice ; p / t mice ) .
surprisingly , the survival rate was significantly lower in p / t mice than littermate pd - 1 ko mice ( fig. 1a ) .
the majority of p / t mice , but not littermate pd - 1 ko mice , died within 10 weeks ( p < 0.0005 ) .
in the p / t mice the median survival time was approximately 9 weeks , and the mortality rate at 10 weeks was 58.8 % .
moreover , body weight was lower and the incidence rate of dermatitis was higher in p / t mice compared with wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice at 5 weeks of age ( fig. 1b,c ) .
these observations suggested systemic disorder ( s ) in p / t mice that negatively affected their life span .

pd - 1 deficiency in t - bet tg mice induces hepatitis , pancreatitis and enteritis to determine the cause of death in p / t mice , we examined various body organs macroscopically and histologically .
the organs examined were the kidney , heart , spleen , lung , liver , pancreas , salivary gland , lacrimal gland , intestine , mesenteric lymph node ( ln ) and ear ( table 1 ) .
in p / t mice the spleen was swollen , with weight significantly higher than wt mice , pd - 1 ko mice and t - bet tg mice ( fig. 2a,b ) .
histological evaluation showed infiltration of mononuclear cells in liver , pancreas , intestine and skin in p / t mice ( fig. 2c and supporting information,fig. s1 ) .
immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the infiltrated cells in liver were cd3 + cd4 + cells ( fig. 2d ) .
serological tests were conducted at 6 - 10 weeks of age to evaluate the severity of organ dysfunction .
serum levels of got and gpt were significantly higher in p / t mice than in pd - 1 ko mice ( fig. 2e ) .
however , serum amylase levels were similar in wt , pd - 1 ko , t - bet tg and p / t mice .
these findings suggest that pd - 1 deficiency in t - bet tg mice induced systemic inflammation and liver damage .

over - expression of t - bet and high ifn - gamma production by splenic cd4 + t cells of p / t mice the above results suggested that systemic inflammation was induced by t - bet over - expressing t cells in p / t mice .
in the next step , we examined lymphocyte proportions and t cell activation in peripheral blood .
although the splenic mononuclear cell count was higher in p / t mice than in wt mice , facs analysis of lymphocytes in the spleen showed similar cd3 + cd4 + cell counts in wt and pd - 1 ko mice ( fig. 3a,b ) .
we next analysed cytokine production and transcription factor expression on cd4 + t cells in spleen by facs .
intracellular cytokine staining of pma / ionomycin - stimulated splenocytes showed over - expression of t - bet and higher ifn - gamma production on cd4 + t cells in p / t mice ( 52.85 +/ - 8.57 %) compared to wt ( 1.89 +/ - 0.18 %) , pd - 1 ko ( 3.76 +/ - 1.00 %) and t - bet tg mice ( 25.13 +/ - 3.90 %) ( fig. 3c ) .
in the next set of experiments , cd4 + t cells isolated from the spleen were stimulated with anti - cd3 monoclonal antibody ( mab ) and anti - cd28 mab in vitro for 48 h , and cytokine levels in the culture supernatants were analysed using elisa .
ifn - gamma was significantly higher in p / t mice than wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice , while il - 17 was comparable in the four groups ( fig. 3d ) .
to identify the cause of systemic inflammation in p / t mice , we measured proinflammatory cytokine levels in sera by cba .
ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 12p70 , mcp - 1 and il - 6 were elevated significantly in p / t mice compared with wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice ( fig. 3e ) .
moreover , we measured serum autoantibodies , but ana and anti - dsdna antibodies were not detected in sera of p / t mice ( data not shown ) .
these results suggest that pd - 1 suppresses t - bet expression , ifn - gamma and the production of various inflammatory cytokines .

low percentage of foxp3 + regulatory t cells in p / t mice to examine the role of t - bet over - expression in the development of tregs in spleen and thymus , we analysed splenocytes and thymocytes from p / t mice .
facs analysis of the spleen showed that the percentage of foxp3 + cells among cd4 + t cells ( foxp3 + tregs ) was significantly lower in p / t mice than wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice , and that the number of foxp3 + tregs was lower in t - bet tg and p / t mice than in wt and pd - 1 ko mice ( fig. 4a ) .
in the thymus , the number of foxp3 + tregs was also lower in p / t mice than in wt and pd - 1 ko mice ( fig. 4b ) .
to confirm the ability of cd4 + t cells to differentiate into foxp3 + tregs , cd4 + t cells isolated from wt , pd - 1 ko , t - bet tg and p / t mice were cultured in the presence of tgf - beta and anti - ifn - gamma mab , and foxp3 and ifn - gamma expression was determined after 5 - day culture by flow cytometry .
tgf - beta induced foxp3 expression in cd4 + t cells of wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice , but not p / t mice ( fig. 4c ) .
foxp3 + treg function was analysed by the culture of cd4 + cd25 - effector cells with or without cd4 + cd25 + ( treg ) cells .
we confirmed that there was no significant difference in foxp3 expression in cd4 + cd25 + tregs isolated from wt , pd - 1 ko , t - bet tg and p / t mice ( supporting information,fig.s2 ) .
the suppression of effector t cell proliferation by p / t mice - derived tregs was comparable with wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice - derived tregs ( fig. 4d ) .
the p / t mice - derived tregs had a greater tendency to suppression of effector t cell proliferation than other mice - derived tregs , but showed no significant difference .
the above results suggested suppression of differentiation and / or maintenance of tregs in peripheral blood of p / t mice .

co - injection of wt tregs and p / t cells partially suppresses systemic inflammation in rag - 2 ko mice to confirm the pathogenic mechanisms in p / t mice , splenocytes of p / t mice were injected into rag - 2 ko mice .
although this transfer did not result in death of the recipient mice within the observation period , it resulted in a significant drop in body weight compared with mice that received splenocytes from wt , pd - 1 ko or t - bet tg mice ( fig. 5a ) .
because p / t mice showed a significant reduction of foxp3 + tregs , we performed facs analyses of splenocytes from recipient rag - 2 ko mice .
the percentage of foxp3 + cells in cd4 + cells was lower in recipient mice injected with splenocytes of p / t mice compared with wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice ( fig. 5b ) .
histological analysis at 10 weeks after the transfer of splenocytes showed infiltration of mononuclear cells in the liver , pancreas , intestine and skin of recipient rag - 2 ko mice , similar to p / t mice , but no such infiltration was noted in rag - 2 ko mice recipient of splenocytes from wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice ( table 2 and fig. 5c ) .
moreover , the dermatitis was developed only in recipient mice transfer with splenocytes from p / t mice ( fig. 5d ) .
next , we examined the effects of cd4 + t cells of p / t mice on the development of inflammatory symptoms in rag - 2 ko mice by injecting cd4 + cd25 - cells from p / t mice into rag - 2 ko mice .
histological analysis showed infiltration of mononuclear cells , similar to that seen following the injection of splenocytes from p / t mice into rag - 2 ko mice ( fig. 5e ) .
to determine whether the reduction of foxp3 + tregs was related to mononuclear cell infiltration in multiple organs in recipient mice transferred with cells of p / t mice , we injected cd4 + cd25 - cells from p / t mice into rag - 2 ko mice with or without cd4 + cd25 + cells isolated from wt mice .

discussion in the present study , we generated pd - 1 deficient t - bet tg ( p / t ) mice to examine the role of pd - 1 on the differentiation and function of th1 cells both in vivo and in vitro .
p / t mice showed growth retardation , and the majority died within 10 weeks .
they also showed severe splenomegaly and dermatitis and histological evidence of hepatitis , pancreatitis and colitis .
splenomegaly was reflected in the increase of splenic mononuclear cells in p / t mice .
moreover , facs analysis of splenocytes demonstrated the presence of large proportions of t - bet + ifn - gamma + th1 cells among cd4 + t cells and also a markedly low proportion of foxp3 + tregs in the spleen of p / t mice , and the various inflammatory cytokines by cba analysis were elevated significantly in sera .
based on the above finding , we propose that the abnormal balance between th1 cells and foxp3 + tregs played a major role in the induction of systemic inflammation in p / t mice .
ishizaki . 31 reported that t - bet tg mice developed dermatitis characterized by swollen , flaky and scaly skin in regions without body hair , which is pathologically similar to that seen in contact dermatitis , and that cd4 + t cells differentiated mainly into th1 cells .
moreover , spontaneous development of characteristic lupus - like mild proliferative glomerulonephritis with predominant igg3 deposition was reported in ageing c57bl / 6 pd - 1 ko mice , together with the appearance of arthritis characterized by increased lining layers of synovial tissues in foot joints 23 .
although we confirmed a slight but significant increase in th1 cells in t - bet tg mice , pathological assessment showed no evidence of infiltration of mononuclear cells in organs except in the ear skin in t - bet tg mice , and no death of either t - bet tg or pd - 1 ko mice was observed within the study observation period .
these findings indicate that systemic inflammation observed in p / t mice did not result solely from over - expression of t - bet or pd - 1 deficiency alone .
the percentage of foxp3 + tregs was clearly low in p / t mice .
foxp3 deficiency induces tissue inflammation and early death , as reported in scurfy mice , which lack cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs 33 - 35 .
scurfy mice are x - linked recessive mice mutants , and all hemizygous male mice with this abnormality die 3 - 5 weeks after birth .
they exhibit over - proliferation of cd4 + t lymphocytes , high serum levels of numerous cytokines and extensive infiltration of liver , pancreas and ear skin 35 - 37 , which is roughly similar to the findings in p / t mice .
therefore , we speculate that the short life span and systemic inflammation observed in p / t mice are due to the increase in th1 cells and reduction in foxp3 + tregs .
previous studies showed that adoptive cell transfer of lymph node cells isolated from scurfy mice into rag - 1 ko mice induced systemic inflammation resembling the phenotype of scurfy mice , that cell transfer of neonatal thymectomy ( ntx ) - pd - 1 ko mice into rag - 2 ko mice induced hepatitis and that adoptive cell transfer of th1 cells into rag - 2 ko mice induced colitis , and such inflammation was suppressed by co - transfer of foxp3 + tregs 37 - 42 .
we also used adoptive transfer of splenocytes from wt , pd - 1 ko mice , t - bet tg mice and p / t mice into rag - 2 ko mice to clarify whether the increase of th1 cells and the reduction of foxp3 + tregs is the cause of the shortened life span and systemic inflammation in p / t mice .
splenocytes of p / t mice induced body weight loss and mononuclear cell infiltration in liver , pancreas , colon and skin in recipient rag - 2 ko mice .
moreover , no fall in body weight was noted and histological findings were attenuated in rag - 2 ko mice when co - transferred with cd4 + cd25 - cells of p / t mice and cd4 + cd25 + tregs from wt mice .
these findings support the notion that a low foxp3 + treg percentage is a major factor in systemic inflammation in p / t mice .
why is the foxp3 + treg percentage low in p / t mice ?
our results of in - vitro induction of foxp3 + tregs demonstrated that foxp3 expression was not induced in cd4 + t cells in p / t mice , suggesting that peripheral cd4 + t cells did not differentiate into foxp3 + tregs in p / t mice .
although our results did not define the exact mechanism of the low foxp3 + treg percentage , we propose the following three possibilities .
first , pd - 1 deficiency might affect the development and maintenance of induced tregs ( itregs ) , because pd - 1 / pd - 1 ligand interaction plays a pivotal role in the development , maintenance and function of itregs 43 , and pd - l1 and pd - l2 double ko mice show significantly reduced conversion of itregs and rapidly develop fatal inflammation 44 .
secondly , abundant production of ifn - gamma might suppress the differentiation of foxp3 + tregs , as ifn - gamma is a negative regulator of the induction of foxp3 + tregs 45,46 .
the past study showed that ifn - gamma - producing th1 cells are resistant to the inhibition of de - differentiation into foxp3 + tregs by signal transducer and activator of transcription - 1 ( stat - 1 ) - phosphorylation through the activation of stat - 1 34 in vivo and in vitro 47 .
in fact , cd4 + t cells in p / t mice produced large amounts of ifn - gamma under conditions that favoured treg differentiation in vitro .
thirdly , over - expression of t - bet in cd4 + t cells could directly inhibit the expression of foxp3 , because th1 polarization is reported to underlie the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation 24 - 26 .
although the above scenarios should be investigated in more detail in the future , one of these factors alone does not seem sufficient to explain the low foxp3 + treg percentage in p / t mice , because no significant difference was observed in the percentage of foxp3 + tregs in splenic cd4 + t cells among wt , pd - 1 ko and t - bet tg mice .
moreover , pd - 1 deficiency in t - bet tg mice enhanced the expression of t - bet and production of ifn - gamma .
thus , we considered that pd - 1 deficiency , high production of ifn - gamma and t - bet over - expression together regulate the development and maintenance of foxp3 + tregs in p / t mice .
in conclusion , pd - 1 deficiency in t - bet tg mice caused systemic inflammation and early death , which was probably induced by the augmented th1 response and low foxp3 + cd4 + treg percentage .
therefore , we consider that the cause of death in p / t mice is multiple organ damage resulting from severe inflammation .
these findings could be helpful for understanding the molecular mechanism of th1 - mediated diseases and development of th1 cell targeting therapy .

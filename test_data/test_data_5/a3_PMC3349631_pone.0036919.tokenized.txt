purpose to test a field - based protocol using intermittent activities representative of children 's physical activity behaviours , to generate behaviourally valid , population - specific accelerometer cut - points for sedentary behaviour , moderate , and vigorous physical activity .
methods twenty - eight children ( 46 % boys ) aged 10 - 11 years wore a hip - mounted uniaxial gt1m actigraph and engaged in 6 activities representative of children 's play .
a validated direct observation protocol was used as the criterion measure of physical activity .
receiver operating characteristics ( roc ) curve analyses were conducted with four semi - structured activities to determine the accelerometer cut - points .
to examine classification differences , cut - points were cross - validated with free - play and dvd viewing activities .
results cut - points of <= 372 , > 2160 and > 4806 counts * min - 1 representing sedentary , moderate and vigorous intensity thresholds , respectively , provided the optimal balance between the related needs for sensitivity ( accurately detecting activity ) and specificity ( limiting misclassification of the activity ) .
cross - validation data demonstrated that these values yielded the best overall kappa scores ( 0.97 ; 0.71 ; 0.62 ) , and a high classification agreement ( 98.6 % ; 89.0 % ; 87.2 %) , respectively .
specificity values of 96 - 97 % showed that the developed cut - points accurately detected physical activity , and sensitivity values ( 89 - 99 %) indicated that minutes of activity were seldom incorrectly classified as inactivity .
conclusion the development of an inexpensive and replicable field - based protocol to generate behaviourally valid and population - specific accelerometer cut - points may improve the classification of physical activity levels in children , which could enhance subsequent intervention and observational studies .
introduction there is need to establish children 's physical activity levels for estimating prevalence , evaluating intervention effectiveness , and investigating relationships between physical activity and health [ 1 ] .
however , physical activity in free - living situations is difficult to measure with precision as it encompasses a broad spectrum of behaviours and associated types of movement [ 2 ] .
accelerometry can enable the quantification of time spent at different activity intensities [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] by applying pre - defined accelerometer count cut - points .
there is though , large variation in the cut - points used to define children 's moderate physical activity ( mpa ) , vigorous physical activity ( vpa ) and sedentary time , which impacts on accurate estimation of physical activity levels [ 3 ] .
to exemplify this , statistically significant differences in moderate - to - vigorous physical activity ( mvpa ) have been observed when mpa cut - points differ by as little as 90 counts * min - 1 [ 5 ] .
thus , there is on - going debate concerning how to translate and interpret arbitrary accelerometer counts into more meaningful and interpretable units [ 6 ] that can be applied to specific study populations .
rather than researchers relying on empirically derived accelerometer cut - points that may not be appropriate to a given study sample , there is a need for behaviourally valid protocols that enable researchers to generate and apply cut - points that are relevant to specific research populations .
though some field - based protocols have been used [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , existing accelerometer cut - points have typically been generated using laboratory - based protocols [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , allowing parallel measurement of energy expenditure ( ee ) by indirect calorimetry whilst controlling for physical activity intensity .
such methods however may hold limited ecological validity .
specifically , treadmill - based protocols have been used to obtain steady - state estimates of ee using a limited range of activities which do not capture intermittent lifestyle activities [ 11 ] .
the result is that periods of intermittent physical activity may be erroneously coded as inactivity [ 12 ] .
the unique nature of children 's physical activity [ 13 ] warrants the development of behaviourally valid , population - specific accelerometer cut - points [ 4 ] which are cross - validated and evaluated using activities that are representative of children 's free - living physical activity [ 4 ] .
while researchers have identified the need for the development of straightforward , cost - effective calibration protocols [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , the challenge remains to determine an appropriate sample of activities which represent the type and intensity of those performed by the target population [ 4 ] .
developing a field - based calibration technique that combines typical locomotor and free - play activities may replicate the diversity in children 's natural physical activity participation [ 14 ] and help develop optimal population - specific physical activity thresholds [ 10 ] .
the purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate a field - based calibration protocol to create behaviourally valid and child population - specific accelerometer cut - point thresholds .
thus , a by - product of testing this protocol was new accelerometer cut - points which would be specific to the population under investigation , who were the focus of a subsequent school - based intervention [ 15 ]. with this in mind we emphasise that the aim was not to further saturate the research literature with more cut - points .
methods ethics statement the study protocol was approved by liverpool john moores university ethics committee .
written assent from each subject and written informed signed consent from the primary caregiver were obtained .
participants were included in the study if they were without health problems which precluded their participation in usual daily physical activity .
participants twenty - eight children aged 10 - 11 years from one north - west england primary school participated in the study .
descriptive characteristics of the children are presented in table 1 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0036919.t001 table 1 participant characteristics / characteristic age ( years ) 11.4 +/ - 0.3 height ( m ) 1.45 +/ - 0.09 body mass ( kg ) 42.4 +/ - 9.9 bmi 20.0 +/ - 4.7 % male 46.0 % protocol children completed 6 different activities to allow for both calibration and cross - validation ( see table 2 for a brief description ) .
all activities were performed in a randomised order , and took place in the school playground or classroom as appropriate with 5 minutes seated rest between each activity .
to capture both the sporadic nature of children 's activity [ 13 ] and locomotor movements best suited to accelerometers [ 4 ] , the activities incorporated both intermittent and continuous ( i.e. , walking and jogging ) movements representative of culturally - relevant free - play situations .
sedentary activities were watching a dvd and drawing , which were consistent with those used previously [ 9 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0036919.t002 table 2 descriptions of the activities performed by the children .
activity location description drawing / coloring * indoors child sat at a classroom table and was provided colored pencils , pencils , sharpener and paper and was asked to draw for 10 minutes in silence .
dvd watching + indoors child sat at a classroom table and watched a dvd for 10 minutes in silence .
self - paced brisk walking * outdoors child walked at their own pace around a circular track for 5 minutes but was asked to walk briskly at a pace that could be sustained for the whole 5 minutes .
self - paced jogging * outdoors child jogged at their own pace around a circular track for 5 minutes at a pace that could be sustained for the whole 5 minutes .
playground games * outdoors for 10 minutes the child played 3 different playground games ( see below ) competitively with a member of the research team , with no breaks in - between each activity .
- hopscotch child played hopscotch with a large dice on a playground drawn hopscotch for 3.3 minutes .
turns to hopscotch were alternate between participant and researcher .
- frisbee child played frisbee at their own pace across the playground for 3.3 minutes with the researcher .
- reaction ball child played reaction ball across the playground for 3.3 minutes with the researcher .
the reaction ball is an oddly shaped ball that bounces in different directions when rolled .
therefore children had to react quickly to catch the ball .
free - choice games + outdoors child was provided with equipment ; frisbee , football , two tennis balls and rackets , two skipping ropes , two hula hoops , a reaction ball and a large dice , and were asked to play their choice of games , either on their own or with a member of the research team for 10 minutes .
participants were had to invite the researcher to play if they wanted and could freely change games throughout the 10 minutes .
* calibration activity .
+ cross - validation activity .
instrumentation accelerometry the actigraph gt1m ( actigraph , llc ; fort walton beach , fl ) measures and records movement counts which reflect volume and intensity of physical activity .
prior to each testing session actigraphs were initialized ( actilife 5.5.5 ; theactigraph.com , pensacola , fl ) according to manufacturer specifications using 5 - s epochs , to accurately capture the short duration , high frequency tempo of children 's physical activity [ 16 ] .
actigraphs were attached to an adjustable elastic belt that was fastened securely around the waist of the participant .
the actigraph was positioned on the right mid - axilla line at the level of the iliac crest .
direct observation direct observation ( do ) objectively captures the intermittent nature of children 's physical activity [ 11 ] and has high internal validity [ 17 ] .
the physical activity codes from the system for observing fitness instruction time ( sofit ) [ 18 ] were used to directly observe the children 's physical activity behaviours during the activities .
the physical activity coding element of sofit uses momentary time sampling to quantify health - related physical activity where codes 1 to 3 represented participants' body positions ( lying down , sitting , standing ) , code 4 was walking , and code 5 ( very active ) was used for more intense activity than walking [ 18 ] .
sofit was designed to assess physical activity during school physical education classes , but the same coding protocol has been used in other paediatric do instruments to assess youth physical activity in settings such as the home ( beaches ; [ 19 ]) , recreation centres , parks , and playgrounds ( soplay ; [ 20 ]) .
these do physical activity codes have been validated with heart rate monitoring [ 21 ] , oxygen consumption [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , and accelerometry [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] with preschool to 12th grade children , including those with developmental delays [ 17 ] .
as a result , do has been used as a criterion measure for validating other physical activity measures , and thus it is an appropriate method to underpin this calibration protocol which aims to objectively distinguish between different physical activity modes and intensities in children .
throughout the protocol each child 's activity was coded every 10 - s by a trained observer .
data management prior to observation of each child , actigraphs and a digital watch were synchronized to allow data alignment .
following download of the data from the actigraph , actilife 5.5.5 ( theactigraph.com , pensacola , fl ) software was used to merge 5 - s data to 10 - s data in order to align mean activity counts with do data .
for each 10 - s observation interval , do codes were matched with the corresponding 10 - s accelerometer counts .
do codes of 1 and 2 were categorized as sedentary time , code 3 as light intensity activity ( lpa ) , 4 as mpa , and 5 as vpa .
statistical analyses receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve analyses were conducted using medcalc 11.4.2.0 ( medcalc software , belgium ) to determine cut - points for sedentary time , mpa , and vpa .
roc analysis determines the accuracy of a test or , in this case , a cut - point by examining the potential of the method to discriminate whether using the cut - point provides an accurate assessment of the activity intensity [ 25 ] .
essentially , the challenge is to determine a threshold that accurately captures " physical activity " ( sensitivity ) without capturing " inactivity " ( specificity ) .
the area under the roc curve ( auc ) is considered equivalent to the probability that a randomly drawn individual from the sample not meeting the criteria ( e.g. , mpa ) has fewer accelerometer counts than those individuals who meet the cut - point criteria .
therefore the auc is a measure of the accuracy of the cut - point .
roc auc values of >= 0.90 are considered excellent , 0.80 - 0.89 good , 0.70 - 0.79 fair , and < 0.70 poor [ 26 ] .
roc curve analyses were used with combined drawing ( 10 min duration ) , playground games ( 10 min duration ) , self - paced walking ( 5 min duration ) and self - paced jogging activities ( 5 min duration ) .
mean accelerometer counts per 10 - s of each calibration activity from all the participants were modelled as the independent variable .
the dependent variable was calculated by creating a binary indicator variable based on do , for the calibration activities .
for mpa , do codes of 1 , 2 , and 3 formed a binary code of 0 , with codes 4 and 5 creating a binary code of 1 .
similarly , for vpa do codes of 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 formed a binary code of 0 , with code 5 creating a binary code of 1 .
finally , for sedentary behaviour do codes of 1 and 2 created a binary code of 1 , with do codes 3 , 4 and 5 being coded as 0 .
the sedentary and mpa cut - points provided the boundaries for the lpa classification .
the roc analyses identified the cut - points at which sensitivity and specificity were both maximized .
to examine classification differences and enable comparisons to previously published cut - points in this age - group , cut - points were cross - validated with the free - play and dvd viewing activities as recommended by welk [ 4 ] .
two - by - two ( 2x2 ) contingency tables were used to check classification agreement .
the observation and accelerometer data were first categorised into active and inactive binary codes .
computed sensitivity and specificity , cohen 's kappa coefficients [ 27 ] , and percentage agreement between classifications were assessed .
the determination of the optimal cut - point is a trade - off between sensitivity and specificity .
it is not possible to speculate on the optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity , and so it is recommended that researchers consider the implications of their decisions regarding the selection of cut - points , by taking into account the impact on the outcome variable [ 11 ] .
to highlight this contention , guinhouya et al .
[ 5 ] found statistically significant differences in the time spent in mvpa with roc - derived cut - point differences of 90 counts * min - 1 , but suggested that a discrepancy of 200 counts * min - 1 would be required for bio - behavioural relevance .
thus , we adjusted the calculated mpa threshold cut - point in our study by +/ - 90 , and +/ - 200 counts * min - 1 to evaluate the influence of such levels of variation on sensitivity , specificity , auc , and cross - validation agreement .
results the cut - points derived from the roc analysis are shown in table 3 .
plots of the roc curves are presented for sedentary , mpa and vpa ( figure 1 ) .
for all roc analyses , the auc was significantly better than chance with regards to global accuracy ( p <. 0001 ) and demonstrated excellent discriminatory power across activity intensities (. 976 - . 995 ) .
the high specificity ( 95.8 - 97.4 %) and sensitivity ( 88.7 - 99.2 %) values indicate that the cut - points were unlikely to misclassify inactivity as activity , and that the cut - points were accurate in classifying periods of activity , respectively .

sensitivity and specificity values varied between 93 - 96 % and 72 - 79 % respectively , which illustrated the minimal trade - off resulting from manually challenging statistically optimal cut - points .

roc curve analysis was used to identify criterion - referenced physical activity cut - points to apply to subsequent research which has sampled from the same population as this study .
as advocated by welk [ 4 ] , the intention of this study was not to further saturate the literature with more cut - points , but to describe an objective , inexpensive , field - based protocol for population - specific calibration which could improve the precision of accelerometer thresholds in populations of interest .
cut - points generated were <= 372 , > 2160 and > 4806 counts * min - 1 , for sedentary time , mpa and vpa , respectively , which exhibited excellent classification accuracy [ 26 ] .
in light of the growing body of evidence identifying sedentary time as an independent risk factor for a number of adverse health conditions [ 28 ] , and risk markers such as insulin resistance [ 29 ] , the generation of population - specific sedentary behaviour cut - points is essential .
the present cut - point of <= 372 counts * min - 1 for sedentary behaviour fell within the range of 100 - 799 counts * min - 1 reported previously [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
trost and colleagues [ 31 ] highlighted the tendency for waist - mounted accelerometers to misclassify static light - to - moderate intensity activities , ( e.g. , folding laundry and sweeping ) as sedentary time , and this remains a legitimate concern .
high sedentary cut - points may misclassify light intensity activity as sedentary and overestimate time spent in this behaviour ( a false positive rate ) .
arguably 372 counts * min - 1 is a relatively high sedentary cut - point and could therefore encompass lpa as well as sedentary time .
nonetheless , in accordance with a previous study [ 9 ] , our protocol used drawing / colouring and dvd viewing as typical free - living sedentary activities , where children were seated .
despite evenson and colleagues [ 9 ] reporting no significant differences in counts * min - 1 between sitting still , watching a dvd and colouring , other studies [ 7 ] , [ 30 ] found that incorporating activities whilst sitting was associated with markedly higher counts * min - 1 .
the current mpa cut - point of >= 2160 counts * min - 1 was substantially lower than those reported by treuth et al. , [ 14 ] mattocks et al. , [ 32 ] sirard et al .
[ 7 ] and puyau et al .
[ 30 ] ( range = 3000 - 3581 counts * min - 1 ) .
according to martinez - gomez et al .
[ 33 ] the use of different methodological protocols have consequently resulted in varying mvpa cut - points .
a recent study by trost et al .
[ 31 ] recommended that researchers should use evenson et al. ' s [ 9 ] mvpa cut - point (>= 2296 counts * min - 1 ) , which exhibited significantly better classification accuracy ( sensitivity = 77 % ; specificity = 81 % ; auc = 0.85 ) than other cut - points .
evenson et al .
[ 9 ] were the only other authors to employ roc analyses in a similar age group to that used in our study .
despite the similarity in derived mpa cut - points , evenson and colleagues [ 9 ] incorporated three structured activities ( stair climbing , brisk walking on a treadmill , dribbling a basketball ) .
the use of semi - structured playground activities in the current study provided opportunities for children to be as active , or inactive , as they wanted , thus providing a range of counts .
furthermore , the protocol supported the intermittent nature of children 's play incorporating a variety of activities .
the present study demonstrated higher sensitivity ( 96.9 %) , specificity ( 97.4 %) and auc ( 0.99 ) for mpa values than evenson et al .
[ 9 ] suggesting that the protocol could efficiently generate population - specific cut - points in children .
when applying evenson et al. ' s [ 9 ] mpa cut - points to our cross - validation data , there were little differences in the percentage agreement ( 88.2 % vs. 89.0 % , respectively ) suggesting that both cut - points are robust .
the vpa cut - point of 4806 counts * min - 1 was similar to those generated by treuth et al .
[ 14 ] and sirard et al. , [ 7 ] of 5200 and 5020 counts * min - 1 , respectively .
nonetheless , these cut - points are still higher than those reported in other work [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 34 ] , yet substantially lower than the values of 6130 and 8200 counts * min - 1 developed by mattocks et al .
[ 32 ] and puyau et al. , [ 30 ] respectively. with the exception of the sirard et al .
[ 7 ] cut - points having a higher sensitivity value ( 95.8 %) , the present study was associated with higher sensitivity ( 88.7 %) , specificity ( 95.8 %) , and auc ( 0.98 ) , in comparison to values of 68.0 - 87.5 % , 83.3 - 91.63 % , and 0.83 - 0.97 , respectively [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] .
specifically , when comparing the evenson et al .
[ 9 ] cut - points using our cross - validation data , the present study exhibited higher classification agreement ( 87.2 % vs. 83.1 ) , demonstrating favourable sensitivity ( 79 % vs. 61 %) , suggesting that a higher vpa cut - point may be more appropriate in this specific population .
notably , the vpa cut - point exhibited lower classification accuracy than sedentary and mpa cut - points .
as children 's physical activity becomes more vigorous a larger associated range of movements ( e.g. , running , skipping , jumping , dodging , etc. ) are performed and consequently there is more potential for variation within the counts .
additionally , the intermittent nature of children 's physical activity in conjunction with the 10 - s do measurement period may lead to some movements being misclassified .
despite the potential error surrounding the vpa cut - point the classification accuracy was still excellent .
furthermore , excellent classification accuracy exhibited by all three cut - points suggests that the activities used in the protocol and the do criterion measure were appropriate to effectively develop accurate population - specific cut - points for physical activity and sedentary behaviour .
the novel aspect of this study was the development of a pragmatic field - based protocol to develop population - specific cut - points , thus helping overcome issues surrounding cut - point selection .
do has frequently been cited as an appropriate criterion measure for evaluating children 's physical activity [ 35 ] .
the behaviour of the children was not controlled and incorporated free - choice activity .
therefore this field - based protocol holds strong ecological validity and may be more representative of children 's physical activity behaviour than previous lab - based studies [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
the children performed a broad range of structured and unstructured activities and auc (. 976 - . 995 ) were considered to be accurate based on roc criteria , indicating that the cut - points provided excellent discrimination across physical activity intensities [ 26 ] .
this is an encouraging result considering the sporadic and intermittent nature of children 's physical activity [ 13 ] .
moreover , the broad range of activities included in the protocol , combined with the excellent discrimination provides promise for minor modifications to the activities to accommodate cultural differences in children 's physical activity modes .
the use of roc analyses in the present study provided an objective balance between the needs for sensitivity and specificity , thus producing cut - points with maximal accuracy .
higher cut - point values tend to prioritise specificity over sensitivity , with the lower cut - points placing more emphasis on sensitivity .
without an empirical basis for the determination , it is difficult to select a trade - off between sensitivity and specificity .
the volume of cut - points presented in the literature could have partly arisen as a result of the differential weight placed on sensitivity and specificity [ 11 ] .
the roc approach avoids this issue by placing equal importance on specificity and sensitivity in classification of activity by seeking to maximize the auc .
this study had a number of strengths : ( i ) it used an ecologically sound , inexpensive field - based protocol to develop population - specific accelerometer cut - points representing sedentary behaviour , mpa , and vpa .
consistent with previous research [ 7 ] the activities included in the protocol resembled the usual free - living activities of children ( i.e. , watching a dvd , walking , and having free - choice of play ) ; ( ii ) the use of roc analysis facilitated comparisons of the relative sensitivity and specificity of the cut - points .
we challenged the optimised sensitivity and specificity values for mpa by calculating respective values for the generated cut - point of 2160 counts * min - 1 +/ - 90 and +/ - 200 counts * min - 1 [ 5 ] .
results indicated that these adjustments had little effect on respective sensitivity and specificity values , suggesting that a degree of error exists around the cut - points .
this may be due to each do code being associated with a range of activity counts , which may explain some of the variation seen in the literature to date ; ( iii ) data were interrogated through cross - validation of the roc - generated cut - points , which showed how gains in sensitivity are compensated by losses in specificity .
the decision regarding what type of cut - point to use may depend on determining the most acceptable type of error for a particular research application .
for example , intervention evaluations seeking to determine structured physical activity levels may need to emphasize specificity , thus indicating a reduced likelihood of classifying inactivity as activity ( i.e. , fewer false positives ) .
conversely , epidemiological studies on the health benefits of physical activity might be more effective with a cut - point that has higher sensitivity , preventing lower intensity activity from being missed ( i.e. , fewer false negatives ) .
study limitations were : ( i ) the protocol included upper - body movements , which are not detected by hip mounted accelerometers [ 36 ] .
however , as a relatively small proportion of movements are performed in this way compared to lower and whole body movements , the net effect is most likely small [ 37 ] ; ( ii ) anthropometrical and biomechanical factors such as stature , stride length , and body mass may have influenced accelerations detected by the accelerometer [ 7 ] during the protocol .
larger and more variable samples are needed to determine the effect of these factors on resultant cut - points ; ( iii ) though specific to this investigation the study sample size is small , however , the mpa and vpa intensity thresholds produced are similar to those detected through calibration research with larger samples [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] ; ( iv ) even though auc for the sedentary cut - point was high , the choice of sedentary activities may have incorporated some lpa , resulting in a relatively high cut - point .
however , the protocol led to mpa and vpa cut - points in line with previous studies ; ( v ) it is possible that gender differences in performance of some of the activities may have influenced accelerometer counts , though the sample size did not allow for gender - specific analyses .
preliminary inspection of the data however , indicated that gender differences were not evident , which concurs with previous research employing do as a criterion measure of physical activity in similarly aged youth [ 11 ] .
this novel study has demonstrated the potential utility of an ecologically sound , simple , inexpensive field - based protocol to derive optimal population - specific physical activity thresholds .
in comparison to other studies adopting the roc approach [ 7 ] - [ 10 ] the study demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity , and a high auc for all three cut - points .
the use of population - specific cut - points versus a single generic cut - point for children of varying age and demographics is a key methodological issue that has not been adequately addressed in the research literature .
collectively , our finding supports the application of a field - based calibration protocol to generate population - specific cut - points , though more work is required to generate a truly sedentary cut - point .
this approach can be repeated in other populations to determine optimal physical activity thresholds for research , surveillance and programme evaluations .
without further research it is not possible to speculate on the optimal balance between specificity and sensitivity , so researchers should consider the implications of their decisions regarding the selection of cut - points .
our field - based protocol may help standardize accelerometry calibration approaches , reduce confusion generated through the plethora of reported cut - points and competing devices , and accommodate population - specific findings .

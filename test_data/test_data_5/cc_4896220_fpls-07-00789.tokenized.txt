as a highly conserved protein , the translationally controlled tumor protein ( tctp ) carries out vital roles in various life processes .
in rubber tree , two tctp genes , hbtctp and hbtctp1 , were cloned , but only hbtctp1 was studied in details .
in this study , cis - acting regulatory elements , expression patterns , subcellular localization , interacting proteins , and antioxidant activity of hbtctp were systematically analyzed .
besides the common cis - acting regulatory elements , hbtctp promoter also harbored various known cis - elements that respond to hormone / stresses .
being consistent with the aforementioned results , hbtctp was regulated by drought , low temperature , high salt , ethylene ( et ) , wounding , h2o2 , and methyl jasmonate ( meja ) treatments .
hbtctp was expressed throughout different tissues and developmental stages of leaves .
in addition , hbtctp was associated with tapping panel dryness ( tpd ) .
hbtctp was localized in the membrane , cytoplasm and the nucleus , and interacted with four proteins rubber elongation factor ( ref ) , 17.5 kda heat shock family protein , annexin , and ref - like stress related protein 1 .
being similar to hbtctp1 , hbtctp also indicated antioxidant activity in metal - catalyzed oxidation ( mco ) system .
our results are useful for further understanding the molecular characterization and expression profiles of hbtctp , but also lay a solid foundation for elucidating the function of hbtctp in rubber tree .

since yenofsky et al .
( 1983 ) reported the first tctp in mouse , the tctps have been cloned and characterized in different organisms .
in animals , the tctps were reported to be associated with several biological processes such as cell growth , cell cycle progression , differentiation , malignant transformation , protection against various stress conditions and apoptosis ( amson et al. , 2013 ) .
in contrast to animals , the studies on plant tctps are very limited .
the first plant tctp gene was cloned in medicago sativa ( pay et al. , 1992 ) .
currently , tctp genes have been isolated from different plants species .
besides being related to plant growth and development ( lu et al. , 2007 ; brioudes et al. , 2010 ; nakkaew et al. , 2010 ; qin et al. , 2011 ) , tctps were also involved in a wide range of stimulus response , such as darkness ( sage - ono et al. , 1998 ) , aluminum ( ermolayev et al. , 2003 ) , pathogens ( jones et al. , 2006 ; li et al. , 2010b ) , nacl ( vincent et al. , 2007 ; cao et al. , 2010 ) , mercury ( wang et al. , 2012 ) , heat , cold , and drought ( kim et al. , 2012 ; li et al. , 2013 ) , as well as growth regulators such as auxins , aba ( berkowitz et al. , 2008 ; cao et al. , 2010 ; kim et al. , 2012 ) , and methyl jasmonate ( meja ) ( li et al. , 2013 ) .
interestingly , the tctps have been detected in castor and winter squash phloem saps , suggesting that the tctps might be involved in regulating the destination - selective long - distance movement of phloem proteins by interacting with phloem proteins ( barnes et al. , 2004 ; aoki et al. , 2005 ; hinojosa - moya et al. , 2006 ) .
recently , lupin and pumpkin tctp mrna have also been found in the phloem sap transcriptome and phloem sap exudates , respectively ( rodriguez - medina et al. , 2011 ; hinojosa - moya et al. , 2013 ) .
tctp varies in its gene number among different organisms .
mammals have more than two tctp - like sequences , while plants and fungi usually contain one or two tctp genes ( hinojosa - moya et al. , 2008 ) .
based on this wide range of functions and the different tctp versions , gutierrez - galeano et al .
( 2014 ) suggested that tctps might take place function specialization in plants with two members .
they further proposed that there were two groups of tctp genes , attctp1 - like and cmtctp - like clades , and their respective functions might be inferred from their corresponding groups .
there are two tctp genes identified in rubber tree ( li et al. , 2013 ) .
liang et al .
( 2009 ) firstly reported that hbtctp ( genbank accession : fj156098 ) was constitutively expressed in latex , leaves and barks and induced by ethylene ( et ) treatment .
deng et al .
( 2012 ) further analyzed the gene structure and developed molecular markers of hbtctp .
li et al .
( 2013 ) cloned another tctp gene ( hbtctp1 ) in rubber tree .
hbtctp1 was expressed throughout different tissues and developmental stages of leaves .
besides being related to tapping panel dryness ( tpd ) , hbtctp1 was regulated by drought , low temperature , high salt , et , wounding , h2o2 , and meja .
hbtctp1 possessed supercoiled dna protection activity in metal - catalyzed oxidation ( mco ) system .
the aforementioned results suggested that hbtctp1 was a multifunctional gene and associated with hormone / stress response and tpd .
however , the other tctp gene , hbtctp , was not studied and reported in details until now .
here , we further analyzed expression patterns , cis - regulatory elements of hbtctp , as well as interacting proteins , subcellular location , and antioxidant activity of hbtctp protein .
our results not only are useful for further understanding the molecular characterization and expression profiles of hbtctp , but also lay a solid foundation for elucidating hbtctp function in rubber tree .
materials and methods plant materials reyan 8 - 79 , a high - yielding rubber tree clone , was planted at the experimental farm of chinese academy of tropical agricultural sciences .
the plant tissues , latex , male and female flowers , anthers , leaves and barks were separately collected from three 17 - year - old rubber trees regularly tapped on the s / 2 d / 3 system with 1 % et stimulation for the past 11 years , and each rubber tree was referred as one biological replicate .
according to hao and wu ( 2000 ) , 6 - year - old virgin trees were applied with et , h2o2 and meja treatments prior to the first tapping .
the wounding treatment was performed according to the method provide by tang et al .
( 2010 ) .
one - year old seedlings of reyan 7 - 33 - 97 were separately treated with drought ( 16 % peg ) , low temperature 8 ( 8degreesc ) , and high salt ( 1m nacl ) , and the leaves from five treated and five control ( 1 - year old seedlings of reyan 7 - 33 - 97 were grown at normal condition without any treatments including drought , low temperature , or high salt ) materials were separately collected and equivalently pooled at different times for total rna extraction .
the leaves from each five seedlings were referred as one biological replicate .
the leaves of different developmental stages were separately harvested from three 6 - year - old reyan 8 - 79 , and each rubber tree was referred as one biological replicate .
the trees with a partial or complete stoppage of latex flow are defined as the initial and advanced stages of tpd trees , respectively .
in this study , the latex and barks were collected from the tpd trees at initial stage .
the latex and barks from five healthy and five tpd rubber trees were separately collected and equivalently pooled for total rna exaction , and the samples from each five trees were referred as one biological replicate .
all samples for real - time rt - pcr experiments were harvested with three biological replicates .
rna and dna extraction total rnas from different tissues were prepared according to xu 's method ( xu et al. , 2010 ) , and then treated with rnase - free rq1 dnase ( promega , usa ) .
the genomic dna was isolated from the young leaves with the ctab method ( porebski et al. , 1997 ) .
the quantity and quality of rna and dna were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and the spectrophotometer .
cloning and analyses of hbtctp promoter to obtain the promoter sequence of hbtctp , the pcr primers were designed according to the sequences of contig338249 ( genbank accession : ajjz010271614.1 ) ( rahman et al. , 2013 ) .
the promoter sequence of hbtctp was isolated by pcr amplification using genomewalker universal kit ( clontech , usa ) .
the primary pcr was performed with the outer adaptor primer ( ap1 ) and the outer gene - specific primer 5 ' - cagaatcactcacccaaacg - 3 ' using advantage2 polymerase mix ( clontech , usa ) .
the secondary pcr was performed with the nested adaptor primer ( ap2 ) and the nested gene - specific primer 5 ' - cagatccccatgtacacaac - 3 ' .
the pcr product was cloned into the pmd18 - t vector and sequenced .
the cis - acting regulatory elements within the promoter of hbtctp were predicted using place ( https :// sogo.dna.affrc.go.jp / cgi - bin / sogo.cgi ? lang = en & pj = 640 & action = page & page = newplace ) .
real - time rt - pcr first - strand cdna was obtained using reveraid ( tm ) first strand cdna synthesis kit ( thermo scientific , usa ) .
in each real - time rt - pcr reaction , the gene - specific primers were used , and 18s rrna gene ( genbank accession : ab268099 ) was used as the internal reference according to tang et al .
( 2010 ) .
the forward ( f ) and reverse ( r ) primers are the following : for 18s rrna ( f 5 ' - gctcgaagacgatcagatacc - 3 ' and r 5 ' - ttcagccttgcgaccatac - 3 ') ; for hbtctp ( f 5 ' - ttgtggatcgatccgagaga - 3 ' and r 5 ' - caaccc acttcccctcaact - 3 ') .
real - time rt - pcr was performed with the lightcycler 2.0 system ( roche diagnostics , germany ) and sybr premix ex taq ( tm ) ii ( takara , japan ) .
the reactions were carried out as follows : 30 s at 94degreesc for denaturation , followed by 45 cycles of 94degreesc for 5 s , 60degreesc for 20 s , and 72degreesc for 20 s. the relative abundance was calculated by the lightcycler relative quantification software 4.05 .
the specificity of each primer pairs was verified by the melting curves and sequencing the pcr products .
all real - time rt - pcr experiments described here were reproduced with three biological replicates , and the values were presented as mean +/ - s.d. the statistical analysis was performed using spss software version 19.0 ( ibm , armonk , new york ) and one - way anova with the student - newman - keuls test was used for comparison of hbtctp expressions across different tissues and development stage .
the t - test was performed for comparison of hbtctp expressions under the treatments of stresses and hormones , or healthy and tpd rubber trees .
subcellular localization of hbtctp to determine its subcellular localization , the orf of hbtctp was cloned into the vector cd3 - 1103 ( tair accession : 5016231514 ) .
in this construct , the gene was in - frame fused at its 5 ' end to an enhanced yellow fluorescent protien ( eyfp ) gene .
the forward and reverse primers were 5 ' - ctcaagcttcgaattctatgttggtctatcaggatttgct - 3 ' and 5 ' - ctagatcaggtggatccgcatttgacctcct tcaaagca - 3 ' , respectively .
the pcr - amplified fragment was ligated into the vector basing on the method of homologous recombination .
the resultant construct was transformed into rice protoplasts for transient expression , following the methods described by bart et al .
( 2006 ) .
the fluorescent signals were examined with a laser confocal microscope ( leica tcs sp5 ) , stimulated by light of 512 nm wavelength [ to indicate cell nucleus , the nuclear mcherry expression vector cd3 - 1106 ( tair accession : 5016231517 ) was optionally cotransformed into rice protoplasts together with the construct .
mcherry fluorescence was stimulated by light of 585 nm wavelength ] .
yeast two - hybrid screen and assays hybrizap ( r ) - 2.1 two - hybrid predigested vector / gigapack ( r ) cloning kit ( stratagene , ca ) was used to screen the proteins interacting with hbtctp in the study .
the coding sequence of hbtctp was cloned into the bait vector pbd - gal4 cam .
saccharomyces cerevisiae strain yrg - 2 were first transformed with the bait pbd - hbtctp and subsequently transformed with latex cdna library plasmid dna by the lithium acetate method .
the transformants were plated onto sd medium lacking leucine , tryptophan and histidine ( sd / - leu / - trp / - his ) .
the colonies growing on selection media were restreaked onto sd / - leu / - trp / - his , transferred to the filter paper , and assayed for beta - galactosidase ( lacz ) activity by the filter lift assay .
the lacz - positive colonies growing on sd / - leu / - trp / - his medium were considered putative positive clones .
the plasmids were isolated from these yeast colonies , transformed , and amplified in the e. coli xl1 - blue strain .
the isolated plasmids were then transformed back into yrg - 2 cells either alone or in combination with control plasmids .
the retransformation assays were able to elicit expression of the two reporter genes only in the presence of pbd - hbtctp bait , but not alone or in combination with control plasmids , were considered true positives .
the validated positive clones were selected to be sequenced .
purification and mco assay of hbtctp fusion protein the coding sequences of hbtctp with the introduced ecor i and bamh i sites were ligated into pet28a plasmid .
the correct pet28a - hbtctp was confirmed by sequencing and transferred into e. coli strain bl21 ( de3 ) .
in lb medium with 100 mg / l kanamycin , the e. coli bl21 cells containing pet28a - hbtctp or pet28a plasmids were separately grown at 37degreesc overnight .
one ml transformants cultured overnight were inoculated into 200 ml fresh lb medium with 100 mg / l kanamycin .
after the od600 value of the transformants reached 0.4 , the transformants were further incubated at 37degreesc for ~ 3 h with 1 mm isopropyl - beta - d - thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg ) induction .
to obtain hbtctp protein , the pet28a - hbtctp was purified and substituted by zeba ( tm ) desalt spin columns ( thermo scientific pierce , usa ) .
the mco assay was employed to determine whether hbtctp could protect supercoiled dna according to the method described by li et al .
( 2004 ) .
fifty microliters reaction mixtures contain 33 mum fecl3 , 3.3 mm dtt and 200 mug / ml purified hbtctp or hbtctp1 proteins .
the puc19 supercoiled dna ( 300 ng ) were added to each reaction and incubated further at 37degreesc for 2 h. the dna protection was evaluated with 10 mul reaction samples by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis .
in addition , bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) was also assayed in similar conditions as controls .
degradome data according to german et al .
( 2009 ) , a library with all degraded mrna was constructed in rubber tree .
after sequencing , analysis with the cleaveland pipeline , slicing sites of mrna by small rna are detected .
degradome data were provided by the deba hevea project funded by institut francais du caoutchouc .
degradome data were obtained according to an adapted protocol from german et al .
( 2009 ) and analyzed by the cleaveland pipeline developed by addo - quaye et al .
( 2009 ) .
results hormone / stresses respond - related cis - elements identified in hbtctp promoter using the pcr - based genome walking method , we obtained a 1201 - bp promoter sequence of hbtctp ( genbank accession : kx179468 ) .
the cis - acting regulatory elements within hbtctp promoter were predicted by place software .
besides the common cis - acting regulatory elements including tata boxes and caat boxes , the hbtctp promoter also harbored various known cis - elements associated with hormone response [ ethylene , abscisic acid ( aba ) , gibberellin ( ga ) , salicylic acid ( sa ) , and auxin responses ] , stress response ( anaerobically induced , disease resistance , copper , co2 , pathogenesis and salt - induced , light , wounding , uv - b irradiation , heat shock , water , and pro - or hypo - osmolarity responses ) , as well as stress and hormone responses ( drought and aba , dehydration , aba and cold , ga and sugar ) .
in addition , some special cis - acting regulatory elements were also found in hbtctp promoter , such as phytochrome regulated element , and sugar response element , etc ...( supplementary table s1 ) .
the results indicated that hbtctp expression might be involved in stress / hormone response .
expression analysis of hbtctp we systematically analyzed hbtctp expression by real time rt - pcr .
as shown in figure 1a , hbtctp was highly expressed in latex , followed by barks , female flowers , leaves , anthers and male flowers .
gebelin et al .
( 2012 ) predicted that eleven contigs encoding rubber tree tctp genes could be targeted by mirna .
therefore , we set out to detect whether this occurs to hbtctp .
as shown in table 1 , three contigs ( cl1994contig3 , cl18contig4 , and cl18contig13 ) being identified to hbtctp are experimentally validated by degradome analysis in at least two tissues .
in addition , hbtctp expression indicated a significant change in different leaf development stages , with the highest level in light young leaves , the lowest in red leaves ( figure 1b ) .

hbtctp expression was also analyzed under several treatments including drought , low temperature , high salt , et , wounding , h2o2 and meja .
as shown in figure 2 , hbtctp was regulated by all the treatments , but its expression profiles widely varied depending on the different treatments .
the statistical analyses showed that the changes of hbtctp expression indicated significant differences under all treatments .
under drought , low temperature , high salt , and h2o2 treatments , hbtctp transcripts steadily decreased ( figures 2a,b ) .
under et and meja treatment , the hbtctp was totally downregulated , but indicated slight oscillations in different times ( figure 2c ) .
under wounding treatment , hbtctp transcripts were decreased at 6 h after treatment , and then upregulated at 48 h ( figure 2a ) .
in contrast , hbtctp did not significantly change in their corresponding controls ( figure 2 ) .
these results suggested that hbtctp might be associated with et , meja and stress responses in rubber tree .

li et al .
( 2013 ) reported that hbtctp1 transcripts were upregulated in healthy rubber tree , suggesting that hbtctp1 was associated with tpd ; therefore , hbtctp expression was also investigated in healthy and tpd trees .
as shown in figure 3 , the hbtctp transcripts were higher in tpd rubber tree than healthy one .
the statistical analyses indicated that the changes of hbtctp expression had significant differences between healthy and tpd rubber trees .
the results suggested that hbtctp might be associated with tpd processes in rubber tree .

hbtctp located in whole cell to investigate the subcellular localization of hbtctp protein , we transiently expressed hbtctp : eyfp fusion protein in rice protoplasts and examined with a laser confocal microscope .
as shown in figure 4 , the fluorescent signals of the fusion protein were visualized in the membrane , the cytosol and the nucleus , as similar as those of eyfp alone .
the results suggested that hbtctp has no preference in subcellular localization .
figure 4 subcellular localization of hbtctp - yfp fusion protein in rice protoplasts .
identification of hbtctp - interacting proteins next , we screened and identified the hbtctp - interacting proteins by yeast two - hybrid ( y2h ) assay .
the initial screening identified five colonies , which were subsequently validated for activating the lacz gene .
as shown in figure 5 , only four colonies can activate lacz gene .
the plasmid dnas were isolated from the four colonies and retransformed into the yrg - 2 strain to confirm whether the activation is indeed due to the presence of the fusion protein .
we observed that all the four plasmids were able to activate the lacz gene only in the presence of pbd - hbtctp .
all the four sequences contained complete open reading frames , and the blastx results indicated that the four sequences ( genbank accession : kx179469 - kx179472 ) encoded different proteins including rubber elongation factor protein , 17.5 kda heat shock family protein , annexin , and ref - like stress related protein 1 .

hbtctp indicating in vitro supercoiled dna protection activity to analyze in vitro supercoiled dna protection activities , hbtctp was expressed in e. coli bl21 cells and purified .
the obtained fusion protein showed an approximately 25.0 - kda band on sds - page , in agreement with the predicted molecular mass ( 19.1 kda for hbtctp and 6.2 kda for the his and t7 tags ) , and was therefore used for dna protection activity assay .
as shown in figure 6 , the mco components without incubation or separately incubated mco components did not bring about any damage to supercoiled dna , whereas the complete nicking of supercoiled dna occurred in mco system without hbtctp protein and with bsa ( a negative control ) .
being consistent with hbtctp1 identified with supercoiled dna protection activity ( li et al. , 2013 ) , the hbtctp proteins indicated the protection of supercoiled dna , suggesting that hbtctp protein possessed supercoiled dna protection activity against mco .

discussion tctp is a highly conserved protein throughout all the eukaryotes , and it is associated with a wide range of cellular functions including cell growth , cell cycle progression , and protection against various stresses , etc .
it is reported that there are variable numbers of tctp genes in different organisms , and plants in general contain one or two tctp genes ( hinojosa - moya et al. , 2008 ) .
rubber tree contains two tctp genes , hbtctp and hbtctp1 , but only hbtctp1 was analyzed and reported in detail .
in this study , hbtctp was systematically studied .
being different from hbtctp1 , hbtctp was highly expressed in latex , which differ from the previous results that there was no difference in the expression of hbtctp among barks , leaves and latex ( liang et al. , 2009 ). with leaf growth and development , hbtctp expression was initially increased , and then decreased .
the highest and lowest expression of hbtctp was separately in light young and red leaves , whereas the correspondent in mature and light young leaves as far as hbtctp1 is concerned .
besides its expression widely varied on different tissues and developmental stage , tctp was reported to be regulated in various stresses ( ermolayev et al. , 2003 ; jones et al. , 2006 ; vincent et al. , 2007 ; cao et al. , 2010 ; li et al. , 2010b , 2013 ; kim et al. , 2012 ; wang et al. , 2012 ) and growth regulators ( berkowitz et al. , 2008 ; liang et al. , 2009 ; cao et al. , 2010 ; kim et al. , 2012 ; li et al. , 2013 ) .
in accordance with the aforementioned results , hbtctp was regulated by et , wounding , meja , low temperature , high salt , h2o2 and drought treatments .
the cis - acting regulatory elements that respond to hormones and stresses were identified in hbtctp promoter , which might explain its expression profiles under hormone and stresses treatments .
although hbtctp1 was also regulated by all the aforementioned treatments , the expression patterns of hbtctp evidently differ from that of hbtctp1 .
moreover , the hbtctp1 transcripts were obviously higher in healthy rubber tree than tpd tree ( li et al. , 2013 ) .
on the contrary , hbtctp was significantly downregulated in healthy rubber tree .
according to the expression patterns of two tctp genes , it is reasonable that there is a functional specialization between hbtctp and hbtctp1 .
hoepflinger et al .
( 2013 ) reported that attctp - gfp indicated cytosolic distribution .
mammalian tctp was predominantly found in cytosol and nucleus in vivo , although it was described as a protein functioning in mitochondria ( zhang et al. , 2002 ) .
in our study , hbtctp was found to be localized in membrane , cytosol , and nucleus in rice protoplasts , which is consistent with the result that no signal peptide was predicted within hbtctp protein by using signalp 4.0 ( http :// www.cbs.dtu.dk / services / signalp /). of course , the subcellular location of hbtctp need be further validated in rubber tree .
tctp is a multifunctional protein , which is inferred from the fact that it is capable of interacting with diverse targets , including cytoskeletal components , factors involved in cell repair , apoptosis ( pro - and antiapoptotic ) , protein synthesis , and even general metabolism ( amson et al. , 2013 ) .
in this study , we identified that hbtctp interacted with hbref , 17.5 kda heat shock protein , annexin , and stress - related protein - like .
consisting with our result , zeng et al .
( 2011 ) also reported that hbref interacted with hbtctp .
ref is necessary for prenyltransferases from a number of sources to add multiple cis - isoprene units to rubber molecules ( dennis and light , 1989 ) .
in addition , hbtctp was preferential expression in latex .
therefore , hbtctp might be involved in rubber biosynthesis ( rb ) by interacting with hbref .
an uncompensated oxidative stress occurred on the onset of tpd ( yusof et al. , 1995 ) .
in tpd tree , the nad ( p ) h oxidase activities increased , whereas variable peroxidase and sod levels decreased ( xu and xiao , 1988 ) .
in addition , peng et al .
( 2011 ) reported that tpd rubber tree indicated typical characteristics of programmed cell death ( pcd ) .
li et al .
( 2010a ) proposed that reactive oxygen species ( ros ) metabolism , ubiquitin proteasome pathway ( upp ) , pcd , and rb pathways might play important roles in tpd .
gebelin et al .
( 2013 ) found that the target genes of tpd - related micrornas were associated with rb , ros - scavenging systems , and pcd. by identifying and analyzing tpd - related genes in rubber tree bark , li et al .
( 2016 ) further reported that the tpd - related genes significantly enriched in eight go terms and five kegg pathways were closely associated with ros metabolism , pcd , and rb. in this study , the hbtctp transcripts were higher in tpd rubber tree than healthy rubber one .
hbtctp indicated antioxidant activity in vitro .
interestingly , hbtctp also interacted with 17.5 kda heat shock family protein , and annexin .
shsps are molecular chaperones that prevent misfolding and irreversible aggregation of their client proteins ; moreover shsps have roles in differentiation , proteasomal degradation , anti - apoptotic property and development ( bakthisaran et al. , 2015 ) .
plant annexins are involved in abiotic stress responses ( divya et al. , 2010 ; huh et al. , 2010 ) and oxidative stress responses ( richards et al. , 2014 ) .
given the aforementioned results , hbtctp might participate tpd by regulating ros metabolism , pcd , and rb. conclusion in summary , hbtctp was regulated by drought , low temperature , high salt , et , wounding , h2o2 , and meja .
hbtctp was localized in the membrane , cytoplasm , and nucleus of rice protoplasts .
being similar to hbtctp1 , hbtctp indicated antioxidant activity in vitro .
interacting with hbref , 17.5 kda heat shock protein , annexin , and ref - like stress related protein 1 , hbtctp might be involved in tpd by regulating ros metabolism , pcd , and rb pathways in rubber tree .

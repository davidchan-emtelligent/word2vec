various approaches can be applied to uncover the genetic basis of natural phenotypic variation , each with their specific strengths and limitations .
here , we use a replicated genome - wide association approach ( pool - gwas ) to fine - scale map genomic regions contributing to natural variation in female abdominal pigmentation in drosophila melanogaster , a trait that is highly variable in natural populations and highly heritable in the laboratory .
we examined abdominal pigmentation phenotypes in approximately 8000 female european d. melanogaster , isolating 1000 individuals with extreme phenotypes .
we then used whole - genome illumina sequencing to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) segregating in our sample , and tested these for associations with pigmentation by contrasting allele frequencies between replicate pools of light and dark individuals .
we identify two small regions near the pigmentation genes tan and bric - a - brac 1 , both corresponding to known cis - regulatory regions , which contain snps showing significant associations with pigmentation variation .
while the pool - gwas approach suffers some limitations , its cost advantage facilitates replication and it can be applied to any non - model system with an available reference genome .
author summary phenotypic variation is abundant in natural populations , but its genetic basis is not always well - understood .
here , we examine the genetic basis of body pigmentation in drosophila , a trait with a long history of study in drosophila genetics and evolution .
we conducted the first genome - wide scan for polymorphism associated with pigmentation variation in a large natural sample of d. melanogaster , and found snps near two genes , tan and bric - a - brac 1 , affecting the trait .
the snps associated with pigmentation variation in these genes appear to act by affecting the regulation of the pigmentation genes , rather than their protein coding sequence .

introduction phenotypic variation is abundant in natural populations , but usually its genetic basis is unknown. that is , even when the biochemical pathways that underlie a trait are well - understood , the identities of the alleles or genes which contribute to variation in natural populations are often not known .
this situation , however , is likely to soon change .
statistical genetic approaches originally developed for mapping complex genetic diseases have proved to be successful at mapping phenotypic differences segregating in natural populations , as long as the alleles underlying them are not rare and have reasonably large effects .
as a result , these approaches are particularly successful at uncovering the genetic basis of traits that differ due to local adaptation ( e.g. , [ 1 ] , [ 2 ]) or artificial selection ( e.g. , [ 3 ] - [ 5 ]) .
here , we examine the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in drosophila cuticle pigmentation .
in genetics , pigmentation has been a classically studied trait - - indeed , many of the first markers identified in drosophila melanogaster had pigmentation phenotypes [ 6 ] - - and has a well - understood genetic basis of moderate complexity , consisting of neither a single mendelian factor nor hundreds of genes [ 7 ] - [ 10 ] .
for evolutionary genetics , pigmentation has a number of desirable properties .
in d. melanogaster , pigmentation is highly variable in natural populations due to both genetic polymorphism and phenotypic plasticity [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , can differ between closely - related species [ 10 ] , [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] , and often does differ between sexes in the drosophila genus [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
in d. melanogaster , in particular , pigmentation shows patterns of spatial variation that suggest that local selection pressures might vary [ 18 ] - [ 20 ] .
the identification of genes responsible for differences in pigmentation can thus shed light on evolution , plasticity and sexual dimorphism in drosophila .
currently , there are at least 9 genes known to be directly involved in pigment synthesis pathways in drosophila [ 8 ] , [ 21 ] , and a number of other genes that can indirectly affect pigmentation patterns through spatial signaling or sex - specific regulation ( e.g. , bab [ 16 ] and abd - b [ 22 ]) .
but it is not clear to what extent phenotypic variation in natural populations is due to variation at these loci , or to variation at uncharacterized pigmentation genes .
previously , variation in d. melanogaster has been studied via either studies of individual genes [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , or by crossing strains with different phenotypes [ 11 ] , [ 25 ] .
although these studies have identified interesting genes and regulatory regions , there has been , to date , no study simultaneously examining the contribution of all genes to pigmentation variation in a large sample of flies , as in a genome - wide association study ( gwas ) .
to accomplish this , we use a modified gwas approach , pool - gwas , in which individuals with extreme phenotypes are pooled by phenotype , and the pools genotyped and analyzed for differences in allele frequencies ( reviewed in [ 26 ]) .
here , we use pooled next generation sequencing to estimate allele frequency differences between phenotypic classes [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
as in other gwas studies , pool - gwas uses past recombination events in a large sample of individuals to map phenotypic variation to associated variants genome - wide , and can thus be used to survey much of the natural genetic diversity of an organism .
indeed , the short range over which linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) decays in d. melanogaster - - significant ld declines over just 200 bp in most regions of the genome [ 29 ] - [ 31 ] - - makes this species particularly well - suited for identifying the effect of small regions such as short cis - regulatory elements controlling pigmentation genes .
results / discussion to obtain material for this study , we collected more than 30,000 wild d. melanogaster flies from each of two locations , bolzano ( italy ) and vienna ( austria ) .
we divided these flies into five independent replicates ( two from vienna and three from bolzano ) , cultured a single generation of offspring in a common laboratory environment , and examined the abdominal pigmentation pattern of approximately 8000 of the female offspring (~ 1500 females per replicate ) .
we then selected from each replicate 100 of the darkest and lightest flies , as measured by the pigmentation area of the a7 tergite ( figure 1 ) , for whole genome illumina sequencing .
after performing various quality filtering steps , we tested ~ 3.3 million snps for allele frequency differences between dark and light flies using the cochran - mantel - haenszel ( cmh ) test , a test designed for meta - analysis of contingency tables summarizing data from different samples .
we found 17 snps that were significantly associated with female abdominal pigmentation [ at a false discovery rate ( fdr ) cutoff of 5 % ; text s1 ] .
as expected , these snps lie in or near known pigmentation genes , specifically tan and bab1 ( figure 2 ) .
most of the other highly ranked but non - significant snps also lie in or near pigmentation genes ( 79 % of the 100 most highly ranked snps are within 20 kb from the boundaries of tan , bab1 , or ebony ; text s2 ; table s1 ) .
interestingly , none of these high ranking snps lie in the coding sequence of those three genes , except at tan , where there is a single cluster of five synonymous mutations within 60 bp of one another .
instead , the significantly associated snps appear to cluster around previously characterized cis - regulatory regions of tan and bab1 .
for example , in the tan region , which harbors all but one of the 17 significant snps , a cluster of associated snps is located between the upstream genes cg15370 and gr8a .
this location corresponds precisely to the mse cis - regulatory element , which harbors variants responsible for pigmentation differences between the closely - related species d. santomea and d. yakuba ([ 15 ] ; figure 2b , left ) .
within the limits of correct orthology assignment , none of the putative causal alleles that lighten the cuticle in d. santomea correspond to the significant snps in this study .
in fact , no correspondence would be expected , as d. santomea and its close relatives appear to already have the inferred light allele seen here .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1003534.g001 figure 1 overview of the experimental design .
wild d. melanogaster flies were collected from vienna , austria , and bolzano , italy , brought into a controlled environment in the laboratory , and treated as shown in the figure .
the same procedure was used for all five replicates , with each replicate resulting in 1,500 females for phenotyping , and with 100 light and dark flies from each replicate sequenced .

c ) detailed view of top ranked polymorphisms located within or close to the three pigmentation genes .
for every gene , the most significant snps fall in regulatory regions .
similarly , the most significant snps in the bab region also correspond to previously described regulatory regions .
the bab locus consists of two paralogous genes , bab1 and bab2 , both affecting abdominal pigmentation , with the segment scored here ( a7 ) affected primarily by bab1 activity [ 17 ] , [ 32 ] .
the significant snp in bab1 maps to the " dimorphic " regulatory element in the first intron of this gene , which upregulates bab1 in females , and represses it in males ([ 17 ] ; figure 2b , middle ) .
the remaining highly ranked , but non - significant bab snps fall into regions that are plausibly also regulatory - - a second region within the first intron of bab1 ( downstream of the " dimorphic " element ) , and a third region near the promoter region of bab1 - - though they have not been validated with functional genetic studies .
finally , the highest ranked snp outside of the tan and bab regions lies in the male repressor module of ebony , which affects pigmentation in males ([ 23 ] ; figure 2b , right ) , though this snp was also non - significantly associated with the phenotype , likely due to the conservative criteria used to determine the fdr cutoff ( see text s1 ) .
thus far , we have considered all replicates from the two populations jointly .
to gain insight into the strength and robustness of these associations , we also invested the consistency of the significant snps across populations .
we therefore analyzed the viennese and bolzano samples separately .
the tan region , which was strongly associated with pigmentation in the joint analysis , remained significantly associated in the separate analyses .
all 3 of the snps in the viennese sample that fell below the 5 % fdr cutoff , and all 7 in the bolzano sample , were in the tan region ( with the three most significant snps being identical in the two analyses ; figures s1 , s2 , s3 and tables s1 , s2 , s3 ) .
while no significant associations were found with snps lying in the bab region in the separate analyses , several bab snps remain highly ranked .
we further investigated our power to detect significant associations using only one replicate , i.e. , one light and one dark sample from either vienna or bolzano ( analysis done with 5 paired replicates , not shown ) .
here , the decline in power is even more apparent ; in these analyses , the number of significant associations ranged from 0 to 3 ( mean = 0.8 across the 5 replicates at an fdr level of 0.05 ) .
this contrast clearly shows the utility of replication , as analyses of single replicates often did not identify even those snps with strong effects after accounting for multiple testing .
in general , then , our results are remarkably consistent across populations .
this is perhaps not surprising , as european drosophila populations are quite similar genetically [ 33 ] , and as the cmh test favors associations that are consistent across populations .
we were interested , however , in whether or not there were associations specific to either the vienna or bolzano populations. of the four snps that were below the 5 % fdr cutoff in the bolzano , but not in the viennese analysis , only one showed non - overlapping 95 % confidence limits for the odds - ratios in the two populations , suggesting that these snps were not significant in the viennese sample due only to a lack of statistical power ( note that none of these snps were excluded for not meeting the filtering criteria in the viennese population ; data not shown ) .
we further investigated the non - significant associations at tan , bab , or ebony regions for evidence of population - specificity , as population specificity may explain why some snps were highly ranked , but non - significant , in the combined analysis .
there were some indications of other population - specific associations in the bab and ebony regions ; e.g. , snps in the bab1 promoter region discussed above tend to be highly ranked in only one of the populations ( text s3 and figure s3 ) .
one explanation for such differences might be that there are unscored causative variants linked to different snps in each population , with two prime suspects for these unscored causal variants being segregating indels and transposable elements .
we examined the data for evidence of differences in frequencies of transposable element insertions and indels in the tan , bab and ebony regions .
in particular , we looked for indels or te insertions with larger differences in frequencies than the surrounding snps .
while some indels in these regions showed suggestive associations with pigmentation , none had frequency differences between light and dark pools that were as large as that of the least significant snp ( which showed an average difference in frequency between light and dark pools of ~ 31 % ; table s4 ) .
in addition , we found no evidence for strong differences in frequency of any transposable element insertions in these regions ( using the method in [ 34 ] ; table s5 ) .
thus , we find that female abdominal pigmentation maps to regulatory regions of well - known pigmentation loci .
this variation is also associated with sequence variants at ebony .
interestingly , regulatory variation in tan and ebony are also implicated in pigmentation differences between two north american drosophila species ( not closely related to d. melanogaster ; [ 10 ]) , and tan may also play a role in the pigmentation differences found between d. yakuba and the island species d. santomea [ 15 ] , [ 35 ] ( but see [ 36 ]) .
it is tempting to argue that there is some property of tan that predisposes it to respond to selection , such as might be the case for the melanocortin receptor 1 gene in vertebrates ( reviewed in [ 37 ]) , though there are other cases where tan does not appear to be the main factor affecting pigmentation variation ( e.g. , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ]) .
in the case of d. melanogaster pigmentation variation , there is some evidence that pigmentation may be under balancing selection [ 19 ] , [ 40 ] - [ 42 ] , which can elevate causal alleles to intermediate frequencies [ 43 ] .
further , balancing selection may have acted on this phenotype long - term , as there appears to be adaptive variation in pigmentation in african d. melanogaster [ 19 ] ; in this case , recombination may have had adequate time to break down linkage disequilibrium between the functional variants and nearby snps .
as a result , the identification of functional variation mapping to very small regions within the drosophila genome may have been facilitated beyond the genome - wide low linkage disequilibrium in d. melanogaster [ 29 ] - [ 31 ] .
as proof of concept , this study demonstrates the power of a pool - gwas approach for investigating the genetic basis of natural variation .
comparison to previous studies analyzing the same or similar phenotypes highlights some of the advantages of pool - gwas .
our results are consistent with those of [ 19 ] , who mapped pigmentation variation in a different ( though correlated [ 44 ]) abdominal segment to the x and 3rd chromosomes in african populations , and were able to associate it to sequence variants at ebony .
genome - wide , however , their resolution was limited to the chromosome level .
previous quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) mapping of female abdominal pigmentation identified only the bab region as the major contributor to variation in the trait [ 11 ] , [ 25 ] , possibly because the small number of parental strains used in these studies had similar tan alleles .
pool - gwas , however , unlike qtl mapping , surveys a large sample of natural variation , making it less likely that alleles contributing to the trait are excluded from the analysis .
a follow - up association study did use a large sample of strains , but focused only on bab , and failed to identify individual snps strongly associated with pigmentation variation [ 24 ] .
this result might be due to background variation at the tan locus confounding attempts to detect associations at bab .
pool - gwas avoids these pitfalls by simultaneously surveying variation in many strains and genome - wide , revealing that both tan and bab influence pigmentation .
pool - gwas is appealing to biologists working on non - model organisms for various reasons .
first , it is low cost relative to many other gwas approaches - - sequencing pools of individuals is far less expensive than individual sequencing [ 27 ] , and unlike many standard gwas analyses , it requires no development of snp chips or resources other than a reference genome. and , as whole - genome sequencing is used , significant associations do not have to rely on high levels of long - range linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped snps ; as a result , strong associations can be found with relatively small sample sizes [ 45 ] .
finally , while drosophila pigmentation is a well - understood genetic trait , and the associated snps map to pigmentation genes , in principle , associated snps could have been detected anywhere in the genome , allowing for discovery of loci that affect a trait , but which have not been previously described .
approaches similar to this one have been attempted in the past .
pooling of samples , of course , has long been a cost saving measure , and has been used in bulk segregant analysis ( e.g. , [ 46 ] , [ 47 ]) , and in standard gwas ( reviewed in [ 26 ]) , coupled with whole genome sequencing [ 28 ] , and in a quantitative trait mapping gwas experiment [ 48 ] .
finally , several recent " evolve and resequence " experiments have used pooled sequencing to measure shifts in allele frequencies in populations subjected to multiple generations of natural or artificial selection , in an attempt to discover loci affected by the selection regime ( e.g. , [ 49 ] - [ 53 ]) .
except for the larger number of generations , these experiments are similar to the process used here .
however , in spite of the similarities between this and these previous approaches , there are some important differences .
unlike some of these previous approaches , we use replication as part of the experimental design , which increases the power to detect effects .
in contrast to experimental designs requiring crosses or selection sustained over generation , no crosses or laboratory breeding of animals are required ( although , for this study , we do rear one generation in a controlled environment ) .
eliminating this requirement not only reduces labor and costs , but also allows the method to be applied to organisms that cannot be easily bred in the laboratory .
in practice , too , the need to propagate from parental populations or strains usually limits the amount of natural variation that can be surveyed , whereas starting with a very large natural sample allows the starting material to capture both large numbers of segregating alleles and as many historical recombination events as possible , rather than including only those that persist during an artificial or natural selection experiment .
despite offering quite a few advantages , pool - gwas also suffers from some limitations .
the cost - effectiveness of pooling samples comes at the expense of obtaining reliable estimates of the effects of individual alleles , though it seems that the alleles can be robustly ranked by the strength of their effects ( as shown by simulation ; text s2 , figure s4 ; table s6 for the ranks of snps in tan and bab1 ) .
like other gwas methods , pool - gwas is expected to have little power to analyze traits with very complex genetic bases , and the power to detect the contribution of rare alleles is limited .
consistent with this , the snps with the strongest signals in this study were at high frequencies in the control sample compared to unassociated snps [ comparison of 100 random snps with 17 snps with fdr < 0.05 : wilcoxin rank sum test , p = 8.1e - 05 ( vienna ) and p = 0.000117 ( bolzano ) , figure s10 ] .
to investigate the effectiveness of pool - gwas under a range of biological conditions , we performed simulations using a coalescent sample of 8000 haploid individuals , each with a genome roughly equivalent to the euchromatic portion of the d. melanogaster genome , and with similar levels of variability and recombination rates ( text s4 ) .
these simulations show that , as expected , the power of pool - gwas is higher when the minor allele frequencies of causal snps are higher , and when there are few causal sites affecting the trait ( figures s5 , s6 , s7 , s8 , s9 ) .
pool - gwas is , therefore , unlikely to be particularly successful for mapping disease loci , which may usually be at low frequencies ; rather , we anticipate pool - gwas will be best implemented as a means of uncovering the genetic basis of ecologically interesting traits in non - model organisms in a cost - effective manner .
methods sample collection d. melanogaster were collected from vineyard waste heaps , with approximately 30,000 flies collected in vienna , austria in october 2010 , and a similar number in bolzano , italy in september 2011 .
after collection , flies were randomly divided into two experimental replicates for vienna or three replicates for bolzano , put into fresh culture bottles at a density of ~ 200 flies per bottle , and allowed to lay eggs at 25degreesc for 2 - 4 hours .
bottles were kept at 25degreesc until the emergence of f1 adults , after which the newly emerged flies were kept at 18degreesc for several days to allow adult pigmentation to fully develop [ 12 ] .
pigmentation scoring we scored approximately 3,500 adult f1 females from vienna and almost 5,000 adult f1 females from bolzano for abdominal pigmentation , measured via the extent of dark pigmentation on the last tergite ( abdominal segment 7 , a7 ) in lateral view .
a7 pigmentation reflects overall posterior pigmentation [ 35 ] , which is more variable than anterior pigmentation in females [ 12 ] , [ 54 ] .
to score pigmentation , all flies were initially divided into five pigmentation classes , ranging from 0 ( no pigmentation ) to 4 ( completely pigmented ) .
we then isolated 100 of the lightest class 0 flies and 100 of the darkest class 4 flies from each replicate for sequencing ( i.e. , a total of 400 and 600 flies from vienna and bolzano , respectively ) .
in addition , three sets of control flies ( not selected for pigmentation ) , consisting of between 100 - 160 flies each , were sequenced for each population .
dna extraction and sequencing genomic dna was extracted from each pool of female flies by chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation , and used for paired - end libraries preparation with standard kits and protocols , to obtain fragments of ~ 350 bp after gel - purification ( or ~ 450 bp for all samples from replicate i of the viennese sample ) .
libraries were amplified using phusion dna polymerase ( new england biolabs , ipswich , ma ) using a 65degreesc annealing temperature and 10 cycles of amplification , and then purified and quantified using the qubit hs assay kit ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
libraries were sequenced using the 2x101 bp or 2x151 bp paired - end protocol on either a genome analyzer iix or a hiseq2000 ( see text s1 for details ) .
mapping of reads following [ 55 ] , we trimmed raw reads to remove low quality bases and mapped them to the d. melanogaster reference genome ( v5.18 ) , wolbachia pipientis wmel strain ( nc _ 002978.6 ) and phix174 ( nc _ 001422.1 ) using bwa [ v0.5.8c [ 56 ]] with the following parameters : seeding of the reads disabled ( - l 200 ) , 1 % missing alignments assuming an error rate of 2 % ( - n 0.01 ) , maximum number of two gap openings ( - o 2 ) and a maximum gap extension of 12 bases ( - e 12 , - d 12 ) .
the mapped reads were filtered for a mapping quality of 20 and for proper pairs with samtools ( v0.1.9 [ 57 ]) .
due to the overlap in ranges of d. melanogaster and d. simulans and the difficulty of distinguishing females of these species , we suspected some d. simulans contamination among the sequenced flies , which may yield false positive associations as the species can differ in pigmentation [ 54 ] .
a screen of the wild caught males using diagnostic male genitalia differences [ 58 ] yielded an estimate of d. simulans contamination of around 1 % in both collections .
we thus filtered the mapped reads for d. simulans contamination , by simultaneously remapping the above reads to five d. melanogaster genomes ( including the reference genome v.5.18 cited above and those of the mw6 , mw28 , ral360 , ral732 strains from the drosophila population genomics project ( http :// www.dpgp.org /) and five d. simulans genomes ( unpublished data ) , using gsnap version 2011 - 12 - 28 [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] .
reads were identified as d. melanogaster if they mapped at least as well to d. melanogaster as to d. simulans , as measured by mapping quality .
the effectiveness of this filtering procedure was assessed by inspecting the filtered d. melanogaster specific reads for a target set of d. simulans specific variants ( text s1 and figure s11a and s11b ) ; we considered the filtering procedure to be effective when the median frequency of the target set of d. simulans alleles was reduced to zero .
the filtered reads were then converted to mpileup format using samtools ( without quality score adjustment , using option - b ) , with one replicate - phenotype combination per column .
all further analyses were performed using scripts contained in popoolation2 revision 98 [ 61 ] .
we prepared the mpileup file for each population by converting them to synchronized files , requiring a base quality of at least 20 , and by masking indels and repetitive regions ( including five flanking nucleotides on both sides of an indel ) , separately for the two populations .
repetitive regions ( e.g. transposable elements , microsatellites ) were identified using repeatmasker v .
3.2.8 ( www.repeatmasker.org ) with crossmatch version 0.990329 ( http :// www.phrap.org / phredphrapconsed.html ) as the search engine ; simple repeats were not masked ( repeatmasker option - nolow ) .
after undergoing all filtering procedures , an average of 112 - fold coverage per replicate was obtained ( see text s1 for individual coverage estimates for each of the 16 separate data sets ) .
association mapping we tested snps showing an association with pigmentation using the cochran - mantel - haenszel ( cmh ) test , a meta - analysis method for repeated measures of independence , as implemented in popoolation2 revision 176 [ 61 ] .
essentially , a 2x2 contingency table is created for each replicate , with phenotype ( light vs. dark ) and the two major allele variants at each snp as the independent nominal variables , and the counts of each allele in each phenotypic category as dependent variables .
the cmh test tests independence of the nominal variables across replicates .
we analyzed only snps that met the following requirements : ( i ) the snp must contain two alleles that occur at least five times each across all samples , ( ii ) the site must have a coverage of at least 10 in each sample , and ( iii ) to avoid including differences between paralogs and other artifacts due to copy number variation , the site must have a coverage lower than a maximum cutoff set independently for each sample .
this maximum cutoff excludes sites with coverage in the upper 2 % tail of coverage for all sites .
to correct for multiple tests , we used a fdr control ( see text s1 and figure s12 ) .
indels and transposable element insertions in the regions surrounding the tan , bab , and ebony genes were identified and tested for associations as described in text s1 .
feature analysis of the best ranked snps we used snpeff v2.0.3 [ 62 ] and the d. melanogaster annotation v5.40 to assign candidate snps to genomic features .
snps not further than 200 bases from the 5'or 3'utr of a gene were considered upstream or downstream , snps further than were considered intergenic .
overlapping or alternative spliced genes were treated separately .

figure s4 comparison of effect estimates from the cmh test and logistic regression on simulated snps .
shown are the results of 500 simulations of selection for extreme phenotypes for a quantitative trait .
for each simulation , individual and pooled genotypes were collected for 20 snps , each with a frequency between 0.4 and 0.6 and a positive or negative effect on the trait mean , drawn from a uniform distribution ( with the absolute value constrained between 0.5 and 1 in order to keep the range of estimated effect similar to those of the experiment ) .
an environmental contribution to the trait was simulated by drawing a random normal deviate with a variance equal to that of the genetic variance in the trait .
the plotted effect estimates are , for the top panel , the absolute value of the log of the pooled odds ratio estimate from the cmh test , and for the bottom panel , the absolute value of the logistic regression coefficient ( already on a log - scale ) .
the magnitude of this effect is a function of the probability of an allele at that snp causing the individual carrying it to fall into the light or dark extreme .
for comparison , the absolute value of the effect on the trait mean is shown on each plot in blue .
note that this is a different quantity than the estimated effects from the statistical tests , so the magnitudes of the two quantities are uninformative , and these are plotted only to show which snps have very similar or very different effects on the trait means .

figure s8 replicability of p - values causal snps with equal effects .
to investigate the extent to which we expect our results to be repeatable given the same causal loci , effects and allele frequencies in the population before selection is applied , we performed some additional simulations .
to this end , we used a similar approach as above , but fixed a random seed such that the causal loci and their effects were identical among replicates .
some stochastic effects remain : the division of flies into replicates and change in individual phenotypes due to the environment varied between simulations ( the proportion of the phenotype due to the environment was set to 0.5 ) .
we then ran 20 simulations and assessed the consistency of results between runs .
different numbers of causal loci were assigned to regions of the simulated genomes corresponding to the tan and bab regions , with l = 1 , 5 , 10 , or 20 per locus .
as the strongest candidates from the analysis of the data are at intermediate frequencies in the unselected reference populations , we required the causal loci to have a maf between 0.2 and 0.5 .
as an indication of repeatability of the simulation results , we use the range of p - values from the cmh test ( the maximum of the 20 p - values minus the minimum ) .
the range of p - values is plotted against the minor allele frequency ( maf ) of the causal snps .
causal snps are shown in the plots as points , with snps with high minimum p - values shown in gray ( p - value always > 1 e - 05 , roughly indicating repeatably non - significant snps ) , those with intermediate minimum p - values shown in red ( minimum p - value < 1 e - 05 and > 1 e - 07 ) .
note that with loci having equal effects , a higher number of causal snps necessarily results in smaller phenotypic effect per locus .
the plots show that those simulations with few loci have highly repeatable results , while the effect of the maf in this restricted range is not very pronounced .

figure s10 allele frequencies in the control samples from vienna and bolzano .
shown are frequencies of minor allele frequencies in the control samples from both populations for random vs. highly ranked snps .
random snps are a randomly drawn subset of the ~ 3.3 million snps that met our filtering criteria in the combined analysis of the bolzano and vienna populations , but which did not occur among the top 200 snps ranked by p - value .

figure s11 result of treatment for d. simulans contamination .
samples were treated to filter d. simulans contamination as described in the methods , and then assessed for contamination both before and after treatment .
( a ) level of contamination in the four viennese samples [ light and dark samples from both replicate i ( ri ) and replicate ii ( rii )] before ( upper panel ) and after ( lower panel ) treatment .
the light sample of replicate i shows the highest level of contamination of the four samples .
( b ) level of contamination in the six bolzano samples [ light and dark from ri , rii , and riii ] before ( upper part ) and after ( lower part ) treatment .
while the dark samples of the three replicates show a minimal level of contamination , all three light samples are highly contaminated .
note that the contamination was successfully filtered from each contaminated sample in vienna and bolzano .

table s4 differences in indel frequencies in the regions near the tan , bab1 and ebony loci .
these regions are defined , as before , as 20 kb up - and down - stream of the center of the coding sequence of each gene ( within 20 kb of the middle of the coding sequence of these genes ) ; indels are found as described in text s1 with dindel .
as dindel divides the reads in these regions into windows , some indels occur in more than one window .
in these cases , the presence and absence counts of these indels were usually quite similar , and so we give the average coverage and frequency and the minimum and maximum p - values .
similarly , indels with adjacent positions are also merged into a single entry , and the same information is reported for these .

table s5 transposable element insertion frequencies in the pigmentation genes tan , bab1 and ebony .
these regions are defined , as before , as 20 kb up - and down - stream of the center of the coding sequence of each gene .
transposable element insertions found in these regions using the method described in text s1 , except that insertions detected in only one replicate are not shown .
a cmh test was performed on the presence and absence counts for each detected insertion .
some frequency estimates may be unreliable , as they come from insertions that overlap with other insertions or , in one case , from an ine - 1 insertion , which are typically very short ; these are nevertheless shown for completeness .

table s6 estimated effects of snps with fdr < 0.05 .
the effect of each snp is ranked by its log odds ratio , as discussed in the text .
the p - values and odds ratios come from the cmh test used for the main analysis , and ranks are based on the magnitude of the log of the odds ratio .
we use the magnitude of the log of the odds ratio to estimate the rank of the effect , as is standard , for the following reason : for a snp of no effect , the odds ratio should be 1 ( and the log odds ratio equal to 0 ) .
the size of the estimated effect increases as the odds ratio deviates in either direction from 1 ( and the log odds from 0 ) .
but , as odds ratios are restricted between 0 and infinity , this deviation is a non - linear function of the size of the real effect .
the log odds , in contrast , is symmetric about 0 , and the size of this deviation in either direction is expected to be proportional to the size of the effect .
though the effects here are systematically overestimated , the rankings appear to be robust as discussed in text s2 .

chlamydia trachomatis genital infection continues to be an important public health problem worldwide due to its increasing incidence. c. trachomatis infection can lead to severe sequelae , such as pelvic inflammatory disease , obstructive infertility , and preterm birth .
recently , it has been suggested that the cervico - vaginal microbiota may be an important defense factor toward c. trachomatis infection as well as the development of chronic sequelae .
therefore , the investigation of microbial profiles associated to chlamydial infection is of the utmost importance .
here we present a pilot study aiming to characterize , through the metagenomic analysis of sequenced 16s rrna gene amplicons , the cervical microbiota from reproductive age women positive to c. trachomatis infection .
the main finding of our study showed a marked increase in bacterial diversity in asymptomatic c. trachomatis positive women as compared to healthy controls in terms of shannon 's diversity and shannon 's evenness ( p = 0.031 and p = 0.026 , respectively ) .
more importantly , the cervical microbiota from c. trachomatis positive women and from healthy controls significantly separated into two clusters in the weighted unifrac analysis ( p = 0.0027 ) , suggesting that differences between the two groups depended entirely on the relative abundance of bacterial taxa rather than on the types of bacterial taxa present .
furthermore , c. trachomatis positive women showed an overall decrease in lactobacillus spp. and an increase in anaerobes .
these findings are part of an ongoing larger epidemiological study that will evaluate the potential role of distinct bacterial communities of the cervical microbiota in c. trachomatis infection .
chlamydia trachomatis asymptomatic infection cervical microbiota next - generation sequencing bacterial diversity sapienza universita di roma10.13039 / 501100004271c26a15pc5n introduction in recent years , a growing body of evidence highlighted that the cervico - vaginal microbiota plays a key role in the outcomes of genital infections ( ma et al. , 2012 ) .
in healthy reproductive women , the cervico - vaginal microbiota is mostly populated by lactobacillus spp. , whose presence can be considered as a hallmark of healthy conditions ( ma et al. , 2012 ; van de wijgert et al. , 2014 ) .
indeed , to date , it is widely accepted that cervico - vaginal lactobacilli may have a significant impact on individual susceptibility to genital infections ( brotman , 2011 ; buve et al. , 2014 ) .
specifically , lactobacilli are the main host defense factor within the cervico - vaginal ecosystem , since they are able to limit the growth of potential pathogens through different mechanisms , including the competitive exclusion , competition for nutrients , anti - microbial compound production , the immune system activation as well as the maintenance of a low vaginal ph ( mijac et al. , 2006 ; vielfort et al. , 2008 ; o'hanlon et al. , 2013 ; doerflinger et al. , 2014 ) .
in addition to lactobacilli , other microorganisms populate the cervico - vaginal microbiota , like , for example , prevotella spp. , gardnerella vaginalis , and atopobium vaginae .
the replacement of the lactobacillus spp. , with these microorganisms may result in the switch from a healthy genital microbiota to a dysbiosis defined as bacterial vaginosis ( bv ) ( srinivasan et al. , 2012 ; dols et al. , 2016 ) .
bv has been associated , in turn , with an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases , including chlamydia trachomatis ( hillier et al. , 1992 ; wiesenfeld et al. , 2003 ; brotman et al. , 2010 ; petrova et al. , 2015 ). c. trachomatis is the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases and it is responsible for cervicitis , salpingitis , and endometritis ( world health organization , 2012 ) .
in particular , it has been observed that women with bv may be at a higher risk for c. trachomatis cervicitis , as suggested by a high nugent score (> 7 ) in ~ 85 % of c. trachomatis infected women ( yoshimura et al. , 2009 ) .
more interesting , there is the evidence that c. trachomatis genital infection increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) by three - to four - fold ( galvin and cohen , 2004 ; buckner et al. , 2016 ) as well as of developing human papilloma virus ( hpv ) induced cervical carcinoma ( jensen et al. , 2014 ; silva et al. , 2014 ) .
nowadays , c. trachomatis infection continues to be an important public health problem worldwide because of its increasing incidence ( world health organization , 2012 ) .
indeed , a 24 % rise in the number of new cases has been observed since 2008 and this is likely due to a higher awareness of the impact of c. trachomatis infection on female reproductive outcomes ( newman et al. , 2015 ) .
in fact , c. trachomatis genital infection can lead to severe sequelae , such as pelvic inflammatory disease , ectopic pregnancy , obstructive infertility as well as miscarriages and preterm birth ( mylonas , 2012 ; lanjouw et al. , 2016 ) , and the risk of these long - term reproductive sequelae is likely increased by the high rate ( 80 %) of asymptomatic infections ( sessa et al. , 2015 ; lanjouw et al. , 2016 ) .
recently , several studies have demonstrated the protective activity of vaginal lactobacillus spp. , as well as of other host defense factors present in the healthy cervico - vaginal micro - environment , toward c. trachomatis infection ( mastromarino et al. , 2014 ; nardini et al. , 2016 ; sessa et al. , 2017a,b ) .
specifically , it has been showed that lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus brevis are able to interfere with the early phases of c. trachomatis infection as well as to inhibit its intracellular replication , preventing the dissemination of the infection in the host ( mastromarino et al. , 2014 ; sessa et al. , 2017a ) .
therefore , the complex interplay between the cervico - vaginal microbiota and c. trachomatis seems to be critical for the onset of chlamydial infection and the development of severe sequelae .
given that alterations in microbial communities of the genital tract may affect the susceptibility to c. trachomatis , investigating the composition of cervical microbiota associated to chlamydial infection is of the utmost importance .
therefore , here we present a pilot study aiming to characterize , through the metagenomic analysis of sequenced 16s rrna gene amplicons , the cervical microbiota from reproductive age women with asymptomatic c. trachomatis infection .
materials and methods study design and sample collection from may to september 2016 , 45 consecutive women of italian origin , attending the department of gynaecology , obstetrics and urology at " sapienza " university of rome for regular check - ups , were enrolled in this study .
all women were not pregnant , of reproductive age , and regularly menstruating .
women with recent or current antibiotic and / or hormonal medications ( oral or topic ) , as well as use of probiotics and / or prebiotics , were excluded from the study .
all study participants gave their written informed consent prior to sampling and provided a detailed personal , medical and gynecological history .
this study design and protocol was approved by the umberto i university hospital ethical committee ( reference number 367 / 16 ) and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the declaration of helsinki. from each woman , one endo - cervical swab ( floq swabs , copan ) was collected for c. trachomatis testing as previously described ( frieden et al. , 2015 ) , and for the metagenomic analysis .
all the women negative to c. trachomatis infection were also screened for neisseria gonorrhoeae , trichomonas vaginalis , mycoplasma , candida , hpv , and hsv - 2 infections as previously described ( frieden et al. , 2015 ) , in order to include exclusively women with healthy genital conditions .
all study participants were also examined for bv and for the presence of symptoms .
bv was assessed using amsel criteria and confirmed using gram stain criteria ( nugent score ) .
lastly , no women had any specific genital symptoms related to chlamydial infections .
all endo - cervical samples were placed in cryovials containing 1 ml of phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) and immediately stored at - 80degreesc until further processing .
next - generation sequencing cervical samples were shipped in dry ice to microsynth ag ( balgach , switzerland ) for dna isolation , 16s rrna gene amplification , illumina miseq sequencing and initial bioinformatics analysis , consisting of raw data processing and taxonomic classification .
dna isolation cervical samples were thawed and transferred into 2 ml screwcap tubes ( sarstedtinc , germany ) containing 10 mul of 4 % tween 80 ( downey et al. , 2012 ) .
tubes were , then , vortexed for 2 min on a turbomix system ( scientific industries , usa ) and 350 mul of the sample were used for dna isolation .
total dna was extracted using the qiamp investigator kit ( qiagen , usa ) , according to manufacturer 's instructions .
dna was quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy ( quant - it ( tm ) picogreen ( r ) dsdna assay kit , thermo fisher , usa ) and its integrity checked by agarose gel electrophoresis .
16s rrna gene amplification and illumine miseq sequencing dual - indexed universal primers 341f ( cctacgggnggcwgcag ) and 802r ( gactachvgggtatctaatcc ; illumina , usa ) were utilized for the two - steps pcr amplification of the v3 - v4 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene ( 16s / its nextera two - step pcr kit , illumina inc. , usa ) , according to manufacturer 's instruction .
briefly , the first - step pcr was carried on to amplify the v3 - v4 region of the 16s rrna gene .
the resulting pcr amplicons were then used for the second - step pcr for further amplification and inclusion of indexes ( barcodes ) as well as the illumina sequencing adaptors .
cycling conditions were initial denaturation at 95degreesc for 3 min , followed by 20 cycles ( for the first - step pcr ) or 15 cycles ( for the second - step pcr ) of denaturation at 98degreesc for 20 s , annealing at 56degreesc for 30 s and elongation at 72degreesc for 30 s , one cycle of final elongation at 72degreesc for 5 min and a final cooling step to 10degreesc .
the resulting pcr products were quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy ( quant - it ( r ) picogreen ( r ) dsdna assay kit , thermo fisher , usa ) , pooled in equimolar amounts and , then , purified with agencourt ampure - xp magnetic beads ( beckman coulter , usa ) .
the final library containing all the pooled samples was sequenced with version 2 of miseq reagent kit , 2 x 250 bp output , on a miseq desktop sequencer ( illumina , usa ) .
one negative control ( 350 mul of sterile pbs ) was included and subjected to the same procedures as the samples .
sequencing data analysis miseq paired - end reads were subjected to demultiplexing and trimming of illumina adaptor residuals using illumina recommended parameter settings ( illumina miseq reporter software , version 2.5.1.3 ) .
sequences were aligned and joined using fast length adjustment of short reads ( flash , version 1.2.11 ) ( magoc and salzberg , 2011 ) and primers trimmed off the aligned sequences using cutadapt ( version 1.8.1 ) ( martin , 2011 ) .
chimeric sequences were identified and removed by uchime ( version 4.2 ) ( edgar et al. , 2011 ) and only joined reads with an average quality score of 25 or higher were used for downstream analysis .
open reference operational taxonomic unit ( otu ) clustering and taxonomic assignment were performed in qiime ( version 1.9.1 ) ( caporaso et al. , 2010 ) using uclust against the silva rrna reference database ( version 111 ) ( edgar , 2010 ; quast et al. , 2013 ) .
an otu was defined as a group of sequences with a similarity of 97 % or more .
otus with only one sequence ( singletons ) and those not found more than 10 times in any sample were excluded from the downstream analysis to minimize artifacts .
otus that could not be identified to a species level using the reference database , were searched using blast and assigned to the deepest taxonomical level based on available published data .
taxa summaries were performed in qiime and all samples were normalized to the sample with the lowest read count for alpha and beta diversity comparisons .
shannon 's diversity index and shannon 's evenness were used as metrics for alpha rarefaction analysis , which was performed in qiime .
jackknifed principal coordinates analyses ( pcoa ) was used so to assure that our rarefaction selection was not the cause of the observed clustering patterns .
pcoa analysis was based on unweighted and weighted unifrac distance matrixes and computed in qiime ( lozupone and knight , 2005 ; lozupone et al. , 2007 ) .
for taxa comparisons , relative abundances based on all obtained reads were used .
raw sequences were deposited into the ncbi 's sequence read archive ( sra ) ( https :// trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / traces / sra / sra.cgi ?) , accession number srp098954 .
statistical analysis non - parametric t - test based on monte carlo permutations was used for alpha diversity comparisons , kruskal - wallis test for taxa level comparisons , and adonis for category comparisons of distance matrixes , all calculated in qiime .
benjamin - hochberg false discovery rate ( fdr ) correction was used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing when necessary .
all remaining statistical calculations were performed in excel ( microsoft , usa ) and r 3.1.2 ( r development core team ) .
chi - squared test was used for assessment of association of frequencies among groups ( fisher 's exact test was used when any cell had expected values < 5 ) .
mann - whitney u - test for non - parametric data was used for comparison of means .
the single or multiple inference significance level was set to 5 % .
results study subject characteristics forty - five asymptomatic women of reproductive age were enrolled in this study .
ten women were positive to c. trachomatis ( chlamydia group ) and 35 were negative .
amongst the latter , 15 women were positive to other sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) and , hence , were excluded from further analysis , whereas the remaining 20 were defined as healthy controls .
all 30 samples underwent 16s rrna amplicon - based microbiome analysis and 16 samples were excluded from downstream analysis due to a number of reads < 100 .
overall , the cervical microbiome analysis was performed on 14 cervical samples from 7 c. trachomatis positive women and 7 healthy controls .
population characteristics are summarized in table 1 .
no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups according to the risk factors commonly associated with c. trachomatis infection .

cervical microbiota composition an average of 121,824 [ median ( iqr ) 135,943 ( 77,506 )] and 183,689 [ median ( iqr ) 192,095 ( 17,689 )] paired - end illumina reads were analyzed per sample in healthy controls and chlamydia group , respectively .
after the removal of singletons and rare otus , a total number of 22 otus from 16 genera were identified [ median ( iqr ) = 9 ( 5 ) and 15 ( 5.5 ) for healthy controls and chlamydia groups , respectively ] .
the lowest read count was 29,613 and , hence , otus were randomly sub - sampled to 29,613 reads for further analysis to avoid sequencing bias .
the cervical microbiome in healthy controls was dominated by the phylum firmicutes ( median relative abundance 97.9 %) , while bacteria from the phyla actinobacteria , fusobacteria , proteobacteria , and tenericutes each accounted for < 1 % to total bacteria .
on genus level , lactobacillus was the single most abundant genus ( median relative abundance 96.2 %) ; other genera ( gardnerella , atopobium , bifidobacterium , etc. ) were present , each contributing for < 2 % to total bacteria .
specifically , l. crispatus or l. gasseri were the predominant species in the majority of healthy women ( 86 %) , whereas in the remaining women lactobacillus iners was the predominant species ( figures 1 , 2 ) .

the legend below the heatmap represents each participant .
the relative abundance of bacteria in each genus is indicated by a color gradient from black ( low abundance ) to yellow ( high abundance ) .
cervical samples from c. trachomatis positive women showed a decrease in the phylum firmicutes ( median relative abundance 60.2 % as compared to 97.9 % in healthy controls ) and an increase in the phyla actinobacteria ( median relative abundance 16.1 % as compared to 0.09 % in healthy controls ) .
amongst the firmicutes , lactobacillus spp. was less abundant in chlamydia groups than in healthy controls ( median relative abundance 60 and 98 % , respectively ) .
in particular , l. crispatus or l. gasseri proportion was reduced in c. trachomatis positive women as compared to healthy controls ( overall median relative abundance 89 and 32 % , respectively ; figures 1 , 2 ) .
actinobacteria were mostly represented by g. vaginalis ( median relative abundance 14.3 % as compared to 0.07 % in healthy controls ) .
prevotella spp. , belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes , was increased as well , with a median relative abundance of 0.5 and 0.0001 % in chlamydia group and healthy controls , respectively .
lastly , the proportion of strict and / or facultative anaerobes was much higher in c. trachomatis positive women ( median relative abundance 39.8 %) as compared to healthy controls ( median relative abundance 0.6 %) .
however , on phylum , class , order , family , genus , and otu levels , no statistically significant differences were observed between chlamydia - positive patients and healthy controls .
alpha and beta diversity analyses alpha diversity analysis showed that c. trachomatis genital infection was significantly associated to an increased diversity of the cervical microbiota , as evidenced by shannon 's diversity index and shannon 's evenness ( figures 3a,b , p = 0.031 and p = 0.026 , respectively ) .

in beta diversity analysis , cervical samples from healthy controls showed a tendency toward a statistically significant clustering , as compared to c. trachomatis positive women , in weighted unifrac analysis ( p = 0.0027 ) , suggesting shifts in relative taxa abundance .
in addition , the phylogenetic distances between c. trachomatis positive samples were significantly higher than the distances measured between healthy controls ( figure 3c , p = 0.000004 ) .
on the contrary , no clustering was observed when comparing unweighted unifrac distance matrixes ( figure 3d , p > 0.05 ) .
discussion this study investigates the cervical microbiota composition of reproductive age women with asymptomatic c. trachomatis genital infection. via the metagenomic analysis of 16s rrna gene amplicons , we were able to determine the diversity and richness of cervical microbiota from c. trachomatis positive patients in comparison to women with a healthy cervical micro - environment .
a variety of statistical approaches was used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the cervical microbiota in both groups .
our main findings highlighted a notable difference of the cervical microbiota of c. trachomatis positive women as compared to healthy controls .
in particular , we showed that the cervical microbiota in asymptomatic c. trachomatis infection had a higher microbial diversity than the cervical microbiota in healthy controls , as evidenced by the marked increase in shannon 's diversity index as well as in shannon 's evenness ( p = 0.031 and p = 0.026 , respectively ) .
more importantly , we observed that the cervical microbiota from c. trachomatis positive women and from healthy controls significantly separated into two clusters in the weighted unifrac analysis ( p = 0.0027 ) .
weighted unifrac is a beta diversity measure that considers the phylogenetic distances as well as differences in the relative abundance of taxa between two microbial communities ( lozupone et al. , 2007 ) .
on the contrary , no clustering was observed between the two groups according to the unweighted unifrac analysis ( p > 0.05 ) , a qualitative distance metric that only detects differences in the presence or absence of lineages of bacteria ( lozupone and knight , 2005 ) .
these findings suggest that differences between c. trachomatis positive women and healthy controls depended entirely on the relative abundance of the phylogenetic lineages rather than the types of lineages present .
in fact , the taxa composition in both groups was comparable , as evidenced by the presence of the same genera ( lactobacillus , prevotella , gardnerella , etc. ) , whereas the relative abundance of each taxa greatly differed between the two groups .
as expected , we found that the cervical microbiota in healthy controls was dominated mainly by lactobacillus species ; specifically , l. crispatus and l. gasseri were found more frequently than l. iners .
significant evidence suggest that the prevalence of specific lactobacillus species is strongly correlated with genital health ( ma et al. , 2012 ; van de wijgert et al. , 2014 ; petrova et al. , 2015 ; lewis et al. , 2017 ) .
in fact , l. crispatus , as well as l. gasseri , is known to produce d - lactic acid , hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) , bacteriocins and other anti - microbial compounds that help protecting against genital pathogens ( mitra et al. , 2016 ). l. iners as well is frequently found in healthy cervico - vaginal microbiota , although its beneficial role is still debated .
indeed , l. iners does not produce d - lactic acid as well as h2o2 , and it has been detected in cervico - vaginal dysbiosis , suggesting that it may have a lower protective ability against pathogens as compared to other lactobacillus species ( mitra et al. , 2016 ; petrova et al. , 2017 ) .
in our study , unlike the healthy controls , c. trachomatis infection seemed to be accompanied by a decrease in the abundance of lactobacilli , and an increase in facultative and / or strict anaerobes , mostly g. vaginalis , a. vaginae , p. amnii , p. timonensis , and leptotrichia amnionii .
a similar alteration in cervico - vaginal microbiota related to c. trachomatis infection was also found by ma et al .
( 2013 ) and van der veer et al .
( 2017 ) .
the shift from a microbiota dominated by lactobacillus species to a microbiota characterized by the increased abundance of anaerobes is a condition known as bv ( srinivasan et al. , 2012 ; dols et al. , 2016 ). of note , in our study , 43 % of c. trachomatis positive women was affected by bv and 67 % of them had complex cervical microbial communities , characterized by a greater species diversity and a very low abundance of lactobacillus species (< 1 %) .
concerning the structure of the microbial communities , it emerged , from the weighted unifrac analysis , a higher inter - individual variability in c. trachomatis - positive women as compared to healthy controls , suggesting that a unique cervical microbial profile associated to c. trachomatis genital infection could not be determined .
in fact , different cervical microbial profiles were observed ; for example , in some cases , the cervical microbiota was constituted exclusively by anaerobes like p. amnii , p. timonensis , g. vaginalis , and l. amnionii , whereas , in other cases , by l. gasseri , l. crispatus , or l. iners plus a mixture of facultative and / or strict anaerobes. l. iners was present in a higher number in c. trachomatis positive women than in healthy controls and this finding is in accordance with previous studies , showing that c. trachomatis positive women were more likely to have a microbiota dominated by l. iners ( ma et al. , 2013 ; van der veer et al. , 2017 ) .
this may be explained by the ability of l. iners to survive in a wide range of ph and other metabolic stress - related conditions , adapting to an altered cervico - vaginal environment ( petrova et al. , 2017 ) .
the main strength of our study is the inclusion , as control group , exclusively of women with a healthy genital condition .
women positive to other genital infections were excluded , since pathogens , such as hpv , hiv , and n. gonorrhoeae , are known to be associated to an altered cervico - vaginal microbiota ( wiesenfeld et al. , 2003 ; petrova et al. , 2013 ; shannon et al. , 2017 ) .
in addition , we excluded women with recent or current use of hormonal contraception and / or probiotic or prebiotic , all factors known to influence the cervico - vaginal microbial composition over - time ( brotman et al. , 2014 ; recine et al. , 2016 ) .
the application of strict inclusion criteria allowed us to greatly diminish the impact of the confounding bias associated to the selection of the study population , leading , unfortunately , to a small sample size .
this is the main weakness of our study , that prevented us to define a unique cervical microbial profile associated to c. trachomatis infection .
notwithstanding , our data may add up valuable information to the ongoing research on the cervical microbiota associated to c. trachomatis genital infection , since these are the first data on the diversity and composition of the chlamydia - related endo - cervical microbiota .
in conclusion , our pilot study shows that c. trachomatis - positive women have a heterogeneous cervical bacterial community with increased species richness and diversity dominated by facultative and / or strict anaerobes .
a larger epidemiological study investigating the richness and diversity of the cervical microbial composition related to specific c. trachomatis serotypes as well as chlamydial load is ongoing .
our findings could have important clinical implications since they may be considered as biomarker for disease progression as well as for the restoring of a healthy cervical microbiota , so to reduce the pathological outcomes of c. trachomatis infection even if additional studies are needed .

the useful experimental data range for solution small - angle scattering is assessed through the number of meaningful shannon channels that can be determined from a given data set , and a robust algorithm is provided to determine this range automatically .
small - angle x - ray and neutron scattering ( saxs and sans ) experiments on solutions provide rapidly decaying scattering curves , often with a poor signal - to - noise ratio , especially at higher angles .
on modern instruments , the noise is partially compensated for by oversampling , thanks to the fact that the angular increment in the data is small compared with that needed to describe adequately the local behaviour and features of the scattering curve .
given a ( noisy ) experimental data set , an important question arises as to which part of the data still contains useful information and should be taken into account for the interpretation and model building .
here , it is demonstrated that , for monodisperse systems , the useful experimental data range is defined by the number of meaningful shannon channels that can be determined from the data set .
an algorithm to determine this number and thus the data range is developed , and it is tested on a number of simulated data sets with various noise levels and with different degrees of oversampling , corresponding to typical saxs / sans experiments .
the method is implemented in a computer program and examples of its application to analyse the experimental data recorded under various conditions are presented .
the program can be employed to discard experimental data containing no useful information in automated pipelines , in modelling procedures , and for data deposition or publication .
the software is freely accessible to academic users .
small - angle scattering waxs saxs solution scattering protein structure shanum 1 .
introduction small - angle scattering ( sas ) of x - rays ( saxs ) and neutrons ( sans ) is a powerful method for the analysis of biological macromolecules in solution ( svergun et al. , 2013 >) .
over the last decade , major advances in instrumentation and computational methods have led to new and exciting applications of saxs to structural biology ( graewert & svergun , 2013 >) .
however , for biological systems the contrast of the particles in aqueous solution is rather small and the useful signal may be weak compared with the background ( jacques et al. , 2012 >) .
this leads to a low signal - to - noise ratio for the data , especially at higher scattering angles .
a question arises as to how to determine the useful angular data range of the experimental scattering pattern that can be taken for subsequent interpretation and model building .
a common practice is to use only that portion of the scattering curve where the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds a certain threshold ( skou et al. , 2014 >) , but the choice of the threshold remains a rather subjective procedure .
also , relying only on the signal - to - noise ratio does not take into account the degree of oversampling of the data .
the problem of assessing the useful data range is also pertinent for other diffraction techniques , e.g. x - ray crystallography .
accepted criteria for data quality and accuracy include the signal - to - noise ratio of the intensities in the highest resolution shell [< i / sigma ( i )>] and the spread function of the equivalent reflections ( r merge ) ( wlodawer et al. , 2008 >) .
in sas data analysis , no agreed criteria exist and , in view of the recent standardization developments of sas publications ( jacques et al. , 2012 > ; trewhella et al. , 2013 >) and efforts towards making experimental data and models publicly available ( valentini et al. , 2015 >) , the absence of an objective method to assess the useful range of a data set is a serious drawback .
here , we present an approach using shannon sampling ( shannon & weaver , 1949 >) to determine the useful range in a given experimental scattering data set from a dilute monodisperse system via the number of shannon channels that can be determined from this data set .
to establish a robust algorithm for the determination of this number , simulated data sets with different signal - to - noise ratios and different oversampling corresponding to typical x - ray and neutron scattering experiments are generated and analysed .
the algorithm is implemented in a computer program and applied to experimental saxs and sans data sets recorded under various conditions and on various instruments .
the proposed method is easy to incorporate into automated analysis pipelines , and it can also be employed to select a fitting range in modelling procedures , especially those relying on higher resolution data , and during data deposition or publication to discard the portions of the ( higher - angle ) sas data containing no useful information .
2. truncated shannon approximation the scattering intensity i ( s ) from a dilute solution of identical particles ( e.g. a monodisperse solution of macromolecules ) is related to the distance distribution function p ( r ) in real space aswhere s = 4pisin ( theta )/ lambda , 2theta is the scattering angle and lambda is the radiation wavelength .
equation ( 1 ) takes into account the fact that the p ( r ) function has finite support and it is equal to zero for all r > d max ( where d max is the maximum size of the particle ) .
if i ( s ) is known , p ( r ) can be calculated by the inverse transformationfrom equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , one can easily see that the functions si ( s ) and p ( r )/ r are fourier mates related by a sine transformation , and that p ( r ) is conveniently represented as a fourier sine serieswhere n is an integer .
substituting equation ( 3 ) into equation ( 1 ) gives the shannon interpolation formula ( shannon & weaver , 1949 >) where s n = npi / d max are the positions of the shannon channels .
equation ( 4 ) contains , generally speaking , an infinite number of shannon channels .
however , for experimental data measured over a limited range of scattering vectors ( s < s max ) , the contribution of the channels beyond this range ( i.e. with indices n > s max d max / pi ) to the fit in this range is relatively small .
the number of shannon channels in the measured range , n s = s max d max / pi , was therefore suggested ( damaschun et al. , 1968 > ; taupin & luzzati , 1982 >) as an estimate of the information content of the scattering data .
methods have been proposed to calculate the p ( r ) function ( moore , 1980 >) and to assess fits to experimental data ( rambo & tainer , 2013 >) based on the shannon representation .
although larger values of n s do generally indicate a greater information content , it is clear that this value alone cannot provide an ultimate estimate , due to the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio is not taken into account .
furthermore , sas data are usually oversampled , i.e. measured with an angular increment deltas much smaller than the distance between the shannon channels pi / d max .
the amount of information in the data must be related to both the level of experimental error and the degree of oversampling .
when the summation index in equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is limited by an integer number m , the corresponding truncated expressions are denoted p m ( r ) and u m ( s ) , respectively .
given an experimental data set , one can construct its truncated approximation u m ( s ) using m shannon channels by minimizing the discrepancywhere the summation index i runs over n experimental points and is the standard deviation for the measured intensity at s i. the best least - squares solution should meet the condition deltachi2 / deltaa m = 0 , leading to the system of normal equationswhere for solution scattering experiments , the experimental data i ( s i ) represent the difference between the scattering from the solute and the pure solvent , and may show negative values due to experimental errors .
these negative values should enter equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) .
however , the computed sas intensity u m ( s i ) must always be non - negative , and equation ( 6 ) can be solved using standard methods under the constraint of non - negativity of a n ( lawson & hanson , 1974 >) .
the truncated shannon approximation provides a way of assessing the information content and useful range of an experimental data set .
indeed , if m is too small , this approximation will not have a sufficient number of terms to fit the experimental data. with increasing m one will improve the fit , but at some stage an overfitting would be observed where the determined a n values will not significantly improve the discrepancy , being poorly defined by the experimental data .
there should therefore be an optimum ( effective ) value of the channels m s reflecting the information content of the data , and the useful range of the given experimental data set will be defined as pim s / d max .
note that m s does not necessarily coincide with n s , and the following sections will present a procedure for a reliable automated determination of the effective number of shannon channels .
3. noise level and oversampling in order to test how the truncated shannon approximation is influenced by noise and oversampling , we have simulated a number of scattering patterns from various geometric bodies ( see table 1 >) .
the data were generated with a fixed momentum transfer value up to s max = 4 nm - 1 and containing varying numbers of shannon channels for different bodies due to their different size .
a dense grid with an angular step deltas = 0.0025 nm - 1 was used to simulate typical synchrotron x - ray data collection , and a sparse grid with deltas = 0.042 nm - 1 ( i.e. having about 17 times fewer points in the same angular range ) emulated sans data .
for each intensity point , random gaussian noise was added , with the relative error of the simulated noise varying from 1 to 400 % for the different data sets .
for each simulated data set , shannon fits were calculated with increasing m according to equations ( 4 ) - ( 6 ) , and the quality of the approximation was assessed by the r factor between the ideal theoretical curve without noise i ref ( s ) and the corresponding shannon fit u m ( s )/ s , according to the formulathe simulated data sets and the best shannon fits ( corresponding to the minimum r factors ) are shown in fig. 1 > and in the supporting information ( figs. s1 - s4 ) .
the optimum number of shannon channels mb providing the best agreement with the ideal curve depends on both the noise level and the angular step ( see table 1 >) .
one should also note that the quality of the fits from the truncated shannon approximation depends on the anisometry of the object .
for very anisometric particles , high noise levels ( 100 % noise in fig. 1 > a ; 20 and 100 % noise in fig. 1 > b ) lead to significant oscillations in the shannon approximations .
still , all the fits in fig. 1 > , even those with oscillations , provide the best agreement with the ideal curve compared with the shannon fits with other m , and are therefore best fits in terms of the truncated shannon approximation .
as is evident from table 1 >( a ) , for oversampled and accurate ( 1 - 5 % noise ) data the best shannon fits sometimes require more channels mb than n s , indicating that the amount of information in the data warrants extrapolation beyond the available range .
this possibility reflects the well known property of oversampled measurements of analytical functions [ and the scattering intensity , being a fourier transform of a p ( r ) function having a finite support , is an analytical function according to the wiener - paley - schwartz theorem ( schwartz , 1952 >)] .
the effect is utilized e.g. for ' super - resolution ' in optical image reconstruction ( frieden , 1971 >) but can clearly be observed only for very accurate data .
obviously , mb decreases with an increasing level of added noise , but interestingly and somewhat unexpectedly , for oversampled data , even at a very high ( 100 % and above ) noise level , mb may still be essentially equal to n s ( taking into account the +/ - 1 uncertainty of determination of mb ) .
in other words , oversampled data , even if looking very noisy ( e.g. fig. 1 > c , bottom curve ) , still contain useful information about the ideal scattering curve over the entire measured range .
in contrast , for data simulated on a sparse angular grid , mb starts to decrease at a noise level of 20 - 50 % ( table 1 > b ) , indicating an insufficient quantity of information to define n s channels for sparse noisy data .
4. determination of the effective number of shannon channels in a real experiment , the ideal scattering curve and thus mb are of course not available , and m s should be determined based on experimental data only .
the extensive simulations described in the previous section allowed us to define quantitative criteria for the selection of m s. in principle , the choice could be performed by monitoring the discrepancy chi2 of the shannon fit as a function of m , given that the poorly defined channels would not significantly improve the fit .
such a procedure is employed to determine the number of independent components in singular - value decomposition ( golub & reinsch , 1970 >) , although formalization of the ' non - significant ' condition is not trivial and the results are not always accurate .
fortunately , a reliable estimate of m s is obtained by combining reciprocal - and real - space criteria .
indeed , each shannon approximation u m ( s ) expressed by a set of coefficients a n corresponds to a distance distribution in real space p m ( r ) according to equation ( 3 ) .
increasing m adds extra terms to p m ( r ) , oscillating with a higher and higher frequency pim / d max .
one would expect that the unreliably determined shannon channels a n will provide nothing but increasing oscillations in the p m ( r ) function , and this can be captured by a measure of the integral derivative omega ( p ) the quality of the shannon representation can be characterized by a combined measurewhere the coefficient alpha ensures proper scaling of the two metrics ( see below ) .
the procedure to determine the optimum number of shannon channels m s is therefore formulated as follows : ( i ) given an experimental data set , estimate the maximum particle size d max ( this is done e.g. by the programs autorg and autognom ( petoukhov et al. , 2007 >) .
( ii ) calculate the nominal number of shannon channels as n s = s max d max / pi , and set up the search range .
in practical applications , we use m min = max ( 3 , 0.2n s ) , m max = 1.25n s .
( iii ) for m min < m < m max , calculate the coefficients of the shannon approximation a n ( n = 1 , ...
m ) by solving equation ( 6 ) using a non - negative linear least - squares procedure ( lawson & hanson , 1974 >) .
( iv ) for each shannon fit , calculate the discrepancy chi2 ( m ) and the integral derivative omega ( p m ) .
( v ) evaluate the scaling coefficient alpha as the ratio between chi2 ( m max ) and omega [ p ( m min )] .
( vi ) determine the optimum value m s corresponding to the minimum of the target function f ( m ) as defined in equation ( 10 ) .
typical examples of fits with different numbers of shannon channels and the corresponding p ( r ) functions are shown in figs. 2 >( a ) and 2 >( b ) for the case of an oblate ellipsoid .
as expected , the chi2 values decrease with increasing shannon channel number ( fig. 3 > , blue curve ) , reaching a plateau when approaching mb ( which , for this example , coincides with n s ) .
the integral derivative omega ( p m ) increases slightly with increasing m and displays a sharp upturn when m exceeds mb ( fig. 3 > , green curve ) .
this behaviour further confirms the fact that , beyond the range of their reliable definition , the shannon channels do not significantly improve the fit by the interpolated curve but , at the same time , they lead to strong oscillations in the p ( r ) function ( clearly seen in fig. 2 > b ) .
the target function f ( m ) is dominated by the discrepancy term chi2 ( m ) ( misfit to the data ) at smaller m , and by the rapidly increasing integral derivative omega ( p m ) , due to an oscillating p m ( r ) function at larger m ( fig. 3 > , red curve ) .
this leads to a characteristic u - shaped profile of f ( m ) and allows for a straightforward localization of m s corresponding to the minimum of the target function .
a computer program , shanum , was written to perform the selection of m s following the above algorithm .
to verify its performance , shanum was applied to the simulated scattering curves described in the previous section , and it determined m s values coinciding with mb within one shannon channel for all cases ( table 1 >) .
these extensive test calculations indicated that the proposed algorithm allows one to determine reliably the effective number of shannon channels in a data set m s and therefore the useful range of the experimental data ( since s = pim s / d max ) .
5. examples of practical application after validation using simulated data , the method was applied to a number of experimental x - ray and neutron data sets collected over different angular ranges from macromolecular solutions containing particles of various sizes at different concentrations .
some of these examples are presented below to illustrate the capacity of the method to detect the useful data range .
the x - ray synchrotron scattering data were recorded in collaborative user projects on the x33 beamline of the embl ( blanchet et al. , 2012 >) at the storage ring doris - iii ( desy , hamburg ). fig. 4 >( a ) presents the x - ray scattering data from an importin alpha / beta complex with a molecular mass ( m r ) of 160 kda and d max = 19 nm ( falces et al. , 2010 >) .
due to the low protein concentration ( 0.5 mg ml - 1 ) , the scattering data are extremely noisy at higher angles .
despite the fact that the measured range of scattering vectors ( up to s max = 6 nm - 1 ) nominally contains n s = 36 shannon channels , the algorithm returns m s = 9 , indicating that the high - angle data beyond s = 1.5 nm - 1 contain no useful information .
the scattering pattern from the dna methyltransferase ssoii ( m r = 45 kda , d max = 11 nm ) displayed in fig. 4 >( b ) ( konarev et al. , 2014 >) appears rather noisy starting from s = 2 nm - 1 , but the algorithm indicates that the data contain useful information up to 4 nm - 1 .
the data from lsaq - idea lumazine synthase ( zhang et al. , 2006 >) , which forms icosahedral assemblies in solution ( with m r = 2 mda and d max = 33 nm ) , display a good signal - to - noise ratio over the entire range displayed in fig. 4 >( c ) and the algorithm does find the full data range , with 20 shannon channels to contain useful information .
interestingly , the shanum estimates correlate well with the data ranges actually used for data analysis in the above - mentioned publications .
it was also interesting to check whether the method is applicable to wide - angle x - ray scattering ( waxs ) data .
waxs curves provide higher - resolution information and generally contain larger numbers of shannon channels compared with saxs data .
we applied shanum to waxs data from a concentrated ( 28 mg ml - 1 ) solution of myoglobin [ downloaded from the small - angle scattering data bank ( sasbdb ) , www.sasbdb.org , entry sasdak2 ] and from a dilute ( 2 mg ml - 1 ) solution of cytochrome c ( recorded at x33 ; unpublished data ) .
whereas for the former case the entire measured waxs range was selected as useful , only about half of this range was deemed informative for the latter case ( fig. 5 >) .
finally , we shall illustrate the use of the algorithm on several published neutron scattering data sets. fig. 6 >( a ) displays sans data from thioredoxin reductase , a dimeric protein with m r = 68 kda and d max = 11 nm , recorded on the d22 instrument at the institute laue langevin , grenoble , france ( svergun et al. , 1998 >) .
the two data sets , collected in h2o and in d2o over the same angular range ( up to s max = 5.2 nm - 1 ) , nominally both cover n s = 17 shannon channels .
however , the h2o data are noisier , due to the lower contrast and the incoherent background , such that the algorithm returns 14 effective channels for the h2o data and 16 channels for the d2o data .
the next example demonstrates that the approach is not limited to biological macromolecules in aqueous solutions .
the sans data in fig. 6 >( b ) were collected on the kws - 2 beamline ( julich centre for neutron science , frm - ii reactor , tu munchen , germany ) from hybrid gold nanoparticles protected by dodecanethiol ( c12 ) or hexanethiol ( c6 ) dissolved in deuterated chloroform ( moglianetti et al. , 2014 >) .
the top and bottom curves were recorded on the hybrid particles with specifically deuterated dodecanethiol or hexane - thiol , respectively .
the composite nanoparticle solutions are close to monodisperse , with a diameter of 8 nm , as shown by the shapes of the scattering curves and also by complementary methods .
shanum provides feasible results , suggesting that most of the dodecanethiol curve is informative , whereas the last third of the noisier hexanethiol curve bears no useful information .
given that chemically synthesized nanoparticles inevitably have a certain degree of polydispersity , the presented example indicates the applicability of shanum not only for a non - biological system but also for a slightly polydisperse one .
6. discussion and conclusions until now , no established procedure was available to assess the useful range of experimental saxs and sans data .
the main problems of assessment based on the signal - to - noise ratio are a lack of objectivity in the selection of the threshold and the fact that the degree of oversampling is not taken into account .
the proposed method overcomes both problems and offers an objective procedure to determine the useful range .
the procedure , implemented in the program module shanum included in the atsas package ( http :// www.embl - hamburg.de / biosaxs / software.html ) , is freely available to academic users , together with other atsas programs as from the 2.6 release .
given an experimental data set , the program requires only the maximum size of the particle , d max , to determine the useful range. by default , the programs autorg and autognom ( petoukhov et al. , 2007 >) are employed to estimate d max , but if this value is known a priori ( e.g. when analysing data from a protein with a known structure ) it can be specified by the user .
importantly , the shannon formalism [ equations ( 4 ) - ( 6 )] is valid not only for the maximum size d max but also for any value d > d max .
this makes the entire procedure even more robust , allowing one safely to use a somewhat overestimated maximum size and also to handle slightly polydisperse systems ( see the nanoparticle example presented above ) .
in the test and practical calculations presented in this work , the use of 5 - 10 % overestimated values yielded practically the same useful data ranges .
in x - ray crystallography , the useful data range assessed by i / sigma and r merge determines the set of reflections to enter the refinement and therefore directly defines the resolution of the model .
in sas , cutting out higher - angle data would not influence the accuracy of some parameters , e.g. the radius of gyration determined from low - angle data by the guinier approximation ( guinier , 1939 >) .
obviously , the removal of meaningless data is expected to improve the results of indirect transformation analysis and of the fitting procedures making use of waxs data ( e.g. shape determination using gasbor ; svergun et al. , 2001 >) , and also of the calculation of overall particle parameters such as the porod volume v p. this last represents the excluded particle volume and is computed as ( porod , 1982 >) in practical applications , the porod invariant q is calculated over a finite range [ 0 , s m ] and appropriate corrections are applied to compensate for the missing data from s m to infinity ( e.g. in the porod module of primus ; konarev et al. , 2003 >) .
the lower panel of fig. 4 >( a ) presents the porod volume of the importin alpha / beta complex as a function of the upper integration limit s m. given an empirical relation v p ( in nm3 ) ~ 1.7 - 1.8m r ( in kda ) ( petoukhov et al. , 2012 >) , the expected porod volume of the complex is about 280 nm3 .
the volume computed directly by the porod module provides stable values , with moderate variations in the useful data range detected by shanum ( i.e. up to s m ~ 1.3 nm - 1 ) , and starts to oscillate wildly as soon as higher - angle data are taken into account .
similarly , for dna methyltransferase ssoii , v p reveals meaningful values of around 75 nm3 when s m stays within the useful data range and unreasonable oscillations beyond this range ( lower panel of fig. 4 > b ) .
note that , in practice , the above empirical relation is used in the opposite direction and v p is considered to be one of the ways of assessing m r without absolute calibration .
these examples illustrate the importance of the removal of meaningless data for preventing potential problems in the determination of basic particle parameters .
we should underline that the proposed algorithm is not intended to serve as a low - pass filter to provide noise reduction by fitting of the experimental data .
as evident from fig. 1 > , at high noise levels the shannon fits may display noticeable artificial oscillations , especially for anisometric particles .
further , the truncated shannon representations inevitably display a termination effect due to the missing higher orders [ in particular , u m ( s ) exhibits unphysical negative values oscillating around zero for arguments exceeding pim / d max ] .
the method is developed as a means of assessing the information content , and not as a smoothing tool for noisy data .
in cases where the experimental errors in the data set are not available and the value of chi2 cannot be reliably calculated , one can use a recently developed correlation map test instead ( franke et al. , 2015 >) .
in this approach , the agreement between the experimental data and the shannon approximation is measured by the longest contiguous stretch of the same sign of the residuals , whereby the length of this stretch can be translated into a statistical probability value .
we have implemented the correlation map criterion in shanum as an alternative to chi2 in equation ( 5 ) and found similar results to the use of discrepancy , allowing one to evaluate reliably the range of useful data also when the experimental errors are not available .
the present version of shanum uses the correlation map if the associated errors are not provided in the input experimental data set .
importantly , the method proposed here does not require user input and is thus applicable in automated pipelines for data analysis .
further , shanum is being implemented in a suite of validation tools for the deposited experimental saxs / sans data in sasbdb .
the principle of assessment of the useful data range proposed here might be useful for other types of scattering or spectroscopic experiments yielding discrete oversampled data .

figure 1 simulated scattering curves from an oblate ellipsoid [ half - axes 1 , 15 and 15 nm , parts ( a ) and ( b )] and for a cube with an edge of 5 nm [ parts ( c ) and ( d )]. from top to bottom , the curves correspond to added gaussian noise of 1 , 5 , 20 and 100 % ( dots with error bars ) , respectively .
the best truncated shannon approximations are displayed as solid lines .
subsequent curves are shifted by one logarithmic order for better visualization .
here and in the subsequent figures , the intensities are displayed on a logarithmic scale .
for the noisy simulated and experimental data where the values may become negative because of noise , logarithms of the modulus of the intensity are displayed as red dots .
parts ( a ) and ( c ) correspond to x - ray type data , and parts ( b ) and ( d ) to neutron type data .

background gastric and colorectal cancers have a major impact on public health , and are the most common malignant tumors in china .
the aim of this research was to study whether polymorphisms of chchd3p1 - hsp90ab7p , grid1 , hspa12a , prlhr , sbf2 , pold3 and c11orf93 - c11orf92 genes are associated with the risk of gastric and colorectal cancers in the chinese han population .
methods we genotyped seven single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from seven genes .
we selected 588 patients with gastric cancer and 449 with colorectal cancer , along with 703 healthy controls .
all these snps were evaluated using the chi2 test and genetic model analysis .
results the genotype " a / t " of rs12413624 in prlhr gene was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer in allele model analysis [ odds ratio ( or ) = 0.81 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) = 0.68 - 0.97 ; p = 0.018 ] and log - additive model analysis ( or = 0.81 ; 95 % ci = 0.66 - 0.98 ; p = 0.032 ) .
the genotype " a / g " of rs1665650 in hspa12a gene was associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer in overdominant model analysis ( or = 0.77 ; 95 % ci = 0.60 - 0.99 ; p = 0.038 ) .
conclusions our results provide evidence that variants of prlhr gene are a protective factor in colorectal cancer and variants of hspa12a gene are a protective factor in gastric cancer in the chinese han population .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background gastric and colorectal cancers are two of the most widespread cancers worldwide [ 1 ] .
both gastrointestinal malignancies are leading causes of cancer - related death in east asia , eastern europe , parts of central and south america. with improvements in the standard of living and changes in lifestyle , food and the environment , the incidences of gastric and colorectal cancers are constantly increasing in china , where they are now the third most frequent malignancies [ 2 , 3 ] .
in the present study , the low - risk susceptibility markers were previously reported in genome - wide association studies as being related to the risk of digestive system cancer : rs10795668 ( 10p14 ) , rs10788473 ( 10q23.1 ) , rs1665650 ( 10q25.3 ) , rs12413624 ( 10q26.11 ) , rs10500715 ( 11p15.4 ) , rs3824999 ( 11q13.4 ) and rs3802842 ( 11q23.1 ) [ 4 - 7 ] .
the prolactin releasing hormone receptor ( prlhr ) , also known as g - protein - coupled receptor 10 , is the receptor for prolactin releasing peptide ( prrp ) .
numerous studies suggest digestive disease was associated with regulation of feeding and a pivotal role of prrp in the homeostatic regulation of feeding and energy balance [ 8 ] .
evidence from our group has shown that central administration of prrp decreases feeding and body weight gain in rats and mice , without causing adverse effects [ 9 ] .
hspa12a is a member of the heat shock protein ( hsp ) family and a common molecule within cells that act as a chaperone in conditions of stress , including carcinogenesis [ 10 ] .
overexpression of hspa12a might be associated with poor survival in hepatocellular carcinoma .
there is a good correlation between the expression of hsps and the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy [ 11 ] .
grid1 gene encodes glutamate receptor delta1 , a subunit of glutamate receptor channels that mediate most of the fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and play key roles in synaptic plasticity [ 12 ] .
sbf2 gene appears to influence the sorting and degradation of cell surface receptors , such as epidermal growth factor receptor , with resultant alterations in downstream signaling [ 4 ] .
the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between chchd3p1 - hsp90ab7p , grid1 , hspa12a , prlhr , sbf2 , pold3 , and c11orf93 - c11orf92 genes and susceptibility to gastric and colorectal cancers in the chinese han population .
methods ethics statement the protocol in this study conformed to the principles of the declaration of helsinki and was ratified by the ethical committee of the second affiliated hospital , xi'an jiaotong university school of medicine , china .
study population we recruited 588 patients with gastric cancer and 449 with colorectal cancer between december 2010 and november 2014 from the department of general surgery , the second affiliated hospital , xi'an jiaotong university school of medicine .
all of the study participants were from the chinese han population living in the area of xi'an. confirmed cases were patients who were newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed .
according to the recruitment and exclusion standards , we surveyed the patients using a self - designed questionnaire including demographic factors such as age , gender , and education , and potential risk factors including smoking , dietary conditions , alcohol consumption , and family history of cancer [ 13 ] .
the controls were 703 healthy individuals who were selected from june 2011 to october 2014 from the medical examination center , department of general surgery , the second affiliated hospital , xi'an jiaotong university school of medicine .
the controls were all chinese han living in xi'an city and surrounding area .
we excluded patients with chronic diseases of the kidneys , heart , liver and brain .
all participants gave signed informed consent prior to participation in the study .
genotyping we genotyped seven single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) with minor allele frequency ( maf ) > 5 % in seven genes in the hapmap asian population .
genomic dna was stored at - 20 degreesc and was extracted from whole blood by the phenol - chloroform extraction method .
using an extraction kit ( goldmag , china ) , we isolated dna from the samples .
dna concentration was measured by spectrometry ( du530 uv / vis spectrophotometer ; beckman instruments , fullerton , ca , usa ) .
we designed the multiplexed snp mass extend assay using sequenom massarray assay design version 4.0 software [ 14 ] .
statistical analysis the genotype frequencies of each snp in the control subjects were checked using the hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) .
power analysis was carried out using the online calculator at http :// sampsize.sourceforge.net / iface / s3.html .
data analysis was performed using spss version 16.0 statistical package ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) and microsoft excel .
p < 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance .
differences in the distribution were analyzed using logistic regression .
the genotype frequencies of cases and controls were calculated using a chi2 test [ 15 , 16 ] .
odds ratios ( ors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were tested using unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and gender [ 17 ] .
the allele , overdominant and log - additive models were applied using plink software ( http :// pngu.mgh.harvard.edu / purcell / plink /) to assess the association of snps with the risk of gastric and colorectal cancers .
results the 588 gastric cancer cases comprised 392 men and 196 women with a mean age of 58.12 +/ - 11.66 years .
the 449 colorectal cancer cases comprised 260 men and 189 women with a mean age of 59.09 +/ - 11.78 years .
the 703 healthy controls comprised 396 men and 307 women with a mean age of 48.57 +/ - 9.43 years .
we found no differences between gender and age distribution .
the characteristics of the patients and controls are shown in table 1 .
the primers of the seven selected snps are shown in table 2 , which were designed by sequenom massarray assay design 4.0 software [ 14 ] .
seven snps in seven genes were analyzed in this study .
snp id , gene , hwe test results , minor / major alleles , and maf of cases and controls of all the snps are shown in table 3 .
the minor allele of each snp , a risk factor , was compared with the wild - type allele .

environmental components are risk factors for the development of gastric and colorectal cancers , such as helicobacter pylori infection , salted food intake , changed lifestyle and smoking , and their mortality rates are continually increasing in china [ 19 , 20 ] .
in this study , we showed that the prlhr gene , which is mapped to chromosome 10q26.11 , contained an snp ( genotype " a / t " of rs12413624 ) associated with a increased risk of colorectal cancer .
prlhr is the receptor for prrp ( also known as g - protein - coupled receptor 10 ) and has pivotal functions in press hormone release and feeding behavior [ 21 ] .
prrp , a hormone , may be secreted from peripheral tissues ( pancreas , placenta , adrenal ) upon the anterior pituitary , or may be secreted from hypophysiotropic neurons by an indirect pivotal mechanism [ 22 ] .
it was also reported that prlhr , as well as involvement in the physiological responses to central dministration of prrp , may play roles in other processes , such as feeding behavior , pathogenesis of uterine fibroids , energy expenditure , obesity and the pivotal control of blood pressure [ 8 , 23 , 24 ] .
according to previous reports , rs12413624 is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma risk in individuals of european descent but not in japanese and chinese populations [ 25 ] .
we discovered the relationship between rs12413624 in the prlhr gene and colorectal cancer in the allele and the log - additive models .
however , we did not find any correlation between the prlhr gene and gastric cancer .
it is necessary to study the biological functions of the prlhr gene in further research .
we genotyped " a / g " of rs1665650 in hspa12a gene , which is mapped to chromosome 10q25.3 , and associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer .
hspa12a , heat shock 70 - kda protein 12a , is a novel and atypical member of the hsp70 family in animals .
its effects are diverse and include involvement in the development of atherosclerotic lesions in mice [ 26 ] .
cancer cells experience high levels of proteotoxic stress and rely upon stress response pathways for survival and proliferation , thereby becoming dependent on proteins such as stress - inducible hsps .
it is reported that overexpression of hspa12a in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues is significantly related to poor survival [ 11 ] .
during carcinogenesis , expression of hsps is altered in many tumor types .
increased levels of hspa are related to malignancy , metastasis , poor prognosis , and resistance to therapeutic strategies , including chemotherapy or radiation in glioblastoma , and breast , bladder , endometrial and cervical carcinomas [ 27 - 29 ] .
it is also reported that the associations between rs1665650 , rs3824999 and colorectal cancer are not strongly modified by gender , alcohol , smoking , aspirin , and various dietary factors [ 30 ] .
our results showed that rs1665650 in hspa12a gene is correlated with gastric cancer risk , and we did not find a significant association with the risk of colorectal cancer .
further research should use a larger number of samples and focus on understanding the mechanisms by which hspa12a gene influences pathogenesis and progression .
the rs10795668 in chchd3p1 - hsp90ab7p gene is associated with the risk of colorectal cancer in poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia [ 31 ] .
somatic exonuclease domain mutations in pole gene have been identified in colorectal and endometrial cancer patients , and show an association with hypermutability and microsatellite stability [ 32 ] .
in both population that included cases of european descent and in a combined analysis with cases from china , snps in the sbf2 gene were associated with survival time among patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma [ 7 ] .
however , we did not find that snps and genes were associated with gastric or colorectal cancers in our study .
there were several limitations to our study .
first , all the samples were from the chinese han population living in xi'an city or its surrounding area and from the same hospital .
there were a substantial number of confounding factors that may have caused type i errors ( false - positive results ) in our association study .
second , we also performed bonferroni correction of the 21 tests and found no significant results .
however , the main weakness of bonferroni correction is that the interpretation of a finding depends on the number of other tests performed .
true important differences may be deemed nonsignificant since the likelihood of type ii errors also increased [ 33 ] .
finally , our samples included 1037 cases ( 588 gastric cancer and 449 colorectal cancer ) and 703 healthy controls and we performed a power analysis that showed that the power of seven snps was < 0.75 .
the sample size was not large enough for association studies and a larger sample size is required to confirm our findings .
conclusions this study shows that prlhr gene is a protective factor in colorectal cancer and hspa12a gene is a protective factor in gastric cancer .
we demonstrated a relationship between polymorphisms of prlhr and hspa12a gene and the risk of gastric and colorectal cancers in the chinese han population .

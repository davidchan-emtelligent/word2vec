anterior sacral meningocele is characterized by herniation of the meningeal sac due to a developmental bone defect in the front of a sacrum bone .
it was first described in 1837 .
the sacral meningocele may be congenital or acquired .
it is usually discovered during a rectal or pelvic examination as a cystic lesion or discovered incidentally .
most of the symptoms are due to compression on the adjacent organs .
in this paper , we present a case of an asymptomatic female patient who had a pelvic cyst detected during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination .
we show radiological findings of the detailed postpartum evaluation of the cyst , which led to detection of sacral agenesis , huge anterior sacral meningocele , and significant arcuate uterus .
1. introduction the anterior sacral meningocele is defined as herniation of the meningeal sac due to developmental bone defect in the front of a sacrum bone [ 1 ] .
it is reported that anterior sacral meningocele had been first described in 1837 [ 2 , 3 ] .
it may be congenital or acquired .
while anterior sacral meningocele usually occurs as a congenital defect , most acquired sacral meningoceles occur due to dural ectasia associated with neurofibromatosis , marfan 's syndrome , and ehlers - danlos syndrome [ 4 ] .
most of the symptoms are due to compression on the adjacent organs , and the most common symptom is constipation [ 5 ] .
in this article we present the radiological findings of sacral agenesis , large anterior sacral meningocele , and bicornuate uterus in the case of an asymptomatic female patient with a history of gestation .
2. case report about 6 months before at 22 weeks of gestation , a cystic lesion was identified during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination of the pelvic area in a 23 - year - old female patient without any previous discomfort .
due to the compression of the cyst on the cervix , the delivery was achieved by caesarean section .
postpartum ultrasonographic examination showed that there was a 7.5 x 8.5 cm sized thin - walled cystic lesion in the midline of the pelvic region compressing the rectum , uterus and bladder ( figure 1 ) .
the origin of the lesion could not be determined during the ultrasonographic examination .
the t2 - weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) showed a thin - walled hyperintensity in the uterus , and the rectum posterior while t1 - weighted images revealed a hypointense cystic lesion .
the cyst was not associated with the ovaries .
the fourth and fifth sacral bones were not seen .
in the posterior , the cyst was communicating with the spinal subarachnoid space ( figure 2 ) .
based on these findings , the patient was diagnosed with sacral agenesis and anterior sacral meningocele .
in addition , mri showed that the conus medullaris ended at the 4th lumbar spine level and a distinct arcuate uterus was observed .
the patient 's neurological examination was normal .
complete blood count and serum biochemical tests were within normal limits .
because she planned another pregnancy , gynecological surgeons and neurosurgeons suggested to the patient a surgical management .
but she denied .
3. discussion the anterior sacral meningocele is an anterior sacral defect or a herniation of the meningeal sac from the sacral foramen to the anterior .
the congenital form of the sacral anomaly can vary from minor sacral defects to complete sacral agenesis .
the anterior sacral meningocele may be isolated or may be associated with other congenital abnormalities .
urogenital tract and uterine anomalies , anorectal malformations , lipomas , sacrococcygeal teratoma , epidermoid tumor , and dermoid cysts may accompany the anterior sacral meningocele [ 4 , 6 ] .
the anorectal anomaly , ventral sacral defect , and presacral mass are known together as " currarino 's triad. " the presacral mass meningocele , teratoma , or enteric cyst might be in " currarino 's triad " [ 7 ] .
the anterior sacral meningoceles account for approximately 5 % of retrorectal masses .
they are generally diagnosed in the second or third decades and are more prevalent in women .
they may be asymptomatic or present as nonspecific symptoms such as long - term constipation , urinary dysfunction , dysmenorrhea , lower back pain , or perineal hypoalgesia [ 1 , 4 , 5 ] .
these symptoms may be due to direct compression of the herniated meningeal sac , spinal cord tethering , or sacral nerve root compression .
in addition , congenital defects that may occur in autonomic innervation of the bladder and anal sphincter may be associated with constipation and urinary dysfunction .
symptoms such as dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia may cause direct compression as well as lead to venous congestion as a result of the compression on the pelvic veins [ 4 , 5 ] .
in addition , headache can be seen in 10 to 15 percent of patients .
the changes in the intra - abdominal pressure are thought to occur as a result of effects of intracranial pressure via the meningocele pouch [ 3 , 4 ] .
our the patient was asymptomatic and pelvic cyst that was detected during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination was then diagnosed postpartum by mri evaluation .
ultrasonography , computed tomography , mri , and myelography tests can be used for radiological evaluation .
ultrasonography can be used for the first imaging evaluation of pelvic lesion , and , if necessary , can also be successfully used in followups .
however , as was the case with our patient , the origin of the pelvic cystic lesion cannot always be detected with ultrasound .
computed tomography is an important tool in providing detailed information about bone lesions or abnormalities [ 1 ] .
mri provides high soft tissue contrast ; is capable of multiplanar imaging ; and is a fast , non - invasive , and reliable imaging technique .
it can detect communication between the anterior sacral meningocele and the spinal subarachnoid space as well as provide detailed information about accompanying pathologies such as spinal cord tethering or a tumor [ 4 ] .
however , in some cases where the communication with the subarachnoid space is narrow , the mri may fail to demonstrate that communication .
in such cases , there might be a need for a myelography examination after a intrathecal contrast injection , which can be applied under fluoroscopy or as a computed tomography myelography [ 2 ] .
in addition , cystic lesions that are located in the presacral region should be considered during the diagnosis .
these may include gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract tumors , dermoid and epidermoid cysts , aneurysmal bone cyst , hamartoma , intrasacral meningocele , hydatid cyst , lipoma , lymphangioma , perineurial cyst , rectal duplication , reproductive tract tumors , teratomas , and teratocarcinoma [ 4 , 8 ] .
moreover , the most important finding in the differential diagnosis is to demonstrate the communication between the cystic lesion and subarachnoid space [ 6 ] .
the anterior sacral meningocele does not regress [ 2 ] .
although it may be asymptomatic , some authors have reported infectious complications such as meningitis .
therefore , surgical treatment is recommended [ 5 , 9 ] .
some physicians have recommended surgical treatment if there is an increase in lesion size or if the sacral meningocele is symptomatic [ 2 ] .
4. conclusion since the anterior sacral meningocele is a rare entity , it may be confused with more common cystic lesions of gynecologic origin during routine ultrasound examinations of female patients .
when cystic lesions of a presacral location whose relationship with gynecological organs is not clear are detected during an ultrasonographic examination , an mri examination would be an appropriate approach for evaluation an anterior sacral meningocele .

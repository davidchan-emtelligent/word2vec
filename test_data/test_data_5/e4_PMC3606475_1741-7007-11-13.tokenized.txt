background in the mouse ovary , oocytes initially develop in clusters termed germ - cell nests .
shortly after birth , these germ - cell nests break apart , and the oocytes individually become surrounded by somatic granulosa cells to form primordial follicles .
notch signaling plays essential roles during oogenesis in drosophila , and recent studies have suggested that notch signaling also plays an essential role during oogenesis and ovary development in mammals .
however , no in vivo loss - of - function studies have been performed to establish whether notch family receptors have an essential physiological role during normal ovarian development in mutant mice .
results female mice with conditional deletion of the notch2 gene in somatic granulosa cells of the ovary exhibited reduced fertility , accompanied by the formation of multi - oocyte follicles , which became hemorrhagic by 7 weeks of age .
formation of multi - oocyte follicles resulted from defects in breakdown of the primordial germ - cell nests .
the ovaries of the notch2 conditional mutant mice had increased numbers of oocytes , but decreased numbers of primordial follicles .
oocyte numbers in the notch2 conditional mutants were increased not by excess or extended cellular proliferation , but as a result of decreased oocyte apoptosis .
conclusions our work demonstrates that notch2 - mediated signaling in the somatic - cell lineage of the mouse ovary regulates oocyte apoptosis non - cell autonomously , and is essential for regulating breakdown of germ - cell nests and formation of primordial follicles .
this model provides a new resource for studying the developmental and physiological roles of notch signaling during mammalian reproductive biology .
oogenesis notch signaling apoptosis .
background primordial germ cells in mice arise in the proximal extraembryonic mesoderm of the mouse embryo , and migrate to the embryonic gonad primordia [ 1,2 ] .
in female mice , primordial germ cells that enter the embryonic ovaries divide mitotically until approximately embryonic day ( e ) 13.5 .
these mitotic oocyte progenitors are termed oogonia .
oogonia enter meiosis after e13.5 , and are then termed oocytes .
oocytes arrest in the diplotene stage of the first meiotic division .
initially , oocytes develop in clusters termed germ - cell nests ( also called germ - cell clusters , cysts , or syncytia ) .
these nests arise through the processes of incomplete cytokinesis and cellular aggregation [ 2 - 6 ] .
during the first few days after birth , the germ - cell nests break apart , and the oocytes individually become surrounded by somatic cells to form primordial follicles .
temporally , the process of germ - cell nest breakdown and primordial - follicle formation is accompanied by the apoptotic cell death of approximately two - thirds of the oocytes .
the surviving oocytes become surrounded by a single layer of somatic pre - granulosa cells , forming the primordial follicles [ 2 - 5 ] .
primary follicles are formed from the primordial follicles as the oocytes start to grow and the surrounding somatic pre - granulosa cells become cuboidal and proliferative .
the prevailing view in the field has been that the oocytes which are present in the primordial follicles of the ovaries represent the entire reservoir of gametes available to a female mouse throughout its reproductive life .
however , a vigorous debate has developed over the existence of female germ - line stem cells in ovaries of mice and humans [ 7,8 ] .
breakdown of germ - cell nests and formation of primordial follicles are key early events in mammalian folliculogenesis .
breakdown of germ - cell nests occurs during the same time window as the apoptotic death of approximately two - thirds of the oocytes within those nests ; however , the mechanistic connection between these two events is not clear .
it has long been known that exposure of neonatal mice to various estrogenic compounds results in formation of multi - oocyte follicles , and it is believed that defects in the process of germ - cell nest breakdown leads to the formation of these multi - oocyte follicles [ 4,5 ] .
the notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved , intercellular signaling mechanism [ 9,10 ] .
notch signaling frequently plays a crucial role in precursor cells , making binary cell - fate decisions .
however , notch signaling also regulates additional developmental decisions , such as boundary formation between cell populations , cell proliferation , and cell death .
notch family receptors are large single - pass type i transmembrane proteins .
in mammals , four notch family receptors have been described , encoded by the notch1 , 2 , 3 and 4 genes .
a notch family receptor exists at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved , non - covalently associated heterodimer , consisting of a large ectodomain and a membrane - tethered intracellular domain .
during canonical notch signaling , notch receptors interact with ligands that are also single - pass type i transmembrane proteins .
this restricts the notch pathway to regulating juxtacrine intercellular interactions .
in mammals , the canonical notch ligands are encoded by the jagged ( jag1 , jag2 ) and delta - like ( dll1 , dll3 , dll4 ) gene families .
the signal induced by ligand binding is transmitted intracellularly by a process involving proteolytic cleavage of the receptor and nuclear translocation of the intracellular domain of the notch family protein .
the receptor / ligand interaction induces two additional proteolytic cleavages in the membrane - tethered fragment of the notch heterodimer .
the final cleavage , catalyzed by the gamma - secretase complex , frees the intracellular domain of the notch receptor from the cell membrane .
the cleaved fragment translocates to the nucleus owing to the presence of nuclear localization signals located in the notch intracellular domain .
once in the nucleus , the notch intracellular domain forms a complex with a sequence - specific dna binding protein , the rbpj protein , ( also known in mammals as csl or cbf1 ) , and activates transcription of notch target genes .
notch signaling plays an essential role during oogenesis in drosophila , and is required at several different stages of oocyte development [ 11 - 13 ] .
recent work has suggested that notch signaling probably also plays an essential role during oogenesis and ovary development in mammals .
the notch2 receptor is expressed at high levels in pre - granulosa [ 14,15 ] and granulosa [ 16 ] cells of the neonatal and adult mouse ovary , and ex vivo culture of neonatal mouse ovaries in gamma - secretase inhibitors ( which abrogate notch signaling ) resulted in defects in granulosa - cell proliferation and primordial - follicle formation [ 14,15 ] .
however , no in vivo loss - of - function studies have been performed to establish whether notch family receptors have an essential physiological role during normal ovary development .
mice homozygous for a notch2 null allele die early during embryogenesis [ 17,18 ] , thus necessitating a conditional gene - deletion strategy to examine the requirement for notch2 gene function during oogenesis .
in this paper , we report that notch2 gene function in the somatic - cell lineage of the mouse ovary is essential for breakdown of germ - cell nests and formation of primordial follicles , and that notch2 function in granulosa cells non - cell - autonomously regulates apoptosis of oocytes in the early postnatal period .
results female amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice exhibit reduced fertility the notch2 gene is expressed at high levels in granulosa cells , the somatic - cell lineage of the ovarian follicle .
to assess whether notch2 gene function is required for correct development of the mouse ovary , we conditionally deleted the notch2 gene in the somatic lineages of the mouse ovary using the anti - mullerian hormone type ii receptor - cre recombinase ( amhr2 - cre ) driver line [ 19 ] .
using southern blotting analysis , we found efficient excision of the notch2flox allele by the amhr2 - cre line in ovary dna , but not in spleen dna ( figure 1 ) .
female amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - and control littermate mice were mated to wild - type c57bl / 6j male mice over a 6 - month period , then we assessed the fertility and reproductive performance of both groups of mice .
the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice exhibited reduced fertility compared with the littermate controls .
female amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice had only approximately one - third as many progeny as control littermates over the 6 - month period , even though amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice had similar total litter numbers to the controls ( table 1 ) .

there was almost complete deletion of the notch2flox allele in ovary dna , but not in spleen dna .
note that the band resulting from cre - mediated recombination ( labeled ' null ') was present only in amhr2 - cre /+ ovaries .

notch2 gene deletion in granulosa cells leads to formation of multi - oocyte follicles and persistence of germ - cell nests histological analysis of ovaries taken from amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice at 3 weeks of age identified the presence of multi - oocyte follicles ( figure 2 ) .
this phenotype was completely penetrant , as all amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice developed multi - oocyte follicles .
as many as 10 oocytes were present in a single follicle in the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries. by 7 weeks of age , the follicles in the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mutant ovaries became hemorrhagic ( figure 2d , f ) .

( c - f ) follicles in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - females became hemorrhagic by approximately 7 weeks of age ( d , f , arrows ) .
the presence of multi - oocyte follicles in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice suggests that notch2 - mediated signaling may be required for breakdown of the primordial germ - cell nests .
in wild - type mice , breakdown of germ - cell nests and formation of primordial follicles are normally complete within a few days of birth .
histological analyses on ovaries isolated at postnatal day ( pnd ) 8 from amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - and control littermate mice showed that , whereas virtually all germ - cell nests in the control mice had broken down to form primordial follicles , there was persistence of germ - cell nests in the cortex of the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries ( figure 3b ) .
this was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining of ovaries isolated at pnd3 , using an antibody to the cytoplasmic germ - cell marker vasa ( ddx4 ) .
in littermate control ovaries at pnd3 , most vasa - positive cells had already been assembled into individual primordial follicles ( figure 3c ) .
however , in the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries , most vasa - positive cells , particularly near the cortical surface of the ovary , remained in germ - cell nests ( figure 3d ). by pnd3 , laminin immunostaining showed that in control littermate mice , the primordial follicles in the cortex of the ovary were surrounded by a basement membrane ( figure 3e ) , whereas in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries , the oocytes remained in the germ - cell nests and were not individually surrounded by a basement membrane ( figure 3f ) .
these data indicate that notch2 gene function in pre - granulosa cells is required for breakdown of the primordial germ - cell nests and assembly of primordial follicles .

ovaries of amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice have increased numbers of oocytes but decreased numbers of primordial follicles to quantify oocyte numbers in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - and control littermate mice , we counted serial sections of ovaries isolated at pnd18 .
this time point was chosen because it is a point shortly before the female mouse reaches sexual maturity .
amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice had approximately 20 % more oocytes than ovaries from littermate controls ( table 2 ) .
we then quantified the type of follicle present ( that is , primordial , primary , secondary , pre - antral , and antral ) and assessed whether these follicles contained a single oocyte , two or three oocytes , or four or more oocytes ( table 3 , figure 4 ) .
for all follicle types , only the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice had four or more oocytes per follicle present in the ovaries ( figure 4 ) .
we divided the follicles into two categories : the resting pool ( consisting only of primordial follicles ) and the growing pool ( primary , secondary , pre - antral , and antral follicles ) .
the pnd18 amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries contained significantly fewer total follicles ( 40.6 % of the control mice ) , and also significantly fewer follicles in the resting pool ( only 16.7 % of the control ) ( table 3 ) .
a significantly reduced number of normal primordial follicles was seen in the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries .
the mutant mice had approximately nine - fold fewer primordial follicles containing a single oocyte than did their littermate controls ( 11.4 % of control ) , and had 13 times more primordial follicles containing four or more oocytes than controls ( figure 4a ) .
regarding the growing pool , the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries had significantly more primary and secondary follicles containing four or more oocytes , and also had more follicles of the primary , secondary , and pre - antral types containing two to three oocytes ( figure 4b - d ) .
however , at pnd18 the total number of follicles in the growing pool ( primary , secondary , pre - antral , and antral ) was not significantly different in the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - and their littermate controls ( table 3 ) .

( a - c ) amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries exhibited a significant increase in the number of multi - oocyte follicles ( containing four or more oocytes ) of ( a ) the primordial , ( b ) primary and ( c ) secondary follicle types compared with littermate control ovaries .
amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries also exhibited a significantly reduced number of primordial follicles containing a single oocyte .
* p < 0.05 ; ** p < 0.005 .
we used the pnd18 oocyte quantification data to estimate the fraction of primordial germ - cell nests that failed to break down properly in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice .
we combined the oocyte numbers from all follicle types ( primordial to antral ) , and assessed in both control littermate and amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice ( n = 4 for each group ) whether the follicles contained a single oocyte , or more than one oocyte ( multi - oocyte follicle ) .
in the control mice , 96.9 % of the follicles contained a single oocyte , and the remaining 3.1 % ( 399 / 12865 ) contained more than one oocyte .
in the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mutants , 60.3 % of the follicles contained a single oocyte , and the remaining 39.7 % ( 2074 / 5223 ) contained more than one oocyte .
assuming that all multi - oocyte follicles resulted from a failure of primordial germ - cell - nest breakdown , these data suggest that approximately 40 % of the primordial germ - cell nests in the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice failed to break down and assemble into follicles with a single oocyte each .
notch2 gene function in granulosa cells is required for non - cell autonomous oocyte apoptosis to address the mechanisms responsible for the 20 % increase in oocyte numbers in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice , we assessed cell proliferation ( by 5 - bromo - 2 ' - deoxyuridine ( brdu ) incorporation ) and apoptotic cell death ( by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate ( tunel ) assay ) in ovaries of amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - and control littermate mice .
in wild - type mouse embryos , oogonia cease mitosis and enter meiosis at approximately embryonic day 13.5 .
we assessed whether oocytes were still proliferating in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - embryos during the period e16.5 to e18.5 , using brdu injection into timed pregnant females .
ovaries from the embryos of the brdu - injected females were isolated and sectioned , and oocytes were identified by immunofluorescence staining with an antibody to the cytoplasmic germ - cell marker vasa .
we identified no oocytes throughout the period e16.5 to e18.5 , in either amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - embryos or their littermate controls , which were double - stained with the anti - vasa and anti - brdu antibodies ( figure 5 , and data not shown ) .
we next examined cell proliferation in the ovaries of neonatal mice at pnd1 and pnd2 by brdu injection at these time points .
quantifying either all brdu - positive cells ( figure 6a ) or brdu - positive pre - granulosa / granulosa cells ( which we defined as a brdu - positive cell directly adjacent to a vasa - positive oocyte ) ( figure 6b ) , we detected no significant differences in the numbers of proliferating cells between the control and the amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries at either pnd1 or pnd2 .
similarly to the embryonic brdu exposure ( figure 5 ) , we did not find any oocytes that were double - stained with the anti - vasa and anti - brdu antibodies , in either amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - embryos or their littermate controls , at pnd1 or pnd2 ( figure 6 , and data not shown ) .
therefore , it did not appear that excess or extended proliferation was the cause of the increase in oocyte numbers in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice .
figure 5 absence of extended oocyte proliferation in embryonic amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - ovaries .
pregnant mice were injected with 5 - bromo - 2 ' - deoxyuridine ( brdu ) twice daily between e16.5 through e18.5 ( a total of six injections ) .
ovaries were isolated from amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - and control littermate progeny on the day of birth ( postnatal day 0 ; pnd0 ) , and sections were stained with anti - vasa ( red ) antibodies to label oocytes , and with anti - brdu ( green ) antibodies to identify proliferating cells .
sections were also counterstained with dapi ( blue ) to stain cell nuclei .
as shown in the merged figure on the right , at pnd0 , no oocyte in either ( a ) littermate control or ( b ) mutant ovaries had incorporated brdu as a result of these injections .

data are presented as the mean +/ - sd of four ovaries from four individual mutant or control mice .

we next assessed apoptotic programmed cell death using tunel ( figure 7 ) .
counting either tunel - positive oocytes ( defined both by double staining with the tunel reaction and anti - vasa antibody , and by the distinct morphology of the oocyte nucleus ) ( figure 7a ) or tunel - positive pre - granulosa / granulosa cells ( defined as a tunel - positive cell directly adjacent to a vasa - positive oocyte ) ( figure 7b ) , we detected significantly fewer apoptotic cells of either type in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mutant ovaries at pnd1. by pnd2 , the numbers of apoptotic cells ( both oocytes and pre - granulosa / granulosa cells ) were not significantly different in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - and control ovaries .
these data support a model in which the increase in oocyte number in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mutant ovaries is caused by reduced oocyte apoptotic cell death during the early postnatal stages .

discussion using a tissue - specific , conditional gene - deletion strategy , we investigated the role of the notch2 gene in the mouse ovary by generating a granulosa - cell - specific notch2 gene deletion with the amhr2 - cre driver .
our results showed that notch2 deletion in granulosa cells resulted in reduced fertility in the conditional mutant female mice , accompanied by the formation of multi - oocyte follicles that became hemorrhagic as the mice aged .
formation of multi - oocyte follicles resulted from defects in breakdown of the primordial germ - cell nests .
in the ovaries of the notch2 conditional mutant females , oocyte numbers were increased as a result of decreased oocyte apoptosis , but the number of normal primordial follicles containing a single oocyte was greatly decreased .
previous studies have shown that the notch2 gene is expressed at high levels in the somatic pre - granulosa [ 14,15 ] and granulosa [ 16 ] cell lineage of the mouse ovary .
in addition , ex vivo culture of neonatal mouse ovaries with gamma - secretase inhibitors ( which abrogate notch signaling ) resulted in defects in granulosa - cell proliferation and primordial - follicle formation [ 14,15 ] , whereas overexpression of the notch2 intracellular domain in these ex vivo cultures promoted granulosa - cell proliferation and rescued the growth inhibition induced by the gamma - secretase inhibitors [ 15 ] .
our study is the first genetic loss - of - function study confirming that notch receptor function plays an essential physiological role in mammalian oogenesis and ovary development .
in the notch2 conditional deletion model , multi - oocyte follicles arise from persistence of germ - cell nests and reduced germ - cell apoptosis , indicating a non - cell autonomous effect on oocyte survival .
these data provide in vivo evidence for the crucial function of the notch2 gene in breakdown of germ - cell nests , postnatal apoptosis of oocytes , and formation of primordial follicles .
other genetic mouse models that develop multi - oocyte follicles have been reported .
these include targeted null mutations for dmrt4 [ 20 ] , ahch / dax1 [ 21 ] , gcnf [ 22 ] , ghr [ 23 ] , bmp15 / gdf9 double mutants [ 24 ] , foxc1 [ 25 ] , the notch signaling modulator lfng [ 26 ] , and transgenic mice with gain of function for rat inhibin - alpha [ 27 ] .
however , a common feature of these models is the formation of multi - oocyte follicles with only a few ( usually two or three ) oocytes in a single follicle , rather than the large numbers of oocytes seen in the multi - oocyte follicles of amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice .
one exception is the generation of mice with multi - oocyte follicles by neonatal administration of various estrogenic compounds , which also results in formation of multi - oocyte follicles containing large numbers of oocytes [ 28 - 30 ] .
in that system , formation of multi - oocyte follicles is dependent on estrogen - receptor signaling .
formation of multi - oocyte follicles in neonatal mice treated with the soybean - derived phytoestrogen genistein was dependent on the presence of a functional beta estrogen receptor ( erbeta ) but not on the alpha estrogen receptor ( eralpha ) [ 28 ] .
mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of the esr1 gene , which encodes eralpha , formed multi - oocyte follicles when treated as neonates with genistein .
however , mice that were homozygous mutant for the esr2 gene ( which encodes erbeta ) did not form multi - oocyte follicles under these conditions , showing that eralpha function is required for formation of multi - oocyte follicles after neonatal genistein administration .
more recent work suggested that , depending on which estrogenic compound is delivered to the neonatal mice , eralpha may also be required for multi - oocyte follicle formation [ 29,31 ] .
estrogen - receptor signaling might also contribute to the hemorrhagic follicle phenotype exhibited by amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice .
mice mutant for eralpha develop hemorrhagic follicles [ 32 - 34 ] similar to those of the notch2 conditional mutant mice , and this phenotype is exacerbated in eralpha - erbeta double mutants [ 33 ] .
it will be extremely interesting to determine if estrogen - receptor - mediated signaling from either the eralpha or erbeta receptor contributes to the mutant phenotypes seen in amhr2 - cre /+ ; notch2flox / - mice .
our results clearly show that notch2 function in somatic granulosa cells is required for breakdown of germ - cell nests and formation of primordial follicles .
however , the identity and cellular source of the notch ligand interacting with the notch2 receptor in granulosa cells is not known .
the model we favor is that expression of the jagged family ligands jag1 and / or jag2 in the oocyte is the source of the ligand signal .
communication between the oocyte and the surrounding somatic cells ( which has been termed the oocyte - granulosa - cell regulatory loop ) is essential for the coordinated development of both the germ - cell and somatic - cell lineages [ 35,36 ] .
gene expression analyses have indicated that only the two jagged family ligands jag1 and jag2 are expressed at high levels in the oocyte ; delta family ligands are expressed only at low to undetectable levels in the developing ovary [ 14 - 16,37 ] .
recent work has shown that jag1 - notch2 signaling is downstream of neurotrophin 4 / 5 and brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) - tyrosine - related kinase ( trk ) receptor b signaling in the ovarian follicle [ 38 ] .
expression of the jag1 gene and the notch target genes hes1 and hey2 is reduced in the ovaries of trkb homozygous mutants at pnd7 .
however , the trkb homozygous mutant mice do not exhibit multi - oocyte follicles , indicating that upstream neurotrophin - trk receptor signaling cannot explain all aspects of the notch2 granulosa - cell - specific deletion phenotype .
however , another possible source for the ligand signal is via jag2 expression in the granulosa cells themselves .
in situ hybridization analysis indicates that the jag2 gene is expressed more strongly in granulosa cells than in the oocyte [ 16 ] .
disruption of cis inhibition [ 39 ] of notch2 - mediated signaling by expression of the ligand jag2 in granulosa cells is an alternative model to explain the requirement for notch2 function in somatic granulosa cells .
determining where the relevant ligand signal is coming from ( that is , oocytes or granulosa cells ) by conditional gene - deletion experiments will be essential to obtain mechanistic understanding of how breakdown of germ - cell nests , postnatal apoptosis of oocytes , and formation of primordial follicles are regulated in wild - type mice , and how these processes are disrupted in the notch2 conditional deletion model .
conclusions we have shown that notch2 - mediated signaling in the somatic - cell lineage of the mouse ovary is essential for regulating breakdown of germ - cell nests and formation of primordial follicles .
female mice with conditional deletion of the notch2 gene in somatic granulosa cells of the ovary exhibited reduced fertility , accompanied by the formation of multi - oocyte follicles .
formation of multi - oocyte follicles resulted from defects in breakdown of the primordial germ - cell nests .
ovaries of the notch2 conditional mutant mice had increased numbers of oocytes , but decreased numbers of primordial follicles .
oocyte numbers in the notch2 conditional mutants were increased not by excess or extended cellular proliferation , but as a result of decreased oocyte apoptosis .
this model provides a new resource for studying the developmental and physiological role of notch signaling during mammalian reproductive biology .
methods ethics statement all animal experiments were carried out with strict adherence to the national institutes of health ( nih ) guidelines for animal care and safety , and were approved by the animal care and use committee of the jackson laboratory ( where the experiments were performed ) .
generation of granulosa - cell - specific notch2 cko mice the amhr2 - cre knock - in allele [ 19 ] was used to drive cre recombinase expression in granulosa cells of the ovary .
the amhr2 - cre allele is expressed by e11.5 in both male and female urogenital ridges , and by e12.5 , expression is localized to somatic cells of the gonads and mesenchyme cells of the mullerian ducts [ 19 ] .
at e17.5 , amhr2 - cre expression is present in almost all somatic cells of the ovary [ 40 ] .
construction and utilization of the notch2 conditional allele ( notch2flox ) and notch2 null allele ( notch2del3 ) have been described previously [ 17,41 ] .
to generate mice with targeted disruption of the notch2 gene in ovarian granulosa cells , mice heterozygous for the notch2 null allele and the amhr2 - cre knock - in allele were crossed with mice homozygous for the notch2flox allele .
mice were genotyped by pcr .
the notch2 null allele was detected using the primers .
notch2 forward and notch2 reverse ( table 4 ) , and the notch2flox allele was detected using the primers flox forward and notch2 reverse ( table 4 ) .

cages were monitored daily , and the numbers of litters and litter sizes were recorded for a 6 - month period .
histology and immunohistochemistry ovaries were removed , fixed overnight in bouin 's fixative for hematoxylin and eosin or periodic - acid - schiff ( pas ) staining , or at 4degreesc in 4 % paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry .
fixed ovaries were embedded in paraffin wax , and cut into sections 6 mum thick .
sections used for immunohistochemistry were washed with phosphate - buffered saline and boiled for 10 minutes in 10 mumol / l sodium citrate ( ph 6.0 ) for antigen retrieval .
sections were then incubated overnight at 4degreesc with primary antibodies ( 1:100 dilution ) directed against : brdu ( bd pharmingen , san jose , ca , usa ) , vasa ( ddx4 ) ( abcam , cambridge , ma , usa ) , amh ( mis , santa cruz , dallas , tx , usa ) , and laminin ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
after washing , sections were incubated with secondary antibodies , either alexa fluor 488 - conjugated or 546 - conjugated donkey anti - mouse , anti - goat , or anti - rabbit ( 1:200 ; invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) , for 2 hours at room temperature , washed , and developed .
negative controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibody , and no staining above the background was detected .
sections from at least three mice of each genotype were processed for comparison of immunostaining , and immunohistochemical studies were repeated three to five times to ensure reproducibility of results .
cell proliferation to examine germ - line cell proliferation , timed pregnant female mice were injected with a brdu solution ( sigma , 10 mg / ml in 50:50 pbs / dmso ; final dose , 3 mg per mouse ) , twice daily ( at 8 - hour intervals ) between e16.5 and e18.5 .
following euthanasia , the ovaries were fixed and embedded in paraffin wax for sectioning .
to study cell proliferation in mice on pnd1 and pnd2 , female mice were injected intraperitoneally with brdu solution at a final dose of 100 mg / kg ( normal body weight approximately 2 g , hence 20 mul each ) .
after 2 hours , the ovaries were harvested .
tissues were embedded in paraffin wax , and serial sections were cut at 6 mum .
sections were dewaxed and rehydrated , and stained with anti - brdu and anti - vasa antibodies .
the total number of brdu - positive cells in every 15th section was determined .
granulosa cells were defined as cells adjacent to the vasa - positive germline cells .
morphological classification and quantification of follicles and oocyte counts ovaries of pnd18 mice were sectioned at 6 mum and stained with pas .
the follicles in each ovary were counted serially in every third section through the entire ovary .
only healthy , non - atretic follicles with visible oocyte nuclei were scored .
follicles were classified as primordial , primary , secondary , pre - antral , or antral .
primordial follicles had a compact oocyte surrounded by a single layer of flattened granulosa cells ; primary follicles had an enlarged oocyte surrounded by a single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells ; secondary follicles had an enlarged oocyte surrounded by two layers of granulosa cells ; and pre - antral follicles had an enlarged oocyte surrounded by three or four layers of granulosa cells .
any follicles with antral spaces were considered antral follicles .
total oocyte numbers at pnd18 were counted serially in every 15th section through the entire ovary by counting every oocyte in the section .
total oocyte numbers at pnd1 and 2 were counted serially in every 15th section through the entire ovary by counting every oocyte with positive vasa and dapi staining in the section .

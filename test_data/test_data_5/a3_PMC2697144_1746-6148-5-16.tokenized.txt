background the public health threat represented by a potential circulation of bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent in sheep population has led european animal health authorities to launch large screening and genetic selection programmes .
if demonstrated , such a circulation would have dramatic economic consequences for sheep breeding sector .
in this context , it is important to evaluate the feasibility of qualification procedures that would allow sheep breeders demonstrating their flock is free from scrapie .
classical approaches , based on surveys designed to detect disease presence , do not account for scrapie specificities : the genetic variations of susceptibility and the absence of live diagnostic test routinely available .
adapting these approaches leads to a paradoxical situation in which a greater amount of testing is needed to substantiate disease freedom in genetically resistant flocks than in susceptible flocks , whereas probability of disease freedom is a priori higher in the former than in the latter .
the goal of this study was to propose , evaluate and compare several qualification strategies for demonstrating a flock is free from scrapie .
results a probabilistic framework was defined that accounts for scrapie specificities and allows solving the preceding paradox .
six qualification strategies were defined that combine genotyping data , diagnostic tests results and flock pedigree .
these were compared in two types of simulated flocks : resistant and susceptible flocks .
two strategies allowed demonstrating disease freedom in several years , for the majority of simulated flocks : a strategy in which all the flock animals are genotyped , and a strategy in which only founders animals are genotyped , the flock pedigree being known .
in both cases , diagnostic tests are performed on culled animals .
the less costly strategy varied according to the genetic context ( resistant or susceptible ) and to the relative costs of a genotyping exam and of a diagnostic test .
conclusion this work demonstrates that combining data sources allows substantiating a flock is free from scrapie within a reasonable time frame .
qualification schemes could thus be a useful tool for voluntary or mandatory scrapie control programmes .
however , there is no general strategy that would always minimize the costs and choice of the strategy should be adapted to local genetic conditions .
background scrapie is a neuro - degenerative transmissible disease , known since the 18th century , that affects small ruminants and belongs to the group of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( tses ) .
diseases of this group are characterized by the accumulation in the brain of an anomalous form of the prion protein ( prp ) , that induces nervous clinical signs leading to death .
bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) and creutzfeldt - jakob disease are two other members of this group that respectively affect cattle and human .
bse was first described in 1987 [ 1 ] .
in the following year , field studies allowed epidemiologists to identify its major transmission mode , meat and bone meal [ 2 ] , and a first set of control measures were taken to break the transmission cycle .
ten years later , laboratory studies and epidemiological features showed that bse agent was the probable cause of a new form of creutzfeldt - jakob disease in human [ 3,4 ] , and a second set of control measures were taken , for public health protection .
during bse epidemic , european sheep were probably exposed to food contaminated by the bse agent .
experimental studies have shown that sheep may be infected by bse agent [ 5 ] , and that the clinical signs are then identical to those of scrapie [ 6 ] .
furthermore , transmission experiments have shown the possibility of an horizontal transmission of bse agent among sheep [ 7,8 ] .
if sheep flocks have been exposed to bse agent , a " sheep bse " could thus exist and propagate silently , clinical cases being identified as scrapie cases [ 9 ] .
the potential threat for public health induced by such a propagation led european animal health authorities to launch screening programmes for detecting bse cases in small ruminants .
to date , these programmes failed to detect bse in sheep , but allowed to identify a tse case in a goat , the agent signature of which could not be distinguished from that of bse [ 10 ] .
distribution of pathological changes in the brain as well as western blot profiles allow to distinguish two scrapie types : classical scrapie and atypical scrapie .
epidemiological studies suggest that the aetiology and epidemiology of these two scrapie types are different , the infectious nature of atypical scrapie being uncertain [ 11 ] .
the present study is specifically dedicated to classical scrapie , and the word ' scrapie ' will be used below for ' classical scrapie ' .
genetic variations of susceptibility to scrapie have been described in numerous studies [ 12,13 ] .
these variations are associated with the polymorphism of prp gene , and individual susceptibility to scrapie may be characterized by three codons of this gene [ 14 ] .
despite available data are sparse , genetic susceptibility profiles to bse in sheep seem similar to those of scrapie .
selection programmes have thus been launched in several european countries , that aim at eliminating the most susceptible alleles to decrease circulation of scrapie agent as well as the potential circulation of bse agent in sheep [ 15 ] .
besides large abattoir or fallen stock screening programmes ( which are very costly ) and genetic selection programmes ( the effects of which appear slowly in the general population ) , an intermediate approach centred on the flock may be proposed .
as for other transmissible diseases , existence of a procedure to substantiate flock freedom from scrapie would allow defining objectively a subset of population considered as scrapie - free , a distinction that could be the basis of measures oriented towards public health or animal health .
if a circulation of bse agent in sheep flocks were demonstrated , such a qualification procedure would probably become mandatory , and form the basis of scrapie eradication plans , similar to those dedicated to other transmissible diseases such as tuberculosis or brucellosis .
however , a first particularity of scrapie is that unlike other transmissible diseases , no live animals tests are currently used in the eu for routine diagnostic , as tests are performed on brain samples .
therefore , scrapie can only be routinely diagnosed on slaughtered or dead animals .
for other transmissible diseases , the status of a herd can be determined by testing all the animals living in that herd .
but for scrapie , the status of a flock can only be based upon test results obtained from animals leaving the flock , that represent the remaining animals .
a second particularity of scrapie is that evidence of freedom from disease can not only be based on negative test results obtained on a sample of animals from the flock , but also on genetic data .
knowledge of the genotypes of the tested animals is necessary to interpret results of diagnostic tests : a negative result obtained from a genetically susceptible animal brings more evidence of scrapie freedom than a negative result obtained from a genetically resistant animal ( because even if the flock were infected , this animal would probably have remained negative ) .
ideally , if live animals tests could be routinely used and if a full knowledge of flock genetics were available , animals of the most susceptible genotypes should be tested first to detect disease presence .
however , in practice , it is not the case , and this situation leads to a paradox for flocks with a majority of genetically resistant animals : while in such flocks , the probability to be free from scrapie should be considered as high even if no animal has been tested for disease detection , performing diagnostic tests on the flock animals does not bring significant evidence of scrapie freedom as these animals are genetically resistant .
substantiating scrapie freedom through disease detection surveys would then be more difficult in resistant flocks than in susceptible flocks .
the objective of this study was to propose a framework for solving the preceding paradox , that allowed defining and comparing several practical approaches ( termed below " qualification strategies ") for substantiating scrapie freedom in a flock .
these took into account scrapie specificities and differed according to how results of diagnostic tests were combined with genetic data to provide evidence of freedom from scrapie .
two sources of genetic data were considered : genotyping exams that may be performed on some of the flock animals , and flock pedigree ( the set of parent - child relationships for the flock animals ) that may also allow to derive genotype - associated probabilities for non - genotyped animals [ 16 ] .
feasibility of the proposed qualification strategies was quantified , in terms of probability for a scrapie - free simulated flock to be classified as such within a reasonable time .
the corresponding durations were evaluated , as well as the associated costs : numbers of diagnostic tests and genotyping exams performed .
the strategy for which the associated cost is the lowest was finally determined , as well as how this one varies according to the unitary costs of genotyping exams and diagnostic tests .
results qualification strategies a qualification strategy was defined by a specific combination of a testing scheme , a genotyping scheme and a level of information about flock pedigree .
two testing schemes were used : either no diagnostic test is performed , or all the culled animals are tested .
three genotyping schemes were considered : all the animals may be genotyped , leading to a full knowledge of the flock genetics ; genotyping exams may be restricted to culled animals , or to founders animals .
founders animals are animals born in another flock , or animals of which one of the parents or both has been sold or culled ( i.e. slaughtered at the end of its reproductive life ) .
the third genotyping scheme thus supposes the pedigree is known : two information levels about flock pedigree were considered , the pedigree being either completely known or non - documented .
combining the preceding testing schemes , genotyping scheme and information levels about flock pedigree led us to define six qualification strategies : - two genotyping - oriented strategies in which full genetic knowledge is available ( all animals having been genotyped ) , with ( strategy a1 ) or without ( strategy a2 ) diagnostic test performed on the culled animals , - two diagnostic - oriented strategies in which a diagnostic test and a genotyping exam are performed on each culled animal , the flock pedigree being either known ( strategy b1 ) or unknown ( strategy b2 ) , - two pedigree - oriented strategies in which the flock pedigree is fully known and founders animals are genotyped , with ( strategy c1 ) or without ( strategy c2 ) diagnostic test performed on the culled animals .
whatever the strategy , we assumed that , as soon as the flock is involved in a qualification process , rams used for mating are genotyped , and the farmer does not introduce any ram of the most susceptible genotype in his flock .
success or failure of the qualification process in the simulations performed , two strategies always succeeded in a susceptible population ( table 1 ) : a genotyping - oriented strategy ( a1 ) and a pedigree - oriented strategy ( c1 ) .
in both cases , genetic or pedigree knowledge is complemented by diagnostic tests on culled animals .
performing these diagnostic tests appeared essential , as the parallel versions of strategies for which no diagnostic test is performed ( strategies a2 and c2 ) showed either a low success rate ( a2 ) or a constant failure ( c2 ) .
performing diagnostic tests was however clearly not sufficient , as diagnostic - oriented strategies showed very low success rates ( table 1 ) .
strategy b2 , based on testing and genotyping of culled animals , always failed .
knowledge of the flock pedigree brought limited added value and the success rate remained low ( 12 %) for strategy b1 .

results obtained in simulated flocks from a susceptible ( 30 % susceptibility alleles and 10 % resistance alleles , 50 flocks ) and from a resistant population ( 10 % susceptibility alleles and 30 % resistance alleles , 50 flocks ) according to the qualification strategy : ( i ) full genotyping with ( a1 ) or without ( a2 ) negative test results for culled animals , ( ii ) genotyping and negative test result for each culled animal with ( b1 ) or without ( b2 ) known flock pedigree , and ( iii ) genotyping of founders animals with known flock pedigree with ( c1 ) or without ( c2 ) negative test result for culled animals ) .
the design prevalence is 1 % .
in a resistant population , strategies a1 and c1 were again those for which success rate was the highest : 94 % ( table 1 ) .
their performances appeared very close , as both strategies failed in the same three simulated flocks .
performing diagnostic tests appeared less essential than in a susceptible population , as strategy a2 showed a significant success rate : 86 % .
this rate remained however low for strategy c2 ( genotyping of founders animals without testing of culled animals : 38 %) .
diagnostic - oriented strategies always failed .
duration of the qualification process in a susceptible population , strategies a1 and c1 were the only strategies for which high success rates were achieved .
qualification successes were obtained between the 4th and the 9th year ( figure 1 , left ) , with an mean value of 6 years ( table 1 ) .
distributions of the qualification process duration were very close ( figure 1 , left ) , and in 62 % of the 50 simulated flocks , both durations were identical .
absolute difference was <= 1 year in 96 % of simulated flocks .

results obtained in simulated flocks from a susceptible ( left : 30 % susceptibility alleles and 10 % resistance alleles , 50 flocks ) and from a resistant population ( right : 10 % susceptibility alleles and 30 % resistance alleles , 50 flocks ) according to the qualification strategy : ( i ) full genotyping ( circles ) with ( a1 : solid line , filled symbol ) or without ( a2 : dashed line , hollow symbol ) negative test results for culled animals , ( ii ) genotyping and negative test result for each culled animal ( squares ) with ( b1 : solid line , filled symbol ) or without ( b2 : dashed line , hollow symbol ) known flock pedigree , and ( iii ) genotyping of founders animals with known flock pedigree ( triangles ) with ( c1 : solid line , filled symbol ) or without ( c2 : dashed line , hollow symbol ) negative test result for culled animals ) .
the design prevalence is 1 % .
in a resistant population , mean duration of the qualification process was 4 years with strategies a1 and c1 , i.e. 2 years shorter than in a susceptible population .
distributions of the qualification process duration ( figure 1 , right ) showed that , if average durations are identical , the earliest successes were obtained with strategy a1 : qualification succeeded at the 1st simulated year in approximately 15 % of simulated flocks , duration being <= 2 years in about one quarter of the simulated flocks .
conversely , with strategy c1 , no qualification success was obtained at the 1st year , and very few at the the 2nd year .
for both strategies , the longest observed durations were 7 years .
finally , with strategy a2 , average qualification was 1 year longer than with strategies a1 and c1 ( table 1 ) .
distribution of qualification durations ( figure 1 , right ) appeared comparable to the distribution obtained for a1 , the final proportion of qualification successes being lower .
costs of qualification process in a susceptible population , with strategies a1 and c1 , approximately 200 diagnostic tests were performed , on average , before qualification succeeded. with strategy c1 , the number of genotyping exams was however much lower than with strategy a1 ( table 1 ) .
the strategy with the lowest cost was thus strategy c1 , whatever the genotyping / diagnostic test unitary costs ratio ( figure 2 , left ) .
in particular , even if the cost of a genotyping exam is very low ( ratio of 0.1 ) , strategy c1 remained the strategy with the lowest cost in approximately 3 / 4 of simulated flocks .
figure 2 qualification strategy with the lowest associated cost according to the genotyping / diagnostic test unitary costs ratio .
results obtained in simulated flocks from a susceptible ( left : 30 % susceptibility alleles and 10 % resistance alleles , 50 flocks ) and from a resistant population ( right : 10 % susceptibility alleles and 30 % resistance alleles , 50 flocks ) according to the qualification strategy : ( i ) full genotyping ( circles ) with ( a1 : solid line , filled symbol ) or without ( a2 : dashed line , hollow symbol ) negative test results for culled animals , ( ii ) genotyping and negative test result for each culled animal ( squares ) with ( b1 : solid line , filled symbol ) or without ( b2 : dashed line , hollow symbol ) known flock pedigree , and ( iii ) genotyping of founders animals with known flock pedigree ( triangles ) with ( c1 : solid line , filled symbol ) or without ( c2 : dashed line , hollow symbol ) negative test result for culled animals ) .
the design prevalence is 1 % .
in a resistant population similar results were obtained when comparing average costs with strategies a1 and c1 ( table 1 ) : average number of diagnostic tests were very close ( 140 tests ) but the average number of genotyping exams was 3 times higher with strategy a1 .
strategy a2 ( full genotyping without testing of culled animals ) represented however a possible alternative for which the number of genotyping exams was close to that performed with strategy a1 , but for which no diagnostic test was performed .
the identity of the strategy with the lowest associated cost was thus more variable when the genotyping / diagnostic test unitary costs ratio changed ( figure 2 , right ) .
if the cost of a genotyping exam was less than half that of a diagnostic test , the strategy with the lowest associated cost was a2 .
in particular , if the unitary cost of genotyping exams was very low ( ratio of 0.1 ) , strategy a2 was the less costly strategy for 60 % of simulated flocks .
conversely , if the cost of a genotyping exam was more than half that of a diagnostic test , the strategy with the lowest associated cost was c1 .
strategy c2 had an intermediate position between a2 and c1 , but its success rate was low .
discussion most of the methods for demonstrating the absence of a transmissible disease have been developed at the zone or the country level , but they can be applied at the flock level .
these methods are entirely or partly based upon random surveys in the studied population , designed to detect the disease if it is present at a given level ( the design prevalence ) .
if the survey fails to detect any infected animal , one can state with a certain probability that the disease level is below the design prevalence , and , in practice , the population is considered disease - free .
several studies have been published for computing sample size considering either a diagnostic test of perfect sensitivity and specificity [ 17 ] , or an imperfect diagnostic test [ 18,19 ] .
a common assumption of the preceding approaches is that , when the disease is present , all the tested animals have the same probability to be found infected .
this assumption is not always the case .
several tests with different sensitivities may be used on different animals [ 20 ] .
individual variations of test sensitivity may also exist .
for bse , as infection evolves slowly in the infected animals , the probability for an infected animal to be test - positive increases with age [ 21,22 ] .
these variations may be taken into account by weighting each negative diagnostic result by the corresponding sensitivity , considering both individual sensitivity variations and tests sensitivity variations .
for example , bse negative test results obtained from old animals ( for which sensitivity is high ) bring more evidence of disease freedom than negative test results obtained from young animals ( for which sensitivity is low ) .
this approach may be adapted to scrapie , considering genetic variations of susceptibility as individual variations of the probability to detect the disease when a flock is infected .
negative test results obtained in animals of susceptible genotypes should then bring more evidence of disease freedom than negative test results obtained in animals of resistant genotypes .
however , this leads to a paradoxical situation in which , for substantiating disease freedom , a greater amount of testing is needed in resistant flocks than in susceptible flocks , despite the fact that the probability of disease freedom is a priori higher in resistant flocks than in susceptible flocks .
to solve this paradox , a possible approach would be to combine random survey results with another source of data aiming at evaluating overall flock susceptibility to infection ( i.e. the probability that , if introduced in the flock , disease agent would circulate ) .
a flock would then be considered scrapie - free either on the basis of a very low flock susceptibility level ( most or all the animals being of resistant genotypes ) , or on the basis of the negative results of a random survey , or on the basis of a combination of the two preceding data sources using methods such as stochastic scenario trees [ 23 ] .
however , instead of considering two separate sources of evidence for scrapie freedom , we chose to adapt the probabilistic framework in order to solve the preceding paradox .
the proposed approach may be used for finite populations , when individual susceptibility to infection can be considered as being binary , and when individual characteristics allow to compute , for each animal of the flock , the probability to be susceptible to infection .
the survey aiming at detecting disease is then modelled as an hypergeometric process that allows taking into account both the flock susceptibility ( the number of susceptible animals ) and the amount of testing done .
in particular , the proposed approach accounts for the fact that if the flock susceptibility level is low ( most of the animals belonging to resistant genotypes ) , the probability that the number of susceptible animals is below the design prevalence may be high enough for substantiating scrapie freedom without performing any diagnostic test .
several qualification strategies are proposed for demonstrating a flock is free from scrapie ( design prevalence : 1 %) : genotyping - oriented strategies , diagnostic - oriented strategies and pedigree - oriented strategies .
results show that genetic data play a central role for substantiating freedom from scrapie , as the diagnostic - oriented strategies fail in most cases .
thus performing diagnostic tests and genotyping exams on all culled animals does not allow demonstrating scrapie absence within a reasonable time horizon ( 10 years ) .
oppositely , two strategies show close and satisfactory performances : a genotyping - oriented strategy in which all the flock animals are genotyped and a pedigree - oriented strategy in which only founders animals are genotyped , the flock pedigree being known .
in both cases , diagnostic tests are performed on culled animals .
these two strategies are successful in the vast majority of cases .
four years on average are required to demonstrate disease freedom in a resistant population ( 30 % of resistance alleles , 10 % susceptibility alleles ) , and six years in a susceptible population ( 10 % of resistance alleles , 30 % susceptibility alleles ) .
the pedigree - oriented strategy is however the less costly and , more generally , results show that knowing the flock pedigree always brings a significant added - value , as it allows reducing the amount of genotyping exams .
if not routinely recorded , documenting the flock pedigree should thus be encouraged .
in the proposed approach , knowledge of flock pedigree is assumed perfect ; the model can however be easily modified to take into account incomplete or imprecise knowledge of flock pedigree .
global cost for substantiating freedom from scrapie depends upon the unitary costs of genotyping exams and of diagnostic tests .
considering a reasonable domain for the ratio between these two unitary costs ( from 1 / 10 to 10 ) allows to show that , in a susceptible population , a dominant strategy exists : the pedigree - oriented strategy described above is the less costly in the vast majority of cases .
the situation is less clear in a resistant population .
a genotyping - oriented strategy , solely based upon the realization of genotyping exams on all the flock animals , becomes a valuable alternative to the preceding pedigree - oriented strategy .
in particular , when the cost of a genotyping exam is less than half the cost of a diagnostic test ( which corresponds to the present situation in france ) , this genotyping - oriented strategy becomes the lowest - cost strategy .
conclusion while performed for a single flock type and two genetic contexts , our study shows that it is possible to demonstrate that scrapie is absent from a flock .
however , there is no general strategy that would always minimize the costs , and in practice , the choice of a qualification strategy should be adapted to genetic conditions ( e.g. average resistance level in the breed ) , as well as to the respective costs of diagnostic tests and genotyping exams .
the duration before scrapie freedom is demonstrated remains long ( except for flocks with a high genetic resistance level ) and lasts several years .
nevertheless , qualification schemes could be useful tools for scrapie control programmes .
in the case of voluntary control programmes , the practical interest of such schemes remains to be investigated , by comparing potential benefits brought by a qualification ( added value of the produced animals ) with costs induced by qualification procedure .
however , if a circulation of bse agent in sheep flock were demonstrated , scrapie control programmes would probably quickly become mandatory ( or strongly encouraged through trade restrictions ) .
as for other infectious diseases , qualification schemes could then be used to classify flocks according to their status , a classification upon which control measures could be based .
methods substantiating freedom of a genetically controlled infectious disease posit a flock composed of n animals numbered 1 - n , of which a subset j has been tested negative for infection detection .
test sensitivity and specificity are assumed perfect .
we consider a binary model for individual susceptibility : either an animal is fully susceptible to infection , or it is refractory and can not be infected ( or would then clear quickly the infectious agent ) .
let si be the susceptibility status of the ith animal : si = 0 if animal i is refractory and si = 1 otherwise .
we define the posterior distribution of within - herd prevalence , denoted d ( the number of infected animals ) , conditional to the the fact that all the test results obtained in the animals of j were negative : ( 1 ) where : - < 0,1 > n represents the set of all the possible n - length sequences composed of zeros and ones and xi is the ith element of sequence x , - p ( d = d | m , m ) is the posterior probability of prevalence , given the number m of fully susceptible animals in the flock and the number m of fully susceptible animals among those tested , all of which were found uninfected .
if the tested animals are randomly chosen , the number of infected animals in the sample j results from an hypergeometric process : m animals are randomly picked without replacement from a group of m animals of which d are infected , and each of these m animals turns out to be uninfected .
we suppose that no information is available about infection prevalence within the flock .
an uniform prior is thus used and p ( d = d | m , m ) is [ 24 ] : ( 2 ) now we assume that the control of individual susceptibility to infection is genetic .
the probability p ( si = 1 ) thus depends on the genotype of animal i , denoted gi. posit a set of n possible genotypes ranked by increasing susceptibility : g1 corresponds to the most resistant genotype , while gn corresponds to the most susceptible one .
genotype - specific susceptibility is modelled by the probability , for an animal of a given genotype , to be fully susceptible to infection .
all the animals of the most susceptible genotype gn are assumed fully susceptible to infection .
for the other genotypes , this probability is measured by the relative risk of infection rrx , for animals of genotype gx taking as a reference the animals of the most susceptible genotype gn : ( 3 ) the overall probability for an animal to be fully susceptible to infection is then the mean of the genotype - specific relative risks , weighted by the probability , for the animal , to harbour the specified genotype : ( 4 ) similarly , the overall probability for an animal to be refractory to infection is : ( 5 ) equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) can be combined : ( 6 ) substituting the preceding expression in equation ( 1 ) finally gives : ( 7 ) exact computation of equation ( 7 ) has a complexity proportional to nn , which is not computationally tractable except for very small values of n and n. therefore a monte - carlo procedure is used to estimate the posterior probability distribution for the number of infected animals in the flock .
the susceptibility status of each animal is randomly set under the probability ( 8 ) , and equation ( 2 ) is then used to generate a posterior probability distribution .
both operations are repeated 103 times .
the estimate of the posterior probability distribution of within - flock prevalence is the average of these 103 distributions .
( 8 ) the posterior distribution of prevalence is finally used to compute the probability that the negative test results observed in sample j would be achieved if the disease were present at a specified level : the design prevalence [ 20 ] , denoted pi : ( 9 ) combining data sources for substantiating disease freedom the above approach for estimating the posterior probability distribution of prevalence is based upon two flock - specific data sources : the set j of tested animals , and the genotype - specific probabilities p ( gi = gx ) , for each individual i , to harbour genotype x. the set of tested animals is an input data directly defined by some testing scheme .
note that the above approach allows deriving a posterior distribution of d , even if no animal is tested for infection detection ( j is empty ) .
in this case , the result is the distribution of the number of fully susceptible animals in the flock .
if , according to this distribution , the proportion of fully susceptible animals is lower than the design prevalence ( at a predefined confidence level ) , the flock may be considered scrapie free without performing any test .
two kinds of data may be used to set the genotype - specific probabilities : results of genotyping exams , and pedigree data that correspond to the parent - child relationships between the flock animals .
the three following rules are used to set p ( gi = gx ) for each individual : ( 1 ) if animal i has been genotyped , we set p ( gi = gamma ) = 1 and 0 for the genotypes other than gamma , where gamma is the actual genotype of i ( genotyping errors are neglected ) .
( 2 ) if animal i has not been genotyped and if the flock pedigree is unknown , some default genotype - specific probabilities must be used .
a first approach would be to use the distribution of genotypes in the population to which the flock belongs ( e.g. the sheep breed population ) .
however this is not consistent with a context of qualification where the goal is to bring convincing elements showing that the infection is not present in a specific flock ( not in an average flock ) .
default genotype - associated probabilities are thus set assuming the worst case scenario .
if animal i has been tested for infection detection ( i in j ) , the default value is the most resistant genotype : p ( gi = g1 ) = 1 and 0 for the genotypes other than g1 .
conversely , if animal i has not been tested , default value is the most susceptible genotype : p ( gi = gn ) = 1 and 0 for the genotypes other than gn .
( 3 ) if animal i has not been genotyped and if the flock pedigree is known , the latter is used to compute the genotype - associated probabilities .
pedigree analysis methods allow to derive , from partial genotyping data , genotype - associated probabilities for each of the individuals of a pedigree .
exact probabilities may be computed for simple pedigrees using algorithms known as peeling algorithms [ 25 ] .
when the pedigree contains loops ( e.g. when a ram is crossed with one of its daughters , which is common ) , only estimates can be obtained using iterative algorithms [ 26,27 ] .
we use the iterative algorithm proposed by thallman et al. for large pedigrees [ 28,29 ] .
this implies to set the genotype - associated probabilities for founders animals .
for non - genotyped founders animals , the rule ( 2 ) is applied , whereas for the genotyped animals rule ( 1 ) is applied .
comparing qualification strategies in simulated flocks random generation of flock genetic trajectories qualification strategies were compared in simulated flocks , the genetic trajectories of which were randomly generated .
we used a simple individual - centered simulation program in which each animal was represented by a unique id , its genotype , sex , year of birth , and the couple of ids of its parents .
time was discrete with a yearly time step .
each simulated year , the program simulated the culling of ewes and rams followed by the purchase of renewal rams and the birth of lambs of which some were kept as renewal animals .
yearly ewes culling risk was supposed to increase linearly with age , and age at cull thus followed a weibull distribution with a shape parameter of 2 and a scale parameter of 4 ee / gamma ( 3 / 2 ) ( where ee is ewes life expectancy and gamma is the gamma function ) [ 30 ] .
this distribution was used to choose randomly , at each time step , the list of the culled ewes .
culled rams were randomly chosen under a probability of 1 / er , where er is the average residence time of a ram in a given flock .
flock renewal aimed at maintaining flock size at a constant level .
we assumed that renewal rams were always purchased .
their genotype was randomly chosen from the distribution of genotypes in the population to which the flock belongs denoted ( excluding the most susceptible gn rams when the flock was involved in a qualification process ) .
we assumed the flock closed for ewes renewal .
for each renewal female lamb , the parents ids were randomly chosen among ewes and rams .
the genotypes of both parents then allowed choosing randomly the genotype of the product according to mendel 's laws .
parameterization and exploitation simulated flocks had a medium size , with 150 ewes and 4 rams .
for ewes , we assumed a life expectancy ee = 4 years and a maximal age of 10 years .
rams were kept , on average , er = 2 years .
three allelic classes were considered ( susceptibility alleles , intermediate alleles and resistance alleles ) [ 31 ] .
they defined n = 6 genotypes , from g1 ( the most resistant genotype ) to g6 ( the most susceptible genotype ) .
genotype - specific relative risks of infection decreased linearly on a log10 scale , from rr6 = 1 to rr1 = 10 - 5 .
two distinct contexts were considered for the genotypes distribution in the population : - a susceptible population , with 30 % of susceptibility alleles and 10 % of resistance alleles , - a resistant population , with 10 % of susceptibility alleles , and 30 % of resistance alleles .
qualification strategies were compared in 50 randomly generated flocks for each of the two preceding populations .
initial flock composition was randomly generated from . at each simulated year , the six qualification strategies were successively simulated to compute the six corresponding posterior prevalence distributions .
time horizon was 10 years .
prevalence distributions were then used to calculate for each simulated year and qualification strategy , the probability that infection prevalence was below the design prevalence ( eq. 9 ) .
sensitivity and specificity of scrapie diagnostic tests were assumed perfect .
this assumption allowed to simplify the probabilistic model and its parameterization .
however , it is known that the tests routinely used for scrapie diagnostic have a limited sensitivity , due to the nature of the biological sample ( obex ) .
a recent study [ 32 ] showed that , in an affected flock , 40 animals were obex - positive while 13 were obex - negative but positive for samples from lymphoreticular system .
this corresponds to a relative sensitivity of 75 % for rapid tests on obex , taking as a reference the joint results of rapid tests on obex and on samples from lymphoreticular system .
to compensate for this non - perfect sensitivity , a low value of 1 % was chosen for the design prevalence , below the range of 5 - 30 % reported in published studies [ 32 ] .
strategies were first compared in terms of success / failure .
qualification process failed if , after 10 simulated years , the probability that infection prevalence is below the design prevalence remained < 95 % .
conversely , if this probability was >= 95 % at the 10th year or before , qualification process was considered to be successful , and ended .
for each population , proportions of successes associated to each strategy were computed and compared .
qualification successes may be obtained more or less early before the 10th year .
when qualification process succeeded , its duration ( number of years ) was calculated .
for each population , strategy - specific distributions of this duration were computed and compared .
finally , besides the duration of the qualification process , the associated costs may be computed in terms of numbers of diagnostic tests and genotyping exams that have been performed .
strategies defined above use preferentially either diagnostic tests , or genotyping exams , or both .
actual costs will depend on the corresponding unitary costs .
instead of fixing these arbitrarily , we considered their ratio that allowed us to determine , for a specific flock , the strategy with the lowest associated cost .
fixing the value of the genotyping / diagnostic test unitary cost ratio , it was possible to compute , for each population , the probability that a given strategy was the lowest cost strategy ( i.e. the proportion of the simulated flocks for which this strategy had the lowest associated cost ) .
these strategy - associated probabilities were computed for varying unitary costs ratios ( between 0.1 and 10 ) .

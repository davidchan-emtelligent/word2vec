background : the metered - dose inhalers ( mdis ) currently available for inhaled corticosteroid delivery do not offer an integrated dose counter ; therefore , it is difficult to evaluate adherence of patients .
the present authors developed a linear regression equation using canister weight to calculate the number of doses actuated from the mdis .
this study aimed to assess medical adherence after the integration of regular weighing of the canisters into the routine service .
methods : a cohort study was carried out between may 2013 and april 2014 .
children aged less than 8 years with a diagnosis of asthma were recruited .
the duration of adherence assessment was 24 weeks .
participants had a regular schedule every 8 weeks to obtain a new flixotide ( r ) 125 inhaler .
parents were asked to collect the discarded mdi canisters , which were then weighed by a laboratory scale .
the weight of each canister was replaced in the regression equation to calculate the number of doses actuated from the mdis .
results : a total of 52 asthmatic children participated in the study .
the median age was 52.7 months .
at the end of 24 weeks , 44 , 33 , and 23 discarded mdi canisters were collected from visits 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
the median percentages of adherence were 96.8 % , 96.3 % , and 96.3 % , respectively .
in 11 discarded canisters ( 11 %) , the remaining medication was more than 30 % of the labeled doses .
approximately 90 % of the participants had no asthma exacerbation during 24 - week study period .
conclusion : high adherence rates were achieved after integration of canister weighing into the asthma care service .

introduction inhaled corticosteroids ( icss ) are the standard treatment for asthmatic children .
non - adherence with prescribed ics treatment clearly causes uncontrolled asthma 1 .
feedback from parents is the traditional approach to assess the adherence to the treatment regimen ; however , there is an overestimation by the patients of the remaining amount of medication 2 .
even though integration of a dose counter into the inhaler device improves the tracking adherence to prescribed medication 3 , the metered - dose inhalers ( mdis ) currently available for ics delivery do not offer integrated dose counters .
weighing of the mdi canisters may be an alternative method to assess a patient 's medication adherence .
the present authors previously developed a linear regression equation using canister weight to calculate the number of doses actuated from the mdis 4 .
weighing of the canisters was implemented into our asthma care system in march 2013 .
this study was designed to assess a patient 's medication adherence after the integration of regular weighing of the canisters into the routine service .
methods study design and subjects a cohort study was carried out between may 2013 and april 2014 .
the inclusion criteria were children aged less than 8 years with a diagnosis of asthma who attended the pediatric allergy clinic at songklanagarind hospital ( hat yai , songkhla , thailand ) and had exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalization or an emergency department visit within the previous year .
patients who had a previous history of intubation or other chronic conditions were excluded .
the research protocol ( rec 55 - 021 - 01 - 1 - 2 ) was approved by the human research ethics committee , faculty of medicine , prince of songkla university .
informed consent was obtained from the parents / guardians .
asthma management fluticasone propionate was selected as the ics therapy for the study .
a flixotide ( r ) 125 inhaler ( glaxosmithkline ) is a pressurized metered - dose inhaler , which delivers 125 microgram of fluticasone propionate per actuation .
each canister supplies 120 actuations .
flixotide ( r ) 125 inhaler and babyhaler ( r ) ( glaxosmithkline ) , a device to help patients taking inhaled medicine , were prescribed to all participants .
the dosage of fluticasone propionate was one actuation twice a day .
the add - on asthma therapies were provided according to the gina guideline 5 .
participants needed to participate in a regular schedule every 8 weeks to obtain a new flixotide ( r ) 125 inhaler .
for patients who did not achieve adequate control or maintain the adherence rate , the inhalation technique and medication doses were revised at the time they visited the clinic .
exacerbation was defined as asthma deterioration that required treatment with systemic corticosteroids or emergency department utilization or hospitalization .
adherence assessment the duration of adherence assessment was 24 weeks .
each participant received three canisters of flixotide ( r ) 125 inhaler .
parents were asked to collect the discarded inhalers at the 8 - week ( visit 1 ) , 16 - week ( visit 2 ) , and 24 - week ( visit 3 ) after recruitment .
the discarded mdi canisters were weighed by a laboratory scale ( sartorius basic ( r )) .
the weight of each canister was replaced in the regression equation to calculate the number of doses actuated from the mdis .
a regression equation for a fluticasone propionate mdi canister gives the number ( n ) of doses actuated from the mdis : n = 276.16 - ( 14.62 x canister weight ) .
4 statistical analysis all of the statistical analyses were conducted with r software ( version 3.3.2 ) by the r foundation for statistical computing .
adherence in each 8 - week interval was calculated as the amount of medication actuated divided by the amount prescribed .
percentage of adherence was reported as median and range .
results a total of 52 asthmatic children participated in the study .
the characteristics of the participants are shown in table 1 .
half of the participants were male .
the median age was 52.7 months ( range , 18.3 - 91.7 ) and the age at the onset of asthma was 12 months ( range , 1.0 - 48.0 ) .
parents were the major caregivers .
in total , 32 % of the participants had other allergic co - morbidities .
most of participants had received ics therapy for longer than 3 months .
at the end of 24 weeks , 44 , 33 , and 23 ( total 100 ) discarded mdi canisters were collected from visits 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .
the remaining median weights of the discarded canisters from visits 1 , 2 , and 3 were 11.172g , 11.229g , and 11.113 g , respectively , and the median percentages of adherence were 96.8 % , 96.3 % , and 96.3 % , respectively .
in 11 discarded canisters ( 11 %) , the remaining medication was more than 30 % of the labeled doses .
approximately 90 % of the participants had no asthma exacerbation during 24 - week study period ( table 2 ) .

discussion the present study demonstrated high adherence rates with low variations between the three visits .
the percentage of discarded canisters , which had more than 30 % of the labeled dosage of medication remaining , reduced from 22 % in our previous cross - sectional study 6 to 11 % in this study .
achieving good adherence in this cohort could be explained by the hawthorn effect : the parents and participants knew that their adherence would be measured by weighing the canisters ; therefore , the individuals modified or improved their adherence in response to the awareness of being observed .
approximately 90 % of the participants had no asthma exacerbation throughout the study period .
in our previous study , only 59 % of the patients had adequate control 6 .
patients had access to the same educational and medication intervention , but the adherence rates were significantly different .
previous studies verified that the adherence rates had an association between lower adherence rates and poor asthma control 7 , 8 .
although weighing of canisters was less accurate than a dose counter for measuring adherence 9 , the present study demonstrated that a weight - remaining dose correlation could be used to determine the inhaler medication adherence in real life , and intensive monitoring of adherence was successful in achieving control .
in conclusion , our results demonstrated that high adherence rates were achieved after integration of canister weighing into the asthma care service .
the present study highlighted the need to incorporate a method to monitor medical adherence in clinical practice , which may contribute to adequate asthma control .

9 8 2017 version 1recommendationapprove the authors tried to use canister weight to calculate the number of doses actuated from the mdis and to assess medical adherence to mdis .
there are some issues which need clarification please clarify why the numbers of collected mdi canisters were not the same in each visit .
please mentioned about patients who had exacerbation. were they the same patients ? were these patients nonadherence to medication or did they have any specific problem ?
i have read this submission .
i believe that i have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard .

24 4 2017 version 1recommendationapprove - with - reservations this study evaluated adherence to ics prophylaxis in asthmatic children by using weight of canister as a means to determine inhaler compliance , by calculating doses used by using a regression equation based on canister weight .
the authors conclude that in the absence of an inbuilt dose counter , weighing the canister was a useful means of improving adherence to daily treatment with ics .
detailed comments : there were 52 children participating in the study .
however , with each follow up visit ( n = 3 ) the number of canisters measure reduced progressively ( 44 , 33 , 23 ). was there loss to follow up or did these patients fail to return their canisters ?
could these patients be used as their comparative group in terms of asthma control over the period of follow up ?
for the subjects with the 11 canisters that had remaining medication , was their asthma control affected by non compliance ?
it may be more appropriate to use the term ' used ' rather than ' discarded ' canisters .
under the paragraph : adherence assessment .
some editing of sentences may improve readability : parents were asked to ' return ' the ' used inhalers at the 8 week .... .
' the weight of the canister was replaced in the regression equation ' to " the number of remaining doses of remaining doses was extrapolated by using the weight of the used mdi canisters into the regression equation as shown :....... .

21 4 2017 version 1recommendationapprove the article is well written .
however , there is some minor comment .
1. the authors mentioned that " the metered - dose inhalers ( mdis ) currently available for inhaled corticosteroid delivery do not offer an integrated dose counter " .
this statement was true at the time when this study was performed .
but currently , there are some mdis that have dose counter .
so this statement needs some amendment .
2. method : the authors mentioned that " participants needed to participate in a regular schedule every 8 weeks to obtain a new flixotide ( r ) 125 inhaler. " and the duration of treatment was 24 weeks .
so it means that each participant would receive 3 inhalers .
a total of 52 children was participated .
so i wonder why only 100 mdi canister was evaluated .
it should be 52 * 3 = 156 ? .
this may need the clarification .
i have read this submission .

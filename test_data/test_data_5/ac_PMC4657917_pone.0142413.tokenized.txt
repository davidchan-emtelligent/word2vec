reward processing has been implicated in developmental disorders .
however , the classic task to probe reward anticipation , the monetary incentive delay task , has an abstract coding of reward and no storyline and may therefore be less appropriate for use with developmental populations .
we modified the task to create a version appropriate for use with children .
we investigated whether this child - friendly version could elicit ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation in typically developing children and young adolescents ( aged 9.5 - 14.5 ) .
in addition , we tested whether our performance - based measure of reward sensitivity was associated with anticipatory activity in ventral striatum .
reward anticipation was related to activity in bilateral ventral striatum .
moreover , we found an association between individual reward sensitivity and activity in ventral striatum .
we conclude that this task assesses ventral striatal activity in a child - friendly paradigm .
the combination with a performance - based measure of reward sensitivity potentially makes the task a powerful tool for developmental imaging studies of reward processing .

introduction reward processing , and reward anticipation in particular , have been implicated in child and adolescent disorders such as attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( adhd ) [ 1 ] , oppositional defiant disorder ( odd ) [ 2 ] and depression [ 3 ] .
functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) studies have addressed reward anticipation using the monetary incentive delay ( mid ) paradigm [ 4 ] .
in this paradigm , a cue is presented at the beginning of each trial , signaling the amount of monetary reward that can be won ( or lost ) on the upcoming trial. by contrasting trials with different monetary cues , brain activation related to reward anticipation can be assessed [ 4 ] .
in adults , the mid paradigm has been shown to reliably activate ventral striatum in anticipation of reward ( e.g. [ 5,6 ]) .
yet the symbols used in the task are highly abstract and there is no storyline .
accordingly , it has not often been used successfully with younger children and in particular those with developmental disorders .
we designed a child - friendly version of the task to be compatible with an fmri environment [ 7 ] .
we focused on making the task more engaging , as sustained attention is not yet fully developed at school age , and can be particularly challenging for children with developmental disorders .
furthermore , we used response times to develop a measure of performance that captures individual reward sensitivity , but does so in a manner that is independent of intra - individual variability in response times .
this is important as intra - individual variability in response times is often increased in developmental disorders and can confound statistical inferences [ 7,8 ] .
the inclusion of a performance measure of reward sensitivity is essential to the interpretation of changes in activity of ventral striatum and can aid the generalization of results to a real life construct of reward sensitivity .
other studies that successfully modified the mid task to be more suitable for use with children have reported on task performance , but have not considered the relationship between task performance and brain activation in the interpretation of their results [ 9,10 ] .
in the mid task , faster reaction times signify better performance , as participants are instructed to press a button as fast as possible following a cue .
accordingly , the anticipation of greater reward may elicit faster reaction times [ 11 ] .
nevertheless , the effect of performance on brain activation has rarely been studied in the context of this task .
this is likely related to the typical implementation of a staircase procedure in this task , designed to keep accuracy constant at a predetermined level ( usually 60 - 70 %) for all participants .
task performance then appears equal across participants .
however , within individual participants , task performance ( as expressed by mean reaction times , accuracy scores or both ) may still differ across incentive conditions .
such a difference across incentive conditions may vary between participants and could therefore be operationalized as a behavioral measure of individual reward sensitivity .
following this rationale , we devised our measure of individual reward sensitivity by comparing rank - ordered reaction times across incentive conditions [ 7 ] .
in previous studies , we have used our child - friendly version of the mid - task to show that participants with adhd had lower behavioral sensitivity to reward compared to typically developing controls [ 7,8 ] .
in this pilot - study , we set out to validate our child - friendly , modified mid task for use as a developmental fmri paradigm .
first , we tested whether it could elicit ventral striatal activation during the anticipation of reward in typically developing children and young adolescents .
second , we hypothesized that our individual measure of reward sensitivity should be associated with activity in ventral striatum .
if so , future studies could use such a performance measure in the interpretation of their neuroimaging results .
methods participants a total of 18 right - handed children and young adolescents were recruited through schools in the wider utrecht area .
after screening for data quality ( for details see s1 text ) two participants were excluded from further analyses due to anatomical abnormalities and three participants were excluded due to excessive motion during acquisition of the fmri data .
data from six male and seven female participants , with an average age of 12.2 years ( range : 9.5 - 14.5 ) and average iq of 116 , were available for fmri analyses ( see table 1 ) .
the parents of participants reported no psychiatric diagnoses on the disc - iv interview [ 12 ] .
after the study procedures had been explained , all parents and adolescents ( aged 12 and older ) gave full written consent , while children provided verbal assent .
the study and its procedures were approved by the medical ethical review board of the university medical center utrecht ( approval number : 08 - 081 ) .

monetary incentive delay paradigm we used a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task [ 7 ] in a rapid event - related fmri design .
the task was made more engaging for use in children by adding a two - choice response selection aspect to the task .
trial sequence was as follows : first , the cue , a picture of a wallet with 0 , 5 or 15 cents was shown ( 2000 ms ) , indicating the amount of money that could be won on the upcoming trial .
next , pictures of two popular cartoon figures ( spongebob and patrick star from the spongebob tv - series ) were shown ( 750 ms ) and participants were to guess which cartoon figure was hiding the wallet by pressing either the left or the right response button .
they were instructed to respond as fast as possible .
subsequently , a black screen was shown ( 500 ms ) and finally , a thumbs - up or a thumbs - down picture , indicating a correct or incorrect choice , was shown ( 750 ms ) along with the total amount of money won so far .
the task was rigged in such a way that outcome of each trial was fixed ; the choices made did not affect reward outcome .
if participants did not respond within a 1250 milliseconds timeframe after the appearance of spongebob and patrick star , the feedback text " too late !" was presented .
the task consisted of 240 four - second trials ( 80 trials per cue ) divided evenly into four blocks and consequently took four minutes per block to complete .
each block had a fixed reward frequency of either 20 % ( low reward ) or 80 % ( high reward ) .
participants were randomly presented with one out of two counterbalanced reward sequences (' high - low - high - low ' or ' low - high - low - high ') , so that average reward frequency totaled 50 % for the full task .
for a schematic overview of task design see s1 fig. performance measures the primary neuropsychological outcome measure was the shift in reaction time distribution between rewarded and unrewarded trials .
this was quantified using linear regression of the rank ordered reaction times to high rewarded trials ( 15 cents ) on the rank ordered reaction times to unrewarded trials ( 0 cents ) , as described previously [ 7 ] .
we chose this measure as it is minimally influenced by differences in reaction - time variability , which is an important consideration in studying developmental disorders such as adhd , where intra - individual variability in reaction times is greater than in typical development [ 13 ] .
a regression coefficient smaller than one indicates faster responses time on rewarded then on unrewarded trials .
fmri acquisition the study was run on a 3.0 t achieva mri scanner ( philips medical systems , best , the netherlands ) using an eight - channel sensitivity - encoding ( sense ) parallel imaging head coil .
for anatomical reference , a whole - brain three - dimensional fast field echo t1 - weighted scan ( 200 slices ; repetition time = 10 ms ; echo time = 4.6 ms ; flip angle = 8degrees ; field of view , 240 x 240 x 160 mm ; voxel size : 0.75 x 0.8 x 0.75 mm isotropic ) was acquired .
whole - brain t2 * - weighted echo planar images ( epi ) with blood - oxygen level - dependent ( bold ) contrast ( 4 sessions ; 126 volumes per session ; 33 slices per volume ; interleaved acquisition ; tr = 2.00 s ; te = 35 ms ; field of view = 240 x 240 x 116 mm ; flip angle = 70degrees ; voxel size = 3.0 x 3.0 x 3.5mm ) oriented in a transverse plane were acquired .
we acquired six dummy scans to allow for t1 equilibration effects .
preprocessing of fmri data fmri data were analyzed using spm8 ( r4290 ) ( http :// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk / spm / software / spm8 ) as implemented in matlab 7.12 ( mathworks inc. , natick , ma , usa ) .
to correct for between - scan head motion , all images were realigned to the first volume using rigid body transformations , and subsequently resliced .
next , the data were temporally interpolated to the middle slice to adjust for time differences due to multislice image acquisition ( i.e. , slice time correction ) .
the anatomical image was co - registered to the first fmri image using the mutual information criteria method and subsequently normalized to montreal neurological institute ( mni ) space using unified segmentation , finally the image was resliced at a voxel size of 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0mm .
functional images were normalized using the normalization parameters generated in this step , the images were resliced at a voxel size of 3.0 x 3.0 x 3.0mm .
finally , the fmri images were spatially smoothed with a gaussian kernel with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 8 mm. in addition , scan - to - scan movement was assessed using artrepair [ 14 ] .
scans with more than 0.5 mm scan - to - scan movement or more than 1.5 % deviation from the average global signal , were replaced using a linear interpolation of the values of neighboring scans .
participants with more than 15 % corrected scans were excluded from further analyses ( for details , see s1 text ) .
statistical analyses - - performance after testing for normality ( shapiro - wilk test ) and sphericity ( mauchly 's test ) , a repeated measures analysis of variance ( anova ) was conducted to test for the effect of incentive magnitude on mean reaction time .
next , we tested for an effect of age on the shift in reaction time distribution using single - factor ancova .
statistical analyses - - fmri statistical analyses were performed within the framework of the general linear model following a two - level procedure [ 15 ] .
first level analysis involved the modeling of blood oxygenation level dependent ( bold ) activation invoked by 0 , 5 and 15 cents cues as conditions of interest , and realignment parameters as potential confounders ( condition of no interest ) for each subject .
regressors were created by convolving delta functions coding for cue onset with a canonical hemodynamic response function ( as implemented in spm8 ) for each cueing category separately .
the estimated regression coefficients for the 0 , 5 and 15 cents condition were then contrasted resulting in three first - level contrast images for each subject : 0 versus 5 , 0 versus 15 and 5 versus 15 cents .
data were high - pass filtered using discrete cosine basis functions with a 128 second cut - off .
at the group level we conducted two analyses .
first , we tested for brain activation related to the anticipation of reward by conducting one - sample t - tests on the contrast images of the three different contrasts separately .
we corrected for multiple comparisons using a family wise error ( fwe ) correction on a predefined volume of interest ( voi ) ( i.e. , small volume correction ) .
this voi was generated by combining the bilateral nucleus accumbens masks provided by the wfu pickatlas toolbox [ 16 ] and dilating the resulting mask by one voxel in all dimensions ( size of voi : 151 voxels , 4077 mm3 ) .
next , we tested for associations between reward - related brain activation and both task performance and age .
we conducted six separate single - factor ancovas , using the three first - level contrasts as dependent variables and the measure of task performance ( the regression coefficient of rank ordered reaction times for the greatest contrast , 0 versus 15 cents ; b0vs15ct ) , and age as separate continuous predictors ( i.e. , covariate of interest ) .
again we applied fwe correction for multiple comparisons restricted to the bilateral ventral striatum .
when anticipatory ventral striatal activity was found , we additionally tested for an effect of reward frequency on brain activation by contrasting activity in blocks with high ( 80 %) and low ( 20 %) reward frequency ( for the contrast in question ) .
this was done using a one - sample t - test on a newly created contrast image , again we corrected for multiple comparisons using fwe in the same voi .
results task tolerability 18 subjects participated in an fmri session and performed the task without problem .
data for five subjects had to be excluded from the analyses due to anatomical abnormalities on the t1 - weighted scan or motion during fmri - scanning .
they did not differ in terms of age , gender or iq from the 13 subjects for whom fmri data were available for analysis .
behavioral data there was an effect of reward magnitude on mean reaction times ( f ( 2,24 ) = 4.41,p = 0.023 ) .
average reaction times were 424 ms , 408 ms and 405 ms across respectively no reward , low reward and high reward conditions .
the mean b0vs15ct ( the shift in reaction time distribution between high reward and no reward ) was 0.89 ( sd 0.31 ) , indicating faster responses on high reward then on no reward trials .
there was no effect of age on the shift in reaction time distribution .
fmri data the first analysis aimed to test whether the mid task would elicit ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation .
we contrasted the anticipation of 0 versus 5 cents , 5 versus 15 cents , and 0 versus 15 cents , separately .
we found reward - related activation in the bilateral ventral striatum for the 0 versus 5 cents contrast ( see table 2 ) , but not for the two other contrasts ( 5 versus 15 cents and 0 versus 15 cents ) .
next , we tested for a relationship between task performance and reward - related activity in ventral striatum by conducting a single - factor ancova with the shift in reaction time distribution between high reward and no reward trials ( b0vs15ct ) as a continuous predictor .
we found an association in bilateral ventral striatum for both the 5 versus 15 and the 0 versus 15 cents contrast ( see fig 1 ) , but not for the 0 versus 5 cents contrast .
we found no effect of reward frequency or age on anticipatory activity in ventral striatum .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142413.g001 fig 1 ventral striatal activity is related to task performance .
there was a positive correlation between activation in ventral striatum and the shift in reaction time distribution ( b0vs15ct ) ( fwe corrected for multiple comparisons ) .

discussion we set out to validate our child - friendly , modified mid paradigm as a task appropriate for use in developmental fmri studies .
the task successfully elicited activity in ventral striatum during the anticipation of reward .
furthermore , our task - based measure of reward sensitivity was associated with striatal activity during reward anticipation .
the task was well tolerated by all subjects .
in all , we conclude that this task has potential as a tool for assessing reward anticipation in developmental populations .
we found that the task was well tolerated by all subjects : children and young adolescents , ranging in age from nine to fourteen years , were able to comprehend and complete the modified mid - task in a scanner environment .
in previous studies we have shown that children as young as six years old were able to comprehend and complete the task outside of the scanner [ 7,8 ] .
the task successfully elicited activity in ventral striatum during the anticipation of reward .
furthermore , we found that a task - based measure of reward sensitivity correlated positively with striatal activation during reward anticipation .
this suggests that anticipatory activity in striatum may be interpreted as a neurobiological measure of reward sensitivity in the context of this task .
such a direct interpretation of results is likely to be crucial in linking fmri findings to real - world reward sensitivity , as assessed by differences in approach behavior .
to date , results from studies reporting response - time differences across incentive conditions have been mixed [ 4,9,17 - 20 ] and when found , their relationship to brain activation has not previously been explored [ 17,19,20 ] .
a study by lamm and colleagues did report a relationship between task performance and brain activation in an mid paradigm , yet they only included performance as a nuisance variable [ 21 ] .
in this way the potential value of task performance in the interpretation of fmri results is left unexploited .
as in previous studies with adults [ 5,6 ] , we found ventral striatal activation when contrasting no reward cues to low reward cues .
however , we found no differences in activation when contrasting low reward cues to high reward cues .
stoppel and colleagues [ 22 ] have suggested that the effect of contrasting low reward to high reward is smaller than that between no reward and low reward , as the former contrast only probes reward magnitude and not reward itself .
in addition , developmental studies using overlapping age - ranges ( 12 - 18 years ) have reported reduced striatal engagement [ 17,21 ] and decreased discrimination between reward magnitudes [ 21 ] .
as such , the difference between the anticipation of low and high reward may have been too subtle to elicit significant differences in brain activity , particularly given our relatively modest sample size .
likewise , the absence of an effect of age on anticipatory ventral striatal activity may be a result of limited power .
furthermore , we only found an association between reward sensitivity and activity in ventral striatum for the contrast of high versus either low or no reward , but not for the contrast of low versus no reward .
this may be related to increased inter - individual variability in striatal activation in high reward conditions , associated with individual differences in overall task performance .
this increased variability may explain the lack of activation in the 0 versus 15 cents contrasts .
following this rationale , anticipatory striatal activation is more likely to be linked to a neuropsychological construct of reward sensitivity under high reward , than under low reward conditions .
to conclude , we show that a child - friendly version of the mid - task elicited activity in ventral striatum during the anticipation of reward in children and young adolescents .
furthermore , this striatal activation was related to inter - individual differences in a task - based measure of reward sensitivity .
in all , this task assesses ventral striatal activity in a child - friendly manner .
the combination with an individual task - based measure of reward sensitivity makes the task a potentially powerful tool for developmental imaging studies of reward processing .
limitations first , the sample size of this pilot study was modest .
this was in part caused by the exclusion of five datasets due to high subject motion or anatomical abnormalities ( for details see s1 text ) .
as a result , any negative findings in this study should be interpreted with caution .
in particular , tests to be expected to have a modest effect size ( e.g. the manipulation of reward frequency ) would be vulnerable to type ii errors .
second , an important distinction between this version of the task and the classical mid is that participants had no control over their results ( although they would be expected to have experienced control ) .
this could have affected our results , as a recent study by lorenz and colleagues [ 23 ] showed that subjective lack of control can attenuate ventral striatal activity .
third , it should be mentioned that the task was set up to have optimal statistical power with as many as 80 trials per condition .
however , this led to a total time - on - task of 16 minutes , which may also have taxed sustained attention .
finally , the participants in our sample had above average iq , necessitating prudence when interpolating findings to participants with an average iq. supporting information s1 fig task design .
a schematic overview of task design is shown .
panel a shows the time course of a single trial .

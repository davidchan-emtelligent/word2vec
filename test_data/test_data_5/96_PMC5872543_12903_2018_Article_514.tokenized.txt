background dental caries is the world 's most prevalent childhood disease .
school - based caries prevention can reduce the risk of childhood caries by increasing access to care .
however , the optimal mix of treatment services , intensity , and frequency of care is unknown .
methods data were derived from two prospective cohorts of us children participating in two caries prevention programs with different treatment intensities .
one program provided primary and secondary prevention ( glass ionomer sealants and interim therapeutic restorations ) and one primary prevention only ( glass ionomer sealants ) , both given twice yearly in six - month intervals .
primary study outcomes included untreated decay and the total observed caries experience .
analysis used generalized additive models to estimate nonlinear effects and trends over time .
results were compared to those estimated using generalized estimating equations and mixed - effects multilevel poisson regression .
results primary and secondary prevention combined did not significantly reduce total caries experience compared to primary prevention alone , but did reduce the risk of untreated decay on permanent dentition .
additionally , the rate of new caries experience was slower in the primary and secondary prevention group .
nonlinear trends for dental caries across both programs were statistically significant from zero ( p < . 001 ) .
conclusion caries prevention consisting of primary and secondary prevention agents may be more effective than primary prevention alone in reducing the risk of tooth decay over time .
results suggest that the impact of caries prevention may not be constant over the medium - and long - term , suggesting reduced effectiveness with continued treatments .
keywords oral health caries prevention comparative effectiveness http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 100000072national institute of dental and craniofacial research1r03de025289 ruff ryan richard issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background dental caries is the world 's most prevalent childhood disease [ 1 ] , accounts for 3.5 million disability - adjusted life years [ 2 ] , and affects nearly 30 % of school - age children and 50 % of rural , minority , or medicaid recipient children in the united states [ 3 , 4 ] .
caries prevention programs such as one - chair services , mobile dental vans , and school - based health programs or dental centers can be used to reduce the risk of tooth decay [ 5 ] .
these school - based programs improve access to dental services in medically underserved areas , and often serve as the sole source of dental care for children [ 5 ] .
based on evidence from multiple systematic reviews , the american dental association supports the use of school - based programs that apply dental sealants to sound surfaces and noncavitated lesions to reduce dental caries in children [ 6 , 7 ] .
the comparative effectiveness of caries prevention delivery models has been identified as one of the highest research priorities by the institute of medicine [ 8 ] .
importantly , there is considerable variability both within and across caries prevention programs , such as the types of preventive services that are provided and the timing , frequency , and intensity of care .
thus , questions remain as to the effectiveness of caries prevention , such as how much prevention is needed , with what frequency , or whether secondary prevention methods ( e.g. , interim therapeutic restorations , silver diamine fluoride ) are more effective when combined with primary prevention ( e.g. , varnish and sealants ) , compared to primary prevention alone .
additionally , research on the long - term impact ( e.g. , at least one or two years of follow - up ) of school - based caries prevention programs is largely limited to prevention consisting of fluoride or sealants [ 6 , 9 - 11 ] .
further research is therefore needed to identify the optimal mix of services and implementation strategies that can be used to effectively treat childhood caries .
in this study , we compared two caries prevention programs with identical frequency of care but different treatment agents .
we explored the long term , nonlinear trends in untreated decay and total caries experience within program over time .
we hypothesized that increased intensity of care , defined as primary and secondary prevention combined , would result in greater reduction in untreated tooth decay and that effects across both programs would be nonlinear over time .
results from this research can begin to inform best practices in program design and implementation and lead to a more robust , effective caries prevention program .
methods design and population data were derived from two prospective open cohorts of primary school - aged children receiving school - based caries prevention in urban and rural elementary schools in the northwestern and central united states from 2004 to 2014 .
these populations were chosen as they are characterized by low - income children who typically lack adequate access to preventive dental care .
many of the participating children did not have community water fluoridation .
all participating schools were designated as title 1 , as over half of enrolled students qualified to receive reduced price meals .
all children were eligible for the study regardless of age , gender , race , or socioeconomic status .
in each year of the program , students in participating schools were provided informed consent .
children who had completed informed consent were followed longitudinally and treated twice yearly with caries prevention for as long as they were enrolled in the school .
children in the northwestern us cohort received primary and secondary prevention , and children in the central us cohort received primary prevention only .
visits for each participant were numbered sequentially regardless of the time that had elapsed between visits .
subjects were included in analysis only if they were between the ages of 5 and 12 .
overall , there were 46 participating schools .
interventions the first cohort (" unexposed ") included participants from a traditional school - based sealant program .
the second cohort (" exposed ") received both primary and secondary prevention .
participants in the unexposed group received a twice - yearly dental evaluation conducted by a dental hygienist , oral hygiene instruction ( mirror , toothbrush , toothpaste , and floss ) , prophy , fluoride varnish , and glass ionomer sealants placed on permanent first and second molars .
participants in the exposed group received all preventive interventions given to controls with the addition of sealants placed on all teeth and glass ionomer interim therapeutic restorations ( itrs ) placed on all asymptomatic teeth with carious lesions .
data collection , calibration , and standardization at each observation for each participant , examining dentists dried tooth surfaces with gauze squares and performed clinical visual - tactile full - mouth oral examinations , including examination of all teeth and tooth surfaces for decayed , missing , filled , sound , or pulpal involvement .
the exam also included an assessment of pain , swelling , infection , and abscess .
dental hygienists delivered all services with the exception of clinical oral exams , which were given by a licensed dentist .
each examiner recorded clinical data using a proprietary tablet - based software which was then securely uploaded to a data coordinating center for cleaning and quality control .
for calibration , data collectors examined ten students independently at baseline and discussed whether caries were present or not .
following this review , data collectors were calibrated by examining another ten students independently and comparing results ( kappa = 0.75 ) .
to standardized delivery of care , hygienists were trained to use fuji ix glass ionomer in capsules prior to participating in the program .
following the start of the program , dentists and hygienists were standardized each year but not calibrated .
outcomes outcome measures included the prevalence of untreated decay on permanent dentition and the total observed caries experience ( toce ) .
untreated decay was calculated as any permanent tooth or tooth surface with any untreated carious lesion and analyzed at the person - level .
toce was calculated as the sum of all decayed or filled teeth observed over the course of the study , regardless of exfoliation .
for example , if a child presented at the first follow - up visit with a cavity on a single tooth , their toce score would be one .
if at the second follow - up visit , the child presented with a different tooth having a cavity , and the previously observed tooth is either cavitated , missing , or filled , their toce score would be two .
previously observed teeth with decay or fillings that were later exfoliated are carried forward and contribute to the overall toce score .
in this way , toce reflects the total number of teeth ever observed with decay over the course of the study .
toce is useful in the analysis of longitudinal caries prevention data , and is preferred to more common measures , as the toce score does not decrease due to tooth exfoliation [ 12 ] .
other tooth indices are potentially biased due to decreases over time from the exfoliation of previously decayed teeth , a decrease that would be mistakenly attributed as a treatment effect .
statistical analysis primary analysis used generalized additive models ( gams ) to assess decay prevalence and toce scores .
notably , there is little research on the long - term effects of itrs , especially when compared to standard school - based sealant programs .
as such , it is not clear if the effects of primary and / or secondary prevention are consistently linear as children age .
gams are therefore useful in the analysis of longitudinal caries data because of their flexibility in modeling nonlinear effects .
gams were used to estimate smoothed coefficients for treatment effects over time .
to obtain parametric estimates for covariates included as smoothed terms in additive models , identical models were run using generalized estimating equations ( untreated decay ) and multilevel poisson regression ( toce ) .
decay prevalence was modeled as a binomially distributed variable , yi ~ bin ( pii ) , using a logit link function , and toce scores were modeled using a poisson family with a log link function .
models for both outcomes included smoothed terms , specified for untreated decay as \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ logit \ left ({\ pi }_ i \ right )=\ ln \ left (\ frac {\ pi _ i }{ 1 - {\ pi }_ i }\ right )=\ theta \ boldsymbol { t }+{ s }_ 1 \ left ({ x }_{ 1i },\ ast z \ right )+{ s }_ 2 \ left ({ x }_{ 2i }\ right )+\ beta ( z ) $$\ end { document } logitpii = lnpii1 - pii = thetat + s1x1i * z + s2x2i + betaz , where pii is the probability of decay , xi is time , t is a vector of linear covariates and theta their corresponding beta coefficients , s1 is a smoothing term for the number of preventive treatments received , and s2 is a smoothed term for the participants' age at the time of examination .
effectiveness of prevention with itrs versus sealants only was assessed using a dummy variable for exposure group ( z ) and a nonlinear treatment / time interaction .
smoothing terms were estimated using cubic regression splines .
covariates included baseline toce scores , gender , whether the participant had access to fluoridated water , and receipt of previous dental care , determined by children presenting with new fillings or restorations at any observation that were not placed in previous preventive treatments .
for each outcome in gam analyses , a series of models were specified that included no smoothing terms , smoothers for time , smoothers for age at examination , and smoothers for the treatment / time interaction .
the upper limit for degrees of freedom associated with smoothed terms was set at five .
the degree of nonlinearity for smoothed coefficients was assessed using the effective degrees of freedom ( edf ) , with greater departures from linearity evidenced by edf coefficients being different from one .
the comparative fit of nested additive models was evaluated using deviance scores and compared to a chi2 distribution with df equal to the number of additional parameters in the non - nested model .
plots were produced for nonlinear trends within each treatment group for toce .
analysis was conducted in r v3.4.2 .
statistical significance was set at 0.05 .
this study received irb approval from the forsyth institute and the nyu school of medicine .
results the analytic sample ( n = 8207 ) consisted of 6584 participants in the cohort receiving primary and secondary prevention and 1623 participants in the primary prevention only group ( table 1 ) .
the average age of participants at baseline was equivalent across exposed ( 7.32 +/ - 1.71 ) and unexposed ( 7.39 +/ - 1.93 ) groups .
approximately 51 % of participants were male , and 60 % had evidence of receiving previous dental care .
overall , 32.7 % of participants had untreated decay on any dentition at baseline , and 9.2 % had untreated decay on any permanent tooth .
baseline untreated decay on permanent teeth was similar across exposed ( 9.3 %) and unexposed ( 8.7 %) groups .
however , the average total observed caries experience at baseline was larger in the exposed group ( 2.19 +/ - 2.83 ) compared to those unexposed ( 1.55 +/ - 2.13 ) .
thus , multivariable models further adjusted for baseline toce scores .
changes in toce and untreated decay by visit are shown in table 2 .

gender , previous dental care , and water fluoridation were not statistically associated with untreated decay .
the interaction between treatment and time was not significant and thus was not included in the final model .

parametric effects for age , exposure ( treatment ) , and visit ( non - smoothed ) are shown for standard gee ( adult decay ) and multilevel ( toce ) models for comparison purposes ( model 3a ) .
age , visit , exposure ( treatment ) , and the visit - treatment interaction were included in model 3b as smoothed terms in gams and do not have estimated parametric coefficients .
nonlinear effects for these terms in the generalized additive model are shown in table 4 toce total observed caries experience , gee generalized estimating equations , gam generalized additive models , irr incident rate ratio , or odds ratio the total number of observed decayed or filled teeth ( toce ) was not significantly different across exposure groups ( irr = 0.95 , 95 % ci = 0.88 , 1.04 ) in adjusted models ( table 3a ) , and linear trends in toce indicated a significant increase in total observed caries over time ( irr = 1.20 , 95 % ci = 1.19 , 1.23 ) .
however , the interaction between treatment and time was statistically significant ( irr = 0.96 , 95 % ci = 0.94 , 0.98 ) , indicating that the rate of toce increase slowed over time for participants receiving primary and secondary prevention compared to participants receiving primary prevention alone .
while no differences in toce were found by gender , previous dental care and water fluoridation were both associated with an increased rate of new decayed or filled teeth .
the fully adjusted model for toce accounted for 63 % of the deviance .
estimates for covariates not included as smoothed parameters in generalized additive models were similar in magnitude and significance to those from gee and multilevel models ( table 3b ) .
nonlinear effects ( table 4 ) for toce over time as measured by the effective degrees of freedom from additive models were 3.46 and 2.30 for exposed and unexposed groups , respectively .
for untreated decay , effects were 1.12 and 1.00 for exposed and unexposed groups , close to a linear trend .
nonlinear coefficients by group were all statistically significant despite minimal departures from linearity for untreated decay .

however , designing a program with the optimum mix of treatments and frequency of care requires additional research .
while the interventions commonly used in school - based prevention are efficacious in clinical trials for preventing caries , evidence of effectiveness in community - based settings is largely limited to sealants or fluoride or is restricted in follow - up time [ 6 , 13 - 17 ] .
in this study , we sought to compare primary versus secondary prevention agents and explore trends in decay risk in primary school - aged children .
overall , school - based caries prevention across programs was associated with a reduced risk of untreated decay in permanent teeth over time , and a prevention program with higher treatment intensity was associated with a significantly lower risk of untreated decay .
specifically , children receiving prevention that included interim therapeutic restorations and sealants on all teeth had a lower risk of untreated decay in permanent dentition compared to prevention with sealants placed on only the first and second molars .
while toce increased over time across groups , the rate of new carious teeth over time was lower for participants receiving primary and secondary prevention .
nonlinear trends over time by group were also statistically significant .
this study included a large sample of us primary - school aged children ( aged 5 - 12 years ) from the northeastern and central united states and analysis controlled for baseline toce scores , gender , evidence of previous dental care , and water fluoridation .
though data were not available on race / ethnicity and socioeconomic status , all participants were enrolled in title - 1 schools , determined by having a large majority of enrolled students receiving free and reduced - price lunch .
additionally , there were no differences between groups in baseline untreated decay .
thus , it is not believed that observed treatment effects are due to imbalances in ses or other unobserved covariates .
further , a key feature of school - based caries prevention is the large - scale effectiveness for high - risk children with limited access to dental care .
for study participants in both cohorts , dental access outside of the study was minimal .
the findings from this study may be generalizable to other high - risk , low - income primary school populations .
in this study , there were no differences in overall toce comparing children receiving sealants and itrs versus sealants alone .
this finding is similar to the existing itr literature .
for example , a five - year study of early childhood caries in india showed that the use of itrs in combination with fluoride varnish and sealants did not significantly decrease the incidence of new caries [ 18 ] .
however , this prior study also found no impact on the prevalence of untreated decay , which is in contrast to the presented results .
notably , as interim therapeutic restorations are considered secondary prevention , they are only placed on erupted carious lesions .
thus , cavitated teeth or tooth surfaces treated with itrs should show a potential decrease in untreated decay over time , but would still contribute to overall toce scores .
while results show an overall significant increasing trend in toce over time across groups , the rate was significantly lower in the exposure group compared to those unexposed .
interim restorations have been previously shown to reduce the levels of cariogenic oral bacteria , potentially preventing the progression of decay and lowering the rate of additional caries on adjacent teeth due to increases in unchecked bacteria [ 19 ] .
thus , the survival rate of itrs may reduce untreated decay in school - aged children , particularly those without regular access to dental care , and help in preventing new caries .
although the decreased rate of toce in those receiving primary and secondary prevention was small ( as evidenced by both model results and the similarities in trends over time in associated figures ) , toce scores were calculated using data from all teeth and tooth surfaces .
itrs may be even more effective at reducing the subsequent risk of decay on teeth that are adjacent to the tooth that was recently restored .
future research should isolate teeth that are proximal to those with applied itrs to investigate this hypothesis further .
nonlinear effects for toce indicated a cubic trend for prevention that included sealants and itrs , and a quadratic trend for prevention consisting of sealants only .
effects for untreated decay indicated an approximately linear trend for both groups .
however , despite the significant nonlinear effects , plots of toce by group over time suggest that a linear trend in dental caries may be sufficient for program planning over the short or medium - term .
importantly , the significance of smoothed terms was determined using chi2 tests .
thus , the large sample size in this study could result in significant differences for even small departures from linearity .
for the long - term effects of caries prevention , trends over time are expected to be nonlinear .
this study has a number of limitations .
despite the use of longitudinal data , analysis was limited by diminishing sample sizes at later observations and the number of available observational periods .
it has been shown that estimation of smoothed terms is difficult with longitudinal data that is characterized by limited observations [ 20 ] .
though this can be simplified by using fewer knots , this can lead to biased estimates [ 20 ] .
collecting more data , either by extending the length of follow - up or increasing the number of observations between treatments , could result in more robust estimation of trends over time .
this would also support the use of generalized additive mixed models , adding potential random effects for trend , treatments , and individual subjects to explore treatment effects in even greater detail [ 21 ] .
while this study was open to all students with completed informed consent , the overall participation rate was approximately 30 % .
thus , study participants may have different oral health needs than nonparticipants .
as study interventions were provided at the school level , children who move , graduate , change schools , or are otherwise lost to follow - up did not receive continued care .
as a result , true effects over extended time periods are unknown .
further , though estimates of exposures are believed to be robust , there may be residual confounding bias due to missing student - level socioeconomic status and race / ethnicity .
this is perhaps best demonstrated by the significant increase in toce for children with access to water fluoridation , which was unexpected .
finally , children in both cohorts were examined and treated biannually , resulting in interval censoring between visits .
while both cavitated and filled teeth were included in analysis , any tooth that may have developed decay and was subsequently lost in intervening periods would be unobserved .
conclusions this study evaluated the effectiveness of itr and sealants on untreated caries and the total observed caries experience , compared to sealants only .
results showed that itr plus sealants was associated with a decrease in untreated dental caries in permanent dentition and a slightly lower rate of total caries increase over time .
despite significant nonlinear coefficients across groups over time , visual inspection of plots of smoothed coefficients suggest a linear approximation for short or long - term prevention studies may be appropriate .
given the high variability in school - based caries prevention , comparing the effectiveness of different prevention agents , frequency , or intensity of care can lead to optimal program design .

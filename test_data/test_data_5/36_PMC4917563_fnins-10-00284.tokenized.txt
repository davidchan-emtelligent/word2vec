stroke patients with severe motor deficits cannot execute task - oriented rehabilitation exercises with their affected upper extremity .
advanced rehabilitation technology may support them in performing such reach - to - grasp movements .
the challenge is , however , to provide assistance as needed , while maintaining the participants' commitment during the exercises .
in this feasibility study , we introduced a closed - loop neuroprosthesis for reach - to - grasp assistance which combines adaptive multi - channel neuromuscular stimulation with a multi - joint arm exoskeleton .
eighteen severely affected chronic stroke patients were assisted by a gravity - compensating , seven - degree - of - freedom exoskeleton which was attached to the paretic arm for performing reach - to - grasp exercises resembling activities of daily living in a virtual environment .
during the exercises , adaptive electrical stimulation was applied to seven different muscles of the upper extremity in a performance - dependent way to enhance the task - oriented movement trajectory .
the stimulation intensity was individualized for each targeted muscle and remained subthreshold , i.e. , induced no overt support .
closed - loop neuromuscular stimulation could be well integrated into the exoskeleton - based training , and increased the task - related range of motion ( p = 0.0004 ) and movement velocity ( p = 0.015 ) , while preserving accuracy .
the highest relative stimulation intensity was required to facilitate the grasping function .
the facilitated range of motion correlated with the upper extremity fugl - meyer assessment score of the patients ( p = 0.028 ) .
combining adaptive multi - channel neuromuscular stimulation with antigravity assistance amplifies the residual motor capabilities of severely affected stroke patients during rehabilitation exercises and may thus provide a customized training environment for patient - tailored support while preserving the participants' engagement .
functional electrical stimulation robot - assisted rehabilitation feedback virtual reality individualized therapy hemiparesis upper - limb assistance hybrid assistance introduction the majority of stroke survivors remain dependent on others for activities of daily living due to a dysfunctional upper extremity ( jorgensen et al. , 1999 ; dobkin , 2005 ; feigin et al. , 2008 ) .
however , when clinically meaningful improvements are achieved , they correlate positively with the dose of therapy ( lohse et al. , 2014 ; pollock et al. , 2014 ) .
many studies , therefore , aimed to further increase the number of task - oriented exercises by applying assistive robotic technologies for stroke rehabilitation ; often resulting in improved arm / hand function and muscle strength , albeit respective trials have , as yet , provided only low - quality evidence ( mehrholz et al. , 2015 ) .
however , critical voices attribute technology - assisted improvements such as these to unspecific influences like increased enthusiasm for novel interventions on the part of both patients and therapists ( kwakkel and meskers , 2014 ) .
in the same vein , when compared to dose - matched conventional physiotherapy , robot - assisted training showed no clinically relevant , additional benefits in controlled trials ( lo et al. , 2010 ; klamroth - marganska et al. , 2014 ) .
this dilemma might be illustrated , for example , by the most advanced commercially available training system for the upper limb ; an active robotic exoskeleton with seven actuated axes ( i.e. , degrees of freedom ) that provides antigravity support for the paretic arm and enables patients with severe impairment to perform task - oriented movements ( klamroth - marganska et al. , 2014 ; kwakkel and meskers , 2014 ; brauchle et al. , 2015 ) .
this device provided slightly more functional gain for the participating stroke survivors , but was less effective in restoring arm strength than conventional therapy ( klamroth - marganska et al. , 2014 ) , probably because it was too supportive when providing assistance as needed during the exercises ( chase , 2014 ; brauchle et al. , 2015 ) .
in this context , neurophysiological parameters might constitute a means of preserving patient engagement and of avoiding under - challenge .
other studies applied surface electromyography to infer the person 's intention to perform a particular movement and used it as a control signal for robotic assistance ( maciejasz et al. , 2014 ) .
for severely impaired stroke patients , however , who might benefit most from robotic therapy ( klamroth - marganska et al. , 2014 ; brauchle et al. , 2015 ) , this physiological parameter might be inadequate due to paralysis and / or abnormally co - activated muscles ( wright et al. , 2014 ) .
novel robotic devices , therefore , move only when the brain is most responsive to the feedback by the multi - joint exoskeleton ( brauchle et al. , 2015 ) .
more specifically , patients control the rehabilitation robots with their brain signals - - i.e. , via motor imagery - related oscillations of the ipsilesional cortex - - within the framework of a brain - robot interface ( bri ) for stroke rehabilitation ( brauchle et al. , 2015 ) .
although , this technique makes it possible to successfully link three - dimensional robotic training to the participants' own effort , some findings also suggest that sustained brain self - regulation for brain - controlled robotic training is challenging and that it may even be characterized by a significant association with the experience of frustration for the participants ( fels et al. , 2015 ) .
this potential drawback of connecting rehabilitation exercises to physiological parameters might possibly be overcome , if the resources available for coping with the mental load , that occurs in conjunction with bri technology , are taken into consideration and when the task difficulty is adjusted accordingly ( naros and gharabaghi , 2015 ; bauer and gharabaghi , 2015a,b ; naros et al. , 2016a ) .
at the same time , however , a direct comparison of the perceived workload of bri tasks and classical rehabilitation exercises on the basis of voluntary muscle contraction suggested that the experience of frustration and over - challenge was task - independent , thus supporting the notion that the perceived workload was influenced by the characteristics of the individual subject ( fels et al. , 2015 ) .
accordingly , assistance as needed has to be individually adjusted during stroke rehabilitation and , if not used precisely , is constantly confronted with the dangers of both under - and over - challenge , no matter what assistive technology is applied .
however , current assisted approaches usually take an all - or - nothing approach , e.g. , by providing active robotic guidance to complete a movement as soon as the patient failed to reach the defined goal ( klamroth - marganska et al. , 2014 ) ; or by triggering functional electrical stimulation ( fes ) for overt muscle contraction as soon as a predefined physiological state ( recorded with emg or eeg ) is achieved ( howlett et al. , 2015 ) .
more targeted assistance might , therefore , be necessary during these rehabilitation exercises to maintain engagement without compromising the patients' motivation ; i.e. , providing support as little as possible and as much as necessary .
along these lines , we explored an alternative approach to classical assistive technology in this feasibility study .
instead of applying standard robot - guided rehabilitation or triggered fes , we minimized the robotic assistance to pure antigravity support while providing performance - dependent , neuromuscular electrical stimulation with subthreshold modulation of individual upper limb muscles .
notably , the robotic assistance was passive , and the electrical stimulation was non - functional , i.e. , elicited no overt movement .
we hypothesized , however , that this combined , closed - loop approach leads to a wider range of motion than any one of these assistive tools by itself .
methods eighteen stroke patients ( female / male : 6 / 12 ; right / left hemispheric stroke : 13 / 5 , ischemic / hemorrhagic : 13 / 5 ; mean age : 56 +/ - 9.8 [ 34 69 ] years ) in the chronic phase after stroke ( 78 +/ - 55.3 [ 8 244 ] months ) presented with a severe and persistent hemiparesis .
the modified upper extremity fugl - meyer - assessment score ( i.e. , mean motor ue - fma score without coordination , speed , and reflexes ; naros and gharabaghi , 2015 ) of our group of patients was 15.6 +/ - 4.9 [ 9 25 ] .
this study , which was approved by the ethical review committee of the local medical faculty , involved two sessions of reach - to - grasp training with a multi - joint exoskeleton attached to the paretic arm .
each session lasted approximately 30 min. and consisted of 150 trials .
the exoskeleton , virtual reality , and task design have been described in detail elsewhere ( grimm et al. , 2016 ) and are cited here .
exoskeleton and virtual reality we used a commercially available ( armeo spring , hocoma , volketswil , switzerland ) rehabilitation exoskeleton for shoulder , elbow and wrist joints with seven axes ( i.e. , degrees of freedom ) , providing antigravity support for the paretic arm and registration of movement kinematics and grip force .
the un - weighing was realized via two springs incorporated into the device .
this device could be used to make individual adjustments e.g. , of gravity compensation , thereby supporting patients with severe impairment in performing task - oriented practice within a motivating virtual environment .
we extended these features in - house by using the real - time sensor data of the exoskeleton to display a three - dimensional multi - joint visualization of the user 's arm in virtual reality .
this entailed capturing the angles of all arm joints and the grip force from a shared memory block using a file mapping communication protocol .
the virtual arm engine was programmed in a microsoft xna ( tm ) framework .
the arm model utilized by the engine was constructed as a meshed bone - skin combination with 54 bones ( 3ds max 2010 ( tm ) , autodesk ) .
the measured joint angles ( accuracy 0.1degrees ) and grip forces of the device were used to modify the bone - vectors of the meshed model according to the movements of the user , thereby providing online closed - loop feedback .
the joint angles of the exoskeleton were directly represented in virtual reality , whereas the grip forces were augmented to feedback natural hand function .
prior to each session , participants were instructed to perform a natural reach - to - grasp movement during the task by using distal ( elbow ) rather than proximal ( shoulder ) movements .
the three - dimensional visualization of the arm was then applied during each task as an implicit online feedback of the movement since explicit information can disrupt motor learning in stroke patients ( boyd and winstein , 2004 ; cirstea and levin , 2007 ) .
various virtual training paradigms were designed to allow for different rehabilitation exercises resembling activities of daily living .
task design in this study , participants performed self - paced , three - dimensional ( in x - , y - , and z - direction ) reach - to - grasp movements in virtual space .
patients could interact within the virtual space via the virtual arm representation described above .
the position of the virtual arm changed in real - time according to the patient 's arm position tracked by the orthosis .
the grasping and releasing of the virtual ball was performed by applying force to the grip sensor and opening the hand , respectively .
the relationship between the force applied to the grip sensor and the virtual movement was adjusted individually to each user .
after system setup , the exercise was presented on a screen in front of the patient .
this exercise consisted of a transfer movement , i.e. , a ball had to be grasped in virtual space and transferred to a basket .
the position of the ball and the basket in space and in relation to each other was randomly distributed in x - ( left to right / right to left ) , y - ( up to down / down to up ) , or z - direction ( front to back / back to front ) .
after presenting the objects in virtual space , the patients had to move the virtual hand toward the presented ball .
the movements were self - paced and no distinct timing was given .
after grasping the ball , three - dimensional transfer movements toward a basket were necessary , i.e. , the ball had to be grasped , carried to a distant basket and then released again .
the timing for this transfer movement was self - induced .
the virtual hand could interact with the ball as soon as it entered a defined range around the latter .
the ball changed its color according to the hand position ( white : out of range , green : possible to grasp , yellow : possible to transfer , red : possible to release ) .
after releasing the ball in the basket , the next exercise started by presenting the next ball randomly distributed in virtual space .
closed - loop neuromuscular stimulation we integrated a neuromuscular electrical stimulation device in the exoskeleton - based training environment ( rehastim , 8 - channel stimulator , hasomed gmbh , magdeburg , germany ) , and applied biphasic square impulses ( frequency : 30 hz , pulse width : 500 mus ) .
the stimulation intensity of this integrated neuroprosthesis was updated in a closed - loop , real - time iteration at 60 hz via a controller area network ( can )/ universal serial bus ( usb ) port using a custom - made algorithm .
this made it possible to stimulate seven different muscles / muscle groups relevant for reaching and grasping , while the output current was adapted continuously for each of them : m. extensor digitorum communis , m. flexor digitorum superficialis , m. biceps brachii , m. triceps brachii , m. pectoralis major , m. infraspinatus / m. teres minor ( i.e. , muscle group ) , m. deltoideus pars anterior .
in pairs of antagonist muscles / muscle groups , only one of them was stimulated at the same time ; i.e. , either m. extensor digitorum communis or m. flexor digitorum superficialis , either m. biceps brachii or m. triceps brachii , either m. pectoralis major or m. infraspinatus / m. teres minor .
this resulted - - together with the m. deltoideus pars anterior - - in up to four simultaneously stimulated , co - activated muscles / muscle groups ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 set - up of multi - channel neuromuscular stimulation integrated into a gravity - compensating , seven - degree - of - freedom exoskeleton .
according to a biomechanical movement model ( figure 2 ) on the basis of the vector positions of the virtual arm , the neuromuscular stimulation pattern and intensity was calculated ( figure 3 ) .

more specifically , the target vector and the estimated movement vector of each individual muscle group were calculated on the basis of the real - time arm position measured by the exoskeleton , while using the cosine similarity functions between the two vectors for weighting .
this function gives a maximum output of 1 when the target vector and the estimated movement vector of the corresponding muscle group are pointing in the same direction .
when the vectors point in opposite directions , the function would result in a negative output and is then set to zero , i.e. , resulting in no stimulation .
for positive outputs , i.e. , when target vector and estimated movement vector point in the same direction , the stimulation amplitudes are calculated by multiplying the weighting of the muscle vectors with a boltzmann - fitting of the time course of a ramping stimulation toward maximum stimulation strength ( equation 1 ) .
this stimulation began with a 2 s delay to avoid instability of the induced movement .

both the exoskeleton and the maximum stimulation intensity ( stimmax ) were individually calibrated : the exoskeleton was adjusted to provide optimized gravity compensation for every joint and to allow for goal - directed movements in three - dimensional space .
the gravity compensation was provided by a spring mechanism of the orthotic device , which was calibrated individually to balance the weight of the patient 's paretic arm .
thereby , the exoskeleton was adjusted to the corresponding functional anatomy of the participant before each session .
particularly , the shoulder position , forearm , and upper arm length were considered for the adjustments .
for calibration of the stimulation intensity , the different muscles / muscle groups where identified anatomically before applying the self - sticking fes electrodes ( han - sen gmbh , hamburg , germany ; 50 mm diameter and 50 x 80 mm ) .
the electrode positions were optimized by subsequent test stimulation .
since all participants suffered from severe upper limb impairment , prolonged supra - motor threshold stimulation was perceived as painful and ineffective and was therefore not applied .
the stimmax for each muscle group was empirically determined as the output current perceived as comfortable and approaching the motor threshold , but remaining still subthreshold .
the motor threshold was identified by a visible joint movement .
each muscle group was stimulated separately before the training session to determine the individual maximum stimulation strength .
outcome measures the kinematic assessment included movement smoothness , temporal efficiency , and range of motion ( volume ) .
movement smoothness was captured by calculating changes of movement direction along an optimal direct path toward the targets , by estimating the distance function between the hand - position and the final endpoint , and by calculating the second derivative of the function to determine the number of turning points for each task ( cirstea et al. , 2006 ) .
in order to avoid compensatory shoulder movements the stimulation patterns for shoulder and biceps activation were equally distributed for an inbound trajectory .
temporal efficiency was captured as the time required to complete each task , and as the mean and peak velocity of the hand between the targets while calculating their distance for x - , y - , and z - directions in virtual units ( vu ) .
the overall range of motion ( volume , vu3 ) was measured as the complete space covered during the exercises .
the range of sensor data from the grip - sensor was estimated as the mean change in grip pressure .
the range of shoulder , upper arm , and forearm movement was measured in degrees .
the maximum ( stimmax ) and mean stimulation amplitude ( in ma ) was calculated per channel , i.e. , muscle group .
in addition , we captured the stimulation period for different stimulation intensities , i.e. , < 25 % stimmax , 25 - 50 % stimmax , > 50 - 75 % stimmax , > 75 % stimmax .
statistics statistical analysis was performed on a matlab 2010b engine .
for paired data points a t - test for paired samples was performed .
the significance level was set at p = 0.0125 for all tests after conservative bonferroni correction .
correlation coefficients r and respective p - values were calculated between the overall range of motion and the ua - fma score .
results the three - dimensional reach - to - grasp exercises of this study could be completed only with the help of assistive technology .
none of the patients was able to complete grasping exercises in unsupported conditions , i.e. , they all scored 0 out of a possible 4 points in the related fma sub - scores (" grasp cylinder ," " grasp tennis ball ") .
however , neuromuscular stimulation alone was not sufficient in our severely impaired patient group , i.e. , none of the targeted muscles was stimulated in a functionally relevant way to allow for overt muscle contraction .
the patients were , therefore , unable to perform a reach - to - grasp movement per se , even when neuromuscular stimulation was applied .
instead , the multi - joint antigravity assistance was essential to facilitate the goal - oriented grasping exercises in the 3d - virtual environment and required commitment from the patients .
fifteen of the patients were able to complete all 150 trials in each session .
the amount of training had to be reduced for three patients , two of whom completed 75 trials and the third 50 trials in each session .
this resulted in a group mean of 135 trials (+/ - 32.2808 , [ 50 150 ]) .
the reach - to - grasp direction was randomly distributed ( x : 44.4 +/ - 12.1 vu , y : 45.1 +/ - 11.2 vu , z : 44.1 +/ - 12.6 vu ) .
closed - loop neuromuscular stimulation could be integrated well into the exoskeleton - based training ; this neuroprosthesis increased the task - related range of motion ( rom ) in 16 out of 18 participants as well as the mean rom of all patients ( p = 0.0004 ) .
more distant targets in the virtual training space were achieved in all three x - , y - , z - directions and the participants were able to perform longer transfer movements , i.e. , inter - target distances ( table 1 , figure 4 ) .

moreover , the movement range of the shoulder , upper arm , and forearm increased significantly in the neuroprosthesis condition , while the grip pressure showed a trend ( table 2 , figure 5 ) .
the range of motion correlated with the upper extremity fugl - meyer assessment score of the patients for both the antigravity orthosis ( r = 0.62 , p = 0.01 ) and the neuroprosthetic condition ( r = 0.58 , p = 0.028 ) .

the neuroprosthesis increased the movement velocity ( 3.8 vs. 3.5 vu / s , p = 0.015 ) with a trend toward a faster task completion ( 6.9 vs. 7.2 s , p = 0.02 ) while preserving the smoothness of the trajectory ( 9.3 vs. 9.31 , p = 0.46 ; figure 6 ) .
figure 6 comparison of paired plots for mean values of distance to target , velocity , time per task , and smoothness of trajectories with and without stimulation .
the stimulation was applied after the self - induced movements of the patients by adapting the intensity in accordance with the output of the dynamic biomechanical arm model and the estimated target vector for each targeted muscle group ( table 3 , figure 7 ) .
completion of the overall task took on average 6.9 s , while most of the time ( mean 4.8 +/ - 0.6 s , i.e. , 82 % of the time ) no or only minimal stimulation , i.e. , < 25 % of stimmax , was applied .
the same was true for the virtual transfer task of the ball into the basket , which was supported by minimal stimulation , i.e. , < 25 % of stimmax , in 78 % of the trajectory.the highest relative stimulation intensity was necessary to facilitate the grasping function , i.e. , the grip strength in transfer movements , by applying stimulation intensities of > 75 % stimmaxto the finger flexion muscle for about 22 % of the time .
the performance - dependent adaptation of stimulation resulted in a decrease in both stimulation intensity ( on average by 35.4 %) and period ( on average by 36.77 %) in the course of the session , which is suggestive of motor learning .

discussion the present study demonstrated the feasibility of integrating multichannel closed - loop neuromuscular stimulation in an exoskeleton - based training ; this neuroprosthesis increased the goal - oriented range of motion and movement velocity while preserving accuracy in chronic stroke patients with a severe impairment of the upper - extremity .
the multi - joint exoskeleton for the paretic arm enabled the patients to perform task - oriented practice within a virtual environment ( housman et al. , 2009 ) , which they were unable to perform without assistance .
notably , unlike other studies with similarly affected stroke patients , in which robots completed a movement that the patients had begun ( klamroth - marganska et al. , 2014 ; brauchle et al. , 2015 ) , this hybrid technology delivered antigravity - support only , i.e. , provided no active assistance .
thus , the patient engagement was maximized by default in the present study , leaving no room for slacking ; the continuous visual feedback of the arm kinematics enabled the patients to adjust their action online during each task ; an approach closely resembling natural motor learning .
such a closed - loop framework adheres to an operant conditioning rationale ( bauer et al. , in press ) , providing contingent feedback to facilitate the targeted activity considered to be beneficial to recovery and which might ultimately lead to functional gain ( bauer and gharabaghi , 2015a ) .
one drawback of such restorative approaches , however , is that the considerable challenge of these exercises ( fels et al. , 2015 ; bauer and gharabaghi , 2015b ) might condition the patients to explore alternative , i.e. , therapeutically undesirable strategies such as compensatory shoulder movements ( cirstea and levin , 2000 ) or co - activation of non - targeted muscles ( gharabaghi et al. , 2014b ) .
moreover , particularly in patients with severe impairments , non - successful trials may frustrate the participants , thereby compromising their motor learning .
in this context , adaptive neuromuscular stimulation , as applied in the present study , may support the exercises by extending the range of motion in accordance with the actual ability of each patient .
more specifically , the range of motion correlated with the upper extremity fugl - meyer assessment score of the patients for both the non - nmes and the nmes condition , indicating a targeted assistance of the genuine movement capability of each patient .
importantly , to avoid under - challenge , stimulation was applied adjunct to voluntary contraction and not as an alternative .
moreover , such an additive stimulation approach has proved effective in assisting reaching and grasping exercises in severely impaired , chronic stroke patients for repetitive task practice ( thrasher et al. , 2008 ; oujamaa et al. , 2009 ; mann et al. , 2011 ) .
unlike these previous approaches , however , our stimulation paradigm was ( i ) multi - channeled , i.e. , targeting seven different muscles , ( ii ) model - based to follow the three - dimensional movement trajectory , ( iii ) performance - dependent to enhance task - oriented training , and ( iv ) subthreshold to avoid slacking : ( i ) previous approaches combining functional electrical stimulation ( fes ) with mechanical support for the upper limb usually stimulated one or two muscles .
only recently , fes of thee joints , i.e. , shoulder , elbow , and wrist , was implemented and shown to be effective in reducing upper limb impairment following stroke ( meadmore et al. , 2014 ) .
notably , more functional motor activities of the upper limb could be performed following this intervention : a finding that could not be achieved in an earlier study conducted by the same research group using exactly the same therapy dose ( 18 sessions , 60 min each ) with fes to two proximal muscles only ( meadmore et al. , 2012 ) .
future studies will reveal whether a more fine - graded targeting of even more muscles - - as shown to be feasible in the present study for stimulation - assisted task - oriented 3d exercises - - leads to further functional gains when applied repetitively within a multi - session intervention .
( ii ) conventional fes of the upper limb , even when physiologically triggered , follows an all - or - nothing concept .
only few research groups have explored model - based stimulation paradigms to precisely control fes for goal - oriented movements of the upper limb ( hughes et al. , 2009 ; meadmore et al. , 2012 , 2014 ) .
the most advanced approach used iterative learning control , which applied data from previous attempts in an effort to update the fes control signal on the current attempt ( meadmore et al. , 2014 ) .
the reduction of error between real and reference trajectories within a biomechanical model thereby corresponded to improved performance over successive attempts .
in addition , the supplied fes was reduced as performance improved to optimize motor learning ( meadmore et al. , 2014 ) .
our approach complements this strategy ; instead of adjusting the stimulation from trial to trial , we tuned it within each trial .
rather than aiming to reduce the error between actual and reference trajectory with suprathreshold fes , we applied a ramping stimulation which , nevertheless , remained subthreshold throughout the task - oriented attempt ( see below ) .
instead of one ( hughes et al. , 2009 ) , two ( meadmore et al. , 2012 ) , or three muscles ( meadmore et al. , 2014 ) , we integrated a total of seven muscles into our biomechanical model. by adding more muscles a larger number of movement directions could be addressed , thereby , covering a three - dimensional volume with movements in x - , y - , and z - direction .
despite these differences , the supplied multi - channel stimulation was reduced in our feasibility study as well .
this could already be observed in the course of one session , suggesting that , even when applied subthreshold , an online adaptation of stimulation has immediate effects on motor learning .
( iii ) the performance - dependent stimulation applied in the present study was more subtle than in other approaches .
since no functional muscle contraction was achieved by the actual stimulation , performance was instead captured by gradual modulations of self - initiated , orthosis - assisted movements .
it is therefore somewhat surprising that this novel approach resulted in task - adapted stimulation intensities for each of seven targeted muscles during the task - oriented exercises , e.g. , with the highest relative stimulation intensity for facilitation of grip - strength occurring during transfer movements .
this information about the different levels of assistance required by the muscles for specific goal - oriented tasks might be used in future studies to customize the exercises and training protocols in such a way as to target specific weaknesses , e.g. , particular muscles / muscles groups in the course of a long - term training program .
( iv ) neuromuscular stimulation alone , however , was not enough to facilitate reach - to grasp movements in our severely impaired patient group .
instead , multi - joint antigravity assistance was required to facilitate the task - oriented training in the 3d - virtual environment .
although , none of the targeted muscles was stimulated in a functionally relevant way to allow for overt muscle contraction , the cumulative effect of multi - channel subthreshold stimulation resulted in an increased range of motion and movement velocity while preserving smoothness during the goal - oriented exercises .
this finding suggests a general facilitation of sensorimotor networks , which might provide a novel restorative approach in chronic stroke patients with a severe impairment of the upper - extremity .
however , it has to be borne in mind that the applied ramping stimulation , based on a boltzmann - fitting algorithm during each task , led to minimal stimulation intensity , i.e. , < 25 % of stimmax , during most of the training period .
future studies need to explore whether different adaptive stimulation paradigms may achieve larger kinematic gains , e.g. , by applying more neuromuscular stimulation , or by utilizing transcranial direct current stimulation to facilitate exoskeleton - based motor leaning ( naros et al. , 2016b ) .
however , the current approach resulted in kinematic gains while still encouraging effort from the participants .
to further generate a challenge for motor learning , the progression of training is necessary ( guadagnoli and lee , 2004 ) and might be realized by reducing the fes support level ( meadmore et al. , 2014 ) or by automated adaptation of training difficulty during robot - assisted stroke rehabilitation ( metzger et al. , 2014 ) .
both of these requirements are integrated into the presented neuroprosthetic set - up and need to be examined in more detail with regard to their respective clinical relevance in the targeted patient population by performing intervention studies with repetitive sessions .
the presented neuroprosthesis sparks hope for a general capacity for even larger gains , e.g. , when additional interventions such as brain state - dependent cortical stimulation ( kraus et al. , 2016a ) are applied to maximally exploit the salvaged restorative potential .
in particular , the task - related and muscle - specific facilitation provided by this hybrid device during reach - to - grasp exercises of severely impaired stroke patients , may deliver the framework for concurrent cortical stimulation .
activity - dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation , for example , may constitute such an additional input during robot - assisted training ( gharabaghi , 2015 ; massie et al. , 2015 ) .
associative brain state - dependent stimulation ( royter and gharabaghi , 2016 ) during brain - robot interface exercises has the potential to unmask latent corticospinal connectivity after stroke ( gharabaghi et al. , 2014a ) .
the application of such state - dependent stimulation synchronized to maximum gains of assisted range of motion may consolidate the involved corticospinal circuits in accordance with hebbian - like plasticity rules .
more specifically , neuroprosthetic exercises based on brain - robot feedback may result in connectivity changes of cortico - cortical motor networks ( vukeliae et al. , 2014 ; vukelic and gharabaghi , 2015a,b ) and lead to a re - distribution of cortico - spinal connections ( kraus et al. , 2016b ) .
this advanced assistive rehabilitation technology may thereby constitute a back - door to the motor system to further improve the scope for recovery ( bauer et al. , 2015 ) .
in summary , combining robotic assistance with adaptive closed - loop neuromuscular stimulation provides customized rehabilitation environments for severely impaired stroke patients , and may increase kinematic parameters while preserving the voluntary effort of patients , during rehabilitation training. whether these technological refinements also lead to relevant functional gains requires investigation in controlled intervention studies in comparison to dose - matched , conventional physiotherapy .

the glutamatergic modulation of melatonin synthesis is well known , along with the importance of astrocytes in mediating glutamatergic signaling in the central nervous system .
pinealocytes and astrocytes are the main cell types in the pineal gland .
the objective of this work was to investigate the interactions between astrocytes and pinealocytes as a part of the glutamate inhibitory effect on melatonin synthesis .
rat pinealocytes isolated or in coculture with astrocytes were incubated with glutamate in the presence of norepinephrine , and the melatonin content , was quantified .
the expression of glutamate receptors , the intracellular calcium content and the nf - kappab activation were analyzed in astrocytes and pinealocytes .
tnf - alpha 's possible mediation of the effect of glutamate was also investigated .
the results showed that glutamate 's inhibitory effect on melatonin synthesis involves interactions between astrocytes and pinealocytes , possibly through the release of tnf - alpha .
moreover , the activation of the astrocytic nf - kappab seems to be a necessary step .
in astrocytes and pinealocytes , ampa , nmda , and group i metabotropic glutamate receptors were observed , as well as the intracellular calcium elevation .
in conclusion , there is evidence that the modulation of melatonin synthesis by glutamate involves paracrine interactions between pinealocytes and astrocytes through the activation of the astrocytic nf - kappab transcription factor and possibly by subsequent tnf - alpha release .
1. introduction the mammalian pineal gland is a component of the photoneuroendocrine system and is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms through the nocturnal synthesis of melatonin .
the gland consists mainly of pinealocytes but also presents interstitial cells , the majority of which are astrocytes [ 1 , 2 ] .
the pinealocytes are the neuroendocrine cells that synthesize melatonin and secrete it into the bloodstream .
in mammals , this process is controlled by the retinohypothalamic pathway and sympathetic innervation , with norepinephrine being released in the perivascular space of the gland at night [ 3 - 5 ] .
norepinephrine interacts with its proper beta1 and alpha1 receptors and stimulates the transcription and translation of the key enzyme arylalkylamine n - acetyltransferase , aanat ( ec 2.3.1.87 ) , resulting in melatonin synthesis and secretion [ 6 - 10 ] .
the role of astrocytes on melatonin production , however , remains unclear .
several neurotransmitters can modulate melatonin synthesis [ 10 - 12 ] .
acetylcholine and glutamate are two important modulators that inhibit melatonin synthesis by decreasing the gene expression and activity profile of both aanat and hydroxyindole - o - methyltransferase ( hiomt ) ( ec 2.1.1.4 ) .
glutamate is stored in synaptic - like microvesicles in pinealocytes and is released upon cholinergic stimulation [ 13 , 14 ] .
the interaction of glutamate with ampa - type ionotropic receptors in the pinealocytes induces greater glutamate exocytosis , amplifying the cholinergic action [ 15 , 16 ] .
recently , an investigation demonstrated that the glutamate vesicular transporter could be responsible for pinealocyte depolarization and glutamate release [ 17 ] .
the final effect of glutamate results from its binding to mglur3 , a class ii metabotropic glutamate receptor , which is coupled to the inhibitory g - protein ( gi ) , leading to reductions in the amount of camp and the synthesis of melatonin [ 12 ] .
studies have shown the presence of many types of glutamate receptors in the pineal gland .
in addition to the known ampa and mglur3 ( 40 , 42 ) expression in the pineal gland , yatsushiro and colleagues showed that rat pinealocytes express mglur5 [ 18 ] , a class i metabotropic receptor related to inositol triphosphate ( ip3 ) formation and intracellular calcium mobilization , whose role on pineal metabolism has not yet been defined .
the presence of glutamate receptors in pineal astrocytes has also been demonstrated .
nmda and ampa ionotropic receptors were characterized in the rat pineal gland [ 19 ] , while mglur2 , mglur3 , and mglur5 were identified in the gerbil pineal gland [ 20 ] .
these data may indicate that glutamatergic signaling in the pineal gland is more complex than previously thought and involves both astrocytes and pinealocytes , similar to the pattern observed in the central nervous system ( cns ) .
indeed , in the cns , astrocytes are important partners at the synapses .
over the past decade , an increasing number of observations have progressively challenged the classical view that astrocytes are passive participants in synaptic function .
in fact , there is a dynamic two - way communication between glia and neurons , called tripartite synapse , in which astrocytic processes are associated with the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal elements [ 21 ] .
neurotransmitters released by presynaptic neurons evoke a calcium increase in adjacent astrocytes which in turn can release several transmitters , called gliotransmitters , including glutamate , d - serine , atp , and large molecules like atrial natriuretic factor and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) [ 21 - 24 ] .
these gliotransmitters feed back onto the presynaptic neuron either to enhance or to depress further release of the neurotransmitters [ 25 ] , or they can act on postsynaptic neurons , causing excitatory or inhibitory responses [ 26 ] .
glutamate signaling in the cns is classically related to the activation of nuclear factor kappab ( nf - kappab ) .
thus , glutamate induces the transcription of genes such as nitric oxide synthase , cyclooxygenase 2 , mn - superoxide dismutase , calbindin , glutamate receptors , bcl - 2 , and brain - derived neurotrophic factor [ 27 - 29 ] .
additionally , recent studies have shown that astrocytes use nf - kappab as a mediator of transcriptional responses to a variety of stimuli , including tissue injury and diseases [ 30 ] .
nf - kappab can induce or repress gene expression by binding to dna sequences known as kappab elements [ 31 , 32 ] .
activation of nf - kappab typically involves the phosphorylation of proteins that inhibit nf - kappab ( ikappabs ) by the ikappab kinase ( ikk ) complex , which results in ikappab degradation [ 33 ] .
nf - kappab is then released from the inhibitory complex and translocated to the nucleus .
in mammalian cells , there are five nf - kappab family members - - rel a ( p65 ) , rel b , c - rel , p50 / p105 ( nf - kappab1 ) , and p52 / p100 ( nf - kappab2 ) - - and different nf - kappab complexes are formed by diverse homo - and heterodimerization processes [ 34 , 35 ] .
in the pineal gland , two independent studies showed that nf - kappab is involved in the inflammatory response and exhibits a circadian rhythm [ 36 , 37 ] .
based on these data , we aimed to investigate the inhibitory action of glutamate on melatonin synthesis , analyzing the crosstalk between astrocytes and pinealocytes .
nf - kappab activation , glutamate receptor expression , and intracellular calcium responses were analyzed in both cell types .
in the present work , we demonstrated that the paracrine interactions between pinealocytes and astrocytes are fundamental for the glutamate inhibitory effect on melatonin synthesis and that it involves the activation of astrocytic nf - kappab transcription factor and the release of a soluble factor , possibly tnf - alpha .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
animals male wistar rats ( 200 - 220 g ) were kept under a 12 : 12 h light - dark cycle ( lights on at 06 : 00 h ) in a temperature - controlled room ( 21 +/ - 2degreesc ) with water and food ad libitum .
the animals were euthanized by decapitation between 09 : 00 and 10 : 00 h. all experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the brazilian college for animal experimentation ( cobea ) and approved by the committee of ethics in animal experimentation of the institute of biomedical sciences ( ceua - - permit number : 091 ) , university of sao paulo ( sao paulo , brazil ) .
2.2 .
pineal gland culture pineal glands were cultured as previously described [ 38 ] .
briefly , after decapitation , the rat pineal glands were removed and immediately placed in ice - cold bgjb medium ( fitton - jackson modification , gibco , grand island , ny , usa ) with phenol red , modified by the addition of bovine serum albumin ( 1 mg / ml ) , 2 mm glutamine , 0.1 mg / ml ascorbic acid , and penicillin ( 100 u / ml ) - streptomycin ( 100 mug / ml ) .

2.3 .
isolated pinealocyte culture pinealocytes were obtained by papain digestion ( papain dissociation system , worthington biochemical corporation , freehold , nj , usa ) .
the glands were removed and immediately placed in ice - cold dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) ( glucose : 1000 mg / l , hepes : 5.9 g , and sodium bicarbonate : 3.7 g ) ( sigma , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
the tissue was incubated at 37degreesc for 45 min in papain ( 0.01 %) and dnase ( 0.01 %) solution .
after removal of papain and its blockage with ovomucoid ( 2 mg / ml ) , the cells were mechanically dispersed and resuspended in dmem supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin to a final concentration of 2 x 105 cells / ml. fifteen milliliters of cells in culture medium was cultivated in 75 cm2 culture flasks at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 / 95 % air for 24 h. after 24 h , the cells in suspension were predominantly pinealocytes , which were separated after the removal of all the culture medium content .
the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in dmem at a concentration of 2 x 105 cells / ml , transferred to a 24 - well plate ( 1 ml per well ) , and kept at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 / 95 % air for 1 h prior to the pharmacological treatments .

trypsin action was blocked with dmem supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .
the cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min at 20degreesc .
the pellet was resuspended according to the different assays .
2.5 .
pinealocyte and astrocyte coculture after the dissociation of the pineal gland cells by papain digestion , pinealocytes and astrocytes were cocultivated in the same well ( 24 - well plates ) in dmem medium with 10 % fetal calf serum at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 / 95 % air at a concentration of 4 x 105 cells / ml ( 1 ml per well ) for 60 h. after that , the medium was replaced by fresh medium without fetal calf serum , and the cells were kept for 1 h at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 / 95 % air prior to the pharmacological treatments .
for melatonin determination in the culture medium , the cells were stimulated with ne ( 1 mum ) alone or in association with glutamate ( 100 or 600 mum ) for 5 h. when bb1101 ( 10 mum ) [ 39 ] , the inhibitor of tnf - alpha converting enzyme ( tace ; adam17 ) , was used , it was added to the medium 30 min before the treatments described previously .
the cells in co - culture were also physically separated by inserts ( transwell with 0.4 mum pore ; corning , ny , usa ) , with astrocytes in the bottom of the wells and pinealocytes within the inserts .
the incubation procedures described previously were reproduced .
2.6 .

after two additional washes in pb , cells were spread upon gelatin - and chromoalumen - coated slides and allowed to dry and adhere using a hot plate ( 37degreesc ) .
cells were then incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies either against the glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ; sigma , usa ) or cr3 complement receptor ( ox - 42 , bd biosciences , usa ) , diluted 1 : 1000 - 1 : 2000 in pb containing 0.01 % triton x - 100 in a wet chamber for 14 - 18 h at room temperature .
following 3 x 10 min washes in pb , cells were then incubated with a wheat germ agglutinin - rhodamine label ( wga ; vector laboratories , usa ) mixed with a donkey anti - mouse igg conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate ( jackson labs , usa ) , diluted 1 : 200 and 1 : 100 , respectively , for 2 h. slides were then washed 3 x 10 min and coverslipped with glycerol - carbonate buffer .
the material was analyzed using a fluorescence microscope equipped with standard filters , and digital images were collected and mounted using adobe photoshop software ( adobe systems inc. , usa ) .
controls for the experiments consisted of the omission of primary antibodies or agglutinin from the procedure .
no staining was observed in these cases .
2.7 .
intracellular calcium measurement isolated astrocytes and pinealocytes were obtained as described previously .
the cells were placed on a thin glass coverslip and incubated in dmem with 16 nm of fluo - 4 ( molecular probes inc. , eugene , or , usa ) , kept at 37degreesc for 1 h , and then washed three times with the same medium .
isolated astrocytes and pinealocytes were treated with glutamate ( 600 mum ) or glutamatergic agonists ( n - methyl - d - aspartic acid - - nmda 100 mum ; alpha - amino - 3 - hydroxyl - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazole - propionate - - ampa 50 mum ; ( s ) - 3,5 - dihydroxyphenylglycine - - dhpg 50 mum ) ( tocris bioscience , ellisville , mo , usa ) .
a laser scanning microscope ( lsm 510 , carl zeiss , jena , germany ) equipped with the attofluor ratio imaging system ( atto instruments , rockville , md , usa ) was used .
measurements were performed using an excitation filter of 505 nm , and the emission was monitored at 530 nm .
2.8 .
determination of melatonin content melatonin content in pineal glands and culture medium was determined by high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) with electrochemical detection using empower software ( waters system , milford , ma , usa ) [ 38 ] .
melatonin was separated on a resolve c18 column ( 5 mum , 150 x 3.9 mm ) .
the chromatographic system was isocratically operated with the following mobile phase : 0.1 m sodium acetate , 0.1 m citric acid , and 0.15 mm edta , 30 % methanol , ph 3.7 , at a flow rate of 1 ml / min .
the electrochemical detector potential was adjusted to + 900 mv. the elution time for melatonin was approximately 6 min .
each gland was sonicated ( microson xl 2005 , heat system inc. , farmingdale , ny , usa ) in a solution of 0.1 m perchloric acid , containing 0.02 % edta and 0.02 % sodium bisulfate .
culture medium was diluted in the same solution of perchloric acid ( 1 : 1 vol / vol ) .
after centrifugation ( 2 min , 13,000 g ) , 40 mul of the supernatant was injected into the chromatographic system ( injector mod .
7125 , 20 mul loop , rheodyne inc. , san francisco , ca , usa ) .
all the salts and reagents used were obtained from merck ( frankfurter , darmstadt , germany ) .
2.9 .
electrophoretic mobility shift assay 2.9.1 .
pineal gland nuclear protein extracts nuclear extracts were obtained from pineal gland homogenates as previously described [ 37 ] after incubation for 30 min with or without glutamate ( 600 mum ) .
briefly , the glands were homogenized in lysis buffer ( 10 mm hepes , 10 mm kcl , 0.1 mm edta , 10 % glycerol , and 0.1 mm pmsf ) , and after 15 min , nonyl phenoxypolyethoxylethanol ( np ) - 40 ( 10 %) was added .
the samples were vigorously mixed , centrifuged ( 12,000 g , 1 min , 4degreesc ) twice , and resuspended in extraction buffer ( 10 mm hepes , 0.5 m kcl , 1 mm edta , 10 % glycerol , and 0.1 mm pmsf ) .
after incubation on ice for 15 min and centrifugation ( 20,000 g , 5 min , 4degreesc ) , the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was collected and stored at - 80degreesc .
protein concentration was determined using the biorad protein reagent ( biorad , hercules , ca , usa ) .
2.9.2 .
astrocytes and pinealocytes nuclear protein extracts nuclear extracts were obtained from isolated astrocytes and pinealocytes homogenates as previously described [ 40 ] after incubation for 30 min with or without glutamate ( 600 mum ) .
briefly , the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer ( 10 mm hepes , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 10 mm kcl , 0.5 mm pmsf , 0.1 mm edta , and 3 mm orthovanadate ) .
after adding np - 40 ( 10 %) , samples were vigorously mixed , centrifuged ( 11,000 g , 20 min , 4degreesc ) twice , and resuspended in extraction buffer ( 20 mm hepes , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 300 mm nacl , 0.25 mm edta , 25 % glycerol , 0.5 mm pmsf , 3 mm orthovanadate , 2 mug / ml leupeptin , and 2 mug / ml antipain ) .
after a 20 min incubation on ice and centrifugation ( 11,000 g , 20 min , 4degreesc ) , the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was collected and stored at - 80degreesc .
the protein concentration was determined using the biorad protein reagent .
2.9.3 .
gel shift assay an electrophoretic mobility shift assay for nf - kappab was performed utilizing the gel shift assay kit from promega ( madison , wi , usa ) , as described previously [ 41 ] .
a 32p - nf - kappab double - stranded consensus oligonucleotide probe ( 5 ' - agttgaggggactttcccaggc - 3 ') and nuclear extracts were used .
dna - protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis through a 6 % nondenaturing acrylamide : bisacrylamide ( 37.5 : 1 ) gel in 0.53 tris - borate - edta ( tbe ) for 2 h at 150 v. gels were vacuum dried and analyzed by autoradiography .
for competition experiments , nf - kappab and transcription initiation factor ii ( tfiid 5 ' - cagagcatataaggtgaggtagga - 3 ') unlabeled double - stranded consensus oligonucleotide were included in ten - fold excess of the molar concentration of 32p - nf - kappab probe to detect specific and nonspecific dna - protein interactions , respectively .
unlabeled oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture 20 min before the addition of the radioactive probe .
the composition of the complexes was determined by supershift assays , adding antibodies ( santa cruz biotechnologies , santa cruz , ca , usa ) against different nf - kappab subunits ( p50 , p52 , c - rel , and p65 , 1 : 20 dilution ) either before or after the incubation of nuclear extracts with the labeled oligonucleotide .
2.10 .
rna extraction and rt - pcr total rna was extracted from isolated astrocytes and pinealocytes using trizol ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
cdna synthesis was performed using superscript iii reverse transcriptase ( rt ) ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) from 1 mug of total rna .
after the rt reaction , 2 - mul aliquots were used as a cdna template for polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) amplifications using gotaq dna polymerase ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) .
the cycling parameters used were 30 s at 95degreesc , 30 s at each primer 's annealing temperature , and 30 s at 72degreesc using a mygene series gradient thermocycler ( longgene , china ) .
pcr products were separated on 1.2 % ethidium bromide - agarose gels , and the bands were visualized by digital scanning .
the primers used in this assay are presented in supplementary table 1 ( see table 1 in supplementary material available at http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1155 / 2013 / 618432 ) .
2.11 .
flow cytometry pineal glands in culture were stimulated with ne 1 mum in the absence or presence of glutamate 100 mum or 600 mum .
after 5 h of incubation , the cells were dissociated via proteolytic digestion with papain .
in an assay of membrane integrity , 50 mul of a propidium iodide solution ( 20 mug per ml in saline buffer ) was added to the cells ( 500 mul ) .
propidium iodide is a highly water - soluble fluorescent compound that cannot pass through intact membranes , as it is unable to enter viable cells .
after membrane disruption , it binds to dna by intercalating between the bases with little or no sequence preference .
after 5 min of incubation at room temperature , the cells were evaluated in facscalibur flow cytometer equipment ( becton dickinson , san jose , ca , usa ) using cell quest software ( becton dickinson , san jose , ca , usa ) .
fluorescence was measured using the fl2 channel ( orange - red fluorescence - - 585 / 42 nm ) .
dna fragmentation was analyzed after dna staining with propidium iodide according to the previously described method [ 42 ] .
cells were resuspended in a solution with detergents ( 300 mul hypotonic solution containing 20 mug / ml propidium iodide , 0.1 % sodium citrate , and 0.1 % triton x - 100 ) that permeabilize the cells , which promptly incorporate the dye into dna .
the pellet was gently resuspended , and the cells were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature .
fluorescence was measured and analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously .
2.12 .
statistical analysis data were always presented as the mean +/ - sem .
statistical analyses ( graphpad prism 5.0 software , san diego , ca , usa ) were performed using one - way anova followed by a bonferroni post hoc test .
when appropriate , student 's t - test was applied .
the graphs related to confocal microscopy were prepared utilizing origin 5.0 software ( microcal software inc. , northampton , ma , usa ) .
autoradiographs of nf - kappab were quantified using scionimage software ( scion corp. , frederick , md , usa ) .
3. results the cultures used in this study were characterized and validated by immunostaining with gfap , a specific marker for astroglial cells , and ox - 42 , a marker for microglia ( specific for activated microglia , as the antibody reacts with the cr3 complement ) .
this ox - 42 antibody is suitable for pineal gland staining because the predominant type of microglia in this tissue expresses complement type 3 receptors [ 43 ] .
wga was used as a pinealocyte marker because it labels photoreceptors [ 44 , 45 ] , and pinealocytes are modified photoreceptor cells [ 46 , 47 ] .
this technique proved to be efficient in labeling these pineal cells ( figure 1 ) .
cultured isolated astrocytes showed fluorescence for gfap ( figure 1 ( a )) but not for ox - 42 and wga ( data not shown ) .
cultured pinealocytes lacked immunostaining for the two glial markers gfap and ox - 42 ( data not shown ) and reacted with wga , demonstrating the absolute predominance of pinealocytes ( figure 1 ( b )) .
figures 1 ( c ) and 1 ( d ) show the distribution of pinealocytes and astrocytes in the mixed culture ( co - culture ) .
the round appearance of the labeled cells in figure 1 , different from that in the insets , is due to the fixation process with paraformaldehyde .
in figure 1 ( d ) , pinealocytes appear smaller than those in figure 1 ( b ) , most likely due to the use of trypsin to obtain the cells , further dissociating the cell clusters .
in intact cultured pineal glands , the known effect of glutamate in reducing ne - stimulated melatonin synthesis ( p < 0.05 ) was observed ( figure 2 ( a )) .
on the other hand , when isolated cultured pinealocytes were incubated with glutamate ( 100 and 600 mum ) in the presence of ne ( 1 mum ) , this effect was abrogated ( figure 2 ( b )) .
glutamate 's inhibitory effect on melatonin synthesis , as observed in intact cultured pineal glands , was only reproduced when pinealocytes were cultivated in the presence of astrocytes in co - culture ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 2 ( c )) .
to investigate if the contact between astrocytes and pinealocytes is necessary for the inhibitory effect of glutamate , the two cell types were cocultivated in the same well but separated by inserts .
it was observed that glutamate 's inhibitory effect on ne - stimulated melatonin synthesis was expressed in the same way as when the cells were cultivated with physical contact , indicating that a diffusible factor released by astrocytes acted on the pinealocytes ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 2 ( d )) .
the possibility of tnf - alpha as a gliotransmitter that mediates the glutamate effect was tested using bb1101 , a preferred inhibitor of metalloproteinases with sheddase activity that includes the tace .
it was verified that when the cells in co - culture were incubated with bb1101 ( 10 mum ) prior to the treatments with glutamate ( 600 mum ) and ne ( 1 mum ) , it was able to completely revert the inhibitory effect of glutamate on melatonin synthesis ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 3 ) .
rt - pcr analyses showed mrna expression of class i / ii metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mglur1 / mglur5 and mglur2 / mglur3 , resp. ) , as well as ionotropic nmda and ampa - type receptors ( glun1 , glua1 , glua2 , and glua3 subunits ) in astrocytes and pinealocytes ( figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b )) .
contrarily , mglur7 mrna ( class iii metabotropic receptors ) was not detected in any of the cell types ( figure 4 ( a )) .
to determine whether class i mglurs , nmda , and ampa ionotropic receptors are functional and incorporated into the astrocytic and pinealocytic membranes , an intracellular calcium analysis by confocal microscopy was used .
it was observed that the class i metabotropic receptor agonist dhpg ( 50 mum ) and the ionotropic receptor agonists nmda ( 100 mum ) and ampa ( 50 mum ) were able to increase the astrocytes and pinealocytes intracellular calcium content in a similar way as that observed for glutamate ( 600 mum ) ( figure 5 , table 1 ) .
electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that glutamate ( 100 and 600 mum ) activates nf - kappab in cultured rat pineal glands .
the result of the competition study showed that the upper complex 1 was displaced by an excess of unlabeled nf - kappab but not by a tfiid double - stranded oligonucleotide consensus sequence , demonstrating the specificity of the nf - kappab / dna interaction .
the lower complex 2 was less efficiently displaced by unlabeled nf - kappab probe ( figure 6 ( a )) .
supershift analysis indicated that the antibody against the p50 subunit was able to shift the dna / protein interaction present in complex 1 .
the presence of antibodies against the p52 , p65 , and c - rel subunits did not affect dna - protein complexes ( figures 6 ( b ) and 6 ( c )) .
taken together , these results indicate that , at these concentrations , glutamate activates the p50 / p50 homodimer .
complex 2 was not displaced by the antibodies and was not considered to be related to the nf - kappab family .
astrocyte and pinealocyte isolated cultures were used to determine the cell type in which nf - kappab was being activated .
glutamate ( 600 mum ) was shown to activate nf - kappab exclusively in astrocytes and not in pinealocytes ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 7 ) .
the involvement of nf - kappab activation in glutamate 's inhibitory effect on melatonin synthesis was analyzed using a specific inhibitor of nf - kappab , pdtc .
pdtc ( 300 mum ) prevented the inhibitory effect of glutamate in cultured rat pineal glands stimulated by ne ( 1 mum ) ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 8 ) .
glutamate cytotoxicity was evaluated because it is known that this neurotransmitter in high concentrations could induce cell death by cytotoxicity [ 48 ] .
cell membrane integrity and dna fragmentation were assessed by flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide ( pi ) .
supplementary figure 1 is representative of the results obtained after cell incubation with ne ( 1 mum ) in the absence ( control group ) or presence of glutamate ( 100 and 600 mum ) for 5 h. the histograms show the fluorescence intensity in the fl - 2 channel , which corresponds to the pi emission wavelength .
when the cell membrane is intact , the fluorescence signal is low and is related to autofluorescence ( m1 ) .
a high signal means that pi was able to enter the cell and bind to dna ( m2 ) .
glutamate treatments for 5 h were not able to induce a loss of membrane integrity ( supplementary figure 1 ( a )) .
the percentage of cells with ruptured membranes in the control group was 4.53 % , whereas it was 5.02 % and 5.77 % in the 100 and 600 mum glutamate - treated groups , respectively , ( supplementary figure 1 ( c )) .
histograms in supplementary figure 1 ( b ) represent the results of dna fragmentation analysis .
after pi treatment , the dna content in live cells presented a high fluorescence signal ( m2 ) .
dna fragmentation induces the formation of small dna pieces that exhibit low fluorescence intensity ( m1 ) .
the percentages of cells with dna fragmentation after glutamate stimulation , 100 and 600 mum , were 2.86 % and 3.35 % , respectively , which were similar to the value of control cells ( 3.66 %) ( supplementary figure 1 ( d )) .
4. discussion isolated pinealocytes , isolated astrocytes and pinealocyte / astrocyte co - culture were used in this study .
the immunocytochemistry characterization of the cell types present in these different cultures demonstrated the predominance of pinealocytes in isolated pinealocyte culture , with the absence of glial cells .
in the same way , astrocyte cultures do not contain a significant number of microglial cells or pinealocytes .
in co - culture , pinealocytes are the predominant cells , as astrocytes are present in minor quantities , reproducing the proportion present in intact pineal glands ( 51 ) .
thus , the cultures were considered to be appropriate for this study .
data from the literature have shown that glutamate acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter on melatonin synthesis [ 12 ] .
according to yamada et al .
[ 13 , 14 , 16 ] and yatsushiro et al .
[ 16 ] , glutamate is stored in microvesicles and released from pinealocytes upon cholinergic stimulation .
it interacts with ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors present in pinealocyte membranes , releasing additional glutamate and inhibiting melatonin synthesis , respectively .
recently , a mechanism involving the glutamate transporter glt - 1 was proposed to be responsible for glutamate release [ 17 ] .
in these studies involving pinealocytes , an autocrine / paracrine process was suggested for the influence of glutamate on melatonin synthesis .
in the present work , we demonstrated an important role for astrocytes in glutamate 's modulatory effect on melatonin synthesis that includes a paracrine interaction with pinealocytes .
whereas in isolated pinealocytes , glutamate does not exhibit the typical inhibitory effect on melatonin synthesis , as observed in intact pineal glands ; its association with astrocytes restores this effect .
these results demonstrate that astrocytes act as partners that collaborate to produce the glutamate effect .
in addition , the fact that the effect occurred even when inserts were used , preventing the physical contact between the cells in co - culture , suggests that a soluble factor is a mediator of this process .
the hypothesis that gap junctions mediated the interactions between astrocytes and pinealocytes , as occurs in the pineal gland [ 49 ] , was excluded from this observation .
the cytokine tnf - alpha , a gliotransmitter that is released by astrocytes , could be the soluble factor that is involved in the interactions between astrocytes and pinealocytes .
in fact , the absence of a soluble form of tnf - alpha interferes with the glutamate response .
the possibility that the glutamate effects were due to cell death was investigated by flow cytometry .
as the cell viability and dna fragmentation levels were similar between control and glutamate - stimulated groups , showing no damage to pineal cells even when treated with 600 mum of glutamate , it is possible to exclude a glutamate cytotoxic effect as a cause of melatonin reduction .
although glutamate receptor expression had been first described in pinealocytes , its expression was also later demonstrated in astrocytes .
mglur3 and ampa ( glua1 subunit ) were shown to be present in pinealocytes [ 12 , 16 ] , and nmda and ampa ( glua2 / 3 ) receptors were present in rat pineal gland astrocytes [ 19 ] .
ionotropic receptor mrna was similarly observed in astrocytes in the present study , in addition to the novel observation of metabotropic receptor ( mglur1 , mglur2 , mglur3 , mglur5 ) expression .
in pinealocytes , the expression of mglur1 / r2 / r3 / r5 , ampa , and nmda receptors was shown .
this evidence supports the possibility of astrocyte participation in rat pineal glutamatergic signaling .
confocal microscopy assays , using nmda , ampa , and dhpg agonists in isolated astrocytes and pinealocytes , revealed increased intracellular calcium content in both cell types for all the agonists used .
pcr and confocal microscopy analyses suggest both gene and protein expression in class i mglur , ampa , and nmda ionotropic receptors , revealing the importance of the glutamate receptors as signal transducers in rat pineal gland astrocytes and pinealocytes .
thus , glutamate seems to interact with its receptors in both cell types , but its effect on melatonin synthesis necessarily involves astrocyte glutamate receptors .
the possible paracrine interactions between pinealocytes and astrocytes seem to be the key in understanding the role of astrocytes in the rat pineal gland .
transcription factors exert a great influence on pineal physiology .
creb and icer are two transcription factors that intimately control the transcription of aanat [ 50 ] .
additionally , there are other transcription factors in the rat pineal gland whose roles in pineal melatonin synthesis are not known [ 51 ] .
nf - kappab is present in the rat pineal gland , showing a circadian rhythm and involvement in inflammatory responses [ 36 , 37 ] .
nf - kappab is a classic possible glutamate mediator , and its activation in glial cells was demonstrated to play a role in inflammatory processes [ 30 ] .
the present results demonstrated nf - kappab activation by glutamate in cultured isolated astrocytes , supporting its role as a mediator of glutamate effects .
supershift assay in cultured pineal glands stimulated with glutamate showed the displacement of the p50 subunit , emphasizing the importance of p50 / p50 homodimer formation .
this is an astrocyte - dependent event because its activation was not observed in pinealocytes .
astrocyte and pinealocyte supershift assays were not performed due to technical limitations related to the amount of nuclear protein .
the p50 subunit is synthesized from its precursor p105 .
the processing of p105 and the resulting generation of mature p50 subunits seem to be a constitutive event , as p50 homodimers are not regulated by ikappab proteins [ 34 ] .
the p50 subunit formation seems to be regulated by cotranslational and posttranslational mechanisms .
in the posttranslational mechanism , the p50 subunit is synthesized from its precursor p105 by phosphorylation at its 927 and 932 serine residues , which allows the ubiquitinization and proteolytic degradation of p105 by the 26s proteasome [ 52 ] .
in the cotranslational mechanism , p50 and p105 can be generated from a single mrna [ 53 ] .
there is also evidence that the 20s proteasome constitutively processes p105 to p50 in a ubiquitin - independent manner [ 52 ] .
the p50 / p50 homodimer was originally considered to be a transcriptional repressor , but now there is substantial evidence that it can also induce gene transcription after a complex formation with the bcl3 nuclear protein , an atypical member of the ikappab family of proteins that is considered to be a coactivator of p50 / p50 homodimers [ 34 ] .
the link between nf - kappab activation by glutamate and the reduction of melatonin synthesis was evidenced with the use of pdtc , a nf - kappab translocation inhibitor [ 54 ] .
pdtc prevented glutamate 's inhibitory effect on melatonin synthesis .
taken together , the crucial presence of astrocytes for the inhibitory effect of glutamate , the exclusive activation of nf - kappab by glutamate in the same cell type , and the demonstration of nf - kappab 's role in melatonin synthesis indicate that astrocytes under glutamate stimulation possibly release a factor that promotes a decrease in pinealocyte melatonin synthesis .
tnf - alpha may be a good candidate .
indeed , tnf - r1 , the tnf - alpha receptor that interacts with soluble tnf , is present in the pineal gland , reinforcing the importance of this signaling pathway [ 55 ] .
acting as an inhibitor of tace to prevent tnf - alpha release , bb1101 was thus adequate in demonstrating the role played by tnf - alpha .
in addition , the hypothesis that the p50 / p50 homodimer may induce tnf - alpha gene expression and release needs to be clarified .
in the cns , astrocytes are known to release gliotransmitters such as glutamate , d - serine , and atp [ 21 ] .
moreover , astrocytes can also synthesize and release proinflammatory cytokines in response to nf - kappab activation , such as tnf - alpha and interleukin - 1 , and induce gene expression of inos , resulting in nitric oxide formation [ 56 ] .
in this work , we suggested that tnf - alpha is the factor that is released by astrocytes under glutamate stimulation because the tace inhibitor antagonized glutamate 's effects .
reinforcing this idea , recent preliminary data obtained in our laboratory with the l929 tumor cell lineage , which is sensitive to tnf - alpha , showed that astrocytes release tnf - alpha when stimulated by glutamate ( data not shown ) .
the literature states that tnf - alpha decreases the serotonin content and aanat mrna expression , resulting in the reduction of n - acetylserotonin [ 57 , 58 ] , the immediate precursor of melatonin synthesis .
it is not clear whether tnf - alpha acts by itself or in combination with glutamate because there are glutamate receptors in the pinealocyte membrane [ 12 , 15 , 16 , 18 ] .
recent studies have reported the control of hippocampal synapses by tnf - alpha due to the increased insertion of ampa receptors in the surface of the neuronal soma [ 59 ] .
the same effect could take place in the pineal gland , in which tnf - alpha released by the astrocytes in response to nf - kappab activation could increase the number of ampa receptors in the pinealocyte membrane , resulting in the inhibition of melatonin synthesis .
a model of the putative paracrine interactions between astrocytes and pinealocytes in the modulation of pineal melatonin synthesis by glutamate is shown in figure 9 .
5. conclusions in summary , according to our results , we propose that glutamate acts on glutamate receptors ( ampa , nmda , and / or mglur1 / 5 ) in astrocytes , increasing the intracellular calcium concentration , promoting nf - kappab activation , and driving the release of a soluble factor , possibly tnf - alpha , which acts independently or with glutamate in the pinealocytes , resulting in inhibition of melatonin synthesis .

figure 8 effect of pdtc , an inhibitor of nf - kappab , on melatonin synthesis .
pineal glands in culture were incubated with pdtc ( 300 mum ) and stimulated by norepinephrine ( ne 1 mum ) in the presence of glutamate ( 100 and 600 mum ) , and melatonin content was evaluated .
one - way anova , bonferroni multiple comparison test , # p < 0.01 versus ne 1 mum , ** p < 0.01 versus ne + glu 100 mum and ne + glu 600 mum , plotted as the mean +/ - sem , n = 12 for each group , 3 experiments .
figure 9 diagram illustrating the putative paracrine interaction between pinealocytes and astrocytes in the modulation of pineal melatonin synthesis by glutamate .
glutamate ( glu ) induces intracellular ca2 + increase in astrocytes with the subsequent activation of nfkappab and release of a soluble factor , possibly tnf - alpha .
this factor alone or in association with glu promotes melatonin synthesis reduction in pinealocytes .

early - life nutrition is an important modifiable determinant in the development of a child 's immune system , and may thereby influence the risk of allergic sensitization and atopic diseases .
however , associations between overall dietary patterns and atopic diseases in childhood remain unclear .
we examined associations of diet quality in early life with allergic sensitization , self - reported physician - diagnosed inhalant and food allergies , eczema , and asthma among 5225 children participating in a population - based cohort in the netherlands .
diet was assessed during pregnancy , infancy , and childhood using validated food - frequency questionnaires .
we calculated food - based diet quality scores ( 0 - 10 or 0 - 15 ) , reflecting adherence to dietary guidelines .
at age 10 years , allergic sensitization was assessed with skin prick tests .
information on physician - diagnosed inhalant and food allergies , eczema , and asthma was obtained with questionnaires .
we observed no associations between diet quality during pregnancy and allergic sensitization ( odds ratio ( or ) = 1.05 per point in the diet score , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.99 , 1.13 ) , allergies ( 0.96 , 95 % ci : 0.88 , 1.04 ) , eczema ( 0.99 , 95 % ci : 0.93 , 1.06 ) , or asthma ( 0.93 , 95 % ci : 0.85 , 1.03 ) in childhood .
also , diet quality in infancy or childhood were not associated with atopic outcomes in childhood .
our findings do not support our hypothesis that a healthy dietary pattern in early life is associated with a lower risk of allergic sensitization or atopic diseases in childhood .
diet quality allergic sensitization allergy eczema asthma pregnancy infants cohort 1 .
introduction the prevalence of childhood atopic diseases , such as eczema and food allergy , has increased in the recent decades [ 1 ] .
these diseases have a substantial impact on the quality of life of those affected [ 2 ] .
genetic background is one of the factors associated with atopic diseases , but given the rapid increase in the prevalence , environmental risk factors , including geographic area and lifestyle factors may play a substantial role in the development of allergies and other atopic diseases [ 3,4,5 ] .
early - life nutrition is an important modifiable lifestyle factor that influences the development of a child 's immune system [ 6 ] .
suboptimal nutrition during pregnancy , infancy , or childhood may interrupt the maturation process of the immune system from fetal life until childhood [ 6,7 ] , which may increase sensitization and thereby the risk of atopic diseases in childhood .
there has been great interest in early - life dietary exposures in relation to atopic diseases , with studies focusing on breastfeeding [ 8 ] , timing of solid food introduction [ 9,10 ] , food allergen avoidance [ 11,12 ] , or intake or blood levels of specific nutrients during pregnancy or in infancy [ 13,14,15,16 ] .
although these specific nutritional factors may indeed be relevant for atopic health , these factors may also represent an overall dietary pattern .
individuals do not consume one specific nutrient or food at a time , but a variety of nutrients combined in foods and meals that may interact .
studying overall dietary patterns takes these potential interactions into account [ 17 ] and may be more applicable in clinical practice .
a few previous studies examined dietary patterns in relation to atopic diseases .
so far , most studies mainly focused on a mediterranean diet in pregnant women or children in relation to atopic diseases [ 18,19,20 ] .
however , findings are inconsistent and most of these studies only examined self - reported atopic diseases , such as asthma or allergic rhinitis [ 18,19,20 ] .
assessing atopy using skin prick tests may be more sensitive and less affected by measurement error , but only a few studies examined associations between dietary patterns and objectively measured atopy .
a study in spain observed an inverse association between a mediterranean diet during pregnancy and atopy in childhood [ 21 ] , whereas other studies did not observe associations of either data - driven dietary patterns [ 22,23 ] or predefined dietary patterns ( i.e. , mediterranean diet score and alternate healthy eating index ) [ 23 ] during pregnancy with atopy in children .
a few other studies focused on early childhood dietary patterns in relation to atopic outcomes .
for example , a nested case - control study in the united kingdom found better adherence to a dietary pattern including high intakes of fruits , vegetables , and home - prepared foods in two - year - old children without food allergy than children who did have a diagnosis of food allergy [ 24 ] .
recently , a population - based cohort in singapore reported an inverse association of a dietary pattern high in noodles and seafood at the age of one year with allergic sensitization to house dust mite at the ages of 18 months and five years , but not with self - reported eczema or rhinitis [ 25 ] .
finally , results from other population - based cohorts , including previous analyses in our cohort , showed positive associations of a western dietary pattern with self - reported asthma symptoms in children aged 3 - 4 years [ 26 ] and 8 - 11 years [ 27 ] , but not with allergic sensitization measured by skin prick tests [ 27 ] .
these previous studies examined diet at different points in early life , focused on different types of dietary patterns , and did not adjust for diet at other points in childhood .
in addition , previous studies mainly focused on a traditional mediterranean diet or examined data - driven dietary patterns , which may not represent actual healthy diets and which cannot be extrapolated to other populations because these patterns are population - specific .
therefore , we aimed to examine the associations between predefined dietary patterns based on dutch dietary guidelines ( i.e. , diet quality ) during pregnancy , infancy , and childhood with allergic sensitization , inhalant and food allergy , eczema , and asthma in mid - childhood .
in addition , we examined whether associations of early - life diet were independent of diet at other time points , including current child diet , and whether associations differed between boys and girls , by maternal history of atopic diseases , and between those who received breastfeeding for at least four months exclusively , partially , or not at all .
2. methods 2.1 .
study design and population this study was embedded in the generation r study , an ongoing population - based prospective cohort from fetal life onward in rotterdam , the netherlands [ 28 ] .
pregnant women with an expected delivery date between april 2002 and january 2006 were invited to participate .
parents of all participating children provided written informed consent and medical ethical approval was obtained from the medical ethical committee of erasmus university medical center , rotterdam ( mec 198.782 / 2001 / 31 , 2001 ) .
further information on the design of the generation r study is available elsewhere [ 28 ] .
in total , parents of 5225 children provided consent , had dietary data for at least one time point ( i.e. , during pregnancy , infancy , or childhood ) and had valid data for at least one of the outcome variables ( i.e. , sensitization , allergy , eczema , or asthma ) .
because data on dietary intake at the different time points and the atopic outcomes were not complete for all participants , the population for analysis varied per specific analysis ( n : between 2519 and 3776 ) ( supplemental figures s1 - s3 ) .
2.2 .
dietary intake during pregnancy dietary intake in early pregnancy ( median 13.6 weeks of gestation ( interquartile range ( iqr ) 12.4 - 16.2 )) was assessed using a semi - quantitative food - frequency questionnaire ( ffq ) .
the ffq included foods that were frequently consumed in the dutch population and was modified for use in pregnant women .
energy intakes were calculated using data from the dutch food composition table .
the ffq was validated against three 24 - h recalls among 71 pregnant women living in rotterdam .
intra - class correlation coefficients for macronutrient intakes ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 .
we applied a previously developed predefined food - based diet quality score for pregnant women , reflecting adherence to dietary guidelines , as described in detail elsewhere [ 29 ] .
briefly , this diet quality score included continuous scores on 15 components : high intake of vegetables , fruit , whole grains , legumes , nuts , dairy , fish , tea ; ratio whole grains of total grains , and ratio soft fats ( i.e. , soft margarines ) and oils of total fat ; low intake of red meat , sugar - containing beverages , alcohol , salt ; and folic acid supplement use in early pregnancy .
the maximum score for each component was 1 , resulting in an overall sum - score ranging from 0 to 15 .
a higher score represented a better diet quality [ 29 ] .
more details on the included components and cut - offs are described in supplemental table s1 and elsewhere [ 29 ] .
2.3 .
dietary intake in infancy dietary intake of the children at a median age of 12.9 months ( iqr 12.7 - 14.0 ) was assessed using a semi - quantitative ffq , which was developed specifically for dutch 1 - year - old children and filled out by the parents [ 30,31 ] .
energy and nutrient intakes of the children were calculated using the dutch food composition table .
the ffq was validated against three 24 - h recalls among 32 children and reasonable to good intra - class correlation coefficients for nutrient intake of 0.4 to 0.7 were found [ 30,31 ] .
we applied a previously constructed predefined diet quality score for preschool children [ 30 ] .
as described in detail elsewhere [ 30 ] , this continuous score reflected adherence to dietary guidelines for preschool children and included ten components , resulting in an overall sum - score ranging from 0 to 10 , with a higher score representing a healthier diet [ 30 ] .
more details on the included components and cut - offs are described in supplemental table s2 and elsewhere [ 30 ] .
2.4 .
diet quality in childhood dietary intake in childhood at a median age of 8.1 years ( iqr 8.0 - 8.2 ) was assessed with a semi - quantitative ffq , as described in detail elsewhere [ 32,33 ] .
the ffq developed for dutch children in this age group and was filled out by the parents .
energy intakes were calculated using data from the dutch food composition table .
the ffq was validated for energy intake using the doubly labelled water method ( pearson 's r = 0.62 ) [ 33 ] .
we applied a previously developed diet quality score for school age children [ 32 ] , with a similar scoring system as used for the pregnant women and infants .
this child diet quality score included ten components , resulting in an overall diet quality sum score ranging from 0 to 10 .
more details on this diet quality score and the included components are described in supplemental table s3 and elsewhere [ 32 ] .
2.5 .
allergic sensitization and atopic diseases children visited our research center at a median age of 9.7 years ( iqr 9.6 - 9.9 ) .
sensitization to inhalant ( including house dust mite , 5 - grass mixture , birch , cat , and dog ) and food ( including peanut , cashew nut , hazelnut , and peach ) allergens was assessed by skin prick tests using the scanned area method [ 34 ] .
histamine dihydrochloride ( 10 mg / ml ) was used as a positive control in duplicate and a saline solution ( nacl 0.9 %) as a negative control .
skin responses were measured 15 min after applying allergens to the skin by measuring the area of the wheal ( mm2 ) .
an area that was >= 40 % of the histamine response was considered positive [ 35 ] .
children with a positive skin response to any of the allergens were categorized as ' any allergic sensitization ' .
we further categorized children into inhalant allergic sensitization and food allergic sensitization .
in addition , questionnaires including questions adapted from the international study of asthma and allergies in childhood core questionnaire [ 36 ] were used to obtain information on physician - diagnosed inhalant (' was your child ever diagnosed by a physician with an allergy to pollen ( hay fever )/ house dust mite / cat / dog ?' ?
( no ; yes ) and food allergies (' was your child ever diagnosed by a physician with an allergy to cashew nut / peanut ?' ?
( no ; yes ) .
based on these questions , we dichotomized children into ' any allergy ' ( no ; yes ) .
finally , we further categorized children into ' sensitization to any allergen and any allergic symptom ' versus ' no sensitization and no symptoms ' .
information on ever eczema and asthma at the age of 10 years was obtained with the same questionnaire (' was your child ever diagnosed by a physician with eczema / asthma ?' ?
( no ; yes ) .
3. covariates at enrollment in the study , maternal height and weight were measured and body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated ( kg / m2 ) .
questionnaires were used to obtain information on educational level of the mother ( low ; high ) , net household income (< 2200 or >= 2200 euros / month ) , parity ( nulliparous ; multiparous ) , prenatal pet exposure ( yes ; no ) , and whether mothers drank alcohol ( never ; until pregnancy was known ; continued drinking occasionally ; continued drinking frequently ) , smoked ( never ; until pregnancy was known ; continued smoking during pregnancy ) , and used folic acid supplements ( no ; started in first ten weeks ; started periconceptional ) during pregnancy .
we used questionnaires to obtain information on maternal history of atopic disease , including allergy ( hay fever / house dust mite / food ) , eczema , or asthma .
if a mother reported to have any of these outcomes , we categorized her as having a history of atopic disease .
information on child 's date of birth and sex was obtained from medical records .
the child 's ethnic background ( dutch ; non - dutch ) was defined based on the country of birth of the parents , which was obtained with questionnaires at enrollment .
information on breastfeeding during the first four months ( never ; partial ; exclusive ) was obtained via postnatal questionnaires .
exclusive breastfeeding was defined as receiving breastmilk only for at least four months .
timing of solid food introduction in the first year of life (< 3 ; 3 - 6 ; >= 6 months ) was obtained from the ffq administered in infancy .
questionnaires were used to obtain information on day care attendance in the first year of life (<= 24 or > 24 h / week ) .
4. statistical analyses non - linearity of associations of diet quality during pregnancy , infancy , or childhood with all atopic outcomes was explored using natural cubic splines ( degrees of freedom = 3 ) .
as no indications for non - linear associations for the main models were found , all analyses were performed using models assuming linearity .
multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the associations of either diet quality during pregnancy , infancy , or childhood with allergic sensitization and atopic diseases around the age of 10 years .
all associations were analyzed in three models with stepwise adjustment for potential confounders based on previous evidence .
the first model was adjusted for child 's ethnic background , sex , age at outcome assessment , and total energy intake .
the second model was additionally adjusted for several socioeconomic and lifestyle factors , including maternal bmi at enrollment , maternal educational level , household income , parity , prenatal pet exposure , alcohol intake during pregnancy , smoking during pregnancy , folic acid supplements during pregnancy , and maternal history of atopic disease .
in the final model , we examined whether associations of diet quality in pregnancy , infancy , or childhood with allergic sensitization and atopic diseases were independent of diet at the other two time points by additionally adjusting them for each other .
breastfeeding , child 's sex , child 's ethnic background , and maternal history of atopic diseases were separately examined as potential effect modifiers by including interaction terms in the models .
as sensitivity analyses , we repeated our analyses restricted to participants with a dutch ethnic background only to reduce the risk of residual confounding by ethnicity , since the ffqs were developed for a dutch population .
also , we repeated our analyses excluding children with any allergic disease in the first year of life for the analyses on infant and child diet quality .
in addition , we examined associations of diet quality with the combination of sensitization and allergic symptoms versus no sensitization or symptoms as outcome .
furthermore , we examined whether associations of early - life diet quality with allergic sensitization and atopic diseases were independent of the other outcomes by adjusting associations with atopic diseases for allergic sensitization and vice versa .
finally , to verify that any associations of the overall diet quality scores were not driven by any specific component of the score , we repeated the main analyses excluding one component from the diet score at a time .
to reduce potential bias due to missing values on some of the covariates ( ranging from 0 to 30.1 %) , these variables were multiple imputed ( n = 10 imputations ) .
diet quality scores at different time points were treated as either exposure or confounders in the different models .
when diet quality was included as a confounder , multiple imputed values of diet quality scores were used and when diet quality was the exposure of interest , the non - imputed variable was used .
the results presented are the pooled regression coefficients of the 10 imputed datasets .
all statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical software program spss statistics version 21.0 ( ibm inc. , armonk , ny , usa ) .
5. results 5.1 .
population characteristics characteristics of the study population are presented in table 1 .
the majority of the children had a dutch ethnic background ( 63.7 %) , and half of the children were girls ( 50.8 %) .
mean (+/ - sd ) diet quality score during pregnancy was 7.7 (+/ - 1.6 ) out of theoretical range of 0 to 15 , mean diet quality score in infants was 4.3 (+/ - 1.4 ) out of 10 , and mean diet quality in 8 - year - old children was 4.5 (+/ - 1.2 ) out of 10 .
none of the participants ( either pregnant women or their children ) reached the maximum diet quality score .
in total , 26.0 % of the children were sensitized to one or more allergens , with 25.6 % of all children being sensitized to an inhalant allergen and 5.7 % to a food allergen .
a physician diagnosed allergy was reported for 11.1 % of the children , with a total of 10.6 % of the children diagnosed with an inhalant allergy and 1.9 % with a food allergy .
eczema was present in 20.0 % of the children , and 8.3 % of the children had asthma .
5.2 .
diet quality during pregnancy associations of diet quality during pregnancy and allergic sensitization in children are presented in table 2 .
in model 1 , we observed a statistically significant association for inhalant allergic sensitization ( or = 1.06 , 95 % ci : 1.01 , 1.12 ) ( model 1 , table 2 ) .
however , this association was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors .
in model 3 , which was our main model , we observed no associations between diet quality during pregnancy and food allergic sensitization ( or = 1.04 , 95 % ci 0.92 , 1.17 ) in children at the age of 10 years ( model 3 , table 2 ) .
in line with our findings for allergic sensitization , we observed no statistically significant associations with self - reported physician - diagnosed inhalant ( or = 0.94 , 95 % ci : 0.88 , 1.00 ) or food allergies ( or = 1.11 , 95 % ci : 0.91 , 1.35 ) , eczema ( or = 0.99 , 95 % ci : 0.93 , 1.06 ) , or asthma ( or = 0.93 , 95 % ci : 0.85 , 1.03 ) in 10 - year - old children ( model 3 , table 2 ) .
5.3 .
diet quality in infancy associations of diet quality in infancy and allergic sensitization and atopic diseases in children are presented in table 3 .
for diet quality in infancy , similar null findings were observed for inhalant allergic sensitization ( or = 0.99 , 95 % ci : 0.92 , 1.06 ) and for food allergic sensitization ( or = 0.98 , 95 % ci : 0.86 , 1.12 ) in model 3 ) .
also , no associations were observed with inhalant ( or = 0.96 , 95 % ci : 0.87 , 1.05 ) or food allergies ( or = 0.84 , 95 % ci : 0.70 , 1.05 ) or with eczema or asthma in children around the age of 10 years ( table 3 ) .
5.4 .
diet quality in childhood table 4 presents associations of diet quality in childhood with the allergic outcomes .
we observed no associations of diet quality in childhood with inhalant allergic sensitization ( or = 1.03 , 95 % ci : 0.96 , 1.11 ) or food allergic sensitization ( or = 1.00 , 95 % ci : 0.88 , 1.15 ) in childhood ( model 3 , table 4 ) .
similar null findings were observed for inhalant allergy ( or = 1.05 , 95 % ci : 0.95 , 1.15 ) , food allergy ( or = 0.86 , 95 % ci : 0.69 , 1.05 ) , eczema ( or = 1.02 , 95 % ci : 0.95 , 1.10 ) , and asthma ( or = 1.03 , 95 % ci : 0.93 , 1.15 ) ( table 4 ) .
5.5 .
additional analyses associations were not statistically significantly different between dutch and non - dutch children for any of the outcomes ( p - for - interaction > 0.1 ) .
in line with this , sensitivity analyses restricted to children with a dutch ethnic background only resulted in similar effect estimates as observed in the whole population ( supplemental tables s4 - s6 ) .
an exception was that among children with a dutch ethnic background only , a higher diet quality during pregnancy was associated with a higher likelihood of inhalant allergic sensitization .
however , we interpret this as a chance finding , since there was no association with any of the other outcomes ; the interaction with ethnicity was not statistically significant ; and because this finding would not remain if we would take into account multiple testing ( p = 0.02 ) .
also , analyses excluding children with any allergic disease in the first year of life resulted in similar findings ( supplemental tables s7 and s8 ) , except for an inverse association of diet quality in infancy with food allergy ( or = 0.64 , 95 % ci : 0.43 , 0.95 , p = 0.03 ) , but not with any of the other outcomes .
analyses with a combination of allergic sensitization and allergic symptoms as the outcome ( n = 642 ) versus no sensitization and symptoms ( n = 1699 ) resulted in similar null findings ( supplemental table s9 ) .
additional adjustment for the other outcome variables did not affect the results ( supplemental tables s10 - s12 ) .
also , excluding one component from the diet scores at a time , or additional adjustment for introduction of solid foods and day care attendance in the first year of life did not affect the results .
we observed a significant interaction ( p = 0.03 ) of infant diet quality with sex on food sensitization , and of infant diet quality with breastfeeding on eczema ( p = 0.03 ) , but not on any of the other outcomes ( p - for - interaction ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 ) .
for none of the associations , we observed a significant interaction for maternal history of atopic diseases or child 's ethnic background ( p - for - interaction > 0.1 ) .
stratification by sex suggested effect estimates in different directions ( boys : or = 0.88 , 95 % ci : 0.73 , 1.06 , model 3 , girls : or = 1.10 , 95 % ci : 0.91 , 1.32 , model 3 ) , but none statistically significant .
similarly , after stratification by breastfeeding , no significant associations were observed in the different groups .
6. discussion and conclusions in this large population - based study , we aimed to examine the associations between diet quality during pregnancy , infancy , and childhood with allergic sensitization , physician - diagnosed inhalant and food allergy , eczema , and asthma in mid - childhood .
overall , we observed no associations of overall diet quality during either pregnancy , infancy , or childhood with allergic sensitization or atopic diseases in children around the age of 10 years .
6.1 .
interpretation and comparison with previous studies although we observed a few associations of diet quality with atopic outcomes in our sensitivity analyses , these were not consistent and do not remain if multiple testing would be taken into account .
in addition , the effect estimates were similar as observed in the main analyses .
our finding of a higher diet quality in infancy with lower odds of food allergy in additional analyses warrants caution and needs further study , as the prevalence of food allergy in these analyses is low ( n = 18 ) .
previous studies mainly reported on associations of one particular time point in childhood ( e.g. , either pregnancy , infancy , or childhood ) with different atopic outcomes .
in this study , we examined diet at three different time points in early life .
although some previous studies observed an inverse association of overall diet during either pregnancy or infancy with atopic outcomes in childhood [ 21,25 ] , we did not observe such associations .
this is in line with a previous study in the united kingdom that also observed no associations of data - driven dietary patterns in pregnancy with asthma or atopy in children around the age of seven years [ 22 ] .
a recent systematic review suggested that a mediterranean diet during pregnancy may only have an inverse association with asthma in the offspring in their first year of life , but not afterwards [ 19 ] .
the longer time window between exposure and outcomes , and the measurement of atopic outcomes at the age of 10 years may therefore explain the absence of an association in our study , as children may outgrow some atopic diseases as they become older [ 37 ] and diet may have no long - term effects .
indeed , previous analyses in our cohort showed a positive association of adherence to a ' western - like ' dietary pattern in early life with asthma - related symptoms such as wheezing at the ages of three and four years [ 26 ] , whereas we did not observe associations of diet quality with asthma at the age of 10 years in the current study .
this suggests that any potential association between early - life diet and atopic outcomes may take place within a short term and may not persist into later childhood .
however , studies with shorter time windows between exposure and outcome also report inconsistent findings .
several cross - sectional studies examined associations of a predefined mediterranean dietary pattern in childhood with allergic outcomes [ 18,19 ] .
inverse associations were reported in some of these studies , for example for diet in children aged six to seven years [ 38 ] and 10 to 12 years [ 39 ] .
a study in the united kingdom observed a positive association of a western dietary pattern , which was high in processed foods , at the age of eight years with asthma , but no associations with allergic sensitization at the ages of eight and 11 years [ 27 ] .
finally , another study observed no associations of children 's adherence to a mediterranean diet at the age of 6.5 years with atopy at the same age [ 21 ] .
in addition to the time window of measurements , geographic area and cultural differences may play a role in the inconsistent associations observed in the different studies .
a meta - analysis suggested , for example , that a mediterranean diet may only be protective for atopic symptoms among children in the mediterranean area [ 18 ] .
a possible explanation for this may be the use of different mediterranean diet indices , which may reflect slightly different food products .
also , a recent study in singapore reported that a dietary pattern which was particularly high in fish and other seafood such as shellfish , at the age of one year was associated with less allergic sensitization to house dust mite at the ages of 18 months , but also at the age of five years [ 25 ] .
the high fish intake may have driven the observed association .
however , children and adults in the netherlands have a relatively low fish and shellfish intake [ 40 ] and low variability .
therefore , these food groups do not drive large variations in our diet quality scores [ 30 ] .
in addition , our diet quality scores were based on dietary guidelines , whereas most previous studies examined indices based on a traditional mediterranean diet or data - driven dietary patterns and did not take into account dietary guidelines .
however , these dietary patterns are population - specific and may not represent actual healthy diets .
the absence of an association in our study may suggest that specific foods or nutrients , such as fish or fatty acids , rather than overall dietary patterns may be more relevant for the prevention of atopic outcomes in children .
further studies in specific populations are needed to confirm this .
6.2 .
strengths and limitations the strengths of this study are its population - based , prospective design , the inclusion of a large number of participants , and the availability of numerous covariates .
also , we had detailed information on allergic sensitization to several common allergens relevant for school - age children , measured with skin prick tests .
for these tests , we used the scanned area method to determine the wheal area , which is considered to be more accurate than measuring the average wheal diameter , and is recommended for use in academic research [ 34 ] .
furthermore , we analyzed overall dietary patterns , and not just single nutrients , which takes into account the interactions between different nutrients [ 17 ] , and we had dietary data available at several time points throughout early life .
several limitations of this study should also be considered .
first , dietary intake during pregnancy , infancy , and childhood were assessed with ffqs , which are prone to measurement errors [ 41 ] .
however , ffqs are commonly used in large epidemiological studies and have been shown to rank participants accurately according to their dietary intake [ 41 ] .
in addition , in our study , we used validated , extensive , population - specific ffqs [ 30,31,33 ] .
although allergic sensitization was measured objectively using skin - prick tests , our other atopic outcomes were assessed with questionnaires filled out by the parents , which may have resulted in some misclassification .
these questionnaires included questions on physician - diagnosed inhalant or food allergies , eczema , and asthma by any physician , but with no further details .
however , we expect any misclassification to be unrelated to the exposure and therefore only resulting in random information bias .
furthermore , results for the associations of diet quality with objectively assessed allergic sensitization with skin prick tests and the self - reported atopic diseases were consistent .
despite that we were able to adjust the analyses for several confounders , some may not have been measured perfectly and there may be other possible confounding factors that we did not have available .
finally , most of the participants included in our study had a dutch ethnic background , were , on average , highly educated , and had a high household income , which may limit the generalizability of our findings to other populations .
however , in our sensitivity analyses restricted to participants with a dutch ethnic background only similar results were obtained , suggesting no large bias due to ethnic background .
in conclusion , our findings suggest that overall diet quality in early life , either during pregnancy , infancy , or childhood , is not associated with the risk of allergic sensitization or atopic diseases in later childhood .
specific nutrients rather than overall dietary patterns may be more relevant for atopic outcomes in children and require further study .

local plexiform neurofibroma can lead to deformity of the pelvis , valgus deformity of femoral neck , and joint capsule laxity .
we report a case of secondary hip osteoarthritis with subluxation and coxa vara deformity resulting from an extra - articular neurofibroma treated with total hip replacement .
case description .
a 39 - year - old man had a large benign plexiform neurofibroma at buttock which induced secondary osteoarthritis of the hip .
conservative treatment of tumor was selected because the patient had low chance of malignant transformation due to absence of other neurofibromatosis features .
however , due to secondary osteoarthritis he underwent total hip arthroplasty .
anterior capsulotomy was selected to avoid large posterior hip tumor mass .
in order to avoid the difficulties associated with setting tension of the abductor muscle , modified trochanteric slide osteotomy with trochanteric advancement , lateralized cup placement , and extended neck offset were used .
one year after the surgery , the patient had excellent clinical function , hip stability , leg length equality and was satisfied with the outcome .
clinical relevance .
we concluded that the modified trochanteric slide osteotomy with trochanteric advancement represents a valuable approach for thr in patients with extremely elongation of the hip abductor and secondary hip osteoarthritis resulting from extra - articular neurofibroma .
1. introduction by definition , plexiform neurofibromas are tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath that form along large nerve trunks , multiple small branches of nerves , or spinal roots ( nerves that arise from the spinal cord ) causing enlargement .
neurofibromatous tumor can cause bone erosion due to compression of the adjacent bone [ 1 , 2 ] .
furthermore , local neurofibromas can lead to deformity of the pelvis , valgus deformity , and joint capsule laxity , all of which predispose a person to dislocation [ 3 ] .
recurrent dislocation leads to subsequent development of progressive hip arthritis [ 4 ] .
therefore , surgical approach , offset , soft tissue tension , and stability are particular challenges when performing thr in this population of patients .
we report a case of secondary hip osteoarthritis with subluxation and coxa vara deformity resulting from a large extra - articular neurofibroma in a 39 - year - old man .
the aim of this paper is to emphasize the surgical technique in order to avoid early and late postoperative complications .
2. case report a 39 - year - old accountant was evaluated by the orthopaedic oncology service at our institution .
the patient presented with a 9 - year of right hip pain .
he noticed a swelling in his right buttock approximately 6 years ago that was growing for 3 years .
at the time of presentation , the pain was localized to the right groin and did not radiate .
however , he was unable to walk more than 30 min .
pain was worse during vigorous activities and he was unable to participate in sports .
the patient walked with a significant limp .
on examination , a large soft tissue mass was palpated in his right gluteal region .
the mass was soft , not tender and mobile with no overlying skin change .
right hip motion included flexion of 100 degrees , fixed flexion deformity of about 15 degrees , and abduction and adduction of 30 degrees .
both external and internal rotations were limited on the right side to 15 degrees .
pain was present with all planes of motion .
he walked with a significant lurch and his right leg was 5 mm shorter than his left .
neurological examination revealed no abnormal findings .
radiographs of the right hip showed significant lateralization and subluxation with change of osteoarthritis , coxa vara deformity , and a long neck of femur ( figure 1 ) .
ct scan confirmed the presence of subluxation of the right hip with numerous osteophytes around the femoral head and acetabulum ( figure 2 ) .
mri revealed a large massive vascular enhancing mass of 23 x 13 cm which largely was posterior to the right hip and extended above the femoral neck .
the mass extended through the neural foramina at the l5 - s1 level ( figures 3 ( a ) and 3 ( b )) .
ultrasound - guided biopsy of the area was performed in order to rule out malignancy .
histological examination of the tissue revealed plexiform neuro fibroma .
aspiration was performed and infection was ruled out .
since the patient did not have any other features suggestive of neurofibromatosis , he had a very low chance of malignant transformation .
due to large size and pelvic location of the tumor , the orthopaedic - oncologist recommended conservative treatment .
the patient 's pain was mainly experienced in the groin pain and not the mass itself .
the patient was ultimately referred to our arthroplasty unit for consideration of total hip arthroplasty .
due to the secondary arthritic change which had developed , it was elected to proceed with total hip arthroplasty .
the operation was performed utilizing a modified trochanteric slide osteotomy approach .
anterior capsulotomy was chosen to avoid posterior hip tumor mass .
there was a large posterior tumor in the buttock under the tensor fascia lata and a small mass at the inferior and posterior aspect of the acetabulum .
an outrigger ( stryker company ) , a device for measuring leg length and offset , that placed on the iliac crest was used .
the femoral neck was carefully cut at a length base on preoperative templating .
because it was quite difficult to remove the deformed femoral head , the femoral head had to be split in half in situ to remove from the acetabulum .
the acetabulum had a deficient anterior wall .
elongation of the gluteus medius tendon and muscle was shown .
in order to improve tension of hip abductor , minimal reaming was performed to avoid deep position of the cup .
a trabecular metal shell ( zimmer , warsaw , in , usa ) size 58 mm was impacted and liner was positioned into the cup .
a large diameter head ( 36 mm ) was used to reduce the risk of dislocation .
the m - l taper , extended neck offset , femoral component ( zimmer , warsaw , in , usa ) was impacted and the head was attached .
the hip was reduced and the outrigger was used again to check the offset and length .
the stability and range of motion were tested .
the trochanter was reattached on the lateral femoral cortex distal to the original bed in order to increase the abductor tension and stability of hip joint .
the patient was rehabilitated weight bearing as tolerated and used an abduction brace for 6 weeks .
on physical examination at the fourth month postoperatively , the patient demonstrated that he had normal gait , equal leg lengths , and a good range of motion of the right hip with flexion to 90 degrees , abduction to 45 , adduction to 30 , and external rotation to 30 degrees .
at 1 - year followup , the patient continued to do extremely well without pain , normal gait , and a good range of motion .
on examination , he walked without a trendelenburg lurch .
at this followup , he had a harris hip score of 93 points .
the anteroposterior radiograph of the right hip showed relative lateral position of the socket to improve offset and distal advancement of the greater trochanter ( figure 4 ) .
3. discussion plexiform neurofibromas are most often congenital tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 ( nf1 ) that can cause accelerating bone and soft tissue growth [ 5 ] .
although these tumors are usually benign , there is a 2 - 5 % chance of malignant transformation in the setting of nf1 [ 6 ] .
in this case , the neurofibroma was felt to have a low chance of malignant transformation but was clinically asymptomatic .
however , decisions about surgical treatment must be made judiciously and individualized for each patient [ 5 ] .
neurofibromas distant from the hip joint have been hypothesised to cause pathological dislocation .
mechanical instability due to weakness of the abductor muscles caused by spinal - cord tumor and tumor impingement which have been suggested as a predisposing factors [ 3 , 7 ] .
in the case of this patient , we found no tumor in the spinal cord and no other signs of neurofibromatosis or abnormal neurological examination .
although the x - ray shows the same shallow acetabular at the right hip as in dysplastic hip , coxa vara , long neck of femur , and normal size of femoral sharp are not the common deformity in dysplastic hip .
his hip subluxation was a result of the large neurofibroma putting pressure on the hip joint and subsequently he developed progressive arthritis .
if adjustments in modular implants , such as offset acetabular liners , offset femoral stems , and longer neck lengths do not provide stability without excessive lengthening (> 1.5 to 2.0 cm ) , a trochanteric slide osteotomy can be performed with distal advancement [ 8 ] , for our patient , because his neck of femur was very long and his hip was in varus deformity .
moreover , lateral subluxation was present .
therefore , severe lax abductor mechanism was concerned before surgery .
we used lateral position of the cup and an extended neck offset of femoral component to improve tension of hip abductor .
however , they cannot provide enough hip stability .
the trochanter was then advanced 40 - 50 mm distally to the previous level and reattached to the lateral cortex of femur which increased the abductor tension ( figure 4 ) .
there were few studies [ 9 , 10 ] that reported an average 16 - 18 mm ( range 10 - 30 mm ) of distally trochanteric advancement for treatment of recurrent dislocation after thr .
when compared advancement with other study , our patient needed much more distally trochanteric advancement to provide enough stability after thr .
therefore , trochanteric advancement is an ideal method that can improve hip stability after thr in extreme elongation of hip abductor without excessive leg lengthening .
another advantage of using trochanteric slide osteotomy approach is to preserve the vastus lateralis muscle origin and decrease the incidence of trochanteric migration [ 5 ] .
anterior capsulotomy was performed with this approach to avoid large posterior hip tumor .
a large femoral head ( 36 mm ) was chosen to reduce dislocation risk .
the outrigger device was used to check the offset and leg length .
if the hip joint is still unstable after all techniques are made use of , a constrained liner is an option .

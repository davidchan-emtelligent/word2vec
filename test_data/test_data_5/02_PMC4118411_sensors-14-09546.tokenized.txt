introduction smart sensing technologies are widely used in modern vehicles .
the latest developments in automobile design have allowed them to be equipped with a camera and a radar system , which are aimed at sensing people , obstacles , and other vehicles .
such sensors provide supplementary information to the driver .
it is helpful for a driver to receive instructive information from these smart sensors .
the sensing systems contribute not only to achieve active safety , but also to achieve driverless self - driving [ 1 ] and autonomous parking [ 2 ] .
the equipped camera and radar systems may fail to capture the circumstances in some cases , where some barriers are on the traffic lane .
for example , when a car comes to a blind junction of a highway , neither the camera nor the radar can detect the approaching cars in the main lane .
on the other hand , acoustical noises , which are generated by the approaching cars , arrive at the car in the blind junction .
in this paper , acoustical sensing of the approaching vehicle is proposed as an active safety system .
the acoustical signal is a suitable cue for recognizing an approaching car in blind conditions .
however , the acoustical signal is sensitive to the presence of acoustical interferences .
another serious problem lies in the acoustical sensing of the approaching cars .
to achieve the acoustical sensing , the vehicle must be equipped with external microphones to capture the acoustical signals .
therefore , the captured signals consist of the target signal , which is generated by the approaching car , and interferences such as wind noises and road traffic noises .
it is necessary to robustly extract the target signal and localize the approaching car .
a robust spatial feature is required for achieving sound source localization with noisy observations .
in this paper , the spatial feature is extracted by the spatio - temporal gradient method [ 3 - 5 ] .
the spatio - temporal gradient method has an advantage of high temporal resolution with a non - iterative closed - form solution .
it is difficult even for the spatio - temporal gradient method to accurately localize the approaching car with highly distorted observations .
filtering processes are indispensable for achieving robust sound localization .
the kalman filter can be also applied in a simple traffic condition , which can be described by a linear model [ 6 ] .
in this paper , however , a non - linear particle filter [ 7 ] is employed as post - filtering .
the particle filter has been widely applied in sound source localization under noisy environments [ 8 - 11 ] , reverberant environments [ 12 - 14 ] , noisy and reverberant environments [ 15 - 17 ] , and multiple source conditions [ 18 - 22 ] .
those methods employ the conventional spatial features .
the proposed method employs the advanced spatial feature , which is extracted by the spatio - temporal gradient method .
the spatial feature is regarded as likelihood , and a random walk process is employed as a system model .
feasibility of the proposed method is examined using real world data , when a target vehicle approaches the reference vehicle .
the objective of the experiment is to catch and track the approaching vehicle , which comes from the rear side .
this paper is organized as follows : section 2 overviews sound source localization , and section 3 describes the robust spatial feature based on the spatio - temporal gradient method .
section 4 describes a state space model and sequential state estimation by particle filtering .
in section 5 , the experimental setup is explained , and experimental results are shown to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method .
finally , conclusions are given in section 6 .
2. direction - of - arrival estimation 2.1 .
overview spatial information on a sound source includes both direction of the source and distance to the source .
direction - of - arrival ( doa ) estimation focuses only on estimating the direction .
sound source localization is the task of estimating both variables , namely , distance and direction to the source .
in general , source localization requires a larger number of microphones when compared to doa estimation .
figure 1 illustrates the architecture of a standard doa estimator .
a set of spatially - distributed microphones , that is , a microphone array , is usually used for obtaining the spatial information .
a spatial feature for doa estimation is extracted from the multi - channel observations captured by the spatially - distributed microphones .
it is important that a robust spatial feature is provided for doa estimation under adverse environments .
doa estimation is completed by peak search in the spatial feature .
doa estimation can be achieved by various approaches .
it is broadly divided into non - parametric and parametric methods .
the parametric method uses a deterministic model , which describes the spatial relationship between a sound source and a microphone .
model parameters are determined based on a statistical fitting technique using less - distorted acoustical observations .
popular parametric doa estimators are based on high - resolution spectral analysis such as a minimum variance algorithm [ 22 ] , and a multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm [ 23 ] .
those methods can yield the accurate doa estimate , when the acoustical environment satisfies their assumptions .
those , however , fail in doa estimation under non - stationary , heavy noisy , and high reverberant conditions .
2.2 .
non - parametric doa estimation concerning the non - parametric doa estimation , beam scanning and time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) estimation are the two major techniques .
the beam scanning technique relies on the difference in amplitude among multiple observations .
the beam is formed by delay - and - sum beamforming [ 24 ] , and the main - lobe is steered in the search space .
the most dominant steered direction , i.e. , the one that returns the highest energy in the beamformer output , is regarded as the doa estimate .
the beam scanning can be performed with small computational complexity , but is not robust against background noise and room reverberation .
it also requires a large - scale microphone array to form a sharp main - lobe in delay - and - sum beamforming [ 25 ] .
tdoa estimation is widely employed in doa estimation using a small - scale microphone array such as a paired - microphone .
in 2 - ch tdoa estimation , stereo observations acquired by a paired - microphone are defined as follows : ( 1 ) x1 ( t )= h1 ( t )* s ( t )+ n1 ( t ) ( 2 ) x2 ( t )= h2 ( t )* s ( t )+ n2 ( t ) where s ( t ) is a target source signal , hi ( t ) is the room impulse response between the target source and i - th microphone , ni ( t ) is a channel - dependent background noise , and * means a convolution operation , respectively .
the acoustical condition in the room is assumed as linear time - invariant .
in the free field , that is , a non - reverberant sound field , equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are simply written as follows : ( 3 ) x1 ( t )= a1s ( t - tau1 )+ n1 ( t ) ( 4 ) x2 ( t )= a2s ( t - tau2 )+ n2 ( t ) where ai is a constant attenuation factor , and taui is the propagation time , when the target signal arrives at each microphone .
tdoa tau12 can be estimated based on the phase difference between two observations , x1 ( t ) and x2 ( t ) : ( 5 ) tau12 = tau1 - tau2 cross correlation r12 ( tau ) between the stereo observations is the most popular spatial feature for the tdoa estimation : ( 6 ) r12 ( tau )= 1tintegral0tx1 ( t ) x2 ( t + tau ) dt the tdoa estimate is given as with the maximum of the cross correlation r12 ( tau ) : ( 7 ) tau ^ 12 = argmaxtau [ r12 ( tau )] in general , phase difference is much robust against acoustical interferences than amplitude difference .
therefore , the cross correlation is modified in tdoa estimation .
the generalized cross correlation [ 26 ] is widely used in tdoa estimation : ( 8 ) r ~ 12 ( tau )= integral - infinityinfinityx1 ( omega ) x2 *( omega )| x1 ( omega )|| x2 ( omega )| ejomegataudomegawhere x1 ( omega ) and x2 ( omega ) are the fourier transform of the stereo observation , x1 ( t ) and x2 ( t ) , and * represents the complex conjugate : ( 9 ) x1 ( omega )= integral - infinityinfinityx1 ( t ) e - jomegatdt ( 10 ) x2 ( omega )= integral - infinityinfinityx2 ( t ) e - jomegatdt in equation ( 8 ) , the spatial feature is based on the phase transform , and is robust against noise and reverberation [ 27,28 ] .
the smoothed coherence transformation [ 29 ] is also a well - known robust spatial feature .
in case of single dimensional space , the doa estimate is straightforwardly given by the tdoa estimate as follows : ( 11 ) theta ^= sin - 1tau ^ 12cdwhere c is the sound velocity , and d is the microphone spacing .
3. robust spatial feature it is important for doa estimation to use a suitable spatial feature , which is robust against acoustical interferences such as noise and reverberation .
acoustical observations obtained by vehicle - mounted microphones outside the vehicle are heavily distorted , and then the traditional spatial features are not appropriate for this purpose .
in this section , a robust spatial feature is introduced for doa estimation with heavily distorted observations .
the spatio - temporal gradient method has been proposed for 3 - d sound source localization based on the spatio - temporal derivative of multi - channel acoustic signals .
the principle of the spatio - temporal gradient has been originally applied into image processing , but is compatible with sound source localization on the spatio - temporal domain [ 3 - 5 ] .
let us assume that sound pressure of a point source is observed as f ( t ) at a microphone position .
spatial and temporal gradients of the sound pressure f ( t ) are written in 3d sound space as fx ( t ) , fy ( t ) , fz ( t ) , and ft ( t ) , respectively .
the relationship among sound pressure , its spatial and temporal gradients , is given as follows [ 5 ] : ( 12 ) fx ( t ) - uxrf ( t ) - uxcft ( t )= 0 ( 13 ) fy ( t ) - uyrf ( t ) - uycft ( t )= 0 ( 14 ) fz ( t ) - uzrf ( t ) - uzcft ( t )= 0where u = ( ux , uy , uz ) is the unit vector from the observation point to the sound source , r is the distance between the observation point and the sound source , and c is the sound velocity , respectively .
therefore , u and r mean the direction of the target source and the source distance , respectively .
in this paper , a single dimensional doa estimation is carried out in [ 0 deg. , 180 deg. ] with stereo observations .
the scalar component ux is estimated in equation ( 12 ) , and then a doa estimate theta is formally given by theta = sin - 1ux .
in the process of doa estimation , the sequence of an observation is segmented into framed data using a window function , w ( t ) , of which length is t. in equation ( 12 ) , a weight function is multiplied into the framed data , and the weighted equation is integrated in [ 0 , t ] : ( 15 ) fx ( tau,omega ) - uxrf ( tau,omega ) - uxcft ( tau,omega )= 0where : ( 16 ) f ( tau,omega )= integral0tf ( t + tau ) w ( t ) e - jomegatdt ( 17 ) fx ( tau,omega )= integral0tfx ( t + tau ) w ( t ) e - jomegatdt ( 18 ) ft ( tau,omega )= integral0tf ( t + tau ){ jomegaw ( t ) - wt ( t )} e - jomegatdt here , ft ( tau,omega ) depends on w ( t ) and its temporal gradient wt ( t ) .
spatio - temporal information is represented in equation ( 15 ) regardless of the window length t. both ux ( tau ) and r ( tau ) are given in [ 0 deg. , 180 deg. ] as the least square solutions in the temporal - spectral domain as follows [ 4 ] : ( 19 ) ux ( tau )= sumomega | f ( tau,omega )| 2sumomegare [ fx ( tau,omega )* ft ( tau,omega )] - sumomegare [ f ( tau,omega )* fx ( tau,omega )] sumomegare [ f ( tau,omega )* ft ( tau,omega )] sumomega | f ( tau,omega )| 2sumomega | ft ( tau,omega )| 2 - ( sumomegare [ f ( tau,omega )* ft ( tau,omega )]) 2 ( 20 ) r ( tau )= sumomega | f ( tau,omega )| 2sumomegare [ fx ( tau,omega )* ft ( tau,omega )] - sumomegare [ f ( tau,omega )* fx ( tau,omega )] sumomegare [ f ( tau,omega )* ft ( tau,omega )] sumomegare [ f ( tau,omega )* fx ( tau,omega )] sumomega | ft ( tau,omega )| 2 - sumomegare [ f ( tau,omega )* ft ( tau,omega )] sumomegare [ fx ( tau,omega )* ft ( tau,omega )] both ux ( tau ) and r ( tau ) are sequentially updated using the time - variant observations in short - term frames .
in this paper , only the doa estimate ux ( tau ) is used for sensing the approaching vehicle .
the spatial gradient , fx ( t ) , is defined as the difference between stereo observations .
a pair of free - field response microphones is used for calculating the sound pressure and its spatial gradient .
in practical , equation ( 15 ) is solved in the frequency domain .
the doa estimate is given in each frequency .
low frequency components are distorted by acoustical interferences , and then are ignored in doa estimation .
the selected doa estimates forms the doa histogram in each short - term frame .
4. particle filtering 4.1 .
state space model the spatial feature is provided by the spatio - temporal gradient method with stereo observations , x ( t ) = ( x1 ( t ) , x2 ( t )) , which are noisy signals observed by two spatially - separated , vehicle - mounted microphones .
the spatial feature can be regarded as a probability distribution for doa existence on single - dimensional state space in [ 0 deg. , 180 deg. ] .
doa estimate is given as the direction with the maximum in the spatial feature p ( theta | x ) : ( 21 ) theta ^= argmaxtheta { p ( theta | x )} difficulty in doa estimation is caused by distortion on the spatial feature p ( theta | x ) due to various kinds of noises .
4.2 .
doa estimation through state estimation in the scenario of the traffic scene around the junction of the highway , it is difficult to model a doa , which is determined by a relationship between the motion of a reference vehicle and independent movements of surrounding vehicles .
roughly speaking , however , the doa must change smoothly in between short - term frames .
as a system model , a random walk process is applied to model the stochastic behavior of the doa as follows : ( 22 ) thetak = thetak - 1 + nuk,nuk ~ n ( 0,sigma2 ) where thetak represents the true doa at the k - th time frame , and nu means the zero - mean gaussian noise with the variance sigma2 .
the true doa trajectory and the sampled observations up to the k - th frame are noted as follows : ( 23 ) theta1 : k ={ theta1,theta2,l,thetak } x1 : k ={ x1,x2,l,xk } the spatial feature can be regarded as likelihood p ( xk | thetak ) .
state estimation is formally done in a recursive form of the posterior distribution , p ( theta1 : k | x1 : k ) , as follows : ( 24 ) p ( theta1 : k | x1 : k )~ p ( theta1 : k - 1 | x1 : k - 1 ) p ( xk | thetak ) p ( thetak | thetak - 1 ) 4.3 .
particle filtering sequential state estimation is done by particle filtering in the bayesian framework [ 7 ] .
we employ a bootstrap filter , which uses the system model as proposal distribution [ 7 ] .
doa estimation is performed with the posterior spatial feature by particle filtering .
in practice , weighted particles are sequentially updated according to equation ( 24 ) .
in the initial frame , particles { theta0 ( l )} ( l = 1,2 ,... , m ) with the same weight 1 / m are drawn from uniform distribution in [ 0 deg. , 180 deg. ] .
particles at the k - th frame are drawn from the system model in equation ( 22 ) , and the weight for each particle is updated by the likelihood as follows : ( 25 ) thetak ( l )~ p ( thetak | thetak - 1 ( l )) wk ( l )= p ( xk | thetak ( l )) where l = 1,2 ,... , m. the particles { thetak ( l )} ( l = 1,2 ,... , m ) are sampled with replacement in proportion to the weight { thetak ( l )} ( l = 1,2 ,... , m ) . the resampled particles are used as the proposal particle distribution in the next frame .
doa is estimated by finding the peak of the filtered spatial feature .
the peak is obtained by averaging the weighted particles .
in the case with a small set of particles , the spatial feature is obtained from the weighted particles convolved with gaussian kernels .
5. performance evaluation 5.1 .
experimental scenario the relative doa between a reference vehicle and an approaching vehicle coming from the rear side was estimated , when an oncoming vehicle also existed in the opposite lane .
figure 2 shows the outline of the experimental field .
the reference middle - size sedan ( self vehicle ) cruises equipped with several microphones , when a hatchback approaches the reference vehicle from the rear and a large - size sedan approaches in the oncoming lane .
the reference vehicle is constantly moving at the speed of 30 km / h , and the approaching vehicle from the rear is moving at 50 km / h. in other words , the relative speed between the reference vehicle and the approaching vehicle from the rear is set at 20 km / h. the oncoming vehicle approaches at the speed of 50 km / h in the opposite lane .
data collection was carried out several times in the same traffic scenario .
5.2 .
data preparation in this experiment , the target was the approaching vehicle from the rear .
thus , microphones were installed at the back of the vehicle .
microphone arrangement was also considered to efficiently capture the approaching vehicle .
in this experiment , 15 calibrated microphones ( sony ecm - 77b ) were put on the rear side as shown in figure 3 .
in practical , a pair of microphones was empirically selected out for doa estimation .
the spacing between the microphones was 74 mm. the observed signals were sampled at 48 khz with 16 bits accuracy .
the doa histogram was calculated in each frame , of which length was set at 1024 samples .
in each frequency bin , of which width was 46.8 hz , a doa estimate was given by the spatio - temporal gradient method .
the doa estimates in the frequency range from 200 hz to 15,000 hz formed the doa histogram .
the width of the doa histogram bin was set at 10 degrees .
a narrower width gives a doa estimate in high resolution , but requires a higher computational cost .
for an active safety system , the realization of the real - time processing has precedence over the accuracy of the doa estimate .
the particle filter employed 100 particles in the doa range of [ 0 deg. , 180 deg. ] .
the variance sigma2 of the system noise in equation ( 22 ) was empirically set at one degree .
likelihood in particle filtering was given by averaging those weighted particles .
resampling was carried out in each frame in order to avoid degradation of particles .
it is important for particle filtering to appropriately arrange the particles in the initial frame [ 30 ] .
in general , the initial particles shall be uniformly distributed in [ 0 deg. , 180 deg. ] without a priori information .
in the scenario in figure 2 where the approaching target vehicle is located at 0 degree approximately , the initial particles should be distributed in proportion to the exponential distribution as shown in figure 4 .
the parameter of the exponential function is determined assuming vehicles in forward direction are not considered in the acoustical sensing .
5.3 .
experimental results doa estimation was carried out using the stereo observations .
when the target vehicle was far from the reference vehicle , the observation did not include sufficient information on the target vehicle .
when the energy of the acoustical observation exceeded a threshold , doa estimation began automatically .
the threshold was empirically determined in this experimental scenario .
true doa trajectories were obtained using a gps system , of which sampling frequency was set at 20 khz .
three sets of different scene ( scenes 1 - 3 ) were used for doa estimation .
figure 5 gives the true doa trajectories in scene 1 .
0 degree , 90 degrees , and 180 degrees indicate backward , side , and forward directions of the reference vehicle , respectively .
the doa trajectory of the approaching vehicle from the rear as the target for acoustical sensing is drawn with a blue line , and that of the oncoming vehicle in the opposite lane as the interference is drawn with a red line .
figure 6 shows the spectrogram of the acoustical observation , which is obtained by using the microphone mounted on the reference vehicle .
figure 7 displays the spatial features , which are obtained by the spatio - temporal gradient method in equation ( 19 ) and the conventional cross - correlation - based method in equation ( 8 ) , in left and right panels , respectively .
it is impossible to achieve doa estimation with the conventional cross - correlation - based method .
therefore , the cross - correlation - based spatial feature could not be adopted as the likelihood in particle filtering .
figure 8 shows both the pre - filtered doa estimates by the spatio - temporal gradient method and the post - filtered doa estimates by particle filtering .
in figure 8 , the pre - filtered doa estimates are obtained as the doa with the maximum of the doa histogram in each frame , and are represented by the pink cross marks .
the post - filtered doa trajectory , which is represented by the blue line , is averaged over 1000 runs in particle filtering , where the same likelihood is used with the same initial particle distribution .
figure 8 also displays the standard deviation among the post - filtered doa estimates over 1000 runs by error bars .
concerning the data shown in figure 8 , the pre - filtered doa histograms have peaks around 90 degrees in the beginning up to 17 s approximately , although no vehicle existed at the side .
in this scenario , the approaching vehicle chased the reference vehicle , and ran abreast with each other .
it is supposed that those peaks in the doa histograms correspond to the directions of the noise sources such as the engine noise , the exhaust noise , the tire noise , and the wind noises related to the reference vehicle .
alternative peaks around 0 degree corresponds to the noises caused by the approaching vehicle from the rear , that is , 0 degree .
those peaks around 0 degree dominated , as the target vehicle approached .
the particle filter contributed to accurately disregard the doa candidates caused by acoustical interferences .
in scenes 2 and 3 , the true doa trajectories and the spatial features obtained by the spatio - temporal gradient method are given in figures 9 and 11 , and pre - filtered and post - filtered doa estimates are shown in figures 10 and 12 , respectively .
in scene 2 as shown in figures 9 and 10 , the target vehicle approached and separated , while the oncoming vehicle passes along the opposite lane .
therefore , the filtered results were influenced by the acoustical noises caused by the ongoing vehicle in the opposite lane .
as the results , the estimated doa trajectories have sharp dips around 24 s in figure 10 .
the post - filtered results are stuck to 80 degrees , although the target vehicle separates from the reference vehicle after 30 s. it is considered that noises from the reference vehicle have generated a ghost sound source at the direction around 80 degrees .
to improve the tracking performance , particle transition according to asymmetrical probability distribution should be substitute for the random walk model with the gaussian system noise .
in scene 3 as shown in figures 11 and 12 , it tends to be similar to the results in scenes 1 and 2 .
those doa estimation results are summarized in table 1 .
table 1 gives the means and the standard deviations among the errors of the pre - filtered and post - filtered doa estimates over frames .
the doa estimation errors are relatively large , because the spatial resolution of the spatial feature is set to 10 degrees .
the average error over the post - filtered doa estimates is 10 degrees smaller than that of the pre - filtered doa candidates .
an advantage of particle filtering depends on a traffic scene .
at least , the filtering could reduce the error in doa estimation in 5 degrees .
in total , the proposed method succeeds in capturing and tracking the approaching target vehicle from the rear .
in particle filtering , a real - time factor was 0.096 using a 2.6 ghz intel core i7 processor .
it means that the filtering process can be done in real time .
6. conclusions it is important to achieve robust sensing of surrounding vehicles in order to design an active safety system .

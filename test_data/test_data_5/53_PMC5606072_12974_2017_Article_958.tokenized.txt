background the primary cilium is an organelle that can act as a master regulator of cellular signaling .
despite the presence of primary cilia in hippocampal neurons , their function is not fully understood .
recent studies have demonstrated that the primary cilium influences interleukin ( il ) - 1beta - induced nf - kappab signaling , ultimately mediating the inflammatory response .
we , therefore , investigated ciliary function and nf - kappab signaling in lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) - induced neuroinflammation in conjunction with ciliary length analysis .
methods since tlr4 / nf - kappab signaling is a well - known inflammatory pathway , we measured ciliary length and inflammatory mediators in wild type ( wt ) and tlr4 - / - mice injected with lps .
next , to exclude the effects of microglial tlr4 , we examined the ciliary length , ciliary components , inflammatory cytokine , and mediators in ht22 hippocampal neuronal cells .
results primary ciliary length decreased in hippocampal pyramidal neurons after intracerebroventricular injection of lps in wt mice , whereas it increased in tlr4 - / - mice .
lps treatment decreased primary ciliary length , activated nf - kappab signaling , and increased cox2 and inos levels in ht22 hippocampal neurons .
in contrast , silencing kif3a , a key protein component of cilia , increased arl13b ciliary protein levels and suppressed nf - kappab signaling and expression of inflammatory mediators .
conclusions these data suggest that lps - induced nf - kappab signaling and inflammatory mediator expression are modulated by cilia and that the blockade of primary cilium formation by kif3a sirna regulates tlr4 - induced nf - kappab signaling .
we propose that primary cilia are critical for regulating nf - kappab signaling events in neuroinflammation and in the innate immune response .

cilia play crucial roles in vertebrate development and human genetic disease .
they have been hypothesized to act as " antennae " during signal detection , which , in many contexts , has proven to be the case [ 2 ] .
many genetic disorder ciliopathies are involved in the loss or impairment of the primary cilia .
recent studies , however , indicate that specialized ciliary compartments often influence signal transduction downstream of the initial stimulus , but upstream of the transcriptional response .
indeed , there are now established functions for primary cilia in left - right determination , mechanosensation , and regulation of sonic hedgehog ( shh ) [ 3 , 4 ] , wnt [ 5 ] , insulin growth factor ( igf ) , and transforming growth factor ( tgf ) signaling [ 6 ] .
neurons and astrocytes have been found to have a non - motile primary cilium [ 7 ] .
primary cilia have been implicated in neuronal signaling and in the central control of appetite [ 8 , 9 ] .
despite the widespread presence of primary cilia in hippocampal neurons , their function remains unknown [ 10 , 11 ] .
recent studies demonstrated that primary cilia contribute to il - 1beta - induced nf - kappab signaling by regulating ikk activity and mediating the inflammatory response [ 12 , 13 ] .
additionally , in articular chondrocytes , il - 1beta - induced primary cilia elongation is associated with a transient increase in hif - 2alpha expression , which suggest that the primary cilium regulates hif signaling during inflammation [ 14 ] .
it is also well known that changes in ciliary traffic and content affect ciliary length .
changes in ciliary length are thus indicative of altered function , as observed in wnt and sonic hedgehog signaling [ 15 , 16 ] .
the function of biogenesis of primary cilia was investigated with different stages of ciliogenesis [ early ( intracellular ) , late ( extracellular )] [ 17 ] .
ciliary length is also hypothesized to be linked to the inflammatory response in chondrocytes [ 12 , 13 ] .
therefore , we utilized ciliary length analysis to investigate the role of primary cilia in nf - kappab signaling in lps - induced neuroinflammation in vitro , using ht22 hippocampal neurons , and in vivo using a wild type and tlr4 - / - mice since tlr4 / nf - kappab signaling is a well - known inflammatory pathway .
methods experimental animals and lesions we used male 8 - 10 - week - old c57bl / 6 mice purchased from samtakobiokorea ( osan , korea ) and c57bl / 10scnj toll - like receptor ( tlr4 ) knockout ( tlr4 - / - ) mice were purchased from the jackson laboratories ( bar harbor , me , usa ) .
all animal - related procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of chungnam national university ( cnu - 00781 ) and were consistent with the ethical guidelines of the national institutes of health .
lps was prepared as a stock solution at 10 mg / ml in sterile 0.1 m pbs .
lps was injected at right lateral cerebral ventricle ( anteroposterior , - 0.4 mm ; mediolateral , 1 mm ; dorsoventral , - 2.3 mm relative to bregma ) using a 50 - mul hamilton microsyringe fitted with a 26 - gauge needle inserted to a depth of 2.4 mm ( 5 mug / 5 mul in pbs , i.c.v. ) .
control mice received an equal volume of saline .
lps - injected animals ( n = 4 - 5 per group ) and saline - injected control animals ( n = 5 per group ) were allocated .
at 1 and 3 days after lps or saline injection , mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital ( 50 mg / kg i.p. ) , and perfused transcardially with heparinized pbs , followed by perfusion with 4 % paraformaldehyde in pbs .
their brains were removed , immersed in the same fixative for 4 h , and then cryoprotected in a 30 % sucrose solution .
they were embedded in tissue freezing medium and then frozen rapidly in 2 - methyl butane precooled to its freezing point with liquid nitrogen .
frozen coronal sections ( 35 mum thick ) were obtained using a leica cryostat .
immuonohistochemistry and immunofluorescence parallel free - floating sections were subjected to endogenous peroxidase blocking with 1 % h2o2 in pbs , followed by treatment with blocking buffer ( 1 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) in pbs and 0.3 % triton x - 100 for 30 min ) and incubation with primary anti - acetylcholine iii ( aciii , 1:500 , # sc - 588 , santa cruz , ca ) overnight .
immunohistochemical staining of the tissue sections were performed using the avidin - biotin peroxidase complex ( abc ) method described previously [ 11 , 18 ] .
ht22 hippocampal cells were immunoreacted for adp ribosylation factor like gtpase 13b ( arl13b , 1:1000 , # 17711 - 1 - ap , proteintech ) .
all immunoreactions were incubated with cy3 - conjugated anti - rabbit secondary antibody and counterstained with dapi .
cell culture ht22 cells were maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( welgene , daegu , korea ) and 1 % antibiotic solution ( gibco brl - life technologies ) in a humidified incubator with 5 % co2 in air at 37 degreesc .
for neuronal inflammation experiments , cells were seeded in 60 mm cell culture dishes ( corning , ny , usa ) 24 h before treatment .
cells were treated with 100 ng / ml lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) from escherichia coli 026 : b6 .
cells were processed for immunocytochemical and immunoblot analysis for indicated times after lps treatment .
transfection with small interference rna for transfection with small interference rna ( sirna ) , ht22 hippocampal cells were trypsinized and seeded in a 60 - mm dish at 50 % confluence .
si _ kif3a ( sense sequence : agcugugaauuaaggaaugggcaga , nm _ 008443 ) was purchased from integrated dna technologies , inc. , and resuspended with depc water to protect from nuclease degradation .
the individual sirnas , oligofectamine , and opti - mem ( invitrogen , md ) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min .
sirna - oligofectamine complexes were incubated with the cells for 5 h in opti - mem with 10 % fbs ( sirna at 20 nm final concentration ) .
sirna oligofectamine complexes were removed , and the cells were placed in growth media for 24 h. at 1 , 6 , and 24 h after lps ( 100 ng / ml ) treatment at the indicated concentrations , the cells were processed for immunoblotting .
western blotting hippocampi from lps - treated ( 1 and 3 days ) control mice and tlr4 knockout mice were dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer .
after centrifugation , protein concentrations were determined in supernatants using micro bca protein assay kits ; bovine serum albumin was used as a standard ( pierce chemical , rockford , il , usa ) .
cultured ht22 cells were collected by scraping , and the pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer using pro - prep reagent ( intron biotechnology , sungnam , korea ) with a protease inhibitor cocktail .
following normalization of protein content in each sample , 30 mug of the total cellular fraction of each sample was separated by 10 or 12 % sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( page ) and transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes .
the blot was probed with primary antibodies : p - p65 ( 1:1000 , # 3033 , cell signaling ) , ikappabalpha ( 1:300 , # sc - 371 , santa cruz ) , cyclooxygenase 2 ( cox2 , 1:500 , # sc - 166,475 , santa cruz ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos , 1:500 , # n32030 , transduction laboratories ) , and beta - actin ( 1:500 , # 2965 , cell signaling ) .
the immune complexes were identified using an enhanced chemiluminescence ( ecl ) detection system ( amersham ) .
cilia length measurement a leica ( tcs sp8 ) confocal microscopy was used to create maximum projection of confocal z - stacks from which cilia length was measured using imagej software .
different mounted preparations were used to capture five fields of cells at x 63 magnification giving data for more 100 cilia per subgroup .
confocal z maximum projections were also used to assess cilia prevalence and dapi nuclear staining .
statistical analysis differences of cilia length were assessed by chi - squared tests .
statistical significance between multiple groups was compared by one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by an appropriate multiple comparison test ( post bonferroni test ) .
two group analyses were performed using the student 's t test .
p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
all statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism4 software ( graphpad software inc. ) .
results lps decreases primary cilia length in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in wild type mice , but has the opposite effect in tlr4 - / - mice to determine the role of primary cilia in neuroinflammation , we examined changes in hippocampal cilia in a mouse model of inflammation .
because lps administration induces neuroinflammation , this model is likely suitable for evaluating ciliary function in the hippocampus [ 19 ] .
to identify cilia , we stained the hippocampus for aciii , a universal marker of primary cilia in the mouse brain [ 11 ] .
whereas staining for somatostatin receptor 3 could potentially be used for the same purpose , this stain labels only approximately 30 - 50 % of aciii - immunoreactive cilia in neurons [ 20 ] .
therefore , aciii is a useful marker for analyzing ciliary length .
in control mice , aciii was found exclusively in primary cilia .
it was especially abundant in the pyramidal layer of the ca1 and ca3 regions of the hippocampus .
intracerebroventricular injection of lps reduced the length of cilia in the ca1 region of wild type ( wt ) mice 1 and 3 days post - treatment ( fig. 1a , b ). fig. 1 primary ciliary length decreased in hippocampal pyramidal neurons after lps treatment in wild type mice , but increased in tlr4 - / - mice .
the brains from wild type ( a ) and tlr4 - / - mice ( tlr4 k.o ( c )) were stained for aciii ( red ) and dapi ( blue ) after intracerebroventricular injection of lps .
panels show representative images from four to five mice before ( control ) and 1 ( lps - 1d ) and 3 ( lps - 3d ) days after lps treatment .
aciii - reactive ciliary length ( b , d ) in the ca1 region was measured at the same time points .
ciliary length was significantly shorter in wild type mice , but longer in tlr4 - / - mice , after lps treatment .
the data are presented as mean +/ - sem .
** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 .
scale bar = 20 mum in a and c ; 10 mum in the corresponding inset images we next examined the effects of lps on ciliary length in tlr4 - / - mice .
early studies report that tlr4 is expressed primarily in microglia , but not astrocytes or neurons [ 21 ] .
other studies , however , have found that neurons do express tlr4 and that tlr signaling in neurons regulates neural precursor cell proliferation , axonal growth , neuronal plasticity , and adult neurogenesis [ 22 ] .
because tlr4 is the primary receptor for bacterial lps , we utilized tlr4 - / - mice to evaluate the effects of lps on primary cilia .
interestingly , basal aciii expression in the hippocampus of tlr4 - / - mice had a mean length of 10.1 mum , which is less than the 15.0 mum measured in wt mice ( fig. 1b , d and additional file 1 : figure s1 and additional file 2 : figure s2 ) .
cilia lengths were also measured with images accumulated from 2 mum z - stack in total 24 - mum thickness tissues ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
in contrast to wt mice , lps injection into the hippocampus of tlr4 - / - mice increased ciliary length in ca1 pyramidal neuronal cells 1 and 3 days post - treatment ( fig. 1c , d ) .
aciii positive cells were imaged in their entirety at higher magnification with a confocal microscope using 3d reconstruction , and ciliary lengths were analyzed ( additional file 2 : figure s2 ) .
these data demonstrate that lps significantly decreases the length of cilia in the hippocampus , while it increases ciliary length in tlr4 - / - mice .
our results suggest that lps requires interaction with its receptor , tlr4 , to stimulate downstream signaling culminating in disruption of ciliogenesis .
ciliary arl13b expression is associated with tlr4 - mediated nf - kappab activity and decreases in the hippocampus after lps treatment while aciii has utility in immunohistochemistry as a marker of primary cilia in many regions of the adult mouse brain [ 11 ] , we have found that another ciliary protein , arl13b , ciliary trafficking coordinator and universal marker , is more suitable for immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry .
because stimulation of tlr4 activates nf - kappab signaling to promote the expression of cytokines , chemokines , and adhesion molecules [ 23 , 24 ] , we next measured the expression of ciliary proteins and indicators of tlr4 - mediated nf - kappab signaling .
in wild type mice , arl13b protein levels in the hippocampus were decreased after lps injection ( fig. 2 ) , which is consistent with that of fig. 1 imaging data .
lps injection increased phosphorylation of p65 and decreased ikappabalpha expression ( fig. 2 ) , indicating translocation of p65 into the nucleus and activation of nf - kappab .
lps injection also increased cox2 and inos expression , which are associated with pro - inflammatory cytokines ( fig. 2 ) .
in contrast , lps treatment suppressed nf - kappab signaling and expression of pro - inflammatory mediators , and increased arl13b expression in tlr4 - / - mice ( fig. 2 ) .
since lps has effects on cilia length and ciliary protein in tlr4 - / - mice , we confirmed the changes of cilia length with the administration of tlr4 antagonist together with lps to the wild type mice to determine whether it abrogates lps - elicited effects on cilia .
tlr4 antagonist ( 1 mug / 5 mul , mab - mtlr4 / md2 ) was injected 1 day before lps , and then , ciliary protein and inflammatory mediators were examined .
as expected , arl13b protein level and other inflammatory mediators ( p - p65 , ikbalpha , cox2 , and inos ) showed similar patterns with tlr4 - / - mice ( additional file 3 : figure s3 ) .
in addition , we measured ciliary protein levels by lps in primary neuronal culture from wild type and tlr4 - / - mice .
we confirmed that the expression of arl13b protein was decreased in wild type , but not changed in tlr4 - / - . the other inflammatory mediators ( p - p65 , cox2 , and inos ) were influenced by lps in wild type but not in tlr4 - / - ( fig. 3 ) .
these data suggest that lps treatment decreases ciliary length ( additional file 1 : figure s1 and additional file 2 : figure s2 ) and protein expression in the hippocampus of wild type mice , while lps increases to some extent in tlr4 - / - mice but not to that of the wt mice .
our results suggest that primary cilia may be associated with the lps - induced tlr4 / nf - kappab - mediated inflammatory response. fig. 2 ciliary arl13b expression decreased in the hippocampus after lps treatment and is associated with tlr4 .
wild type ( wt ) and tlr4 - / - ( tlr4 k.o ) mice received intracerebroventricular injections of lps .
three days after lps injection , the hippocampus was isolated for immunoblotting ( a ) .
expression of arl13b ( b ) , phosphorylated p65 ( p - p65 ) ( c ) , ikappabalpha ( d ) , cox2 ( e ) , and inos ( f ) were quantified fig. 3 the expression of ciliary arl13b and inflammatory protein in primary neuronal culture derived from wildtype and tlr4 - / - mouse brain .
protein levels of arl13b ( a , b ) and phosphorylation of p65 ( a , c ) , cox2 ( a , d ) , and inos ( a , e ) were quantified by western blotting in primary neuronal cells from wild type and tlr - / - mice after lps .
the data are normalized to beta - actin and quantified and expressed as optical densities and are presented as the mean +/ - sem of three independent experiments .
*** p < 0.001 lps treatment decreases primary cilia length in hippocampal neurons in vitro constitutive expression of tlr4 has been detected in hippocampal neurons [ 25 ] , sensory neurons [ 26 ] , and neural stem cells [ 27 ] .
these observations suggest that neurons can synthesize chemokines , as well as the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and il - 6 in response to bacterial infection and lps .
in the preceding experiments , we found that ciliary length decreased in hippocampal neurons after lps treatment and that these changes were altered in tlr4 - / - mice .
tlr4 , however , is also expressed by microglia , and tlr4 activation in microglia mediates inflammation in response to central nervous system infection [ 28 ] .
we , therefore , sought to determine whether the changes we observed in the hippocampus were due to binding of lps to tlr4 in neurons or microglia .
we thus utilized ht22 hippocampal neuronal cells to exclude the effects of microglial tlr4 activation .
in monolayer cultures , freshly isolated ht22 cells had primary cilia with a mean length of 5.5 mum .
treatment with lps ( 100 ng / ml ) significantly decreased the length of cilia in ht22 cells after 1 and 6 h of exposure , with recovery after 24 h of exposure ( fig. 4a , b ) .
this effect was accompanied by a decrease in arl13b expression , which reached a nadir after 6 h of exposure ( fig. 4c , d ) .
these data further confirm that lps - induced inflammation abrogates primary ciliary elongation and protein expression in hippocampal neuronal cells. fig. 4 lps treatment decreased primary ciliary length in cultured hippocampal neurons .
after exposure to lps ( 100 ng / ml ) for 1 , 6 , and 12 h , ht22 hippocampal neurons were stained ( a ) for arl13b ( red ) and dapi ( blue ) and ciliary length was measured via confocal imaging ( b ) .
over 100 cilia were measured for each group .
protein levels of arl13b were quantified by western blotting ( c ) under control conditions ( cont ) and after lps exposure .
the data are normalized to beta - actin and quantified and expressed as optical densities and are presented as the mean +/ - sem of three independent experiments .
*** p < 0.001 .
scale bar = 20 mum in a ; 10 mum in the corresponding inset images lps - induced nf - kappab signaling and expression of inflammatory mediators are modulated by primary cilia primary cilia are present in neurons , mediate mechanical and chemical signal transduction , and contain proteins that support intraciliary transport and structure [ 8 , 9 ] .
kinesin - 2 family protein a ( kif3a ) , a kinesin motor subunit , is required for proper ciliary function and structure [ 29 , 30 ] .
kinesin - 2 forms a heterotrimeric complex consisting of the motor subunits , kif3a and kif3b , and a non - motor subunit , kinesin - associated protein [ 31 ] .
kinesin - 2 motor proteins mediate anterograde transport to the distal tip of the cilium , while dynein motor proteins mediate retrograde transport to the basal body of the cilium [ 32 ] .
we utilized knockdown of kif3a with sirna to assess whether lps - induced nf - kappab signaling and expression of inflammatory mediators are influenced by primary ciliary function .
twenty - four hours after transfection with kif3a sirna , ht22 hippocampal cells were exposed to lps ( 100 ng / ml ) for 6 h. in control cells , lps decreased arl13b and ikappabalpha expression and increased phosphorylation of p65 , indicating nuclear translocation of p65 and activation of nf - kappab signaling ( fig. 5a - d ) .
lps treatment also increased cox2 and inos expression ( fig. 5a , e , and f ) .
in kif3a - silenced cells , basal arl13b expression was decreased compared with scrambled sirna - treated cells ( fig. 5a , b ) .
lps increased arl13b expression , but it did not reach basal control levels in scrambled sirna - treated cells ( fig. 5a , b ) .
those immunoblotting data was confirmed with arl13b length with image analysis ( additional file 4 : figure s4 ) .
lps treatment after kif3a knockdown did not affect phosphorylation of p65 and ikappabalpha expression , indicating suppression of nf - kappab signaling .
basal expression of cox2 and inos was inhibited with kif3a knockdown and was further decreased by lps ( fig. 5c - f ). fig. 5 lps - induced nf - kappab signaling and expression of inflammatory mediators are associated with primary cilia .
ht22 cells were transfected with control ( scrambled ) sirna or sirna targeting kif3a for 24 h before exposure to lps ( 100 ng / ml ) .
six hours after lps treatment , cells were harvested and stained for detection of arl13b ( a , b ) , phosphorylated p65 ( p - p65 ) ( a , c ) , ikappabalpha ( a , d ) , cox2 ( a , e ) , and inos ( a , f ) .
the data are normalized to beta - actin and quantified and expressed as optical densities and are presented as the mean +/ - sem of three independent experiments .
* p < 0.05 , *** p < 0.001 next , we measured the levels of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines .
the levels of inflammatory cytokines [ tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) alpha , interleukin ( il ) - 6 , and ifn - gamma ] were attenuated in under kif3a sirna treated cells , while anti - inflammatory cytokines [ il - 10 ] was unchanged ( additional file 5 : figure s5 ) .
we also observed that the lps treatment increased the nitric oxide ( no ) production , but this effect was attenuated in kif3a knockdowned cells ( additional file 6 : figure s6 ) .
finally , we detected the effects of primary cilia on acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) in hippocampal neuronal cells since it is reported that tlr - mediated cholinergic reactions determine the inflammatory outcome in traumatized mice and humans [ 33 ] .
the results showed that the level of ache increased after lps treatment .
however , lps treatment in kif3a knockdowned cells did not alter the level compared to scrambled sirna - treated cells ( additional file 7 : figure s7 ) .
on the other hand , previous study showed il - 1beta - induced cilia elongation with alternations to cilia trafficking of arl13b [ 14 ] .
the elongation is associated with a transient increase in hif - 2alpha expression and accumulation in the primary cilium .
to clarify cilia trafficking in neuroinflammation , we examined hif - 2alpha expression level .
the protein level of hif - 2alpha was increased in ht22 neuronal cells after lps , but it was abrogated in kif3a - silenced cells ( additional file 8 : figure s8 ) .
to exclude the effect of lps on proliferation , we examined the cell proliferation in our condition .
ki67 expression by lps was not changed compared to both scrambled - and kif3a - silenced cells ( additional file 8 : figure s8 ) .
this suggested that lps does not impact in cell proliferation , which potentially serve as a direct regulator of ciliogenesis and thereby influence cilia prevalence and length .
these data suggest that primary cilia inhibit lps - induced nf - kappab activation and inhibit the expression of pro - inflammatory mediators .
discussion in this study , we found that lps - induced inflammation decreases the length of cilia in hippocampal pyramidal neuronal cells .
alternations in ciliary length were associated with tlr4 - mediated nf - kappab activation and expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines ; these processes appear to be modulated by ciliary function .
the biogenesis of primary cilia was investigated to track the stages of primary cilia assembly [ 17 ] .
in this study , we used immunostaining with universal ciliary markers aciii and arl13b for measuring ciliogenesis .
as shown in the " results ," basal aciii imaging of the pyramidal neurons hippocampus of the wt and tlr4 - / - resulted in cilia mean length of 15.0 and 10.1 mum , respectively ( fig. 1b , d ) .
however , the basal mean length as measured via arl13b was 5.8 mum ( fig. 4b ) .
this discrepancy in the basal lengths highlights the current limitations of the ciliogenesis assay , mainly in that it cannot monitor the ciliary stages in real time .
it also points to the current challenges in measuring the absolute cilia lengths .
thus , we focused on comparing the differences of their relative cilia lengths and on the effects of primary cilia in neuroinflammatory conditions .
primary cilia have well - established roles in the regulation of many signaling pathways [ 34 ] .
there are , however , fewer studies linking cilia to nf - kappab activation and the release of inflammatory cytokines , although there is a growing body of evidence for the case [ 12 - 14 ] .
the present study itself demonstrates that nf - kappab activation and expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines are associated with ciliary function .
as another example , removal of the cilium inhibits lps - induced expression of cox2 and inos due to failure in upstream signaling rather than in transcription .
recent studies have also directly linked primary cilia to il - 1beta - induced nf - kappab signaling through the regulation of ikk activity [ 12 ] .
specifically , traffic in the cilium appears to be important to phosphorylation of ikappab by ikk , which initiates degradation of ikappab .
heat shock protein 27 ( hsp27 ) , an established regulator of ikk , is also localized to the ciliary axoneme , and cellular levels of hsp27 are dramatically perturbed with loss of the primary cilium .
these findings suggest that primary cilia exert potentially critical modulation of nf - kappab activity .
indeed , it has been proposed by others that cilia can modulate molecular events at rate - limiting steps of the nf - kappab signaling pathway to fine - tune signaling as appropriate [ 12 ] .
our present data support this hypothesis .
on the other hand , recent insights identified cholinergic anti - inflammatory pathway to play an important role in the process of reducing inflammation [ 35 - 37 ] .
as we found the effects of primary cilia on neuroinflammation , we examined the relation of cholinergic pathway and primary cilia .
while ache level was increased after lps treatment , there was no significant difference in its level between the kif3a knockdowned cells compared to the scrambled sirna - treated control cells ( additional file 7 : figure s7 ) .
this data suggested that the primary cilia may have little relationship with the cholinergic pathway. with regard to human disorders , primary ciliary dyskinesia ( pcd ) is a genetic disorder involving dysfunction of motile cilia , which share much in structural homology with primary cilia [ 38 ] .
low nitric oxide ( no ) is a clinical marker of pcd , and there is evidence that cells isolated from patients with pcd have a reduced capacity to respond to infectious challenge [ 39 ] .
in that study , ciliated cell cultures from patients with pcd did not increase no production and nos2 expression remained unchanged .
those findings suggest that primary cilia contribute to no production , which involves activation of nf - kappab .
similarly , human disorders in which primary ciliary dysfunction has been implicated , including jeune syndrome and short rib - polydactyly syndrome type iii , have been recently linked to wdr34 , which is itself associated with nf - kappab signaling [ 40 , 41 ] .
it has also been reported that ikk / nf - kappab - induced inflammation interferes with ependymal ciliogenesis [ 42 ] and primary cilia disassembly in stem cells [ 43 ] .
collectively , available evidence suggests that primary cilia may regulate nf - kappab - induced inflammation , in addition to integrating extracellular signaling pathways and establishing cell polarity , which in turn determine neuronal cell fate , migration , differentiation , and multiple adult behaviors [ 34 ] .
in this study , we found that tlr4 - mediated nf - kappab activation and expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines are modulated by ciliary function .
differential and receptor - specific tlr expression on ciliated / basal cells or on the apical / basolateral cell membrane of the airway epithelium has been documented [ 44 ] .
it has also been reported that lps - induced intracellular sub - apical tlr4 expression in human primary polarized bronchial epithelial cells is associated with cilia on the apical cell surface [ 45 ] .
these studies reveal that lps - induced activation of respiratory epithelial cells is largely dependent on tlr4 signaling in motile cilia , suggesting that lps and its binding partner , tlr4 , are linked to cilia .
other studies show that nasal no production , ciliary beat frequency , and tlr signaling are impaired in pulmonary non - tuberculous mycobacterial disease [ 46 ] .
in the present study , we report that ciliary length is shorter in tlr4 - / - mice compared with control and that lps injection into the hippocampus increased the length of cilia in ca1 pyramidal neurons .
theoretically , lps is the most potent tlr4 agonist , which implies that lps should not stimulate the neuronal cells of tlr4 - / - mice .
in our study , lps increased ciliary length in tlr4 - / - mice , but increased length did not reach basal levels of wild type .
while the mechanism of this slightly increased ciliary length under lps is currently unclear , it may be resulted from existence of other lps receptors , such as tlr2 , nucleotide oligomerization domain ( nod ) - like receptors ( nlrs ) [ 47 ] , and cannabinoid receptor [ 48 ] .
however , it is obvious that primary cilia or ciliary proteins ( e.g. , hsp27 , kif3a ) modulate inflammatory response by lps because the arl13b protein is lower in tlr4 - / - mice compared to wild type and inflammatory response ( cytokine , nf - kappab activation ) is dependent on kif3a - knockdowned neuronal cells .
more detailed studies on ciliary protein trafficking with nf - kappab activity remains to be pursued .
taken together , our data suggest that tlr4 activation by lps is associated with ciliary function .
the presence and length of cilia are dependent upon various factors , including the expression and activities of ciliary proteins [ 49 ] , inflammation [ 13 ] , and mechanical stress [ 50 ] .
the primary cilium already has known important roles in inflammation .
here , we suggest for the first time that the cilium is also of fundamental importance in neuroinflammation .
the ciliogenesis or expression of the cilia provides a potential therapeutic targets for neuroinflammatory conditions .
conclusions our data revealed that ciliary function could modulate tlr4 - mediated nf - kappab activation and expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
these data were supported by shorter ciliary length in tlr4 - / - mice compared with control and by the increased length of cilia in ca1 pyramidal neurons after lps injection into the hippocampus .
all these data strongly suggest that tlr4 activation in hippocampal neurons is associated with ciliary function .
for the first time , this study revealed novel aspects about the relationship between primary cilia , tlr4 signaling , and nf - kappab activity in hippocampal neurons .
our data highlight the need to investigate the contributions of ciliary proteins to nf - kappab activity or neuroinflammation in greater detail .

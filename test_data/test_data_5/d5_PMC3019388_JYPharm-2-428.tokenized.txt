monitoring of adverse drug reactions of a drug is a continuous process and runs through - out the life of a drug .
many rare adverse effects of a drug are documented after years of use ; when a single case ( signal generation ) is reported leading subsequently to reporting of more cases .
deficiency of vitamin b12 ( vit b12 ) is a known sequel of prolonged metformin therapy .
it was recommended to have annual measurement of serum vit b12 levels in patients on long term metformin therapy way back in 1970 itself .
after more than 50 years of use of metformin , we have come to know that metformin induced vit b12 deficiency can cause neuropathy ; forcing to change the recommendation from annual screening of vit b12 levels to annual supplementation of vit b12 .
metformin neuropathy type 2 diabetes introduction not all hazards of a drug are known before marketing .
some adverse effects of drugs come to fore only after years of use. that is why constant post - marketing monitoring is necessary and why clinicians are expected to report all adverse effects to the regulatory / monitoring agencies .
a single case reported in the medical literature can also lead to the generation of a signal , and subsequently more cases are reported .
this forms the core of pharmacovigilance. [ 1 ] in recent times , rare adverse effects due to long - term metformin therapy have been reported , thus necessitating revision of recommendations .
metformin , a biguanide , was introduced in the united kingdom in 1958 , in canada in 1972 , and in the united states in 1995 .
it is the drug of first choice for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , particularly in overweight and obese people and those with normal kidney function. [ 2 ] as of 2009 , metformin is one of the only two oral antidiabetics in the world health organization model list of essential medicines. [ 3 ] due to this , metformin , either used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin , has become the most widely used antidiabetic drug .
due to widespread use , much is known about its side effects ( ses ) .
the most dreaded se of biguanides , lactic acidosis , is never a problem with judicious use of metformin. [ 4 ] gastrointestinal ses of metformin can be overcome by initiating metformin therapy at a low dose and slowly increasing the dose , by giving metformin after meals , or by utilizing a slow - release metformin preparation. [ 5 ] adverse effects of metformin one well - documented se of metformin is malabsorption of vitamin b12 ( vit b12 ) and consequently low serum levels of the vitamin .
within the first 10 - 12 years after it came into use , it became evident that long - term metformin therapy causes vit b12malabsorption .
prevalence of vit b12malabsorption was found to be 30 % in patients taking long - term metformin therapy , and low serum levels of vit b12were found in approximately 20 % of patients having vit b12malabsorption. [ 6 ] in another study , low serum levels of vit b12 were reported in 17.5 % of patients using 2 g of metformin daily for at least 2 years. [ 7 ] the first case of vit b12 deficiency - induced megaloblastic anemia due to long - term metformin was reported in 1980 .
the patient developed megaloblastic anemia after 8 years of metformin use. [ 8 ] subsequently , more cases were reported .
in 2007 , case of hyperhomocysteinemia - induced deep vein thrombosis was reported , where the hyperhomocysteinemia was apparently caused by long - term metformin therapy - induced vit b12 deficiency. [ 9 ] recently , the first case of peripheral neuropathy due to metformin - induced vit b12 deficiency was reported. [ 10 ] so , what had been feared by early researchers in the field of metformin - induced malabsorption - that metformin can cause subacute combined degeneration of the cord , which can be easily mistaken as diabetic neuropathy - has proved true. [ 67 ] revisting metformin annual measurement of serum vit b12 levels in patients on long - term metformin therapy was recommended way back in 1970s. [ 6 - 8 ] however , given the present setup of primary care centers in developing countries , with the lack of adequate laboratory facilities , it is doubtful that such monitoring will be possible in all diabetic patients. [ 1112 ] in any case , this is hardly the routinely - followed method in patients on metformin therapy .
moreover , cost - effectiveness of annual measurement of vit b12 levels will also need to be considered , given that the incidence of type 2 diabetes is on the rise .
also , it must be remembered that vit b12 deficiency - induced neuropathy precedes the appearance of megaloblastic anemia .
while the anemia of vitamin b12 deficiency is reversible , the progress of the neuropathy is only arrested and not reversed with initiation of vit b12 therapy .
even after measurement of low vit b12 levels , the differential diagnosis from other causes of vit b12 deficiency will be difficult to make .
the fact that the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy resemble metformin - induced neuropathy will add to the confusion .
thus , annual injections of vit b12 ( in a dose of 1 mg ) given to every patient on long - term metformin therapy will be a more practical and cost - effective method .
this method will ensure replenishment of vit b12 stores for at least 1 year .
it will also obviate the need for annual screening of vit b12 levels .

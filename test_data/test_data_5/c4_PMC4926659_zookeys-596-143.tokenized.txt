the new species is the tenth species of varicus , all of which occur below traditional scuba depths in the wider caribbean area .
its placement in the genus varicus is supported by a molecular phylogenetic analysis of three nuclear genes and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. in addition , the new species has one anal - fin pterygiophore inserted anterior to the first haemal spine , which distinguishes varicus species from most species in the closely related and morphologically similar genus psilotris .
varicus lacerta sp. n. is distinguished from all other named species of varicus by the absence of scales , having highly branched , feather - like pelvic - fin rays , and in its live coloration .
we provide the cytochrome c oxidase i dna barcode of the holotype and compare color patterns of all species of varicus and psilotris for which color photographs or illustrations are available .
this study is one of several recent studies demonstrating the utility of manned submersibles in exploring the diversity of poorly studied but species - rich deep - reef habitats .

doi : 10.3897 / zookeys.596.8217 introduction operating out of substation curacao ( www.substation - curacao.com ) , the smithsonian institution 's deep reef observation project ( drop ) uses the manned submersible curasub to capture tropical marine fishes and invertebrates at depths up to 300 m , providing new information on the fauna that inhabits poorly studied deep - reef ecosystems .
drop 's exploratory submersible diving in the southern caribbean has led to the discovery of a cache of undescribed fish biodiversity , some of which has been recently described ( van tassell et al .
2012 ; baldwin and johnson 2013 ; baldwin and robertson 2013 , 2014 , 2015 ; tornabene et al .
2016 ) .
many of the new species belong to the gobiidae , most notably the tribe gobiosomatini ( van tassell et al. 2012 ; tornabene et al. 2016 ) .
this tribe comprises the american seven - spined gobies , a taxonomically and ecologically diverse clade of fishes that is endemic to the western atlantic and eastern pacific oceans .
a repeated pattern of rapid speciation via microhabitat specialization in this tribe has resulted in the gobiosomatini becoming a model group for the study of adaptive radiation in the marine environment ( ruber et al. 2003 ; taylor and hellberg 2005 ; tornabene et al. in press ) .
one of the most ecologically and taxonomically diverse clades within the gobiosomatini is the nes subgroup , which comprises 39 species in 11 genera that inhabit a wide variety of marine habitats ( tornabene et al. 2016 ) .
within the nes subgroup , three genera have species described from mesophotic reefs below 50 m : pinnichthys gilmore , van tassell & tornabene , 2016 , with four species , all from deep reefs ; psilotris ginsburg , 1953 , with six species , one from deep reefs ; and varicus robins & bohlke , 1961 with nine species prior to this study , all from deep reefs ( tornabene et al. 2016 ) .
here we describe a tenth deep - reef species of varicus based on a single specimen that was collected at 129 - 147 m from curacao .
materials and methods the new species was collected using the curasub manned submersible .
the sub has two hydraulic arms , one equipped with a suction hose and the other with a quinaldine - ejection system used to anaesthetize fishes .
specimens collected with the suction hose are deposited into a vented acrylic cylinder attached to the outside of the sub .
the captured holotype was brought to the surface alive , where it was photographed and tissue sampled prior to fixation in 10 % buffered formalin and subsequent storage in 75 % ethanol .
tissue from the holotype was stored in saturated salt - dmso ( dimethyl sulfoxide ) buffer ( seutin et al. 1991 ) .
dna extraction and cytochrome c oxidase subunit i ( coi ) dna barcoding were performed as outlined by weigt et al .
( 2012 ) .
to confirm the phylogenetic placement of the new species we also sequenced the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and the nuclear genes rag1 , sreb2 , and zic1 .
following nomenclature of chakrabarty et al .
( 2013 ) , new sequences here constitute genseq - 1 coi , cytb , rag1 , sreb2 , and zic1 .
primers and pcr conditions for amplifying these four loci were identical to those used in agoretta et al .
( 2013 ) .
sequences generated here were aligned with gobiosomatini sequences from tornabene et al .
( 2016 ) in geneious v .
9 ( biomatters , ltd. , auckland ) .
substitution model choice and partitioning scheme were assessed using partitionfinder ( lanfear et al. 2012 ) .
phylogeny was inferred using bayesian inference in the program mrbayes ver .
3.2 , using two metropolis - coupled markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) runs , each with four chains .
the analysis was run for 10 million generations sampling trees and parameters every 1000 generations .
burn - in , convergence and mixing were assessed using tracer ( rambaut and drummond 2007 ) and by visually inspecting consensus trees from both runs .
all measurements were taken with digital calipers to the nearest 0.1 mm. vertebral counts and pterygiophore patterns were taken from digital radiographs .
dorsal pterygiophore formula is that of birdsong et al .
( 1988 ) , and head pore terminology follows akihito et al .
( 1988 ) .
sensory papillae are described following the terminology of sanzo ( 1911 ) , with the exception that the interorbital series follows terminology described by tornabene et al .
( 2016 ) .
all other morphological characters are as defined by bohlke and robins ( 1968 ) as modified by van tassell et al .
( 2012 ) , who like many authors , differentiate the unsegmented spine from the segmented rays of the second dorsal , anal , and pelvic fins using the roman numeral ' i ' for the spine followed by arabic numbers for the soft rays .
the holotype was deposited at the national museum of natural history , smithsonian institution ( usnm ) .

the only known specimen was collected at 129 - 143 m. quinaldine was dispersed around a yellow sponge (~ 20 cm tall ) tentatively identified from videos by allen collins ( national marine fisheries service ) as dactylocalyx pumiceus , situated on a rocky outcropping along the deep - reef slope .
after approximately 20 seconds the stunned fish emerged from a space in the rocky substrate at the base of the sponge and was captured .
it is unclear whether the fish was originally in direct association with the sponge itself or was instead sheltering in spaces within the rock .
video of the capture taken from a high - definition video camera mounted on the outside of the curasub is available online ( https :// youtu.be / uvxjei - ver0 ) .
subsequent collections targeting similar sponges and rocky substrates within this depth range at the type locality have not yielded additional specimens. distribution .
known only from the type location in curacao. etymology .
the specific epithet ' lacerta ' ( latin for ' lizard ') is in reference to the reptilian or saurian appearance of this species , as indicated by its bright yellow and orange coloration , green eyes , disproportionately large head possessing raised ridges of papilla , and multiple rows of recurved canine teeth in each jaw .
the common name godzilla goby ( gobio godzilla in spanish ) refers to the radioactive reptilian monster from the sea that appeared in japanese science - fiction films as gojira , renamed godzilla in subsequent english - language films .
discussion and comparisons the molecular phylogeny ( fig. 1 ) shows the new species nested within the genus varicus , where it is recovered as sister to an undescribed species varicus sp .
1 from curacao .
this undescribed species is represented by a single specimen in poor condition that also lacks body scales , but is readily distinguishable from varicus lacerta based on live coloration ( see below ) .
varicus lacerta is easily distinguished from all described congeners by the absence of scales on the body and the presence of highly branched , feather - like pelvic - fin rays 1 - 4 .
varicus decorum van tassell , baldwin & tornabene , 2016 , lacks scales on most of the body , but possesses a pair of small , ctenoid scales on each side of the caudal peduncle near the base of the caudal fin , which are absent in varicus lacerta .
live coloration also easily distinguishes varicus lacerta from all other species of varicus for which the live color pattern is known ( fig. 6 ) .
while varicus lacerta has a color pattern of indistinct broad dark bars on a yellowish body , in five other varicus species ( varicus cephalocellatus gilmore , van tassell & baldwin , 2016 , varicus decorum , varicus nigritus gilmore van tasell & baldwin , 2016 , varicus sp .
1 , and varicus veliguttatus van tassell , baldwin & gilmore , 2016 ) the color pattern comprises blotches and spots of yellow or black on a white body .
varicus lacerta differs from varicus adamsi gilmore , van tassell & tornabene , 2016 , and varicus vespa hastings & bortone ( 1981 ) , in having indistinct broad dark bars on a yellowish body and yellow median fins vs narrow yellow bars on a white body and white median fins with black edges in varicus adamsi , and narrow brown bars on a white body and white fins with black borders in varicus vespa .
while varicus lacerta has a yellowish body with indistinct broad dark bars , uniformly yellow dorsal and caudal fins , and a yellow anal fin accentuated with dark orange , in varicus marilynae gilmore , 1979 the body is yellow above , reddish orange below , the body bars are narrow , green - edged and dark brown , the dorsal and tail fins have narrow yellow stripes and bars , and the anal fin is red with a black border .

photos of varicus bucca and varicus benthonis not available .
the absence of scales and the presence of highly branched pelvic rays without fleshy tips make this species superficially similar to species of psilotris .
no single morphological character unambiguously distinguishes varicus from psilotris , but the most consistent morphological feature thus far is the presence of a single anal - fin pterygiophore inserted before the first haemal spine in varicus versus two in all but one species of psilotris .
psilotris laurae van tassell , tornabene & baldwin , 2016 , has a single pterygiophore anterior to the haemal spine , and it is the only known deep - reef species of psilotris .
the relationship between anal - fin pterygiophore pattern and habitat depth warrants further investigation .
despite the morphological similarities between varicus lacerta and species of psilotris , the new species is easily distinguished by live coloration ( fig. 7 ) .
only three members of psilotris have discrete body bars : psilotris alepis ginsburg , 1953 , with irregular grey bars on a white body speckled with black and brown ; psilotris celsa bohlke , 1963 , with irregular narrow orange bars on a white body and head ; and psilotris laurae , with narrow , strongly defined dark - yellow bars on a white head and body .
psilotris boehlkei greenfield , 1993 , psilotris kaufmani greenfield , findley & johnson , 1993 , and psilotris laetarii van tassell & young , 2016 , lack bars .
varicus lacerta can also be distinguished from psilotris boehlkei , psilotris celsa , psilotris kaufmani and psilotris laurae by having i,7 anal - fin rays ( vs. > i,7 ; table 1 ) , and from psilotris alepis , psilotris celsa , and psilotris laetarii in having 18 pectoral - fin rays ( vs. < 18 ; table 1 ) .
the connection of papillae rows 5i and 5s further distinguishes varicus lacerta from psilotris alepis and psilotris boehlkei , in which rows 5i and 5s are separate .

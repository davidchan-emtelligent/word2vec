background the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is being assessed as an alternative model organism as part of an interagency effort to develop better means to test potentially toxic substances .
as part of this effort , assays that use the copas biosort flow sorting technology to record optical measurements ( time of flight ( tof ) and extinction ( ext )) of individual nematodes under various chemical exposure conditions are being developed .
a mathematical model has been created that uses biosort data to quantitatively and qualitatively describe c. elegans growth , and link changes in growth rates to biological events .
chlorpyrifos , an organophosphate pesticide known to cause developmental delays and malformations in mammals , was used as a model toxicant to test the applicability of the growth model for in vivo toxicological testing .
methodology / principal findings l1 larval nematodes were exposed to a range of sub - lethal chlorpyrifos concentrations ( 0 - 75 microm ) and measured every 12 h. in the absence of toxicant , c. elegans matured from l1s to gravid adults by 60 h. a mathematical model was used to estimate nematode size distributions at various times .
mathematical modeling of the distributions allowed the number of measured nematodes and log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) growth rates to be estimated .
the model revealed three distinct growth phases .
the points at which estimated growth rates changed ( change points ) were constant across the ten chlorpyrifos concentrations .
concentration response curves with respect to several model - estimated quantities ( numbers of measured nematodes , mean log ( tof ) and log ( ext ) , growth rates , and time to reach change points ) showed a significant decrease in c. elegans growth with increasing chlorpyrifos concentration .
conclusions effects of chlorpyrifos on c. elegans growth and development were mathematically modeled .
statistical tests confirmed a significant concentration effect on several model endpoints .
this confirmed that chlorpyrifos affects c. elegans development in a concentration dependent manner .
the most noticeable effect on growth occurred during early larval stages : l2 and l3 .
this study supports the utility of the c. elegans growth assay and mathematical modeling in determining the effects of potentially toxic substances in an alternative model organism using high - throughput technologies .
introduction the u. s. environmental protection agency estimates that there are at least 10,000 chemicals that require testing to evaluate their potential threat to human and environmental health [ 1 ] .
due to the need to screen such a large number of chemicals , three government agencies ; the environmental protection agency , national toxicology program and the nih chemical genomics center ; signed an agreement to transform predictive toxicity testing from mainly in vivo mammalian studies to tests using alternative species and in vitro high - throughput screens [ 2 ] .
the goals are to ( a ) develop reliable assays using alternative organisms or cell - based assays , ( b ) collect high - quality data using those assays , and then ( c ) assess whether those data can predict human toxicity .
one alternative animal model that has proven useful in toxicological research is the nematode caenorhabditis elegans [ 3 ] .
a strength of c. elegans as a model organism is the high degree of evolutionary conservation in its biological processes [ 4 ] .
in addition , many of the stress response pathways , including those induced by exposure to environmental chemicals , are well - conserved [ 5 ]. c. elegans are self - fertilizing hermaphrodites that produce hundreds of genetically - identical offspring over several days of adulthood. c. elegans hatch into their first larval stage ( l1 ) and continue to develop to adults through three additional distinct larval stages , l2 - l4 [ 6 ]. between each larval stage , nematodes grow in bursts by molting old cuticles [ 7 ]. c. elegans cultures can be synchronized by hatching embryos in the absence of food , causing l1 development to arrest [ 8 ] .
the l1 larvae resume normal growth when food is introduced and mature as a synchronous population to gravid adults in approximately 60 h at 20degreesc [ 9 ] .
observations of up to 6,000 c. elegans / per minute can be made using the copas biosort flow sorting system , which is designed to sort , dispense and measure various parameters of individual nematodes [ 10 ] .
the biosort measures and records up to four attributes for each individual : time of flight ( tof ) , which relates to nematode length ; extinction ( ext ) , which corresponds to the optical density ; and two fluorescence measurements .
tof and ext measurements are related to the age and size of the nematode ; both increase as c. elegans develop .
assays and analytical methods have been developed that utilize the biosort output to answer questions about c. elegans biology and the effects of toxicants [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
a growth assay in which synchronized l1s are loaded into 96 well plates , incubated in the presence of toxicants , and their size distribution measured at later times has been developed .
to accurately measure c. elegans growth in the presence and absence of toxicants , a mathematical model that describes changes in c. elegans size distributions as increases in ext and tof during nematode maturation was created [ 14 ] .
a mathematical model was necessary to estimate c. elegans growth rates and size distributions due to the nature of the data generated by the biosort , which were not directly amenable to rigorous statistical analysis .
the biosort provides ext and tof measurements of each nematode at loading ( t = 0 h ) and of the same set of nematodes at the end of the growth period .
initial measurements on an individual nematode , however , can not be matched to its final measurements at the end of the study .
this type of data contrasts with growth measurements using cell culture , in which changes in the population are represented by single values ( e.g. , optical density , total cell number ) , or larger animal data in which changes in the growth ( e.g. , weight , height ) can be assigned to an individual subject .
therefore , the c. elegans growth model mathematically describes the distributions of measurements on a set of nematodes , allowing means and average growth rates to be calculated .
one feature of the biosort data that also needed to be addressed by the model was the presence of extraneous material such as shed cuticles or clumps of bacteria , which accumulate as c. elegans develop over time .
measurements on this extraneous material can not be automatically distinguished from those on the nematodes , and thus could affect statistical analyses. by mathematically modeling the distribution of measurements on the extraneous material , the model accounts for the extraneous matter and allows for a more accurate analysis of nematode growth .
in the present report , the growth model has been applied to test its effectiveness in detecting statistically significant differences in c. elegans development in the presence of a toxicant .
the output from the analysis includes the effects of toxicant concentration and exposure time on three phases of c. elegans growth .
to test and refine the growth assay , c. elegans were exposed to the environmentally - relevant , developmental neurotoxicant : chlorpyrifos .
chlorpyrifos is one of the most commonly applied organophosphate pesticides [ 15 ] .
organophosphate pesticides constitute almost half of all of the insecticides used worldwide [ 16 ] .
in addition to its activity as a cholinesterase inhibitor , data suggest that chlorpyrifos may cause decreased dna synthesis and developmental alterations [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
growth retardation has also been observed in children exposed to chlorpyrifos in utero [ 19 ] .
due to adverse human and environmental health effects , chlorpyrifos has been banned for use in homes , schools , and hospitals [ 20 ] .
ext and tof measurements on nematodes exposed to various chlorpyrifos concentrations were sampled over a 72 h period .
estimated numbers of nematodes and average growth rates based on ext and tof measurements were then calculated using the model .
these estimates showed significant decreases in both numbers of nematodes and their growth rates as a function of chlorpyrifos concentration .
in addition , l2 and l3 larvae were the most sensitive to chlorpyrifos exposure .
results c. elegans growth and model data from the two chlorpyrifos exposure studies were combined and analyzed using the c. elegans markov growth model [ 14 ] .
each study consisted of thirty - six cohorts each containing 300 l1 nematodes .
six cohorts were exposed to one of five chlorpyrifos concentrations or an untreated control .
following 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , and 72 h incubations at 20degreesc , one cohort at each concentration was measured in the biosort to determine its distribution of ext and tof .
distributions of log ( ext ) at each of the six time points for the control cohorts are presented in figure 1 .
these distributions shifted to the right with increasing incubation time ; l1s loaded at t = 0 h had a peak frequency at log ( ext ) value near 3.1 , while nematodes observed following 60 h and 72 h incubations had peak frequency at log ( ext ) values near 6.3 .
optical density , as measured by ext , tends to increase as nematodes mature [ 10 ] .
microscopic observations showed that l1 nematodes matured to l2s by 12 h , l3s by 24 h , l4s by 48 h , and adults by 60 h. after 60 h , adults showed a small increase in optical density but mainly produced offspring .
the large numbers of measurements with log ( ext ) values between 2 to 3.4 observed at 60 h and 72 h included unhatched embryos laid by the adults and the next generation of l1 larvae .

nematode frequency distributions of log ( ext ) values for control nematode cohorts sampled at loading 0 h ( brown ) and following 12 ( green ) , 24 ( light blue ) , 36 ( purple ) , 48 ( black ) , 60 ( dark blue ) , and 72 ( red ) h incubations .
large modes to the left of the loaded nematodes ( log ( ext ) =~ 2 - 3 ) indicate the second generation of embryos corresponding to 60 and 72 h cohorts .
vertical lines at log ( ext ) = 3.83 and 6.04 divide the growth response into three sections : initial growth from starved l1s , larval growth from l2 to l4 , and adult growth , respectively .
under normal conditions c. elegans growth was thought to be approximately exponential [ 21 ] ; therefore , growth rates with respect to either log ( ext ) or log ( tof ) should be fairly constant .
we previously reported , however , that the best fitting model for either log ( ext ) or log ( tof ) contained three separate growth rates , separated by two change points [ 14 ] .
the three sections in control nematodes are indicated in figure 1 by vertical lines : log ( ext ) = 3.83 and 6.04 .
microscopic observations indicated that these sections contained embryos and l1s ( 2 - 3.83 ) ; l2 , l3 and l4 larvae ( 3.83 - 6.04 ) ; and adults ( 6.04 - 7.00 ) .
effect of chlorpyrifos on the nematode frequency distribution chlorpyrifos was used to study the applicability of the mathematical model in determining the effects of chemicals on c. elegans growth .
two experiments using different ranges of sub - lethal chlorpyrifos concentrations , 0 - 50 and 0 - 75 microm , were performed and the data combined to determine the effects on growth .
the lowest concentration ( 0.5 microm ) did not affect growth compared to untreated controls and the highest concentration ( 75 microm ) completely inhibited growth , as determined by microscopic observation .
frequency distributions for log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) at each time point for the first experiment are presented in figure 2 .
the frequency distributions for the second experiment are in supporting information file s1 .

frequency distributions of log ( ext ) ( left column ) and log ( tof ) ( right column ) on nematodes exposed to 0 , 0.5 , 5 , 15 , 30 , and 50 microm chlorpyrifos following 12 ( green ) , 24 ( light blue ) , 36 ( purple ) , 48 ( black ) , 60 ( dark blue ) , and 72 ( red ) h incubations .
vertical lines indicate change points at log ( ext ) = 3.83 and 6.04 and log ( tof ) = 4.04 and 5.28 .
at the lowest concentration of chlorpyrifos tested ( 0.5 microm ) , the frequency distribution at each time point was nearly identical to that observed in control nematodes , indicating that chlorpyrifos did not affect c. elegans development .
furthermore , the close similarity at 60 and 72 h suggested that control nematodes and those exposed to 0.5 microm chlorpyrifos had fully developed to reproductive adults by 60 h ( fig. 2 and supporting information file s1 ) .
above 0.5 microm , concentration - dependent decreases in growth were observed .
at the highest concentration tested , 75 microm , the distributions did not shift to the right with time ( supporting information file s1 ) , suggesting that 75 microm chlorpyrifos completely inhibited nematode growth .
nematodes exposed to chlorpyrifos concentrations greater than 45 microm did not develop beyond the second change point within 72 h ( fig. 2 , supporting information file s1 ) .
microscopic observations made at 72 h verified that , at concentrations below 30 microm , nematodes developed to the adult stage , but were smaller in size. c. elegans exposed to concentrations greater than 30 microm did not reach adulthood and at 75 microm did not develop beyond the l2 stage ( supporting information file s1 ) .
the observed and model - estimated frequency distributions of log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) values for cohorts exposed to 30 microm are presented in figure 3 .
plots for other concentrations are presented in supporting information file s2 for log ( ext ) and supporting information file s3 for log ( tof ) measurements .
extraneous matter ; such as detritus , clumps of bacteria , and embryos ; can not be distinguished from nematodes directly from log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) measurements .
for this reason , measurements were modeled using a mixture of a markov model for the nematodes and a lognormal distribution for the extraneous matter ( see methods ) .
this mixture model accurately described the distributions of log ( tof ) and log ( ext ) at each time point ( i.e. , compare red lines versus blue lines in figure 3 ) .
at all exposure levels and time points , model - predicted frequency distributions agreed well with the observed frequency distributions .
( it should be noted that the word prediction is used in this paper to refer to estimates made from the model after optimization , much as any calculated output from any model may be referred as a prediction .
it does not refer to predictions made for use with other data or in different circumstances .
the value of the model for the analysis in this paper lies in the estimation of growth rates of nematodes over time under specific conditions , including exposures to possible toxicants . )

vertical lines indicate change points where growth rates changed at log ( ext ) = 3.83 and 6.04 and log ( tof ) = 4.04 and 5.28 .
change points were constant over time and concentration , but differed between log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) .
data for other chlorpyrifos concentrations are shown in supporting information files s2 ( log ( ext )) and s3 ( log ( tof )) .
effect of chlorpyrifos on c. elegans growth although the chlorpyrifos concentrations were chosen to be sub - lethal , the model - estimated numbers of nematodes significantly decreased with increasing concentration ( page test ; p < 0.001 ) .
estimated numbers of nematodes , as well as all other parameter estimates , are presented in supporting information file s4 .
the estimated mean log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) as functions of chlorpyrifos concentration and observation times are presented in figure 4 .
these means diminished significantly as a function of chlorpyrifos concentration at each time point ( by linear regression , p < 0.01 for log ( ext ) ; p < 0.05 for log ( tof )) ( table 1 ) .
the strength of the concentration effects , as indicated by the magnitude of the slopes , also increased with exposure time .
taken together , these observations indicate that chlorpyrifos inhibits c. elegans growth in a concentration - and exposure time - dependent fashion .

a regression line for the 72 h log ( tof ) data is not presented because there was no significant growth between 60 h and 72 h .

the estimated means are shown in figure 4 .
for nematodes exposed to 0 and 0.5 microm chlorpyrifos , growth was completed by 60 h , so neither the tof nor ext measurement changed between 60 and 72 h ( fig. 2 ) .
likewise , nematodes exposed to 75 microm chlorpyrifos grew very little over time , based on the extensive overlap in the distributions of log ( tof ) among the time points ( supporting information file s1 ) .
previously , it was demonstrated that tof measurements are generally more variable than ext , and thus have a greater tendency to overlap [ 14 ] .
in these cases where there is little to no change in tof or ext , growth rates can not be estimated by the mathematical model .
the growth model predicts three separate constant growth rates with respect to log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) measurements .
the two points at which the growth rate changes , ' change points ' , are marked by vertical lines in figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ; and divide the log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) ranges into 3 sections .
varying the change points for nematodes exposed to different chlorpyrifos concentrations did not improve the model fit ; therefore change points were held constant for all concentrations at 3.83 and 6.04 for log ( ext ) and at 4.04 and 5.28 for log ( tof ) .
to analyze the effects of chlorpyrifos on the estimated growth rates , a negative exponential function , , was fit to the growth rates in each of the three sections as functions of concentration ( fig. 5 ; equations for each section are presented in supporting information file s5 ) .
the strength of the chlorpyrifos effect on the growth rate is indicated by b. the final models for the three sections were chosen using the akaike information criterion [ 22 ] .
for every section , b was significantly greater than zero , indicating a significant inhibitory effect of chlorpyrifos on growth .
in addition , the effect increased with increasing chlorpyrifos concentration for each of the three sections , further indicating concentration dependent growth inhibition ( fig. 5 ; table 2 ) .
the functions eventually reached the same minimum growth rate for all three sections ( fig. 5 ) , which may represent the minimum growth rate that the model could detect .

the expected length of time needed for a nematode to reach each change point was computed from the estimated growth rates ( fig. 6 ) , and then straight lines were fit as functions of concentration .
the final models for both change points were chosen using the akaike information criterion [ 22 ] .
the expected time for l1s to develop and reach the first change point was similar in the controls for both log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) , approximately 10 h , and increased significantly with chlorpyrifos concentration .
expected length of time to reach the first change point , based on optical density ( log ( ext )) , was somewhat more affected by increasing chlorpyrifos concentration than that based on nematode length ( log ( tof )) , as indicated by the steeper slope ( fig. 6 ) .
these results are consistent with the visual observations that chlorpyrifos - exposed nematodes appeared to be starved and thinner than controls , but not shorter in length ( table 3 ) .
the expected length of time for l1s to develop to the second change point also showed a concentration - dependent increase for both log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) .
these observations further demonstrate the inhibitory effects of chlorpyrifos on growth .
in contrast to the time to reach the first change point , for the second change point there was a consistent 17 h difference between log ( tof ) and log ( ext ) , regardless of chlorpyrifos concentration .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0007024.g006 figure 6 effect of chlorpyrifos on the estimated times to change points .
regression lines correspond to the time required for the c. elegans cohort to develop to the first ( dotted line ) or the second ( solid line ) change point for log ( ext ) ( red ) and log ( tof ) ( blue ) values .
for the first change point , log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) times at lower chlorpyrifos concentrations ( 0.5 and 0.75 microm ) are indistinguishable from control nematodes while , at higher concentrations , log ( ext ) was more affected than log ( tof ) .
in contrast , the difference in time to reach the second change point between log ( tof ) and log ( ext ) is 17 h , regardless of chlorpyrifos concentration .

effect of chlorpyrifos on change points although numbers of nematodes and their growth rates were affected by chlorpyrifos concentration , the positions of the estimated change points for both log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) were unaffected. that is , the rates for the three phases of c. elegans growth were affected by chlorpyrifos , but the log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) values during c. elegans development at which growth rates changed remained the same .
microscopic observations of non - exposed nematodes at the change points indicated that the first change point coincided with the l1 to l2 molt , while the second change point occurred near the l3 to l4 molt for log ( tof ) , and at the onset of egg production in young adults for log ( ext ) values ( table 3 ) .
microscopic observations of selected chlorpyrifos - exposed nematodes were made at times corresponding to the change points : observations made at the times corresponding to first change point for both ext and tof ( table 3a ) ; observations made near the expected time for the second log ( tof ) change point ( table 3b ) ; and observations made near the expected time for the second change point for the log ( ext ) measurements ( table 3c ) .
while chlorpyrifos increased the time to reach each change point , it did not substantially alter the composition of the cohort ( table 3b and 3c ) .
thus , the growth rates during these phases of c. elegans growth were affected by chlorpyrifos , but the biological events that occurred at the three change points during development were not affected by chlorpyrifos .
combining the information on the effects of chlorpyrifos on the time required to reach the change points ( fig. 6 ) with the visual observations of c. elegans at the change points ( table 3 ) led to the conclusion that the greatest developmental effect of chlorpyrifos was to increase the duration of the l2 and l3 larval stages and to delay the l3 / l4 molt .
for control nematodes , the length of time between the l1 / l2 molt ( first log ( tof ) change point ) and the l3 / l4 molt ( second log ( tof ) change point ) was approximately 27 h for control nematodes and was 52 h for nematodes exposed to 50 microm chlorpyrifos .
in contrast , the length of time between the l3 / l4 molt ( second log ( tof ) change point ) and the onset of egg production ( second log ( ext ) change point ) remained constant at about 17 h , regardless of level of exposure .
thus , once nematodes reached the l3 / l4 molt , further development was not significantly affected by chlorpyrifos .
discussion chemical effects on c. elegans can be quantified using a variety of endpoints such as feeding behavior , locomotion , and egg - laying [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 23 ] .
in this report , the applicability of a quantitative medium - throughput growth assay , analyzed using a mathematical model to determine the effects of chemicals on c. elegans was presented .
these results confirmed the validity of this model , which provided information on chemical - induced changes in numbers of nematodes and growth rates .
in addition , the concentration dependence of these effects was clearly demonstrated and quantified .
many c. elegans studies have reported the measurement of abnormal growth phenotypes , mainly by measuring the delay to a predetermined developmental stage such as molting .
the timing of molts , however , and the regulation of developmental rates within each larval stage have been poorly characterized [ 24 ] .
several studies have measured nematode length or volume using microscope reticles or image capture software [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
although these methods are quantitative , they are tedious and can only be used to characterize small numbers of nematodes , and thus have limited statistical power .
the copas biosort is able to rapidly record measurements of length and optical density on large numbers of nematodes .
until now however , the data provided by the biosort have not been quantitatively analyzed in a way that provides insight into the biology associated with chemical treatments .
in applying the markov model for growth [ 14 ] to nematodes exposed to the developmental toxicant chlorpyrifos , concentration effects can be accurately described .
once properly described , statistical tests for significance in changes in numbers of nematodes , mean log ( ext ) or log ( tof ) values , or estimated growth rates can be determined .
the optimal form of the model describes growth as piecewise linear over time , based on both log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) .
the times at which the growth rates change , referred to as change points , are associated with l1 to l2 molts for both log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) , l3 to l4 molts for log ( tof ) , and the onset of egg production in young adults for log ( ext ) [ 14 ] .
visual examination of nematodes near the estimated times for growth rate change in the current study verified that these characterizations are reproducible between different studies .
in addition , while exposure to chlorpyrifos prolongs the times to reach the change points , it does not significantly change the composition of the cohort of nematodes at the change points .
thus , this model provides a link between rapidly produced biosort data and biological events such as specific molts or onset of egg production .
the effect of chlorpyrifos exposure on the time required to reach a change point was not proportional to the toxicant concentration at all stages of development .
the length of time between the l1 / l2 molt and the l3 / l4 molt increased from approximately 27 h for untreated nematodes to 52 h for nematodes exposed to 50 microm chlorpyrifos .
the length of time between the l3 / l4 molt and onset of egg production , however , was concentration independent and remained constant at 17 h. the difference between the second log ( tof ) change point ( l3 / l4 molt ) and the second log ( ext ) change point ( onset of egg production in adulthood ) were consistent with published observations , which showed that at 20degreesc the l4 / adult molt occurred approximately 13 h after the l3 / l4 molt and the first embryos were laid 21.5 h after the l3 / l4 molt [ 21 ] .
thus , in addition to characterizing an overall inhibition of nematode growth by chlorpyrifos , l2 and l3 larvae were identified as more susceptible to chlorpyrifos toxicity than later larvae or adults .
exposure to chlorpyrifos in mammalian systems is associated with the inhibition of neuronal development [ 27 ] .
interestingly , the development of much of the ventral nervous system in c. elegans occurs during the early larval stages [ 28 ] .
an additional 80 neurons (~ 30 % of the c. elegans nervous system ) are born during l1 and l2 stages [ 28 ] .
the growth assay may have also identified a relation between the growth inhibitory effects associated with chlorpyrifos exposure and neural development .
this suggests that this assay may identify subtle effects of toxicant exposure during specific periods in c. elegans development .
additional studies will be required to confirm a neurodevelopmental affect of chlorpyrifos exposure. c. elegans growth and development are known to be substantially affected by exposure to aldicarb , another cholinesterase inhibitor [ 29 ] .
prolonged exposure or exposure to high doses of aldicarb may also decrease feeding , leading to an indirect effect on nematode growth [ 26 ] .
the effect of chlorpyrifos on c. elegans feeding , as measured by the accumulation of fluorescent - labeled microspheres , has been previously reported .
a 50 % inhibition of feeding at 1.3 microm chlorpyrifos ( 95 % c.i. = 0 - 9.2 ) was observed [ 11 ] .
in this study , nematodes were observed with a ' starved ' appearance following exposure to chlorpyrifos concentrations greater than 7.5 microm ( table 3 ) .
this suggests that starvation may be a contributing factor to chlorpyrifos - induced growth inhibition .
conclusion a hallmark of high - throughput screening is automation of data collection , which rapidly produces large quantities of data .
linking quantitative data to biological events allows for the interpretation of trends and differences .
in this report , high - throughput data from the biosort was combined with a mathematical model of c. elegans growth .
modeling of c. elegans development allowed for the estimation of several growth parameters including number of nematodes , mean population distribution , and growth rates .
statistical analyses of these parameters showed concentration - dependent decreases in both numbers of nematodes and growth rates as a result of chlorpyrifos exposure .
although chlorpyrifos affected the time to reach the change points , the biological events that occurred at those points were not affected .
in addition , the model indicated that the greatest chlorpyrifos effects occurred during larval stages l2 and l3 .
the precise mechanism by which chlorpyrifos affected c. elegans growth could not be determined using these assays .
regardless of the mechanism of the developmental delay , if the effects of chemicals on c. elegans growth are predictive of mammalian toxicity , then c. elegans assays may prove to be valuable additions to in vivo high - throughput toxicity screens of the large number of chemicals that need to be assayed before mammalian testing .
methods nematode culture the bristol n2 c. elegans strain was obtained from the caenorhabditis genetic center ( minneapolis , mn ) , and maintained at 20degreesc on k - agar plates seeded with e. coli op50 as a food source [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
synchronized l1 cultures were prepared as previously described [ 8 ] , except that embryos were hatched overnight at 20degreesc in vented t25 flasks containing complete k - medium ( 51 mm sodium chloride , 32 mm potassium chloride , 3 mm calcium chloride , 3 mm magnesium sulfate , 13 microm cholesterol ) .
growth assay l1 nematodes were transferred to the sample cup of the copas biosort [ 32 ] - [ 35 ] ( union biometrica inc. , somerville , ma , usa ) and diluted to approximately 1 nematode / microl .
twenty - five l1s were then added to each well of a 96 - well plate , containing a total volume of 50 microl complete k - medium , streptomycin - killed ( 1 mg / kg ) e. coli , diluted to an a550 = 0.5 - 0.55 , and chlorpyrifos ( chem service , westchester , pa ; cas # 2921 - 88 - 2 ) .
chlorpyrifos stocks were prepared in dmso .
the final concentration of dmso used in these studies was 1 % ( v / v ) , a concentration that does not affect nematode growth ( data not shown ) .
two experiments were performed using six different chlorpyrifos concentrations with cohorts measured every 12 h for 72 h. a cohort consisted of 300 nematodes per treatment condition ( 25 nematodes per wellx12 wells ) .
two different concentration series were tested in the two experiments : 0 , 0.5 , 5.0 , 15 , 30 and 50 microm , and 0 , 0.75 , 7.5 , 22.5 , 45 and 75 microm. c. elegans cohorts were incubated without shaking for 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 and 72 h at 20degreesc and then tof and ext measurements of individual nematode were acquired with the copas biosort reflx .
all copas biosort measurements were performed with ext signal gain of 80 , ext integral gain of 100 , ext signal threshold of 80 , and tof minimum of 10 .
study design and model description both log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) measurements were analyzed using the markov model applied to c. elegans growth previously described [ 14 ] .
briefly , a frequency distribution of measurements is constructed using a grid of bins encompassing the observed range of log ( ext ) or log ( tof ) values .
growth of nematodes is modeled by assuming that over each 12 h interval , nematodes grow sufficiently that their measurements shift to the right 10 , 11 , or 12 bins .
the probabilities of growing 10 , 11 , or 12 bins are used to define a transfer probability or growth matrix , g. using the distribution of measurements taken at loading , f0 , the distribution of the same cohort at aspiration 12xk h later , fk , is predicted by the formula : ( 1 ) in addition to nematodes , extraneous material accumulated in the wells is also measured by the biosort .
these extraneous measurements , which may be discarded cuticles , clumped bacteria , or chemical precipitates , are not individually separable from nematode measurements .
the extraneous measurements are represented in the model by a lognormal distribution .
the total set of measurements acquired at sampling time k ( nematodes and extraneous ) is modeled as a weighted average of the lognormal distribution and the distribution , fk , predicted by the markov model .
the weights estimated for the lognormal and modeled distributions reflect the fractions of the total measurements ascribed to extraneous observations and nematodes , respectively .
the model allows 12 h growth across a constrained number of bins ( i.e. , 10 , 11 , or 12 ) ; growth rates are reflected by the size of the bins .
using least squares , the difference between observed and estimated frequency distributions of nematodes is minimized by adjusting bin sizes , where larger bins correspond to faster growth rates .
in this study , changes in log ( ext ) and log ( tof ) measurements are best approximated by piecewise constant growth rates , with two change points dividing the range of measurements into three sections .
in addition to estimating growth rates , the expected time for a nematode to reach a change point is calculated by averaging the time needed to shift the required number of bins to the right over the loading distribution .
statistical analysis a distribution - free test for trend ( page test ) , blocking on observation time , was used to test whether concentration - related trends in numbers of nematodes were significant [ 36 ] .
application of the page test requires a balanced design , so the estimated numbers of nematodes for the 72 h aspirations ( available only for the higher concentrations ) could not be used .
the linear associations between exposure concentration and mean log ( ext ) , mean log ( tof ) or time to change points were tested for significance using standard regression tests ( f - tests ; [ 37 ]) .
negative exponential curves were fit to the estimated growth rates , and straight lines were fit to the estimated times to change points .
optimal models for growth rates and times to change points were chosen using the akaike information criterion [ 22 ] .

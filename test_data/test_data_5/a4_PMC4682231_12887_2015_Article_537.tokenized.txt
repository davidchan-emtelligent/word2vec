background the diagnosis of lyme neuroborreliosis ( lnb ) in europe is based on clinical symptoms and laboratory data , such as pleocytosis and anti - borrelia antibodies in serum and csf according to guidelines .
however , the decision to start antibiotic treatment on admission cannot be based on borrelia serology since results are not available at the time of lumbar puncture .
therefore , an early prediction test would be useful in clinical practice .
the aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a clinical prediction test for children with lnb in a relevant european setting .
method clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively from a cohort of children being evaluated for lnb in southeast sweden .
a clinical neuroborreliosis prediction test , the nebop score , was designed to differentiate between a high and a low risk of having lnb .
the nebop score was then prospectively validated in a cohort of children being evaluated for lnb in central and southeast sweden ( n = 190 ) and controls with other specific diagnoses ( n = 49 ) .
results the sensitivity of the nebop score was 90 % ( ci 95 % ; 82 - 99 %) and the specificity was 90 % ( ci 95 % ; 85 - 96 %) .
thus , the diagnostic accuracy ( i.e. how the test correctly discriminates patients from controls ) was 90 % and the area under the curve in a roc analysis was 0.95 .
the positive predictive value ( ppv ) was 0.83 ( ci 95 % ; 0.75 - 0.93 ) and the negative predictive value ( npv ) was 0.95 ( ci 95 % ; 0.90 - 0.99 ) .
conclusion the overall diagnostic performance of the nebop score is high ( 90 %) and the test is suggested to be useful for decision - making about early antibiotic treatment in children being evaluated for lnb in european lyme endemic areas .

keywords lyme neuroborreliosis lyme borreliosis predictive test diagnostic accuracy children issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background lyme borreliosis ( lb ) is caused by the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi and is the most common tick - borne infection both in europe and northern america [ 1 , 2 ] .
the infection may give rise to different symptoms by affecting organs such as the skin , joints , heart muscle or nervous system [ 3 - 5 ] .
the diagnosis of lyme neuroborreliosis ( lnb ) in europe is based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings , including pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) and intrathecal anti - borrelia antibody production , in accordance with the guidelines [ 6 ] .
however , the decision to start antibiotic treatment on admission cannot be based on anti - borrelia antibodies in csf , since test results are not available at the time of lumbar puncture .
a prediction test would therefore be useful in clinical practice for decision - making about early start of antibiotic treatment .
previous studies have suggested different clinical prediction rules but patients have not been representative of children with lnb in europe [ 7 - 10 ] .
studies on large representative samples of all children being evaluated for lnb in european lyme endemic areas are warranted .
facial nerve palsy is the most common neurological finding among children with lnb in europe [ 11 , 12 ] , but unspecific symptoms such as fatigue , low - grade fever , nausea and loss of appetite may often occur , without being accompanied with specific neurological findings [ 13 ] .
the clinical picture in children with lnb is similar in central and northern europe [ 14 , 15 ] where the tick vector ixodes ricinus is dominant and borrelia burgdoferi sensu lato ( bb ) is present in mainly three humanpathogenic species ; b. afzelii , b. garinii and bb senso stricto [ 1 ] .
in northern america , there are several different tick vectors and the main human pathogenic species is bb senso stricto [ 2 ] .
it is well known that the clinical picture of lnb in childhood differs in europe compared to northern america , where facial nerve palsy is less frequent but em in combination with neurological symptoms occur more often [ 16 - 18 ] .
consequently , to find a common clinical predictive test valid for paediatric lnb patients on both continents is not feasible .
the aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a clinical prediction test for children with lnb in a relevant european setting .
methods development of a clinical prediction test - the nebop score clinical and laboratory data was collected retrospectively from a large cohort of well - characterized and representative children being evaluated for lnb in southeast sweden during the period ( 2000 - 2005 ) ( n = 177 ) [ 12 ] .
this cohort was used for development and evaluation of the nebop score .
data was analysed in a logistic regression model to find independent and statistically significant variables to discriminate between " confirmed lnb " and " not determined " .
patients in " confirmed lnb " were classified as " definite lnb " patients according to european guidelines at the time [ 1 ] , i.e. the same criteria as now [ 6 ] .
patients in " not determined " were similar to " non lnb " , i.e. patients with acute idiopathic facial nerve palsy , tension headache and patients with unspecific symptoms without lnb diagnosis [ 12 ] .
variables such as age , gender , headache , durations of symptoms , known tick bite or time of the year on admission did not differ between groups .
significant variables that came out in the logistic regression model were : 1 ) acute facial nerve palsy , 2 ) fever 38 - 39 ( o ) c , 3 ) fatigue , 4 ) erythema migrans and / or lymphocytoma , 5 ) pleocytosis in csf ( with total cell count >= 5 x 106 / l with >= 90 % mononuclear cells ) .
out of these five significant variables , the nebop score was designed , including weighed points ( p ) to differentiate between high and low probability of having lnb ( fig. 1 ) .
definitions and instructions to the paediatrician were added to ensure equal and correct interpretation of the patient 's symptoms ( fig. 1 ) .
the nebop score was also pretested on a small group of paediatricians and minor corrections were made to ensure validity. fig. 1 the nebop score , a clinical prediction test for children being evaluated for lyme neuroborreliosis evaluation of cut - off levels for the nebop score the performance of the nebop score at different cut - off levels was evaluated on data from the retrospective patient material [ 12 ] and shown in table 1 .
a high sensitivity ( 100 %) at the best positive predictive value ( 0.60 ) was considered preferential , and the cut - off level was set at 3 points for a positive nebop score ( fig. 1 and table 1 ) .

children and parents / guardians were asked to participate in the study at the admission stage , and patients were consecutively enrolled as a prospective cohort .
this cohort is considered representative for all paediatric patients being evaluated for lnb in a relevant european clinical setting , and is therefore suitable for this present study .
csf and blood samples were taken on admission for laboratory evaluation and the child and parents / guardians completed a standardized questionnaire .
the paediatrician , following preset instructions and definitions , completed the nebop score for each patient on admission , before anti - borrelia antibody results were available and before the patient was diagnosed as lnb or non - lnb .
a two - month evaluation of clinical outcome was part of the study , but no serum samples were taken at follow - up. out of 197 patients included in the study , seven children were excluded because of missing data .
these children ( n = 7 ) did not differ in age or gender from patients included in the study ( n = 190 ) .
control sample for validation of the nebop score children being evaluated and diagnosed with other specific diagnoses during the study period were asked together with parents / guardians to participate in the study and were consecutively enrolled as controls ( n = 49 ) .
patients were not included from all seven paediatric clinics so this control sample cannot be considered as representative of children with each diagnosis .
instead , they represent a diversity of patients with other infectious , immunological and neurological diseases .
controls were children with enteroviral meningitis ( n = 7 ) , unspecified viral meningitis ( n = 6 ) , tick - borne encephalitis ( n = 3 ) , varicella zoster ( n = 1 ) , mycoplasma infection with neurological symptoms but negative pcr in csf ( n = 2 ) , pneumonia with headache and normal csf ( n = 1 ) , post - infectious encephalitis ( n = 3 ) , periodic fever ( n = 1 ) , unspecified autoimmune disease ( n = 1 ) , polyneuropathy ( n = 1 ) , guillain - barre syndrome ( n = 1 ) , multiple sclerosis ( n = 1 ) , myasthenia gravis ( n = 1 ) , narcolepsy ( n = 1 ) , neurofibromatosis type 1 ( n = 1 ) , ischemic stroke ( n = 1 ) , febrile seizure ( n = 1 ) , infantile spasm ( n = 3 ) , epilepsy ( n = 2 ) , idiopathic intracranial hypertension ( n = 2 ) , migraine headache ( n = 3 ) , tension headache ( n = 3 ) , head trauma ( n = 3 ) .
classification of patients and controls according to european guidelines , classification of patients as " definite lnb " and " possible lnb " was based on neurological symptoms indicative for lnb and laboratory findings in csf .
[ 6 ] patients who did not meet the criteria for either of the two groups were classified as " non - lnb " and patients with other specific diagnoses were classified as " controls " ( table 2 ) .

children and parents / guardians in the control group received a similar , but slightly modified , questionnaire .
at the two - month follow - up , questions focused on persistent symptoms and time to recovery .
statistics spss software , version 21 and sisa - binomial were used for statistical calculations .
a logistic regression was used to find independent and statistically significant variables to discriminate between " definite lnb " and " non lnb " in the retrospective cohort as described above .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered significant .
in the present prospective cohort , the diagnostic accuracy of the nebop score was calculated on " definite lnb " and " possible lnb " as patients and " non - lnb " and " controls " as controls .
a receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve with calculated area under the curve ( auc ) was used to illustrate the results ( fig. 2 ). fig. 2 the diagnostic accuracy of the nebop score shown as a roc curve .
the area under the curve ( auc ) was 0.95 ( p < 0.0001 ) .
calculations are based on " definite lnb " ( n = 52 ) and " possible lnb "( n = 31 ) as patients and " non - lnb "( n = 107 ) and " controls "( n = 49 ) as controls .
roc curve = receiver operator characteristic curve ethics informed written consent was received from all children and parents / guardians included in the study .
approval of the study was obtained from the regional ethics committee in uppsala , sweden ( dnr 2010 / 106 ) .
results diagnostic performance of the nebop score results from the nebop score in different diagnostic groups are shown in table 5 .
among children classified as " definite lnb " , 51 out of 52 ( 98 %) had a positive nebop score and among children with " possible lnb " , 24 out of 31 ( 77 %) had a positive test .
the majority of children in " non - lnb " and " controls " had a negative nebop score ( 91 % and 90 % respectively ) ( table 5 ) .

the specificity of the test was 90 % ( 95 % ci ; 85 - 96 %) , calculated on patients with " non - lnb " and " controls " ( table 6 ) .
thus , the overall diagnostic accuracy of the nebop score ( i.e. how the test correctly defines patients and controls ) was 90 % .
results are also shown as a roc curve with an area under the curve ( auc ) of 0.95 ( p < 0.001 ) ( fig. 2 ) .

likelihood ratios ( lr ) are shown in table 6 .
distribution of clinical symptoms and nebop score points the distribution of clinical symptoms and nebop score points among children being evaluated for lnb ( n = 190 ) are shown in fig. 3. among patients with >= 3 p in the nebop score , the most common combination of symptoms was facial nerve palsy , low - grade fever and fatigue in combination with pleocytosis in csf ( fig. 3 ). fig. 3 distribution of clinical symptoms and nebop score points among children being evaluated for lyme neuroborreliosis ( n = 190 ) .
pleo = pleocytosis ( total cell count >= 5 x 106 / l cells in csf with >= 90 % mononuclear cells ) , em = erythema migrans , fp = facial nerve palsy , fe = fever , fa = fatigue , nebop = neuroborreliosis prediction , p = score points with cut - off >= 3 p for a positive test discussion this study shows a high diagnostic accuracy ( 90 %) of the nebop score in children being evaluated for lnb in a northern european lyme endemic area .
consequently , our results support that this clinical predictive test could be useful for paediatricians in early assessment of children being evaluated for lnb .
the nebop score is applicable in lyme endemic areas in central and northern europe since there are known similarities in lnb in childhood [ 15 , 16 ] .
however , the test is not recommended for northern america due to differences in the clinical manifestations of lnb , the occurrence of different tick vectors and different borrelia species between the two continents [ 16 , 17 ] .
admittedly , there are a few patients being incorrectly predicted with using the nebop score in the present study , which needs to be addressed .
among children classified as " definite lnb " , 98 % had a positive nebop score (>= 3 p ) but one patient had negative test ( table 5 ) .
this patient had unilateral abducens palsy with pleocytosis and anti - borrelia antibodies in csf , ( correctly classified as " definite lnb ") but received only 2 nebop score points ( negative test ) .
consequently , the nebop score should also include other cranial nerve palsy since lnb patients may present with both abducens - and / or oculomotorius nerve palsy [ 23 ] .
this detail is added in the final version of the nebop score ( fig. 1 ) .
among children classified as " possible lnb " , the majority ( 77 %) had positive nebop scores whereas seven patients ( 23 %) had negative tests ( table 5 ) .
six of these patients presented with short duration of symptoms ( 1 - 6 days of headache and / or facial nerve palsy ) in combination with pleocytosis in csf , indicating an early lnb .
one patient had anti - borrelia igm antibodies in serum , one had anti - borrelia igg antibodies and one had both igm and anti - borrelia igg antibodies in serum .
all patients responded well to antibiotic treatment .
it is uncertain whether these six patients were lnb patients with negative nebop score due to an untypical distribution of percentage of mononuclear cells in csf ( 40 - 88 % of total cell count in csf ) or whether symptoms actually derive from other etiology .
unfortunately , these patients were not tested for other tick - borne infections or enteroviral pcr in csf .
furthermore , one patient with a negative nebop score in the " possible lnb " group presented with very long duration of symptoms , anti - borrelia igg antibodies in csf but no pleocytosis in csf .
the patient had a history of a previously treated lnb .
findings may indicate persistent symptoms as sequelae after a previous lnb infection ( despite adequate antibiotic treatment ) or ongoing infection without pleocytosis in csf .
the patient again received antibiotic treatment and symptoms were slightly reduced but did not resolve totally .
our results show that the sensitivity of the nebop score is excellent in " definite lnb " , ( 98 %) and acceptable in " possible lnb " ( 77 %) , with an overall sensitivity of 90 % for the two groups together .
thus , the nebop score will help the paediatrician to decide about early antibiotic treatment before test results of anti - borrelia antibodies in serum and csf are available .
regarding the borrelia serology , one should always keep in mind that both anti - borrelia igg and igm antibodies in serum should be interpreted with caution because of low sensitivity and specificity [ 6 ] .
concerning the two control groups in this study , the heterogeneity of the negative controls ( n = 49 ) could be put under further considerations since they represent many different diagnoses without similar clinical manifestations to lnb .
however , when evaluating a predictive test it is of importance to include controls without clinical similarity to patients ( 49 negative controls ) as well as controls with clinical similarity to lnb patients from a clinical relevant setting ( 107 non - lnb patients ) .
we have included these two control groups in our study and we believe the heterogeneity of controls with other diagnosis therefore can be acceptable .
negative controls without any symptoms ( i.e. healthy controls ) could not be included in the study due to the fact that a lumbar puncture cannot be performed on healthy children out of ethical reasons .
a control group including a higher number of patients with enteroviral and / or bacterial meningitis should admittedly have been preferable , which is a weakness of the study .
furthermore , the sample size of negative controls could have been larger than 49 , but it could unfortunately not be achieve during the time period and in clinical setting of the study .
median age and sex distribution do not differ between patients ( table 3 ) and controls ( table 4 ) , which is a strength of the study .
in the " non - lnb " group , 91 % had a negative nebop score (<= 2 p ) indicating a high specificity ( table 5 ) .
however , 10 children ( 9 %) in " non - lnb " scored >= 3 p ( positive test ) .
three of these 10 children had acute facial nerve palsy , fever and fatigue with short duration of symptoms , but no pleocytosis or anti - borrelia antibodies in csf .
these patients may have had idiopathic facial nerve palsy or very early lnb with peripheral cranial nerve palsy but not yet pleocytosis in csf .
furthermore , seven patients in the " non lnb " group scored >= 3 p ( positive test ) due to fever , fatigue and em but had normal csf , indicating a cutaneous lb with systemic symptoms .
these patients are probably incorrectly predicted as lnb by the nebop score and should instead be classified as cutaneous lb and receive treatment as such .
this instruction is added in the final version of the nebop score ( fig. 1 ) .
again , it should be pointed out how important an evaluation of csf is , concerning patients with em and systemic symptoms , since symptoms may indicate an early lnb [ 24 ] .
among controls , four children scored >= 3 p ( positive test ) due to viral meningitis with fatigue and pleocytosis with >= 90 % mononuclear cells in csf , yielding a false positive nebop score .
however , these patients had a clinical picture with clear meningeal symptoms in addition to fever and fatigue , making it easy for the paediatrician to clinically distinguish them from patients with lyme meningitis .
two of them were positive for enterovirus pcr in csf .
one patient among controls had a periodic fever with fatigue , low - grade fever and a red skin lesion similar to an em , which resulted in a misclassification by the nebop score ( 3 p ) .
em is a clinical diagnosis but it is well know that the em skin lesions may be heterogeneous and may result in misdiagnosis [ 24 ] .
in such cases , borrelia serology is not useful due to low sensitivity [ 24 ] .
in our cohort of children , 15 out of 107 patients in " non - lnb " received antibiotic treatment on admission before anti - borrelia antibody results were available .
we believe , based on results from our present study with a npv of 0.95 for the nebop score , that the test will be helpful for the paediatrician to correctly refrain from antibiotic treatment on admission and consider other differential diagnoses while waiting for anti - borrelia antibody results. whether the nebop score is more helpful as a decision tool for the paediatrician in the early assessment of children being evaluated for lnb as compared to the pleocytosis itself , as a single variable , can be discussed .
it has previously been shown that pleocytosis with >= 90 % mononuclear cells in csf clearly discriminates lyme meningitis from viral meningitis [ 19 , 25 - 28 ] .
however , there are patients without pleocytosis in csf with cranial nerve palsy , fatigue and fever who will be detected by a positive nebop score and be recommended early start of antibiotic treatment .
furthermore , it has been shown that the majority of symptoms in children with lnb resolve within a few days after the start of antibiotic therapy [ 29 ] , but whether an early start of treatment is favorable for long term clinical outcome is not clear [ 30 ] .
a prediction model for lnb in children in a european setting has , to our knowledge , previously been presented only in one study [ 25 ] .
however , children with acute facial nerve palsy without meningitis were not included , which qualifies our nebop score as a more relevant predictive test with a more adequate representation of all children being evaluated for lnb in a relevant european setting .
furthermore , a clinical prediction test would also be useful for adult lnb patients , but such a test has , to our knowledge , not yet been developed .
conclusion in conclusion , the overall diagnostic accuracy of the nebop score is high ( 90 %) and the test is suggested to be useful for decision - making about early antibiotic treatment in children being evaluated for lnb in european lyme endemic areas .

inflammatory breast cancer ( ibc ) is a highly metastatic , aggressive , and fatal form of breast cancer .
patients presenting with ibc are characterized by a high number of axillary lymph node metastases .
recently , we found that ibc carcinoma tissues contain significantly higher levels of human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) dna compared to other breast cancer tissues that may regulate cell signaling pathways .
in fact , hcmv pathogenesis and clinical outcome can be statistically associated with multiple hcmv genotypes within ibc .
thus , in the present study , we established the incidence and types of hcmv genotypes present in carcinoma tissues of infected non - ibc versus ibc patients .
we also assessed the correlation between detection of mixed genotypes of hcmv and disease progression .
genotyping of hcmv in carcinoma tissues revealed that glycoprotein b ( gb ) - 1 and glycoprotein n ( gn ) - 1 were the most prevalent hcmv genotypes in both non - ibc and ibc patients with no significant difference between patients groups .
ibc carcinoma tissues , however , showed statistically significant higher incidence of detection of the gn - 3b genotype compared to non - ibc patients .
the incidence of detection of mixed genotypes of gb showed that gb - 1 + gb - 3 was statistically significantly higher in ibc than non - ibc patients .
similarly , the incidence of detection of mixed genotypes of gn showed that gn - 1 + gn - 3b and gn - 3 + gn - 4b / c were statistically significant higher in the carcinoma tissues of ibc than non - ibc .
mixed presence of different hcmv genotypes was found to be significantly correlated with the number of metastatic lymph nodes in non - ibc but not in ibc patients .
in ibc , detection of mixed hcmv different genotypes significantly correlates with lymphovascular invasion and formation of dermal lymphatic emboli , which was not found in non - ibc patients .
human cytomegalovirus glycoproteins inflammatory breast neoplasms ul55 ul73 lymphovascular invasion metastasis introduction breast cancer is considered the most common malignancy and a leading cause of death in women worldwide ( 1 ) .
many risk factors including age , sex , obesity , estrogen level , and family history of breast cancer are contributors to increased breast cancer incidence ( 2 ) .
studies suggest that viral infection maybe a risk factor in breast cancer ( 3 , 4 ) .
for instance , a link between certain viral infections and breast cancer incidence is suspected for epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) ( 5 ) , human papillomavirus ( hpv ) ( 6 ) , mouse mammary tumor virus ( mmtv ) ( 7 ) , and human cytomegalovirus ( hcmv ) ( 8 ) , although causality remains unproven .
hcmv has been detected in newly diagnosed ( 9 ) and metastatic breast cancer patients ( 10 ) .
furthermore , hcmv proteins and dna have been detected in breast ductal carcinoma in situ ( dcis ) and infiltrating ductal carcinoma tissues , possibly suggesting a causal association of hcmv in breast carcinogenesis ( 8 ) .
the ability of hcmv to infect a wide variety of cells constituting the tumor microenvironment , such as monocytes / macrophages , fibroblasts , and endothelial cells , implicates a variety and possible mechanisms for hcmv in cancer pathogenesis ( 11 - 13 ) .
during one 's lifetime , infection with several hcmv strains may occur ( 14 ) .
the virulence among different hcmv strains may be a crucial factor in the manifestation of hcmv - associated disease ( 15 ) .
it should be noted that genetic variation exists among hcmv genes that are implicated in host cell penetration , tissue tropism , or replication , which may influence the virulence of different hcmv strains ( 16 ) .
the severity of hcmv pathogenicity differs depending on genetic variability within viral genes ( 17 ) .
among the most variable hcmv genes are the viral envelope glycoproteins such as ul55 that encodes glycoprotein b ( gb ) ( 18 ) , and ul73 that encodes glycoprotein n ( gn ) ( 19 ) .
the gb genotype includes five genotypes ( gb - 1 - gb - 5 ) ( 20 ) , while gn shows four genotypes ( gn - 1 , gn - 2 , gn - 3 , and gn - 4 ) .
the gn - 3 genotype includes two subgenotypes ( a and b ) and gn - 4 includes three subgenotypes ( a , b , and c ) ( 21 ) .
human cytomegalovirus gb is the major component of the virus envelope ; it plays an essential role in viral entry into the cell by binding to membranous beta - 1 integrin via its gb disintegrin - like domain , which mediates virus entry to the host cell and cell to cell virus transmission ( 22 ) .
virus binding to the cell surface induces the phosphorylation of beta1 and beta3 integrins' intracellular domains ( 23 ) .
the gn moiety is covalently linked through disulfide bonds with glycoprotein m to form gm / gn complex ( 24 ) .
it is assumed that gn alone or the gm / gn complex is implicated in virus entry and spread , and is essential for hcmv replication ( 25 ) .
recently , it was found that the glycosylation of gn protects the virus from neutralizing antibodies ( 26 ) .
human cytomegalovirus cellular entry activates intracellular signaling pathways such as focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) ( 23 ) , mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) ( 27 ) , and phosphatidylinositol - 3 - oh kinase ( pi3 - k ) ( 28 ) all of which are known to play key roles in cancer progression ( 29 - 31 ) .
in addition , they played the role of hcmv gb in cell adhesion and signaling capabilities ( 22 , 23 ) .
hcmv infection is involved in cancer pathogens via modulation of apoptosis , cell migration , and angiogenesis ( 32 ) .
in fact , mixed infections with different genotypes of hcmv were detected in healthy ( 14 ) and immuno - suppressed patients , including patients undergoing lung transplant ( 33 ) and aids patients ( 34 ) .
in addition , mixed genotypes infection was found to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality of solid organ transplant patients ( 35 , 36 ) .
we are interested in the biology of inflammatory breast cancer ( ibc ) , an aggressive and fatal form of breast cancer that occurs at increased incidence among young women ( 37 - 41 ) .
our recent results found , for the first time , that their increased tumor - associated monocytes / macrophages ( tam / m ) and hcmv infection in the biology of ibc disease ( 42 , 43 ) .
we found that cytokines secreted by ibc tam / m such as il - 10 and il - 8 may be associated with hcmv infection .
we screened for hcmv infection in ibc versus non - ibc patients .
serological diagnosis indicates that hcmv antibody titer was higher in ibc versus non - ibc .
furthermore , nested pcr results revealed that hcmv - dna was detected in carcinoma tissues of ibc and not in adjacent non - carcinoma tissues , which was statistically significant compared to the non - ibc patient group .
moreover , we found that the expression and activation ( phosphorylation ) of nf - kappab / p65 signaling molecules are enhanced in hcmv - infected ibc cancer tissues compared to non - ibc tumors .
these data all suggest a possible pathogenic role of hcmv in ibc at a greater level than in non - ibc carcinomas ( 43 ) .
in the present study , we established the incidence of single and mixed hcmv gb and gn genotypes dna in carcinoma tissues of non - ibc versus ibc patients .
furthermore , we assessed the correlation between mixed genotypes and major pathological properties associated with breast cancer disease progression .
materials and methods patients and samples for participation of patients in this study , institutional review board ( irb ) approval was obtained from the ethics committee of ain - shams university .
each patient before participation provided a signed consent form including approval for publication of results .
patients visiting the breast clinic of ain - shams university hospitals and diagnosed with breast cancer by clinical examination , mammography , ultrasound , and tru - cut biopsy ( using a needle for manual culture of the breast tissues ) were recruited to the present study ( 42 ) .
in addition to the previous criteria , breast cancer patients presenting with swollen breast , edema , skin orange peel ( pead'orange ) , both skin and core biopsies showed infiltration of dermal lymphatics by carcinoma cells and the presence of dermal tumor emboli , as we described previously ( 40 ) and were diagnosed as ibc patients. by applying these criteria , a total of 147 patients ( 99 non - ibc and 48 ibc ) with hcmv - dna positive carcinoma tissue samples ( 43 ) were recruited in the present study during the period of january 2010 - september 2013 .
multiplex pcr assay for hcmv glycoproteins b and n genotypes we extracted dna from fresh breast carcinoma tissues obtained during modified radical mastectomy using genejet ( tm ) genomic dna purification kit ( thermo scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) .
experimental procedures were carried out as described in the kit guidelines .
the oligonucleotide primers used for nested and multiplex pcr were commercially synthesized ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) and are listed in table 1 .
detection of hcmv - dna from breast carcinoma tissue samples was carried out using nested pcr with two sets of primers specific for the fourth exon of the hcmv immediate early ( ie ) gene as we described previously ( 43 ) .
genotyping of hcmv gb and gn was performed by multiplex pcr using a mixture of specific primers to each of gb and gn genotypes .
for detection of different gb genotypes , nested multiplex pcr was performed with two external primers and five upstream inner primers specific for each gb genotype ( gb - 1 , gb - 2 , gb - 3 , gb - 4 , and gb - 5 ) and a single downstream primer as described elsewhere ( 44 ) .
the first round of the nested multiplex pcr was carried out in a 25 mul total volume using 1 mul of each external upstream and downstream primers ( 10 pmol \ ml ) , 3 mul of dna , containing a maximum of 250 ng dna from fresh breast carcinoma tissue , 12.5 mul of emeraldamp ( r ) max pcr green master mix ( takara , dalian , china ) , and 7.5 mul of free rnase water .
the pcr thermal profile started with an initial denaturation at 94degreesc for 5 min , followed by 35 cycles at 94degreesc for 45 s , 60degreesc for 1 min , and 72degreesc for 45 s , followed by terminal extension at 72degreesc for 10 min .
the second round of pcr was performed using 5 mul of the first reaction as dna template and an equimolar mixture of 10 pmol of each inner primer in a 25 mul total volume .
reaction was carried out under conditions identical to those used in the first round , but the annealing temperature was 58degreesc instead of 60degreesc .
for detection of gn genotypes , multiplex pcr was done with five specific upstream primers for each gn genotypes ( gn - 1 , gn - 2 , gn - 3b , gn - 4a , and gn - 4b / c ) and single downstream primers as described elsewhere ( 45 ) .
the reaction was carried out with an equimolar mixture of 10 pmol of the five upstream primers and the single downstream primer in a 25 mul total volume with a thermal profile including an initial denaturation at 94degreesc for 5 min , followed by 35 cycles of 94degreesc for 45 s , 60degreesc for 1 min , and 72degreesc for 45 s , followed by terminal extension at 72degreesc for 10 min .

detection of mixed hcmv different genotypes significantly correlates with lymphovascular invasion and formation of dermal lymphatic emboli in ibc the status of lymphovascular invasion and formation of dermal lymphatic emboli ( figure 6 ) among carcinoma tissues containing different gb and gn genotypes is described in table 3 .
patients showing gb - 1 , gb - 2 , gb - 3 , and gb - 5 were significantly ( p = 0.001 , 0.016 , 0.002 , and 0.032 , respectively ) higher in ibc than non - ibc patients .

discussion there is emerging evidence to suspect that viruses may play a role in the development or progression of certain human cancers , possibly including breast cancer ( 47 ) .
using nested pcr , our previous results revealed that hcmv - dna was detected in carcinoma tissues of ibc and not in adjacent non - carcinoma tissues , with results that are statistically significant compared to non - ibc patients' group .
interestingly , sequence analysis of the detected hcmv - dna fragments revealed that hcmv - infected ibc carcinoma tissues contain different hcmv - strains when compared to infected non - ibc tissues .
polymorphism among hcmv strains may provide important clinical information on the involvement of hcmv in ibc disease etiology ( 43 ) .
in fact , studies showed that hcmv is characterized by genetic variability among its strains , which plays an important role in immune - pathogenesis and stimulation of disease progression .
in addition , the ability of hcmv to infect different organs and cell types was found to be related to gene sequence variation among strains ( 14 , 48 , 49 ) .
enhancement of cmv disease pathogenesis due to mixed strain infection may result in expression and secretion of cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors due to replication of different virus strains ( 50 ) .
indeed , cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors secreted by breast carcinoma cells and tumor - associated immune cells such as monocytes / macrophages play an essential role in breast cancer progression ( 51 ) , and may provide therapeutic target molecules ( 42 , 52 ) .
the genomes of different hcmv strains are 95 % homologous , but specific regions contain higher rates of mutation ( 53 ) .
the most widely characterized polymorphic gene is ul55 , which encodes the viral gb genes , which is essential for virus penetration and cell fusion ( 54 ) , and represents the major target for neutralizing antibodies ( 55 ) .
the ul73 gene , which encodes viral gn implicated in virus attachment to the host cell and spread from cell to cell , is another highly polymorphic gene ( 56 ) .
in the present study , we analyzed the incidence of gb and gn genotypes in carcinoma tissues of breast cancer patients and its association with breast cancer disease progression .
multiplex pcr revealed that gb - 1 is the most prevalent genotype in both non - ibc and ibc carcinoma tissues with no significant difference between both patient groups .
the present result is in agreement with previous studies , which reported that gb - 1 had the highest incidence in renal transplant recipient hcmv - infected patients in kuwait ( 57 ) and among children who live at the phayathai babies' home in non - thaburi , thailand ( 58 ) .
the predominance of the gb - 1 genotype in hcmv - infected patients was also recorded in immunocompromised patients undergoing organ transplants ( 15 ) and congenitally infected neonates ( 59 , 60 ) in a chinese population .
the gb - 1 genotype was found to be the dominant hcmv genotype detected in pregnant women , newborns , and infants .
the previous results increase the possibility that gb - 1 might be transmitted by breast feeding ( 58 , 61 , 62 ) , and is more frequent in women of different populations .
similarly , we found that gn - 1 is the most prominent genotype in both non - ibc and ibc carcinoma tissues with no significant difference between both patient groups .
hcmv gn - 1 was the most incident genotype in monocytes isolated from healthy blood donors ( 21 ) .
in this regard , hcmv gn - 1 congenital infections are associated with favorable chronic outcome ( 19 ) .
in the present study , we found that ibc carcinoma tissues showed a statistically significantly higher incidence of the gn - 3b genotype compared to non - ibc tissues .
detection of mixed hcmv genotypes gb and gn was found in urine and peripheral blood of healthy women ( 63 ) and in vaginal specimens of women with sexually transmitted diseases ( 64 ) .
immunocompromised individuals acquire mixed infection of hcmv genotypes ( 15 , 33 ) .
infection with mixed hcmv genotypes was found to enhance immunopathogenesis ( 18 ) and morbidity ( 65 ) among infected patients .
in the present study , we found that detection of mixed hcmv gb and gn genotypes were more prominent in carcinoma tissues of ibc versus non - ibc patients .
distribution of mixed presence of different gb genotypes showed that gb - 1 + gb - 3 was statistically significantly higher in ibc than non - ibc carcinoma tissues .
ibc carcinoma tissues are characterized by highly invasive and angiogenic properties ( 66 ) .
studies showed that gb - 1 is the most frequent genotype among kidney transplant patients and induces the progression of invasive disease in solid organ transplants ( 67 ) .
other studies showed that genotypes gb - 1 and gb - 3 are more prevalent among hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( hsct ) patients and that gb - 3 is associated with the development of pneumonitis ( 68 ) .
a recent study showed that hsct patients presenting with the gb - 3 genotype are characterized by higher disease morbidity and lower survival rates compared to patients harboring genotypes gb - 1 , - 2 , and - 4 ( 69 ) .
the aggressive behavior of genotype gb - 3 may be due to specific biological mechanisms associated with host - virus interactions ( 70 ) .
our present results suggest that the presence of hcmv - gb - 3 aggressive genotype among ibc patients might affect ibc poor prognosis and disease morbidity .
in the present study , we found that detection of mixed hcmv gn genotypes in breast carcinoma tissues showed that gn - 1 + gn - 3b and gn - 3 + gn - 4b / c were statistically significantly higher in ibc than non - ibc carcinoma tissues .
in particular , previous studies suggested that hcmv may have a " strain - specific pathogenic phenotype ," which may be due to a link conferred by polymorphic gn genes and their function together ( 18 , 71 , 72 ) .
prospective survival rates among breast cancer patients are determined by the potential of carcinoma cells to invade lymph nodes and the number of metastatic axillary lymph nodes involved ( 73 ) .
a study conducted by soderberg - naucler showed that hcmv genes and proteins are present in the carcinoma tissues and the sentinel lymph nodes of metastatic breast cancer patients ( 74 ) .
an interesting study in cervical cancer showed that patients co - infected with both hcmv and hpv 16 had a higher number of metastatic lymph nodes compared to hcmv - / hpv + ( 75 ) .
indeed , hcmv - infected cells secrete cytokines and growth factors ( secretome ) that promote cellular motility , angiogenesis , and lymphangiogenesis ( 12 , 76 ) .
over expression of us28 encoded by hcmv is strongly associated with glioblastoma multiforme tumor invasion , possibly via activation of vegf , phosphorylation of stat3 ( p - stat3 ) , and endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( e - nos ) ( 77 ) .
in the present study , we found that the number of metastatic lymph nodes in patients with breast carcinoma tissues containing hcmv gb - 1 , gb - 2 , gb - 3 , and gb - 5 was significantly higher in ibc than non - ibc patients .
similarly , the number of metastatic lymph nodes in gn - 1 , gn - 3b , and gn - 4b / c was statistically significantly higher in ibc patients .
ibc patients were characterized by a statistically significantly higher number of axillary metastatic lymph nodes compared to non - ibc patients .
the novel results we found here , that mixed infections with different gb or gn genotypes significantly correlates with number of metastatic lymph nodes in non - ibc patients , possibly indicates that mixed infection with hcmv genotypes may augment invasion and motility of breast carcinoma cells .
lymphovascular invasion is an important step in breast cancer metastasis , with formation of lymphovascular emboli in ibc ( 78 ) .
ibc is an aggressive form of breast cancer , characterized by formation of lymphatic emboli within the lymphatic vessels ( 79 ) .
hcmv infection in tumor cells increases their adhesion to endothelium by activation of beta1alpha5 integrin on the surface of infected tumor cells , which promotes tumor cell transmigration through the endothelial cell barrier .
the hcmv us28 pathway contributes to fak activation and stimulation of cell invasion in hcmv - infected tumor cells ( 80 , 81 ) .
similar to results of lymph node metastasis , lymphovascular invasion in patients demonstrating breast carcinoma tissues with gb - 1 , gb - 2 , gb - 3 , and gb - 5 genotypes was statistically significantly higher in ibc than non - ibc tissues .
in the breast carcinoma tissues with single gn genotype , we found that lymph node metastasis in gn - 1 , gn - 3b , and gn - 4b / c genotypes was statically significantly higher in ibc than non - ibc patients .
detection of mixed hcmv different genotypes significantly correlates with lymphovascular invasion and formation of dermal lymphatic emboli in ibc but not in non - ibc patients .
in conclusion , our present results suggest a possibility of a high incidence of mixed hcmv genotypes infection in ibc , which may play a role in ibc disease progression .
further studies are necessary to determine the clinical significance of our findings and potential treatment of hcmv - infected breast cancer patients .

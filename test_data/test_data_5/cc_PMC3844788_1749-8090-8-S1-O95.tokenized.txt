methods 1 year retrospective post - operative analysis of 520 patients who underwent isolated cabg surgery based on morbidity and mortality .
the patients were divided into : caucasians ( c ) ; 444 patients and asians ( a ) ; 76 patients .
results our results showed high significant difference in the asian group compared to caucasians for pre - discharge creatinine ; p < 0.05 .
there was significant difference concerning post operative arrhythmias " incidence of af " , p < 0.05 in the caucasians group .
the statistical analysis was insignificant in terms of additive and logistic euroscore , hospital mortality , incidence of post operative infection , post operative renal impairment , itu readmission , post operative stay , reopening or the need for inotropes .
conclusion asians are more susceptible to impaired renal functions post operatively ; on the other hand caucasians are more susceptible to post operative arrhythmias so care should be taken to address these complications in each group .

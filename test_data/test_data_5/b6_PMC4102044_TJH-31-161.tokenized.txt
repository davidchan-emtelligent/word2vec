objective : the purpose of this study was to determine the rate and causes of wastage of blood and blood products ( packed red cells , plasma , platelets , and cryoprecipitate ) in qazvin hospitals .
materials and methods : the study was conducted in all hospitals in qazvin , including 5 teaching hospitals , 2 social welfare hospitals , 3 private hospitals , 1 charity hospital , and 1 military hospital .
this descriptive study was based on available data from hospital blood banks in the province of qazvin .
the research instrument was a 2 - part questionnaire .
the first part was related to demographic characteristics of hospitals and the second part elicited information about blood and blood component wastage .
the collected data were then analyzed using descriptive statistic methods and spss 11.5 .
results : blood wastage may occur for a number of reasons , including time expiry , wasted imports , blood medically or surgically ordered but not used , stock time expired , hemolysis , or miscellaneous reasons .
data indicated that approximately 77.9 % of wasted pack cell units were wasted for the reason of time expiry .
pack cell wastage in hospitals is reported to range from 1.93 % to 30.7 % .
wastage at all hospitals averaged 9.8 % among 30.913 issued blood products .
overall blood and blood product ( packed red cells , plasma , platelets , and cryoprecipitate ) wastage was 3048 units and average total wastage per participant hospital for all blood groups was 254 units per year .
conclusion : blood transfusion is an essential part of patient care .
the blood transfusion system has made significant advancements in areas such as donor management , storage of blood , cross - matching , rational use of blood , and distribution .
in order to improve the standards of blood banks and the blood transfusion services in iran , comprehensive standards have been formulated to ensure better quality control in collection , storage , testing , and distribution of blood and its components for the identified major factors affecting blood product wastage .

blood blood component wastage transfusion blood bank introduction there has been a continuing need for blood transfusion in recent years .
several factors are involved , including the increase of life expectancy and advances in medical technology [ 1 ] .
the industrial world and its ever increasing health incidents increase the use of blood and its products .
all of these issues have been causing concern over the adequacy of the blood obtained from human sources to meet increasing demands , doubling the importance of consumption management to prevent the loss of such resources [ 2 ] .
it should be noted that today a very small number of countries have utilized the necessary structures and resources to improve blood transfusion centers [ 3 ] .
the key elements of success are the use of financial and material resources , preparation and implementation of a realistic plan of action based on actual description , and analysis of the existing conditions in each country , availability of blood , proper and standard storage conditions , proper clinical use of blood in treatments , and compliance with rules and regulations for prescription of blood and its products [ 4 ] .
however , the number of blood donors during the past few years has been steadily declining .
reasons include the increase of donors' age , which causes morbidity , or increased and stricter parameters for the acceptance of donors in terms of their health and infectious agents associated with blood transfusion [ 5 ] .
greinacher et al. analyzed the effects of demographic changes on the blood supply in eastern germany as a model region for europe and found that a decrease of the young donor population will decrease the number of donors by 27.5 % - 32.6 % in 2015 .
the increasing size of the elderly population will also increase the number of blood transfusions by 11.8 % - 13.9 % due to morbidity increase [ 6 ] .
a general decline in the number of donors is being seen for the first time and the increasing age of the population limits the number of donors being attracted and retained [ 7 ] .
to solve this problem , we need to implement a rigorous scientific protocol on blood reserves and proper and timely use of blood products .
it seems we can overcome these problems considerably through accurately describing a protocol and creating more coordination , preventing the loss of blood products and energy , human , and financial resources [ 8 ] .
there has even been talk about blood overuse since 1937 , when fantus wrote : " in this hospital , blood is overly used " [ 9 ] .
a 1953 study revealed that 50 out of 290 cases of blood transfusion were unnecessary and proposed a training program about the proper use of blood for physicians [ 10 ] .
in 1961 , the joint commission on accreditation of health organizations decided to approve hospitals by reviewing their use of blood [ 11 ] .
in 1991 , the aabb declared reviewing of blood used by its blood transfusion committee as mandatory for the first time [ 12 ] .
in october 1995 , the world health organization held its first preparatory meeting for the formation of a workgroup of international cooperation for blood safety in geneva , and it published its recommendations for the creation of national guidelines and policies for the clinical use of blood in 1998 [ 13 ] .
today , the importance of blood transfusion medicine is well established , but procuring healthy blood only ensures a part of its safety .
the other part is the proper shipping , storage , and use of blood in hospitals ( table 1 ) .
therefore , excessive and inappropriate use of blood products is also among the factors cited ; this requires public commitment to ensure that healthy blood and its products are available at reasonable prices , are used properly with minimum losses , and are produced within a consistent health monitoring system [ 14 ] .
four main processes that are implemented during blood transfusions in hospitals of qazvin province , one of the central provinces of iran , are : the requests for blood and its products by physicians form the organization of blood transfusions ; these products are stored in blood banks of hospitals ; compatibility tests are conducted before the injection ; and the injection process and its side effects are monitored .
meanwhile , blood wastes occur by various causes that are the focus of this study ( table 2 ) .
this study was designed to investigate the amount and causes of waste of blood and its products ( packed red cells , plasma , platelets , and cryoprecipitate ) in hospitals of qazvin province .
this study may provide experience - based information to various groups and act as a helpful guideline for optimum use of blood and reduction of its wastes .
materials and methods this was a cross - sectional , analytical - descriptive study based on the statistical data available from hospitals' blood banks .
data about blood and blood component wastage for the year 2010 were obtained from 12 hospitals , including 5 teaching hospitals , 3 private hospitals , 2 social welfare hospitals , 1 charity hospital , and 1 military hospital .
the hospitals were divided into wards according to type and complexity of activities undertaken : for teaching hospitals , emergency , neonatal intensive care unit , thalassemia , surgery , and gynecology and obstetrics ; for private hospitals , gynecology and obstetrics , coronary care unit , pediatrics , internal , and surgery ; for social welfare hospitals , gynecology and obstetrics , surgery , internal , and intensive care unit ; for the charity hospital , orthopedics , neonatal intensive care unit , gynecology and obstetrics , and surgery ; and for the military hospital , surgery and internal .
for all hospitals and wards , clinical use of blood and blood components and amount of discarded blood components were calculated .
blood wastage may occur for a number of reasons : time expiry ( the expiry date on the unit has passed ) , wasted import ( unit imported with patient but not used for storage condition reasons or poor practice at ward level and product discarded prior to the expiry date ) , blood medically or surgically ordered but not used ( unit ordered for medical procedure but not necessary for treatment ) , no need for patient ( nonmedical reasons such as death of patient , patient discharged , or no consent ) , leakage ( damage to or fault in the blood bag ) , lack of cord blood ( with unnecessary cross - matching for every medical procedure is thus impossible to re - do and blood is not used ) , hemolytic reasons , or miscellaneous reasons ( any other reason for which the unit is wasted ) ( table 2 ) .
the research instrument was a 2 - part questionnaire .
the first part was related to demographic characteristics of the hospitals and the second part elicited information about blood and blood component wastage ; the data were taken from detailed forms of unused blood and blood components , categorized into 6 sections : type of blood product , blood groups , the number of requested units , the number of blood transfusion units , the number of wasted blood units , and the reason for wastage .
thus , the evaluation was retrospective .
in order to complete the questionnaire , data were gathered by contacting the blood banks of the hospitals under study , conducting interviews with the people in charge of those departments , and studying the patients' documents .
the collected data were then analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and spss 11.5 .
results out of a total of 30.913 units of blood received in all the hospitals of qazvin province , 58.6 % were in the form of packed red cells , 0.3 % in the form of whole blood , 15.8 % in the form of plasma , 21.6 % in the form of platelets , and 3.5 % in the form of cryoprecipitate .
out of 3048 units of blood wasted , 59.4 % were in the form of packed red cells , 22 % in the form of plasma , 16 % in the form of platelets , and 2.4 % in the form of cryoprecipitate ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
the distribution frequency of blood and blood product wastage in the hospitals of this study showed that out of a total of 3048 discarded units in all hospitals , 58.3 % was wasted in teaching hospitals , 19.9 % was wasted in private hospitals , 15.8 % was wasted in social welfare hospitals , 3.2 % was wasted in the charity hospital , and 1.9 % was wasted in the military hospital .
teaching hospitals had the highest percentage of total blood and blood product waste , while private hospitals ranked second ( table 3 ) .
results of packed red cell distribution frequency in different wards of teaching , private , social welfare , charity , and military hospitals indicated that the thalassemia ward had the highest use of packed red cells among different wards of teaching hospitals .
the surgery ward had the highest use of packed red cells in the private and social welfare hospitals of qazvin province , while it was the gynecology and obstetrics ward that had the highest packed red cell use in the charity hospital .
it should also be noted that the blood bank of the military hospital was not active and only 4 units out of its 62 packed red cell units were used in its internal medicine ward .
results of studying the packed red cell wastes in these hospitals showed that out of a total of 3048 discarded units in all hospitals , 1790 units belonged to teaching hospitals and 57.3 % of these units were packed red cells , with the b + blood type as the most often discarded one .
out of a total of 613 wasted units in private hospitals , 63.1 % of waste also comprised packed red cells , while this was 56.5 % of a total of 486 wasted units in social welfare hospitals , 64 % of a total of 100 wasted units in the charity hospital , and 100 % in the military hospital .
results of investigating the common causes of blood and blood product wastage in the hospitals of this study showed that blood and blood product wastes were highly associated with 3 common causes , including the expiration of the usability period , the patient 's lack of need for these products , and their non - use in hospital wards ( table 2 ) .
discussion while the blood supply is seriously limited , blood use increases every year .
many of the blood transfusion cases are being done improperly .
proper clinical use of blood is an important and critical issue , especially in regions that are facing limitations in the number of blood units .
out of a total of 30.913 units received in all the hospitals of qazvin province in this study , 18.123 ( 58.6 %) were in the form of packed red cells , 100 ( 0.3 %) were in the form of whole blood , 4913 ( 15.8 %) were in the form of plasma , 6695 ( 21.6 %) were in the form of platelets , and 1082 ( 3.5 %) were in the form of cryoprecipitate .
the number of plasma units received during another study was 595 [ 15 ] .
in another study on the use of fresh frozen plasma products at a children 's medical center , 1262 plasma units were received [ 16 ] .
the current study saw a greater number of received units of blood and blood products from a larger study population .
this study investigated the causes and the amount of blood wastes in all hospitals of qazvin province .
it showed that blood and blood product wastes were highly associated with 3 common causes , including the expiration of the usability period , the patient 's lack of need for these products , and their non - use in hospital wards .
there are a few reports about the average amount of expired blood units in blood banks or blood transfusion centers .
in this study , 1410 ( 77.9 %) out of a total of 1811 discarded packed red cell units were wasted due to the expiration of their usability period .
in another study of decrease of blood waste using the sigma method , investigation of packed red cell wastes in hospitals showed that 87 % of these wastes occurred outside the blood bank due to improper shipping and storage temperatures .
other factors involved were the personnel 's lack of knowledge and training , improper management of shipping temperature and other temperature indices , and the lack of supervision and responsibility [ 17 ] .
the current study investigated the wastage of blood and blood products by hospitals of qazvin province .
results showed that the wastes were in the form of packed red cells ( 59.4 %) , plasma ( 22 %) , platelets ( 16 %) , and cryoprecipitate ( 2.4 %) according to type of blood product , and out of a total of 3048 blood and blood product units wasted , 58.7 % of them were returned by teaching hospitals , 20.1 % by private hospitals , 15.9 % by social welfare hospitals , 3.2 % by the charity hospital , and 1.9 % by the military hospital .
a study reviewing blood transfusion and wastes in the teaching hospitals of semnan university of medical sciences reported that 759 ( 65.9 %) out of 1152 packed red cell units delivered to these hospitals were discarded and only 393 ( 34.1 %) were transfused [ 18 ] .
there are no reports that compare these amounts based on the type of hospitals .
in another study of the use of blood and its products at imam reza hospital , out of a total of 12.436 units of blood received by the blood bank , 2950 ( 23.8 %) were discarded [ 19 ] .
results of studying the packed red cell wastes in the hospitals of the current study showed that out of a total of 3048 discarded units in all hospitals , 1790 units belonged to teaching hospitals and 57.3 % of these units were packed red cells , with the b + blood type as the most often discarded one .
there are no similar studies that review cases of blood and blood product wastes based on different blood types .
the thalassemia ward had the highest use of packed red cells among various wards of teaching hospitals in this study , while the emergency ward ranked second .
in another study of unnecessary transfusion of blood and its products in hospitalized patients at dr. fatemi hospital in ardabil , 60 cases ( 40 %) of blood transfusions occurred in the intensive care unit [ 20 ] .
blood transfusion and the supplying of healthy blood are among the more expensive medical services and most developing countries are not able to offer such services .
developing the proper culture for the optimum use of blood products in such countries is therefore of utmost importance .
the current study recommends the following of some necessary policies for supervision and management of blood use and reduction of blood wastes , including monitoring consumers' access to the supply of products , supervising the quality of new guidelines , investigating the reports received from hospitals regarding issues related to blood transfusion , inspecting the method of use of blood or its products in hospital wards , controlling the method of shipping from delivery to the hospitals until distribution among wards , and checking the hospital 's stock of blood and plasma in terms of numbers , dates , method of storage , and the time of keeping blood for cross - matching .
the hemovigilance system is being used in 2 teaching hospitals of qazvin province to reduce blood wastes and it allows the possibility of promoting the blood transfusion chain ( from the time of blood collection until the time of its injection into the recipient ) and monitoring the quality of blood and its products' use , better so than before .
according to the recommendations of the world health organization , blood transfusion should be prescribed only in situations where other methods cannot effectively prevent or control mortality .
decisions about the prescription of blood must be done based on the most reliable clinical guidelines available , which are modified according to the needs of patients .
blood products have a limited half - life , so the approach to blood transfusion must apply accurate strategies for blood reserves in order to prevent loss and reduce wastes as much as possible [ 21 ] .
in overall evaluation of hospitals , considering the ratio of waste to usage , it should be noted that teaching hospitals had the best practice and military hospital had the worst practice .
this study addresses one of the research priorities of iran 's blood transfusion system .
the advantages of this research are that it included all the hospitals in qazvin province and that a large number of reasons for blood and blood product wastage were considered. of course , it is the first comprehensive study that was done in iran , while other studies regarding these issues were not as comprehensive as this research as they did not include all the hospitals and only considered 1 or 2 blood products .
it is hoped that this research will help to decrease the amount of blood wastage , as blood is an important and rare resource .

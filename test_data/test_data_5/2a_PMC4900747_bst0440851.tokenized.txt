the rotary atpase family comprises the atp synthase ( f - atpase ) , vacuolar atpase ( v - atpase ) and archaeal atpase ( a - atpase ) .
these either predominantly utilize a proton gradient for atp synthesis or use atp to produce a proton gradient , driving secondary transport and acidifying organelles. with advances in em has come a significant increase in our understanding of the rotary atpase family .
following the sub nm resolution reconstructions of both the f - and v - atpases , the secondary structure organization of the elusive subunit a has now been resolved , revealing a novel helical arrangement .
despite these significant developments in our understanding of the rotary atpases , there are still a number of unresolved questions about the mechanism , regulation and overall architecture , which this mini - review aims to highlight and discuss .
cryo - em molecular motor rotary atpase vacuolar atpase introduction the rotary atpase families are membrane - bound molecular motors which act either by hydrolysing atp to generate a proton gradient or by utilizing an existing proton gradient to energize atp synthesis .
the family consists of the atp synthase ( f - atpase ) , vacuolar atpase ( v - atpase ) and archaeal atpase ( a - atpase ) .
a common feature of the rotary atpase family is the coupling of a membrane - bound proton - translocating domain ( vo ) and a soluble , atp hydrolysing / synthesizing motor ( figure 1 ) .
although the core motors of each member of the family share a high degree of similarity , they possess varying degrees of extra complexity .
this is indicated by the number of static peripheral stalks ( that make up the ' stator ' of the motor ) they possess which may reflect the differing degrees of regulation they each require [ 1 ] .
the best studied system , the f - atpase , is the simplest of the family , possessing only one stator stalk .
it primarily uses the proton gradient and subsequent flow of h + through the fo domain to generate torque and drive atp synthesis in the f1 region .
recent em and crystallography studies have shown the interface where proton translocation occurs between the rotating c - ring and the static subunit a has a novel architecture with two horizontal helices parallel to the plane of the membrane and embedded within it [ 2 - 4 ] .
at this interface the proton enters one side of a half - channel within a , is picked up by a conserved glutamate residue on the c - ring and following a full revolution of the rotor , is then moved into the half - channel on the opposite side .
the second member of the atpase family is the a - atpase , which differs in organization to the f - type in having two stator stalks rather than one .
each of these stalks is made of just two coiled - coils rather than the multi - polypeptide stator found in the f - atpase .
some members of the a - atpase family also function through the use of sodium as a coupling ion [ 5 ] .

this review focuses on the v - atpase , which acts via the hydrolysis of atp to drive proton translocation across a membrane .
the v - atpase has the same overall architecture as the other atpase family members consisting of the soluble atp hydrolysing domain ( v1 ) and vo ( figure 1 ) .
v1 consists of three ab repeats where atp hydrolysis takes place , subunits d and f make up the central rotor axle and three stator stalks consisting of subunits e and g. the three stators are linked by a series of ' collar ' subunits which include subunit c , h and the soluble domain of subunit a. the membrane embedded vo domain consists of the c - ring , made up of a variable number of c subunits , subunit d and the remainder of subunit a. the v - atpase plays an essential role in several physiological processes , including cell homoeostasis and signalling [ 6 ] , and therefore is found in all eukaryotic cells [ 7 ] .
it is thus unsurprising that the complex is implicated in a variety of disease states [ 8 ] , for example its role in bone resorption through acid extrusion means that it is involved in both osteoporosis and osteopetrosis [ 9 ] .
the v - atpase has also been linked to cancer invasiveness and has been studied as a target for cancer therapy [ 10 - 12 ] .
recently , the sub nm resolution em structures of the v - atpase from both yeast and the higher eukaryote manduca sexta [ 13,14 ] have provided unprecedented detail into its structure and mechanism .
in particular , the structures from yeast show the organization of subunit a , in the form of highly tilted horizontal helices similar to the arrangement recently observed in f - atpase from polytomella sp [ 2 ] .
despite the improved resolution of these structures , the primary structure of subunit a cannot be unambiguously assigned in the map hence , the connectivity between helices is still uncertain .
the yeast v - atpase has been solved in three distinct rotational states , permitting the conformational changes that accommodate atp hydrolysis to be observed .
despite the great advances that have been made in our structural and biochemical understanding of the rotary atpase family , a number of unresolved questions remain , some of which this review aims to address .
for example the manner in which isolated or disassociated domains of the complex are silenced , the effect of direct linkage between the stator and rotor domains acting as a ' break ' and the role and location of subunits e and ac45 within the complex .
mechanism through a combination of biochemical analysis , x - ray crystallography and em , a number of defined catalytic states of the v - atpase have been trapped which are consistent with the ' boyer mechanism ' [ 15 - 17 ] .
key to the rotation of the central axle is the movement of the lever arms at the base of the ab catalytic dimer , induced through atp hydrolysis and the subsequent release of adp and pi. the central rotor axle is stabilized at the top of v1 by a series of highly conserved loops that display alternative positive and negative charges ( a feature conserved in the f - and a - atpase families ) and it is tempting to hypothesize that these act as a frictionless electrostatic bearing through a series of attracting and repelling charges acting on the charged axle [ 14,18 ] .
to our knowledge there is no report of any mutagenesis on these residues , which could provide new insights into this poorly characterized highly conserved feature within the rotary atpase family .
implicit within the rotary mechanism is the need for the central rotor axle to couple with the c - ring with no interactions to the static stator complex .
it is clear that within both the yeast and m. sexta systems this is not the case with significant contact made between subunits d and c , which would be analogous to applying the brakes to the rotary mechanism ( figure 2 ) [ 13,14,19 ] .
the removal of this linkage has been shown to increase the flexibility of the system [ 20 ] .
moreover , it was hypothesized that this may act in a ratchet - like mechanism such that the conformational changes which accommodate atp binding and hydrolysis not only drive rotation but release the steric hindrance , allowing forward rotation [ 20 ] .
in the absence of any atp hydrolysis , the axle is unable to rotate either forwards or in reverse through steric hindrance of this ' brake - like ' mechanism , silencing proton leakage and preventing futile backwards rotation of the rotor .

shown looking down from v1 domain towards membrane .
analysis of the different catalytic states shows significant movement of the eg stators [ 13,21 ] , although their fundamental shape is dictated not by the occupancy of the atp - binding site in the ab domain , but by interactions with the different subunits within the collar region [ 14 ] .
interestingly for both the m. sexta and yeast complexes there is an apparent ' resting state ' into which a predominant population of v - atpase exist , ( approximately 48 % within the yeast system [ 13 ]) .
these states also coincide with the level of interaction between subunit d and subunits c and h. within yeast the largest to smallest interfaces have approximately 48 % , 36 % and 16 % of particles associated with them , respectively .
this suggests that the interface may potentially provide stability within the complex , although the exact purpose is unknown .
it may be that this asymmetry in population is related to regulation , as it is known that addition of atp induces dissociation of the complex [ 22 ] , so it is possible that the detachment of v1 from vo can only occur in certain rotational states and thus is mediated by the stability of this interface .
regulation the ability of the v - atpase to consume significant cellular resources of atp [ 22,23 ] , requires a regulatory mechanism to avoid futile atp turnover .
one proposed mechanism is through the dissociation of v1 from vo , as shown in yeast and m. sexta [ 24,25 ] .
however , recent in vivo experiments have suggested a more subtle rearrangement of v1 from vo rather than complete separation [ 26 ] .
moreover , to date evidence for this being a ubiquitous mechanism also remains elusive with other species failing to show the same dissociation behaviour , although there is some evidence in mammalian cells for amino acid modulated reassembly [ 27 ] .
furthermore , although the a1 domain from the a - atpase has been well studied , to our knowledge it has not yet been shown to dissociate in a similar manner to that of the v - atpase under physiological conditions .
in addition to the need for regulation of the mature complex , it is also vital to regulate the isolated hydrolysing domains of the complex along the assembly pathway .
this may be regulated in an alternative manner or share a common method of regulation with the dissociated v1 / a1 .
therefore , it is possible that , although informative , studies that are carried out on the isolated a1 domain may be more relevant to a stable assembly intermediate rather than representative of a dissociated a - atpase complex , whereas v1 can be isolated after controlled dissociation [ 28 ] .
within the v - atpase , subunits c and h have been implicated in the regulatory process with the former responding to cellular signals ( likely phosphorylation [ 29,30 ]) , triggering dissociation and then later halting rotation of the central axle through steric hindrance [ 31 ] .
the a - atpase lacks any homologues for these subunits and so the triggers for dissociation and / or silencing of atp turnover are unknown if indeed present. with regards to atp silencing , there is evidence that subunit h undergoes an approximately 120degrees rotation about the eg stator to interact with the central rotor axle [ 31,32 ] .
the interfaces involved within this interaction are yet to be resolved with an approximately 25 a ( 1 a = 0.1 nm ) em reconstruction of the isolated v1 domain from m. sexta failing to show any interaction despite the h subunit being associated with the complex as shown through biochemical and negative stain analysis [ 28 ] .
the lack of strong density for subunit h may represent a high degree of flexibility or an artefact caused through the modest resolution .
it has also been suggested that subunit f , which sits at the base of the rotor axle , may play a role in silencing atp hydrolysis in the isolated v1 and a1 domains [ 33,34 ] .
as the f subunit is common to both the v - and a - atpase , it is possible that this forms the basis of a common mode of silencing during the process of complex assembly .
the role of subunits e and ac45 the least characterized subunit within the v - atpase complex is subunit e. it has been shown to be heavily glycosylated [ 35 ] and is required for accurate assembly of the c - ring [ 36 - 38 ] .
however , its role , if any , in v - atpase mechanism and / or structure is unknown .
within yeast , it has been shown that subunit e is absent from the complex after purification [ 39 ] .
however , for m. sexta , the e subunit has been identified as part of the purified complex [ 35 ] .
moreover , the potent and selective v - atpase inhibitor pea albumin toxin 1b ( pa1b ) was shown to bind subunit e with the corresponding position in the em map at the base of the v - atpase [ 40 ] .
there is a clear distinction at the base of the v - atpase , between yeast and m. sexta , with the latter , which contains subunit e , having a protrusion that is partially glycosylated at the base of vo [ 14 ] ( figure 3 ) .
for the yeast enzyme , which lacks subunit e in the purified complex , no protrusion is seen [ 13 ] .
therefore , we believe that subunit e is located at the base of the v - atpase , although its function and its precise location are yet to be resolved .
this is important as subunit e may be used as a target site for selective inhibitors as it is differentially observed across species .
thus , it would be valuable to study the relationship between organisms possessing the e subunit within the complex and those where it is more transient in order to discern the rationale behind the retention and thus the function of this mysterious subunit .

previous studies have suggested the accessory protein ac45 is responsible for the density at the base of the v - atpase since it is absent from yeast , along with the protrusion at the base of vo [ 41 ] .
however , despite extensive ms and gel analysis ac45 cannot be identified within the m. sexta v - atpase preparation [ 14 ] , which also contains a similar protrusion at the base of vo. therefore , it seems logical to conclude that the density at the base of vo is linked to subunit e and not ac45 .
the role for ac45 and its association with the v - atpase is still poorly understood although there is growing evidence that it plays a role in localization rather than mechanism [ 42,43 ] .
conclusions although there have been several major advances recently in our understanding of the structure and function of the v - atpase and rotary atpases in general , there are still several unanswered questions. through understanding these systems in more detail we are beginning to see subtle differences between organisms , such as the presence or absence of subunit e and ac45 , which may call into question the relevance of model systems currently in use .
mechanistically , there are still several challenges to overcome such as the manner of regulation and dissociation within the v - atpase and how this differs across the atpase family as a whole , and also the safeguards in place to prevent backwards rotation .
additionally , the precise mechanism of proton translocation is still unknown with higher resolution structural studies still required to view this process in detail , whereas dynamic structural studies may enable functional and mechanistic detail to be linked to structural changes rather than the static snapshots currently available .

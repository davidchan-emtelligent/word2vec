construction of recombinant dna from multiple fragments is widely required in molecular biology , especially for synthetic biology purposes .
here we describe a new method , successive hybridization assembling ( sha ) which can rapidly do this in a single reaction in vitro .
in sha , dna fragments are prepared to overlap one after another , so after simple denaturation - renaturation treatment they hybridize in a successive manner and thereby assemble into a recombinant molecule .
in contrast to traditional methods , sha eliminates the need for restriction enzymes , dna ligases and recombinases , and is sequence - independent .
we first demonstrated its feasibility by constructing plasmids from 4 , 6 and 8 fragments with high efficiencies , and then applied it to constructing a customized vector and two artificial pathways .
as sha is robust , easy to use and can tolerate repeat sequences , we expect it to be a powerful tool in synthetic biology .
introduction modifying organisms at the molecular level is the main base for the modern biotechnology , in which people often need to incorporate two or more dna fragments into a larger construct .
alongside the traditional restriction enzyme - based assembly , a variety of methods have been developed for this task in the last 40 years , which were systemically reviewed in a recent article by ellis et al .
[ 1 ] .
the most recent and interesting development would be the new assembly strategy exemplified by slic which can assemble multiple fragments simultaneously and sequence - independently by harnessing in vitro homologous recombination .
a single slic reaction could assemble a 7.5 kb plasmid from ten pcr fragments with 40 bp homologous ends ( also called overlaps ) [ 2 ] .
a similar method used in constructing the first artificial organism , assembled the 583 kb mycoplasma genitalium genome from four fragments with 80 - 257 bp homologous ends [ 3 ] .
however these methods require high - quality dna substrates and enzymes , thus dna purification and reaction buffer switch are usually needed .
furthermore , faulty recombinations resulted from mismatching at overhangs were observed and got worse as the number of fragments increased [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
to address these limitations , we developed here a novel mechanism - based method , successive hybridization assembling ( sha ) , which does not include complex cut - ligate steps or specific recombination enzymes , and as found in our study , has outstanding performances regarding to simplicity , efficiency , and resistance to sequence repeats .
results method design in traditional dna - dna hybridization , for example in southern blotting , two different dna pieces are recombined together with their complementary regions .
we reasoned that with more hybridization events occurring , more dna pieces can be recombined together for construction purpose .
based on this assumption we designed our sha method .
as shown in fig. 1 every substrate fragment ( sf ) is designed to have its 3 ' - half overlapped with the 5 ' - half of the next sf. as these overlaps ( halves ) can cover about 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 of each sf , after denaturation and renaturation , there are good chances for inter - fragment hybridizations .
then a circular plasmid can form and be ready for transformation .
nicks and gaps in it can be repaired in the bacteria cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030267.g001 figure 1 scheme of sha ( take a 6 - sf assembling for example ) .
to construct the final plasmid from the six starting materials ( gene 1 - 4 , replication origin and a selectable marker ) , sfs are first prepared by linking every two materials together , usually suing overlap - extension pcr ( oe - pcr ) .
so as shown in this figure , every sf has its 3 ' - half overlapped with the 5 ' - half of the next sf and the 5 ' - half of the first sf overlaps with the 3 ' - half of the last sf. a mixture of these sfs was denatured at 100degreesc to free all single strands .
when it cools back down to room temperature , annealing between the overlaps would assemble the single strands one after another into a cycle which can be further repaired into double - stranded , closed circular molecule after transformation into the cells .
to generate the two - half structure , sfs are usually constructed by joining two dna elements together using oe - pcr .
for example , in fig. 1 , kan ( selectable marker ) , ori ( replication origin ) and gene1 - 4 are first pcr - isolated from their initial sources .
then each two neighboring ones are joined together by oe - pcr to generate sf kan - gene1 , sf gene1 - gene2 , sf gene2 - gene3 , sf gene3 - gene4 , sf gene4 - ori .
sf ori - kan can be simply pcr - amplified from a vector plasmid and work as a vector backbone .
in practice we also successfully got sfs by tailed primer pcr or chemical synthesis ( illustrated in fig. 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030267.g002 figure 2 general methods for sf preparation .
( a ) two elements are joined by oe - pcr .
( b ) one short element is added to the 5 ' - end of a primer ; the long element is pcr amplified .
( c ) sfs are synthesized chemically .
as extra oligos are not required , the cost of two sfs is not much higher than the total cost of the three elements .
combination of sfs by hybridization the core step of our method , hybridization , was carried out simply with a boiling water bath treatment ( see materials and methods ) .
to see the impact directly , we analyzed the dnas by gel electrophoresis .
as shown in fig. 3 after the hybridization treatment , sfs were combined into larger structures .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030267.g003 figure 3 combination of sfs after renaturation .
sf 1 - 4 ( pokca construction , fig 4a and fig. s1 ) were mixed ( resulting m ) , denatured and renatured ( resulting m & h ) .
they were added to agarose gel in a volume ratio of 1:1:1:1:4:4. from the comparison between m and m & h , we can find that , the bands corresponding to sf 1 - 4 weakened while at least two new bands emerged after the hybridization treatment .
the new bands are around 4 and 5 kb , about twice bigger than the four sfs , suggesting that they are resulted from inter - fragment hybridization .
m & h was further transformed into e. coli dh5alpha and generated plasmid pokca .
construction of plasmids from four , six and eight sfs as a proof of concept and to evaluate the assembly efficiency , we first constructed three plasmids , pokca , pokc2muua and pokca2 from four , six and eight sfs respectively .
plasmid structures , overlapped sfs and the overlap lengths are illustrated in fig. 4a . the genetic elements assembled were : o , the ori from pet28a ( originally from pbr322 ) ; k , kanamycin resistance gene kan ; c , chloramphenicol resistance gene cat ; a , ampicillin resistance gene amp ; 2mu , 2mu replication origin ; u , yeast ura3 gene .
most sfs were prepared by jointing two elements together by oe - pcr .
sfs containing 50 bp overlaps were prepared by tailed primer pcr ( details of sf preparations were illustrated in fig. s1 ) .
after mixing , dpni digestion and hybridization , 5 microliters of sfs were transformed into dh5alpha chemical competent cells .
the results were summarized in fig. 4 b. as shown , sha was able to assemble up to eight sfs with overlaps down to 50 bp with sufficient efficiency .
in contrast , mixture without hybridization treatment gave no or only a few colonies which were traced to undigested plasmid .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030267.g004 figure 4 plasmids constructed in this article and their assembly efficiencies .
( a ) the outer cycle is a plasmid map showing the main genetic elements ; two inner green cycles show the overlapped sfs , along with the overlap lengths ( bp ) ; the center is plasmid name and size ( bp ) .
two examples are provided to show how nicks or gaps form .
in pokca construction , the antisense primer for sf1 ( sf1wa ) and the sense primer for sf3 ( sf3ws ) were designed to be back to back , such that a nick formed between sf1 and sf3 .
in pacetone construction , primers sftaws and sfhbwa were designed to be apart , so a 110 bp gap formed between sfta and sfhb .
( b ) acolony forming units per microgram dna .
bthe proportion of transformants caused by undigested pcr template , determined by colony pcr .
cthe proportion of unwanted recombinants , determined by restriction mapping ( fig. s2 ) and dna sequencing .
dthis plasmid was difficult to construct inherently ( see text for details ). by varying overlap length we found that the longer overlap used the higher assembly efficiency was achieved , and no overlap led to no assembly ( fig. 5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0030267.g005 figure 5 the impact of overlap length on assembly efficiency .
five reconstruction of pokca were designed , in which the overlap between sf1 ( red ) and sf4x ( blue , stands for sf4 , sf41 , sf42 , sf43 , or sf44 ) varied from 0 bp to 1019 bp .
sf1 and sf3 were prepared as described in the text ( and fig. s1 ) .
sf4x and sf2x ( sf2 , sf21 , sf22 , sf23 , or sf24 ) were amplified from pokc2muua with corresponding primers ( table s2 ) .
transformations were selected on cm plates .
assembly efficiencies are given as colony forming units per microgram of sfs .
construction of a customized vector a vector is typically composed of a replication origin , a selectable marker , multiple cloning sites and some other elements which can endow it with different functional traits , such as copy number , maintenance stability , induction method , and expression intensity .
existing vectors usually ca n't exactly meet all the demands for a specific task .
so it is very desirable if we can pick every element we need and assemble them into a vector right before using .
here we constructed a customized vector , pjxl ( fig. 4 ) , for b. subtilis metabolic engineering within two days .
it was consisted of four dna pieces : the amp and ori of pbr322 , the 3 kb replication region of plasmid pbs72 [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and spas promoter from plasmid pnz8901 [ 6 ] .
two sfs were chemically synthesized ; the other two were prepared by oe - pcr ( details were illustrated in fig. s1 ) .
the function of constructed pjxl was demonstrated by controlled production of enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter ( fig. s3 ) .
construction of a 4 - gene partial isoprene - biosynthesis pathway previously , a similar pathway was constructed for terpenoids production by two rounds of traditional cloning and oe - pcr [ 7 ] .
here using sha , we finished the construction , named ptriclow ( fig. 4a ) , within two days , including the time for sfs preparation .
genes encoding the last four enzymes of the mva pathway , erg12 , erg8 , erg19 , and idi1 , were amplified from saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic dna individually ; two vector fragments , b5 ' fragment and b3 ' fragment , were amplified from expression vector ptrchis2a. from them six sfs were prepared by oe - pcr .
three rbs - containing sequences of 45 bp each were added to separate and organize all 4 genes into a single synthetic operon ( details about sf preparations were illustrated in fig. s1 ) .
the assembly efficiency was sufficient but lower than expected ( fig. 4b ) .
to investigate the reason , we retransformed dh5alpha cells with the constructed ptriclow ( in covalently closed circular form ) .
the efficiency was about two orders of magnitude lower than normal plasmids with similar sizes .
thus this plasmid was difficult to construct inherently .
similar phenomenon was also reported for traditional cloning methods [ 8 ] .
ptriclow , was then cotransformed with pacy - isps4 ( coding for a modified populus alba isoprene synthase , constructed previously in our lab by traditional cloning , see method s1 for details. ) into e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) .
isoprene production was confirmed by gc - ms .
( see fig. s3 ) construction of a 4 - gene acetone - biosynthesis pathway during the above constructions , we designed the sfs ( by choosing the primer positions , examples were shown in fig. 4a ) in a way that after the hybridization nicks formed between sfs .
it was previously reported that , like nicks , gaps ( of 6 - nt , in the lic method ) could also be repaired by the cells [ 9 ] .
here , we thought our method should be able to tolerate even longer gaps , since it could stick the fragments together more stably ( the complementary regions were much longer than in lic method ) .
the benefit of this ability would be making the primer designing easier and providing more flexibility .
to test it , we constructed a synthetic acetone pathway , pacetone , with gaps of 110 , 54 , 58 and 12 nt formed after the hybridization ( fig. 4a ) .
this pathway was derived from the isopropanol production pathway first designed by hanai et al [ 10 ] .
thl and adc were amplified from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 genomic dna individually ; atoa and atod were amplified from e. coli k12 genomic dna together ; the recipient vector was amplified from plasmid pet28adeltalaci which was reduced from pet28a ( see method s2 for details ) .
then by oe - pcr , they were joined into 4 sfs .
similar to what we did in ptriclow construction , two rbs - containing sequences were inserted between the genes ( details was illustrated in fig. s1 ) .
in order to evaluate the impact of the long gaps , we reconstructed this plasmid in a no - gap way ( method s3 ) .
the results demonstrated that our method still held 76 % of its efficiency with gaps comparing to the no - gap control .
then pacetone was transformed into e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) .
acetone production was confirmed by gc - ms ( fig. s3 ) .
fidelity of sha we sequenced all the constructs , total of 51.9 kb. two mutations were found to be introduced by the primers used and one mutation was introduced by dna polymerase during strand extension ( see table s1 for details ) .
this high fidelity was achieved by applying high - fidelity pcr mix and avoiding gel purification in which dna might be damaged by the uv light .
hybridization itself is n't likely to generate any mutation .
faulty recombination in contrast to previous methods , no faulty recombination was found for sha according to the restriction mapping ( fig. s2 ) and dna sequencing results .
this should owe to the special mechanism of sha , which relies on the recognition between long dna sequences compared with previous methods relying on the recognition between short sequences ( usually no longer than 50 bp ) .
to compare them more directly , we attempted to construct the pacetone using slic .
this was only a 4 - fragment assembly .
every fragment had two 50 bp homologous ends that mediate the construction .
rbs together with start codon , total of 18 bp , repeat twice in the homologous areas .
in the previous study , slic had a faulty recombination rate of 0 % for 5 - fragment assembly , but 83 % for 10 - fragment assembly [ 2 ] .
here we found that the short 18 bp repeats made the situation even worse .
as shown in fig. 6 , out of ten random picked transformants only two were assembled correctly .
seven lost acoad insert ; one lost all three inserts ( it was distinguished from pet28adeltalaci background by that it contained a residual insert corresponding to the first 28 bp of thl ) .

( a ) constructing pacetone by sha .
sfs recognized each other with complementary areas of 0.7 - 1.3 kb .
( b ) constructing pacetone by slic .
fragments recognized each other with their 50 bp homologous ends which were single stranded by t4 dna polymerase treatment .
repeated sequences ( 15 bp rbs + 3 bp atg ) is highlighted in red .
vector backbone ( green ) was amplified from pet28adeltalaci .
insert fragments thl , atoad and adc with homologous ends were generated by pcr ( table s4 ) .
( c ) 10 randomly picked constructions from a were digested with bglii and sali .
100 % gave out correct bands ( 1.2 kb , 2.1 kb , and 3.2 kb ) .
( d ) 10 randomly picked constructions from b were digested with bglii and sali .
only two ( lanes 2 and 5 ) had correct bands .
after sequencing , faulty recombinations were determined to be lacking of atoad ( lanes 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 - 9 ) or lacking of all three inserts ( lane 10 ) .
discussion dna hybridization was traditionally used for southern blotting and dna microarray .
here , we adapted it for dna construction , and developed an efficient method , termed sha. by harnessing the hybridization of sfs which were prepared to overlap each other , sha can assemble multiple dna fragments in a one - step fashion within two days .
unlike conventional cloning approaches that use restriction endonucleases or recombinases , sha is sequence - independent , and does n't require special equipment or enzyme .
firstly we demonstrated its feasibility by constructing plasmids from 4 , 6 and 8 fragments .
the assembly efficiency was found to be positively affected by overlap length and negatively affected by sf numbers .
then we showed its practical value in pathway and vector constructions .
sha depends on the recognition between long dna sequences .
the whole sequence of every dna fragment takes part in it. in previous methods , only a little part ( usually no longer than 50 bp ) of the dna fragment takes part in the recognition .
firstly , this difference makes sha more robust and efficient .
dnas do n't need to be gel purified or modified by any enzymes ; much longer gaps can be tolerated .
more importantly , unlike previous methods , sha is not affected by repeat sequences .
in synthetic biology , as people commonly need to use a genetic element , such as a promoter or a rbs , more than once for multi - gene expression , sha would be a better choice .
materials and methods bacterial strains e. coli dh5alpha was used for sha and e. coli bl21 ( de3 ) was used for gene expression .
media , chemicals and enzymes we used luria - bertani broth for culturing all our strains .
agar ( 1.5 %) was added to make solid medium .
antibiotics were used if necessary as follows : ampicillin ( amp , 50 microg ml - 1 ) , kanamycin ( kan , 50 microg ml - 1 ) , and chloramphenicol ( cm , 30 microg ml - 1 for e. coli and 5 microg ml - 1 for b. subtilis ) .
iptg was used to induce gene expression at 0.5 mm. pyrobest ( tm ) dna polymerase from takara was used for sf preparation .
easytaq ( tm ) dna polymerase from transgen was used for colony pcr screening .
sf preparation oe - pcr was performed by the version of shevchuk et al .
[ 11 ] , except that pyrobest ( tm ) dna polymerase was used throughout .
oe - ends had lengths of 30 - 50 bp. by following their two tips we can always obtain high product yield and purity on the first attempt .
first , use the two - step model including an overlap extension step without primers ( step a ) and an exponential amplification step with primers ( step b ) ; second , use nested primers , i. e. in step b the primers ( called wing primers or flanking primers ) should be within the product from step a , and have a distance above 50 bp from the ends .
the pcr mixtures ( each 50 microl ) were made according to manufacturer 's instructions : 0.2 mm each of dntp , 1xpyrobest buffer ii , 0.025 u microl - 1 pyrobest ( tm ) polymerase , 0.4 microm each of primers ( for step b ) or no primers ( for step a ) , and template .
for step a , two unpurified pcr - isolated elements were used as template at a final concentration of 5 ng microl - 1 each ; for step b , 2 microl of unpurified product from step a was used as template .
cycling parameters : for step a , initial denaturation 94degreesc 2 min , subsequent steps 94degreesc15 s , annealing at 56degreesc 20 s , extension 72degreesc 2 min , 10 cycles total , hold at 4degreesc ; for step b , initial denaturation 94degreesc 2 min , subsequent steps 94degreesc 15 s , annealing at 62degreesc 20 s , extension 72degreesc 4 min , 35 cycles total , final additional extension 72degreesc 3 min , hold at 4degreesc .
pcr templates and primers are all given in table s2 ; primer sequences are given in table s3 .
plasmid templates were linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes before using ( table s2. ) .
tailed primer pcr was performed similarly to regular pcr , except that the primer had a 5 ' end overhang .
in this case ( pokca2 construction ) , sfs were purified by e.z.n.a. ( tm ) cycle - pure kit ( omega ) to exclude residual primer oligonucleotides whose lengths were comparable to that of the overlaps .
in other cases , purification was omitted .
dna chemical synthesis was conducted by the shanghai generay biotech co. successive hybridization prepared sfs were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis .
roughly equal molar amounts of sfs ( about 200 ng microl - 1 each ) were mixed in a 1.5 ml polyethylene tube , treated with dpni at 37degreesc for 3 h to digest the plasmid templates , then sealed with parafilm for water - proof and submerged in a beaker of boiling water ( about 97 - 100degreesc ) , left there , till the water cooled to room temperature ( 18 - 25degreesc ) which usually took about 2 hours .
the reaction was transformed into e. coli competent cells with standard heat shock method [ 12 ] .
restriction mapping of the constructed plasmids plasmids were isolated from overnight cultures using e.z.n.a .
( tm ) plasmid mini kit from omega , subjected to restriction enzyme digestion , and then loaded to 1 % agarose gels to check their restriction digestion patterns by dna electrophoresis .
restriction enzymes used for every plasmid were listed in fig. s2 .

taking the issue of tumor categorization a step forward and establish molecular imprints to accompany histopathological assessment is a challenging task .
this is important since often patients with similar clinical and pathological tumors may respond differently to a given treatment .
protease - activated receptor - 1 ( par1 ) , a g protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) , is the first member of the mammalian par family consisting of four genes .
par1 and par2 play a central role in breast cancer .
the release of n - terminal peptides during activation and the exposure of a cryptic internal ligand in pars , endow these receptors with the opportunity to serve as a " mirror - image " index reflecting the level of cell surface par1 & 2 - in body fluids .
it is possible to use the levels of par - released peptide in patients and accordingly determine the choice of treatment .
we have both identified par1 c - tail as a scaffold site for the immobilization of signaling partners , and the critical minimal binding site .
this binding region may be used for future therapeutic modalities in breast cancer , since abrogation of the binding inhibits par1 induced breast cancer .
altogether , both par1 and par2 may serve as molecular probes for breast cancer diagnosis and valuable targets for therapy .
1. introduction the classification of a tumor differentiation level is routinely based on histopathological criteria whereby poorly differentiated tumors generally exhibit the worst prognoses .
however , the underlying molecular pathways that regulate the level of breast tumor development are as yet poorly described .
until now the pathological tissue criteria that entail tissue traits have not been defined by an appropriate set of genes .
a challenging task is to take the issue of breast tumor categorization a step forward and establish molecular imprints to accompany histopathological assessment .
this is important since often patients with similar clinical and pathological tumors may have a markedly different outcome in response to a given treatment .
these differences are encoded by and stem from the tumor genetic profile [ 1 ] .
individual gene signature may complement or replace the traditional pathological assessment in evaluating tumor behavior and risk .
this is the basis for optimizing our approach to personalized care whereby genomic finger prints may refine the prediction of the course of disease and the response to treatment [ 2 ] .
oncotype dx is a clinically validated and widely used multigene assay ( there are also other commercially available gene panels such as mammaprint ; agendia amsterdam , netherland , and theros h / i ; biotheranostics , san diego , ca ) , that quantifies the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence .
this gene profile has been developed specifically for women with hormone receptor - positive ( estrogen and progesterone receptor ; er , pr ) and lymph node - negative disease .
the gene profile consists of 21 genes that are associated with disease recurrence .
sixteen are cancer - related genes and 5 serve as reference genes .
this gene panel is used to calculate the recurrence score ( rs ) , a number that correlates with the specific likelihood of breast cancer recurrence within 10 years from the original diagnosis .
therefore , an ongoing goal is to identify important genes that play a central part in breast cancer biology and determine their relative function during the course of breast cancer progression [ 3 ] .
identification of these genes will significantly contribute to the prospect of treatment making choices .
protease - activated receptor - 1 ( par1 ) , a g protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) , is the first and prototype member of the mammalian par family consisting of four genes .
the activation of par1 involves the release of an n - terminal peptide and the exposure of an otherwise hindered ligand , resulting in an exclusive mode of activation .
this mode of activation serves as a general paradigm for the entire par family [ 4 - 6 ] .
while a well - known classical observation points to a close link between hyperactivation of the coagulation system and cancer malignancies , the molecular mechanism that governs procoagulant tumor progression remains poorly defined [ 7 - 10 ] .
thrombin is a main effector of the coagulation cascade .
in addition to cleaving fibrinogen , it also activates cells through at least three pars : par1 , par3 , and par4 .
in contrast , par2 is activated by multiple trypsin - like serine proteases including the upstream coagulant proteases viia - - tissue factor ( tf ) and xa , but not by thrombin .
it is now becoming well established that human par1 , hpar 1 , plays a central role in epithelial malignancies [ 13 , 14 , 16 ] .
par2 , the second member of the family , is also emerging with central assignments in breast cancer [ 11 , 12 ] .
high levels of hpar 1 expression are directly correlated with epithelia tumor progression in both clinically obtained biopsy specimens and a wide spectrum of differentially metastatic cell lines [ 13 , 14 ] .
par1 also plays a role in the physiological invasion process of placental cytotrophoblasts during implantation into the uterus deciduas [ 15 ] .
trophoblast invasion shares many features with the tumor cell invasion process .
it differs , however , by the time - limited hpar 1 expression , which is confined to the trophoblast - invasive period and is shut off immediately thereafter , when there is no need to invade [ 13 ] .
this strongly supports the notion that the hpar 1 gene is part of an invasive gene program .
surprisingly , the zinc - dependent matrix - metalloprotease 1 ( mmp - 1 ) , a collagenase that efficiently cleaves extra cellular matrix ( ecm ) and basement membrane components , has been shown to specifically activate par1 [ 16 ] .
par1 - mmp1 axis may thus provide a direct mechanistic link between par1 and tumor metastasis .
the mechanism that leads to hpar 1 gene overexpression in tumor is yet unclear and under current extensive investigation .
although the impaired internalization of par1 that results with persistent signaling and invasion was previously suggested for several breast cancer lines [ 17 ] , an imbalanced expression between hpar 1 repressors and activators was proposed , suggesting transcriptional regulation [ 18 ] .
we found that the mechanism of hpar 1 overexpression involves enhanced transcriptional activity , whereby enhanced rna chain elongation takes place in the aggressive cancer cells as compared with the nonaggressive , low metastatic potential cells [ 19 ] .
indeed , we have identified the egr - 1 transcription factor as a critical dna - binding protein eliciting hpar 1 expression in prostate cancer cells and the wt p53 tumor suppressor as an hpar 1 transcription repressor [ 19 , 20 ] .
the wt form of p53 thus acts as a fine - tuning regulator of hpar 1 in cancer progression .
2. prognostic parameters of pars the pars act as delicate sensors of extra cellular protease gradient to allow the cells to respond to a proteolytically modified environment .
the fact that par1 gene and protein overexpression are associated with the aggressiveness of a tumor , in vivo , reflect its potential role in cancer dissemination .
furthermore , it assigns par1 as an attractive target for anticancer therapy .
on the other hand , the release of an n - terminal peptide during activation and the exposure of an otherwise cryptic internal ligand in pars endow these receptors with the opportunity to serve as a " mirror - image " index reflecting in body fluids the level of pars on the surface of cancer cells .
hence , par1 and par2 peptides in the blood directly imitate par expression serving as a faithful indicator for the extent of cancer progression .
while the overexpression of both par1 and par2 takes place on the surface of cancer cells that are being constantly turned over in the body , yet there is no current information as to the half - life of the released peptides .
it is envisioned that measuring the level of released peptides may underline the severity of cancer .
another aspect is that the followup levels of par1 - released peptides may be instrumental in demonstrating the effectiveness of a given treatment .
for example , determining the level of the released par1 and par2 , through repeated measurements in the blood stream , may serve as a base line for a patient , and a sensitive indicator for response to a treatment .
if the released par peptides are becoming gradually low and finally disappear , it may reassure that the tumor is indeed regressing until finally the cancer disappears .
in contrast , if the level remains unchanged , it may indicate that the tumor is progressing despite of a given treatment .
a critical aspect , however , that needs to be addressed is the prospect of high released par1 & 2 peptides present during inflammation [ 21 , 22 ] .
therefore , the repeated followup of par released peptides is necessary for the purpose of demonstrating that during inflammation the high par - released peptide level is transient and disappears when the inflammatory response is over .
in contrast , in the case of a tumor , the level of par - released peptides remains constantly high .
the relative contribution of par1 versus par2 during the process of tumor progression is as yet unknown and is under current investigation .
one approach to decisively address this issue is by immunohistological staining ( of anti - par1 and anti - par2 antibodies , separately ) utilizing tissue microarray biopsy specimens on a large pool of primary breast cancer biopsy specimens representing invasive carcinoma .
such analysis will determine the relative percentage of par - positive individuals in a given cancer patient pool. whether pars join the triple negative population ( er - , pr - , and her - 2 / neu , an indicator of disease aggressiveness ) - - or perhaps stands independently as a prognostic marker - - needs to be evaluated .
3. pars as target for therapy importantly , par1 cellular trafficking and signal termination appear to occur in a different mode than other gpcrs .
instead of recycling back to the cell surface after ligand stimulation , activated par1 is sorted to the lysosomes where it is degraded [ 23 , 24 ] .
while cellular trafficking of par1 impinges on the extent and mode of signaling , the identification of individual par1 signaling partners and their contribution to breast cancer progression remain to be elucidated .
we have adopted the approach of utilizing a truncated form of hpar 1 gene devoid of the entire cytoplasmic tail to demonstrate the significant role of par1 signaling in breast tumor progression .
this was demonstrated in a xenograft mice model of mammary gland tumor development , in vivo [ 25 ] .
along this line of evidence , we have identified par1 c - tail as a scaffold site for the immobilization of signaling partners .
in addition to identifying key partners , we have determined the hierarchy of binding and established a region in par1 c - tail critical for breast cancer signaling .
this minimal binding domain may provide a potent platform for future therapeutic vehicles in treating breast cancer .
the above - described outcome is a brief summary of the detailed experimental approach illustrated bellow .
the functional outcome of mcf7 cells overexpressing various hpar 1 constructs in vivo was assessed by orthotopic mammary fat pad tumor development .
mcf7 cells overexpressing either persistent hpar1 y397z or wt hpar 1 constructs ( e.g. , mcf7 / y397z hpar 1 ; mcf7 / wt hpar 1 ) markedly enhanced tumor growth in vivo following implantation into the mammary glands , whereas mcf7 cells overexpressing truncated hpar 1 , devoid of the entire cytoplasmic tail , behaved similarly to control mcf7 cells in vector - injected mice , which developed only very small tumors .
the tumors obtained with mcf7 / wt hpar 1 and mcf7 / y397z hpar 1 were 5 and 5.8 times larger , respectively , than tumors produced by the mcf7 / empty vector - transfected cells .
histological examination ( h & e staining ) showed that while both mcf7 / wt hpar 1 and mcf7 / y397z hpar 1 tumors infiltrated into the fat pad tissues of the breast , the mcf7 / y397z hpar 1 tumors further infiltrated the abdominal muscle .
in contrast , tumors produced by empty vector or truncated hpar 1 - transfected cells were capsulated , with no obvious cell invasion .
tumor growth can also be attributed to blood vessel formation [ 26 , 27 ] .
the hpar 1 - induced breast tumor vascularization was assessed by immunostaining with antilectin and anti - cd31 antibodies , showing that both mcf7 / y397z hpar hpar 1 and mcf7 / wt hpar 1 tumors were intensely stained .
in contrast , only few blood vessels were found in the small tumors of empty vector or truncated hpar 1 .
thus , both mcf7 / wt hpar1 and mcf7 / y397z hpar 1 cells were shown to effectively induce breast tumor growth , proliferation , and angiogenesis , while the mcf7 / truncated hpar 1 and mcf7 / empty vector - expressing cells had no significant effect .
this experimental results highlight the significance of par1 signaling in par1 - induced breast cancer progression .
4. antibody array for protein - protein interactions reveals signaling candidates next , in order to identify specific par1 signaling components , the following approach was utilized .
to detect the putative mediator ( s ) linking par1 to potential signaling pathway , we examined a custom - made antibody - array membranes .
when aggressive breast carcinoma mda - mb - 435 cells ( with high hpar 1 levels ) were incubated with the antibody - array membranes before and after par1 activation ( 15 minutes ) , the following results were obtained .
several activation - dependent proteins which interact with par1 , including icam , c - yes , shc , and etk / bmx , were identified. of these proteins , we chose to focus here on etk / bmx and shc .
the epithelial tyrosine kinase ( etk ) , also known as bmx , is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is unique by virtue of being able to interact with both tyrosine kinase receptors and gpcrs [ 28 ] .
this type of interaction is mainly attributed to the pleckstrin homology ( ph ) which is followed by the src homology sh3 and sh2 domains and a tyrosine kinase site [ 29 ] .
etk / bmx - par1 interactions were characterized by binding of lysates exhibiting various hpar1 forms to gst - ph - etk / bmx .
while y397z hpar 1and wt hpar 1 showed specific association with etk / bmx , lysates of truncated hpar1 or jar cells ( lacking par1 ) exhibited no binding .
a tight association between the par1 c - tail and etk / bmx was obtained , independent of whether wt or kinase - inactive etk / bmx ( kq ) was used [ 29 , 30 ] .
5. hierarchy of binding next , we wished to determine the chain of events mediating the signaling of par1 and the binding of shc and etk / bmx to par1 c - tail .
shc is a well - recognized cell signaling adaptor known to associate with tyrosine - phosphorylated residues .
to this end , analysis of mcf7 cells that express little to no hpar 1 were ectopically forced to overexpress hpar 1 gene .
when coimmunoprecipitation with anti - par1 antibodies following par1 activation was performed , surprisingly , no shc was detected in the par1 immunocomplex .
shc association with par1 was fully rescued only when mcf7 cells were initially cotransfected with etk / bmx , resulting with abundant assembly of shc in the immunocomplex .
thus , etk / bmx is a critical component that binds first to activated par1 c - tail enabling the binding of shc .
shc may bind either to phosphorylated etk / bmx , via its sh2 domain , or in an unknown manner to the par1 c - tail , provided that etk / bmx is present and is par1 - bound complex .
one cannot , however , exclude the possibility that bmx binds first to shc , and only then the complex of etk / bmx - shc binds to par1 .
the functional consequences of the etk / bmx binding was further evaluated by inserting mutations to the " signal - binding " site .
we prepared hpar 1 constructs with successive replacement of the designated seven residues ( 378 - 384 ; cqryvys ) with a , termed as hpar 1 - 7a .
this ha tagged mutant , ha - hpar 1 - 7a , completely failed to immunoprecipitate etk / bmx .
in contrast , in the presence of ha - wt hpar 1 , potent immunoprecipitation was obtained .
we thus conclude that the critical region for etk / bmx binding to par1 c - tail resides in the vicinity of cqryvys .
the physiological significance of par1 - etk / bmx binding is emphasized by the following outcome .
activated mcf7 cells that express hpar 1 - 7a mutant failed to invade matrigel - coated membranes .
in - contrast , a potent invasion was obtained by activated wt hpar 1 .
this outcome highlights the fact that by preventing the binding of a key signaling partner to par1 c - tail , efficient inhibition of par1 pro - oncogenic functions , including the loss of epithelial cell polarity , migration , and invasion , is obtained ( see figures 1 and 2 for wt and mutated par1 c - tail and the ability to form a scaffold complexes with the signaling partners ) .
elucidation of the par1 c - tail binding domain may therefore provide a potent platform for future therapeutic vehicles in treating breast cancer .
the same approach may be utilized to identify a prime signaling partner for par2 .
this will eventually lead to characterization of a minimal par2 c - tail binding region .
generation of peptides that can enter the cells via adding tat or penetratin , or alternatively , addition of either myristoylation , or another lipid moiety , will assist the peptides to cross the cell membrane .
these peptides may prove as effective therapeutic inhibitors of pars - induced breast cancer growth and development .
along this line of evidence , successful par1 - derived peptides termed " pepducin " were developed by the group of kuliopulos a [ 31 ] .
this group has demonstrated that par1 - induced breast tumor in a mouse model , in vivo , is blocked by the cell - penetrating lipopeptide " pepducin ," p1pal - 7 , which is a potent inhibitor of cell viability in breast carcinoma cells expressing par1 .
it has been shown that p1pal - 7 is capable of promoting apoptosis in breast tumor xenografts and significantly inhibits metastasis to the lung .
in summary , pars may provide a timely effective challenge for developing valuable prognostic vehicles and also critical targets for therapy in breast cancer .
while the par prognostic vehicles stem from the extracelluar portion of the receptors , we offer the intracellular c - tail site as potential targets for therapy in breast cancer .
what is the relative contribution of par1 versus par2 in breast cancer tumor growth and development is yet an open question and a subject of current evaluation .
conflict of interests the authors have declared that no conflict of interests exists .

subtypes definition of breast cancer according to er , pr , and her2 / neu status .
additional categorization is suggested including pars status .
figure 2 activation of par1 leads to the association of etk / bmx with par1 c - tail .
this association is mediated through etk / bmx ph - domain enabling next the binding of shc .
the site of the " signal binding " domain ( e.g. , etk / bmx , as a prime signaling partner ) in par1 has been identified .
insertion of successive replacement of a residues forming a par1 mutant incapable of binding etk / bmx showed impaired capabilities of par1 induced invasion and migration .
this site provides therefore a platform for the development of future therapeutic medicaments in breast cancer .

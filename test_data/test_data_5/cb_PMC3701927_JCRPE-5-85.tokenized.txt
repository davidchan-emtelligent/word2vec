objective : morning cortisol levels are frequently used as screening tests for adrenal insufficiency in both adults and children .
reports differ on the specificity of this measurement .
the present study was undertaken to determine whether sex or pubertal status affected morning cortisol values .
methods : we measured morning cortisol levels and performed low - dose adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation test in 35 healthy male and female subjects ( ages 6 - 34 ) ranging in tanner stage ( ts ) from ts 1 to ts 5 .
testing was initiated at 08:00 after an overnight fast .
morning serum total cortisol , free cortisol , cortisol - binding globulin , estradiol ( males and females ) , and testosterone ( males ) were obtained .
results : morning total and free cortisol levels were significantly higher in ts 5 participants than in prepubertal children .
using a morning cortisol of 248 nmol / l todefine a normal value , 19 / 21 ( 90 %) of healthy ts 5 subjects exhibit normal values .
in contrast , 0 / 8 ts 1 healthy subjects exhibited a value greater than 248 nmol / l ( p = 0.0005 ) .
we also observed sex differences in morning cortisol levels in pubertal but not in prepubertal subjects .
we observed sex differences in morning cortisol levels in ts 5 individuals .
conclusions : morning cortisol measurements may be more useful as screening tests for adrenal function in adults than in children .
ts and sex may be considered in the decision to screen for adrenal insufficiency using morning cortisol or whether to proceed directly to stimulation testing .
conflict of interest : none declared .
morning cortisol diurnal rhythm adrenal insufficiency screening introduction the signs and symptoms of hypocortisolism are often nonspecific .
thus , the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency can be challenging .
correctly identifying adrenocortical insufficiency is important , as untreated adrenal insufficiency can be life - threatening .
conversely , inappropriate diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency could lead to unnecessary steroid replacement and eventual iatrogenic adrenocortical suppression .
a good screening test ideally should allow the clinician to identify patients who require further diagnostic testing as quickly and reliably as possible .
serum morning ( 08:00 ) cortisol estimations are often used as screening tests , as they are less invasive , and less complex to administer than stimulation testing .
the morning cortisol is meant to coincide with an individual 's diurnal peak in serum cortisol at approximately 08:00 ( 1 ) , and , when above a certain threshold , confirm hypothalamo - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis sufficiency .
there is no consensus in the medical literature regarding cut - off values for morning cortisol levels .
clinical signs and symptoms along with other biochemical parameters are important elements of diagnosis and should be taken into consideration when interpreting ambiguous basal levels and / or stimulation testing results .
upon review of screening tests performed in our pediatric endocrine clinic population , we noted a high incidence of failure to identify adrenal sufficiency using morning serum cortisol levels .
these failures appeared to be more common in younger children .
review of the literature failed to reveal any systematic investigations of morning cortisol levels in the pediatric population , with particular emphasis on sex and pubertal status .
to our knowledge , this is the first report to stratify serum morning cortisol screening with respect to sex and pubertal status in subjects with concomitant confirmatory adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) stimulation testing .
the central question of the current study was to determine the specificity of serum morning cortisol levels as a screen for adrenocortical sufficiency in healthy children and adults .
additionally , we sought to determine whether serum morning cortisol levels were sexually dimorphic or affected by pubertal status .
methods the study population comprised 35 participants ( 18 males and 17 females ) .
their mean age was 17.5 + 8 years ( range 6.7 - 34.3 years ) .
all subjects were determined to be healthy , based on pre - test screening and physical examinations .
all tanner stages ( ts ) were appropriate for age .
exclusion criteria included acute and chronic moderate - severe illness , use of oral contraceptives , pregnancy , recent use of inhaled , oral , or topical steroids ( within the previous 6 weeks ) , use of performance enhancing over - the - counter medications , or use of any other medications known to affect adrenal steroidogenesis .
the protocol was approved by the institutional review board of children 's mercy hospital and clinics .
informed consent and assent were obtained prior to testing .
stimulation testing was performed by experienced endocrine nurses .
all subjects fasted overnight .
the low - dose acth stimulation test was performed in all subjects using 1 mg cosyntropin ( cortrosyn , amphastar pharmaceuticals , rancho cucamonga , ca ) .
no stock solutions were used , and the dilution was carried out on each testing day to a final concentration of 1 microg / ml in a total volume of 1.0 ml diluted in 0.9 % normal saline .
testing was initiated at 08:00 .
blood samples were drawn from an i.v. cannula at 0 , and 10 , 20 , and 30 min after cosyntropin injection for determination of total cortisol .
free cortisol was measured at 0 and 30 min after injection .
additionally , estradiol ( males and females ) , testosterone ( males ) , and cortisol - binding globulin ( cbg ) were measured at baseline .
all post - menarcheal females were required to undergo urine pregnancy screening .
all participants older than 18 years of age were presumed to be ts 5 for pubertal development .
two male subjects underwent repeat testing because of missing time points .
for these subjects , the results of the repeat ( complete ) testing were used .
for the low - dose acth stimulation test , a normal response was defined as a peak serum cortisol concentration of equal to or greater than 495 nmol / l ( 2 ) .
any subject failing to mount a cortisol response of 495 nmol / l subsequently underwent high - dose ( 250 microg ) acth stimulation testing on a different testing day .
for this test , cortisol was measured at 0 and 60 min after acth injection .
a normal response was again defined as a cortisol level of equal to or greater than 495 nmol / l. total and free serum cortisol levels were measured by liquid chromatography / tandem massspectrometry and equilibrium dialysis / radioimmunoassay , respectively ( quest diagnostics - nichols institute , san juan capistrano , ca ) .
the lower limit of detection ( lod ) for total cortisol was 1.1 nmol / l. the interassay coefficients of variation were 7.6 % , 4.8 % , and 6.6 % for low , medium , and high cortisol values , and intraassay coefficients of variation were 3.8 % , 3.0 % , and 4.6 % for low , medium , and high cortisol levels .
the lower limit of detection for free cortisol was 0.8 nmol / l. for low free cortisol levels , the interassay and intraassay coefficients of variation were 14.7 % and 9.8 % , respectively .
for high free cortisol levels , the interassay and intraassay coefficients of variation were 13.1 % and 8.2 % , respectively .
cbg was measured by radioimmunoassay ( quest diagnostics - nichols institute , san juan capistrano , ca ) .
serum estradiol and testosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay ( test kits from diagnostic products corporation , los angeles , ca ) in the clinical endocrinology laboratory of children 's mercy hospital and clinics .
the lod for estradiol was 5 pg / ml with interassay and intraassay coefficients of variation of 5 % .
the lod for testosterone was 4 ng / ml. the interassay coefficients of variation of 12 % and 6 % at low and high testosterone levels , and the intraassay coefficient of variation was 5 % .
statistical analysis all of the hypotheses involving group comparisons were evaluated using anova .
because cortisol is secreted in a pulsatile fashion , data were not always normally distributed .
therefore , log cortisol and log free cortisol values were used for all comparisons .
correlation coefficients were calculated by using the log of total and free cortisol levels.the sufficiency / insufficiency rates were compared using the fisher 's exact test .
results maturational effects on morning total and free cortisol values morning ( 08:00 ) total cortisol values were higher in ts 5 individuals compared to ts 1 individuals when data from males and females were combined [ log ( total cortisol ) = 2.5 +/ - 0.13 mmol / l in ts 5 versus 2.3 +/ - 0.07 mmol / l in ts 1 participants ; p = 0.0007 ( mean +/ - sd )] morning free cortisol values were also higher in ts 5 individuals compared to ts 1 individuals .
log ( free cortisol ) was 1.6 +/ - 0.19 mmol / l in ts 5 versus 1.2 +/ - 0.29 mmol / l in ts 1 participants ( p = 0.0016 ) .
using one published definition of a normal ( unstimulated ) a.m. cortisol value of 248 nmol / l ( 3 ) , we observed maturational differences in " normal " values .
zero of 8 ts 1 subjects displayed values > 248 nmol / l. in contrast , 19 of 21 ts 5 subjects passed this definition of normal ( p = 0.0005 ) .
as we recruited healthy subjects with no risk factors for adrenal insufficiency , specificity for the 8 am cortisol of 248 nmol / l was 0 % in ts 1 individuals and 95 % in ts 5 individuals .
sex effects on morning total and free cortisol values the data were also analyzed by stratifying ts 1 and ts 5 individuals separately by sex .
figure 1 shows the log of total and free cortisol values in ts 1 and 5 males and females .
ts 5 males displayed significantly higher morning total cortisol levels compared to ts 1 males ( figure 1a ; * p = 0.0001 ) .
ts 5 males also displayed significantly higher morning total cortisol levels compared to ts 5 females ( figure 1a ; + p = 0.005 ) .
ts 5 males also displayed significantly higher morning free cortisol levels compared to ts 1 males ( figure 1b ; * p = 0.0007 ) and significantly higher morning free cortisol levels compared to ts 5 females ( figure 1b ; + p = 0.018 ) .
relationships between ts and total and free cortisol values no strong correlation was seen between ts and log total cortisol values in females ( figure 2a ; r = 0.19 ; p = 0.042 ) .
however , a strong direct correlation was seen between ts and log total cortisol values in males ( figure 2b ; r = 0.64 ; p = 0.001 ) .
a formula could be derived for the relationships between ts and total cortisol values in males , as follows : log ( total cortisol ) = 0.07 ( ts ) + 2.3 .
figure 3a shows the ts versus log of free a.m. cortisol in females .
figure 3b shows the ts versus log a.m. free cortisol in males .
strong direct correlations were also seen between ts and log total free values in both females and males ( figure 3a , r = 0.56 , p = 0.018 in females ; figure 3b , r = 0.72 , p = 0.0003 in males ) .
formulae could be derived for the relationships between ts and free cortisol values .
in females : log ( free cortisol ) = 0.32 ( ts ) + 0.86 .
in males : log ( free cortisol ) = 0.08 ( ts ) + 1.2 .
maturational and sex effects on acth stimulation testing no maturational differences were seen in delta cortisol values , peak cortisol values , free cortisol values , or delta cortisol values in the acth stimulation testing .
no sex differences were observed in peak total or free cortisol or in incremental rise of total or peak cortisol ( data not shown ) .
maturational and sex effects on cbg no maturational or sex differences were seen in cbg levels .
males exhibited cbg levels of 30.9 +/ - 4.9 mg / ml and females exhibited cbg levels of 30.3 +/ - 4.0 mg / ml ( mean +/ - sd ; p = 0.7 ) .
ts 1 participants exhibited cbg levels of 29.6 +/ - 5.6 mg / ml and ts 5 participants cbg levels of 31.2 +/ - 4.9 mg / ml ( p = 0.5 ) .
specificity of low - dose acth stimulation testing utilizing a cortisol level of 495 nmol / l to define a passing level for the low - dose acth stimulation test ( 2 ) , 31 out of 35 ( 89 %) of our population of healthy subjects exhibited adequate cortisol responses .
as we recruited healthy subjects with no risk factors for adrenal insufficiency , specificity for this test is 89 % .
no sex differences or maturational differences in pass rate were observed .
utilizing a stimulated cortisol level of 415 nmol / l , 33 / 35 subjects passed , yielding a specificity of 94 % .
all 4 subjects who failed low - dose acth stimulation testing underwent repeat testing with high - dose acth .
one subject passed with a peak cortisol of 660 nmol / l. three subjects , including two sisters , displayed subnormal responses to high - dose acth stimulation tests .
these subjects peaked at 440 nmol / l , 440 nmol / l and 468 nmol / l. the subjects denied any exposure to glucocorticoids or steroid hormones .
a thorough endocrine work up ruled out congenital adrenal hyperplasia and failed to reveal any other etiology for adrenal insufficiency .
data from the subjects in mid - puberty were not included in the analyses of sex differences or maturational differences , as only ts 1 and ts 5 subjects were utilized for these analyses .
discussion this current study demonstrates both maturational and sex differences in morning cortisol measurements .
these maturational and sex differences may have implications for clinical practice when using morning serum cortisol as a screen for hpa axis function .
our study suggests that morning cortisol levels are less likely to confirm adrenal sufficiency in prepubertal individuals compared to sexually mature individuals .
an additional finding is sex differences in the sexually mature participants : morning cortisol levels are significantly higher in ts 5 males than in ts 5 females .
the maturational and sex differences in cortisol levels do not appear to relate to maturational or sex differences in cbg because free cortisol levels parallel the total cortisol levels .
furthermore , no maturational or sex differences were seen in cbg levels .
in contrast to our findings with unstimulated 08:00 cortisol levels , our data revealed no major maturational or sex differences in cortisol responses to low - dose acth stimulation testing .
the main limitation of this study is its small sample size , with study participant numbers becoming smaller when data are grouped by sex and sexual maturity .
our work is the first in children that has systematically examined the relationships among serum cortisol , sex , and pubertal status .
all of our participants were clinically examined in order to ensure accurate tanner staging .
furthermore , all participants underwent stimulation testing to further determine the functionality of the hpa axis .
some studies have advocated the use of morning cortisol levels for screening hpa axis in children and adults .
morning plasma cortisol levels above 524 nmol / l or below 83 nmol / l can possibly serve as reasonable predictors of normal , or abnormal hpa function , respectively ( 4 ) .
clinically , however , most a.m. cortisol levels fall intermediate to these levels .
in one study , a passing level for basal cortisol was 248 nmol / l ( 3 ) .
others have indicated that levels above 420 to 450 nmol / l indicated healthy hpa axes ( 5,6 ) .
tordjman states that a basal cortisol of 276 nmol / l or greater is commonly felt to indicate a normal hpa axis ( 4 ) .
yet , in a group of participants with known impaired hpa function based on hypoglycemia or metyrapone , the average morning cortisol was 306 nmol / l ( 2 ) .
a meta - analysis of pediatric data from three studies ( 211 children ) indicated that if the morning cortisol is > 415 nmol / l , then adrenal insufficiency is unlikely .
in contrast , if the morning cortisol is <= 88 nmol / l , then adrenal insufficiency is likely to be present ( 7 ) .
if a patient 's morning cortisol level is in the 88 - 415 nmol / l range , a need for further diagnostic testing is indicated .
exactly what the designated cut - off value should be for children and adults has not been determined conclusively in the medical literature .
it is important to take individual biochemical and clinical features into consideration when determining whether further diagnostic testing is needed .
we have compared our study with previous studies examining maturational effects .
a study examining diurnal salivary cortisol rhythms in tsimane'amazon foragers demonstrated strong age effects across human development , with basal levels and slopes increasing into adulthood and flattening over age 60 .
the observations in this population were different from industrialized populations in that they revealed lower hpa activity overall .
therefore , not all conclusions may be appropriate for generalization to the industrialized world ( 8 ) .
an examination of diurnal salivary monitoring in school - aged children revealed that cortisol concentrations were higher in 9 - year - old children compared to 6 - 7 - year - old children ( 9 ) .
age - matched postmenarcheal girls exhibited higher cortisol levels than premenarcheal girls , but this was only seen in the evening .
additional studies ( 10,11 ) have demonstrated higher cortisol concentrations in postmenarcheal females irrespective of sampling time ( morning , midday , evening ) and have found statistically significant differences in salivary cortisol concentrations at different pubertal stages .
however , pubertal status was estimated based on age alone and not on tanner staging by clinical examination , as it was in our study .
rosmalen et al ( 12 ) found no significant correlations between ts and cortisol level for all subjects , or for males and females separately. of note , pubertal stage was determined by parent interview using schematic drawings .
this method may be inaccurate , particularly for boys , when the only sign of puberty at age 10 - 12 may be a modest increase in testicular volume .
this study found no significant correlation between bmi and cortisol levels .
we have compared our study with previous studies in the literature examining the effects of sex on cortisol levels .
interestingly , klimes - dougan et al ( 13 ) demonstrated sex differences in cortisol levels among adolescents and reported higher values in females at midday and later afternoon .
in another study ( 9 ) , there were no sex differences in the median cortisol values for all children ages 6 - 18 years , and median cortisol values from different times of the day were used .
rosmalen et al ( 12 ) conducted a large study on dutch children ( ages 10 - 12 ) and found that salivary cortisol levels differed between boys and girls in the morning but not in the evening .
sex differences were already present in prepubertal children and significant differences were found between boys and girls in ts 1 , with girls having higher a.m. cortisol levels .
other factors have been shown to affect cortisol levels in children , such as weight , insulin sensitivity , circadian rhythms , transcortin levels , sleep - wake cycles and stress factors like anxiety and depression ( 14,15,16,17,18 ) .
the relationship between individual cortisol variability and psychosocial factors is likely an important moderating factor in hpa functioning that is not fully understood .
metabolic factors such as obesity , glucose tolerance and metabolic syndrome are well known to affect morning cortisol levels .
weigensberg et al ( 19 ) found that serum morning cortisol levels were higher in overweight latino youths with metabolic syndrome , and that those with impaired fasting glucose had significantly higher morning cortisols than those who had normal fasting glucose .
salivary cortisol levels have been shown to be increased in obese children with anxiety or depression compared to obese children without affective morbidity .
this indicates that the emotional milieu of an obese child is likely to further affect the hpa axis ( 20 ) .
future research direction could include larger scale studies of morning cortisol levels in children throughout various stages of puberty .
our study suggests that type 2 statistical errors may occur , ( i.e. , real differences are not detected ) if cortisol values from pediatric participants are not stratified by both ts and sex .
we have provided evidence that serum morning cortisol levels may not be as clinically useful in assessing adrenal function in prepubertal children compared to older children .
further , morning cortisol levels may not be as helpful in females compared to males in assessing adrenal function , regardless of sexual maturity state .
both ts and sex should be taken into account when interpreting screening tests clinically .
in addition , ts and sex need to be considered in the decision to screen for adrenal insufficiency using morning cortisol or whether to proceed directly to stimulation testing .

the effect of marine - derived omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n - 3 pufa ) on long - term outcome in renal transplant recipients ( rtr ) remains unclear .
we investigated whether marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is associated with all - cause and cardiovascular ( cv ) mortality in rtr .
intake of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid ( epa - dha ) was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire .
cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations of epa - dha intake with all - cause and cv mortality .
we included 627 rtr ( age 53 +/ - 13 years ) .
epa - dha intake was 102 ( 42 - 215 ) mg / day .
during median follow - up of 5.4 years , 130 ( 21 %) rtr died , with 52 ( 8.3 %) due to cv causes .
epa - dha intake was associated with lower risk of all - cause mortality ( hazard ratio ( hr ) 0.85 ; 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % ci ) 0.75 - 0.97 ) .
age ( p = 0.03 ) and smoking status ( p = 0.01 ) significantly modified this association , with lower risk of all - cause and cv mortality particularly in older ( hr 0.75 , 95 % ci 0.61 - 0.92 ; hr 0.68 , 95 % ci 0.48 - 0.95 ) and non - smoking rtr ( hr 0.80 , 95 % ci 0.68 - 0.93 ; hr 0.74 , 95 % ci 0.56 - 0.98 ) .
in conclusion , marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is inversely associated with risk of all - cause and cv mortality in rtr .
the strongest associations were present in subgroups of patients , which adds further evidence to the plea for epa - dha supplementation , particularly in elderly and non - smoking rtr .
renal transplant recipients omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cardiovascular mortality all - cause mortality 1 .
introduction renal transplantation offers superior survival , quality of life , and cost - effectiveness in comparison with chronic dialysis treatment [ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 ] .
thus , it is considered the " gold standard " treatment for most patients with end - stage renal disease .
however , compared to age - matched controls in the general population , the survival of renal transplant recipients ( rtr ) continues to be significantly lower [ 9 ] , with cardiovascular ( cv ) disease as the most important contributor to excess of mortality in rtr [ 10,11 ] .
the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids may reduce the cv risk profile .
consequently , several countries and organizations such as the world health organization have made population - based diet recommendations for omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n - 3 pufa ) intake .
fish are the major food source of the n - 3 pufas docosahexaenoic acid ( dha , c22:6 n - 3 ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa , c20:5 n - 3 ) .
thus , recommendations of epa - dha intake can easily be met by following dietary guidelines such as those of the american heart association , which advises consumption of at least two fish meals per week [ 11,12 ] .
evidence from both epidemiologic and interventional studies have shown that epa and dha may exert beneficial effects on all - cause and cv mortality in both patients with pre - existing cv disease as well as in healthy populations [ 13,14,15,16,17,18,19 ] .
prospective epidemiological studies have shown that weekly fish intake is associated with lower rates of coronary heart disease ( chd ) mortality in men [ 20,21,22 ] .
it has also been shown in women that intake of fish and n - 3 pufa are inversely associated with risk of chd death [ 23 ] .
furthermore , in a study conducted across 36 countries , fish intake was associated with a reduced risk from all - cause and ischemic heart disease mortality [ 24 ] .
in addition , interventional studies have reported a reduction in all - cause mortality in male survivors of a myocardial infarction ( mi ) , who were advised to increase their dietary intake of oily fish [ 25 ] .
the largest randomized control trial testing the efficacy of n - 3 pufa for secondary prevention of chd so far included 11.324 patients .
it showed a 15 % reduction in the primary end point of death , nonfatal mi , and nonfatal stroke , and a 20 % reduction in all - cause mortality in patients receiving n - 3 pufa supplementation [ 26 ] .
in rtr , a recent observational cohort study performed in a total of 1990 norwegian patients found that high levels of plasma phospholipid marine n - 3 pufa were independently associated with better long - term survival late after renal transplantation [ 27 ] .
however , this study was on plasma biomarker status and not on intake per se. hence , a recent systematic report from the cochrane collaboration concluded that there is still insufficient evidence to recommend fish oil supplementation to improve survival of rtr [ 28 ] .
nonetheless , in a recent study with relatively short follow - up , we found a trend towards an inverse association of intake of marine - derived n - 3 pufa with all - cause mortality in rtr [ 29 ] .
we therefore set out to update data on intake of marine - derived n - 3 pufa and to extend follow - up to increase power for prospective evaluation of the association of marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake with all - cause and cv mortality in the cohort of stable outpatient rtr .
for this purpose , we investigated the intake of epa and dha , and evaluated its association with risk of all - cause and cv mortality in rtr .
2. methods 2.1 .
study design an observational prospective study was conducted in a large single center rtr cohort [ 30 ] .
all adult (>= 18 years old ) rtr with a functioning allograft for at least one year after transplantation and without known or apparent systemic illnesses ( i.e. , malignancies , opportunistic infections ) who visited our outpatient clinic between november 2008 and march 2011 were invited to participate in this prospective cohort study. from a total of 817 rtr invited to be enrolled , 707 ( 87 %) patients signed informed consent .
we excluded all patients missing dietary or laboratory data , resulting in 627 rtr eligible for the statistical analysis .
the present study was conducted according to the guidelines settled in the declaration of helsinki , and the institutional review board approved the study protocol ( metc 2008 / 186 ) .
the primary long - term endpoints of the current study were all - cause and cv mortality in rtr .
the continuous surveillance system of the outpatient program ensures up - to - date information on patient status .
we contacted general practitioners or referring nephrologists in cases the status of a patient was unknown .
the patients were followed until 30 september 2015 , with no loss to follow - up .
2.2 .
renal transplant characteristics rtr were all transplanted in the university medical center groningen and had no history of drug or alcohol addiction according to their patient files .
rtr were on standard antihypertensive and immunosuppressive therapy .
except for discouraging excess sodium intake and encouraging losing weight in overweight individuals , no specific dietary counseling was included as a routine regimen , nor was dietary recommendation regarding n - 3 pufa intake advised to participants .
relevant characteristics including recipient age , gender , cv history , and transplant information were extracted from patient records .
self - report questionnaires were used to obtain information on smoking behavior and alcohol intake .
physical activity was assessed using the short questionnaire to assess health - enhancing physical activity ( squash ) score in time multiplied by intensity [ 31 ] .
2.3 .
dietary assessment dietary intake was assessed with a semi - quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire ( ffq ) that was developed at wageningen university [ 32 ] .
the questionnaire inquired about intake of 177 food items during the last month .
for each item , the frequency was documented in times per day , week , or month .
the number of servings was recorded in natural units ( for example , slice of bread or apple ) or household measures ( for example , cup or spoon ) .
the questionnaire was self - administered and filled in at home .
all ffq were checked for completeness on the day of the visit to the outpatient clinic by a trained researcher .
the results of the ffq were converted into total energy and nutrient intake by using the dutch food composition table of 2006 [ 33 ] .
2.4 .
measurements all measurements were performed once at baseline during a morning visit to the outpatient clinic .
body weight and height were measured with patients wearing indoor clothing without shoes .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ( kg / m2 ) , and body surface area ( bsa ) was estimated in meters squared ( m2 ) [ 34 ] .
blood pressure , heart rate , and mean arterial pressure were measured according to a strict protocol and determined with a semi - automatic device ( dinamap 1846 , critikon , tampa , fl , usa ) .
blood pressure and heart rate were measured every minute for 15 min , and the last three measurements were averaged [ 35 ] .
blood was drawn after a fasting period of 8 - 12 h , which included no medication intake .
diabetes was defined as use of antidiabetic medication , fasting plasma glucose >= 7.0 mmol / l [ 36 ] or glycated hemogloblin ( hba1c ) higher than 6.5 as proposed by shabir et al .
[ 37 ] .
serum creatinine levels were measured with a modified version of the jaffe method ( mega au 510 , merck diagnostica , darmstadt , germany ) .
serum cystatin c concentrations were measured by gentian cystatin c immunoassay ( gentian as , moss , norway ) on a modular analyzer ( roche diagnostics , mannheim , germany ) .
renal function was assessed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) based on the ckd - epi equation of creatinine / cystatine c developed as proposed by terpos et al .
[ 38 ] .
serum albumin , high - sensitivity c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) , hba1c , triglycerides , low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) - , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) - , and total cholesterol were measured according to routine laboratory methods .
according to a strict protocol , all rtr were asked to collect a 24 - h urine sample during the day before their visit to the outpatient clinic .
total urinary protein concentration was determined using the biuret reaction ( mega au 150 , merck diagnostica , darmstadt , germany ) .
proteinuria was defined as urinary protein excretion >= 0.5 g / 24 h .
2.5 .
statistical analyses data analysis was performed using spss version 22.0 software ( ibm corp. , armonk , ny , usa ) , stata version 13 ( statacorp lp , college station , tx , usa ) and r version 3.2.3 ( r foundation for statistical computing , vienna , austria ) .
in all analyses , a two - sided p < 0.05 was considered significant .
continuous variables were summarized using mean ( standard deviation , sd ) for normally distributed data , whereas skewed distributed variables are given as median ( interquartile range ( iqr )) ; percentages were used to summarize categorical variables .
marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake was accounted as the sum of epa and dha intake ( 100 mg / day ) adjusted for total energy intake ( kj / day ) according to the residual method [ 39 ] .
linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association of marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake with baseline characteristics .
natural log transformation was used for analyses of variables with a skewed distribution .
schoenfeld residuals of epa - dha intake ( per 100 mg ) were checked : the assumption of proportional hazards was not violated ( p = 0.65 ) .
in prospective analyses , cox - proportional hazard regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations of marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake as continuous variable , with all - cause and cv mortality in rtr .
analyses were performed with adjustment for age and sex ( model 1 ) and additional adjustment for egfr , proteinuria , and time between transplantation and baseline measurement ( model 2 ) .
to avoid the inclusion of too many variables for the number of events , further models were performed with additive adjustments to model 2 .
we performed additional adjustment for smoking status , alcohol use , and physical activity ( model 3 ) ; for bmi , diabetes mellitus , and cv history ( model 4 ) ; for ldl - , total cholesterol , triglycerides concentration , and systolic blood pressure ( model 5 ) ; for hs - crp and albumin concentration ( model 6 ) .
hazard ratios ( hr ) of cox - regression models are reported with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
in secondary analyses , we performed stratified analyses according to subgroups of age , sex , bmi , diabetes , cardiovascular history , renal function , smoking status , alcohol use , and physical activity .
we also tested for interaction to identify potential effect modification .
3. results 3.1 .
baseline characteristics baseline characteristics of rtr are shown in table 1 .
a total of 627 patients were included .
at a median ( iqr ) of 5.7 ( 2.0 - 12.2 ) years after transplantation , participants were 53 +/ - 13 years old and 56.3 % were male .
the patients were slightly overweight ( bmi 26.6 +/ - 4.7 ) , and 152 ( 24.2 %) had diabetes .
mean blood pressure of rtr was within normal boundaries ( 136 +/ - 17 / 83 +/ - 11 mmhg ) .
it should , however , be noted that 552 ( 88 %) of the 627 participants were using antihypertensive drugs .
mean egfr was 45 +/ - 19 ml / min / 1.73 m2 and 139 ( 22.2 %) patients had proteinuria .
mean serum total cholesterol was 5.1 +/ - 1.1 mmol / l , while statins were taken by 333 ( 53.1 %) of the rtr .
eighty - seven percent of rtr reported the use of alcohol and 12.3 % were current smokers .
smoking status was unknown in 25 ( 4.0 %) of rtr .
total energy intake was 8756 ( 7224 - 10,636 ) kj / day .
epa , dha , and dha - epa intake were 39 ( 13 - 85 ) , 60 ( 28 - 129 ) , and 102 ( 42 - 215 ) mg / day , respectively .
3.2 .
association between intake of marine - derived n - 3 pufa with clinical baseline characteristics the association between epa - dha intake with clinical baseline characteristics is shown in table 1 .
epa - dha intake was positively associated with age ( std.beta = 0.13 , p = 0.001 ) and bmi ( std.beta = 0.08 , p = 0.04 ) , and was negatively associated with alcohol use ( std.beta = - 0.14 , p < 0.001 ) .
results of multivariate cox - proportional hazard regression analyses are shown in table 2 .
during follow - up of 5.4 ( 4.9 - 6.0 ) years , 130 ( 20.7 %) rtr died .
epa - dha intake was associated with lower risk of all - cause mortality ( model 2 : hr 0.85 ; 95 % ci 0.75 - 0.97 , p = 0.02 ) independent of potential confounders including age , sex , egfr , proteinuria , and time between transplantation and baseline .
this inverse association remained significant after additional adjustment for other potential confounders .
the association of epa - dha intake with cv mortality was of similar magnitude , but did not reach statistical significance ( model 2 : hr 0.83 , 95 % ci 0.68 - 1.02 , p = 0.08 ) .
in secondary analyses , we found effect modification of age ( p = 0.03 ) and smoking status ( p = 0.01 ) on the association of epa - dha intake with all - cause mortality , independent of age and sex ( figure 1 ) .
consequently , we proceeded with further prospective stratified - analyses by subgroups of age (< or >= 63 years old ) and smoking status ( non - smokers or smokers ) , as depicted in table s1 and table s2 , respectively .
epa - dha intake was associated with lower risk of all - cause mortality within the older subgroup of patients ( model 2 : hr 0.75 ; 95 % ci 0.61 - 0.92 , p = 0.01 ) but not within the younger subgroup of rtr ( model 2 : hr 0.98 ; 95 % ci 0.85 - 1.18 , p = 0.8 ) .
likewise , epa - dha intake was associated with lower risk of cv mortality within the older subgroup of rtr ( model 2 : hr 0.68 ; 95 % ci 0.48 - 0.95 , p = 0.02 ) , but not in the younger subgroup of patients ( model 2 : hr 1.02 ; 95 % ci 0.80 - 1.29 , p = 0.9 ) .
4. discussion in this study , we show that marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is inversely associated with risk of all - cause mortality in a large cohort of stable outpatients rtr , and we show an association of similar magnitude - - though not statistically significant - - of marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake on the risk of cv mortality in rtr .
we also show that age and smoking status are effect - modifiers of the association of marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake with all - cause mortality .
accordingly , further prospective age - stratified analysis shows that marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is inversely associated with risk of all - cause and cv mortality within the older ( cut - off point 63 years old ) , but not the younger subgroup of rtr .
likewise , prospective smoking status - stratified analysis shows that marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is inversely associated with risk of all - cause and cv mortality within the non - smoker patient subgroup , but not within the subgroup of smoker rtr .
in the general population , it has been largely shown that marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake may exert beneficial effects on both cv endpoints and all - cause mortality [ 13,14,15,16,17,18,19 ] .
the mechanisms by which increased ingestion of n - 3 pufas exert favorable effects on cv health are not fully known ; however , it has been proposed that reducing susceptibility of the heart to ventricular arrhythmia , retarding growth of atherosclerotic plaques , reducing adhesion molecule expression , reducing platelet - derived growth factor , promoting nitric oxide - induced endothelial relaxation and anti - inflammatory effects may be underlying mechanisms involved [ 13 ] .
up - to - date results regarding their potential beneficial effects on survival after renal transplantation remain controversial thus far .
previously , eide and colleagues reported that in a cohort of 1990 norwegian rtr with 406 deaths events at a median follow - up of 6.8 years , higher plasma phospholipid marine n - 3 pufa levels were independently associated with better patient survival in rtr [ 40 ] .
importantly , this study was not performed on intake per se , but on plasma biomarker status of marine - derived n - 3 pufa , which is a resultant of intake and metabolism .
however , a recent systematic report from the cochrane collaboration concluded that there is still insufficient evidence to recommend fish oil supplementation to improve survival of rtr [ 28 ] .
on the basis of the latter statement , it seems that the beneficial effect of marine - derived n - 3 pufa on survival of rtr remains under discussion .
importantly , it is critical to consider that inconsistent results across the three randomized control trials accounted in this systematic review ( for the outcome of mortality in rtr ) may arise from methodological problems such as differing doses of fish oils , duration and timing of treatment , small number of patients , and a number of events too low to establish definitive conclusions .
previously , we reported a trend towards an inverse association of intake of marine - derived n - 3 pufa with all - cause mortality in rtr , with relatively short follow - up of rtr [ 29 ] .
the current study updated data on n - 3 pufa intake and extended follow - up of our cohort .
the findings of the current study support the notion [ 17,18,19,27 ] that marine - derived n - 3 pufas exert beneficial effects on long - term survival after renal transplantation .
moreover , our findings support that favorable outcomes offered by marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake may vary among different subgroups of rtr according to age and smoking status .
it is not completely understood which are the underlying mechanisms that explain the effect modification of age on the association of n - 3 pufa intake with mortality .
despite the fact that chronic low - grade inflammation remains after renal transplantation and that many of the beneficial effects of n - 3 pufa have been attributed to their anti - inflammatory properties [ 41 ] , we did not find an association of n - 3 pufa intake with inflammatory biomarkers .
however , it has been shown that independently of any influence on inflammation , n - 3 pufa may be an effective intervention against anabolic resistance [ 42,43,44,45 ] , which is known to be one of the main causes of age - related sarcopenia .
animal studies have shown that n - 3 pufas improve whole - body - as well as muscle insulin - sensitivity [ 46 ] .
moreover , n - 3 pufa supplementation helps to maintain whole - body protein metabolism via mtor signaling pathways [ 47 ] .
in healthy young adults , n - 3 pufa supplementation has been shown to increase the anabolic response [ 43 ] , and particularly in older adults , an increase of muscle protein synthesis has been reported [ 42 ] .
thus , one might speculate that the effect modification of age on the association of n - 3 pufas with mortality could be at least partly explained through the beneficial effect of n - 3 pufas on muscle protein synthesis .
regarding smoking status as an effect modifier , it should be noted that it has previously been suggested that oral supplementation of marine - derived n - 3 pufa may have effects that are distinct between smokers and non - smokers [ 48 ] .
research regarding biomarkers of n - 3 pufa has already shown that n - 3 pufa biomarkers are lower in smokers .
it is noteworthy that this relationship was independent of dietary intake of n - 3 pufas [ 49 ] .
furthermore , it has been suggested that smoking may affect fatty acid absorption and metabolism [ 50 ] , including increased n - 3 lipid peroxidation in smokers [ 51,52 ] .
future studies are needed to better understand the effect of smoking on the metabolism of n - 3 pufas .
the strengths of our study include a median follow - up of 5.4 years with all - cause and cv mortality as clinically relevant endpoints , without loss of participants due to follow - up. furthermore , our study included a large sample size of the specific setting of stable outpatient rtr .
moreover , data was extensively collected , which allowed adjustment for many potential confounders of the main results .
on the other hand , we acknowledge that the current study has several limitations ; for example , marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake was measured using a self - reporting ffq , which could lead to possible over - or under - reporting of dietary intake .
moreover , dietary intake was only measured on baseline and therefore changes in dietary intake during the follow - up period might not be accounted for in our analysis .
the higher the intra - individual variation of n - 3 pufa intake along the follow - up period would be , the greater one would expect the benefit of repeated measurement for prediction of outcomes [ 53,54 ] .
plasma biomarkers of n - 3 pufa were not available in this cohort study .
data regarding plasma status of marine - derived n - 3 pufa could have provided better understanding of the relation between dietary intake with plasma levels of marine - derived n - 3 pufa biomarkers .
further , cv complications or interventions were not documented ; therefore , we were unable to assess the effect of dietary intake of n - 3 pufa on non - fatal cv - events .
additionally , our study population consisted predominantly of caucasian people , which calls for prudence to extrapolate our results to different populations with regard to ethnicity .
finally , since the current study is observational by design , no conclusions of causality can be drawn from our results .
5. conclusions in conclusion , marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is inversely associated with a lower risk of all - cause mortality in rtr .
furthermore , according to effect modifiers of this association , the beneficial effects of marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake are different over subgroups of rtr .
thus , marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is inversely associated with all - cause and cv mortality in the older but not the younger subgroup of patients .
in turn , marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake is associated with lower risk of all - cause and cv mortality in the non - smoker but not in the smoker subgroup of rtr .
our findings support the protective effect of marine - derived n - 3 pufa intake on all - cause and cv mortality that has been previously reported .
we provide relevant data on intake complementary to existing data on plasma biomarkers , further adding to the evidence that they are protective .
however , due to methodological heterogeneity across different studies , further design of multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials aimed at testing the beneficial effects of marine - derived n - 3 pufa supplementation on mortality of rtr are still lacking .

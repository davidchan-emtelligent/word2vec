background ca2 + - dependent activator protein 2 ( caps2 / cadps2 ) is a secretory vesicle - associated protein involved in the release of neurotrophin .
we recently reported that an aberrant , alternatively spliced caps2 mrna that lacks exon 3 ( caps2deltaexon3 ) is detected in some patients with autism .
splicing variations in mouse caps2 and their expression and functions remain unclear .
results in this study , we defined 31 exons in the mouse caps2 gene and identified six alternative splicing variants , caps2a - f .
caps2a is an isoform lacking exons 22 and 25 , which encode part of the munc13 - 1 - homologous domain ( mhd ) .
caps2b lacks exon 25 .
caps2c lacks exons 11 and 22 .
caps2d , 2e , and 2f have c - terminal deletions from exon 14 , exon 12 , and exon 5 , respectively .
on the other hand , a mouse counterpart of caps2deltaexon3 was not detected in the mouse tissues tested .
caps2b was expressed exclusively in the brain , and the other isoforms were highly expressed in the brain , but also in some non - neural tissues .
in the brain , all isoforms showed predominant expression patterns in the cerebellum .
in the developing cerebellum , caps2b showed an up - regulated expression pattern , whereas the other isoforms exhibited transiently peaked expression patterns .
caps2 proteins were mostly recovered in soluble fractions , but some were present in membrane fractions , except for caps2c and 2f , both of which lack the ph domain , suggesting that the ph domain is important for membrane association .
in contrast to caps2a and 2b , caps2c showed slightly decreased bdnf - releasing activity , which is likely due to the c - terminal truncation of the ph domain in caps2c .
conclusion this study indicates that , in mouse , there are six splicing variants of caps2 ( caps2a - f ) , and that these are subdivided into two groups : a long form containing the c - terminal mhd and a short form lacking the c - terminal mhd .
these results demonstrate that the splicing variations correlate with their expression patterns and intracellular distribution , and affect bdnf release ; however , whether or not the short forms possess activities other than bdnf release , for example as natural dominant - negative isoforms , remains to be determined .
background the ca2 + - dependent activator protein for secretion ( caps / cadps ) family consists of two members , caps1 / cadps1 [ 1 - 3 ] and caps2 / cadps2 [ 4 - 6 ] .
caps1 was shown to play a role in the atp - dependent priming step of ca2 + - triggered dense - core vesicle ( dcv ) exocytosis by binding to both phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 - bisphosphate and dcvs in response to ca2 + increase [ 7,8 ] ; it also interacts with the dopamine receptor [ 9 ] .
a study of caps1 - deficient mice suggested that caps1 is involved in catecholamine loading of dcvs in embryonic chromaffin cells [ 10 ] .
on the other hand , caps2 is associated with secretory vesicles containing the neurotrophins bdnf and nt - 3 in the parallel fiber terminals of cerebellar granule cells , and is involved in the release of bdnf and nt - 3 [ 6 ] .
caps2 is widely localized across various brain regions , and shows overlapping distribution patterns with bdnf in many areas [ 11 ] .
our recent studies of caps2 - deficient mice indicated that caps2 plays pivotal roles in bdnf release , cellular phenotypes ( e.g. , neuronal survival and differentiation , synapse structure and function ) , and behavioral phenotypes ( e.g. , water - maze spatial learning , anxiety , circadian rhythm , maternal behavior ) [ 12,13 ] .
the expression of an aberrant splicing variant of caps2 in some patients with autism has also been reported [ 12 ] .
the autistic isoform , caps2deltaexon3 , is missing exon 3 , which encodes the dynactin 1 - interacting domain ( did ) [ 12 ] .
exogenously expressed caps2deltaexon3 failed to localize to axons but accumulated in somato - dendritic areas in cultured cerebellar and cortical neurons , suggesting a possible disturbance of local caps2 - mediated neurotrophin release [ 12 ] .
in this study , we further explore splicing variations in caps2 and identified five additional splice isoforms .
we characterized the expression patterns and neurotrophin release properties of these isoforms .
results and discussion using cdna probes comprising the sequence of both exons 4 and 5 of caps2 , we screened a p6 mouse cerebellar cdna library for splicing variants of caps2 .
in addition to the original clone designated caps2a [ ddbj : ab098623 ] , which was identical to the one that we previously reported [ 6,14 ] , we isolated five additional variants , probably derived from full - length transcripts , designated caps2b [ ddbj : ab291947 ] , 2c [ ddbj : ab291948 ] , 2d [ ddbj : ab291949 ] , 2e [ ddbj : ab291950 ] , and 2f [ ddbj : ab291946 ] .
sequence analyses against genome databases showed that these sequences could be produced by the different usage of the 31 exons of the caps2 gene ( figure 1 ) .
all splicing acceptor and donor sequences of these clones were consistent with the ag / gt rule .
the full - length caps2 protein consists of the following functional domains , as shown in figure 2 : a dynactin 1 - interacting domain ( did ) , a c2 domain , a pleckstrin homology ( ph ) domain and a munc13 - 1 - homologous domain ( mhd ) .
caps2b lacks only exon 25 , which encodes a part of the mhd .
caps2a lacks two exons , 22 and 25 , which encode part of the mhd sequence .
caps2c lacks two exons , exon 11 encoding a c - terminal part of the ph domain , and exon 22 .
in contrast to these three long isoforms ( caps2a - c ) , caps2d , 2e and 2f have large c - terminal large truncations from exon 14 , 12 , and 5 , respectively ; thus , these isoforms have neither the mhd nor the c - tail domain , which mediates the association of caps with dcvs [ 7 ] .
these three short isoforms ( caps2d - f ) have an additional unique exon at their 3 ' end .
the shortest isoform , caps2f , has only the first four authentic exons and none of the functional domains identified so far .
all isoforms ( caps2a - f ) have exon 3 , which contains the domain interacting with p150glued [ 12 ] .
the mouse caps2 exon 3 coding sequence is identical to the human caps2 exon 3 coding sequence , which is absent in some autistic patients .
as shown in figure 3a , no exon 3 skipping was observed during the development of the cerebellum , from e18 to p56 , provided there were sufficient pcr cycles .
moreover , no exon 3 skipping was observed in whole brain , thymus , lung , heart , liver , spleen , kidney , or testis from p7 or p21 mice ( figure 3a ) .
these results suggest that exon 3 skipping does not normally occur in mouse caps2 .
we examined the patterns of caps2 splicing during cerebellar development , by rt - pcr using specific primer sets for each isoform .
caps2b is the only isoform that contains exon 22 .
therefore , rt - pcr with a primer pair spanning exon 21 - exon 23 resulted in a longer band ( 267 bp ) for caps2b in addition to a shorter band ( 147 bp ) for caps2a and 2c .
interestingly , there was a peak in the expression of caps2a and / or 2c at p7 , whereas caps2b was up - regulated throughout development ( figure 3b ) .
the expression of caps2d reached a peak at p7 and decreased thereafter , whereas that of both caps2e and 2f reached a peak between p12 and p21 .
among the eight mouse tissues tested , the brain , lung , kidney , and testis showed expression of all isoforms except for caps2b ( figure 3c ) .
interestingly , expression of caps2b was detectable only in the brain .
among these isoforms , the expression level of caps2f was the lowest as shown by its requiring the highest cycle number of pcr cycles to detect it ( numerals within the parenthesis of figure 3b , c ) .
we next examined the cellular distribution of caps2 isoform mrnas in p7 and p21 mouse brains by in situ hybridization analyses .
exon 11 , which contains a part of the ph - domain coding sequence , is skipped in caps2c , but is included in caps2a , 2b , 2d , and 2e ( figure 2 ) .
the probe for exon 11 showed expression in the hippocampal formation , neocortex , midbrain , and cerebellar granule cells ( figures 4a and 4b ) .
exon 22 , which contains a part of the mhd coding sequence , is skipped in caps2a and 2c , but is included in caps2b ( figure 2 ) .
the probe for exon 22 showed an expression pattern with the most prominent level in cerebellar granule cells ( figures 4c and 4d ) .
expression of caps2d , 2e and 2f was also observed mainly in cerebellar granule cells ( figures 4e - j ) .
moreover , there was no apparent difference in the expression patterns of these isoforms in the p7 cerebellar cortex ( granule cells in the external and internal granule layers and migrating granule cells in the molecular layer ) , as shown in figure 4k .
caps family proteins are essentially soluble proteins , but a fraction of them is capable of being associated with membrane [ 2,5 ] .
therefore , we next examined the subcellular fractionation patterns of these splicing variant proteins , exogenously expressed in pc12 cells .
all isoforms were stably expressed in transfected pc12 cells ( figure 5a ) .
caps2 isoforms containing an intact ph domain ( caps2a , 2b , 2d , and 2e ) were recovered from the membrane fraction , although a major portion of each isoform was included in the soluble fraction .
on the other hand , caps2 isoforms lacking a part of the ph domain ( caps2c ) or the entire ph domain ( caps2f ) were not detectable in the membrane fraction , suggesting that the ph domain has a role in the membrane association of caps2 protein , as previously shown [ 7 ] .
we next examined the expression of the endogenous proteins produced from these splice isoform mrnas in the mouse brain .
immunoreactive bands corresponding to short isoforms ( caps2d - f ) were observed at low to undetectable protein levels in the mouse cerebellum ( figure 5b ) .
in addition , the previous report showed that in non - neural tissue such as pituitary , lung , pancreas and kidney , only a 150 kda band immunoreactive for caps2 was detected [ 15 ] .
at the mrna level , more reaction cycles and time were needed for the amplification of transcripts encoding the short isoforms by rt - pcr and for the colorimetric detection of transcripts by in situ hybridization , respectively , indicating that the expression levels of the genes encoding the short isoforms are very low .
these results indicate that the function of caps2 in vivo is apparently due to the long isoforms ( caps2a - c ) rather than the short isoforms ( caps2d - f ) .
however , the functional role ( s ) of the short isoforms remain to be studied .
to analyze functional differences between splicing variants , we carried out a bdnf secretion assay ( figure 6 ) .
to investigate the effect of these isoforms on bdnf releasing activity , we exogenously expressed the three long isoforms ( caps2a - c ) together with bdnf in pc12 cells .
short isoforms ( caps2d - f ) were not analyzed because of their large c - terminal truncation ( figure 2 ) and very low expression levels in mouse brain ( figure 5b ) .
as shown in figure 6 , the levels of bdnf released into the culture medium in response to high - kcl stimulation were increased approximately two - fold by the expression of caps2a or 2b compared with cells without exogenous caps2 expression .
caps2c - expressing cells showed lower bdnf - releasing activity than caps2a - or 2b - expressing cells ; however , caps2c - expressing cells also showed an increase in bdnf release in response to high - kcl stimulation ( figure 6 ) .
moreover , there was no significant difference in basal bdnf release between caps2c - expressing cells and cells expressing either of the other two isoforms ( caps2a and 2b ) .
there was a partial deletion of the ph domain in caps2c ( figure 2 ) .
the partial ph domain of plc - gamma 1 is known to interact with a complementary partial ph - like domain of another protein and elicit its function [ 16 ] .
therefore , it is possible that caps2c has some bdnf - releasing activity , although its activity is lower than that of intact ph domain - containing isoforms .
interestingly , expression of the exon 22 - containing isoform was up - regulated in the developing mouse cerebellum , whereas exon 22 - skipped isoforms were expressed transiently , peaking at p7 .
moreover , the exon 22 - containing isoform showed higher bdnf - releasing activity than other long isoforms ( figure 3b ) .
on the other hand , as described in our previous report , caps2 immunoreactivities are detected in both the soma and axon of cerebellar granule cells at p7 , but almost exclusively in the axon at p21 [ 6 ] .
these results suggest that the exon 22 splicing patterns are related to high releasing activity and axonal localization in cerebellar granule cells .
caps2 - mediated regulation of neurotrophin actions in terms of their releasing dose and subcellular localization may be important for normal cerebellar development .
the splicing of exon 22 is interesting for reasons other than the developmental differences in expression ; that is , the exon 22 - containing isoform was detectable only in the brain , whereas exon 22 - skipped isoforms were widely expressed in various tissues .
exon 22 encodes part of the mhd , specifically a proline - rich domain ( 8 prolines within 40 residues ) .
proline - rich motifs occurred often in many protein - protein interaction sites , including one recognized by the src homology 3 ( sh3 ) domain .
our preliminary screening of protein candidates that interact with the exon 22 - encoded region , by yeast two - hybrid , isolated five candidates ; however , none of these had an sh3 domain ( data not shown ) .
future analyses of caps2 proline - rich domain - interacting proteins will clarify the significance of the alternative splicing of exon 22 .
conclusion we explored the alternative splicing diversity of caps2 and identified six caps2 isoforms .
the alternative splicing of exon 22 ( presence or absence ) was associated with a difference in tissue distribution and a developmental expression pattern .
our study showed that an intact ph domain is required for the association of caps2 with the membrane and efficient bdnf release activity .
on the other hand , exon 3 - skipping , found in autistic patients , was not observed in the mouse tissues tested .
methods animals all experimental protocols were approved by the riken institutional animal care and use committee .

the position and size ( kda ) of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left .
the deduced molecular weight ( kda ) of each isoform is indicated in parentheses on the right .
figure 6 the functional differences between caps2 splice variants .
pc12 cells were transfected with caps2 constructs together with a bdnf expression vector .
the concentrations of bdnf ( pg / ml ) in culture media of cells with or without 50 mm kcl stimulation were analyzed by elisa .
pc12 cells express caps1 , another caps family protein , and thus showed increased levels of bdnf release in the presence of high k concentrations [ 6 ] .
our recent study also showed that overexpression of caps2 not only promotes activity - dependent , regulated release of bdnf , but also slightly increases the basal , constitutive release of bdnf [ 12 ] .
data points represent the averages of values obtained from four independent experiments .
the error bars indicate the sd .
* p < 0.05 , by student 's t test .
the differences between the bdnf releasing activities of three isoforms ( caps2a , b , and c ) after 50 mm kcl stimulation were shown to be significant by one - way anova analysis ( p < 0.05 ) .

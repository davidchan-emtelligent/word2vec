purpose end - stage knee osteoarthritis ( oa ) results in total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) surgery .
the decision to perform tka is not well defined , resulting in variation of indications among orthopaedic surgeons .
non - operative treatment measures are often not extensively used .
aim of this study was to investigate factors influencing the decision to perform tka by dutch orthopaedic surgeons .
methods three case vignettes , each case divided into two versions , being identical except for information on age ( younger and older age ) , pain ( mild and severe pain ) or radiological oa ( low and high grade ) were developed .
a questionnaire including these three case vignettes was sent to 599 dutch orthopaedic surgeons , who were randomised to either one of the two versions .
the orthopaedic surgeons were asked whether tka would be the next step in treatment .
furthermore , from a list of patient factors they were asked how strong these factors would influence the decision to perform tka .
results 54 % of the orthopaedic surgeons completed the questionnaire ( n = 326 ) .
orthopaedic surgeons indicated to perform tka significantly more often at higher age ( 73.3 vs. 45.5 % , p < 0.001 ) .
in the presence of mild pain , orthopaedic surgeons were slightly more reluctant to perform a tka compared to severe pain ( 57.0 vs. 64.0 % , n.s. ) .
mild radiological oa made surgeons more reluctant to perform tka compared to severe oa ( 9.7 vs. 96.9 % , p < 0.001 ) .
conclusion old age and severe radiological oa are variables which are considered to be important in the decision to perform a tka .
pain symptoms of moderate or severe pain are unequivocal when considering a tka .
level of evidence economic / decision analysis , level iii .

keywords total knee replacement indication age pain osteoarthritis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) european society of sports traumatology , knee surgery , arthroscopy ( esska ) 2016 introduction knee osteoarthritis ( oa ) is a major cause of disability and functional limitations which affects millions of people in our ageing population worldwide [ 2 , 21 ] .
a total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) is generally accepted to be an effective surgical treatment for end - stage knee oa [ 3 , 7 , 27 ] .
until now , no succinct criteria on decision - making on tka are available , other than ' enough pain ' [ 7 ] .
the latter not only results in variation among orthopaedic surgeons in their decision to perform a tka , but also in a potentially large percentage of patients not receiving adequate conservative ( i.e. non - operative ) treatment for knee oa [ 1 , 16 , 20 , 25 ] .
on the other hand , not all patients improve after tka ; a study from the swedish arthroplasty register showed that 17 - 25 % of the patients after primary tka were not satisfied or were uncertain about the functionality of their tka [ 26 ] .
since patient expectations on their tka surgery are not entirely met , well - timed surgery and pre - operative counselling seem to be important variables to be addressed , even more considering the high prevalence of tka surgery , with about 22,000 cases in 2012 in a small country such as the netherlands and 719,000 cases in the usa in 2010 [ 17 , 22 ] .
pain and the degree of radiographic oa are considered important variables in the decision process to perform knee replacement surgery [ 7 , 9 , 16 , 19 ] .
pre - operative pain is a strong predictor of postoperative outcome ; patients with severe pre - operative pain complaints had worse postoperative outcomes compared to those with less severe pain complaints [ 5 , 10 ] .
on the contrary , patients with mild radiological oa showed little improvement in clinical symptoms compared to patients with severe radiological oa [ 13 ] .
most orthopaedic surgeons consider a tka in case of moderate to severe radiological oa , but there is a well - known weak association between pain symptoms / functional impairment and radiological oa [ 19 , 28 ] .
as for total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) , ranking determinants for their importance in the decision to perform surgery showed that radiological changes were of less importance than pain at rest and at night and / or pain during activities , functional impairment or a decreased range of motion ( rom ) [ 4 ] .
this emphasises the need to explore the variables being involved in the decision - making process to perform tka .
the aim of this study was to evaluate how these factors influence the opinion of dutch orthopaedic surgeons in the decision to recommend tka surgery in a given patient .
we have used case vignettes to mimic clinical practice ; this has never been done before .
we hypothesised that dutch orthopaedic surgeons would recommend tka to patient with high - grade radiological oa , high levels of pain and older age .
materials and methods in april 2012 , all 599 actively practicing orthopaedic surgeons in the netherlands who were member of the dutch orthopaedic association ( nov ) were contacted by e - mail from the nov to participate .
after 2 and 4 weeks , a reminder was sent by e - mail to those who did not respond .
all orthopaedic surgeons were randomised into two groups , both groups filled out a different version of a case vignette ( version a or b , see below ) .
randomisation lists were generated randomly by a computer .
questionnaire the web - based survey used in this study was partially based on questionnaires previously used in surveys among orthopaedic surgeons studying different outcomes [ 4 , 18 , 19 ] .
in addition , one part of the questionnaire was adapted from a study on geriatric oncology patients [ 6 ] .
this study used case vignettes with different versions to explore the influence of older age on oncologists' cancer management [ 6 ] .
the tka indication questionnaire was designed and critically appraised by two experienced knee specialists ( rn and el ) .
before the final versions were distributed to the dutch orthopaedic surgeons , a pilot test was performed among a test panel of twelve orthopaedic surgeons and residents for final feedback .
the software used to distribute the questionnaire was netq ( netquestionnaires nederland bv , amsterdam , the netherlands ) .
the questionnaire was divided into three parts : part one consisted of general information of the respondent ( gender , employment location ( university medical centre , general hospital ( private group or fixed salary ) or specialised private clinic ) , number of knee replacements performed each year (< 50 , 50 - 100 or > 100 ) and years of experience ) .
part two consisted of either version a or b of three case vignettes ( appendix a of esm ) .
the case vignettes of version a and b were entirely identical except for information on ( 1 ) age ( old vs. young age ) , ( 2 ) severity of pain ( mild vs. severe ) and ( 3 ) radiological oa ( mild vs. severe radiological destruction ) .
case 1 version a described a 54 - year - old patient versus version b an 86 - year - old patient .
case 2 version a described a patient with mild pain symptoms and version b a patient with severe pain symptoms .
case 3 version a showed a radiograph with mild radiological oa and version b showed a radiograph with severe radiological oa. a radiograph of the knee was present in all three case vignettes .
the diagnosis in all cases was primary oa with no other abnormalities in other joints of the lower extremities .
orthopaedic surgeons were asked for each case : is a total tka the next step in your treatment ?
' yes or no ' .
a short explanation in writing of the chosen answer was mandatory .
part three of the questionnaire contained factors which might affect the decision to perform tka surgery .
these fourteen decision - modifying factors were extracted from the current orthopaedic literature including ; high co - morbidity , severe osteoporosis , obesity , dementia , low quality of life due to knee problems , old age , young age , ineffective conservative treatment , limited walking distance , dependent on activities of daily living ( adl ) due to knee problems , moderate motivation of the patient , severe pain , severe radiological oa and mild radiological changes [ 4 , 19 ] .
for this part of the questionnaire , the respondents were instructed to select an answer on a five - point likert scale : strongly against surgery , against surgery , neutral , in favour of surgery and strongly in favour of surgery .
the factors explored in the case vignettes of part two were also included in this part to evaluate their importance in relation to other modifying factors .
during the questionnaire , it was not possible to return to the previous question .
since no study patients were involved , official approval of an ethics board was not necessary .
statistical analysis for analysis of the case vignettes , a chi - squared test was used .
the decision - modifying factors of part three of the questionnaire were presented in a 5 - point likert scale .
these factors were ranked in hierarchical order of most likely influencing the decision to perform tka to most unlikely to perform tka .
' strongly in favour of surgery ' and in favour of surgery together as well as ' strongly against surgery ' and ' against surgery ' were combined .
we performed no sample size calculation since our sample size consisted of a fixed cohort ( i.e. all actively practicing orthopaedic surgeons member of the nov ) .
all analyses were performed using spss for windows , version 20 .
tests were two - tailed , and p values < 0.05 were considered to be significant .
results characteristics of the respondents of the 599 questionnaires , a total of 354 ( 59 %) orthopaedic surgeons responded after three mailings ( fig. 1 ). of the 354 responders , 8 indicated not to participate in the questionnaire due to lack of experience in performing a tka and 20 did not complete the whole questionnaire .
therefore , 326 ( 54 %) were included in the analysis .
groups a ( n = 165 ) and b ( n = 161 ) had comparable general characteristics ( table 1 ). fig. 1 flow chart participating orthopaedic surgeons table 1 general characteristics of the respondents , stratified by group ( n = 326 ) characteristics group total ( n = 326 ) a ( n = 165 ) b ( n = 161 ) gender male (%) 152 ( 92 ) 150 ( 93 ) 302 ( 93 ) working environment (%) university medical centre 17 ( 10 ) 18 ( 11 ) 35 ( 11 ) private practice in general hospital 122 ( 74 ) 114 ( 71 ) 236 ( 72 ) general hospital ( fixed salary ) 17 ( 10 ) 19 ( 12 ) 36 ( 11 ) specialised knee clinic 9 ( 6 ) 10 ( 6 ) 19 ( 6 ) number of knee arthroplasties each year (%) < 50 50 ( 30 ) 59 ( 37 ) 109 ( 34 ) 50 - 100 91 ( 55 ) 86 ( 53 ) 177 ( 54 ) > 100 24 ( 15 ) 16 ( 10 ) 40 ( 12 ) years of experience ( median ; iqr ) 10 ( 5 - 19 ) 11 ( 4 - 20 ) 10 ( 5 - 10 ) values are displayed in frequency ( n ) and percentage (%) if not otherwise indicated iqr interquartile range case vignettes case 1 , with difference in chronological age , showed that orthopaedic surgeons were willing to perform a tka more often at higher chronological age ( 73 vs. 46 % , p < 0.0001 ) .
case 2 , with difference in severity of pain symptoms , showed no difference in the decision to perform a tka between the cases with mild and severe pain ( 57 vs. 64 % , n.s. ) .
case 3 , with difference in radiological knee oa , showed that orthopaedic surgeons were less likely to perform surgery in a patient with mild compared to severe radiological oa ( 9.7 vs. 96.9 % , p < 0.0001 ) ( table 2 ) .

the factors , activities of daily life ( adl ) dependency , low quality of life , presence of severe pain , limited walking distance , ineffective conservative treatment and severe radiological oa were positively associated with the decision of orthopaedic surgeons to perform a tka .
on the other hand , mild radiological oa , moderate motivation of the patient , high co - morbidity , dementia and young age urged the orthopaedic surgeons less likely to perform a tka .
presence of obesity was negatively associated with the decision of the orthopaedic surgeons to perform a tka , although one - third of the respondents had a neutral opinion about obese patients considering a tka .
old age and severe osteoporosis were of no clear influence in the decision to perform a tka. fig. 2 modifying factors affecting the decision to perform tka ( n = 326 ) discussion the most important finding of the present study was older age , and moderate to severe radiological oa was important variable in the decision - making process for tka by dutch orthopaedic surgeons , while the level of pain was not strongly associated with the indication to perform a tka .
however , latter is generally considered an important factor to perform tka .
furthermore , we found that the factors depending on adl , low quality of life , severe pain , limited walking distance , ineffective conservative treatment and severe radiological oa were associated with the decision of orthopaedic surgeons to perform a tka .
age respondents did not consider old age as a contraindication to perform a tka , but high co - morbidity negatively influenced the decision to perform tka .
therefore , we assume that relatively good health status is essential for the decision to perform a tka in aged patients , which is line with the literature [ 18 ] .
the majority of orthopaedic surgeons delayed recommendation of a tka in the younger age groups (< 55 year ) , probably due to a higher revision rate within this group and the unpredictable outcome after revision tka [ 11 , 14 ] .
more than 50 % of the respondents recommended other treatment options for this age group like high tibial osteotomy or unicompartmental knee prostheses , which were suggested most frequently [ 8 , 12 , 18 , 30 ] .
pain symptoms the current literature highlights the importance of evaluating the pain level experienced by patients in the pre - operative period since less severe pain experienced by patients ( i.e. non - catastrophising pain ) predicts better postoperative outcome [ 5 , 9 , 10 ] .
differences in pain symptoms ( pain at rest , pain at night and pain at activity ) did not affect the decision to recommend a tka in the case vignettes .
based on these results , we can conclude that oa patients presenting with knee pain in the netherlands are being treated similarly , independent of pain characteristics .
however , severe pain is identified by 95 % of the orthopaedic surgeons as a very important variable in the decision to perform a tka ( part three of our study ) .
the oa research society international and outcome measures in rheumatology ( oarsi - omeract ) working group has shown that pain and function are weakly predictive in the surgeon 's recommendation for tka , which underlines our results [ 7 ] .
both results are conflicting with the importance of level of knee pain and function pre - operative which strongly affect the postoperative outcome of the patient ( less severe knee oa obtain better outcome ) [ 5 , 9 , 10 ] .
radiological oa our study showed that the degree of radiological knee oa is an important variable which influences the orthopaedic surgeons' decision to perform tka , as was found by others as well [ 18 ] .
although ample evidence exists on the discrepancy between the presence of radiological oa and clinical symptoms , most orthopaedic surgeons consider a tka surgery in the presence of moderate to severe radiological oa [ 19 , 27 , 29 ] .
the prevalence of knee oa is increasing , caused by both increasing life span , but also a growing group of people suffering from overweight and therewith negative metabolic changes on the cartilage as well as mechanical overuse of the knee joint [ 24 ] .
this results in an increase in tka surgery worldwide , with a predicted increase of over 700 % until 2030 in the usa [ 15 ] .
not all patients with a tka are satisfied .
at 1 - to 5 - year follow - up , about one - fifth of patients with a tka are not satisfied with their functional outcome [ 23 , 26 ] .
this stresses the importance of pre - operative prediction models on which patients will benefit from a tka , in order not only to increase quality of life of patients but also to reduce national healthcare costs. with the implementation of patient - reported outcome measures ( proms ) in national registries and the presence of option grids for patients based on prediction models for outcome , the indication for surgery , and thus the variation among orthopaedic surgeons for tka , is likely to decrease .
strengths of this study were the relatively large number of respondents , which gives a good reflection of the opinion of the dutch orthopaedic surgeon .
second , case vignettes with each case developed in two versions were never used before in orthopaedic questionnaires and are an effective method to analyse the current symptoms ( age , pain symptoms and radiological oa ) determining the decision of an orthopaedic surgeon to perform tka. with the use of case vignettes , a clinical setting was mimicked , but this virtual setting might still be different from what orthopaedic surgeons actually do in their own clinical practice .
moreover , case vignettes do not give all clinical information , which could affect the decision - making process .
for that matter , the influence of conjoined factors in the decision - making process like young age and severe radiological oa and severe pain combined could not be determined .
another limitation was that an inability in the questionnaire existed to select ' no or less experiences with tka surgery ' , which allows orthopaedic surgeons to finish the questionnaire without noticing they had no or less experiences in knee surgery .
however , the latter is also a strong feature if it was a barrier for some respondents to start or complete the questionnaire .
finally , our results are limited to a healthcare system comparable to the dutch system where surgeons do not receive fee - for - surgery payments or bonus plans ( i.e. as an addition to fixed salary employment ) .
these latter factors could also be of important influence in the decision to perform tka surgery and were not investigated within this study .
further clinical research is required to clarify the indication criteria of an orthopaedic surgeon for tka surgery , and prediction models of both the symptom state of patients in the presence of a certain functional deficit and radiological osteoarthritis and the education level of the orthopaedic surgeon will be important variables in such a model .
international implementation of the case vignette questionnaire would make cross - cultural differences in indication for tka among surgeons visible and might define option grids among the different patient groups even better .
conclusion older chronological aged patients and severe radiological osteoarthritis are variables resulting in the decision by the orthopaedic surgeon to perform a tka .
symptoms of moderate or severe pain are unequivocal when considering a tka .

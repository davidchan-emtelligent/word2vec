invasive species have been cited as major causes of population extinctions in several animal and plant classes worldwide .
the north american grey squirrel ( sciurus carolinensis ) has a major detrimental effect on native red squirrel ( sciurus vulgaris ) populations across britain and ireland , in part because it can be a reservoir host for the deadly squirrelpox virus ( sqpv ) .
whilst various researchers have investigated the epizootiology of sqpv disease in grey squirrels and have modelled the consequent effects on red squirrel populations , less work has examined morphological and physiological characteristics that might make individual grey squirrels more susceptible to contracting sqpv .
the current study investigated the putative relationships between morphology , parasitism , and sqpv exposure in grey squirrels .
we found geographical , sex , and morphological differences in sqpv seroprevalence .
in particular , larger animals , those with wide zygomatic arch widths ( zaw ) , males with large testes , and individuals with concurrent nematode and / or coccidial infections had an increased seroprevalence of sqpv .
in addition , males with larger spleens , particularly those with narrow zaw , were more likely to be exposed to sqpv .
overall these results show that there is variation in sqpv seroprevalence in grey squirrels and that , consequently , certain individual , or populations of , grey squirrels might be more responsible for transmitting sqpv to native red squirrel populations .
the research was supported by queen 's university belfast and by the northern ireland forest service , which provided the specimens .

introduction there is a strong link between infectious disease and biodiversity because individual success , survival , and , consequently , the viability of entire host populations depend upon interactions with external pathogens [ 1 ] .
the effects of infection are related to a number of factors including pathogen virulence [ 2 ] , the nutritional and reproductive status of the host [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , as well as various biotic and abiotic factors such as ambient temperature and intraspecific competition [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
virulent pathogens may result in the rapid death of their host and initiate subsequent host population decline [ 7 ] , whereas others can persist as low - grade chronic infections that are mediated immunologically [ 8 ] .
the pathology associated with chronic disease may be important , being manifest as reductions in host growth , longevity and / or fecundity [ 1 ] .
in addition , chronically diseased animals can be " carriers " within an ecosystem , potentially transmitting infection to other individuals [ 9 ] .
the arrival of novel pathogens and / or infected hosts / vectors into a geographical area where the resident species were not previously exposed could facilitate disease transmission [ 10 ] .
diseases in resident individuals may then present as acute rather than chronic [ 11 ] .
many impacts of disease on host behaviour and life history are mediated through modifications in host energy expenditure [ 12 ] .
investment in one aspect of somatic function , such as fighting an infection , inevitably means that those resources cannot be invested in others such as reproduction or growth [ 13 ] .
conversely , the success of a host population depends upon an adequate supply of food from the environment such that reductions in food availability can increase the probability of infection [ 1 ] .
for example , sub - lethal effects of a viral pathogen infecting indian meal moths , plodia interpunctella , were more apparent when food was limited [ 4 ] .
as food availability within an environment may fluctuate over time , e.g. seasonally , the prevalence and impacts of infectious disease may also coincide with such fluctuations .
finally , the effects of infection may be exacerbated by the presence of multiple pathogens , such that animals harbouring one pathogen may be more susceptible to , or suffer greater effects from a secondary infection .
this may be a consequence of a diversion of the host 's resources towards the primary infection , thereby allowing the secondary pathogen to evade the immune system [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
for example , myxoma virus correlates with nematode and cestode burden in the european rabbit ( oryctolagus cuniculus ) , which was suggested to occur as a result of the animal 's reduced immune response following the viral infection [ 16 ] .
in addition to the effects of extrinsic factors on disease , intrinsic ( host - specific ) factors may correlate with disease prevalence .
host body size is often positively related to parasitic infection , perhaps because large hosts ingest more , increasing the chances of endoparasitism [ 17 ] .
larger hosts also present a greater surface area which increases the likelihood of ectoparasite attachment [ 18 ] .
alternatively , sex biases in infection can occur which may be related to differences in behaviour and / or reproductive strategies between the sexes [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
intrasexual variation in infection may be related to individual differences in reproductive investment with those investing more in reproduction becoming infected more often [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
males might also have a reduced immune function associated with increased levels of testosterone [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] ; however , infection is not always male - biased [ 20 ] .
morphologically , size of the testes is a useful proxy for high testosterone levels , aggression , and territoriality [ 23 ] - [ 25 ] ; hence this feature may be linked to the risk of infection .
other morphological features of interest include zygomatic arch width ( zaw ) , which is suggested to relate to dominance rank and reproductive investment in both sexes [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
dominant individuals may be more susceptible to infection due to their increased activity [ 28 ] and , in some cases , due to the increased stress levels that they endure [ 29 ] .
finally , spleen size may correlate with infection because of its role in lymphocyte production [ 30 ] .
however , the situation is complex because animals with large spleens may , in fact , be better - equipped to resist pathogens and consequently experience a lower prevalence of infection [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
the north american grey squirrel ( sciurus carolinensis ) is a useful species with which to examine the links between morphology , parasitism , and disease .
grey squirrels play host to various parasites [ 33 ] but are also reservoirs for squirrelpox virus ( sqpv ) , which causes a disease that is normally lethal to the native red squirrel ( sciurus vulgaris ) [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
the aims of the current study were to determine the links between seroprevalence of sqpv in grey squirrels and various aspects of morphology and parasitism .
specifically , we determined whether individuals with higher parasite burdens were more likely to be exposed to sqpv ; whether males in general and , specifically , whether those with larger testes were more likely to be seropositive for sqpv ; and whether there were any links between spleen size , zaw , and sqpv exposure .
materials and methods ethics statement squirrel carcasses were obtained from the northern ireland ( n.i. ) forest service , who granted permission for their use .
animals were culled according to methods outlined in " control of grey squirrels for red squirrel conservation " [ 36 ] .
no individuals were obtained specifically for the purposes of this study .
specimen collection grey squirrel specimens were collected as part of a government forestry culling programme , from various sites across n.i .
( february 2008 - february 2009 inclusive ) .
samples were available during all four seasons ( spring , summer , autumn , and winter ) .
the locations , sample sizes , and years that culling of grey squirrels began were : belvoir ( n = 10 ) ( 2001 ) ; larchfield ( n = 12 ) ( no data ) ; lissan ( n = 11 ) ( 2008 ) ; tollymore ( n = 1 ) ( 1998 ) ; drum manor ( n = 12 ) ( 2000 ) ; portglenone ( n = 15 ) ( 2002 ) ; loughgall ( n = 119 ) ( 1992 ) ; gosford ( n = 43 ) ( 1988 ) ; drumbanagher ( n = 19 ) ( 1993 ) ; and derrynoyd ( n = 51 ) ( 2001 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
specimens were stored at - 20degreesc until processed .

morphometric measurements following ectoparasite removal ( see below ) , each specimen was sexed and weighed (+/ - 1 g ) , and the zaw was measured using vernier callipers (+/ - 1 mm ) .
the body length of each specimen was measured from the base of tail to the tip of the nose (+/ - 1 mm ) .
specimens were then dissected to remove the spleens and testes , which were subsequently weighed (+/ - 0.001 g ; ohaus explorer , ohaus corporation , pine brook , nj , usa ) .
organs were placed in an oven at 60degreesc and dried to constant mass before being weighed again .
a 1 - ml blood sample was taken from each specimen for sqpv exposure analysis ( see below ) .
the stomach and intestines were removed for endoparasite analysis ( see below ) .
determination of parasite burden the head , tail , dorsal and ventral sides of each specimen were combed five times in each direction using a flea comb ( dimensions : length = 9 cm ; width = 5.2 cm ) .
ectoparasites were removed and stored in 70 % ethanol .
ectoparasites were examined at x15 magnification under a kyowa microscope ( model sdz - pl , hashimoto 3 - chrome , sagamihara , kanagawa , japan ) and identified using key morphological features ( e.g. ctenidial combs ) [ 37 ] .
in each squirrel specimen , the stomach was separated from the intestine .
the contents were removed and liquefied in 0.9 % ( m / v ) saline solution .
stomachs and intestines were then examined and washed with saline to ensure no parasites were attached to the walls of either organ .
endoparasite burden was determined by examining the contents of the stomach and intestine of each specimen at x15 magnification under a kyowa microscope ( kyowa sdz - pl , hashimoto 3 - chrome , sagamihara , kanagawa , japan ) .
any parasites found were identified from morphological features ( e.g. the presence and structure of bursa or spicules in males , or measurements from the tail to the vulva in females ) .
the mcmaster technique was used to estimate coccidian parasite burden as described previously ( see [ 33 ]) .
coccidia were quantified as follows : 0 resulted in a negative recording ( - ) ; one to three oocysts per field was recorded as (+) ; between three and four , (++) ; between five and fifteen , (+++) , and over fifteen as (++++) [ 33 ] .
determination of sqpv exposure the presence of antibodies against sqpv was determined from blood samples for all specimens using an elisa [ 35 ] .
the presence of antibodies was used as a measure of sqpv exposure as it is difficult to replicate the virus in high titres .
this provides a measure of viral exposure at the time of culling .
an optical density reading of > 0.2 at 492 nm was taken as the cut - off to differentiate specific antibody positive serum samples from negative serum samples .
statistical analyses data analyses were carried out in " r " version 2.15.2 [ 38 ] .
data distributions for all variables were significantly different from normal ( kolmogorov - smirnov test , p < 0.001 ) .
season , sex , and location differences in sqpv seroprevalence were compared using fisher 's exact tests .
variation in sqpv exposure was examined according to the length of time that grey squirrel colonies were established in each location to determine whether seropositivity within a location changed with time [ 39 ] .
the date that culling was first carried out by n.i. forest service was used as a proxy for the establishment of grey squirrels in a given area .
generalized linear models with a binomial distribution and log link function were used to assess the potential relationships between sqpv seroprevalence , parasite load , and morphological features .
minimal models were selected based on comparisons of akaike information criteria ( aic ) [ 40 ] .
first , any collinearity between morphological features was examined using spearman 's rank correlations to determine if any organ masses could be omitted from models .
no collinearity was observed ( p > 0.05 in all cases ) so the associations between each morphological feature ( body mass , zaw , mass of the testes , and spleen mass ) and sqpv exposure were examined by entering each feature singly as an explanatory variable in individual models with sqpv exposure as a response variable .
in the event of a variable holding an explanatory power of p < 0.1 , that variable was then entered into a single model comprising the main effects and two - way interactions between morphological features ( except mass of the testes ) on sqpv exposure ( model a , table 1 ) .
this model was then expanded to include the main effects and two - way interactions between morphological features and various forms of parasitism ( nematode , coccidia , and ectoparasites ) on sqpv exposure in a single model ( model b , table 1 ) .
the final models examined the combined effects of morphology , parasitism , and sex on exposure to sqpv , these were : the main effects and two - way interactions between morphology and sex on sqpv exposure ( model c1 , table 1 ) and the main effects and two - way interactions between parasitism and sex on sqpv exposure ( model c2 , table 1 ) .

all models used a binomial distribution and log link function .
abbreviations are denoted as follows : bm = body mass , spl = spleen mass , tes = mass of testes , zaw = zygomatic arch width , sea = season , cox = coccidial burden , nem = nematode burden , ect = ectoparasite burden , sex = sex , "*" = interaction , ns = no significance ( p > 0.05 for all effects in minimal model ) .
the inclusion of mass of the testes as an explanatory variable excluded females from the analysis .
therefore , further models examined male specimens only .
initial analysis revealed that there was a significant seasonal variation in mass of the testes ( kruskal - wallis : chi2 = 9.13 , df = 3 , p = 0.028 ) .
hence the main effects of season , mass of the testes , and body mass , and the interactions between season and mass of the testes , as well as mass of the testes and body mass on sqpv exposure were included in a combined model .
in this case , none of the terms showed a significant explanatory power ( p > 0.05 ) .
therefore , the factor " season " was omitted from further models .
the first model featuring data for just males included the main effects and two - way interactions of all morphological features ( body mass , zaw , mass of the testes , and spleen mass ) on sqpv exposure ( model d , table 1 ) .
thereafter , additional models examined the interactions between morphology and the various types of parasitism ( coccidia , nematodes , and ectoparasites ) ( models e - g , table 1 ) .
results of the 236 grey squirrel specimens examined , 113 were female and 123 were male. of these , 33.6 % of females and 32.5 % of males tested positive for the presence antibodies against sqpv .
there was no significant difference between the proportion of males and females exposed to sqpv ( chi2 = 0.002 , df = 1 , p = 0.96 ) .
the seroprevalence of sqpv varied with location ( fisher 's exact test : p = 0.007 ) ( fig. 1a + b ) .
at one site , 63.2 % of the individuals tested positive for sqpv antibodies , whereas all other sites had seroprevalences <= 50 % and three populations showed no evidence of exposure .
there was no significant relationship between the percentage of seropositive individuals and the time since first culling in that location ( least squares regression , f1,7 = 2.10 , r2 = 0.231 , p = 0.191 ) .
however , there was a significant difference between seroprevalence in winter ( 40.3 % of individuals seropositive ) compared to summer ( 21.7 % of individuals seropositive ) ( chi2 = 4.12 , df = 1 , p = 0.042 ) .
specimens were infected with a variety of ecto - and endo - parasites ( table 2 ) .
ectoparasites found included the flea , orchopaeus howardii , the louse , neohaematophinus sciurinus , the tick , ixodes ricinus , and the mite , androlaelaps fahrenholzi .
the overall prevalence of ectoparasites was 70.3 % .
endoparasite species identified included coccidia ( eimeria sp. ) oocysts and nematodes , trypanoxyuris ( rodentoxyuris ) sciuri , trichostrongylus retortaeformis , and trichuris sp. the prevalence of coccidial parasites and nematodes was 70.3 % and 53.7 % respectively .

when the main effects and two - way interactions between morphological features ( body mass , zaw , and spleen mass ) were considered in a single model , only body mass had a significant association with sqpv exposure , with larger individuals experiencing exposure more often than smaller individuals ( model a , table 1 ) .
there were no significant interactions between any features in the minimal model .
zaw and spleen mass were not significantly related to sqpv exposure either ( p > 0.05 ) .
similarly , when parasitism , morphology , and their interactions were considered , there were no significant relationships with sqpv exposure ( p > 0.05 in all cases ) ( model b , table 1 ) .
body mass was the only variable which remained significant when the combined effects of morphology and sex on sqpv exposure were considered ( model c1 , table 1 ) .
finally , no significant results were noted when parasitism and sex were examined in a model ( model c2 , table 1 ) .
effects of morphology and parasitism on sqpv exposure in males there were no significant relationships between body mass or zaw and sqpv exposure ( model d ) .
however , specimens with larger testes and those with larger spleens were more likely to have been exposed ( table 1 ) .
examination of the associations between morphology and coccidial burden on sqpv exposure yielded significant interactions between parasite load and various morphological characteristics on the seropositivity of sqpv ( model e , table 1 ) .
large males with high coccidial burdens were more likely to be exposed to sqpv than smaller individuals with low coccidial burdens .
in addition , large males with large testes were more likely to be exposed to sqpv than small individuals with small testes ( table 1 ) .
when morphology , nematode burden , and their interactions with sqpv exposure were considered ( model f , table 1 ) , a significant interaction was noted between spleen mass and zaw on sqpv exposure ; individuals with wide zaw and small spleens were more likely to be sqpv seropositive than individuals with wide zaw and large spleens ( fig. 2 ) .
in addition , small males with a narrow zaw were more likely to be exposed to sqpv than larger males with wide zaw .
there was a significant interaction between zaw and nematode burden ; males with a wide zaw and high nematode burdens were more likely to be exposed to sqpv than those with wide zaw and low nematode burdens .
finally , when ectoparasites were considered , the interaction between spleen mass and zaw noted previously was conserved ( model g , table 1 ) .

discussion invasive species have been cited as major causes of population extinctions in several animal and plant classes worldwide [ 41 ] .
the north american grey squirrel has a major detrimental effect on native red squirrel populations in britain and ireland , in part because they are reservoir hosts for sqpv , which is deadly to red squirrels .
although some researchers have investigated the epizootiology of sqpv disease [ 42 ] - [ 44 ] , less work has examined the various morphological , physiological , and environmental characteristics that might make individual grey squirrels more susceptible to , and potentially better able to transmit the virus to red squirrels [ 33 ] , [ 45 ] .
the current study investigated the putative relationships between morphology , parasite infection , and sqpv seroprevalence in grey squirrels , and documented any geographical and seasonal variation that was found in these characteristics .
we found that larger individuals and males with larger testes were more likely to have been exposed to sqpv .
this is consistent with predictions that larger , dominant individuals may experience increased exposure to infection , possibly by moving further distances and spending more time performing activities such as foraging which might expose them to pathogens [ 46 ] .
when the additional effects of endo - and ecto - parasitism were considered , a high coccidial burden was found to be associated with increased sqpv exposure in larger individuals .
it is unclear why this might be the case but coccidial infection is often present as a more serious , acute infection in young or juvenile animals , and more chronic in adults [ 47 ] .
thus , adults may appear to have an increased coccidial prevalence and perhaps this is then associated with an increased likelihood of sqpv seroprevalence .
there were sex differences in the relationships between morphology and parasitism , with many significant effects on sqpv exposure evident in males but not in the pooled data of males and females .
for example , males with a wide zaw and high nematode burdens were more likely to be sqpv seropositive , which suggests that older dominant males may be more likely to be exposed to sqpv .
the fact that apparent correlates of dominance and reproductive activity are related to parasitism and exposure to sqpv suggests that there are costs to these traits , i.e. some individuals , often males , may increase infection risk in favour of reproductive success [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
male squirrels are also known to be more aggressive , have large home ranges , fight amongst each other , and chase females during oestrus [ 49 ] , [ 47 ] .
these behaviours might increase exposure to sqpv .
the fact that some forms of parasitism co - occur with sqpv exposure supports the contention that one pathogen may be exploiting the diversion of the host 's immune response to the other [ 14 ] , or that immunomodulation , either by the parasites or sqpv , can increase susceptibility to the other .
spleen mass was an important indicator of sqpv exposure in males as those with larger spleens were more likely to have been exposed .
when dominance was also considered , it was noted that males with a wide zaw ( potentially dominant individuals ) with small spleens and males with a narrow zaw ( potentially subordinate individuals ) with large spleens were more likely to have been exposed to sqpv ( fig. 2 ) .
it is unclear whether sqpv influences spleen size or vice versa but it would seem that there is a trade - off between being dominant and investing in immunity and that there is at least two modes of infection ; one in which older , dominant individuals are exposed and another in which younger , subordinate animals are exposed .
a potential explanation could be that individuals with small spleens are less well - equipped to deal with sqpv infection , especially if they have an increased risk of exposure to sqpv because they are reproductively active ( as evidenced by wide zaw and larger testes ) , or if they have elevated testosterone levels which may compromise immune system functionality ( as indicated by larger testes ) [ 21 ] .
it is also possible that the relationship between mass of the testes and sqpv is a result of sqpv causing testicular swelling , which is characteristic of infection with other viruses such as mumps virus [ 50 ] .
concurrent with previous studies , the seroprevalence of sqpv varied according to location , with some areas apparently clear of the infection and other areas comprising large numbers of exposed animals [ 39 ] .
while there was a possibility for the more established colonies from different areas to have greater percentage seroprevalence , this was not apparent .
geographical variation in sqpv seroprevalence might be a result of environmental features such as the distribution of suitable habitats [ 51 ] as well as the presence of other organisms which could act as reservoir hosts or vectors for sqpv , however , at present no other hosts have been identified [ 39 ] .
although there was no overall seasonal effect on sqpv seroprevalence , there was a significant difference between winter and summer exposure , with almost twice as many individuals testing seropositive during the winter .
as winter is the main breeding season [ 52 ] , reproductive males may become exposed to sqpv when they patrol areas in search of receptive females [ 46 ] .
alternatively , increased sqpv seroprevalence during the winter may be a consequence of close social contact between individuals when communal nesting increases [ 53 ] , or when individuals cluster around food resources [ 54 ] .
conclusions despite various conservation efforts , including culling grey squirrels [ 55 ] , and reintroduction and supplementary feeding of red squirrels [ 54 ] , the number of grey squirrels in the u.k. and ireland continues to rise whilst the number of red squirrels falls .
this study investigated the potential aspects of sqpv seroprevalence , which may contribute to this trend .
while there may be potential biases in data collection ( e.g. young or naive individuals may be trapped more easily ) , the sample size was large enough to obtain representative animals spanning different cohorts within the population .
spatial and temporal variation in sqpv antibodies was evident , with notable increases during the winter .
reasons for this remain unclear but it may well be a result of individuals being in closer contact with each other either as a result of mating behaviours , feeding and / or nesting. of note is that larger males with larger testes and those with concurrent nematode or coccidial infections were more likely to be exposed to sqpv .
in addition , subordinate males with large spleens were also more likely to be exposed ( fig. 2 ) .
hence , sqpv transmission may occur when animals are large and dominant , and potentially already under stress from other infections and also when they are young and small .
finally , individuals with larger spleens were more likely to experience sqpv exposure , suggesting that spleen size may increase as a response to infection .
it is hoped that natural immunity may develop in red squirrel populations , as has occurred in european rabbits presenting resistance to the myxoma virus [ 16 ] .
it may therefore be prudent to encourage the expansion of those red squirrel populations which have already been exposed to sqpv and survived , perhaps by supplementary feeding , coupled with the culling programmes which are already in place for grey squirrels , to promote the development of natural immunity within the population .

hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( hlh ) is a life - threatening condition of uncontrolled immune activation leading to extreme inflammation .
primary hlh was once believed to be a disease that occurred only in infancy or young children , and was rarely diagnosed in adults .
it is now understood that patients can develop primary hlh in their adolescence or adulthood .
this study included 252 adolescent and adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of hlh from 35 general medical institutions across mainland china .
all exons and 50 bp of flanking intronic sequence of six hlh - related genes ( prf1 , unc13d , stx11 , stxbp2 , sh2d1a , and birc4 ) were sequenced in these patients .
we identified mutations in 18 / 252 ( 7.1 %) of the patients , with changes in prf1 being most common .
late - onset hlh often features viral infection and other predisposing factors .
we conclude that late - onset primary hlh is not as rare as previously thought .
older patients should not be delayed to receive hlh - related genes testing when they are suspected with hlh .

introduction hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( hlh ) is an immune disorder characterized by the uncontrolled activation of t lymphocytes and macrophages and the excessive generation of inflammatory cytokines .
the disease presents clinically with persistent fever , hepatosplenomegaly , pancytopenia , and hemophagocytic phenomena detected in the bone marrow , liver , spleen , and lymph tissue , with onset typically occurring in the first 2 years of life .
primary hlh ( also called familial hlh ) refers to cases in which there is a positive family history or a defined genetic cause .
an onset of primary hlh after 8 years of age has rarely been reported [ 1 ] .
a hallmark of the disease is decreased nk cell and cytotoxic t lymphocyte ( ctl ) function , which is thought to be caused by genetic defects in the perforin / granzyme - mediated cytotoxic pathway .
uncontrolled immune activation leading to extreme inflammation causes the onset of hlh symptoms [ 2 ] .
untreated hlh disease progresses rapidly and has a high mortality rate .
the hlh - 94 treatment protocol involves the use of corticosteroids , cyclosporine a , and etoposide before hematopoetic stem cell transplant ( hct ) [ 3 ] .
since 1975 when chandra [ 4 ] reported adult patients with clinical features similar to primary hlh brought on by infection , hlh in older children and even adults has generally been called secondary hlh .
it is now understood that patients with a genetic basis for hlh can sometimes remain asymptomatic until adolescence or even adulthood [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] .
recently , zhang et al. reported twenty - five adult patients with hlh possessed genetic mutations in north america and sieni et al. described eleven adult flh in italy [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
various mutations in at least 9 genes have been shown to play roles in primary hlh [ 10 ] - [ 19 ] .
prf1 , unc13d , stx11 , stxbp2 , rab27a , lyst , and ap3b1 are autosomal genes , all involving perforin / granzyme - mediated cytotoxicity .
sh2d1a and birc4 are x - linked genes , coding for an adaptor molecule called signaling lymphocyte activation molecule - associated protein ( sap ) which is involved in signaling pathways that trigger cytotoxic granule release , and more recently , x - linked inhibitor of apoptosis .
more importantly , all cases of hlh , regardless of genetic involvement , require prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment .
the aims of this study were to characterize genetic changes in a large population of adolescents and adults with hlh .
the beijing friendship hospital , capital medical university accepts specimens and referral cases from all over the country and has the largest adult hlh patient database in mainland china .
for this study , we sequenced all coding exons and at least 50 base pairs of the adjacent intronic sequence of the prf1 , unc13d , stx11 , stxbp2 , sh2d1a and birc4 genes in 252 adolescent and adult hlh patients from mainland china .
we also measured nk cell activity to see if it correlated with certain mutations .
methods a total of 252 adolescents and adults ( age >= 13 years ) diagnosed clinically with hlh were ascertained between july 2006 and june 2012 .
the patients were diagnosed according to hlh - 2004 diagnostic criteria [ 20 ] and referred to our institution from 35 general medical institutions across china ( see acknowledgments ) .
clinical data and peripheral blood samples were provided for each patient by their referring physician .
nk cell function was determined by the lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) release assay [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
normal values for adolescents and adults in our lab range from 31.54 % to 41.58 % [ 21 ] .
total genomic dna was isolated from peripheral blood samples of each patient with the magazorb dna kit ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
all coding exons and at least 50 base pairs of the adjacent intronic sequence of the six genes associated with hlh ( prf1 , unc13d , stx11 , stxbp2 , sh2d1a , and birc4 ) were pcr amplified and sequenced .
the patient sequences were compared to those published in genbank ( prf1 , nm _ 005041.4 ; stx11 , nm _ 003764.3 ; sh2d1a , nm _ 002351.3 ; unc13d , nm _ 199242.2 ; birc4 , nm _ 001167.2 ; stxbp2 , nm _ 006949.2 ) .
the ethics committee of beijing friendship hospital approved this study .
written informed consent was given by the patients and their caretakers or guardians for their clinical and genetic information to be stored in the hospital database and used for research .
results this study group included 252 adolescent and adult patients diagnosed with hlh ( 147 males , age range 13 - 81 years ) .
patients were grouped by age of onset .
there were 57 adolescent patients aged 13 to 17 years , and 195 adult patients aged 18 years and older .
the entire coding regions and flanking intronic sequence of six genes ( prf1 , unc13d , stx11 , stxbp2 , sh2d1a , and birc4 ) were pcr amplified and sequenced for each patient .
we identified a gene sequence change in 18 of the 252 patients ( 7.1 %) .
these 18 patients ( 13 males and 5 females , 13 - 56 years ) included 8 adolescents and 10 adults , accounting for 14.0 % and 5.1 % , respectively , of patients the same age group .
twelve of these patients had viral infections , including ebv , cmv , and hhv - 7 .
no patients in this study had a family history of hlh disease .
table 1 lists the clinical and dna findings for the 18 patients with identified genetic changes .
prf1 mutations were the most common .
we found 12 different prf1 gene changes among nine patients in whom a gene change was identified , including a nonsense mutation ( p.q166x ) , a frameshift mutation ( p.p22rfsx29 ) , and 10 missense mutations , all at different sites .
five of the nine prf1 mutation carriers were compound heterozygous for the prf1 mutations .
two missense mutations in the stx11 gene ( p.r49q and p.r49w ) were identified in seven patients .
a single missense mutation in sh2d1a ( p.a3s ) was identified in two patients , and one patient had a unc13d missense mutation .
no changes in stxbp2 or birc4 were found in any of the 252 hlh patients in this study .

normal scd25 value : < 2400 iu / ml. both patients with the sh2d1a p.a3s mutation are noteworthy .
one male patient ( p04 ) also had a prf1 mutation .
because sh2d1a p.a3s is x - linked , this mutation was inherited from his mother , and the prf1 mutation was inherited from his father .
the sh2d1a mutation is x - linked recessive , and the prf1 mutation is autosomal recessive , thus the sh2d1a change is thought to play a dominant role in the pathogenesis in this particular patient .
the other patient with the sh2d1a p.a3s mutation ( p12 ) was a female .
analysis of her parents showed that she inherited her abnormal x from her asymptomatic father. of the 18 patients in whom a mutation was identified , 11 had monoallelic mutation identified .
in all patients , the nk cell activity was lower than normal levels .
the nk cell activity was slightly lower in patients with biallelic mutation ( 11.59 +/ - 5.07 %) than in patients with monoallelic mutation ( 17.72 +/ - 8.21 %) , although the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.097 ) .
soluble cd25 ( scd25 ) levels , a marker of inflammation and disease status , were similar between patients with biallelic mutation ( 6101 +/ - 3461 iu / ml ) and those with monoallelic mutation ( 6777 +/ - 3166 iu / ml ) , ( p = 0.68 ) .
seventeen of the 18 patients presented in this study received hlh - 94 drug treatment .
the patient who refused treatment died soon after diagnosis .
twelve patients achieved clinical remission after the first treatment , while five patients died without remission .
two of 12 remission patient relapsed , one died and the other achieved re - remission .
four of them underwent allogeneic hct after first remission and survived disease free .
at the termination date of the follow up , seven patients died , and eleven patients survived , with a total survival rate of 61 % .
in the biallelic mutation group , two patients died and five survived .
in the monoallelic mutation group , five patients died and six survived .
there was no significant difference in the survival rate between the two groups ( p = 0.53 ) .
figure 1 shows the survival function of the two groups .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0107386.g001 figure 1 comparison of the survival rate in the two groups .
discussion primary hlh was first proposed by farquhar in 1952 , who described high fever , pancytopenia , hepatosplenomegaly , and rapid death in 2 - month - old twins [ 23 ] .
in subsequent reports , almost all patients were infants and young children , and more than half of the patients were twins , suggesting a genetic basis for the disease .
until a perforin gene mutation was found in a case of familial hlh [ 10 ] , the diagnosis of primary hlh required onset in infancy and a positive family history as the support basis .
after several additional genes and mutations were found to be associated with hlh , the histiocyte society developed the diagnostic guidelines hlh - 2004 .
evidence of a genetic defect is one option for diagnosing primary hlh ; however , patients with refractory / reactivated hlh should also be considered as patients with severe disease .
adult hlh patients are typically diagnosed with secondary hlh because the disease seems to be induced by a concomitant condition , such as ebv infection , malignancy , or rheumatologic disorders [ 24 ] .
however , many of the genetic changes found in the pediatric primary hlh cases are also reported in adults [ 8 ] .
here , we report genetic findings from a study of 252 adolescent and adult onset hlh patients from mainland china .
mutations in prf1 occur in 15 % to 50 % of patients with primary hlh [ 25 ] .
similarly , we found a prf1 mutation in 9 of 18 ( 50 %) patients in whom a mutation was identified .
prf1 is located at 10q21 - 22 and has 3 exons , with all coding sequences in exons 2 and 3 .
it has been clearly documented that prf1 mutations cause decreased or absent perforin protein expression on the surface of cytotoxic cells .
this condition prohibits cytotoxic and nk cells from destroying their target cells , which in turn leads to increased cytokine production and macrophage activation , causing the symptoms of hlh [ 26 ] .
cases of primary hlh with prf1 mutations have been reported worldwide .
at least 70 different mutations have been described between the two coding exons of prf1 , with p.w374x being the most common .
geographical and racial distributions of various prf1 mutations have been reported [ 27 ] .
it is possible that the different prf1 mutations influence clinical severity .
the mutation p.a91v , for example , occurs in a functionally unimportant region of the protein and , therefore , may lead to mild symptoms or delayed onset of hlh .
mutations causing slight reductions in perforin expression and nk cell function could be the basis of hlh that is dormant until triggered by external factors such as infection [ 6 ] .
we identified two patients in our study with x - linked sh2d1a gene sequence abnormalities , one of them was a heterozygous female carrier ( p12 , table 1 ) who experienced onset of hlh clinical symptoms at age 18 , associated with t - cell lymphoma .
analysis of her parents revealed that the abnormal x chromosome came from her asymptomatic father .
generally , this mutation is predicted by in - silico analysis ( sift , poliphen ) to be tolerated .
we think that the onset of hlh disease in the carrier female may be due to nonrandom x - inactivation or differences in methylation that allow expression of the abnormal sh2d1a gene .
viral infection , particularly ebv infection , is an important predisposing factor in hlh .
studies have shown that individuals with immune deficiencies such as x - linked lymphoproliferative syndrome ( xlp ) are usually asymptomatic before ebv infection , and there is no clear genotype / phenotype correlation [ 28 ] .
the onset and severity of hlh disease may differ among individuals due to varying exposure to triggering factors .
in the absence of such triggers , the disease gene carrier may have no clinical manifestations , which may explain the phenomenon we observed in the female x - linked sh2d1a mutation carrier and her father .
in the other hand , the hlh in these two patients may also be secondary to ebv infection or lymphoma .
in this study , we observed 12 different prf1 mutations in nine patients , most of whom had viral infection at hlh onset .
their diagnosis of secondary hlh was revised to primary hlh after genetic testing .
the 7 patients with stx11 mutations also had viral infection that seemed to trigger hlh disease onset .
suppression of life - threatening inflammation must be initiated promptly in cases of both primary and secondary hlh .
however , the long - term treatment strategies should focus on the underlying cause of hlh for patients in these two categories .
for secondary hlh patients , control of the triggering disease or infection is critical for preventing recurrence .
for primary hlh patients , who have a genetic mutation causing an immune deficiency , restoration of the lacking immune system components is vital .
therefore we believe that a clear diagnosis of primary or secondary hlh is important for long term therapy .
hlh - related genetic testing can aid in distinguishing hlh types and subsequent treatment. and the functional studies , such as degranulation assays , are of great importance and should be implemented by all laboratories serving as prospective referral [ 29 ] .
in this study of 252 adolescent and adult hlh patients , the overwhelming majority had no identifiable mutation in the six hlh - related genes sequenced .
we identified monoallelic mutation in 11 patients , and biallelic mutation in seven additional patients .
therefore , more than half of patients with identifiable genetic changes carried only one mutation in one of these genes .
it is possible that other types of mutations were not detectable by the methodology used in this study , or that these patients possessed mutations in additional genes that have not yet been discovered to be associated with hlh .
nk cell activity was lower than normal in each patient , and there was no statistically significant difference between monoallelic mutation group and biallelic mutation group .
our results support that defective cytotoxicity might be involved also in a proportion of hlh without biallelic mutations in the fhl related genes .
our data and other similar findings strongly suggest that " milder " mutations in these genes play an important role in the development of late - onset hlh when patients are challenged by viral infection or other environmental stresses .
nowadays , hlh remains a rapidly progressive and life - threatening disease .
adoption of the hlh - 94 treatment protocol increased the 3 - year survival rate of hlh patients from less than 10 % to about 50 % [ 3 ] .
in our study , the initial remission rate was 67 % , and the total survival rate was 61 % .
the clinical results presented here are similar to others .
but there was no significant difference in the survival rate between monoallelic mutation group and biallelic mutation group in our study ( p = 0.536 ) .
however , this conclusion needs to be checked up with large scale clinical study. with the recognition of hlh in adolescent and adult patients , late - onset primary hlh occurs more commonly than was suspected previously .
furthermore , patients with recurrence of hlh , in the absence of autoimmune disease or malignancy , are most likely to be suffering from primary hlh .
older patients should receive hlh - related genetic testing when hlh is suspected , since a proper diagnosis can aid in long term care and prevention of recurrence .

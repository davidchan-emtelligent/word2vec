the effects of ocean acidification alone or in combination with warming on coral metabolism have been extensively investigated , whereas none of these studies consider that most coral reefs near shore are already impacted by other natural anthropogenic inputs such as metal pollution .
it is likely that projected ocean acidification levels will aggravate coral reef health .
we first investigated how ocean acidification interacts with one near shore locally abundant metal on the physiology of two major reef - building corals : stylophora pistillata and acropora muricata .
two ph levels ( pht 8.02 ; pco2 366 muatm and pht 7.75 ; pco2 1140 muatm ) and two cobalt concentrations ( natural , 0.03 mug l - 1 and polluted , 0.2 mug l - 1 ) were tested during five weeks in aquaria .
we found that , for both species , cobalt input decreased significantly their growth rates by 28 % while it stimulated their photosystem ii , with higher values of retrmax ( relative electron transport rate ) .
elevated pco2 levels acted differently on the coral retrmax values and did not affect their growth rates .
no consistent interaction was found between pco2 levels and cobalt concentrations .
we also measured in situ the effect of higher cobalt concentrations ( 1.06 +/ - 0.16 mug l - 1 ) on a. muricata using benthic chamber experiments .
at this elevated concentration , cobalt decreased simultaneously coral growth and photosynthetic rates , indicating that the toxic threshold for this pollutant has been reached for both host cells and zooxanthellae .
our results from both aquaria and in situ experiments , suggest that these coral species are not particularly sensitive to high pco2 conditions but they are to ecologically relevant cobalt concentrations .
our study reveals that some reefs may be yet subjected to deleterious pollution levels , and even if no interaction between pco2 levels and cobalt concentration has been found , it is likely that coral metabolism will be weakened if they are subjected to additional threats such as temperature increase , other heavy metals , and eutrophication .

introduction recent studies have highlighted how coral reefs are extremely delicate systems and how they may easily be altered by human activities ( e.g. [ 1 ]) .
among the main sources of pollution threatening them , metals are conservative in nature , persisting in the environment for long periods [ 2 ] .
major inputs of heavy metals to the marine environment include urban storm water run - off , industrial effluents , mining operations , and atmospheric contaminants in both particulate and dissolved forms [ 3 ] .
furthermore , motor vehicle emissions , disposal of sewage sludge , dredged spoil , ash and antifouling paints for marine vessels and structures also yield appreciable concentrations of heavy metals to the ocean [ 2,4,5 ] .
metal pollution affects many reefs worldwide ( e.g. costa rica , panama , red sea , thailand , tuvalu , puerto rico ) [ 5 - 9 ] .
among them , coral reefs of new caledonia ( pacific ocean ) are particularly concerned by this issue .
new caledonia is among the five major nickel producers in the world and extended portions of its fringing reefs are impacted by extensive nickel mining activities [ 10 ] , which contribute primarily to metal discharges [ 11 - 13 ] .
among these metals , cobalt is associated with nickel in the laterites of the mining sites and the most recent mines in new caledonia , and throughout the world , launch the mining of cobalt , as a by - product of the treatment of nickel .
experimental studies on metal potential effects on corals mainly investigated their reproduction and early life stages .
they can be summarized in the following : inhibition of coral fertilization and reduced reproductive success [ 14 - 16 ] , decreased settlement and survival of coral larvae [ 17 ] ; changes in the rates of photosynthesis resulted in a decrease in coral calcification and growth rates during the juvenile polyp stage [ 18,19 ] ; loss of zooxanthellae in coral tissue ( also called " coral bleaching ") [ 18,20 ] ; enhanced coral mortality [ 20,21 ] .
all these experimental studies , using very high metal levels , highlighted the harmful role played by metals when in excess .
however , it has never pointed out potential benefic effects due to metals like cobalt ( co ) , copper ( cu ) , zinc ( zn ) , manganese ( mn ) and iron ( fe ) at moderate and representative levels .
these metals are indeed essential for the health and growth of corals since they are cofactors of many enzymes [ 22,23 ] .
amongst metals , cobalt might play an important role .
for example , the vitamin b12 , also called cobalamine ( due to its cobalt nucleus ) , is involved in the metabolism of all animals and many phytoplanktonic species [ 24 ] , and stimulates in hospite zooxanthellae growth [ 25 ] .
carbonic anhydrases are ubiquitous enzymes known to act as catalysts for the interconversion between co2 and hco3 - , and it can play an important role when calcification is carbon limited such as under ocean acidification scenarios .
however , so far no study has been performed on the direct effect of a cobalt input on coral metabolism .
in addition to waterborne pollutants , the ultimate danger that corals have to face is climate change ( e.g. [ 26 ]) .
atmospheric co2 levels have nearly doubled since pre - industrial times .
as co2 diffuses in seawater , it behaves like a weak acid leading to a drop in ph on a global scale [ 27 ] .
about a third of anthropogenic co2 emissions has been absorbed by the oceans , driving the process of ocean acidification during which absorbed co2 transforms into carbonic acid , increasing the concentrations of h + , bicarbonate ( hco3 - ) , and dissolved carbon dioxide ( co2 ) , while lowering carbonate ( co3 2 - ) concentrations and seawater ph [ 27,28 ] .
the current consensus estimate is that by the end of this century the rate of calcification in scleractinian corals will decrease by 17 - 37 % as a result of reduced seawater [ co3 2 - ] due to a doubling of preindustrial levels of atmospheric pco2 [ 29,30 ] but coral response to acidification is in fact not unequivocal and still puzzling .
it has been shown that some tropical species are able to calcify under high pco2 levels [ 31 - 34 ] .
comeau et al .
[ 35 ] , testing eight tropical species demonstrated that response of tropical coral reef communities to ocean acidification was heterogeneous .
to date , no work has studied the combined effect of ocean acidification and metal impacts on corals .
houlbreque et al .
[ 33 ] pointed out that zinc uptake rates in stylophora pistillata were higher under normal ph conditions ( pht 8.1 ) compared to lower ones ( pht 7.5 ) , suggesting that ocean acidification might also change the incorporation of metals .
depending on whether metals are essential or not , changes in their uptake rates might have radical consequences on coral metabolism .
here we tested in laboratory conditions the combined effect of ocean acidification and cobalt concentrations on two coral species separately .
we also investigated in situ the effects of higher cobalt concentrations on coral metabolism through benthic chamber experiments .
materials and methods 1 - aquaria experiment coral collection and experimental setup stylophora pistillata and acropora muricata were collected in the lagoon of new caledonia , on the reef of ilot maitre ( 22degrees19.702 ' s ; 166degrees24.626 ' e ) .
a license has issued by the " province sud " to allow this collection .
one hundred twenty terminal portions of branches ( 2 - cm long ) for each coral species were cut from 10 parent colonies .
after collection , s. pistillata microcolonies have been hung on nylon wires and suspended on the aquaria , while a. muricata microcolonies have been glued ( holdfast epoxy ) to 2 x 2 cm plastic plates and set up at the bottom of the aquaria .
all microcolonies were positioned with the apex in front of the artificial light source .
they recovered for one month in the laboratory of the aquarium des lagons ( noumea ) under controlled conditions as described below .
microcolonies were randomly assigned to one of the 8 experimental tanks of 20 l volume ( n = 15 per species per tank ) supplied with 100 mum - filtered seawater pumped from 5 meter depth in front of the aquarium .
in each tank , seawater was renewed at a rate of 16.5 l h - 1 and mixed using a submersible pump ( aquarium system , micro - jet mc 320 , mentor , oh , usa ) .
temperature ( 26 +/ - 0.1degreesc ) and salinity ( 35.70 +/ - 0.02 ) were kept constant using heaters connected to electronic controllers (+/ - 0.2degreesc accuracy ) and routinely verified using an ysi mps 556 probe ( ysi , usa ) .
corals received a constant irradiance of 120 +/ - 10 mumol photons m - 2 s - 1 ( photoperiod was 12h : 12h light : dark ) using four neon aquablue plus ( blue - white , 15000 kelvin , giesemann , germany ) .
they were fed twice a week during the recovery period and once a week during the experiment with nauplii of artemia salina ( ca. 120 +/ - 50 nauplii l - 1 ) .
after the recovery , four tanks were set - up at ambient ph ( pht 8.02 +/ - 0.03 ; pco2 366 muatm ) and four others at ph level projected for the end of the century ( pht 7.75 +/ - 0.06 ; pco2 1140 muatm ) ( ipcc 2007 ) .
ph was controlled using a ph - stat system ( iks , karlsbad , accuracy +/ - 0.05 ph unit ) by bubbling independently pure co2 in each tank that were continuously aerated with co2 - free air .
for each pco2 condition , two tanks received a natural cobalt concentration of the seawater pumped in front of the aquarium ( natural : 0.035 +/ - 0.007 mug l - 1 ) , and two others were enriched in cobalt ( polluted : 0.222 +/ - 0.006 mug l - 1 ) .
for that , a peristaltic pump ( ismatec ) , together with seawater flow - through , continuously supplied the experimental tanks with solution of stable cobalt ( cono3 , cpachem , bulgaria ) at a rate 50 ml h - 1 .
throughout the experiment , cobalt concentrations have been analyzed once a week by the ael laboratory ( analytical environmental laboratory ) of noumea , according to the protocol described in [ 36 ] .
colonies were maintained under these experimental conditions for five weeks , after which their photosynthetic efficiency and growth rates were measured .
seawater carbonate chemistry seawater ph values were continuously monitored by a ph - stat system , which electrodes were calibrated using nbs solutions ( seawater national bureau of standards ) and adjusted every day to the desired pht ( total scale ) using a ph meter with a glass electrode ( eutech instruments ecoscan ) calibrated with tris / hcl referenced solutions ([ 37 ] ; standards provided by a.g. dickson , batch 13 ) .
mean pht were calculated from hydrogen ion concentrations of each measurement and then re - converted back to ph [ 37 ] .
total alkalinity was measured twice a week on water samples collected in glass bottles , filtered at 0.45 mum ( gf / f whatman ) and stored in the dark at 4degreesc to avoid biological alteration .
the ph was measured at 0.1 ml increments of 0.01 n hcl at 25degreesc using a metrohm titration system ( 848 titrino plus ) .
three replicated 20 ml sub - samples were analyzed .
total alkalinity ( at ) was calculated from the gran function applied to ph variations from 4.2 to 3.0 as meq l - 1 from the slope of the curve hcl volume versus ph. titrations of at standards provided by a.g. dickson ( batch 121 ) were within 0.85 mumol kg - 1 of the nominal value .
mean at of seawater was 2.341 +/ - 0.047 mmol kg - 1 ( n = 40 ) .
co2 and saturation states of aragonite ( omegaara ) were calculated from pht , mean at , temperature , and salinity using the free access co2 systat package .
photosynthetic efficiency measurements photosynthetic efficiency ( fv / fm ) and the relative electron transport rate ( retr ) of the photosystem ii ( psii ) of zooxanthellae in hospite were measured using a diving - pam fluorometer ( walz , germany ) ( n = 10 for each species and each tank ) .
during measurements light sources were switched off .
ambient light level at the aquarium room was < 10 mumol photon m - 2 s - 1 and did not substantially affect the coral fv / fm. after 15 min of dark adaptation ( after [ 38 ]) , the first measurements were performed .
the initial fluorescence ( f0 ) was measured by applying a weak pulsed red light ( 3 mus , led 650 nm ) on dark - adapted colonies .
a saturating pulse ( 800 ms ) of bright actinic light ( 8,000 mumol photons m - 2 s - 1 ) was then applied to give the maximum fluorescence value ( fm ) .
variable fluorescence ( fv ) was calculated as fm - f0 .
at the end of all fv / fm measurements , light was switched on and the corals were allowed to recover under light conditions for 1 h after which rapid light curves ( rlc ) were generated by illuminating corals for 10.s periods , eight times from 0 to ca .
3000 mu mol.photon.m - 2.s - 1 , and the coral maximum relative electron transport rate ( retrmax ) was assessed and compared between the different treatments .
during measurements , the 8.mm optical fibre was maintained perpendicular to the coral 's surface using a black - jacket at a fixed distance of 5.mm [ 39 ] .
this system created a quasi - darkness status allowing the rapid re - oxidation of primary electron acceptor [ 40 ] .
the same setting was also used during fv / fm measurements to guarantee correct distance of the optical fiber to the coral .
it is worth noting that to calculate etr using rlcs , some assumptions were made .
first , because we did not measure the different tissue absorptances between species , we used the relative etr ( sensu [ 40 ]) which does not account for the fraction of incident light absorbed [ 41 ] .
retr was therefore uniquely used to compare data from different treatments and not between species .
another source of significant errors when measuring retr is a likely different symbiont density between samples which can lead to a significant change in reflected light and thus in absorptance .
as we measured etr only one time at the end of the experiment and as the zooxanthellae density did not change between treatments ( see table 1 ) , we are confident that our measurements of retr reflect coral response to treatment uniquely .
it should be noted that pre - configured protocols designed for measuring etr by pam fluorometry permit rapid assessment of the light adapted state of corals without allowing sufficient time for steady state conditions to be established , which is required to correctly evaluate the photosynthetic response to light ( i.e. etr vs irradiance curve [ 42 ]) .
however , our approach was to contrast etrs between different treatments and therefore contrast relative differences in the responses observed .
in no way we measured absolute electron transport rates to contrast relative patterns in light utilization of the two studied species .

growth rates microcolonies were weighted ( n = 7 for each species and each tank ) using the buoyant weight technique [ 43 ] .
samples were weighed using a mettler at200 electronic balance ( readability 0.1 mg ) in seawater of known density as measured by an ysi mps 556 probe ( ysi , usa ) .
for a. muricata , for which samples were attached to plastic plates , they were weighed before and after attachment to tagged plastic plates , and the difference ( plate and glue weight ) was subtracted from the total weight .
the net buoyant weight of the corals ( total coral weight minus the weight of each plate ) was converted into dry weight using the density of the pure aragonite ( 2.94 g cm - 3 ) .
their net calcification rates were calculated as the daily change in dry weight between the initial and the final weight and expressed in mg g - 1 d - 1 .
zooxanthellae and chlorophyll content at the end of the incubation microcolonies ( n = 3 per each species and tank ) were collected and frozen ( - 20degreesc ) for zooxanthellae and total chlorophyll ( chl ) measurements .
tissue was removed from coral colonies using an air pick [ 44 ] and the slurry was homogenised with a potter tissue grinder .
for each sample , the number of zooxanthellae was counted five times by light microscopy using a neubauer 's cell .
chlorophylls were extracted twice in 100 % acetone ( 24 h at 4degreesc ) .
the extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min and the absorbances were read at 630 , 663 , 750 nm. chlorophyll concentrations were computed according to the spectrometric equations of [ 45 ] .
all measurements were normalized to the nubbin surface area , which was measured using the aluminum foil technique [ 46 ] .
2 - - in situ experiment in situ experiments were conducted during two consecutive sunny days at the end of august 2012 during the winter austral season .
the study site was located at tabou reef ( 22degrees28.845 ' s ; 166degrees26.806 ' e ) in the southwest new caledonia lagoon at a depth of 5 m. three colonies of ca .
15 cm long of a. muricata were sampled by scuba diving near to the study site .
their bare skeleton ( due to the collect ) was covered by a layer of holdfast epoxy to avoid the development of algae on this part .
specimens were then transferred to benthic chambers left opened until the beginning of the experiment .
four transparent pvc benthic chambers of 0.19 m diameter and 6.4 l volume were used simultaneously , three chambers containing a. muricata colonies and a control one without coral colony to account for seawater microbial activity .
each chamber was hermetically connected to an ysi 6920 multiparameter probe .
seawater was recirculated between the chamber and the probe at a water flow of 2 l min - 1 using an adjustable submersible pump alimented by waterproof batteries [ 47 ] ( fig 1 ) .
photosynthetically active radiation ( par , 400 - 700 nm ) irradiance ( i , mumol photons m - 2 s - 1 ) was measured adjacent to experimental chambers using quantum sensors ( li - 192 sa coupled to a li - 1400 li - cor ) .
oxygen , temperature , salinity and depth were recorded every minute inside each chamber with the ysi 6920 multiparameter probe .

the arrows indicate the direction of the water flux .
during two consecutive days , for each species , six successive incubations of one hour were performed from 11:00 am to 9:00 pm , to encompass the full range of daily irradiance levels , including dark .
the first series of incubations has been realized at seawater natural cobalt concentration ( less than quantification limit measured by [ 36 ]) .
the second series of incubations have been performed on the same coral colonies but 10 ml of a 17 mumol l - 1 cobalt solution have been injected in each chamber at the beginning of each incubation ( cono3 , cpachem , bulgaria ) .
final cobalt concentration into the chambers was equal to 1.06 +/ - 0.16 mug l - 1 ( i.e. polluted ). between incubations , enclosures were left open for at least 30 mn to restore ambient conditions .
photosynthetic , respiration and calcification rates photosynthetic and respiration rates , as well as calcification rates associated to a. muricata metabolism were measured during the in situ incubations at different light levels and in the dark .
at the beginning and at the end of each of the six incubations , seawater samples were collected with 450 ml syringes in each chamber for ph and total alkalinity ( at ) measurements .
ph was measured immediately on board using a ph - meter ( radiometer ph240 ) calibrated with tris / hcl ( 2 - amino - 2 - hydroxymethyl - 1 , 3 - propanediol ) and 2 - aminopyridine / hcl buffer solutions in synthetic seawater of salinity 35 .
samples were then filtered through 0.7 mum whatman glass - fiber filters ( gf / f ) and stored in 250 ml bottles in the dark .
total alkalinity ( mumol kg - 1 ) was further determined on 20 ml subsamples ( 6 replicates ) by gran automatic potentiometric titration ( radiometer , titrilab tim 865 ) using 0.01 m hcl ( see above " seawater carbonate chemistry " for further details ) .
total alkalinity values were corrected for ammonium concentrations which were analyzed on board with the fluorometric method [ 48 ] ( turner trilogy fluorometer ) .
these concentrations were negligible and did not modify at values .
the mean standard deviation of replicate measurements was less than 0.003 mmol l - 1 .
calcification rates at each light level and in the dark were estimated using the alkalinity anomaly technique [ 49 ] as the difference between the final and the initial at values of each incubation .
calcification rates ( cnet , mumol caco3 h - 1 ) were estimated for each incubation using the following equation : cnet = deltaatxvdeltatx2 ( 1 ) where deltaat is the variation of total alkalinity during incubation ( mumol l - 1 ) , v is the volume of the benthic chamber ( l ) and deltat is the incubation time ( h ) .
oxygen production and consumption rates were measured by the oxygen sensor of the ysi probe which was calibrated before each experiment against air saturated with moisture .
rates of photosynthesis and respiration were estimated by regressing oxygen data against time .
net photosynthetic rates were calculated according to the following equation : pnet = ( deltao2 x v ) ( 2 ) where pnet is the rate of net photosynthesis ( mumol o2 h - 1 ) ; v is the volume of the chamber ( l ) ; delta [ o2 ] is the dissolved oxygen variation ( mumol o2 l - 1 h - 1 ) during the 1 h incubation .
at the end of all the incubations coral colonies were frozen ( - 20degreesc ) for further analyses .
photosynthesis , respiration and calcification rates were normalized by unit surface skeleton ( cm - 2 ) , which was measured using measured using the aluminum foil technique [ 46 ] .
for each colony , a michaelis - menten model [ 50,51 ] was iteratively fitted using non - linear regression ( gauss - newton algorithm ) to pnet versus in situ par irradiance ( i , mumol photons m - 2 s - 1 ) , according to the following equation : pnet = pmaxxikm + i - r ( 3 ) where pmax is the gross maximal production rate ( mumol o2 cm - 2 h - 1 ) , km is the half saturation constant ( mumol photons m - 2 s - 1 ) , and r is the respiration in the dark ( mumol o2 cm - 2 h - 1 ). from the equation above , pmax and km have been calculated ( eqs 4 and 5 ) : pmax =( pnet + r ) x ( km + i ) i - r ( 4 ) km =( pmaxxi ) cnet + r - i ( 5 ) the same procedure was also used to fit calcification rates ( cnet ) versus irradiance values .
eqs 6 and 7 were therefore used to calculate maximum fitted calcification values ( cmax ) as follow : cnet = cmaxxikm + i - cdark ( 6 ) cmax =( cnet + cdark ) x ( km + i ) i - cdark ( 7 ) where cmax is the gross maximal calcification rate ( mumol caco3 cm - 2 h - 1 ) , km is the half saturation constant ( mumol photons m - 2 s - 1 ) , and cdark is the calcification rate measured in the dark ( i.e. dissolution , mumol caco3 cm - 2 h - 1 ) .
statistical analysis for the aquaria experiment , three - way anova factorial analyses were used to test the effects of ph ( normal and low ) , cobalt ( normal and polluted ) and tanks ( two replicates ) , independently for each of the two species .
all data were tested for the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity using shapiro wilk 's test and cochran 's c - test respectively .
after verification of the absence of significant differences between tanks ( anova , p > 0.05 ) , data were pooled before proceeding to test for main effect using two - way anovas .
two - way anovas were used to test the effects of pht and cobalt concentrations on zooxanthellae density , chl concentration , net calcification rate , photosynthetic efficiency ( fv / fm ) and maximum electron transport rate ( retrmax ) .
all the tests were performed using prism software ( statsoft ) .
when the anova determined a significant difference , a tukey 's honest significant difference test ( hsd ) was used to attribute differences between specific factors .
all data are expressed as the mean +/ - sd. for each in situ experiment pmax , km and r , as well as cmax and cdark were compared between cobalt concentrations ( i.e. natural vs. polluted ) using f - test according to [ 52 ] .
results 1 - aquaria experiment zooxanthellae density did not differ between experimental treatments ( 2 - way anova , p > 0.05 ; table 1 ) for both s. pistillata ( pooled data , 1.06 x 106 +/ - 2.26 x 105 cells cm - 2 ) and a. muricata ( pooled data , 1.21 x 106 +/ - 1.84 x 105 cells cm - 2 ) .
chl a concentrations slightly but significantly varied between pco2 ( 6.04 +/ - 1.9 and 7.10 +/ - 1.1 mug chl cm - 2 at pht 8.1 and 7.8 respectively ) and its interaction with cobalt ( 6.04 +/ - 1.9 and 7.10 +/ - 1.1 mug chl cm - 2 at natural and polluted concentrations respectively ) for s. pistillata ( interaction pco2 x metal f1,20 = 12.38 , p = 0.002 ; table 1 ) , but not for a. muricata ( pooled data : 6.389 +/ - 1.242 mug chl cm - 2 ; table 1 ) .
concerning their photosynthetic properties , both coral species did not show uniform responses to experimental treatments ( figs 2 and 3 ) .
for s. pistillata , fv / fm and retrmax significantly differed between treatments ( 2 - way anova , p < 0.05 , p < 0.01 respectively ; table 1 ) .
fv / fm was not affected by pco2 treatment ( 2 - way anova , p > 0.05 ; table 1 ) but was enhanced by cobalt with higher values at the polluted metal concentration ( tukey test , p < 0.05 ) , while retrmax values showed an interaction between pco2 and cobalt ( 2 - way anova , f1,36 = 5.30 , p = 0.027 ; table 1 ) .

discussion ocean acidification is one of the major threats that tropical coral reefs are facing during this century .
key life functions in corals , such as growth and photosynthesis , have been shown to be affected by high pco2 levels ( i.e. [ 27,30 ]) .
in addition , near shore coral reefs are often already weakened by coastal human impacts , such as metal pollution , but the combination of ocean acidification and these other anthropogenic pollution forms has not been investigated yet .
thus , this study ( i ) examined , in laboratory conditions , the responses of two corals to the combination of metal pollution ( here the cobalt ) and ocean acidification and ( ii ) determined in situ whether a cobalt input alters the main coral physiological parameters .
cobalt levels added into the experimental tanks and the benthic chambers are realistic since they are in the range of maximal concentrations measured along the coasts of new caledonia [ 36 ] .
our experiments highlighted that even a moderate cobalt concentration ( 0.2 mug l - 1 ) , and without interaction with acidification , adversely affects the growth of both coral species and that an increase in cobalt concentration to 1.06 mug l - 1 leads not only to coral growth decrease , but also to an inhibition of their photosynthesis process .
effect of cobalt enrichment on coral physiology one of the major results of this study is that , at cobalt concentrations regularly measured along the new caledonian coasts for example ( 0.2 mug l - 1 ) [ 36 ] a decrease of 28 % in growth rates is already observed for both species .
furthermore , in situ incubations of a. muricata colonies at a higher concentration ( ca .
1 mug l - 1 ) confirmed these results , revealing coral calcification rates of 70 % lower than at normal cobalt concentrations .
although no study so far have measured the effects of cobalt on coral growth , our result is in agreement with [ 53 ] which demonstrated , for a coccolithophoridae species , cricosphaera carterae that a cobalt concentration of 200 mumoles l - 1 leaded to a decrease in calcium ion incorporation rates .
therefore , our results suggest that near shore reef corals may greatly suffer from metal pollution and , in turn , may be less prone to resist to other anthropogenic stresses .
as calcification and photosynthesis mechanisms are coupled in symbiotic corals [ 29 ] , one should expect that the decrease in calcification rates observed in the present study was combined to an inhibition of the photosynthetic efficiency and / or the zooxanthellae .
however , during the laboratory experiment , the fv / fm measured in s. pistillata and a. muricata ( ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 ) , exposed to an ecologically relevant enrichment in cobalt ( 0.2 mug l - 1 ) , revealed that their photosynthetic processes were stimulated by such moderate cobalt input and were operating at their maximum capacity [ 54 ] .
rather , this moderate cobalt concentration stimulates the retrmax values in s. pistillata and a. muricata .
on the other hand , their zooxanthellae concentrations did not change , suggesting that , unlike iron [ 19 ] , cobalt addition did not stimulate symbiont densities but would rather stimulate the photosynthetic efficiency of these algal cells .
this is consistent with previous studies performed on the same coral species , showing a stimulation of retrmax values in response to a moderate zinc or iron input [ 19,55 ] .
two hypotheses may explain this stimulation : ( i ) as cobalt is a cofactor of the carbonic anhydrase , an additional input would stimulate this enzyme and would bring additional inorganic carbon to the photosynthetic process [ 56,57 ] ; ( ii ) as coral gastric activity harbors a bacterial community able to produce the b12 vitamin , named cobalamin ( due to its cobalt core ) , an enhancement of this vitamin production could stimulate the photosynthetic process [ 58 ] .
when cobalt was equal to ca .
1 mug l - 1 , in the in situ experiments , photosynthetic rates per unit surface area decreased , suggesting that the toxic threshold for zooxanthellae in a. muricata was reached .
this result is consistent with previous studies , in which a clear inhibition of the photosynthetic efficiency of the two branching corals acropora cervicornis and pocillopora damicornis was observed , when they are exposed to elevated copper levels between 4 and 20 mug l - 1 [ 59 ] .
furthermore , as metals are mostly accumulated in coral tissues and more particularly in symbiotic algae [ 55 ] , their expulsion is thought to be a mechanism of metal detoxification .
although our in situ incubations were too short to detect a change in the zooxanthellae density and no measurements have been performed , it is likely that the cobalt level tested reached the zooxanthellae toxic threshold affecting whole coral metabolic functions .
zooxanthellae expulsion was observed for acropora formosa and porites lutea exposed to extreme copper and iron concentrations , from 10 to 100 times higher than the concentrations measured in coral reef surrounding waters [ 18,60 ] .
in conclusion , our results show that while extreme cobalt concentrations may be lethal for corals , reducing calcification and photosynthetic metabolism , a moderate concentration effect may be more species - specific .
two hypotheses may likely explain this antagonism : ( i ) algae and host may be in competition for inorganic carbon for photosynthesis and calcification [ 19,61,62 ] but the coral ability to compete for this substrate may be highly species - specific with some species able to preferentially allocate inorganic carbon to the photosynthetic process ; ( ii ) moderate cobalt concentration might be toxic for the host cells but not yet for the zooxanthellae .
despite these observations , identifying the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of the photosynthetic process or the calcification decrease is beyond the scope of our study and we suggest that further research should be conducted .
effect of pco2 increase on coral physiology higher pco2 levels did not affect the photosynthetic efficiency of both coral species but caused an opposite effect on their retrmax values , stimulating s. pistillata and inhibiting a. muricata .
previous studies focused on the effects of ocean acidification on photosynthetic processes gave ambiguous results .
while the lack of impact for s. pistillata have been already noticed during short - term studies [ 33,63 - 66 ] and are consistent with the assertion that corals do not rely on dissolved co2 for their photosynthesis [ 29 ] ; other studies rather highlighted a detrimental effect of pco2 on the coral photosynthetic efficiency [ 67,68 ] .
response heterogeneity among corals would be linked to the symbiont types [ 69 ] .
no change in the growth rates of s. pistillata and a. muricata was detected between the different pco2 conditions .
these results confirm a recent study performed on s. pistillata , where all coral fragments submitted for one month to high pco2 conditions ( 2,039 muatm ) survived and showed equivalent calcification rates to corals submitted to normal conditions [ 33 ] .
although these results should be taken with caution , since corals were incubated during short periods to low ph , it is consistent with some previous studies showing that some corals are able to calcify at low - ph seawater ( e.g. [ 32,44,70 - 73 ]) .
coral species like s. pistillata and a. muricata would be part of a " low - sensitivity " group to pco2 [ 74 ] and to the " potential winners " that would be able to control ph at their calcification site [ 73 ] and would outcompete species unable to do it [ 34 ] .
furthermore , ocean warming should also to be taken into consideration as [ 64 ] showed that s. pistillata was insensitive to doubled pco2 at 25degreesc but on the other hand experienced a 50 % reduction in calcification rate at a higher temperature (+ 3degreesc ) .
so , based on changes in temperature , some coral species like s. pistillata could shift between insensitivity and high sensitivity to pco2 increase .
even if no interaction between pco2 levels and cobalt concentration has been revealed in our study for these two coral species , it is likely that coral colonies , for which growth rates already decrease by 28 % when submitted to a moderate cobalt input , will be weakened if they are subjected to additional threats ( i.e. temperature increase , other metal pollution , eutrophication ) .
indeed , when their temperature threshold has been exceeded or when corals are submitted to a poor seawater quality , it has been widely demonstrated that they stop their growth and expel their zooxanthellae ( e.g. [ 62,75,76 ]) and so a cobalt pollution would exacerbate these phenomena .
it is also likely that species originally classified into the " highly sensitive group " such as porites lutea or acropora cervicornis for example [ 77 ] will be probably more drastically affected by metal inputs .
in addition , our results only correspond to a five weeks incubation experiment and as it has been demonstrated that metals accumulate in coral tissues [ 55 ] , a longer - term experiment should induce a stronger calcification inhibition and an overrun of the toxicity threshold for the zooxanthellae .
previous studies performed on other marine organisms like copepods and polychaetes demonstrated that metal pollution increases their sensibility to ocean acidification [ 78,79 ] and the present study clearly indicates that it is also the case for corals .

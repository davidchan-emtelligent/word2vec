the u.s. code of federal regulations ( 42 s71.21 ) requires that the master of a ship destined to a u.s. port of entry report certain illnesses , as well as any death onboard to the nearest cdc quarantine station ( 1 ) .
on december 30 , 2015 , the u.s. coast guard notified cdc of the death of a crew member of a foreign cargo vessel off the coast of puerto rico .
four days earlier , on december 26 , the patient , a man aged 50 years from india , developed abdominal pain , headache , and fever ( 103.0degreesf [ 39.4degreesc ]) , followed by loose stools and pruritus .
on december 28 , a vesicular rash appeared on his face , neck , and shoulders .
medical consultants suspected varicella and recommended shipboard isolation .
on december 29 , the vesicles had begun to dry and scab , and he developed a nonproductive cough and reported chest congestion .
on december 30 , he had difficulty breathing and collapsed ; cardiopulmonary resuscitation was unsuccessful .
the puerto rico department of health was contacted to liaise with the medical examiner .
lung tissue and skin lesion specimens collected at autopsy were positive for varicella - zoster virus dna by polymerase chain reaction at cdc .
the cause of death was reported as varicella pneumonia .
no other medical conditions were reported .
per cdc recommendations , all 24 shipmates were considered contacts of the index patient ; the master of the ship instituted daily temperature and rash surveillance for 21 days ( i.e. , one incubation period ) after the death .
on days 13 and 16 of surveillance , two crew members were sent home because of emergencies unrelated to varicella .
san juan and houston cdc quarantine stations coordinated varicella vaccination for the 22 remaining and five new crew members boarding after the end of the 21 - day surveillance , all of whom had unknown varicella immunity .
acyclovir was procured by the ship for treatment of possible additional cases ; however , none occurred .
varicella , a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella - zoster virus , is transmitted by direct contact with vesicle fluid , or through breathing infectious droplets .
varicella is typically a mild disease ; however , adults are at risk for more severe illness and have a higher incidence of complications , most commonly pneumonia ( 2 ) .
adults who grew up in tropical countries or countries where varicella vaccination is uncommon might have increased varicella susceptibility ( 3 ) .
varicella rarely results in death ; mortality rates during 1990 - 1994 ( before vaccine licensure ) were 0.3 per 1,000,000 population among persons aged >= 20 years .
pneumonia was the most common cause of death in previously healthy persons with varicella in this age group ( 4 ) .
before effective chemotherapy , a case fatality rate of 10 % - 30 % was reported among adults with varicella pneumonia ( 5 ) .
this investigation highlights the importance of early notification of illness or death to cdc by ships arriving to u.s. ports of entry , and the use of cdc 's varicella management guidance to prevent further transmission ( 6 ) , including surveillance for febrile rash illness , isolation of cases , screening for varicella immunity , and vaccination of nonimmune persons .
collaboration with the u.s. coast guard was critical for expediting communication with the master of the ship .
assistance from the puerto rico department of health and the puerto rico forensic sciences institute was instrumental in ensuring a thorough and timely investigation and public health response .
keeping a stock of acyclovir onboard was added to the cdc maritime varicella management guidance ( 6 ) .

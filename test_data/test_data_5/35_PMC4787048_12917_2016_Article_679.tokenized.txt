background ketogenesis is a secondary metabolic pathway to provide energy to dairy cows during early lactation ; however when the production of ketone bodies ( acetoacetate , acetone , beta - hydroxybutyrate ) is above certain levels a subclinical disorder may appear .
the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between serum concentrations of beta - hydroxybutyrate ( bhba ) and fatty acid ( fa ) profile of milk with emphasis in conjugated linoleic acid ( cla ) in a population of early lactation holstein cows .
fifty cows between parity 1 and 5 , ranging from 14 to 21 days in milk , were randomly selected from 3 farms of the central area of chile for determination of serum bhba concentrations , milk fat content , and milk fa profiles .
results cows were divided in low ( n = 26 ) and high ( n = 24 ) bhba groups considering the median value of the serum concentration of bhba ( 0.7 mmol / l ) ( sem = 0.094 ) .
mean milk fat % was 3.45 % and 3.60 % for cows in the low and high bhba groups , respectively ( p = 0.15 ) .
concentrations of several fa were significantly different between both groups .
specifically , mean cla concentrations were 0.40 % ( 4 +/ - 0.03 g / kg ) and 0.33 % ( 3.3 +/ - 0.03 g / kg ) for the low and high bhba groups , respectively ( p = 0.05 ) .
conclusions it is concluded that early postpartum cows with serum bhba > 0.7 mmol / l tended to have higher milk fat % and had significantly lower concentrations of cla than early postpartum cows with bhba <= 0.7 mmol / l. keywords ketone bodies conjugated linoleic acid beta - hydroxybutyrate issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background ketogenesis is a common metabolic pathway to provide energy to dairy cows during early lactation ; however the synthesis of large amounts of ketone bodies ( acetoacetate , acetone , and beta hydroxyl butyrate [ bhba ]) may result in a typical metabolic disorder denominated ketosis [ 4 ] .
several studies have shown that high levels of bhba are associated with increased risk of periparturient diseases , losses in milk yield and impaired fertility [ 4 , 9 , 11 , 12 ] .
in addition , increased concentrations of bhba were associated with greater milk fat and lower milk protein percentages in the first dairy herd improvement test day of lactation [ 4 ] .
conjugated linoleic acid ( cla ) is one component of milk fat that might be beneficial to human health due to anticarcinogenic properties [ 15 ] .
however , this potential benefit has been described for only few isomers of cla , especially for those called cla cis - 9 , tans - 11 .
strategies such as commercial sources of cla added into dairy cattle diets is one potential means of increasing cla content of milk [ 5 ] .
conversely , there might be several factors decreasing the levels of cla in milk such as feeding excessive grains ( starch ) , corn silage and products rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids ( e.g. vegetable oils ) [ 8 ] .
as stated previously , the association of high levels of ketone bodies and greater milk fat percentage in dairy cattle has been reported [ 3 , 4 , 10 ] .
however , these studies did not evaluate fatty acid ( fa ) profile in milk .
the hypothesis of this study was that there is a relationship between bhba levels and fa profile of milk in early lactation holstein cows .
the objective of this study was to determine the association of plasma concentrations of bhba and fa profile of milk with special emphasis in cla in early lactation holstein cows .
results and discussion the median value of bhba concentration was 0.7 +/ - 0.094 mmol / l. twenty six cows were classified as having a plasma concentration of bhba of <= a 0,7 mmol / l and 24 cows as having a plasma concentration of bhba of > 0,7 mmol / l. the reason for using the median value as cut - off point was to develop two groups with comparable number of animals .
when the cut - off for subclinical ketosis of 1.2 mmol / l of bhba [ 14 ] was considered , only 7 cows ( 14 %) were above this concentration , and 43 cows were below this value ; consequently there was not sufficient statistical power to conduct the analysis .
for all study variables ( fat % and fatty acids ) the interaction of group by parity was not significant ; therefore only main effects are reported .
the milk fat content ( g / kg ) of cows with high and low bhba was 3.60 % and 3.45 % , respectively ( p = 0.15 ) .
consequently , there was a tendency for milk fat content to be higher in the group of cows with bhba > 0.7 mmol / l. this is in agreement with the study conducted by duffield et al [ 4 ] where cows with higher levels of bhba had higher concentration of milk fat than cows with low levels of bhba .
this association might be reasonable since bhba is used as precursor for milk fat synthesis in the mammary gland .
short - and medium - chain fa ( 4 to 14 carbons ) and a portion of the 16 - carbon fa are derived from de novo synthesis from acetate and to a lesser extent butyrate [ 1 ] .
conversely , preformed fa that account for the remaining 16 - carbon and all of the longer - chain fa (> 16 carbons ) are taken up from the circulating plasma pool .
these long fa originate from absorption from the digestive tract or mobilization from body reserves .
adipose tissue mobilization accounts for less than 10 % of preformed fa in milk fat , except during periods of negative energy balance when their proportion increases substantially [ 1 ] .
in table 1 , the least squared mean concentration and sem of milk fa ( g / kg of fat ) of both group is presented .
an interesting finding of this study was that the concentration of cla in milk in cows with bhba <= 0.7 mmol / l was higher than in cows with levels of bhba > 0.7 mmol / l ( p <= 0.05 ) .
differences were also found for 18:1 ( all isomers ) .
in addition , results from the multivariate regression model ( table 2 ) show there was a tendency that for each 0.1 mmol / l of bhba in plasma , cla ( all isomers ) decreased in 0.2 g / kg of total fat ( p = 0.15 ) .
this association was established correcting for milk yield , solid contents , somatic cell counts and milk urea nitrogen .
the total r 2 for the predicting equation was 0.59 , indicating that 59 % of the variation of cla in milk was explained by the current model .
the partial slope for bhba was essentially linear , without evidence of polynomial effects .
fatty acid metabolism in the rumen has a major influence on the fa profile in milk [ 7 ] .
the cla are present at higher concentrations in ruminant products because they are formed in the rumen from dietary linoleic and linolenic acid .
this transformation is due to via three major processes carried out by rumen microbes : lipolysis , biohydrogenation and isomerization .
these mechanisms are dependent on the type and amount of fat entering the rumen [ 2 ] and ruminal ph [ 14 ] .
the question arising is why levels of blood bhba > 0.7 mmol / l might be negatively related to cla in milk .
bhba is synthesized in the liver through the process of ketogenesis [ 6 ] and in the rumen through butyrate - producing bacteria [ 7 ] .
in addition , all bacteria that produced substantial quantities of cis - 9 , trans - 11 - cla , trans - 11 - 18:1 , or both from linoleic acid were butyrate producers ( mostly butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ) .
however , not all butyrate producers yield cis - 9 , trans - 11 - cla or trans - 11 - 18:1 .
other source of cla is cell membrane from protozoa .
protozoa contained at least 2 to 3 times more unsaturated fa than bacteria .
these unsaturated fa included cla and trans - 11 - 18:1 , which were more than 8 - and 3 - fold more abundant in protozoa than in bacteria , respectively .
as a result , the flow of fa from protozoa accounted for between 30 and 43 % of the cla and 40 % of the trans - 11 - 18:1 reaching the duodenum [ 17 ] .
the contribution of protozoa to the flows of 16:0 and 18:0 to the duodenum was less than 20 and 10 % , respectively .
although protozoa do not themselves produce cla and trans - 11 - 18:1 by their own metabolism ; they might be expected to have a significant influence on cla and trans - 11 - 18:1 available to the host animal [ 17 ] .
in this sense , the content of cla in milk is explained by several highly complex mechanisms .
since butyrate is precursor for short and medium chain milk fa it is reasonable to suggest that higher concentrations of blood butyrate would increase milk fat through fatty acids < 16 c ; and would decrease proportionally long chain fatty acids .
this is partially true , because in the present study most of short and medium chain fa , and 18:1 were higher in cows with bhba > 0.7 mmol / l than in cows with bhba <= 0.7 mmol / l. accordingly , even though , trans - 11 c18:1 and cis - 9 , trans - 11 cla are the predominant trans fa intermediates produced from the ruminal metabolism of linoleic acid ; ruminal biohydrogenation pathways are dynamic , allowing the production of a wide range of positional and geometric isomers as well as modified fa such as hydroxy and keto derivatives [ 7 , 13 ] .

methods dairy farms the study was conducted during 2010 in three dairy farms from the central area of chile .
the study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the university santo tomas animal care guidelines .
no procedure causing more than momentary discomfort was performed during this study .
in addition , all the animal related actions had the consent of the university animal care committee and the dairy owners .
average herd size was 350 lactating holstein cows .
rolling herd average milk yield was 10,000 to 12,000 kg me 305 and selected farms followed similar management practices .
farms housed cows in sand - bedded free - stalls and milked 3 times a day .
feed management consisted of a unique total mixed ration based on alfalfa hay , corn silage , corn grain , soybean meal , wet brewer grain , wheat bran , distiller derivative grain solubles , minerals and vitamins .
farms used computerized record systems ; consequently individual milk yield was recorded daily based on computerized milking parlors .
during early lactation cows were subjected to a postpartum health management protocol .
after calving cows were checked for retained fetal membranes and the development of milk fever .
daily clinical examination and rectal temperature were conducted until 14 days postpartum .
milk bhba colorimetric testing ( ketotest , nagoya , japan ) was conducted at once between 14 to 21 days postpartum .
sick cows were treated as needed .
study design in order to find a difference in 0.1 +/ - 0.1 g of cla per kg of milk fat , with a 95 % of confidence and 80 % of power , a sample size of 13 cows per group was required .
weekly visits for the 3 farms were conducted between may and august of 2010 until 50 cows within 14 and 21 days in milk were obtained .
blood and milk samples were collected from each cow the same day of assortment .
blood sample for plasma collection was obtained from the coccygeal vessels using a vacuatainer system and centrifuged at 4000 x g for 10 min .
plasma was separated and stored in plastic tubes and frozen at - 20 degreesc until analysis .
plasma samples were submitted to the laboratory of clinical pathology of university of santo tomas , vina del mar , chile .
the determination of plasma bhba concentrations was conducted using a commercial kit ( pointe scientific , inc .
bha set. , lincoln park , mi , usa ) , based on an enzymatic - colorimetric method [ 16 ] .
samples were assayed in duplicate with a coefficient of variation of 4.8 % .
a milk composite sample was obtained during the morning milking in a plastic tube with preservative ( 2 - bromo - 2 - nitropropane - 1 - 2 - diol ). and immediately after collection submitted to the laboratory of biochemistry at the catholic university of valparaiso , chile , for milk fat content and milk fa profile analysis .
the determination of milk fat ( g / kg ) was determined using infrared spectroscopy ( milkoscan ( tm ) minor , dk - 3400 , hilleroed , denmark ) .
milk samples were analyzed for individual fa by gas chromatograph - mass spectrometry ( gcms ) of butyl esters .
the identification of fatty acids was based on the comparison of retention times of standard methyl esters ranging from c4 to c24 ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) .
calibration standards were achieved from seven different concentrations , depending on the particular fa. quality control samples were prepared at four different concentrations .
the methodology consisted as follow : 0.5 ml of milk was placed into test tubes with teflon - lined screw caps , followed by the addition of 750 mul of n - butanol .
samples were vortexed at low speed while 75 mul of acetyl chloride was added .
then , samples were gassed with n2 , capped tightly , and heated at 100 degreesc for 1.5 h. after samples cooled to room temperature , 5 ml of 6 % k2co3 and 1 ml of hexane were added , and the samples were vortexed for 30 s. samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 2500 g , and the bottom layer was aspirated and discarded .
the remaining layer was washed four times ( 20 min at 2500 g ) with distilled , deionized water .
the upper layer was removed and placed in injection vials for analysis .
fatty acid analysis of butyl esters was conducted with a gcms model qp5050a , series splitless ( shimadzu ( r ) , shimadzu europa gmbh , albert - hahn - str. 6 - 10 47269 , duisburg , germany ) .
results were expressed as percentage relative to each fa detected in the chromatogram according to its retention time and identification based on pure standard .
subsequently , the median value for bhba concentrations ( 0.7 mmol / l ) was considered as a cut - off value to obtain balanced numbers of animals in the low and high bhba groups .
milk fat ( g / kg ) and fa ( g / kg ) content between the 2 groups were analyzed by anova , developing a mixed model that also included parity ( primiparous , multiparous ) and farm ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
potential interaction between group and parity was also explored .
least squared means were estimated and tested for significant differences .
in addition , a multivariate regression model was conducted to predict total cla ( g / kg ) in milk from plasma bhba as a continuous variable , correcting for fat and protein % in milk , milk urea nitrogen ( mg / dl ) , somatic cell count ( cells / ml ) and average milk yield until 60 days in milk ( kg / d ) .
statistical analysis was performed using the corresponding procedure of sas ( release 9.0 ; sas institute inc. , cary , nc ) .
statistical significance was set at p <= 0.05 ; a tendency was set at 0.05 < p <= 0.15 .

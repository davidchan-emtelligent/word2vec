background kir genes coding for natural killer cell immunoglobulin - like receptors , kir , influence the effector and regulatory function of nk cells as well as some subpopulations of t lymphocytes ( e.g. cd4 + cd28 - kir +) depending on presence of ligands ( particularly hla - c molecules ) .
kir - kir ligand interaction may lead to the development of autoimmune disorders , including rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) .
however , their role in the response of ra patients to methotrexate therapy is not known .
methods kir genes and kir - ligand ( hla - c c1 / c2 allomorphs ) genotyping was performed using the pcr - ssp method in 312 ra patients ( 179 classified as good responders and 133 as poor responders using das28 criteria ) .
thus , we evaluated the association of kir genes and hla - c allomorphs with the response to methotrexate ( mtx ) treatment .
results we observed that patients possessing the full - length kir2ds4 ( kir2ds4f ) gene had a lower chance of responding in comparison to kir2ds4f - negative cases .
this phenomenon was observed both in erosive disease ( ed ) and rheumatoid factor ( rf ) positive and in ed - and rf - negative patients .
interestingly , the observed effect of the kir2ds4f gene was strongest in individuals possessing medium values ( 20 - 33 mm / h ) of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) .
patients with high esr values had low probability and , in contrast , patients with low esr had a high probability of mtx response , and the presence of kir2ds4f did not affect their outcome .
additionally , we show that the kir2ds4f effect did not depend on the presence of either c1 or c2 allomorphs .
conclusion our results suggest that the response of ra patients with medium esr values to mtx treatment may be dependent on the full - length kir2ds4 gene .
rheumatoid arthritis treatment response methotrexate kir kir ligand background rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a chronic , relatively prevalent ( about 1 % of individuals in caucasians ) inflammatory disorder with a t cell - mediated autoimmune component [ 1 ] .
natural killer ( nk ) cells were also reported to contribute to ra [ 2 ] .
these cells may act both directly , killing target cells , and indirectly , as either inducer or regulatory cells influencing innate and adaptive immunity ( a " two - edged weapon ") [ 3 ] .
the most polymorphic receptors of nk cells are encoded by killer cell immunoglobulin - like receptor ( kir ) genes distributed differently in unrelated individuals .
since these receptors , depending on their structure , are either inhibitory or activating , their repertoire in a genotype affects activity of nk cells ( and t cell subpopulations which also express kirs , including t lymphocyte cd4 + cd28 - kir +) and , in consequence , susceptibility to different diseases including autoimmune disorders such as ra [ 4 - 6 ] .
kir haplotypes ( i.e. , sets of kir genes on one chromosome ) have been divided into group a , containing mostly inhibitory genes , and group b , containing several activating genes in addition to inhibitory ones .
moreover , the whole kir region was divided into centromeric ( a or b ) and telomeric ( a or b ) halves , depending on the kir gene content [ 7 ] .
ligands of kirs , in most cases where known , are human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) class i molecules which are extremely polymorphic .
kir and hla genes are located on different chromosomes ( number 19 and 6 , respectively ) ; therefore they are independently inherited and an individual may have kirs with no ligands and vice versa .
this affects the maturation of nk cells and the susceptibility of an individual to disease [ 8,9 ] .
the most important ligands of kirs are hla - c molecules , which all fall into two groups : c1 , with an asparagine residue in position 80 , and c2 , with a lysine residue in this position .
kir2dl1 and kir2ds1 are receptors for the c2 epitope , whereas kir2dl2 and kir2dl3 bind c1 and also some c2 molecules .
kir2ds4 recognizes hla - a * 11 molecules as well as some c1 and c2 .
kir2dl4 binds the " non - classical " class i molecule hla - g .
kir3dl1 and possibly kir3ds1 bind hla - b with bw4 epitope and those hla - a alleles that possess the bw4 motif .
kir3dl2 binds hla - a * 03 ,* 11 , and microbial cpg dna [ 10 ] .
in addition , both kir3dl1 and kir3dl2 bind hla - b * 27 homodimers [ 11,12 ] .
as kir and kir ligand genotypes affect the immune response , and seem to influence the response to ra treatment using anti - tnf - alpha agents [ 13 ] , we wondered whether these genotypes might also influence the outcome of mtx therapy of ra. mtx as a foliate antagonist is used in therapy of malignant disorders , but also suppresses the immune response in patients and in low doses was introduced for the treatment of ra because of its presumed anti - proliferative , immunosuppressive and anti - inflammatory properties [ 14 ] .
however , mtx is not sufficient in all ra patients , and approximately 50 - 60 % of ra patients could be classified as mtx responders [ 15 - 18 ] .
it seems that the effectiveness of mtx treatment corresponds to the individual genetic background , particularly in genes encoding key molecules of methotrexate metabolism and toxicity [ 19,20 ] .
however , clinically reliable markers of methotrexate efficiency are still sought .
methods study subjects three hundred and twelve patients ( 253 females , 59 males ; mean age , 58.0 +/ - 12.7 years , range 23 - 90 ; disease duration , 10.0 +/ - 8.8 years , range 1 - 50 ; age at onset 48.0 +/ - 13.1 , range 10 - 80 ) were diagnosed with ra according to the criteria of the american college of rheumatology ( table 1 ) .
patients were recruited from the outpatient and inpatient population of the department of rheumatology , county hospital in szczecin , poland .
all subjects were caucasian , from the pomeranian region of poland .
the subjects enrolled in the study underwent routine biochemical blood analysis , and when required , assays for anti - cardiolipin antibodies , anti - nuclear antibodies , and immunological complexes .
x - rays of the chest , hands , and feet were obtained in all patients and , when required , radiographs of other joints .
these were interpreted by two expert radiologists .
the evaluation of the subjects included physical examination , with particular focus on the pattern of joint involvement and the occurrence of extra - articular features ( such as vasculitis , anemia , sicca syndrome , amyloidosis , organ involvement ) and laboratory features , such as rheumatoid factor ( rf ) and anti - cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies ( anti - ccp ) screened for using appropriate elisa kits .
amyloidosis was diagnosed by histomorphology ( skin and bowel or duodenum biopsy ) , vasculitis by histomorphology ( skin biopsy ) and angiogram .

no patients received any other disease - modifying antirheumatic drug ( dmard ) , and no researchers' involvement in the patient care was practiced .
a good mtx response was noted for patients who were receiving mtx and had a disease activity score based on 28 joint counts ( das28 ) of <= 2.5 at 6 months .
poor responders were defined as patients who were also receiving mtx but had a das28 of > 2.5 [ 21,22 ] .
the study was approved by the committee of ethical affairs of the pomeranian medical university in szczecin and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects .
dna isolation , kir and kir ligand typing these procedures were performed as described previously [ 23,24 ] .
statistical analysis to investigate relationship between genetic , clinical and anthropological variables and probability of a good response to mtx treatment , a generalized linear model with binomial errors was used .
the akaike information criterion was used as a measure of fit of models .
a bootstrap approach was employed to estimate model coefficients and 95 % confidence intervals .
odds ratio ( or ) was computed as a measure of effect size .
arithmetic mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables .
haplotype frequencies for kir repertoire were estimated with maximum likelihood function [ 25 ] .
the likelihood ratio statistic , lrs , was used to test the differences in haplotype frequencies between good responders and poor responders .
lrs df = 21 = 2 ( llgood + llpoor - llcombined ) and lrs is approximately a chi2 df = 21 .
results were regarded as statistically significant at p < 0.05 .
results a clinical response to mtx therapy was obtained for 57.3 % of ra patients .
when the frequencies of the kir genes were compared between good responders and poor responders of ra patient groups , we observed an effect of only one kir gene , full - length kir2ds4 ( kir2ds4f ) , on the response to mtx therapy .
namely , patients possessing this gene had a lower chance of responding ( p = 0.0334 , or = 0.4344 , 95 % ci = 0.215 , 0.987 ; table 2 ) .
additionally , patients with erosive disease ( ed ) and rheumatoid factor ( rf ) were less likely to respond to mtx , and those positive for kir2ds4f had an even lower chance than those who were negative for kir2ds4f but positive for both ed and rf ( 36.2 % and 43.6 % of good responders , respectively ; table 3 ) .
similarly , ra patients negative for ed and rf also had a lower chance of responding to mtx therapy if they possessed kir2ds4f ( 75 % responding in comparison to 88 % within kir2ds4f - negative patients ; table 3 ) .
on the other hand , the presence of kir2ds4f did not affect the formation of rf ( p = 0.89 ) , ed ( p = 0.78 ) , or other clinical parameters ( data not shown ) .

the kir2ds4f gene is located in the telomeric half of the kir locus [ 7 ] .
however , we did not observe any differences between good and poor mtx responders in the estimated haplotype frequencies for the telomeric kir repertoire ( p = 0.29 ; figure 1 ) despite the association of the kir2ds4f gene with a poor response to mtx described above .
also , there were no differences in frequencies of centromeric ( p = 0.71 ) or whole kir locus ( p = 0.96 ) genotypes between good and poor responders .

estimation of kir gene frequency based on haplotype distributions shown for kir3dl1 - 81.5 % and 78.7 % , for kir3ds1 18.6 % and 21.5 % , for kir2ds5 15.9 % and 18.1 % , for kir2ds1 22.4 % and 26.0 % , for kir2ds4f 16.4 % and 20.3 % , for kir2ds4d 63.3 % and 56.3 % , in good responder and poor responder groups , respectively .
the effect of the kir2ds4f gene on the probability of a response to mtx in rf - and ed - positive patients was strongest in individuals with medium values of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , that is , log ( esr ) about 3.0 - 3.5 , i.e. 20 - 33 mm / h ( figure 2 ) .
patients with high esr values had a low probability of responding , and the presence or absence of kir2ds4f did not affect their outcome , particularly in individuals with low age at onset .
patients with low esr had a high probability of responding , which was not affected by the presence of kir2ds4f , particularly in people with high age at onset ( figure 2 ) .
the kir2ds4f effect did not depend on the presence of c1 ( p = 0.209 ) or c2 ( p = 0.484 ) .
surprisingly , the age at diagnosis had a negligible influence on the kir2ds4f effect .
figure 2 probability difference in mtx response between kir2ds4f - positive and kir2ds4f - negative patients with similar ra baseline .
discussion this report confirms that almost one third of patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis do not respond to low - dose mtx treatment [ 15 - 18 ] .
this phenomenon causes that the discovery of ( bio ) markers of response to the drug is still required for clinical practice .
here , we found a negative association of the kir2ds4f gene with the response of ra patients to mtx treatment .
this effect was visible not only in rf - positive , ed - positive patients who already had a lower chance of responding than negative ones , but also in rf - and ed - negative individuals who otherwise were better responders .
therefore , it is likely that the kir2ds4f gene is expressed on effectors or positive regulators or inducers of autoimmune response , relatively resistant to the mtx effect .
in this context , the cd4 + cd28 - subpopulation of t lymphocytes should be discussed .
this t cell subset is rare in healthy individuals ( about 1 % of peripheral lymphocytes ) , but its expansion was observed in patients affected by , e.g. , coronary artery disease [ 26 ] , polycystic ovary syndrome [ 27 ] , multiple sclerosis [ 28 ] and rheumatoid arthritis [ 4,29,30 ] .
in contrast to those isolated from healthy volunteers [ 31 ] , cd4 + cd28 - t cells from rheumatoid arthritis patients may exhibit autoreactive properties [ 4 ] .
instead of the cd28 molecule , these t cells frequently express activating kir receptors , as was shown by yen et al. [ 32 ] particularly for kir2ds2 in ra vasculitis .
interestingly , it was suggested that the kir2ds4 gene may also be expressed on cd4 + cd28 - t lymphocytes [ 33 ] , and could transmit an activating signal to effector cells .
therefore , kir2ds4f gene - positive patients might have a potential to produce cd4 + cd28 - kir2ds4 + t cells contributing to more severe forms of ra , which would be more resistant to therapy , including mtx treatment .
the gene mentioned above encodes the kir2ds4f polyspecific receptor recognizing both hla - a * 11 and some hla - c allotypes bearing c1 or c2 epitopes [ 10 ] .
in caucasians , including poles , its gene is present in roughly one third of kir2ds4 - positive individuals , the other two thirds bearing its defective alleles , kir2ds4d ( see http :// www.allelefrequencies.net database ) [ 34 ] , potentially encoding a soluble molecule which does not exhibit any activating properties [ 35 ] .
however , in far east orientals , japanese and chinese , the proportions between kir2ds4f and kir2ds4d are reversed [ 33 ] .
it would be interesting , then , to perform a similar analysis of ra patients' response to mtx therapy in those populations , especially as the kir2ds4 gene seems to impact on ra susceptibility in taiwanese patients [ 36 ] .
some studies suggest that esr level , mentioned as a biomarker for chronic systemic inflammation as well as a parameter of disease activity , correlated with responsiveness to mtx ( reviewed by romao et al . )
[ 37 ] .
in the present study , we see that the effect of kir2ds4f is strongest in individuals with medium susceptibility to the therapeutic effect of mtx characterized by an intermediate level of esr .
patients with high esr are resistant to therapy , and lack of the kir2ds4f gene cannot help them ; those with low esr respond so well that even the presence of the kir2ds4f gene does not cause any harm .
conclusion this study shows that the presence of the full - length kir2ds4 gene reduces the probability that patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis will respond to methotrexate therapy .
this phenomenon was strongest in individuals with a medium level ( 20 - 33 mm / h ) of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate .
the patient cohort with lower values of ers responded better to mtx , while patients with a higher esr level responded worse to therapy , and the presence of kir2ds4f did not affect their outcome .
therefore , our findings , if confirmed using an independent and larger group of patients , might suggest that kir typing could help to predict the response to mtx therapy , especially for patients with moderate rheumatoid arthritis .

when i was appointed to the position of editor - in - chief in 2014 , i wrote in the editorial that " our greatest challenge is to continue to improve the journal in such a way as to provide essential and timely information regarding research in the field of tropical medicine and global health " [ 1 ] .
to achieve this goal , we set up a target to shorten the submission / review / decision cycle to 21 days after the initial submission .
i am delighted to report that this target was achieved in two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015 : the average duration was 21.0 and 19.0 days , respectively .
this achievement owes greatly to the efforts of our reviewers and editors .
we believe that speedy publication will help to ensure that tmh papers are read and cited more often by experts in the related fields .
tmh is attracting ever greater attention .
the number of accesses and downloads of the papers on the journal website increased 3.9 and 2.6 times , respectively , in 2015 , compared to the average in 2013 .
we also received 46 % more submissions to tmh in 2015 compared to 2013 .
while this is due in part to our promotion campaign as well as our recent decision to send e - mail announcements to society members right after a paper is published online , we are deeply indebted to all of our authors , reviewers , and readers for their enthusiastic cooperation .
now i am pleased to announce that biomed central is the new publisher of tmh .
we have taken this opportunity to revise the aims and scope of the journal to incorporate , in addition to traditional tropical medicine , the issue of global health .
global health is health of populations in a global context which can be characterized by a " health issue that concerns many countries or is affected by transnational determinants " [ 2 ] .
while traditional tropical medicine is still central to our scope , tmh welcomes clinical , epidemiological , laboratory , and policy research physically implemented in non - tropics when related to health issues in the tropics or in a global context .
tmh will continue as an open - access publication as part of biomed central 's high - quality portfolio of open - access journals .
authors can expect accepted manuscripts to be published online in professionally copy - edited and typeset form within a few weeks of acceptance .
finally , i would like to convey my cordial request to all our contributors for their continued support of tmh .
the tmh staff will continue to make their utmost efforts to achieve speedy publication and to provide essential and timely information on high - quality research in the field of tropical medicine and global health .
on behalf of the editorial board and tmh staff , i look forward to working with you and serving the community .

a burst in the production of pro - inflammatory molecules characterizes the beginning of the host response to infection .
cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors work in concert to control pathogen replication and activate innate and adaptive immune responses .
granulocyte colony - stimulating factor ( g - csf ) mobilizes and activates hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow , and it has been shown to mediate the generation of effective immunity against bacterial and fungal infections .
g - csf is produced at high levels in the lungs during infection with influenza and parainfluenza viruses , but its role during these infections is unknown .
here we show that during infection of mice with a non - lethal dose of influenza or sendai virus , g - csf promotes the accumulation of activated ly6g + granulocytes that control the extent of the lung pro - inflammatory response .
remarkably , these g - csf - mediated effects facilitate viral clearance and sustain mouse survival .
introduction infection of mice with either the murine parainfluenza virus sendai ( sev ) or mouse adapted influenza a virus triggers robust production of pro - inflammatory molecules in the respiratory tract .
this cytokine burst is followed by massive infiltration of neutrophils , monocytes , nk cells , dcs and other cell types to the lung .
cytokines and infiltrating cells play a critical role in the clearance of the infection and in the initiation of adaptive immunity [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
in addition , cytokines produced in the infected lung are transmitted systemically through the blood to alert bone marrow ( bm ) leukocytes of the presence of the virus , and to condition them to better fight the infection [ 2 ] .
g - csf is found in high levels in the lung and blood of mice infected with influenza or parainfluenza virus [ 2 ] .
g - csf plays a major role in the mobilization and activation of neutrophils and other myeloid cells from the bm [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] and is currently used to promote mobilization of bm cells in different clinical settings [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
g - csf receptor - deficient mice are severely neutropenic and show altered responses to bacterial and fungal infections [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
however , the role of g - csf during respiratory viral infection has not been directly evaluated .
here we show that g - csf regulates lung inflammation during viral infection and that this cytokine is critical for the survival of the host during infection with influenza or the murine parainfluenza virus sendai .
materials and methods mice and viruses age and sex - matched mixed background g - csf - / - ( b6 ; 129p2 - csf3tm1ard / j ) [ 9 ] and control mice of the best approximate mixed background ( b6129pf2 / j ) from the jackson laboratory were used in most experiments .
g - csf - / - mice backcrossed to c57bl / 6 mice for 7 generations were used where indicated .
mice were bred and housed in pathogen - free conditions and the experiments were performed according to institutionally approved protocols ( specific approvals for this project were obtained from the institutional animal care and use committees of the mount sinai school of medicine (# 08 - 0160 ) and the university of pennsylvania (# 803173 )) .
sev strain 52 and influenza virus strains pr8 ( a / pr / 8 / 1934 ( h1n1 )) and x31 ( a / hk x31 ( h3n2 )) were grown in 10 - day embryonated chicken eggs ( spafas ; charles river laboratories ) .
allantoic fluid was snap frozen in an ethanol - dry ice bath and stored at - 80degreesc .
mice infection and lung virus titration infections with sev strain 52 were performed in anesthetized mice via intranasal inoculation of 104 infectious viral particles in 35 microl of pbs .
this dose was previously determined in our laboratory to reliably establish non - lethal infections [ 3 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
influenza virus infections were performed via aerosol by placing the mice into a whole body exposure infection chamber ( glass - col corp , model a4212 ) utilizing a nebulization - infection cycle of 30 min .
influenza virus strain pr8 was aerosolized at a concentration of 108 virus particles in 12 ml pbs .
influenza virus x31 was aerosolized at a concentration of 109 virus particles in 12 ml pbs .
nebulization was achieved at a vacuum of 30 standard cubic feet per hour ( scfh ) and compressed air flow of 15 scfh .
the chamber was uv - decontaminated in between viruses .
under these conditions , 100 % of the animals were infected and showed reproducible lung titers in several experiments at every time point analyzed .
virus titers were determined by infecting permissive cell lines llcmk2 ( atcc ; ccl - 7.1 ) ( sev ) or mdck ( influenza ) [ 2 ] with serial dilutions of lung homogenates in the presence 2 microg / ml of trypsin for 72 h at 37degreesc .
supernatants were tested by hemagglutination of chicken rbcs ( lampire ) for the presence of virus particles .
rhg - csf injections 250 microg / kg rhg - csf ( neupogen / filgrastim , amgen , thousand oak , ca ) [ 15 ] or distilled sterile water was injected ip daily to g - csf - / - mice starting four days before infection .
some mice continued to receive rhg - csf injections daily for the duration of the experiment .
in vivo neutrophil depletion mice were injected intraperitoneally with 400 microg / mouse of an isotype control ( 2a3 ) or with rat anti - lymphocyte antigen 6 complex , locus g ( ly6g ) antibody ( 1a8 ; bioxcell , west lebanon , nh ) .
antibody injections were performed at 24 and 0 h prior to infection and every 48 h thereafter .
flow cytometry lungs were flushed with cold pbs containing 0.5 mm edta prior to grinding and digestion with collagenase ( liberase blendzymes , roche , indianapolis , in ) .
blood was collected with heparinized capillary tubes .
bm was flushed with ice - cold pbs .
erythrocytes were eliminated from the lung , blood , and bm samples using rbcs lysis buffer ( bd biosciences ) .
single - cell suspensions were incubated with anti - mouse cd16 / 32 ( bd biosciences ) for 10 min at 4degreesc .
the following antibodies from bd biosciences or ebioscience were used for staining : b220 ( ra3 - 6b2 ) , cd3 ( 145 - 2c11 ) , cd4 ( gk1.5 ) , cd8alpha ( 53 - 6.7 ) , cd19 ( 1d3 ) , nk1.1 ( pk136 ) , ter119 , cd11b ( m1 / 70 ) , cd11c ( hl3 ) , cd45.2 ( 104 ) , cd115 ( afs98 ) , ly6c ( al - 21 ) , gr - 1 ( rb6 - 8c5 ) ly6g ( 1a8 ) .
mpdca - pe ( jf05 - 1c2.4.1 ) was obtained from miltenyi biotec .
cytokine detection in serum and lung whole lung was ground in 1.8 ml 0.01 % gelatin / pbs .
cytokine concentration was analyzed by multiplex elisa ( milipore ) .
g - csf concentration was measured by elisa ( r & d ) .
detection of virus specific antibodies elisa plates were coated with purified sev ( 5 microg / ml ) overnight .
plates were blocked with pbs / bsa for 2 h. dilutions of lung homogenate from infected and non - infected mice were incubated overnight at 4degreesc .
sev specific antibodies of different isotypes were detected by peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibodies ( jackson immunoresearch ) .
in vivo cytotoxic t lymphocyte ( ctl ) assay splenocytes from naive mice were pulsed with 20 microg / ml sev np324 - 332 peptide or with 20 microg / ml influenza pr8 np ( 366 - 374 ) peptide in pbs as previously described [ 14 ] .
in vivo phagocytosis assay yellow - green fluorescent latex particles ( 10 microm , polysciences ) or unlabeled particles were diluted 1:20 in pbs and 30 microl of the dilution was administered intranasally to anesthetized mice .
mice were sacrificed 4 h later and bead uptake by lung leukocytes was analyzed by flow cytometry .
histology and bronchoalveolar lavage ( bal ) analysis bal was obtained after one cycle of infusion and aspiration into the lungs of 1 ml of sterile saline as previously described [ 16 ] .
cell pellets obtained after bal centrifugation at 400 g were suspended in 500 microl of pbs and counted manually for total cell counts ( tlc ) .
cell - free bal was aliquoted and frozen until further analysis .
total protein in bal was measured by the coomasie blue spectrophotometric assay ( bio rad ) using bsa dilutions as standards .
after lavage , the left lobe of the lung was inflation - fixed with 0.5 ml of 10 % neutral buffered formalin for histological analysis .
paraffin sections from fixed lungs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and scored on the basis of presence and absence of peribronchiolar and alveolar infiltration , vascular congestion and alveolar edema [ 17 ] .
enrichment of ly6g + cells from bone marrow bone marrow from femur and tibia of wt and g - csf - / - mice was flushed out with serum - free dmem ( invitrogen ) supplemented with antibiotics .
ly6g + cells were enriched by positive selection using magnetic beads .
non - specific antibody binding on cells was blocked using anti - cd16 / cd32 .
up to 1x108 bone marrow cells were incubated on ice for 15 min with biotin - anti ly6g antibody ( 1a8 , biolegend ) , followed by incubation with anti - biotin microbeads ( miltenyi biotech ) .
an enrichment column was used per manufacturer 's instructions to collect ly6g + and ly6g - fractions .
the separated fractions were spun at 400 g for 10 min and the cell pellets suspended in trizol ( invitrogen ) for rna extraction and qpcr analysis .
a sample of each sample was analyzed by cytospin , confirming a > 95 % enrichment of polymorphonuclear cells in the ly6g + fraction ( not shown ) .
quantitative rt - pcr rna was extracted from bmdcs , lung fibroblasts , and raw 264.7 cells at the indicated time points after virus infection using trizol ( invitrogen life technologies ) or the high pure rna isolation kits ( roche ) .
rna was measured and equivalent amounts of rna from each sample ( 0.5 - 1.0 microg ) were reverse transcribed using the high capacity rna - to cdna kit ( applied biosystems ) .
cdna was diluted to a concentration of 10 microg / microl min distilled water , and pcr reactions were performed in triplicate using specific primers and the power sybr ( r ) green pcr master mixture ( applied biosystems ) .
normalization was conducted based on levels of alpha - tubulin and rps11 .

results g - csf produced during infection with sev or influenza virus promotes host survival and viral clearance as reported earlier [ 2 ] , high levels of g - csf can be detected in the lung and serum of mice infected with influenza or sev ( figure 1a ) .
to assess the role of g - csf during respiratory virus infection , mixed background g - csf +/+ and g - csf - / - mice were infected with mouse adapted influenza virus or with sev .
g - csf +/+ and g - csf - / - infected mice lost weight at a similar rate after infection regardless of the virus ( figure 1b ) ; strikingly , in the absence of g - csf all mice succumbed to the infection between days 7 and 10 after infection ( figure 1c ) .
these data highlight an essential role for g - csf in protecting the host from death during infection with normally non - lethal respiratory viruses .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0037334.g001 figure 1 vital role for g - csf produced in the lung of infected mice .

nd : non - detected , nm : non - measured .
asterisks indicate p values .
data presented is representative of more than two independent experiments .
to further characterize the protective role of g - csf during respiratory viral infection , we focused on infections with sev , a natural mouse pathogen .
to define whether g - csf affects viral load , we compared viral titers in the lungs of infected g - csf +/+ and g - csf - / - mice .
sev replicated equally well in the lungs of g - csf +/+ and g - csf - / - mice in the days that follow infection .
however , while g - csf +/+ mice cleared sev by day eight - post infection , virus was still found in the lungs of g - csf - / - at this time point ( figure 1d ) .
administration of daily doses of recombinant human g - csf ( rhg - csf ) throughout the course of infection improved the ability of g - csf - / - mice to control virus replication ( figure 1e ) , confirming an essential role of g - csf for efficient viral clearance .
g - csf deficient mice show increased production of pro - inflammatory molecules in the lung during infection to determine whether the lung anti - viral response was altered in g - csf - / - mice , we profiled the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines in the lungs at different times after infection with sev ( figures 2a ) .
g - csf - / - mice showed higher levels of pro - inflammatory molecules including cytokines ( il - 6 , tnf , ifngamma ) and chemokines ( ccl2 , cxcl1 , ccl5 ) compared with control mice .
the differences in pro - inflammatory molecules were most evident at day 8 post - infection correlating with the sustained presence of virus in g - csf - / - mice at this time point ( figure 1d ) .
remarkably , in contrast to all other cytokines analyzed , the mrna and protein levels of il - 1beta were significantly reduced in g - csf - / - mice at day 5 post - infection ( figure 2b and data not shown ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0037334.g002 figure 2 g - csf regulates the lung inflammatory response during virus infection .
( a - b ) cytokine secretion in the lungs of g - csf - / - and g - csf +/+ mice infected with sev was measured by multiplex elisa ( n = 4 ) .
g - csf deficient mice develop adaptive immune responses against the virus we next evaluated the effect of g - csf on the development of adaptive immunity against the virus .
g - csf deficient mice generated sev specific antibodies , although anti - viral antibodies of the igg2b isotype were significantly reduced ( figure 3a ) .
the absence of g - csf did not affect the development of effector cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctls ) as evidenced by efficient killing of specific target cells in vivo ( figure 3b ) .
to evaluate whether g - csf deficient mice developed protective cellular immunity , we utilized a well - characterized model of heterosubtypic infection with influenza virus [ 18 ] .
g - csf - / - mice infected with a sub - lethal dose of influenza strain x31 ( h3n2 ) were protected against challenge with a normally lethal dose of the heterosubtypic influenza strain pr8 ( h1n1 ) ( figure 3c ) that is not susceptible to neutralization by anti - x31 antibodies .
these data indicate that the presence of g - csf determines the quality of the initial inflammatory response to respiratory viruses but has minimal effects on the development of anti - viral adaptive immune responses .

( b ) mock and sev infected g - csf +/+ or g - csf - / - mice were injected i.v. 7 days after infection with cfse - labeled peptide - pulsed splenocytes .
splenocytes labeled with a high dose of cfse were pulsed with sev np peptide and those labeled with a low dose of cfse were pulsed with the irrelevant influenza virus ( pr8 ) np peptide .
empty histograms show cfse staining on mock - infected animals 24 h after injection of labeled / pulsed splenocytes .
filled histograms correspond to cfse staining on sev infected mice 24 h after injection of labeled / pulsed splenocytes ( n = 4 per group ) .

( c ) survival of g - csf +/+ and g - csf - / - mice infected with a sublethal dose of influenza virus x31 or mock treated and challenged at day 19 with a normally lethal dose of influenza virus pr8 .
survival was monitored daily ( n = 14 / 16 mice in x31 challenged groups , n = 5 in mock treated controls ) .
experiment shown is representative of two independent experiments .
g - csf deficient mice show reduced cellular infiltrate and tissue damage during infection we next analyzed the composition of the lung cellular infiltrate during infection .
the numbers of infiltrating monocytes and plasmacytoid dcs in the lung of mock and infected mice were not significantly different in the absence or presence of g - csf ( figures 4a ) .
nk cells were transiently reduced in the lung of g - csf - / - mice at early times after infection but this trend did not reach statistical significance .
notably , cd8 + t cells were elevated on day 8 after infection in g - csf - / - mice , possibly in response to higher virus titers compared to controls at this time point .
as expected [ 9 ] , mock - infected g - csf - / - mice had lower levels of ly6g + granulocytes in the bm , blood , and lung compared to g - csf +/+ mice .
despite an increase in the number of granulocytes in the lung during infection with sev , these cells were significantly lower in the lung of g - csf - / - mice compared to controls at all time points analyzed ( figures 4a and b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0037334.g004 figure 4 g - csf regulates the cellular infiltrate during virus infection .
( a ) cell numbers in the lungs of sev infected mice calculated at the indicated time points from total cell counts and flow cytometry analysis .
populations were identified with the following markers : neutrophils ( cd11b + ly6c + ly6g +) , monocytes ( cd11b + ly6c + ly6g - ) , pdcs ( cd11b - b220 + mpdca +) , cd4 + t cells ( cd3 + cd4 + cd8 - ) , cd8 + t cells ( cd3 + cd8 + cd4 - ) , and nk cells ( cd11b + nk1.1 +) .

pre - gated on pi - cd45 + cd11b + cells .
results are representative of more than two independent experiments .
reduced cellular infiltration to the lung of g - csf - / - mice was also apparent in the analysis of the bal of infected mice .
total lymphocytes ( tlc ) in the bal were significantly reduced in infected g - csf - / - and g - csf +/ - mice compared to infected g - csf +/+ controls ( figure 5a ) .
histological analysis of the lung showed marked peribronchiolar and alveolar infiltration of cells post - infection in wt mice , which was significantly attenuated in similarly infected g - csf - / - mice ( figure 5b ) .
however , 25 - 30 % higher levels of total protein were observed in bal of g - csf - / - mice after infection ( 963 microg / ml in wt vs. 1207 microg / ml in g - csf - / - mice ; data not shown ) , suggesting partial loss of bronchoalveolar - epithelial integrity in mice deficient in g - csf .
importantly , the experiments in figure 5 were performed in g - csf - / - mice backcrossed to the c57bl / 6 background , demonstrating that the protective phenotype observed in mice with mixed genetic background is maintained in the more resistant c57bl / 6 mouse strain .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0037334.g005 figure 5 g - csf deficiency reduces lung infiltrate during virus infection .

( b ) representative pictures of h & e - stained lung sections from naive and sev infected g - csf +/+ and g - csf - / - c57bl / 6 mice .
reduced numbers of activated ly6g + granulocytes are present in the lungs of g - csf deficient mice to evaluate the effect of g - csf in the activation status of ly6g + granulocytes during virus infection , we analyzed the expression of genes associated with neutrophil activation in ly6g + granulocytes of g - csf - / - , g - csf +/ - , and g - csf +/+ mice 4 days after infection .
to avoid potential confounding effects of direct virus infection of granulocytes in the lung , we analyzed granulocytes residing in the distal bone marrow of the infected mice , as we have shown that these cells respond to cytokines produced by the lung during infection [ 2 ] .
as shown in figure 6a , g - csf induced the expression of a number of genes associated with neutrophil activation ( elastase , ela - 2 ; myeloperoxidase , mpo and c / ebpbeta ) in bone marrow ly6g + cells of wt mice .
unexpectedly , the regulatory cytokine il - 10 was also expressed at high levels in ly6g + cells from infected wt mice .
expression of all these genes was severely impaired in ly6g + cells from g - csf - / - and g - csf +/ - mice , suggesting a critical role of g - csf in generating a functionally active population of ly6g + granulocytes during virus infection .
expression of the unrelated chemokine ccl5 was not different in wt and g - csf - / - suggesting that the hyporesponsiveness in sev - infected ly6g + cells is restricted to granulocyte - specific genes .

( c ) representative flow cytometry analysis of neutrophils ( cd11b + ly6cint ) and monocytes ( cd11b + ly6chi ) in the blood of mice injected with a single dose of anti - ly6g antibody ( 1a8 ) or an isotype control .
neutrophil depleted wt c57bl6 mice were infected with sev and monitored for ( d ) weight loss ( p > 0.9 two way anova for infected groups ) and ( e ) survival ( n = 10 for isotype treated , sev infected and n = 20 for ly6g depleted and sev infected. logrank test , p < 0.0001 ) .
experiments shown are representative of two or three independent experiments .
we next examined whether the phagocytic ability of neutrophils recruited to the lung during infection was altered in g - csf - / - mice .
to test this , g - csf - / - and g - csf +/+ mice were infected with sev and four days later fluorescently labeled latex beads were administered intranasally [ 19 ] .
we measured the efficiency of bead phagocytosis by granulocytes using flow cytometry .
figure 6b shows that despite a severe reduction in the number of phagocytic granulocytes in the lung of g - csf - / - mice , there is an equal percentage of bead positive cells within granulocytic populations of g - csf - / - and g - csf +/+ mice .
these data indicate that the virus - activated phagocytic ability of granulocytes is unaffected by the presence or absence of g - csf , although the number of activated phagocytic cells present in the lung of g - csf - / - mice is significantly reduced .
to test whether a reduction of the number of granulocytes recapitulates the enhanced pathology observed in the absence of g - csf , we used an anti - ly6g antibody to deplete ly6g + cells from wt mice [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
granulocyte counts were reduced by 70 % in the blood of wt mice twenty - four hours after a single dose of anti - ly6g antibody ( figure 6c ) mimicking the percent reduction of granulocytes in the blood of g - csf - / - mice compared to wt controls ( figure 4b ) .
similar to g - csf - / - mice , depletion of ly6g + cells from wt mice resulted in a weight loss comparable to that of control mice ( figure 6d ) , but also resulted in enhanced mortality post - infection ( figure 6e ) .
together with the observed dramatic reduction in the expression of functional genes , these data suggest a critical role for activated ly6g + granulocytes in the g - csf - mediated protection from death during respiratory viral infections .
discussion we have shown that the absence of g - csf results in decreased survival of the host during a respiratory tract viral infection ( figure 1 ) independently of the generation of cellular and humoral adaptive immunity ( figure 3 ) .
g - csf regulates mobilization of granulocytes , hematopoietic stem cells , and other myeloid cells from the bm [ 5 ] , [ 22 ] and plays a critical role in the activation of neutrophils that control bacterial and fungal infections [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
in the present work we demonstrated that g - csf regulates the outcome of respiratory viral infections by stimulating the mobilization and recruitment of large numbers of activated granulocytes to the infected lung , thereby promoting viral clearance and eliciting a distinct survival advantage .
neutrophils have been shown to control lung pathology through the release of suppressor cytokines such as il - 10 [ 23 ] and it is possible that this granulocyte subset contributes to host survival during virus infection by suppressing the cytokine storm induced in the lung in response to infection .
our data show that ly6g + granulocytes in the bone marrow of infected wt mice express high levels of il - 10 in response to pro - inflammatory signals .
this response is abrogated in the absence of g - csf , suggesting a possible mechanism for the g - csf - dependent suppressor activity .
using an antibody - mediated neutrophil depletion model , a series of recent reports have suggested a role for neutrophils during infection with influenza virus [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
g - csf - deficient mice provide a complementary method for the reduction of functional granulocytes , confirming a critical role for these cells in controlling lung pathology during infection with normally non - lethal respiratory viruses .
interestingly , the effect of neutrophils in lung pathology is influenced by the virus strain used ( 23 ) , suggesting that additional factors contribute to the overall effect of granulocyte - mediated protection against viral infection .
currently , g - csf is used in the clinic for the treatment of bm transplant recipients to aid in their recovery and to protect them from bacterial infections .
it may be beneficial to take a closer look at individuals that suffer from severe virus infections and examine the status of their neutrophil population. is possible that during certain infections , or under specific health conditions , g - csf treatment may promote quick virus clearance and recovery from infection .

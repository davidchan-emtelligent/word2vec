introduction the population migration algorithm ( pma ) was proposed by zhou et al in 2003 [ 1 ] - [ 2 ] .
the pma is a simulated population migration theory global optimization algorithm .
the pma is also a simulated mechanism that involves population along with economic center transfer and population pressure diffusion in the field .
in other words , people relocate to a preferential region that has a high level of economic development and employment opportunities .
when the preferential region has relative overpopulation , the population pressure constantly increases .
when population pressure exceeds a certain limit , people will move to a more suitable preferential region .
population pressure makes the pma engage in a better regional search .
to a certain extent , population proliferation can prevent the pma from falling into a local optimal solution .
the whole algorithm shows alternate features that localized search and scatter search have in the search process .
in 2004 , xu gave an improved pma ( ipma ) , which can be summarized into three forms : population flow , population migration , and population proliferation [ 3 ] .
population flow states that the population residing in the region is spontaneous and the overall flow is uncertain .
population migration is based on the mechanism across a wide range of the selection movement , in which people flow to the rich place .
when the population pressure is very high , population proliferation is a selective movement from a preferential area to a no preferential area .
it also reflects the people 's pioneering spirit .
recent , various kinds of intelligent algorithms have been improved by many researchers .
wang et al improved the pma with the steepest descent operator and the gauss mutation [ 4 ] .
ouyang et al introduced the simplex in the pma to improve the search performance of the algorithm [ 5 ] .
guo et al increased performance of the population migration by improving the migrations' efficiency [ 6 ] .
karaboga improved the bee swarm [ 7 ] .
li et al introduced extremal optimization to improve the performance of the shuffled frog leaping algorithm ( sfla ) [ 8 ] .
however , the results of all these studies show low accuracy or fall into the local optimal solution .
to further improve the local search ability of the pma and speed up convergence , we introduce a local search mechanism of frog leaping and crossover .
this paper is improved and uses a number of classic functions for the simulation to show that the algorithm is effective and feasible .
population migration algorithm consider the following unconstrained single - objective optimization problem : ( 1 ) in which is a real valued mapping , is a search space , . we assume that problem ( 1 ) has a constant solution , namely , global optimal solution exists and the set h of the global optimal solution is not empty .
seeking the most value problem can be transformed into the form of problem ( 1 ) .
in the algorithm , is an individual and stands for the population and various kinds of information. is the ith individual in the solution space , ; is the ith individual of the jth weight ; , is the jth weight of the ith region 's radius , in which , , , ; and n stands for population size .
target function f ( x ) corresponds to the population attraction .
the optimal solution ( a local optimal solution ) of problem ( 1 ) corresponds to the most attractive region ( the preferential ) .
the ability of the pma to escape from the local optimal solution corresponds to the ability .
due to population pressure increase , the population moves out of the preferential area .
the rise of algorithm or mountain climbing made the populations move into the preferential area .
local random search of algorithm corresponds to the population flow .
the method by which the algorithm selects the approximate solution corresponds to the population migration .
escaping from the local optimal strategies corresponds to the population proliferation .
frog leaping algorithm of local search sfla is proposed , as proved by eusuff in 2003 [ 9 ] .
sfla is based on the heuristic and collaborative search of species .
the implementation of the algorithm simulates the element evolution behavior of nature .
the implementation process of sfla simulates the feeding behavior of a group of frogs in a wetland [ 10 ] .
in the feeding process , every frog can be seen as the carrier of ideas and information .
frogs can communicate through the exchange of information , which can improve the knowledge of others .
every frog represents a solution to the optimization problem ( 1 ) .
wetland represents the solution space .
in the algorithm implemental stage , there are f frogs divided into n groups .
each group has l frogs .
different groups have different ideas and information .
in a group , frogs follow the element evolution strategy in the solution space for local depth search and internal communication .
( 2 ) ( 3 ) in the above formulas , rand () is a random function that randomly generates the value in the range [ 0,1 ] , s is a step of the frog leaping , pwi stands for the worst frog of the ith group , pbi stands for the best frog of the ith group , and p1wi stands for an update of the worst frog of the ith group .
if the adaptive value of the updated worst frog is more than that of the original worst frog in the same group , the updated worst frog will replace the original worst frog .
otherwise , a frog will be randomly generated in the group instead of the original worst frog .
the updated process is repeated until the predetermined number of local search ls. when all groups have completed the depth of local search , all the frogs of the groups are again mixed and divided into n groups .
we continue the local search in the groups until the termination rule holds true , and then we stop .
crossover operators by two leaner combinations , we can obtain two new individuals .
arithmetic crossover operation is often used to express individuals by floating individual coding .
hypothesis : the two parents are and . then , n random numbers are randomly generated , in which , . after hybrid implementation , two new progenies are generated : methods in the pma , the population flow includes extensive information exchange .
in practice , population information exchange decides the direction of the migration under certain conditions , so we should give full attention to population flow .
when under pressure , population migration is the random population flow in the range of the population pressure , which does not have a significant role in further improving the algorithm .
the local search mechanism of frog - leaping algorithm and the crossover operator are introduced into the pma in the process of population flow , which can well improve the original search results .
impa organically made the frog - leaping combine with the crossover operator in the pma .
the process of the algorithm is as follows : initialization input the population size n , the initial radius delta ( 0 ) , the vigilance parameter of population pressure alpha ( 0 ) , the number of the population flow l , the number of local search ls , and the maximum number of iterations t. we randomly generate n individuals in the search space s , x 1 , x 2 , ... , xn. the ith regional center determines the upper and lower bounds of the ith region , in which , , . the extraction method makes equal , so we cancel the superscript of in the following steps .
we obtain an initial search space , which stands for the initial residential area .
the set is taken as the sphere , in which x is the center and r is the radium .
the following variables appearing that way are the same. and . we set iteration counter t = 0 .
evolutionary preparation : population flow : in every , we randomly generate li individuals , so we can obtain the group in , which has nl individuals .
population migration we next introduce the local search mechanism of frog - leaping algorithm and crossover operator .
at this time , the role of population has been transformed to the frog .
the search area is seen as the frog 's wetland .
the formed n local areas are seen as the n groups .
the individual of every local area is seen as the frog .
( a ) we choose n best frogs in y ( t ) , which form the intermediate frog group . ( b ) forming n regions : . ( c ) in every group , we produce a frog body flow .
in other words , li individuals are randomly generated in . li and the adaptive value of are proportional .
( d ) we set the group counter in = 1 , which is compared with the total of groups n ; the local evolution counter im = 1 , which is compared with the number of local search ls .
( e ) in the inth group , we calculate the adaptive value of every frog in the group and arrange them in descending order .
we can obtain the best solution pbi and the worst solution pwi .
( f ) phwi = pwi , according to the following four formulas , we can update and improve the position of the worst frog in the group .
( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( g ) if step ( f ) improved the position of the worst frog , the adaptive value of is more than the pwi 's , the position of pwi will be replaced by the position of . that is , . otherwise , we randomly generate a position of a frog instead of the worst frog in the group .
( h ) if im < ls , then im = im + 1and turn to step ( f ) .
otherwise , we report the best frog and turn to step ( i ) .
( i ) if in < n , then in = in + 1 and we turn to step ( e ) .
otherwise , we turn to step ( j ) .
( j ) contraction of preferential region : .
( k ) if ( not more than the population pressure alert ) , we continue the frog flow and turn to step ( c ) otherwise , we turn to step ( l ) .
( l ) we report n the best frogs : .
population proliferation : ( a ) we keep the best individual in the , which is credited as . ( b ) in the , we randomly sample n - 1 new individuals instead of the n - 1 individuals of . ( c ) we define a new generation of population termination of inspection if the new generation of population x ( t + 1 ) contains the eligible solution , we stop and output the best solution in x ( t + 1 ) .
otherwise , we narrow and properly and set t : t + 1 .
if the maximum numbers of iterations for the algorithm are not met , we turn to the second step .
convergence analysis this paper uses the axiom model to analyze and prove the convergence of impa .
definition 1 optimization variables x have limited - length characters and have the form . n is called the code string length of x , a is called the code of x , and x is called the decode of the character a. ai is considered a genetic gene .
all possible values of ai are called allelic gene .
a is a chromosome made up of n genes [ 11 ] .
definition 2 ( individual space ) is an allelic gene .
n is given the code string length .
the set is called individual , in which is a natural number and is the order of population space [ 11 ] .
definition 3 ( satisfaction set ) if , then . b ( x ) is called the satisfaction set .
the number of individuals in the set b ( x ) is used for . is any of the population and is the best individual in the set . the satisfaction set induced by is called satisfaction set of the population , which is marked . all of the satisfaction sets' intersections are formed with the global optimal solution [ 11 ] .
definition 4 ( selection operator ) the selection operator is a random mapping , . it meets the following two conditions .
( 1 ) for , we can obtain , in which stands for the individual in the ; ( 2 ) any population that meets has . the first condition states that selected individuals should be in the selected population .
the second condition states that the selection operator may increase the number of optimal individuals in the population , in addition to variations of the individuals' numbers between selected population and original population [ 11 ] .
definition 5 ( reproduction operator ) reproduction operator is a random mapping. .
if any population , which meets , the new population which becomes under the action of the operator , may contain more satisfied individuals than the original population [ 11 ] .
definition 6 ( mutation operator ) mutation operator is a random mapping : . meets .
mutation operator is the reproduction operator that has a much better nature .
if the population contains satisfied individuals , then after mutation , the population should contain satisfied individuals .
if the population does not have satisfied individuals , then after mutation , the population may contain satisfied individuals [ 11 ] .
in improved population migration , extended operator meets the following expressions : and therefore , we can use the operator to stand for the process of population flow .
the selection operator s 1 stands for the process of step ( a ) in population migration , where we chose n , the best individuals from population y ( t ) .
the reproduction operator r 1 stands for the progress from step ( b ) to the process of final output zbest ( t ) in step ( l ) .
the reproduction operator r 2stands for the process from population proliferation to finally generate x ( t + 1 ) .
therefore , the ipma can be expressed as : ( 8 ) ( 9 ) after both sides have the same function of operator for ( 8 ) , we can find that . the general simulated evolution algorithm can be composed of a series of selection operators and reproduction operators to be represented abstractly as follows : . lemma 1 in the ipma,s is a selection operator and r is a reproduction operator .
the proof can be obtained from reference [ 11 ] .
theorem 1 the ipma is a simulated evolutionary algorithm .
lemma 2 in the ipma , the characteristic number of the preferred selection operator , the selection pressure of the operator s : ps = 1 , the selection intensity alphas = 1 .
the ipma just takes the preferred selection operator .
according to reference [ 3 ] , the selection pressure and the selection intensity are defined to calculate the characteristic number of the operator s. the proof can be obtained from reference [ 11 ] .
lemma 3 in the ipma , the characteristic number of the reproduction operator , the operator , then the absorption and scattering rate of the reproduction meet the following estimates : . where , ( is the radius of the search space ) is the radius of the set of optimal solution and is a conversion coefficient .
if the set includes a division region in the , then ; otherwise , is the rate of volume of the intersection of the set and a division region .
thus , we can obtain . the proof can be obtained from reference [ 11 ] .
lemma 4 if the abstract simulated evolutionary algorithm ( sea ) satisfies the following conditions : ( 1 ) the pressure of selection operator is uniformly bounded ; ( 2 ) the absorption of reproduction operator : meets ; ( 3 ) the strength of selection , absorption , and scattering content are as follows : . then , an abstract and a general sea will probably weakly approach the optimal solution set .
the proof can be obtained from reference [ 11 ] .
theorem 2 ( convergence of ipma ) if the ipma adopts the selection operator family , which comprise all the preferred selection operators , reproduction operators family , in which . the following conditions are thus met : ( 1 ) ; ( 2 ) () .
then , to prove that the ipma will probably weakly approach the solution set , the following steps are performed .
proving known by lemma 2 : , ; known by lemma 3 : , ; when is given , is also given. by condition ( 1 ) , we obtain . by condition ( 2 ) , we obtain , then . we have and lemma 3 , then . we know the divergence of the harmonic series , so . according to lemma 3 : . according to lemma 2 : , so . the three conditions of lemma 3 are met .
the ipma probably weakly approaches the global optimal solution .
results and discussion simulation examples and experimental parameter setting to verify the performance of the ipma , this paper performs an experiment .
the ipma is compared with the basic population algorithm and other improved algorithms .
in the simulation experiment , we choose 10 classic test functions to test the algorithm .
according to the performance of the functions , they are divided into a single minimum ( single ) and a number of local minima ( multimodal ) into two categories .

the function f 1 is a unimodal function used to examine the accuracy of the algorithm .
the function f 2 which contains infinite local optimal solution and has infinite local maximum near suboptimal solution , is a strong shock multimodal function .
general optimization algorithms easily fall into local optimal solution .
thus , the ability of the algorithm is used to avoid falling into a local optimization algorithm .

.
experimental result and analysis in table 2 , the data of function f 1 show that the improved population algorithm is better than frog - leaping algorithm in terms of precision .
other algorithms find it very difficult to achieve the optimal solution of function f 2 , but the ipma can easily do so , which indicates that the algorithm 's ability of escaping from local optimal solution is very ideal .
function f 8 can test whether the algorithm 's ability of global optimization is good .
it is used to measure the efficiency of the algorithm , so we know the efficiency of the ipma is very high compared with other algorithms from the data of function f 8.the data functions f 3 , f 4 , f 5 , f 7 , f 9 and f 10 reflect that the ipma is a better algorithm from a certain angle. through cooperation of the best value , the worst value , the average value , the variance , and the convergence rate , the ipma is found to be better than the other algorithms in the calculation of stability and precision .

conclusions in this paper , based on the local search mechanism and crossover operator , we put forward an ipma .
the parameters of the ipma are simple and easy to realize. by testing the 10 functions , we find that the ipma is better than the basic pma and is superior to many intelligent algorithms .
the pma is good at global searches , but it does not perform well in local search and its precision is low .
we introduce local search in population and crossover operator to improve these deficits .
therefore , the ipma is increased to avoid falling into local optimum capacity ; its calculation speed and precision are also improved .

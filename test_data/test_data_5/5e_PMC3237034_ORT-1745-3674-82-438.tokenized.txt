background and purpose fast - track surgery has reduced the length of hospital stay ( los ) , morbidity , and convalescence in primary hip and knee arthroplasty ( tka ) .
we assessed whether patients undergoing revision tka for non - septic indications might also benefit from fast - track surgery .
methods 29 patients were operated with 30 revision arthroplasties .
median age was 67 ( 34 - 84 ) years .
all patients followed a standardized fast - track set - up designed for primary tka .
we determined the outcome regarding los , morbidity , mortality , and satisfaction .
results median los was 2 ( 1 - 4 ) days excluding 1 patient , who was transferred to another hospital for logistical reasons ( 10 days ) .
none of the patients died within 3 months , and 3 patients were re - admitted ( 2 for suspicion of dvt , which was not found , and 1 for joint mobilization ) .
patient satisfaction was high .
interpretation patients undergoing revision tka for non - septic reasons may be included in fast - track protocols .
outcome appears to be similar to that of primary tka regarding los , morbidity , and satisfaction .
our findings call for larger confirmatory studies and studies involving other indications ( revision tha , 1 - stage septic revisions ) .
for more than a decade , favorable outcomes following fast - track protocols rather than more conventional hospital stays have been reported from numerous studies on primary tha and tka .
in the last few years , outcomes have been further improved , mainly due to improved multimodal opioid - sparing analgesia and early mobilization , allowing patients to fulfill functional discharge criteria within 2 - 3 days ( husted et al. 2008 , 2010 a,b,c,d , larsen et al. 2008 a,b,c , 2009 , andersen et al. 2009 , barbieri et al. 2009 , rotter et al. 2010 ) .
the addition of local infiltration analgesia ( lia ) has improved early analgesia and facilitated early recovery , allowing patients to ambulate with full weight bearing within 2 - 3 hours of surgery ( andersen et al. 2008 a,b , 2009 , holm et al. 2010 ) .
so far , however , no one has reported the potential benefits of the fast - track methodology ( including multimodal opioid - sparing analgesia , perioperative lia , and early mobilization ) for revision tka , with its more extensive surgical trauma leading to a corresponding increase in the surgical stress responses .
we therefore investigated the feasibility of our well - documented fast - track primary tka program on a consecutive cohort of revision tka patients .
patients and methods from january 1 , 2008 until june 1 , 2010 , we prospectively included all patients who presented consecutively with prior tka that required revision of both femoral and tibial prosthetic components due to aseptic loosening , wear , mechanical instability , or malposition of components .
exclusion criteria were revision surgery due to infection , simple exchange of polyethylene , and secondary operation with a patella component .
29 patients ( 16 women ) were operated with 30 revision arthroplasties ( 4 rotating hinge prostheses ( rhk ) and 26 total condylar revision knee type prostheses ( lcck ) , 1 patient with bilateral simultaneous revision ; all zimmer , warsaw , in ) .
median age was 67 ( 34 - 84 ) years .
all patients were asa i ( n = 9 ) , ii ( n = 17 ) , or iii ( n = 3 ) .
the operations were due to aseptic loosening , all on the tibial side ( 11 ) , wear and mechanical instabilities ( 16 ) , or malposition of components ( 3 ) .
all patients were operated under spinal anesthesia with 3 ml 0.5 % ( 15 mg ) plain bupivacaine administered via the l2 / l3 or l3 / l4 vertebral interspace .
additional propofol was administered ( 0.5 - 5 mg / kg / h ) for sedation if required .
for thromboprophylaxis , orally administered xarelto ( 10 mg ) was administered once daily until discharge , starting 6 - 8 h postoperatively .
no extended prophylaxis was given , and also no mechanical devices were used ( including compression stockings ) .
no attempt was made to identify patients at high risk of dvt , as all patients received the same regime .
a standardized intraoperative regime for fluid administration was used , consisting of 0.9 % saline ( 5 ml / kg / h ) and colloid ( voluven ; 7.5 ml / kg / h ) .
also , a standardized program in the operating theater was followed , including use of tranexamic acid ( 1 g ) .
drains were not used .
patients were operated with insertion of a tricompartmental cemented revision prosthesis with proximal and distal uncemented stems , lcck or rhk ( zimmer , warsaw , in ) using a standard ( extended if necessary ) midline skin incision and a medial parapatellar approach ( no quadriceps snips , turndowns , or tibial tubercle osteotomies were necessary ) .
no femoral tourniquet was used .
implants were removed by using osteotomes , loosening the implants with as little sacrifice of bone as possible ( the femur first , then the tibia ) .
the lia technique has been described in earlier studies ( andersen et al. 2008 a,b , kerr and kohan 2008 ) .
patients received infiltration with 300 mg ropivacaine ( 0.2 %) and epinephrine ( 10 mg / ml ) in a total volume of 150 ml. the mixture was injected using a systematic technique ensuring uniform delivery of the local anesthetic to all tissues incised , handled , or instrumented during the procedure .
the first 50 ml was injected into the posterior joint capsule and into both collateral ligaments ( if present and functioning ) after the prosthesis had been removed and new bone cuts had been performed .
after insertion of the prosthesis , another 50 ml was injected along the borders of - - and into - - the capsule and cut quadriceps tendon , infra - patellar ligament , possible remnants of fat pad , and soft tissues surrounding the joint .
the final 50 ml was used to infiltrate the subcutaneous tissues before wound closure .
to minimize the risk of cutaneous blister formation , the subcutaneous injections did not contain epinephrine .
after wound closure , a compression bandage was applied firmly from the toes to the mid - thigh , consisting of an inner double layer of soft padding surrounded by an overlapping layer of acrylastic ( elastic adhesive bandage ) ( andersen et al. 2008 a ) .
the knee was equipped with an ice pack .
the compression bandage and ice pack were removed the following morning .
postoperatively , the patients were transferred to the post - anesthesia care unit ( pacu ) and then to a specialized knee and hip arthroplasty unit with a well - defined and implemented multimodal fast - track rehabilitation regime ( husted et al. 2008 ) .
multimodal , orally administered opioid - sparing analgesia ( nsaid , acetaminophen , gabapentin , and opioid upon request only ) was given to all patients : celecoxib ( 200 mg every 12 hours ) , acetaminophen ( slow release ; 2 g every 12 hours ) , gabapentin ( 300 mg morning and 600 mg evening ) , all of which were initiated 2 - 3 hours preoperatively .
patients left the pacu after a few hours , and attempted to ambulate upon arrival at the ward .
physiotherapy was started on the first postoperative day ( after 24 hours ) and took place once or twice daily until discharge .
routine exercises were performed - - focusing on regaining function , motion , and gait with crutches .
los was counted as the number of postoperative nights in hospital until discharge .
strictly functional discharge criteria were applied ( independent in personal care , able to walk > 70 m with crutches , able to get in and out of bed and into and up from a chair , and sufficient oral pain treatment ( vas < 5 on activity , and acceptance of discharge )) .
all patients were discharged directly to their homes .
the following outcome parameters were registered during hospitalization : los , duration of surgery , perioperative ( anesthetic and surgical ) complications , blood transfusions , and patient satisfaction - - measured on a verbal analog scale ( 0 - 10 ; 10 = best ) .
the patients were asked about their satisfaction with 13 parameters during their stay , including " satisfaction with los " and " satisfaction with the entire stay " ( husted et al. 2008 and 2010 b ) .
a standard transfusion protocol was followed .
the transfusion trigger was a drop in hemoglobin of at least 25 % of the preoperative value and clinical symptoms of anemia .
all complications , re - admissions , or deaths within 90 days of the index arthroplasty operation were registered .
the study did not require approval by the ethics committee and was not registered with clinicaltrials.gov under the us national library of medicine , as it was considered a quality control study .
results median surgical time was 93 ( 60 - 168 ) minutes .
one anesthesia - related complication occurred ( development of temporary second - grade av block ) .
8 patients required blood transfusion ( 2 - 6 units ) .
7 patients had cortical cracks / fractures at the distal point of the tibial stem , and 1 patient had fracture lines at both stem ends - - occurring as undetected perioperative surgical complications .
at 3 - month follow - up , none of the patients had progression of the fracture or complained of pain at the stem ends .
median los was 2 ( 1 - 4 ) days but this excludes 1 patient , who was transferred to another hospital for logistical reasons ( 10 days ) .
within 3 months , no deaths had occurred but 3 patients were re - admitted ( 2 for suspicion of dvt , which was not found , and 1 for mobilization of the knee ) .
patient satisfaction was high , median 10 ( 8 - 10 ) , regarding both los and the entire stay .
discussion this study shows that it is feasible to include revision tka for non - septic reasons in a fast - track set - up and to expect an outcome similar to that of primary tka , with low morbidity , short los , and a high degree of patient satisfaction ( husted et al. 2008 , 2010 , d ) .
this is to be expected , as fast - track surgery consists of a combination of optimized logistics and evidence - based clinical features , thereby providing the best - documented treatment available - - the " right track " ( kehlet and soballe 2010 ) .
this fast - track set - up has optimized logistical and evidence - based clinical features and was first implemented in 2003 ( husted et al. 2008 ) .
since then , all patients operated with tha and tka , including bilateral simultaneous procedures , have been enrolled in the program .
we have concentrated on pain treatment and early mobilization , and current research is helping to refine these tools for improvement of convalescence , thereby reducing los ( andersen et al. 2008 a,b and 2009 , holm et al. 2010 ) .
lia was introduced in 2006 , and has been a part of our standard fast - track protocol for primary tha and tka ever since - - and from 2008 , also for revision knee arthroplasty .
we did not perform any power calculation regarding the number of revision cases needed for meaningful comparison with primary tka , since the purpose was to determine the feasibility of using such a fast - track protocol in revision tka compared to primary tka .
also , comparison with a historical control group would be of little value , as our fast - track set - up is dynamic and several different aspects of it have changed over time - - both clinical ( anesthesia ( spinal ) , fluid protocol , pain treatment ( gabapentin , cox2 inhibitor , lia ) , timing of first mobilization , thromboprophylaxis ) and organizational ( timing of radiographs , evaluation of discharge criteria twice daily ) - - compared to the early fast - track set - up ( husted et al. 2008 ) .
even though 8 patients had cortical fracture lines from the stem ends ( indicating a press - fit that was too tight ) , all patients were mobilized within a few hours after surgery with full weight bearing .
this rather frequent perioperative complication required no treatment or protective bracing , and did not alter the early and extensive mobilization .
however , large - scale data are required to evaluate the clinical impact of this complication .
lia has been shown to facilitate early mobilization , and these revision patients were mobilized as easily and early as primary tka patients - - and with minimal or no pain for the first few hours ( andersen et al. 2008b ) .
early mobilization may play a key role in reducing the incidence of dvt , pe , and vte - related death ( husted et al. 2010d ) .
we did not encounter any of these complications ; in addition , morbidity in general was low and similar to that in our fast - track results from primary tka ( husted et al. 2010c,d ) .
obstacles to be overcome in the introduction of fast - track revision surgery are limited to convincing both patients and staff that it is possible - - and even desirable - - to follow the same evidence - based course as in primary tkas , despite orthopedic traditions that may dictate longer bed rest , less and lighter mobilization , and longer hospitalization .
fast - track revision tka may bring socioeconomic benefits for both patients and society , and call for larger confirmatory studies .
it might expand the indications for fast - track surgery in revision tha and 1 - stage septic revisions .

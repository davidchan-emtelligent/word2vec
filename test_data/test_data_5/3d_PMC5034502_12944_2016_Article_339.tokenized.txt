background proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 ( pcsk9 ) is a key regulator of serum low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol levels .
recently , pcsk9 has additionally been related to metabolic risk factors such as the levels of triglycerides , apolipoprotein b ( apob ) , insulin , and glucose , as well as body mass index .
the purpose of this study was to investigate correlations between serum levels of pcsk9 and apob - containing atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with coronary artery disease ( cad ) .
methods serum levels of pcsk9 and lipoprotein ( a ) [ lp ( a )] ; small , dense ldl ; and oxidized ldl were measured in 101 patients with cad who were not receiving lipid - lowering therapy .
results serum hetero - dimer pcsk9 levels were positively correlated with serum levels of lp ( a ) ( r = 0.195 , p = 0.05 ) ; small , dense ldl ( r = 0.336 , p = 0.0006 ) ; and oxidized ldl ( r = 0.268 , p = 0.008 ) .
multivariate regression analyses showed that serum hetero - dimer pcsk9 was a significant predictor of serum levels of lp ( a ) ( beta = 0.235 , p = 0.01 ) ; small , dense ldl ( beta = 0.143 , p = 0.03 ) ; and oxidized ldl ( beta = 0.268 , p = 0.008 ) .
conclusions serum pcsk9 levels were positively correlated with serum levels of lp ( a ) ; small , dense ldl ; and oxidized ldl in patients with cad .
this suggests that the interaction between serum pcsk9 and apob - containing lipoproteins plays a role in establishing the atherosclerotic status of patients .

keywords low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 ( pcsk9 ) lipoprotein ( a ) oxidized ldl small , dense ldl issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 ( pcsk9 ) is a key regulator of serum low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol levels [ 1 , 2 ] .
pcsk9 , which is secreted by the liver into the circulation , binds the hepatic ldl receptors ( ldlrs ) , causing their subsequent degradation [ 3 , 4 ] .
although the mechanism underlying pcsk9 - mediated degradation of ldlr is extremely complex , it bind to ldlr subsequently targeting them for intracellular destruction within the hepatocyte , resulting in an increase in ldl cholesterol levels [ 5 - 7 ] .
therefore , pcsk9 antibodies represent attractive candidates for lowering ldl cholesterol levels .
elevated levels of lipoprotein ( a ) [ lp ( a )] ; small , dense ldl ; and oxidized ldl are recognized as risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ascvd ) [ 8 - 11 ] .
the levels of both small , dense ldl and oxidized ldl may be lowered by statin therapy [ 12 , 13 ] ; however , the availability of pharmacological agents for lowering lp ( a ) levels is limited .
therefore , lp ( a ) levels represent a residual risk factor for cardiovascular events in this statin era [ 14 ] .
although monoclonal antibodies against pcsk9 have been reported to lower lp ( a ) levels [ 15 ] , the mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood .
several demographic and metabolic parameters appear to correlate with serum pcsk9 levels , including plasma ldl cholesterol , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , triglycerides , apolipoprotein b ( apob ) , insulin , glucose , smoking , and body mass index [ 16 - 18 ] .
in addition , circulating pcsk9 strongly correlates with intermediate - density lipoprotein particles , suggesting a link between pcsk9 and triglyceride - rich lipoprotein metabolism [ 19 ] .
however , to our knowledge , correlations between serum levels of pcsk9 and small , dense ldl or oxidized ldl have not been evaluated to date .
in addition , few studies concerning the association of pcsk9 with lp ( a ) have been reported .
therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate correlations between serum levels of pcsk9 and apob - containing atherogenic lipoproteins such as lp ( a ) ; small , dense ldl ; and oxidized ldl in patients with coronary artery disease ( cad ) .
methods patients and study design the present study is a post - hoc analysis of the treatment with statin on atheroma regression evaluated by intravascular ultrasound with virtual histology ( truth ) study , which was a prospective , open - labeled , randomized , multicenter trial performed at 11 japanese centers [ 20 ] .
in brief , 164 patients with angina pectoris , who were not receiving any lipid - lowering therapy , were randomly treated with either 4 mg / day of pitavastatin or 20 mg / day of pravastatin .
the patients included in the truth study were considered for the present study if an adequate serum volume , before statin treatment , was available in frozen samples from these patients ; a total of 101 patients met this inclusion criterion .
this study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and with the approval of the ethical committees of yokohama sakae kyosai hospital .
each patient enrolled in the present study provided written informed consent .
laboratory analysis serum levels of total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , hdl cholesterol , and triglycerides were measured using standard enzymatic methods ( au2700 ; beckman coulter , ca , usa ) and commercial enzymatic kits ( kyowa medex , tokyo , japan ) .
serum levels of two forms of pcsk9 , mature ( hetero - dimer ) and furin - cleaved , were measured at a central laboratory ( bml , kawagoe , japan ) using sandwich enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisas ) [ 21 ] .
it has been reported that furin - cleaved pcsk9 has no activity to regulate ldlr and serum ldl cholesterol or less activity than mature pcsk9 [ 21 ] .
serum oxidized ldl levels were measured by an enzyme immunoassay [ 22 ] .
serum lp ( a ) levels were measured by a latex agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay using the commercially available lp ( a ) - latex ( sekisui medical co. , ltd. , tokyo ) with an autoanalyzer ( jca - bm8040 ; jeol ltd. , tokyo ) .
serum small , dense ldl levels were measured by a homogeneous assay ( denka seiken co. , ltd. , tokyo ) [ 23 ] .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using statview , version 5.0 ( sas institute , cary , north carolina ) .
the results are expressed as means +/ - sd or median values ( range ) .
univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to assess the correlations between serum levels of apob - containing atherogenic lipoprotein and biochemical parameters , including nominal variables ( gender , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and smoking ) and numerical variables ( age , body mass index , total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , triglycerides , hdl cholesterol , apoa1 , apob , hetero - dimer pcsk9 , and furin - cleaved pcsk9 ) .
the variables with a p value < 0.1 on univariate analysis were entered into multivariate models .
statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
results the baseline characteristics of the subjects are listed in table 1 .
eighty - four patients were of male gender with a mean age of 67 +/ - 10 years .
forty - five of the patients were additionally diabetic .

the mean levels of ldl cholesterol and apob were 129 +/ - 31 mg / dl and 103 +/ - 24 mg / dl , respectively .
serum hetero - dimer pcsk9 levels were 145 +/ - 60 ng / ml. median levels of lp ( a ) were 16 mg / dl , and mean levels of small , dense ldl and oxidized ldl were 25.8 +/ - 13.9 mg / dl and 11.8 +/ - 8.5 u / ml , respectively .

univariate analysis indicated that total cholesterol , apob , and hetero - dimer pcsk9 levels ( fig. 1 ) positively correlated with serum levels of lp ( a ) .
multivariate regression analysis showed that serum apob and pcsk9 levels were significant positive predictors of lp ( a ) levels .
in addition , total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , triglycerides , apob , and hetero - dimer pcsk9 levels ( fig. 2 ) positively correlated with serum small , dense ldl levels .
multivariate regression analysis showed that apob and hetero - dimer pcsk9 levels were significant positive predictors of small , dense ldl levels .
moreover , univariate and multivariate analyses showed that serum hetero - dimer pcsk9 levels positively correlated with serum oxidized ldl levels ( fig. 3 ) .
therefore , weak , but significant , positive correlations were observed between serum levels of hetero - dimer pcsk9 and apob - containing lipoproteins such as lp ( a ) ; small , dense ldl ; and oxidized ldl .

a significant positive correlation was observed between serum levels of hetero - dimer pcsk9 and oxidized ldl discussion the major findings of the present study are as follows : first , serum hetero - dimer pcsk9 levels were positively correlated with serum lp ( a ) levels .
second , significant positive correlations were observed between serum levels of hetero - dimer pcsk9 and small , dense ldl or oxidized ldl .
finally , the serum hetero - dimer pcsk9 level was a significant predictor of serum levels of apob - containing atherogenic lipoproteins .
lp ( a ) is a ldl - like particle synthesized by the liver , that consists of an apob100 molecule linked to a very large glycoprotein known as the apolipoprotein ( a ) [ 8 , 24 ] .
the biological role of lp ( a ) is uncertain ; however , elevated levels of lp ( a ) have been identified as an independent risk factor for ascvd [ 8 , 9 ] .
several recent clinical trials have reported that pcsk9 antibodies represent promising novel candidate drugs for lowering the levels of both ldl cholesterol and lp ( a ) [ 25 - 27 ] .
however , the mechanism by which pcsk9 inhibitors reduce lp ( a ) levels remains unclear .
serum lp ( a ) levels in familial hypercholesterolemia with ldlr mutations have been shown to be elevated , suggesting that lp ( a ) is catabolized via the ldlr pathway [ 28 ] ; however , statins , whose main mechanism of action involves the upregulation of ldlr , are unable to reduce lp ( a ) levels effectively [ 29 ] .
in addition , tada et al. recently reported that serum lp ( a ) was elevated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia caused by pcsk9 gain - of - function mutations to the same level as that in familial hypercholesterolemia caused by ldlr mutations [ 30 ] .
this suggests that the ldlr plays an important role in lp ( a ) catabolism .
furthermore , romagnuolo et al. reported that lp ( a ) catabolism is regulated by pcsk9 via ldlr in hepg2 cells and primary human fibroblasts [ 31 ] .
however , a previous study reported that apob in lp ( a ) does not interact with ldlr , suggesting that ldlr does not play a role in lp ( a ) kinetics [ 24 ] .
in order to understand the mechanism by which pcsk9 antibodies reduce lp ( a ) levels , elucidation of the correlation between serum levels of pcsk9 and lp ( a ) is required .
a recent study by nekaies et al. reported that plasma pcsk9 levels correlated positively with lp ( a ) concentrations [ 32 ] .
however , yang et al. reported that plasma pcsk9 levels are not associated with lp ( a ) levels [ 33 ] .
therefore , the correlation between plasma pcsk9 and lp ( a ) levels remains controversial .
significant positive correlations were observed between serum levels of pcsk9 and lp ( a ) in the present study ; furthermore , serum apob levels were additionally found to be positively correlated with serum lp ( a ) levels .
our findings suggest that both pcsk9 and apob interact with lp ( a ) .
variations in terms of correlation between pcsk9 and lp ( a ) observed between patients may be attributed to differences in race , as both pcsk9 and lp ( a ) levels vary considerably by race and other factors [ 18 , 24 , 34 ] .
small , dense ldl has been proposed to enhance atherogenicity owing to its higher rate of penetration into the arterial wall , prolonged plasma half - time , and lower affinity of ldlr [ 35 ] .
numerous previous studies have examined the association of small , dense ldl with traditional cardiovascular risk factors [ 36 , 37 ] .
in agreement with these previous reports , univariate analysis performed in the present study indicated that serum small , dense ldl levels were correlated with the concentration of total cholesterol , ldl cholesterol , triglycerides , and apob .
however , multivariate regression analysis showed that apob and pcsk9 levels were significant predictors of small , dense ldl levels .
recently , kwakernaak et al. found no association between plasma pcsk9 levels and small , dense ldl in healthy subjects [ 19 ] .
however , zhang et al. reported that plasma pcsk9 levels are positively associated with plasma small , dense ldl in patients with cad ; however , this association was not observed in subjects without cad [ 38 ] .
therefore , the levels of plasma pcsk9 and small , dense ldl may be correlated in atherosclerotic patients .
although the exact mechanisms underlying the positive correlation between pcsk9 and small , dense ldl levels remain to be elucidated , pcsk9 - induced ldlr degradation , which results in lower ldlr levels , potentially affects ldl subfractions , as characterized by the increased levels of small , dense ldl .
oxidized ldl is also highly atherogenic and elevated levels of oxidized ldl recognized as a risk factor for ascvd [ 11 , 39 ] .
oxidized ldl levels have been reported to be positively correlated with pcsk9 concentration [ 40 ] .
consistent with this finding , we observed a positive correlation between serum levels of pcsk9 and oxidized ldl .
this observation may be attributed to the involvement of pcsk9 in inflammatory and oxidative processes [ 41 , 42 ] .
in addition , inhibition of pcsk9 suppresses the inflammatory response induced by oxidized ldl in macrophages [ 43 ] .
further , circulatory pcsk9 is not only present in its free form , but is additionally complexed with apob - containing lipoproteins [ 44 ] .
our findings indicate that serum pcsk9 levels positively correlated with apob - containing lipoproteins such as lp ( a ) ; small , dense ldl ; and oxidized ldl .
several recent clinical trials have reported that pcsk9 antibodies reduce lp ( a ) levels [ 25 - 27 ] .
however , there are no reports on the effects of pcsk9 antibodies on small , dense ldl or oxidized ldl .
in view of the finding that pcsk9 antibodies reduced ldl cholesterol levels and particle numbers [ 45 ] , we speculate that pcsk9 antibodies reduce small , dense ldl as well as oxidized ldl levels .
plasma pcsk9 levels have been reported to be associated with severity of cad as well as future risk of cardiovascular disease [ 46 , 47 ] .
in addition , plasma pcsk9 levels were significantly higher in patients with peripheral artery disease , especially those with extensive , severe , and complicated forms of the condition [ 40 ] , suggesting that pcsk9 functions as a proatherogenic molecule [ 48 ] .
furthermore , pcsk9 is expressed in atherosclerotic plaques [ 41 , 49 ] .
therefore , pcsk9 - targeting strategies may represent potential therapeutic options for the treatment of ascvd , whose mechanisms of action go beyond the reduction of ldl cholesterol .
the present study has several limitations in that it provides a post - hoc analysis of the results of the truth trial .
plasma pcsk9 levels have been reported to be elevated in patients with acute myocardial infarction and associated with severity of cad [ 46 , 50 ] .
in the present study , all subjects were patients with cad ; no control group was studied .
in addition , serum pcsk9 levels were measured using frozen samples .
further , we did not evaluate the ldlr and pcsk9 expression in hepatocytes .
finally , the small number of patients included in the study resulted in low statistical power .
despite these limitations , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to examine the correlations between serum levels of pcsk9 and apob - containing atherogenic lipoproteins .
a prospective study with a larger number of patients is required to confirm our conclusions .
conclusions serum pcsk9 levels were positively correlated with serum levels of lp ( a ) ; small , dense ldl ; and oxidized ldl in patients with cad .
this suggests that serum pcsk9 levels are correlated with those of apob - containing lipoproteins in atherosclerotic patients .

bundle compliance rates and survival analysis were used to illustrate improvements and gains in risk - free line - days .
methods 36 adult icus in new south wales , australia implemented aseptic insertion bundles over 18 - months .
patient bundle included 2 % alcoholic chlorhexidine preparation of insertion site , full sterile sheet drape , line position checked with x - ray and / or transducer .
physician bundle included hand hygiene , hat , mask , eyewear , sterile gloves / gown , maintain sterile technique .
the first 12 - month roll - out period was used to train all icu physicians to implement the bundles and collect data .
10,575 lines inserted were followed until discharged from icu .
clab rates and bundle compliance rates were calculated quarterly and survival analysis established the clab - free line - day period .
results the clab rate was significantly reduced from 3.0 / 1000 line - days in the first 12 - months to 1.2 / 1000 line - days in the last 6 - months ( p = 0.0006 ) .
compliance with both physician and patient bundles reduced clab ( rr 0.5 , 95 % ci 0.4 - 0.8 , p = 0.004 ) compared with non compliance while non compliance with the physician bundle increased the risk of clab ( rr 1.62 , 95 % ci 1.1 - 2.4 , p = 0.0178 ) .
the clab rate was 3.8 / 1000 ( 95 % ci 2.5 - 5.5 ) line - days in the first 12 - months and was significantly reduced by the last 6 months ( 1.6 / 1000 line - days , 95 % ci 1.0 - 2.4 ) .
clab commenced at day - 7 ( 1.8 / 1000 line days ) in the first 12 - months but did not occur until day - 9 ( 0.9 / 1000 line - days ) by the last 6 months .
conclusion clab is essentially preventable with a highly effective low cost aseptic insertion technique that enables patients to remain risk - free for the first 9 line - days .
disclosure of interest none declared .

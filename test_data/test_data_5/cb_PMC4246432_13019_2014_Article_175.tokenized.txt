background to assess the protocols of epidural analgesia versus systemic opioid - based analgesia retrospectively in 1555 thoracotomies in our thoracic centre during 2011 - 2013 .
methods pain therapy is aggressive and standardized in our thoracic centre thoughout the complete postoperative stay .
patients receive either standardized epidural analgesia with ropivacaine + sufentanil 4 - 8 mls / h ( 500 mls bag ) and are bridged when the epidural bag is finished to a standardized controlled - release oxycodone protocol with non opioid every 6 hours ( eda group ) , or patients receive immediately postoperative standardized oral analgesic protocol with controlled - released oxycodone and non opioid every 6 h ( opioid group ) .
all patients are visited daily by a pain specialist throughout the whole stay .
results data of 1555 thoracotomies from 2011 - 2013 were analysed , 838 patients in the eda group and 717 patients in the opioid group .
there was no difference with regard to sex or age between groups .
7.5 % of patients in the eda group and 13 % in the oxy group had a preexisting pain therapy ( p = 0.001 ) .
in the eda group epidural analgesia was performed for 4.6 +/ - 1.5 days .
length of hospital stay was the same in both groups ( eda : 9.9.6 +/ - 4.9 vs opioid : 9.6 +/ - 5.8 days ) .
84.7 % of patients in the eda group and 79.1 % of patients of the oxy group were dismissed with oral opioid ( p < 0.004 ) .
when patients were dismissed with opioid medication patients in the eda group were dismissed with higher oxycodone opioid doses than patients in the opioid group ( 29.5 +/ - 15.2 mg vs 26.9 +/ - 15.2 mg , p = 0.01 ) .
there was no difference with regard to dejection time between the two groups ( eda : 3.8 +/ - 2.2 days vs opioid : 3.7 +/ - 1.6 days , n.s. ) .
conclusion we first present data monitoring postoperative analgesic protocols after thoracotomies throughout the whole stay in hospital until dismission .
our retrospective data indicate that patients with epidural analgesia stay as long in hospital as patients with systemic opioid based therapy .
patients with initial epidural analgesia are dismissed with higher oxycodone opioid doses than patients with initial opioid based postoperative analgesia .
we found no difference in recovery of bowel function .
study limitations the study design is retrospectively and results might be biased .
keywords major thoracic surgery postoperative analgesia epidural analgesia oxycodone hospital stay bowel function issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background pain after thoracic surgery is supposed to be one of the most recognized pain syndrome associated with a specific procedure [ 1 ] .
to date regional anesthesia is recommended for postoperative analgesia after thoracotomy [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
besides many advantages , such as positive influence on postoperative pulmonary morbidity [ 5 ] , postoperative epidural analgesia after thoracotomy is supposed to faster postoperative recovery [ 6 ],[ 7 ] and earlier restitution of bowel function than with opioid - based systemic postoperative analgesia [ 8 ],[ 9 ] .
we recently showed that an aggressive systemic pain therapy can be very effective after anteroaxillary thoracotomy [ 10 ] and that epidural analgesia is not superior to systemic pain therapy with regard to establishing neuropathic or chronic postthoracotomy pain [ 11 ] .
pain therapy is consequent and standardized in our thoracic centre thoughout the complete postoperative stay .
patients receive either standardized epidural analgesia and are bridged when the epidural bag is finished to a standardized controlled - release oxycodone protocol , or patients receive immediately postoperative standardized oral analgesic protocol with controlled - released oxycodone and non opioid every 6 h. all patients are visited daily by a pain specialist throughout the whole stay .
the purpose of the present study was to assess the protocols of epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia retrospectively in 1555 thoracotomies during 2011 - 2013 with regard to length of postoperative hospital stay , recovery of bowel function and opioid dose on dismission from hospital .
methods after obtaining local research committee approval ( university of essen , chairperson prof. havers ) we investigated the postoperative pain therapy protocols of our thoracotomy patients during january 2011 until march 2013 .
all patients underwent thoracotomy in balanced or total intravenous anesthesia .
the serratus muscle was not cut , but spread .
at the end of surgery two 24 ch soft chest tubes were placed and the thoracic cavum was closed with three pericostal sutures .
since 2009 pain therapy is standardized in our thoracic center .
if a thoracic epidural catheter ( braun melsungenr ) is inserted , it is placed before induction of anesthesia at thoracic level 5 / 6 or 6 / 7 .
after administering the test dose of 3 mls bupivacaine 0.25 % the continuous epidural infusion is commenced at 4 - 8 mls / h ( eda group ) .
the standard epidural drug combination is ropivacaine 0.2 % + 0.75 mug / ml sufentanil ( 500 mls bag ) .
half an hour before the end of the surgical procedure all patients receive 2.5 g of iv dipyrone .
dipyrone is a non - opioid analgesic frequently used in the perioperative setting in germany .
after extubating the trachea patients without epidural catheter receive iv piritramide at the discretion of the anesthetist ( opioid group ) .
piritramide is an opioid commonly used in germany with approximately 0.7 times the potency of morphine .
patients are admitted to the intensive care unit for one night and receive 1 g of dipyrone every 6 hours and iv piritramide bolus doses when nrs ( numeric rating scale , 0 = no pain up to 10 = worst pain imaginable ) is > 3 .
if patients have epidurals , the eda is continued at 4 - 6 mls / h. if epidural analgesia is not effective , patients are switched to systemic analgesia before dismission from intensive care unit .
after discharge from the intensive care unit the systemic pain therapy patients receive controlled - release oxycodone / oxycodone with naloxone ( opioid group ) 30 - 0 - 20 mg , and from the 2nd day on ward 20 - 0 - 10 mg and iv dipyrone 1 g every 6 h. if the nrs is > 4 iv rescue medication ( iv parecoxib 40 mg ) is administered .
on the ward continuous epidural analgesia is continued with the 500 mls ropivacaine 0.2 % + 0.75 mug / ml sufentanil bag ( eda group ) and iv dipyrone 1 g every 6 h. on the second day on ward iv dipyrone 1 g is oralized to 0.5 g dipyrone 4 times daily .
the epidurals are continued on 4 - 8 mls / h until the 500 mls bag is finished and patients are then patients are bridged to a standardized controlled - release oxycodone protocol with controlled - release oxycodone / oxycodone with naloxone 20 - 0 - 10 mg per day and oral dipyrone .
during their stay in hospital all patients are visited daily by a pain specialized anesthetist and pain medication is adjusted to the state of recovery .
moreover numeric rating scale ( nrs ) at rest and on coughing are documented by the nurses on the wards every 6 h , implicating that the rescue medication ( parecoxib 40 mg iv ) has been administered by the nurse when nrs scores > 3 at rest and > 5 on coughing .
thirty min after administration of rescue medication the nrs has to be re - assessed .
if pain score is again > 5 on coughing , the nurse has to contact the anesthetist responsible for postoperative pain therapy .
it is standardized in our thoracic centre that all patients ( both analgesic regimens ) receive macrogel 13 g three times a day orally from day 1 on ward .
we assessed our 2 analgesic protocols retrospectively for 1555 thoracotomies from 2011 - 2013 .
surgeons decide on the time of discharge of patients from our hospital .
all variables were analyzed by methods of descriptive statistics ( frequency , mean +/ - standard deviation , range ) .
differences between groups were analyzed by using the mann - whitney - u test and differences in proportions were statistically evaluated by using chi - square test .
statistical significance was determined at the p < 0.05 level .
statistical analysis was performed by using spss 20.0 statistical package .
results data of 1555 major thoracotomies from 2011 - 2013 were analyzed , 838 patients in the eda group and 717 patients in the opioid group ( table 1 ) .
in the opioid group 414 patients received controlled - release oxycodone alone , and 303 patients received controlled - release oxycodone combined with naloxone .
the 1555 thoracotomies were in detail 46 pneumonectomies ( table 2 ) , 28 bilobectomies ( table 3 ) , 562 lobectomies ( table 4 ) , 213 segmental resections ( table 5 ) , 459 wedge resections ( table 6 ) , 21 lung volume reductions ( table 7 ) , 60 pleurectomies ( table 8 ) , and 176 various procedures ( table 9 ) .
there was no difference with regard to sex or age between the eda and the opioid group ( table 1 ) except the patient population undergoing pleurectomy ( table 8 ) .
more male patients received a pleurectomy than female patients ( 90 % vs 60 % , p = 0.007 , table 8 ) .
within the 1555 thoracotomies more patients in the opioid group had a preexisting pain therapy than in the eda group ( eda : 7.5 % vs opioid group13 % , p < 0.001. table 1 ) .
regarding the bilobectomy procedure more patients in the eda group had a pre - existing pain therapy than patients in the opioid group ( 100 % vs. 30 % , p < 0.04 , table 3 ) and regarding the lobectomy procedure , more patients in the opioid group than in the eda group had a pre - existing pain therapy ( 13.8 % vs 6.4 % , p = 0.004 , table 4 ) .
in the eda group epidural analgesia was performed for 4.6 +/ - 1.5 days ( table 1 ) .
hospital stay was the same in both groups ( eda : 9.9 +/ - 4.9 vs oxy : 9.6 +/ - 5.8 days , not significant , table 1 ) .
only in patients undergoing pleurectomy hospital stay was shorter in the eda group ( eda group : 10.8 +/ - 5.1 vs opioid group 13.3 +/ - 8.4 days , p < 0.01 , table 8 ) .
84.7 % of patients in the eda group and 79.1 % of patients of the opioid group were dismissed with oral opioid ( p < 0.004 , table 1 ) , and when patients were dismissed with opioid medication patients in the eda group were dismissed with higher oxycodone opioid doses than patients in the opioid group ( 29.5 +/ - 15.2 mg vs 26.9 +/ - 15.2 mg , p = 0.01 , table 1 ) .
there was no difference with regard to recovery of bowel function between the two groups ( eda : 3.8 +/ - 2.2 days vs oxy : 3.7 +/ - 1.6 days , n.s. ) .

we retrospectively compared our two analgesic protocols in 1555 patients who were visited daily from a pain specialist and found no difference in recovery of bowel function ( time of first dejection ) .
first time of dejection was overall the fourth postoperative day .
epidural analgesia is supposed to earlier restitution of bowel function than opioid - based systemic postoperative analgesia [ 8 ],[ 9 ] .
however , these systematic review data are based on data on abdominal surgery .
our data cannot confirm the superiority of thoracic epidural analgesia compared to postoperative opioids regarding bowel function .
to our knowledge , no data of randomized controlled trials comparing epidurals and opioids on postoperative recovery after thoracotomy are available up to now .
our retrospective data indicate that patients with epidural analgesia stay as long in hospital as patients with initial systemic opioid - based therapy .
there is only a mild tendency to a shorter hospital stay in the epidural group in patients with " smaller " surgical procedures , e.g. in the metastasectomy subgroup or in the pleurectomy subgroup .
in all other surgical procedures such as lobectomies , bilobectomies , segmental resections with a greater resection of parenchyma no difference in hospital stay could be detected , although epidural analgesia in general is supposed to " catalyze " recovery [ 6 ],[ 7 ] .
we cannot confirm these data .
again the current evicence is not based on randomized controlled trials .
we suppose that the most influencing factor on postoperative recovery is , assuming that effective postoperative analgesia is provided , the surgical experience and management of the patient .
however , regarding literature there is strong evidence that pulmonary outcome is better in thoracic surgery if patients have epidurals [ 5 ] .
we cannot confirm these data from 1998 either .
we explain our good results with the consequent analgesic protocols for both groups until dismission from hospital and our intensive monitoring of pain therapy until dismisssion .
to our knowledge , we first described an " aggressive " systemic analgesic regimen in patients undergoing thoracotomy [ 10 ],[ 11 ] .
more male than female patients underwent a pleurectomy .
this is most likely due to the fact that the pleura mesothelioma is diagnosed more often in male patients .
we assume that this difference in demographic data do not compromise our results .
our results regarding pre - existing pain therapy and the choose of the analgesic regimens are quite inhomogeously .
in all 1555 thoracotomies more patients in the opioid group had a preexisting pain therapy than in the eda group .
regarding the bilobectomy procedure more patients in the eda group had a pre - existing pain therapy than patients in the opioid group and regarding the lobectomy procedure , more patients in the opioid group than in the eda group had a pre - existing pain therapy .
one would have expected that more epidurals are placed in patients with pre - existing pain therapy .
however , these results underline that our both analgesic protocols are effective .
we found that more patients in the eda group than in the opioid group are dismissed with oral opioid , and when patients are dismissed with opioid medication , patients in the eda group are dismissed with higher opioid doses than patients in the opioid group .
this finding underlines the fact that thoracic surgery needs multimodal analgesic concepts not only in the first postoperative period , but also until dismission from hospital .
we present retrospective data in our observational study. of course , these data might be biased .
we tried to reduce potential biases in patient selection by detailed subgroup analysis .
patients undergoing a metastasectomy e.g. have mostly no compromised lung function , they differ from patients undergoing a lung volume reduction e.g. with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , mostly gold iv with oxygen therapy .
however , there might be a tendency in our department to recommend epidural analgesia to the patients when the lung function is compromised and / or an extended resection of lung parenchyma is planned .
more randomized controlled trials with strong inclusion criteria are needed to compare the influence of epidurals on the outcome after thoracic surgery .
conclusion we assessed the protocols of epidural analgesia and systemic analgesia retrospectively in 1555 thoracotomies during 2011 - 2013 with regard to length of postoperative hospital stay , recovery of bowel function and opioid dose on dismission from hospital .
we found no superiority of epidural analgesia .
we explain our finding with the consequent analgesic protocols for both groups until dismission from hospital .
our findings underline the fact that thoracic surgery needs multimodal analgesic concepts not only in the first postoperative period , but also until dismission from hospital .

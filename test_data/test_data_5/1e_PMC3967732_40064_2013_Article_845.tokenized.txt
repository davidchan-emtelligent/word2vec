optineurin is a gene associated with normal tension glaucoma ( ntg ) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) .
foci formation and functional consequences including golgi fragmentation , impairment of vesicle trafficking and apoptosis were observed previously upon overexpression and / or mutation of optineurin .
in the current study , a total of 15 gfp tagged constructs that included ntg ( e50k and 2 bp - ag insertion ) , als ( exon 5 deletion , r96l , q398x , and e478g ) and non - disease ( l157a and d474n ) associated mutants and a series of deletion fragments were cloned into mammalian expression vectors and transfected into rgc5 and / or neuro2a cells to evaluate whether their expression confer the optineurin phenotypes .
the cells were monitored for foci formation and stained by immunofluorescence with anti - gm130 to analyze the golgi integrity .
transferrin uptake experiments were performed to evaluate the protein trafficking process and apoptosis was assessed with the active caspase 3 / 7 detection kit .
we demonstrated that cells expressing e50k and r96l optineurin exhibited all of the optineurin phenotypes .
q398x mutant did not induce foci formation , but triggered golgi fragmentation , impairment of transferrin uptake and increase in apoptosis .
the 2 bp - ag insertion mutant had a nuclear localization , compromised the transferrin uptake and strongly induced apoptosis .
the foci formation , which might not predict the rest of the phenotypes , appeared to require both the leucine zipper and ubiquitin binding domains of the optineurin sequence .
interactions of optineurin with proteins including rab8 , myosin vi , huntingtin and transferrin receptor might directly determine whether the golgi and protein trafficking phenotypes would be manifested .
examination of mutants and deletion fragments located at various sites of optineurin gene provide clues as to what regions of the gene may play a critical role in the development of pathologic consequences .
keywords optineurin glaucoma amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutations deletion fragments phenotypes issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 introduction optineurin , a 67 - kda protein , has attracted much attention in the neuroscience fields in recent years .
it was first isolated in 1998 by li et al .
( 1998 ) in yeast 2 - hybrid screen and has been shown subsequently ( schwamborn et al .
2000 ) to have a strong homology to nf - kappab essential molecule ( nemo ) .
in 2002 ( rezaie et al. 2002 ) , the optineurin or " optic neuropathy inducing " gene was identified to be a candidate gene of primary open - angle glaucoma ( poag ) , the most common form of glaucoma , one of the leading causes of irreversible bilateral blindness worldwide .
poag , characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and progressive axonal and visual field loss , is age - related and frequently associated with increased intraocular pressure ( stamer and acott 2012 ) .
it is genetically heterogeneous , caused by several susceptibility genes ( allingham et al .
2009 ; fingert 2011 ; wiggs 2012 ) and also environmental factors ( wiggs 2012 ) .
optineurin was found to be linked in particular to normal tension glaucoma ( ntg ) ( rezaie et al. 2002 ; sarfarazi and rezaie 2003 ) , a subtype of poag .
more recently , mutations in optineurin were also reported to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) ( maruyama et al. 2010 ; deng et al. 2011 ) .
optineurin was noted to be localized in pathological structures in als , neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neuritis in alzheimer 's disease , as well as lewy bodies and lewy neuritis in parkinson 's disease ( osawa et al. 2011 ) .
in addition , optineurin was identified as one of the genetic risk factor for paget 's disease of bone ( albagha et al. 2010 ; chung et al. 2010 ) .
the human optineurin gene codes for a 577 - amino acid protein ( li et al. 1998 ) .
the protein consists of a nemo - like domain , leucine zipper motif , multiple coiled - coil motifs , an ubiquitin binding domain ( ubd ) , a microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( lc3 ) - interacting motif , and a carboxyl ( c ) - terminal zinc finger ( figure 1 ) ( ying and yue 2012 ) .
optineurin is a cytosolic protein that is not secreted ( ying et al. 2010 ) .
it is expressed in many non - ocular tissues such as the brain and the heart as well as in ocular tissues including the retina and the trabecular meshwork ( schwamborn et al. 2000 ; sarfarazi and rezaie 2003 ; ying and yue 2012 ) .
figure 1 schematic representation of mutants and deletion fragments examined in the current study. a. the full length of wild type ( 1 - 577 ) optineurin protein consists of a leucine zipper ( lz , dark blue ) domain , lc3 interacting ( lir , green ) motif , coiled - coil ( cc , blue ) domains , an ubiquitin binding domain ( ubd , yellow ) and a zinc finger ( znf , purple ) motif .
optineurin mutations are indicated .
e50k is associated with ntg .
r96l and e478g are associated with als .
l157a and d474n mutations have not been linked to any diseases so far. b. deletion fragments of optineurin .
the glaucoma - associated 2 bp - ag insertion mutation , als - associated exon 5 deletion mutation and q398x mutant result in truncation of the protein into a 1 - 148 , 1 - 55 fragment and 1 - 398 fragment respectively and are therefore categorized as deletion fragments .
optineurin has been shown to be a negative regulator of the nf - kappab pathway ( schwamborn et al. 2000 ; zhu et al. 2007 ; sudhakar et al. 2009 ; nagabhushana et al. 2011 ; akizuki et al .
2013 ) and a player in mitotic progression ( kachaner et al. 2012a , b ) .
it has also emerged as an autophagy receptor ( wild et al. 2011 ; tumbarello et al. 20122013 ) .
optineurin is found necessary for optimal activation of tank binding kinase 1 and interferon regulatory factor 3 in immune cells ( sakaguchi et al. 2011 ; munitic et al .
2013 ) and is noted in addition to be a player in antiviral immune response ( mankouri et al. 2010 ) .
this protein is moreover demonstrated to interact and / or form complex with proteins including rab8 , huntingtin ( htt ) , myosin vi , and transferrin receptor ( tfr ) .
the binding sites with rab8 , htt , and myosin vi reside respectively , between 141 - 209 , 411 - 461 , and 412 - 520 amino acid residues of optineurin .
all these interacting partners are known to have a role in membrane trafficking pathways ( hattula and peranen 2000 ; sahlender et al. 2005 ; au et al. 2007 ; del toro et al .
2009 ) and such interactions may be the basis why optineurin is involved in regulation of protein trafficking ( hattula and peranen 2000 ; sahlender et al. 2005 ; del toro et al. 2009 ; nagabhushana et al. 2010 ; park et al. 2010 ) .
in patients with ntg , mutations including glu50lys ( e50k ) and 691 _ 692ins ag ( 2 bp - ag insertion ) have been identified ( rezaie et al. 2002 ) .
e50k is a missense mutation and 2 bp - ag insertion is a nonsense mutation that leads to truncation of optineurin protein by 76 % ( rezaie et al. 2002 ) .
three mutations in the gene encoding optineurin in japanese familiar or sporadic als patients have also been reported ( maruyama et al .
2010 ) which include a homozygous deletion of exon 5 , a homozygous nonsense gln398 stop ( q398x ) and a heterozygous missense glu478gly ( e478g ) .
additional mutations associated with als have been identified , such as arg96leu ( r96l ) mutation in french families of als patients ( millecamps et al. 2011 ) .
it has been previously reported that overexpression of wild type optineurin resulted in formation of bright granular or punctate structures , termed foci , and fragmentation of the golgi ( park et al. 2006 ; ying et al. 2010 ) .
in addition , impairment of transferrin uptake ( park et al. 2010 ) and apoptosis ( koga et al. 2010 ) were observed .
in cells expressing e50k , all these phenotypes were manifested to a greater degree than in the wild type ( park et al. 20062010 ; nagabhushana et al. 2010 ; ying et al. 2010 ). by contrast , cells expressing leu157ala ( l157a ) and asp474asn ( d474n ) optineurin mutations , evaluated by park et al .
( 2010 ) and nagabhushana et al .
( 2010 ) respectively , showed minimal foci formation and unaltered transferrin uptake .
neither mutation , to date , has been linked to any diseases .
the present study was undertaken to determine whether the expression of a number of optineurin mutations and deletion fragments in cell lines rgc5 and / or neuro2a would result in the above - mentioned optineurin phenotypes that include foci formation , golgi fragmentation , compromised transferrin uptake and increased apoptotic activity .
a total of 15 green fluorescence protein ( gfp ) tagged constructs that included wild type optineurin , and ntg ( e50k and 2 bp - ag insertion ) , als ( exon 5 deletion , r96l , q398x , and e478g ) and non - disease ( l157a and d474n ) associated mutants as well as various deletion fragments were prepared .
these constructs were transfected into cells and the ensuing biological consequences were evaluated .
missense mutations e50k and r96l are located in the n - terminal coiled - coil domain of optineurin while d474n and e478g are in the c - terminal ubd domain. by computer analysis ( http :// 2zip.molgen.mpg.de /) , the change of leu157 to ala in the optineurin sequence may lead to obliteration of the leucine zipper .
the nonsense 2 bp - ag insertion presumably induces a premature stop codon that leads to truncations of the optineurin protein by 76 % , yielding a 1 - 148 fragment. with exon 5 deletion , the resulting transcript would also be expected to translate into a truncated protein ( 1 - 55 ) with only 55 amino acids in length ( ying and yue 2012 ) .
q398stop ( q398x ) mutation in addition would cause truncation , yielding a fragment with 398 amino acid residues ( 1 - 398 ) .
these 3 mutations or deletion fragments with truncated c - terminal ubd domains along with fragments 1 - 209 , 1 - 424 , 210 - 424 , 217 - 398 , 217 - 577 , and 425 - 577 lack either the n - terminal coiled - coil , the leucine zipper , the c - terminal coiled - coil , and / or the ubd sequences .
a schematic representation of the mutations and fragments is shown in figure 1 .
materials and methods cell cultures rgc5 cells were obtained from the departmental core facility at the university of illinois at chicago , deposited by dr. paul knepper ( choi et al. 2005 ) and generously provided originally by dr. neeraj agarwal ( aoun et al. 2003 ; agarwal 2013 ) .
rgc5 cells were grown in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) and antibiotics ( park et al. 2007 ; koga et al. 2010 ; ying et al. 2010 ; shen et al. 2011 ) .
mouse neuronal neuro2a cells were obtained from dr. chunjiang yu at the university of illinois at chicago ( chakrabarti et al. 2013 ) .
neuro2a cells were cultured under conditions similar to rgc5 cells in dmem supplemented with 10 % fbs .
plasmid constructs expression vectors with enhanced gfp ( egfp ) tagged at the c - terminus of wild type , e50k , and l157a optineurin , poptnwt - egfp , poptne50k - egfp and poptnl157a - egfp , respectively , were constructed as previously described ( park et al. 2006 ; ying et al. 2010 ; ying and yue 2012 ) .
mutant constructs poptnr96l - egfp , poptnd474n - egfp , and poptne478g - egfp were additionally made based on poptnwt - egfp by site - directed mutagenesis employing the quikchange ii site - directed mutagenesis kit from stratagene ( la jolla , ca ) or the genetailor ( tm ) site - directed mutagenesis system from invitrogen ( grand island , ny ) .
primers used were listed in table 1 with point mutations in boldface .
expression vectors of fragments of optineurin including pegfp - optnwt , pegfp - optnexon 5 del , - optn1 - 209 , - optn1 - 424 , - optn210 - 424 , and - optn425 - 577 were made by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) amplification using primers listed in table 1 and subsequent subcloning into pegfp - c1 vector ( clontech , mountain view , ca ) .
they were tagged with egfp at the amino ( n ) - terminus .
pegfp - optn2 bp - ag insertion and pegfp - optnq398x were made by site - directed mutagenesis based on pegfp - optnwt .

immunofluorscence staining rgc5 or neuro2a cells plated ( 7000 cells / well ) on lab - tek 8 - well cc2 glass chamber slides ( nalgenunc , rochester , ny ) were transfected with lipofectamine ltx transfection reagent ( invitrogen ) for 18 hours and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min .
after permeabilization in 0.2 % triton x - 100 for 4 min , the cells were blocked for 1 hour with 3 % bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with mouse monoclonal anti - gm130 primary antibody ( 1:200 , bd biosciences , san jose , ca ) .
after a further 1 hour incubation with cy3 - goat anti - mouse igg ( 1:200 ; jackson immunoresearch laboratories , west grove , pa ) , the slides were mounted in vectashield mounting solution ( vector laboratories , burlingame , ca ) containing 4 ' , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( dapi ) .
the fluorescence was visualized on an axioscope ( carl zeiss microimaging , thornwood , ny ) with a 63x oil objective .
approximately 20 images were acquired for each specimen .
the images were evaluated for formation of foci which are bright , granular or punctate structures located in the perinuclear region of the cell ( park et al. 2006 ; ying et al. 2010 ) .
additionally , the percentage of cells with fragmented golgi was determined .
golgi fragmentation was defined as the appearance of disconnected , small and round golgi fragments dispersed in the cells ( park et al. 2006 ) .
cells with compromised golgi were counted and the percentage of cells containing fragmented golgi relative to the total number of transfected cells was calculated .
a minimum of 40 cells were evaluated for each expression vector per experiment with the exception of d474n and 2 bp - ag insertion constructs with which only approximately 20 cells were examined ( due to the low number of transfected cells ) .
four independent experiments were performed .
results were presented as the average of the 4 experiments ( mean +/ - sem ) .
transferrin uptake rgc5 cells plated on lab - tek 8 - well cc2 glass chamber slides were transfected for 18 hours .
thereafter , the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) and incubated for 1 hour in serum - free dmem with 0.2 % bsa ( dmem - bsa ) to deplete serum .
the cells were then incubated with dmem - bsa containing 25 mug / ml of texas red - transferrin ( tr - tf ) ( invitrogen ) at 37degreesc for 0 or 15 min , placed on ice , and washed 3 times with cold pbs containing 0.2 % bsa , 1 mm cacl2 and 1 mm mgcl2 .
following a wash in cold acid buffer containing 0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m nacl and a rinse with ice - cold pbs , the cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and mounted .
images were acquired with leica sp2 confocal system ( leica microsystems , bannockburn , il ) with a 40x dry objective using sequential scanning to minimize the bleed through .
the uptake of tr - tf was quantified as described by park et al .
( 2010 ) .
in brief , the outline of single cell was drawn and using leica confocal software , the average fluorescence intensity of tr - tf inside the cell was measured .
a region without any fluorescence , which served as the background , was subtracted from the red fluorescence intensity in the cell .
the resulting intensity was multiplied by the area of the cell for the total intensity .
the values for at least 40 transfected and 40 non - transfected cells in approximately 10 different visual fields were averaged .
five sets of independent experiments were performed .
the intensity of tr - tf for each construct was presented as the average ( mean +/ - sem ) of 5 experiments .
apoptosis apoptosis was evaluated using the biomol cv - caspase 3 and 7 detection kit ( enzo life sciences , inc , farmingdale , ny ) .
the kit utilizes a fluorophore , cresyl violet , coupled to the c - terminus of the optimal tetrapeptide recognition sequences for caspase 3 and 7 , devd ( cr ( devd ) 2 ) ( koga et al. 2010 ) .
once target sequences are cleaved by the activated enzymes , red fluorescence throughout the cell is visualized , indicative of apoptotic activity .
briefly , cells on chamber slides transiently transfected for 48 hours were incubated with [ cr ( devd ) 2 ] in dmem for 60 min .
following incubation with hoechst stain for 5 min , the cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde .
the slides were mounted and imaged immediately with fluorescence microscopy using a 40x oil objective .
images from 20 randomly selected areas were acquired .
approximately 60 cells for each construct per experiment were evaluated for apoptotic activity .
the number of transfected cells with positive caspase 3 / 7 activity ( red and green fluorescence ) and total number of transfected cells ( only green ) were counted .
the percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated from these numbers .
five independent experiments were performed .
data from 2 complete experiments were averaged .
immunoprecipitation and western blotting to examine the binding of optineurin and mutants with endogenous rab8 and tfr , rgc5 cells were transfected with poptnwt - egfp , poptne50k - egfp , poptnr96l - egfp , poptne478g - egfp , pegfp - optnq398x , pegfp - optn2 bp - ag insertion , and pegfp - n1 ( control ) for 24 hours .
immunoprecipitation was performed using mumacs gfp isolation kit ( miltenyibiotec , auburn , ca ) and multimacs ( tm ) m96 / m96 thermo separators ( miltenyibiotec ) following manufacturer 's protocol .
in brief , cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 50 mm tris - hcl , 150 mmnacl , 1 % triton x - 100 , ph 8.0 ) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture ( sigma ) .
clear cell lysate was incubated with 50 mul of anti - gfp microbeads to magnetically label the gfp - tagged protein for 30 min on ice .
the mu column was installed on multimacs ( tm ) m96 / m96 thermo separators and magnetic field was applied .
the mu column was equilibrated with equilibration buffer and then the lysate - microbeads mixture was loaded .
after washing with 4 x 200 mul of lysis buffer and 1 x 100 mul of low salt wash buffer ( 20 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.5 ) , 20 mul of pre - heated 95degreesc hot elution buffer ( 1x sds loading buffer ) was applied to the column and incubated at room temperature for 5 min .
finally 80 mul of pre - heated 95degreesc elution buffer was applied to the column and elutes were collected .
the elutes were subjected to sds - page under reducing conditions .
the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane , and the level of co - precipitated endogenous tfr and rab8 were assessed by mouse anti - rab8 ( bd biosciences ) and anti - tfr ( zymed laboratories , san francisco , ca ) monoclonal antibodies .
the pulled down optineurin - gfp fusion protein or gfp control was evaluated by rabbit anti - gfp polyclonal antibody ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca ) .
the blot was further incubated for 1 hour with horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( 1:10,000 ; jackson immunoresearch laboratories , west grove , pa ) .
immunoreactive protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using supersignal substrate ( pierce ) .
densitometry was performed .
the band intensity of the co - precipitated rab8 or tfr was normalized to that of optineurin - gfp ( indicated as a ratio ) .
total cell lysates from rgc5 cells transfected with pegfp - n1 , poptnwt - egfp or poptne50k - egfp were also immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti - optineurin ( c - term ) polyclonal antibody ( cayman chemical , ann arbor , mi ) .
lysate of non - transfected rgc5 cells was immunoprecipitated with rabbit normal igg as a negative control .
the pulled down protein was immunoblotted with anti - tfr , anti - rab8 , or anti - optineurin .
the band intensities of rab8 and tfr were normalized to those of the endogenous optineurin or optineurin - gfp .
the membranes were additionally stripped and re - probed with anti beta - catenin ( santa cruz biotechnology ) to verify the specificity of immunoblotting .
statistical analysis one - way anova was performed as a statistical measure for significance of the data .
statistical significance was noted if p < 0.05 .
results foci formation in rgc5 cells transfected to express wild type and e50k optineurin - gfp , bright granular structures ( foci ) in perinuclear regions were formed ( figure 2 ) as previously demonstrated ( park et al. 2006 ; ying et al. 2010 ) .
r96l , located in the domain close to e50k , resulted in similarly prominent foci formation .
foci by contrast were not observed with mutations in the ubd domain , d474n and e478g .
foci were also not discerned with exon 5 deletion ( 1 - 55 ) and q398x ( 1 - 398 ) mutations and deletion fragments 1 - 209 , 1 - 424 , 210 - 424 and 217 - 398 in which either the ubd or the n - terminal leucine zipper sequences were lacking or truncated ( figure 2 ) .
in cells expressing l157a , and fragments 217 - 577 and 425 - 577 , foci were occasionally noted but the foci were atypical in that they were small in size , low in number , and were more spread out , not concentrated in the perinuclear area .
the 2 bp - ag insertion mutant ( 1 - 148 fragment ) was expressed and localized in the nucleus ( figure 2 ) .
these findings were similarly demonstrated in neuro2a cells ( figure 3 ) .
figure 2 foci formation in rgc5 cells .
cells transfected with pegfp - n1 ( mock control ) , gfp - tagged optineurin wild type , mutants as well as deletion fragment constructs were observed by fluorescence microscopy 24 hours post transfection .
bright granular structures ( foci , arrowheads ) in perinuclear regions were prominently observed in cells expressing optineurin wild type , e50k , and r96l , but not at all in those expressing d474n , e478g and deletion fragments 1 - 55 , 1 - 148 , 1 - 209 , 1 - 398 , and 1 - 424 .
in cells expressing mutant l157a and deletion fragments 217 - 577 and 425 - 577 ( not shown ) , foci were typically not detected .
foci were noted occasionally , but they were small in size , low in number , and were not concentrated in the perinuclear area .
note nuclear location of deletion fragment 1 - 148 .

cells transfected with pegfp - n1 ( mock control ) , gfp - tagged optineurin wild type , mutants as well as deletion fragment constructs were observed by fluorescence microscopy 24 hours post transfection .
bright granular structures ( foci , arrowheads ) in perinuclear regions were prominently observed in cells expressing optineurin wild type , e50k , and r96l , but not in the cells transfected with other mutant or deletion constructs .
note that fragment 1 - 148 was expressed in the nucleus .
scale bar , 20 mum .
golgi fragmentation to examine the integrity of the golgi apparatus , rgc5 and neuro2a cells were immunostained with anti - gm130 , a golgi marker .
non - transfected and gfp - expressing control cells showed robust gm130 staining and golgi apparatus .
in rgc5 cells expressing wild type , e50k , r96l , and q398x optineurin however , the golgi complex was disconnected , smaller , and appeared to be fragmented ( figure 4a ) .
the percentage of cells displaying golgi fragmentation ( figure 4b , 32.4 +/ - 6.1 % , 55.7 +/ - 6.6 % , 23.5 +/ - 5.5 %. and 25.8 +/ - 6.1 % , respectively for wild type , e50k , r96l , and q398x optineurin ) was significantly ( p < 0.033 ) higher than that in gfp ( 9.8 +/ - 3.7 %) and non - transfected ( 8.4 +/ - 3.3 %) normal controls .
the percentage of golgi - fragmented cells was moderately increased in rgc5 cells overexpressing e478g ( 17.5 +/ - 6.3 %) , fragment 1 - 424 ( 17.4 +/ - 4.7 %) and fragment 217 - 577 ( 18.5 +/ - 4.9 %) , although their values did not reach statistical significance .
the percentages of rgc5 cells with golgi fragmentation in l157a , d474n , exon 5 deletion ( 1 - 55 ) , and 2 bp - ag insertion ( 1 - 148 ) mutants as well as 1 - 209 , 210 - 424 , 217 - 398 , and 425 - 577 fragments were similar to controls ( figure 4b ) .
golgi staining of neuro2a cells yielded comparable results ( data not shown ) .
figure 4 golgi fragmentation. a. rgc5 cells transfected with pegfp - n1 ( mock control ) , gfp - tagged optineurin wild type , mutants or deletion fragment constructs were immunostained with anti - gm130 ( golgi marker , in red ) .
representative images of wild type , e50k , r96l , l157a , d474n , e478g , as well as deletion fragments 1 - 55 , 1 - 148 , 1 - 209 , 1 - 398 , 1 - 424 , and 217 - 577 are shown .
the nuclei were stained with dapi in blue and transfected cells are in green .
severe golgi fragmentation was observed in cells with prominent perinuclear foci formation such as wild type , e50k and r96l .
the golgi fragmentation however could still occur even without robust foci formation such as in q398x ( 1 - 398 ) .
the percent of cells with fragmented golgi was also increased with e478g , 1 - 424 , and 217 - 577 , but the values did not reach statistical significance .
higher magnification image of a transfected green cell indicated with a white star is shown in the inset .
scale bar , 10 mum. b. the percentage of cells with golgi fragmentation was quantified .
compared to non - transfected normal or gfp mock controls , significantly more cells showed golgi fragmentation in wild type , e50k , r96l and 1 - 398 transfected cells .

as shown in figure 5b , the transferrin uptake in cells transfected with wild type and e50k optineurin was significantly decreased ( p < 0.0022 ) compared with gfp control , corroborating previous results ( park et al. 2010 ; ying et al. 2010 ) .
the impairment of transferrin uptake in cells expressing e50k ( 37 % , average percent difference in comparison to gfp cells ) was more pronounced than those expressing wild type optineurin ( 30 %) .
cells expressing r96l , 2 bp - ag insertion , and q398x optineurin also had a significant decrease in transferrin uptake (~ 18 - 36 % , p < 0.031 compared with gfp control ) ( figure 5b ) .
d474n and e478g showed only approximately 10 % , non - significant reduction in transferrin uptake .
the transferrin uptake in rgc5 cells expressing l157a optineurin was unaltered ( p > 0.05 ) , in agreement with studies by park et al .

the percentage of apoptotic cells in each specimen was quantified ( figure 6b ) .
the value was low in non - transfected and gfp mock controls ( 2.9 % +/ - 1.3 ) .
cells expressing wild type , e50k , r96l , q398x ( 1 - 398 ) and 2 bp - ag insertion ( 1 - 148 ) optineurin all displayed significantly ( p < 0.0031 ) increased levels of apoptotic activity ( 8.8 +/ - 2.1 % , 10.8 +/ - 4.1 % , 8.3 +/ - 3.1 % , 8.2 +/ - 3.7 % , 28.6 +/ - 11.9 % , respectively ) compared to gfp controls .
among them , the 2 bp - ag insertion mutant induced the highest level of apoptosis .
l157a optineurin expression in cells did not show evidence of enhanced apoptosis ( 2.8 % +/ - 0.6 compared with gfp control ) .
the level of apoptosis in cells transfected with d474n and e478g mutants and the optineurin fragments remained in the normal range , similar to that of mock controls ( figure 6b ) .
levels of co - precipitated endogenous rab8 and tfr rab8 and tfr have been shown to interact with optineurin ( ying et al. 2010 ) .
the level of these molecules co - immunoprecipitated with gfp in rgc5 cell lysates was examined by western blotting .
e50k - , r96l - , q398x - and e478g - gfp fusion proteins showed more rab8 co - pulled down than the wild type optineurin - gfp ( figure 7a ) .
the ratio after normalization with the total amount of optineurin - gfp pulled down was : wild type ( 1.0 ) , e50k ( 2.3 ) , r96l ( 1.3 ) , q398x ( 0.9 ) and e478g ( 1.4 ) , respectively .
the mutants likewise pulled down more endogenous tfr ( figure 7b ) .
the normalized ratio to wild type ( 1.0 ) was : e50k ( 2.6 ) , r96l ( 2.1 ) , q398x ( 1.3 ) , and e478g ( 1.2 ) , respectively .
the pull down experiment with 2 bp - ag insertion - gfp failed , likely due to the fact that this fragment was very toxic , causing severe cell death ( data not shown ) .
negative mock control egfp - n1 , as expected , did not pull down rab8 and tfr ( figure 7a , b ) .

rgc5 cells were transfected with pegfp - n1 , and gfp - tagged wild type , e50k , r96l , q398x , and e478g optineurin constructs .
optn - gfp was immunoprecipitated with anti - gfp microbeads .
pulled down protein was immunoblotted with anti - gfp to verify the immunoprecipitation ( ip ) procedure .
co - precipitated proteins were immunoblotted ( ib ) with anti - rab8 ( a ) , anti - tfr ( b ) , or anti - gfp antibody .
densitometry was performed to quantify the intensity of rab8 , tfr and optn - gfp bands .
the values were normalized against optn - gfp and the ratios between the mutants and wild type optineurin are presented .
note that the levels of rab8 and tfr co - precipitated with optn - gfp in the mutants were similar to , or higher than , those in the wild type .
as was expected , no rab8 or tfr protein co - precipitation with gfp ( 25 kda , asterisks ) was detected in lysates collected from cells transfected with egfp - n1 empty vector ( c ) .
the levels of rab8 and tfr co - precipitated with optineurin .
rgc5 cells were non - transfected , or transfected with pegfp - n1 , or gfp - tagged wild type or e50k optineurin construct .
optineurin - gfp ( optn - gfp ) and endogenous optineurin ( optn ) were immunoprecipitated with anti - optineurin polyclonal antibody .
non - transfected rgc5 cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with normal igg as negative control .
the pulled down protein was immunoblotted with anti - rab8 ( top panel ) , anti - tfr antibody ( middle panel ) or anti - optineurin antibody ( bottom panel , for verification of the ip procedure ) .
normal igg did not yield any band for tfr or rab8 as was expected .
the ratios of rab8 / endogenous optn ( top panel ) and tfr / endogenous optn ( middle panel ) from wild type and e50k optineurin - gfp - expressing cells were higher than those of gfp control .
cell lysates of rgc5 cells transfected with pegfp - n1 , and wild type or e50k optineurin - egfp expression vectors were also immunoprecipitated with anti - optineurin polyclonal antibody and immunoblotted with anti - rab8 , anti - tfr or anti - optineurin .
the rab8 / endogenous optineurin values from wild type and e50k optineurin - gfp - expressing cells were 2.7 and 3.6 fold higher , respectively , than that of the gfp control ( figure 7c , top panel ) .
the tfr / endogenous optineurin values were likewise higher ( 1.6 and 2.5 fold , respectively ) in poptnwt - and poptne50k - egfp - transfected cells ( figure 7c , middle panel ) .
these results indicated that relative to egfp - n1 control or the normal situation , the rab8 or tfr binding was increased by 2 - 3 fold upon overexpression of wild type and e50k optineurin - gfp .
since the rab8 and tfr optineurin - gfp - co - precipitated levels were similar to , or greater than , those of the wild type ( figure 7a , b ) , mutants such as r96l and q398x were also deduced to confer an enhanced binding capacity for these proteins .
total cell lysate of non - transfected rgc5 cells , when immunoprecipitated with rabbit normal igg showed no reactivity with either rab8 , tfr or optineurin antibody ( negative control ) .
the membranes were further stripped and re - blotted with an irrelevant antibody , anti - beta - catenin , as an additional control .
signal was not detected on any of the blots ( data not shown ) .
discussion the current study examined the biological consequences of a series of mutations and sequence deletions in the optineurin gene to determine correlations between biomolecular functions and specific structural elements .
the results presented in figures 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 are summarized in table 2 .

** nuclear localization was observed .
e50k , a mutation located in the n - terminal coiled - coil domain of optineurin , demonstrates prominent phenotypes that include foci formation , golgi fragmentation , impairment in transferrin uptake and apoptosis .
r96l , another mutation located nearby , also yielded all , albeit less pronounced phenotypes .
e50k is a mutation prevalent in patients with ntg ( rezaie et al .
2002 ) who often suffer glaucomatous defects more severe than those without e50k mutation ( aung et al. 2005 ) .
the current data , in agreement with those published previously by our laboratory and by others ( park et al. 20062010 ; nagabhushana et al. 2010 ; kryndushkin et al .
2012 ) , indicate that e50k is a gain - of - function mutation .
a stronger - than - the - wild type interaction of the e50k mutant with rab8 and tfr was observed ( figure 7a , b , c ) ( nagabhushana et al. 2010 ; park et al. 2010 ) .
we speculate that this mutation may generate a conformational change to promote protein interactions .
the prosite analysis ( bairoch et al. 1997 ) however suggests that introduction of e50k mutation results in no particular change either in the structure or the conformation of optineurin ( data not shown ) .
a more definitive conclusion has to await high - resolution structural determination by x - ray crystallography .
r96l , a missense mutation found in patients with als also appears to be a gain - of - function mutation with an enhanced binding with rab8 and tfr ( figure 7a , b ) .
the binding was nevertheless somewhat weaker than that seen with e50k .
the weaker binding may be the basis why the r96l phenotypes were milder than those of e50k .
l157a mutation has not been identified clinically in any patients to date and is more than likely not disease causing or related .
as stated above , the mutation may lead to obliteration of the leucine zipper in the optineurin sequence .
l157a mutant has been shown to interact with rab8 and tfr in a much reduced capacity ( park et al .
2010 ) , suggesting that the optineurin association with rab8 and tfr requires , at least in part , an intact leucine zipper motif .
no perinuclear foci were observed with l157a or with two mutations in the ubd domain , d474n and e478g .
it seems that the foci formation was abrogated by mutations in either the leucine zipper or the ubd domain .
foci were also not noted when cells were transfected to express optineurin mutations / fragments with sequence deletion ( s ) in either or both of the domains such as 1 - 209 , q398x ( 1 - 398 ) , 1 - 424 , and 217 - 577 .
the intact sequences of both leucine zipper and ubd domains are thus concluded to be required for the perinuclear foci formation phenotype .
this notion is somewhat different from that described in a recent report in which aggregates ( foci ) were seen in yeast with fragments 1 - 251 , 1 - 398 , 182 - 577 , and 98 - 398 ( kryndushkin et al .
2012 ) , as long as one of the coiled - coil domains was present .
the disparity in results could be related to difference in the systems used ( in vitro mouse cell culture versus in vivo yeast model ) , and also the definition or pattern of foci or aggregates formed .
while all optineurin phenotypes are observed when foci are formed with mutants ( such as e50k and r96l ) , the formation does not necessarily predict the other phenotypes .
one example is the fragment q398x ( 1 - 398 ) , which , with no foci manifestation , resulted in golgi fragmentation , defective transferrin uptake and apoptosis .
the foci are likely formed by self binding of optineurin molecules as well as their interactions with proteins including rab8 , myosin vi and tfr , requiring at least in part , intact leucine zipper and ubd motifs .
overabundance or accumulation of the protein / fragment and perturbation of the protein interactions conceivably would drive foci formation .
the role or significance of the foci observed is at present uncertain .
optineurin foci are reminiscent of the inclusion bodies , lewy bodies or aggresomes detected in neurodegenerative diseases ( grune et al. 2004 ) .
the inclusion bodies and aggresomes once were considered to be the culprit for neurodegenerative diseases .
more recent evidence however suggests that they may play protective role by sequestering toxic , misfolded protein species and providing the cells with an opportunity of delayed protein degradation ( garcia - arencibia et al. 2010 ; zerovnik 2010 ) .
they may also inactivate the proteasome and mediate cytotoxicity ( glick et al. 2010 ) .
the optineurin foci may likewise have a protective role .
the foci may nevertheless also signify that the cells are burdened to the extent of beyond protection .
our laboratory has shown that the proteasome activity is compromised and autophagy is induced when cells overexpress wild type and e50k optineurin ( shen et al. 2011 ) .
a very recent study on another optineurin variant , m98k , has further linked the autophagic process to apoptosis in rgc5 cells ( sirohi et al. 2013 ) .
it was speculated ( ying and yue 2012 ) that alterations in the interaction between optineurin and its binding partners ( such as rab8 , myosin vi , and htt ) may disturb the balance between actin - and microtubule - based motor systems and contribute to fragmentation of the golgi complex .
consistent with this hypothesis , golgi fragmentation was noted with wild type optineurin and mutants e50k , r96l and q398x ( or fragment 1 - 398 ) , all of which demonstrated an enhanced rab8 binding capacity ( figure 7a , c ) .
e478g mutant that resulted in golgi fragmentation at a mild level ( figure 4 ) also showed stronger binding with rab8 ( figure 7a ). with deletion in the n - terminal sequences ( fragment 217 - 577 ) and deletions of the c - terminal htt or myosin vi - binding sequences ( fragment 1 - 424 ) , mild golgi fragmentation was likewise observed ( figure 4 ) .
however , when both the n - terminal rab8 - binding and the c - terminal protein binding domains were missing ( fragments 1 - 55 , 210 - 424 , and 217 - 398 ) , no golgi fragmentation resulted .
exceptions however were seen that include d474n mutant and fragments 1 - 209 and 425 - 577 .
it is possible that in those situations , the binding disturbance was not sufficient to induce any golgi defect .
a heightened optineurin binding with tfr has been implicated as a factor leading to impairment of the transferrin uptake ( park et al. 2010 ) .
apoptosis may ensue either from the trafficking impairment and / or the golgi fragmentation .
in accordance with these hypotheses , wild type optineurin and e50k , r96l , and q398x ( 1 - 398 ) mutants that confer the transferrin uptake phenotype all exhibit a strong binding capacity with tfr ( figure 7b , c ) .
this same set of optineurins also induced apoptosis in cells , suggesting that the protein trafficking phenotype may be correlated with apoptosis , more so than the golgi fragmentation. of note is that fragment 1 - 424 , contrasting q398x , did not impact transferrin uptake or apoptosis level .
this fragment is only 26 amino acid residues longer than q398x .
perhaps addition of sequences between residues 399 and 424 enables the protein to adopt into a different , non - consequential conformation .
e478g had an elevated ratio of tfr co - precipitated with optineurin - gfp ( with a ratio of 1.2 relative to the wild type , figure 7b ) but provoked only about 10 % , non - significant reduction in the transferrin uptake ( figure 5b ) .
the nonsense 691 _ 692insag or the optineurin fragment 1 - 148 ( also called c.382 _ 383insag or 2 bp - ag insertion ) mutation that presumably induces a premature stop codon in exon 6 , stands out from others as it has a nuclear localization .
clinically , it was identified both in patients with glaucoma ( rezaie et al .
2002 ) and a patient with young als onset ( 46 years ) and rapid disease progression ( 21 months ) ( millecamps et al. 2011 ) .
optineurin does not contain nuclear localization sequences .
it has however been reported that optineurin is translocated to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress ( de marco et al. 2006 ) .
at mitotic entry , plk1 phosphorylates optineurin and dissociates it thereby from the golgi - localized rab8 , and induces its translocation to the nucleus ( kachaner et al. 2012a ) .
while the mechanism is unclear , the finding that the 2 bp - ag insertion variant localizes in the nucleus indicates that the localization determinants reside in the first 148 n - terminal sequences .
this mutation is highly toxic , drastically raising the level of apoptosis in cells ( figure 6 ) .
the cause of cell death , seemingly unrelated to either the golgi or the transferrin uptake defect , remains to be determined .
e478g , a missense mutation in the ubd region , is associated with als .
patients with heterozygous e478g mutation had later onset with slower progression ( ito et al. 2011 ) .
it was suggested that the e478g mutant might have a dominant - negative effect .
consistent with our data , optineurin inclusion bodies were not prominent in the patients .
a mild case of golgi fragmentation was observed ( ito et al. 2011 ; figure 4 ) .
the e478g mutation in the ubd domain may conceivably interfere with nf - kappab and anti - viral signaling , leading to pathology under stress conditions such as inflammation and pathogen invasion .
it is on the other hand , unclear why mutation d474n , also at the ubd domain very close to the e478g mutation , does not manifest any phenotypes and is not disease - associated so far .
again , a detailed , high - resolution 3 - dimensional optineurin structure will be required for a clearer perspective .
rgc5 , an immortalized cell line established by transforming postnatal day 1 rat retinal cells with e1a adenovirus ( aoun et al .
2003 ; agarwal 2013 ) has been used widely and extensively as a model of rgc for various investigations ( harvey and chintala 2007 ; yang et al. 2009 ) .
a re - characterization by van bergen et al .
( 2009 ) utilizing both mitochondrial and nuclear dna analysis however led to the conclusion that this cell line was of mouse origin rather than rat .
more recently , an investigation by the original rgc5 cell line creator krishnamoorthy et al .
( 2013 ) presented evidence indicating that the rgc5 cell line shared approximately 95 % ( 60 / 63 of total ) of genetic markers with a mouse derived photoreceptor cell line ( 661w ) .
in the present study , in addition to rgc5 cells , we also evaluated the foci formation and golgi fragmentation phenotypes in a mouse brain neuroblastoma neuro2a cell line .
results similar to those from rgc5 cells were observed ( figure 3 ) .
previously , our group has likewise demonstrated optineurin phenotypes in other wild type and e50k optineurin - expressing cells including human retinal pigment epithelial , human trabecular meshwork and rat neuronal pc12 cells ( park et al. 20062010 ; koga et al. 2010 ; shen et al. 2011 ) .
we thus surmise that the phenotypes may not be cell type dependent , but likely represent cellular changes induced by optineurin expression or mutations .
in summary , the current study correlates the biologic consequences with structural elements in the optineurin gene .
lending support to previous investigations , our results depict that optineurin exerts different functions and impacts various biologic processes through interactions with other proteins .
the study provides clues as to what regions of the gene may play a critical role in the development of pathologic consequences .
it also underscores the need of x - ray crystallography work for the 3 - dimensional structure to analyze conformational changes in relation to biomolecular functional consequences induced by mutations or truncations .

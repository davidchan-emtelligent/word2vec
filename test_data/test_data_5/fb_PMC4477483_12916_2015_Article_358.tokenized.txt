acbstract background inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 ( pcsk9 ) has been intensively studied to lower low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) levels .
the purpose of this meta - analysis was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti - pcsk9 antibodies in randomized , controlled trials ( rcts ) .
methods pubmed , embase , central databases , and recent conferences were searched .
safety outcomes were rates of common adverse events .
efficacy outcomes included percentages of ldl - c lowering and other lipid changes compared with placebo and ezetimibe , respectively .
results twenty - five rcts encompassing 12,200 patients were included .
the rates of common adverse events were firstly reported in our study by pooling together all evidence in rcts , showing largely no significant difference between anti - pcsk9 antibodies and placebo ( or ezetimibe ) , except that alirocumab was associated with reduced rates of death ( relative risk ( rr ) : 0.43 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.19 to 0.96 , p = 0.04 ) and an increased rate of injection - site reactions ( rr : 1.48 , 95 % ci : 1.05 to 2.09 , p = 0.02 ) ; evolocumab reduced the rate of abnormal liver function ( rr : 0.43 , 95 % ci : 0.20 to 0.93 , p = 0.03 ) , both compared with placebo .
no significant difference in safety outcomes was detected between monthly 420 mg and biweekly 140 mg evolocumab treatments .
monthly 420 mg evolocumab treatment significantly reduced ldl - c by - 54.6 % ( 95 % ci : - 58.7 to - 50.5 %) and by absolute - 78.9 mg / dl ( 95 % ci : - 88.9 to - 68.9 mg / dl ) versus placebo , and by - 36.3 % ( 95 % ci : - 38.8 to - 33.9 %) versus ezetimibe , and increased high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) by 7.6 % ( 95 % ci : 5.7 to 9.5 %) versus placebo and 6.4 % ( 95 % ci : 4.3 to 8.4 %) versus ezetimibe .
an equal or even greater change was observed following biweekly 140 mg administration .
significant and favorable changes were also detected in other lipids following evolocumab treatment .
biweekly 50 to 150 mg alirocumab lowered ldl - c by - 52.6 % ( 95 % ci : - 58.2 to - 47.0 %) versus placebo , by - 29.9 % ( 95 % ci : - 32.9 to - 26.9 %) versus ezetimibe , and increased hdl - c by 8.0 % ( 95 % ci : 4.2 to 11.7 %) versus placebo .
conclusions evolocumab and alirocumab were safe and well - tolerated from our most - powered analyses .
both antibodies substantially reduced the ldl - c level by over 50 % , increased the hdl - c level , and resulted in favorable changes in other lipids .

keywords pcsk9 monoclonal antibody evolocumab alirocumab safety efficacy ldl - c meta - analysis randomized controlled trials issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) [ 1 ] .
the introduction of statins has substantially reduced cvd events around the world and is recommended as first - line therapy for cvd management [ 2 ] .
however , a necessity for other lipid - lowering ( especially low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) lowering ) agents still exists because some patients cannot tolerate statins due to adverse events , or cannot achieve intensive ldl - c lowering because of extremely high baseline ldl - c levels , or patients with very high risk of cvd events need more intensive lowering therapy [ 3 ] .
the role of proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 ( pcsk9 ) in cholesterol regulation has been established since pcsk9 mutations were first discovered in autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia ( adh ) in 2003 [ 4 ] .
pcsk9 binds to ldl receptors ( ldlr ) and facilitates the degradation of ldlrs [ 5 ] and thus leads to ldl - c increase , indicating great therapeutic potential .
therefore , inhibiting pcsk9 by monoclonal antibodies [ 6 , 7 ] , small interfering rna [ 8 ] , and small molecule inhibitors [ 9 ] has been evaluated to lower ldl - c levels in human studies during the last few years .
however , a comprehensive analysis of the safety of anti - pcsk9 antibodies is absent , and efficacy outcomes on lipid profiles are not uniformly consistent .
therefore , we performed a comprehensive review of the current available evidence to address the safety ( to provide the exact rates of common adverse events ) and the efficacy ( to determine the exact extent of lipid changing effect ) of anti - pcsk9 antibodies .
methods literature search we sought to identify all randomized , controlled trials ( rcts ) evaluating the safety and efficacy of pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies .
we searched pubmed , embase , and the cochrane central register of controlled trials ( central ) from their inception to 6 october 2014 , using the following search terms and key words : ' amg 145 ' , ' evolocumab ' , ' sar236553 ' , ' regn727x ' , ' sar236553 / regn727 ' , ' alirocumab ' and ' pcsk9 ' .
reference lists of the identified reports and relevant reviews were manually checked .
major conference proceedings were searched to retrieve unpublished studies until the end of the american heart association ( aha ) scientific sessions on 20 november 2014 .
we did not apply any restriction on languages .
study selection eligibility assessment was performed by two investigators ( xz and qz ) .
studies were included if they : 1 ) were rcts ; 2 ) involved human subjects ; 3 ) evaluated the safety and efficacy of an anti - pcsk9 antibody ( evolocumab or alirocumab ) ; and 4 ) reported mean differences with corresponding confidence intervals ( cis ) or provided data necessary to calculate such .
we did not restrict the type of study populations .
we excluded animal studies , studies which were not randomized , and studies using other anti - pcsk9 antibodies , such as bococizumab , or pcsk9 inhibitors such as small interfering rna because of the limited number of trials published regarding these pcsk9 inhibitors .
outcomes the safety outcomes were rates of common adverse events , and the primary efficacy endpoints were percent and absolute reductions in ldl - c following anti - pcsk9 antibody treatment .
secondary outcomes included : 1 ) ldl - c reduction at 52 weeks follow - up for evolocumab ; 2 ) other lipid profile changes stratified by treatment dosages and durations of follow - up. data collection data were abstracted independently by two reviewers ( xz and qz ) using a standardized data extraction form .
when there were disagreements , a third reviewer ( lz ) checked the data .
the following information was extracted : trial name / first author , year of publication , number of patients , duration of follow - up , age , gender , race , diabetes mellitus , coronary heart disease ( chd ) , pcsk9 level and all lipid profiles at baseline .
patient profile and background lipid - lowering therapy , treatments and doses in each study were also recorded .
for safety endpoints , we extracted the number of events of interest and total number of patients in each group .
for efficacy outcomes , as a priority , we extracted the mean differences and their corresponding 95 % cis or standard errors ( ses ) of anti - pcsk9 antibody versus placebo or ezetimibe for each lipid items .
alternatively , mean changes and 95 % cis ( or ses ) from baseline after either anti - pcsk9 antibody or placebo ( or ezetimibe ) treatments were extracted , thereafter mean differences of anti - pcsk9 antibody versus controls were calculated .
quality assessment we followed the cochrane collaboration 's tool to assess the risk of bias of included trials .
random sequence generation ( selection bias ) , allocation concealment ( selection bias ) , blinding of participants and personnel ( performance bias ) , blinding of outcome assessment ( detection bias ) , incomplete outcome data ( attrition bias ) , selective reporting ( reporting bias ) and other sources of bias were included in the assessment independently performed by two reviewers ( qz and lz ) .
statistical analysis for all efficacy outcomes , the mean differences following anti - pcsk9 treatment versus placebo or ezetimibe were pooled across studies using the dersimonian - laird random - effects models .
comparisons of anti - pcsk9 antibodies with placebo or ezetimibe were performed separately and stratified by dosages of antibodies .
adverse event rates were also pooled with random - effects models .
trials in which the endpoint was not detected in any of the treatment groups were excluded in the analysis of that endpoint .
for studies in which only one of the groups had no event of interest , the estimate of treatment effect and its confidence interval were calculated after adding 0.5 to each cell of the 2 x 2 table for the trial [ 10 , 11 ] .
we used the i2 statistic to assess the consistency across studies , with 25 % , 50 % , and 75 % indicating low , moderate , and high degrees of heterogeneity respectively .
meanwhile , the chi2 - based q test was applied , and a p > 0.10 suggests significant heterogeneity .
begg 's test and egger 's test were performed to assess publication bias .
sensitivity analyses were carried out by omitting one study at one time to evaluate the consistency of the results .
in the laplace - 2 trial [ 7 ] , efficacy data comparing evolocumab and ezetimibe were only reported in five subgroups stratified by background lipid - lowering therapies .
we combined the results from these subgroups into a single group using the formulae recommended by the cochrane collaboration [ 12 ] .
all analyses were conducted with the stata version 11.0 software ( stata corporation , college station , tx , usa ) .
the meta - analysis was in line with recommendations from the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analyses ( prisma ) statement ( additional file 1 ) .
results study selection and characteristics our systematic literature search yielded 273 studies .
after excluding duplicate publications and studies which clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria based on titles and abstracts , 22 studies were retrieved for full - text review .
six studies were further excluded , in which one study was not rct [ 13 ] and two were phase 1 trials with either non - constant dosage of anti - pcsk9 antibodies or with too few participants [ 14,15 ] .
nine additional studies were identified in the recent conference of the european society of cardiology ( esc ) and aha , and were included in the meta - analysis [ 16 - 22 ] ( fig. 1 ) .
during the revision process of this paper , two of the trials ( odyssey long term and odyssey comb ii trials ) included in our analysis as conference presentations [ 16 , 18 ] from 2014 aha and esc scientific sessions were published [ 23 , 24 ] .
thus , 25 studies were included , encompassing a total of 12,200 patients .
twelve trials were conducted using anti - pcsk9 antibody evolocumab ( amg 145 ) [ 7 , 25 - 35 ] , and 13 were on alirocumab ( sar236553 / regn727 ) [ 16 - 22 , 36 - 39 ] .
the osler study was carried out based on participants from four parent trials ( gauss , mendel , laplace - timi 57 , and rutherford ) and was followed up for 52 weeks [ 30 ]. fig. 1 flow diagram for study selection baseline characteristics of individual trials are shown in table 1 and table s1 and s2 ( in additional file 2 ) .
several studies did not report age , lipids or pcsk9 level in the overall population .
therefore , we presented these characteristics in control populations ( placebo or ezetimibe ) in these studies given the significantly similar baseline values between the anti - pcsk9 treatment group and controls .
all randomized trials included were published or presented in major conferences between 2012 and 2014 .
the mean age ranged from 31 to 62 years , and the percentage of women from 37 to 74 ; over 80 % of the patients were white .
regarding evolocumab , all trials were followed up for 12 weeks , except the osler and descartes trials [ 25 , 30 ] , which were followed up for 52 weeks. with regard to alirocumab , most trials were followed up for 24 weeks except three phase 2 trials which were followed - up for 8 to 12 weeks [ 36 , 37 , 39 ] .
all included rcts had a low risk of bias , as detailed in table s3 ( in additional file 2 ) .

serious teae occurred in 1.9 % patients , teaes leading to discontinuation in 1.6 % patients at 12 weeks following evolocumab treatment .
only 1 in 3,068 patients died at 12 weeks follow - up and 3 in 1,335 patients at 52 weeks follow - up , which were all similar to control groups ( table 2 ) .
sixteen in 2,797 , 12 in 2,797 , and 20 in 2,287 patients developed creatine kinase ( ck ) elevations greater than five times the upper limit of normal ( uln ) , elevations in aspartate aminotransferase / alanine aminotransferase ( ast / alt ) levels greater than three times the uln , and adjudicated cardiovascular events respectively .
patients receiving evolocumab had a lower risk of developing abnormal liver function ( ast / alt greater than three times uln ) than those receiving placebo at 12 - week follow - up ( rr : 0.43 , 95 % ci : 0.20 to 0.93 , p = 0.03 ) , but the difference did not maintain at 52 - week follow - up. the pooled incidence of musculoskeletal and connective - tissue disorders was 9.8 % ( 95 % ci : 4.1 to 15.4 %) , which was not significantly different with placebo ( pooled rate : 7.1 % ; 95 % ci : 1.6 to 12.6 %) ( rr 1.08 , 95 % ci : 0.70 to 1.67 ) or ezetimibe ( pooled rate : 6.1 % ; 95 % ci : 0.7 to 11.5 %) ( rr 1.10 , 95 % ci : 0.61 to 2.00 ) .

there was significant heterogeneity in both comparisons ( i2 = 80.4 % and 93.9 % , respectively ) .
biweekly administration of 140 mg evolocumab led to even greater reduction than 420 mg monthly treatment , both of which reduced the ldl - c level by over 50 % .
the effect is likely dose - dependent with the same frequency of administration .
likewise , in absolute level changes , 420 mg monthly and 140 mg biweekly dosing lowered ldl - c by - 78.9 mg / dl ( 95 % ci : - 88.9 to - 68.9 mg / dl ) and - 81.6 mg / dl ( 95 % ci : - 92.0 to - 71.1 mg / dl ) , respectively ( additional file 2 : figure s1 and table s4 ). fig. 2 pooled analysis for percent changes in ldl - c following evolocumab treatments stratified by dosages versus placebo at 12 weeks follow - up. evo , evolocumab ; pbo , placebo .

no significant heterogeneity was detected in the comparisons ( i2 = 0 and 28.4 % , respectively ) .
fewer studies reported absolute changes of ldl - c level versus ezetimibe ; meta - analyses of these studies demonstrated largely similar but less remarkable results compared with those versus placebo. fig. 3 pooled analysis for percent changes in ldl - c following evolocumab treatments stratified by dosages versus ezetimibe at 12 weeks follow - up. evo , evolocumab ; eze , ezetimibe .
ldl - c , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl - c percent and absolute changes at the mean of weeks 10 and 12 following evolocumab treatments versus placebo or ezetimibe were all significant and similar to those changes at week 12 ( additional file 2 : table s5 ) .
other efficacy outcomes of evolocumab all dosages except monthly 280 mg evolocumab treatment significantly increased high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) levels at week 12 compared with placebo .
the hdl - c level was increased by 7.6 % ( 95 % ci : 5.7 to 9.5 %) and 6.9 % ( 95 % ci : 5.4 to 8.4 %) by monthly 420 mg and biweekly 140 mg evolocumab treatment , respectively ( fig. 4 and additional file 2 : table s6 ) .
no significant heterogeneity was detected in the comparisons ( i2 = 23.3 % and 0 , respectively ) .
these two dosages of evolocumab also increased the hdl - c level compared with ezetimibe by 6.4 % ( 95 % ci : 4.3 to 8.4 %) and 7.2 % ( 95 % ci : 4.4 to 10.0 %) , with no significant heterogeneity ( i2 = 0 and 32.2 % , respectively ). fig. 4 pooled analysis for percent changes in hdl - c following evolocumab treatments stratified by dosages versus placebo at 12 weeks follow - up. evo , evolocumab ; pbo , placebo .

no significant heterogeneity was found ( i2 = 0 for both comparisons ) ( fig. 5b ) .
meta - analyses of other efficiency outcomes demonstrated reduction in tc , non - hdl - c , apob , and lp ( a ) , and an increase in apoa1 following alirocumab treatment , which are shown in table s17 ( in additional file 2 ) .
no significant publication bias was found in most analyses , detailed in each table in additional file 2 .
sensitivity analyses did not generated inconsistent results .
discussion for the first time we provide in our study the rates of common adverse events following pcsk - 9 antibody treatments by enrolling the largest sample size of patients and thus offering the most robust power , and detected largely no significant difference in major adverse events rates between antibody administration and control treatment , and no difference between different dosages of evolocumab .
notably , evolocumab reduced the rate of abnormal liver function , and alirocumab was associated with reduced rates of death and abnormal kidney function .
meanwhile , we determined the extent of ldl - c lowering of anti - pcsk9 antibodies : ldl - c level was reduced by over 50 % even though patients were on stable statin treatment .
the extents of other favorable lipids changes were also documented in our meta - analyses .
it is worth noting that the favorable effects of anti - pcsk9 antibodies were largely achieved in populations who were already on stable statin treatments , indicating an additive , or even synergistic effect to statin in lowering ldl - c levels .
this is not a surprise because statin therapy has been well documented to increase pcsk9 levels [ 40 ] ; thus , inhibiting pcsk9 might enhance the ldl - c lowering effects of statins .
indeed , missense mutations in pcsk9 increased response to statin therapy in unrelated hypocholesterolemic subjects and familial hypercholesterolemia patients [ 41 ] .
likewise , in our meta - analysis , the combination of anti - pcsk9 antibody and statin resulted in a very high - intensity ldl - lowering effect , which is recommended by the 2013 american college of cardiology ( acc )/ aha guideline suggesting no ldl - c goals .
meta - analyses of rcts on statins also demonstrated that further reductions in ldl - c produce definite further reductions in cvd events [ 42 ] , even in people at low risk of cvds [ 43 ] .
two fundamental elements could lead to safety concerns : firstly those due to monoclonal antibody administration and secondly due to achieving very low ldl - c levels .
we were unable to obtain the mean ldl - c level at the end of antibody administration due to lack of patient - level data in our study .
however , estimated lowest ldl - c levels from observations of each study were less than 50 mg / dl , which was more remarkable than those achieved in the recently presented improve - it trial ( improved reduction of outcomes : vytorin efficacy international trial ) [ 44 ] .
a combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe led to a mean ldl - c level as low as 53.2 mg / dl at one - year follow - up in high - risk patients with acute coronary syndrome , but showed good safety outcomes , indicating that an even lower level of ldl - c might not result in safety concerns .
this notion was further confirmed by two recently published trials with regard to both evolocumab and alirocumab , with a longer follow - up of approximately 12 months [ 23 , 45 ] .
the osler trial , an extension trial of several phase 2 and phase 3 parent trials ( most of which were included in our meta - analysis ) , showed similar rates of adverse events in patients with ldl - c levels less than 40 mg / dl or less than 25 mg / dl as in those with higher ldl - c levels following evolocumab treatment [ 45 ] .
the full - term follow - up of the odyssey long term trial also revealed similar frequency of adverse events among patients who had a ldl - c level less than 25 mg / dl and those who did not [ 23 ] .
more straightforwardly in our meta - analysis , administration of both anti - pcsk9 antibodies showed promising safety profiles , except that administration of alirocumab was associated with a higher rate of injection - site reactions. whether anti - pcsk9 antibody treatments could translate into improved cardiovascular outcomes remains to be confirmed .
the ongoing fourier ( nct01764633 ) and odyssey outcomes ( nct01663402 ) trials will answer this question by assessing the effect of evolocumab and alirocumab on major cvd events with about five years follow - up. however , the probable clinical benefits could be preliminarily inferred based on current evidence : 1 ) anti - pcsk9 antibodies substantially reduced ldl - c , non - hdl - c and apob levels , all of which are positively associated with cvd events [ 46 ] , and ' a lower ldl - c , a better outcome ' has been indicated not only in the era of statins but also following combined use of statins and ezetimibe [ 44 ] ; 2 ) anti - pcsk9 antibodies significantly increased hdl - c and apoa1 levels , which are strongly associated with reduced cvd risk , even in patients achieving very low ldl - c [ 47 ] ; 3 ) in the aric study , loss - of - function pcsk9 mutations resulted in 28 % ( 15 %) reduction in ldl - c , and 88 % ( 47 %) reduction in chd risk in african - americans ( white people ) [ 48 ] ; combined analyses in other cohort studies also generated 30 % reduction in ischemic heart disease risk [ 49 ] ; and 4 ) more direct evidence from the longer - term follow - up results of the osler and odyssey long term trials , although with a limitation of exploratory analysis , both of these trials suggested that patients receiving anti - pcsk9 antibodies had a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events , which is consistent with our study showing alirocumab reduced the rates of death .
notably , both trials demonstrated that the cumulative incidence curves diverged progressively over time ; therefore , a more remarkable benefit might be expected given a longer - term follow - up. provided the exploratory nature of these trials , the limited follow - up length and the small number of cardiovascular events , results from ongoing fourier ( over 27,500 high - risk patients with cardiovascular disease ) and odyssey outcomes trials ( over 18,000 patients who have experienced an acute coronary syndrome event 4 to 52 weeks prior to randomization ) are urgently needed to provide definite answers .
study limitations first , the meta - analysis was based on study - level instead of patient - level data .
second , a high level of heterogeneity exists in several analyses .
heterogeneities in patient profile ( unrelated or familial hypercholesterolemia ) and background lipid - lowering therapy ( maximum - tolerated statin , statin - intolerance , or no background anti - lipid therapy ) are likely to account for part of this heterogeneity .
we performed subgroup analyses based on the type of study population and heterogeneity still existed ( data not show ) .
therefore , we pooled these data with random - effects models .
third , additional ongoing trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of alirocumab are to be published in a few years .
however , with respect to primary efficacy endpoint , dramatic upregulating - ldl effects needed to be reported to balance the lowering - ldl effects demonstrated in our study given the number of patients known to have participated in these ongoing trials ( odyssey choice i , odyssey ole , and so on ) , which is unlikely .
fourth , with respect to analysis on safety profiles , wide - range 95 % cis were observed in several endpoints , which made precise estimation of the incidences of these endpoints impossible .
meanwhile , several composite endpoints were included in our study , such as adjudicated cardiovascular events , which might lower the ability of detecting each individual endpoint .
fifth , most trials included in our study had a relatively short - term follow - up ( 12 and 52 weeks for evolocumab , and mostly 24 weeks for alirocumab ) , thus rare events could not be fully revealed .
sixth , we could not rule out bias of selective reporting on several safety outcomes ; to minimize this bias , we reviewed all the materials ( including supplementary materials and relevant publications in other papers ) provided by these studies and extracted and analyzed all these data .
notably , no obvious selective reporting bias was detected in major safety endpoints , such as any teaes , serious teaes , abnormal liver function , abnormal kidney function , injection - site reactions , musculoskeletal disorders and so on. seventh , most patients enrolled are white ; therefore , caution should be taken to interpret in other populations .
conclusions evolocumab and alirocumab were safe and well - tolerated , largely showing no significant differences in rates of common adverse events with placebo or ezetimibe controls .
no difference was detected following different dosages of evolocumab treatments regarding safety profiles .
both anti - pcsk9 antibodies substantially reduced ldl - c by over 50 % , increased hdl - c levels , and resulted in favorable changes in other lipids .
we await the results of ongoing trials evaluating their effects on cvd events .

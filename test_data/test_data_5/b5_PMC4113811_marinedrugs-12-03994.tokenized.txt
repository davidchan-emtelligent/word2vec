lectins exist widely in marine bioresources such as bacteria , algae , invertebrate animals and fishes .
some purified marine lectins have been found to elicit cytotoxicity to cancer cells .
however , there are few reports describing the cytotoxic effect of marine lectins on cancer cells through virus - mediated gene delivery .
we show here that a replication - deficient adenovirus - carrying gene encoding haliotis discus discus sialic acid binding lectin ( ad.flag - hddsbl ) suppressed cancer cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis , as compared to the control virus ad.flag .
a down - regulated level of anti - apoptosis factor bcl - 2 was suggested to be responsible for the apoptosis induced by ad.flag - hddsbl infection .
further subcellular localization studies revealed that hddsbl distributed in cell membrane , er , and the nucleus , but not in mitochondria and golgi apparatus .
in contrast , a previously reported mannose - binding lectin pinellia pedatisecta agglutinin entered the nucleus as well , but did not distribute in inner membrane systems , suggesting differed intracellular sialylation and mannosylation , which may provide different targets for lectin binding .
further cancer - specific controlling of hddsbl expression and animal studies may help to provide insights into a novel way of anti - cancer marine lectin gene therapy .
lectins may provide a reservoir of anti - cancer genes .
haliotis discus discus sialic acid binding lectin adenoviruses apoptosis bcl - 2 1 .
introduction lectins are carbohydrate - binding proteins which have become useful tools for recognizing a variety of cell types due to their carbohydrate recognition specificity [ 1,2 ] .
some lectins such as maackia amurensis seed lectin [ 3 ] , concanavalin a [ 4 ] , and polygonatum cyrtonema lectin [ 5 ] elicit anticancer effect by inducing apoptosis or autophagy , whereas a mannose - binding plant lectin pinellia pedatisecta agglutinin ( ppa ) preferentially recognizes drug resistant k562 / adr leukemia cells through binding with sarcolemmal membrane associated protein , and enhances the phagocytosis of k562 / adr by macrophages [ 6 ] .
furthermore , through gene delivery , ppa induces cancer cell death through interacting with the methylosome that contains protein arginine methyltransferase 5 and methylosome protein 50 [ 7 ] .
sialic acid - binding lectins ( sbls ) , widely exist in plant and animals , and comprise a large family of lectins showing sialic acid binding activity and various biological functions .
to date , most studies of sbls were performed in animal adhesion molecules siglecs [ 8 ] , which are expressed on the cell membrane of various immune cells including macrophages [ 9,10 ] , b cells [ 11 ] , neutrophils [ 12 ] , as well as some cancer cells [ 13,14 ] .
siglecs regulate various immune responses .
for example , siglec - 1 is a macrophage restricted cell surface receptor and contributes to sialylated pathogen uptake , antigen presentation , and cytokine production [ 15 ] .
siglec - e selectively regulates neutrophil recruitment during acute inflammation [ 12 ] .
cd22 ( siglec - 2 ) is expressed on b cells and dendritic cells , and regulates b cell receptor signaling , cell survival , proliferation , antibody production , as well as cd8 + t cell regulation [ 11,16 ] .
the cd33 - related siglecs are expressed primarily on leukocytes in a cell type - specific manner and are involved in modulation of inflammatory and immune responses [ 17 ] .
meanwhile , siglecs such as cd22 and cd33 expressed on malignant cells have become therapeutic targets for a variety of cancer types , such as lung cancer [ 13 ] and leukemia [ 14,18,19,20 ] .
in addition to siglecs , some other sbls from plant and animals have been purified and characterized , including sbls isolated from polygonatum cyrtonema [ 21 ] , frogs rana catesbeiana and rana japonica oocytes [ 22 ] , razor clam solen grandis [ 23 ] , and manila clam venerupis philippinarum [ 24 ] .
anticancer effects have been suggested for some of these sbls , such as egg lectins from frogs rana catesbeiana and rana japonica [ 22,25,26 ] , as well as polygonatum cyrtonema lectin [ 5,27 ] .
gene delivery of exogenous lectins through viral vectors may provide an alternative way to induce cancer cell death [ 7 ] .
however , at the present , there are few reports describing the cytotoxic effect of marine lectins on cancer cells through virus - mediated gene delivery .
in this work , a gene encoding haliotis discus discus sialic acid binding lectin ( hddsbl ) was genetically inserted into an adenoviral vector to form a recombinant adenovirus ad.flag - hddsbl .
the cytotoxicity of ad.flag - hddsbl on cancer cells was analyzed .
furthermore , to analyze the underlying mechanism of the hddsbl induced cytotoxicity , the subcellular distribution of hddsbl in cancer cells was investigated through transfection of cells with plasmid pegfp - hddsbl - c1 , followed by observation under a confocal laser scanning microscope .
2. results and discussion to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of exogenous hddsbl , cancer cells including hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hep3b , lung cancer cell lines a549 and h1299 , as well as colorectal carcinoma cell line sw480 were treated with ad.flag - hddsbl or the control adenovirus ad.flag .
as compared to ad.flag , ad.flag - hddsbl significantly suppressed the in vitro proliferation of these cancer cells , as determined by mtt assay ( figure 1 ) .
the suppressive effect of ad.flag - hddsbl on cancer cells took place in a dose - and cell line - dependent manner .
data indicated the cytotoxicity of exogenous hddsbl on various cancer cells , and the differential effect of hddsbl may be due to varied forms of intracellular sialic acids modification .
figure 1 ad.flag - hddsbl suppressed cancer cell proliferation .
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines hep3b , lung cancer cell line a549 and h1299 , as well as colorectal cancer cell line sw480 were treated with ad.flag , ad.flag - hddsbl at 1 , 5 , 10 , or 20 multiplicity of infections ( mois ) for 96 h. cell viability was analyzed through mtt assay .
values from at least six repeats were calculated as percent of pbs control and presented as mean +/ - sem .
* p < 0.05 .
to investigate the mechanism of hddsbl induced cytotoxicity , hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hep3b was treated with pbs , ad.flag , or ad.flag - hddsbl , followed by observation under a microscope , as well as staining with annexin v - fitc and propidium iodide ( pi ) , a common method for apoptotic cell staining , and analyzing under a flow cytometer .
typical morphological change resulting from apoptosis was observed in cells treated with ad.flag - hddsbl ( figure 2a ) .
figure 2b showed that ad.flag - hddsbl induced a higher percent of annexin v +/ pi - and annexin v +/ pi + cells , as compared to the cells treated with either pbs or ad.flag .
significant differences achieved from three repeats were shown in figure 2c .
results indicate that exogenous expression of hddsbl induced apoptosis in hep3b liver cancer cells .
figure 2 ad.flag - hddsbl induced apoptosis in hep3b cells .
hep3b cells treated with ad.flag or ad.flag - hddsbl at 20 moi as well as pbs control for 48 h .
( a ) morphology of apoptosis induced by ad.flag - hddsbl ( bars : 200 mum ) ; ( b ) cells were stained with annexin v - fitc and pi followed by analysis under a flow cytometer ; ( c ) the percent of annexin v - positive cells from three repeats were shown as mean +/ - sem (* p < 0.05 ) ; ( d ) cell lysates were analyzed by western blot for levels of bcl - 2 , xiap , and parp .
gapdh served as the loading control .
to analyze the underlying mechanism of apoptosis induced by ad.flag - hddsbl , hep3b cells treated with ad.flag - hddsbl , ad.flag , or pbs were lysed , and apoptotic signaling elements were investigated by western blot .
as shown in figure 2d , compared to pbs and ad.flag controls , ad.flag - hddsbl even prohibited the cleavage of poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) , a substrate for various caspases , suggesting that ad.flag - hddsbl possibly did not induce apoptosis through activating caspases .
however , ad.flag - hddsbl significantly suppressed levels of anti - apoptosis factor bcl - 2 .
the densitometry analysis showed that the band density of bcl - 2 adjusted by gapdh were 0.7 +/ - 0.09 , 0.91 +/ - 0.05 , and 0.87 +/ - 0.06 for ad.flag - hddsbl , pbs , and ad.flag , respectively ( ad.flag - hddsbl vs. pbs or ad.flag : p < 0.05 ) .
another anti - apoptosis element x - linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein ( xiap ) was not apparently altered by ad.flag - hddsbl .
data suggested that exogenous expression of hddsbl induced apoptosis in hep3b cells through down - regulating anti - apoptosis factor bcl - 2 .
intracellular distribution of hddsbl was investigated to further study the underlying mechanism of the hddsbl induced apoptosis .
liver cancer cells hep3b or bel - 7404 were transfected with plasmids pegfp - hddsbl - c1 , followed by subcellular staining and observation under a confocal laser scanning microscope .
as shown in figure 3a - d , distribution of hddsbl was observed in the cell membrane and er , but not in the mitichondria and golgi apparatus .
interestingly , at a late stage , hddsbl entered the pi high staining area ( figure 3e ) , suggesting the entrance of hddsbl into the nucleus .
figure 3 subcellular distribution of hddsbl .
hep3b or bel - 7404 cells were transfected with pegfp - hddsbl - c1 .
cells were then stained with dii ( a ) ; mito tracker red mitochondrion - selective probe ( b ) ; golgi - tracker red ( c ) ; er - tracker red ( d ) ; and pi ( e ) ; followed by analysis under a confocal laser scanning microscope .
bars show 20 mum .
the diagrams are representative of at least four repeats .
we previously determined that mannose - binding lectin ppa also entered the nucleus and induced cell death [ 7 ] .
therefore , plasmid pegfp - ppa - c1 was transfected into hep3b cells , and the distribution of ppa was examined as well .
as shown in figure 4a - d , although slight location of ppa on the cell membrane was detected , the majority of ppa did not distribute in the inner membrane systems , including mitochondria , er , and golgi apparatus .
the entrance of ppa into the nucleus was verified by analysis under a confocal laser scanning microscope ( figure 4e ) .
the different distribution of hddsbl and ppa suggested their different interactions with intracellular molecules such as carbohydrates and proteins .
figure 4 subcellular distribution of ppa .
hep3b or bel - 7404 cells were transfected with pegfp - hddsbl - c1 .
cells were then stained with dii ( a ) ; mito tracker red mitochondrion - selective probe ( b ) ; golgi - tracker red ( c ) ; er - tracker red ( d ) ; and pi ( e ) ; followed by analysis under a confocal laser scanning microscope .
bars show 20 mum .
the diagrams are representative of at least four repeats .
the subcellular localization studies showed that hddsbl and ppa distributed differently in cell membrane and cytoplasm .
glycans are linked and modified to proteins and lipids by glycosyltransferases and glycosidases in secretory pathways , which play important roles in regulating cell adhesion , molecular trafficking , and signal transduction [ 28 ] .
since lectins are carbohydrate - specific proteins , the varied distribution of these two lectins may suggest different sialylation and mannosylation patterns on subcellular organelles .
the distribution of hddsbl may reflect high levels of terminal sialic acids on the cell membrane and er , as well as the nucleus , whereas the ppa collocalization with dna may reflect a low level of terminal mannose in cytoplasm but a high level of terminal mannose in the nucleus .
sialic acid is a nine - carbon sugar , naturally occurring as the terminal carbohydrate residues , involved in various biological functions .
many studies have demonstrated that cell surface sialic acids play an important role for the attachment and infection of viruses [ 29,30,31,32,33 ] .
however , sialic acids were also found in regulating various cellular functions .
for example , cell surface alpha2,3 - and alpha2,6 - sialic acid determinants were correlated with pancreatic carcinoma cell migration [ 34 ] .
the terminal sialic acids decreased on the cell surface of apoptotic lymphocytes , and induced a signal for macrophage phagocytosis [ 35 ] .
the absence of sialylation and exposure of galactose residues on the surface of platelets resulted in recognition and clearance by macrophages and hepatocytes [ 36 ] .
in addition to the role of recognition molecules , sialic acids also acted as an intracellular signaling molecule regulating cell proliferation and differentiation [ 37 ] .
therefore , intracellular expression of sialic acid - binding lectins may interfere with many cell membrane and cytoplasmic signaling molecules , leading to diversified biological outcomes .
in our data , exogenous hddsbl was found to be distributed in the cell membrane , er , and the nucleus .
the binding of hddsbl to carbohydrate chains with sialic acid terminal residues in these sites may interfere with various signaling pathways , as well as glaycosylation processes .
previously , a binding of intracellular polysialic acid antigens by a monoclonal antibody induced apoptosis in human cancer cell lines [ 38 ] .
we further determined that the exogenous expression of a sialic acid - binding lectin hddsbl down - regulated anti - apoptotic factor bcl - 2 and led to cell apoptosis .
these studies demonstrated that not only that sialic acids distributed on the extracellular domain of cell membrane receptors such as podoplanin [ 3 ] , but also that intracellular sialic acids could provide therapeutic targets for various cancer cells .

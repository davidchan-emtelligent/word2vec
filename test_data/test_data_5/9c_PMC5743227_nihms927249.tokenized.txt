purpose of review the vision and strategy for the 21st century treatment of cancer calls for a personalized approach in which therapy selection is designed for each individual patient .
while genomics has led the field of personalized cancer medicine over the past several decades by connecting patient - specific dna mutations with kinase - targeted drugs , the recent discovery that tumors evade immune surveillance has created unique challenges to personalize cancer immunotherapy .
in this mini - review we will discuss how personalized medicine has evolved recently to accommodate the emerging era of cancer immunotherapy .
moreover , we will discuss novel platform technologies that have been engineered to address some of the persisting limitations .
recent finding beginning with early evidence in personalized medicine , we discuss how biomarker - driven approaches to predict clinical success have evolved to account for the heterogeneous tumor ecosystem .
in the emerging field of cancer immunotherapy , this challenge requires the use of a novel set of tools , distinct from the classic approach of next - generation genomic sequencing - based strategies .
we will introduce new techniques that seek to tailor immunotherapy by re - programming patient - autologous t - cells , and new technologies that are emerging to predict clinical efficacy by mapping infiltration of lymphocytes , and harnessing fully humanized platforms that reconstruct and interrogate immune checkpoint blockade , ex - vivo .
summary while cancer immunotherapy is now leading to durable outcomes in difficult - to - treat cancers , success is highly variable .
developing novel approaches to study cancer immunotherapy , personalize treatment to each patient , and achieve greater outcomes is penultimate to developing sustainable cures in the future .
numerous techniques are now emerging to help guide treatment decisions , which go beyond simple biomarker - driven strategies , and are now we are seeking to interrogate the entirety of the dynamic tumor ecosystem .
tumor ecosystem cancer immunotherapy precision diagnostics biomarker introduction according to the national cancer institute ( nci ) there were 1,685,210 new cancer diagnoses in 2016 [ 1 ]. with such a high number of patients , effective treatment to halt the progression and / or cure cancer is of primary concern .
traditionally , cancer patients are prescribed a predetermined first line treatment depending on the cancer indication and grade .
as our understanding for the complexity and uniqueness of each individual tumor improves , the suitability of the this ' one - size - fits - all ' approach to cancer therapy is called into question .
precision medicine , the proposed future for the treatment of disease , is based on a tailored approach for selecting therapy at the individual patient level [ 2 ] .
given the high patient - to - patient variability , cancer is a prime candidate for the use of precision medicine .
indeed , it is important that the first line therapy is effective since relapse can reduce 5 - year survival rates by more than 50 % in aggressive cancers [ 3 ] .
it is now clear that the future of personalized cancer treatment will involve a complete biochemical characterization of the tumor using multi - dimensional analyses for a range of biological endpoints , which will lead to a calculated decision on the appropriate treatment .
thus , resulting in significantly improved overall response ( orr ) and overall survival ( os ) rates .
the recent discovery that tumors co - opt immune check - points as a mechanism of escaping immune surveillance has led to a renaissance in immunotherapy , and revolutionized cancer treatment options [ 4,5 ] .
this suggests that inherent patient - specific biology is likely driving responses [ 6,7 ] which is thought to be largely dependent on the global immune system of each individual patient , and not necessarily dependent only on the tumor biology [ 8 ] .
therefore , new technologies are needed that can help predict which patients will benefit from immunotherapy .
while cancer immunotherapy has eliminated terminal disease in some patients , clinical success is highly variable [ 9 ] .
indeed , the emerging paradigm of cancer immunotherapy is bringing with it added complexity to the challenge of personalized cancer medicine , and an answer for it that has yet to be fully elucidated [ 6,7,10 - 13 ] .
effective implementation of personalized cancer medicine is limited by the lack of well - established preclinical models and methods that integrate global tumor heterogeneity , with high fidelity , in terms of the role of cancer and stromal cells , tumor microenvironment , 3 - d architecture , and immune contexture [ 14 ] .
indeed , current ' gold standard ' in - vitro and ex - vivo preclinical approaches that interrogate drugs using cell lines and spheroids [ 15 - 17 ] or ex - vivo organotypic tumor models are all limited by their inability to capture the full biological approximation of the native tumor , resulting in poor mapping to clinical outcomes [ 17 - 20 ] .
here , we will highlight some of the pervading strategies in personalized medicine , and further elucidate how research is moving beyond the " one size fits all " approach to treatment selection .
classic biomarker - based approaches for precision diagnostics discovery of molecular cancer biomarkers ( i.e. , cancer ' addictive ' oncogenes ) has paved the way for the first generation of personalized therapy .
indeed , genomic screening approaches have been commonly employed to identify tumor - specific , overexpressed proteins or genetic mutations that may confer mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in cancer cells [ 21 ] .
targeting these protein biomarkers therapeutically can lead to better clinical outcomes .
for example , antibody and small - molecule inhibitors of specific proteins , such as the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) has led to successful implementation of diagnostic tools like herceptest [ 22,23 ] .
the discovery of her2 overexpression in other indications has led to the approval , in 2010 , of trastuzumab for gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma [ 24 ] .
interestingly , the fda - approval of existing therapies for new indications is common , with the repurposing of thalidomide to treat multiple myeloma being a notable example [ 25,26 ] .
similarly , the overexpression of egfr in various types of cancer was discovered as early as 1997 [ 27 ] .
this led to the development of specific egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( egfr - tkis ) such as gefitinib or afatinib .
however , acquired resistance to these therapies occurs in approximately 60 % of patients treated with first line egfr - tkis [ 28 ] .
it has subsequently been found that a specific mutation of egfr is responsible for this acquired resistance , t790m .
this mutation has also been observed in other types of egfr - tki - resistant lung cancers .
the recently fda approved small molecule inhibitor , osimertinib ( tagrisso ) , is an egrf - tki and is most effective in patients with this acquired egfr mutation , and is used following failure of first line egfr - tki therapies [ 29 ] .
more recently , midostaurin ( rydapt ) , a small molecule inhibitor of vegf , has been approved for use in acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) patients with mutated fms - like tyrosine kinase inhibitor 3 ( flt3 ) [ 30,31 ]. with only 10 % of leukemia patients and 25 % of aml patients presenting with mutations in flt3 , biomarkers are becoming increasingly useful to connect patients to the correct therapy [ 32 ] .
as one example , the companion diagnostic leukostrat cdx flt3 mutation assay , was fda - approved alongside midostaurin in april 2017 , and the phase iii trial showed an improved os rate of 23 % [ 33 ] .
while the biomarker - driven approach for treatment decision making in the clinic usually yields better than standard of care results , with an improvement on orr and os rates , there are currently only 16 drugs out of more than 200 fda - approved agents that require , or benefit from a companion diagnostic test [ 34 ] .
moreover , the emerging generation of new anticancer therapies , which seek to invigorate the body 's own immune system , suggests that new approaches for personalized medicine must evolve .
targeting the immune compartment cytokine stimulation william coley , commonly referred to as one of the pioneers of cancer immunotherapy , recognized the link between a patient 's complete remission from sarcoma with a streptococcus pyogenes infection in 1890 [ 35 ] .
this led to him treating cancer patients with bacteria post - surgery , resulting in an immune response that would keep any tumor resurgence at bay .
although this approach was largely unsuccessful due to the adverse effects of the infection , it demonstrated that activating the immune response could be of therapeutic benefit in cancer .
it was not until 1992 that the first immunotherapy was approved by the fda ; high dose interleukin - 2 ( hd il - 2 ) , for renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) [ 36 ]. from 1986 to 2006 , the nci treated 259 metastatic rcc patients with hd il - 2 .
the objective response rate was just 20 % , with 23 patients achieving a complete response and 30 patients achieving a partial response [ 36 ] .
a similar response rate was observed with hd il - 2 treatment in melanoma , which was fda - approved in 1998 [ 37 ] .
this non - specific immunotherapeutic approach is one of very few therapies that can result in complete remission , albeit in a small cohort of patients .
immune checkpoint inhibitors immune checkpoints are negative regulators of t cell immunity , usually inhibiting the stimulation of t cells .
the primary function of immune checkpoint inhibition is to rescue t cells from exhaustion or deplete t regulatory cells ( treg ) .
indeed , the best characterized immune cells in cancer biology are cd4 + helper t - cells , which exacerbate tumor proliferation , and cytotoxic cd8 + t - cells , which have been shown to prevent tumor growth [ 38 ] .
one of the many receptors involved in immune checkpoints , cytotoxic t - lymphocyte - associated protein 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , discovered in 1987 , modulates the extent of t cell activation by competitively binding to b7 proteins , which are required for stimulation of t cells .
however , it was not until 1996 that targeting ctla - 4 was shown to have anti - cancer effects in mice [ 39 ] .
this seminal study led to the development of the first immune checkpoint inhibitor , ipilimumab ( yervoy ) , an anti - ctla - 4 monoclonal antibody , which was approved in 2011 for metastatic melanoma .
the success of ipilimumab led to the development of even more efficacious immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab ( keytruda ) and nivolumab ( opdivo ) , pd - 1 inhibitors , and atezolizumab ( tecentriq ) a pd - l1 inhibitor .
merck 's pembrolizumab has been particularly successful , being fda - approved for a range of indications , including metastatic melanoma , metastatic non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) and refractory hodgkin 's lymphoma .
a recent report of a phase iii trial showed 10.3 months progression free survival for untreated advanced nsclc treated with pembrolizumab , compared with 6 months for platinum - based chemotherapy [ 40 ] .
moreover , in may 2017 , the fda approved pembrolizumab for the treatment of solid tumors found to be microsatellite instability - high or mismatch repair deficient .
this is the first time the fda has approved a therapy based on a biomarker rather than the location of the cancer , exemplifying the progression of personalized medicine. with 734 on - going clinical trials for immunotherapies combined with other therapies , the clinical potential of immune checkpoint inhibitors is yet to be fully realized .
adoptive cell transfer : personalized t - cell therapy chimeric antigen receptor ( car ) - t cells are an example of adoptive cell transfer ( act ) .
car t cells taken from a patient ( or other human ) are engineered to express cancer - specific antigens ex vivo and are administered back into the patient .
car - t cell therapy has shown efficacy in the treatment of many b cell malignancies , most notably against b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( b - all ) .
in a study with 53 children and young adults with cd19 + all , 50 out of 53 patients went into complete remission following treatment with car - t cells [ 41 ] .
despite these incredible results in liquid cancers , treatment using car - t cells is more difficult in solid tumors , perhaps due to physical and biochemical differences .
in a phase i clinical study , patients with egfr - positive relapsed / refractory nsclc were treated with egfr - targeted car - t cells. of 11 evaluable patients , only two patients showed a partial response and five had stable disease for two to eight months [ 42 ] .
there have been proposed theories to further improve car - t cell therapy such as enhancing the selectivity of the car and using this therapy in conjunction with immune checkpoint inhibitors [ 43 ] .
whilst car - t cell therapy is very promising , there are many noted negative side effects , including the potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome , which also have to be addressed if this therapy is to be adopted for wider use .
another example of act in the clinic is the expansion of patient tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( til ) with il - 2 , ex vivo , with subsequent administration directly into the tumor .
this approach has resulted in promising os rates in the clinic .
it has been used to treat b cell malignancies and melanoma with great success in a small subset of patients .
moreover , in a recent study , 3 out of 9 of metastatic cervical cancer patients treated with human papillomavirus targeted - til responded ; 2 of which experienced complete regression lasting up to 22 months [ 44 ] .
biomarkers for personalized cancer immunotherapy while tumor associated biomarkers have been employed to personalize kinase - targeted agents for each patient ( as described in more detail above ) , these same approaches have been less robust for personalized cancer immunotherapy .
given the complexity of the tumor microenvironment , and the heterogeneous cellular landscape , there is a clear need to improve upon our classic biomarker - based approaches to incorporate the entirety of the tumor ecosystem , and tumor - immune contexture [ 7,45 ] .
in the context of the immune system , the ability for t - cells to mount a response to invasive growth of tumors is associated with improved outcome to therapy [ 46 ] .
several studies have now established that spatial distribution and infiltration of lymphocytes into tumors can predict progression - free or overall survival [ 47 ] .
indeed , lymphocytes of two distinct subclasses ( cd3 +/ cd8 + , cd3 +/ cd45ro + , or cd8 +/ cd45ro +) will confer distinct infiltration patterns that map to distinct predictive outcomes [ 47 ] .
halio dx , a french cancer diagnostics company , has created the first standardized immune - based assay immunoscore ( r ) colon for quantifying spatial heterogeneity of infiltrating immune cells , immunoscore ( r ) colon [ 48 ] .
specific for colon cancer , the test requires a tumor core and invasive margin , which are studied to determine the distribution and density of both cd3 + t lymphocytes and cd8 + cytotoxic t cells .
an algorithm is used to generate their immunoscore ( r ) ( i4 indicating the most cytotoxic and memory immune infiltrate and i0 indicating the lowest ) [ 48 ] .
groups of patients were defined based on microsatellite status and immunoscore and then analyzed for survival .
regardless of microsatellite status , patients with an immunoscore of i3 and i4 had prolonged disease - specific survival ( dss ) and os. in addition , patients with a score between i0 - i2 showed higher risk of relapse , shorter dss and os [ 49 ] .
this approach , investigating the number and density of infiltrating lymphocytes , has clearly shown to be beneficial and better than existing measures of response , it is important to note that the immune marker expression profile of immune cells can be a valuable predictor of response .
for instance , in clinical trials using ipilimumab , melanoma patients with higher expression of genes involved in immune function , including cd8a , cd27 , cd38 , cd3 , cd40 , gzmb , prf1 , ccl4 , were more likely to have positive response to treatment [ 50 ] .
despite these advances , evidence for dynamic mechanisms of resistance have led to new speculation about how to personalize cancer immunotherapy [ 4,10 ] .
mitra mitra rxdx inc. , a personalized cancer medicine company based in boston , massachusetts , created an ex vivo tumor model , which harnesses fresh tumor biopsies and surgical excisions to study the effect of drugs in a fully humanized , autologous context , termed canscript ( r ) [ 51 ] .
canscript ( r ) preserves the cellular and microenvironment heterogeneity by maintaining the tumor tissue in the presence of autologous plasma and peripheral blood nucleated cells ( pbnc ) in tissue culture wells coated with cancer type and grade - matched tumor matrix proteins ( tmp ) .
these elements enable accurate re - capitulation of the 3d architecture of the tumor and the tumor microenvironment , including the immune compartment .
this ex - vivo platform has been used to evaluate the functional effects of conventional cytotoxic and kinase targeted cancer therapies .
using a series of endpoints following drug exposure .
this was used to train a machine learning algorithm which generates an ' m - score ' for each drug tested , which is predictive for drug response ( figure 1 ) .
excitingly , this platform demonstrates the first use for dynamic cellular heterogeneity , and real - time analysis of the tumor - immune contexture under pressure of immune checkpoint inhibitors .
for example , mitra recently demonstrated the flexibility of the platform to the assay to capture changes to the t - cell immune repertoire , and help predict the clinical efficacy of multiple immuno - oncology agents , such as immune checkpoint inhibitors [ 52,53 ] .
indeed , by mapping the role of t - regulatory ( treg ) cells in the presence or absence of multiple pd - 1 checkpoint blockade , their research team elucidated that antitumor outcomes can be unique within a single patient sample .
they discovered that depletion of treg , but not increase of ifn - g expressing cytotoxic t - cells correlates to antitumor response .
these findings are the first to support patient - specific response to a single immunotherapy among multiple drugs that target the same immune checkpoint .
such revelations could help shape the future of treatment selection in immunotherapy at the individual patient level .
concluding remarks cancer treatment decision - making is the final frontier in our challenge to cure cancer .
while biomarkers , oncogenes and mutations have been classic maps for predicting therapy outcome , clinical success has reached a plateau .
even in the new age of cancer immunotherapy , target - specific molecular characteristics of a tumor are only present in a small proportion of patients .
immunotherapies can also cause immune - related adverse events , especially with ctla - 4 , which can be serious and affect a large proportion of treated patients , with one trial observing it in one third of patients [ 54 ] .
this makes prior patient testing even more vital to ensure these powerful next generation treatments are prescribed to the correct population .
the current problem is that the mechanism by which a drug target is selected is dictated by our knowledge of the role of growth factor receptors or key immune checkpoint proteins , and not patient - specific biology .
there are a multitude of overexpressed , mutated and / or dysfunctional proteins in a tumor .
targeting one may not yield the best response rates for patients .
there needs to be a way of deciding the relative efficacy of multiple treatment options for patients , in order to be sure of giving them the best possible chance of surviving and overcoming their cancer .
we are in the midst of an exciting time for the development of truly personalized medicine , with the emergence of technologies that have the capacity to predict clinical outcomes .
a more unbiased approach to drug selection has been sought with the invention of high throughput sequencing , searching the whole genome for mutations , but there is still , a disconnect between the discovery of mutations and deciding which drug is administered .
the discovery of new platform technologies , which go beyond molecular biomarkers by seeking to interrogate the dynamic and heterogeneous microenvironment which go beyond characterizing individual biomarkers may lead to improved personalized approaches for cancer immunotherapy .
not only do these types of platforms ensure that the patient gets the best treatment for their specific type of cancer , but it also paves the way for the discovery of drug efficacy in tumors that might not otherwise have been tested , leading to new drug discovery or repurposing of immunotherapy with conventional drugs .

the explants were cultured with tumor - and grade - matched tmps and autologous serum ( as ) and incubated with selected drug regimens .
while multiple drug regimens can be used , the one used by the oncologist for the patient was always included in the tumor explant culture .
the in vitro functional outcome of treatment in terms of cell viability , pathological and morphological analysis , cell proliferation , and cell death was quantified .
in module three , these quantitative scores from the explants were aggregated using a machine learning algorithm to assign a final score , which helped rank the outcomes as complete response ( cr ) , partial response ( pr ) , or no response ( nr ) .
in the final module , these predictions were tested against clinical outcomes .

background total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) is a common last - resort treatment for hip disease , but postoperative patients often complain of discrepancies in leg length .
this study introduces a device designed to increase the precision of the femoral neck osteotomy and reduce the incidence of leg length discrepancy .
methods forty - eight patients undergoing tha were divided into two groups , with and without the use of the femoral osteotomy guide .
all operations were performed through a posterolateral approach .
differences in leg length were recorded before and after the operation .
measurements were also made to compare the preoperative plan with the actual amount of bone removed .
results the mean average difference in femoral neck resection height was 0.84 mm when using the osteotomy guide and 1.69 mm without the guide .
discrepancies in postoperative leg length were 5.45 mm and 13.37 mm in the groups with and without the guide , respectively .
conclusion the femoral neck osteotomy guide is an effectively auxiliary tool for increasing the accuracy of bone resection in arthroplasty using the posterolateral approach .
trial registration chictr - ooc - 15005904 ; date : 2015 - 01 - 30 keywords guide femoral neck osteotomy osteotomy guide total hip arthroplasty leg length discrepancy issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background total hip arthroplasty ( tha ) is the most effective surgical approach for reducing pain and preserving function in heavily degraded joints [ 1 ] .
leg length discrepancy ( lld ) of 2 - 3 cm is critical for the clinical outcomes .
older patients may have problems with lld as small as 2 cm. but clark et al reported patients complained when lld was >= 1 cm [ 2 ] .
the procedure requires removing a certain degree of bone block from the femoral head and neck and often results in a post - surgical lld , a problem that surgeons have long - sought to rectify .
the position of the femoral neck osteotomy is one of the crucial factors in avoiding lld [ 3 ] .
to fit the hip joint prostheses during tha , the planes and angles of the femoral neck osteotomy require stringent control .
typically , a surgeon can only rely on his or her own experience with the procedure , which can often lead to errors between the planned fitting and the actual surgical alignment .
this practice is not conducive to patient rehabilitation because it not only extends the operative time but also affects the results of the operation .
to improve the accuracy of the femoral neck osteotomy , we designed a femoral neck osteotomy guide and compared its performance against a commonly - used unguided osteotomy technique .
this study aims to introduce and assess the reliability of the guide designed for osteotomy in tha .
methods structure of the femoral neck osteotomy guide the femoral neck osteotomy guide ( figure 1 ) consists of two parts : the upper part is an oriented platform that guides the direction of the femoral neck osteotomy perpendicular to the long axis of femoral neck , and the lower part locates on the top of the lesser trochanter of the femur .
there are two fixed screw holes in the locating seat , which are used to fix the device on the femoral neck .
the guides were divided into left and right groups , and a series of the guides was designed according to the osteotomy height from 10 mm to 15 mm for each group .
the series contains six models with a 1 mm interval difference between each two adjacent models .
the different sizes of the osteotomy guides were selected according to preoperative templates on x - ray films , such as a 10 - mm guide for a 10 mm osteotomy height , and the like .
first , a model was made and modified on femur specimens using a self - curing denture acrylic .
the model was then tested and adjusted on 128 femur specimens to obtain a suitable model form for a variety of femoral neck configurations .
finally the guide was made from titanium with a ratio of 1:1 according to the model .
the guide was suitable for tha through a posterolateral approach .
before surgery , the device was sterilised with low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilisation .
figure 1 femoral neck osteotomy guide a : anterior view , b : posterior view .
the guide device comprising two parts , the upper oriented platform ( 1 ) and the lower locating seat , which is attached to the top of the lesser femoral trochanter ( 2 ) .
patients this study aimed to investigate the precision of the guide for tha. between november 2012 and july 2013 , 48 patients in need of femoral neck osteotomy were included in our study ( figure 2 ) .
inclusion criteria were : primary hip arthroplasty with limb - length discrepancy less than 5 mm. in these patients , only one side required hip replacement while the other side was normal .
exclusion criteria were : preoperative lld > 5 mm by tape measurement , total hip arthroplasty with femoral neck preservation and a history of previous hip surgery .
patients were also excluded from the study if they had obesity , rheumatoid arthritis , scoliosis , pelvic obliquity , or a limp caused by cerebral thrombosis , cerebral palsy and other causes .
figure 2 flowchart illustrates the patients selected for study .
the selected patients were randomly assigned into the two groups .
twenty - four patients were operated on with the use of the guide ( group i ) and 24 without the guide ( group ii ) .
all operations were performed by the same experienced surgeon and measurements were made by a member of the research team .
the surgical team consisted of surgeons with more than 10 years of experience in hip replacement .
data on age , gender , operation side , an etiology of surgical indications , femoral neck height , leg length and operative time were collected for both groups .
surgical techniques all patients were admitted to the hospital 3 - 5 days before the surgery .
leg length was calculated and recorded by tape measure with the patients in a supine position before and after the tha surgery .
the length of the lower limbs was measured between the anterior superior iliac spine ( asis ) and the medial malleolus [ 4 ] .
preoperative radiographs were taken from an anteroposterior view of the pelvis with both femurs internally rotated approximately 15degrees as required for assessment before tha .
the templates were used to determine the height of the femoral neck osteotomy and the potential correct sizes for both the acetabular and femoral components of the prostheses .
after surgery , the heights of the osteotomies were measured from the lesser trochanter to the cuneiform plane on the x - ray films using the same parameters .
the operations were performed through a posterolateral approach with patients in a lateral decubitus position .
after exposing the femoral neck and the lesser trochanter , the surgeon placed the guide on the lesser trochanter .
it is important to place the locating seat on the top of the lesser trochanter and to adjust the oriented platform to be perpendicular to the long axis of the femoral neck .
the height of the bone resection is determined by the height of the guide , but the angle of the osteotomy was adjusted by lifting or lowering the platform of the guide by eye by the surgeons based on their experience .
after fixing the guide with kirschner pins at a diameter of 2 mm , the guide was fastened to femoral neck , making it unnecessary to hold the device tightly against the bone while performing the resection .
intraoperative x - ray was not performed after positioning the guide in front of the osteotomy .
the surgeon cut the femoral neck while the saw was in contact with the guide platform ( figure 3 ) .
after the bone was resected , the device was removed to show a smooth bone platform perpendicular to the long axis of the femur ( figure 4 ) .
the prosthesis was then placed following the customary surgical steps and post - operative x - rays were taken .
for group ii , the same procedure was followed , with the exception of using the guide .

the institutional review board of the third hospital of hebei medical university approved this study after thorough examination and verification .
all patients signed informed consent and agreed to participate in the study .
statistics statistical analysis was carried out by using spss13.0 for windows ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) .
enumeration data of the two groups of patients organised by gender , aetiologies of indications and operative side were compared by the chi - squared test .
measurement data , such as age , were compared using a t - test .
the significance threshold was set at p < 0.05 .
results a total of 48 patients participated in the study .
gender , age , operative side and clinical data were collected for statistical analysis , with results showing no significant difference between the two groups ( table 1 ) .
difference existed between the planning and postoperative osteotomy heights in both group , but the mean difference in group i ( average , 0.84 mm ) was significantly less than group ii ( average , 1.69 mm ) ( p < 0.001 ) ( tables 2 and 3 ) .
patients undergoing tha in group ii had an average difference in osteotomy height of 1.69 mm , while group i had an average difference of only 0.84 mm , which was significantly less than in group ii ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 4 ) .
the guide group had an average postoperative lld of 5.45 mm , while group ii had an average lld of 13.37 mm. additionally , limb shortening occurred in patients in group ii but this was not observed in any patients in group i ( table 5 ) .
for both groups , there was no significant difference in operation time ( p = 0.406 ) , but the average time for group i was four minutes shorter than that in group ii ( table 6 ) .
no complications occurred in either group during the process of osteotomy .

the guide was designed for improving the accuracy of osteotomy during tha surgery through the posterolateral approach .
the difference between actual and planning osteotomy heights in the group with the guide was lower than that in the group without the guide .
in addition , the guide is easy to use and does not prolong the operation time .
hip replacement is currently one of the most effective treatments for severely diseased or degenerated hip joints .
more than 1 million hip arthroplasties are performed every year worldwide , and this number is projected to double within the next two decades [ 1 ] .
the incidence of lld after tha has been reported to range from 1 % to 27 % , with some reports of even up to 50 % .
it is difficult to eliminate lld after tha .
combined use of a preoperative femoral template to predict the necessary length correction and plan the femoral neck osteotomy level along with intraoperative measurements is a practical method for avoiding lld .
however , some studies concluded that a planning match exists in only up to 60 % of cases , so improving the accuracy of actual performance according to preoperative plan remains controversial [ 3,5 ] .
lld following hip replacement may cause lower back pain , sciatic nerve palsy , gait dysfunction , hip dislocation and prosthetic loosening , as well as increasing patient dissatisfaction .
lld has been a major post - surgical complaint for patients receiving hip arthroplasty [ 6 ] .
lld is the result of a complex interaction between bone length , implants , soft tissue contractures , and pelvic obliquities .
after tha surgery , some authors feel that over - lengthening of the implant head - neck distance resulted in lld [ 7,8 ] .
in addition , the restoration of femoral offset is also critical for avoiding lld , as increased femoral offset theoretically can lead to increased implant bending moments and early loosening .
during the operation , inaccurate abduction / adduction repositioning of the femur with respect to the pelvis also can cause substantial errors in the measurement of length and offset change [ 9 ] .
a variety of methods have been used to avoid or reduce the incidence of lld , such as preoperative template measurement or using an l - shaped calliper and other surgical devices [ 10 ] .
careful preoperative planning is critical but does not preclude the surgeon from choosing the incorrect components for tha .
more importantly , attention to detail both in the planning and performance of the surgery may assist in reducing lld [ 11 ] .
although meticulous preoperative templating combined with x - ray , ct and other imaging systems assists with sizing an appropriate prosthesis and can be helpful for avoiding lld , surgeons may unintentionally stray from the template when implants of different sizes or offsets are used [ 2 ] .
although some instruments were used for measuring during the surgery , no professional surgical tools such as those used in knee replacement surgery exist for femoral neck resection .
surgeons typically rely on their experience and finger measurements during the osteotomy .
this may be particularly difficult for inexperienced surgeons , especially when trying to gauge the cuneiform plane angle and height of the femoral neck resection .
this can extend the operation time , increase blood loss and complicate the procedure .
earlier studies paid close attention to measurement methods using different types of devices and landmarks , but difficulties with operative manipulation have not been addressed thus far .
the guide was invented to address the uncertainty of femoral neck osteotomy .
in our study , the surgeons had more than 10 years of experience in hip replacement , yet still had a certain degree of error .
in the current study , errors in osteotomy height between the actual and predicted size were reduced to 0 ~ 1 mm. furthermore , lld was reduced to less than 10 mm. we believe that such a device will become standard in femoral neck osteotomy , resulting in more precision for cutting height and resection angles .
this will also reduce the surgical times and alleviate soft tissue damage during the operation .
our study has some limitations .
first , the head - neck distance of the implants was not recorded or compared between the two groups .
a device combined femoral neck osteotomy guide with head - neck distance measurement is being developed .
second , in our study , one observer who was blinded to the design was in charge of measurement , so inter - observer agreement was not considered in the design of the study .
this was one of the major limitations of the current study .
finally , the soft tissues above the lesser trochanter could not be stripped clean during surgery , which introduced a measurement error in performing the osteotomy .
additionally , in obese patients , it is difficult to expose the lesser trochanter , so the device cannot accommodate all types of patients in clinical practice .
conclusions the guide device , as an auxiliary tool , assists the surgeon in achieving a more precise femoral neck osteotomy according to the preoperative plan , which may also reduce the incidence of lld .
the design still has some limitations , and there is more room for improvement .
first , the guide with its fixed height is not convenient in clinical application .
if the height of device was adjustable , the surgeon could alter the osteotomy height without removing the location seat .
this problem could be solved by adding a gasket on the platform of the device ; we are currently working on that modification .
second , the adjustment of the angles in bone resection still depends on the surgeon 's experience ; this is another area that needs improvement .
the design will be further refined to improve the tool 's functionality .

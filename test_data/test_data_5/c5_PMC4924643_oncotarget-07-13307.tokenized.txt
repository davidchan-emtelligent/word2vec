structural equation models ( sem ) can explicitly distinguish " dementia - relevant " variance in cognitive task performance ( i.e. , " delta " for dementia ) .
in prior work , delta appears to uniquely account for dementia severity regardless of the cognitive measures used to construct it. in this study , we test delta as a mediator of age 's prospective association with future cognitive performance and dementia severity in a large , ethnically diverse longitudinal cohort , the texas alzheimer 's research and care consortium ( tarcc ) .
age had adverse effects on future cognition , and these were largely mediated through delta , independently of education , ethnicity , gender , depression ratings , serum homo - cysteine levels , hemoglobin a1c , and apolipoprotein e4 status .
age explained 4 % of variance in delta , and through it , 11 - 18 % of variance in future cognitive performance .
our findings suggest that normative aging is a dementing condition ( i.e. , a " senility ") .
while the majority of variance in dementia severity must be independent of age , age 's specific effect is likely to accumulate over the lifespan .
our findings also constrain age 's dementing effects on cognition to the age - related fraction of " general intelligence " ( spearman 's " g "). that has broad biological and pathophysiological implications .
aging intelligence dementia senility gerotarget introduction cognitive performance is associated with age , and seemingly healthy elderly persons may be impaired relative to young adult norms [ 1 ] .
age is also a major risk factor for dementia , whether attributed to alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) or to other neurodegenerative disorders [ 2 ] .
however , it is an empirical question whether neurodegenerative changes mediate the association between age and cognition , or indeed , whether age - specific cognitive changes might dementing in their own right .
we do not yet know the phenotype of age - specific cognitive change .
many studies describe longitudinal age - related trends in cognition [ 3 - 5 ] .
however , those estimates have significant interindividual variability which suggests the existence of subgroups , any of which might uniquely exhibit the true aging - specific cognitive phenotype ( ascp ) .
we have used a growth mixture model ( gmm ) analysis , to better precise the ascp [ 6 ] .
this allowed us to distinguish an " aging proper " subgroup , and to characterize its performance on a battery of cognitive measures .
aging proper was characterized by improving verbal function , stable memory and declines in non - verbal performance and instrumental activities of daily living ( iadl ) [ 7 ] .
in contrast , a presumed pathological " aging et alia " group was characterized by declines in general cognition , memory , executive function , and iadl .
40.2 % of subjects in the aging proper group had survived up to a decade after their assessment , compared with 16.9 % of subjects the in aging et alia group .
79.3 % of survivors classified as aging proper remained in independent levels of care a decade later ( at a mean age = 88.8 +/ - 3.4 years ) compared with 53.9 % of aging et alia .
however , declines in iadl suggested that both groups may have been experiencing one or more dementing processes .
if aging proper is dementing , then even normative cognitive aging may be a matter of concern , and a potential target for therapeutic intervention .
meanwhile , we have recently been using a theory driven confirmatory factor analysis ( cfa ) in a structural equation model ( sem ) framework to construct a latent phenotype for dementia itself , as distinct from either global cognitive performance or performance in any single cognitive domain [ 8 ] .
our intent has been to identify dementia 's essential biomarkers , and to distinguish them from those of an illness' non - dementing features .
the resulting latent variable , i.e. , " delta " ( for " dementia ") , is relatively free of measurement error , continuously distributed , and appears to be " indifferent " to its cognitive indicators .
delta is strongly related to iadl , and with dementia severity , as measured by the clinical dementia rating scale " sum of boxes " ( cdr ) [ 9 - 10 ] .
delta is extracted from spearman 's general intelligence factor " g " [ 11 ] .
delta 's remainder in g is also extracted from our model , and has been labeled " g ' " to distinguish it from g itself .
in contrast to delta , g ' is weakly associated with cdr , has a poor area under the receiver operating curve ( auc ; roc ) for the discrimination between ad cases and controls , and is not associated with iadl ( by definition ) .
we have successfully validated numerous delta homologs in three different cohorts [ 8 , 10 , 12 - 13 ] .
delta has also been independently replicated by a second group in the national alzheimer 's coordinating center ( nacc )' s uniform dataset ( uds ) ( n = 26,606 ) [ 14 ] .
regardless of either the sample frame or the measures used to construct it , the latent variable delta appears to be strongly related to the cdr and achieves very high aucs for the discrimination between ad cases and either controls ( range 0.987 - 0.995 ) or mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) ( range 0.950 - 0.957 ) .
it is an empirical question whether age is associated with cognitive performance independently of delta , whether delta and / or g ' mediate ( s ) their relationship , or whether multiple pathways are involved .
these questions can be addressed via mediation models [ 15 ] .
if delta is found to mediate age 's association with prospective cognitive performance , then aging proper might join the ranks of potentially dementing conditions .
longitudinal mediation models are arguably causal [ 15 ] .
we propose to test delta and g ' as temporally intermediate mediators of baseline age 's effect on prospective cognitive performance .
this may seem trivial , but it is not .
if delta scores characterize the ascp , then normative aging becomes a dementing condition and its effect may sum independently of other dementia risks to advance the onset of a clinically demented state , and / or modulate the presentations of neurodegenerative disorders by independent mechanisms .
if age is an independent determinant of dementia severity , then its effect on delta ought to be independent of comorbidities , including depression ( which has previously been shown to affect delta ) [ 12 ] and neurodegenerative diseases .
the biomarkers mediating the association between age and cognition could be determined .
they might offer opportunities for the specific remediation , modulation or prevention of age - specific cognitive disability .
results descriptive statistics are presented in table 1 .
the mean age of tarcc participants at baseline was 70.9 ( 9.7 ) years , with a range of 52 - 102 years .
there were no cross - group differences between the two randomly selected subgroups ( by student 's t , all p > 0.05 ) .

the unadjusted deq composite 's auc for the discrimination between ad cases and controls at wave 2 was high [ auc = 0.986 ( ci : 0.981 - 0.991 )] .
g 's auc for the same discrimination was at a near chance level [ auc = 0.630 ( ci : 0.601 - 0.65.9 )] .
this is consistent with past findings , across batteries , in this and other cohorts .
the base model ( figure 1 ) had excellent fit [ chi2 = 48.33 ( 22 ) , p < 0.001 ; cfi = 0.996 ; rmsea = 0.020 ] .
baseline age was significantly associated with wave 3 cognitive performance and with wave 3 cdr .
age 's effects on wave 3 cognitive performance were significant and inverse ( adverse ) , ranging from boston ( r = - 0.07 , p = 0.04 ) to animal ( r = - 0.35 , p < 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ) .
age was moderately associated with wave 3 cdr scores ( r = 0.30 , p < 0.001 ) .
the positive association implies an adverse effect on future dementia severity .

* all observed variables except age are adjusted for education , ethnicity , gender , gds , hcy , hgba1c , and apoe e4 status ( paths not shown for clarity ) .
the covariates are densely intercorrelated .
the final mediation model ( figure 2 ) also had excellent fit [ chi2 = 36.44 ( 24 ) , p < 0.001 ; cfi = 0.999 ; rmsea = 0.013 ] .
independently of the covariates ( i.e. , education , ethnicity , gender , gds scores , hcy , hgb a1c , and apoe e4 burden ) baseline age was significantly directly associated with wave 3 animal , boston and cerad .
these direct associations were statistically weak ( boston , cerad ) to moderate ( animals ) and attenuated relative to the base model .
age 's direct association with wave 3 cdr was also attenuated and now statistically weak ( r = 0.12 , p < 0.001 ) .
age was significantly associated with wave 2 deq ( r = 0.24 , p < 0.001 ) , but not with the wave 2 g ' composite ( r = 0.00 , p = 0.87 ) .
age 's significant association with wave 2 deq scores was moderately strong and in a positive direction ( r = 0.24 , p < 0.001 ) .
given age 's unstandardized association of 0.02 with deq , each year of increasing age is associated with an 0.02 sd increase in deq .
because age was not significantly associated with g ' , it cannot be a mediator of wave 3 cognitive performance .
g ' was therefore omitted from further consideration .
independently of both wave 2 g ' ' s adverse effects , and wave 3 g 's , wave 2 deq was strongly inversely related to wave 3 cognitive performance ( and positively with cdr ) .
thus , the age - related effects mediated by deq were functionally adverse and likely to reinforce age 's attenuated and relatively weak direct effects .

* all observed variables except age are adjusted for education , ethnicity , gender , gds , hcy , hgba1c , and apoe e4 status ( paths not shown for clarity ) .
the covariates are densely intercorrelated .
age 's significant direct effects in model 1 were largely or fully mediated by deq ( table 2 ) .
similar results are obtained if alternative measures are substituted .
for example , 91.4 % of age 's effect on wave 3 mmse scores were mediated by deq , while age 's effects on wave 3 lmii performance were fully mediated ( data not shown ) .
table 2 deq 's mediation effects ( group 1 ) path description unadjusted ( figure 1 ) adjusted ( figure 2 ) % mediation a age > animalw3 - 0.35 , p < 0.001 - 0.21 , p = 0.955 42 b age > bostonw3 - 0.07 , p = 0.037 0.07 , p = 0.013 91 c age > ceradw3 - 0.29 , p < 0.001 - 0.14 , p = 0.006 54 d age > trailsaw3 - 0.16 , p < 0.001 - 0.05 , p < 0.001 70 e age > cdrw3 0.30 , p < 0.001 0.12 , p < 0.001 86 animal = animal naming test ; boston = boston naming test ; cdr = clinical dementia rating scale sum of boxes ; cerad = consortium to establish a registry of alzheimer 's disease list learning total score ; trails a = trail making test part a. the constrained model 's fit was statistically indistinguishable from the unconstrained model .
therefore age 's associations with all wave 2 and wave 3 measures remain stable across both subsamples ( table 3 ) .
in post hoc analyses , age 's direct association with deq was statistically indiscriminable in the young old ( r = 0.17 , p < 0.001 ) vs. the elder old ( r = 0.11 , p < 0.001 ) [ chi2 difference = 0.09 ( 1 ) , p = 0.75 ] .
nor was it affected by a diagnosis of dementia ( ad : r = 0.09 , p < 0.001 ; mci + nc : r = 0.09 , p < 0.001 ) [ chi2 difference = 0.01 ( 1 ) , p = 0.90 ] .

the analysis has many strengths .
our sample size is large and ethnically diverse .
the model is longitudinal , has excellent fit , and was replicated across two large randomly selected subsamples .
there is no overlap in the cognitive measures used to construct the wave 2 mediators and the outcomes used to test the mediation effects .
the deq mediator achieved a high auc for ad 's diagnosis .
the entire model is adjusted for multiple competing sources of cognitive variance .
we have two principal findings .
first , age 's adverse effects on cognition were largely mediated through delta .
because delta specifically mediates cognition 's association with disability , age 's contributions along this path are potentially " dementing " , and can be expected to modulate age - independent causes of dementia .
second , age accounts for little variance in deq ( 5 %) and by that path accounts for a relatively small fraction future outcomes , ranging from r2 = 0.11 ( age > deq > trials a ) to 0.16 ( age > deq > cerad ) .
age - independent mechanisms must therefore be the dominant determinants of the dementia risk of older persons .
we found that age 's adverse effects on cognition were largely mediated through delta .
age had incremental effects independently of delta , but these were statistically weak .
deq 's residual in spearman 's general intelligence factor " g " ( i.e. , g ') represents an additional influence on observed cognitive performance .
it risks to obscure age 's specific effects .
however , 1 ) g '' s contribution , even in older persons , is not age - related , and 2 ) g '' s contribution is not functionally salient ( by definition ) .
in contrast to g ' , future dementia severity has been shown to be almost entirely attributable to delta and its rate of change in time ( deltadelta ) [ 14 , 16 ] .
therefore , any predictor of delta scores might have clinical significance , even age 's weak effect .
since age 's delta - mediated effects explain a substantial fraction of its total effect on cognitive performance , age largely exerts a disabling and therefore potentially dementing cognitive influence .
since its contribution to delta is also stable across diagnostic subgroups , and independent of multiple cormorbidities , age must be dementing in its own right ( i.e. , an age - specific dementia = " senility ") .
age 's contribution to delta is also stable regardless of whether it is measured across tarcc 's entire sample , or across younger and older subgroups .
this suggests that age 's effect is likely to accumulate linearly over the lifespan .
given that each year of increasing age is associated with an 0.02 sd increase in deq , 1.0 sd in deq scores might be traversed over tarcc 's 50 year age range due to aging alone .
this is not trivial .
we have observed that each quintile increase in the deq scores of cognitively normal persons increases their five year risk of dementia conversion by 50 % , while the risk of cases with " mild cognitive impairment ( mci )" increases three - fold [ 17 ] .
age 's independent contribution should be maximal then among the oldest old ( e.g. , centenarians ) .
this could explain 1 ) the weakened association between apoe and dementia in centenarians [ 18 - 20 ] , despite dementia 's increasing incidence [ 21 ] , and 2 ) the reduced burden of neurodegenerative lesions among the oldest " ad " cases [ 22 ] .
age 's cumulative effects on delta scores over a lifetime will be more likely to result in clinical " dementia " if they are added to a less advantaged baseline .
thus , youthful cognitive performance can be associated with late onset dementia , while youthful educational attainment seems to protect one from it [ 23 - 24 ] .
this might also explain the propensity of remote insults , such as traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) to increase dementia risk , despite intervening decades of normal performance .
age is significantly associated with delta in the nacc , and their association is entirely mediated by ad neuropathology in autopsy proven ad cases [ 25 ] .
however , age 's association with ad pathology was inverse , suggesting that older age was associated with dementias exhibiting a lesser burden of ad pathology .
this suggests that the adverse effect of age on cognition may not be mediated by the alzheimer process , but by its direct effects on delta .
a distinct tauopathy , limited to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and with no more than minimal abeta deposition , has been proposed to represent the " primary age - related tauopathy ( part )" [ 26 ] .
part is almost universally present in extremely old individuals .
it would be interesting if part pathology mediated age 's association with delta .
however , delta has been related instead to the default mode network ( dmn ) [ 12 , 27 ] .
the dmn 's involvement by tauopathy may be necessary to dementia 's manifestation in ad [ 28 ] .
part pathology is not so situated , and may therefore not explain dementia in older persons [ 29 ] .
we have recently constructed a delta " ortholog " representing age - specific cognitive performance ( i.e. , " cage ") [ 30 ]. that ortholog had a similar bifactor structure to deq 's , overlapping cognitive indicators and identical covariates , but targeted age instead of iadl .
similarly to this model , cage adversely affected cognitive performance independently of hcy , hgba1c , and apoe .
serum insulin - like growth factor binding protein 2 ( igf - bp2 ) was strongly associated with cage and , through it , appeared to adversely affect cognition .
igf - bp2 attenuates age 's effect on deq in model 2 ( drr unpublished ) , and may therefore be a partial mediator of age 's specific effect on delta .
igf - bp2 is not a serum biomarker of age adjusted delta scores .
tarccs remaining biomarker panel is being explored for other biomarkers of age - specific cognitive change .
in other recent work we have suggested that activation of the toll - like receptor ( tlr ) may contribute to delta scores [ 31 ] .
although tlr function appears to be dysregulated in old age [ 32 ] , our finding was age adjusted , and may therefore represent an age - independent determinant of delta scores .
delta 's role as a potential mediator of age - independent dementia risks is beyond the scope of this analysis .
our model has yet to be replicated in an independent sample .
however , it survives generalization across two large random subsets of tarcc 's cohort .
replication might be feasible in the nacc .
the nacc dataset has the advantage of including several dementia etiologies and associated neuropatholgy .
if age contributes to delta scores independently of multiple pathologies , then age 's apparent role as a risk factor for those dementias could be called into question .
instead , age 's effects on delta could then be interpreted as an independent comorbid dementing process .
our findings underscore the potential significance of a dementing ascp in a rapidly aging demographic .
late onset " ad " ( load ) cases are by far the most common manifestation of dementia , and octogenarians are the fastest growing demographic segment of the western world , including the u.s .
[ 33 ] .
sem analyses of large datasets provide an approach to the disaggregation of age - specific influences over cognitive performance .
only then can the biomarkers of aging proper be identified , and steps taken to understand its specific influence on dementia risk .
materials and methods subjects texas alzheimer 's research and care consortium ( tarcc ) the consortium 's methods have been described in detail elsewhere [ 34 ] .
briefly , the tarcc cohort is a convenience sample of n = 3069 well characterized cases of alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) ( n = 1182 ) , " mci " ( n = 611 ) , and normal controls ( nc ) ( n = 1276 ) .
each tarcc participant undergoes a standardized annual examination that includes a medical evaluation , neuropsychological testing , and clinical interview .
diagnosis of ad status is based on national institute for neurological communicative disorders and stroke - alzheimer 's disease and related disorders association ( nincds - adrda ) criteria [ 35 ] .
institutional review board approval was obtained at each site and written informed consent was obtained for all participants .
drr is pi of the san antonio tarcc site , and a member of tarcc 's steering committee .
this analysis was performed on data obtained prior to 2015 .
we divided the cohort into two randomly selected subsets .
group 1 ( n = 1544 ) was used to construct the model .
group 2 ( n = 1528 ) was used to replicate the parameters of interest ( i.e. , the associations between baseline age , wave 2 delta and g ' , and wave 3 cognitive performance ) .
delta 's wave 2 indicators logical memory ii [ 36 ] : following a thirty minute delay , the subject recalls two paragraphs read aloud .
delayed paragraph recall has been useful clinically in identifying dementia and tracking progression of the disease .
visual reproduction i [ 36 ] : the subject recalls two paragraphs read aloud .
visual reproduction has been useful clinically in identifying dementia and tracking progression of the disease .
the controlled oral word association ( cowa ) [ 37 ] : the cowa is a test of oral word production ( verbal fluency ) .
the patient is asked to say as many words as they can in one minute , beginning with a certain letter of the alphabet .
digit span test ( dst ) [ 36 ] : the dst sums the longest set of numbers the subject can repeat back to the examiner in correct order ( forwards and backwards ) .
instrumental activities of daily living ( iadl ) [ 7 ] : iadl 's were assessed using informant ratings .
the ability to use the telephone , shopping , food preparation , housekeeping , laundry , use of transportation , ability to handle finances , and responsibility for medication adherence were each rated on the likert scale ranging from 0 ( no impairment ) to 3 ( specific incapacity ) .
a total iadl score calculated as the sum of all eight items .
wave 3 outcome variables animal naming ( animals ) [ 38 ] : this test of verbal fluency asks the subject to produce as many animal names as they can in one minute .
the boston naming test ( boston ) [ 39 ] : this is a confrontation naming test that requires the subject to verbally name each of 60 line drawings of objects of increasingly low frequency .
consortium establish a registry for alzheimer 's disease list learning ( cerad ) [ 40 ] : this memory test uses a list of ten unrelated words that the subject reads out loud over three learning trials to ensure registration .
following a three to five minute delay , a free recall trial and a recognition trial are presented .
trail - making part a ( trails a ) [ 41 ] : this test of attention , speed and mental flexibility requires the subject to connect numbers , placed randomly on the page , in their appropriate order .
clinical covariates education : education was coded continuously as years of formal education .
ethnicity : ethnicity was determined by self - report and coded dichotomously as " hispanic " and " non - hispanic " .
all tarcc evaluations and psychometrics are provided in english or in spanish according to the subject 's preference .
gender : gender was coded dichotomously the geriatric depression rating scale ( gds ) [ 42 - 43 ] : gds scores range from zero - 30 .
higher scores are worse .
a cut - point of 9 - 10 best discriminates clinically depressed from non - depressed elderly .
biomarker covariates laboratory analysis non - fasting samples were collected , centrifuged and pipetted by 1ml aliquots into polypropylene cryovial tubes and placed in - 200degreesc ( non - frost free ) or - 80degreesc freezers until shipment to the tarcc biobank .
measurements of homocysteine ( hcy ) , hemoglobin a1c ( hgba1c ) , and apolipoprotein ( apoe ) epsilon4 genotyping were performed in the ballantyne laboratory at the baylor college of medicine .
hgba1c was measured in whole blood .
hcy was measured in serum .
hgba1c measurement was based on the turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay ( tinia ) for hemolyzed whole blood .
hcy concentrations were measured using the recombinant enzymatic cycling assay ( i.e. , roche hitachi 911 ) .
apoe genotyping was conducted using standard polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) methods [ 44 ] .
apoeepsilon4 status was coded 0 - 2 according to the number of epsilon4 alleles .
clinical correlates the clinical dementia rating scale sum of boxes ( cdr ) [ 9 ] : the cdr is used to evaluate dementia severity .
the rating assesses the patient 's cognitive ability to function in six domains - memory , orientation , judgment and problem solving , community affairs , home and hobbies and personal care .
the information necessary to those ratings is collected during an interview with the patient and their caregiver .
each domain is rated on a scale of 0.0 - 3.0 .
a total cdr - sb is calculated as the sum of all six domains .
the mini - mental status examination ( mmse ) [ 45 ] : the mmse is a well - known and widely used test for cognitive impairment screening .
scores range from 0 to 30 .
scores less than 24 reflect cognitive impairment .
statistical analyses analysis sequence confirmatory factor ( cfa ) and mediation models were performed using analysis of moment structures software ( amos ) [ 46 ] .
the maximum likelihood estimator was chosen for these models .
delta and g ' were derived by bifactor cfa from baseline data .
a delta homolog was constructed from wave 2 data .
this is structurally identical to " deq " , which has elsewhere been reported to 1 ) have excellent fit ( i.e. , chi2 / df = 181 / 24 , p < 0.001 ; cfi = 0.97 ; rmsea = 0.05 ) , 2 ) have acceptable factor determinacy by grice 's method [ 47 ] , 3 ) exhibit factor equivalence across ethnicity , 4 ) to be strongly correlated with dementia severity as measured by the cdr ( r = 0.99 , p < 0.001 ) and 5 ) to exhibit an auc of 0.95 ( ci = 0.94 - 0.96 ) for the discrimination between ad cases and controls ( in wave 1 tarcc data ) [ 31 ] .
however , for the purposes of this analysis , deq was constructed without any covariates , specifically age , hcy , hgba1c and apoe e4 burden .
deq and g ' factor weights were applied to wave 2 observed data to generate wave 2 deq and g ' composite scores ( i.e. , deq w2 and g ' w2 , respectively ) .
g ' is deq 's residual in spearman 's g. the composite scores were used as observed mediators of baseline age 's direct associations with wave 3 cdr scores ( cdr w3 ) and wave 3 cognitive performance .
there is no overlap in delta 's wave 2 indicators and selected wave 3 outcome measures .
in the resulting nested longitudinal models , deq and g ' are being tested as competing independent mediators of age 's direct effects on prospective cognitive performance .
all observed wave 2 and wave 3 measures were adjusted for education , ethnicity , gender , gds scores , hcy , hgb a1c , and apoe epsilon4 status .
both the wave 1 deq homolog and the mediation model were constructed in a randomly selected subset of tarcc participants , comprising approximately 50 % of the subjects ( i.e. , group 1 : n = 1544 ) .
as a test of the model 's generalizability to the remainder ( n = 1528 ) , age 's significant direct associations were constrained across the two groups , and model fit compared across constrained and unconstrained conditions .
in post hoc analyses , we further ascertained the effects of stratification at 79 / 80 years on age 's direct association with deq (" young elderly " mean age = 67.47 , n = 2428 ; " older elderly " mean age = 83.93 , n = 644 ) .
we also tested the effects of a dementia diagnosis [" ad " : n = 1182 vs. " mci " or nc : n = 1887 ] .
these models were all constructed in an sem framework , using raw data .
no statistical transformation was applied to biomarker data .
modern missing data methods were automatically applied by the amos software ( see below ) .
mediation models following the approach of mackinnon et al .
[ 48 ] , we first modeled " direct " paths between baseline age and wave 3 clinical outcomes .
we next tested each wave 2 composite as an independent predictor of the wave 3 clinical outcomes , in separate models .
if the composite in question was also significant , we then tested the indirect path as a mediator of the " direct " path ( s ) .
figure 2 , for example , presents the mediation model for deq .
according to kraemer et al .
[ 15 ] , the timing of the variables relative to each other is important .
for a true mediation effect , the mediator should occur between the predictor and the outcome , not coincidentally with the predictor .
our model is constructed across three annual assessments , with wave 2 composites serving as temporally intermediate mediators of baseline age 's association with wave 3 clinical outcomes .
the results can therefore be interpreted causally .
missing data 888 subjects had complete biomarker data .
in contrast , psychometrics and adjudicated clinical diagnoses were available on 2017 subjects .
rather than using case - wise deletion , the missing biomarker and psychometric data were handled by modern missing data methods [ 49 ] .
only the roc analyses , which were performed in statistical package for the social sciences ( spss ) [ 50 ] were limited to complete cases .
amos employs full information maximum likelihood ( fiml ) methods to address missing data .
fiml uses the entire observed data matrix to estimate parameters with missing data .
fiml yields unbiased parameter estimates , preserves the overall power of the analysis , and is arguably superior to alternative methods , e.g. , multiple imputation [ 51 - 52 ] .
fit indices model fit was assessed using four common test statistics : chi - square , the comparative fit index ( cfi ) , and the root mean square error of approximation ( rmsea ) .
where two nested models were compared , akaike 's information criterion ( aic ) was added .
a lower aic statistic indicates better fit .
a non - significant chi - square signifies that the data are consistent with the model [ 53 ] .
however , in large samples such as tarcc , this metric is limited by its tendency to achieve statistical significance when all other fit indices ( which are not sensitive to sample size ) show that the model fits the data very well .
a cmin / df ratio < 5.0 suggests an adequate fit to the data [ 54 ] .
the cfi statistic compares the specified model with a null model [ 55 ] .
cfi values range from 0 to 1.0 .
values below 0.95 suggest model misspecification .
values approaching 1.0 indicate adequate to excellent fit .
an rmsea of 0.05 or less indicates a close fit to the data , with models below 0.05 considered " good " fit , and up to 0.08 as " acceptable "[ 56 ] .
all fit statistics should be simultaneously considered when assessing the adequacy of the models to the data .
roc curves the diagnostic performance or accuracy of a test to discriminate diseased from normal cases can be evaluated using roc curve analysis [ 57 - 58 ] .
briefly the true positive rate ( sensitivity ) is plotted as a function of the false positive rate ( 100 - specificity ) for different cut - off points of a parameter .
the area under the roc curve ( auc ) is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups ( diseased / normal ) .
the roc analysis was performed in spss .
this study was made possible by the texas alzheimer 's research and care consortium ( tarcc ) funded by the state of texas through the texas council on alzheimer 's disease and related disorders .
drr and rfp have disclosed the results of these analyses to the university of texas health science center at san antonio ( uthscsa ) , which has filed patent application 2012.039.us1.hscs and provisional patents 61 / 603,226 and 61 / 671,858 relating to the latent variable delta 's construction and biomarkers .

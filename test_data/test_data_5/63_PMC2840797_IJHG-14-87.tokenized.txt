aim : the study was aimed to determine the association of apolipoprotein e ( apo e ) gene polymorphisms on lipid levels in asian indian population .
methods : a total of 350 ( 184 males and 166 females ) adult ( 30 years and above ) asian indians of calcutta and suburb participated in the study .
anthropometric measures , lipids profiles , and blood glucose measures were collected .
out of 350 subjects , a sample of 70 individuals was selected randomly for genotyping after adjusting for age and sex .
the apo e gene polymorphisms were determined by agarose gel electrophoresis .
results : the apo e polymorphism showed significant association with dyslipidaemia ( p = 0.0135 ) with epsilon3 / 4 combination has had the highest occurrence of dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome ( ms ) followed by epsilon4 / 4 < epsilon3 / 3 < epsilon2 / 4 < epsilon2 / 3 in decreasing order .
conclusions : the epsilon4 allele of apo e gene independent of other risk factors is associated with dyslipidaemia in particular with low hdlc and high tc : hdlc ratio .
apo e polymorphism asian indians dyslipidaemia metabolic syndrome obesity introduction apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) plays a key role in the metabolism of cholesterol and triglyceride by serving as a receptor binding ligand mediating the clearance of chylomicron and remnants of very low - density lipoprotein cholesterol from plasma. [ 1 - 4 ] three different apoe alleles ( epsilon2 , epsilon3 , and epsilon4 ) on chromosome number 19 are responsible to encoding three different apo e isoform ( apo e2 , apo e3 , and apo e4 respectively ) , resulting in six different genotypes ( epsilon2 / 2 , epsilon3 / 3 , epsilon4 / 4 , epsilon2 / 3 , epsilon2 / 4 , and epsilon3 / 4 ).[ 56 ] it has been estimated that apo e polymorphisms may account for 2 - 16 % of the variability of ldl cholesterol levels , a contribution incomparable with any other gene in the general population. [ 23 ] compared with epsilon3 homozygotes , carriers of the epsilon2 allele , which has defective receptor - binding ability , have lower circulating cholesterol levels and higher triglyceride levels , whereas carriers of the epsilon4 allele appear to have higher plasma levels of total and low - density lipoprotein cholesterol. [ 1 ] since the first demonstration of apoe gene polymorphism on dysbetalipoproteinemia ,[ 7 ] numerous studies have investigated the relation between apoe genotypes and coronary heart disease ( chd ).[ 7 - 9 ] recent evidence also indicates that apoe may play additional role in the development of chd. [ 210 - 13 ] globally , the apoe locus shows substantial allelic variation with ranges 0 - 20 % for epsilon2 , 60 - 90 % for epsilon3 and 10 - 20 % for epsilon4 alleles [ 14 - 18 ] with some exception .
in asian indians , studies have investigated the allele frequencies with ranges 0.031 - 0.094 for epsilon2 ; 0.803 - 0.968 for epsilon3 and 0.000 - 0.133 for epsilon4. [ 19 ] frequency of apoe epsilon3 allele was found to be high ( 0.913 ) in people of north india. [ 17 ] in another study on asian indians , individuals with at least a epsilon4 allele were considered at risk to develop premature myocardial infarction ( mi ) , independent of other risk conventional risk factors. [ 20 ] most of these studies are either from the north , west , central , and southern part of india. [ 157 - 32 ] studies from eastern part of india are lacking .
the present study is an attempt to investigate the apo e gene polymorphism and its association with dyslipidemmia in people belongs to the eastern part of india .
materials and methods study population the data were collected from adult men and women aged 30 years and above from calcutta and suburb .
a total of 350 individuals ( 184 males and 166 females ) participated in the study .
prior to participation , public advertisement was given about the study with the help of the council officials .
an arbitrary list was made to conduct the study .
individuals were selected randomly after their response through local advertisement .
the response rate was quite high (~ 85 %) .
the institute ethical committee has had approved the study .
written consent was obtained from participants prior to actual commencement of the study .
anthropometric measurements anthropometric variables namely height , weight , circumference of waist ( wc ) and hip were taken using standard techniques. [ 33 ] height was measured to nearest 0.1 cm with a standard anthropometer and weight to the nearest 0.5 kg with a portable weighing machine in light clothing .
waist and hip circumferences were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using non - elastic tape .
the body mass index ( bmi in kg / m2 ) and waist - hip ratio ( whr ) was calculated accordingly .
biochemical estimations a 7 ml of venous blood was drawn from each individual after an overnight fast of >= 12 h for estimation of metabolic variables .
lipids profile namely the total cholesterol ( tc ) , triglycerides ( tg ) , high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdlc ) , low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldlc ) , and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( vldlc ) were taken into consideration .
values of ldlc were estimated using standard formula ( ldlc = tc - ( hdlc + tg / 5 )) and vldlc as tg / 5 provided tg was < 400 mg / dl. otherwise , tg was estimated directly .
fasting ( fbg ) , post prandial blood glucose ( ppbg ) ( 2 h after meal ) and tc : hdlc ratio was also considered .
all biochemical analyses were done at the ' human genetic engineering research center ( hgerc ) , calcutta and were measured in mg / dl ( mg %) unit .
subjects with one or more of the followings were considered as dyslipidaemic ( post entry ) : tc >= 240 mg / dl ;[ 34 ] tg >= 200 mg / dl ;[ 35 ] and tc : hdlc ratio >= 4.4. [ 36 ] genotyping dna was extracted from blood using qi aamp kit ( qiagen , germany ) .
apo e isoforms were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with a thermal cycler ( bio rad , usa ) and specific oligonucleotides as described. [ 37 ] the amplified fragments were digested with the enzyme hhai overnight at 37degreesc and separated on a 4 % agarose ( promega , usa ) gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining and visualized under uv spectrophotometer .
statistical analyses descriptive statistics such mean and standard deviation ( sd ) of anthropometric and biochemical measures was calculated by sex and the sex differences for these variables were calculated using unpaired t test .
differences in genotype frequency were examined by chi2 analyses .
analysis of variance ( anova ) was undertaken to see the differences of obesity and metabolic variables across the apo e genotypes .
all statistical analyses were computed using the spss ( pc + version10.0 ).[ 38 ] a p value of < 0.05 ( two tailed ) was considered as significant .
results the mean and sd ( unadjusted for age ) of anthropometric , lipids profile and blood glucose variables by sexes are presented in table 1 .
there existed no significant sex differences for variables except for age , tc and fbg .
since , age differed significantly , age and sex matched 70 subjects were selected randomly to study the association of apo e polymorphism and dyslipidaemia .

it was observed that epsilon3 / 4 individuals have relatively higher mean value for bmi , wc , tc , ldlc , low hdlc , and tc : hdlc ratio as compared to rest of the genotypes .
homozygous for epsilon4 allele on contrary have had relatively higher tg value whereas , individual homozygous for epsilon3 allele have had relatively higher fbg and ppbg compared to other groups .
one way anova revealed significant difference across the groups for hdlc ( p = 0.039 ) and tc : hdlc ratios ( p = 0.013 ) only .
individuals heterozygous for epsilon3 / 4 alleles have had lowest average hdlc and highest tc : hdlc ratio followed by epsilon4 / 4 individuals and epsilon3 / 3 individuals .
the allele frequencies are as follows : epsilon2 = 0.100 ; epsilon3 = 0.771 , and epsilon4 = 0.129 and the genotype frequencies are : epsilon2 / 3 = 0.171 ; epsilon2 / 4 = 0.029 ; epsilon3 / 4 = 0.114 ; epsilon3 / 3 = 0.629 , and epsilon4 / 4 = 0.057 ( not shown in tables ) .

previous studies from other parts of india have had reported the allele frequencies ranges from 0.031 to 0.094 for epsilon2 ; 0.803 - 0.968 for epsilon3 , and 0.000 - 0.133 for epsilon4 .
the present study from eastern india have had shown an almost similar frequency of epsilon4 allele .
it has been found that individuals with epsilon3 / 4 combination as well as homozygous for epsilon4 allele ( epsilon4 / 4 ) have significantly higher occurrence of dyslipidaemia compare to other genotypes combinations .
the occurrence of dyslipidaemia as found in the study could be summarized in the following way ( decreasing order ) : epsilon3 / 4 < epsilon4 / 4 < epsilon3 / 3 < epsilon2 / 4 < epsilon2 / 3 .
in a similar study on omani dyslipidaemic patients , it was observed that thirty - one percent of patients with chd had the apoe * 4 allele compared to 26 % with the apoe * 3 allele , but this difference was not significant. [ 39 ] in another study , it was observed that the prevalence of the epsilon4 - containing phenotypes were significantly higher in ischemic patients and that apo epsilon4 is an independent risk factor associated with an altered lipid profiles. [ 40 ] in the ouro preto admixed population in brazil , it demonstrated that the presence of apoe * 2 can confer a protective effect , whereas the presence of apoe * 4 implies an enhanced risk for dyslipidemia. [ 41 ] the major limitation of the study was that it was performed on a small sample size and therefore is not representative of asian indian population .
owing to ethnic and cultural heterogeneity in asian indian population , it is imperative to study the ethnic groups collectively , possibly through collaborative research .
this will give more insight into proper understanding of the association lying between apo e gene polymorphisms and dyslipidaemia among asian indians .
conclusion it seems that the allele frequency of epsilon4 is quite high in the present studied population as compare to most of the other parts of india .
prevalence of dyslipidaemia is significantly high among individuals with epsilon3 / 4 and epsilon4 / 4 genotypes compare to other combinations .
it seems reasonable to argue that epsilon4 allele has an independent effect on lipids metabolism particularly increased tc : hdlc ratio causing dyslipidaemia in the study population .

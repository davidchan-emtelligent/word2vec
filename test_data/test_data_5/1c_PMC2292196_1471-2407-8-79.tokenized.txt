background malignant gliomas are lethal cancers , highly dependent on angiogenesis and treatment options and prognosis still remain poor for patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( gbm ) .
ephs and ephrins have many well - defined functions during embryonic development of central nervous system such as axon mapping , neural crest cell migration , hindbrain segmentation and synapse formation as well as physiological and abnormal angiogenesis .
accumulating evidence indicates that eph and ephrins are frequently overexpressed in different tumor types including gbm .
however , their role in tumorigenesis remains controversial , as both tumor growth promoter and suppressor potential have been ascribed to eph and ephrins while the function of epha7 in gbm pathogenesis remains largely unknown .
methods in this study , we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of epha7 in a series of 32 primary and recurrent gbm and correlated it with clinical pathological parameters and patient outcome .
in addition , intratumor microvascular density ( mvd ) was quantified by immunostaining for endothelial cell marker von willebrand factor ( vwf ) .
results overexpression of epha7 protein was predictive of the adverse outcome in gbm patients , independent of mvd expression ( p = 0.02 ) .
moreover , high density of mvd as well as higher epha7 expression predicted the disease outcome more accurately than epha7 variable alone ( p = 0.01 ) .
there was no correlation between mvd and overall survival or recurrence - free survival ( p > 0.05 ) .
however , a statistically significant correlation between lower mvd and tumor recurrence was observed ( p = 0.003 ) .
conclusion the immunohistochemical assessment of tissue epha7 provides important prognostic information in gbm and would justify its use as surrogate marker to screen patients for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy .
background the incidence of brain tumors worldwide is about 7 in 100,000 per year [ 1,2 ] .
glioblastoma multiforme ( gbm ) , the most aggressive tumor among malignant gliomas , is the most common primary brain tumor in adults and represents a significant source of cancer - related death .
gbm usually recurs despite the most aggressive treatment via surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiation and / or chemotherapy [ 1,2 ] .
the poor prognosis of patients with gbm ( median survival ranging from 9 to 12 months , 5 - year survival rate close to 0 %) mandates the exploration of novel molecular mechanisms that might contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease and its resistance to therapy with the purpose of therapeutic targeting [ 1 - 3 ] .
receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) are known to be important regulators of cellular growth controlling cell proliferation , differentiation and migration [ 4,5 ] .
the eph receptors and their ligands , ephrins , represent the largest known family of rtks .
their role has been largely studied during the development of nervous system .
they are involved in the development of central nervous system , including axon guidance , axon fasciculation , neural crest cell migration , hindbrain segmentation , vasculogenesis and neuronal cell survival during embryonic development [ 6 - 13 ] .
eph receptors and ephrin ligands are classified into a and b subfamily , on the basis of their sequence , homologies , structures , and binding affinities .
epha receptors bind the glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) - anchored ephrin - a ligands , whereas ephb receptors bind the transmembrane ephrin - b ligands , whose cytoplasmic domain is capable to engage in various signaling activities ; an exception is the epha4 receptor that binds ephrin - b2 and ephrin - b3 as well as ephrin - a ligands [ 14 - 16 ] .
moreover , these rtks have the ability to induce both forward and reverse ( bi - directional ) signaling between adjacent interacting cells .
to date , various studies have investigated the involvement of the eph - rtks in several pathogenetic processes in the nervous system .
ephb2 and ephrin - b2 signaling participate in the glial scarring process after spinal cord trauma [ 17 ] .
the phosphorylation ratio of r - ras was closely linked to the phosphorylation ratio of ephb2 in glioblastoma tissues [ 18 ] .
additionally , the phosphorylation ratio of ephb2 is an important mechanism that mediates glioma cell migration and invasion [ 19 ] .
ephrin - b2 and ephb4 were overexpressed by endothelial cells of human malignant gliomas [ 20 ] .
ephrin - b3 was also demonstrated as an important factor regulating glioma cell invasion through rac1 gtpase [ 21 ] .
epha2 protein was overexpressed in gbm and anaplastic astrocytoma tissues and was identified as a novel target for the development of glioma vaccines [ 22,23 ] .
another group confirmed overexpression of epha2 expression in gbm cells , probably through decreased interaction between epha2 receptor and its inhibitory ligand ephrin - a1 in malignant cells [ 19 ] .
epha7 ( formerly known as mdk1 / ebk / ehk ) is highly conserved in vertebrates from fish to human [ 24 ] .
it is widely expressed in embryonic tissues , especially developing central nervous system [ 25 ] .
epha7 cooperates with other epha receptors in cell signaling , but in contrast to other eph receptors , it contains two developmentally regulated isoforms : a full - length version containing the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a truncated form that lacks this domain [ 26 ] .
immunoreactivity for the full - length wild type receptor is found in all cell populations expressing epha7 mrna in mouse embryo heads and developing brain , while the truncated epha7 is absent in the embryos .
interestingly , both isoforms show striking distributions in adult mouse brain [ 27 ] .
the full - length epha7 is strongly expressed in neuropil ; in contrast the truncated epha7 is conspicuous on cell bodies and proximal dendrites of a limited number of neuronal types [ 28 ] .
the truncated form of epha7 acts as a dominant negative antagonist , suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of the full - length epha7 receptor and shifts the cellular response from repulsion to adhesion .
additionally , epha7 is probably essential during closure of the neural folds , since epha7 - null mice displayed lack of the neural folds resembling anencephaly in man [ 29 ] .
moreover , epha7 has been identified as an important molecular cue expressed after spinal cord injury , implicated in glial apoptosis [ 30 ] .
recent work indicated epha7 as an important mediator of neural progenitor apoptosis during brain development [ 31 ] .
however , little is currently known about its role in brain tumor angiogenesis and pathogenesis .
in the present study , we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of epha7 and correlated it with clinical pathological parameters and tumor vascularity .
we provide evidence that epha7 is overexpressed in gbm and suggest that this receptor might be used as a new diagnostic and prognostic marker for further eph / ephrin targeted molecular cancer therapy .
methods tissues tumor samples of 32 patients with histologically confirmed gbm , who iv , ( 26 primary gbm , 6 recurrent gbms and 10 normal brain samples ) were obtained from the department of neuropathology , marburg university hospital , germany .
approval for immunohistochemical study conduct in this gbm tissue bank had been obtained by the university authorities together with the signed consent of the patients .
the patients underwent surgery and received adjuvant radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy using the schema acnu and vm - 26 .
the first follow - up occurred 6 weeks after therapy was completed .
subsequent follow - ups were scheduled every 3 months .
in addition to clinical investigations and monitoring of indices of recurrence , a radiological examination was performed to detect possible relapses .
disease progression was defined according to who criteria by either an increase of at least 25 % in tumor size or any new tumor identified by ct or mri scan .
normal brain samples , which included cortex and white matter , were obtained from autopsy cases without any evidences of brain tumor or other brain disease .
totally , five cases of male and five cases of female ( age ranging from 27 to 70 years , average : 48.6 years ) were obtained .
immunohistochemistry immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin fixed , paraffin - embedded tissue .
samples slides were passed through a sequence of roti - histol ( carl roth , karlsruhe , germany ) and graded alcohol and then rinsed in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) .
after rinsing with pbs , the slides were treated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide in pbs for 15 min at room temperature in order to abolish endogenous peroxidase activity .
subsequently , the slides were treated with 5 % blocking serum for 1 hour .
following this , slides were incubated overnight at 4degreesc with a rabbit anti - human epha7 polyclonal antibody ( h - 55 ) against amino acids of human epha7 ( 1:100 dilution ; santa cruz biotechonology , heidelberg , germany ) , or rabbit anti - human factor viii ( von willebrand factor , vwf ) polyclonal antibody ( 1:400 dilution ; dako cytomation , carpinteria , ca ) .
in negative controls , the primary antibody was replaced with 1 x pbs .
the signal was enhanced by using biotinylated polyclonal goat - anti - rabbit igg with streptavidin - hrp ( dako cytomation , carpinteria , ca ) for 30 minutes .
the colour was developed after 5 minutes incubation with 3,3 - diaminobenzidine ( dab ) solution and sections were weakly counterstained with hematoxylin for 10 seconds .
evaluation of epha7 expression the membranous and cytoplasmic expression of epha7 on tumor cells was assessed at a x400 magnification .
the assigned score first reflects the staining intensity a ( 0 , negative ; 1 , weak ; 2 , moderate ; 3 , high ) and second the percentage of positive cells b ( 0 , no positive cells ; 1 , < 25 % positive cells ; 2 , 25 to 50 % positive cells ; 3 , > 50 % positive cells ) .
an overall score of 3 is defined as positive staining .
the scoring was performed separately by two independent observers who were blinded to the clinical data .
any discrepancies were resolved on the conference microscope .
evaluation of mvd at " hot spot " of tumor angiogenesis tumor angiogenesis can be reflected by mvd in the most vascularised areas of tumor tissue .
mvd , as highlighted by factor viii - related antigen immunostaining , was assessed without knowledge of the patient 's clinical outcome , as described by weidner et al [ 32 ] .
briefly , each slide was scanned at low magnification ( x100 ) to identify four areas with the highest density of microvessel ( hot - spots ) .
each hot - spot was then evaluated at high power magnification ( x200 ) for the number of stained microvessels per field in a 0.7386 mm2 surface area .
vwf - positive stained blood vessels with a complete lumen as well as cell clusters without lumina were considered as individual microvessels .
the final microvessel score was the average of vessel counts from four fields assessed by a high power magnification field ( x200 ) .
statistical analysis survival curves were estimated using the kaplan - meier method .
the distributions of survival were compared using the log rank test .
the chi - square test was employed to determine the association between epha7 expression intensity on tumor cells and mvd .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
all statistical analysis was performed using spss software .
results demographic factors 32 patients with histologically confirmed primary and recurrent gbm , who grade iv , were studied .
the mean age at diagnosis was 54.3 years ( range 31 - 71 ) .
no significant difference in age distribution between male ( 21 cases ) and female ( 11 cases ) was detected .
all of the 32 patients showed a relapse between 1 and 22 months after surgery and subsequently died of the disease ( median survival 15 months ) .
epha7 immunoreactivity in gbm and normal brain tissues in 22 of 32 patients , epha7 immunoreactivity was observed on the prominent membrane and cytoplasm of tumor cells showing different intensities of epha7 protein .
representative photomicrographs illustrating specimens with negative and strong epha7 expression in tumor cells are presented in fig. 1a and 1b , respectively .
epha7 protein expression in glioma cells of 10 normal brain tissues analyzed was undetectable as it was shown in fig. 1e. of the 32 gbm analyzed , strong expression of epha7 ( staining intensities of from 6 to 9 ) was observed in 14 cases ( 43.7 %) of gbm .
the staining was specific in both tumor and endothelial cells , with minimal staining of surrounding connective tissues .

epha7 associated with mvd in gbm all tumors were stained with vwf and microvessels were counted as a measure of tumor 's angiogenic activity .
the median mvd of 30 vessels was treated as a cutpoint .
high mvd was noted in areas where overexpression of epha7 was marked ( table 1 ) .
representative examples of low or high mvd were showed in fig 1c and 1d , respectively .
there was a statistically significant correlation between expression of epha7 and mvd in the tumors ( p = 0.004 , table 1 ) .

the median mvd of 30 vessels was used as a cutpoint .
epha7 immunoreactivity predicted overall survival but not recurrence - free survival the median survival of patients with positive epha7 expression was reduced in comparison with patients with negative epha7 expression .
epha7 protein expression showed an inverse correlation with the overall survival ( p = 0.02 , fig. 2a ) .
however , the level of epha7 expression did not emerge as a prognostic factor for recurrence - free survival of gbm patients ( p = 0.51 , fig. 2b ) .
there was no correlation between mvd and overall survival or recurrence - free survival ( p > 0.05 , data not shown ) .
we further explored the prognostic relationship using epha7 in combination with mvd .
the study cohort could be divided into 3 groups based on expression for epha7 and mvd combination : epha7 (+)/ high mvd ( n = 12 ) , epha7 (+)/ low mvd ( n = 10 ) , epha7 ( - )/ high mvd ( n = 0 ) , epha7 ( - )/ low mvd ( n = 10 ) .
as shown in fig. 2c , high density of mvd as well as epha7 expression predicted for the disease outcome more accurately than eph variable alone ( p = 0.01 ) .

( a ) increased epha7 expression was significantly associated with dead of disease ( p = 0.02 by log - rank test ) , when positive epha7 ( score = 4 - 9 ) expressing tumors were plotted against negative epha7 expressing tumors ( score = 0 - 3 ) .
( b ) epha7 expression revealed no significance for recurrence - free survival .
( c ) epha7 expression in combination with high mvd showed an inverse outcome ( p = 0.01 ) .
clinical features associated with epha7 or mvd statistical correlation was detected between the expression levels of epha7 or mvd and clinical pathological parameters such as age , gender and tumor status ( table 2 ) .
a statistically significant correlation between higher mvd and tumor recurrence was observed ( p = 0.003 ) .
in addition , positive epha7 expression was associated with increased age of patients (> 55 years , p = 0.003 ) .

the median mvd of 30 vessels was used as a cutpoint .
discussion there is currently an urgent need for development of alternative , effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to gbm .
the survival of patients with gbm may depend on the identification of novel targets .
epha2 receptor has already been recognized as a potential molecular marker and target in gbm for the development of novel biological therapeutic agents [ 22,23,33 ] .
whereas several studies in recent years have clearly indicated that altered expression of eph receptors and ephrin ligands is associated with increased potential for tumor growth , angiogenesis , metastasis and adverse outcome [ 34 - 42 ] , few studies have addressed the role of epha7 in tumor pathogenicity. by employing immunohistochemical techniques we have found that epha7 protein is predictive for the outcome of patients with gbm , independent of mvd expression .
the data in the present study revealed for the first time a strong correlation between epha7 overexpression and patient survival .
hafner c , et al. found that epha7 is highly expressed in kidney vasculature [ 43 ] .
the mrna of epha7 is strongly upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma as compared with healthy liver tissue and is downregulated in colon carcinomas .
epha7 is also transcriptionally activated in lung cancer [ 44 ] .
furthermore , overexpression of epha7 protein is frequently found in younger patients and in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma [ 45 ] .
epha7 expression is frequently silenced in human colorectal carcinoma by aberrant promoter methylation [ 46 ] .
epha7 is located on 6q16.1 , a region in close proximity to the chromosome 6 breakpoint found in various types of cancer [ 47 ] .
although our findings are not consistent with wang et al , who found a significant downregulation of epha7 in colorectal carcinoma [ 46 ] , they are in line with previous reports reporting a tumor promoter role in lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 43,44 ] , implicating tumor type - specific function for different eph family members .
eph receptors expressed in different cell types may have opposite effects due to cell - type specific intracellular signaling pathway [ 4 ] .
indeed , ephb4 receptor has been identified as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer , through activation of abl - crk antioncogenic pathway [ 48 ] , while the same receptor presented a tumorigenic potential in mesothelioma , favoring uncontrolled cell growth , migration , and tumor progression [ 49 ] .
moreover , membrane - bound ephrins trigger eph receptor phosphorylation , while soluble forms can bind to eph receptor , but do not trigger receptor activation [ 50 ] .
murine and human peripheral lymphocytes secrete a truncated form of epha7 [ 51 ] .
truncated eph receptors retaining their ligand - binding capacity have been shown to block activation of the full - length receptor [ 52 ] .
promoter hypermethylation and silencing of epha7 in mature b - cell lymphomas may serve to eliminate the inhibitory activity of secreted epha7 on tumor - promoting epha7 receptor signaling , thus enhancing tumor cell spread and recruitment of accessory cells able to promote tumor growth [ 51 ] .
a recent study on signaling pathways involved in epha7 rtk reported that direct epha7 knockdown can result in attenuation of erk1 / 2 phosphorylation and induce apoptosis of leukemia cells , suggesting the impact of epha7 on the growth of tumor cells [ 45 ] .
it is of interest that positive epha7 expression was closely associated with increased age of patients (> 55 years ). whether this is a random finding or not deserves further investigation .
the unfavorable prognostic influence of epha7 in gbm could be attributed to the well - recognised role of eph rtks in tumor angiogenesis .
indeed , in this study a statistically significant correlation between expression of epha7 and mvd was noted in gbm specimens .
another important observation was epha7 overexpression in both vasculature as well as tumor cells .
the process of angiogenesis plays a central role in tumor growth and in the development of distant metastases by facilitating the entry of cells into circulation [ 52 - 55 ] .
a vast biochemical and genetic evidence has implicated the critical role of eph / ephrin signaling in angiogenesis , despite of vegfr2 and tie2 receptors long been recognized as key players in this process [ 53,54 ] .
angiogenetic activity can be measured histologically by mvd , which has been shown to be an independent prognostic parameter in various malignancies including gliomas [ 56 - 58 ] .
however , other studies on angiogenesis of glioblastomas suggested the limited usage of mvd as prognostic parameter due to the complexity of the microvascular network in gbm [ 59,60 ] .
although no correlation between mvd and overall survival or recurrence - free survival was found in our study , we observed a statistically significant correlation between lower mvd and tumor recurrence .
further prospective studies with large numbers of patients are , however , needed to fully clarify the clinical implications of mvd in gbm recurrence .
conclusion taken together , our data illustrated that epha7 could be a potential candidate as a prognostic tumor marker and a new targeted therapeutic assessment in primary and recurrent gbm .
based on our findings , there might be a possible relationship between epha7 and tumor neovascularization .
recent data demonstrating inhibition of angiogenesis through epha receptor blockade in two different animal tumor models are consistent with our observation [ 52 ] .
additional experimental work is necessary to unveil the biologic pathway linking eph / ephrins with tumor growth in cancer cells and tumor - associated vessels of gbm and further studies are needed before epha7 becomes established as an important prognostic and predictive tool in gbm .
ultimately , specific epha7 inhibitors may prove to be of therapeutic value .

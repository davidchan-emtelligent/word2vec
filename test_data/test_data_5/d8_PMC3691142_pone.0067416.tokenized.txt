platelets are subcellular fragments which circulate in blood and have well established roles in thrombosis and haemostasis in adults .
upon activation , platelets undergo granule exocytosis and express p - selectin on the cell membrane which binds a ligand on monocytes , leading to monocyte - platelet aggregation .
elevated circulating monocyte - platelet aggregates in adults are linked to atherothrombosis , but have not been investigated in children where thrombosis is less common .
this study aimed to measure monocyte - platelet aggregate formation in children using whole blood flow cytometry .
monocyte - platelet aggregates as well as activation and granule exocytosis of platelets were measured in healthy adults ( n = 15 , median age 28 years ) and healthy children ( n = 28 , median age 7 years ) .
monocyte - platelet aggregates in healthy children were elevated compared to healthy adults ( 37.8 +/ - 4.4 % vs 15.5 +/ - 1.9 % respectively , p < 0.01 ) .
however , this was not accompanied by any difference in platelet activation ( pac - 1 binding 6.8 +/ - 1.5 % vs 6.3 +/ - 2.0 % respectively , p = ns ) or granule exocytosis ( p - selectin expression 4.4 +/ - 0.5 % vs 3.1 +/ - 0.5 % respectively , p = ns ) .
despite comparable numbers of platelets bound per monocyte ( gpib mfi 117.3 +/ - 13.7 vs 130.9 +/ - 28.6 respectively , p = ns ) , surface p - selectin expression per platelet - bound monocyte was lower in children compared to adults .
we therefore provide the first data of elevated monocyte - platelet aggregates in healthy children .

introduction platelets are small cell fragments of large importance in medicine .
their role in haemostasis and the late stage thrombotic complications of cardiovascular disease are well characterised [ 1 ] .
however , platelets also play an important and central role in inflammation [ 2 ] , with recently discovered antigen presenting capacity [ 3 ] and ability to influence the phenotype of other blood and vascular cells through cell - cell signalling [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
monocyte - platelet aggregate ( mpa ) formation is a sensitive marker of platelet activation in adults and is an early marker of acute atherothrombotic events [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
the mechanism by which mpas form in adults has been well characterized , where activated platelets which have undergone exocytosis express alpha - granule p - selectin ( cd62p ) on the cell surface .
the platelet p - selectin then interacts with p - selectin glycoprotein ligand - 1 ( psgl - 1 ) , which is constitutively expressed on the surface of circulating monocytes [ 8 ] .
following this initial tethering , the beta2 integrin mac - 1 ( cd11b / 18 ) , and to a lesser extent lfa - 1 on the monocyte stabilise the adhesion [ 9 ] .
however , these interactions do not develop if psgl - 1 is blocked , or cd62p is not expressed on the platelet [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
in addition to acting as a marker of platelet activation , the heterotypic cellular association between monocytes and platelets triggers an adhesive and pro - inflammatory monocyte phenotype [ 5 ] , [ 12 ] .
although incompletely characterised , this is thought to arise both through outside - in signalling of the adhesion receptors interacting with the platelet surface , and through in situ delivery of pro - inflammatory platelet granule contents to the monocyte [ 5 ] , [ 12 ] - [ 19 ] .
monocyte - platelet aggregates promote a pro - thrombotic milieu at the site of platelet activation , and are suggested to contribute to atherogenesis and progression of coronary artery disease ( cad ) [ 5 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
a potential role for sub - clinical platelet activation as a contributor to cardiovascular risk is emerging [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] .
important age - related quantitative changes have been reported in haemostatic factors [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] platelet count [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] and reactivity [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] among children , including decreasing soluble p - selectin in serum with age [ 28 ] .
these age - related changes in haemostasis have important implications in the clinical management of children [ 23 ] .
measurement of monocyte - platelet aggregates is used as a surrogate marker of early platelet activation in paediatric research for many thromboinflammatory diseases , including acute myocardial infarction , cystic fibrosis and thrombocytopenia [ 14 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
however , the formation of mpas in children and their circulating levels has not been systematically investigated in healthy children .
we therefore sought to measure formation of mpas in healthy children , and compare them with adults .
results circulating mpas were increased in children compared to adults as shown in figure 1a ( 37.8 +/ - 4.4 % vs. 15.5 +/ - 1.9 % respectively , p < 0.01 ) .
however , when circulating platelets were examined for surface markers of activation with no addition of agonists ex vivo , there was no corresponding increase in activation of the gpiib / iiia receptor as measured by pac - 1 binding ( 6.8 +/ - 1.5 % vs. 6.3 +/ - 2.0 % respectively , p = ns ) ( figure 1b ) ; or platelet granule exocytosis , as measured by p - selectin expression ( 4.4 +/ - 0.5 % vs. 3.1 +/ - 0.5 % respectively , p = ns ) ( figure 1c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0067416.g001 figure 1 elevated circulating monocyte - platelet aggregates ( mpas ) in children with no increase in platelet activation or exocytosis .
monocytes were identified by characteristic forward and side laser scatter and differential expression of cd14 , while mpas were determined by co - expression of platelet - specific gpix ( cd42a ) on monocyte events and gates were determined by appropriate isotypic control .
the percentage of monocyte - platelet aggregates as a function of overall monocytes was recorded ( panel a ) platelets were identified by characteristic forward and side laser scatter and expression of platelet - specific gpibalpha , with a threshold discriminator on cd42b - pc5 .
the percentage of platelets with pac - 1 fitc fluorescence above the eptifibatide - blocked control ( panel b ) or p - selectin expression above isotype control was recorded ( panel c ) .
data shown are mean +/ - sem ( adults n = 15 , children n = 28 ) .
in order to determine whether circulating monocyte - platelet aggregates in children formed as a result of the p - selectin / psgl - 1 adhesion mechanism known to be responsible for this process in adults , the relative mfi of p - selectin on platelet - bound and - unbound monocyte events was examined .
p - selectin expression of platelets bound to circulating monocytes in blood from children have significantly lower p - selectin expression compared to platelets bound to monocytes in circulating blood from adults ( 17.8 +/ - 3.5 vs. 58.5 +/ - 15.8 mfi respectively , p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2 ) .
however , ex vivo chemical stimulation of whole blood to with 50 microm trap - 6 , a specific agonist of the platelet protease activated receptor , resulted in equal expression of p - selectin on monocyte - platelet aggregates between adults and children .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0067416.g002 figure 2 expression of p - selectin ( cd62p ) mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) of monocytes with and without platelets bound , with and without the chemical platelet agonist trap - 6 ( positive control ) in children and adults .
circulating mpas in children had lower p - selectin expression than adults , but could be induced to express p - selectin by chemical stimulation .
data shown are mean mfi +/ - sem ( adults n = 4 and children n = 4 ) .
in order to compare the relative number of platelets bound per monocyte without ex vivo chemical stimulation , the expression of platelet - specific gpix ( cd42a ) was compared .
mean fluorescent intensity of cd42a from children ( 117.3 +/ - 13.7 mfi ) was not different to adults ( 130.9 +/ - 28.6 mfi , p = ns ) , indicating similar number of platelets bound per monocyte .
discussion we provide the first evidence of elevated mpas without ex vivo chemical stimulation in children .
platelets bound to monocytes in children did not show the elevation of p - selectin expression associated with mpa formation in adults .
these results suggest that circulating mpas in children are not a result of increased platelet activation and granule exocytosis , and that a p - selectin independent mechanism of mpa formation may be more important in mpa formation in children .
these findings are very different to what has been described in adults .
this is the first report of such age - specific differences in monocytes platelet interaction and it is consistent with our previous findings of age - dependent changes in other haemostatic and platelet parameters .
the lower p - selectin expression on circulating mpas in children was not associated with a corresponding decrease in cd42a expression , indicating similar numbers of platelets bound per monocyte in mpas from children and adults .
further testing by stimulation with a supra - maximal concentration of the chemical platelet agonist trap - 6 demonstrated that platelets bound to monocytes from both children and adult blood could be induced to a similar maximal expression of p - selectin .
therefore , while the majority of circulating mpas form in the absence of platelet activation in children , there is the capacity for both platelet activation - dependent and - independent formation of monocyte - platelet aggregates .
this also confirms that the binding of anti - cd62p monoclonal antibodies to platelets that are already bound through p - selectin / psgl - 1 mechanisms is not impaired in our assay .
age related differences in relative abundance of monocytes and platelets [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 31 ] might potentially contribute to the observed differences in the level of mpas in blood from children .
in order to test this hypothesis , we collected and analysed full blood counts and mpas on a subset of samples from 5 adults and 6 children ( data not shown ) .
no correlation ( spearman 's rank test ) of mpas with either absolute platelet count , monocyte count or the ratio of platelet to monocyte count was observed .
pre - analytical variables , especially with relation to blood collection , are known to affect parameters of platelet function , including mpas .
we performed preliminary experiments using different sample collection methods using direct venipuncture compared with blood drawn through indwelling catheter .
this confirmed the need for blood collection procedures to be consistent , and so blood from healthy adult volunteers was drawn through an indwelling catheter to match routine paediatrics collection in this setting .
bloods were collected using the same peripheral cannula type and size into the same type of anticoagulant tubes. with this stringent standardization , difference in mpas formation we reported here is unlikely attributed by the pre - analytical variables .
while not routinely used as a diagnostic assay in clinical medicine , whole blood flow cytometric measurement of monocyte - platelet aggregates is considered an early and sensitive marker of in vivo platelet activation and atherothrombosis in adults [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] , and proposed as a potential diagnostic tool in the assessment of acute coronary syndromes [ 9 ] .
monocyte - platelet aggregates have also been used as a sensitive marker of platelet activation in the context of thromboinflammatory disease state of relevance to paediatric populations , such as cystic fibrosis [ 29 ] .
however , in the current study circulating monocyte - platelet aggregates observed in healthy children were not associated with platelet activation , and the adherent platelets had not undergone exocytosis .
therefore care must be taken in the use of mpas as a marker of platelet activation in children .
while mpas in adults are thought to contribute to atherogenesis through promotion of an inflammatory phenotype and by localizing monocytes to the endothelium , circulating mpas in children are unlikely to play a role in this process in the absence of p - selectin and platelet activation .
further research should be directed at understanding the different mechanisms and phyisiological consequences of monocytes - platelets interaction in children .
the potential role for this physiological adhesion between unactivated platelets and monocytes in the protection of children from a number of clinically significant platelet mediated diseases such as heparin induced thrombocytopenia [ 32 ] deserves further exploration .
it is well established in adult blood that following initial tethering to activated platelets by p - selectin / psgl - 1 interaction , firm adhesion via bridging fibrinogen bound to the activated gpiib - iiia integrin [ 33 ] and via direct interaction with gpibalpha [ 34 ] .
our finding of elevated monocyte - platelet tethering in children without elevated p - selectin expression therefore warrants further investigation into the role and relative importance of other adhesion molecules , such as mac - 1 , lfa - 1 and icam - 2 , which may have a role in the in the observed formation of circulating monocyte - platelet aggregates in the absence of p - selectin .
following granule exocytosis and exposure of p - selectin on activated platelets , p - selectin is rapidly cleaved while activated platelets continue to circulate and function [ 35 ] .
it is therefore possible that the elevated circulating mpas in children represent platelets that are initially bound to monocytes in vivo through p - selectin expression and that subsequently , but prior to blood collection , p - selectin is cleaved off with the platelet remaining tethered to the monocyte through other adhesion molecules .
in summary , this is the first observation of increased monocyte - platelet aggregation occurs in healthy children compared to healthy adults .
this interaction occurs without the increased expression of p - selectin seen with mpa formation in adults , suggesting a different physiological monocyte - platelet interaction in this young population .
this interaction could contribute to the thromboprotective mechanism observed in children .
further investigation of the phenotypic consequences of platelet adhesion to monocytes in the absence of p - selectin is warranted .
materials and methods participants and blood collection institutional human research ethics approval ( rmit university human research ethics committee reference 55 / 11 and royal children 's hospital melbourne human research ethics committee reference 20031 ) was obtained for the research and the procedure of gaining consent .
for adults , written informed consent was obtained , while for children both verbal assent from the child and written consent from a parent were obtained .
blood from healthy volunteer adults ( n = 15 , age 20 - 43 years old , median age 28 years old ) and healthy children of either gender ( n = 28 , age 1 - 14 years old , median age 7 years old ) scheduled for minor day surgery ( e.g. trigger thumb release ) was collected .
subjects did not receive any antiplatelet medication and had no family history of haematological disorders .
whole blood was collected from peripheral cannula into s - monovette tubes ( sarstedt , australia ) , containing 1 volume of citrate per 9 volumes of blood according to protocols previously described [ 22 ] .
in order to minimise pre - analytical variables , blood collection procedures and blood handling for adults and children were identical .
assays flow cytometer setup and calibration all analyses were performed on a facs calibur flow cytometer ( becton dickinson , australia ) .
fluorophores were excited by a 30 mw 488 nm argon sapphire laser .
fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) emission was collected in the wavelength range 515 - 545 nm ( 530 / 30 band pass ) , phycoerythrin ( pe ) emission was collected in the wavelength range 564 - 606 nm ( 585 / 42 band pass ) and tandem phycoerythrin - cy5 ( pe - cy5 ) emission was collected in the wavelength > 670 nm ( 670 long pass ) .
voltages to photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) collecting each wavelength range were established to ensure emission peaks for unstained and positively stained cells fell within the linear range of the instrument ( i.e. between first and third decades of mfi ) .
voltages were individually calibrated for platelet and monocyte - platelet parameters against hard - dyed broad spectrum 3.0 - 3.4 microm 8 peak calibration particles of known concentration of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome ( mesf ) ( spherotech , usa ) as previously described [ 36 ] .
briefly , for each day in which samples were analysed , 8 peak rainbow beads were first analysed and pmt voltages adjusted such that each peak of fluorochrome labelled beads of known mesf appear in the appropriate channel for each bandwidth range .
compensation for spectral overlap between all fluorophores was determined using platelets and monocytes with high and low expression individually single stained with antibody .
a mixed population of high and low expressing cells was created by partial activation of platelets using 2 microm trap - 6 .
effective compensation was verified by antibody titration on high expressing cells ( figure 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0067416.g003 figure 3 compensation of spectral overlap for fitc and pe. compensation matrices were determined with single colour controls of high and low expressing cells and accurate compensation confirmed by antibody titration .
measurement of platelet activation and exocytosis platelet activation was measured by whole blood flow cytometric determination of pac - 1 binding , a monoclonal antibody which recognizes integrin alphaiibbeta3 in its high affinity activated conformation , indicating activation dependent inside - out signalling has occurred .
granule exocytosis was measured by expression of p - selectin , an alpha - granule component not normally expressed on the surface of resting platelets but expressed following fusion of granule and cell membranes .
briefly , within 30 min of collection whole blood was diluted 1:5 with hepes saline ( 10 mm hepes , 0.15 m nacl , ph 7.3 - 7.4 ) and incubated with an antibody cocktail containing 1.0 microg.ml - 1 pc5 conjugated anti - cd42b monoclonal antibody ( clone hip1 , becton dickinson pharmingen , usa ) , 6.25 microg.ml - 1 fitc conjugated pac - 1 ( becton dickinson , australia ) with or without blockade by 5 microg.ml - 1 eptifibatide ( schering - plough , australia ) , and pe conjugated anti - cd62p monoclonal antibody ( clone ak4 , becton dickinson , australia ) or 1 microg.ml - 1 pe conjugated mouse igg1kappa isotypic control ( clone mopc - 21 , becton dickinson , australia ) .
after 15 min of incubation the reaction was stopped with addition of 800 microl of 1 % formaldehyde ( sigma aldrich , usa ) in hepes - saline .
platelets activated with 50 microm of thrombin receptor activating peptide , trap - 6 ( sigma aldrich , australia ) were analysed with each sample as a positive control .
platelets were identified by characteristic forward and side laser scatter and expression of platelet - specific gpibalpha ( cd42b ) .
the percentage of platelets with fluorescence above the eptifibatide - blocked or isotype controls was recorded .
measurement of monocyte - platelet aggregate ( mpa ) formation circulating mpas were measured by whole blood flow cytometry with previously described methods [ 1 ] .
briefly , within 20 minutes of collection whole blood was incubated with an antibody cocktail containing 1.0 microg.ml - 1 fitc conjugated anti - cd42a monoclonal antibody ( clone alma.16 , becton dickinson , australia ) or 1.67 microg.ml - 1 fitc conjugated mouse igg1kappa isotypic control and 0.5 microg.ml - 1 pc5 conjugated anti - cd14 monocloncal antibody ( clone rmo52 , beckman coulter immunotech , australia ) with or without trap - 6 .
after 15 minutes of incubation , the reaction mixture was stopped with 800 microl of facs lysing solution ( becton dickinson , australia ) and stored at 2 - 8degreesc in the dark until analysis .
monocytes were identified by characteristic forward and side laser scatter and differential expression of cd14 , while mpas were determined by co - expression of platelet - specific gpix ( cd42a ) on monocyte events .
gates were determined by appropriate isotypic control .
in a subset of samples , p - selectin expression of monocyte - bound platelets was quantified by addition of cd62p - pe ( clone ak - 4 ) to the antibody cocktail , with sequential gating and fluorochrome compensation as previously described [ 5 ] .
statistical analysis data shown are mean +/ - sem .
results for children and adults were compared using the non - parametric wilcoxon rank sum test .

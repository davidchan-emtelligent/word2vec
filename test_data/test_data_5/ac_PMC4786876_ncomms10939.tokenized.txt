retromer organizes the endosomal sorting pathway in conjunction with various sorting nexin ( snx ) proteins .
the snx27 - retromer complex has recently been identified as a major endosomal hub that regulates endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling by preventing lysosomal entry of cargoes .
here , we show that snx27 directly interacts with fam21 , which also binds retromer , within the wiskott - aldrich syndrome protein and scar homologue ( wash ) complex .
this interaction is required for the precise localization of snx27 at an endosomal subdomain as well as for recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes .
furthermore , fam21 prevents cargo transport to the golgi apparatus by controlling levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate , which facilitates cargo dissociation at the golgi .
together , our results demonstrate that the snx27 - retromer - wash complex directs cargoes to the plasma membrane by blocking their transport to lysosomes and the golgi .
endosomes maintain cellular homeostasis by sorting , recycling and degrading endocytosed cargoes .
here the authors show that the snx27 - retromer - wash complex acts as a hub to direct cargoes to the plasma membrane by blocking their transport to lysosomes and golgi apparatus .
the endosomal network controls numerous cellular functions such as signalling , nutrient uptake and development through balanced trafficking of diverse plasma membrane proteins12 .
after receiving membrane protein cargoes , endosomes sort them to lysosomes for degradation or else to the trans - golgi network ( tgn ) or plasma membrane for recycling34 .
this endosomal sorting pathway is elaborately regulated by retromer and its interacting proteins56 .
retromer , a multi - subunit complex that associates with the cytosolic face of endosomes , was originally identified for its ability to regulate retrograde transport from endosomes to the tgn78910 .
recent studies have expanded its regulatory role in not only endosome - to - tgn transport but also in endosome - to - plasma membrane transport611 .
retromer comprises a core trimer of vacuolar protein sorting - associated protein 35 ( vps35 ) , vps26 and vps29 as well as sorting nexin ( snx ) proteins that bind phosphoinositides12 .
although the composition of the vps trimer is conserved , it forms complexes with various snx proteins .
interactions of the vps trimer with snx1 / 2 and snx5 / 6 regulate retrograde transport of cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptors from endosomes to the tgn13 .
for retrograde transport of wntless to the tgn , retromer associates with snx3 ( ref. 14 ) .
more recently , the retromer complex associated with snx27 , a pdz - domain - containing snx protein , has been shown to regulate endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling of membrane proteins including the beta2 - adrenergic receptor ( beta2ar ) and the glucose transporter glut1 ( refs 6 , 11 ) .
thus , snx proteins appear to facilitate the cargo specificity of retromer1516 .
however , mechanisms for how retromer specifies destinations of individual cargoes remain unclear .
the wiskott - aldrich syndrome protein and scar homologue ( wash ) complex is a large , multiprotein complex consisting of family with sequence similarity 21 ( fam21 ) , strumpellin , swip , ccdc53 and wash1 ; it activates arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization on endosomes171819 .
wash complex depletion causes endosomal sorting defects in pathways such as recycling of transferrin ( tf ) receptor and integrins to the plasma membrane as well as retrograde transport of cation - independent mannose - 6 - phosphate receptor to the golgi apparatus202122 .
given that both snx27 and retromer bind the wash complex , the wash complex has been suggested to function in recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes , although a specific role has not been identified623 .
here , we have identified an interaction of snx27 with fam21 , the largest wash component , which is required for proper recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes .
this interaction restricts snx27 to an endosomal subdomain , aiding export of cargoes to their destinations .
moreover , fam21 prevents cargoes from being transported to the golgi apparatus by controlling golgi levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate [ pi ( 4 ) p ] , which facilitates a release of retromer cargoes around the golgi .
results fam21 interacts directly with snx27 to identify the wash complex component that binds snx27 directly , we conducted in vitro pull - down assays .
among the five core proteins of the wash complex , only fam21 interacted with snx27 fusion proteins purified from bacteria ( fig. 1a ) .
fam21 contains an n - terminal globular head domain and a c - terminal unstructured tail harbouring multiple l - f - [ d / e ] 3 - 10 - l - f ( lfa ) motifs ( fig. 1b ) ; it regulates the wash complex by interacting with various proteins through its different motifs .
fam21 links the wash complex to endosomes via retromer binding and inhibits actin - capping activity by binding the capz heterodimer via its c - terminus ; the fam21 n - terminus is required for binding within the wash complex to maintain its stability17222324 .
it is thus important to determine the region of fam21 responsible for binding snx27 .
we found that snx27 binds two distinct regions within the n - terminal domain of fam21 ( fig. 1c ) .
using additional approaches including co - immunoprecipitation ( fig. 1d ) , glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) - pulldowns ( fig. 1e ) and peptide - binding assays ( fig. 1f ) , we determined that residues 40 - 79 and 592 - 600 of fam21 are sufficient for binding snx27 directly .
binding of fam21 with snx27 mediates cargo recycling the wash complex has been suggested to be involved in endosome - to - plasma membrane transport mediated by the snx27 - retromer complex611 .
to investigate whether fam21 functions in recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes , we examined the localization of glut1 , a known cargo of the snx27 - retromer complex , after small interfering rna ( sirna ) transfection .
as previously reported6 , depletion of snx27 resulted in glut1 accumulation at lamp1 - positive lysosomes ( fig. 2a,b ) .
intriguingly , glut1 accumulated in the perinuclear region , not at lysosomes , in fam21 - depleted cells ( fig. 2a,b ) .
immunofluorescence staining of gm130 , a cis - golgi matrix protein , revealed that depletion of fam21 caused a selective accumulation of glut1 in the golgi region ( fig. 2c,d ) .
this finding was observed using two different sirna sequences targeting fam21 ( fig. 2d and supplementary fig. 1 ) , and thus it is likely not an off - target effect .
the mis - sorting of glut1 to the endocytic recycling compartment , which is adjacent to the golgi apparatus , was recently reported25 .
to determine the precise location of mis - sorted glut1 , we carefully analysed the immunofluorescent signals of glut1 , gm130 and tf near the golgi in fam21 - depleted cells .
the staining pattern of glut1 was continuous , like gm130 , rather than more punctate , like tf ( fig. 2e ) .
also , the co - localization coefficient of glut1 with gm130 was significantly higher than it was with tf ( fig. 2f ) .
the mis - sorted glut1 disappeared after treatment of brefeldin a ( bfa ) , which dissociates golgi membrane - associated proteins262728 , indicating that glut1 was associated with the golgi membranes ( fig. 2g ) .
the glut1 released from the golgi membranes by bfa did not localize to rab11 - positive recycling endosomal tubules , which were also induced by bfa treatment29 ( fig. 2g ) .
together , these results suggest that glut1 is mis - sorted to the golgi apparatus in fam21 - depleted cells .
to examine recycling of another snx27 - retromer cargo , we generated htert - rpe1 cells stably expressing beta2ar .
the beta2ar also accumulated at the golgi apparatus in fam21 - depleted cells ( fig. 2h,i ) .
mis - sorting defects induced by fam21 depletion seemed specific to snx27 - retromer cargoes because the localization of na,k - atpase , a transmembrane protein not affected by snx27 depletion , was unchanged in fam21 - depleted cells ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
these results indicate that fam21 is involved in recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes .
however , the fact that glut1 is mis - sorted into a different intracellular compartment upon fam21 depletion , as compared with snx27 or retromer depletion , implies a distinct role for fam21 with retromer in the recycling pathway .
direct binding of snx27 with vps26 is critical for protecting cargoes from lysosomal degradation6 , and we hypothesized that fam21 might regulate cargo recycling via snx27 binding .
we depleted endogenous snx27 in htert - rpe1 cells stably expressing sirna - resistant wild - type ( wt ) snx27 or various mutants ( fig. 3a,b ) .
the snx27 pdz domain is required for binding cargoes and vps26 , whereas the ferm domain is required for binding fam21 ( ref. 6 ; fig. 3c ) .
as previously reported6 , lysosomal mis - sorting of glut1 by snx27 depletion was corrected by expression of wt snx27 , but not by the deltapdz mutant ( fig. 3d,e and supplementary fig. 3a ) .
intriguingly , expression of the deltaferm mutant deficient in fam21 binding resulted in the same defect as fam21 depletion - - mis - sorting of glut1 into the golgi - - suggesting that the phenotype is due to a failure in fam21 binding ( fig. 3d,e and supplementary fig. 3b ) .
even so , we cannot completely exclude the possibility that other interactions of this domain , such as with ras and some cargo proteins , play a role .
consistent with a previous report6 , depletion of snx27 caused a reduction in glut1 levels , which was recovered by treatment of bafilomycin a1 , an inhibitor of vacuolar type h + - atpase , indicating that the decrease of glut1 was caused by enhanced lysosomal degradation ( fig. 3f ) .
the glut1 reduction upon snx27 depletion was also recovered by expression of wt snx27 , but only partially recovered by the deltaferm mutant ( fig. 3f ) , indicating that glut1 is not recycled properly and that its lysosomal degradation is still enhanced in the deltaferm mutant cells .
taken together , these data demonstrate that fam21 regulates proper recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes via its interaction with snx27 .
fam21 specifies snx27 localization at endosomal subdomains we investigated how fam21 regulates recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes .
first , we examined whether fam21 depletion affects the localization of snx27 , which serves as a cargo adaptor in the complex .
compared with control cells , the area staining for snx27 was significantly increased and more concentrated near the golgi in fam21 - depleted cells ( fig. 4a,b and supplementary fig. 4c,d ) .
however , depletion of fam21 did not alter the puncta size of eea1 , which is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the endosome membrane30 , indicating that the increase of snx27 signals is not due to an enlargement of the endosome itself ( supplementary fig. 4a - c ) .
eea1 signals were also concentrated near the golgi in fam21 - depleted cells ( supplementary fig. 4d ) , indicating that fam21 loss leads endosomes to be concentrated in the vicinity of the golgi .
fam21 depletion did not affect total protein levels of the endosomal marker proteins eea1 and rab5 , but remarkably increased snx27 levels , as assessed by immunoblotting ( fig. 4c ) .
a recently uncovered role of fam21 in modulation of nuclear factor - kappab gene transcription led us to examine snx27 transcript levels31 .
the mrna level of snx27 was not affected by fam21 depletion , suggesting that the increase of snx27 protein levels would occur in a translational or post - translational manner ( fig. 4d ) .
together , these results indicate that depletion of fam21 specifically affects snx27 levels without interfering with general endosome morphology .
as interaction with fam21 is critical for snx27 function , we hypothesized that the increase in snx27 might be caused by failure to interact with fam21 .
we took advantage of cells stably expressing wt snx27 or the deltaferm mutant that is deficient in fam21 binding .
wt snx27 and deltaferm showed distinct localization patterns within endosomes ; wt snx27 was localized to the subdomain of endosomes stained by eea1 , but exactly co - localized with fam21 ( fig. 4e,f ) .
in contrast , snx27 deltaferm was distributed throughout almost the entire area of endosomes , resulting in an increase of total puncta size as compared with wt ( fig. 4e,g ) .
specifically , the deltaferm mutant formed larger , ring - shaped and tubulated endosomes ( fig. 4e , magnified view , green ) .
fam21 was mostly located at the subdomain or tubules extruding from endosomes decorated by snx27 deltaferm ( fig. 4f ) , consistent with a previous study reporting that actin and wash complex are specifically located along beta2ar - positive tubules on endosomes32 .
using another cell line expressing a low level of deltaferm , we confirmed that the entire endosomal distribution of deltaferm was not due to higher expression than wt ( supplementary fig. 5 ) .
based on these results , we suggest that snx27 localizes to a specialized endosomal subdomain via fam21 interaction to sort cargoes to their correct destination , and that a failure of interaction with fam21 leads to dispersal of snx27 throughout the entire surface of endosomes .
fam21 maintains proper levels of pi ( 4 ) p at the golgi given that fam21 depletion causes accumulation of snx27 and its cargoes at the golgi , we examined the effect of fam21 depletion on the golgi to gain insight into mechanisms of fam21 in the recycling pathway .
when cells were stained for gm130 , a cis - golgi matrix protein , and tgn46 , a trans - golgi membrane protein , the immunostained golgi region was expanded in fam21 - depleted cells , to about twofold of that in control cells ( fig. 5a,b ) .
each intracellular organelle is identified by a specific subset of activated gtpases and specific lipids , permitting in the proper transport of proteins33 .
pi ( 4 ) p , a golgi - enriched phosphoinositide , facilitates release of retromer - associated cargoes at the tgn34 .
in addition , interactions of the wash complex with phospholipid and pi ( 4 ) p kinase type iialpha have been reported1735 .
therefore , we investigated the relationship of fam21 with pi ( 4 ) p or its kinases .
depletion of fam21 significantly increased levels of pi ( 4 ) p and pi4kb , one of three golgi - resident pi ( 4 ) p kinases , at the golgi ( fig. 5c - e ) .
the increase of golgi - localized pi4kb was not accompanied by changes in total pi4kb protein levels , whereas snx27 protein levels were increased ( fig. 5f ) .
to examine whether the accumulation of snx27 - retromer cargoes seen in fam21 - depleted cells was caused by an elevation of pi ( 4 ) p levels at the golgi , we depleted pi ( 4 ) p in fam21 - depleted cells ( fig. 5f ) .
transfection of an sirna targeting pi4kb effectively depleted pi ( 4 ) p from the golgi ( supplementary fig. 6a ) .
intriguingly , double knockdown of fam21 and pi4kb did not induce mis - sorting of glut1 ( fig. 5g,h ) , indicating that the mis - sorting is mediated by increased levels of pi ( 4 ) p. similar to the double knockdown result , treatment of fam21 - depleted cells with pao , a pi ( 4 ) - kinase inhibitor , or pik93 , an inhibitor of pi4kb ( ref .
36 ) , abolished glut1 accumulation at the golgi ( supplementary fig. 6b ) .
these data indicate that glut1 mis - sorting defects by fam21 depletion are caused by an elevation of golgi pi ( 4 ) p levels .
depletion of pi ( 4 ) p causes an accumulation of retromer - associated vesicles in the cytoplasm34 .
we also observed increased levels of snx27 in pi4kb - depleted cells by immunostaining ( fig. 5g ) .
however , this increase in pi4kb - depleted cells was not accompanied by increased total protein levels of snx27 , distinct from what we observed in fam21 - depleted cells ( fig. 5f ) .
the increase of snx27 protein level was suppressed by double knockdown ( fig. 5f ) , suggesting that the increase in snx27 is also caused by increased levels of pi ( 4 ) p. pi ( 4 ) p facilitates dissociation of retromer and its cargoes from the motor at the golgi by inhibiting the interaction between the p150glued of the dynein - dynactin complex and snx6 , a cargo adaptor of retromer34 .
indeed , we observed an enrichment of snx6 at the golgi in fam21 - depleted cells , suggesting that the release of the snx27 - retromer cargoes at the golgi is mediated by dissociation of snx6 from the motor via increased pi ( 4 ) p levels ( fig. 5i,j ) .
distinct function of fam21 from other wash components as fam21 is a core component of the wash complex , we examined whether other wash complex proteins also function in recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes .
however , cells depleted of the wash components strumpellin or wash1 did not accumulate glut1 and pi4kb at the golgi ( fig. 6a - d ) .
the possibility that wash complex members can function at different steps in the exocytosis pathway was recently raised in a study using dictyostelium37 .
in particular , this study demonstrated that all wash complex members except fam21 function to drive actin assembly on lysosomes , whereas fam21 functions to drive wash recycling back to lysosomes .
thus , we sought to investigate the distinct phenotypes induced by depletion of fam21 , strumpellin or wash1 in detail .
whereas wash1 and ccdc53 levels were decreased by all three knockdowns , as already demonstrated17 , levels of fam21 and strumpellin were not significantly altered by wash1 depletion ( fig. 6e ) , and a small amount of fam21 remained in strumpellin - depleted cells ( fig. 6e ) .
after strumpellin or wash1 depletion , residual fam21 was still visible at endosomes , although the fam21 - positive puncta were larger and fewer than in control cells ( fig. 6f ) .
these results demonstrate that fam21 still localizes to endosomes even in the absence of strumpellin or wash1 , suggesting that the residual fam21 might be functional in cargo recycling in these cells .
next , we examined whether snx27 is affected by depletion of other wash complex proteins .
as in the case of fam21 depletion , endosomal snx27 levels were also increased upon depletion of strumpellin or wash1 , with an increase in total protein levels ( fig. 6e,g ) .
thus , an increase in snx27 does not always result in glut1 and pi4kb accumulation at the golgi .
there are two possible explanations for the above phenotypic differences .
the first is that only fam21 functions in recycling .
if so , the increase of snx27 protein in wash1 - or strumpellin - depleted cells might be caused by a different mechanism than in fam21 - depleted cells .
we found that depletion of strumpellin or wash1 induced enlargement of endosomes , which were enriched with the other wash complex proteins and snx1 , a component of the retromer complex ( fig. 6f,h and supplementary fig. 7 ) .
the enlarged and collapsed endosomes seen in these cells were previously observed in wash - knockout fibroblasts38 .
in contrast , fam21 depletion did not increase endosome size , but it caused loss of wash complex proteins from the endosome ( fig. 6h and supplementary figs 4a - c and 7 ) .
thus , we cannot exclude the possibility that the increase of snx27 in strumpellin - or wash1 - depleted cells was caused by general expansion of the endosomal network .
a second possible explanation is that fam21 and the rest of the wash complex function together in recycling of snx27 - retromer cargoes .
in this scenario , fam21 might regulate pi4kb independently of the wash complex , but function in snx27 regulation in collaboration with the wash complex .
as the wash complex comprises a stable assembly , we favour the latter model .
altogether , we suggest that fam21 acts as a regulator of membrane protein recycling in conjunction with the snx27 - retromer complex .
discussion once internalized , membrane proteins are transported to one of three different intracellular compartments from endosomes to meet the needs of cells ( fig. 7 ) .
for snx27 - retromer cargoes , trafficking to lysosomes is blocked by the interaction of snx27 with retromer6 .
here we show that trafficking of cargoes to the golgi , another route , is blocked by the interaction of snx27 with fam21 .
the interaction limits snx27 to a specific endosomal subdomain , which is required for cargo export to the plasma membrane , its destination .
furthermore , fam21 controls pi ( 4 ) p levels at the golgi to prevent unscheduled dissociation of cargoes from the complex .
therefore , we suggest that the snx27 - retromer - wash complex acts as a hub to direct cargoes to the plasma membrane by blocking their transport to lysosomes and the golgi .
our results indicate that fam21 might have a distinct role from other wash components in recycling snx27 - retromer cargoes .
fam21 , strumpellin and swip are known to regulate the stability of the wash complex1722 .
here , we have shown that depletion of strumpellin or wash1 does not abolish other wash complex proteins from endosomes , whereas depletion of fam21 abolishes other proteins ( fig. 6f,h and supplementary fig. 7 ) .
our data indicate that fam21 is the most critical determinant of wash complex stability .
thus , we infer that residual fam21 remains functional in strumpellin - or wash1 - depleted cells , so that the accumulation of glut1 or pi4kb does not occur .
on the other hand , the intact wash complex appears required for localizing snx27 to a specific endosomal subdomain , as depletion of any wash complex protein results in an increase of snx27 at endosomes ( figs 4 and 6g ) .
even so , we cannot rule out the possibility that the increase of snx27 seen in strumpellin - or wash1 - depleted cells is caused by expansion of endosomes38 ( fig. 6f,h ) .
in sum , we suggest that the wash complex functions in limiting snx27 at the endosomal subdomain , and fam21 regulates levels of pi4kb at the golgi independent of the wash complex .
our suggestion is supported by a recent study showing that fam21 functions at a different step of exocytosis than other wash complex components37 .
also , there are different knockdown phenotypes among fam21 and other wash components in endosome size , golgi morphology and nuclear factor - kappab transcriptional activity223138 ( figs 5 and 6 and supplementary fig. 4 ) .
thus , growing evidence suggests that fam21 functions beyond the wash complex .
unexpectedly , we found that depletion of fam21 increases total protein levels of snx27 ( fig. 4c ) .
as its respective mrna levels were not changed in fam21 - depleted cells , the increase would not occur at a transcriptional level ( fig. 4d ) .
k63 - linked ubiquitination of wash1 by mage - l2 - trim27 , an e3 ring ubiquitin ligase , is known to regulate endosome - to - golgi and endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling39 .
this finding suggests that proteins which are involved in the endosome - to - plasma membrane recycling pathway could be regulated by ubiquitination .
the increase in snx27 levels was accompanied by increased immunofluorescence intensities at the golgi ( fig. 4 ) .
in the absence of pi4kb , both the increase in snx27 protein levels and the accumulation of glut1 , an snx27 cargo , were suppressed in fam21 - depleted cells ( fig. 5f - h ) .
the results suggest that the increase of protein levels is related to the glut1 mis - sorting defect mediated by pi ( 4 ) p. as fam21 is required for limiting snx27 at the specialized subdomain of endosomes to export its cargoes ( fig. 4 ) , snx27 would get trapped in endosomes and have prolonged lifetimes in fam21 - depleted cells .
we infer that it might result in the increase in snx27 levels observed in fam21 - depleted cells .
however , the mechanism underlying how fam21 regulates snx27 and pi4kb should be addressed further .
mutations in several genes implicated in endosomal sorting pathways are linked to inherited neurological disorders4041 .
vps35 , a subunit of retromer , is mutated in autosomal dominant , late - onset parkinson disease4243 .
mutations in wash components strumpellin or swip cause severe , pure , autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia or autosomal recessive intellectual disability , respectively44454647 .
it is believed that neurons are more vulnerable to endosomal trafficking defects as neuronal endosomes need to transport signalling molecules through far longer distances than other cell types48 .
our finding that the snx27 - retromer - wash complex mainly conducts the endosomal sorting pathway will likely clarify cellular mechanisms underlying these neurological disorders .

figure 7 model for roles of the snx27 - retromer - wash complex in cargo sorting .
after internalization , cargoes harbouring a pdz - binding motif such as beta2ar and glut1 bind to a pdz domain of snx27 .
snx27 serves as an adaptor linking its cargoes to the endosomal tubules through its interaction .
interaction of its pdz domain with vps26 of retromer prevents lysosomal entry of cargoes , whereas the interaction of its ferm domain with fam21 of the wash complex prevents its transport to the golgi apparatus .
therefore , these interactions within the snx27 - retromer - wash complex direct the cargoes towards recycling to the plasma membrane .
the wash complex , in particular , functions in localizing snx27 at a specialized endosomal subdomain .
in addition , fam21 controls pi4kb levels at the golgi , resulting in maintaining proper levels of pi ( 4 ) p at the golgi , which prevents dissociation of cargoes from the complex at the golgi .

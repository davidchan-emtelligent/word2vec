keywords malignant external otitis skull - base osteomyelitis arthrocentesis with lavage issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background malignant external otitis , though not a malignant tumor , is very invasive and difficult to resolve .
prior to the introduction of antibiotics , its mortality rate was 50 % [ 1 , 2 ] .
malignant external otitis begins as external , necrotizing soft - tissue infection that can gradually spread , in severe cases , to cartilage and the base of the skull , the facial nerve , the trigeminal nerve , the optic nerve , the paranasal sinuses , and the temporomandibular joint .
as clinical symptoms , earache , otorrhea , headache , and temporomandibular pain can be present ; in severe cases , even facial nerve paralysis can occur .
malignant external otitis always remains localized in soft tissue ; in cases where it spreads to the temporal bone or basal ganglia , it is known as skull - base osteomyelitis [ 3 ] .
skull - base osteomyelitis is a rare disease affecting the medulla of the temporal , sphenoid , and occipital bones .
in general , it occurs due to external ear canal infections caused by malignant external otitis that proceeds to skull base and becomes chronic ; however , atypical skull - base osteomyelitis that arises independently of any history of external otitis has been reported as well [ 3 ] .
skull - base osteomyelitis usually affects elderly diabetic patients .
diabetic patients have weak chemotaxis - or phagocytosis - functional cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes , monocytes , and macrophagocytes , and so are vulnerable to the bacteria causative of malignant external otitis [ 3 ] .
among such bacteria , pseudomonas aeruginosa is well known , though other strains also are detected ; all , generally , are considered to be simple colony forming rather than pathogenic bacteria .
eumycetes , for example , sometimes infect patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) [ 4 ] .
in the disease course , epidermis infection spreads to the dermis , causing an acute and chronic inflammatory reaction .
such infection spreads to the skull base , where it can be contracted to the infratemporal fossa , parotid gland , and cervical spine [ 5 ] .
generally this occurs unilaterally , but the spine can be infected by spreading of skull - base osteomyelitis to the opposite side .
this is a serious disease with high mortality and multiple cranial paralysis rates [ 6 ]. with respect to pain and dysfunction , skull - base osteomyelitis manifests similarly to the initial symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder .
thus , all too frequently , definitive diagnosis is delayed .
we herein report , together with a review of the relevant literature , a clinical case of a patient who had been admitted to hospital for otorrhea , which was differentially diagnosed by skull - base osteomyelitis and improved by arthrocentesis .
case presentation the patient , a 58 - year - old man , was referred for evaluation and management of the left jaw joint during hospitalization in the division of otolaryngology due to an outbreak of malignant external otitis on november 6 , 2012 .
he began treatment in otolaryngology mainly due to running ears .
however , since his condition did not improve , incision and drainage of the left jaw joint were performed after hospitalization .
later , as the patient 's condition threatened to deteriorate after pharmacological treatment at another ent hospital , he was sent to our tertiary care hospital for treatment .
his medical history included diabetes that had resulted in diabetic neuropathy .
clinical examination of the patient revealed pain in the left jaw and mouth - opening deflection to the left .
the maximum active mouth opening was measured to about 27 mm , which limitation was due to continuous pain .
tender points in the left temporalis muscle and left jaw joint were noted .
panoramic radiographs revealed bone resorption patterns in the left condyle ( fig. 1 ) .
ct scans and cone beam computed tomography ( cbct ) of the temporal bone showed the same patterns ( figs. 2 and 3 ) .
mri findings revealed the left temporomandibular joint to be surrounded by thickened soft tissue ( fig. 4 ) ; t2 - weighted imaging , meanwhile , showed effusion in the left mastoid air cell ( fig. 5 ) .
based on the thickening of the external auditory canal epithelium ( fig. 6a , b ) , contrast - media imaging of diffusion with increased patterns around the thickening region , as well as discharge in the mastoid process , the patient was provisionally diagnosed with malignant external otitis , mastoiditis , and arthritis of the left temporomandibular joint .
after treatment of the lesion by incision and drainage of the left jaw joint in the department of otorhinolaryngology , arthrocentesis and occlusal stabilization appliance therapy were carried out .
due to severe inflammation in the joint space , the arthrocentesis with lavage was performed twice .
according to the results of a culture of the bacteria in the external auditory canal , carried out prior to incision and drainage , pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected ; but according to the results of a bacterial culture implemented later , no bacteria were detected .
after the arthrocentesis with lavage , the extent of active mouth opening was increased to 40 mm , and pain in the left jaw joint was alleviated. fig. 1 panoramic radiographs of bone resorption patterns of left condyle fig. 2 ct scans showing same bone resorption patterns of left condyle fig. 3 cbct showing same bone resorption patterns of left condyle fig. 4 mri reveals left temporomandibular joint surrounded by thickened soft tissue fig. 5 t2 - weighted imaging showing effusion in left mastoid air cell fig. 6 a thickening of external auditory canal epithelium .
b 7 months later approximately 1 month after the first arthrocentesis with lavage was performed , an occlusal stabilization appliance was employed , which effectively eliminated the pain in the left temporomandibular joint .
the extent of active mouth opening was further increased , from 40 to 45 mm ( fig. 7 ) .
then , close observation with regular examination and pharmacological treatment with quinolones such as ciprofloxacin were performed in our otorhinolaryngology clinic .
panoramic and cbct images taken 1 year and 5 months after surgery confirmed that the bone resorption patterns in the left condyle had been significantly reduced ( figs. 8 and 9 ) .
now , the patient , still pain - free in the left temporomandibular joint , currently is undergoing implantation treatment ( fig. 10 ). fig. 7 extent of active mouth opening as increased to 45 mm fig. 8 panoramic images taken 1 year and 5 months after surgery , confirming significant reduction of bone resorption patterns in left condyle fig. 9 cbct showing significant reduction of bone resorption pattern in left condyle fig. 10 panoramic images taken 2 years after surgery , confirming significant reduction of bone resorption patterns in left condyle discussion skull - base osteomyelitis arises mainly through secondary infection of malignant external otitis .
although skull - base osteomyelitis and malignant external otitis are considered to be identical concepts in many studies , it is more appropriate to conceive of and think about skull - base osteomyelitis with basal bone involvement in pathophysiological terms [ 3 ] .
important skull - base osteomyelitis risk factors include immunosuppression , diabetes , chronic mastoiditis , sinusitis , malignant external otitis , infectious disease treated poorly with antibiotics , and decreased immunity due to the use of steroids or infection with human immunodeficiency virus [ 7 ] .
the most common disease associated with patients hospitalized due to skull - base osteomyelitis is diabetes [ 8 ] .
skull - base osteomyelitis most typically infects the diabetic elderly ; accordingly , infection caused by chronic external otitis occurs secondarily in connection with temporal bone [ 9 ] .
however , atypical skull - base osteomyelitis , which arises in the absence of any history of external otitis , has only rarely been reported [ 10 ] .
skull - base osteomyelitis is an often fatal disease , with mortality rates ranging from 28 to 60 % along with cranial nerve palsy in cases of delayed diagnosis and treatment [ 11 ] .
pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common ( 99.2 %) cause of skull - base osteomyelitis , whereas fungal skull - base osteomyelitis , caused by aspergilus and candida , is very rarely observed [ 12 ] .
the most important consideration in the treatment of malignant external otitis is the control of diabetes and its complications .
the excision of lesions is not generally recommended , though there is a need to remove locally inflamed tissues and bacteria .
generally , treatment is performed with antibiotic - mediated therapy using penicillin , ciprofloxacin and third - generation cephalosporin , which approach helps to reduce the mortality rate by 0 - 15 % [ 13 ] .
in cases where the middle cranial fossa and foramen magnum are contracted , aspergilus infection occurs , from which poor - prognosis facial paralysis arises [ 14 , 15 ] .
according to the literature , surgical removal of the temporomandibular joint remains controversial .
long - term antibiotic therapy might affect the same results , even without other surgical procedures , and non - invasive treatment such as arthrocentesis with lavage also is recommended [ 16 ] .
however , surgical treatment is recommended in cases where an abscess has formed in the joint space , or where extensive bone destruction of the glenoid and condyle is observed [ 17 ] .
as for typical cases , conservative treatment primarily is performed when malignant external otitis affects the temporomandibular joint .
however , in the present investigation , panoramic images showed cortical erosion of the upper mandibular condyle , and an mri revealed condylar locking , mouth - opening limitation , and inflammation within the joint space .
for this patient , arthrocentesis with lavage was performed .
conclusions this was a case wherein complications caused by failure to control diabetes induced skull - base osteomyelitis , which was accompanied by an infected jaw joint , ear pain , otorrhea resulting from external ear canal pathology on the affected side , and mouth - opening limitations. through control of diabetes , continued pharmacological treatment and arthrocentesis with lavage , we could achieve a rapid increase in the maximum mouth opening .
for future work , there is a need for continued discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of arthrocentesis with lavage for patients with skull - base osteomyelitis and other treatment options .

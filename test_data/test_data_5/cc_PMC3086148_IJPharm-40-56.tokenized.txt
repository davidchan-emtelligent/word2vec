069 effect of antituberculosis drug therapy on hepatic drug metabolizing enzyme cyp2c9 melvin g , shewade dg , saka vk , adithan c jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research , pondicherry , india .
aim : to study the effect of att ( anti tuberculosis therapy ) on induction of cyp2c9 in tuberculosis patients with polymorphic cyp2c9 gene .
materials and methods : 111 tuberculosis patients ( male - 67 , female - 44 ) were included in the study based on the exclusion - inclusion criteria .
before commencing att , they were given tab phenytoin 300 mg orally and a blood sample was collected after 3 hours .
genotyping for cyp2c9 gene was carried out using pcr - rflp ( polymerase chain reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism ) method to detect those with polymorphic gene .
phenotyping for cyp2c9 enzyme was done in 49 patients by measuring the ratio of phenytoin and its metabolite p - hpph ( para hydroxy phenyl hydantoin ) by reverse phase hplc ( high performance liquid chromatography ) method before and after one month of att results : the mean ratio of phenytoin / p - hpph before att in cyp2c9 * 1 * 1 , cyp2c9 * 1 * 2 and cyp2c9 * 1 * 3 group were 36.45 +/ - 14.01 , 37.81 +/ - 19.09 , 44.72 +/ - 16 , 71 and after one month of att were 9.81 +/ - 1.85 , 21.21 +/ - 12.00 and 11.99 +/ - 4.94 respectively .
in cyp2c9 * 1 * 1 there was significant reduction in phenytoin metabolic ratio ( p < 0.05 ) by paired t test .
conclusion : att has been shown to cause enzyme induction of cyp2c9 in tb patients .
however statistically significant induction was found only in cyp2c9 * 1 * 1 and not in the heteromutant cyp2c9 genotype .
thus the genotype of the individual plays an important role in the degree of induction by antituberculosis treatment .
070 newer mechanistic pathways pertaining to antidepressant action of escitalopram using acute and chronic animal models of depression and underlying immunological basis of depression soni s , shah a , agarwal r , pandey d , mahesh r birla institute of technology and science , pilani , rajasthan , india .
escitalopram ( esc ) , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( ssri ) , is an established antidepressant and anxiolytic .
it increases extracellular serotonin in the brain by blocking the serotonin ( 5 - ht ) transporter ( sert ) .
the present study was designed to explore the various mechanistic pathways of escitalopram using various acute and chronic models of depression and showing the immunological basis of depression .
acute treatment of esc ( 5 , 10 and 20 mg / kg / 10ml , i.p ) was given to mice and were subjected to forced swim test ( fst ) , tail suspension test ( tst ) , reversal of reserpine ( 1mg / kg ) induced hypothermia , elevated plus maze , open field test , social interaction test etc .
interaction studies with 5 - ht2 agonist ( metachlorophenylpiperazine , mcpp ) and 5 - ht2 antagonist ( ketanserin ) were conducted .
the chronic ( 14 days ) effect of esc was examined in olfactory bulbectomized ( obx ) rats treated with mcpp ( 1mg / kg ) .
macrophage hypothesis of depression was evaluated by differential leucocyte cell ( dlc ) count and taking the weight of spleen and thymus in obx rats after 14 days of esc treatment .
mcpp induced immobility was decreased by esc and ketanserin was found to potentiate the effect of esc in fst .
chronic treatment with esc significantly reversed the post obx behavior in mcpp treated rats .
none of the tested dose of esc altered the locomotor activity when administered alone , which showed blockade of pharmacological actions of mcpp .
chronic treatment with esc normalized the dlc count and spleen and thymus weight in obx rats .
in conclusion , distinct 5 - ht receptor targets for esc were found in addition to immunological basis of depression .
071 intra - and inter - ethnic variations in gstp1 dhawan d , padh h b. v. patel perd centre , ahmedabad , india .
glutathione - s - transferases ( gsts ) are crucial for cell defence system .
these phase ii enzymes are involved in the detoxification of a variety of chemotherapeutics including platinum through conjugation to glutathione .
gstp1 , located on chromosome 11q13 , is a part of the different isoenzymes of cytosolic gsts .
the gstp1 isoform has been detected at high levels within the gastrointestinal tract .
cancer patients with higher levels of gstp1 are shown to have less sensitivity to platinum agents .
a313g snp in exon 5 of gstp1 leads to ile105val , resulting in reduced enzyme activity and therefore efficacy and / or toxicity to platinum based drugs .
since allelic and genotypic variations have been observed in different populations and ethnic groups in various parts of the world , this study aimed to establish the prevalence of gstp1 ( ile / val ) genotypes in indian population and compare it with other populations .
genotyping was performed using allele - specific pcr in 137 healthy indian individuals .
the genotypic distribution of gstp1 ( ile / val ) were ile / ile - 45.2 % , ile / val - 43.1 % and val / val - 11.7 % , whereas the allelic frequencies were 0.667 for ile and 0.333 for val allele .
there was a significant variation in the observed genotypic frequencies as compared to north indians ( p <= 0.05 ) and chinese ( p <= 0.01 ) .
thus , our results signify an impact of ethnicity and provide a basis for future epidemiological and clinical studies .
072 targeted medicines : are we there yet ?
dehar n1 , arora p1 , gupta a2 1m.m. institute of medical sciences and research , ambala , 2government medical college , patiala , india .
we are at the beginning point of the use of targeted medicines and personalized medicines .
the recent inclusion of pharmacogenomics into the drug development attests to this process .
there is an urgent need to change the current drug development model .
as stated in the fda critical path document , the productivity and innovation have declined over the past 10yrs ; 45 % decrease in advances in science not yielding many nmes since 1996 - 97 .
one of the limitations of the current drug development process is that it is skewed to a large group of patients and not to the individual patient .
so there is a need to have a different type of drug development model that is synergistic to the current model and will focus upon potential responders and nonresponders .
the key is to identify those subsets of patients who react differently than the majority of the population , in relation to response or the adverse effects .
so thinking about pharmacogenomics as a tool to target and identify the baseline genomic profiles , the drug development process has an opportunity to enable us to achieve that .
the major drivers pushing us towards targeted medicines are : short comings of the current drug development process , rapid advances in molecular biology and disease pathophysiology , changes in regulatory expectations - heightened focus on individual benefit and risk .
fda is working to advance its capabilities and interpret genomic data .
the major challenge is the general lack of the familiarity with pharmacogenomics data because the science is so new and is constantly evolving in new ways .
" incorporating pharmacogenomics into prescribing will represent a major change for health care community "

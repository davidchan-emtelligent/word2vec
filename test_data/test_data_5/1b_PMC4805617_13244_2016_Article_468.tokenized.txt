keywords mri spine lumbar vertebrae incidence issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 introduction transitional lumbosacral vertebrae are a common finding on spinal imaging , with reported incidences of 1 - 30 % , depending on the definition and imaging modality used [ 1 - 8 ] .
these spinal variants are generally easier to appreciate on radiographs or ct than on magnet resonance imaging ( mri ) [ 1 , 8 ] .
various landmarks have been proposed to identify the anatomical level of the transitional vertebra on mr imaging .
for example , various vascular structures and the location of the iliolumbar ligament have been investigated for this purpose .
ultimately , however , all these landmarks have been shown to be unreliable [ 1 , 9 , 10 ] .
a more insidious problem is the case of morphologically normal lumbar vertebrae but an abnormal number of mobile vertebrae of the spine .
counting from the top of the spine , there might be an increased or decreased number of morphologically normal mobile vertebrae .
this may be impossible to appreciate on mr imaging of the lumbar spine alone .
however , it is important to realise the presence of a numerical variant , as this will result in variation in neural anatomy and may lead to misattribution of clinical symptoms , i.e. clinical findings or symptoms related to an incorrect spinal level , which may lead to inappropriate intervention .
several authors have suggested that the only reliable method for determining the anatomical level is to count down from the atlantoaxial joint .
obviously , this requires imaging of the entire spine [ 2 , 5 , 11 ] .
anecdotally , there is a lack of awareness amongst radiologists regarding anatomical variation , particularly with regard to the frequency of numerical variants of the spine in the absence of morphological transitional vertebrae .
this paper sets out to determine the incidence of numerical variants and transitional lumbosacral vertebrae of the spine in consecutive patients in routine mr imaging practice .
materials and methods from 1 january 2013 to 30 april 2015 , all mris of the whole spine presented to the main author were prospectively assessed for the presence of numerical variants of the spine and the presence of a morphological transitional lumbosacral vertebra .
the vertebrae were counted from the c2 vertebra downwards , assuming seven cervical and 12 thoracic vertebrae .
although variation in the number of cervical and thoracic vertebrae has been described , variation in the cervical spine is very uncommon [ 12 ] .
in the thoracic spine , it can be difficult to determine the anatomical nature of vertebrae at the thoracolumbar junction .
the generally accepted convention is to attribute seven vertebrae to the cervical and 12 vertebrae to the thoracic spine [ 10 , 11 , 13 ] .
in this study , vertebrae were considered transitional based on the criteria described by o'driscoll et al .
[ 8 ] .
the vertebra must show some features of both a lumbar and sacral vertebra : " a well - formed residual disc between s1 and the remainder of the sacrum but also with an abnormal sagittal outline to the sacrum , i.e. " squaring " of the presumed upper sacral segment " [ 8 ] .
the spine was assessed solely on the basis of the mri appearances and not in conjunction with other imaging modalities .
in the case of transitional lumbosacral vertebrae , their nature was determined by counting down from the top , assuming seven cervical and 12 thoracic vertebrae ( please see above ) .
in the case of the transitional vertebra , it was called sacralised l5 if it followed after l4 , and it was called lumbarised s1 if it followed after l5 .
the routine mri protocol consisted of sagittal t1 - weighted ( t1w ) , sagittal short tau inversion recovery ( stir ) and sagittally acquired 3d space [ sampling perfection with application - optimised contrasts using different flip - angle evolution ] sequences .
the 3d space sequences were reformatted in the axial and coronal planes .
in select cases , additional sequences were performed .
the sagittal images were acquired in two blocks of 38 cm craniocaudal size .
for the assessment of the number of vertebrae , the composed view was reviewed using the image composer of the mri scanner ( syngo mr b17 ; siemens healthcare gmbh , erlangen , germany ) .
all examinations were performed on a magnetom avanto 1.5t mri scanner ( siemens healthcare gmbh ) .
all mris of the whole spine were analysed , regardless of the clinical indication for the examination .
results from 1 january 2013 to 30 april 2015 , mris of the whole spine in 420 patients ( 211 female and 209 male ) were performed and reviewed by the main author .
transitional lumbosacral vertebrae affecting either l5 or s1 were seen in 12 patients ; in eight , l5 was partially sacralised ( fig. 1 ) , and in four , s1 was partially lumbarised ( fig. 2 ) .
among the eight patients with partial sacralisation of l5 , three were male and five were female .
the group of four with partial lumbarisation of s1 comprised three male and one female patient. fig. 1 26 - year - old woman with thoracic pain .
mri of the spine with sagittal t1 - weighted images ( a ) and a coronal reformat of a sagittal space sequence ( b ) demonstrates a transitional lumbosacral vertebra .
counting from the top , this is a sacralised l5 vertebra .
the coronal reformats are very helpful in identifying the transitional nature of this vertebra .
it is more easily appreciated on an anterior - posterior ( ap ) radiograph of the lumbar spine ( c ) fig. 2 15 - year - old boy with back pain .
sagittal t1 - weighted image ( a ) and coronal reformats of a sagittal space sequence ( b ) demonstrate a transitional lumbosacral vertebra .
counting from the top , this is a lumbarised s1 vertebra .
this can also be identified on an anterior - posterior ( ap ) radiograph ( c ) of the whole spine , better appreciated on a magnified view of the lumbar spine only ( d ) .
the only reliable method for determining the nature of a transitional vertebra is to count from the top in 32 patients , the lumbosacral junction appeared morphologically normal on mri but the number of vertebrae was abnormal , increasing by one in 18 patients ( fig. 3 ) and decreasing by one in 14 patients ( fig. 4 ) .
among the 18 patients with an increased number of mobile vertebrae , 12 were male and six were female .
among patients with a decreased number of mobile vertebrae , four were male and ten were female. fig. 3 55 - year - old man with spinal injury in the past .
sagittal t1 - weighted images ( a ) and coronal reformats of a 3d space sequence ( b ) demonstrate old injuries , fusion of cervical vertebrae c4 to c6 ( most easily appreciated when counting the posterior elements ) , and one supernumerary vertebra .
additional mobile vertebrae are more common in men than in women fig. 4 sagittal t1 - weighted mri of the whole spine in a 63 - year - old female patient with back pain .
block vertebra formation c3 / 4 .
the number of mobile vertebrae is reduced by one .
assuming seven cervical and 12 thoracic vertebrae , there are four morphological lumbar vertebrae , and there is no transitional vertebra as such combining the number of patients with a reduced number of mobile vertebrae and with sacralisation of l5 results in a total of 22 patients , seven male and 15 female .
combining the number of patients with an increased number of mobile vertebrae and with lumbarisation of s1 results in a total of 22 patients , 15 male and seven female .
this equates roughly to a ratio of 1 / 3 to 2 / 3 .
in a further two patients ( one male and one female ) , the number of free spinal vertebrae was increased by one , and there was also a transitional lumbosacral vertebra .
therefore , there were altogether 14 patients with transitional lumbosacral vertebrae .
in a further two patients ( one male and one female ) , two balanced hemivertebrae were noted in the thoracic spine .
these were in addition to a normal complement of mobile vertebrae , and might be seen as one additional vertebra .
however , these two cases will be excluded from the further analysis , as the numbering of vertebrae is not straightforward , nor is it universally agreed upon in these circumstances .
also , the assumption of 12 thoracic vertebrae is no longer valid in these cases .
this results in an incidence of an increased or decreased number of vertebrae of 34 / 418 , or 8.1 % .
in 32 of 418 patients , or 7.7 % of cases , there was no morphological anomaly at the lumbosacral junction despite an anomalous number of mobile vertebrae .
as mentioned earlier , in two cases there were transitional lumbosacral vertebrae in addition to an increased number of mobile vertebrae .
transitional lumbosacral vertebrae were seen in 14 of 418 or 3.3 % of patients .
there were four patients with known developmental anomalies .
one was known to have goldenhar syndrome , and this patient had one more mobile vertebra than normal and an additional transitional vertebra .
one patient with known langer - giedion syndrome had one more mobile vertebra than normal .
a patient with known klippel - feil syndrome and a patient with arnold - chiari malformation had a normal number of vertebrae .
the indications for the mri examinations were quite varied , and included pain with suspected spinal origin , neurological symptoms with suspected spinal origin , inflammatory or infectious lesions of the spine , assessment of neoplastic disease of the spine , osteoporosis , spinal injury follow - up , and abnormal posture and alignment , including scoliosis .
discussion the most striking finding of this study is the low number of morphological transitional lumbosacral vertebrae in the study population .
only 3.3 % of our patients demonstrated a transitional lumbosacral vertebra on mri , using the criteria described by o'driscoll et al .
[ 8 ] .
this is much lower than generally quoted in the literature .
only one study has noted a lower rate , at about 1 % [ 2 ] , whereas many other studies have quoted the incidence of transitional lumbosacral vertebra in double digits , e.g. 10 % [ 7 ] , 12 % [ 11 ] , 15 % [ 8 ] , 16 % [ 3 ] , 18.6 % [ 1 ] , and even up to 30 % [ 4 ] .
the presence of a transitional lumbosacral vertebra does alert to the presence of anatomical variants in the neural anatomy and should trigger extra care when undertaking interventional procedures .
anatomical variants without transitional morphology are more problematic because they can easily be missed .
they were much more prevalent than morphologically transitional vertebrae in our study population , which showed a rate of 7.7 % .
these patients will typically not be identified as having a numerical variant when only mr imaging of the lumbar spine is performed .
numerical variants of mobile vertebrae are associated with variation in the neural anatomy and can lead to inappropriate spinal intervention [ 3 , 7 , 14 ] .
in men , there is a clear tendency toward an increased number of mobile vertebrae , either as true mobile vertebra or lumbarisation of a sacral vertebra , with a male - to - female ratio of 2:1 .
the reverse is true in the case of a decreased number of mobile vertebrae or sacralisation of a lumbar vertebra , with a male - to - female ratio of roughly 1:2 .
the absolute combined numbers of increased or decreased mobile vertebra + transitional vertebra were very similar .
however , for lumbarisation , there is a tendency to be complete - - i.e. not transitional but fully mobile - - while the opposite is true for sacralisation .
this study is the first to prospectively evaluate the presence of transitional lumbosacral vertebrae and or numerical variants on whole - spine mri .
hahn et al .
[ 11 ] used a combination of scout views and mri of the lumbar spine to look at transitional lumbosacral vertebrae , but did not differentiate between vertebrae with transitional morphology and numerical variants .
the combined incidence in their study was 12 % , with a male predominance for lumbarisation of s1 , similar to our study .
hanson and coworkers [ 5 ] reviewed whole - spine mri in 750 consecutive outpatients for the presence of numerical variants .
similar to hahn et al. , they did not separate vertebrae with transitional morphology from numerical variants .
assuming seven cervical and 12 thoracic vertebrae , they found a 20 % incidence of numerical variation , with 14.5 % of all patients having six lumbar vertebrae , 5.3 % having four , and one patient ( 0.13 %) having three .
eighty percent of patients in their study had five lumbar vertebrae .
interestingly , two - thirds of the patients with four lumbar vertebrae were female , while two - thirds of patients with six lumbar vertebrae were male , a trend also borne out in our study .
akbar et al .
[ 2 ] used a whole - spine localiser to assess numerical variants of the lumbosacral junction .
they found overall incidence of 7.7 % , with only two of 207 patients ( about 1 %) having transitional lumbosacral morphology on scout imaging .
therefore , the incidence of numerical variation in mobile vertebrae and the presence of transitional vertebrae in their study was even lower than in ours .
however , this may have been due to limited quality of the scout images .
coronal reformats of the 3d space sequence were useful in identifying transitional vertebrae , as has been described elsewhere [ 15 ] .
intra - and interobserver variation was not assessed in this work .
it stands to reason that there is some variability in the assessment of transitional vertebrae .
while coronal reformats can provide some help , they are not always available , and radiographs remain the gold standard .
the fundamental problem that remains , however , is that numerical variants are relatively common and cannot be appreciated unless whole - spine imaging is performed .
in our institution , the imaging protocol of mri of the lumbar spine was modified in light of these findings .
all patients now undergo imaging using a sagittal half - fourier acquisition single - shot turbo spin - echo ( haste ) localiser of the spine in two sagittal blocks , which allows imaging of the whole spine in about 30 s , ensuring adequate determination of anatomical levels in all examinations .
conclusion numerical variants of the spine are common , and were almost 2.5 times as frequent as transitional lumbosacral vertebrae in the study population .
while mri of the lumbar spine can usually identify transitional lumbosacral vertebrae ( though not as reliably as radiographs ) , it cannot identify numerical variants of the spine , which is possible only by imaging of the whole spine .
in men , the tendency is toward an increased number of mobile vertebrae , whereas the number tends to decrease in women .
an accurate determination of anatomical levels is a prerequisite for accurate assessment of pathological findings and for any image - guided spinal intervention .

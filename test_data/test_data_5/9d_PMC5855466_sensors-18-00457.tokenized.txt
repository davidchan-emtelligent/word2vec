in this study , we describe a novel peroxidase - like activity of co - aminoclay [ coac ] present at ph ~ 5.0 and its application to fluorescent biosensor for the determination of h2o2 and glucose .
it is synthesized with aminoclays ( acs ) entrapping cationic metals such as fe , cu , al , co. , ce , ni , mn , and zn to find enzyme mimicking acs by sol - gel ambient conditions. through the screening of catalytic activities by the typical colorimetric reaction employing 2,2 ' - azino - bis ( 3 - ethylbenzo - thiazoline - 6 - sulfonic acid ) diammonium salt ( abts ) as a substrate with or without h2o2 , fe , cu , and coacs are found to exhibit peroxidase - like activity , as well as oxidase - like activity was observed from ce and mnacs .
among them , coac shows exceptionally high peroxidase - like activity , presumably due to its ability to induce electron transfer between substrates and h2o2 .
coac is then used to catalyze the oxidation of amplex ( r ) ultrared ( aur ) into a fluorescent end product , which enables a sensitive fluorescent detection of h2o2 .
moreover , a highly sensitive and selective glucose biosensing strategy is developed , based on enzyme cascade reaction between glucose oxidase ( gox ) and coac .
using this strategy , a highly linear fluorescence enhancement is verified when the concentration of glucose is increased in a wide range from 10 mum to 1 mm with a lower detection limit of 5 mum .
the practical diagnostic capability of the assay system is also verified by its use to detect glucose in human blood serum .
based on these results , it is anticipated that coac can serve as potent peroxidase mimetics for the detection of clinically important target molecules .
co - aminoclay [ coac ] peroxidase mimetic fluorescent biosensor colorimetric sensor glucose detection 1 .
introduction over and beyond the various organic [ 1 ] and inorganic [ 2 ] nanoparticles ( nps ) , many hybrid organic - inorganic [ 3 ] nps have been extensively researched in biomedical , environmental , and energy applications for their size , shape , charge , and surface chemistry including diverse functionalities .
specific organic - functional groups in many hybrid nps offer usually unique properties in terms of the accessibility and bioactivity of targeting cells or biomolecules in bionanotechnology without some post - functionalization in nanotechnology [ 4,5 ] .
one candidate of organic - inorganic nps with covalent - bonded primary amines , namely 3 - aminopropyl - functionalized magnesium phyllosilicate ( i.e. , mg - aminoclay [ mgac ] , formulated as [ h2n ( ch2 ) 3 ] 8si8mg6o12 ( oh ) 4 ) was developed by one - pot sol - gel reaction under ambient conditions by mann et al .
[ 6,7 ] showing unique interactions of organic - pendants with cell or other molecules [ 8,9 ] in biomedical fields , as well as with heavy metals [ 10 ] in environmental applications .
this aminoclay structure is composed of tetrahedral brucite ( mgo ) in the middle , sandwiched by octahedral silica ( sio2 ) as the unit structure in the vertical direction ( i.e. , 2:1 trioctahedral clay ) and a repeated tetrahedral / octahedral structure in pairs , known as the 1:1 dioctahedral structure .
diverse high - density primary amines ( - ( ch2 ) 3nh2 ) in octahedral structures have been coined aminoclays ( acs ) [ 11 ] according to the cationic metals used in their preparation [ 12,13 ] .
recently , the organo - building blocks of mg and caacs were tested for possible use as drug - delivery carriers , and were found to result in neither cytotoxicity nor inflammation [ 14 ] .
further , the protonated clusters of mgac with positively charged zeta potential in the wide ph range of 2.0 - 12.0 were previously reported [ 15 ] as well as cy 5.0 conjugation with organo - building blocks in delaminated mgac was investigated for the biodistribution and elimination pathways in in vivo mice [ 16 ] .
the results showed fast elimination or excretion of mgac in mice after oral or intravenous injection , respectively , without toxicity. with the exceptions of transparent mg and caacs in aqueous solutions , other colored aminoclays have not been tested for cytotoxicity to determine the feasibility of their use in biomedical applications .
importantly , the lack of or weak fluorescent - emission intensity of aminoclays has driven research to explore fluorescent imaging for promising drug - delivery - carrier and simultaneous bioimaging applications in diagnostics and therapeutics .
recently , many kinds of nanostructures have been investigated as enzyme mimetics , which have intrinsic enzyme - like activities .
their catalytic activities were generally recognized in the cationic metal positions , which consist of the acs frameworks .
among them , feac , which was reported by our group , have gathered intense attention as peroxidase mimetics due to their unique advantageous features such as high peroxidase - like activity , facile synthesis and surface - functionalization , high dispersity in aqueous buffer solution , and stability [ 17 ] .
they have been successfully utilized to colorimetrically detect lung cancer cells after conjugation with folic acid .
the promising application results have prompted us to investigate other types of aminoclays using other cationic metals , which presumably show oxidoreductase activity .
herein , we synthesized aminoclays containing diverse cationic metals such as fe , cu , al , co. , ce , ni , mn , and zn to find new enzyme mimicking acs. through the screening of catalytic activity by the typical colorimetric reaction , we found that coac has significantly high peroxidase - like activity and applied them to develop fluorescent biosensor for the sensitive determination of h2o2 and glucose concentrations .
analytical features of the new detection system such as selectivity , sensitivity , and precision were also investigated .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
preparation of eight types of aminoclays according to the literature , eight types of acs were synthesized , based on magnesium - aminoclay [ 18 ] .
briefly , respective 8.4 g of fecl3 * 6h2o [ 17 ] , cucl2 * 2h2o [ 19 ] , alcl3 * 7h2o [ 20 ] , cocl2 * 6h2o [ 21 ] , cecl3 * 7h2o [ 22 ] , nicl2 * 6h2o [ 23 ] , mncl2 * 4h2o [ 19 ] , and zncl2 [ 24 ] , ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) , were utilized to dissolve in a 500 - ml glass beaker containing 200 ml ethanol solution for 10 min magnetic stirring .
in case of exceptional anhydrous zncl2 , 1 ml of double distilled water was added to induce hydrolysis of the organosilane layer .
thirteen ml of 3 - aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( apts , sigma - aldrich , usa ) was subsequently added drop - wise into prepared solution .
after 5 min mixing , a slurry was immediately produced .
for a further 12 h reaction in production , as - prepared acs were centrifuged at 6000x g for 10 min .
the harvested acs were dried at 60 degreesc for 24 h in an oven and powdered by pestle and mortar before characterization and investigated their potential as glucose biosensor .
2.2 .
characterizations of as - prepared aminoclays for visual observation of ac dispersed in double distilled water ( 2.5 mg / ml ) by 5 min bath sonication , field emission transmission electron microscopy ( fe - tem , tecnai f20 , philips , amsterdam , the netherlands ) microphotographs [ 16 ] .
in order to confirm the crystalline structure or not in as - prepared acs or impurities , power x - ray diffraction ( xrd , d / max - 2500 , rigaku , 40 kv and 300 ma ) patterns were examined , focusing on ranging from 3 to 70degrees with increment in 0.01. with ft - ir spectrophotometer ( ft - ir 4100 , jasco , tokyo , japan ) [ 25 ] , it was determined organic functional groups in aminoclays , after preparation of sample in which it was consisted of 90 wt % kbr and 10 wt % respective ac by a pellet mode [ 16 ] .
2.3 .
screening of catalytic activities of as - prepared aminoclays peroxidase or oxidase - like activities of as - prepared acs were screened by performing the representative catalytic oxidation of the colorimetric substrate , abts , with or without h2o2 , respectively .
in a typical screening for peroxidase - like activity , a solution containing 50 mul of abts ( 50 mm ) , 50 mul of aminoclays ( 2 mg / ml ) , and 50 mul of h2o2 ( 100 mm ) in 350 mul of tris - acetate buffer ( 0.1 m at various phs ) was incubated for 5 min at room temperature .
after the reaction , the acs was removed from the reaction solution by centrifugation at 10,000x g for 3 min and the supernatant was used to obtain images representing the progress of the reaction .
the absorbance intensity of the solution was also measured after 5 times dilution of the reaction solution .
spectrophotometric measurements were carried out in a scanning mode or at 417 nm using a microplate reader ( synergy h1 , biotek , winooski , vt , usa ) .
2.4 .
fluorometric detection for h2o2 using co - aminoclay the detection of h2o2 concentration was performed in a black 96 - well plate as follows : a reaction buffer solution ( 140 mul , 0.1 m tris - acetate , ph 8 ) containing coac ( 20 mul , 0.1 mg / ml ) , aur ( 20 mul , 500 nm ) , and h2o2 at various concentrations were incubated at rt for 5 min .
after the reaction , the coac was separated from the mixture by centrifugation at 10,000x g for 3 min , and the supernatant were further analyzed by measuring the fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelength of 530 nm and 580 nm or in a scanning mode , respectively , using a microplate reader ( synergy h1 , biotek , winooski , vt , usa ) .
the fluorescent images after the reaction were also obtained by utilizing a fluorescence image analyzer ( image station 4000mm pro , kodak , stamford , ct , usa ) .
2.5 .
fluorescent determination of glucose using co - aminoclay and glucose oxidase the determination of glucose concentration was performed in a black 96 - well plate as follows : a pbs buffer solution ( 10 mm , ph 7.4 ) containing gox ( 10 mul , 10 mg / ml ) and glucose at different concentrations ( 40 mul , 10 mum - 20 mm ) was incubated at 37 degreesc for 20 min .
subsequently , another reaction buffer ( 110 mul , 0.1 m tris - acetate , ph 8 ) containing coac ( 20 mul , 0.1 mg / ml ) and aur ( 20 mul , 500 nm ) were added into each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 min .
after the reaction , the coac was separated and other detection procedures were the same as previously described .
for selectivity test , other carbohydrates such as maltose , fructose , lactose , and sucrose were used instead of glucose .
2.6 .
glucose detection in human serum initial glucose concentration in human serum was first determined by glucose assay kit ( sigma - aldrich ) and then a predetermined amount of glucose was further added into human serum to make spiked samples , which represented normal , boundary , and high level of blood glucose .
finally , glucose concentration of each spiked sample ( 40 mul , 50 - fold dilution ) was determined by the same procedures described above .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
tem observation of eight types of aminoclays for eight types of acs , it showed water - soluble or water - dispersible ac nps by delaminated clay sheets , which is associated with protonated amine ( - nh3 +) formation with a high density .
figure 1 represented transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images of eight types of acs .
as previously reported microphotographs [ 10 ] , acs shows the diameter sizes ranging from 20 nm - 200 nm , with a similar morphology like sheet - like and layered structures with different contrast , according to stacking clay sheet layers [ 18 ] .
the distribution size of acs is displayed in figure s1 .
the polydispersity index ( pdi ) of acs is ranging from 0.213 - 0.444 ( table s1 ) .
it is matched with water - soluble or water - dispersible properties as mentioned above .
additionally , at the high magnification images , it is rarely observed lattice fringe , indicating amorphous ( partially crystalline ) structures , exception of cuac and mnac .
inset in figure 1a showed a side view of ideal unit structure of ac where a pink - colored octahedral sheet containing respective cationic metals with sandwiched tetrahedral silica sheets in sky - blue color as well as green - colored pendents are - nh2 functionalities .
the chemical formula of ac may be supplanted with a replacement of cationic metal , based on the reported result of mgac , i.e. , [ h2n ( ch2 ) 3 ] 8si8mg6o12 ( oh ) 4 [ 7 ]. from a focus ion - beam scanning electron microscope ( fib - sem ) ( figure s2 ) and scanning electron microscope ( sem ) ( figure s3 ) , coac and mnac exhibited aggregated form , but in a larger and more dense structure compared with other acs , with more porosity .
the difference in this observation may lead to the difference in accessibility .
3.2 .
xrd patterns and ft - ir spectra of eight types of aminoclays for identification and to check for the crystalline / amorphous phases in materials , the powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns of aminoclays were examined ( figure 2 ) .
the regular distance in the at d001 was calculated to ~ 14.0 a at 2theta = 6.0degrees in feac , and in the broad peaks at in - plane reflection , the distances were ~ 7.8 , ~ 3.9 , and ~ 2.8 a at 2theta = 11.3 , 22.7 , and 32.3degrees , respectively without distinct peak at ~ 2theta = 59degrees ( figure 2a ) , finding that it is matched with 2:1 dioctahedral phyllosilicate , corresponding to previous data [ 26 ] .
similarly , both alac and ceac showed 2:1 dioctahedral phyllosilicate structure ( figure 2e,g ) .
however , alac represented the peak of d130,200 was very weak intensity while ceac displayed that of d130,200 was shifted to smaller angle at ~ 2theta = 30degrees .
particularly , xrd patterns of cuac and mnac showed similar sharp peaks , in line with previous data , respectively ( figure 2b,h ) .
on the other hands , both coac and niac exhibited typical 2:1 trioctahedral phyllosilicate structures ( figure 2c,f ) [ 21,23 ] .
interestingly , it was found that additional peaks at 2theta = 3.55degrees and 4.14degrees with mesolar - structured 24.87 a and 21.33 a in coac and niac respectively .
in case of znac ( figure 2d ) , it presented similar feac or alac structure in general and specifically showed sharp peaks , looking as those of cuac or mnac [ 19 ] .
the covalent bindings in organofunctional groups in aminoclays were recorded with the fourier transform infrared ( ft - ir ) spectra ( figure 3 ) .
in general , the ft - ir spectra peaks were assigned as follows : - oh ( 3300 cm - 1 ) , - chx ( 2920 cm - 1 ) , - nh3 + ( 2020 cm - 1 ) , - nh2 ( 1609 cm - 1 ) , - ch2 ( 1487 cm - 1 ) , si - c ( 1120 cm - 1 ) , si - oh ( 1034 cm - 1 ) , si - o - si ( 1014 cm - 1 ) , si - o - c ( 770 cm - 1 ) , c - n ( 680 cm - 1 ) , metal - o - si (~ 650 cm - 1 ) , and metal - o (< 600 cm - 1 ) , indicating that organic pendants in inorganic framework are successfully covalented onto each metal species [ 20 ] .
3.3 .
screening of peroxidase or oxidase - like activity of diverse aminoclays to find novel peroxidase or oxidase mimetics among the synthesized cationic metal - containing acs , the aminoclays along with feac , which was already proven to be peroxidase mimetics by our group [ 17 ] , were examined for their peroxidase or oxidase - like activities to promote the oxidation of abts in the presence or absence of h2o2. through the typical reactions performed in a range of phs , fe , cu , and coacs showed peroxidase - like activity , which catalyzed the oxidation of abts only in the presence of h2o2 .
at the same time , ce and mnacs showed oxidase - like activity catalyzing the oxidation of abts even without h2o2 ( figure 4 ) .
there were no significant color change or absorbance enhancement from al , ni , and znacs .
among the enzyme mimicking acs , coac exhibited a significant amount of catalytic activity at around ph 5 , which make them highly applicable in diverse peroxidase - mediated applications .
it is presumed that the catalytic activity of coac may have arisen from the capability of electron transfer of cobalt ions between substrates and h2o2 to produce hydroxyl radicals , which are directly involved in the oxidation of employed substrate , abts [ 27 ] .
we also confirmed that there is negligible activity with the aqueous solutions containing co. ions ( 10 % , 20 % , and 30 % compared to the concentrations of coac ( figure s4 ) , indicating that free co. ions cannot catalyze the oxidation of abts ( figure s5 ) .
coac was also very stable at various ph conditions , making its incubation suitable at various ph environments ( figure s6 ) .
3.4 .
investigation for peroxidase - like activity of co - aminoclay for the determination of h2o2 since the peroxidase - like activity of coac to oxidize employed substrate is promoted by h2o2 , the acs were then employed to detect h2o2 dissolved in sample solution .
to achieve higher sensitivity , another peroxidase - mediated substrate , aur , which is also widely used for the peroxidase - mediated reaction at around neutral ph condition , was employed in this assay system [ 28 ]. through the typical reaction condition described in experimental section , fluorescence intensity by the oxidation of aur was specifically observed with both coac and h2o2 while other control cases exhibited negligible fluorescence intensities , indicating that coac displayed high peroxidase activity with aur as a substrate ( figure 5a ) .
the fluorescence intensity upon oxidation of aur sharply increased with increasing h2o2 concentrations up to approximately 10 mm ( figure 5b ) .
as shown in the inset of figure 5b , a linear relationship ( r2 = 0.99 ) between fluorescence intensity and h2o2 concentration in a range of 10 mum to 1 mm with a low detection limit of 1 mum was obtained , which indicates that coac - based system could be practically used in analytical field for the detection of h2o2 .
this level of sensitivity is sufficient to enable coupling of coac with any oxidase to create a versatile fluorescent sensor [ 29 ] .
3.5 .
analytical capabilities of co - aminoclay for the detection of glucose the feasibility of the glucose biosensor was demonstrated by coupling glucose oxidase ( gox ) with coac .
in the presence of target glucose , gox catalyzed the oxidation of glucose to generate h2o2 , which should activate coac to convert aur into highly fluorescent product. through the typical reaction , fluorescence intensity corresponding to the oxidized aur was specifically observed in the reaction solution containing glucose , gox , and coac altogether , while other control samples did not yield any significant fluorescence intensities , clearly demonstrating that coac coupled with gox displayed specific fluorescence in the presence of target glucose ( figure 6a ). from an analysis of dose - response curves using coac for glucose detection , the limit of detection for glucose was determined to be as low as 5 mum in the linear range from 10 mum to 1 mm ( figure 6b ) .
these limit of detection ( lod ) and linear range values are among the best results of those recently reported , describing the various enzyme mimetics - based colorimetric measurements of glucose [ 30,31 ] .
we then examined the selectivity of coac - based biosensor for the fluorescent determination of glucose. through the typical reaction for glucose detection , glucose molecules are successfully detected by the generation of distinct fluorescence intensity ( figure 7a ) .
on the other hand , no significant fluorescence intensity is observed in the negative control samples where carbohydrate molecules similar to the target glucose are used even at tenfold higher concentrations .
these results demonstrate that a specific fluorescent reaction of only the target glucose is promoted by the coac - based system .
furthermore , we evaluated the clinical applicability of coac - based glucose biosensor by determining glucose concentrations in human serum samples .
as shown in figure 7b , the fluorescent responses of coac - based biosensor were measured with 1 mm glucose dissolved with different amounts of human serum .
the results show that the presence of serum had negligible effect and did not induce any significant changes (< 7 %) in fluorescence responses , demonstrating the coac - based glucose biosensing platform could represent a practical analytical system capable of diagnosing high level of glucose ( hyperglycemia ) [ 32 ] in complex clinical samples like human blood serum .
3.6 .
diagnosis of high level of glucose ( hyperglycemia ) using blood serum samples finally , this fluorescent glucose assay was employed to diagnose different stages of glucose in real human blood serum , which correspond to the normal , boundary , and high stage of hyperglycemia ( normal ; <= 5.6 mm , boundary ; 5.6 - 7 mm , and high ; > 7 mm ) [ 32 ] .
original amount of glucose in serum sample was first determined by glucose assay kit ( sigma - aldrich , mo , usa ) and then predetermined amount of glucose was further added to make the representative levels .
as a result , the serum glucose levels were quantified with excellent precisions yielding cvs in a range of 1.27 - 5.06 % and recovery rates of 99.7 - 101.0 % ( table 1 ) , proving the excellent reproducibility and reliability of the method .
these results demonstrate that the coac - based assay system should serve as a promising analytical tool to diagnose high level of glucose in a real clinical system .
4. conclusions in summary , taking into the consideration of practical diagnostics for clinically important target molecules , this work has shown that coac demonstrated a promising analytic tool for glucose detection in blood serum samples at ph ~ 5.0 as peroxidase mimetics in the presence of h2o2 , after screening with feac , cuac , coac , znac , alac , niac , ceac , and mnac .
coac catalyzed the oxidation of aur to detect fluorescent h2o2 .
in the range from 10 microm to 1 mm of glucose , it was verified with highly sensitive and selective biosensing .

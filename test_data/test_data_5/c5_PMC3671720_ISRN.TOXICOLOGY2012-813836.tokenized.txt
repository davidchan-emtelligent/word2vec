alfuzosin , a selective alpha - 1a antagonistis is the most recently approved aaras , with limited cardiac toxicity and exclusively used for lower urinary tract syndromes ( luts ) .
in order to reduce pill burden and better patient compliance modified release ( mr ) formulations have been developed .
alfuzosin mr tablet was developed by the use of hot - melt granulation techniques using mono - and diglycerides as rate controlling membranes to minimize health care cost and uses of costly excipients .
the other purpose of the study was to evaluate in vitro - in vivo performance of the scale up batch in healthy human subjects for commercialization .
the blend uniformity ( mean +/ - rsd %) , assay , cumulative percent dissolution at 24 h , hardness , and friability of the biobatch were 100.2 +/ - 0.05 % , 100.43 +/ - 0.023 % , 93.98 % , 4.5 kg , 5 min , and 0.08 % , respectively .
the in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters under fasting conditions between test and reference formulations ( uroxatral 10 mg extended release tablets ) were comparable .
the 90 % ci , geometric mean ratio (%) and power of c max , auct , and auci of the fasting study for the test and reference formulation were 99.03 % to 122.78 % , 109 % , 0.998 ; 92.94 % to 116.71 % , 104 % , 1 ; 98.17 % to 124.01 % , 110 % 1 , respectively .
the scale up biobatch showed negligible difference in in vitro properties with respect to the pilot batch .
the formulation developed with these agents was safe to use as there were no serious adverse events developed during the conduction of the clinical trial on the healthy subjects .
furthermore , the developed formulation was bioequivalent with respect to rate and extends of absorption to the reference formulation .
1. introduction the chronic prostatitis syndromes and symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) are common among aged men and women [ 1 ] .
the etiology of prostatitis syndrome remain elusive , it does appear to be associated with a high incidence of voiding dysfunction [ 2 ] .
lower urinary tract syndromes ( luts ) are sometimes associated with enlarged prostate , commonly referred to as bph .
bph can exist without luts .
the bph sometimes causes blocks of bladder outflow [ 3 ] which cause pain and inflammation of the urinary tract .
if untreated they can cause impair urinary frequency , nocturia , incomplete emptying , and urinary hesitancy .
in the past , the treatment of luts , associated with clinical bph , was restricted to surgical interventions , such as transurethral resection of the prostate or open nucleation of the enlarged adenoma [ 4 ] .
in the last decade , however , minimally invasive treatment as well as noninvasive treatment options have been explored and developed , many of them based on the administration of heat to the enlarging adenoma and administration of the drug therapy including alpha - blockers and 5 alpha - reductage inhibitors .
selective alpha - adrenergic receptor antagonists ( aaras ) such as prazosin , terazosin , doxazosin , and tamsulosin are important in the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) [ 4 , 5 ] .
among these aaras only tamsulosin is uroselective which selectively blocked alpha - 1a receptor ( alpha - 1a predominate in the urinary tract and 1b in the vasculature ) .
therefore all aaras are suspected for the cardiovascular side effects as they all blocked the alpha - 1b .
alfuzosin is the most recently approved aaras , with limited cardiac toxicity in the united states for symptomatic treatment of bph .
alfuzosin , selective alpha - 1a blockers [ 6 ] differs from other aaras by the absence of a piperidine moiety and the presence of a diaminopropyl spacer , which confers alfuzosin with specific biochemical properties [ 7 ] .
alfuzosin is currently marketed throughout europe , asia , and latin america exclusively for the treatment of symptomatic bph .
there are 2 bioequivalent formulations available [ 8 ] : an immediate release form ( 2.5 mg , 3 times daily ) and a sustained - release form ( 5 mg , 2 times daily and 10 mg once daily ) .
the efficacy of both formulations has been demonstrated in well - designed placebo - controlled studies [ 9 , 10 ] .
the onset of action of alfuzosin is rapid from the first dose and it maintains symptom relief for up to 3 years [ 11 ] .
alfuzosin is highly water soluble [ 12 ] and after fasted conditions its oral bioavailability was increased by 40 % in consumption of 25 % food more than the normal food intake and c max by 50 % [ 13 ] .
a once - daily formulation , which delivers alfuzosin via a novel prolonged - release system , has been developed to improve the convenience of dosing and to provide optimal pharmacokinetic coverage over 24 h [ 14 , 15 ] .
since the drug is highly water soluble ( bcs class 1 drug ) [ 16 ] , controlling its release from the dosage forms is the major challenge to fabricate controlled release formulation [ 17 ] .
in order to control its release from the dosage forms , present marketed reference listed drug ( rld ) exploited many pharmaceutical rate controlling polymers , namely , hydroxy propyl ethyl cellulose , microcrystalline cellulose , ethylcellulose , and hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose to control release of highly soluble alfuzosin [ 11 ] .
therefore the aim of the present formulation development was to prepare control release alfuzosin 10 mg tablets by hot - melt extrusion process with the use of mono - and diglycerol as a rate controlling membrane .
the other aim of the study was to match the in vitro characteristics and in vivo performance of the formulation using bioequivalence study in the healthy volunteers to establish bioequivalence with respect to rld uroxatral .

the highest accuracy was also obtained from the diluted standard which was 96.9 % ( table 3 ) , bench top stability and stock solution stability ( table s11 in supplementary material ) and freeze thaw stability ( table s11 in supplementary material ) and room temperature stability ( table s11 in supplementary material ) were also in acceptable limit which signified the validity of the method .
3.4 .
pharmacokinetics and statistical analysis the linear plasma concentration ( mean +/ - sd ) versus time curves of 2 alfuzosin formulations applied to 35 subjects under fasting conditions are given in figure 2 .
the mean c max ( mean +/ - sd ng / ml ) of test and reference formulation were 10.212 +/ - 2.23 and 11.422 +/ - 2.23 , respectively , under fasting conditions .
the mean auct ( mean +/ - sd ng / ml * hr ) of test and reference were 196.172 +/ - 12.01 and 193.172 +/ - 12.01 while mean auci ( mean +/ - sd ng / ml * hr ) of test and reference formulations were 211.468 +/ - 13.51 and 196.468 +/ - 13.51 , respectively .

4. discussion to develop alfuzosin 10 mg extended release tablets , active pharmaceutical ingredient ( api ) was characterized to meet the fda regulation and showed comparative physicochemical and spectral characteristics with respect to the reference .
the structural elucidation of finished test formulation was carried out by using ir , nmr ( both proton and carbon ) , mass , dsc , and xrd .
the prominent ir peak for aromatic amine ( n - h stretching ) , aromatic (= c - h stretching ) , secondary amide ( c = o and c = h stretching ) between test , and reference were similar , which confirmed the structural similarity of functional groups between test and reference drug .
the proton nmr spectra between test and reference showed prominent peak at 11.9 ppm , 8.89 ppm , 7.7 ppm , and 3.34 ppm indicating similar chemical environment which was further confirmed by 13c nmr .
the chemical shift of proton and carbon nmr between two drugs were similar and hence the structure of these two molecules was considered to be similar .
furthermore , molecular weight of both test and reference was 390 ( tables s12 - s15 ) from mass spectrum for test and reference .
similar single pure peak at 339.33degreesc was obtained from the dsc of test and reference drug .
the diffraction pattern between two drugs had similar 2theta angle peak which further confirmed the similar structure of the molecule between two dosage forms .
finally elemental analysis of test and reference showed no change in c , h , and n contents of the drugs implied the requirement as per compendial limit .
these studies showed comparable spectral characteristics which signified sameness of test and reference dosage forms .
a compatibility study of the drug with the selected impurities was conducted for the period of 30 days at 50degreesc .
the analysis of the relative impurity was observed to find out the incompatibility .
the selected inactive ingredients were compatible with the study drugs and hence can be used for the development of the formulation since the content of the impurities was within the quality limit (< 0.11 %) .
the generic alfuzosin 10 mg er tablets were prepared by hot - melt granulation using mono - and diglycerides as a rate controlling membrane [ 37 ] .
six different formulations ( table s3 in supplementary material ) were prepared at different label of lactose , mono - and diglycerides and evaluated in vitro hardness , friability , and dissolution rate , color , texture , diameter , and width of the tablets for optimization of formulation [ 38 - 40 ] .
afterwards ten formulations were processed based on the in vitro parameters as mentioned in the reference drug .
a batch formulation of the drug was also generated for further evaluations in the commercial scale .
finally a pivotal batch ( table 1 ) of alfuzosin hydrochloride er tablets 10 mg was planned to make 130,000 tablets .
the finished products were tested as it was tested for the raw api .
the recovery of the impurities and relative retention factor ( table s2 in supplementary material ) were less than 2 % which indicated that the tablets met regulatory requirement of stability at the finished product .
the residual solvent content ( of methanol , ethanol , diethyl ether , acetone , isopropyl alcohol , dichloromethane , ethyl acetate , tetrahydrofuran ) in the finished product was less than 1 % which further satisfied the compendial requirement [ 29 , 41 ] .
the physicochemical characteristics of the finished products like hardness , assay , dissolution , and friability all are in the limit of the usp ( united state pharmacopeia standard ) .
the in vitro dissolution of the test drug after 20 h was 87 % as compare to the innovator product which was 103 % showing slow controlled release of the drug from the dosage forms .
alfuzosin was released from the matrix tablets by diffusion and erosion mechanisms in all of the formulations .
assay of finished tablets were between 80 to 120 % and rsd was below 10 % which indicated that the product was equivalent to usp reference standard ( table s3 in supplementary material ) .
hplc method validation for estimation of alfuzosin in human plasma was adequate , since method did not show any matrix effects and the accuracy of the method was 103 % at the highest calibration concentration .
the recovery of the internal standard was about 68 % ( table 3 ) .
the highest accuracy was also obtained from the diluted standard which was 96.9 % ( table s11 in supplementary material ) , bench top stability and stock solution stability and freeze thaw stability ( table s11 in supplementary material ) , and room temperature stability ( table s11 in supplementary material ) were also within acceptable regulatory limit which signifies the validity of the method .
the generic alfuzosin hcl 10 mg er tablets was prepared using mono - and diglyceride as oppose to the innovator formulation containing hpmc and ethyl cellulose .
the difference in the formulation between test and innovator drug is presented in table 7 .
so it falls under major changes , and hence to get marketing approval product needs to show bioequivalent to the innovator product in therapeutic outcome .
hence a bioequivalence study was conducted as per usfda regulatory guideline for the generic products under fasting conditions in a two way cross over design .
cross - over design was chosen to establish bioequivalence , since cross over design reduced variability by using same subject in two different periods where genetic changes were no longer a factor to increase variability of the drug and also reduced the bias of selecting the pharmacogenomic unequal subjects between test and reference drugs .
hence the cross over design requires minimum subjects to establish bioequivalence of the generic drug .
the bias of selecting the subjects in the equivalence trial was further removed by using randomization schedule ( data not shown ) .
a single dose two period , 2 sequence , 2 treatment cross - over study with a minimum wash - out period of 7 days was carried out in fasting conditions for alfuzosin formulation ( fda guidelines , 2005 ) .
in the present cross - over study , 35 and 42 subjects were dosed in each of the study period under fasting conditions .
subjects were restricted to toilet and heavy physical exercise for first 2 h following administration of the drug in order to maintain similar environment .
study schedule and sampling schedule following drug administration were followed as per protocol .
all the subjects were supplied a standard meal that had 950 to 1000 kcal ( kilo calorie ) at 4.00 , 8.00 , and 12.00 h after drug administration .
since food may affect the absorption and dissolution of the drug and which in turn increased the variability of the pk parameters .
in order to avoid such circumstances food with uniform calorie content was supplied to each of the volunteers during study period .
a test drug is considered to be pharmacokinetic equivalent in turn bioequivalence to a reference drug product if the 90 % ci of the test and reference geometric mean ratios of the aucs and c max fall within 0.80 to 1.25 .
all subjects were monitored for vital sign , blood pressure and pulse rate to document any adverse events .
scheduled blood sample was taken from each subject in order to measure the drug in blood at each time point so that a concentration versus time graph can be constructed to describe rate and extend of absorption of the drug .
a hplc method was validated to determine the concentration of the drug at each scheduled time points .
the reproducibility of the method was tested using various trial batches .
the linearity range ( 0.050 to 30.0 ng / ml ) was fixed based upon the results of 6 trial batches .
the heterosedasticity of various concentrations was eliminated by using appropriate weighing factor to construct the linear calibration curve .
the maximum regression coefficient was fixed to greater than 0.9 .
the validity of the method was tested by studying matrix effects , dilution integrity stock solution stability at various temperatures ( table s11 in supplementary material ) , ruggedness , % recovery of the drug as well as internal standard , intra - and interday precession and accuracy ( table 3 ) .
the stability of the drug was tested against room temperature , freezing temperature , at bench top , reinjection , short - term and long - term stability of the drug ( table s11 in supplementary material ) .
the descriptive statistics of the individual subject concentration at each time points was used to construct a linear mean graph ( figure 3 ) and the significance of the linear mean graph was to compare pk profile between test and reference alfuzosin to conclude bioequivalence without statistical testing .
in addition , semilog graph was constructed to show the parametric distribution of alfuzosin content in blood plasma and population therapeutic effects ( table 8 ) .
the individual subject 's pk parameters and descriptive statistics of the untransformed pk parameters ( tables 4 and 5 ) were tabulated for visual comparison between test and reference under fasting conditions before statistical analysis .
log transformation was done to bring the nonparametric data to parametric forms so that two one sided test and anova can able to estimate the ratio and 90 % confidence interval .
further sequence , period , and treatment effects were also calculated by the help of generalized linear model in proc glm in sas v 9.2 .
in the present model sequence effects were tested at 10 % level of significance whereas other effects were tested at 5 % level of significance .
in addition , subject nested within sequence as an error term used during modeling , were not shown in the data .
significance of primary pk parameters was to draw conclusion whether a generic product can be given marketing authorization within the limit of efficacy safety and tolerability of an innovator drug .
in the present study single dose pharmacokinetics study is similar to steady - state pharmacokinetics and healthy subjects' pharmacokinetics is proportional to the patients' pharmacokinetics .
american pharmaceutical association ( 2003 ) has approved drug therapeutic equivalence information ( 2003 ) .
hence pharmacokinetics evaluation is critical to establish therapeutic equivalence in turn establish bioequivalence .
therefore a single dose pharmacokinetics study was conducted to establish bioequivalence .
the significance of all primary pk parameters are to access the rate and extend of drug absorption which corresponds to onset of action ( c max , rate of drug absorption ) and duration of action ( auct and auci ) that is , total amount of drug absorbed .
if the variability of these three parameters between test and reference are very narrow that is , about within +/ - 20 % , there will not be any chance to under action ( sub therapeutic effects ) or over action ( adverse reaction ) .
so , statistical equivalence of c max , auct and auci between test and reference drug would bring a substituted generic which can switch over innovator .
the primary pk parameters from this study , at 90 % cis were within the predefined bioequivalence criteria of 80 to 125 % for the study under fasting conditions ( table 8 ) .
the pk study results revealed that the two formulations of alfuzosin were similar in pk characteristics among these healthy indian subjects under fasting conditions .
the 90 % confidence intervals of log transformed pk metrics for the ratio of c max , auct and auci were 99.03 % to 122.78 % , 92.94 % to 116.71 % , and 98.17 % to 124.01 % funder fasting conditions ( table 8 ) and met alfuzosin bioequivalence criteria as per emea regulation ( fda , guideline of orally administered drug 's bioequivalence study ) .
furthermore , the mean t half ( 7.89 h ) and t max ( 6.00 h ) obtained from the test drug was comparable with reference drug 's t half ( 7.89 h ) and t max ( 6.00 h ) ( tables 4 and 5 ) .
the safety and tolerability of both the formulations was comparable .
adverse events were assessed for severity and relationship to the treatments throughout the study .
alfuzosin was well tolerated by all the volunteers with no clinically significant adverse events ( aes ) such as increased neutrophil count , vomiting abdominal blotting and headache in the healthy subject .
since safety of the test formulation was better than the reference in the study , proposed changes in the formulation are acceptable and inactive ingredients used for the development of the formulations were safe .
the inactive ingredients of the proposed generic formulation can be further changed to cheaper ingredients to bring down the production cost of the generic product and hence health care cost which warrants further research works .
a in vivo in vitro correlation ( ivivc ) was tried to establish in order to select suitable in vitro dissolution media .
to establish reasonable correlation , ivivc link model was used which support linear regression only .
the nonlinearity of observed values was adjusted with the variation by the link mode to generate level - a correlation .
since only linear correlation is accepted for the waiver approval , hence other nonlinear regression was not applied for better correlation .
based on the ivivc analysis acetate buffer offered highest level a correlation of 0.97 ( figure 2 ( c )) and hence selected as a compendial media for future waiver of higher strength of same formulation without undergoing costly be study .
5. conclusion the drug excipients compatibility studies were conducted and found satisfactory for intended purpose .
the rate controlling polymer mono - and diglycerides had no significant impact on the impurity profile of the drug .
hence these polymers were considered as safe for the development of the extended release formulation as a rate controlling membrane .
since assay results of formulations and impurities were found within the acceptance criteria , the hplc method was precise for quantification of impurities in alfuzosin hydrochloride api .
in vivo study concluded that the test product is bioequivalence to the reference product in fasting conditions .
the significant correlation between in vitro and in vivo parameters indicated that the ivivc was excellent in predicting auct , but not acceptable in predicting c max because of high variability observed in maximum plasma concentrations among the healthy volunteers which is probably due to first pass metabolism .
it is also observed that the least prediction errors of auct was - 2.32 at ph 6.8 , hence phosphate buffer ph 6.8 can be consider as a discriminative media for in vitro dissolution study .
in final conclusion , the results suggested that the scale - up of highly permeable and highly soluble drugs did not significantly affect either in vitro dissolution or in vivo performance .
it was further concluded based on the in vivo study that the test product was bioequivalence to the reference product in the present study .

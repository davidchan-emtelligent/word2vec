during the last decade , evidence collected in cognitive , developmental , and comparative research showed that adults prevented from verbal counting , along with infants and non - human animals possess numerical systems that are independent of language ( the so - called " non - verbal numerical abilities ") .
interestingly very similar results were reported among mammals , birds , and fish , leading some authors to believe in the existence of the same numerical systems shared among vertebrates ( feigenson et al. , 2004 ; beran , 2008 ; agrillo et al. , 2012 ) .
however , the exact nature of these capacities is unknown and it is currently unclear whether or not the similar performance described in the literature is the result of a common origin of cognitive skills , or instead reflects independent convergent evolutions .
some of these comparative studies have recently received a lot of media coverage , as they suggested that numerical discrimination is not only a vertebrates' prerogative .
bees , for instance , proved able to reach a food reward , apparently by enumerating the landmarks encountered sequentially during flight ( dacke and srinivasan , 2008 ) ; bees can also make use of numbers in a sequential matching - to - sample task ( gross et al. , 2009 ) .
ants reportedly pass numerical information to other ants when transferring information about which branch of a maze contains food ( reznikova and ryabko , 2011 ) and spiders ( nelson and jackson , 2012 ) are believed to base their settling decisions in nest selection on the number of already settled conspecifics , preferring to join nests where only one conspecific is present ( instead of 0 , 2 , or 3 conspecifics ) .
the idea that organisms with such a small brain size can somehow process numerical information has opened a wide debate in the scientific community as to whether these studies have properly controlled for non - numerical continuous variables that co - vary with numbers ( i.e. , cumulative surface area , density , overall space occupied by the groups , etc. ) .
after all , the potential implications of these works could not be underestimated by neuroscientists : the very idea that higher - level cortical mechanisms are a sine qua non condition for number processing is at risk .
the study by stoianov and zorzi ( 2012 ) , which is based on computational models , has now provided a potential explanation for the astonishing numerical abilities of invertebrates .
the authors used deep networks ; that is , a multilayer neural system that shares top - down and bottom - up connections to infer perceptions of the sensory input .
the study investigated sensitivity to numerical information in terms of internal coding by hidden neurons after learning ( the network had one visible layer encoding sensory data and two hidden layers hierarchically organized ) .
the results showed that highest - level populations of as few as 35 hidden neurons were able to support the process of numerosity estimation .
this implies that numerosity might be potentially extracted with the use of a very limited number of neurons , definitively far fewer neurons than was previously thought ( dehaene and changeux , 1993 ) .
it is important to note that the response of hidden neurons was not initially stipulated ; just the opposite , it represented an unsupervised emergent property .
stimuli - - patterns representing objects differing in numerosity - - were strictly controlled for non - numerical continuous quantities that co - vary with numbers ( such as cumulative surface area , shape , size , and density of the objects ) , thus preventing the possibility that results were due to a more general ability to estimate continuous amounts .
even more remarkably , the model 's deepest layer proved to be able to support human - like performance , as the internal weber fraction in relative numerosity judgments strictly resembled that commonly observed in humans .
the idea that numerosity estimation can spontaneously emerge as a statistical property aligns with a previous study on adult humans which suggests that the ability to estimate the number of items might be a sort of primary visual property of stimuli , such as color and contrast , that is based on a low - level mechanism ( burr and ross , 2008 ) .
above all , the conclusions of stoianov and zorzi ( 2012 ) are in line with a recent theoretical view that emphasizes the importance of neural circuits , rather than the size of brain regions that are supposed to modulate higher cognitive functions ( chittka and niven , 2009 ) .
these results may also have implications in the theoretical debate that surrounds non - verbal estimation of other magnitudes , such as time and space .
according to walsh ( 2003 ) , time , space , and number would be processed by a common magnitude system ( a theory of magnitude which is commonly called " atom ") that is mainly located in the parietal lobe .
the theory has been primarily investigated by using either contrast paradigms ( agrillo et al. , 2010 ) or the observation of neuro - anatomical correlates ( cohen kadosh et al. , 2008 ) .
computational models could provide useful insights as well .
indeed , one potential prediction of atom would be that , just as emergent numerosity detectors are now recognized , emergent space , and time detectors should be reported .
in addition , if there is a common system , then the same number of neurons should be required to process the three magnitudes .
any significant difference would suggest at least a partial independence in processing these magnitudes. of course , the model created by stoianov and zorzi ( 2012 ) also needs to be tested in a wider range of contexts .
in their research , stimuli consisted of 30 x 30 pixel images that contained from 1 to 32 rectangular figures .
none of the figures overlapped each other , and they were all separated by at least one pixel .
however , in everyday life - - for instance , when we have to select a queue that contains the least amount of people - - stimuli can move incessantly in a tridimensional space , modifying their inter - individual distance or changing orientation and , hence , the visible area .
they can also partially to totally occlude each other .
the numerosity estimation of natural stimuli might be processed by a larger neural network than that suggested by the authors .
in line with this argumentation , neuroimaging studies support the idea that humans recruit distinct brain areas that involve , but are not limited to , inferior parietal regions to estimate numerosity ( for meta - analysis , see arsalidou and taylor , 2011 ) .
it is worth noting that the model presented only a 30 x 30 pixel resolution , and that numerosity detection is primarily based on a signal from center - surround neurons that are described in the early visual system .
the possibility remains that the quantity of numerosity detectors might increase while increasing the visual resolution of the model. from a theoretical point of view , it is possible that organisms that have a small brain size and reduced visual resolution might be properly equipped with the few numerosity detectors which were described in stoianov and zorzi 's study ( 2012 ) , while humans and other species that have better visual resolution might display more numerosity detectors .
future studies are required in order to test this hypothesis .
in this sense , the model that is described in their paper might be considered a very useful formal model of human abstract numerosity estimation that captures key elements - - namely , center - surround filtering and normalization with global visual properties of human numerosity estimation .
however , some details need to be further clarified with respect to the visual processes that are involved in numerosity estimation .
one thing is certain : the study by stoianov and zorzi ( 2012 ) now paves the way for further investigation into the computational bases of numerosity estimation within non - human animals .
specific deep networks might be set up according to the peculiarities of different species ( i.e. , that take into account the different number of sensory and internal neurons ) , helping us to shed light on the true nature of the similar performance reported in the literature : similar results with respect to the computational bases would support the " common origin " hypothesis of non - verbal numerical abilities , while the opposite pattern of data would support rather the " convergent evolution " hypothesis .
we can only speculate about this latter point , but at least the lesson we can currently draw is clear : 35 units can spontaneously learn how to extract numerical information .
this is enough even for simpler organisms than those reported in the literature .
the last decade of comparative psychology was characterized by the discovery of numerical abilities in almost all vertebrate species .
in light of the conclusions of stoianov and zorzi ( 2012 ) , we must now expect the coming decade to be epitomized by a wide - scale invasion of invertebrates into the numerical cognition literature .
i am profoundly indebted to ivilin stoianov for the productive discussion of the issues here addressed .

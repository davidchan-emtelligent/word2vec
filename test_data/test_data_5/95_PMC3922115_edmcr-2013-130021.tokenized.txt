summary neuroendocrine tumours ( nets ) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms whose management can be problematic .
in many cases , multiple tumours may occur in the same patient or his or her family , and some of these have now been defined genetically , although in other cases the underlying gene or genes involved remain unclear .
we describe a patient , a 63 - year - old female , who was diagnosed with a medullary thyroid carcinoma ( mtc ) , which was confirmed pathologically after thyroidectomy , but whose circulating calcitonin levels remained elevated after thyroidectomy with no evidence of metastatic disease .
subsequently , an entirely separate and discrete duodenal net was identified ; this was 2.8 cm in diameter and was removed at partial duodenectomy .
the tumour stained immunohistochemically for calcitonin , and its removal led to persistent normalisation of the circulating calcitonin levels .
there was no germline mutation of the ret oncogene .
this is the first identification of a duodenal net secreting calcitonin and also the first demonstration of a second tumour secreting calcitonin in a patient with mtc .
we suggest that where calcitonin levels remain high after removal of a mtc a search for other nets should be conducted .
learning points nets are a complex and heterogeneous group of related neoplasms , and multiple tumours may occur in the same patient .
calcitonin can be produced ectopically by several tumours outside the thyroid .
persistently elevated calcitonin levels after removal of a mtc may not necessarily indicate persisting or metastatic disease from the tumour .
the real prevalence of calcitonin - producing nets may be underestimated , as serum determination is only recommended in the diagnosis of pancreatic nets .
background despite an increase in prevalence in recent years , neuroendocrine tumours ( nets ) are still a relatively rare finding and a clinical challenge because of their low incidence ( 2 - 5 '/ 100 000 cases per year ( 1 ) ( 2 )) , the heterogeneity of this group of tumours and the variability in their clinical behaviour and prognosis .
duodenal nets constitute some 4 % of all carcinoid neoplasias and 1 - 3 % of all duodenal tumours ( 1 ) .
although they can potentially produce a wide variety of systemic and locoregional symptoms ( anaemia , intestine obstruction and diarrhoea ) , only 10 % are associated with a functional syndrome , and so in most of the cases , the patient remains asymptomatic until the mass effect dominates or they are discovered as an incidental finding at endoscopy or surgery ( 3 ) ( 4 ) .
it has been estimated that it usually takes 7 years from the appearance of the first symptom until the diagnosis of a mid - gut carcinoid ( 5 ) .
medullary thyroid carcinoma ( mtc ) is a net of thyroid parafollicular cells , with some 20 % showing germline mutations of the ret oncogene .
it often appears as a single thyroid nodule located in the upper two - thirds of a lobe , reflecting the anatomical location of the parafollicular cells .
we report the association of two co - existing nets , a mtc and an extremely rare calcitonin - secreting duodenal tumour , complicating the follow - up of the patient in whom we suspected persisting or metastatic disease .
case presentation a 63 - year - old woman was referred to our clinic following the incidental finding of a 1 cm thyroid nodule .
fine - needle aspiration cytology revealed a mtc .
subsequently , plasma calcitonin levels were found to be elevated at 84 pg / ml ( normal < 11.5 pg / ml ) .
there were no other abnormal findings .
the presence of a co - existing phaeochromocytoma was biochemically excluded ( normal urinary catecholamine and metanephrine levels ) , and the patient was subjected to total thyroidectomy with clearance of central and lateral lymph node compartments .
the pathology demonstrated a calcified 1 cm nodule consisting of polygonal cells showing positive immunostaining for chromogranin , calcitonin , s - 100 and carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ; fig. 1 ) .
the lymph nodes were clear of disease .
genetic analysis of peripheral lymphocytes of the ret oncogene ( automated sequencing of the flanking exons 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 and 16 ) did not reveal any germline mutation .

investigation the patient recovered well from the operation , but exhibited persistently elevated plasma calcitonin levels , although she remained asymptomatic .
over the following 3 years , her plasma calcitonin levels were persistently elevated , although with no clear signs of progression ( 106 , 116 , 83 , 173 , 212 , 279 and 114 pg / ml ) .
her circulating cea levels remained normal .
we suspected persisting or metastatic disease , but further repeated and detailed imaging including computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance ( mr ) scanning of the neck , chest and abdomen failed to reveal any evidence of tumour .
functional imaging with radiolabelled octreotide ( octreoscan ) and fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) - positron emission tomography ( pet ) scanning demonstrated mild uptake of both tracers in the midline , adjacent to l2 , and further ct scanning was undertaken concentrating on this area .
no clear abnormality was observed , and it was concluded at this stage that the apparent uptake was due to duodenal ' physiological tracer elimination ' .
however , after 3 years , the patient was found to have developed an iron - deficiency anaemia associated with positive faecal occult blood testing .
endoscopy was undertaken , and it showed chronic atrophic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia , but in addition a large ( 3 cm ) polyp was found in the second part of the duodenum , which was biopsied .
treatment the duodenal biopsy showed a net , and the patient was subsequently re - explored surgically and partial duodenectomy was performed .
pathological examination confirmed a 2.8 cm well - differentiated net with positive immunohistochemistry for cam5.2 , ac1 - ae3 , enolase , chromogranin , synaptophysin and serotonin ; the ki - 67 index was < 2 % ( grade 1 ) .
surprisingly , after resection of the duodenal tumour , circulating calcitonin levels remained repeatedly undetectable , and thus the tissue was immunostained for calcitonin ; this was strongly positive ( fig. 2 ) .

outcome and follow - up currently , the patient remains asymptomatic with persistently undetectable serum calcitonin levels and no further anaemia .
she remains with mildly elevated serum chromogranin a and gastrin levels ( last determination of serum gastrin levels : 591 pg / ml , normal < 40 ; fig. 3 ) , which we attribute to her chronic atrophic gastritis .

discussion we have reported a case of the association of two nets identified in one patient , both associated with calcitonin secretion , but in the absence of a germline ret mutation .
calcitonin is a peptide hormone that is normally secreted by thyroid c cells , but may be produced ectopically by pancreatic nets , phaeochromocytomas , melanomas , cervical cancer , breast and colorectal cancers , and small - cell lung and other pulmonary cancers , but usually in association with other ectopically produced peptides ( 6 ) .
in a prospective study , fleury et al .
( 7 ) systematically determined calcitonin levels in 66 patients with pancreatic nets referred to their service over 3 months : elevated levels were found in six patients ( 9 % of the total ) .
while calcitonin is currently recognised as a tumour marker for nets , its routine determination is only recommended at diagnosis for pancreatic nets ( 7 ) .
for the follow - up of mtc , the determination of circulating calcitonin levels is of central importance .
after total thyroidectomy , detectable calcitonin values are strongly indicative of residual disease or possible recurrence or metastasis , and changes of this marker in the serum can be observed much earlier than changes in imaging .
however , in this case , we were surprised by the continuing high levels of calcitonin as there appeared to have been total clearance of the original small mtc .
the american thyroid association guidelines recommend that post - operative patients with plasma calcitonin levels > 150 pg / ml should undergo neck ultrasound and additional imaging techniques for the evaluation of distant metastases ( grade : b recommendation ) ( 8 ) .
optional imaging techniques include cervico - thoracic ct , liver multislice ct or mr imaging ( mri ) with contrast , mri of the spine and pelvis , and isotopic bone scanning .
recently , 68gallium dota - octreotide ( 68ga dotatoc ) has shown better visualisation of small lesions compared with the 111in - labelled counterpart in nets , but despite some studies being carried out using 68ga - labelled dota - lanreotide in mtc in order to establish the clinical value and obtain the best imaging protocol of this new tracer , further studies have to be conducted ( 9 ) .
18f18 - fdg ) - pet or 18f - dopamine ( 18f - dopa ) scans may also be useful , but the sensitivity of these scans is greatly diminished when calcitonin levels are < 1000 pg / ml ( 10 ) .
metaiodobenzylguanidine ( mibg ) uptake in mtc is unpredictable , and the data about the use of mibg show that only a small fraction ( about 30 %) of mtcs are able to concentrate it , but it can be used as a complement for the rest of the techniques in a combined diagnostic approach ( 11 ) .
in our patient , the standard cross - sectional imaging with ct and mr was unhelpful , and we proceeded to use functional imaging .
however , the uptake observed in both the octreotide scan and the fdg - pet scan was misinterpreted as physiological as there was no clear cross - sectional correlate .
this appears to be a unique case of a patient with a duodenal tumour secreting calcitonin , which has not been described previously in a patient with a previous classical mtc .
while we regard this association as more than coincidental , we cannot at present identify any genetic predisposition .

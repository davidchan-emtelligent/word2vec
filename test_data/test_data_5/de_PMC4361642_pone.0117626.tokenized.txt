in this study , a viral microarray based assay was developed to detect the human herpesviruses and enteroviruses associated with central nervous system infections , including herpes simplex virus type 1 , type 2 ( hsv1 and hsv2 ) , epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) , enterovirus 71 ( ev71 ) , coxsackievirus a 16 ( ca16 ) and b 5 ( cb5 ) .
the dna polymerase gene of human herpesviruses and 5 ' - untranslated region of enteroviruses were selected as the targets to design primers and probes .
human herpesviruses dna and enteroviruses rna were extracted simultaneously by using a guanidinium thiocyanate acid buffer , and were subsequently amplified through a biotinylated asymmetry multiplex rt - pcr with the specific primer of enteroviruses .
in total , 90 blood samples and 49 cerebrospinal fluids samples with suspected systemic or neurological virus infections were investigated .
out of 139 samples , 66 were identified as positive .
the specificities of this multiplex rt - pcr microarray assay were over 96 % but the sensitivities were various from 100 % for hsv1 , hsv2 , ev71 and cb5 , 95.83 % for cmv , 80 % for ebv to 71.43 % for ca16 in comparison with reference standards of taqman qpcr / qrt - pcr .
the high kappa values (& gt ; 0.90 ) from hsv1 , hsv2 , cmv , ev71 and cb5 were obtained , indicating almost perfect agreement in term of the 5 viruses detection .
but lower kappa values for ebv ( 0.63 ) and ca16 ( 0.74 ) displayed a moderate to substantial agreement .
this study provides an innovation of simultaneous extraction , amplification , hybridization and detection of dna viruses and rna viruses with simplicity and specificity , and demonstrates a potential clinical utility for a variety of viruses' detection .

introduction infections of central nervous system ( cns ) , such as encephalitis , meningitis , and meningoencephalitis , remain a major global cause of morbidity and mortality .
the epidemiology of viral infection in cns has changed dramatically following the introduction of vaccination .
herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 ( hsv1 and hsv2 ) , belonging to genus of human herpes viruses ( hhvs ) , are currently the most common causes of sporadic viral encephalitis ; more importantly , the average mortality rate for patients with herpes simplex encephalitis is approximately 70 % if left untreated [ 1,2 ] .
in addition , enteroviruses ( evs ) are also the most common causes of viral meningitis [ 2 ] .
out of evs , enterovirus 71 ( ev71 ) and coxsackievirus 16 ( ca16 ) have often circulated alternatively or together in the western pacific region , causing hand , foot and mouth disease even serious cns complications in infants and young children in recent years [ 3,4 ] .
coxsackievirus b5 ( cb5 ) has been reported to be responsible for recent outbreak in our province [ 5 ] .
in addition , infections of cns can also be caused by human cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) [ 6,7 ] , esterin - barr virus ( ebv ) , and other pathogens [ 8,9 ] .
early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent further disease deterioration .
however the clinical manifestations of cns infections from different pathogens are non - specific and clinically indistinguishable , which makes the early diagnosis difficult , it is essential to develop a rapid and comprehensive virology testing technique to diagnose cns infection and improves the therapeutic management [ 10,11 ] .
despite real - time qpcr has been introduced to diagnostic laboratory , only a fraction of pathogens can be detected in patients with suspected cns infectious syndromes .
nevertheless , there are potential risks of cross - contaminations in qpcr process due to its high sensitivity [ 12 ] .
the recent advancement of diagnostic for infectious disease relies on development of multiplexing technologies to simultaneously identify more than one pathogen in clinical specimens [ 13 ] .
microarray with pathogen - specific probes has become one of the most powerful tools in microbial diagnosis as it enables high throughput assays that in principle capable of identifying every microorganism in a specimen [ 14 ] .
so far , several microarrays for detection of viruses associated with cns infections have been reported [ 15 - 19 ] .
for example , korimbocus et al [ 15 ] designed a dna microarray to detect three species of viruses , including hhvs , evs and flaviviruses , which demonstrated the feasibility of identifying various virus species on one array but showed fatal defects of separate isolation and amplification of different dna and rna viruses .
zheng et al. developed a dna microarray based on multiplex pcr to detect seven hhvs simultaneously in a single specimen [ 16 ] .
this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of an oligonucleotide microarray based on simultaneous extraction and amplification of dna and rna viruses to identify different hhvs and evs in a single clinical specimen .

the results of sequencing showed the homologous sequences between both samples and cb5 isolated strain vr - 1036 were 97 % and 95 % , separately , which were consistent with the results in microarray assay .
there were two ca16 positive samples in qrt - pcr showing negative in microarray .
therefore we did sequencing for them and discovered their target sequences were the ca16 variants which showed only 14 base pairs identical with the ca16 probe sequence .
we further analyzed the differences of both assays for ebv .
three ebv positive samples identified by qpcr were reported to be negative by microarray .
we traced their the qpcr detection details which indicated ebv copies were all slightly higher than threshold in qpcr assay but a little lower than nrs 3.0 in microarray .
one sample of ebv and cmv positive was also identified in the microarray demonstrating its capability to detect co - infection of different viruses .
discussion viruses are the major cause of cns infections , ahead of bacteria , parasites and fungal agents [ 22 ] .
the use of real time pcr ( qpcr ) has revolutionized clinical viral diagnostic approaches [ 4,23 ] .
at present , increasing numbers of hhvs and evs have been reported to be causative pathogens in cns infections , however , current detection method for hhvs and evs has still to be carried out at the separated multiple steps : first , to extract dna and rna from hhvs and evs with proteinase k / phenol - chloroform - isaamyl alcohol and trizol / chloroform - isopropanol , ; second , to run pcr for dna materials and rt - pcr for rna materials ; third , to identify specific viruses with different hybridizations or sequencing .
the total elapsed time is more than one day .
more importantly , the amount of sample required in the current method is at least 400 mul .
so a comprehensive high throughput identification method is warranted .
in this study , we described a rapid and specific detection method for two genera of viruses of hhvs and evs from the same sample .
the viral microarray was restricted to four hhvs ( hsv1 , hsv2 , ebv and cmv ) and three evs ( ev71 , ca16 and cb5 ) .
the total process time was only 5.5 hours , including simultaneous extraction of hhvs dna and evs rna with a guscn buffer and subsequently simultaneous amplification with the biotinylated asymmetry multiplex - rt - pcr followed by hybridization with the microarray .
the required sample size was only 100 mul which is especially necessary for infants and young children as the samples are very precious and would be insufficient if using the current methods .
in multiplex pcr , primer compatibility problem often occurs when different pairs of primers are mixed together in one single reaction , and the variable suppression effects on some of primer pairs may cause false - negative results due to primers secondary structures and / or different g + c contents [ 12 ] .
to minimize the potential suppression effects , we selected conservative genes to design the universal primers that there would be as less primer sets as possible .
after studying the different genes from various hhvs , highly conservative dna polymerase gene was determined as the target gene to design primers and probes [ 15 - 19 ] .
in regard to evs , high conservation of the 5 ' - untranslated region ( 5 ' - utr ) has been reported and applied to develop microarray for detection of evs [ 15,24 - 26 ] .
we analyzed the 5 ' - utr sequences of different evs from genbank database , one pair of primers were designed to amplify the majority of enteroviruses .
in total , four hhvs and three evs were determined as the target viruses in the study .
the probes were designed based on the variable regions between forward and reverse primers .
fluorophore labels used commonly for microarray analysis are cyanine 3 ( cy3 ) and cyanine 5 ( cy5 ) which exhibit efficient quantum yields , moderate photostability , unique excitation and emission spectra but with lower sensitivity in comparison with taqman qpcr [ 12,17,27 ] .
to enhance detection sensitivity of this viral microarray , the biotin - streptavidin - - cy3 signal amplification system was used and an asymmetric multiplex rt - pcr was established by adding biotin labeled forward primers to reverse primers of hhv - r and ev - r in a proportion of 9 to 1 and even much lower for ebv - r due to its higher amplification efficiency .
the detection limits of this viral microarray were 6 copies for hhvs and 60 copies for evs .
in this study , the sensitivity was performed with recombinant viral controls , which could be lower in infected cells or clinical samples because material extracted from cells or clinical samples could contain additional factors such as cellular dna , rna and trace protein that would negatively impact the efficiency of pcr and therefore reduce sensitivity .
this asymmetry multiplex rt - pcr microarray was optimized by using a small numbers of confirmed positive clinical samples and will be further applied to more clinical samples in order to improve the application value for clinical diagnosis .
the asymmetry multiplex rt - pcr microarray provides an innovation technique of simultaneous extraction , amplification and hybridization of viruses with simplicity and specificity .
it only takes approximately five and half hours from extraction of viral genome to rt - pcr amplification and microarray hybridization with only 100 mul of samples , demonstrating its suitability for the detection of both human herpesviruses and enteroviruses from one single sample including csf .
more importantly , this array is flexible and easy to enlarge and modify to detect various human herpesviruses and enteroviruses for routine application in clinical laboratory .

summary the physiological role of autophagic flux within the vascular endothelial layer remains poorly understood .
here , we show that in primary endothelial cells , oxidized and native ldl stimulates autophagosome formation .
moreover , by both confocal and electron microscopy , excess native or modified ldl appears to be engulfed within autophagic structures .
transient knockdown of the essential autophagy gene atg7 resulted in higher levels of intracellular 125i - ldl and oxidized ldl ( oxldl ) accumulation , suggesting that in endothelial cells , autophagy may represent an important mechanism to regulate excess , exogenous lipids .
the physiological importance of these observations was assessed using mice containing a conditional deletion of atg7 within the endothelium .
following acute intravenous infusion of fluorescently labeled oxldl , mice lacking endothelial expression of atg7 demonstrated prolonged retention of oxldl within the retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) and choroidal endothelium of the eye .
in a chronic model of lipid excess , we analyzed atherosclerotic burden in apoe - / - mice with or without endothelial autophagic flux .
the absence of endothelial autophagy markedly increased atherosclerotic burden .
thus , in both an acute and chronic in vivo model , endothelial autophagy appears critically important in limiting lipid accumulation within the vessel wall .
as such , strategies that stimulate autophagy , or prevent the age - dependent decline in autophagic flux , might be particularly beneficial in treating atherosclerotic vascular disease .

considerable attention and study has been directed at the molecular consequences following the subendothelial deposition of lipids .
these consequences include the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the subsequent engulfment of this deposited subendothelial lipid by resident macrophages ( chinetti - gbaguidi et al. , 2014 ; randolph , 2014 ) .
in contrast , relatively little is known regarding the steps proximal to lipid deposition and what regulatory role , if any , the endothelium might play in this process .
while evidence is limited for the case of the endothelium , in other cell types it appears that autophagy may play a critical role in maintaining overall lipid homeostasis .
for instance , mice bearing atg5 - deficient macrophages appear to exhibit increased plaque formation when bred with pro - atherogenic mouse strains ( liao et al. , 2012 ; razani et al. , 2012 ) .
while the basis for this increased plaque burden is undoubtedly complex , evidence suggests that macrophage - specific atg5 deletion results in impaired lipophagy ( sergin & razani , 2014 ) .
lipophagy refers to the specific degradation of lipids by the autophagic machinery .
this concept was perhaps first described in the liver where genetic disruption of macroautophagy led to the accumulation of lipid droplets ( singh et al. , 2009 ) .
these initial observations have been extended and lipophagy now appears to be important in maintaining lipid homeostasis in a diverse set of cell types from neurons to fibroblasts ( singh et al. , 2009 ; liu & czaja , 2013 ; settembre & ballabio , 2014 ) .
here , we demonstrate an important role for endothelial autophagy in maintaining vascular lipid homeostasis .
it has been previously observed that when endothelial cells in culture are exposed to oxldl they respond with an increase in autophagosomes ( nowicki et al. , 2007 ; zhang et al. , 2010 ; muller et al. , 2011 ; menghini et al. , 2014 ) .
in general , autophagic flux can be assessed by simultaneously analyzing the levels of lc3 - ii , which labels autophagosome membranes , and measuring the levels of p62 , a protein cleared via autophagic degradation .
the combination of increased lc3 - ii along with decreased p62 levels is consistent with an overall increase in autophagic flux .
consistent with past observations , following exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) to oxldl , the level of lc3 - i to lc3 - ii conversion was increased ( fig. 1a,b ) .
as we have previously described ( torisu et al. , 2013 ) , sirna - mediated knockdown of atg7 was effective in reducing atg7 expression in huvecs ( fig. s1a,b , supporting information ) , and endothelial cells with reduced atg7 expression had markedly impaired capacity to generate lc3 - ii before or after oxldl exposure ( fig. 1a,b ) .
the level of lc3 - ii following oxldl exposure was further enhanced by the presence of the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine ( fig. 1c ) .
in contrast , levels of p62 were not as markedly affected after oxldl exposure ( fig. 1a and fig. s1c ) raising the possibility , as previously noted , of alteration in lysosomal function after oxldl exposure ( jerome , 2010 ) .
when primary endothelial cells were electroporated with a plasmid encoding gfp - lc3 and subsequently exposed to fluorescently labeled oxldl , we noted an increase in lc3 dot formation , again consistent with an increase in autophagosomes ( fig. s1d,e ) .
interestingly , the oxldl within endothelial cells was often surrounded by gfp - lc3 positive structures whose appearance was consistent with autophagosomes ( fig. 1d ) .
these observations suggested that following uptake of oxldl , lipids may be directly or indirectly trafficked into autophagosomes .
moreover , given the growing evidence that intracellular lipids can be degraded by lysosomal lipases ( singh & cuervo , 2012 ; liu & czaja , 2013 ; settembre & ballabio , 2014 ) , intact endothelial autophagy might modulate levels of oxldl accumulation .
consistent with this hypothesis , oxldl accumulated at higher levels in endothelial cells lacking an intact autophagy machinery ( fig. 1e ) .

( j ) levels of fluorescently tagged inulin flux through huvec monolayer cultures .
( n = 3 , p = ns ) .
native ldl is thought to be taken up by receptor - mediated endocytosis and delivered to lysosomes through the endosomal pathway .
it has been appreciated for some time that genetic deficiencies in lysosomal lipase impairs cholesterol hydrolysis leading to intracellular lipid accumulation ( goldstein et al. , 1975 ) .
increasing evidence also suggests that endosomal and autophagosomal pathways are closely connected and share common machinery ( rusten et al. , 2012 ; hyttinen et al. , 2013 ) .
electron micrographs of huvecs incubated with gold - labeled native ldl identified gold - labeled particles within double membrane autophagosomal structures ( fig. 1f ) .
similar to what we observed following oxldl treatment , native ldl also appeared to increase the number of autophagosomes ( fig. s1f,g ) and to be in close contact with gfp - lc3 positive structures ( fig. s1h ) .
as we have previously described , we next used lentivirus - mediated shrnas to stably knockdown atg7 expression ( torisu et al. , 2013 ) .
we noted that 125i - ldl cholesterol accumulated to a higher level in cells with reduced atg7 ( fig. 1g ) .
increased 125i - ldl cholesterol accumulation was also observed following treatment of endothelial cells with the autophagy and lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine ( fig. 1h ) .
this increase was not due to any apparent alterations in levels of the ldl receptor of surface binding of 125i - ldl cholesterol ( fig. s1i,j ) .
the deposition of native or modified lipids in the sub - endothelial space is thought to contribute to vascular disease .
to begin to model this phenomenon in vitro , we analyzed the transcytosis of 125i - ldl cholesterol in confluent monolayers of huvecs following control or atg7 knockdown .
as noted in fig. 1i , following a 24 - h incubation , there was evidence for increased 125i - ldl transcytosis across atg7 - deficient endothelial monolayers .
in contrast , atg7 knockdown did not affect the permeability to inulin ( fig. 1j ) .
the differences in transcytosis rates may simply reflect higher rates of accumulation of 125i - ldl cholesterol in atg7 knockdown cells ( fig. 1g ) or perhaps may reflect recent observations directly linking autophagy to barrier function ( nighot et al. , 2015 ) .
while a number of sophisticated in vitro assays have been developed for assessing endothelial barrier function ( wegener & seebach , 2014 ) , we sought to assess a potentially more physiologically relevant model by analyzing mice with a conditional endothelial deletion of atg7 ( torisu et al. , 2013 ) .
we took advantage of the rich vascular plexus in the eye and the previously described transport of lipids from the choroidal blood vessels to the retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) ( picard et al. , 2010 ) .
to assess whether the acute handling of modified lipids depends on intact endothelial autophagy , we injected control mice ( wt / wt ; ve - cadherin cre ) or atg7endo mice ( fl / fl ; ve - cadherin cre ) mice with fluorescently labeled oxldl ( dil - oxldl ). we next analyzed the retinas of mice 24 and 48 h after oxldl injection by confocal microscopy .
deposits of dil - oxldl were evident in the mouse retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) and the choroidal endothelium beneath the rpe .
twenty - four hours post injection , dil - oxldl uptake in the mouse eye was similar in atg7 endo and control mice ( data not shown ) .
however , 48 h after dil - oxldl administration , the fluorescent tagged dil - oxldl was retained at higher levels within the rpe and choroidal endothelium of the atg7 endo mice than in wild - type tissue ( fig. 2a,b ) .
quantification of dil - oxldl fluorescence confirmed the increased persistence of dil - oxldl in atg7 endo mice ( fig. 2c , n = 6 eyes per group , p < 0.0001 by two - tailed t - test ) .
thus , in this acute model of modified ldl exposure , autophagy - deficient mice demonstrate increased and persistent lipid accumulation .

( f ) 16 weeks ( n = 12 apoe ko and n = 15 atg7endoapoe ko mice , * p < 0.01 by two - tailed unpaired t - test with welch 's correction ) and ( g ) 24 weeks of age ( n = 10 apoe ko and n = 7 atg7endo / apoe ko mice , * p < 0.03 by two - tailed unpaired t - test with welch 's correction ) .

( i ) quantification of plaque area at 16 weeks between the two genotypes ( n = 13 apoe ko and n = 12 atg7endo / apoeko mice , * p < 0.01 by two - tailed unpaired t - test with welch 's correction ) .
we next sought to assess a more chronic model of lipid exposure by crossing our control and atg7endo mice into an apoe - / - background .
the presence or absence of endothelial atg7 did not significantly alter serum lipid or glucose levels , nor did it alter overall body weight or body composition ( table s1 , supporting information ) .
in contrast , consistent with altered lipid handling , we observed increased en face oil red o - positive staining in high - fat - fed apoe - / - atg7endo mice ( fig. 2d ) .
these differences were maintained when mice were analyzed at 8 weeks of age ( e.g. , 4 weeks of high - fat diet ) , 16 weeks of age ( 12 weeks of high - fat diet ) or 24 weeks of age ( 20 weeks of high - fat diet ; fig. 2e - g ) .
a similar analysis of cross - sectional plaque area in the aortic root was also consistent with the observation that high - fat - fed apoe - / - atg7endo mice had increased atherosclerotic lesion size when compared with control animals ( fig. 2h,i ) .
preliminary analysis of the plaque composition revealed a trend for increased necrotic area in the apoe - / - atg7endo mice ( fig. s2 , supporting information ) .
taken together , our results demonstrate an important role for endothelial autophagy in maintaining vascular lipid homeostasis .
further work is needed to better define how autophagy modulates the intracellular fate of engulfed lipids ( fig. s1k ) .
nonetheless , the ability of endothelial cells to target excessive native or modified lipids for autophagy - dependent degradation appears to be an important mechanism to limit atherosclerotic plaque formation .
our in vitro results suggest that knockdown of atg7 or treatment with chloroquine can increase endothelial lipid accumulation .
given that chloroquine works as an inhibitor of lysosomal processes , the most likely explanation is that similar to what has been described in other tissues ; endothelial cells rely , at least in part , on autophagosomal - mediated delivery of lipids to the lysosome for degradation .
in this context , it may be relevant that the gene lysosomal acid lipase a ( lipa ) has been recently identified in genome - wide studies as a potential susceptibility locus for atherosclerotic disease ( wild et al. , 2011 ; vargas - alarcon et al. , 2013 ) .
in addition , it is of potential interest that a number of genes associated with lipid metabolism have also been linked to age - related retinal diseases ( black & clark , 2015 ) .
given that autophagic flux is believed to decline as a function of age ( cuervo , 2008 ) , the age - dependent decline in endothelial autophagy might contribute to the sharp rise in age - related cardiovascular disease .
interestingly , pharmacological efforts that augment autophagy appear to reverse some of the properties of mouse and human arterial aging ( larocca et al. , 2012 ) .
previous studies have also suggested that the atherosclerotic plaque is enriched for autophagosomes ( martinet & de meyer , 2009 ) .
in addition , recent mouse genetic studies have implicated the role of autophagy in macrophage foam cell formation ( muller et al. , 2011 ; ouimet et al. , 2011 ; le guezennec et al. , 2012 ; razani et al. , 2012 ; sergin & razani , 2014 ) .
our results complement these observations and suggest that similar to what was observed in macrophages , endothelial autophagy is important in limiting atherosclerotic progression .
it is tempting to speculate that enhancing autophagy may therefore be a beneficial strategy to reduce the rate of age - dependent cardiovascular disease .
such speculation is supported by previous observations including that inhibition of mtor ( a kinase known to function as a negative regulator of autophagy ) with pharmacological agents such as rapamaycin appears to inhibit atherosclerosis in a number of different animal models ( castro et al. , 2004 ; pakala et al. , 2005 ; mueller et al. , 2008 ) .
similarly , strategies such as calorie restriction , that are known to elevate autophagic flux , appear to reduce cardiovascular disease in both mice and humans ( guo et al. , 2002 ; fontana et al. , 2004 ) .
manipulation of vascular autophagy might therefore be an attractive therapeutic target to potentially limit atherosclerotic disease independent of serum lipid values .

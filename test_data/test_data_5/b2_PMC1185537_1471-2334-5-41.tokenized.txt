background mucosal antibodies have been suggested to have a role in defence against pneumococcal infections .
we investigated here the ability of a seven - valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , pncompc , to induce mucosal immune response .
methods healthy finnish children ( n = 111 ) , a subcohort of the finnish otitis media vaccine trial , were recruited and 56 of them were immunised with the pncompc at the age of 2 , 4 , and 6 months .
at 12 months of age , 49 of them received the pncompc and 7 were vaccinated with the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( pncps ) as a booster .
the control group of 55 children received a hepatitis b vaccine at the same ages .
salivary anti - pnc igg , iga , iga1 , and iga2 antibodies to serotypes 6b , 14 , 19f , and 23f were measured in both groups at the age of 7 and 13 months .
results salivary anti - pnc igg and iga were detected more often in the pncompc than in the control group .
however , the difference between groups was significant only for 19f and 23f iga concentrations at the age of 7 months .
at the age of 13 months , antibody concentrations did not differ between pncompc and control groups .
the rises in iga concentrations between 7 and 13 months of age were mainly of subclass iga1 .
further , there is a clear trend that pncps booster induces higher salivary anti - pnc ps antibody concentrations than the pncompc .
conclusion we found that pncompc can induce a mucosal iga response .
however , the actual impact of mucosal antibodies in protection against pneumococcal infections is not clear .
background streptococcus pneumoniae ( pnc ) frequently colonises mucosal epithelium at nasopharynx without causing any symptoms [ 1 ] .
the carriage rate varies depending on the age , being highest in children under two years of age [ 2 ] .
further , the prevalence of pneumococcal carriage is higher in developing than developed countries [ 3 ] .
although the pneumococcal carriage is often harmless , it may lead to a local disease , e.g. to acute otitis media ( aom ) , sinusitis or to an invasive disease like pneumonia , meningitis or sepsis [ 3 ] .
the main mechanism of defence against pneumococcus are anticapsular antibodies , which help in the phagocytosis or which can counteract acquisition of pneumococcus probably by preventing adhesion to the mucosal surface [ 4 ] .
in serum the predominant immunoglobulin class is igg .
the salivary igg is mainly derived from serum by leakage across capillaries and entering saliva through gingival crevices .
however , some local production of igg may take place [ 5,6 ] .
at mucosal membranes iga is the main immunoglobulin class and it is found most often in the secretory form ( siga ) .
the role of serum igg in the defence against pneumococcus is obvious ; igg can activate complement efficiently and further lead to phagocytosis of bacteria .
the function of mucosal antibodies in humans is less clear .
however , there are several pieces of evidence , which suggest that they do have a role in the defence .
the presence of pneumococcus in nasopharynx induces salivary antibodies against pneumococcal proteins and polysaccharides already in infants [ 7,8 ] , and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines evoke mucosal immune response [ 5,9 - 15 ] .
in addition to invasive disease and pneumonia , pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prevent also local infections like aom and carriage [ 16 - 22 ] .
further , in an animal model mucosal antibodies prevented the acquisition of pneumococcus [ 23 ] .
at the moment there is only one licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine , pnccrm .
the vaccine contains seven pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides ( ps ) conjugated to a non - toxic variant form of diphtheria toxin ( crm197 ) .
the kaiser permanente efficacy trial in the usa showed that pnccrm is highly protective , 97.4 % ( 95 % ci 88.7 to 99.9 %) , against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes [ 16 ] .
among american indian children , which are a high risk population for pneumococcal infection , the intention - to - treat total primary efficacy of pnccrm against invasive disease was 82.6 % ( 95 % ci 21.4 to 96.1 %) [ 24 ] .
the efficacy of a 9 - valent pnccrm in hiv - infected and uninfected children has been studied in soweto , south - africa [ 25 ] .
the vaccine prevented there 83 % ( 95 % ci 39 - 97 %) of invasive pneumococcal infections due to vaccine serotypes in hiv - uninfected children .
the respective number was 65 % ( 95 % ci 24 - 86 %) in hiv - infected children .
in the finnish otitis media ( finom ) vaccine trial , two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines , pnccrm and pncompc , were investigated in parallel regarding the efficacy against aom using hepatitis b vaccine ( hbv ) as a control for both arms .
the efficacy of the pnccrm vaccine was 57 % ( 95 % ci 44 to 67 %) [ 19 ] and of the pncompc vaccine 56 % ( 95 % ci 44 to 66 %) [ 22 ] against aom caused by the vaccine serotypes .
in the setting of the finom vaccine trial we have had a possibility to evaluate both the serum [ 19,22 ] and mucosal immunity [ 10 ] as surrogates of vaccine efficacy [ 26 ] .
the aim of this study was to measure the mucosal antibody responses after vaccination with 3 or 4 doses of either the pncompc or the control vaccine .
measurement of anti - pnc antibodies against serotypes 6b , 14 , 19f and 23f were selected because these types were most commonly associated with aom in the finom studies [ 10,19,27 ] .
we compared the prevalence and concentrations of salivary antibodies at 7 and 13 months of age in the pncompc and control group .
we also explored the effect of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( pncps ) as a booster .
the data on salivary antibody in the pnccrm group has been reported separately [ 10 ] .
methods vaccines , vaccinees and vaccinations pncompc ( merck & co. , inc. , west point , pa ) is a heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine containing 5 mug of capsular ps of the serotype 6b , 3 mug of type 23f , 2 mug of types 18c and 19f , 1.5 mug of type 9v , and 1 mug of types 4 and 14 each conjugated individually to an outer membrane protein complex ( ompc ) of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b. aluminium was used as an adjuvant and thiomersal as a preservative .
pneumovax ( r ) ( merck & co. , inc. ) is a 23 - valent pneumococcal ps vaccine ( pncps ) , containing 25 mug of each capsular ps. hbv ( recombivax ( tm ) merck & co. , inc. ) was used as a control vaccine .
one dose of hbv vaccine contains 5 mug of hepatitis b surface antigen .
the design of the finom vaccine trial has been described previously [ 19,22 ] .
in this study we had a subcohort of 111 infants .
56 children were randomised to receive the pncompc vaccine at the age of 2 , 4 , and 6 months .
at 12 months of age , 49 of them were vaccinated with the pncompc and 7 with the pncps as a booster vaccine .
the control group of 55 children received hbv at the same ages .
additionally , the children received a combined diphtheria - tetanus - whole cell pertussis and haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine ( tetramune ( r ) , wyeth pharmaceuticals ) at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 24 months , inactivated polio vaccine ( imovax ( r ) , aventis pasteur ) at 7 , 12 , and 24 months and measles - mumps - rubella ( mmr ( r ) ii , merck & co. , inc. ) at 18 months of age .
sampling unstimulated saliva samples were taken at the age of 7 ( n = 111 ) and 13 ( n = 107 ) months .
mothers were advised not to breast feed infants during one hour before saliva sampling .
up to 2 ml of saliva was collected with a gentle aspiration using electronic suction device and samples were immediately frozen at - 70degreesc .
before analysis the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes with 15 000 rpm and the supernatant was used for analyses of anti - pnc ps antibodies .
the saliva samples were thawed only once .
the volume of the sample was not always sufficient for all analyses .
measurement of antibodies enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) for saliva samples iga , iga1 , iga2 , and igg antibodies to serotypes 6b , 14 , 19f and 23f were measured by eia as described previously [ 5,10,11,14 ] .
before calculation of concentrations , optical density ( od ) readings from the pbs wells were subtracted from the antigen plates .
for iga and igg results od values of >= 0.05 (>= 2 standard deviations of the blank ) were regarded as positive .
the concentrations of iga and igg were calculated in nanograms per millilitre ( ng / ml ) of saliva by using the 89 - sf serum as a reference .
the detection limit was 5 ng / ml for both iga and igg assays and for all serotypes .
samples with undetectable iga and igg were assigned a value 1.7 ng / ml ; half a log less than the detection limit .
the iga1 and iga2 results are presented as eia units / ml calculated using 89 - sf as a reference with a given calibration factor [ 28 ] .
the detection limit of iga1 and iga2 assays for all the serotypes was 1.3 units / ml ; and samples with undetectable iga1 and iga2 concentrations were given a value 0.65 units / ml. statistical methods results are given as geometric mean antibody concentrations ( gmc ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) .
differences in antibody concentrations in saliva samples between different ages were analysed with wilcoxon signed ranks test .
kruskal - wallis test was used to compare differences between pncopmc and hbv groups .
proportions of children having anti - pnc antibodies in saliva were compared with yates - corrected chi square test ( chi2 - test ) or with fisher 's two - tailed exact test .
differences were considered significant when p - value was < 0.05 .
the sample size was not specifically determined for this study .
results anti - pneumococcal igg in saliva anti - pnc ps igg was detected at the age of both 7 and 13 months very rarely , and there were no differences either in the proportion of positive samples or concentration between the pncompc and control groups except for serotype 14 at 13 months ; there were more anti - pnc ps igg positive samples in the pncompc than in the control group ( table 1 ) .

a small group of 7 children received pncps vaccine as a booster instead of pncompc at the age of 12 months .
further , the volume of saliva was not sufficient for all the eia analyses .
however , there was a clear trend that the pncps boosting induced more often igg to the saliva than the pncompc boosting ( table 1 ) .
anti - pneumococcal iga in saliva at the age of 7 months , anti - pnc ps iga was detected more often and the concentrations were higher in the pncompc than in the control group for all four serotypes ( table 2 , fig 1 ) .
however , the difference was statistically significant only for serotypes 19f ( both the number of positive samples and concentration ) and 23f ( concentration ) .
the geometric mean concentrations ( gmcs ) varied between 2.3 and 5.7 ng / ml , and 1.9 and 3.1 ng / ml in the pncompc and control groups , respectively ( fig 1 ) .

figure 1 salivary anti - pnc ps iga concentrations ( ng / ml ) with 95 % confidence intervals in the pncompc , pncompc + pncps booster and control groups at the age of 7 and 13 months .
at the age of 13 months , there were no statistical differences between the pncompc and the control group either in the proportion of positive samples or in the anti - pnc ps iga concentrations ( table 2 , fig 1 ) .
after the booster , the gmcs ranged between 3.7 and 11.2 ng / ml , and 3.0 and 8.0 ng / ml in the pncompc and control group , respectively .
however , there was a statistical difference between 7 and 13 months of age in the anti - pnc ps iga concentrations for serotype 23f in the pnccrm group and for serotypes 6b , 19f and 23f in the hbv group .
pncps booster induced higher anti - pnc ps iga concentrations than the pncompc ( table 2 , fig 1 ) .
however , the small number of samples in the pncps group did not allow any statistical analyses .
iga1 and iga2 subclasses at the age of 7 months , iga1 concentrations were mirroring the total anti - pnc serotype specific iga ( fig 1 ) and were significantly higher in the pncompc than in the control group for serotypes 6b , 19f , and 23f .
however , at the age of 13 months , there were no statistical differences between the groups .
the iga2 concentrations did not differ between the groups either at the age of 7 or 13 months .
thus , rises in the antibody concentrations were seen only for iga1 ( fig 2 ) .
figure 2 salivary anti - pnc ps iga1 and iga2 concentrations ( eia units / ml ) with 95 % confidence intervals in the pncompc , pncompc + pncps booster and control groups at the age of 7 and 13 months .
discussion salivary anti - pnc polysaccharide antibodies , both igg and iga , were detected only slightly more often in the pncompc than in the control group .
however , the proportion of positive samples and the antibody concentrations rose between 7 and 13 months of age in both groups and the differences between the vaccine groups diminished .
this suggests that children in both groups had pneumococcal contacts which induced development of mucosal antibodies .
this is in accordance with the findings that pneumococcal carriage induces salivary antibodies in children [ 7 ] , also regardless of the previous pneumococcal vaccination status [ 29 ] .
in addition to iga , we measured also iga subclass specific antibody development .
iga1 is the predominant subclass both in serum and saliva , iga1 : iga2 ratios being roughly 9:1 in serum and 6:4 in saliva [ 30 ] .
to improve their virulence , some bacteria including pneumococcus have developed proteases , which degrade iga1 antibodies [ 31 ] .
recently , iga1 - proteases have been found to be important in the adherence of pneumococcus [ 32 ] .
due to methodological reasons the iga1 and iga2 concentrations detected in this study can not be compared as the data are given in eia units that are not comparable .
however , we found that the changes and the difference in the iga concentrations were mainly due to changes in the iga1 concentrations .
this is in accordance with our previous findings [ 11,33 ] .
this suggests that both iga1 and iga2 are present , but the vaccine induces iga1 , which , unfortunately , is susceptible to iga proteases .
we have also reported the mucosal anti - pnc ps antibodies in the pnccrm arm of the finom vaccine trial [ 10 ] .
though the pnccrm induced more often and higher concentrations of salivary anti - pnc ps antibodies than the pncompc vaccine ( all the samples were analysed together at the same time ) , the basic message from the two studies is the same .
the data of this study and of the pnccrm arm [ 10 ] suggest that parenteral immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines induce local iga1 antibody formation , but the antibodies persist only for a short period .
the concentrations of anti - pnc ps iga at 13 months and in the pnccrm arm also at 4 to 5 years of age were very similar in the pneumococcal vaccine and in the control vaccine groups indicating that no remarkable natural boosting of the vaccine - induced antibodies occurred [ 10 ] .
igg anti - pnc ps antibodies were detected only rarely .
the highest prevalence was found in the small group of children whose 4th pneumococcal vaccine dose at 12 months was pncps vaccine .
this is in accordance with the serum antibody concentrations that were significantly higher in the pncps - boosted than in the pncompc - boosted children for all other serotypes except 23f [ 34 ] .
pneumococcal ps vaccine has been suggested to be used as a booster after a primary series with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine .
it is cheaper than the conjugate vaccine available and induces higher serum antibody concentrations than a conjugate booster [ 14,22,34 ] .
however , a conjugate vaccine as a booster can be favourable for the persistence and quality of antibodies , because it stimulates the formation of high - affinity clones of memory b - cells [ 35 ] .
there is also a possibility that ps booster may cause depletion of memory cells [ 36 ] .
further , no significant differences in the efficacy against aom and recurrent aom have been found between ps and conjugate booster [ 22,37 ] .
we found in this study , that there is a clear trend that the ps vaccine as a booster induces mucosal anti - pneumococcal antibodies more often and in higher concentration than conjugate booster .
the same effect of a polysaccharide booster in salivary antibody concentrations have been seen also previously [ 9,14 ] .
however , there may be differences in the quality of salivary antibodies induced by the ps or conjugate vaccines .
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been found to induce both humoral and mucosal immunity .
further , the vaccines have been found effective against invasive and local pneumococcal infections .
however , the antibody concentrations or quality of antibodies needed for protection against disease and carriage are not known , even if there has been a lot of discussion about the protective levels [ 38,39 ] .
recently , a consensus about the estimate of serological surrogate of protection against invasive pneumococcal infections has been achieved .
it is suggested that the 0.35 mug / ml concentration of anti - pnc ps igg in serum would predict the protection against pneumococcal infection at the population level . however , the value is a rough estimate and further , the function of antibodies , both opsonophagocytic activity and avidity , and immunological memory are also essential issues in serological immunity .
in addition to the concentration and function of anti - pneumococcal antibodies in serum , the importance and function of mucosal anti - pneumococcal antibodies should be clarified .
in the finom vaccine trial the pnccrm induced more salivary antibodies than the pncompc , but the efficacy of these vaccines against aom was similar .
this raises a question , which is the actual mechanism of protection ?
anyway , we know that pneumococcal carriage , infections and conjugate vaccines all induce mucosal antibodies .
but we do not know how important mucosal antibodies really are in the defence against pneumococcal infections compared with the antibodies in serum , and if mucosal immunisation would provide better local immune response .
conclusion we found that pncompc can induce a salivary iga response .
however , the actual impact of mucosal antibodies in protection against pneumococcal infections is not clear .

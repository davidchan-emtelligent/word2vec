background rat bite fever is a relatively rare infectious disease due to infection with streptobacillus moniliformis or spirillum minus mainly via directs bite by rats , mice , or other rodents .
if there is no clear bite history , the diagnosis is difficult or may not be made .
case presentation a 72 - year - old asian female with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted for high grade fever and walking difficulty with severe lumbago .
initially , we suspected lumber compression fracture with deterioration of rheumatoid arthritis , but gram - negative bacilli were isolated from blood culture during hospitalization .
the isolated organism was identified as s. moniliformis by 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( rrna ) sequencing. s. moniliformis is well known to be a primary causative organism of rat bite fever , but this patient had no history of rat bite .
had s. moniliformis bacteremia not been detected , she might have been treated for rheumatic exacerbation .
conclusion we emphasize the importance of performing appropriate microbial culture testing for identifying potential infectious diseases .
we also conclude that s. moniliformis infection can become established with contaminated vehicle contact alone , not only as a direct result of a bite .
we must keep mind that those working in places where rodents breed or are at risk of contact with rats or mice might be at risk for contracting this unusual disease .

keywords streptobacillus moniliformis bacteremia rheumatoid arthritis rat bite zoonosis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background rat bite fever is a relatively rare infectious disease due to either streptobacillus moniliformis or spirillum minus [ 1 - 5 ] .
it presents as an acute or chronic illness with polyarthritis in states such as sepsis and bacteremia [ 4 ] .
rat bite fever occurs due to a direct bite by an infected and / or colonized rat , mouse , or other rodent or via intake of contaminated food or milk [ 4 ] .
most cases have a history of bites or contact with rodents , but the diagnosis in those without such a history must be based on microbiologic testing .
we herewith describe an interesting case of s. moniliformis bacteremia without rat bite .
this patient had rheumatoid arthritis .
inexplicable joint and bone symptoms closely mimicked those of s. moniliformis bacteremia .
the diagnosis would thus have been very difficult unless microbial culture tests had revealed the isolate to be s. moniliformis .
case report a 72 - year - old asian female presented with high grade fever , 38 degreesc , and chills which had been present for 8 days prior to admission .
she had been followed for rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) by the orthopedics department of our hospital for 3 years .
at the first visit for febrile episodes , upper respiratory tract infection was diagnosed and she was told to rest and stay in bed .
she went home without antipyretics , analgesics or antibiotics .
however , she reported worsening lower back pain 3 days after the first visit .
subsequently , she was admitted due to difficulty moving , especially walking , because of severe lower back pain .
furthermore , the presence of a severe inflammatory disease , such as an infection , was suspected based on blood examination results on admission ( table 1 ) .
table 1 laboratory data on admission blood cell counts white blood cells 13,300 / mul neutrophils 95.0 % lymphocytes 2.3 % red blood cells 367 x 104 / mul hemoglobin 12.2 g / dl platelets 31.1 x 104 / mul biochemical parameters aspartate aminotransaminase 45 iu / l alanine aminotransferase 34 iu / l lactose dehydrogenase 202 iu / l alkaline phosphatase 1035 iu / l gamma - glutamyl transferase 239 iu / l sodium 136 meq / l potassium 4.5 meq / l chloride 100 meq / l blood urea nitrogen 29.9 mg / dl creatinine 1.09 mg / dl total protein 6.0 g / dl albumin 2.4 g / dl serology c reactive protein 26.92 mg / dl her medical history was unremarkable except for hypertension and ra , reasonably well controlled with low - dose oral steroids and weekly methotrexate .
her familial history was also unremarkable .
she neither smoked nor drank alcohol regularly and had no history of caring for animals .
moreover , she had no history of allergies to drugs , foods , or inhaled substances .
she ran a dining room in downtown tokyo .
she had undergone dental implant insertions , but had been free of dental caries and periodontal disease for several years .
at the beginning of hospitalization , she was unable to walk because of severe sharp pain , affecting the entire body , including lower back pain which been present prior to admission .
she was unable to state definitely where in her body the pain was strongest .
she was started on antibiotics ( cefazolin 2.0 g / every 8 h ) and a nonsteroidal antiphlogistic balm for the pain .
her condition subsequently improved with resolution of the high grade fever spikes , but a low grade fever persisted .
on the 2nd hospital day , highly pleomorphic , filamentous gram - negative bacilli were isolated from anaerobic blood culture of the clinical sample obtained on the day of admission ( fig. 1a ) .
isolates grew on both brucella with hemin and vitamin k1 ( hk ) agar ( kyokuto pharmaceutical industrial co. , ltd. , tokyo , japan ) and 5 % sheep blood agar ( eiken chemical co. , ltd. , tokyo , japan ) under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .
those samples could be subcultured at 37 degreesc on 5 % sheep blood agar plates ( eiken chemical co. , ltd. ) in a capnophilic atmosphere containing 5 % co2 ( fig. 1b , c ) according to previous reports [ 6 , 7 ] .
we obtained a colony approximately 1 mm in diameter in 3 days using these media .
though the isolate was not identified by biological techniques , we accurately identified the strain with 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid ( rrna ) genotyping , as previously described [ 8 , 9 ] , and a similarity search was conducted using the eztaxon ( http :// www.ezbiocloud.net / eztaxon /) .
the isolate ( genbank accession no. lc062896 ) showed 100 % ( 1455 / 1455 ) similarity to the streptobacillus moniliformis type strain dsm 12112t ( genbank accession no. cp001779 ) .
a phylogenetic tree containing all available 16s rrna sequences was constructed from a multiple sequence alignment with the neighbor - joining method using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis ( mega ) software , version 5.1 ( additional file 1 : figure ) .
we performed antimicrobial susceptibility tests on the isolate employing both the microdilution method using microscan ( r ) negacombo 3.12 j ( siemens inc .
berlin , germany ) and using lysed horse blood broth with microdilution , but we were unable to measure minimum inhibitory concentrations against several antibiotics , because there was no growth of the isolate even in the control well .
thus , though we switched the administered antibiotic to sulbactum / ampicillin ( 3.0 g / every 6 h ) on the 2nd hospital day based on interim report of blood culture test , we had initially administered ampicillin ( 2.0 g / every 6 h ) based on previous reports describing antimicrobial susceptibilities of similar isolates [ 2 , 10 ]. fig. 1 microscopic images with gram - staining ( a ) .
highly pleomorphic , filamentous gram - negative bacilli can be seen in 2 - day aerobic culture with 5 % co2 on 5 % sheep blood agar .
colonies are very tiny , transparent and slightly white ( b ) .
high - power views of the colonies ( c ) though overall status including the fever showed improvement with antibiotic administration , the lower back pain persisted .
she thus underwent magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the lumbar vertebrae .
the mri at the levels of the 3rd and 4th lumbar vertebrae showed a low signal on t1 - weighted images ( fig. 2a ) , whereas signal intensity was high within the intranuclear cleft of the disk on short t1 inversion recovery ( stir ) t2 imaging and disc extrusion with a high water content was observed adjacent to the extra - dural area ( fig. 2b ) .
the vertebral endplates at this level were destroyed and high - signal - intensity bone marrow edema was visible .
these findings are typical of pyogenic vertebral spondylodiscitis , but there were no signs of crush injury or transformation in the lesion .
we continued the antibiotic administration and confirmed gradual improvement of her lower back pain .
furthermore , exercise capacity , including walking , gradually recovered .
follow - up mri studies showed no deterioration of the lumbar lesions , and she was discharged on the 71st hospital day. fig. 2 magnetic resonance image of lumbar vertebrae obtained on the 10th hospital day .
t1 - weighted image ( t1wi ) and short t1 inversion recovery ( stir ) t2 image ( a , b ) , respectively .
the lumbar sequence is linearized and the findings do not suggest a compression fracture , i.e. there is no dip - related transformation of the vertebral body .
vertebral bodies l3 and l4 have a low signal on t1wi and a high signal on stir .
the intervertebral disk is low and has a linear t2 high signal .
we thus suspected this lesion to represent inflammation and / or degeneration discussion rat bite fever has been a recognized zoonosis since ancient times in india , more than 2000 years ago .
however , unexpectedly , this disease was reported again in the medical literature more recently .
in 1840 , wilcox reported rat bite fever for the first time [ 11 ] .
at the end of the 19th century , miyake provided the first detailed description in the german literature [ 12 ] .
in this report , he presented this disease as a definite clinical entity based on a series of 11 cases in his own experiences and prior references in the japanese literature describing sodoku , which means rat poisoning in japanese .
streptobacillus moniliformis , present in some rodent intraoral resident floras , is an aerobic or facultative anaerobic gram - negative , highly pleomorphic , filamentous , nonmotile , and non - acid - fast rod [ 2 ]. s. moniliformis , as well as spirillum minus , transmitted by bite wounds and scratches from rodents such as mice , can cause systemic rat bite fever .
this condition is due to infection by s. moniliformis or , less commonly , by s. minus .
disease caused by s. minus is generally known as sodoku and occurs primarily in asia [ 2 ] .
after the incubation period of 2 - 10 days , symptoms progress to high fever , arthralgia of multiple joints , muscle ache , and whole body rash [ 1 , 13 - 16 ] .
in previous reports , arthritis occurred mainly in large joints including the elbows , knees and mid - back , while rashes of the palms or soles and were erythematous [ 3 , 13 , 14 , 16 - 19 ] .
such skin lesions were occasionally accompanied by abscess formation [ 2 ] .
on the other hand , s. moniliformis was reported to be a causative pathogen of infectious endocarditis [ 1 , 20 - 24 ] or to be associated with immunocompromised status including human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection and hematological malignancies [ 24 - 26 ] .
furthermore , there are reports describing occurrence in patients with bacteremia associated with exposure [ 27 , 28 ] , such as working in laboratories [ 29 , 30 ] .
in the present case , fortunately , we were able to identify the causative organism from blood cultures .
thus , we provided appropriate treatment and were able to discharge the patient .
an important point is whether she had suffered a rodent bite , but no such bite episode was revealed , despite a detailed interview .
there are actually " unusual " case reports without a bite history [ 31 ] or febrile episode [ 5 ] .
however , despite the lack of a clear bite history , we suspected s. moniliformis infection based on other aspects of the patient 's presentation .
she ran a dining room serving tonkatsu , a japanese dish which consists of a breaded , deep - fried pork cutlet , in akihabara , an area of downtown tokyo , and she had once seen a rat in the dining room kitchen .
we considered the possibility of contracting the infection solely by contact with contaminated water and / or food .
in a previous report , an outbreak of s. moniliformis blood stream infections occurred in a boarding school and the authors concluded the vehicle of infection to be rats contaminating the water supply [ 32 ] .
indeed , s. moniliformis infection is caused not only directly by rodent bites but also via contaminated water .
as for major changes in the global environment , such as deforestation and clearing for farmland as well as global climate change due to the greenhouse effect caused by the rise in carbon dioxide concentration , the risk of zoonoses will increase worldwide .
however , epidemiological analysis will be difficult even if zoonosis increases , because accurate diagnosis of this disease is often difficult .
the anticoagulant included in the commercial blood culture bottle reportedly inhibits the growth of s. moniliformis , and there are numerous cases lacking an accurate diagnosis [ 14 , 33 , 34 ] .
in cases with a bite history , rat bite fever is really suspected , but in those without a bite history , the diagnosis must always be based on microbiological testing alone .
an accurate diagnosis cannot be obtained without an isolate .
a culture test and the improvement of the device for detecting s. moniliformis are highly anticipated .
conclusions we conclude that s. moniliformis infection can become established with contaminated vehicle contact alone , not only as a direct result of a bite .
those working in places where rodents breed or are at risk of contact with rats or mice might be at risk for contracting this unusual disease .
the cultural diversification of large urban centers is becoming increasingly complex .
thus , we must keep in mind the possibility of zoonosis .
consent written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images .

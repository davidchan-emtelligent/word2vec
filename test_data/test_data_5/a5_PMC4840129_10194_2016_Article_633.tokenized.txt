background cluster headache ( ch ) is a debilitating condition that is generally associated with substantial health care costs .
few therapies are approved for abortive or prophylactic treatment .
results from the prospective , randomised , open - label preva study suggested that adjunctive treatment with a novel non - invasive vagus nerve stimulation ( nvns ) device led to decreased attack frequency and abortive medication use in patients with chronic ch ( cch ) .
herein , we evaluate whether nvns is cost - effective compared with the current standard of care ( soc ) for cch .
methods a pharmacoeconomic model from the german statutory health insurance perspective was developed to estimate the 1 - year cost - effectiveness of nvns + soc ( versus soc alone ) using data from preva .
short - term treatment response data were taken from the clinical trial ; longer - term response was modelled under scenarios of response maintenance , constant rate of response loss , and diminishing rate of response loss .
health - related quality of life was estimated by modelling eq - 5d ( tm ) data from preva ; benefits were defined as quality - adjusted life - years ( qaly ) .
abortive medication use data from preva , along with costs for the nvns device and abortive therapies ( i.e. intranasal zolmitriptan , subcutaneous sumatriptan , and inhaled oxygen ) , were used to assess health care costs in the german setting .
results the analysis resulted in mean expected yearly costs of euro7096.69 for nvns + soc and euro7511.35 for soc alone and mean qaly of 0.607 for nvns + soc and 0.522 for soc alone , suggesting that nvns generates greater health benefits for lower overall cost .
abortive medication costs were 23 % lower with nvns + soc than with soc alone .
in the alternative scenarios ( i.e. constant rate of response loss and diminishing rate of response loss ) , nvns + soc was more effective and cost saving than soc alone .
conclusions in all scenarios modelled from a german perspective , nvns was cost - effective compared with current soc , which suggests that adjunctive nvns therapy provides economic benefits in the treatment of cch .
notably , the current analysis included only costs associated with abortive treatments .
treatment with nvns will likely promote further economic benefit when other potential sources of cost savings ( e.g. reduced frequency of clinic visits ) are considered .

keywords chronic cluster headache vagus nerve stimulation non - invasive cost - effectiveness germany pharmacoeconomics united kingdom electrocore , llcnaissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background cluster headache ( ch ) is a debilitating condition associated with intense pain and cranial autonomic symptoms , which cause marked disability [ 1 ] .
the disorder adversely affects quality of life [ 2 ] and is associated with substantial health care costs ( more than euro11,000 per year ) [ 3 ] .
the condition can be chronic or episodic .
both direct costs ( e.g. medication , clinic visits ) and indirect costs ( e.g. reduced work capacity ) have been found to be substantially higher for patients with chronic ch ( cch ) than for those with episodic ch [ 3 ] .
few drugs ( e.g. subcutaneous [ sc ] sumatriptan , intranasal [ in ] zolmitriptan , and dihydroergotamine [ dhe ] injection ) are approved by various regulatory agencies for abortive treatment [ 4 , 5 ] .
lithium is approved for ch prophylaxis in germany [ 6 ] and is used off - label in other areas .
other agents such as verapamil and topiramate are also used off - label despite a lack of rigorous , well - controlled studies to support their use in the prevention of ch attacks [ 7 - 9 ] .
although short - term methylprednisone therapy may be effective in ch prophylaxis , several safety concerns preclude its long - term use [ 8 ] .
vagus nerve stimulation ( vns ) is a neuromodulatory technique that is well established for epilepsy and depression and has been applied to a variety of other disorders including alzheimer disease , migraine , and ch [ 10 - 12 ] .
it is thought to suppress pain through inhibition of vagal afferents in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis ( tnc ) [ 13 ] and by blocking or reversing increases in tnc glutamate levels [ 14 ] ; vns has also been implicated in modulation of the cholinergic anti - inflammatory pathway [ 15 - 17 ] .
in an initial open - label study ( n = 19 ) , non - invasive vagus nerve stimulation ( nvns ) was found to be effective in the prevention and treatment of ch [ 11 ] .
subsequently , a larger ( n = 97 ) , prospective , open - label , randomised study ( preva [ 18 ]) evaluated the safety and efficacy of adjunctive treatment with a novel nvns device ( gammacore ( r )) in patients with cch .
in the preva trial , compared with standard of care ( soc ) alone , adjunctive nvns ( nvns + soc ) was associated with significantly greater decreases from baseline in the number of ch attacks per week and the use of abortive medications .
compared with soc alone , nvns + soc was also associated with a significantly higher response rate ( i.e. the proportion of participants with a >= 50 % reduction from baseline in the number of ch attacks per week ; 40 % for nvns + soc vs 8.3 % for soc alone , p < 0.001 ) and significantly greater improvements from baseline in quality - of - life measures , with no serious treatment - related adverse events .
the present analysis was undertaken to quantify the economic impact of nvns therapy in patients with cch. by developing a pharmacoeconomic model and applying it to data from the preva study , we evaluated whether nvns is a cost - effective treatment option compared with the current standard practice in a european setting .
analysis using german costs is the focus of this paper because germans represented the largest proportion of preva participants .
to corroborate our findings and widen their applicability , we conducted a similar analysis using uk costs , which is briefly described in the discussion section .
methods study design the principal data source for this analysis was the preva study ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01701245 ) , which compared the effectiveness of nvns added to soc with that of soc alone as prophylactic therapy for cch .
for each participant , soc was individualised and typically included prophylactic medications ( e.g. verapamil , lithium ) and abortive agents ( e.g. inhaled oxygen , triptans ) .
the study design ( fig. 1 ) and methodology of preva have been described in detail previously [ 18 ] .
the preva study was conducted in accordance with the principles and requirements of the declaration of helsinki , good clinical practices , and clinical trial registration .
all preva investigators obtained institutional review board approval , and all preva participants provided written informed consent. fig. 1 preva study [ 18 ] design .
abbreviations : nvns non - invasive vagus nerve stimulation , soc standard of care model structure and parameter estimates figure 2 depicts the 1 - year model that was used to estimate the cost - effectiveness of adjunctive nvns therapy from the german statutory health insurance perspective .
model parameter estimates were derived from data on the efficacy of nvns and the use of abortive medications from the randomised phase of preva .
treatment response was defined as >= 50 % reduction from baseline in the number of ch attacks per week .
beyond the randomised phase , responders in the soc group were assumed to be non - responders , and non - responders in the nvns + soc group were assumed to discontinue prophylactic treatment with nvns but continue use of abortive treatments .
four late responders in the nvns + soc group ( i.e. patients who were not classified as responders during the randomised phase but responded during the extension phase ) were included as responders in the base case .
an alternative scenario in which the 4 late responders were classified as non - responders was also modelled in a sensitivity analysis. fig. 2 pharmacoeconomic model structure .
response was defined as a >= 50 % reduction from baseline in the number of ch attacks during the randomised period ( or during month 2 in the case of 4 late responders ) .
responders in the soc group were modelled as non - responders beyond the randomised phase .
probability of response was modelled for the base case ( response maintained ) and for the following alternative scenarios : 1 ) constant rate of response loss , 2 ) diminishing rate of response loss , and 3 ) no initial response in the soc group .
abbreviations : ch cluster headache ; soc standard of care to estimate the probability of response in the base case analysis , subjects from the nvns + soc group who were responders throughout the extension phase were assumed to maintain this response until the end of the model time horizon ( 1 year ) .
in addition to the base case analysis , 3 alternative scenarios were explored .
an exponential survival curve function was fitted to data from patients in the nvns + soc group on the basis of their response statuses at the end of the randomised phase and at the end of the extension phase .
in the first alternative scenario , the exponential function was used to predict patient response status beyond 4 weeks ( i.e. beyond the randomised phase ) assuming a constant monthly rate (~ 31 %) of response loss throughout the course of the model .
the second scenario was modelled assuming a diminishing rate of response loss ; that is , the rate at which response was lost beyond 4 weeks ( as predicted by the exponential function ) was reduced by a fixed percentage ( 10 %) each month .
in the final scenario , no patients in the soc - alone group were assumed to have responded initially , and all other assumptions were the same as in the base case .
benefits in this analysis were defined as quality - adjusted life - years ( qaly ) .
health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) for responders and non - responders was estimated by modelling eq - 5d ( tm ) index data from preva in an ordinary least squares regression analysis to control for potential imbalances at baseline between treatment arms .
results from the regression analysis suggested that response was associated with an increase of 0.2366 in eq - 5d index score and that nvns therapy ( regardless of response ) was associated with an increase of 0.01246 in eq - 5d index score .
using the german tariff , hrqol utility scores were estimated for responders and non - responders and applied to the model states ( the uk tariff was applied for the uk analysis ) .
data on abortive medication use from the last 14 days of the preva randomised phase ( table 1 ) were used to assess health care resource utilisation .
patients in the nvns + soc group who maintained responder status were assumed to continue using the same amount of resources as those observed in the overall nvns + soc group during the randomised phase .
non - responders were assumed to have the same resource use as that observed in the soc group during the randomised phase .
unit costs for nvns , triptans , and inhaled oxygen are shown in table 2 .
the nvns use cost was the listed price in germany , and unit costs for in zolmitriptan and sc sumatriptan were determined from the lauer - taxe ( r ) [ 19 ] .
costs for inhaled oxygen were derived using the estimated daily cost for oxygen from a previous study [ 3 ] and data from the baseline phase of preva .

price for oxygen was estimated using daily cost from gaul et al [ 3 ] all economic models are associated with uncertainty ; we used a conventional method to reflect this in the analysis by developing a probabilistic model using a markov chain monte carlo simulation to quantify how parameter uncertainty affects model results ( i.e. the cost - effectiveness estimates for nvns + soc ) [ 20 , 21 ] ( table 3 ) .
distributions for each model parameter of interest were estimated in line with best practice .
a probabilistic analysis with 1000 simulations for each scenario was conducted , and mean values from this analysis were calculated .
each simulation was plotted on the cost - effectiveness plane to show the spread of results .

thus , nvns + soc appears to generate greater health benefits for lower overall cost ( table 4 ) .
approximately 80 % of the probabilistic simulations resulted in cost savings for nvns + soc ( versus soc alone ) , and the vast majority of the simulations plotted fell below the commonly used euro20,000 / qaly gained threshold ( i.e. the amount that commissioners of health care services are willing to pay per additional unit of health with new technologies ) ( fig. 3 ) [ 22 - 24 ] .
overall abortive medication costs were 23 % lower in the nvns + soc group than in the soc - alone group ( fig. 4 ) .
compared with the soc - alone group , the nvns + soc group had 29 % lower sc sumatriptan costs , 19 % lower inhaled oxygen costs , and 75 % higher in zolmitriptan costs .

in the alternative scenarios explored , the percentages of the probabilistic simulations that resulted in cost savings for nvns + soc ( versus soc alone ) were ~ 71 % for constant rate of response loss and ~ 79 % for both diminishing rate of response loss and no response for soc .
results from the sensitivity analysis suggest that exclusion of the 4 late responders to nvns ( i.e. designating them as non - responders in the model ) had a modest impact on cost - effectiveness .
for all scenarios modelled in the sensitivity analysis , nvns + soc was more effective and cost saving ( table 6 ) .

for acute treatment , triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease [ 25 , 26 ] .
drug costs or restrictions on prescribing and / or coverage may further limit triptan accessibility for many patients [ 27 , 28 ] .
long - term frequent use of triptans , as may be needed for cch management , can in turn lead to the development of medication overuse headache [ 29 , 30 ] , which , although rare , has been reported in patients with ch [ 31 , 32 ] .
oxygen may delay rather than abort ch attacks in some patients and has portability limitations [ 25 , 26 ] , and dhe may be associated with fibrosis ( e.g. cardiac , pulmonary , pleural ) , ergotism , and chest tightness [ 26 , 33 ] .
for prophylactic treatment , verapamil has a high potential for drug interactions , and the large dosages required for ch treatment are associated with adverse cardiac events such as arrhythmias , as well as oedema [ 26 ] .
lithium requires progressive titration and frequent drug - level monitoring because of its narrow therapeutic window and the risk of toxicity [ 25 , 26 , 34 ] , and topiramate is often poorly tolerated owing to its cognitive side effects [ 26 ] .
thus , more practical and cost - effective treatment approaches for ch are needed .
results from the preva study [ 18 ] suggest that in addition to reducing the frequency of ch attacks , adjunctive nvns therapy may decrease the need for abortive medications and improve quality of life in patients with cch .
the current pharmacoeconomic analysis indicates that adjunctive nvns is likely to result in cost savings when compared with soc alone .
notably , the present analysis was conservative in that it included only the costs associated with use of abortive medications without accounting for other potential sources of cost savings ( e.g. reduced frequency of clinic visits , fewer hospitalisations , increased productivity ) .
currently , there are few good options for acute or prophylactic treatment of ch. neuromodulation methods such as sphenopalatine ganglion ( spg ) stimulation and occipital nerve stimulation ( ons ) have shown some promise in ch prevention , but most studies of these techniques have been small and / or have lacked control arms [ 35 , 36 ] .
furthermore , spg and ons are invasive , expensive , and associated with risks inherent with implanted devices ( e.g. infection , pain at the site of implantation , electrode migration ) .
the findings that nvns is effective in cch prophylaxis [ 18 ] , is not associated with risks that are inherent in invasive neuromodulation methods , and offers cost savings over the current standard practice suggest that this therapy warrants a prominent place in the management of cch .
the current analysis is subject to certain limitations .
the preva study provided data from an 8 - week period , which were extrapolated to assess cost - effectiveness over 1 year .
although there have been few cost - effectiveness evaluations of neuromodulatory techniques for the treatment of primary headache disorders , such studies have generally included time horizons of at least 3 years [ 37 - 39 ] .
considering the time frame of preva , a 1 - year time horizon was chosen for this analysis to preserve robustness and to avoid introducing unnecessary uncertainty .
as in patients with epilepsy [ 40 ] , evidence suggests that patients with headache may have improved response to vns with longer - term treatment [ 41 , 42 ] .
although increases in response rate with long - term vns have yet to be explored in ch , the current analysis could be viewed as conservative because the duration of preva may not have allowed demonstration of the full benefit of nvns .
recently , the national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) interventional procedures advisory committee noted that the relapsing / remitting nature of ch and migraines as well as the potential for placebo effects should be considered when interpreting evidence of treatment efficacy for these conditions [ 43 ] .
indeed , because periods of relapse and remission are common among patients with primary headache disorders , research in this area may be susceptible to regression artefacts [ 44 , 45 ] .
however , the preva study included data from patients with cch only. by international classification of headache disorders definition [ 46 ] , cch is not associated with extended periods of remission ( i.e. >= 1 month ) , suggesting that the phenomenon of regression to the mean ( e.g. aberrantly high attack frequency at baseline followed by a decrease in attack frequency regardless of treatment group ) would not be expected .
because the preva study lacked a sham treatment group , the degree to which the placebo effect might have contributed to the cost - effectiveness of nvns is unclear .
nevertheless , the clinically relevant design of the preva study was valuable in that it allowed for observation of medication use in a control group that likely reflects real - world use .
as with any probabilistic analysis , some degree of uncertainty is inherent in the current investigation .
to address this , a sensitivity analysis and a range of alternative scenarios were included , and results from all of these suggested that nvns + soc was more effective and cost saving than soc alone .
results were relatively insensitive to assumptions about late responders in the nvns + soc arm .
in the sensitivity analysis , where the 4 late - responding patients were classified as non - responders , nvns + soc was dominant over soc alone in all modelled scenarios .
the current analysis cannot be directly extrapolated across all of europe because it evaluates cost - effectiveness from a german health insurance perspective .
to explore the generalisability of our findings , we conducted the same analysis from a uk perspective and found similar results .
for the base case , the probabilistic analysis resulted in mean expected costs of pound5409.83 for nvns + soc and pound5393.31 for soc alone and mean qaly of 0.538 for nvns + soc and 0.438 for soc alone .
the incremental cost - effectiveness ratio of nvns + soc was pound166.12 , and 47 % of the probabilistic simulations resulted in cost savings for nvns + soc over soc alone ( j. morris , unpublished data , 2016 ) .
the degree to which these results can be generalised to other countries may vary depending on specific drug prices and the availability of generic medications in those markets .
lastly , the current cost - effectiveness projections included only the costs associated with the use of abortive treatments .
this suggests that our analysis is conservative , as data on additional health care resource use ( e.g. clinic visits ) would likely lead to a disproportionate cost increase for the soc - alone group .
likewise , potential health benefits from decreased use of abortive medications ( e.g. drug - related side effects ) and effects on indirect costs ( e.g. increased work capacity ) , which could further enhance the economic profile of nvns , were not considered herein .
the economic benefits of nvns could be established with greater certainty by incorporating additional cost components into future studies .
conclusions the current study provides evidence of the efficacy and economic benefits of nvns therapy for patients with cch in the context of the german and uk health care systems .
in all scenarios modelled , nvns was more cost - effective than the current standard practice .
these findings are especially meaningful given the substantial economic burden associated with ch [ 3 ] and considering that new technologies are cited as major drivers of increasing health care expenditures [ 47 , 48 ] .
our results suggest that new technologies such as nvns may help decrease overall treatment costs , information that likely will be important to clinicians , patients , and payers when treatment decisions are made .

background the role of urine markers in the surveillance of patients with non - muscle invasive bladder cancer ( nmibc ) is discussed extensively .
in case of negative cystoscopy the additional prognostic value of these markers has not been clearly defined yet .
the present study is the first systematic approach to directly compare the ability of a urine marker panel to predict the risk of recurrence and progression in bladder cancer ( bc ) patients with no evidence of relapse during surveillance for nmibc .
methods one hundred fourteen patients who underwent urine marker testing during surveillance for nmibc and who had no evidence of bc recurrence were included .
for all patients cytology , fluorescence - in - situ - hybridization ( fish ) , immunocytology ( ucyt +) and nuclear matrix protein 22 enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( nmp22 ) were performed .
all patients completed at least 24 months of endoscopic and clinical follow - up of after inclusion .
results within 24 months of follow - up , 38 ( 33.0 %) patients experienced disease recurrence and 11 ( 9.8 %) progression .
recurrence rates in patients with positive vs. negative cytology , fish , ucyt + and nmp22 were 52.6 % vs. 21.9 % ( hr = 3.9 ; 95 % ci 1.75 - 9.2 ; p < 0.001 ) , 47.6 % vs. 25.0 % ( hr 2.7 ; 1.2 - 6.2 ; p = 0.01 ) , 43.8 % vs. 22.4 % ( hr 3.3 ; 1.5 - 7.6 ; p = 0.003 ) and 43.8 % vs. 16.7 % ( hr 4.2 ; 1.7 - 10.8 ; p = 0.001 ) .
in patients with negative cytology , a positive nmp22 test was associated with a shorter time to recurrence ( p = 0.01 ) , whereas fish or ucyt + were not predictive of recurrence in these patients .
in the group of patients with negative cytology and negative nmp22 , only 13.5 % and 5.4 % developed recurrence and progression after 24 months .
conclusions patients with positive urine markers at time of negative cystoscopy are at increased risk of recurrence and progression .
in patients with negative cytology , only nmp22 is predictive for recurrence .
patients with negative marker combinations including nmp22 harbour a low risk of recurrence .
therefore , the endoscopic follow - up regimen may be attenuated in this group of patients .
keywords urine markers prediction recurrence risk surveillance anticipatory positive issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background patients with non - muscle invasive bladder cancer ( nmibc ) harbour a significant risk of tumor recurrence and progression [ 1 ] .
several risk stratifications have been developed to predict the risk of recurrence or progression based on clinical and pathologic parameters [ 2 ] .
however , these tools have only limited value in predicting the patients' individual risk .
therefore , improved risk stratification is urgently needed .
due to the lack of reliable tools for prognosis of patients with nmibc , the optimal follow - up of these patients is discussed controversially .
white light cystoscopy remains the gold standard for surveillance of patients after nmibc .
the main limitations of cystoscopy are its limited sensitivity for flat lesions and its character as an invasive procedure potentially leading to significant discomfort for the patients [ 3,4 ] .
urine cytology is also recommended as standard in the follow - up of patients with nmibc , as it is a non - invasive procedure with the potential to detect flat lesions not visible in cystoscopy [ 5 ] .
however , its sensitivity is satisfactory only for high grade tumors or carcinoma in situ .
newer markers such as fluorescence - in - situ hybridization ( fish ) , immunocytology ( ucyt +) or nuclear matrix protein 22 ( nmp22 ) have shown increased sensitivitity compared to cytology [ 6,7 ] .
however , their specificity has been reported to be lower compared to cytology in most studies .
for some of these markers , particularly the urovysion fish test previous studies have shown that a positive marker might precede visual or histologic detection of a tumor recurrence .
hence , some tests may be capable of detecting molecular changes associated with tumor recurrence earlier than cystoscopy [ 8,9 ] .
the clinical implications and the optimal management of these patients with negative cystoscopy or biopsy and concomitantly positive markers remain to be defined .
to date only few data exist on the predictive values of multiple urine markers in this negative - cystoscopy setting .
the present study is the first to address this issue concerning the four most widely available urine markers ( cytology , fish , ucyt + and nmp22 ) .
methods patients and samples 114 patients ( 95 men and 19 women , median age 70 , range 40 - 96 ) undergoing surveillance of nmibc were enrolled .
all patients had a negative cystocopy or , in case of suspicious findings , a negative histology at time of inclusion .
collection of urine samples was performed directly before cystoscopy .
upper tract imaging was performed in patients with positive cytology and / or fish .
in patients with suspicious or inconclusive findings in upper tract imaging , retrograde ureterorenoscopy was performed ( n = 14 , all negative ) .
in patients with cytology highly suspicious for urothelial carcinoma ( corresponding to categories iv + v of the papanicolaou classification system ) , mapping biopsies were performed within four weeks of urine sampling ( n = 9 , all negative ) .
median time between last evidence of tumor and urine sampling & cystoscopy was six months ( 3 - 48 ) .
written informed consent was obtained from all patients .
the study was approved by the local ethics committee ( ethikkommission der universitat tubingen , no. 400 / 2009a ) .
urine tests and diagnostic criteria urine samples of all patients were analyzed by cytology , fish , ucyt + and nmp22 ) .
for cytology , papanicoulaou staining was performed .
microscopic assessment was done according to the recommendations of the papanicolaou society of cytopathology [ 10 ] .
the following features were assessed to identify malignant cells : papillary clusters of cells with eccentric nuclei , single cells with eccentric nuclei , an increased nuclear - to - cytoplasma ratio , irregular nuclear borders and coarse chromatin .
atypical urothelial cells and urothelial carcinoma cells ( corresponding to categories iii - v of the papanicolaou classifiction system ) were considered positive [ 11,12 ] .
the urovysion fish assay was performed as previously described [ 13 ] .
the following chromosomal patterns were required for a positive test : >= 4 out of 25 morphologically suspicious cells with >= 3 signals of at least two chromosomes 3 , 7 , 17 or >= 12 nuclei with homozygous loss of 9p21 [ 14 ] .
immunocytology ( ucyt +) was preformed as described previously .
the test was stated positive , if >= 1 cells show a clear ( granulated ) positive immunofluorescence signal of cea or mucin [ 15 ] .
the nmp22 enzyme - linked immuno sorbet assay ( elisa ) was performed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer and considered positive for values >= 10 iu / ml [ 16 ] .
all patients underwent cystoscopy and biopsy or transurethral resection case of positive findings .
patients were considered positive for tumor if at least one suspicous area was observed during cystoscopy and malignancy was confirmed by subsequent histopathology .
follow - up for all patients , an in - house cystoscopic follow - up of at least 24 months after urine sampling was available .
patients were followed up according to the recommendations of the european association of urology [ 1 ] .
recurrence was defined as histologically proven bladder cancer of any grade and stage within the follow - up of 24 months .
progression was defined as any increase in tumor stage or grade .
urine marker results obtained at later time points were not included into analysis .
statistics kaplan - meier - curves were used to estimate times to recurrence and progression in patients with and without positive urine tests at time of cystoscopy .
log - rank test , univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard analyses were used to compare the risk of recurrence and progression in patients with and without positive marker ( s ) .
p - values <= 0.05 were considered significant .
to compare rates of recurrence and progression between patients with different numbers of markers in a combination positive , the cochrane armitage test for trend was applied .
results patients' characteristics are summarized in table 1 .
during the follow - up of 24 months , 38 ( 33.0 %) patients experienced disease relapse .
the median time to recurrence was 11.5 months ( 3 - 24 ) .
12 patients ( 10.5 %) experienced disease progression during follow - up. median time to progression was 11 months ( 3 - 24 ) .

as some of the recurrences detected in the first 12 months after initial cystoscopy might present no actual recurrences but tumors missed by initial cystoscopy , the role of urine markers to predict recurrence was determined separately for recurrences occurring later than one year after initial cystoscopy .
rates of recurrences and progression occurring between month 12 - 24 are shown in table 4 .
results of single markers remained predictive even for recurrences occurring later than 12 months whereas progression between month 12 and 24 only correlated with the results of cytology .

anticipatory positive urine marker combinations as cytology is the test most commonly used for surveillance of bc patients , we evaluated whether in patients with negative cytology , the results of other markers influence the risk of recurrence .
kaplan - meier analysis for patients with negative cytology and negative or positive fish , ucyt + and nmp22 are shown in figure 1e - g. recurrence free survival was significantly shorter for patients with positive vs. negative nmp22 at initial assessment ( figure 1g ) .
when performing various urine markers simultaneously , the risk of recurrence and progression may be influenced by the number of tests positive in a combination of two , three or four markers .
rates of recurrence and progression in patients with differing numbers of positive tests in 2 - , 3 - or 4 - test combinations are summarized in table 5 .
the number of positive tests in the combinations was significantly associated both with recurrence and progression in patients having no marker positive in 2 - test - combinations including nmp22 , the rates of recurrence after 2 years were as low as 13.5 % ( nmp22 & cytology ) , 11.1 % ( nmp22 & fish ) and 9.4 % ( nmp22 & immunocytology ) .
however , the proportion of patients with both tests negative in these combinations were only between 28.1 % and 31.6 % .

multivariable analysis the risk of recurrence may be strongly influenced by other factors such as risk groups defined by the eau [ 1 ] .
as patients were included at different time points of follow - up , time interval between last tumor ( proven by histopathology ) and inclusion into the study might also strongly affect the results .
multivariate analyses controlling for results of cytology , interval between last tumor and inclusion into the study and risk groups ( according to the guidelines of the eau [ 1 ]) are shown in table 6 .

urine markers are considered to be a valuable adjunct to cystoscopy [ 17,18 ] .
however , the optimal work - up of patients with negative cystoscopy and positive urine markers - particularly for newer markers with decreased specificity compared to cytology - has not been clearly defined yet .
it has been frequently discussed whether the presence of a positive marker in the absence of obvious changes in the bladder mucosa may indicate the presence of a non - visible tumor .
others even consider predicting the development of a tumor in the near future .
several reports indicate that anticipatory positive urine markers may indeed precede clinical tumor recurrence .
the phenomenon of anticipatory positive markers has been firstly described by steiner et al , who assessed the feasibility of microsatellite analysis in the follow up of 21 patients with nmibc .
in their cohort , two patients were positive for urine microsatellite analysis four and six months prior to cystoscopic detection of tumors [ 19 ] .
a comparison of multiple urine markers and their combination has not been performed yet with regards to their anticipatory role .
the aim of the present study was to compare the oncologic outcomes of patients with positive and negative cytology , fish , ucyt + and nmp22 at time of negative cystoscopy .
furthermore , we aimed to assess the impact of these markers on recurrence and progression when used in combinations .
in univariable analysis we observed for all markers to be highly predictive for recurrence and progression. of note , patients with positive markers were at higher risk for recurrence even 1 - 2 years after urine marker testing and negative cystoscopy .
this implies , that the tests might be able to display premalignant changes that are not visible macroscopically .
interestingly , in the group of patients having negative cytology , the only marker that was associated with increased risk of recurrence was nmp22 .
this indicates that both fish and immunocytology markedly overlapped with cytology with regards to prediction .
when combining urine markers , we observed that the more markers are positive in different combinations , the higher is the risk for recurrence and progression .
for various combinations including nmp22 , the risk of having disease recurrence and progression within 24 months was as low as 9.5 - 13.5 % and 2.8 - 5.4 % for patients with both tests negative ( depending on the combination ). of note , a negative 4 - test combination was not associated with a further decrease in the probability of recurrence and progression compared to the 2 - test - combination with the highest negative predictive value ( when considering recurrence as an event ) .
therefore , the use of more than two markers does not seem to provide additional benefit with regards to prediction of outcome .
the observation , that positive urine markers may precede visible tumor recurrence is in accordance with previous studies .
in a cohort of 1114 patients tested by urine cytology , the anticipatory positive rate of cytology was 44 % after a median time of 15 months [ 9 ] .
compared to our study , the rate of patients having a positive cytology but no positive histology within one year of follow - up was clearly lower .
this finding may be related to the fact that cytology is strongly dependant on the cytopathologist [ 20 ] .
urovysion fish has been observed to be positive before visible tumor recurrence in various studies .
in a study by yoder et al. , 56 of 250 patients with atypical or negative cytology were positive for fish and had no visible tumor recurrence at initial cystoscopy .
in 35 of these patients ( 62.5 %) , tumor recurrence developed during the median follow - up of 23 months .
similar results were observed in a study including 68 patients under surveillance for nmibc having negative cytology and cystoscopy at time of inclusion .
during the median follow - up of 13.5 months , 45 % of patients with positive urovysion developed recurrence vs. 12.5 % with normal urovysion test .
the proportion of patients with positive urovysion at time of inclusion was considerably high ( 62.5 %) , given the fact that all were negative for cystoscopy at time of testing [ 21 ] .
these findings are in contrast to our study , where in the group of patients with negative cytology , the rates of recurrence did not differ significantly between fish positive and negative patients .
this might be also caused by other criteria used for positive cytology .
in a study from italy 75 patients during follow - up of nmibc were divided into patients with low molecular grade ( changes in 9p21 or chromosome 3 ) and high - molecular grade ( gains of chromosome 7 or 17 ) fish results .
those patients with high molecular grade had a significantly shorter time to recurrence .
in this study , no substratification was performed for cytology positive and negative patients [ 22 ] .
however , the criteria used in this study were different compared to ours .
it is broadly accepted that the interpretation criteria might strongly influence the prognostic value of urovysion results .
in a study including 138 patients with negative cystoscopy during follow - up for nmibc , the urovysion criteria proposed by the manufacturer were not predictive for recurrence .
in contrast , criteria based on previous evidence suggesting that rare tetraploidic cells have a less strong diagnostic value than other aberrations , showed a significant association with disease recurrence [ 23,24 ] .
another test based on detection of genomic alterations which has been demonstrated to predict a later tumor recurrence is microsatellite analysis ( ma ) .
in a study by van rhjin et al. , ma was able to detect 75 % of tumor recurrences .
in the group of patients with positive ma and negative cystoscopy , 55 % experienced recurrence within six months vs. 11.6 % in patients with negative ma [ 25 ] .
similar results were obtained by van der aa et al. , who prospectitvely assessed the predictive value of ma in a longitudinal analysis for 458 series with persistent ma results .
they observed , that patients with persistent positive ma analysis had a 83 % risk of recurrence after two years vs. 22 % in patients with persistent negative ma analysis .
positive ma series preceded recurrences by one to 24 months [ 26 ] .
analysis of fgfr3 mutations in voided urine samples of patients with history of fgfr3 mutant tumors was performed in a study by zuiverloon et al. they observed , that that a single positive fgfr3 test was associated with a three times higher risk of a recurrence .
in patients with consecutive fgfr3 - positive urine samples the risk of developing a recurrence within 39 months was 90 % [ 27 ] .
for immunocytology , no report exists so far on anticipatory positive tests .
in a study from montreal including 109 patients during surveillance of bc , immunocytology results were correlated with tumor presence within 12 months [ 28 ] .
however , the study , which showed a proportion of patients with tumor during 12 months of 76 % , does not provide detailed information on when the recurrences occurred and how immunocytology predicted recurrences in patients with a negative cystoscopy at study inclusion .
similar to fish , we observed no difference in recurrence free survival between patients with negative cytology and positive or negative immunocytology in our study .
this might be due to a high percentage of patients ( 68.4 %) showing an overlap of results of cytology and immunocytology .
interestingly , nmp22 was the only marker being strongly predictive for recurrence in cytology negative patients .
this might be explained by the different features covered by both tests .
in our study , it was the test with the lowest concordance with cytology ( 43.0 % of patients showed different results for cytology and nmp22 ) .
such a strong correlation with risk of recurrence has not been observed in literature yet .
however , the fact that nmp22 might be a test offering more additional information than other markers when used in combination with cytology has also been observed before [ 28,29 ] .
besides nmp22 , other protein based urine markers have been also investigated for their potential in predicting recurrences in patients undergoing surveillance of nmibc .
in a study by sanchez - carbayo et al , patients under surveillance received serial testing for urinary bladder cancer test ( ubc ) , cyfra - 21 - 1 and nmp22 .
in the group of 65 patients with persistent negative markers during the study , only four patients developed recurrence within the one year follow - up of the study .
the authors concluded , that urinary markers should be considered as adjuncts enabling individualized cystoscopy intervals during nmibc surveillance [ 30 ] .
the present study is the first study addressing the question , how combinations of multiple markers may help to improve prediction of recurrence and progression when assessed at time of negative cystoscopy .
although we observed that patients having all tests positive in a 4 - marker - combination are at higher risk for recurrence than patients with less markers positive , the identification of patients with low risk of recurrence and progression was not improved significantly when using four instead of two markers .
when discussing urine markers as potential tool to individualize cystoscopy intervals during bc surveillance , patients and urologists expect a high negative predictive value ( npv ) for this test with regards to prediction of recurrence and / or progression .
therefore , the use of more than two markers has to be questioned in this context , as it does not seem to improve the npv compared to the 2 - test - combinations with high npv .
furthermore , the use of multiple markers is associated with a significant increase in costs .
the limitations of our study include the size and the heterogeneity of the cohort .
although we controlled for this bias in multivariate analysis , the inclusion of patients with different intervals between last evidence of tumor and urine marker testing might have influenced the results .
furthermore , we cannot exclude that the results of the urine markers influenced cystoscopy intervals as treating urologist were not blinded to the test results .
however , the inclusion of patients with a follow - up of at least 24 months and the performance of tests which took the presence of tumor within 24 months as an endpoint ( regardless of the time to recurrence ) may partially control for this bias .
as only a part of the patients underwent mapping biopsies during cystoscopy , it cannot be completely ruled out that carcinoma in situ was present at time of initial cystoscopic assessment .
moreover , the sensitivity of upper tract imaging for detection of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma is limited .
to exclude presence of upper tract tumors , a ureteroscopic assessment of all patients would have been necessary .
however , none of the patients presented clinical symptoms of upper tract urothelial carcinoma within the follow - up of two years .
conclusions the present study shows that patients with positive cytology , ucyt + , fish or nmp22 test at time of negative cystoscopy exhibit a shorter time to disease recurrence and progression .
for the first time , nmp22 is identified as a predictor of recurrence and progression in patients with negative cystoscopy and cytology .
negative combinations of nmp22 and a second urine marker are associated with a low risk of recurrence within two years .
the endoscopic follow - up regimen may be therefore attenuated in patients with persistent negative results of these markers .

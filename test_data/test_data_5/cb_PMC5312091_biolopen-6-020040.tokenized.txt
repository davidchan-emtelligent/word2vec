abstract drosophila crumbs ( crb ) is a key regulator of epithelial polarity and fulfils a plethora of other functions , such as growth regulation , morphogenesis of photoreceptor cells and prevention of retinal degeneration .
this raises the question how a single gene regulates such diverse functions , which in mammals are controlled by three different paralogs .
here , we show that in drosophila different crb protein isoforms are differentially expressed as a result of alternative splicing .
all isoforms are transmembrane proteins that differ by just one egf - like repeat in their extracellular portion .
unlike crb _ a , which is expressed in most embryonic epithelia from early stages onward , crb _ c is expressed later and only in a subset of embryonic epithelia .
flies specifically lacking crb _ c are homozygous viable and fertile .
strikingly , these flies undergo light - dependent photoreceptor degeneration despite the fact that the other isoforms are expressed and properly localised at the stalk membrane .
this allele now provides an ideal possibility to further unravel the molecular mechanisms by which drosophila crb protects photoreceptor cells from the detrimental consequences of light - induced cell stress .
summary : loss of crb _ c , one protein isoform encoded by drosophila crumbs , results in light - dependent retinal degeneration , but does not affect any of the other crumbs - specific functions .
key words epithelial polarity egf - like repeat alternative splicing mutually exclusive exon max - planck - gesellschafthttp :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100004189 introduction drosophila crumbs ( crb ) is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of epithelial apico - basal polarity .
loss of crb function results in embryonic lethality , caused by the breakdown of many epithelia ( grawe et al. , 1996 ; tepass , 1996 ; tepass et al. , 1990 ) .
besides a role in epithelial cell polarity , drosophila crb controls tissue size in imaginal discs by acting upstream of the hippo pathway ( reviewed in boggiano and fehon , 2012 ; genevet and tapon , 2011 ; sun and irvine , 2016 ) , regulates morphogenesis of photoreceptor cells , and prevents light - dependent retinal degeneration ( reviewed in bazellieres et al. , 2009 ; bulgakova and knust , 2009 ) .
crb is a type i transmembrane protein , the extracellular portion of which is composed of an array of epidermal growth factor ( egf ) - like repeats .
its small cytoplasmic tail of only 37 amino acids contains two conserved protein - protein interaction motifs , a c - terminal pdz ( psd95 / discs large / zo - 1 ) domain - binding motif and a ferm ( protein 4.1 / ezrin / radixin / moesin ) domain - binding motif .
in epithelial cells , crb is localised apically to the zonula adherens ( za ) where it organises a membrane - associated protein complex ( reviewed in bulgakova and knust , 2009 ; flores - benitez and knust , 2016 ; le bivic , 2013 ; tepass , 2012 ) .
all major components of the crb protein complexes , their respective interactions , localisation and many of their functions are conserved in vertebrates .
mouse and human genomes contain three crb genes , crb1 / crb1 , crb2 / crb2 and crb3 / crb3 , respectively , the first two of which are very similar to drosophila crb , while crb3 / crb3 contains a very small and completely different extracellular region ( makarova et al. , 2003 ; roh et al. , 2003 ) .
however , the cytoplasmic tails of all crb proteins are highly conserved .
interestingly , functions that are covered by a single crb gene in drosophila seem to be allocated to individual crb genes in vertebrates .
for example , mouse embryos mutant for crb2 die during gastrulation ( xiao et al. , 2011 ) , while human foetuses or zebrafish embryos carrying mutations in crb2 / crb2b , respectively , develop renal defects and filtration impairment due to a failure to organise functional foot processes of the podocytes ( ebarasi et al. , 2015 ; slavotinek et al. , 2015 ) .
mice mutant for crb3 die shortly after birth , exhibiting cystic kidneys and defects in the lung and intestine ( charrier et al. , 2015 ; szymaniak et al. , 2015 ; whiteman et al. , 2014 ) .
while mutations in human crb1 are associated with early - onset retinitis pigmentosa ( rp12 ) and leber congenital amaurosis ( lca ) ( den hollander et al. , 2001 , 1999 ) , it seems to be crb2 in the mouse that has taken on this function ( alves et al. , 2014 ) .
the specific functions of individual mammalian crb paralogs raise the question of how a single gene in drosophila can regulate a variety of functions during tissue development and homeostasis .
it is obvious that some portions of the crb protein are required for specific functions .
the pdz domain - binding motif of the cytoplasmic tail , for example , is of utmost importance for the development of most embryonic epithelia ( klebes and knust , 2000 ; klose et al. , 2013 ; wodarz et al. , 1993 ) , while the ferm domain - binding motif is required for dorsal closure in the embryo ( flores - benitez and knust , 2015 ; klose et al. , 2013 ) and participates in regulating the hippo pathway in imaginal discs ( chen et al. , 2010 ; ling et al. , 2010 ; robinson et al. , 2010 ) .
in contrast , the extracellular portion mediates growth regulation ( herranz et al. , 2006 ; richardson and pichaud , 2010 ) and wing vein refinement ( nemetschke and knust , 2016 ) via the notch pathway , controls cell survival ( hafezi et al. , 2012 ) and photoreceptor morphogenesis , and prevents light - dependent photoreceptor degeneration ( chartier et al. , 2012 ; izaddoost et al. , 2002 ; johnson et al. , 2002 ; pellikka et al. , 2002 ; richard et al. , 2009 ) .
a second mechanism by which crb achieves functional diversity is by recruiting different interaction partners in a stage - and / or tissue - specific manner ( reviewed in bulgakova and knust , 2009 ; flores - benitez and knust , 2016 ) .
finally , alternative splicing can give rise to various protein isoforms , which may have different functions .
for drosophila crb , flybase ( http :// flybase.org / , release 6.0 ) predicts four different crb isoforms as a result of alternative splicing , crb _ a , which corresponds to the previously published isoform ( tepass et al. , 1990 ; wodarz et al. , 1993 ) , crb _ b , crb _ c and crb _ d .
recently , moderate overexpression of the crb _ c isoform in the embryo was linked to centrosome positioning defects similar to those induced by loss of the ski - family helicase obelus ( vichas et al. , 2015 ) .
here we analyse the expression pattern of the predicted isoforms , and study the role of one of them , crb _ c , in more detail .
crb _ c is expressed in a subset of embryonic epithelia and in adult photoreceptor cells .
flies carrying a mutation that specifically eliminates this isoform are homozygous viable and fertile .
however , their photoreceptors undergo light - dependent degeneration , similar as photoreceptors of crb loss - of - function alleles , which lack all crb isoforms ( chartier et al. , 2012 ; johnson et al. , 2002 ) .
this raises the interesting possibility that it is crb _ c that protects photoreceptor cells from the damaging consequences of light - induced cell stress .
results crb isoforms differ by one egf - like repeat the crumbs ( crb ) locus of drosophila melanogaster , named after its embryonic cuticle phenotype ( jurgens et al. , 1984 ) , encodes a single - pass type i transmembrane protein ( kilic et al. , 2010 ; tepass et al. , 1990 ; wodarz et al. , 1993 ) .
flybase ( http :// flybase.org /) predicts four different isoforms , crb _ a , crb _ b , crb _ c and crb _ d , which are the result of alternative splicing of the crb pre - mrna .
the predicted crb - rb differs from the previously published crb - ra mrna by the presence of an additional exon of 129 nucleotides between the common exons 3 and 6 ( exon 4 ) , while the predicted crb - rc carries an additional exon of 321 nucleotides ( exon 5 ) ( fig. 1a ) .
the predicted crb - rd mrna contains exon 4 as the predicted crb - rb mrna and a further exon ( exon 7 , 42 nucleotides ) localised between the common exon 6 and 8 ( fig. 1a ). fig. 1. the crb locus encodes four different protein isoforms .
( a ) four crb mrna variants are the result of alternative splicing .
exons 1 - 3 , 6 and 8 - 16 are shared .
exon 4 is specific for crb - rb and crb - rd , exon 5 is only found in crb - rc and exon 7 only in crb - rd. grey boxes indicate 5 ' and 3 ' utrs .

( b ) the four predicted crb isoforms .
green rectangle : egf - like repeat ( numbering based on crb _ a ) , pink hexagon : repeat with similarity to the globular domain of laminin a , tm : transmembrane domain .
the four isoforms have the same n - terminus , including egf - like repeat # 1 - 6 , and share the c - terminus from egf - like repeat # 8 onwards , except for egf - like repeat # 11 , which carries a 12 amino acid insertion in crb _ d .
isoforms b and d lack egf - like repeat # 7 , isoform c carries an additional egf - like repeat (# 7a ) .
the horizontal bars indicate the regions used as epitopes for immunization .
antibodies indicated on top detect all isoforms .
alpha - crb _ c is specific for isoform c , alpha - crb _ b / d is specific for isoforms b and d. the blue line in isoform c indicates the isoform - specific insertion ( see also fig. s1 ) .
( the current version of smart used does not suggest an egf - like repeat between # 8 and # 9 , nor an additional laminin a - like repeat n - terminal to egf - like repeat # 1 as shown in some previous publications . )
( c ) western blot to demonstrate the specificity of alpha - crb _ c antibody .
crb _ a and crb _ c were overexpressed in drosophila s2r + cells and cell extracts were probed with either alpha - crb _ intra , which detects both isoforms , or alpha - crb _ c .
upon strong overexpression , alpha - crb _ c detects two bands , which presumably represents the non - glycosylated precursor and the mature glycoprotein , as upon deglycosylation only a single band is detected ( shown in d ) .
( d ) crb _ a and crb _ c were overexpressed in drosophila s2r + cells , cell extracts were deglycosylated and probed with alpha - crb2.8 .
crb _ c runs slightly slower than crb _ a , independent of whether it is glycosylated or not .
all predicted crb isoforms are transmembrane proteins , which share an unusually long signal peptide ( kilic et al. , 2010 ) , an array of egf - like repeats interspersed by three repeats with similarity to the globular domain of laminin a , a transmembrane domain , and a short cytoplasmic tail of 37 amino acids ( fig. 1b ) .
the four predicted isoforms differ in the number of egf - like repeats , which is 27 ( crb _ b , crb _ d ) , 28 ( crb _ a ) and 29 ( crb _ c ) [ according to prosite ( http :// prosite.expasy.org /) and smart ( http :// smart.embl - heidelberg.de /)] ( fig. 1b ) .
exon 4 in crb - rb and crb - rd introduces 43 amino acids ( grey box in fig. s1 ) , thereby eliminating egf - like repeat # 7 .
the additional exon 7 in crb - rd adds a stretch of 14 amino acids into egf - like repeat # 11 of crb _ d ( fig. s1 , yellow box ) .
exon 5 in crb - rc inserts an array of 107 amino acids into egf - like repeat # 7 ( fig. s1 , blue letters ) .
the inserted amino acid sequence completes egf - like repeat # 7 and adds one more egf - like repeat (# 7a ) , which terminates with the same four amino acids as egf - like repeat # 7 of crb _ a .
the sequence between egf - like repeat # 7 and # 7a in crb _ c is unusually rich in threonine and proline residues .
netoglyc 3.1 ( http :// www.cbs.dtu.dk / services / netoglyc - 3.1 /) predicts the threonine residues to represent sites of mucin - type o - glycosylation as posttranslational modification ( julenius et al. , 2005 ; tran and ten hagen , 2013 ) .
in fact , this stretch carries 19 predicted mucin - type o - glycosylation sites , while the rest of the crb protein , which is shared by all isoforms , contains only a single one located in the third laminin a - like repeat ( m. eichel , knust lab , mpi - cbg dresden , germany and k. k. , unpublished ) .
differential expression of three predicted crb isoforms in drosophila embryos crb rna and crb protein are supplied maternally ( laprise et al. , 2006 ) , and zygotic crb transcription starts at stage 6 and continues throughout embryogenesis ( tepass et al. , 1990 ) .
as revealed by rt - pcr , only crb - ra and crb - rc , but not crb - rb and crb - rd mrnas were detected in the embryo ( data not shown ) .
to further characterise the expression pattern of the corresponding proteins , we raised antibodies against exon 4 ( called alpha - crb _ b / d ) and exon 5 ( called alpha - crb _ c ) , which specifically recognise the crb _ b / d isoforms and the crb _ c isoform , respectively ( fig. 1b ) .
in addition , we used four antibodies which recognise all isoforms : the previously published polyclonal antibody alpha - crb2.8 ( tepass et al. , 1990 ) , the monoclonal antibody alpha - crb _ cq4 ( tepass and knust , 1993 ) , the polyclonal antibody alpha - crb _ intra2662 raised against the cytoplasmic tail ( kumichel et al. , 2015 ) , and a newly raised antibody against the common exon 3 ( alpha - crb _ ex3 ) ( fig. 1b ) .
the specificity of the newly generated antibodies was confirmed by the lack of staining in crb11a22 homozygous mutant embryos ( data not shown ) .
the specificity of the alpha - crb _ c antibody was further tested by western blot analysis of recombinant crb _ a and crb _ c proteins , overexpressed in s2r + cells .
alpha - crb _ c antibody only recognises recombinant crb _ c protein , but not crb _ a , while alpha - crb _ intra2662 detects both proteins ( fig. 1c ) .
both overexpressed isoforms are glycosylated , and crb _ c migrates slightly slower than crb _ a ( fig. 1d ) , which is consistent with the insertion encoded by exon 5 .
the crb antibodies as described above were used to analyse the expression pattern and localisation of the different crb isoforms in drosophila embryos .
in agreement with rt - pcr data , the antibody against crb _ b / d did not recognise any epitope in wild - type embryos ( fig. s2c,c ') .
therefore , the common antibodies ( alpha - crb _ cq4 , alpha - crb _ intra2662 and alpha - crb _ ex3 ) detect both crb _ a and crb _ c in the embryo , while alpha - crb _ c antibody is isoform - specific .
while alpha - crb2.8 detects crb protein from stage 6 onwards ( tepass et al. , 1990 ) , the first faint expression of crb _ c was detected only in late stage 11 embryos in the salivary glands and the malpighian tubules ( fig. 2a ) .
expression of crb _ c gradually increased in these tissues until completion of germ band retraction , and was additionally detected in the hindgut , the chordotonal organs ( fig. 2b,c ) and part of the foregut ( fig. 2q ) .
in contrast , alpha - crb2.8 recognised crb protein at stage 11 in the amnioserosa , the epidermis , the malpighian tubules , the salivary glands , the tracheal pits ( fig. 2d ) , and the fore - and hindgut ( fig. 2e,m,n , and data not shown ) .
staining with alpha - crb2.8 revealed high protein expression in these tissues during germ band shortening and later on ( fig. 2e ) , and in the chordotonal organs , the tracheal tree ( fig. 2e,f ) and the anterior and posterior spiracles ( fig. 2m and data not shown ). fig. 2. expression of crb isoforms during embryogenesis .

additional similarities and differences between crb _ a and crb _ c expression were observed .
during head involution and dorsal closure ( stages 14 / 15 ) , the expression pattern of crb _ c was maintained , with the salivary glands , the hindgut and the malpighian tubules showing elevated expression levels ( fig. 2g - n ) .
in addition , both crb _ a and crb _ c were detected in the embryonic garland cells ( fig. 2h,j ) , which function as nephrocytes .
at the end of embryogenesis , the proventriculus , the hindgut , chordotonal organs , garland cells , salivary glands and malpighian tubules expressed crb _ c .
alpha - crb2.8 detected crb proteins in these tissues as well , and additionally recognised crb protein in the epidermis , the tracheae ( fig. 2e ) , the pharynx , the esophagus ( not shown ) and the anlagen of the imaginal discs ( fig. 2f ') .
previously published data show crb protein expression in the embryonic hindgut as soon as the primordium of the hindgut is formed ( tepass et al. , 1990 ) .
crb _ c expression , however , was first detected in the hindgut at stage 13 , where it first became apparent in the boundary cells , two cell rows separating the dorsal and ventral compartment of the hindgut ( fuss and hoch , 1998 ; iwaki and lengyel , 2002 ; kumichel and knust , 2014 ; tepass et al. , 1990 ) .
crb _ c expression level in the boundary cells increased as embryogenesis proceeded , whereas the majority of hindgut cells , the principal cells , were hardly labelled with alpha - crb _ c ( fig. 2k,l ) .
in contrast , alpha - crb2.8 clearly detected crb protein in both the boundary and principal cells at stage 13 and later ( fig. 2m,n ) .
in the malpighian tubules , crb _ c was expressed in a graded fashion , with the highest expression in the distal tip cell ( fig. 2o,o ') .
in contrast , alpha - crb2.8 revealed uniform apical expression ( fig. 2p,p ') .
another difference was obvious in the embryonic foregut .
while alpha - crb _ ex3 and alpha - crb2.8 stained all three parts of the foregut , i.e. the pharynx , esophagus and proventriculus from stage 14 onwards , crb _ c was only expressed in the posterior part of the proventriculus , the so - called external portion or outer layer of the proventriculus ( fig. 2q ) .
taken together , crb _ c exhibits a different spatio - temporal expression pattern in the embryo in comparison to crb _ a .
crb _ c expression starts later during drosophila embryogenesis and gradually increases as development proceeds , and its expression is restricted to a subset of tissues , most of them tubular organs ( summarised in table s1 ) .
similar to crb _ a , crb _ c is localised apically in all epithelia where it is expressed .
localisation of crb _ c in crb and sdt mutant drosophila embryos according to earlier studies , crb and the scaffolding protein sdt interact through the c - terminal pdz domain - binding motif of crb and the pdz domain of sdt ( bachmann et al. , 2001 ; hong et al. , 2001 ) .
in most tissues , this interaction is required to mutually stabilise crb and sdt at the apical membrane .
to find out whether this interaction is also required for apical localisation of crb _ c , we analysed crb _ c localisation in embryos mutant for either crb8f105 or sdtk85 .
crb8f105 encodes a truncated crb protein lacking the c - terminal 23 amino acids , including the pdz domain and hence the sdt binding site , and behaves like a complete loss - of - function allele in the embryo ( wodarz et al. , 1993 ) .
the amorphic allele sdtk85 carries a premature stop codon in the n - terminal l27 domain and affects all known sdt isoforms ( berger et al. , 2007 ) .
in crb8f105 and sdtk85 mutant embryos , some epithelia , such as the epidermis , exhibit a complete breakdown of tissue integrity , while others , such as the hindgut , the rudimentary salivary glands and the proventriculus maintain aspects of cell polarity ( grawe et al. , 1996 ; kumichel and knust , 2014 ; tepass , 1996 ; tepass and knust , 1990 , 1993 ) .
in epithelia that maintain polarity , crb _ c was still restricted to the apical side , as seen in the rudimentary salivary glands , the proventriculus and the boundary cells of the hindgut ( fig. 3b,b ' , c,c ') .
no signal could be detected in the principal hindgut cells of crb8f105 and sdtk85 mutant embryos when using alpha - crb _ c , similar as has been shown for alpha - crb _ ex3 or alpha - crb _ cq4 ( kumichel and knust , 2014 ) .
crb _ c was still normally expressed in chordotonal organs , which are dislocated due to the breakdown of the epidermal tissue structure ( fig. 3b,b ' , c ) .
malpighian tubules fail to elongate and appear as disorganised cell clusters in both mutants ( campbell et al. , 2009 ) .
crb _ c was expressed in the malpighian tubules , but was diffusely distributed ( fig. 3b ' , c and data not shown ). fig. 3. apical localisation of crb _ c is independent of the crb / sdt interaction in drosophila embryos .

crb _ c localizes normally in the boundary cells ( bc ) , the chordotonal organs ( ch ) and the salivary glands ( sg ; yellow arrowhead in a,b , and c ) in both mutants , whereas it is delocalised in the malpighian tubules ( mt ; white arrowhead in a ' , b ' and c ) .

scale bars : 50 mum .
taken together , these data indicate that at late stages of embryogenesis , localisation and stabilisation of crb _ c at the apical membrane is independent of a functional crb - sdt interaction in those tissues that maintain aspects of apico - basal polarity .
due to the lack of a crb _ a - specific antibody , we currently do not know whether this behaviour is specific for crb _ c or also applies for crb _ a in these tissues .
in crb and sdt mutant embryos , the tracheal system breaks down , but individual epithelial cysts maintain apico - basal polarity ( tepass and knust , 1990 , 1993 ) .
crb _ a , the only isoform expressed in this tissue , was not apically localised in these cysts ( data not shown ) , showing that its localisation requires a functional crb - sdt interaction , at least in this tissue .
expression of crb isoforms in larval tissues crb is expressed at postembryonic stages in several tissues , such as the larval salivary gland and imaginal discs ( tepass and knust , 1990 ) , which represent the anlagen of most of the external structures of the fly , e.g. the wing , the legs or the eye .
cells of the imaginal discs are set - aside during late stages of embryogenesis and start to proliferate only in larval stages .
as shown above , alpha - crb2.8 , but not alpha - crb _ c , detected crb protein in the anlagen of the imaginal discs in stage 16 / 17 embryos ( fig. 2f ') .
this expression pattern seemed to be maintained throughout larval development , since alpha - crb _ ex3 gave a strong signal in the eye - , leg - and wing imaginal discs of third instar larvae .
in contrast , crb _ c was not detected in these discs ( fig. 4a - c ) , while crb _ b / d was absent in leg and wing discs , but could be detected in developing photoreceptor cells in eye discs ( data not shown ) .
similar as in the embryo , the salivary glands of third instar larvae expressed crb _ c ( fig. 4d ) .
in the larval hindgut , alpha - crb2.8 antibody staining showed uniform staining on the entire apical membrane ( data not shown ) .
unfortunately , staining with the alpha - crb _ c antibody did not work in the larval hindgut .
therefore , rt - pcr was performed from rna isolated from the hindgut of third instar larvae to reveal which isoform is expressed .
this experiment demonstrated that the crb - rc mrna was the predominant one expressed in the larval hindgut ( fig. 4e ). fig. 4. postembryonic expression of crb isoforms .

crb localises to the apical membrane .
in the eye disc , crb is predominantly expressed behind the morphogenetic furrow , and is strongly enriched at the apical membranes of differentiating photoreceptor cells ( arrow in c ) .
crb _ c expression is not detected in the examined imaginal discs ( a - c ) , but is observed in the larval salivary gland ( d ) .

to unravel the function of the crb _ c isoform , we isolated mutations by tilling ( targeting induced local lesions in genomes ) .
in total , we screened 2400 genomes for variants in the crb - rc - specific amplicon .
we identified two genomes with sequence differences resulting in nonsense mutations .
lines crbp17f5 and crbp13a9 carry cga to tga mutations , thus changing r575 and q590 of the crb _ c isoform to a stop codon , respectively ( fig. s1 ) .
as a consequence , mutant flies should express truncated crb _ c variants , but leave crb _ a and crb _ b / d unaffected .
the mutant lines were recovered from the living fly library and crossed for four generations to w * flies to reduce the number of associated sequence variants .
strikingly , crbp17f5 and crbp13a9 mutant flies were viable and fertile as homo - and hemizygotes and in trans over the amorphic allele crb11a22 .
they did not show any obvious developmental or morphological abnormalities .
no differences in larval hatching rate and in adult life span were observed for crbp13a9 .
in contrast , life span of homozygous mutant adult crbp17f5 flies was reduced , which is probably due to the genetic background , since crbp17f5 / crbp13a9 did not show any significant deviation in lifespan compared to that of wild - type flies ( data not shown ) .
in accordance with the molecular data , alpha - crb _ c did not detect any protein in crbp13a9 homozygous mutant embryos ( fig. s2a - b ') .
expression of crb _ a was not affected in crbp13a9 mutant embryos ( fig. s2a - d ') and crb _ b / d was still absent ( fig. s2c - d ') .
beside various roles in embryos and larvae , crb has important functions during photoreceptor ( prc ) development and homeostasis .
therefore , we analysed the expression of the different crb isoforms in prcs and looked for any mutant phenotype in eyes of crbp17f5 and crbp13a9 flies .
as previously shown using an antibody that detects all crb variants ( alpha - crb _ cq4 ) , crb localisation in adult prcs is restricted to the stalk membrane , the portion of the apical membrane between the za and the rhabdomere ( fig. 5a,b , arrows ) .
similarly , both alpha - crb _ c and alpha - crb _ b / d labelled the stalk membrane ( fig. 5a ' - b ' , arrows ) , suggesting that all crb isoforms are expressed in adult prcs .
deep sequencing experiments revealed that crb - rc is the predominant crb mrna expressed in head tissue and specifically in eyes ( fig. s3 ) .
in prcs of crbp13a9 mutant flies no signal was detected with alpha - crb _ c , while both alpha - crb _ b / d and alpha - crb _ cq4 detected crb proteins at the stalk membrane ( fig. 5c - d ') .
absence of crb _ c in heads of adult crbp13a9 mutant flies was confirmed by western blot ( fig. 5g ) .
since crb _ c was expressed in adult eyes , but not in larval eye imaginal discs , we analysed its expression in pupal eyes .
both crb _ c as well as crb _ b / d could be detected in prcs at 72 h after puparium formation ( h apf ) , consistent with previous observations using alpha - crb2.8 ( fig. 5e - f ') ( pellikka et al. , 2002 ; richard et al. , 2006 ) .
at this time , prcs have achieved their adult morphology , i.e. they have formed distinct polarised membranes .
the disparity in expression of these crb isoforms between 72 h apf and adulthood is also reflected at the level of their respective transcripts .
quantitative rt - pcr ( qrt - pcr ) analyses revealed a more than fivefold increase in crb - rc levels in the head of flies shortly after eclosion in comparison to heads of 72 h apf pupae ( fig. 5h ) .
in contrast , crb - ra and crb - rb / rd levels remained relatively unchanged during this period. fig. 5. expression of crb _ c in pupal and adult wild - type and mutant flies .

the identity of the other bands cannot unambiguously be determined .
( h ) graph depicts fold - change ( on y - axis , quantified as delta deltact ) after normalisation with housekeeping gene gapdh1 , for different crb transcripts ( on x - axis ) from heads between 72 h apf ( pupal stages ) and newly eclosed adult .
whilst there is negligible change in crb - ra ( fold - change = 0.99 ) and crb - rb / d transcripts ( fold - change = 0.98 ) , crb - rc transcript levels increase by 5.39 - fold between the last day of pupal development and at eclosion ( 72 h apf and adulthood ) .
error bars depict s.e.m. complete loss of crb function affects prc morphogenesis .
rhabdomeres are thicker , frequently contact adjacent rhabdomeres and do not reach the base of the retina in most cases , and the stalk is reduced in length .
when exposed to constant light , crb mutant prcs undergo retinal degeneration ( chartier et al. , 2012 ; izaddoost et al. , 2002 ; johnson et al. , 2002 ; pellikka et al. , 2002 ) .
therefore , we examined the morphology of prcs lacking crb _ c shortly after eclosion and after 7 days of continuous light exposure , and compared it to that of control and crb11a22 mutant eyes ( figs 6 and 7 ) .
upon eclosion , neither crbp13a9 ( fig. 6e,f ) , nor crbp13a9 / crb11a22 ( fig. 6g,h ) , nor crbp17f5 ( fig. 6i,j ) mutant prcs displayed any morphogenetic phenotypes .
their overall prc morphology is comparable to the genetic control examined , w * ( fig. 6a,b ) .
crbp17f5 showed a mild ( 20 %) decrease in stalk length , which was , however , not as severe as in crb11a22 ( decrease of 41 % ; fig. 6k ) .
this indicates that crb _ c does not play a major role in prc morphogenesis .
however , upon exposure to constant light , prcs of the two newly generated alleles crbp13a9 ( fig. 7c,c ') and crbp17f5 ( data not shown ) and of the trans - heteroallelic combination of crbp13a9 and crb11a22 ( fig. 7d,d ') showed clear signs of degeneration , similar as prcs of the loss - of - function allele crb11a22 ( fig. 7b,b ') ( chartier et al. , 2012 ; johnson et al. , 2002 ) .
degeneration is characterised by the loss of rhabdomeric ( apical ) membrane integrity , accumulation of electron - dense debris , and extensive vacuolisation in the prcs ( fig. 7 ) .
to quantify the results , we determined ommatidial integrity , measured as percent of remnant ommatidia with no obvious signs of degeneration , to total ommatidia , and normalised it to area ( fig. 7e ) .
whereas in w * retinas almost all ommatidia were intact ( 92 %+/ - 3.5 ) , this number was reduced to 6.3 %+/ - 3.5 in crbp17f5 and to 0 in homozygous crbp13a9 and crb11a22 and in transheterozygous crbp13a9 / crb11a22 prcs .
interestingly , the absolute number of discernibly remnant ommatidia was lower in the case of the loss - of - function allele crb11a22 ( fig. 7b , quantified in fig. 7f ). from this we conclude that crbp17f5 and crbp13a9 mutant prcs still have some residual crb function. fig. 6. crb _ c mutant photoreceptor cells exhibit normal morphology .

( f ) bar graph depicting the mean number +/ - s.e.m. of remnant ommatidia , normalized to area , in each of the genotypes indicated on the x - axis .
although there is degeneration in all crb mutant alleles , the phenotype is most severe in the loss - of - function allele crb11a22 ( large clone mosaics ) , evident from the reduced number of identifiable ommatidia per unit area ( compare with sections shown in the tem panel above ) .
sample size consists of three biological replicates , from which at least 100 ommatidia were evaluated ( with the exception of crb11a22 , in which most of the ommatidia completely degenerate and only 25 ommatidia could be identified for quantification ) .
discussion here , we present data to show that three of the four predicted proteins encoded by drosophila crb are differentially expressed during development .
we focussed on crb _ a and crb _ c , the two isoforms expressed during embryogenesis .
crb _ c comes up later than crb _ a and is expressed only in a subset of epithelia , namely the salivary glands , the malpighian tubules , the boundary cells of the hindgut and part of the foregut ( summarized in table s1 ) .
in addition , crb _ c could be detected in the chordotonal organs and the garland cells .
crb _ c is not expressed in the tracheae , in the epidermis and the amnioserosa .
in embryos lacking crb _ c , expression of crb _ a is not changed and crb _ b / d is still not expressed .
what do tissues expressing crb _ c have in common ?
most of them are tubular organs , including the ommatidium , which forms the interrhabdomeral space ( irs ) .
furthermore , most crb _ c - expressing tissues develop various membrane protrusions , which are required for absorption ( boundary cells ) , endocytosis ( garland cells ) , sensing ( chordotonal organs , prcs ) or secretion ( outer layer of proventriculus , salivary glands , malpighian tubules ) ( see table s1 ) , but not needed before the larvae hatch .
their function may be compromised in larvae lacking crb _ c , but still work sufficiently well to allow survival under standard laboratory conditions .
in contrast , tissues expressing exclusively crb _ a ( epidermis , trachea , fore - and hindgut ) secrete the rigid protective cuticle and form only irregular apical membrane folds during cuticle deposition ( uv and moussian , 2010 ) .
crbp17f5 and crbp13a9 mutants only develop one of the many described crb phenotypes - they undergo light - dependent prc degeneration .
crb _ c could not be detected in larval eye imaginal discs , but is only upregulated in the last 25 % of pupal development , consistent with the absence of any morphological prc phenotype in the mutants .
light - dependent retinal degeneration occurs in flies lacking all crb isoforms ( e.g. crb11a22 ) ( chartier et al. , 2012 ; johnson et al. , 2002 ) , raising the question whether it is the absence of crb _ c that causes retinal degeneration in crb11a22 mutant prcs .
since mutants affecting only crb _ a or crb _ b / d are not available , this question can presently not be answered .
interestingly , mutations in human crb1 result in rp12 - asssociated blindness ( den hollander et al. , 1999 ) , despite the fact that crb2 and crb3 are also expressed in the retina ( lemmers et al. , 2004 ; van den hurk et al. , 2005 ) .
this indicates that human crb1 and drosophila crb _ c have specific functions , which cannot be replaced by the other isoforms .
preliminary results indicate that prcs of crbp13a9 homozygous flies accumulate more intracellular rhodopsin - carrying vesicles when exposed to light , a typical sign of retinal degeneration in flies ( pocha et al. , 2011 ) , making this allele an ideal source to further unravel the molecular mechanisms by which drosophila crb protects photoreceptor cells from the detrimental consequences of light - induced cell stress .
crb _ c protein differs from crb _ a and crb _ b / d by the presence of additional 107 amino acids .
this region adds one more egf - like repeat and is highly conserved in all drosophila species for which the genomic sequence has been annotated ( https :// genome.ucsc.edu /) .
egf - like repeats are about 40 amino acids long , characterised by six conserved , regularly spaced cysteine residues , which allow the formation of three conserved disulphide bonds ( appella et al. , 1988 ) , and are found in secreted and transmembrane proteins of all metazoan .
egf - like repeats have been shown to mediate specific protein - protein interactions .
in the notch receptor of drosophila , for example , egf - like repeat # 11 and # 12 are sufficient for the interaction of notch with its ligands delta and serrate , which mediates not only signalling but also adhesion ( rebay et al. , 1991 ; sakamoto et al. , 2005 ) .
in the low - density lipoprotein receptor ( ldlr ) , binding of egf - like repeat a to pcsk9 ( proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 ) reduces the surface levels of the receptor and promotes its degradation ( zhang et al. , 2007 ) .
one can speculate that the additional egf - like repeat in crb _ c may modify the interaction with other proteins or may affect the homophilic interaction between the extracellular domains of crb molecules , as suggested to occur in the drosophila follicle epithelium ( letizia et al. , 2013 ) .
interestingly , many mutations in human crb1 , which are associated with rp12 , are missense mutations in individual egf - like repeats ( bujakowska et al. , 2012 ). whether these mutations result in structural changes of the egf - like repeats , which may affect the global organisation and / or the stability of the extracellular region , or whether they affect a specific interaction of the respective egf - like repeat with a binding partner , is not known .
exon 5 also includes a stretch of amino acids rich in threonine residues , known substrates for mucin - type o - glycosylation .
in fact , the difference in mobility of crb _ c in comparison to crb _ a under denaturing conditions may not only be due to the size difference , but also to an increased o - glycosylation .
o - glycosylation has been documented as an essential protein modification highly conserved in evolution ( bennett et al. , 2012 ; tran and ten hagen , 2013 ) .
various functions are associated with o - glycosylation in vertebrates , including the regulation of protein conformation , protein sorting and protein secretion .
the embryonic epithelia that express crb _ c , e.g. the salivary gland , the hindgut and the malpighian tubules , are also positive for several lectins , which detect o - linked glycans , particularly on the apical surface of these epithelia ( tian and ten hagen , 2007 ) .
in addition , these tissues express a number of genes encoding members of the pgant ( polypeptide n - acetylgalactosaminyltransferase ) family ( tran et al. , 2012 ). whether any of these lectins detects crb _ c has to be further analysed .
beside mucin - type o - glycosylation , crb and mouse crb2 can be modified by egf - specific o - glycosylation .
seven egf - repeats of crb are predicted to be o - glycosylated by the o - glycosyltransferase rumi , the drosophila homologue of mammalian poglut1 .
however , mutating all rumi target sites did not recapitulate the rumi loss - of - function phenotype , which is characterised by fused rhabdomeres ( haltom et al. , 2014 ) .
in contrast , loss of this modification in mouse crb2 resulted in impaired apical localisation of crb2 in epithelia of the developing mouse embryos and gastrulation arrest ( ramkumar et al. , 2015 ) .
alternative splicing of pre - mrna is a major mechanism used in higher eukaryotes to increase protein diversity .
data from the ensembl annotation indicate that 45 % of all drosophila genes and at least 88 % of all human genes encode transcripts undergoing alternative splicing ( lee and rio , 2015 ; pan et al. , 2008 ) .
the region from exon 3 to exon 6 of crb reveals a high degree of conservation in all drosophila species ( but not in other insects such as apis mellifera or tribolium castaneum ) , and all exon / intron boundaries fit with the regular gu / ag splicing signal recognised by the major spliceosome .
exon 4 and 5 present in the crb - rb / rd and crb - rc mrnas , respectively , are , based on the prediction , mutually exclusive exons , meaning that these exons never occur in the same mrna .
in the d. melanogaster exome , 1297 of the roughly 55,000 annotated exons are predicted to be mutually exclusive exons , but only 261 of these are predicted to be internal exons ( hatje and kollmar , 2014 ) .
the most striking example of mutually exclusive exons is found in the drosophila homologue of down syndrome adhesion molecule ( dscam ) , which can potentially encode more than 38,000 protein variants by using mutually exclusive exons ( schmucker et al. , 2000 ) .
mutually exclusive splicing depends on several regulatory mechanisms , including cis - acting sequences on the pre - mrna , trans - acting rna - binding proteins and signalling molecules controlling these events ( fu and ares , 2014 ; lee and rio , 2015 ; pohl et al. , 2013 ) .
recent results suggested that the helicase obelus controls the exclusion of exon 5 of crb at early embryonic stages .
absence of obelus results in premature / ectopic expression of crb - rc mrna during embryonic development , and induces polarity defects ( vichas et al. , 2015 ) .
in the future , it may not only be interesting to elucidate tissue - and stage - specific regulators involved in the expression of this alternatively spliced mrna , but also to unravel the role of the extracellular region and its difference between the isoforms .
materials and methods fly stocks and genetics flies were kept at 25degreesc .

we hypothesize that additional novel members of the b7 / cd28 family play a role as negative immune regulators and thus may serve as targets for therapeutic mabs .
utilising compugen 's predictive discovery platform , we identified nine novel members of this family that may serve as immune checkpoints .
the therapeutic relevance of three of these proteins , cgen - 15001t , cgen - 15022 , and cgen - 15049 , was confirmed following the validation of their immunomodulatory properties and their expression in various cancers .
two of these proteins , cgen - 15001t and cgen - 15022 , are the basis of a license and collaboration agreement recently signed with bayer as targets for cancer immunotherapy .
here we present results obtained for an additional novel immune checkpoint , cgen - 15049 .
following its ectopic expression on cancer cell lines , cgen - 15049 inhibits the activity of nk cells and cytotoxic t cells ( ctls ) .
the fusion protein , consisting of the extracellular domain of cgen - 15049 fused to an igg fc domain , displays robust inhibition of t cell activation and enhances itregs differentiation .
ihc studies indicate that cgen - 15049 is expressed in tumour cells of numerous types of cancers , as well as in tumour infiltrating immune cells .
based on its immunomodulatory activities on several types of immune cells which play key roles in cancer immune evasion , together with its expression pattern,cgen - 15049 may serve as mab target for cancer immunotherapy .

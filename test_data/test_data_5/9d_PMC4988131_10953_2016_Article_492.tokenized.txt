the precise control of crystallization is a key issue in providing a high quality crystalline product .
it has to be achieved by , among other means , a proper choice of the solution processing temperature , which is determined on the basis of the metastable zone width and type of solubility curve .
in this article experimental data for potassium chloride solution density , as a function of temperature and its correlation in the range from under - to supersaturation , are reported for solution concentrations between 24.62 % w / w and 31.84 % w / w. as could be expected in the case of undersaturated solutions and low supersaturation , the temperature dependence of density for solutions of different saturation may be described by a linear equation within the investigated range of concentrations .
it was also proved that for the undersaturation range there exists a pole point , which allows calculation of the saturation temperature , based on the density measured at any temperature .

keywords densimetry potassium chloride saturation temperature crystallization issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer science + business media new york 2016 introduction in order to control the crystallization process adequately , knowledge about physical properties of concentrated aqueous solutions is required .
the main problem with the determination of concentration during the process is paradoxically the high concentrations of saturated solutions , which makes it difficult to use most of the simple analytical methods ( e.g. titration [ 1 ]) .
however , many concentration measurement techniques have been successfully used , such as density [ 2 - 4 ] , conductivity [ 5 ] , atr - ftir spectroscopy [ 6 ] , ultrasonic velocity [ 4 ] , microcalorimetry [ 7 ] , refractive index [ 8 ] or gravimetry [ 9 ] .
precise concentration control during crystallization is crucial for achieving a high quality product .
one of the key elements of successful process design is the proper choice of solution processing temperature , which is determined on the basis of the metastable zone width ( mzw ) and type of solubility curve [ 10 - 12 ] .
the mzw can be measured by the difference between saturation temperature and the temperature of the first detected crystals during cooling at a constant rate .
therefore , it is limited by the metastable supersaturation and saturation curves .
the mzw may be determined on the basis of turbidity , electric conductivity , particle count number [ 13 ] , heat effect of nucleation [ 14 ] .
many process factors influence the crystallization kinetics including the cooling rate , thermal history [ 15 , 16 ] , mixing intensity [ 14 , 15 ] , impurities [ 15 ] , sample volume as well as the stochastic nature of nucleation [ 17 ] .
as a result , it is difficult to scale - up crystallization processes [ 18 ] .
in this work experimental data on density versus temperature and concentration of potassium chloride are reported .
the results are in good agreement with fragmentary data available in [ 19 ] .
the densimetry technique applied in this paper is a simple , fast , precise and reliable method that could be successfully used to monitor the concentrations of solutions in the saturation , undersaturation and supersaturation range ( before nucleation ) .
similar results for ammonium oxalate solutions were published by frej et al .
[ 20 ] and for fluoranthene in trichloroethylene by marciniak [ 4 ] .
moreover , this work proposes a calculational method , which allows determination of the saturation temperatures of an aqueous potassium chloride solution on the basis of density measurements at any temperature .
a single experimental data point permits calculation of the saturation concentration with use of the saturation curve [ 20 ] .
the approach is simple , fast , reliable and allows one to obtain high precision results with no need to perform extensive experimental research .
experimental section the experiments were performed using a thermostated 1.2 x 10 - 3 m3 crystallizer equipped with four baffles and a lightnin a200 mechanical propeller .
the experimental saturation temperature range from 289.15 to 333.15 k was investigated at concentrations ranging from 24.62 % w / w to 31.84 % w / w. the saturated solutions of potassium chloride were prepared by dissolving an excess amount of the salt ( min .
99.5 % w / w , avantor performance materials poland s.a ) in water purified by reverse osmosis ( conductivity equal to 0.06 mus.cm - 1 , hydrolab , poland ) .
the suspension was mixed for 2 h at a given temperature to obtain equilibrium between the solution and suspended crystals .
in order to verify consistency of the results with the literature data [ 21 ] , the concentration of selected samples were measured by gravimetrically .
density measurements were carried out in an oscillation densimeter ( anton paar dma 4500 ) with precision of +/ - 5x10 - 5 g.cm - 3 , and a resolution of +/ - 1 x 10 - 5 g.cm - 3 , the temperature was controlled to +/ - 0.01 k. the sample was taken using syringe with filter ( pore size 0.2 mum ) , which was preheated to 5 k above the sample temperature to prevent crystallization during the sampling , and injected into the densimeter .
the temperature of measuring cell upon sample injection was exactly the same as the temperature of solution in the reservoir .
after the first density measurement at the temperature of saturation .
the sample inside the cell was cooled and its density was measured again .
the temperature was set to decrease to 5 k below saturation curve by 1 k. further cooling led to sample crystallization resulting in a substantial deviation of density measurement .
in the undersaturated range the measurement procedure was similar , but the final temperature was 20 k above the saturation temperature .
the density data were derived from the average values of three independent measurements , which were almost identical ( maximum standard deviation is equal to 2.16 x 10 - 5 g.cm - 3 ) .
results and discussion in the table attached as supplementary material the experimental density data for undersaturated , saturated and supersaturated potassium chloride solutions are listed .
the values for saturated solutions are distinguished .
based on data from the table a graph presenting density versus temperature of concentrated kcl solutions was obtained ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 density versus temperature of concentrated kcl solutions the experimental data can be approximated by a linear equation with high accuracy .
in table 1 there are presented linear equation coefficients ( a , b ) and the square of the pearson correlation coefficients ( r2 ) for the undersaturated and supersaturated regions and for the whole concentration range .
moreover , the same type of linear correlation was obtained by frej et al .
[ 20 ] and marciniak [ 4 ] .

moreover , all functions intersect in one pole point , whose coordinates are ( 701.19 k , 0.98356 g.cm - 3 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
it is important to emphasize that obtained pole point has no physical meaning , it is used only for calculations .
based on this point and any other density measurement of undersaturated potassium chloride solutions at any temperature , it is possible to calculate the saturation temperature of this solution .
it results from the intersection of the linear function connecting those two points and the solubility curve .
the solubility density ( g.cm - 3 ) curve can be calculated from the table attached as supplementary material by the 2nd order polynomial approximation .

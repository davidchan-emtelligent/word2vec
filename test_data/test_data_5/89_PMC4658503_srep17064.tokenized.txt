the development of cost - effective , highly active , and durable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction ( orr ) is critically important for the sake of promoting widespared commercialization of fuel cells and metal - air batteries123456 .
since dai et al. reported the high orr activities of nitrogen - doped carbon nanotubes , heteroatoms - doped carbon materials , including nitrogen ( n ) , boron ( b ) , sulfur ( s ) or phosphor ( p ) doped carbon nanotubes / graphene / pyrolytic carbon / graphyne , have become a fast - growing branch of orr electrocatalysts in recent years , due to their low cost , fuel tolerance , and long - term durability7891011 .
considerable research has demonstrated the high - efficiency orr catalytic activities of those heteroatom - doped carbon nanomaterials originate from the breaking electroneutrality of carbon atoms adjacent to heteroatoms , and thus create charged sites favorable for oxygen adsorption and reduction789121314 .
besides , researchers have proposed that carbon materials doped with two or more kinds of selected heteroatoms can exhibit further improved orr catalytic activity , owing to the synergistic effects between different heteroatoms that introduce larger asymmetrical spin and charge density into carbon framework151617 .
up to now , numerous strategies , including chemical vapor deposition , arc - discharge / vaporization approach or plasma treatment under heteroatom atmosphere or in the presence of heteroatom - contained sources , have been developed to fabricate heteroatom - doped carbon nanomaterials8181920 .
however , most of these methods suffer from more or less drawbacks , including the external addition of necessary heteroatom - containing compounds , rigorous reaction conditions , high cost or tedious procedures , thereby restricting their applications on the small scale18 .
to prepare efficient orr catalysts , it is desirable to exploit low cost precursors that can be easily fabricated the heteroatom - doped carbon materials for large - scale commercial application .
recently , direct pyrolysis of precursors from natural plants and animals has emerged as an economic strategy to fabricate heteroatom - doped carbon electrocatalysts for orr , without requiring the extra addition of heteroatoms - containing reagents21222324 .
for instance , n and s dual - doped highly porous carbon showing excellent electrocatalytic activity for orr have been prepared by pyrolysis of seaweed at high temperature22 .
yu et al. demonstrated that a universal biological waste , human hair can be transformed into n , s - doped porous carbon with a high surface area , excellent conductivity , and most importantly , showing the superior electrocatalytic activities for oxygen reduction25 .
moreover , wang et al. demonstrated that n , o - doped carbon catalysts were fabricated using a gram - positive bacillus , bacillus subtilis adopted as precursor by an ionothermal process in the case of chemical activation with zinc chloride or potassium hydroxide26 .
although substantial progress has been made in the preparation of heteroatom doped carbon materials , it is still an interesting and challenging issue to find appropriate precursors for scale - up and industrial preparation of effective electrocatalysts to replace commercial pt / c catalysts for orr in fuel cells or metal - air batteries242526 .
shewanella oneidensis mr - 1 ( s. oneidensis mr - 1 ) , as a gram - negative , dissimilatory metal - reducing bacterium , is widely distributed in the natural environments including marine , freshwater , and sediment2728 .
currently , significant progress for shewanella has been made in understanding mechanisms of extracurricular electron transfer ( eet ) , improving the eet efficiency in microbial fuel cells293031 .
hitherto , however , there are very few studies focusing on their potential application as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction32 .
herein , we firstly exploit s. oneidensis mr - 1 into promising orr catalysts through a facile one - step pyrolysis without time - consuming process. s. oneidensis mr - 1 is considered based on the following rationales : 1 ) s. oneidensis mr - 1 that are typically rod shaped with length of 1 ~ 2 mum and diameter of 100 ~ 300 nm ( figure .
s1b ) , can be easily and rapidly grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions , thus potentially providing the lost cost carbon sources and templates27 .
2 ) s. oneidensis mr - 1 , as gram - negative bacterium , is composed of peptidoglycan , phospholipids , lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharides , containing the required sources of n , p and s for heteroatom - doped carbon matrix28 .
3 ) a larger number of c - type cytochromes capable of electron transfer are located in the outer membrane of s. oneidensis mr - 1 .
c - type cytochromes are heme proteins , with iron atom coordinated to four nitrogen atoms to form the porphrins ( fe - n4 ) , which can be found to be transformed into fe - nx - c type active sites for orr by pyrolysis33 .
taken together , s. oneidensis mr - 1 can thus be used as natural precursors to synthesize functionalized carbon materials with high surface areas and homogeneously distributed heteroatoms .
herein , a novel heteroatoms ( n , p , s and fe ) quaternary - doped carbon can be fabricated by directly pyrolyzing s. oneidensis mr - 1 precursors at 800 degreesc , 900 degreesc and 1000 degreesc under argon atmosphere , and the product is denoted as hqdc - x ( x refers to the pyrolysis temperature ) .
the hqdc - x catalysts maintain the cylindrical shape of bacteria after pyrolysis under high temperatures , and the heteroatoms including n , p , s and fe distribute homogeneously on the carbon frameworks , in accordance with our proposal .
most importantly , the hqdc - x catalysts exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for orr via a dominant four - electron oxygen reduction pathway in alkaline medium , which is comparable with that of commercial pt / c. furthermore , hqdc - x catalysts show better tolerance for methanol crossover and co poisoning effects , long - term durability than commercial pt / c , which could be promising alternatives to costly pt - based electrocatalysts for orr .
the method present here may provide a promising avenue to develop cheap orr catalysts from inexpensive , scalable and economical precursors .
experimental methods materials preparation shewanella oneidensis mr - 1 ( s. oneidensis mr - 1 ) were cultured aerobically in 100 ml of marine broth ( mb , 20 g.l - 1 ) with shaking at 30 degreesc for 24 h. then the s. oneidensis mr - 1 were collected by centrifugation , washed three times with mb. then , cells were placed in a 2.5 % glutataldehyde solution ( prepared in 0.09 mol l - 1 phosphate buffered saline buffer , ph = 7.4 ) and stored overnight at 4 degreesc for fixation .
after washing them with the same buffer , the cells were then dehydrated by using a graded ethanol series ( once with 30 % , 50 % and 76 % , and thrice with 95 % for 10 min each step ) with a gentle periodic agitation .
after centrifugating for 5 min , cells were dried at room temperature .
the fixed s. loihica pv - 4 were pyrolyzed in a ceramic crucible at 800 degreesc , 900 degreesc and 1000 degreesc under an argon atmosphere for 3 h , respectively .
the resultant heteroatom - doped carbon are denoted as hqdc - t , where t indicates the carbonization temperature .
structural characterization the morphology of as - prepared sample was characterized by scanning electron microscopy ( sem , jeol jsm - 7500f ) equipped with energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) .
nitrogen absorption / desorption measurements were conducted on a micrometritica ( asap 2010 ) porosimetru analyzer at 77 k. the brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) were applied to investigate the specific surface area of as - prepared materials .
x - ray photo - electron spectroscopy ( xps ) was obtained on xps photoelectron spectrometer ( escalab220i - xl ) with monochromatic alka x - ray radiation and the c1s peak at 284.5 ev as an internal standard .
the raman spectra were collected on a raman spectrometer ( labram hr800 ) using 532 nm laser .
the high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hr - tem ) images were obtained with a jem - 2100f operated at 200 kv. the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) spectrum of hqdc - x was characterized using the technique ( rigaku d / max 2500 v / pc ) with a cu kalpha source at a scan rate of 5degrees min - 1 .
electrochemical measurements electrochemical measurements were carried out at room temperature in a three - electrode cell using rotating disk electrode connected to an electrochemical analyzer ( chi 760c , ch instruments , shanghai , china ) .
pt wire was used as the counter electrode and ag / agcl was used as the reference electrode .
the working electrode was prepared by loading 15 mul of the catalysts ink on a glassy carbon electrode ( 5 mm in diameter ) , then 7.5 mul of the nafion ( 0.05 wt %) solution was added on the surface of the catalyst and dried in the air .
the catalytic ink was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing 2 mg of catalyst in 1 ml ethanol for 30 minutes to obtain a homogeneous solution ( 2 mg ml - 1 ) .
a commercial pt / c ( 20 wt % pt on vulcan xc - 72 , alfa aesar ) at a catalyst concentration of 2 mg ml - 1 was also prepared for reference .
the orr performance of catalysts was studied by cyclic voltammogram ( cv ) and linear sweep voltammogram ( lsv ) measurements in o2 - saturated 0.1 m koh aqueous solution .
cvs were measured in o2 or n2 - saturated 0.1 mol.l - 1 koh solution with a scan rate of 50 mv.s - 1 .
lsvs were performed in o2 - saturated 0.1 mol.l - 1 koh solution at a scan rate of 10 mv s - 1 under different disk rotation rates from 400 to 1600 rpm .
the methanol crossover effect and long - time duration were investigated by a chronoamperometric technique at a potential of - 0.4 v ( vs , ag / agcl ) in o2 - saturated 0.1 mol l - 1 koh solution at a rotation rate of 1000 rpm .
the numbers of electron transferred ( n ) of the orr was determined using the koutecky - levich ( k - l ) equation ( eqn .
1 ) : where jk is kinetic current density at a constant potential , j is the measured current density on rde , omega is rotating rate in rpm .
b , the reciprocal of the slope , can be determined by the slope of k - l plot based on levich equation ( equation 1 ) .
f , n , do2 , nu , co2 represent the farady constant ( 96485 c.mol - 1 ) , transferred electron number per oxygen molecule , diffusion coefficient of o2 ( 1.9 x 10 - 5 cm2.s - 1 ) , the kinetic viscosity ( 1.1 x 10 - 2 cm2.s - 1 ) , and the bulk concentration of o2 ( 1.2 x 10 - 6 mol.cm - 3 ) in 0.1 mol l - 1 koh .
the constant 0.2 is adopted when the rotating rate is expressed in rpm813 .
results and discussions morphology and structural characterization figure s1 shows the photograph of s. oneidensis mr - 1 colonies and typical scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) image of bacteria fixed with 5 % glutaraldehyde and dehydrated in serial ethanol. s. oneidensis mr - 1 bacteria have characteristic pink color due to an extraordinarily high content of c - type cytochromes in bacterial outer membrane .
the sem image of s. oneidensis mr - 1 shows the one - dimensional rod - like shapes with the diameter of 200 nm and length of 1 mum , that is similar with the previous report31 .
in a typical experiment , the hqdc - x materials were obtained by pyrolysis of the fixed s. oneidensis mr - 1 at 800 degreesc , 900 degreesc and 1000 degreesc for 5 h in an argon atmosphere with the heating rate of 5 degreesc.min - 1 in a split tube furnace,where x represents the carbonization temperature .
the typical sem images of hqdc - 800 , hqdc - 900 and hqdc - 1000 can be seen in fig. 1. as shown in fig. 1a,c,e , all hqdc - x materials maintain the original rod - like shape of bacteria , but their surfaces become rough with irregular pores formed. from the magnified sem image in fig. 1b,d,e , it can be clearly identified that a large number of nanopores appear on the surface of hqdc - x , while the diameter of pores on hqdc - x surfaces become larger with increasing pyrolysis temperatures .
more detailed structures of hqdc - 1000 were obtained by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hr - tem ) .
the disordered porous structures can be observed , as shown in figure s2a .
the magnified image ( figure s2b ) reveals the interconnected nanopores of hqdc - 1000 that offer a sufficient surface area for orr , deducing that the heat treatment causes pore formation in the framework .
moreover , the onion - like multilayer graphitic character can also be observed , which renders good conductivity .
this phenomenon should be contributed to the thermal decomposition of organic materials under high temperatures .
moreover , the brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) specific surface areas were calculated to be 74.3 m2.g - 1 for hqdc - 800 , 100.7 m2.g - 1 for hqdc - 900 , 142.4 m2.g - 1 for hqdc - 1000 , respectively ( figure s3 ) .
raman spectra are employed to investigate the structures of the pyrolytic products .
in figure s4a - c , the broad peaks of d band centered at 1350 cm - 1 should be associated with structural defects in sp2 - carbon hexagonal network in carbonaceous materials3435 .
the relatively narrow peaks of d ' band at 1620 cm - 1 are also defect induced raman features34 , indicating that numerous defects and active sites are developed in carbon materials after high - temperature pyrolysis3637 , which are beneficial for the orr .
x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) are carried out to analyze the chemical compositions of hqdc - x products .
the xps analysis of hqdc - x shows predominant c , o , n , p , s , along with trace fe ( fig. 2a , figure s5a and figure s6a ) , which suggest that n , p , s and fe were successfully doped into hqdc - x. typically , hqdc - 1000 has atomic contents of 83.48 , 13.52 , 2.26 , 0.46 , 0.1 and 0.18 at % for c , o , n , p , s and fe , respectively , as listed in table s1 .
the high - resolution c1s , n1s , s2p , p2p and fe2p xps spectra for hqdc - x can be deconvoluted according to the different binding energies of variable chemical bonds , as shown in fig. 2 , figures s5 and s6 .
the high - resolution xps c1s spectra between 282.6 and 290 ev can be fitted to four peaks .
the main peak observed at 284.4 and 285.1 ev can be assigned to c = c and c - c bonds , as shown in fig. 2b38 .
the others at higher binding energies of 286.2 ev and 288.8 ev should be attributed to c - n / c - s and cooh / hn - c = o bonds3940 .
moreover , three distinct peaks at 398.6 ev , 399.6 ev and 400.7 ev can be observed in the n 1s spectra of hqdc - 1000 in fig. 2c .
the bonding energies at 398.6 ev and 401.1 ev can be attributed to pyridinic - n and graphitic - n , respensively4142 .
the peak at 399.6 ev could be attributed to the fe - n bond , which served as the avtive catalytic site for orr4142 .
the total nitrogen contents for hqdc - x decrease from 2.58 % to 2.50 and 2.26 % with increasing pyrolysis temperature .
the high - resolution xps s2p spectra can be fitted to two energy components centered at around 163.6 and 164.8 ev , corresponding to c - s - c917 , and the p2p peak at approximate 132.0 ev is attributed to o - p bonds10 .
moreover , fe2p peak among 708 - 712 ev for hqdc - 1000 can be assigned to oxidized fe , suggesting that the surface iron existed in an ionic state bound by nitrogen , which are formed in the heat - treated process43444546 .
xrd was performed to obtain insigt into the crystalline nature of hqdc - 1000 .
as shown in figure s8 , the broad peak located at around 24.2degrees should be attributed to the ( 002 ) diffraction of graphitic carbon .
the weak peak at about 42.9degrees might appear to be the overlap of fe2n ( 211 ) , fe3n ( 101 ) and ( 101 ) peak of graphitic carbon4748 .
moreover , n , p , s and fe doped into carbon framework are also verified by the x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) elemental mapping images , indicating the existance of heteroatoms inclduing n , p , s and fe on the surfaces of hqdc - x ( fig. 3 , figure s9 and figure s10 ) .
these foregoing results demonstrate that n , p , s and fe have been successfully incorporated into carbon framework , which would play a determining role in enhancing oxygen reduction activities1749 .
electrochemical characterization the electrocatalytic activities of hqdc - x and commercial pt / c catalyst are firstly investigated by cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) in o2 or n2 - saturated 0.1 mol l - 1 koh solution with a scan rate of 50 mv s - 1 .
as shown in fig. 4a , in the n2 - saturated solutions , featureless voltammetric currents are observed between 0 v and - 0.9 v for all hqdc - x and pt / c. in contrast , well - defined cathodic oxygen reduction currents appear evidently in o2 - saturated 0.1 mol l - 1 koh electrolytes .
the onset potential , peak potential and peak current density of hqdc - 1000 are measured to be 0.01 v , - 0.18 v and 0.65 ma cm - 2 , respectively , which are comparable to those of pt / c ( 0.03 v , - 0.19 v , 0.65 ma cm - 2 ) .
hqdc - 800 and hqdc - 900 show relatively negative peak potentials at - 0.34 v and - 0.29 v , but high peak current densities of 0.59 ma cm - 2 and 0.63 ma cm - 2 .
the orr catalytic activities of hqdc - x are further compared with that of pt / c catalyst based on linear sweep voltammetry ( lsv ) at 1600 rpm .
as illustrated in fig. 3b , the the half - wave potentials of hqdc - x shift positively from - 0.21 v for hqdc - 800 and hqdc - 900 to - 0.14 v for hqdc - 1000 .
importantly , hqdc - 1000 exhibits positive half - wave potential ( - 0.15 v ) and high limiting diffusion current density ( 3.95 ma cm - 2 ) , which are similar to commercial pt / c catalyst ( - 0.15 v , 4.63 ma cm - 2 ) , demonstrating high catalytic properties of hqdc - 1000 .
besides , the catalytic performances of hqdc - 1000 , including onset potentials , half - wave potentials and limiting current denisties are very close to those the microorganisms - derived carbon and zif - derived porous carbon reported by yang et al. and cao et al. , respectively2650 .
to evaluate the orr kinetics on hqdc - x / gc electrodes , lsv curves were performed on the rotating disk electrode at a scan rate of 10 mv s - 1 with different rotation rates from 400 to 1600 rpm in o2 - saturated 0.1 mol l - 1 koh solution , as shown in fig. 4c and figure s11 .
the transferred electron number ( n ) per oxygen in the catalytic process can be calculated by the kotecky - levich equation .
as depicted in fig. 3d and figure s11 , the parallel and straight fitting lines of j - 1 vs omega - 0.5 are obtained , implying first - order reactions towards dissolved oxygen .
the n calculated from the slope of the k - l plots are 3.8 for hqdc - 800 , 3.5 for hqdc - 900 and 3.9 for hqdc - 1000 .
these results suggest a one - step , four - electron reaction pathway for orr on the hqdc - 1000 electrode , but a coexisting pathway involving the two - electron and four - electron transfer on both hqdc - 800 and hqdc - 900 electrodes .
according to the above - mentioned results , it can be concluded that hqdc - x , especially hqdc - 1000 , exhibits superior electrocatalytic performances that may make it a promising substitute for expensive commercial pt / c catalysts .
on one hand , previous reports have proved that the co - existence and synergistic effect of heteroatoms in the carbon framework have been found to be responsible for the improved electrocatalytic activities for orr .
heteroatoms including n , s and p can induce great strain and defect sites in the carbon material , which may facilitate charge localization for favourable chemisorption of oxygen515253 .
moreover , fe element is usually demonstrated to coordinate with n atoms to form effective fe - nx active sites towards orr54 .
on the other hand , since dai et al. firstly demonstrated that n - doped carbon nanotubes as orr catalyst display excellent oxygen catalytic performance , the potential mechanisms for orr on n - doped carbon materials have been largely investigated8 .
published literatures demonstrate , three species of n atoms , pyridinic - n , pyrrolic - n , and graphitic - n , can enhance the orr performances of carbonaceous materials in different ways1318 .
pyridinic - n , which has a lone electron pair in the plane of carbon matrix , can increase electron donor property and facilitate reductive o2 adsorption55 .
pyrrolic - n can change the band structure of carbon , raising the density of pi - states near the fermi level and reducing work function , which is not an effective promoter for orr activity as evidenced by the sluggish activity56 .
graphitic - n reduces the electron density on the adjacent c nuclei , and helps the electron transfer from adjacent c to n atoms , and n back donates electrons to adjacent cpz orbital , thus facilitating the o2 dissociation on the adjacent c atoms and forming a strong chemical bond between o and c57 .
interestingly , hqdc - 800 and hqdc - 900 have high contents of n , but display the relative low orr activities compared with hqdc - 1000 .
we may deduce that the higher onset and half - wave potentials of hqdc - 1000 are simultaneously dependent on the coordination effect of s , p , fe - nx species and graphitic - n ( figure s7 ) 5859 , while the larger limiting diffusion current is attributable to its relatively high surface area and porosity .
the hqdc - 1000 electrode is further subjected to testing the electrochemical durability , methanol and co tolerance ability toward orr via a current - time ( i - t ) chronoamperometric method at - 0.2 v in o2 - saturated 0.1 mol l - 1 koh solution at the rotation rate of 800 rpm .
as shown in fig. 5a , the current density of hqdc - 1000 reduces slightly to 93 % after 10,000 s while that of pt / c declines sharply to 64 % , indicating that the durability of hqdc - 1000 is superior to that of pt / c catalyst .
after the addition of 5 mol l - 1 methanol into the electrolytes , the cathodic current of hqdc - 1000 almost keeps constant .
as a comparison , pt / c catalyst is sensitive to methanol with the current density reducing to 45 % ( fig. 5b ) .
moreover , when co was introduced into the testing cell , the current density of hqdc - 1000 decreased only 11 % , compared with commercial pt / c ( 42 %) ( fig. 5c ) .
these results indicate that hqdc - 1000 has a much better electrochemical stability , anti - methanol crossover effect and low tolerance to co than commercial pt / c catalyst , suggesting that hqdc - 1000 can be a promising orr catalyst for practical application .
conclusions in conclusion , the n , p , s and fe quaternary - doped carbon porous materials ( hqdc - x ) for orr have successfully synthesized by one step pyrolysis of s. oneidensis mr - 1 bacteria used as the precursors for the first time .
after pyrolysis at high temperatures , the hqdc - x catalysts maintain the rod - shape of bacteria and display good electrocatalytic activities in alkaline solutions .
importantly , hqdc - 1000 exhibit positive onset potential , half - wave potential and high catalytic current density comparable to those of commercial pt / c catalyst .
we propose that the improved orr activity of hqdc - 1000 are ascribed to the synergistic effect between the doping heteroatom ( n , p , s , and fe ) in the carbon framework and hierarchically porous structures .
moreover , hqdc - 1000 catalyst demonstrates higher durability , anti - methanol crossover effect and co tolerance than pt / c catalyst , which make them promising alternatives to costly pt - based catalyst .
in addition , these results may also provide a new avenue for development of multi - heteroatom doped carbon nanomaterials using biomaterials for fuel cell applications and other areas .

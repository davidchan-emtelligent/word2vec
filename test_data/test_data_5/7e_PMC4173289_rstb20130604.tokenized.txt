the influence of astrocytes on synaptic function has been increasingly studied , owing to the discovery of both gliotransmission and morphological ensheathment of synapses .
while astrocytes exhibit at best modest membrane potential fluctuations , activation of g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) leads to a prominent elevation of intracellular calcium which has been reported to correlate with gliotransmission .
in this review , the possible role of astrocytic gpcr activation is discussed as a trigger to promote synaptic plasticity , by affecting synaptic receptors through gliotransmitters .
moreover , we suggest that volume transmission of neuromodulators could be a biological mechanism to activate astrocytic gpcrs and thereby to switch synaptic networks to the plastic mode during states of attention in cerebral cortical structures .

introduction with the advent of molecular genetics and cellular imaging techniques , our understanding of brain function has advanced substantially in the recent decade .
glial cell research has indisputably benefited from these techniques , as glial cells are generally electrically passive , and their dynamism resides most probably in biochemical and morphological changes .
among the glial cells , astrocytes occupy a significant proportion of the brain volume in mammals and are arguably the most numerous in primate cortical grey matter .
the morphology of astrocytes is best described as an interface between vascular and neuronal networks .
a typical protoplasmic astrocyte has a bushy organization of microprocesses that surround synapses and a few large processes that impinge on neighbouring vasculature ( giant end - feet ) .
for white matter fibrous astrocytes , the microprocesses extend around the nodal regions of myelinated axons .
such strategic positioning of astrocytes is indeed well matched with the classically supposed functions of astrocytes , including the clearance of synaptically released neurotransmitters , regulation of ionic concentrations and mediation of energy metabolism substrates .
since gliotransmission - - the ability of astrocytes to secrete biochemical molecules to influence surrounding neurons - - was discovered about two decades ago [ 1 - 3 ] , astrocytes have been hypothesized to play active roles in neuronal network operations .
membrane potential fluctuations recorded from the soma of mature astrocytes are quite modest ( i.e. within several millivolts ) at best .
the resting membrane potential of a typical astrocyte is less than - 80 mv , which is close to the reversal potential of potassium ( k +) .
astrocytes have an order - of - magnitude lower input resistance than pyramidal cells owing to k + channels that are permeable at resting membrane potentials ( e.g. twik - 1 , trek - 1 and kir4.1 ) [ 4,5 ] as well as the existence of hemichannels and gap junctions .
while these properties and the lack of active conductance make astrocytes electrophysiologically quiescent , astrocytes have been reported to have cytosolic calcium ( ca2 +) elevations and intercellular ca2 + waves [ 2 ] .
these ca2 + elevations occur without large membrane potential changes , because the ca2 + is released from internal ca2 + stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) .
such cytosolic ca2 + elevations in astrocytes have also been described in vivo in rodents [ 6 ] .
triggers that initiate astrocytic ca2 + elevation are diverse , but common neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are potent agonists for astrocytic ca2 + elevation through g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) .
one of the key questions in neuron - astrocyte interactions is whether astrocytic ca2 + elevations play any role in brain operation , and to identify the circumstances under which such neuron - glia interactions occur .
in this article , we focus on how subcortical neuromodulatory signals mediate astrocyte - neuron interactions in the context of synaptic plasticity in cerebral cortical structures .
2. volume transmission versus synaptic transmission chemical transmitters are released in two distinct transmission modes : wiring transmission and volume transmission ( for classic reviews , see [ 7,8 ]) .
wiring transmission is intercellular communication mediated via a physically defined connecting structure .
synaptic transmission is the primary mechanism of wiring transmission , and its primary feature is fast ( millisecond - order ) point - to - point communication .
glutamate and gaba are the predominant neurotransmitters for this in mammalian cortical structures .
the potency and reliability of the synapse are the key determinants of information transmission .
astrocytic microprocesses that ensheath synapses are thought to increase the fidelity of synaptic transmission by rapid neurotransmitter clearance and insulation from other synapses [ 9 ] .
volume transmission is by non - synaptic release of neuromodulators diffusing through the extracellular space ( ecs ; figure 1 ) , which is defined by an intricate and dense organization of synaptic and glial process morphology ( for a review , see [ 10 ]) .
as a result , the manner of diffusion deviates significantly from free diffusion because of the tortuosity and limited volume fraction of the ecs .
subsequently , a relatively large number of cells sense neuromodulators via extrasynaptic receptors .
in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus , volume - transmitted neuromodulators include acetylcholine and monoamines .
the afferent fibres for neuromodulators are mainly of subcortical origin , and usually make asynaptic junctions in the cortex and hippocampus via terminal varicosities in stark contrast to glutamatergic and gabaergic innervation .
for example , synaptic incidences are a mere 10 - 20 % of the total varicosities for acetylcholine [ 11,12 ] and noradrenaline [ 13,14 ] and 20 - 30 % for serotonin [ 15 ] .
in addition to the complex ecs geometry , the true nature of ecs diffusion is complicated by the presence of diffusion obstacles ( e.g. extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules ) and active interference system ( e.g. uptake by transporter or enzymatic degradation ) [ 10,16 ] .
theoretical models and simulations have been compared with experimental data obtained by real - time iontophoresis or fluorescent macromolecule imaging [ 10 ] .
figure 1 .
wiring transmission versus volume transmission and their effects on astrocytes .
( a ) wiring transmission targets designated synapses and produces localized responses in perisynaptic astrocytic processes .
( b ) in volume transmission , the neuromodulators diffuse into tortuous and convoluted ecs upon release from en passant varicosities .
such ecs diffusion results in activation of astrocytic gpcrs in larger areas than a synaptic component , resulting in synchronized and spatially spread astrocytic ca2 + activities .
( c ) volume transmission and synaptic transmission can occur simultaneously in brain states characterized by neuromodulator release , for instance , during attention .
as much as neurons receive this extrasynaptic neuromodulator transmission , astrocytes surrounding synapses are also the receivers .
serial reconstruction of the neuropil of rat hippocampal grey matter shows that glial processes occupy over 10 % of all plasma membrane area [ 17 ] .
this proportion is even higher when the analysis is confined to the extrasynaptic space , and thus glial surface represents a considerable target area for volume - transmitted neuromodulators .
moreover , astrocytes express receptors for subcortical neuromodulators [ 18 ] .
other remarkable differences between synaptic transmission and volume transmission are the time course and spatial range of signal transfer .
while neurotransmitters travel 20 - 30 nm across the synaptic cleft , volume - transmitted neuromodulators travel on the scale of micrometres to reach their receptors .
at the receptor end , ionotropic receptors dominate in glutamatergic and gabaergic synapses of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus , ensuring millisecond - order signal transmission .
extrasynaptic receptors of neurons include both ionotropic receptors and metabotropic gpcrs .
literature suggests that neuromodulator receptors in astrocytes are predominantly gpcrs that have a much slower signal transduction ( at least hundreds of milliseconds ) [ 19 ] .
therefore , while affecting many targets , volume transmission is not expected to provide temporally precise signal transmission .
considering the tight coupling of neuromodulatory systems and behavioural states , and the slow time course of gpcr signalling , elucidation of the significance of astrocytic activation by neuromodulators may yield a new insight into understanding neuronal information processing in distinct behavioural states .
3. astrocytic response to neurotransmitters and neuromodulators astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters and neuromodulators through a wide variety of gpcrs .
their activations trigger production of inositol 1,4,5 - triphosphate ( ip3 ) , which induces ca2 + release from the er. so far , several groups have reported that ca2 + elevations in astrocytes lead to gliotransmission of glutamate , d - serine or atp and in turn regulate neuronal activity and synaptic strength in brain slices [ 20 - 26 ] .
d - serine is an endogenous co - agonist of nmda receptors ( nmdars ) , and several studies have suggested that astrocytes release d - serine by exocytosis [ 27 - 29 ] .
d - serine release from a single astrocyte can modulate neighbouring neuronal nmdar currents [ 26 ] , and basal astrocytic ca2 + concentration and extracellular d - serine concentration are correlated [ 30 ] .
electron - microscopic analysis showed that glutamate and d - serine are localized in microvesicles near the er within the perisynaptic processes of astrocytes [ 31 ] , hinting at the significance of perisynaptic ca2 + signalling in gliotransmission .
recent studies using high - resolution ca2 + imaging of hippocampal slices suggested that astrocytic microprocesses respond to single synaptic activity with rapid and localized ca2 + elevation [ 32,33 ] .
roles of gliotransmission from astrocytic processes in synaptic function have been studied in the hypothalamic nuclei , where the astrocytic coverage of synapses decreases during lactation .
the availability of d - serine in the synapses was reduced in slices from lactating rats [ 34 ] .
there is growing evidence that astrocyte - derived atp , which was initially categorized as a paracrine messenger responsible for interglial propagation of ca2 + waves [ 35 - 37 ] , can regulate synaptic transmission [ 22,38 ] .
although several non - vesicular pathways have been identified , recent studies using transgenic mice selectively expressing a dominant - negative snare protein in astrocytes demonstrated the significance of vesicular release of astrocytic atp [ 22,39 ] .
another study showed that electrical stimulation of excitatory input to the hypothalamus induces metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mglur ) - dependent astrocytic ca2 + elevation and release of atp [ 40 ] .
notably , a rise in ca2 + in the astrocyte compartments immediately adjacent to the postsynaptic neuron was necessary for atp - mediated changes in synaptic transmission .
interestingly , noradrenaline application also led to astrocytic atp release and similar synaptic transmission changes [ 41 ] , implying that the astrocytes are capable of responding to and possibly integrating both neurotransmitters and neuromodulators ( figure 1 ) .
it has been shown that astrocytic ca2 + signals in the adult brain are mediated by volume - transmitted neuromodulators .
upon electrical stimulation of locus coeruleus ( lc ; the sole source of noradrenergic input to cortex ) , astrocytes exhibit broad ca2 + increases in somatosensory cortex [ 42 ] .
aversive stimulation , known to result in phasic lc activity , also led to widespread adrenergic astrocytic ca2 + elevation throughout sensory cortex , which is more pronounced in awake conditions [ 43 ] .
acetylcholine also activates global astrocytic ca2 + signalling in vivo .
the predominant sources of cholinergic afferents for the cerebral cortex and hippocampus are the nucleus basalis of meynert ( nbm ) and medial septum .
we and others have demonstrated that stimulation of the respective cholinergic nuclei leads to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( machr ) - dependent astrocytic ca2 + elevation in the cortex [ 44,45 ] and hippocampus [ 46 ] .
notably , nbm stimulation led to an increase in extracellular d - serine in the cortex of control mice , but not of mice lacking astrocyte - dominant ip3 receptors ( ip3r2 ) [ 44 ] .
our results indicate that astrocytic ca2 + responses by whisker or nbm stimulation differ in the following two aspects : ( i ) whisker stimulation induces mglur - dependent weaker ca2 + responses [ 47 ] , whereas nbm stimulation produces machr - dependent robust responses ; and ( ii ) while whisker - induced ca2 + surges return to baseline even during stimulation , plateau ca2 + increases persist throughout nbm stimulation .
gpcr signalling in astrocytes has also been suggested to regulate extracellular k + [ 48,49 ] , neurotransmitter uptake [ 50 ] and neurovascular coupling [ 51 - 53 ] ( but also see [ 54,55 ]) .
on the other hand , some recent studies that use molecular genetics have challenged the validity of gliotransmission .
astrocytic expression of and subsequent activation of a foreign gpcr ( mrga1 ) to selectively induce astrocytic ca2 + elevation [ 56,57 ] or genetic deletion of ip3r2s to diminish astrocytic ca2 + elevations [ 57,58 ] did not result in a notable change in excitatory synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal slices .
this apparent contradiction may be due to the method used to stimulate astrocytes .
for example , uncaging ip3 in mrga1 - positive astrocytes increased the frequency of glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mepscs ) in nearby neurons [ 56 ] .
a recent study further addressed this issue and showed that ca2 + uncaging in astrocytes triggers glutamate release , whereas agonist activation of mrga1 , par - 1 or purinergic receptors does not [ 49 ] .
moreover , astrocytic glutamate release can be mediated by channels [ 59,60 ] , and gq - coupled gpcrs may also have ip3 - independent pathways [ 61 ] .
future investigation on neuromodulator - mediated ca2 + signalling in astrocytic processes and their functional manipulation in vivo will advance our understanding of the role of astrocytes in normal brain function .
other key issues for future studies are to understand the functional significance of neuromodulator - driven global responses and neurotransmitter - driven individual localized transients and to identify the biological situation where these signalling modes are employed differentially or in synergy .
4. neuromodulator activation and gamma oscillations distinct neuromodulators contribute to different modes of animals' behavioural states .
likewise , animals' behavioural states and neuronal population dynamics are tightly correlated .
for instance , large amplitude slow waves ( 0.5 - 2 hz ) appear in the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) during deep sleep , whereas faster and lower amplitude patterns are seen in waking states .
gamma oscillations ( 30 - 100 hz ) appear during states of attention [ 62 ] , and this rhythm is thought to bind neural representation of different sensory modalities [ 63 ] .
detailed cellular mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations are yet to be fully elucidated , but reciprocal interactions between excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons , particularly parvalbumin positive fast - spiking basket cells , probably play a key role [ 64 ] .
as attention is naturally related to cognitive processing and learning efficiency , synaptic plasticity is probably induced during the gamma oscillation state .
indeed , repetitive phase locked activity of neurons at a gamma frequency provides a situation favourable for spike - timing - dependent plasticity [ 65 ] .
moreover , this type of plasticity is enhanced by activation of machrs [ 65 ] .
as neuromodulator release and eeg states are both highly correlated to an animal 's behaviour , they should naturally be closely linked .
as a matter of fact , the gamma states also coincide with release of neuromodulators .
for instance , gamma oscillations are induced by electrical stimulation of the nbm in anaesthetized rats [ 66 ] or optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain in awake mice [ 67 ] .
moreover , noradrenergic transmission has been shown to be crucial for waking gamma that appears shortly after gas anaesthesia wears off [ 68 ] .
during awake and rem sleep periods , higher amounts of acetylcholine are released in the cortex and hippocampus than during slow wave sleep [ 69 ] .
in accordance with cortical activation , cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain increase their firing rates , and alter their firing mode from single spike to rhythmic bursting [ 70 ] .
exposure to enriched environments ( ee ) has been known to boost animals' learning ability and its neural circuit remodelling effect has been studied for decades .
we recently found that hippocampal gamma amplitude increases in rats raised in ee , which hints at a possible link between gamma oscillation and learning [ 71 ] .
increases of spine density and dendritic complexity are common effects of ee in the cortex and hippocampus .
although the mechanism for chronic gamma increase is most probably multifactorial , increased input to pyramidal cells is a conceivable factor , as gamma is a product of balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input [ 72 ] .
the requirement of nmdar activation for chronic gamma enhancement [ 71 ] also suggests that a long - term potentiation ( ltp ) - like mechanism may be involved .
interestingly , gabaergic networks have also been reported to be altered by ee [ 73 ] .
as well as neurotransmission , there are notable changes in neuromodulation after ee. rats raised in ee after weaning show increased hippocampal and anterior cortical choline acetyltransferase activity after maze training [ 74 ] .
similarly , the concentration of released acetylcholine is higher when rats solve more difficult tasks [ 75 ] .
the causal relationship between chronic gamma increase and neuromodulator systems is not resolved at this time .
however , it is remarkable that many studies report enhanced ltp by neuromodulators including acetylcholine and noradrenaline , suggesting a permissive role of gpcr for synaptic plasticity and learning [ 76 ] .
as described in s3 , gpcrs are not only expressed in neurons .
given the existence and functional response of gpcrs in astrocytes , it is logical to ask whether activation of astrocytic gpcr has a role in synaptic plasticity in vivo .
5. astrocytic modulation of synaptic plasticity during gamma states as gamma states coincide with volume transmission of neuromodulators including acetylcholine and noradrenaline , astrocytic ca2 + dynamics are more active during these states ( s3 ) .
recently , three independent studies have investigated the role of gamma - state - induced astrocytic ca2 + elevation in synaptic plasticity .
these studies were performed in the somatosensory cortex [ 44 ] , visual cortex [ 45 ] and hippocampus [ 46 ] .
in each of these studies , the respective cholinergic nucleus was stimulated while sensory stimuli or electrical afferent stimulation was presented to anaesthetized animals .
as a result , long - lasting enhancements ( more than 1 h ) in stimulus - evoked potential or neuronal firing rate were observed .
these effects were diminished in ip3r2 knockout ( ip3r2 - ko ) mice , in which astrocytic large ca2 + elevations are deficient , suggesting the causal relationship between the astrocytic ca2 + elevation and induction of the synaptic plasticity .
nbm - evoked cortical gamma oscillations seem to be uninfluenced by astrocytic ca2 + , as the duration of gamma oscillations was similar between wild - type and ip3r2 - ko mice [ 44 ] .
neuronal activity is temporally coordinated in gamma rhythms by nbm stimulation and this synchronization could be a prevailing mechanism of augmented synaptic plasticity [ 77 ] .
however , the deficiency of nbm - associated cortical plasticity in ip3r2 - ko mice strongly supports a role of astrocytic ca2 + signalling in the synaptic plasticity .
in our investigation on plasticity in the somatosensory cortex , astrocytic ca2 + activities were elevated during costimulation of whiskers and nbm .
similarly , the extracellular concentration of d - serine is elevated during nbm stimulation and returns to the baseline thereafter .
considering the major role of nmdars in ltp [ 78 ] , the lack of extracellular d - serine increase in ip3r2 - ko mice suggests a pivotal role of astrocytic ca2 + signalling during the induction phase of the synaptic plasticity .
chen et al .
[ 45 ] showed that single unit activities in the visual cortex are enhanced when visual orientation stimuli are combined with nbm stimulation .
importantly , the neuronal response is enhanced only for the orientation paired with nbm stimulation .
as the orientation tunings of individual synapses are intermingled in mouse primary visual cortex [ 79 ] , this result advocates the importance of sensory input as the determinant for specificity of plasticity .
further investigation on spatio - temporal relationship of active astrocytes and augmented synapses should characterize the effective range of gliotransmission .
while the synaptic plasticity in our study is nmdar - dependent , a study by navarrete et al .
[ 46 ] investigated cholinergically augmented hippocampal ca3 - ca1 plasticity in the presence of an nmdar blocker .
their results suggest that glutamate acts as the gliotransmitter affecting neuronal mglurs to express presynaptic plasticity , whereas a recent paper suggests other interpretations such as transient change of extracellular ionic composition [ 48 ] .
these differences suggest that the molecular mechanisms of astrocyte - assisted synaptic plasticity may be diverse , but the common denominator of all in vivo experiments is the activation of cholinergic volume transmission ( figure 2 ) .
notably , similar hippocampal plasticity was evoked when medial septum stimulation was replaced by tail pinch [ 46 ] , and atropine could largely , but not completely , block the field response potentiation , suggesting that other neuromodulators such as noradrenaline could also be involved .
additionally , in prolonged gamma states , astrocytes can secrete cytokines including s100b and influence network synchronization [ 80 ] and synaptic plasticity [ 81 ] .
figure 2 .
schematic diagram for neuron - astrocyte interaction in the context of gamma - state - induced synaptic plasticity .
attentive states drive volume transmission of subcortical neuromodulators which in turn activates neuronal gamma oscillations and astrocytic gliotransmission to establish a state for synaptic plasticity induction .
sensory and social experience enhances neuromodulator production and gliotransmission of cytokines enhances gamma oscillations , although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated .

6. concluding remarks we have discussed a possible role of cortical astrocytes as an element enhancing cortical plasticity via gliotransmission .
volume transmission of subcortical neuromodulators serves as the drive for activation of astrocytes and gamma oscillations .
gamma oscillations appear during attentive states and provide temporally synchronized activation of groups of neurons ( i.e. cell assembly ) , association of which will lead to formation of memory and learning .
considering the astrocytic expression of functional gpcrs for neuromodulators and the tight relationship between the subcortical neuromodulator system and the cognitive states of an animal , the framework of this model is sound .
recently , multiple groups have shown that the cholinergic system can mediate such a mechanism in rodent cortex and hippocampus [ 44 - 46,82 ] .
remarkably , noradrenergic transmission is reported to provide a dominant drive for astrocytic ca2 + elevations during awake states [ 43 ] .
cholinergic volume transmission may provide an additional input to enhance ca2 + elevations in astrocytes during attention .
indeed , a synergistic effect of acetylcholine and noradrenaline in synaptic plasticity has been described [ 83,84 ] .
it is conceivable that similar operating principles are in effect in extracortical areas .
for instance , the basal ganglia system is under the strong control of dopaminergic innervation , whereas the cerebellar cortex receives significant serotonergic and noradrenergic innervations .
molecular and physiological investigations on the heterogeneity of astrocytes will be important to understand the regional operational characteristics of astrocyte - neuron interactions .
response to neuromodulators is widespread across the astrocytic syncytium owing to the nature of volume transmission , and possibly owing to interastrocytic ca2 + wave propagation [ 85 ] .
synaptic activity - driven elevation of focal ca2 + rise in astrocytes [ 32,33 ] may provide us an additional mechanism to promote synaptic efficacy .

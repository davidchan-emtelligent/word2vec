the aim of the present analysis is to combine evidence for association from the two most commonly used designs in genetic association analysis , the case - control design and the transmission disequilibrium test ( tdt ) design .
the cases here are affected offspring from nuclear families and are used in both the case - control and tdt designs .
as a result , inference from these designs is not independent .
we applied a simple logistic regression method for combining evidence for association from case - control and tdt designs to single - nucleotide polymorphism data purchased on a region on chromosome 3 , replicate 1 of the aipotu population .
combining the evidence from the case - control and tdt designs yielded a 5 - 10 % reduction in the standard errors of the relative risk estimates .
the authors did not know the results before the analyses were conducted .
7 - 10 september 2004genetic analysis workshop 14 : microsatellite and single - nucleotide polymorphismnoordwijkerhout , the netherlands background to establish allelic association between single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) and a disease , broadly speaking , two types of designs dominate .
the first is the classical case - control study , where the frequency of a certain allele is compared between cases and controls .
the other is the transmission disequilibrium test ( tdt ) [ 1 ] .
the tdt is a family - based method for linkage and association that is , unlike the case - control study , not sensitive to possible population stratification .
the tdt and the case - control studies have essentially the same objective , namely either to identify polymorphisms ( alleles ) that are causally related to a phenotypic trait , or to identify polymorphisms in high linkage disequilibrium to such a causal allele .
the methods only differ in methodology ; the tdt looks for such alleles through associations within families whereas case - control studies do so by identifying associations within populations .
for the tdt , triads consisting of parents and an affected child are needed , which may be hard to obtain .
in such a situation , combining evidence for association from tdt and case - control designs may be helpful .
such a mixture of tdt and case - control designs can occur in a number of ways .
to name just a few possibilities : 1 ) a tdt study was originally designed , and controls were subsequently added to increase power , or linkage was found in nuclear families , and these data were combined with controls for a case - control analysis ; 2 ) a case - control study was originally designed , and a tdt study was then set up to confirm findings , or parents of cases were later genotyped in a haplotype study in order to gain phase information [ 2 ] .
results from the separate designs are not independent , because the same cases are used in the case - control and tdt design .
in the genetic analysis workshop 14 , data are available on nuclear families and a modest number of controls .
ideally , one would like to combine these sources of data as efficiently as possible .
in a paper by nagelkerke et al .
[ 3 ] , it is shown how this can be done using simple logistic regression .
methods statistical analysis consider a snp with alleles 1 and 2 .
suppose that allele 2 is the high risk allele , and that 1 is the reference allele .
we assume an additive model , where the relative risks of disease of a 1 / 2 heterozygote and a 2 / 2 homozygote with respect to a 1 / 1 homozygote equal gamma and gamma2 , respectively .
the parameter gamma is our parameter of interest ; in what follows we refer to gamma as the effect parameter and to estimates of gamma as effect estimates .
let p be the frequency in the population of the high risk ( allele 2 ) allele .
we consider first one affected individual per nuclear family and show later how to adapt the analysis in case of multiple affected subjects .
the likelihood of p and gamma is given by product p ( genotypes of triplets | offspring affected ; p , gamma ) x product p ( genotypes of controls | p ) , the first term corresponding to the tdt design , the second corresponding to the controls .
for a tdt family , let go and gp denote the genotypes of offspring and parents , respectively , and let " case " denote the event that the offspring is affected .
the likelihood contribution of a tdt - family is given by p ( gp , go | " case ") = p ( go | gp , " case " ; p , gamma ). p ( gp | " case " ; p , gamma ) .
the first factor deals with transmission of alleles from parents to offspring , i.e. , the tdt in its likelihood formulation [ 4 ] .
the second factor essentially regains the information that was lost by using the tdt instead of the maximum likelihood estimator [ 3 ] .
the complete likelihood can thus be factorized alternatively as product p ( go | gp , offspring affected ; p , gamma ) x ( 1 ) product p ( gp | offspring affected ; p , gamma ). p ( gc | p ) , where gc denotes the genotypes of controls .
nagelkerke et al .
[ 3 ] then show that a single logistic regression with outcome y and two covariates x and z , given by logit ( pr ( y = 1 )) = exp ( alpha + beta z + gamma x ) ( 2 ) can be carried out in order to obtain a single approximate estimate of gamma from these two data sources .
one covariate z distinguishes between whether information comes from the top line ( z = 0 ) or from the bottom line ( z = 1 ) of the alternative likelihood factorization ( equation 1 ) .
in the transmission part ( top line ) , the outcome y equals 1 if , for a heterozygous parent , allele 2 is transmitted to the affected offspring , or 0 if allele 1 is transmitted .
in case of two heterozygous parents , one transmission can be added to the dataset for each heterozygous parent .
in the second part , the outcome y distinguishes between parent of a case ( y = 1 ) or control ( y = 0 ) .
the covariate x takes values 0 , 0.5 , and 1 for genotypes 1 / 1 , 1 / 2 , and 2 / 2 , respectively ( table 1 ) .
the estimated coefficient of x in ( equation 1 ) gives an estimate of gamma ( effect estimate ) , the relative risk of having the disease with genotype 1 / 2 relative to 1 / 1 genotype .
for motivation and details we refer to [ 3 ] .
note that the case - control study and the tdt can also be analyzed separately within this framework by selecting only z = 0 or z = 1 and omitting the covariate z ( for the tdt , also the constant alpha has to be removed because of lack of identifiability ) .
for two affected offspring in a nuclear family , transmissions from the same heterozygous parent to their offspring are no longer independent , conditional on both offspring being affected .
to deal with the dependencies caused by multiple affected offspring , we used the gee ( generalized estimating equations ) [ 5 ] extension of logistic regression , both for the combined and for the separate case - control and tdt analyses .
data used a preliminary linkage study using microsatellites showed evidence for linkage in a region on chromosome 3 , in replicate 1 of the aipotu nuclear family data in a region ranging from d03s0123 to d03s0127 .
based on these findings , we purchased packages 148 through 153 .
all snps in these packages were used , again for replicate 1 of the aipotu population .
we report only on the last six snps from package 153 , because these gave the clearest evidence for association based on the separate analyses ( case - control and tdt ) .
as outcome we used the kofendrerd personality disorder ( kpd ) .
the 100 nuclear families contained 2 ( 78 %) , 3 ( 16 %) , 4 ( 3 %) , 5 ( 2 %) , or 7 ( 1 %) affected offspring , for a total of 233 cases .
all fifty independent controls from the same data subset ( replicate 1 of the aipotu population ) were also used .
the r package [ 6 ] and the geepack library was used for the gee logistic regression analysis .
results table 2 shows the results from the case - control study , using all affected offspring from the nuclear families as cases .
the standard errors are rather large because of the modest number of controls available in the case - control study .
table 3 shows estimates ( se ) from the tdt only ( using logistic regression and gee ) ( i.e. , using the top two lines of table 1 only ) , as well as from the combined analysis .
clearly , the standard errors of the estimates are reduced , on average , by about 5 to 10 % .
the gain in precision is reasonable , given the small number of controls used here .
the other snps showed similar patterns ( modest gains in the precision of the effect estimates in the combined analysis , compared to tdt only ; results not shown ) .
discussion the assumptions underlying our approach are essentially those that underlie either of the two constituent elements of the analysis , namely the tdt and the case - control study .
in general the assumptions that underlie the case - control data , such as comparability of cases and controls and absence of population stratification , are far more stringent than those underlying the tdt .
one would therefore need to verify the assumptions underlying the case - control part of the study , before the two parts can be combined .
work on testing these assumptions , notably absence of population stratifications has been published [ 7 ] .
a recent paper by epstein et al .
[ 8 ] discusses a formal test of the poolability of the two designs .
it is likely that such hybrid forms of case - control and tdt designs will become more frequent in the future .
the method by nagelkerke et al .
[ 3 ] is straightforward to implement , and led , in general , to increased precision of the estimate of relative risk , compared to either design separately .
standard errors of the estimates reduced by about 5 to 10 % , compared to a tdt only design. with a larger number of controls , the increase in precision is likely to be larger .
arguably the most important advantage of the present approach is that it can be implemented in any statistical package .
moreover , embedding the analysis in a generalized linear modelling framework has the benefit of diagnostic tools and the possibility of incorporating covariates into the analysis .
our objective in this paper was very modest : to illustrate a novel method for combining evidence for association from case - control and tdt designs in a single simple analysis .
the results presented in this paper are certainly promising in this particular dataset ( a single replicate from a single population from the simulated genetic analysis workshop 14 data ) .
we did not determine whether the proposed method is useful or cost effective in any particular situation .
extensive simulation studies ( see epstein et al. [ 8 ] for a power comparison between combined analysis of case - control and tdt and separate analyses showing a gain of power of the combined analysis as compared to either of the separate analyses ) will be necessary in order to do that .
conclusion both the case - control and the tdt analyses already showed association of snps b03t3056 and b03t3057 with kpd .
the tdt design yielded considerably smaller standard errors than the case - control design .
combining the evidence from the case - control and tdt studies yielded a further 5 - 10 % reduction in the standard errors of the effect estimates , compared to the tdt - only design .

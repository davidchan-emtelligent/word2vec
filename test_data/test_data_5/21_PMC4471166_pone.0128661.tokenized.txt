a continental - scale model of holocene australian hunter - gatherer demography and mobility is generated using radiocarbon data and geospatial techniques .
results show a delayed expansion and settlement of much of australia following the termination of the late pleistocene until after 9,000 years ago ( or 9ka ) .
the onset of the holocene climatic optimum ( 9 - 6ka ) coincides with rapid expansion , growth and establishment of regional populations across ~ 75 % of australia , including much of the arid zone .
this diffusion from isolated pleistocene refugia provides a mechanism for the synchronous spread of pan - continental archaeological and linguistic attributes at this time ( e.g. pama - nyungan language , panaramitee art style , backed artefacts ) .
we argue longer patch residence times were possible at the end of the optimum , resulting in a shift to more sedentary lifestyles and establishment of low - level food production in some parts of the continent .
the onset of el nino - southern oscillation ( enso ; 4.5 - 2ka ) restricted low - level food production , and resulted in population fragmentation , abandonment of marginal areas , and reduction in ranging territory of ~ 26 % .
importantly , climate amelioration brought about by more pervasive la nina conditions ( post - 2ka ) , resulted in an intensification of the mobility strategies and technological innovations that were developed in the early - to mid - holocene .
these changes resulted in population expansion and utilization of the entire continent .
we propose that it was under these demographically packed conditions that the complex social and religious societies observed at colonial contact were formed .

introduction at the time of european colonial arrival in the late eighteenth century , aboriginal populations in australia were observed to have strong classificatory kinship systems , complex cultural and symbolic landscapes based on geographic totemism ( the ' dreaming ') , distinctive graphic art systems , land rights in the form of ritual property , and formalized exchange networks [ 1 - 3 ] .
this view appears in marked contrast to archaeological records from the late pleistocene and early holocene ( 30 - 7ka ) , which show a sparsely populated , highly mobile society with extensive open social networks [ 3 - 6 ] , implying significant changes took place in the mid - to - late holocene ( 4 - 0ka ) .
a number of studies have suggested that many technological and social innovations occurred in the last 2ka , in response to population pressure and climatic variability , including a shift to broad spectrum diets , longer residence times at well - resourced locales , seed - grinding , trade networks , and appearance of large ceremonial and aggregation sites ( e.g. [ 2 , 3 , 7 ]) .
recent work has demonstrated that similar population and climate pressures were experienced in the mid - holocene ( 6 - 4ka ) , but complex cultural landscapes analogous to those observed ethnographically did not materialize [ 8 - 10 ] .
however , while climatic variability and population appeared to have increased in the late holocene , and formed two critical elements in the formation of ethnographically observed societies , our understanding of mobility - - the likely foundation of any change - - is still poorly understood ( e.g. [ 11 ]) .
existing archaeological models for this period suggest hunter - gatherer behavior minimised foraging risk through increasing mobility , stockpiling and storage of food , and investment in tools and technology ( e.g. backed artefacts , tula adzes and seed - grinders ) [ 10 - 12 ] .
however , smith [ 2 ] argues that an increasingly diverse toolkit ( most evident through wooden artefacts observed indirectly through the archaeological record , and seed - grinding implements ) produced in the late holocene is unlikely to reflect an increase in mobility , but rather more sedentary or logistical strategies .
although detailed ethnographic records have been gathered in australia since the nineteenth century , their application to the past has proved problematic due , in part , to their sparse and often localized nature .
only in recent years has the compilation of large radiocarbon datasets , along with methodological development of time - series analysis , resulted in the isolation of robust regional archaeological trends that can be compared with ethnographic accounts ( e.g. [ 13 ]) .
these analyses have primarily focused on temporal trends , but new experimental approaches show that spatial interrogation of these data can also provide valuable information about the mobility and territories of prehistoric people .
to date , few examples of this continental geospatial approach have been attempted but the techniques can be readily applied to a range of global contexts ( e.g. [ 6 , 14 - 16 ]) .
here we use a comprehensive dataset of continental - wide archaeological radiocarbon data , and apply geospatial techniques and optimal foraging theory to explore mobility patterns of human movement and settlement across australia throughout the holocene .
optimal foraging theory and aboriginal australia optimal foraging theory ( oft ) , a facet of human behavioral ecology , provides a conceptual framework to explore hunter - gatherer subsistence behavior of past and contemporary societies [ 17 , 18 ] .
oft consists of models that analyze the cost and benefits of alternative courses of actions by foragers under a range of environmental and social conditions , with an assumption that they would seek to maximize their energy needs [ 17 , 18 ] .
originally developed to study animal behavior , oft has become widely adopted in hunter - gatherer studies .
we use elements from three models in our interpretations : diet - breadth ( or prey choice ) , marginal theorem value ( or patch residence time ) , and ideal free distribution [ 17 - 22 ] .
given the macro - scale focus of this paper , we use these models as an exploratory framework , rather than the hypothetico - deductive approach often applied in oft studies .
the diet - breadth model is the most commonly used , and examines decisions concerning whether to pursue or harvest a given resource , or continue searching for a better resource ( e.g. [ 17 , 20 , 21 , 23 ]) .
a forager should always pursue the resource with the highest post - encounter profitability , only including lower ranked resources if doing so would increase their overall return rate ( e / t ) , which is measured as total energy ( e ) acquired in patch over time ( t ) [ 21 ] .
resources are ranked by their post - encounter return rate ( e / h ) , which measures the total amount of energy acquired ( e ) over the total time spent handling ( h ) the item after it is encountered [ 21 ] .
thus , when the highest ranked resource is prevalent , only this item should be foraged , but as this declines , the model predicts that lower ranked resources would be utilized - - a broadening of the diet [ 20 , 21 ] .
as environmental and social conditions change , so does the optimal ' diet ' , with a broadening of diet frequently associated with anthropogenic resource depression ( over - exploitation ) , demographic pressure restricting access to highly productive patches , climate change and / or landscape degradation .
it is in these conditions that diminished returns are often followed by habitat modification [ 21 ] .
the difference between the diet - breadth and patch residence time models is one of scale , with the latter exploring a forager 's decision to remain or move from a given patch in an environment of heterogeneous resources [ 21 ] .
specifically , the model predicts the threshold in time that a ' rate maximizing ' hunter - gatherer ( where a forager 's goal is to increase the rate at which energy can be gained per unit time searching and handling and traveling between patches ) would switch from foraging to traveling [ 20 ] .
as a patch is exploited to below the average rate of return of all other patches in a habitat ( including the travel costs associated with moving ) , hunter - gatherers would relocate .
generally , where patches contain dense , high - yielding , predation - resistant resources , longer residence times , more sedentary occupation and population growth would occur ; conversely , sites of sparse and non - predation - resilient resources would result in shorter residence times , high mobility , and population instability .
the distance between patches also plays a role , with closer - spaced productive patches often resulting in high mobility between them , and longer residence times as distances between patches increase .
this latter response is frequently influenced by increasing populations , which inhibit access to nearby productive patches , and influence both societal mobility and the optimal diet ( e.g. [ 24 ]) .
the ideal free distribution ( ifd ) model examines how colonizers move into new habitats ( multiple patches or a homogenous zone of production ) based on their quality and suitability [ 17 , 21 ] .
hunter - gatherers are assumed to choose the best habitat first , before migrating into lower - ranked areas as existing habitat quality declines through population density and increasing competition ; a process that continues until populations stabilize or free habitats are exhausted , and which is often episodic in nature .
a recent variant of the ifd is the ideal despotic ( or dominance ) model , which explores the influence of populations defending or controlling resources .
it provides one possible mechanism for the development of social hierarchies and complex societies , with environmental inequality favoring earliest colonizers settling in the most profitable habitats [ 21 ] .
while becoming more common , oft studies are still not widely applied in australia ( e.g. [ 20 - 21 , 24 - 28 ]) , but the ethnographic record demonstrates a range of behaviors that could be explained through such a framework .
in arid regions , aboriginal populations exhibit short patch residence time , high mobility and diet broadening in drier years ( e.g. [ 29 , 30 ]) .
the pitjantjatjara for example were observed to forage over a 2,590km2 area in a three - month period [ 29 ] .
conversely , in ameliorating conditions , populations would converge around a handful of resource - rich patches ( large water sources especially ) for long periods to undertake ceremonial and other social activities [ 30 , 31 ] .
in more temperate ecotones , observations include large populations with a sedentary lifestyle , evident in hawkesworth 's [ 32 ] earliest references to ' huts' and robinson 's ( in jones [ 33 ]) descriptions of ' villages' in tasmania .
while these early observations must be interpreted circumspectly , an exhaustive review of ' aboriginal architecture ' by memmott [ 34 ] ( p .
204 ) provides some corroboration : '[ high cliffy island and lake condah ] although at opposite ends of the continent , are the most striking examples of stone villages occupied ...
in both pre - contact and the early contact period ' .
he also documents semi - sedentary winter villages in northwest tasmania and permanent residential base - camps in the wet tropics .
allen [ 35 ] in his descriptions of the bagundji of the darling basin , also refers to semi - sedentary camps of 45 individuals along several parts of the river system .
material and methods the use of radiocarbon ( 14c ) ages as a proxy for human activity is becoming commonplace in the archaeological literature ( e.g. [ 36 - 47 ]) , but must be carefully considered in its application .
one of the key current issues is whether the radiocarbon data , often recovered as detrital charcoal within archaeological sites , reflects human activity .
recent critical analysis of the technique suggests a close correlation is evident [ 8 , 37 ] , and that the data can be used as a proxy for demographic change [ 36 - 45 ] ( cf. [ 46 - 47 ]) .
there remain , however , limitations in the spread and distribution of the data available for the australian continent [ 48 ] .
currently , there are 1,562 archaeological sites documented in the dataset , which equates to less than 1 site per 4,000km2 on average , with a range of between ~ 1 / 100km2 in areas of greater research ( such as the southeast ) to ~ 1 / 10,000km2 in less intensively investigated regions .
while the results produced here appear robust , and correlate well with other archaeological data , the influence of these broad sampling biases is unknown .
for these reasons ( and other limitations detailed in s1 text ) , we recommend the geospatial and time - series techniques adopted here are used as a heuristic analytical tool to identify broad trends of demographic change , in conjunction with other archaeological evidence ( e.g. correlations of the time - series with artefact discard rates , sedimentation rates , taphonomic studies of differential preservation , appearance and spread of diagnostic material culture , rock art distribution etc ) .
the analysis undertaken here comprises of the spatial and temporal exploration of 3,761 radiocarbon ages from 1,562 archaeological sites across australia dating to between 12 - 0ka ( fig 1 ) [ 48 ] .
following calibration , the dataset was divided into time - slices , either over - lapping 2,000 year intervals where number of data points were low ( n = < 145 ) ( 12 - 4ka ) , or firm 500 year intervals where the number of data points were high ( n = > 145 ) ( 4 - 0ka ) .
within each time - slice , duplicate data points were averaged to address multiple ages from the same site or archaeological feature < 10 km apart .
for the remaining data in each time - slice , spatial analysis using a partitioning clustering technique , k - means , was then applied .
this was an iterative stochastic process in which all data points were assigned to a pre - determined range of cluster ( k ) centroids ( n = 2 - 22 ) .
each centroid point was randomly placed initially , and then re - defined as more data were added and discrete clusters formed .
for robustness , this analysis was re - run 100 times .
optimum numbers of clusters for each time - slice , were then determined using cluster homogeneity ( the distance between centroids and associated data points ) , with lower values indicative of a better fit ( table 1 ) .
all data associated with each respective cluster was further defined by an encompassing rectangle ( identified as a minimum bounding rectangle ( mbr )) to indicate size and shape of the each cluster .

the mbrs were used to identify a population 's ranging area or territory , with larger ( smaller ) values suggesting a more ( less ) extensive use / movement across the landscape .
in marked contrast to the lgm , however , the period 12 - 0ka is not characterized by low population numbers , allowing us to consider the clusters as reflecting a qualitative change in the organization / fragmentation of societies across the landscape .
to further characterize the nature of mobility through the holocene , we exploited the data to identify where multiple radiocarbon dates are recorded at an archaeological site within any given time - slice .
we interpret sites with increasing numbers of radiocarbon data to reflect longer residence time and / or more permanent settlement .
while this is an assumption that may be influenced by intra - site sampling ( a researcher focusing on a particular strata for example , or conversely limited by funding and thereby reducing sampling ) , it seems an unlikely coincidence that in the last 2ka , when we propose significant population growth that the number of sites with multiple dates in a given time - slice is ~ 29 % , double the value of any previous time - slice back to the lgm .
at the same time , the number of sites with only one radiocarbon date drops from ~ 90 % in the terminal pleistocene and early holocene to ~ 60 % in the last 2ka .
if this is purely an artefact of intra - sampling bias issue , these results would suggest that researchers are focusing more extensively on recent archaeological deposits than those of antiquity , something we consider highly unlikely given the experience of the authors .
results and discussion the results of our analyses indicate hunter - gatherers were severely disrupted by climate fluctuations during the pleistocene termination , with populations remaining low and isolated into the early holocene ( 11 - 7ka ) ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
the widespread use of the continent only appears to have begun with increasing populations during the onset of the holocene ( fig 2c ) .
at 10ka , ~ 3.7 million km2 ( 48 %) were within an mbr and being exploited by hunter - gatherers ( table 1 ) .
despite the establishment of contemporary climatic systems across australia at this time ( including the monsoon and westerly airflow ) [ 9 , 49 ] , and the inundation of the continental shelf [ 50 ] , occupied areas remained similar to hunter - gatherer refugia documented in the terminal pleistocene [ 6 ] , including the pilbara , southwest western australia , eastern kimberley , southeastern australia , tasmania , and einasleigh uplands ( see s1 fig for location of these biogeographic regions ) .
the mbrs were slightly larger than those prior to 10ka [ 6 ] , suggesting some minor expansion of populations into new habitats - - the onset of an ideal free distribution ( ifd ) model ( fig 3a ) .

the size of the mbrs here have been used to create fig 2c .
the early - to - mid holocene ( 9 - 6ka ) is characterized as australia 's thermal maximum [ 9 ] , with an increasing opening up of ecological and hydrological resources across australia due to an intensification of the monsoon systems and inundation of the sahul shelf [ 51 - 52 ] ; and to the south by re - establishment of the westerlies resulting in high lake - levels ( e.g. [ 53 ]) .
as predicted by ifd , with improving habitats , we see significant exploration and / or occupation of the continent at this time , with ~ 5.8 million km2 ( 75 %) encompassed within mbrs ( figs 2c and 3a ) , including tasmania , the semi - arid country around the lower murray - darling system , along the east and northeast coast , and the western deserts .
this last region was generally considered un - inhabitable until this period [ 4 - 5 ] , and which now showed exploitation / visitation across large tracts of the great and little sandy , gibson and great victoria deserts .
it was during this time that there was significant growth and expansion of populations out of pleistocene refugia into new habitats .
archaeologically , this period saw the establishment of a large number of sites across australia ( e.g. norina cave and madura cave ( nullabor ) ; marillana a rockshelter ( pilbara uplands ) ; koongine cave ( naracoote coastal plain ) ; warragarra rockshelter ( tasmanian central highlands ) ; and roonka flat dune open site ( murray darling basin )) , or contain evidence of re - activation / intensification of occupation ( e.g. allen 's cave ( nullabor ) ; loggers shelter ( sydney basin ) ; puntutjarpa rockshelter ( central ranges ) ; serpents' glen rockshelter ( gascoyne ) ; new guinea ii rockshelter ( australian alps ) ; puritjarra rockshelter ( great sandy desert ) ; dabangay ( cape york peninsula ) , and native wells rockshelters ( brigalow belt south )) ( see fig 1 for location and references in s1 text ) .
the general absence of densely occupied sites at this time ( fig 2d ) suggests mobility was high with generally low populations (~ 87,000 ( 1 / 64km2 )) migrating into new , probably closely spaced and productive , habitats and resource opportunities .
this expansion provides a likely mechanism for the pan - continental appearance of a number of prehistoric attributes , including the pama - nyungan language [ 54 - 56 ] , panaramitee rock art style [ 57 ] , and backed artefacts [ 58 ] , all considered to have become established in the first half of the holocene .
expansion from a number of spatially isolated pleistocene refugia also provides a probable explanation for the different directional spread of these social and technological features. between 6 - 4ka , use of the landscape began to decline ( fig 2c ) .
spatially , there was little change with the earlier parts of the holocene , aside from a slight breaking up of the western desert mbrs ; and some minor growth along the eastern coast ( fig 3b ) .
this reduced exploitation of the landscape associated with increasing populations ( fig 2a and 2b ) and growing numbers of archaeological sites ( fig 2d ) may / likely reflect saturation of habitats ( as per ifd models ) , resulting in increasing distance between productive patches , and leading to greater consideration by hunter - gatherers of becoming more sedentary , broadening their diet and / or increasing their technological investment in resource procurement .
regional populations appear to have become more established , and show long - term , frequent and / or repeat usage of the same areas ( e.g. arkaroo rock ( flinders lofty block ) ; rta g1 ( sydney basin ) ; malangangerr rockshelter ( darwin coastal ) , devon downs rockshelter ( murray darling basin ) , and kenniff cave ( brigalow belt south )) ( see fig 1 for location and references ) .
given these changes in land - use occur at the end of a 3,000 year period of climatic stability , and importantly before the onset of enso aridification at ~ 4ka , they are likely a result of internal social , economic and / or demographic change .
it appears that when resources were prolific , there was greater opportunity for the initiation of low - level food production in tandem with hunter - gatherer activities [ 59 - 61 ] .
( low - level food production is a term given to societies that fall within the middle ground between hunter - gatherers and agriculturists , having elements of both , but not easily assigned to either [ 59 - 61 ] .
here , we consider low - level food production to reflect hunter - gatherers that have initiated some elements of domestication ) .
we see this in the increasing variety and diversification of archaeological sites , most notably the appearance of middens and the greater exploitation of marine resources ( e.g. hooka point ( sydney basin ) ; tubridgi sites 2 - 8 ( carnarvon ) ; skew valley midden ( pilbara ) , canunda rocks ( naracoorte coastal plain ) ; clybucca ( nsw north coast ) ; muyu - ajirrapa ( arnhem coast ) ; and jordan river ( tasmania south east )) ( see fig 1 for location and references in s1 text ) .
mcniven et al .
[ 62 ] demonstrate the initiation and use of off - shore islands some 40km off the mainland for the first time during this period .
in central australia , rock art indicates the establishment of permanent populations with corporate identities [ 2 , 56 ] and home range strategies [ 63 ] .
while in temperate regions , implementation of fish traps , eel traps and swamp management all become established [ 64 , 65 ] , and along with observations of ( as yet largely undated ) stone houses , or their remains , support an increasingly sedentary lifestyle ; similar to the well - documented irrigation constructions and resultant permanent settlements of the owens valley paiute of eastern california ( also noted by [ 59 ]) .
it is likely that demographic pressure played a role in these behaviors , with an estimated 110,000 people occupying the continent by the mid - holocene , or approximately 1 person / 47km2 ( table 1 ) .
much of this population was probably situated in temperate and tropical ecotones , where densities appear to have converged on 1 / 11km2 , a packing threshold [ 66 ] that in accordance with marginal value theorem and ideal despotic models would have restricted movement into new habitats or patches ( environmental infilling [ 19 ]) , or made distances between unoccupied patches too far for feasible relocation , and necessitated a shift in strategies ( such as increasing diet - breadth ). by all appearances populations were flourishing by the end of the holocene climatic optimum , and it is interesting to speculate whether more intensified food production may have developed were it not stymied with the onset of enso conditions at ~ 4.5 - 4ka ( see [ 67 ]) .
technological and behavioral change accelerated with the onset and intensification of enso ( 4 - 2ka ) as high ranked resources became sparse , including use of thermoplastic resins for hafting , the development of a more elaborate ( and possibly efficient ) hunting toolkit , a diverse suite of wooden implements , and a broadening of diet to accommodate lower calorific foods most evident through the proliferation of ground - stone assemblages for plant and seed processing [ 2 , 5 , 10 , 36 , 68 ] ( cf. [ 69 ]) .
this period saw significant decline in rainfall and re - activation of dune systems across the continent [ 49 ] .
climatic deterioration is well - documented to have reduced the primary productivity of ecosystems ( resource depression ) , and placed stress on existing populations [ 2 ]. with the onset of aridity , mbrs declined by some 2 million km2 ( 26 %) , and returned to values comparable to the pleistocene / holocene termination ( table 1 ) .
while a slight drop in populations was evident during this time ( fig 2a ) , there was a significant increase in the number of archaeological sites - - especially locales that exhibited repeat or ongoing occupation ( fig 2d ) - - suggesting mobility did not increase , but rather sedentary and technological behavior initiated in the mid - holocene intensified ( e.g. the ground stone assemblages for plant and seed processing first found in the lower deposits of puritjarra rockshelter , puntutjarpa rockshelter and skew valley midden , now prolific across most arid zone sites [ 23 , 70 , 71 ]) .
cluster centroids increased for the first time in the holocene ( fig 3c ) , and imply a more fragmented population , especially in the western deserts and central parts of australia .
more surprising is the fragmentation of the southeastern region , perhaps indicating that the loss of rainfall in this region was unexpected ( when compared with the arid zone ) and had significant impact on populations .
increasing numbers of clusters suggest interactions between hunter - gatherer populations may have diminished , either through economic defensibility of resources [ 63 ] , or the re - instatement of environmental barriers and abandonment of marginal habitats ( similar to those observed in the late pleistocene [ 6 ]) .
it is at this time ( 4 - 2ka ) that mcconvell [ 54 ] suggests the northern nyungic ( branch of the pama nyugan ) languages broke up. in contrast to existing views where hunter - gatherers become more residentially mobile ( e.g. [ 12 ]) , the data demonstrate that their response was three - fold : a decline in populations , a broadening of diet , and increasing investment in procurement and handling techniques in productive habitats , with abandonment of more marginal areas ( low productivity patches ) [ 18 , 68 ] .
archaeologically , these responses are evident through the appearance and widespread use of seed - grindstones [ 2 ] ; increasing use of plant resources [ 35 ] ; the diversification of a wooden toolkit , visible through the emergence of specialized wood - working tools , e.g. tula adze [ 2 , 10 ] ; advanced food processing techniques ( e.g. macrozamia plants ) [ 72 ] ; and greater reliance on marine resources evident by the increasing number of midden related ages in the dataset , and the migration and exploitation of off - shore islands previously too unproductive for use [ 19 , 48 , 73 ] .
mosaic patch burning to encourage small game may also be part of these behaviors ( e.g. [ 26 ]) , but currently our knowledge of this is temporally poor .
one of the most common features of this period is the proliferation of backed artefacts and points , which have generally been considered to reflect high mobility and a risk - minimization strategy ( e.g. [ 12 , 58 ]) .
while our results may support a risk - minimization approach , they do not support greater mobility , but rather suggest greater investment in technology was implemented to improve food procurement and production in the face of demographic pressure and depressed resources [ 68 ] .
such investment may also , in part , be a result of costly signaling [ 18 , 74 ] , with individuals trying to improve their chances of hunting returns to gain favor and prestige within the group ( see [ 75 ] for a contemporary discussion of this issue ) .
while the onset of enso (~ 4ka ) initially resulted in a significant shift in behaviors such as those referred to above , hunter - gatherers were recovering by 2.5ka , with populations increasing and spreading .
given that the majority of palaeoclimatic records indicate enso persisted until 2ka ( e.g. [ 76 ]) , population changes at 2.5ka are likely being driven by internal social , demographic and economic conditions , rather than climatic variability .
growth of both populations and territory was then rapid and extensive , with maximum values reached between 2 - 1.5ka ( fig 2c ) , a period of strong la nina conditions ( resulting in increased precipitation in regions exhibiting marked population growth ) .
this behavior can be considered to reflect the re - establishment of an ifd model , whereby populations are expanding into marginal areas now exhibiting improved resources .
at this time , peak values indicated virtually all of the continent (~ 7.7 million km2 ) was being utilized , with only parts of the great victoria , simpson and strzelecki deserts remaining un - occupied ( fig 3e ) .
cluster centroids also returned to pre - enso numbers ( table 1 ) .
the number of re - visited or densely occupied archaeological sites increased three - fold when compared with earlier parts of the holocene ( fig 2d ) , suggesting more of the landscape was being used by the growing population , rather than a change in mobility strategies , at least at a continental - scale .
this interpretation is supported by the archaeological record , with ~ 50 % of all radiocarbon data occurring in the last 2ka [ 8 ] , and the initiation or re - visitation of marginal sites , especially in the arid zone ( e.g. glen thirsty well ( great sandy desert ) and bush turkey 3 rockshelter ( little sandy desert )) , and dense occupation deposits in locales with good ecological and hydrological resources ( e.g. puritjarra rockshelter ( great sandy desert ) , carpenters gap 1 rockshelter ( central kimberley ) , sassafras 1 rockshelter ( sydney basin ) , yengo 1 rockshelter ( sydney basin ) and nimji rockshelter ( victoria bonaparte )) ( see fig 1 for location and references ) .
we postulate that it was during this period ( 4 - 2ka ) that intensification of low - level food production and hunting strategies developed earlier in the holocene - - in combination with diet broadening - - allowed both sustainability of populations and stability in food procurement through enso , which ultimately created the conditions for demographic growth in the last 2,000 years .
a further consequence of which is the de - coupling of archaeological data from trajectories of environmental change , which was commonly observed in the pleistocene .
as conditions ameliorated after 2ka , these established societies were well - placed to re - colonise marginal habitats ( e.g. the wati language spread through the western deserts [ 2 ]) , and maximize energy returns , evident by the six - fold increase in population ( 1 person / 6km2 ) and utilization of the entire continent ( figs 2a and 3e ) .
regional differentiation of art styles and formalization of exchange networks dating to this period suggest environmental packing and the formation of strong territorial boundaries [ 2 , 3 , 7 , 77 ] , making movement between patches that would have been possible earlier in the holocene now unviable .
it is likely under these conditions , when large populations were unable to migrate , that social ( e.g. classificatory kin system ) and religious ( e.g. the ' dreaming ') systems were elaborated to provide a framework for negotiating ownership of finite patch resources and property within a given territory .
this in turn led to complexity [ 78 ] and social / hereditary inequality [ 18 ] , although neither were prominent in australia when compared with societies other in other continents .
importantly , the most recent millennium saw a short , sharp decline in ranging territory at around 0.75ka ( fig 3f ) coinciding with the re - establishment of modern enso frequency - - before a subdued expansion into the ethnographic period ( fig 2a and 2c ) .
at the same time , population and densely occupied sites reach their peaks , before similarly declining into the most recent period ( fig 2b and 2d ) .
campbell [ 79 ] suggested the introduction of disease from the macassans during this period resulting in the decimation of populations , and this may explain the breaking up of mbrs in the top end , kimberley and north western desert country in the last few hundred years ( fig 3f ) .
conclusions using archaeological radiocarbon data and advanced geospatial techniques , we explore the occupation and mobility of hunter - gatherers over the holocene epoch .
for the first time , we present a model of the timing , extent and nature of mobility across the australian continent with which to compare local and regional archaeological records .
however , we highlight the limitations of the analysis , including the complexity of radiocarbon data as a proxy , finite data in some time slices , automated processes , and disregard for local environmental situations ( see discussion in [ 80 ]) , but our intention is to produce a first - order framework for researchers to test .
we suggest that populations were extremely low following the lgm , and it was not until the early holocene that demographic growth and expansion out of refuges across the continent ( as per ifd models ) is evident .
we propose that resource abundance in the early - to - mid holocene ( 9 - 6ka ) allowed longer patch residence time , resulting in the development of low - level food production ( along with hunter - gathering strategies ) , and stimulating population growth .
populations began to fill the continent in the mid - holocene ( 6 - 4ka ) , restricting movement between productive patches , and initiating technological investment in resource procurement .
these technological systems intensified in the late holocene ( 4 - 0ka ) , sustaining populations and ultimately leading to environmental packing , despite climatic downturn .
after 2ka , demographic pressure inhibited mobility and restricted resource availability .
this resulted in increased territoriality , and the elaboration of social and religious systems to control resources ( similar to ideal despotic models observed elsewhere ) , an ancillary outcome of which was an increasingly complex society .
we highlight that environmental conditions between 9 - 6ka were similar to those in the levant and other places just prior to the transition to domestication ( e.g. [ 81 ]) .
in australia , where the classic arid zone ethnographies form the basis of discussion for many studies , there is no evidence of such a transition .
however , we would suggest that there is evidence of low - level food production throughout the mid - and late holocene , and in combination with early european explorer 's observations in the temperate regions ( e.g. huts and villages ) , suggest that this may be a mindset worthy of re - consideration .

data presented as 3 - point moving average ( equivalent to 750 years ) .
a statistical analysis of the overall dataset and the two subsets reveal close correlation over the last 20,000 years .
this can be seen most clearly in the holocene where all data shows similar trends , albeit at different magnitudes .

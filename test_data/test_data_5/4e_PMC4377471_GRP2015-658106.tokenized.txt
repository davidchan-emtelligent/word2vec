previous studies have established norms of 24 - hour gastric ph profiles for western countries .
this study was designed to establish the pattern for a rural african population with a high incidence of oesophageal cancer. methods .
after lower oesophageal manometry a probe was placed 10 cm distal to the lower oesophageal sphincter .
we carried out 24 - hour ambulatory monitoring of gastric ph on 59 healthy subjects .
this was satisfactorily completed on 26 female and 18 male ( age 21 - 64 , median 35 ) subjects in the transkei region of south africa. results .
the mean 24 hour gastric ph was 2.84 and the mean night - time ph was 3.7 .
40 volunteers recorded a night - time ph reaching over 4 .
33 volunteers recorded a night - time ph over 7 .
night - time alkalinisation was present for 136.4 minutes ( 25th centile 22.8 , 75th centile 208.1 ) at ph4 or over , and 79.3 ( 2.5 , 122.7 ) minutes at ph7 or over .
episodes of rapid alkaline rise were 17 ( 10 , 47 ) .
21.1 % of these occurred while supine .
35 of 36 tested subjects were positive for h. pylori igg. conclusion .
gastric alkalinisation is common in transkei , at a higher ph than that reported in other studies , and is sustained longer .
nighttime alkalinisation is frequent .
this suggests a high level of duodenogastric reflux .
1. introduction transkei , part of the eastern cape of south africa , is one of the three areas of the world with a very high reported incidence of squamous cancer of the oesophagus [ 1 , 2 ] .
there is as yet no universally accepted mechanism of causation in these areas , though many theories have been put forward [ 3 - 7 ] .
we have demonstrated in previous studies that the upper gastrointestinal tract in transkei differs in some indices from published norms [ 8 - 10 ] , and these differences may be related to oesophageal carcinogenesis .
this study was designed to establish the prevalent pattern of gastric ph over 24 hours within this community .
2. methods we obtained permission for the study from the research committee of walter sisulu university ( reference 00011a - 04 ) .
we recruited volunteers from healthy adult inhabitants of the area surrounding canzibe hospital in the rural transkei region of the eastern cape .
they were selected using a self - exclusion questionnaire and not based on diet , education , or income .
those with upper gastrointestinal complaints were eliminated .
healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 65 years with no past medical history of digestive disease or associated symptoms , diabetes , or neurological disease were recruited .
none were consuming drugs at the time of the investigation .
we recorded height and weight and calculated bmi .
we measured gastric ph using an antimony electrode .
the lower oesophageal sphincter was defined using a pressure transducer ( gaeltec , model ict / b ) using the station pull through technique .
the upper border of the sphincter was defined by a sudden increase of pressure compared to the esophageal body .
participants with no detectable les with this technique were excluded from the study .
the test was initiated after an overnight fast .
after location of the lower oesophageal sphincter by manometry , the probe was passed and the electrode was positioned 10 cm below the sphincter .
it was secured to the nose and face and connected to the recording device .
we instructed the subject on how to record meal times and supine episodes , and the participant was then allowed to go home for the 24 hours of the study .
gastric ph was sampled 50 times per second .
data was recorded in an ohmega ambulatory ph - impedance recorder and downloaded to a computer at the end of the recording period .
we carried out analysis visually and also using mms software version 8.19 ( medical measurements systems b.v. , netherlands ) .
we excluded meal times from analysis .
we defined a rapid alkaline rise as a rise in less than 10 seconds from a baseline of ph2 or less to a ph of 4 or more .
nighttime was taken as midnight to 6 am. we defined a nighttime ph of greater than 4 as nighttime alkalinisation and recorded the total lengths of time over ph4 and over ph7 .
we measured rapid alkaline rises visually .
other measures were provided by the software analysis programme .
we measured h. pylori serology using helicobacter pylori igg elisa kit ( eia3484 , drg international inc. ) .
this was carried out as a secondary investigation on all volunteers who were then available ( 80 % of volunteers ) .
we expressed nonparametric data as median , 25th and 75th centiles .
3. results 59 subjects were studied .
15 records were unusable because of a recording of less than 23 hours ( one ) , technical faults with the recording device ( five ) , probe misplacement ( one ) , and poorly recorded meal or supine periods ( eight ) .
recording times of the remaining 45 were 24 hours ( 43 records ) , 23h53 and 23h30 .
44 subjects had a minimum intragastric ph of 1.1 or less .
one had a minimum ph of 4.0 and was eliminated from the study .
26 were female and 18 were male .
median bmi was 25.3 ( range of 17.9 to 40.3 ) .
35 of 36 subjects analysed for h. pylori igg were positive .
figure 1 shows an aggregated hourly gastric ph for the 44 subjects .
the mean 24 - hour gastric ph was 2.84 .
the mean nighttime ph was 3.7 ( see table 1 and figure 1 ) .
there were many episodes of nighttime alkalinisation ( nta ) with plateaux of up to 9 - hour duration .
these were not related to food or liquid ingestion .
40 subjects recorded a nighttime ph reaching over 4 and 33 recorded a ph over 7 .
in 27 subjects , a nighttime ph of over 7 was present for over one hour and in 12 cases for over 2 hours ( see table 1 and figure 2 ) .
17 subjects achieved a ph of over 8 , with a range of duration of 6 seconds up to 130 minutes .
figure 2 shows examples of nighttime alkaline plateaux .
the median time in nta ph > 7 for all 44 volunteers was 96.3 minutes .
including only those ( 33 ) who did have nta > 7 , the median time was 107.1 minutes .
rapid rises of gastric ph are as demonstrated in figure 3 and the numbers are tabulated in table 1 .
occurrences were 17 ( 10 , 47 ) .
15.5 % occurred in the first hour of recording .
21.1 % occurred with the subject supine .
4. discussion probe placement is critical , with different ph patterns evident in various zones of the stomach [ 11 ] .
10 cm distal to the lower oesophageal sphincter , as used in this study , is described as midgastric or in the corpus [ 12 - 14 ] and is a standard measuring position .
this site is moderately influenced by antral fluid .
the ph is reproducible over a 24 - hour period [ 13 ] .
placement 5 cm distal to the lower oesophageal sphincter has been used in some studies [ 11 , 15 ] and produces results less influenced by the antral content and distinct from midgastric results [ 11 ] .
there were a relatively high number of unsatisfactory recordings .
reasons include the physical stress on the device and its cables being used in a rural setting where subjects must continue their daily living .
lack of familiarity with using electronic devices may account for the high number of failures to record meals and supine periods .
while the study was successful , the number of recording failures underlines the difficulties of such a study in rural africa .
several reported studies have included 35 or 36 volunteers [ 16 - 18 ] .
closure of this study at a total of 44 successful subjects provided data comparable with these studies .
we found a higher than usual mean gastric ph. the hourly gastric ph for the 24 - hour period is continuously over 2 .
other published graphs of composite or multiple subjects' hourly ph recordings show that it is mostly between ph1 and ph2 [ 13 , 19 ] .
published representative graphs of single subjects [ 15 , 20 , 21 ] also show a baseline ph between 1 and 2 .
studies with mean or median gastric ph are shown in table 2 and include figures from ph1.3 to ph2.39 [ 16 , 18 , 22 - 24 ] .
we found a prolonged nighttime rise in ph compared to other studies [ 13 - 15 , 19 , 20 , 25 ] , whose subjects showed brief periods of alkalinisation which were normally followed by a return to acidic ph. published figures for total time at > ph4 are 8.8 % to 20.03 % [ 12 , 16 , 17 , 22 , 26 ] ( see table 2 ) .
ours , at 22.2 % , is higher than all but only a little higher than the last value .
however roman et al .
[ 22 ] recorded a supine ph > 4 , 4.4 % of the time , compared with 26 % in our study .
in summary , daytime ph and 24 - hour profile are slightly raised compared with similar studies in north america / europe .
nighttime and supine ph are more markedly raised and clearly different from other published series .
this study had two measures compatible with duodenogastric reflux ( dgr ) .
first , the presence of rapid rises in ph which were not associated with food intake .
the rapid alkaline rises described have no adequate explanation apart from brief episodes of dgr .
the occurrence of dgr is regarded as a normal event ; however , we were not able to find sufficient published evidence to compare the rapid rises we found with other studies .
there was a disproportionate number ( 15.5 % of the 24 - hour total ) of rapid alkaline rises in the first hour after probe insertion , and this may reflect low - grade retching or gagging associated with reflux as the patient accommodated to the probe ; alternatively the rapid alkaline rises in this first phase may be associated with the fasting state .
the second possible measure of dgr is prolonged nonacid ph in the stomach .
an episode of raised intragastric ph unrelated to food ingestion has not generally been accepted as adequate evidence on its own of dgr .
verdu et al .
[ 27 ] concluded from their study that periods of high antral ph are often due to swallowed saliva , secretion of bicarbonate by the antral mucosa , and sequestration of the probe in the gastric mucosa .
marshall et al .
[ 26 ] added to this a combination of dgr and a reduction in meal - stimulated acid production occurring towards the end of the night .
verdu et al. ' s conclusion of the unreliability of ph evidence on its own is possibly biased by their use of ph3 as the alkaline threshold [ 27 ] .
ph > 4 is more frequently used as the threshold for gastric alkaline shift [ 14 , 26 , 27 ] .
brown et al .
[ 28 ] used a threshold ph of > 4 and found a sensitivity of 84 % for dgr compared with bile or amylase concentration .
fuchs et al .
[ 29 ] developed a 16 - variable computer programme which could reliably identify dgr using intragastric ph alone .
a normal pattern in other series is of nighttime alkaline peaks of ph4 - ph7 lasting a few minutes to about an hour [ 11 , 20 ] , best demonstrated in the antrum .
46 % of dgr episodes progress proximally to the fundus [ 14 ] .
barlow et al .
[ 11 ] presumed these waves of alkalisation were due to dgr since there was no evidence of parietal cell rest in the proximal stomach during these episodes .
furthermore the rapid change and progression proximally in the stomach does not fit with other proposed explanations which include swallowed saliva , secretion of bicarbonate by the antral mucosa , or sequestration of the probe in the gastric mucosa .
bjornsson and abrahamsson [ 30 ] , measuring antroduodenal pressures and gastric ph , concluded that nocturnal ph rises in the antrum are caused by duodenal retroperistalsis .
the common occurrence in this study , of extensive nighttime alkaline plateaux including many prolonged episodes over ph7 , and up to 9 - hour duration supports the contention that there is a comparatively high level of dgr in this community .
there is as yet no other data from africa to indicate whether the dgr shown in this study is within normal limits for an african rural population .
all but one of the volunteers was positive for h. pylori igg .
one volunteer was achlorhydric , and therefore her data was not included for analysis .
the minimum ph obtained for the remaining volunteers was all 1.1 or less .
positive serology does not prove current infection ; however , acid production may have been reduced by chronic h. pylori infection of the corpus .
tsai et al .
[ 31 ] showed a rise in median ph from control levels of 1.4 +/ - 0.1 to ph 1.6 +/ - 0.3 in those with h. pylori infection .
furuta et al .
[ 32 ] showed much greater reductions in acid production in subjects with active duodenal or gastric ulceration .
all of the final 44 volunteers of the current study demonstrated the ability to create a low intragastric ph at some stage during the 24 hr period .
most african studies report a high prevalence of h. pylori of 61 - 100 % [ 33 ] .
a study in bloemfontein in south africa [ 34 ] showed a rising prevalence during childhood , reaching 84.2 % by the age of 15 .
at 97 % , the prevalence rate in our volunteers is at the upper end of the spectrum .
chebib et al .
[ 35 ] found no correlation between the presence of h. pylori and enterogastric reflux ; however , h. pylori was present more frequently in patients with positive enterogastric reflux .
nakagawara et al .
[ 36 ] found that dgr facilitates the survival of h. pylori in the gastric stump after a gastrectomy .
while there is no published evidence that h. pylori causes or facilitates dgr , the possibility must be considered that in our population the high prevalence of h. pylori infection is encouraged by a high level of dgr .
dgr is associated with raised intragastric ph [ 14 , 28 , 37 ] .
there is a strong positive association of raised intragastric ph with nonacid gastroesophageal reflux [ 22 , 29 ] .
it is well established that pernicious anaemia and a postgastrectomy state are associated with reduced gastric acidity and also with squamous cancer of the oesophagus [ 38 , 39 ] .
iijima et al .
[ 40 ] demonstrated a risk for squamous cancer of the oesophagus of profound gastric hypochlorhydria after adjusting for the effect of gastric atrophy .
an important question is whether a raised intragastric ph of a different nature compared to either achlorhydria or profound hypochlorhydria , and such as found in our volunteers , is a risk factor for squamous cancer of the oesophagus , and if so in what circumstances .
the answer to this question is crucial for the community we have studied .
it is also important to elucidate further the relation between enterogastric and gastroesophageal reflux .
5. conclusion gastric alkalinisation is common in the sample population studied , at a higher ph than that reported in other studies of healthy subjects , and is sustained longer .
nighttime alkalinisation is particularly frequent .
there is neither achlorhydria nor profound hypochlorhydria .
this pattern is suggestive of a high level of duodenogastric reflux .
the presence of this pattern in an area of very high risk for squamous cancer of the oesophagus requires further investigation .

pre - transplant sensitization to human leukocyte antigens ( hla ) is a risk factor for graft failure .
studies of the immunological profile related to anti - hla antibodies in brazilian renal transplant candidates are few .
in this study , we evaluated the humoral immune response to hla antigens in 269 renal transplant candidates , in parana state , brazil .
the hla typing was performed by the polymerase chain reaction sequence - specific oligonucleotide method ( pcr - sso ) combined with luminex technology , using an sso - labtype commercial kit ( one lambda , inc. , canoga park , ca , usa ) .
the percentages of panel - reactive antibodies ( pra ) and the specificity of anti - hla antibodies were determined using the ls1pra and ls2pra commercial kits ( one lambda , inc. ) .
the pra - positive group consisted of 182 ( 67.7 %) patients , and the pra - negative group of 87 ( 32.3 %) patients .
the two groups differed significantly only with respect to gender .
females were the most sensitized .
among the 182 patients with pra - positive , 62 ( 34.1 %) were positive for class i and negative for class ii , 39 ( 21.4 %) were negative for class i and positive for class ii , and 81 ( 44.5 %) were positive for both classes i and ii. the hla - a * 02 , a * 24 , a * 01 , b * 44 , b * 35 , b * 15 , drb1 * 11 , drb1 * 04 and drb1 * 03 allele groups were the most frequent .
the specificities of anti - hla antibodies were more frequent : a34 , b57 , cw15 , cw16 , dr51 , dq8 and dp14 .
this study documented the profile of anti - hla antibodies in patients with chronic renal failure who were on waiting lists for an organ in parana , and found high sensitization to hla antigens in the samples .

introduction the importance of anti - human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) antibodies in organ transplantation has been known since the 1960s [ 1 ] .
many studies have shown that individuals who undergo a hyperacute rejection of an organ , or episodes of acute rejection , whether of the first or a subsequent graft , may contain anti - hla antibodies in their serum [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
these antibodies can be formed as a result of pregnancies [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] , blood transfusions [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , and previous transplants [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] .
detection of anti - hla antibodies is an important tool for successful transplantation [ 2 ] , [ 9 ] , since pre - transplant sensitization to hla antigens is a risk factor for graft failure [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
patients with high percentages of panel - reactive antibodies ( pra ) have a higher probability of rejection [ 10 ] - [ 12 ] .
studies on the immunological profile of anti - hla class i ( a , b and cw ) and class ii ( dr , dq and dp ) antibodies in brazilian renal transplant candidates are few , in particular in the state of parana , brazil .
this study evaluated the immune response to hla antigens in patients with chronic renal failure , renal transplant candidates , in northern and northwestern parana , southern brazil .
materials and methods patients the study was conducted with 269 patients with chronic renal failure , renal transplant candidates , from northern and northwestern parana in southern brazil .
only patients with updated records ( active patients / potential recipients ) were included .
data regarding demographic characteristics , and potential risk factors for the development of anti - hla antibodies ( transfusions , pregnancies and previous transplants ) were obtained from the records of dialysis clinics .
according to the results for the percentage of panel - reactive antibodies ( pra ) , the patients were divided into two groups , pra - negative ( pra = 0 ) and pra - positive ( pra > 0 ) .
subsequently , the pra - positive patients were divided into 2 groups according to the level of pra class i and class ii , considered separately .
the first group included patients with pra from 1 % to 50 % , and the second group included patients with pra between 51 % and 100 % .
this study was approved by the ethics committee of the universidade estadual de maringa , parana , brazil ( protocol no. 333 / 2011 ) .
all procedures followed resolution 196 / 1996 of the brazilian health council , which rules on research on humans in brazil .
all procedures were explained to each subject , and written informed consent was obtained from each subject .
dna extraction and hla class i and ii typing to perform the hla typing , 5 ml of peripheral blood was collected by venipuncture into vacuum tubes ( vacutainer , becton and dickson , oxford , england ) containing ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ) as an anticoagulant .
genomic dna extraction was performed by the separation column method , using a biopur commercial kit for dna extraction ( biometrix , curitiba , parana , brazil ) , following the manufacturer 's protocol .
after the concentration of the dna obtained was adjusted by the optical - density method , the polymerase chain reaction sequence - specific oligonucleotide method ( pcr - sso ) combined with luminex technology was carried out using sso - labtype hla class i ( hla - a , - b ) and class ii ( hla - drb1 ) commercial kits ( one lambda , inc. , canoga park , ca , usa ) , which provide low - to - medium resolution typing , following the manufacturer 's protocol .
in this method , genomic dna was amplified using a biotinylated sequencing primer locus - specific for hla class i ( hla - a and - b ) and class ii ( hla - drb1 ) in a geneamp pcr system 9700 thermocycler ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
subsequently , hybridization was performed with complementary dna probes conjugated to microspheres ( beads ) labeled with different fluorochromes to identify complementary sequences of the amplified dna .
after hybridization , the samples were read by means of the flow cytometry platform labscantm100 ( one lambda , inc. ) , followed by analysis by hla fusion software version 2.0 ( one lambda , inc. ) .
determination of percentages of panel - reactive antibodies ( pra ) and hla - specific antibodies the percentages of reactivity of panel - reactive antibodies ( pra ) and hla - specific antibodies were determined in sera from the patients , using the ls1pra and ls2pra commercial kits ( one lambda , inc. ) combined with the luminex technology , following the manufacturer 's protocol .
in this method , percentages of pra and hla - specific antibodies were identified using a panel of color - coded beads coated with purified hla antigens .
the test serum was first incubated with these beads .
any hla antibodies present in the test serum were bound to the antigens and then were labeled with r - phycoerythrin ( pe ) - conjugated goat anti - human igg .
the fluorescent emission of pe from each bead was detected using the flow cytometry platform labscantm100 ( one lambda , inc. ) , followed by analysis in hla fusion version 2.0 software ( one lambda , inc. ) using the fluorescence analysis minimum recommended by the manufacturer ( median fluorescence intensity equal to or greater than 500 ) .
statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed with statistica 7 software .
allele and phenotype frequencies were calculated by direct counting .
fisher 's exact test and student 's t test were used to compare the demographic characteristics and potential risk factors for the development of anti - hla antibodies among the study groups .
the significance level of the statistical test was 5 % ( p < 0.05 ) .
results the demographic characteristics and potential risk factors for the development of anti - hla antibodies , according to the pra results , are shown in table 1 .

for this reason , before transplantation , there is a need to ensure the best immunological compatibility between donor and recipient .
in addition to compatibility , it is necessary to determine the existence of preformed antibodies , since the presence of these antibodies in the recipient against the donor 's specific antigen , can result in a deleterious response to transplantation [ 1 ] , [ 9 ] .
therefore , the determination of the specificity of anti - hla antibodies in the serum is of paramount importance for patients with renal disease and transplant candidates .
this study provides the first data on the immunological profile of anti - hla class i ( a , b and cw ) and class ii ( dr , dq and dp ) antibodies and the percentage of pra in renal transplant candidates from southern brazil .
the production of anti - hla antibodies occurs as a result of sensitizing events [ 4 ] - [ 8 ] , and individuals may differ in the development of these antibodies .
unlike the results of studies conducted in other countries [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] , most of the patients in this study were positive for pra ( 67.7 %) .
however , the methodologies used to determine the pra differ among studies .
the high number of patients sensitized to hla antigens can also be explained , in part , by the practice , in brazil , of performing blood transfusions in both hypersensitive and non - sensitized patients without regard to the high probability of generating anti - hla antibodies .
silva et al .
[ 17 ] reported high rates of leukocyte alloimmunization ( 30.5 %) in a study conducted with 393 patients awaiting kidney transplantation in northeastern brazil .
in the present study , the percentage of sensitized patients was higher than that found by silva et al .
[ 17 ] .
one possible explanation could lie in the different methodologies used to determine the pra .
silva et al. used a complement - dependent microlymphocytotoxicity test sensitized with human antiglobulin , and the sera were tested against panel - reactive antibodies ( pra ) consisting of 50 individuals phenotyped with hla class i antigens .
human leukocyte antigen alloimmunization in candidates for renal transplantation is a reality [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] and knowledge of the incidence of sensitization to hla antigens in the brazilian population may be important for advances in renal transplantation and to minimize the waiting time for candidates [ 19 ] .
several studies have reported that pregnancies , blood transfusions and previous transplants are potential risk factors for development of anti - hla antibodies [ 6 ] , [ 20 ] .
the vast majority of patients investigated in the present study had received blood transfusions ( 59.5 %) , some patients had received previous transplants ( 7.4 %) , and most women had had pregnancies ( 79.4 %) .
pregnancy as an immunogenic factor inducing the mother to produce antibodies against the father 's antigens , which are carried by the fetus , has been reported in several studies [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
heise et al .
( 2001 ) [ 14 ] , ozdemir et al .
( 2004 ) [ 15 ] , and karahan et al .
( 2009 ) [ 16 ] found an association between pregnancy and the production of anti - hla antibodies .
in this study , the vast majority of female patients had been pregnant and had become sensitized in this process .
however , in the present study , the pra - positive and negative groups did not differ in this potential risk factor for the development of anti - hla antibodies .
a possible explanation could lie in the presence of maternal hla compatibility with the father , or the degree of immunogenicity of hla antigens that the mother may have contacted through the fetus .
blood transfusion remains an important factor in patients on hemodialysis .
although the use of recombinant human erythropoietin in hemodialysis patients has resulted in improved hemoglobin levels and ameliorated the symptoms of anemia , significantly reducing the number of transfusions required , its use does not completely eliminate the need for blood transfusions in patients [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] .
a few patients in the study had undergone previous transplants .
great progress has been made in organ transplantation , both in immunosuppressive therapy and in pretransplant laboratory tests .
this progress is reflected in the reduced number of rejections , consequently reducing the number of patients who return to the waiting queue after an unsuccessful transplantation .
phelan et al .
( 2012 ) [ 24 ] followed 2381 kidney transplants , and observed that only 190 patients suffered a rejection .
the same authors reported a decrease in cases of rejection over the years , from 7 % in 1990 to less than 1 % in 2009 .
however , in the present study , the pra - positive and negative groups did not differ in potential risk factors for the development of anti - hla antibodies , in contrast to findings in studies conducted in other countries [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] .
however , this study was conducted with a sample of brazilian patients with chronic renal failure , also differing from other studies , because of the relatively larger number of patients with a positive pra compared with those with a negative pra .
this study also used a different methodology for determination of pra and anti - hla antibodies .
among the pra - positive patients , a high proportion were positive for both classes ( i and ii ) of anti - hla antibodies .
consequently , as expected , the number of hla loci to which the antibodies were reactive was also high in the group with a pra between 51 % and 100 % ( group 2 ) , in comparison with the pra group of 1 % to 50 % ( group 1 ) , for the two classes of anti - hla antibodies .
in this study also , a significant proportion of patients with a positive pra showed values between 51 % and 100 % , demonstrating a high degree of sensitization to hla in both class i and class ii. the present study also found hypersensitized patients ( patients with pra greater or equal to 80 ) .
patients with high percentages of pra may have a higher probability of rejection [ 10 ] - [ 12 ] .
our study also documented the frequency anti - hla - cw and anti - hla - dp antibodies , which are generally little explored in studies of antibody profiles .
the clinical significance of pre - transplant anti - hla - cw and anti - hla - dp has not been widely investigated , although studies have now reported the effect of hla - cw and - dp on the survival of the renal graft .
patients with mismatched hla - cw showed an increase in the likelihood of acute rejection [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , hyperacute rejection [ 27 ] , acute antibody - mediated rejection [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , and chronic rejection [ 30 ] in the presence of anti - hla - cw. qiu et al .
( 2005 ) [ 31 ] detected a higher frequency of anti - hla - dp in patients who rejected their grafts than in those with functioning grafts , finding anti - hla - dp in 5.1 % of 138 renal transplant recipients with functioning grafts , and 19.5 % of 185 patients with rejected grafts .
they called attention to the fact that 13 % of patients who had rejected the graft had only anti - hla - dp antibodies [ 31 ] .
several studies have reported acute rejection [ 28 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] and antibody - mediated chronic rejection [ 34 ] in renal transplant recipients , in the presence of anti - hla - dp. these occurrences emphasize the importance of knowledge of the specificities of these antibodies , in order to improve graft survival .
the frequency of hla allele groups in this study was similar to that in healthy subjects from southern brazil [ 35 ] - [ 37 ] .
the brazilian population is one of the most heterogeneous in the world , consisting of various ethnic groups [ 38 ] , and the frequencies of hla alleles may vary according to the predominant ethnic group in a region [ 36 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
the samples tested in this study were from the state of parana in southern brazil .
southern brazil was settled mainly by europeans , but also has significant numbers of people of african descent and native americans in the population [ 39 ] .
this influence can be observed in the results of this study , which revealed a predominant contribution of hla allele groups of european origin , such as hla - a * 24 and - b * 44 [ 41 ] - [ 43 ] , as well as the occurrence of allele groups of african influence such as hla - a * 30 and - b * 15 [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
the most common hla allele groups were hla - a * 02 , - a * 24 , - a * 01 , - b * 44 , - b * 35 , - b * 15 , - drb1 * 11 , - drb1 * 04 and - drb1 * 13 .
in contrast , the specificities of anti - hla loci for a , b and dr were frequently a34 , a24 , a68 , b57 , b58 , b27 , dr51 , dr12 and dr9 .
there were similarities but also differences among the hla allele groups , and the specificities of anti - hla antibodies found in this study .
this pattern is in agreement with the results found in another study of correlations between the frequency of hla antigens and anti - hla antibodies in renal transplant candidates [ 46 ] .
hla mismatch generally produces an antibody specific to that antigen .
one would expect that the frequency of a specificity of anti - hla antibody would correlate naturally with the frequency of the phenotype in the population , or if a hla phenotype is present in low frequency in the population , antibodies specific for this phenotype would also be rare .
however , idica et al. , 2006 [ 47 ] showed that immunization against low - frequency phenotypes may occur frequently , in agreement with the results found here .
in the present study , relatively rare antigens such as a34 , a68 , b58 , dr9 , dr12 were among those that most induced the production of anti - hla antibodies .
this finding can also be explained by the mixture of ethnic groups , leading to a variety of combinations of hla alleles and haplotypes in the population , and increasing the likelihood of hla incompatibilities and sensitization to hla antigens .
heise et al .
( 2001 ) [ 14 ] and karahan et al .
( 2009 ) [ 16 ] showed that certain hla phenotypes may be associated with the development of anti - hla antibodies in patients with chronic renal failure .
karahan et al .
( 2009 ) [ 16 ] showed that the frequencies of the hla - a3 , hla - a66 and hla - b18 phenotypes were significantly elevated in pra - positive patients compared to pra - negative patients , and the drb1 * 07 allele was more frequent in patients with a history of events and no production of anti - hla antibodies , suggesting that drb1 * 07 may be associated with a low risk of formation of anti - hla antibodies .
heise et al .
( 2001 ) [ 14 ] found a positive association for the development of anti - hla antibodies with hla class i phenotypes ( hla - a10 , - a19 , - a36 , - b42 and - b53 ) , and negative associations with hla class i phenotypes ( a1 , a2 , a11 , b8 , b12 , b40 ) and class ii phenotypes ( dr1 , dr4 , dr7 ) .
the same study found that the dr3 phenotype was associated with high values of pra and lower rates of graft survival , and the dr1 and dr4 phenotypes were associated with low values of pra and good graft survival .
however , some phenotypes such as hla - a2 and hla - b18 , which showed positive or negative associations in these studies , are common both in the chronic renal failure patients in this study and in populations of healthy individuals [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
these studies emphasize the importance of knowledge of hla diversity and the profile of antibodies to the hla system , in the context of organ and tissue transplantation .
the limitations of this study consist particularly in the use of small sample sizes , and in the difficulties in obtaining relevant information ( pregnancies , blood transfusions and previous transplants ) , because the majority of hemodialysis clinics and transplant centers in brazil do not have a system for efficient data storage , updating and retrieval of this information .
despite these limitations , this study provided important data on sensitization to hla antigens , including pre - transplant anti - hla - cw and anti - hla - dp sensitization , which is little explored in studies of anti - hla antibody profiles .
conclusions the data from this study document the profile of anti - hla antibodies in chronic renal failure patients on the waiting list for an organ in northern and northwestern parana , showing a high proportion of sensitization to hla antigens ( positive pra ) .
evaluation of the immune response to hla antigens in the pre - transplant workup may contribute to future studies of the association of hla alleles with the development of anti - hla antibodies in brazilian patients , patients with chronic kidney disease , and for the understanding of future events related to the acceptance or rejection of grafts .
we would like to thank all patients involved in this study .

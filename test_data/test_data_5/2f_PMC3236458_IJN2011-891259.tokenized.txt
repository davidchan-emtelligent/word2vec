blood flow rate ( bfr ) < 300 ml / min commonly is used to define hemodialysis catheter dysfunction and the need for interventions to prevent complications .
the objective of this study was to describe patterns of unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min during catheter hemodialysis using data from davita dialysis facilities and the united states renal data system .
patients were included if they received at least eight weeks of hemodialysis exclusively through a catheter between 08 / 04 and 12 / 06 , and catheter hemodialysis was the first treatment modality following diagnosis of end - stage renal disease ( first access ) , or it immediately followed at least one 30 - day period of dialysis exclusively through a fistula or graft ( replacement access ) .
actual bfr < 300 ml / min despite a planned bfr >= 300 ml / min defined catheter dysfunction during each dialysis session .
there were 3,364 patients , 268,363 catheter dialysis sessions , and 19,118 ( 7.1 %) sessions with catheter dysfunction .
almost two - thirds of patients had >= 1 catheter dysfunction session , and 30 % had >= 1 catheter dysfunction session per month .
patients with catheter as a replacement access had a higher rate of catheter dysfunction than those with a catheter as first access ( hazard ratio : 1.13 ; p = 0.04 ) .
catheter dysfunction affects almost one - third of catheter dialysis patients each month and two - thirds overall .
1. introduction hemodialysis catheter dysfunction often is defined as blood flow rate ( bfr ) < 300 ml / min [ 1 ] , including in the national kidney foundation 's kidney disease outcome quality initiative ( nkf - kdoqi ) clinical practice guidelines [ 2 ] .
other definitions of catheter dysfunction reported in the literature include frequent arterial and venous pressure alarms , poor conductance , and poor dialysis efficiency based on urea reduction ratio or kt / v calculations [ 3 - 8 ] .
among these definitions , the one recommended by nkf - kdoqi may be of particular significance to providers and payers .
this is especially true in the united states , where nkf - kdoqi guidelines play a prominent role in shaping clinical practice , including through the centers for medicare and medicaid services' ( cms ) end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) clinical performance measures project [ 9 ] .
since the recommendation to define catheter dysfunction as bfr < 300 ml / min was opinion based , concerns have been raised that it has been interpreted to mean bfr must be kept above 300 ml / min to maintain adequate dialysis .
however , one recent study showed that mean blood flows < 300 ml / min were not commonly associated with dialysis inadequacy [ 1 ] , prompting the authors to conclude that this definition of catheter dysfunction could result in a significant number of unnecessary interventions .
presently , there is very little information on the epidemiology of hemodialysis catheter dysfunction defined as bfr < 300 ml / min .
one exception is a study by moist and colleagues on the association between bfr and dialysis adequacy , which found that mean blood flow < 300 ml / min occurred in 10 % of patients [ 1 ] .
however , this was a cross - sectional study of only 259 patients conducted at two university - based tertiary hemodialysis care programs .
data on bfr are not present in the united states renal data system ( usrds ) , and they are not collected as part of the cms esrd clinical performance measures project .
without first understanding the epidemiology of catheter dysfunction defined according to nkf - kdoqi guidelines , it is difficult to assess the potential impact of this guideline on clinical outcomes and on interventions , both necessary and unnecessary .
the objective of this study was to describe patterns of hemodialysis catheter dysfunction , defined as unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min , in a large cohort of esrd patients .
2. methods 2.1 .
study design and setting an observational cohort study was performed using clinical and administrative data from davita inc. , merged with administrative and medicare claims data from the usrds .
davita owns and operates more than 1,400 outpatient dialysis facilities in the united states and has acute units in more than 700 hospitals .
facilities are located in 43 states and the district of columbia .
nationwide , davita serves approximately 110,000 patients .
the davita clinical data warehouse is a repository for detailed demographic , treatment , medication , and laboratory information .
information is available for each patient 's individual dialysis sessions , allowing the investigator to reconstruct detailed longitudinal treatment histories .
the usrds is a national data system that collects , analyzes , and distributes information about esrd in the united states [ 10 ] .
it contains demographic , diagnosis , and treatment history information for all medicare beneficiaries with esrd , a point - prevalent cohort of approximately 570,000 in the second quarter of 2009 [ 11 ] .
also , it contains 100 % of medicare inpatient and outpatient bills for these patients .
presently , medicare part d oral medication claims are not included .
the data set used in this project was composed of a point - prevalent dialysis patient population in august 2004 , with a maximum follow - up period through december 31 , 2006 .
2.2 .
participants patients meeting the following criteria were included in this study : they received at least eight continuous weeks of hemodialysis exclusively through a catheter between august 1 , 2004 , and december 31 , 2006 ; either catheter hemodialysis was their first treatment modality following diagnosis of esrd ( catheter as first access ) , or catheter hemodialysis immediately followed at least one month during which the patient was dialyzed exclusively through an arteriovenous fistula or graft ( catheter as replacement access ) ; in the first eight weeks of catheter dialysis , they did not have a gap between two consecutive outpatient dialysis sessions > 30 days during which time they were not hospitalized ; they had both part a and part b medicare coverage during the entire catheter dialysis period ; they did not have a kidney transplant during the entire catheter dialysis period ; at least 95 % of their catheter dialysis sessions had actual and planned blood flow rates between 100 ml / min and 500 ml / min ; they were alive and in the data set for at least 90 days following the first catheter dialysis session .
planned and actual bfr values < 100 ml / min or > 500 ml / min were set to missing to minimize the potential impact of coding errors .
in the final cohort , 99.9 % of bfr values were within this range .
the observation period was defined as beginning at the first catheter dialysis session and ending at the last catheter dialysis session that was uninterrupted by either a change in access or dialysis modality .
2.3 .
variables using davita data , we reconstructed a longitudinal history of catheter dialysis treatments for each patient during their observation period .
reasons for reaching the end of the observation period were defined as ( a ) death , if the patient died on or before december 31 , 2006 , and if the last catheter dialysis session was within 30 days of death , ( b ) end of data ( censored ) , if the last catheter dialysis session was within 30 days of december 31 , 2006 , or ( c ) change in access type or modality , if the last observed catheter dialysis session was not due to either death or the end of the data .
the primary outcome variable was catheter dysfunction , which was defined as actual bfr < 300 ml / min despite a planned bfr >= 300 ml / min .
actual bfr was measured approximately one hour after the beginning of the dialysis session .
we elected to make our definition of catheter dysfunction more restrictive than in the nkf / kdoqi clinical practice guidelines for vascular access to eliminate misclassification of catheter dysfunction where the intent , as indicated by planned bfr , was to provide bfr < 300 ml / min .
medical resource and cost outcome variables in this study were total direct medical costs to medicare , missed dialysis sessions due to access problems , access - related procedures , and all - cause hospitalization .
the davita data contained a record for each missed session .
each record had the date of the missed session and the reason for the missed session , including " access problems. " access - related procedures were identified using the medicare claims data , based on the following health care common procedure coding system ( hcpcs ) codes : injection for catheter evaluation with fluoroscopy ( 36598 ) ; thrombolytic declotting of catheter ( 36593 ) ; mechanical removal of clot ( 36596 ) ; mechanical removal of intraluminal ( intracatheter ) obstructive material ( 75902 ) ; injection of " tpa " ( j2997 ) ; tunneled catheter exchange or replacement ( 36581 ) ; the combination of removal of tunneled catheter ( 36589 ) plus tunneled catheter insertion ( 36558 ) .
hospitalizations consisted of all acute care admissions for any reason and were identified from the medicare claims .
2.4 .
analyses patients were described according to their demographic and clinical characteristics at the time they began catheter dialysis , including age , gender , race , underlying cause of renal failure , dialysis vintage , esrd network , charlson comorbidity index [ 12 ] , and whether catheter was their first dialysis access or a replacement for a graft or fistula .
multivariate analysis with cox 's proportional hazards model was used to examine adjusted associations between patient factors and the risk of catheter dysfunction .
for the medical resource and cost analyses , patients with at least one catheter dysfunction session were divided into quintiles based on the number of catheter dysfunction sessions per month on catheter dialysis .
medical resource use and costs were compared , unadjusted , across the five groups .
analysis file construction and all analyses were performed in sas ( version 9.1.3 ) [ 13 ] .
3. results there were 3,364 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria .
the average age was 62 years , 51 % were male gender , 42 % were black race , 46 % had diabetes , and 28 % had hypertension reported as the underlying cause of renal failure ( table 1 ) .
patients with catheter as a replacement access were older , had been diagnosed with esrd for a longer period of time , and had higher charlson comorbidity index scores [ 12 ] .
those with catheter as first access were more likely to be white race .
within the catheter as replacement group , patients with catheter replacing a graft were older , had higher charlson comorbidity index scores , and were more likely to be female gender and black race , compared to those with catheter replacing a fistula .
overall , the median duration of catheter dialysis in the cohort was 143 days , the first 56 days of which were mandated by the eligibility criteria .
the median duration of catheter dialysis was significantly longer for those with catheter as first access compared to replacement access ( 159 days versus 138 days : p < 0.0001 by log rank ) ( figure 1 ) .
among those with catheter as a replacement access , there was no difference between those with prior graft ( median 139 days ) and those with prior fistula ( median 136 days : p = 0.84 by log rank ) .
the cohort accounted for more than 23,000 patient - months of catheter dialysis , with the majority in the catheter as replacement access group ( table 2 ) .
almost two - thirds of patients had at least one dialysis session with an unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min , the study definition of catheter dysfunction , during their entire catheter dialysis history .
proportions were similar between catheter as first and catheter as replacement access and between prior graft and prior fistula in the catheter replacement access group .
the median time to first dialysis session with unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min was longer , but not significantly longer ( p = 0.08 by log rank ) in the catheter as first access group ( figure 2 ) .
also the rate per patient month at risk ( figure 3 ) and the percent of patients with at least one session per month with unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min ( figure 4 ) were lower in the catheter as first access group , especially after the first 9 months of catheter dialysis .
patients with at least one session meeting the study definition of catheter dysfunction had , on average , nine sessions with unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min .
( table 2 ; figure 5 ) .
in the multivariate analysis using cox 's proportional hazards model for time to first session with catheter dysfunction , male gender and black race ( compared to white ) were associated with lower rates of catheter dysfunction ( table 3 ) .
catheter as replacement access following graft or fistula was associated with a significantly higher rate of catheter dysfunction than catheter as first access .
there was also considerable variability in the rate of catheter dysfunction across esrd networks .
patients in the highest quintile of catheter dysfunction sessions per month had higher average monthly direct medical costs , more missed sessions due to access problems , and more access - related procedures than those in the lowest quintile ( table 4 ) .
hospitalization rates were similar across the five groups .
4. discussion little has been reported on the epidemiology of hemodialysis catheter dysfunction , commonly defined , including in nkf - kdoqi guidelines , as bfr < 300 ml / min .
without understanding the epidemiology of catheter dysfunction so defined , it is not possible to assess the overall impact of the nkf - kdoqi guideline on clinical and economic outcomes .
presently , data on bfr are not collected within the usrds , or as part of cms 's esrd clinical performance measures project .
therefore , davita clinical data linked to medicare administrative , and claims data provided a unique opportunity to examine catheter dysfunction in this population .
we conducted an observational study in a large cohort of patients who accounted for more than 23,000 months of catheter dialysis and 268,000 catheter dialysis sessions .
although not intended to be a random sample of all esrd patients undergoing catheter dialysis in the united states , our cohort was geographically diverse and demographically similar to the prevalent esrd population in 2004 , the year our study began .
our findings indicate that unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min is common , occurring at least once in almost two - thirds of patients who undergo catheter dialysis for more than eight weeks , and occurring in approximately one - third of patients every month .
further , the findings indicate that unplanned bfr < 300 ml / min occurs in approximately 7 % of all catheter dialysis sessions .
having catheter access as a replacement for a graft or fistula is associated with a higher risk of catheter dysfunction compared to catheter as the first type of access for dialysis .
also , having more catheter dysfunction sessions per month is associated with higher direct medical costs , interruptions or delays in dialysis services , and higher rates of catheter access procedures .
there are several possible reasons why the rates we observed may underestimate the true rates .
first , we excluded sessions in which planned or actual bfr values were either < 100 ml / min or > 500 ml / min .
we did so to avoid misclassifying as catheter dysfunction sessions in which bfr values were misreported in the data .
second , although nkf / kdoqi defines catheter dysfunction as bfr < 300 ml / min , our definition was more conservative because we also required the planned bfr to be >= 300 ml / min .
third , actual bfr was obtained from a single measurement approximately one hour after the beginning of the session .
fourth , by requiring patients to have at least eight weeks of catheter dialysis and to have survived at least 90 days following the start of dialysis , we excluded patients who were on catheter dialysis for shorter periods of time or who died within 90 days of beginning catheter dialysis .
to the extent that catheter dysfunction is more common sooner after placement , by excluding patients with short - term catheter dialysis , we may have underestimated the overall rate of dysfunction .
catheter dysfunction due to mechanical reasons , which is known to occur sooner rather than later after placement , may be disproportionately underrepresented .
also , if death during the first 90 days after catheter placement is related to serious complications of catheter dysfunction , such as bloodstream infection , by requiring at least 90 - day survival , we may have underestimated the impact of catheter dysfunction on the use of medical services , in particular on all - cause hospitalization .
in spite of these limitations , our findings suggest that catheter hemodialysis bfr < 300 ml / min is common in routine dialysis care and that it impacts on the provision of dialysis services , as well as catheter - related procedures and medical costs .
it is uncertain how much of the disruption in dialysis services and utilization of medical services was based solely on the perceived need to maintain bfr > 300 ml / min to ensure adequate dialysis and how much was based on observed problems with dialysis adequacy .

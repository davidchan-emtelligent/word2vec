elevated pco2 and warming are generally expected to influence cyanobacterial growth , and may promote the formation of blooms .
yet , both climate change factors may also influence cyanobacterial mortality by favoring pathogens , such as viruses , which will depend on the ability of the host to adapt .
to test this hypothesis , we grew plectonema boryanum iu597 under two temperature ( 25 and 29degreesc ) and two pco2 ( 400 and 800 muatm ) conditions for 1 year , after which all treatments were re - exposed to control conditions for a period of 3 weeks .
at several time points during the 1 year period , and upon re - exposure , we measured various infection characteristics of it associated cyanophage pp , including the burst size , latent period , lytic cycle and the efficiency of plaquing ( eop ) .
as expected , elevated pco2 promoted growth of p. boryanum equally over the 1 year period , but warming did not .
burst size increased in the warm treatment , but decreased in both the elevated pco2 and combined treatment .
the latent period and lytic cycle both became shorter in the elevated pco2 and higher temperature treatment , and were further reduced by the combined effect of both factors .
efficiency of plaquing ( eop ) decreased in the elevated pco2 treatment , increased in the warm treatment , and increased even stronger in the combined treatment .
these findings indicate that elevated pco2 enhanced the effect of warming , thereby further promoting the virus infection rate .
the re - exposure experiments demonstrate adaptation of the host leading to higher biomass build - up with elevated pco2 over the experimental period , and lower performance upon re - exposure to control conditions .
similarly , virus burst size and eop increased when given warm adapted host , but were lower as compared to the control when the host was re - exposed to control conditions .
our results demonstrate that adaptation but particularly physiological acclimation to climate change conditions favored viral infections , while limited host plasticity and slow adaptation after re - exposure to control conditions impeded host biomass build - up and viral infections .
climate change cyanobacterial virus infectivity one - step growth curve eop common garden experiment national natural science foundation of china10.13039 / 5011000018093120038531370148 introduction the climate is changing at an unprecedented rate , and atmospheric pco2 is predicted to have doubled from 400 muatm today to 800 muatm by the end of this century .
elevated pco2 , together with increases in concentrations of other greenhouse gases , is predicted to enhance the average global temperature by up to 4.8degreesc ( stocker et al. , 2013 ) .
phytoplankton play a key role in global carbon cycling , and contribute to approximately 50 % of the co2 fixed by the entire biosphere ( field et al. , 1998 ) .
photosynthesis and carbon fixation are expected to increase further with elevated pco2 in both marine ( hein and sand - jensen , 1997 ) as well as freshwater ecosystems ( verspagen et al. , 2014a ) .
elevated pco2 may particularly favor photosynthesis and growth of cyanobacteria , as they feature among the lowest affinity enzymes for carbon fixation , i.e. , ribulose - 1,5 - bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase ( rubisco ) type 1d ( badger et al. , 2006 ; raven et al. , 2008 ) .
cyanobacterial blooms are furthermore associated to warm conditions , and it is thus this phytoplankton group that may be particularly favored by climate change ( paerl and huisman , 2009 ; carey et al. , 2012 ; kosten et al. , 2012 ; o'neil et al. , 2012 ) .
the responses of cyanobacteria to climate change will also depend on their adaptive abilities ( walworth et al. , 2016 ) .
earlier studies , however , did not find evidence for evolutionary change toward elevated pco2 in two freshwater cyanobacteria species ( low - decarie et al. , 2013 ) , while data on warming effects seems currently lacking .
the success of phytoplankton species in future waters will not only depend on their growth and abilities to adapt , but also on mortality factors , notably their pathogens , such as viruses ( suttle , 2007 ) .
viruses control the structure of entire phytoplankton communities as they play a key role in regulating host population densities , the cycling of carbon and nutrients ( fuhrman , 1999 ; weinbauer , 2004 ; jover et al. , 2014 ) , as well as in host evolution via horizontal gene transfer ( thompson et al. , 2011 ) and genotype selection ( suttle , 2007 ) .
cyanophages ( i.e. , cyanobacteria viruses ) have been reported for a wide range of species , including notorious toxin producers , such as nodularia , dolichospermum ( formerly anabaena ; wacklin et al. , 2009 ) , planktothrix , aphanizomenon and microcystis ( jenkins and hayes , 2006 ; yoshida et al. , 2006 ; gao et al. , 2012 ; ou et al. , 2015 ; sulcius et al. , 2015 ) , and were reported to remove up to 97 % of the potential filamentous cyanobacterial production in a shallow eutrophic lake ( tijdens et al. , 2008 ) .
climate change may alter virus - host interactions , and will thereby affect the functioning of aquatic food - webs ( danovaro et al. , 2011 ) .
elevated pco2 and warming were reported to have a range of effects on the viral infection of phytoplankton .
for instance , elevated pco2 may enhance ( zhou et al. , 2015 ) or inhibit ( larsen et al. , 2008 ) viral infections , while some studies also reported a lack of effect ( maat et al. , 2014 ). with respect to infection characteristics , burst size was shown to increase ( carreira et al. , 2013 ; zhou et al. , 2015 ) or decrease ( traving et al. , 2014 ) with elevated pco2 , and also the latent period did not show unambiguous results even within a single virus - host system ( traving et al. , 2014 ) .
comparably , warming was shown to cause an increase in infections , as indicated by enhanced virus concentrations ( honjo et al. , 2007 ; chu et al. , 2011 ; mankiewicz - boczek et al. , 2016 ) , but may also reduce infections , depending on the specific virus ( tomaru et al. , 2014 ) , as well as on temperature dependent host resistance ( kendrick et al. , 2014 ) .
the effects of elevated pco2 and warming on virus - host interactions have thus been investigated in various host species from distinct ecosystems , yet results remain ambiguous and only little is known about their combined effects over different temporal scales .
elevated pco2 combined with warming were shown to affect key phytoplankton traits , such as enhanced growth rates with reduced cell sizes ( fiorini et al. , 2011 ) , increased carbon : nutrient ratios ( fu et al. , 2007 , 2008 ; muller et al. , 2014 ; verspagen et al. , 2014b ; paul et al. , 2015 ) , and enhanced primary production ( holding et al. , 2015 ) .
viruses rely on their host cells for reproduction , and the success of an infection thus strongly depends on the physiological status of a host ( mojica and brussaard , 2014 ) .
in other words , conditions enhancing growth of a host , may also promote growth of their virus .
consequently , we predict that elevated pco2 and warming will facilitate viral infections of a cyanobacterial host , and that their combined effect will be synergistic .
moreover , with a generation time of about 2 days we expect that host cells will adapt over a 1 year period under the imposed conditions , as this covers over 150 generations , which will further enhance viral infections .
to test these hypotheses , we exposed the freshwater cyanobacterium plectonema boryanum to elevated pco2 , warming and a combination of both , and followed key physiological traits of the host and its cyanophage over 1 year period , as well as after re - exposure to control conditions .
more specifically , traits of the host included growth rate , cell size and chlorophyll - a contents , which are key parameters indicating host fitness .
for the cyanophage , we assessed the latent period ( the period from host infection to initial phage release ) , the lytic cycle ( the period from host infection to complete phage release ) , and burst size ( the average number of phages released from a single infected host cell ) .
moreover , we tested the efficiency of plaquing ( eop ) , which is proportion of cyanophages that can successfully infect to host in 1 h. materials and methods cyanophage and cyanobacteria cyanophage pp is a podovirus with a linear , double - stranded dna genome that has been frequently detected at high levels in many eutrophic lakes in china ( cheng et al. , 2007 ) .
the experiments were performed with a cyanophage pp lysate containing > 108 plaque forming units ( pfu ) ml - 1 that was stored at 4degreesc .
the cyanobacterium p. boryanum iu597 , obtained from the fachb - collection , wuhan city , china , was cultivated in aa medium ( allen and arnon , 1955 ) , with 30 mumol photons m - 2 s - 1 white light ( philips , lifemax tld 36w / 865 , china ) and a 12:12 h light : dark cycle .
experiments were performed in 200 ml growth medium in triplicate , and incubated in self - made chambers at different combinations of pco2 and temperatures : 400 muatm pco2 and 25degreesc ( control ) , 400 muatm pco2 , and 29degreesc ( warm treatment ) , 800 muatm pco2 and 25degreesc ( elevated pco2 treatment ) , and 800 muatm pco2 and 29degreesc ( combined treatment ) .
additional co2 for the elevated pco2 treatment was supplied to the headspace , and was measured using a telaire 7001 co2 sensor ( usa ) .
initial ph reflected the co2 treatments with values of 6.72 , 6.71 , 6.50 , and 6.52 , for the control , warm , elevated pco2 and combined treatment , respectively .
to prevent transient effects of elevated pco2 and warming on host growth , p. boryarum was conditioned to the above treatments for 1 year during which the cultures were re - inoculated by diluting the cell density to 2.0 x 106 cells ml - 1 with aa medium every 15 days .
then , the cultures in each condition were all re - exposed to the control condition for a period of 3 weeks ( i.e. , a common garden experiment ) .
host growth and viral infectivity were tested at 6 , 9 , and 1 year within 1 year and also after the re - exposure to control conditions .
cells were counted and cell size was measured by microscopy ( e600 , nikon , japan ) using a hemocytometer , and the chlorophyll - a ( chl - a ) concentration was measured by acetone extraction ( chen et al. , 2005 ) at day 7 .
the growth rate of the host ( mu ) was calculated assuming exponential growth based on cell numbers at the start of the experiment and at day 7 according to : mu = ln ( x7 ) - ln ( x0 ) t7 - t0 where x7 and x0 represent p. boryarum cell densities at day 7 ( i.e. , t7 ) and day 0 ( i.e. , t0 ) , respectively .
all experiments started with the same initial cell densities ( i.e. , t0 ) of 2.0 x 107 cells ml - 1 by dilution with aa medium. p. boryarum cultures were subsequently used to assess key viral traits , including latent period , lytic cycle , and the average burst size with one - step growth assays , and eop with plaque assays .
one - step growth assay the one - step growth assays were performed to assess the latent period , lytic cycle , and the average burst size .
the effect of initial multiplicity of infection ( moi , i.e. , the number of phages per host cell ) on the latent period and burst size is specific for any particular virus - host system ( sulcius et al. , 2015 ) .
the moi is typically set at about 1 phage per host cell for uni - or bicellular hosts to avoid host cell infection by more than one phage , and also to ensure that most of the cells will be infected in only one step ( bratbak et al. , 1998 ; yoshida et al. , 2006 ) .
however , p. boryanum used in our study grows in trichomes , consisting of up to 800 cells .
assuming a viral adsorption fraction of 10 % ( i.e. , fraction of viruses that adsorp to a host ) and a burst size of 100 pfu cell - 1 , an initial moi of more than 0.125 x 10 - 3 would lead to multiple infections after a first round of lysis .
thus , in this one - step growth assay , host cell suspensions ( 50 ml ) were mixed with a cyanophage lysate at a sufficiently low moi of 0.1 x 10 - 4 .
after 30 min of steady incubation to allow adsorption , the mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at the corresponding culture temperature .
the pellets were collected , washed twice in aa medium , and then resuspended in 50 ml of aa medium and incubated in the chambers described above .
for the plaque assays ( suttle , 1993 ) , 0.1 and 1 ml samples from these resuspended cultures were plated at 0 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 , and 390 min .
after constructing one - step growth curves ( supplementary figure 1 ) with cyanophage titres at each time point relative to those at t0 , the latent period , lytic cycle and average burst size were determined using a modified gompertz sigmoid growth function ( zwietering et al. , 1990 ) including the addition of a normalized initial pfu of 1 : y = bxexp ( - exp ( rm xeb ( lambda - t )+ 1 ))+ 1 where y indicates the titre at time t , b the burst size ( i.e. , the maximum relative pfu ) , rm the maximum infection rate , e the mathematical constant ( i.e. , 2.718 ) , and lambda is the latent period indicated by the point on the x - axis where the slope from the maximum increase crosses y = 1 .
fits were performed using least square fitting with the microsoft excel 2013 solver grg nonlinear fitting procedure with multistart of population size of 200 .
the lytic cycle was estimated based on the relative pfu data as the time when the burst size b was reached .
eop assay for the eop assay , host cell suspensions were sampled and a cyanophage lysate was added with a moi of 0.1 x 10 - 3 .
the titer of the mixture was recorded as p0 .
such a low moi should prevent multiple phages attaching to a single trichome , which consisted of 120 cells on average with exceptions of up to 800 cells .
these mixtures were subsequently incubated for 1 h for viral adsorption , without shaking , in the chambers described above .
to assess the number of infected hosts at the end of the assay ( p1 ) , 1.5 ml of sample was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min at the corresponding culture temperature .
the supernatant containing free cyanophages was removed , and the titres of the pellets containing infected cyanobacteria were subsequently determined by plaque assay ( suttle , 1993 ) .
the eop over a 1 h period was calculated as p1 / p0 .
statistical analysis data was log transformed before statistical analysis to improve equality of variances .
normality and equality of variances were confirmed using the kolmogorov - smirnov test and levene 's test , respectively .
significant differences between treatments were tested using a one - way anova , and followed by post - hoc comparison of the means using s - n - k test if normality was confirmed , otherwise the games - howell test was applied .
statistics were performing with spss statistics 17.0 ( ibm inc. , usa ) , the figures were made by graphpad prism 5.01 ( graphpad inc. , usa ) , and all values represent means ( n = 3 ) +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
significant differences between treatments were indicated by different lowercase letters .
results the growth rates of p. boryanum were significantly higher in the elevated pco2 and combined effect treatments as compared to the control conditions ( figure 1a , p < 0.05 ) , and were in accordance with the observed effects on chl - a concentrations ( figure 1b ) .
while growth rate remained unaltered during the course of 1 year in these two treatments , host cell density ( supplementary figure 2 ) and chl - a concentrations showed a gradual increase ( p < 0.05 ) .
cellular chl - a contents did not significantly change with warming , elevated pco2 , nor their combined effect , though tended to be higher in the warm treatment compared to the elevated pco2 and combined effect treatment ( figure 1c ) .
after re - exposure to control conditions , chl - a concentrations in the elevated pco2 and combined treatment turned to lower than the control ( p < 0.05 ) .

different lowercase letters indicate significant differences between treatments ( one - way anova , p < 0.05 ) .
the lytic cycle , latent period and burst size remained largely unaltered over the course of the 1 year period ( figure 2 ) .
however , the lytic cycle was reduced from 316 +/ - 10 min in the control to 282 +/ - 14 min and 256 +/ - 11 min for warming and elevated pco2 treatment , respectively ( figure 2a , p < 0.05 ) .
when both factors were combined , the lytic cycle further shortened down to 209 +/ - 8 min .
the lytic cycle includes the latent period , which was strongly reduced from 196 +/ - 3 min in the control , down to 143 +/ - 4 , 129 +/ - 8 , and 57 +/ - 3 min in the warming , elevated pco2 and combined effect treatment , respectively ( figure 2b ; p < 0.05 ) .
the difference between the lytic cycle and latent period ( deltat ) did not differ between the treatments ( supplementary figure 3 ) , thus indicating that the shorter lytic cycles were a result of a shorter latent period .
upon re - exposure to control conditions , the lytic cycle and latent period remained lower for warming and elevated pco2 treatments as compared to the control ( figures 2a,b ; p < 0.05 ) , while the lytic cycle and latent period turned to increase in the combined treatment as compared to before re - exposure ( figures 2a,b ; p < 0.05 ) .

different lowercase letters indicate significant differences between treatments ( one - way anova , p < 0.05 ) .
burst size increased from 35 +/ - 3 pfu cell - 1 to 50 +/ - 5 pfu cell - 1 in response to warming ( p < 0.05 ) , whereas it decreased to 23 +/ - 1 pfu cell - 1 with elevated pco2 ( figure 2c ; p < 0.05 ) .
both factors seemed to counteract each other when combined , as the burst size of the combined effect treatment was 29 +/ - 2 pfu cell - 1 and thus demonstrated no significant difference to the control .
the combined effect of elevated pco2 and warming on burst size and latent period seems additive rather than interactive .
after re - exposure to the control conditions , the burst size was lower as compared to the control for all climate change factors ( figure 2c ; p < 0.05 ) .
the eop was not influenced by the duration of exposure , but increased from 2.5 +/ - 0.2 % in the control to 4.5 +/ - 0.5 % in the warm treatment , whereas it decreased down to 1.5 +/ - 0.2 % in the elevated pco2 treatment ( figure 3 ) .
together , warming and elevated pco2 resulted in an eop of 6.7 +/ - 0.6 % , indicating a clear interactive effect of elevated pco2 and warming on eop ( p < 0.05 ) .
in other words , the increase in eop with warming was further enhanced with elevated pco2 , and both factors thus synergistically favored infection by cyanophage pp. after re - exposure to control conditions , eop responded similarly as the burst size , with a significant decrease as compared to the control in all climate change treatments ( figure 3 ; p < 0.05 ) .

discussion physiological acclimation and evolutionary adaptation of host and virus the growth rates of p. boryanum ranged from 0.42 to 0.53 in this work , and it was lower than p. boryarum utex 485 ( miskiewicz et al. , 2000 ) , but higher than p. boryarum aucc 143 ( prasad et al. , 2005 ) .
cyanobacteria possess rubisco 1d with a low affinity for co2 ( badger et al. , 2006 ) , and their growth was thus expected to be favored with elevated pco2 .
indeed , growth and biomass build - up ( as indicated by chl - a concentration ) of p. boryanum showed a consistent increase with elevated pco2 and with elevated pco2 combined with warming over the 1 year period .
yet , after a 3 week period of re - exposure to control conditions , growth was similar to the control conditions while biomass build - up was lower for cells grown at both conditions .
the observed gradual increase in biomass build - up over the 1 year period may indicate adaptation to elevated pco2 levels .
moreover , these results suggest that this adaptive response regarding biomass build - up becomes unfavorable when exposed again to low co2 availabilities .
these findings are in contrast to earlier studies that did not reveal evolutionary adaptation in cyanobacteria ( low - decarie et al. , 2013 ) , but seems comparable to observations on the green alga chlamydomonas , showing reduced growth rates upon a short re - exposure to ambient pco2 conditions after long - term elevated pco2 exposure ( collins and bell , 2004 ) .
adaptation to elevated pco2 thus seem favorable for plectonema as it could reach higher biomass build - up , but this will only occur if co2 levels will remain high for a sufficient number of generations .
in our experiment , plectonema was exposed to the climate change factors for over 150 generations , which appeared sufficiently long to allow adaptive responses .
co2 concentrations in productive freshwater systems may vary substantially at short time scales as result of uptake of co2 via photosynthesis ( verspagen et al. , 2014a ) .
under such conditions , adaptation is likely not occurring and the success of a species will largely depend on the physiological acclimation ( i.e. , phenotypic plasticity ) .
in less productive waters , co2 concentrations may become high and remain more stable .
under such conditions , adaptive responses are more likely to occur .
in contrast to our expectations , warming did not cause an increase in growth or biomass build - up in our study .
this is surprising , as cyanobacteria tend to have higher growth optima with a generally broad temperature range ( lurling et al. , 2013 ) .
an earlier study with p. boryanum did show an increase in growth rate and biomass build - up after 16 h of warming from 15 to 29degreesc ( miskiewicz et al. , 2000 ) .
our control conditions were performed at 25degreesc , which may have already been the growth optimum for this species .
although a warming of 4degreesc is likely to affect p. boryanum metabolism , it did not result in differences in growth rate or biomass build - up. moreover , it seems that warming did not alter the response of the host to elevated pco2 .
impacts of warming will thus not only depend on the extent by which temperature increases , but also on the temperature range where these changes occur relative to an organism 's growth optimum .
although virus infection dynamics changed with climate change factors , the observed responses remained largely unaltered over the 1 year period ( i.e. , the response after 1 year was similar to the response after 6 months ) .
this suggests that virus infection dynamics were insensitive to the changes in host fitness , or that the changes in host fitness over the course of 1 year were too small relative to the differences between the treatments .
consequently , the main response of virus infections follows host physiological acclimation rather than adaptation .
interestingly , burst size and infection efficiency ( i.e. , eop ) of the virus showed a completely reversed response when provided with host cells that were re - exposud to control conditions after having grown in the warm and / or combined treatment .
this may indicate that host cells were adapted to the warm and combined conditions , and that upon re - exposure the physiological acclimation to control conditions reduced the virus burst size and infection efficiency .
thus , host adaptation but particularly physiological acclimation to climate change factors are responsible for the observed shifts in viral infectivity .
infection dynamics our result show various co2 and temperature effects on cyanophage infection characteristics , and both factors may promote but also impede infections .
for instance , elevated pco2 led to a shorter latent period but also a reduced burst size .
thus , faster infection cycles are accompanied by a reduced production of offspring phages .
such a trade - off has also been reported earlier for a cyanophage - synechococcus system where a shorter latent period in response to a lower ph was accompanied by a reduced burst size ( traving et al. , 2014 ) .
under elevated pco2 , growth rate of the host increased which may have led to a shorter latent period and consequently result in a smaller burst size , as there is less time for phage production ( gnezda - meijer et al. , 2006 ) .
impacts of elevated pco2 on the burst size of phytoplankton viruses , however , do not seem unambiguous .
for instance , burst size of an emiliania huxleyi virus was shown to increase ( larsen et al. , 2008 ) or decrease ( carreira et al. , 2013 ) , while no pco2 dependent change in burst size was observed for a micromonas pusilla virus ( maat et al. , 2014 ) , though in the latter the host was p - limited .
warming alone caused a shorter latent period along with higher burst size , which was also reported for the lactococcal phage p008 ( mueller - merbach et al. , 2007 ) and the streptococcus phage phi18 ( sanders and klaenhammer , 1984 ) .
this suggests that warming may favor phage development , possibly by stimulating enzymes involved in phage production ( chu et al. , 2011 ) , and / or inhibit cellular defense mechanisms against phage infection ( see also below ) ( sanders and klaenhammer , 1984 ; durmaz and klaenhammer , 2007 ) .
the combined effect of warming and elevated pco2 on latent period and burst size were additive , resulting in a further shortening of the latent period but a reduced overall effect on burst size .
infection efficiency phage infection generally depends on ( 1 ) the contact rate between the phage and host , and ( 2 ) phage resistance mechanisms by the host cell .
the rate of contact is influenced by the concentration of host and virus , host cell size , temperature , and viscosity of the water ( murray and jackson , 1992 ) .
indeed , virus infections seem generally density dependent ( murray and jackson , 1992 ) , and larger host cells were shown to provide a greater surface area for contact ( hadas et al. , 1997 ) .
in the eop assay , host , cyanophage concentration and the cell size were similar between treatments ( supplementary figure 4 ) , and these factors thus cannot explain differences in eop .
in the warm treatments , water temperature was increased from 25 to 29degreesc , with a consequent decrease in water viscosity from 0.8937 mpa x s to 0.8180 mpa x s. this would lead to an increased contact rate by 10.7 % ( murray and jackson , 1992 ) .
thus , the observed increase in eop in the warm and combined effect treatments could , at least partially , be explained by a temperature dependent decrease in water viscosity .
efficiency of plaquing ( eop ) was more than 50 % higher in the warm treatment compared to the control , which is comparable to earlier reports on plaquing efficiency with a cyanophage - - dolichospermum system ( currier and wolk , 1979 ) .
this suggests that warming may impede phage resistance mechanisms by the host cell , including ( 1 ) blocking of adsorption , ( 2 ) blocking of phage dna injection , ( 3 ) dna restriction / modification ( r / m ) , and ( 4 ) abortive infection ( abi ) , which may be the main reason for the higher eop .
both higher ph ( caused by lower pco2 ) and higher temperature ( benedi et al. , 1991 ) can lead to a higher lipopolysaccharide content on the cell surface that may act as receptor for cyanophage adsorption ( samimi and drews , 1978 ) .
thus , elevated pco2 , resulting in lower ph , may reduce adsorption , while warming may enhance adsorption via changes in the cell surface lipopolysaccharides .
also dna injection was shown to be influenced by both ph and temperature ( kumar sarkar et al. , 2006 ) , and an increase in temperature was furthermore shown to enhance dna injection ( labedan and goldberg , 1979 ) .
higher temperatures may also promote the dna ejection rate , which could be explained by a temperature induced conformational change in the tail pore - forming proteins allowing phage dna to pass through faster ( lof et al. , 2007 ) .
r / m systems are widely distributed in bacteria as well as in unicellular and filamentous cyanobacteria ( szekeres et al. , 1983 ; zhao et al. , 2006 ; stucken et al. , 2013 ) .
the activity of r / m systems mainly depends on various restriction endonucleases to digest phage dna , with distinct optimal digestion temperatures and ph ( sanders and klaenhammer , 1984 ; guimont et al. , 1993 ; dempsey et al. , 2005 ) .
lastly , abi systems can cause a disruption of phage development after early phage gene expression , resulting in a decrease in death of the infected cells and / or a reduction in phage burst size ( emond et al. , 1997 ; tangney and fitzgerald , 2002 ) .
the activity of abi genes may be up - or down - regulated by temperature ( tangney and fitzgerald , 2002 ; bidnenko et al. , 2009 ) , but there is no report on the influence of pco2 or ph on abi gene activity .
elevated pco2 magnified the positive effect of warming on eop , even though elevated pco2 alone caused a decrease in eop .
these surprising interactive effects suggest a dependency of infection characteristics on both temperature and pco2 .
dissociation of the cell puncturing complex of phages is essential for phage dna injection , and was shown to be controlled by both ph and temperature ( kumar sarkar et al. , 2006 ) .
specifically , a decreasing ph slowed down the dissociation of a protein complex that is involved in host resistance ( i.e. , ( gp5 *) 3 ( gp5c ) 3 ) when temperature was 0degreesc , while the dissociation of the same complex was accelerated by a decreasing ph at 20degreesc .
these results suggest that the optimal ph for phage dna injection could vary strongly with temperature .
warming and elevated pco2 , together with associated changes in ph , may thus affect the resistance of a host to phage infection .
future studies should further elucidate the complex interplay between climate change effects on phage associated traits and host defense mechanisms .
conclusions in conclusion , the mechanisms responsible for the combined effects of elevated pco2 and elevated temperature on the infectivity of cyanophage are complex and poorly understood .
although we observed host adaptation to the climate change factors , the strongest virus responses seem a result of host physiological acclimation .
warming was shown to increase eop , as well as reduce the latent period and increase burst size , while elevated pco2 reduced eop , latent period and burst size .
thus , warming seems to generally promote phage infections , while elevated pco2 differentially affects various components of phage infections .
the observed effects of both climate change factors are additive , except for eop for which the increase with warming was promoted by elevated pco2 .
thus , the combined influence of warming and elevated pco2 may have a profound influence on the virus - host dynamics with climate change .
more specifically , although climate change may promote cyanobacteria growth , their phages may also be facilitated and thereby pose a stronger control on cyanobacterial bloom formation .

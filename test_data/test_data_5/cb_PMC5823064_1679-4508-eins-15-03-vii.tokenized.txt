prostate cancer ( pc ) screening remains a controversial topic , although it has been studied for more than two decades .
since the 1990s , when the use of prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) began in clinical practice , the mortality rate from pc has decreased by around 50 % .
prostate cancer screening policies , early diagnosis and treatment are pointed out as responsible to 45 % - 70 % of this reduction. ( 1 ) on the other hand , indiscriminate screening can lead to problems because of unnecessary prostate biopsies , and their possible side effects , such as infection and bleeding , and overdiagnosis and overtreatment of pc. these clinically non - significant tumors may be diagnosed and treated , perhaps , without any benefit to the patient .
in addition , treatment sometimes causes potential side effects , such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction - consequently worsening the quality of life .
the controversy became even greater when in 2012 the us preventive services task force ( uspstf ) discouraged the use of psa as a tool for pc screening ( grade d recommendation ) , regardless of patient 's age. ( 2 ) of note is that uspstf is an independent , volunteer panel of 16 american experts in prevention and evidence - based medicine .
currently , members of uspstf are physicians ( family practitioners , general practitioners , pediatricians , and gynecologists ) and primary care nurses .
however , interestingly , no urologist belongs to the panel. ( 3 ) considering the facts exposed above , undoubtedly , the main reason for screening and early diagnosis of any neoplasia is to reduce deaths from the disease .
at the time that uspstf recommended against the use of psa , their arguments were based on two high - quality studies that assessed mortality in screened and nonscreened groups .
the first study included was the plco ( prostate , lung , colorectal , and ovarian cancer screening trial ) , a large randomized study conducted in 10 us centers that included 76,685 men between 1993 and 2001. ( 4 ) individuals were 55 to 74 years old , and were randomly assigned to receive or not receive annual evaluation with psa for 6 years and digital rectal examination for 4 years , with minimal follow - up of 7 years .
biopsy was indicated if the psa was higher than 4.0ng / ml or the result of digital rectal examination was abnormal .
detection of pc increased 22 % in the screened group , but no significant difference was seen in cancer - specific mortality between groups .
these results were not surprising because among other reasons , follow - up duration was very short ( 7 years ) and , in the control group , there was contamination of the sample - more than 80 % of individuals were evaluated by psa at least once during the study. ( 5 ) therefore , the plco trial , truly compared two different screening forms and , therefore , the results must be interpreted carefully .
european researchers performed another important randomized trial about pc screening , the erspc ( european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer ).( 6 ) in the beginning of the 1990s , this trial sought to determine whether screening with psa could reduce by 25 % the risk for death from pc. the study included 182,160 men aged 55 to 69 years who were randomly assigned to undergo or not undergo screening every 2 to 4 years .
although , on average , each man in the intervention group had only 2.1 psa assessments during the entire follow - up period , psa levels that would lead to prostate biopsies were not uniform , ranging from 3.0 to 10.0ng / ml according to country .
because sextant biopsies were done ( random , including six fragments ) , which currently are considered inadequate , the study showed a pc incidence of 8.2 % in the screened group and 4.8 % in the control group , with 20 % relative reduction in the risk of death from this neoplasia , after a mean follow - up of 9 years .
the screened group had a higher incidence of localized and low - risk disease , but the frequency of bone metastasis was reduced by 41 % .
the results showed the need to screen 1,410 men and treat 48 patients to prevent 1 death by pc. in an update of this study with a median follow - up of 11 years , results seemed more favorable , with reduction of 21 % of risk for death from pc , the estimated number of needed to screen to prevent 1 death was 936 , and the number needed to treat was 33. ( 7 ) at that time , a third study had been published and , although it presented the best methodology , it had a smaller sample , and it was practically ignored by uspstf .
in the goteborg study ,( 8 ) 20,000 men aged 50 to 64 years were randomly assigned to biannual evaluation with psa or a control group .
at 14 - year follow - up , the incidence of pc was 12.7 % in the screened group and 8.2 % in control group with 44 % reduction in the risk of death from pc. it was estimated that 293 men would need to be screened and 12 would need to be treated to prevent 1 death by pc. however , considering the findings of the plco and erspc , and the fact that 90 % of tumors diagnosed were treated surgically or with radiotherapy ,( 9 ) the uspstf inferred that problems related to screening would be , in a last analysis , those related to biopsy needed for diagnosis and also problems associated with treatment .
for every 1,000 men who were screened , 1 death from pc could be avoided at the expense of 30 to 40 men with urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction , two severe cardiovascular events , and one deep venous thrombosis .
also , for every 3,000 screened men , 1 death from treatment complications may occur. ( 10 ) for these reasons , in 2012 , the report was issued against pc screening. from that time on , a number of new data were published .
the erspc was updated again , but now the mean follow - up was 13 years , and results reported were even more favorable .
the estimated needed number to screen to prevent 1 death from pc was 781 , and the number needed to treat was 27. ( 11 ) this estimation would enable to avoid 3 cases of metastatic disease for each 1,000 men who are screened. ( 12 ) in the goteborg study , after a 18 years of follow - up , they observed the possibility to avoid one death for every 139 screenings and 13 diagnoses of pc. ( 13 ) in addition , today , there is strong evidence that active surveillance in low - risk pc provides long - term cancer - specific survival similar to radiotherapy and surgery. ( 14 ) currently , this more conservative management has been applied in approximately one third of patients diagnosed with low - risk pc , therefore diminishing the complications of overtreatment. ( 15 ) recently , consequences related to uspstf recommendations are being published .
these studies report a significant reduction in screening with psa among all ages .
in addition to the reduction in biopsies requests and decrease of pc incidence , there is a trend to the diagnose of more advanced and high grade cases of pc. at the same time , diagnosis of metastatic disease has increased .
these findings are worrisome because they avoid the early diagnoses and , when necessary , the adequate treatment mainly in young men with clinically significant and potentially fatal disease who could benefit from screening. ( 16 ) this year , the uspstf will update its recommendations for pc screening , and they have made available a draft for public comment. ( 17 ) in this new version of recommendations the decision or not for screening must be individualized , and physicians are advised to recommend screening to their patients aged 55 to 69 years , considering the possible benefits and harms caused by the use of psa for pc diagnosis .
to the uspstf , the screening provides the benefit of a small reduction in the chance of dying from pc , but many men exposed to psa may experience damages related to screening such as false - positive results and some of them need additional tests and , sometimes , a prostatic biopsy , as well as overdiagnosis and overtreatment , which are associated with complications in this neoplasia treatment , such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction ( grade c recommendation ) .
because there are no evidences to guide screening in men at high risk for pc , the uspstf suggests the same recommendations of the general population , including black men and men with family history of cancer .
the uspstf continues to recommend that pc screening using psa should be not adopted for men older than 70 years old ( grade d recommendation ) .
although a significant advance this new recommendation guideline can represent , they are still not ideal .
strategies for personalized screening and adapted for risk of each patient must be applied .
currently , more data has appeared to justify the assessment with psa by around 40 years of age .
in a 30 years follow - up , more than 90 % of deaths because of pc occurred among men that , when they were aged 40 to 49 years , presented a psa level greater than the median to their age .
for this reason , those with psa over 0.7ng / ml need , by 50 years of age , to adopt a rigorous screening strategy because they are in the higher risk group .
on the other hand , for individuals with psa levels lower than the median of their age , the screening protocol could be less frequent. ( 18 ) when to stop screening is also controversial .
because patients are living longer it seems inappropriate to establish the 70 years as a cut - off age .
the use of life expectancy as a parameter for screening older patients , perhaps , is the most adequate criteria .
new tools that seek to improve accuracy of prostatic biopsy have been developed and have gained more space in clinical practice .
tumor markers , such as 4k score and prostate health index ( phi ) can be used to improve the selection of patients who really need a biopsy .
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate can stratify the risk of clinically significant pc , and when this exam is associated with fusion guided biopsy , it diagnoses more precisely intermediate and high risk cases , which need active treatment. ( 19 ) data provided by these tests must be incorporated in screening protocols in order to reduce overdiagnosis , mainly in cases of non - clinically significant tumors .
to reduce overtreament , the diagnosis of pc must be separated from its active treatment .
surgery and / or radiotherapy should be offered for men with intermediate to high - risk tumors .
in most of cases of low risk pc , the preferable option is active surveillance. ( 20 ) the pc is the solid tumor with higher incidence among men , and the second leading cause of cancer death .
indiscriminate screening can cause problems , but non - screening certainly would cause decrease in survival rates .
the new uspstf recommendations suggest that shared decision should be made , after explanation of risks and benefits of screening , in patients aged 55 to 69 years old .
still , factors not approached in these recommendations such as race , family history , men younger than 55 years or older than 69 years need to be reassessed to , ideally , enable a proposal of an personalized scheme for pc screening based on risk of each man .

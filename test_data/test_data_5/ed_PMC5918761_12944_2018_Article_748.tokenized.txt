background dyslipidemia and hyper - homocysteinemia are the major independent risk factors of cardio vascular disease .
deficiency of folate and vitamin b - 12 are associated with both hyper - homocysteinemia and dyslipidemia .
the aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship of homocysteine and its associated dietary determinant levels ( folate and vitamin b - 12 ) with lipids and obesity parameters ( wc , bmi , whr ) in north indian population .
methods the participants were recruited under a major government funded project through household survey covering 15 villages of haryana , india .
participants were both males and females , between age group 30 - 65 years , from a north indian community .
initially 1634 individuals were recruited , of which 1374 were considered for analysis as they were not found to be on any kind of medication for high blood pressure , cad , diabetes or any other disorder , and had no missing data .
5 ml of intravenous blood sample was collected after obtaining written informed consent from the participants .
homocysteine , folate and vitamin b12 levels were estimated through immulite 1000 by chemi - luminescence technique .
triglyceride , total cholesterol and hdl - c were estimated by spectrophotometry technique using commercial kits .
the values for ldl and vldl were calculated using friedwald 's equation .
height , weight , waist circumference ( wc ) , hip circumference ( hc ) was measured over light clothing .
statistical analysis for data was performed using spss 16.0 version .
results all the lipid indices , except hdl , showed a trend of negative correlation with homocysteine after controlling for confounders , though not significant .
no association was found between obesity ( wc , bmi , whr ) and homocysteine in the present study .
vitamin b - 12 deficiency was significantly associated with both hyper - homocysteinemia and low hdl .
folate was found to have significantly reduced risk for high tc & ldl .
conclusions the " hcy - lipid " hypothesis does not seem to be complementing in the present studied population .
the population is vulnerable to severe under - nutrition due to the association of vitamin b - 12 with hdl , leading to metabolic disturbance in both the pathways ; lipid and one carbon metabolic pathway .
co - factors such as ethnicity , cultural practices , and lifestyle & dietary habits must be considered while making public health policies to control diseases .

keywords lipid homocysteine vitamin b - 12 metabolic pathway under - nutrition population issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background the most common and highest population attributable traditional risk for cvds is dyslipidemia [ 1 ] , its prevalence ranges from 10 to 73 % among asian indians [ 2 ] .
abnormality in any one of the lipid indices ; tc , tg , hdl , ldl , vldl is considered as dyslipidemic .
dyslipidemia is a phenomenon associated with both genetic or environmental factors such as eating habits coupled with less physical activity [ 3 - 5 ] , tobacco and alcohol consumption .
on the other hand , hcy is a metabolite in one carbon metabolic pathway , and higher level of hcy (>= 15 mumol / l ) was found to be contributing to the development and progression of cvd 's and various other complex disorders [ 6 - 8 ] .
its prevalence is in the range of 52 - 84 % in different population groups in india [ 9 - 11 ] .
hhcy disturbs the phospholipid metabolism by affecting the assembly or secretion of vldl , leading to dyslipidemia [ 12 ] .
hcy mediated enhanced lipid peroxidation and generation of free radicals results in inflammation and acute endothelial dysfunction which accelerates atherosclerotic process predisposing to cardiovascular disease [ 13 ]. the lipid and one carbon metabolic pathway are connected via an intermediate methyl donor , s - adenosyl methionine ( sam ) .
sam has dual role , first it donates methyl groups to s - adenosylhomocysteine ( sah ) for proper functioning of one carbon metabolic pathway and second is to donate 3 methyl groups to phosphatidylethanolamine ( pe ) for the production of 30 % of phosphatidylcholine ( pc ) via pemt pathway , which is responsible for 50 % of plasma hcy levels .
synthesis of pc is important for phospholipid metabolism as pc is a component of vldl particle and inadequate pc can cause accumulation of fat and cholesterol .
pc can also be synthesized upto 70 % by a second pathway which is cdp - choline or kennedy pathway , and this biological reaction requires either choline in dietary form or can be derived from catabolism of pc. kennedy pathway and homocysteine metabolism are linked via choline [ 12 ] .
hhcy and dyslipidemia , both are the independent risk factors of cvds but the co - existence of both hhcy & dyslipidemia is likely to multiply the burden of cvds .
folate and vitamin b - 12 ( methyl donors ) are the essential components of hcy metabolic pathway and deficiency of these methyl donors are not only associated with hhcy but also dyslipidemia as reported in studies [ 10 ] .
multiple researchers have examined the relationship between hhcy and dyslipidemia ; however the results are inconsistent [ 14 ] in case - control studies as well as in population studies .
hence , it is important to explore the " hcy - lipid " relationship in indian population to help control the risks associated with the co - existence of hhcy & dyslipidemia , which is a leading cause of cvds .
a preliminary work done on the prevalence rates of cvd risk factors in the studied population group was already reported in a previous manuscript ( communicated ) .
the presently studied population from north indian followed a lacto vegetarian diet , which is cardio - protective , in spite of that the prevalence rate of hhcy and dyslipidemia in the population was found to be reasonably high .
more than 2 / 3rd of the present studied population had high hcy levels ( 70 %) .
the most prevalent lipid abnormality in the studied population was found to be low hdl - c ( 43 %) , while other dyslipidemic indices ranged from 22 % ( abnormal ldl - c ) to 28 % ( total cholesterol ) .
on the other hand prevalence of under - nutrition in terms of low dietary intake of vitamin b - 12 and folate were found to be 57 % and 32 % , respectively in the studied population .
in view of the high prevalence rates of the risk factors , it is expected that under - nutrition in terms of low vitamin b - 12 , folate and hdl might be the cause of high hcy levels which may further increase the levels of bad lipids ( tc,tg , ldl ) in this population , affecting two major metabolic pathways ( hcy and lipid pathway ) .
thus the present study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the relationship of hcy and its associated dietary determinants ( folate and vitamin b - 12 ) with lipids and obesity parameters ( wc , bmi , whr ) , in a north indian population .
methods study design and area the present study was a cross - sectional study , conducted in the palwal district of haryana ( north india ) .
palwal is located near developed cities of india i.e. , delhi and gurgaon .
palwal district has both agricultural and commercial areas .
delhi - mathura highway ( nh2 ) crosses the palwal district of haryana making it more commercial or industrialized area .
data collection pretested and modified interview schedule was administered on recruited individuals .
data on age , gender , education status , occupation , lifestyle ( smoking ) and physical activity were collected from all the participants .
smokers were those individuals presently smoking beedi / cigarette and had at least 15 years of smoking history .
physical activity was self reported as active and sedentary .
those who followed routine walking , standing , physically strenuous work were considered as active participants and those with predominantly sedentary routine were considered as sedentary participants .
occupation was majorly categorized as agricultural workers , government employees , business persons , and others ( students , retired persons , dependents ) .
all these factors were included in the study to check for confounders .
anthropometric measurements such as height , weight , waist circumference ( wc ) , hip circumference ( hc ) were measured over light clothing [ 15 ] .
cut - offs used for obesity parameters abdominal obesity was defined as wc >= 90 cm for men and >= 80 cm for women [ 16 ] .
high whr was defined as > 0.90 cm for men and > 0.80 cm for women [ 17 ] .
high bmi ( kg / m2 ) , i.e. , overweight and obese were defined as bmi 23 - 24.9 kg / m2 and bmi >= 25 kg / m2 .
respectively whereas normal bmi was defined as bmi 18 - 22.9 kg / m2.as per asian guidelines .
blood sample collection intravenous blood sample ( 5 ml ) , after overnight fasting for at - least 12 h , was collected by trained personnel .
serum and plasma separation was done within 3 h of collection and stored at - 80 degreesc .
lipid parameters i.e. triglyceride ( tg ) , total cholesterol ( tc ) and hdl - c were estimated by spectrophotometry technique ( dialab instrument ) using commercial kits ( randox laboratories ltd. ) .
the value for ldl was calculated using friedwald 's equation and vldl was calculated as one - fifth of tg level .
homocysteine , folate and vitamin b - 12 levels were estimated through immulite 1000 analyser ( siemens diagnostic products , usa ) by chemi - luminescence technique as per the manufacturer 's instruction .
as per the specifications of the manufacturer , the calibrator range for hcy was 2 - 50 mumol / l. for every batch of samples , one sample was reanalyzed for quality check for all biochemical tests , and samples with co - efficient of variation less than 20 % was used in the analysis .
all biochemical estimations were performed at all india institute of medical sciences ( aiims ) , new delhi .
cut - offs used for biochemical parameters ncep guidelines were used to estimate dyslipidemia .
high tc was defined as > 200 mg / dl , high tg as >= 150 mg / dl , low hdl as < 40 for men and < 50 for women ( mg / dl ) , high ldl as > 130 mg / dl , high vldl as > 30 mg / dl. high levels of hcy was defined as >= 15 mumol / l and vitamin b - 12 deficiency as <= 220 pg / ml and folate deficiency as < 3 ng / ml [ 18 ] .
recruitment of subjects the participants were recruited , under a major government funded project , which also included genetic analysis .
it is because of this that the major criterion for recruitment was that the individuals will be unrelated upto first cousin .
recruitment of participants was done through household survey of 15 villages of haryana .
the population was considered to be from north indian gene pool and speaks a language which is categorized as indo - european linguistic group .
they follow caste endogamy , village and surname exogamy , as per the data captured using pretested and modified interview schedules .
total 1634 individuals were recruited initially , but 260 participants were excluded as they had missing data and / or they were found to be on medication for high blood pressure , cad , diabetes , or any other disorders .
finally , 1374 were found to be meeting the criteria that none were on any kind of medication / supplementation , and were unrelated samples within age group 30 - 65 years with no missing data. of 1374 subjects included in the present study , 975 subjects with high hcy were considered as cases and 399 subjects with normal hcy were considered as controls .
statistical analysis statistical analysis for data was performed using spss 16.0 version .
normality test was performed for all the variables .
for skewed variables , median levels were considered and mann - whitney u - test of significance was performed .
outliers were checked for the variables through descriptive statistics - explore and were removed .
chi square test was used for frequency distribution for categorical variables .
spearman correlation and partial correlation after adjustment for confounders was performed to determine the relationship between the studied variables .
multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk after adjustment with confounders .
a significance level of 5 % was used for all the statistical tests .
ethical considerations the study was approved by the ethical committee of department of anthropology , university of delhi .
the objectives were clearly explained to the participants of all the households and local authorities .
informed written consent of all the participants was taken prior to recruitment .
participants were informed about the data and blood sample collection in the consent form .
results the comparison of general characteristics between cases ( hyper - homocysteinemia ) and controls ( normal homocysteine ) showed that the median age was significantly higher ( 48.00 years ) among cases as compared to controls ( 45.00 years ) ( table 1 ) .
male sex and smokers were found to be significantly higher in cases as compared to that of controls .

however , with respect to physical activity and occupation , the two groups were found to be similar .
hence , the major confounders for the present study were age , gender , education and smoking .
all the selected biochemical and anthropometric variables , i.e. ; homocysteine , lipids , vitamin b - 12 , folate , wc , bmi , whr were not normally distributed , so median values were considered for the present study .
the median levels of all the selected lipid indices and anthropometric variables ( wc , & bmi ) were found to be similarly distributed among cases and controls , except for whr .
hyper - homocysteinemic females were found to have significantly high whr as compared to controls ( table 2 ) .

spearman correlation and partial correlation ( adjusted for age , gender , education , smoking ) were performed to determine the relation of hcy with lipids , and anthropometric variables .
a weak positive correlation was found between hcy and wc and also with whr ( additional file 1 ) in spearman correlation , however , it was not persistent in partial correlation analysis after adjusted with confounders .
hcy was found to be negatively correlated to both folate and vitamin b - 12 ( p value <= 0.05 ) in spearman correlation as well as in partial correlation analysis ( additional file 1 ) .
multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for the association of hcy with lipids , obesity indices and vitamins .
among all variables , only vitamin b12 deficiency showed more than 1 fold significant increased risk for hhcy ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 multivariate logistic regression analysis of hcy with lipids , obesity indices and vitamins .
adjusted for confounders such as age , gender , smoking , education distribution of general characteristics between vitamin b12 normal & deficient groups and folate normal & deficient groups revealed that males were found to be more deficient among individuals with low vitamin b - 12 and folate .
gender was the major confounder .
all the other demographic characteristics such as age , education , smoking , physical activity and occupation were similar in normal vitamin b - 12 and low vit b - 12 individuals and / or in normal folate and low folate individuals ( additional file 2 : table s1 ) .
to understand if micro - nutrient deficiencies ( vitamin b - 12 and folate ) were the reason for dyslipidemia and anthropometric obesity , mann - whitney test was performed ( table 3 ) .
vitamin b - 12 median levels were found to be significantly low in subjects with low hdl ( p <= 0.05 ) .
moreover , a different trend was observed w.r.t folate ; where median levels of folate were found to be significantly increased among individuals with high tc and ldl ( table 3 ) .

on the other hand , folate was found to be positively correlated with tc and ldl ( p <= 0.05 ) ( additional file 3 ) .
multivariate logistic regression analysis after adjustment with confounder ( gender ) revealed more than 1 - fold increased risk of vitamin b - 12 deficiency on individuals with low hdl ( fig. 2a ) .
except hdl , no persistent associations were found between vitamin b - 12 and other lipid and also with obesity indices in all the three statistical analysis performed .
low folate was found to be significantly reducing the risk of high tc ( or - 0.579 , 95 % ci - ( 0.417 - 0.804 ) , p - value - 0.001 ) and high ldl ( or - 0.653 , 95 % ci - ( 0.453 - 0.941 ) , p - value - 0.022 ) in the multivariate logistic regression analysis ( fig. 2b ). fig. 2 a multivariate logistic regression analysis of vitamin b - 12 with lipids & obesity indices .
the main confounder between normal and low vitamin b - 12 individuals was found to be gender , among all the general characteristics ( age , gender , smoking , education , physical activity and occupation ) .
b multivariate logistic regression analysis of folate with lipids and obesity indices .
the main confounder between normal and low folate individuals was found to be gender , among all the general characteristics ( age , gender , smoking , education , physical activity and occupation ) discussion generally , the relationship between homocysteine and lipids ( tc , tg , ldl , vldl ) were either reported positive [ 12 , 19 , 20 ] or were not associated [ 14 , 21 - 26 ] as per the available literature from case - control and population based study .
but only few case - control studies showed a trend of negative correlation between the variables [ 27 ] .
in the present study also , a noteworthy observation was that except hdl , all the lipid indices showed a trend for negative correlation with hcy after controlling for confounders , though not significant .
this was against the normal phenomenon .
in order to validate our results , association of hcy with anthropometric variables of obesity ( bmi , whr , wc ) were evaluated .
the results were not found to be different to that of lipids .
similar to the present results , homocysteine was not associated with wc , bmi , whr in other studies also [ 14 , 22 , 26 ] .
the possible explanation for the inconsistency in hcy - lipid relationship with respect to biological mechanism could be that with such a high prevalence of hyper - homocysteinemia found in the studied population , it may be possible that the pemt pathway has been disturbed and not be able to produce 30 % of pc. however , the population consumes adequate food sources of choline in the form of milk & milk products , potatoes , wheat which might have helped in proper functioning of cdp - choline or kennedy pathway producing 70 % of pc and herewith preventing fat accumulation among the studied population in spite of high homocysteine .
majorly , the positive associations of hcy - lipids , found in the literature had case - control or clinical or experimental designs which were entirely different with respect to population based study designs .
in studies based on animal models , either they were knocked out for various genes or were diet - induced .
on the other hand , population studies are performed on healthy individuals residing in complete natural environment , with no fortified diet or supplementation , where cultural practices such as preparation of food , amount of food intake , lifestyle and social factors are kept in observation .
it may be because of this , that inconsistency in the hcy - lipid relationship is seen .
further , different population groups have different characteristics , such as ethnicity , gene pool , dietary practices and cultural & lifestyle habits , which may show variation in hcy - lipid hypothesis from population to population .
godsland if and co - authors have mentioned about the inconsistent results of hcy - lipids relationship , and also stated that where such associations were found , they were generally found to be weak [ 14 ] .
as no direct association between hcy and lipids was found , an attempt was made to evaluate if low folate and vitamin b - 12 were responsible for raising homocysteine levels in this population , as these are the essential micro - nutrients of one carbon metabolic pathway .
in this population , vitamin b - 12 deficiency was the main contributing factor for hyper homocysteinemia and showed stronger association than folate , as also evident in other population studies [ 10 , 18 ] .
possibly , dietary deficiency of vitamin b - 12 in this population might have reduced the activity of the enzyme methionine synthase ( ms ) which was required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine .
accumulation of homocysteine levels is a result of low dietary intake of vitamin b - 12 which gradually altered the enzymatic activity of ms. due to adequate intake of folate in the form of green leafy vegetables , the association of folate with hhcy was found to be weak in the study .
on the other hand , the reason for high prevalence of vitamin b - 12 deficiency ( 57.6 %) in the population was their inadequate dietary intake , due to the practice of vegetarianism .
this is the common reason for vit b - 12 deficiency in majority of the indian populations [ 10 ] .
besides food sources of vitamin b - 12 , drinking water in the form of demineralised water have less content of vitamin b - 12 due to removal of cobalt and those microorganisms responsible for endogenous production of vitamin b12 directly or indirectly [ 28 ] .
the studied population mostly used either ro water or boring water for drinking .
vitamin b12 deficiency was associated with use of ro processed drinking water [ 28 ] .
other than inadequate dietary intake and usage of ro water ; lack of awareness , gender difference are the other factors due to which the population could not prevent vitamin b - 12 deficiency .
a direct role of dyslipidemia with vitamin b - 12 and folate deficiency was also evaluated in the present study , as these micro - nutrients were found to be regulating lipid levels independently [ 12 , 29 , 30 ] .
the results revealed an independent association of low hdl ( dyslipidemia ) with low vitamin b - 12 ( nutritional determinant of hcy ) , making dietary vit b - 12 level low in double dose , which was posing a high risk for hyper - homocysteinemia ( cardio - vascular adversity ) .
further , the connection of hdl with vit b - 12 was an indication of severe under - nutrition leading to disturbance in both the metabolic pathways ( homocysteine and lipid pathway ) of the population .
the possible mechanism for the association between vitamin b - 12 deficiency and adverse lipid parameters is different .
it can be said that due to vitamin b - 12 deficiency in this population , the metabolic reaction involving the conversion of methylmalonyl coa ( mm - coa ) to succinyl - coa might have been blocked .
this resulted in accumulation of mm - coa which further inhibited the function of fatty acid oxidation enzyme , carnitine palmitoyl transferase ( cpt1 ) , thus causing lipogenesis [ 29 ] .
researchers have discussed that the complex biological mechanism linking vitamin b - 12 and lipids ( especially hdl ) is not well elucidated .
the results of the present study were concordant with an african population study which also found association of low vit b - 12 with low hdl [ 29 , 31 ] .
this can be stated that there was no sign of lipid initiated hyper - homocysteinemia ( a metabolic distress ) in this population but lipid ( hdl ) initiated nutritional deficiency ( vit b - 12 ) , leading to hyper - homocysteinemia .
the studied population consumes good nutrition in the form of folate .
the results showed that folate had significantly reduced risk for high ldl and high tc as against the normal phenomenon .
it indicated a protective role of folate among those with high tc / ldl .
lipids were not able to increase homocysteine levels as the high levels of tc / ldl were controlled by folate in the present study .
further , understanding the biological mechanism between folate and lipids along with role of genetics is of utmost priority .
it can be thought that the population was cardio - protective because of minimal prevalence of major cardiac disorders like cad , t2dm found ( 1 %) but the association of vitamin b - 12 with hdl is a matter of concern .
the present studied population is unsafe especially in terms of under - nutrition , i.e. , vitamin b - 12 deficiency which is the major culprit , disturbing two metabolic pathways by associating with hdl and causing hyper - homocysteinemia .
conclusion the present study does not support the complementing effect of " hcy - lipid " .
low vitamin b - 12 was the main culprit , causing metabolic disturbance in both the metabolic pathways ( lipid & one carbon metabolic pathway ) by interacting with hdl .
the results of the present study may not be generalized to other ethnic groups .
however , the extrapolation of research on animal models to humans needs to be dealt with caution as both studies are studied under different conditions .
thus in countries like india where diversity at every level and every sphere is next to africa , such population based association studies need to be encouraged to document and collect a body of evidence based on geography , ethnicity & culture to have a meaningful population based public health strategies .
limitations first , the data on food frequency questionnaire ( ffq ) was not collected which could have further helped in validation of the study .
second , vitamin b - 6 is a major determinant of high hcy , which was not estimated in the present study .
third , the cross - sectional design of the study is one of the limitations .

this work presents a framework to exploit the synergy between digital volume correlation ( dvc ) and iterative ct reconstruction to enhance the quality of high - resolution dynamic x - ray ct ( 4d - microct ) and obtain quantitative results from the acquired dataset in the form of 3d strain maps which can be directly correlated to the material properties .
furthermore , we show that the developed framework is capable of strongly reducing motion artifacts even in a dataset containing a single 360degrees rotation .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 introduction high - resolution x - ray computed tomography or muct is a valuable non - destructive 3d imaging technique in numerous research areas .
it has matured to the point where it is now possible to image dynamic processes within micro - structures in 3d with a sufficient temporal resolution to follow the microstructural changes caused by these process through time , i.e. in 4d ( e.g.1 ) .
especially synchrotron experiments , armed with the luxury of high x - ray flux , have pushed the boundaries of the temporal resolution up to the 1 ms range , at spatial resolution as good as 3 mum2,3 .
an exhaustive survey on the achievements w.r.t. temporal and spatial resolutions , can be found in literature4,5 , from which it should be noted that high temporal / spatial resolution ct imaging is becoming tractable at lab - based ct facilities as well6,7 .
though compared with synchrotron sources they are advantageous in terms of system cost and offer the freedom to move the x - ray source , the major limitation for the lab - based setups is the limited x - ray flux produced by micro - focused x - ray tubes .
this subsequently limits the temporal resolution due to a lack of photon statistics at the lowest detector exposure times .
hence , to reach respectable temporal resolutions in a lab - based setup , a trade - off between an acceptable level of noise and motion blurring has to be made .
in general , motion blurring can be caused by any structural change following a dynamic process within the sample , e.g. stress induced internal deformations , temperature related phase changes , imbibition of fluids in micro - pores etc .
although motion blurring is mainly caused by the discretization of the process in a finite number of time frames rather than the speed of the process , it is of course aggravated in fast processes where increasing the number of frames is no longer possible due to hardware limitations or the extreme amount of shot noise in the images .
to further boost the temporal frequencies of ct imaging , a priori information on the underlying dynamic processes can be incorporated in the ct reconstruction algorithm , in most cases of the iterative type .
the precise nature of this a priori information , which strongly depends on the imaged process , has to be cast in a mathematical formulation which models the interaction between the dynamics of the process and the imaged quantity , here the x - ray attenuation coefficient .
the concept is nicely illustrated by myers and co - authors8,9 , where the a priori information is meant to model fluid displacements in the rigid matrix of a porous rocks .
in our work however , we consider a dynamic non - rigid deformation of the sample 's micro - structure .
an estimate of this local deformation could serve as a priori knowledge to compensate for motion blurring upon its integration in a ct reconstruction algorithm .
to achieve this ( 1 ) a dense displacement field has to be estimated , based on a dynamic ct acquisition and ( 2 ) the projection and back - projection steps in the reconstruction algorithm have to be altered in order to account for a deforming image volume .
estimating a displacement field in 3d is commonly referred to as digital volume correlation ( dvc ) , which optimises the correlation between a deformed volume and a reference volume by mapping the former to the latter through a motion vector field ( mvf ) .
the ability to calculate a full - field strain mapping from this mvf , through proper differentiation , has led to an increasing interest for dvc in the material research community ever since its introduction10,11 .
particularly in the field of biomechanics , deformations in trabecular bone have been studied intensively using dvc10,12 , but also in other material disciplines like wood13,14 , metal foam15 - 17 , gypsum18 , soil19,20 , sand packings21 - 23 and composites24 dvc has been leveraged to produce strain maps .
while dvc has found its way to muct material research , its potential to compensate for motion blurring has not been given much attention , as in most applications both the reference and deformed images are derived from high quality static ct scans .
however , when the dynamics of a deformation process are at the edge of a tractable temporal resolution for imaging , and are not controllable , i.e. there is no clear distinction between reference and deformed states , dvc and ct reconstruction can be integrated to enhance the quality of both , in terms of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , temporal and spatial resolution .
the idea to exploit this synergy between dvc and motion compensated ct reconstruction has been explored for medical ct several years ago25 - 28 , and has recently also found its way into high - resolution x - ray ct29,30 .
this work presents a framework to reconstruct datasets imaging a dynamic process , using one or more full rotations .
different dvc methods are compared .
we illustrate the potential of this framework to reduce motion artefacts in a single rotation scan , and to combine this with the retrieval of the displacement field for the full object during multiple rotations. with a view to mapping the material properties in micro - structured materials , the displacement is referenced to the original volume and the concept is applied to a series of high - speed muct acquisitions of an in - situ aluminium foam compression experiment .
more importantly , we show that the framework is capable of successfully compensating for motion artefacts , even in a conventional muct scan using only a single rotation where sample movement is unintended .
methods digital volume correlation during the registration of two images , a spatial transformation that optimises the similarity between these images is estimated .
this similarity can be defined in several ways , but a plausible though rigorous approach in the context of registering ct attenuation images , is to instate the ' constancy of brightness ' : 1 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ mu ({\ overrightarrow { x }}_{ m },\,{\ tau }_{ m })=\ mu \,({\ overrightarrow { x }}_{ f }+\ overrightarrow { u }({\ overrightarrow { x }}_{ f },\,{\ tau }_{ f }),\,{\ tau }_{ f }),$$\ end { document } mu ( x - - > m,taum )= mu ( x - - > f + u - - >( x - - > f,tauf ) , tauf ) , where \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ mu (\ bar { x },\ , t )$$\ end { document } mu ( x , t ) is the reconstructed attenuation coefficient at position \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ bar { x }$$\ end { document } x in 3 - dimensional space and at time point t , \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ bar { u }(\ bar { x },\ , t )$$\ end { document } u ( x , t ) is the displacement of the voxel at postition \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ bar { x }$$\ end { document } x at time point t , and the indices f and m denote the fixed state and moving state , respectively .
the indices will be omitted in the following for notational simplicity , as tf can be set to zero and we will always refer to the fixed position : \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ bar { x }={\ bar { x }}_{ f }$$\ end { document } x = x f and \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ bar { x }}_{ m }={\ bar { x }}_{ f }+\ bar { u }(\ bar { x },\ , t )$$\ end { document } x m = x f + u ( x , t ) .
in ( 1 ) , the images are implicitely linked to distinct instances in time ( tf and tm ) , which underlines the fact that in order to match the fixed and moving states , a time evolving deformation field \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ bar { u }({\ bar { x }}_{ f },\,{ t }_{ m })$$\ end { document } u ( x f,tm ) is to be inferred from the time evolving attenuation distribution of the object .
the goal is thus to find an mvf that deforms the fixed image ( index f ) such that it matches or in the ideal case is equal to the moving image ( index m ) .
when these images are represented by 3d volumes , image registration is typically referred to as ' digital volume correlation ' ( dvc ) .
following31 , the essential components of any registration algorithm are ( 1 ) the choice on how the mvf is parametrised , ( 2 ) the metric used to quantify the similarity between the fixed and moving images , and ( 3 ) the strategy used to find an optimal set for the deformation parameters .
in this work , the entire mvf is described as a linear combination of b - splines , set out on a regularly spaced grid of control points .
in 3d , the displacement component can thus be approximated by 2 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${ u }_{( x,y,z )}(\ bar { x })=\ sum _{{ n }_{ x },{ n }_{ y },{ n }_{ z }= 1 }^{{ n }_{ x },{ n }_{ y },{ n }_{ z }}{ w }_{( x,y,z )}({ n }_{ x },\,{ n }_{ y },\,{ n }_{ z })\,{ {\ mathcal b } }_{{ n }_{ x } , k }( x )\,{ {\ mathcal b } }_{{ n }_{ y } , k }( y )\,{ {\ mathcal b } }_{{ n }_{ z } , k }( z )$$\ end { document } u ( x,y,z )( x )= sumnx,ny,nz = 1nx,ny,nzw ( x,y,z )( nx,ny,nz ) bnx,k ( x ) bny,k ( y ) bnz,k ( z ) where k indicates the b - spline 's order , nx fixes the number of control points , and the w - values form a set of parameters that fix the motion model .
in 3d , the linear expansion basis is constructed out of a b - spline tensor products , which are now used to approximate three displacement components , the mvf is thus described by a parameter vector field \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ bar { w }=[{ w }_{ x },\,{ w }_{ y },\,{ w }_{ z }]$$\ end { document } w =[ wx,wy,wz ] .
the ' elastix ' toolbox31 , which is also exposed to python through the simpleelastix module32 , was used to optimise this parameter vector towards a maximalistion of the ' normalised cross correlation ' ( ncc ) metric with an ' adaptive stochastic gradient descent ( asgd ) optimiser33 .
simpleelastix is an extension to the simpleitk module34 - 36 , which also provides an implementation of b - spline registration and several other algorithms , such as the demons registration approach37 .
this demons approach directly enforces brightness constancy , i.e. equation ( 1 ) , by considering its taylor expansion \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mu }_{\ tau }+\ bar { u }\ cdot {\ nabla }_{\ bar { x }}\ mu = 0 $$\ end { document } mutau + u . nablax mu = 0 .
the resulting optical flow constraint38 can also be formulated in an image 's phase domain , leading to yet another registration approach using dual - tree complex wavelets39,40 .
it is not the goal of this work to provide in depth mathematical explanation of the demons and phase based approaches , for which the reader is referred to the above cited literature , and the short overview found in41 .
furthermore , it will be shown that the b - spline approach is in fact the best choice for the application at hand , both in terms of registration quality and computational requirements .
motion corrected ct reconstruction in 4d - muct imaging a delicate balance must be maintained between motion blurring artefacts , arising when a dynamic process is imaged at an insufficient temporal resolution , and a low snr , as a result of acquiring an insufficient number of photons per projection during fast imaging .
when considering non - rigidly deforming samples , both the motion blurring and low snr can be alleviated by integrating an estimate of the deformation into the ct reconstruction algorithm .
the following describes how the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique ( sart ) 42,43 was adapted to incorporate a warp \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ bar { u }(\ bar { x },\,{ t }_{ p })$$\ end { document } u ( x , tp ) into the projection and back - projection steps .
important to note here is that the warp is indeed a function of time , where tp is the instant at which projection p is acquired. with a fixed exposure time texp for each projection , the timescale of a dynamic acquisition is thus set by tp = t0 + p.texp .
in this way , a ct reconstruction reflects the state of an object at a time instant tau which can be approximated by averaging the time indices across the set stau of ntau projections used to reconstruct the 3d volume ( cfr.44 ) : 3 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ tau =\ frac { 1 }{{ n }_{\ tau }}\ sum _{ p \ in { s }_{\ tau }}{ t }_{ p }$$\ end { document } tau = 1ntausumpinstautp to reconstruct the time instant tau , the sart algorithm iteratively implements a sequence of three steps while looping ( randomly or in a well - defined scheme ) over each projection in stau .
first of all , a projection image \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ hat { p }}_{ p }$$\ end { document } p ^ p is simulated from the intermediate solution mu ( n ) at iteration n by estimating the line integral of the x - ray attenuation coefficient along the rays which connect the detector pixel j to the x - ray source .

the goal is now to go beyond the local time stationarity assumption , and adapt the reconstruction algorithm to cope with deformations ( cfr.25,26 ) .
it is assumed that the deformation fields can be described by dense displacement fields \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ bar { u }}_{ p }(\ bar { x })$$\ end { document } u p ( x ) , known in advance29 or estimated through any registration technique .
important here is the indexation ' p ' , which indicates that the \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ bar { u }}_{ p }$$\ end { document } u p describes the displacement of the object at time instant tp , when the projection pp is acquired .
given this definition , the projection step ( 4 ) and back projection step ( 6 ) of the sart reconstruction algorithm can be adapted to : 7 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ hat { p }}_{ p,j }^{( n )}={ l }_{ j }\ sum _{ i \ mathrm {= 0 }} l {\ mu }^{( n )}({\ bar { x }}_{ ji }+{\ bar { u }}_{ p })$$\ end { document } p ^ p,j ( n )= ljsumi = 0lmu ( n )( x ji + u p ) 8 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mu }^{( k +\ mathrm { 1 )}}({\ bar { x }}_{ m })={\ mu }^{( k )}({\ bar { x }}_{ m })+{ c }^{( k )}({\ bar { o }}_{ s },\,{\ bar { x }}_{ m } - {\ bar { u }}_{ p }({\ bar { x }}_{ m }\ mathrm {))}.$$\ end { document } mu ( k + 1 )( x m )= mu ( k )( x m )+ c ( k )( o s,x m - u p ( x m )) .
equations ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) also give some hints on how the motion correction can be efficiently implemented .
in a first , brute force approach the deformation transform could be executed across the entire intermediate reconstruction volume .
in handling a projection pp , the reconstruction volume is thus reverted to its state at that time .
after the back projection , the volume is then deformed back to the reference time .
this amounts to a twofold resampling of the entire volume , which for one , is a computationally demanding task , especially because it needs to be executed during each sart iteration , but foremost , might also induce an interpolation error to be carried and accumulated across the many sart iterations .
in this work , a somewhat more lightweight implementation is considered , that uses a non - parametric displacement vector field as an overlay to the reconstruction volume .
the major advantage of this approach is that the three displacement vector components ( ux , uy and uz ) can be stored in the texture memory of a gpu .
using the texture 's built in trilinear interpolation capabilities , a displacement vector can be sampled , which is then used to redefine the position at which the mu - volume is sampled .
while this approach introduces virtually no overhead with respect to the original sart implementation ( more specifically only three texture memory fetches and three additions ) , there are some limitations to be considered : the approach requires more memory , as now three extra volumes need to be stored in gpu ram .
however , the displacement vector volumes do not have to be represented at the same resolution level as the mu - volume .
a down - sampling can be carried out , of course at the cost of some loss in the displacement field 's accuracy .
the parametrisation of the registration technique used to estimate the displacement vectors is lost .
this does not mean that the registration procedure itself will not benefit from a more advanced parametric motion model .
in the sart iterations , the vector field will simply not be sampled according to this motion model .
a b - spline sampling model could be implemented on the gpu , but then the advantages of using textures will have to be sacrificed .
the technique falls or stands with a good model for the displacement field 's evolution at each time point tp. indeed , this last remark is crucial , but since a registration procedure between a fixed image at time tf and a moving image at tm only yields a single displacement field without any information on its temporal information , not a lot of choices are left for the parametrisation of its temporal behaviour .
in this work , we use a simple linear evolution of a displacement field 9 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ bar { u }}_{ p }(\ bar { x })={\ bar { u }}_{ m }(\ bar { x })\ frac {{ t }_{ p } - {\ tau }_{ f }}{{\ tau }_{ m } - {\ tau }_{ f }}.$$\ end { document } u p ( x )= u m ( x ) tp - tauftaum - tauf .
in practice , the linear evolution will be calculated between the projection timestamp tp and the average time tau of the reconstruction set stau .
although this linear interpolation already yields a great improvement on the reconstruction , as will be shown in the results , it is important to note that more complex functions can be introduced for 4d - muct datasets containing multiple frames .
these complex functions will however increase the computational complexity and memory requirements .
evaluation parameter for the evaluation of the registration , a scoring parameter chis is used , representing the ratio of two normalised cross correlations ( ncc ) : 10 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ chi }_{ s }({ n }_{ v })=\ frac {{\ rm { ncc }}({\ mu }_{ m },\,{\ mu }_{ f }^{\ ast })}{{\ rm { ncc }}({\ mu }_{ m },\,{\ mu }_{ f })} - 1 $$\ end { document } chis ( nv )= ncc ( mum,muf *) ncc ( mum,muf ) - 1where nv is the nominal displacement , mu * is the transformed fixed image \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ mu }_{ f }^{\ ast }(\ bar { x })={\ mu }_{ f }(\ bar { x }+\ bar { u }(\ bar { x }))$$\ end { document } muf *( x )= muf ( x + u ( x )) and subscripts f and m again denote the fixed and the moving volume , respectively .
the pretence of chis is to have an indication on how good the correspondence between the transformed fixed image and the moving image really is , i.e. if the registration technique effectively removes the mismatch between the original fixed image and the moving image , which is the case if chis > 0 .

this unique gantry - based system allows to perform continuous ( i.e. without rotating back to a reference position ) ct scanning of an object which is kept stationary .
this is ideal for objects inside peripheral equipment , limiting the rotational movement of the sample due to wires and tubes connected to it. furthermore , this system is optimized for fast acquisition , reaching a full rotation in 12 seconds at a spatial resolution better than 20 mum5 .
a ct5000 compression stage ( deben uk ltd. , suffolck , uk ) was installed at the emct system and used to compress aluminium foams at a controllable strain rate .
the deformation of metal foams has been studied before with x - ray muct in literature16,17 .
besides its use as an advanced engineering material15 , due to its low weight an load bearing capacity , it has also been brought forward as a surrogate model for bone , which has a similar micro structure , though a rather brittle mechanical behaviour as opposed to the ductile nature of aluminium11,46 .
the precise properties of aluminium foams strongly depend on the way they are manufactured , leading to a wide variety in structures of an open - or closed - cell type , and with various aluminium strut thicknesses and air pore volumes47 .
the foam used here was an open cell porous aluminium foam ( 10 ppi , porosity =~ 95 %) provided by the applied thermodynamics and heat transfer group at the ugent department of flow , heat and combustion mechanics , that studies these foams in their capacity to efficiently transfer heat48. with the goal of optimising this heat transfer the foams are manufactured to have a high surface area to volume ratio , resulting in relatively thin aluminium struts ( approx. 200 mum ) .
their behaviour is still fairly predictable , as they tend to deform in a smooth plastic way , with a small amount of discrete motion events , such as buckling or brittle strut breaking .
this behavior makes these foams an ideal candidate to benchmark the registration approaches presented in this work .
a cubical aluminium foam sample , with a side length of approx. 1.5 cm , was placed in a cylindrical peek ( polyether ether ketone ) container , which is attached to the bottom ( moving ) plate of the deben compression cell .
a piston , attached to the top ( stationary ) plate , inserts itself into the peek container , as the bottom part moves upward , thus effectuating a compressive action upon the aluminium foam cube .
in a first experiment , the acquisition was performed fast with respect to the compression speed in order to minimize the motion artefacts in a single rotation .
in this experiment , the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed as a function of displacement .
the compression rate was set to 0.5 mm / min , and 60 gantry rotations measuring 700 projections per rotation were completed during the 14 min acquisition at an exposure time of 20 ms. this amounts to a total compression of approx. 8 mm or approx. 133 mum per rotation .
each of the rotations in this 34 gb dataset can be reconstructed separately , showing a relatively low degree of motion blurring .
due to the inherent contrast of the aluminium foam structure with respect to its air - filled background , the low snr of 14 sec rotations was not an issue .
in a second experiment , our framework was evaluated as a tool to reduce motion artefacts in a single ( 360 ) rotation .
to achieve this , the compression rate was fixed at 0.1 mm / min while imaging it with a standard single rotation cone beam acquisition using 1500 projections .
three different exposure times ( 160 ms , 320 ms and 640 ms ) were selected , corresponding to a scanning time of 4 , 8 and 16 minutes and a compression of 0.4 mm , 0.8 mm and 1.6 mm , respectively .
an overview of the scanner settings for both experiments is given in table 1 .

results varying displacement in the first experiment , a large series of muct scans was acquired continuously with an increasing displacement at a well chosen compression speed to minimize motion artefacts in a single rotation .
as such , the registration can be scored as a function of displacement , retrieving the optimal working range of the methods .
the scoring curves for the three different registration methods can be observed in fig. 1 , which is obtained by progressively registering the first registration to the reconstruction of a rotation further in time .
the value plotted on the abscissa of this figure is the displacement of the compression stage nv in units of voxels ( of 40 mum each ) .
it should be noted that this nominal value is a maximum for the displacement of all the voxels , and the mean displacement is much less .
as a reference , this nominal displacement amounts to approximatelyy 3.3 voxels per rotation .
figure 1 scoring curves for demons , phase flow and b - spline registration for the aluminium foam acquisition .
the b - spline method performs best overall , providing qualitative registrations up to very high deformations as indicated by its flat maximum .
notably , the curves in fig. 1 show a maximum , implying that the initial deformations are not large enough for the registrations to significantly boost the ncc , and that the algorithms lose track of deformations that are too large .
the maximum should thus be interpreted as the optimal state of deformation at which the registration algorithms are most effective .
more importantly , beyond the maximum the registration results are not to be trusted entirely .
indeed , while some regions of the images might be registered correctly , other regions might not be registered or even be distorted by the inferred deformation field .
reducing motion artefacts having proven its worth as an effective registration method , the b - spline technique is now used to estimate a displacement vector field between the first reconstruction of the aluminium foam acquisition , i.e. the fixed image , and a dataset corresponding to the b - spline scoring curve 's maximum ( see fig. 1 ) , i.e. the moving image , with a varying degree of motion artefacts. by following the motion corrective scheme discussed in the materials and methods section , several strategies can be devised to reconstruct the time instances within and even outside of the range bounded by the fixed and moving frames .
let tauf and taum denote the time stamps linked to these respective frames , then any time instant \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ tau }_{ s }\ in [{\ tau }_{ f },\,{\ tau }_{ m }]$$\ end { document } tausin [ tauf,taum ] can be reconstructed by selecting a random set s of projections in between these two time instances , which at least provides a sufficient angular sampling .
since the exposure time is constant throughout the entire experiment , the time scale may be expressed in terms of projections indices ( which is equivalent to texp being the unit of time ) , with tauf = 350 and taum = 10850 .
three scenarios are now considered to reconstruct the volume at time instance tauc = 5600 , at the centre of the interval : case 1 : the volume at time instance tauc is reconstructed with the 700 projections from its enclosing rotation , which is the standard approach .
case 2 : the volume at time instance tauc is reconstructed using 700 projections , equidistantly sampled across the interval [ tauf , taum ] .
case 3 : the volume at time instance tauc is reconstructed using 2800 projections , which is the equivalent of four complete rotations , though again equidistantly spread out across the interval [ tauf , taum ] .
due to the continuous acquisition protocol , the angular sampling is not improved as compared with case 2 .
an axial reconstruction slice for each of these three scenarios is shown in fig. 2 , with and without engaging the motion correction scheme .
the mvf , used in this correction is set out on a 2563 grid , which is decimated by a factor of two with respect to the original 5123 reconstruction grid ( of 40 mum voxels ). by incorporating this vector field , the motion blurring artefacts can effectively be eliminated , which is very clear in the second and third reconstruction case , while in the first case there is practically no motion blurring to begin with .
as an important note on case 3 , it should be mentioned that the reconstruction is actually performed with an ordered subset approach , i.e. os instead of sart with four projections in each subset .
the os approach is adopted here to avoid the inherent instability of sart at an excessive amount of iterations .
as such , due to this alternate os approach , the improved snr in case 3 can not solely be attributed to the incorporation of more projections .
finally , in comparing cases 2 and 3 to the first case , which may serve as a ground truth for reconstruction of tauc , there are some residual motion artefacts , which could not be eliminated through the motion corrected reconstructions .
figure 2 three cases showing the impact of a motion corrected reconstructions of compressed aluminium foam. from left to right : a standard single rotation reconstruction with 700 projections ( case 1 ) , a reconstruction with 700 projections spread over 14 rotations ( case 2 ) and a reconstruction with 2800 projections spread over 14 rotations ( case 3 ) .
the difference images are referred to the uncorrected reconstruction of case 1 .
the size of the visualized area is approx. 1.5 x 1.5 cm2 .
single rotation deblurring in the first experiment , motion artefacts within a single 360 rotation are negligible as the scanning speed is high .
however , in many cases the speed is limited by the required signal - to - noise ratio in the reconstruction .
this is evaluated in the second experiment , which only contains a single 360 rotation and a varying compression .
as such , we aim to estimate a deformation field by strategically defining sub - acquisitions in the acquired datasets , that reflect at least two different states of motion ( fixed and moving ) of the aluminium foam cube .
the logical choice is to assign the fixed and moving frames to the reconstructions of the two short scans , that are separated furthest in time within the bounds of the full rotation , i.e. the angular ranges [ 0 , 180 + 2gamma ] and [ 180 - 2gamma , 360 ] ( see fig. 3 ) , where gamma denotes the half cone opening angle , indicating the minimum amount of data required to reconstruct a cone - beam dataset49 .
the maximum compression reached in the 16 min scan , is approximately the same as the compression reached up to the maximum of the b - spline scoring curve in the previous experiment , i.e. 1.6 mm versus 1.75 mm , respectively .
the 16 min acquisition is thus already situated at the limits of deformation that can be registered with the b - spline technique .
moreover , the fixed and moving images , how they are defined here , are expected to also show a certain degree of motion blurring , which may hinder the registration step .
figure 3 the angular ranges of the sub - reconstructions used for motion correction of a single rotation muct scan .
in fig. 4 , a vertical slice for the motion blurred reconstructions of the 4 , 8 and 16 minute acquisitions are compared to their motion corrected versions , where the deformation vector field between the short scan sub - acquisitions is incorporated into the reconstructions .
most of the motion blurring artefacts are eliminated , even in the relatively long 16 min scans .
however , new artefacts are introduced in the reconstruction of the 16 min acquisition ( corresponding with a very large deformation ) , as the highly - attenuating bottom plate of the compression stage enters the registration window .
the discrepancy between this large displacing feature , and the implicit assumption of zero displacement at the registration window boundaries , leads to a form of temporal aliasing .
in general , most registration techniques fail on the image boundaries , especially when matter enters or exits through them .
indeed , to explain the unexpected loss or gain in image intensity and features , boundary sources and sinks should be incorporated into the registration models , a future development that fits into the discussion section .
figure 4 reconstruction of a single rotation acquisition with and without motion correction by registering the short scan sub - acquisitions .
most of the motion artefacts are eliminated , yet for the 16 min acquisition an aliasing artefact arises .
this can be attributed to the bottom plate of the compression stage that gradually enters the registration window .
most registation techniques have difficulties to handle this sudden introduction of extra image features .
the size of the visualized area is approx. 1.5 x 1.3 cm2 .
discussion purely based on the scores in fig. 1 alone , the b - spline method is clearly superior to the others , providing robust and qualitative registrations up to very a high deformation ( nv =~ 100 voxels ) as indicated by its flat maximum .
moreover , the b - spline method is also very fast ( under 1 minute per registration of a 2563 displacement grid ) , despite the fact that it is inherently more complex , specifically in its higher order resampling steps .
this speed is a direct result of the excellent rate at which a set of b - splines can approximate a function , i.e. it can accurately represent ( smooth ) functions with a relatively small amount of control grid points .
in the results of the single rotation motion correction , presented in fig. 4 , only one iteration has been performed .
a logical next step is to iterate the motion correction approach to gradually eliminate the motion artefacts in the short scan sub - acquisitions .
it is plausible to assume that in doing so , better estimates for the deformation vector field can be found at each iteration .
however , the deformation vector field did not significantly change from iteration to iteration , implying that its solution is stuck in a flat optimum .
as a result , the image quality also did not improve significantly by performing multiple iterations .
on the contrary , the aliasing artefacts introduced through a motion correction of the 16 min scan seemed to be amplified , and persisted throughout further iterations ( fig. 5 ) .
intuitively , the flat nature of the deformation field optimum can be explained by considering that the short scan reconstructions are corrected by deformation vector fields , whose estimates are based on these same reconstructions .
in the light of consistency , it is logical that more iterations will not produce widely different deformation vector fields , or at least vector fields that will further promote the motion correction .
a future , potential improvement may be found in higher order temporal parametrisations of the vector field , i.e. other than eqn .
( 9 ) , by taking into account multiple time instances through a short scan window that slides across the entire acquisition .
figure 5 multiple iterations in a motion corrected reconstruction of a single rotation acquisition .
these images show the incremental differences between the results of the current and the previous iterations. by performing multiple rotations the image quality is not significantly improved .
moreover , the temporal aliasing artefacts in the 16 min acquisition are amplified persistently throughout several iterations .
the size of the visualized area is approx. 1.5 x 1.3 cm2 .
next to their motion corrective potential , registration techniques also show a great potential towards the analysis of a sample 's material characteristics .
indeed , a strain tensor can be mapped across an entire sample through a proper differentiation of the deformation vector field .
for example , when the strains are small enough , cauchy 's strain tensor can be considered. by adopting simplifications such as a linear elastic and isotropic material model , a stress field can be deduced .
an example hereof is shown in the supplementary materials ( movie 1 ) , which visualizes the magnitude of the stress vector as a function of time during compression of the aluminium foam .
though this is only an exemplary result which does not yield correct quantitative results given the inelastic deformations of the aluminium foam structure , it illustrates the potential of this framework in materials sciences , where ultimately material properties can be calculated from the comparison between the estimated displacements and fem simulations based on the images .
as such , this framework can provide a large added value in a combination with an in - depth modelling of the deformation itself , e.g. through finite element models. by doing this , x - ray muct could be elevated from a simple attenuation imaging technique to a way of characterising a sample 's material properties at a micro - structure level .

osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures are a menace to the elderly generation causing diminished quality of life due to pain and deformity .
at first , conservative treatment still is the method of choice .
in case of resulting deformity , sintering and persistent pain vertebral cement augmentation techniques today are widely used .
open correction of resulting deformity by different types of osteotomies addresses sagittal balance , but has comparably high morbidity .
besides conventional vertebral cement augmentation techniques balloon kyphoplasty has become a popular tool to address painful thoracic and lumbar compression fractures .
it showed improved pain reduction and lower complication rates compared to standard vertebroplasty .
interestingly the results of two placebo - controlled vertebroplasty studies question the value of cement augmentation , if compared to a sham operation .
even though there exists now favourable data for kyphoplasty from one randomised controlled trial , the absence of a sham group leaves the placebo effect unaddressed .
technically kyphoplasty can be performed with a transpedicular or extrapedicular access .
polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) - cement should be favoured , since calcium phosphate cement showed inferior biomechanical properties and less effect on pain reduction especially in less stable burst fractures .
common complications of kyphoplasty are cement leakage and adjacent segment fractures .
rare complications are toxic pmma - monomer reactions , cement embolisation , and infection .
kyphoplasty vertebroplasty osteoporosis spinal fractures introduction osteoporosis and pathological osteoporotic fractures are common findings in the elderly population .
the age - standardised annual incidence of vertebral compression fractures ( vcf ) is 10.7 / 1000 in women and 5.7 / 1000 in men , increasing markedly with age [ 1 ] .
at the age of 75 to 79 the annual incidence was 29.3 / 1000 in women and 13.6 / 1000 in men .
due to the continued aging of our population , vcf represent a major cause of disability and are a burden to the national healthcare budgets [ 2 ] .
non - surgical management with pain control and physical therapy - assisted mobilization has for a long time been the only treatment option in vcf .
unfortunatelty a great number of patients remain functionally impaired after vcf , and some of them are severely handicapped due to chronic back pain [ 3 ] .
the functional and physical consequences of vcf lead to anxiety , depression , and have devastating impact on interpersonal relationships and social roles [ 4 ] .
it is therefore no surprise that untreated vcf contribute significantly to shorter life - expectancy both in women ( mortality ratio 1.66 , p < 0.01 ) and even greater in men ( mortality ratio 2.38 , p < 0.0001 ) within one year after onset of symptoms [ 5 ] .
indications for cement augmentation while medical therapy of osteoporosis improves dramatically , the restoration of quality of life is still a major issue in vcf treatment .
osteoporotic kyphotic compression fractures often lead to a anterior shift of the sagittal plumb line and increased load of the anterior vertebral column , which may cause further compression fractures [ 6 ] .
this cascade of sequential compression fractures is eventually causing the typical hump of the elderly , with significant thoracic kyphosis and low pelvic incidence , forcing the patient to bend hips and knees to maintain sagittal balance [ 7 ] .
galibert et al [ 8 ] presented the first cases of successful vertebral augmentation by intravertebral injection ( vertebroplasty ) of polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) in patients with vertebral haemagiomas .
later , vertebroplasty was successfully introduced for the management of osteoporotic compression fractures [ 9 ] .
the primary goal of vertebroplasty is pain relief by stabilization of the vcf , improving indirectly pulmonary function and patient quality of life [ 10 ] .
the biomechanical understanding of increasing anterior column load with progressing kyphosis leading to subsequent vcf established the basic rationale for kyphoplasty. with this technique , partial reduction of vcf is possible by transpedicular intracorporal balloon expansion and retention by pmma cement augmentation [ 11,12 ] .
the results of one multicenter randomised controlled trial found shortened and improved functional recovery after kyphoplasty with a low rate of complications if compared to non - surgical treatment [ 13 ] .
despite the advances in percutaneous augmentation techniques the conservative medical therapy cannot be replaced .
vcf without initial kyphosis , no consecutive sintering and a satisfactory and quick response to conservative treatment should be treated conservatively .
furthermore , since lack of reimbursement in most countries kyphoplasty causes an economic burden , many patients are not willing to take .
beyond that , it has to me emphasised , that it remains unclear whether the benefits of kyphoplasty outweigh its complications .
two placebo - controlled vertebroplasty - studies have sobering results with regard to pain and functional outcome after cement augmentation with vertebroplasty , if compared to a sham - operation [ 14,15 ] .
in both studies the sham procedure included percutaneus needle insertion and opening of pmma - monomer mixture to simulate the specific odour .
the sham - controlled trial by buchbinder et al [ 14 ] in 78 patients with mri - confirmed , fresh and painful vcf found no beneficial effect of vertebroplasty when compared to a sham procedure .
a very similar study by kallmes et al [ 15 ] investigating 131 patients found similar results .
this study had already after 3 month significant higher cross - over of 43 % in the control - group ( p < 0.001 ) diminishing the quality of this study .
furthermore only outpatients were included in this study , which means that no patients being hospitalised due to acute vcf entered the study .
the randomised controlled trial by rousing et al [ 16 ] found no greater improvement in back pain in patients treated with vertebroplasty when compared to medical therapy .
interestingly they found a significant improvement in the barthel - score after 12 month ( p < 0.02 ) indicating improved function , [ 17 ] .
as a result to the above - mentioned results several authors abandoned the use of vertebroplasty [ 18 - 20 ] while others are hesitant and question the quality of the sham - controlled vertebroplasty trials [ 17,21 ] .
it is unclear whether the results of the multicenter randomised kyphoplasty trial could be reproduced if sham - controlled [ 13 ] .
in table 1 the authors present clinically proven guidelines for indications and contraindications of kyphoplasty .
table 1 guidelines for indications and contraindications for kyphoplasty indications for kyphoplasty - radiologically confirmed fresh compression fracture ( ao type a1 ) ( mri shows oedema or x - ray / ct - scan proven fracture not older than 3 months ) - failure of 2 - 6 weeks of conservative treatment including pain medication and physiotherapy ( pain on visual analogous scale ( vas ) above 4 of 10 ) contraindications for kyphoplasty - burst - fractures ( in some a3.1 - fractures possible ) - flexion - / distraction and rotational injuries ( ao type b and c ) - medical contraindications ( bleeding disorders , sepsis , etc ) - pmma - allergy due to the increased demand in cement augmentation techniques , procedures similar to kyphoplasty have been developed .
one competitor is vesselplasty ( r ) ( a - spine ) , where a porous balloon is inflated within the fractured vertebral body and filled with cement without removing the balloon , thus reducing the risk of cement leakage [ 22 ] .
another new product is the sky ( r ) bone expander ( disc - o - tech ) , an expandable polymer bone tamp abandoning the use of cement , which had favourable results in clinical case series [ 23 ] .
then there is the staxx ( r ) fx system ( spine wave ) where a vcf is reduced percutaneously by gradual insertion of stacked peek - chips into the vertebral body to reduce and stabilise the fracture [ 24 ] .
indications for combined cement augmentation and posterior instrumentation lately kyphoplasty has been discussed as an alternative therapy even of burst fractures in elderly patients .
this is especially true in case of ao type a3.1 fractures , where it could be applied instead of a posterior - only or 360 degrees stabilisation [ 25 ] .
in many of these cases further sintering of the fractured vertebra with posterior dislocation of an instable fragment with spinal stenosis is a feared complication [ 26,27 ] .
thus several surgeons perform posterior instrumentation of the adjacent vertebrae to protect the posterior wall and to improve the sagittal profile [ 28 ] .
this can be done using percutaneous posterior instrumentation or with a conventional open technique [ 28 - 30 ] .
possible disadvantages of this technique are due to segmental fusion an increased load of the adjacent segments with degeneration , and possible implant loosening with loss of correction due to low bone quality .
cement augmentation of the implanted pedicle screws can reduce the complication rate regarding the latter mentioned problem [ 31 ] .
limitations of kyphoplasty and indications for open reduction and stabilisation if multiple vcf lead to kyphosis with fixed sagittal imbalance , cement augmentation will address the fracture pain but not global imbalance .
major spinal imbalance can be a cause of significant functional disability leading to reduced quality of life .
increased kyphosis may additionally cause subsequent vcf due to an increased anterior load [ 32 ] .
the anterior location of the sagittal plumb line in fixed sagittal imbalance will lead to falls with possible further fractures and morbidity .
therefore the indication for correction of global sagittal imbalance may be given in severe cases .
as both open and closing wedge procedures are associated with complications leading to disabling morbidity surgeon are often hesitant to perform these operations in patients with multiple comorbidities [ 33 ] .
due to the osteopenic bone quality often long instrumentations are required .
unfortunately these an increased risk of adjacent vcf and pedicle fractures [ 34 ]. with regard to open sagittal corrections there is growing evidence that the posterior - only pedicle subtraction osteotomy is superior to multiple smith - petersen osteotomies , allowing greater correction with lesser operation time [ 35,36 ] .
operation technique of kyphoplasty percutaneous bilateral transpedicular kyphoplasty the bilateral transpedicular approach is the standard kyphoplasty access for the thoracolumbar spine , enabling a symmetric reposition and augmentation of the vcf .
firstly , the fracture is reduced under fluoroscopic control by positioning and traction .
then biopsy needles are used to enter the fractured vertebra on both sides through the pedicle ( figure 1 ) .
if fluoroscopy confirms correct transpedicular placement of the needles in both planes , a k - wire is placed through the jamshidi biopsy needle into the vertebral body close to the anterior wall .
then over the k - wire the access is widened with the osteointroducer .
then empty bone - fillers are used to form a cavity for the safe placement of the balloons .
under fluoroscopic control two balloons are positioned anteriorly within the vertebral body , and then the balloons are inflated under manometric control .
in fresh fractures up to 150 psi balloon pressure are mostly enough , but sometimes up to 300 psi are necessary to reduce a partially healed compression fracture .
one has to be careful not to fracture the endplates or the posterior wall , which could lead to cement leakage .
after successful reduction the cavity is filled with bone - cement from both pedicles .
this step has to be performed with careful fluoroscopic control .
normally the cement should have a tooth - paste - like viscosity and should not stick to the surgeons' gloves when testing the viscosity .
finally the introducers are removed .
figure 1 transpedicular approach for balloon kyphoplasty .
after entry in the craniolateral pedicle ( red cross ) in the p - a - projection ( a ) , the medial cortex of the pedicle is first breached when the vertebral body is entered in the lateral projection ( blue cross ) ( b ) .
after preparation of the working channel a balloon can be placed in the vertebral body .
percutaneous unilateral extrapedicular kyphoplasty due to the anatomical characteristics of the thoracic spine central placement of the balloons can be difficult .
firstly , the introducer often does not fit in the narrow pedicles of the thoracic spine .
then the low angulation of the pedicles does not allow a central placement of the balloons disabling adequate reduction in some cases .
thus in the thoracic spine extrapedicular accesses gain increasing popularity , avoiding pedicle perforation with possible neurological damage or intraspinal cement leakage .
most surgeon prefer the transcostovertebral access from far lateral ( figure 2 ) , guided to the collum costae into the costotransversary space to the cranio - posterior wall of the fractured vertebra , the jamshidi needle with the tip just penetrating the lateral pedicle at its base [ 37,38 ] .
in the view from posterior the needle passes above of the transverse process and meets the pedicle at the craniolateral circumference .
the lateral view confirms the placement of the tip of the needle close to the base of the pedicle .
in an axial view the needle is seen to pass through the costovertebral gap , between the neck of the rib and the lateral pedicle circumference , towards the base of the pedicle .
then the posterolateral cortical wall is opened with a jamshidi cannula and widened as described above with k - wire and osteo - introducer .
to allow central placement of the balloon in the vertebral body a greater angle than in the transpedicular placement has to be sought .
this often requires a 7 to 10 cm off - midline percutaneus approach .
a single balloon is then used for reduction and the cavity is then filled with cement as described above .
figure 2 unilateral extrapedicular costotransversary approach for balloon kyphoplasty .
following the cranioposterior part of the respective rib into the costotransversary space ( c ) allows extrapedicular access to the vertebral body in the thoracic spine .
due to the far lateral approach a single balloon is placed in the middle of the vertebral body ( a , b ) .
open unilateral interlaminary kyphoplasty open interlaminary kyphoplasty should be reserved for cases where an open approach has to be performed to decompress neurological structures , and the spinal canal has to be accessed anyway [ 39 ] .
after open decompression the dural sac is retracted medially and the posterior wall of the fractured vertebra exposed .
now kyphoplasty can be performed with a single balloon positioned under fluoroscopical guidance in the centre of the vertebral body .
after kyphoplasty the spinal canal has to be investigated for cement leakage .
this method must be restricted to levels below the conus medullaris to avoid myelopathy due to manipulation within the spinal canal .
open anterior kyphoplasty in rare cases kyphoplasty may be performed using an anterior access , too [ 40 ]. through a minimally - invasive anterior access the biopsy needle may be placed directly on the anterior wall of the fractured vertebra and a single balloon be placed into the vertebral body .
then under fluoroscopical control the fracture is reduced and cement is applied .
technical considerations operation room setup both general an local anesthesia have been successfully applied for the procedure [ 41 ] , but many surgeons favour general anestesia allowing closed reduction in a relaxed patient. by patient positioning only , more than 70 % of vertebral height restoration can be achieved .
placing the patient in prone position lordosating the fractured segment by pillows or by bending the table will lead to reduction of the fracture with ligamentotaxis [ 42 ] .
as in most percutaneus surgical techniques implant positioning and accuracy is controlled with fluoroscopic image intensifiers .
correct positioning of the image intensifier will lead to much lesser radiation dose for the surgeon .
placement of x - ray tube in the image intensifier on the opposite side of the surgeon will causes up to 10 times less radiation exposure [ 43 ] .
navigation balloon placement accuracy can be significantly improved and the radiation exposure during kyphoplasty can be reduced by as much as 76 % , if computer - assisted fluoroscopic navigation is applied [ 44,45 ] .
while relying on the navigator during the transpedicular balloon placement , balloon inflation and cement injection have to be performed under fluoroscopic control to minimise endplate fractures and cement leakage .
eggshell procedure an eggshell - procedure may avoid cement leakage in vcf suscpicious for endplate or posterior wall damage [ 46 ] .
after reduction with the kyphoplasty balloon a small amount of doughy cement is injected into the cavity , and then the balloon reinserted and reinflated .
once the cement hardens the cavity can be filled with cement within the " eggshell " , preventing cement leakage .
choice of cement most vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures have been performed using polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) cement to augment the fractured vertebra .
the increasing availability of injectable calcium phosphate ( cap ) cement led to its application in the augmentation of compression fractures as an alternative to pmma .
advantages are high biocompatibility , no systemic toxic monomers , osteoinductive capacity , and close to isothermal cristallinisation .
disadvantages are besides less clinical long - term experience , lesser compressive strength than pmma [ 47 ] , and the risk of early resorption , leading to defects prone to re - fractures [ 48 - 50 ] .
the available data does not encourage the clinical use of cap - cement in burst - fractures , flexion - distraction injuries , or rotational instable fractures [ 48,51 ] .
results and complications of kyphoplasty fourteen years after the first vertebroplasty was performed in 1984 , balloon kyphoplasty challenged the conventional augmentation procedures promising less complications and sagittal reconstructive ability .
until now several non - randomized prospective controlled trials have been published comparing kyphoplasty to non - surgical treatment and vertebroplasty ( table 2 ) .
besides pain improvement and quality of life , correction of deformity and intra - and postoperative complications were investigated .
the recently presented preliminary 1 - year - results of the multicentrical randomized controlled fracture reduction evaluation ( free ) study present in the kyphoplasty group a significant improvement of the quality of life ( eq - 5d ( euroqol ) , p < 0.001 ) , pain ( vas , p < 0.0001 ) , and function ( sf - 36 ( short form health survey ) , p < 0.0001 , odi , p < 0.0001 ) after 1 month ( n = 149 ) controlled against non - surgical treatment ( n = 151 ) [ 13 ] .
these treatment - effects diminished dramatically until the 12 - month follow - up , but were still significantly better than non - surgical treatment for quality of life as measured with eq - 5d ( p < 0.05 ) .

the comprehensive meta - analysis of lee et al [ 52 ] summarized all published kyphoplasty complications .
cement leakages occurred in 14 % of all cases , but only 0.01 % were symptomatic .
new vertebral fractures occurred in 17 % .
taylor et al [ 53 ] found in their metaanalysis furthermore spinal stenosis with spinal cord compression occurred 0.16 % of all cases .
radiculopathy was found in 0.17 % of all cases .
furthermore there are anecdotal reports of infections after kyphoplasty [ 26 ] .
the overall mortality was 4.4 % , and the perioperative mortality was 0.13 % [ 53 ] .
conclusions kyphoplasty is - in the hands of an experienced spine surgeon or radiological interventionalist - an effective tool to treat pain caused by thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures , but the severity of pulmonary pmma cement embolism and the urgent need of immediate decompression in relevant spinal stenosis after cement leakage , require an anaesthesiologist and a spinal surgeon on call .
the complication rate of kyphoplasty is dramatically lower than in alternative open instrumented procedures , and the immediate pain reduction is significantly greater in kyphoplasty compared to conservative treatment .
therefore its application remains a pillar in vcf treatment .

background clinical improvement in inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) treated with methotrexate and 6 - mercaptopurine ( 6 - mp ) is associated with a decrease in pro - inflammatory cytokines .
this has been presumed to indicate the mechanism of action of methotrexate and 6 - mp. although controversial , there are increasingly compelling data that mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis ( map ) may be an etiological agent in some or all of ibd .
we hypothesized that the clinical efficacy of methotrexate and 6 - mp in ibd may be to simply inhibit the growth of map .
methodology the effect on map growth kinetics by methotrexate and 6 - mp were evaluated in cell culture of two strains each of map and m. avium using a radiometric ( 14co2 bactec ( r )) detection system that quantifies mycobacterial growth as arbitrary " growth index units " ( gi ) .
efficacy data are presented as " percent decrease in cumulative gi " (% - deltacgi ) .
principal findings the positive control antibiotic ( clarithromycin ) has >= 85 % - deltacgi at a concentration of 0.5 microg / ml. the negative control ( ampicillin ) has minimal inhibition at 64 microg / ml. map atcc 19698 shows >= 80 % - deltacgi for both agents by 4 microg / ml. with the other three isolates , although more effective than ampicillin , 6 - mp is consistently less effective than methotrexate .
conclusions we show that methotrexate and 6 - mp inhibit map growth in vitro .
each of the four isolates manifests different % - deltacgi .
these data are compatible with the hypothesis that the clinical improvement in patients with ibd treated with methotrexate and 6 - mp could be due to treating a map infection .
the decrease in pro - inflammatory cytokines , thought to be the primary mechanism of action , may simply be a normal , secondary , physiological response .
we conclude that henceforth , in clinical studies that evaluate the effect of anti - map agents in ibd , the use of methotrexate and 6 - mp should be excluded from any control groups .
introduction mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis ( map ) causes johne 's disease [ 1 ] in cattle worldwide .
johne 's disease is clinically evocative of inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) in humans .
the possibility that map may be zoonotic [ 2 ] is the subject of much interest [ 3 ] [ 4 ] (& see [ 5 ] for review. ) since first seeing our map rna data [ 6 ] , we have posited in private , in peer reviewing manuscripts [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , and at professional congresses that map is the primary and most culpable , potential etiological agent for some or all of ibd .
in the therapy of ibd , ( and several other inflammatory diseases ) both methotrexate and 6 - mp are used because of empirical efficacy , even though their precise mechanism of action is unknown .
[ 9 ] [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] their use is attended by clinical improvement that is associated with a decrease in pro - inflammatory cytokines .
consequently , prevailing medical dogma posits that the mode of action of methotrexate and 6 - mp , is to decrease the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines , and as a consequence the " inflammatory " response that is the consequence of these cytokines is diminished .
this results in a clinical improvement in diseases that are conventionally conceptualized as being primarily " inflammatory. " both methotrexate and 6 - mp interfere with dna replication .
methotrexate acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase , folate generation and the consequent production of adenine. [ 12 ] the mechanism of action of 6 - mp is to substitute for guanine in dna replication. [ 12 ] because prokaryotes must synthesize their own folic acid , they should be more susceptible to folate inhibition than eukaryotes .
it is noteworthy that there are two distinct doses in human clinical use for both methotrexate and 6 - mp. each agent has a " high " dose , ( used in to treat reticuloendothelial malignancies [ 13 ] , [ 14 ]) and a " low " dose ( used to treat " inflammatory " diseases .
[ 15 ] [ 16 ]) we hypothesized that the clinically relevant mechanism of action of " low " dose methotrexate and 6 - mp in the therapy of ibd , may , in whole or part , be due to the inhibition of map growth .
if this hypothesis is correct , the decrease in the pro - inflammatory cytokines , heretofore considered the primary mechanism of action of these two agents , could simply represent a secondary phenomenon .
the observed decrease in pro - inflammatory cytokines could be ascribed to the treatment of the instigating map infection .
to evaluate this hypothesis we have studied the effect of methotrexate and 6 - mp on map and other m. avium isolates in culture .
the effect of methotrexate has been evaluated on e. coli [ 17 ] , 6 - mp on salmonella typhimurium [ 18 ] and both agents on m. tb .
[ 19 ] to our knowledge , however , this is the first time that these two agents have been evaluated for their effect on map .
methods this study was approved by the research & development committee at the vamc bronx ny ( 0720 - 06 - 038 ) and was conducted under the institutional radioactive materials permit (# 31 - 00636 - 07 ) .
culture in this study , we used four well - characterized strains of mycobacteria .
two were map , a bovine isolate , atcc 19698 ( atcc rockville md ) and " dominic " a human isolate from an individual with crohn 's disease ( originally isolated by r. chiodini [ 20 ].) the m. avium subspecies avium strains ( hereinafter called m. avium ) were atcc 25291 ( veterinary source ) and m. avium 101 [ 21 ] .
primary cultures were performed in middlebrook 7h9 medium supplemented 9:1 with adc ( both difco. detroit mi ) .
all media for map ( liquid and agar plates ) were supplemented with 1 microg / ml mycobactin j ( allied monitor. fayette mo. ) the detergent tween 80 ( recommended to prevent mycobacterial clumping ) renders clinically resistant strains of map inappropriately susceptible to antimicrobials in cell culture .
[ 22 ] accordingly in our experiments , tween 80 was not used .
to minimize mycobacterial clumping , one ml of the log phase bacterial culture (~ gi of 500 ) in 7h12 medium in the bactec vial was passaged >= 20 times through a 25 gauge needle [ 23 ] on a one ml syringe ( becton - dickerson franklin lakes nj ) , added to five ml 7h9 medium supplemented with mycobactin j , vortexed and left standing at ambient temperature for 30 minutes .
subsequently , only the upper three of the six ml. were used for inoculations .
the number of cfu 's inoculated was determined by plating serial dilutions of the inoculum onto 7h10 plates ( difco ) supplemented for map with mycobactin j ( 1 microg / ml ) and counted when colonies were easily visualized ( two to six weeks ) .
at the time of passage , additional aliquots were plated onto blood agar plates to ensure that inocula were not contaminated with non - mycobacterial organisms .
to confirm the identity of the species studied , dna was obtained from the isolates ( high pure template prep .
kit roche diagnostics indianapolis in ) , pcr amplified using primers for is 900 ( map ) [ 24 ] and is 901 / 2 [ 25 ] ( m. avium & specific subspecies including silveticum ) as described .
[ 6 ] amplicon sizes were determined using 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis .
dna sequence analysis was performed commercially , ( genewiz north brunswick nj ) with sequence comparison performed using blast ( nlm ) .
the positive antibiotic control clarithromycin ( gift of abbott chicago il ) was dissolved in methanol .
the negative control antibiotic was ampicillin ( sigma st louis mo ) which was dissolved in water .
methotrexate and 6 - mercaptopurine ( both sigma ) were dissolved in naoh at a maximal final concentration of 50 mm ( sigma ) .
control inocula were performed using the maximum concentration of each diluent .
agents were tested in serial dilutions from a minimum of 0.05 microg / ml to a maximum of 64 microg / ml ( see individual figures ) .
aliquots of chemicals being evaluated were prediluted , stored at - 80degreesc , thawed , used once and discarded .
data are presented as cumulative growth index ( cgi ) units +/ - sd ( when necessary , see individual figures ) .
the effect ( or lack thereof ) of each agent is presented as the percent decrease in cgi units (% - deltacgi ) , compared to the control cgi of that isolate in the diluent ( e.g. methanol or naoh ) that was used for the specific chemical being evaluated .
cgi data for each experiment is presented until the day prior to any gi reading exceeding the assay limit of " 999 " ( table 1 ) .
raw data was archived onto excel , and the cumulative results transferred to prism ( graphpad , san diego ca ) for final graphing .

accordingly , for experimental reproducibility , bacterial passage and harvesting were performed when the gi was ~ 500 .
quantification show that the cfu 's of the m. avium isolates are approximately 10 fold higher (~ 1x107 cfu 's / ml ) , compared to map (~ 1x106 cfu 's / ml ) ( table 1 ) .
because of the difference in growth kinetics , m. avium cfu #' s inoculated were >= 10 fold lower than map ( table 1 ) .
both of our map isolates ( atcc 19698 & dominic ) were mycobactin j dependant ( data not presented ) , were is 900 positive and had >= 99 % homology with the genbank accession nc _ 002944 of map ( data not presented ). m. avium atcc 25 291 was positive for is 902 and m. avium 101 was negative for both ( data not presented ) .
in our pivotal study ( figure 1 ) the positive control antibiotic , clarithromycin exhibits >= 86 % - deltacgi at the lowest concentration evaluated ( 0.5 microg / ml ) .
the negative control antibiotic ( the beta - lactam , ampicillin ) has a minimal effect ( 21 % - deltacgi ) at the 32 microg / ml. in contrast , 6 - mp has an initial >= 43 % - deltacgi starting at 1 microg / ml increasing to >= 84 % - deltacgi at 4 microg / ml. methotrexate has 40 % - deltacgi inhibition at 2 microg / ml and >= 75 % - deltacgi at 4 microg / ml .
( figure 1 . )
10.1371 / journal.pone.0000161.g001 figure 1 shown is a bar graph of the cumulative gi data evaluating map atcc 19698 .
each drug dilution was studied in duplicate .
error bars are sd. there are three control inoculations , labeled on the abscissa as " 0 , 00 & 000 .
the left hand " 0 " had an equal number of cfu 's as in each drug studied .
" 00 " = 10 & " 000 " = 100 fold dilutions .
in each control the maximum concentration of diluent used for each agent ( methanol for clarithromycin , water for ampicillin and naoh for methotrexate and 6 - mp ) was added .
clarithromycin is most effective and ampicillin is the least effective at decreasing map growth .
both methotrexate and 6 - mp are as effective as clarithromycin in map % - deltacgi at a dose of 4 microg / ml. we additionally evaluated the effect of methotrexate and 6 - mp against two map and two m. avium isolates ( figure 2 ) .
in these studies , the map 19698 results replicate the data presented in figure 1 showing ~ 80 % - deltacgi inhibition at 4 microg / ml for both 6 - mp and clarithromycin .
in contrast , map dominic shows less susceptibility to 6 - mp ( 41 % - deltacgi at 4 microg / ml ) compared to map 19698 ( 84 % - deltagi at 4 microg / ml ) .
both m. avium isolates show less susceptibility to 6 - mp than to methotrexate ( figure 2 ) .
the diluent control inoculum for the m. avium atcc 25291 appears to exhibit completely inhibited growth ( figure 2 : bottom left graph , left hand column. ) however , over the following two days this methanol control entered log phase growth , whereas the vials at every clarithromycin dose continued to show no evidence of growth ( data not presented . )

" 0 " is diluent control with an equal cfu inoculum and " 00 " is a 1:10 dilution of the water control inoculum .
drug concentrations are indicated on the abscissa .
for each isolate , drug dose was studied in singlicate .
for all four bacteria , clarithromycin has achieved maximal inhibition by 1 microg / ml. for map atcc 19698 , replicating data presented in figure 1 , both methotrexate and 6 - mp % - deltagi is the same as for clarithromycin by 4 microg / ml. note that with the other map isolate ( dominic ) and both m. avium isolates , methotrexate is more effective at a lower dose than is 6 - mp. the lower cumulative gi ( seen on the ordinate ) for the m. avium isolates is ascribable to their more rapid growth and earlier reaching the off scale bactec gi values of " 999. " discussion the efficacy of both methotrexate and 6 - mp in the therapy of ibd is uncontested .
prevailing dogma accepts that the decrease in pro - inflammatory cytokines that attends their use is responsible for their beneficial effect .
in this study we show that both methotrexate and 6 - mp inhibit the growth kinetics of map .
in the event that ibd is eventually accepted as being due to a map infection , our data are compatible with our hypothesis that methotrexate and 6 - mp may be impairing map growth .
if so , the decrease in pro - inflammatory cytokines could simply be an appropriate physiological response to their antibiotic - like activity .
we additionally show that there is a variation in response of the four different isolates to our tested agents .
three of the four isolates are more sensitive to methotrexate than to 6 - mp. these observations need to be further evaluated in multiple isolates from a variety of individuals and clinical settings where development of map resistance may be responsible for a clinical deterioration .
we conclude that antibiotic susceptibility testing will probably be indicated for putative map infections , just as they are for other ( myco ) bacterial infections .
as is conventional with antibiotic susceptibility studies , we compared agents on an equal weight basis .
however , methotrexate ( mw 450 ) is a much larger molecule than 6 - mp ( mw 170 ) with a molar ratio of ~ 3:1 .
thus , in comparison to 6 - mp on a molar basis , methotrexate is an even more potent inhibitor of growth than our data indicate .
additionally , a simple extrapolation of our data to a comparison with conventional " antibiotics " therapy is difficult .
the dosages of methotrexate and 6 - mp in clinical use have not been titrated according to standard antibiotic conventions .
dosage has been individualized , influenced by such factors as hematological toxicity and patient tolerance .
there is a remarkable discrepancy between the doses of methotrexate and 6 - mp , used to treat different diseases , that merit discussion .
each agent has a " high " dose , ( used in to treat reticuloendothelial malignancies [ 13 ] , [ 14 ]) and a " low " dose ( used to treat " inflammatory " diseases .
[ 15 ] [ 16 ]) for methotrexate the antineoplastic dose may be 1500 - 5000 mg m2 by iv infusion over 2 - 24 hours ( for a 70 kg man this could equate to 7500 mg in 24 hours. )[ 26 ] in contrast , for ibd a typical dose is 25 mg po or im weekly .
we suggest that this 300 - fold disparity may reflect the difference between treating a eukaryotic reticuloendothelial malignancy and a prokaryotic mycobacterial ( specifically we hypothesize in the case of ibd a map ) infection .
our data are compatible with the thesis , but do not conclusively prove , that map may be zoonotic .
corroboration of our data will be necessary and multiple additional studies , both basic and clinical need to be performed .
however , we suggest that , as a consequence of our observations antecedent clinical studies that have evaluated anti - map agents need to be reevaluated and that henceforth such studies will need to exclude methotrexate and 6 - mp from " control " or placebo subjects .
conclusions and recommendations we show that both methotrexate , as well as 6 - mp , interfere with the growth of map , an organism that may be the etiological factor for some , or all of ibd .
some of the implications of these observations are discussed .

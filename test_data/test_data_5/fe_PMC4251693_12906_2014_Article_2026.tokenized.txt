background sonchus arvesis is traditionally reported in various human ailments including hepatotoxicity in pakistan .
presently we designed to assess the protective effects of methanolic extract of sonchus arvesis against carbon tetrachloride induced genotoxicity and dna oxidative damages in hepatic tissues of experimental rats .
methods 36 male sprague - dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of sonchus arvensis against ccl4 induced genotoxicity , dna damages and antioxidant depletion .
rats of normal control group were given free access of food and water add labitum .
group ii rats received 3 ml / kg of ccl4 ( 30 % in olive oil v / v ) via the intraperitoneal route twice a week for four weeks .
group iii and iv received 1 ml of 100 mg / kg b.w. and 200 mg / kg b.w. sme via gavage after 48 h of ccl4 treatment whereas group v was given 1 ml of silymarin ( 100 mg / kg b.w. ) after 48 h of ccl4 treatment .
group vi only received 200 mg / kg b.w. sme .
protective effects of sme were checked by measuring serum markers , activities of antioxidant enzymes , genotoxicity and dna dmages .
results results of the present study showed that treatment of sme reversed the activities of serum marker enzymes and cholesterol profile as depleted with ccl4 treatment .
activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes of liver tissue homogenate ; catalase ( cat ) , superoxide dismutase ( sod ) , glutathione peroxidase ( gshpx ) , glutathione - s - transferase ( gst ) and glutathione reductase ( gsr ) were reduced with administration of ccl4 , which were returned to the control level with sme treatment .
ccl4 - induced hepatic cirrhosis decreased hepatic glutathione ( gsh ) and increased lipid peroxidative products ( tbars ) , were normalized by treatment with sme .
moreover , administration of ccl4 caused genotoxicity and dna fragmentation which were significantly restored towards the normal level with sme .
conclusion these results reveal that treatment of sme may be useful in the prevention of hepatic stress .
keywords sonchus arvensis carbon tetrachloride liver cirrhosis lipids peroxidation issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background carbon tetrachloride ( ccl4 ) , a clear , colorless , volatile , heavy and nonflammable industrial liquid , widely used to inducede free radical toxicity in various tissues of experimental animals such as liver , kidneys , heart , lung , testis , brain and blood [ 1 ] .
ccl4 is converted through hepatic microsomal cytochrome p450 into trichloromethyl - free radical (. ccl3 or . ccl3oo ) [ 2 ] which in turn , initiate lipid peroxidation process [ 3 , 4 ] .
the most widely accepted mechanism of ccl4 induced hepatotoxicity is the formation of free radicals which is a rate limiting process in tissue peroxidative damage [ 5 , 6 ] .
this free radical and related reactive species may cause oxidative stress , which produces major interconnected changes of cellular metabolism , increases the serum marker enzymes , dna fragmentation , and destruction of the cells by lipid peroxidation [ 7 ] .
the accumulation of lipid peroxides introduces hydrophophilic moieties and alters membrane permeability and cell function which causes the loss of hepatic integrity and depressed hepatic function resulting in hepatotoxicity and congestive hepatic failure [ 8 ] .
to protect the body from such deleterious effects of free radicals , several endogenous enzymatic and non enzymatic systems are provided , but when the formation of free radicals is excessive , additional protective mechanisms of dietary antioxidants may be of a great importance [ 9 ] .
maintaining the balance between reactive oxygen species and natural antioxidants is therefore crucial , and could serve as a major mechanism in preventing damage by oxidative stress induced by toxic agents .
cooperative defense systems that protect the body from free radical damage include the antioxidant nutrients and enzymes [ 10 ] .
antioxidant and radical scavengers have been used to study the mechanism of ccl4 toxicity as well as to protect tissue cells from ccl4 induced damage by breaking the chain of lipid peroxidation [ 11 ] .
numerous studies have shown that horticultural crops and fruits are sources of diverse antioxidant properties , which can protect body against ccl4 , induced oxidative stress [ 12 ] .
sonchus arvensis is traditionally used in the treatment of kidney stone , gallstone , dysentri , haemorrhoid , gout arthritis , appendicitis , mastitis , hypertension , burn wound , and bruises .

discussion metabolism of various metabolites and exogenous toxic chemicals ( pesticides , drugs , metals ) , are takes place inside the hepatic tissue causes the formation of free radicals which may be extensively toxic than the parent compound .
ccl4 , an extensively studied hepatotoxin is converted into its metabolites such as ccl3 radicals which are involved in the liver pathogenesis including cirrhosis , genotoxicity of hepatic tissue and hepatic carcinoma [ 8 ] .
our present results showed that exposure of rats to ccl4 caused significant increase in the secretion of alt , ast , alp , gamma - gt and cholesterol profile due to hepatic injuries caused by their free radicals [ 22 ] .
co - administration of 100 mg / kg and 200 mg / kg b.wsme significantly improved the pathogenesis of liver , might be due to the presence of poly phenolic constituent as was reported by xiao et al .
[ 23 ] .
sme might have the ability to chealat free radical which in turn lowering serum cholesterol , triglycerides and lipid peroxide were reported in other investigations while working on hepatoprotective effects of plant extract against ccl4 induced hepatic injury in rats [ 24 , 25 ] .
super oxide dismutase and catalase are the main antioxidant enzymes which play an important role in oxidative dysfunction against free radicals induced oxidative stress .
results of our investigation showed that ccl4 administration in rats result in depletion of antioxidant activities of sod and cat , which is in close relationship with other reports [ 26 , 27 ] and have an agreement with investigation following ccl4 intoxication [ 28 ] .
gsh is an important protein thiol which coordinates body defense system against oxidative stress .
gsh effectively scavenge free radicals and other reactive oxygen species ( e.g. , hydroxyl radical , lipid peroxy radical , peroxy nitrite and h2o2 ) directly or through gshpx , gst and gsr [ 29 ] .
present study revealed that induction of ccl4 caused significant reduction in gsh contents as well as significant depletion in the activity of phase ii metabolizing enzymes ; gsh - px , gst and gsr [ 30 ] .
co - treatment of sme in rats markedly improved the activity of metabolizing enzymes as mentioned in literature .
tbars is a major reactive aldehyde resulting during the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufa ) a useful indicator of oxidative damages [ 31 - 34 ] .
results revealed that 100 mg / kg and 200 mg / kg b.w. sme significantly improved lipid peroxidation products as was altered by treatment of ccl4 in rats , which has been well documented [ 35 ] .
according to marnett [ 36 ] the product of lipid peroxidation react with dna to form adducts mig , the mutagenic pirimedopurinone adduct of deoxyguanosine .
like other macromolecules such as lipids and proteins , nucleic acids are also attacked by free radicals to cause oxidative dna damage .
in the present study , carbon tetrachloride degrades the dna of liver tissue of rats by generating free radicals .
on the other hand , co - treatment of sme appreciably reduced the dna fragmentation % which also exposed by dna ladder assay banding pattern .
similar results were reported by murugesan et al .
[ 37 ] while studying the protective effects of kombucha tea against ccl4 induced oxidative stress in kidneys of rats .
conclusion these results demonstrate that administration of sme may be useful in the treatment and prevention of hepatic genotoxicity and oxidative stress .

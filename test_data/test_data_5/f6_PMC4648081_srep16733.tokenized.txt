fralpha and frbeta , two major isoforms of the folate receptor family , generally have different cellular distribution and tissue specificity .
however , the presence of frbeta in breast tumors , where fralpha is normally expressed , complicates this situation .
prior to applying any fr isoform - based diagnosis and therapeutics , it is essential to monitor the expression profile of fr isoforms in a more accurate manner .
an lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics assay was developed and validated in this study because of the lack of suitable methodology for the simultaneous and specific measurement of highly homologous isoforms occurring at low concentrations .
fralpha and frbeta monitoring was achieved by measuring their surrogate isoform - specific peptides .
five human breast cell lines , isolated macrophages and 60 matched pairs of breast tissue samples were subjected to the analysis .
the results indicated that frbeta was overexpressed in tumor - associated macrophages ( tams ) but not epithelial cells , in addition to an enhanced level of fralpha in breast cancer cells and tissue samples .
moreover , the levels of the fr isoforms were evaluated according to the histology , histopathological features and molecular subtypes of breast cancer .
several positive associations with pr / er and her2 status and metastasis were revealed .
the clinical relevance of specific protein isoforms is becoming increasingly clear , particularly in cancer diagnosis and treatment .
however , the ability to discover , validate and utilize protein isoforms in clinical practice is severely limited by the existing laboratory tools .
among these attempts , the investigation of the folate receptor ( fr ) family is facing a more complex situation .
this protein family can mediate uni - directional folate transport into cells and is one of the most potent targets in cancer1 .
among the four identified isoforms of fr ( alpha , beta , gamma , and delta ) , fralpha and frbeta are 38 kda membrane - associated proteins that have a high affinity for folate2 .
in addition , they are both active when the folate supply is low or when rapid cell growth requires elevated folate uptake .
despite these similarities and the known high frequency in cancers , the two isoforms have different cellular distribution patterns and tissue specificity34 .
in general , fralpha is expressed in certain normal epithelial cells , and its expression is markedly enhanced in several carcinomas , including breast cancer , whereas frbeta is often overexpressed in non - epithelial malignancies4 .
thus , fralpha and frbeta are not expected to be observed together .
however , several recent reports have shown the presence of frbeta as well as fralpha in breast tumors5 .
the subsequent investigation suggested that the detected frbeta was actually not present on the tumor itself , but on tumor - associated macrophages ( tams ) that accumulated at the tumor sites5 .
as a leading cause of death in women , breast cancer is highly complex , with cancer cells constituting only one of many distinct cell types .
indeed , within breast tumors , cancer cells represent only a small proportion (< 20 %) of the total cell number6 .
the remaining cell types , including tams , are often grouped together under the collective term of " tumor - associated stroma " .
the appearance of frbeta in tams suggested that frbeta may be a useful breast cancer marker and a potential target for anti - cancer therapy , in addition to fralpha , because breast cancer development and progression are highly dependent on specialized tumor - associated stroma7 , as tumors rarely develop in the absence of this microenvironment .
however , the expression profile of fr isoforms across the disease is unknown , making it difficult to apply fr isoform - based diagnosis and therapeutics .
it is essential to monitor the level of fr isoforms in a more accurate manner to comprehensively assess their clinical significance .
to date , numerous reports have demonstrated that protein isoform distributions are related to clinical effects .
however , there is a lack of suitable methods for the simultaneous and specific measurement of highly homologous isoforms occurring at low concentrations in biological samples .
antibody - based techniques , including western blotting8 and immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) 9 , have been traditionally employed to measure protein levels .
using these techniques , the detection of protein isoforms is mainly based on a panel of antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes and different electrophoresis motilities10 .
while these techniques provide valuable information on protein levels , they remain to be improved due to the lack of the necessary specificity and reproducibility11 .
in addition , one isoform is usually targeted at a time because the methods for developing multiple colors are complicated due to fluorescence spectral overlap12 .
furthermore , it should be noted that one can compare the expression levels of each isoform only when the antibody recognizes an identical epitope per isoform10 .
more importantly , most of the assays that have been developed are qualitative or semi - quantitative but not quantitative13 .
liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) - based targeted proteomics may represent a promising alternative method for protein isoform quantification .
in a targeted protein analysis , selected / multiple reaction monitoring ( srm or mrm ) on a triple quadrupole instrument is generally employed , and lc - ms / ms assays are developed to detect fragment ion signals from proteolytic peptides representing the targeted protein1415 .
the precursor / product ion m / z pair , referred to as the transition , is used to yield the chromatogram .
the area under the chromatogram curve provides a quantitative measurement for each desired peptide and target protein .
thus , simultaneous monitoring of protein isoforms may be achieved by measuring the surrogate peptides that are specific to each isoform16 .
indeed , a similar approach has been successfully used to monitor several protein isoform occurrences161718 .
this study first developed and validated an lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics assay for the simultaneous quantification of fralpha and frbeta in human breast cells and tissue samples .
this assay was then applied to the quantitative analysis of fr isoforms in the mcf - 10 a normal breast cell line ; the mcf - 7 / wt , t47d , mda - mb - 231 and mcf - 7 / adr breast cancer cell lines ; macrophages isolated from fresh breast tissue ; and 60 pairs of primary human breast tumors and adjacent normal tissue samples .
the resulting values were compared to those obtained using western blotting and ihc .
finally , the biological distribution of the frs and their differential levels based on breast cancer histology , clinical histopathological features and molecular subtypes were also discussed .

results and discussion selection of fralpha and frbeta isoform - specific surrogate peptides in complex proteomes , a major challenge frequently encountered when identifying candidate biomarkers and targets of anti - cancer therapy is to establish quantitative assays that distinguish between highly homologous proteins .
among the various assays for protein quantification , lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics is a particularly valuable method of choice .
for a targeted proteomics assay , it is often not trivial to reconnect surrogate peptides to a precise protein of origin due to the presence of shared proteolytic peptides from protein isoforms .
thus , the most critical step in the experimental design and assay establishment for measuring protein isoforms is the selection of surrogate peptides that are isoform - specific .
in this study , both fralpha and frbeta are 38 kda in size , as previously mentioned .
the result of amino acid sequence alignment indicated an 80 % identity between fralpha and frbeta ( fig. 1s ) , leading to fewer available peptides that are isoform - specific and meet the general criteria for peptide selection ( e.g. , uniqueness and adequate response ) 2324 .
after excluding the peptides that were either not isoform - specific or not unique to the proteins , we performed an lc - ms / ms analysis of protein digests with the list of potential peptides to determine the tryptic peptides that were present in the greatest abundance .
as a result , the most abundant peptides were the doubly charged ions of 159gwnwtsgfnk168 for fralpha and 153gwdwtsgvnk162 for frbeta20 .
further evaluation using the synthetic reference peptides showed that the tryptic and reference peptides co - eluted perfectly and exhibited identical fragmentation patterns .
in addition , these sequences were found to be unique to fr proteins ( accession no .
p15328 ( folr1 _ human ) and p14207 ( folr2 _ human )) using a blast search , suggesting that they could be used to specifically quantify fralpha and frbeta .
the product ion spectra and extracted ion chromatograms of 159gwnwtsgfnk168 and 153gwdwtsgvnk162 are shown in fig. 1. the characteristic sequence - specific b ions and y ions were indicative of these peptides .
therefore , synthetic stable isotope - labeled peptides , 159gwnwtsgf * nk168 and 153gwdwtsgv * nk162 , were prepared .
the peptides were labeled at the corresponding phenylalanine ( 13c9 ) and valine positions ( d8 ) and eluted at the same retention time ( 7.77 min and 8.05 min ) as the non - labeled peptides .
the product ion spectra of the stable isotope - labeled peptides were also acquired and validated ( data not shown ) .
development and validation of an lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics assay the completeness and reproducibility of trypsin digestion must be carefully assessed to provide an accurate and precise amount of the proteins .
though 100 % digestion efficiency is generally ideal for protein quantification , reproducible digestion is more than acceptable in this study because pure proteins were used to prepare the standards .
thus , only a brief description was given here .
following a similar process provided in our previous work2025 and using the substrate peptide containing the same peptide sequence ( to mimic a piece of the targeted protein ) , the digestion efficiency was calculated by comparing the response ratios of the tryptic peptide after digestion and the equimolar synthetic peptide standard in the digestion .
the estimated values were 97.2 % and 95.4 % for 159gwnwtsgfnk168 and 153gwdwtsgvnk162 , respectively .
another important step in protein quantification is to generate high - quality mrm26 .
in this study , the transitions that gave the best signal - to - noise and limit of quantification ( loq ) for 159gwnwtsgfnk168 and 153gwdwtsgvnk162 were both afforded by the product ion b2 m / z 243.9 .
these characteristic mass patterns were also observed using the stable isotope - labeled internal standards .
using the transitions of m / z 598.7 - - > 243.9 , m / z 603.4 - - > 243.9 ( is ) and m / z 575.2 - - > 243.9 , m / z 579.3 - - > 243.9 ( is ) , an lc - ms / ms assay was developed and validated to measure fralpha and frbeta .
solid phase extraction was selected as the technique of choice for sample cleanup and enrichment in this study because , as previously reported , it has shown great promise for sample preparation25 .
calibration standards containing both proteins were prepared to reduce the analysis time7 .
the calibration curves were constructed using a weighted linear regression model with a weighting factor of 1 / x2 .
the relative peak area ratio of the analyte and the stable isotope - labeled internal standard was plotted against concentration .
because similar results were obtained for the cellular and tissue extracts , only the validation for the tissue samples was presented .
representative calibration curves are shown in fig. 2s .
the loq was 500 ng / ml. chromatograms of the lloqs and blanks are shown in fig. 3s .
notably , the lloq in the present study was the lowest standard on the calibration curve if the following conditions were met : 1 ) the analyte response at the lloq should be at least 5 times the response compared to blank response and 2 ) analyte response should be identifiable , discrete , and reproducible with a precision of 20 % and accuracy of 80 - 120 % 2728 .
the results indicated that no significant interfering peak was found at the retention time for peptides in the chromatogram of the blank matrix , in agreement with the condition that the analyte response at the lloq should be at least 5 times the blank response .
this outcome demonstrated that the extent of depletion was significant in the immuno - depleted membrane fraction , which was also confirmed by western blotting ( fig. 4s ) .
thus , the fr - depleted membrane fraction can be utilized as a surrogate matrix in this study .
to further examine the specificity of the mrm transitions for quantification , a second product ion of the peptides was evaluated here for confirmation ( i.e. , m / z 598.7 - - > 261.1 and m / z 575.2 - - > 358.9 ) 2930 .
the values determined for the mrm transition pairs of each peptide were consistent for each standard and throughout the calibration range ( table 1s ) .
after confirmation , the transitions of m / z 598.7 - - > 243.9 ( fralpha ) and m / z 575.2 - - > 243.9 ( frbeta ) were employed for sample analysis .
it is worth mentioning that utilization of mrm transitions with more than one fragment ion for one precursor is often as a confirmative measure3132 , but it can increase the detection specificity of peptides derived from low - abundant proteins in some cases3334 .
because the quantification values for a single protein could be surrogate peptide - dependent3035 , a second surrogate peptide under a single condition was used for additional confirmation29 .
due to the absence of an appropriate second peptide for frbeta , only fralpha was processed using another surrogate peptide 77dvsylyr83 ( fig. 5s ) , and the result will be evaluated in the next section .
the precision and accuracy of the assay were assessed by observing the response of the qc samples with four different concentrations of peptides in three validation runs .
the intra - and inter - day precisions were expressed as the percent coefficient of variation (% cv ) .
the accuracy was obtained by comparing the averaged calculated concentrations to their nominal values (% bias ) .
the results are listed in table 2s .
both accuracy and precision were <= +/ - 15 % ( lloq , <= +/ - 20 %) 28 .
three freeze - thaw cycles , 48 h post - preparative ( 4 degreesc ) and 12 h room temperature stabilities were also conducted here .
the results indicated that the stability of the peptides and proteins was acceptable ( data not shown ) .
simultaneous quantification of fralpha and frbeta in breast tissue samples the lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics assay developed and validated above was first applied to the detection and quantification of fr isoforms in human breast tissue samples .
sixty matched pairs of breast tissue samples were subjected to analysis .
in the normal tissue , the levels of fralpha and frbeta were accurately quantified as 1.20 +/ - 0.66 ng / mg breast tissue ( range : 0.34 - 3.29 ng / mg ) and 0.79 +/ - 0.43 ng / mg ( range : 0.33 - 2.17 ng / mg ) , respectively , and in the tumor tissue , the levels of fralpha and frbeta were 3.02 +/ - 1.73 ng / mg ( range : 0.31 - 7.51 ng / mg ) and 2.18 +/ - 0.90 ng / mg ( range : 0.69 - 5.46 ng / mg ) , respectively ( fig. 2 ) .
the fralpha result was not significantly different from that using 77dvsylyr83 as surrogate peptide .
notably , frbeta was undetectable in the normal tissue from 19 patients ( 32 % , < loq ) .
a two - way comparison using the mann - whitney test showed that normal tissue samples have significantly lower levels of the fr isoforms compared to the tumors ( p < 0.0001 ) .
the fralpha and frbeta reference intervals were calculated as - 0.104 ( 95 % ci , - 0.345 - 0.137 ) ng / mg to 2.49 ( 95 % ci , 2.25 - 2.73 ) ng / mg , and - 0.046 ( 95 % ci , - 0.240 - 0.148 ) ng / mg to 1.63 ( 95 % ci , 1.43 - 1.82 ) ng / mg , respectively , using medcalc ( r ) software version 11.6.1 and data from the normal tissue .
thus , 35 and 46 of the 60 tumor samples contained fralpha and frbeta levels , respectively , and exceeded their estimated reference intervals .
compared to fralpha , frbeta expression was more pronounced and less variable in breast tumors , implying that frbeta may be a better candidate for certain patients .
furthermore , an evaluation of the patients' breast cancer histology indicated that both invasive ductal carcinoma ( idc ) and invasive lobular carcinoma ( ilc ) had an enhanced level of the frs , and the increase of these receptor proteins was more significant in idc ( table 1 ) .
because the frequency and degree of fr expression were likely associated with the cancer characteristics , their levels were also compared according to the clinical histopathological features ( i.e. , tumor size , tumor grade , and lymph node status ) and molecular subtypes of idc ( table 2 ) .
the fralpha result indicated that the histopathological characteristics may be correlated to its expression , which was in agreement with previous reports36 .
however , the obtained differences were not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
more importantly , we found that fralpha was negatively associated with pr / er and her2 expression in breast cancer .
a possible explanation could be that the hormone receptor - positive tumors often had a lower incidence of fralpha .
there is evidence indicating that fralpha expression is regulated by steroid hormones , particularly estrogens37 .
specifically , 7beta - estradiol can down - regulate fralpha expression by direct action of er on the p4 promoter of fralpha .
thus , it is not surprising to also find enriched fralpha in clinical triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) patients36 .
the previous result that idc patients tended to have enhanced fralpha may be explained because triple negative breast cancer ( tnbc ) is usually invasive and usually begins in the breast ducts38 .
different from fralpha , metastasis was the only factor closely associated with the level of frbeta in this study .
because the occurrence of frbeta in breast tumors remained undetected until recently , the role of frbeta in disease development has been rarely reported .
based on the previous findings , frbeta is expressed by tams that enhanced tumor progression by promoting tumor invasion , migration and angiogenesis2539 .
thus , tams were often abundantly present in malignant tumors , as should be frbeta .
while macrophage infiltration density is also reported to be strongly associated with er / pr and her2 status3940 , we found that these hormones were not significantly associated with frbeta .
the data show that the fralpha and frbeta levels in individual patients do not fluctuate in concert ( fig. 3a ) .
further regression analysis revealed that there was a positive relationship between fralpha and frbeta , whereas the obtained correlation coefficient ( r = 0.285 , p > 0.05 ) suggested that this relationship was low ( fig. 3b ) .
despite their differential tissue distribution , the expression ratio of frbeta to fralpha was still processed across the patient samples in this study .
as a result , most samples indicated a substantial difference in the pairwise ratio of the fr isoforms .
therefore , the ratio of the fr isoforms may have the potential to stratify breast cancer patients into subgroups , which deserves further testing with a larger sample size .
comparison of targeted proteomics and ihc for fr isoform analysis in general , the proteins in tissue samples are typically determined using ihc. from the ihc images ( fig. 4 ) , we should note that one of its advantages is the capability to discern between tumors containing a small subpopulation of fr - positive cells and those showing a low level of fr in 100 % of the cells41 .
moreover , the co - localization of frbeta and cd68 , which is frequently used as a marker of macrophages , proved once again that frbeta occurred in tams from the stroma , but not in epithelial cells .
however , the ihc assays are normally not quantitative , are difficult to standardize across laboratories and are subject to an inherent intra - and inter - observer variability , despite tremendous efforts to establish guidelines and protocols42 .
the subjective counting of stained cells in ihc ( e.g. , 0 , no membrane staining ; 1 + , faint partial ; 2 + , weak - to - moderate ; 3 + , intense complete ) could cause large deviations in cancer diagnosis , treatment and monitoring .
in addition , frs are also expressed in normal breast tissue to a certain degree43 .
most importantly , current immunohistochemical methods to study the expression of multiple proteins or protein isoforms in a single tissue section suffer from several limitations ( e.g. , cross - reactivity of antibodies ) , even though several antigen retrieval / unmasking methods have been developed44 .
alternatively , single immunohistochemical stains in which multiple sections are cut from a tissue sample can be performed , and each section is stained for a different protein .
however , each tissue section contains different cells , which may be problematic in some situations .
in this study , we compared the fralpha result of the lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics to that obtained from ihc .
although the immunostaining was not scored , the percent positive cells (%) were counted for evaluation in this study45 .
ten samples showed no staining , whereas targeted proteomics provided the quantitative values for all of the samples .
the methods were compared using a passing - bablok regression analysis , which was performed using the statistical program medcalc version 12.7.4 ( medcalc software ) .
as shown in fig. 5 , the lc - ms / ms method was comparable to ihc ( y = 0.055 x + 0.931 , with no significant deviation from linearity ( p = 0.68 )) .
the estimated confidence intervals of the slope and intercept were ( 0.049 - 0.063 ) and ( 0.608 - 1.170 ) , respectively .
notably , the values determined in targeted proteomics are no longer subjective and can easily be used for reference range establishment and further substratification according to the clinical histopathological features .
quantification of fralpha and frbeta in breast cells and tams isolated from breast tumors real clinical samples , such as breast tissue , are so complex that the tumor cells and other cell types where fralpha and frbeta may be present are not easily separated .
these different cell types represent variable portions of the whole tissue and may also exhibit heterogeneity in terms of the level and type of fr expressed .
to determine the possible cell type - specific fr isoform expression , we quantified the fr isoforms in a number of human breast cells ( i.e. , the mcf - 10a normal cell line , the mcf - 7 / wt , t47d and mda - mb - 231 drug - sensitive cancer cell lines , and the mcf - 7 / adr drug - resistant cancer cell line ) using the lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics assay .
the results are shown in table 3 .
notably , several studies have investigated the expression of fralpha in breast cells ; however , the results of these studies are conflicting .
some of them reported its presence in one or more cell types2046 , while others did not47 .
in this report , we detected fralpha at variable levels in all tested cell lines , and fralpha was overexpressed in the cancer cells compared to the normal cells .
in addition , the mda - mb - 231 cells had the greatest abundance of this fr isoform. with regard to the characteristics of the cell lines , the t47d and mcf - 7 cells are er +/ pr +/ her2 - , and the mda - mb - 231 cells are triple negative ( er - / pr - / her2 - , table 3s ) .
thus , it is theoretically proposed that fralpha expression is closely related to the er / pr status of the tumor cells .
this phenomenon was in accord with the positive association between fralpha and er - observed in tissue , perhaps more importantly with tnbc36 .
because the mda - mb - 231 cell line is also a highly invasive and metastatic cell line , the metastatic activity of cells may be another factor that could be associated with the fralpha level .
moreover , the enhanced fralpha expression in the mcf - 7 / adr cells implied that this protein receptor may also be involved in the response of tumor cells to anticancer drugs and the acquisition of drug resistance .
in contrast , frbeta was not detected in any of the tested cell lines .
the failure to detect this fr isoform suggests that it is either not present or is present at much lower levels in these breast cells .
taking into account the observation of frbeta in breast tissue , frbeta should exist in cells other than cancer cells , such as macrophages .
thus , fresh breast tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples were pooled and fractionated .
the macrophage - enriched cell populations expressed frbeta .
in addition , frbeta was more abundant in tams ( 57.2 +/ - 4.6 fg / cell ) than macrophages from normal tissue ( 15.6 +/ - 1.4 fg / cell ) .
in fact , the macrophages in the normal tissue were primarily in a resting state and did not express frbeta .
the resting macrophages can become activated by stimulation such as disease .
active macrophages such as tams could have an elevated level of frbeta on their surface , and accumulated at the sites of inflammation and in tumors .
in this study , we first provided quantitative evidence of the existence of frbeta in macrophages .
subsequently , the level of frbeta was determined for an individual breast tumor .
the varying amounts of frbeta in 5 tam samples may imply its potential role as a biomarker for defining breast cancer subtypes ( table 4s ) .
to further evaluate the lc - ms / ms performance , the amount of frs in cells was also examined using western blotting ( fig. 6s ) .
compared with the qualitative / semi - quantitative results and the limited sensitivity of antibody - based method , the targeted proteomics approach provided the quantitative amounts of proteins .
conclusions in this report , the developed lc - ms / ms - based targeted proteomics assay allowed the simultaneous and accurate quantification of fr isoforms ( i.e. , fralpha and frbeta ) in biological samples .
using multiplexed isoform - specific mrm transitions , these isoforms can be quantified by ignoring their homology and real locations .
in addition to demonstrating fralpha overexpression in breast cancer cells and tissue samples , the abundance of frbeta in tams from the tumor - associated stroma was also indicated using this assay .
moreover , the findings provided evidence for the association between the level of fr isoforms and several histopathological features and molecular subtypes .
thus , this isoform - based quantitative information may lead to better cancer patient stratification with diagnostic significance .
however , additional , larger patient cohorts must be tested to determine whether fralpha and frbeta can be used alone as independent factors or in combination with other markers , and whether they are more selective for specific clinical applications in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment .
nevertheless , targeted proteomics shows potential for future studies to clarify the isoform - specific clinical significance of the fr family and also other protein isoform families .

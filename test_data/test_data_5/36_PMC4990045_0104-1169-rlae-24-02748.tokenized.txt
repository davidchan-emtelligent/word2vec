method : quantitative , exploratory , descriptive and retrospective study .
the medical records of 1447 patients , from 2005 to 2013 , were analyzed for statistically related variables , these being : profile , hospitalization diagnosis , risk factors for coronary artery disease , complications recorded during the hospitalization , length of hospitalization and cause of death .
results : the mortality rate was 5.3 % during the study period .
death was more common in females and those of black skin color , with a mean age of 65 years .
acute myocardial infarction was the most common hospitalization diagnosis .
the majority of the complications recorded during hospitalization were characterized by changes in the cardiovascular system , with longer hospitalization periods being directly related to death from septic shock .
conclusion : the data provide subsidies for nursing work with preventive measures and early detection of complications associated with coronary artery bypass grafting .
this reinforces the importance of using the data as quality indicators , aiming to guarantee care guided by reliable information to guide managers in planning patient care and high complexity health services .
descriptors : mortality health management thoracic surgery hospitals introduction coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) is considered one of the most frequent cardiac surgeries performed in the brazilian national health system ( sus ) representing 77 % of all surgeries performed in both public hospitals and philanthropic or private hospitals 1 . the decision for surgery is based on an individual analysis , taking into account factors such as the degree of angina , ventricular function , ischemic burden and coronary anatomy .
individuals with multivessel coronary disease and ventricular dysfunction , left main coronary artery obstruction or large areas of ischemia usually receive an indication for cabg 2 . over the years cabg has received two essential contributions for the improvement of surgical outcomes throughout the world , both of which were introduced by brazilian surgeons , namely : the technique of myocardial revascularization with cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) and the use of double internal mammary artery grafts 3 . thus , over the course of 40 years , cabg has undergone considerable development favoring this surgical practice .
however , over the last 20 years there has been a significant change in the profile of patients undergoing cabg , which is usually performed with older individuals with more severe heart damage , most often with comorbidities associated with cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , representing greater risk for reoperations , complications and mortality 4 . the mortality rate is usually applied by health services as a quality indicator , however , this indicator is often used in a generalized way , without knowing the exact profile of the population studied .
in an attempt to identify mortality risks related to cabg , seeking to understand the factors that influence the outcome of this surgical practice is essential for dealing with cvd .
although extensive literature shows data on the mortality rates of patients undergoing cabg 5 - 6 , few studies portray the factors associated with mortality in this type of surgery .
in the health area , nursing is the only profession that includes , in its formation , theory combined with practice in relation to health management or administration 7 . in this sense , the use of reliable indicators is essential for the effective and efficient management of care , since this allows the identification of avoidable risks , subsidizes corrective action planning and directs prevention strategies for events and complications related to cvd .
the potential of the professional nurse to contribute to the changing reality of chronic diseases should be noted , particularly regarding cvd , by identifying risk factors and preventing potential events that complicate the state of health of the individual affected by cvd , with the aim of ensuring the quality of the care provided 8 . given the previously mentioned considerations , the following question arises : what factors are associated with the occurrence of mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in a cardiology referral institution of santa catarina ?
in relation to the above question , the aim of this study was to investigate the factors associated with mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in a cardiovascular referral hospital of santa catarina .
method the study had a quantitative , exploratory , descriptive and retrospective focus and was performed in a public , cardiovascular referral hospital of santa catarina .
data were gathered from the documents , records and statistical data of the institution related to the patients who underwent cabg in the previous nine years , i.e. , between 2005 and 2013 .
data collection was carried out in three stages .
firstly , the record of cabgs conducted in the institution within the study period was obtained from the surgical center .
next , the list of deaths that occurred during the same period was requested from the statistical sector of the institution .
the manual organization of the data resulted in a single table in microsoft excel ( r ) with the record of the patients that underwent cabg and those who died after performing the surgery .
in the third stage , data collection was carried out in the medical records of those patients identified in the previous step , totaling 1447 patient records .
no medical record was excluded considering that the data collection period was established due to the quality in completing the information of the forms .
at this time , the factors associated with mortality were sought , which in this study refer to the profile of patients who underwent cabg , in the period between 2005 and 2013 , including : gender , age , skin color , cardiopulmonary bypass and type of surgery ( cabg alone or combined with other surgery ) , and specific data of patients who died due to cabg , such as : hospitalization diagnosis , risk factors for coronary artery disease ( cad ) , complications recorded during hospitalization , length of hospitalization and the main cause of death .
thus , the variables of the groups : profile , main diagnosis , risk factors , complications recorded during hospitalization and length of hospitalization were crossed with the main cause of death group .
data were analyzed using descriptive ( means , medians , standard deviation , minimum and maximum amplitude ) and inferential statistics , using the fisher - freeman - halton exact test to compare the percentage between groups ; student 's t - test to compare continuous variables ; and analysis of variance followed by tukey 's comparisons to compare the mean of more than two groups .
in addition , the odds ratio was also calculated .
for the statistical tests , a significance level of 0.05 was assumed , equivalent to a 95 % confidence interval .
for this analysis the sas version 9 software was used , with help from a statistician .
this study was related to the project entitled " the revascularized cardiac patient : the process of referral and counter referral of the health services of santa catarina " approved by the human research ethics committee of the federal university of santa catarina ( cepsh / usfc ) under number 120.184 in 2012 .
thus , for the performance of this study an amendment to the main project was made , aiming to obtain approval from cepsh / ufsc to collect data in the medical records .
the study followed resolution no .
466 / 2012 of the national health council / ministry of health , which provides guidelines and regulatory norms for research involving human subjects .
results in the period from 2005 to 2013 , 1447 patients underwent cabg in the institution chosen for this study .
a total of 455 patients ( 31.4 %) were female and 992 ( 68.6 %) male .
regarding skin color , 1104 ( 76.45 ) patients were declared white and 26 ( 1.7 %) black , with no information for 317 ( 21.9 %). of all the patients , 797 ( 55 %) underwent cabg with cpb and 650 ( 45 %) underwent surgery without cpb .
regarding the type of surgery , it was found that the majority of the patients , 1302 ( 89.9 %) , underwent cabg without any other associated surgery .
only 145 ( 10.1 %) patients underwent cabg associated with another cardiac surgery .
the results show a certain balance between the number of people that underwent cpb or not ( table 1 ) .

thus , the analysis of the relationship between the number of deaths and variables in this study was carried out .
when the annual mortality rates were considered , there was some increase over the years , especially when comparing the year 2005 , in which the mortality rate was 1.1 % , and the year of 2012 , in which this was 13.1 % , representing an increase of 12 % .
in 2013 there was a reduction in mortality from 13.1 % to 10.5 % .
regarding the age of the individuals undergoing cabg , the mean was 60.6 years , median 61 years , standard deviation 9.6 years , minimum 18 years and maximum 86 years .
the results showed a great variability , with ages between 30 - 85 years .
for those who died , the mean age was 65.1 years , median 67.0 years , standard deviation 10.5 years , minimum 38 years and maximum 86 years .
to verify whether there was a significant difference between the mean ages , student 's t - test for independent samples was performed and the descriptive level < 0.001 obtained. from this , it was concluded that the mean of group of deaths was significantly higher than the group without death .
the odds ratio for age was 1.0566 for each year .
considering 10 years , the odds ratio was 1.73 , that is , the chance of death with 10 more years of age is 1.73 times higher .
considering associated surgeries , there was some difference in the percentage of deaths with regard to cabg associated with mitral valve replacement ( mvr ) , presenting a higher percentage ( 26.7 %) , followed by cabg associated with aortic valve replacement ( avr ) ( 16.0 %) .
calculating the odds ratio for each associated surgery , compared to cabg only , it was found that for cabg associated with avr the odds ratio was 4.39 and for cabg associated with mvr the odds ratio was 8.38 , showing an increased chance of death for cabg associated with mvr .
thus , it can be concluded that there was a significant difference in the mortality according to the type of surgery .
in relation to the main cause of death for the study population , 29 ( 38.2 %) patients died due to cardiogenic shock , 16 ( 21.1 %) from multiple organ failure , 5 ( 6.6 %) acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) , 5 ( 6.6 %) septic shock , and 4 ( 5.3 %) due to cardiac arrest ( ca ) .
the other causes combined accounted for 17 ( 22.4 %) patients .
the majority of the patients hospitalized for cabg had ami as the main diagnosis , 36 ( 47.3 %) patients , followed by unstable angina ( ua ) , 17 ( 22.3 %) patients , and congestive heart failure ( chf ) and heart failure ( hf ) , both with 9 ( 11.8 %) patients .
the other diagnoses combined accounted for 5 ( 6.5 %) patients .
regarding the distribution of the causes of death by main hospitalization diagnoses , there was a tendency for the diagnosis of chf , 5 ( 55.6 %) patients , ua , 8 ( 47.1 %) patients , and ami , 13 ( 36.1 %) patients .
the percentage of death from cardiogenic shock was not significant , as shown in table 2 .
to verify whether the percentages of causes of death were the same for the diagnostic groups , fisher 's exact test was carried out and the descriptive level of 0.691 obtained , which showed no significant differences between the diagnostic groups .

the main risk factors associated with cad presented by the study population were hypertension ( ht ) , 59 ( 78.7 %) patients , smoking , 39 ( 52 %) patients , dyslipidemia , 31 ( 41.3 % ) patients , and diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , 30 ( 40 %) patients .
for the distribution of causes of death ( according to each risk factor ) fisher 's exact test was applied and a trend between the ht risk factor and death due to ca ( 100 %) was seen , followed by death due to multiple organ failure ( 87.5 %) and cardiogenic shock ( 72.4 %) , however , this was not significant .
based on table 3 , it was concluded that the smoking and dyslipidemia risk factors were closely related to death from ami ( 75 %) and ca ( 75 %) .
the descriptive level showed no significant difference between the diagnostic groups .

the complications of the cardiovascular system showed a tendency with all the causes of death .
among them , arrhythmia ( 75 %) and ami ( 50 %) showed a certain tendency with regard to death due to ami .
regarding the distribution of causes of deaths for respiratory complications , pleural effusion ( 60 %) and pneumonia / bronchopneumonia ( 60 %) showed a tendency with death due to septic shock .
regarding the distribution of causes of death for each complication of the renal system , acute renal failure ( arf ) ( 62.5 %) presented a tendency with death due to multiple organ failure .
in relation to the distribution of causes of death by infections , only death from septic shock showed a tendency .
the length of hospitalization is presented in figure 1 , which ranged from 1 to 98 days , with means of 27.9 and 70.2 days depending on the cause of death .
figure 1 mean +/ - 1 standard deviation for time of hospitalization and the main cause of death regarding the length of hospitalization and cause of death , higher means of hospitalization can be seen to be related to death from septic shock , mean of 70.2 days , median 72 days , standard deviation 20.8 days , minimum of 39 days and maximum of 92 days .
discussion the results demonstrate that the mortality rate of the study institution ( 5.3 %) was slightly above the national mean of 4.8 % 3 . with regard to the profile of patients that undergo cabg , in a study conducted in southern brazil , the age varied from 32 to 86 years and the age group with the highest incidence was between 51 and 70 years , in which 688 individuals ( 68.5 %) were male 9 . this information confirms the findings of the present study and the tendency for indication for cabg of an older , male population .
the high mortality rate was influenced by the final two years of the study , 2012 and 2013 , in which mortality rates were 13.1 and 10.5 % .
this may be related to the hiring of new professionals in the institution with less experience , causing change in the medical teams and nursing practitioners , as well as the indication for cabg of more clinically severe and older subjects , highlighting the need for cvd prevention strategies .
despite the predominant population for cabg indication being male , mortality compared by gender , in this study , showed a higher rate of death for women .
a study of cardiac surgeries performed in the sus nationwide , showed a lower mortality rate for males compared to females , 5.20 % versus 8.25 % ( p < 0.001 ) 1 . therefore , it can be stated that being female is a clinical - demographic characteristic associated with mortality in cabg 10 . older age appears as a risk factor for mortality in patients undergoing cabg .
a study conducted in brazil with , mostly male ( 56.3 %) , octogenarian patients that all underwent cabg with cpb , showed a mortality rate within the hospital of 14.8 % , more than double the national mean .
it cited cardiogenic shock ( 42.8 %) as the main cause of death 11 , in agreement with the findings of this study , which showed cardiogenic shock as the main cause of death , with an increased risk of death of 1.73 for every 10 more years of age .
regarding race , studies in southern brazil present a predominance of white patients with cabg indication , 68.9 % 10 ) and 95.7 % 12 ) in the states of santa catarina and rio grande do sul , respectively .
however , it is pertinent to consider that these studies were conducted in southern brazil , where the population is predominantly caucasian .
in a study conducted in northeastern brazil , which sought to identify the sociodemographic characteristics of patients undergoing cabg , 53 % of the patients were declared non - white 13 . in relation to the higher mortality rate in black patients undergoing cabg , there is evidence of a higher rate of deaths from circulatory system diseases in black men , as well as the association of death with the prevalence of hypertension in this race 14 . the results of this study also indicate a higher chance of death for cabg associated with other surgeries , especially valve replacement surgery .
a study conducted in southern brazil that investigated preoperative risk factors for heart valve surgery found a significant increase in the rate of death , from 8.8 % to 25 % , in patients undergoing this procedure 15 . the use of cpb in cabg demonstrated a significantly higher chance of mortality compared to its non - use .
conventional cabg in cpb is associated with a significant risk of related morbidity and mortality in older patients 16 . other studies show the use and duration of cpb in cabg as a factor related to mortality within the hospital 10 . another study confirmed the results presented here with regard to hypertension as the main risk factor for chd related to death in patients undergoing cabg .
in this same study , half of the patients were affected by acs , in which ua appeared more often in relation to ami , differing from the findings discussed that identified ami as the main hospitalization diagnosis 17 . dyslipidemia , smoking , physical inactivity , obesity , diabetes mellitus ( dm ) and unhealthy diets are cited as potential aggravating factors for impairment of health and installation of complications in cad 1 . it should be highlighted that complications related to the cardiovascular system were more representative , in agreement with a study developed in southeastern brazil , in which 24.5 % of the patients presented cardiovascular changes .
pulmonary infection was the most frequent infectious complication ( 15.3 %) , corroborating the findings of this study that showed the occurrence of pneumonia or bronchopneumonia in patients who had death related to infection .
the infected patients had longer periods of hospitalization in relation to those who did not have this occurrence recorded during the hospitalization 18 . it was found that the mean length of hospitalization presented a consistently heterogeneous variable , with a minimum of 1 day and up to 45 days , with the hospitalization period exceeded 11 days in 25 % of the cases , which indicates treatment of complex events with long stays and higher hospital costs 19 . in another study , the vast majority of patients were operated electively , after waiting a long time for the surgery , with a mean of 35.5 days 5 . both confirm the findings of this study with regard to the prolonged period of hospitalization .
thus , it is relevant for the mortality indicator to be used by health professionals and managers .
considering that , among the various professions in the health area , nurses stand out for having specific courses in their formation aimed at health management and planning , they can potentiate the use of these indicators in their practice to improve the quality of the care provided , abandoning unplanned actions and realizing the need to have a plan 20 . despite the development of interventionist actions for the individual with cvd , in high - complexity health , nursing care should mainly be based on prevention .
the administration of nursing care brings the individual close to the professional , as it considers the health - disease process in a broad way .
thus , the search for new perspectives and strategies reaffirms the importance of nursing in the care for individuals affected by cvd and sometimes submitted to cabg , as the aim is to promote well - being and quality of health of these patients , through the awareness of the existence of their problems and their consequent complications 21 . conclusion in this study , the main factors associated with the occurrence of death in patients undergoing cabg were : people with advanced age ; use of cpb ; occurrence of associated cabg ; manifestation of infection and prolonged hospitalization period .
considering that these factors were shown to directly impact on the mortality of patients , greater attention of health staff and managers to this profile is indicated .
the results of this study provide subsidies for the nursing practice with preventive measures for the cvd event , as well as in prevention and early identification of complications associated with cabg .
as limitations , the study did not address aspects frequently discussed in the literature that could influence the mortality of patients undergoing cabg , such as length of surgery , length of cpb and intraoperative complications .
the reason for this was that the study proposal was to work with aspects still little discussed in the literature , in order to seek other associations with the occurrence of death after cabg .

materials and methods thirteen cases of pathologically proved castleman , encountered in our hospital during a period of five years , were collected in this study .
the diagnoses were confirmed by surgery in all patients .
the surgical , histopathologic records , and ct images were reviewed .
results the lesion was localized in 5 and diffusely distributed in 3 cases .
pathologically , 5 cases belonged to hyaline vascular type and 3 cases belonged to plasma cell type , which 1 had retroperitoneal , 2 had mesentery and 5 had chest lesions .
on ct scan , all cases showed round or ellipse soft tissue masses , with satellite nodules in 3 cases , and calcification in 3 cases .
enhanced scanning revealed obvious enhancement in the arterial phase and continuous enhancement in the vein and delayed phase in all the lesions , enlarged blood vessels within or around the mass were displayed in 3 case .
in 3 cases , the intra - tumoral radial or fissured non - enhanced areas in early stage of enhancement were gradually filled up as the scan time was delayed .
conclusion castleman 's disease is rare and liable to misdiagnosis , a mass with benign characters , with calcification , especially delayed enhancement , can help in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis .

this work presents a controlled reduction method for the selective synthesis of different sized gold nanoclusters protected by thiolate ( sr = sc2h4ph ) .
starting with au ( iii ) salt , all the syntheses of aun ( sr ) m nanoclusters with ( n , m ) = ( 20 , 16 ) , ( 24 , 20 ) , ( 39 , 29 ) , and ( 40 , 30 ) necessitate experimental conditions of slow stirring and slow reduction of au ( i ) intermediate species. by controlling the reaction kinetics for the reduction of au ( i ) into clusters by nabh4 , different sized gold nanoclusters are selectively obtained .
two factors are identified to be important for the selective growth of au20 , au24 , and au39 / 40 nanoclusters , including the stirring speed of the au ( i ) solution and the nabh4 addition speed during the step of au ( i ) reduction to clusters .
when comparing with the synthesis of au25 ( sc2h4ph ) 18 nanoclusters , we further identified that the reduction degree of au ( i ) by nabh4 also plays an important role in controlling cluster size .
overall , our results demonstrate the feasibility of attaining new sizes of gold nanoclusters via a controlled reduction route .
gold nanoclusters size selective synthesis controlled reduction background gold nanoclusters [ 1 - 6 ] have received extensive attention owing to their interesting optical properties [ 6 - 9 ] , magnetism [ 10,11 ] , fluorescence [ 12 - 16 ] , chirality [ 17 - 20 ] , redox properties [ 21 - 27 ] , as well as potential applications in many fields such as catalysis and biological labeling [ 28 - 33 ] .
the new physicochemical properties of gold nanoclusters are largely imparted by the discrete electronic structure of the metal core due to quantum confinement effects .
the surface of the cluster may also influence some of the material properties , such as chirality [ 18,19 ] .
recently , major advances in wet chemical synthesis of nanoclusters have been achieved , and it has been possible to control nanoclusters at the atomic level .
a number of well - defined nanoclusters have been reported ; however , only a few can be obtained in bulk quantities and in high yields via facile synthetic methods [ 34 ] .
among the various thiolate - protected gold nanoclusters , au25 ( sr ) 18 has been extensively studied [ 21 - 27,35 - 41 ] .
other well - defined nanoclusters have also been attained , such as au36 [ 42 ] , au38 [ 43,44 ] , au102 [ 45 ] , and au144 [ 46,47 ] .
we previously reported a kinetically controlled synthetic approach for the synthesis of highly pure au25 ( sr ) 18 nanoclusters [ 48,49 ] .
the method involves a size focusing mechanism , that is , the initial cluster product of mixed sizes is converged to a specific size of highest stability under appropriate conditions [ 34 ]. by controlling the size range of the initial nanoclusters , one can achieve atomic monidispersity of nanoclusters [ 34 ] .
this synthetic approach constitutes a versatile strategy for gold nanocluster synthesis [ 49 ] and has been demonstrated in the synthesis of quite a number of atomically precise aun ( sr ) m nanoclusters , such as au25 , au38 , and au144 [ 34 ] .
herein , we demonstrate that a controlled reduction method can lead to different sizes of gold nanoclusters. by making a modification of the synthetic method of au24 nanoclusters [ 50 ] , we have obtained two new sizes , including au39 ( sc2h4ph ) 29 and au40 ( sc2h4ph ) 30 .
our results explicitly show that the initial growth stage of nanoclusters is critical and can be largely influenced by experimental conditions .
this method of controlled reduction has expanded the synthetic approaches for preparing nanoclusters with size control .

all glassware was thoroughly cleaned with aqua regia ( hcl : hno3 = 3:1 vol ) , rinsed with copious pure water , and then dried in an oven prior to use .
analysis tools all uv - visible ( vis ) absorption spectra of au nanoclusters in either toluene or methylene chloride were recorded using a hewlett - packard ( hp , palo alto , ca , usa ) 8453 diode array spectrophotometer .
electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired using a waters q - tof ( waters corporation , milford , ma , usa ) mass spectrometer equipped with a z - spray source .
the sample solution ( approximately 1 mg / ml ) dissolved in toluene was diluted in dry methanol ( 50 mm cesium acetate csac , 1:2 vol ) .
the sample was directly infused at 5 mul / min .
the source temperature was kept at 70degreesc .
the spray voltage was kept at 2.20 kv ; the cone voltage , at 60 v. synthesis of aun nanoclusters ( n = 39 and 40 ) haucl4.3h2o ( 0.1612 g , 0.41 mmol ) was dissolved in 5 ml water , and tetraoctylammonium bromide ( toab , 0.2541 g , 0.465 mmol ) was dissolved in 10 ml toluene .
these two solutions were combined in a 25 - ml tri - neck , round - bottom flask .
the solution was vigorously stirred ( approximately 1,100 rpm ) with a magnetic stir bar to facilitate phase transfer of au ( iii ) salt into the toluene phase .
after approximately 15 min , phase transfer was completed ; the clear aqueous phase was then removed .
the toluene solution was cooled down to 0 degreesc in an ice bath over a period of approximately 30 min under constant magnetic stirring .
after that , magnetic stirring was reduced to a slow speed ( approximately 100 rpm ) , phc2h4sh ( 0.20 ml , approximately threefold the moles of gold ) was added , and the solution was kept under slow stirring .
the solution color changed slowly from deep red to faint yellow and to colorless over approximately 1 h. after that , the speed of magnetic stirring was increased from approximately 100 to 400 rpm .
at the same time , 1 ml aqueous solution of nabh4 ( 0.44 mol / l , freshly made with ice - cold water ) was dropwise added to the toluene solution over a 15 - min period using a 1 - ml syringe .
the color of the solution turned black gradually .
after the dropwise addition of nabh4 , the reaction was allowed to further proceed overnight .

this precipitation / dissolution process was repeated with ethanol .
the crude mixture was extracted with methylene chloride / acetonitrile ( 1:9 vol ) to remove a small amount of au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 ( its optical absorption band at approximately 485 nm ) [ 51 ] .
after au20 was removed from the product , au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 nanoclusters were removed by a second extraction with methylene chloride / acetonitrile ( 1:2 vol ) [ 50 ] .
the final remaining product was collected and characterized by mass spectrometry .
results and discussion identification of au39 ( sc2h4ph ) 29 and au40 ( sc2h4ph ) 30 starting with an au ( iii ) salt precursor , the synthesis of gold nanoclusters involves two primary stages : ( a ) reduction of au ( iii ) to au ( i ) by hsr , during which the formed au ( i ) intermediate species spontaneously aggregates into polymeric au ( i ) species ( unknown structure ) , and ( b ) reduction of au ( i ) to aun ( sr ) m nanoclusters by nabh4 .
in this work , we have identified several important factors for the synthesis of nanoclusters au39 and au40 , including the stirring speed of the reaction mixture , the addition speed , and the amount of nabh4 solution to reduce au ( i ) into clusters .
the synthetic conditions reported in this work differ from the previous syntheses of au19 ( sc2h4ph ) 13 , au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 and au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 ( see ' methods' section ) [ 50 - 52 ] .
specifically , in the present work , our major modification lies in the stirring speed of the au ( i ) intermediate solution when reduced by nabh4 .
in a previous work , au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 and au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 were synthesized by controlling the stirring speed for the reduction step of au ( i ) by nabh4 ; for example , approximately 50 rpm for au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 and approximately 100 rpm for au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 .
to synthesize larger - sized nanoclusters , we rationalize that the kinetics of the reduction reaction of au ( i ) intermediate species by nabh4 may be important for potential size control .
motivated by that , we systematically varied the synthetic conditions and also compared with the typical method for au25 ( sc2h4ph ) 18 synthesis .
interestingly , we found that with the stirring speed being increased to approximately 400 rpm , the crude product ( figure 1a ) shows an optical spectrum different from that of au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 or au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 ( figure 1b,c ) .
a new absorption peak centered at approximately 800 nm was observed ( figure 1a ) , indicating that some new species have been formed in this controlled reduction process. of note , the small peak at approximately 700 nm ( figure 1a ) is due to the concurrent formation of a small amount of au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 clusters as impurities in the synthesis of the new clusters .
to remove au24 and possible au20 impurities from the product , the clusters in the crude product were precipitated by adding ethanol , and the crude product was then extracted with ch2cl2 / ch3cn ( 1:9 vol ) to selectively dissolve au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 from the product .
the remained undissolved produce was followed by a second extraction with ch2cl2 / ch3cn ( 1:2 vol ) to remove au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 .
the final remaining product is largely free of au24 and au20 impurities , as evidenced in the disappearance of the 700 - nm band in the optical spectrum ( figure 1a , red profile ) .
the relatively pure product is subject to further characterization for cluster formula determination .

we employ electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( esi - ms ) to determine the composition of the new gold cluster product .
a solution of cesium acetate ( csac , 50 mm , in dry methanol ) was added to a toluene solution of gold clusters at 1:1 or 1:2 ( vol ) .
esi - ms detects the cluster - cs adducts that are positively charged due to cs + addition to the cluster surface .
the low - mass portion of the spectrum consists of all [ csac ] xcs + signals ( figure s1 in additional file 1 ) , and residual au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20cs was also observed at m / z 7,603 ( calculated fw = 7604 for mono - cs adduct ) .
the high - mass portion ( figure 2 ) shows two peaks at m / z 11,793 and 12,127 ( figure 2a , unsmoothed spectrum ; figure 2b , smoothed ) .
these two signals are corresponding to the new clusters formed in the controlled reduction process .
both peaks indicate + 1 ions , evidenced by the unity spacing of the isotope - resolved peaks ( see figure 2a inset , for m / z 11,793 ) .
after subtracting one cs + ion ( fw = 133 ) , the masses of the two new clusters are determined to be 11,660 and 11,994 da. unfortunately , isolation of these two mixed clusters into pure ones has not been successful so far .

to deduce the formulas of the two new aun ( sc2h4ph ) m clusters based upon the esi - ms data , we first determine the minimum value of the gold atom number ( n ) , which corresponds to the limiting case of au ( i ) : sr complexes , i.e. , when n = m. this gives rise to 11,660 / 337 approximately 35 for the peak of m / z 11,660 .
we then construct candidate formulas by systematically increasing n starting from 35 .
for example , for n = 36 , we list two closest matches to the esi - determined mass of 11,660 da , one with the smallest negative deviation , i.e. , ( n , m ) = ( 36 , 33 ) , and the other with the smallest positive deviation , i.e. , ( n , m ) = ( 36 , 34 ) , see table 1 ; note that other m values for n = 36 are not pursued since they deviate more from the esi mass of 11,660 da. following this method , one can list all the possible formulas until the limiting case of 11,660 da consisting of all gold atoms , which is the upper limiting case since a certain number of thiolate ligands must be present to protect the metal core. by comparing the candidate formulas with the esi - ms - determined precise mass of 11,660 da , we readily obtain the au39 ( sc2h4ph ) 29 formula ( calculated fw = 11661 ; deviation , 1 da ) , as reflected in table 1 .
similarly , the cluster of 11,993 da is determined to be au40 ( sc2h4ph ) 30 ( calculated fw = 11,995 ; deviation , 2 da ) .
a deviation of 0.5 to 2 da is reasonable at this high mass range .

herein , we discuss some insights obtained regarding the synthetic processes of au20 , au24 , and au39 / 40 .
these four cluster species belong to a new series , as au20 and au24 are formed concurrently , albeit in small amounts , in the synthesis of au39 / 40 nanoclusters .
however , by controlling the reaction process , one may selectively produce au20 , au24 , or au39 / 40 .
when using au ( iii ) as the starting material for nanocluster synthesis , two primary stages include ( a ) the reduction of au ( iii ) to au ( i ) by hsr and ( b ) the conversion of au ( i ) to aun ( sr ) m clusters by reduction with nabh4 .
factors that are important for aun size control with n = 20 , 24 , 39 and 40 include ( a ) the stirring speed of the reaction mixture , ( b ) the addition speed of nabh4 , and ( c ) the amount of nabh4 added ( vide infra ) .
stirring speed and effect on cluster size we found the stirring speed is quite important for controlling the size and monodispersity of gold clusters .
as listed in table 2 , during stage i , the stationary condition favors the formation of au20 ( sr ) 16 nanoclusters , while slow stirring ( 50 to 100 rpm ) favors the formation of au24 ( sr ) 20 , au39 ( sr ) 29 , and au40 ( sr ) 30 .
table 2 the respective conditions for the syntheses of au20 , au24,and mixed au39 / 40 cluster size stage i stage ii amount of nabh4 ( concentration , 0.44 m ) per mole of gold and speed of addition aging time stirring speed at the stage of au ( iii ) reduction to au ( i ) by 3x hsc2h4ph stirring speed at the stage of au ( i ) reduction to clusters by nabh4 1 au20 stationary approximately 50 rpm 1 ml ( 1x ) , dropwise added over a 30 - min period approximately 6 hrs 2 au24 50 to 100 rpm approximately 100 rpm 1 ml ( 1x ) , dropwise added over a 15 - min period overnight 3 au39 / 40 50 to 100 rpm approximately 400 rpm 1 ml ( 1x ) , dropwise added over a 15 - min period overnight 4 au25 50 to 100 rpm 50 to 400 rpm 5 ml ( 5x ) , dropwise added over a 50 - min period overnight during stage ii ( the reduction of au ( i ) by nabh4 ) , the stirring speed is even critical for the selective formation of au20 , au24 , or au39 / 40 .
a slow stirring ( approximately 50 rpm ) during stage ii favors the formation of au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 , while a slightly higher speed of stirring ( approximately 100 rpm ) favored the formation of au24 ( sc2h4ph ) 20 , and with further increased speed to approximately 400 rpm , we obtained new clusters of au39 ( sc2h4ph ) 29 and au40 ( sc2h4ph ) 30 .
this controlled reaction process for tuning cluster size is quite interesting .
we believe that the aggregated au ( i ) sr species are broken into small fragments upon reduction or partial reduction by nabh4 .
different stirring speed for stage ii would influence the kinetics of the reduction reaction of au ( i ) sr , and the different stirring speeds also give rise to different sheering forces that would break polymeric au ( i ) sr into different sized fragments ; such different sized fragments seem to subsequently grow into different sized clusters based upon our results .
regarding the aggregated au ( i ) sc2h4ph species in the solution , structural characterization ( e.g. , by nmr or x - ray diffraction ) is still difficult to carry out as the au ( i ) intermediate species is poorly soluble in common solvents .
thermal gravimetric analysis determined the composition of au ( i ) : sr to be 1:1 , but the aggregation degree ( e.g. , how many repeat units in [ au ( i ) sc2h4ph ] x ) and what structures [ au ( i ) sc2h4ph ] x may adopt are all unknown yet .
possible structures of [ au ( i ) sc2h4ph ] x include linear chains , ring [ 53 - 57 ] , or lamellar structures .
the characterization of au ( i ) sr still need major efforts in future work .
dropwise addition speed of nabh4 and effect on cluster size in addition to the stirring speed during stage ii , the addition speed of nabh4 ( aqueous solution ) to reduce au ( i ) into clusters also plays an important role in controlling the final cluster size .
we have tested that , in the synthesis of au20 ( sc2h4ph ) 16 , if the initial drops of nabh4 solution ( 0.44 mol / l , 1 ml ) were added rapidly , the light yellow solution of au ( i ) aggregates would rapidly become brown or deep black , and the product would contain more au24 and au39 / 40 clusters , instead of the predominant au20 as the case of very slow addition of nabh4 ( over a period of approximately 30 min ) ( entry 1 , table 2 ) .
after optimization , we found that adding nabh4 ( 0.44 mol / l , 1 ml , same concentration and amount as the au20 synthesis ) over a period of approximately 15 min gave rise to predominant au24 ( under approximately 100 rpm stirring condition ) or au39 / 40 ( under approximately 400 rpm stirring condition ) ; see entries 2 and 3 of table 2 .
thus , controlled reduction of au ( i ) is very important for size selective formation of au20 , au24 , or au39 / 40 .
the selective formation of au39 / 40 over au24 - which differ only in the stirring speed during stage ii ( i.e. , 400 vs 100 rpm , table 2 ) - should be due to the different reaction kinetics in the reduction process of au ( i ) species into clusters .
in a recent synthetical work on gold / phosphine nanocluster synthesis , pettibone and hudgens identified a growth - etching cyclic process that occurs around the most stable cluster species to form monodisperse product [ 4,58,59 ] .
this size selective growth mechanism provides important information on the gold / phosphine system .
the reaction kinetics of the gold / thiol system , however , still needs significant input in order to unravel the details of the kinetic process .
mass spectrometric monitoring of the reaction intermediates would provide valuable information and should be pursued in future work .
degree of reduction of au ( i ) and effect on cluster size with respect to the growth of au20 , au24 , and au39 / 40 nanoclusters , an interesting question arises naturally : why the ubiquitous au25 nanocluster is not formed under these conditions ( entries 1 to 3 , table 2 ) .
the synthesis of au25 ( sc2h4ph ) 18 is typically done under experimental conditions of fast stirring and rapid reduction of au ( i ) with large excess of nabh4 ( approximately 10 equivalents ( eq ) of nabh4 per mole of gold ) .
an important difference lies in that the syntheses of au20 , au24 , and au39 / 40 clusters all involve 1 eq of nabh4 per gold , i.e. , 1 ml of nabh4 solution ( 0.44 mol / l ) , table 2 .
this implies that the degree of reduction of au ( i ) might affect the cluster size , and the formation of au25 clusters might necessitate over reduction of au ( i ) with a large excess of nabh4 .
to find out whether the reduction degree of au ( i ) species affect the final cluster size , we adopt the same stirring conditions as the synthesis of au24 and au39 / 40 ( see entry 4 , table 2 ) , but we add more nabh4 ( e.g. , 5 eq , rather than 1 eq for the synthesis of au24 and au39 / 40 ) .
the addition speed of nabh4 solution is kept comparable to the syntheses of au24 and au39 / 40 clusters .
interestingly , dropwise addition of 5 eq of nabh4 does result in selective formation of au25 , instead of au24 or au39 / 40 , evidenced by its characteristic spectroscopic features ( see figure s2 in additional file 1 ) .
thus , the growth of au25 nanoclusters does require a rich reductant ( nabh4 ) , as opposed to lean nabh4 for au20 , au24 , and au39 / 40 synthesis .
the fast stirring and rapid addition of nabh4 seem not the key to the synthesis of au25 nanoclusters .
conclusions this work has demonstrated the effectiveness of controlled reduction for synthesizing different sized gold nanoclusters .
specifically , slow stirring and slow addition of 1 eq nabh4 / mol of gold are critical to effect the preferential growth of the series of au20 , au24 , and au39 / 40 nanoclusters .
in addition to the reaction kinetics , controlling the degree of reduction also leads to different sized nanoclusters , as demonstrated in the selective formation of au25 over aun ( n = 20 , 24 , 39 / 40 ) .
future work is hoped to offer deeper mechanistic understanding of the au ( i ) formation and the au ( i ) reduction process by nabh4 .
mechanistic understanding of the cluster growth process will eventually permit high yielding synthesis of a full series of monodisperse gold nanoclusters .

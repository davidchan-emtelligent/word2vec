the presentation of table 1 along with the table legend and footnote was incorrect in the html and pdf versions of this article .
the corrected version is given below .
table 1 positively selected sites in octopus haemocyanin at which at least three or more selection tests identified significant positive selection .
analysis was performed for two separate alignments , containing 113 or 126 sequences respectively , and covering in total a 396 amino acid long region of the haemocyanin 's functional units f and g. numbering of positions refers to the published full haemocyanin sequence of enteroctopus dofleini [ uniprot : o61363 ] [ 23 , 24 ] .
significance thresholds were : p <= 0.10 for slac , <= 0.10 for fel , meme and prime ; posterior probability >= 0.90 for fubar ; bayes factor >= 0.50 for ef. see additional file 5 for detailed results residue slaca fela memea fubara efa primeb treesaapc phi pk ' palpha pct 2383 * * v ( 1 ) ^( 2 - 4 ) 2409 * * * * * 2410 * * * v ( 5 - 8 ) 2442 * ( cc ) v ( 10 ) ^( 5,9,11 ) 2469 * cc v ( 12,13 ) 2496 * * * * v ( 14,15 ) 2503 * * * * * ( p ) v ( 14,15,22 - 27 ) ^( 20 ) 2545 * * v ( 4 , 20 , 28 - 30 ) ^( 9,19,31,32 ) 2575 * * v ( 33,34 ) 2585 * * * * phi cc ( p ) ( v ) 2602 * * v ( 35,36 ) ^( 35,36 ) 2610 * * phi v ( 37 - 39 ) ^( 40,41 ) v ( 40 - 42 ) ^( 37 - 39 ) 2643 * cc v ( 38 ) abbreviations : cc chemical composition , p polarity , v volume , phi iso - electric point , pk ' equilibrium constant ( ionization of cooh ) , palpha alpha helical tendencies , pct power to be at the c - terminal asites at which slac , fel , meme , fubar or ef identified positive selection are indicated with asterisks bsites at which positive selection was inferred with prime .

magnitude of amino acid change was 8 for phi and pk ' and 6 for palpha and pct .
arrows indicate an increase ( v ) or decrease (^) of the amino acid property .

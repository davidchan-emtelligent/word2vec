abstract whilst adaptation and phenotypic plasticity might buffer species against habitat degradation associated with global climate change , few studies making such claims also possess the necessary and sufficient data to support them .
doing so requires demonstration of heritable variation in traits affecting fitness under new environmental conditions .
we address this issue using an emerging aquatic system to study adaptation to climate change , the crimson - spotted rainbowfish ( melanotaenia duboulayi ) , a freshwater species from a region of eastern australia projected to be affected by marked temperature increases .
captive born m. duboulayi of known pedigree were used to assess the long - term effects of contemporary and 2070 - projected summer temperatures on the expression of genes previously identified in a climate change transcriptomics ( rna - seq ) experiment .
nearly all genes responded to increasing temperature .
significant additive genetic variance explained a moderate proportion of transcriptional variation for all genes .
most genes also showed broad - sense genetic variation in transcriptional plasticity .
additionally , molecular pathways of candidate genes co - occur with genes inferred to be under climate - mediated selection in wild m. duboulayi populations .
together , these results indicate the presence of existing variation in important physiological traits , and the potential for adaptive responses to a changing thermal environment .

given pronounced intracontinental temperature increases ( diffenbaugh and field 2013 ) , and the influence of localized climatic effects on their thermal properties ( caissie 2006 ) , inland and coastal freshwaters may be especially vulnerable to temperature increases .
indeed , freshwater habitats and their biota are among the most threatened by environmental change ( dudgeon et al .
2006 ) , a concern highlighted in the most recent intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) report ( settele et al. 2014 ) .
all freshwater fishes are ectotherms , and thus , metabolically sensitive to environmental temperature .
how they are likely to respond to the challenges associated with global climate change is in many ways dependent upon the effects of new environmental inputs on essential physiological processes ( helmuth 2009 ; chown et al. 2010 ; hofmann and todgham 2010 ) .
within the context of population - level responses to global climate change , adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are often cited as potential means of species persistence .
yet , few studies present empirical data essential to understanding whether either of these represents viable mechanisms .
critically absent from the discussion are demonstrations of a genetic basis for traits likely to influence fitness in the changed environments ( gienapp et al .
2008 ; charmantier and gienapp 2014 ; merila and hendry 2014 ) .
moreover , despite a perceived ubiquity of biological adaptation in nature , evidence of the potential to genetically adapt to climate change is scarce and ambiguous ( bradshaw and holzapfel 2006 ; hoffmann and sgro 2011 ; merila and hendry 2014 ) .
this is particularly so in aquatic organisms from the southern hemisphere , which are largely under - represented in climate change research ( chambers et al. 2013 ) .
acclimatization - acclimation within the context of a controlled , laboratory setting - is a compensatory change in physiological processes in response to environmental change ( willmer et al. 2005 ) and represents a form of phenotypic plasticity .
transcriptional mechanisms appear to play a key role in acclimation to environmentally induced stressors across broad taxonomic groups ( lopez - maury et al .
2008 ) , and in the regulation of metabolism ( desvergne et al. 2006 ) .
for ectothermic species such as fishes , the latter is also highly relevant with respect to changes in the thermal environment .
in many fish species , acclimation can increase threshold temperatures for induction of the cellular stress response and upper thermal tolerance ( fangue et al. 2011 ; currie and schulte 2014 ) .
however , this may come at the cost of increased resting metabolic rate and related long - term fitness consequences ( portner et al. 2006 ; portner and knust 2007 ; munoz et al. 2012 ) .
conversely , interindividual variation in the thermal response may be reflective of genetic variability in the underlying physiological processes .
yet , whilst a genetic basis to functional biology is frequently assumed in the literature , estimates of heritability for variation in physiological processes are scarce , especially in fishes ( chown et al. 2010 ) .
this is particularly problematic with respect to forecasting the effects of climate change , as any adaptive response is dependent upon the degree of additive genetic variation underlying organisms' thermal physiology .
if we are to address these issues in a rigorous manner , we require ecologically relevant models that are also amenable to multigenerational experimentation .
rainbowfishes ( melanotaeniidae ) are a diverse ( ca. 81 species ) and monophyletic group endemic to australia and new guinea ( unmack et al. 2013 ) .
they inhabit a diverse range of freshwater habitats , being found almost everywhere that freshwater is present in australia ( allen 1989 ; mcguigan et al. 2000 ; unmack et al. 2013 ) .
despite their broad geographic distribution and abundance , they are nonmigratory , typically with small home ranges and strong microhabitat preferences ( hurwood and hughes 2001 ; hattori and warburton 2003 ) .
in addition , many rainbowfish taxa have radiated relatively recently ( mcguigan et al .
2000 ) , especially the lineages endemic to australia ( unmack et al. 2013 ) .
given their close evolutionary relationships , strong metapopulation structures and diverse habitat preferences , these fishes represent a powerful field model for the study of local adaptation .
most species also display key attributes of a valuable laboratory model .
they are small ( ca. 3 - 9 cm ) , sexually dimorphic , easy to maintain and breed in captivity ( they are very popular aquarium fishes ) , are highly fecund ( between 150 and 1600 eggs ) and have a short generation time , reproducing annually in the wild and at the age of 3 months in the laboratory ( pusey et al. 2001 ; holdway et al. 2008 ) .
the crimson - spotted rainbowfish ( melanotaenia duboulayi ) is an australian subtropical species found in vegetated streams over a relatively broad latitudinal range in coastal drainages east of the great dividing range ( ca. 31.4degreess to 21.4degreess ; allen 1989 ) .
temperatures along this distribution have been rising steadily , and high co2 emissions projections may produce temperature as high as 10degreesc warmer by 2070 in the worst affected waterbodies ( meehl et al. 2007 ; reisinger et al. 2014 ) .
contemporary mean summer temperatures ( ca. 21degreesc ) are below the preferred temperature ( 26degreesc ) for m. duboulayi tested in a thermal gradient ( king and warburton 2007 ) .
however , projected 2070 temperatures are expected to exceed the species preference and may approach levels near its critical thermal temperature ( patra et al. 2007 ; beheregaray , unpublished data ) .
additionally , wild - caught m. duboulayi exhibit substantial plastic regulatory responses to temperature stress .
in a short - term transcriptomics ( rna - seq ) experiment , smith et al .
( 2013 ) identified and annotated 614 upregulated and 349 downregulated genes in relation to predicted summer temperatures for 2070 .
these include a suite of heat - shock genes that responded sharply to increased temperatures , and genes related to regulation of metabolic functions and developmental processes that showed mid - range changes in expression ( smith et al. 2013 ) .
thus , the availability of excellent candidate genes for climatic adaptation , coupled with the species' life history attributes , makes m. duboulayi an ideal aquatic study system to assess molecular footprints of adaptive resilience to climate change .
in this study , we assess the adaptive potential to climate change of the subtropical australian rainbowfish m. duboulayi , focusing on a genetically healthy population that is centrally located along the climatically heterogeneous latitudinal range of the species .
specifically , we use the m. duboulayi system to examine the effects of long - term acclimation to increased temperature on the transcription of candidate genes which are differentially expressed in response to thermal stress , including a test for sex - specific differences in this response .
we hypothesize that there is a heritable basis underlying the variable transcriptional responses revealed during earlier experiments that used short - term exposure to temperature treatments mimicking contemporary and future climate .
critically , we employ a reciprocal common - garden design and incorporate information on the pedigree of experimental animals , to estimate both narrow - sense heritability of transcription and broad - sense genetic variation for its plasticity .
additionally , we test for functional associations with candidate genes inferred to be under temperature - mediated selection in the wild ( identified in a companion study ) as a preliminary exploration of the potential adaptive value of transcriptional variation .
materials and methods origin of broodstock , spawning & husbandry sixty adult m. duboulayi were collected using bait traps from a location in the upper reaches of the brisbane river near the township of fernvale ( 27degrees26'37.39 '' s , 152degrees40'12.76 '' e ) .
the brisbane river population was targeted because it is abundant compared with several m. duboulayi found in smaller rivers and is centrally located along the north - south range of the species in eastern australia .
in addition , a landscape genomic study of m. duboulayi based on over 17 000 snps screened in 22 populations from across the species range ( smith et al. unpublished ) indicates that brisbane river rainbowfish are part of a large representative group of populations locally adapted to climate - related variables ( hottest maximum and coldest minimum temperatures , run - off , quarterly rainfall and annual radiation ) .
fish were transported by air to the animal house and aquaculture facility at flinders university in adelaide and allowed to acclimate for 6 months .
during the acclimation period , fish were maintained in single sex tanks ( 12 fish / 100l ) at 21degreesc under conditions of 12 h light / 12 h dark .
they were fed once daily on a mixture of blood worms and fish pellets .
after 6 months , photoperiod was changed to a cycle of 14 h light / 10 h dark to induce breeding behaviour .
when fish began exhibiting nuptial coloration and gravidity , 11 mating groups of a single male and two females were selected at random and transferred to breeding tanks .
breeding tanks were 100l volume and contained ' spawning mops' as artificial substrate for egg deposition .
mops were removed daily in the morning and were transferred to corresponding rearing tanks .
breeding was conducted over a 4 - month period from june to october 2012 .
larvae were then reared in separate , 100 - l family - rearing tanks at 21degreesc under a photoperiod of 12 h light / 12 h dark and fed daily , initially with rotifers and later with blood worms and fish pellets .
pedigree reconstruction dna was extracted from all parents and offspring ( n = 199 ) using a modified salting - out procedure ( sunnucks and hales 1996 ) .
dna quality and quantity were measured with a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer .
all individuals were genotyped using microsatellite markers developed for m. australis ( ma03 , ma09 , ma10 & ma11 ; young et al. 2009 ) and m. splendida ( ms22 , ms24 & ms40 ; zhu et al. 1998 ) .
loci were amplified in 5 mul polymerase chain reactions ( pcrs ) using procedures and touch - down cycles following ( beheregaray and sunnucks 2000 ) .
microsatellite fragments were scored using genemapper 4.0 ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , and scoring error evaluated using micro - checker ( van oosterhout et al. 2004 ) .
as breeding tanks contained only a single male , offspring paternity was known ; maternity was inferred from resulting genotype of offspring and parents using colony ( version 2.0.5.8 ; jones and wang 2010 ) .
individuals were separated into full - sib groups and kept in separate tanks until thermal treatments began .
thermal treatment & tissue sampling at approximately 6 months of age , individuals from each family were assigned randomly , and in equal proportions , to one of two groups : a control representing current mean summer temperatures ( 21degreesc ) , and the projected mean 2070 summer temperature ( 31degreesc ) for the brisbane river region ( meehl et al. 2007 ; reisinger et al. 2014 ) .
it should be noted that this projected summer temperature is below the upper thermal critical maximum ( ctmax = 38degreesc ; sd = 0.39 ) of m. duboulayi ( beheregaray , unpublished data ) , empirically estimated for brisbane river rainbowfish following the method of becker and genoway ( 1979 ) .
individuals from each temperature group were also randomly assigned to one of 19 replicate tanks .
for the 31degreesc treatment , temperature was increased by 2degreesc per day until the experimental temperature was achieved .
tanks were monitored daily for signs of stress or disease associated with the higher temperature .
fish were then maintained for 80 days to approximate the typical duration of summer temperatures in the brisbane river region .
at the end of the treatment period , fish were sacrificed using aqui - s ( r ) solution and dissected to remove their livers for immediate rna extraction .
although increased temperature has been shown to differentially induce transcription changes in different tissue types , we selected liver due to previous research specifically linking this tissue type to heat stress responses ( smith et al. 2013 ) .
the final data set contained 108 individuals ( 60 females & 48 males ) , assigned in approximately equal proportions to control ( 21degreesc : 26 females ; 21 males ) and treatment ( 31degreesc : 34 females ; 27 males ) groups .
nineteen families were present , 16 of which were related as paternal half - sibs , spawned from 19 dams and 11 sires .
family size ranged from one to 16 individuals ( median = 5 ) .
all families comprised of six or fewer individuals had multiple , related individuals in a corresponding half - sib family ; the three families with no half - sib relations contained from six to 14 individuals .
rna extractions & qrt - pcr total rna was extracted from liver tissue using the ambion magmax ( tm ) - 96 total rna isolation kit ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) , following smith et al .
( 2013 ) .
rna quality and concentration were measured using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer , then diluted to a standardized concentration ( 10 ng / mul ) .
each dilution was checked for dna contamination by pcr amplification of a housekeeping gene using the sensifast sybr hi - rox kit ( bioline , london , uk ) , followed by electrophoresis on agarose gel .
samples exhibiting amplified dna were treated with dnase max kit ( mo bio ) for a second time .
finally , we used random primers and the high capacity cdna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems ) for cdna synthesis , following manufacturer 's protocols .
primers were designed to amplify twelve candidate genes that are putatively differentially expressed in response to thermal stress ( smith et al .
2013 ) - primer sequences and related information can be found in table s1 .
most importantly , candidate genes are believed to play a role in biological processes associated with a response to thermal challenge ( e.g. oxidation reduction , metabolism , regulation of transcription ; see table s2 ) .
candidates included homologues for the following zebrafish ( danio rerio ) genes : alanine : glyoxylate aminotransferase a ( agxta ) ; cytochrome p450 , family 1 , subfamily a ( cyp1a ) ; glutathione s - transferase rho ( gstr , a.k.a. zgc : 162356 ) ; 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl - coenzyme a synthase 1 ( hmgcs1 ) ; heat - shock protein 90 , alpha ( cytosolic ) , class a member 1 , tandem duplicate 2 ( hsp90aa1.2 ) ; nuclear receptor subfamily 1 , group d , member 4b ( nr1d4b ) ; nad ( p ) - dependent steroid , dehydrogenase - like ( nsdhl ) ; peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor alpha b ( pparab ) ; thyrotrophic embryonic factor a ( tefa ) ; thioredoxin - related transmembrane protein 2b ( tmx2b ) ; udp glucuronosyltransferase 2 family , polypeptide a4 ( ugt2a4 ) ; and ubiquinol - cytochrome c reductase core protein iib ( uqcrc2b ) .
reference genes , to control for differences in template quantity due to variation among extractions and / or dilutions , were identified from a previous study as nondifferentially expressed between treatments ( smith et al. 2013 ) and included ba1 globin ( ba1 , a.k.a. hbb ) and phosphoglycerate mutase 1a ( pgam1a ) .
quantitative pcr was performed in 96 - well plates on a steponeplus real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems ) , using a sybr green reporter .
reactions contained 1 mul of diluted cdna ( 10 ng / mul ) , 5 mul of 2x sensifast sybr hi - rox ( bioline ) , 0.05 mum of each forward and reverse primer and 3.8 mul of rnase - free water .
thermal cycles consisted of an initial denaturation step ( 95degreesc ; 2 min ) , and 40 cycles of denaturation ( 95degreesc ; 3 s ) , annealing ( 60degreesc ; 10 s ) and extension ( 72degreesc ; 10 s ) .
this was followed by a melt curve cycle of 95degreesc for 15 s , 60degreesc for 1 min and 95degreesc for 15 s. a single gene was amplified for a given 96 - well plate that also comprised : three negative controls ; a fourfold serial dilution of a positive control , also in triplicate ; three technical replicates for 30 experimental animals .
analyses for each gene , raw fluorescence values of all individuals , including all technical replicates and controls , were compiled into a single data file .
initial mrna quantities ( n 0 ) were estimated using a regression - based procedure implemented in linregpcr ( ramakers et al. 2003 ; ruijter et al. 2013 ) .
replicate n 0 values of each candidate gene were standardized relative to the geometric mean of n 0 values for all technical replicates of reference genes for a given individual ( vandesompele et al. 2002 ) .
standardized data were then screened for outliers : technical replicates greater than two standard deviations from their corresponding family - by - treatment mean were flagged and removed - on average , outlier removal resulted in the loss of a single data point ( i.e. individual ) per gene in the final data set ( range 0 - 3 ) .
following standardization and outlier removal , technical replicates were averaged by individual .
to evaluate effects of temperature and / or sex on candidate gene transcription , and to estimate additive genetic variance ( v a ) for transcription , we analysed data under a pedigree - weighted , mixed effects model ( i.e. the animal model ) implemented in the r package ' mcmcglmm ' ( hadfield 2010 ) .
in order to evaluate the significance of additive genetic variance for transcription , we ran two nested models : a minimal / null model including only random variation among rearing tanks , and a second model which also included ' animal ' variance ( v a ) ; both models included coefficients describing fixed effects of temperature treatment , sex and their interaction .
to ensure convergence and sufficient mixing , models were run for 25 000 000 iterations comprising an initial burn - in of 20 000 000 iterations and a sampling chain of 5 000 000 iterations .
to reduce autocorrelation of estimates , each 5000th point of the markov chain was sampled , yielding a total of 1000 posterior estimates of model parameters .
model ( i.e. v a ) significance was evaluated based on the deviance information criterion ( dic ) ; significance of fixed effects was determined by profiling the posterior distributions of estimated coefficients .
as mrna extraction necessitated lethal sampling , individuals could not be sampled in multiple environments , thereby precluding the possibility of estimating additive genetic variance for transcriptional plasticity .
however , to evaluate the potential for genetic variance in plasticity ( vg x e ) , we ran two additional nested models : a model including broad - sense genetic variance in mean transcription ( i.e. variation among families in the intercept coefficient ; vg ) , and a model including broad - sense ( i.e. among family ) variation in the temperature ( i.e. slope ) coefficient .
both models also included random variation among rearing tanks and were fully parameterized for all fixed effects .
models were run with a burn - in of 500 000 iterations , followed by an additional 500 000 iterations from which each 500th point was sampled .
significance of vg x e was determined by contrasting the dic score against both the vg and previous ' null ' models .
inferring functional / adaptive value as a tentative first inference into the potential adaptive value of variation in the candidate genes , we explored their functional relationships with a subset of genes previously identified as putatively under selection in a natural thermal gradient .
in a companion paper , smith et al .
( unpublished ) explored genomewide snp variation along the latitudinal range of m. duboulayi and observed 1141 loci putatively under climate - mediated selection , as identified via outlier analysis using bayescan ( foll and gaggiotti 2008 ) .
we first conducted a distant homology blast scan ( gap opening and extension penalties 5 and 2 ; match / mismatch scores of 2 and - 3 ; minimum percentage sequence identity 75 ) of the 93 - bp sequences of these outliers against the zebrafish genome ( grcz10 ; accessed july 28 , 2015 ) , reducing the data set to 411 annotated genes .
we then used the biomart package to retrieve identifiers ( e.g. entrez / ncbi accessions , official gene symbols ) for use in subsequent analyses ( durinck et al. 2005 ) .
we queried the kegg database to identify all known molecular pathways in zebrafish comprising a co - occurrence of at least one of the 12 candidate genes assayed for transcription and one of the annotated outlier genes ( kanehisa and goto 2000 ; kanehisa et al. 2014 ) .
additionally , we performed a functional enrichment analysis and clustering of the two gene lists based on biological process and molecular function ontologies using david ( huang et al. 2007 ; sherman et al. 2007 ) .
finally , we identified potential protein - protein interactions between members of each gene set by querying the string database ( v10 ; accessed august 3 , 2015 ; snel et al. 2000 ; szklarczyk et al. 2015 ) .
for each of the 12 candidate genes , we identified all known and predicted protein - protein interactions with the ' highest ' confidence score ( 0.900 ). from this list , we identified 23 from the 411 genes putatively under selection and plotted their interaction network with the 12 candidate genes .
results effects of temperature and sex on transcription with the exception of tmx2b ( table 1 ; fig. 1a ) , all candidate genes exhibited a significant response to increasing temperature .
nearly all genes were significantly upregulated at 31degreesc ( fig. 1b - j ) , with the exception of hsp90aa1.2 , for which female transcription was decreased ( fig. 1k ) , and nr1d4b , which was generally downregulated in response to increasing temperature ( fig. 1l ) .
five genes were also differentially expressed between sexes : agxta ( fig. 1f ) , gstr ( fig. 1g ) and ugt2a4 ( fig. 1i ) were significantly higher in males than in female ; in contrast , transcription of tmx2b ( fig. 1a ) and tefa ( fig. 1h ) was significantly greater in females than in males .
significant interaction effects also revealed environment dependent sex differences .
transcription of cyp1a was significantly higher in males at 21degreesc ; however , this pattern was reversed at 31degreesc , where female levels were higher ( table 1 ; fig. 1j ) .
for hsp90aa1.2 and nr1d4b , sex differences were observed only at 21degreesc ( table 1 ) , with significantly greater levels of transcription for females ( fig. 1k ) and males ( fig. 1l ) , respectively .

for genes with a significant sex - by - treatment interaction , results of reduced models contrasting sexes within each temperature and describing sex - specific temperature effects are also presented .

v g x e was deemed nonsignificant for only agxta and tmx2b ( fig. s2 ) and was questionable for hsp90aa1.2 given the relatively minor difference in dic scores among models - point estimates of random slope variance ( v betatreat | fam ) for these genes were also substantially lower than those of v resid ( table s3 ). of the genes with putatively significant v g x e , family - specific reaction norms were largely in the same direction : none exhibited a crossing pattern indicative of both up - and downregulation in response to temperature ( fig. s1 ) .
although based strictly on mean estimates hmgcs1 showed a trend in this direction for three families ( fig. 1b ) , 95 % pdis clearly overlapped , indicating no significant plasticity in transcription associated with temperature ( i.e. slope estimates not exclusive of zero , fig. s1e ) .
this was the pattern observed for the majority of genes : one to few families exhibited no effect of thermal treatment , whereas others significantly altered transcription in response to the temperature increase .
in three genes ( cyp1a , gstr & uqcrc2b ) , all families exhibited significant upregulation in response to increased temperature , although the magnitude of this effect differed .
functional annotations we identified ten molecular pathways in which candidate genes ( 6 of 12 ) were found to co - occur with genes putatively under selection ( table 3 ) in the natural temperature gradient of smith et al .

the hsp90aa1.2 subnetwork contained the most informative functional annotations ( fig. s3 ) , with the majority of catalysis links implicated in the deacetylation of heat - shock factor 1 ( hsf1 ) by sirtuin 1 ( sirt1 ) , and biochemical reactions associated with hsf1 acetylation - in fig. s3 , these links are found mediated via the other heat - shock proteins and cognates ( e.g. hsc70 ) .
the remaining catalysis reaction of this subnetwork , mediated via dynactin 1a ( dctn1a ) , mapped to the phosphorylation of polo - like kinase 1 ( plk1 ) by aurora kinase a ( aurka ) .

discussion clarifying the roles of phenotypic plasticity ( environmentally induced response ) and microevolution ( genetic response ) in scenarios of environmental change is a major research priority ( hoffmann and willi 2008 ; merila and hendry 2014 ) .
whilst under certain conditions plasticity can be adaptive ( gotthard and nylin 1995 ; ghalambor et al .
2007 ) , genetic responses are generally a requisite for long - term persistence to predicted climate changes ( bradshaw and holzapfel 2006 ) .
moreover , the potential for an evolved response requires demonstration of heritable variation in traits affecting individual performance under new environmental conditions ( gienapp et al. 2008 ; charmantier and gienapp 2014 ) .
we can draw two conclusions from our long - term common - garden experiment of functional responses to predicted climate change with the australian rainbowfish m. duboulayi .
the first is that increases in seasonal austral summer temperature projected under a high emissions scenario are likely to have a significant effect on the transcriptional profiles of this subtropical rainbowfish .
the second is that even in the face of significant temperature effects , there is a variation in both transcription and the transcriptional response to increased temperatures .
most importantly , this variation has an underlying genetic basis and , as such , might allow for an evolved response .
additive genetic variance and adaptive potential perhaps more important than confirmation of the transcriptional effects of projected temperature increases , this study adds to the growing body of evidence that transcriptional variance has an underlying heritable basis .
much of the previous work in the field has been dominated by studies designed to identify quantitative trait loci responsible for transcriptional variation ( eqtl , gibson and weir 2005 ; skelly et al. 2009 ) .
whilst this line of enquiry has provided many valuable insights into the regulatory nature of gene expression , classical pedigree - based analyses of variance components may provide more reliable estimates of the fraction of transcriptional variance due to additive genetic effects ( discussed in leder et al. 2015 ) .
thus , not only is this a highly cost - effective approach to understanding the genetics of transcriptional variance , but also it has the potential to yield more accurate estimates of the parameters required to predict a response to changing selection pressures .
yet to date surprisingly few studies investigating the transcriptional effects of changing environmental stressors have taken such a pedigree - based approach ( though see cote et al. 2007 ; roberge et al. 2007 ; debes et al. 2012 ) .
although this study does provide requisite proof of genetic variation , at present we do not know how transcriptional variance in these candidate genes might affect fitness .
in fact , the general importance of transcriptional variance as a contributor to fitness remains a point of contention ( feder and walser 2005 ; evans 2015 ) .
given the difficulty of quantifying fitness , it is perhaps unsurprising that few studies have attempted to integrate fitness metrics into the analysis of transcriptional variation in wild vertebrate models ( but see mccairns and bernatchez 2010 ) .
nevertheless , we may infer that some contributions to fitness must be conferred given the signatures of selection observed in transcriptional variation in natural populations .
for example , stickleback populations inhabiting a broad latitudinal gradient in northern europe show signatures of directional selection in nearly 16 % of all transcripts , with many enriched for functional groups associated with temperature stress ( leder et al. 2015 ) .
likewise , 22 % of transcripts assayed in killifish adapted to a steep temperature gradient along the coast of eastern north america also show evidence of selection ( whitehead and crawford 2006 ) .
these studies demonstrate that transcriptional variation can clearly respond to selection and aid in the adaptation to divergent thermal environments .
however , establishing a direct link to fitness remains an important next step if we are to understand its role in m. duboulayi 's adaptive potential in a changing thermal environment .
inference from predicted functional associations although function alone does not imply fitness , it does contribute to whole organism performance , and so may help to inform our understanding of the targets of selection ( dalziel et al. 2009 ) .
many of the candidate genes are known to be directly involved in pathways associated with oxidative stress ( e.g. gstr ; hermes - lima and zenteno - savin 2002 ) and the regulation of metabolism ( e.g. nr1d4b ; desvergne et al .
2006 ) , both physiological processes likely to be affected by a warming thermal environment. and whilst new analyses suggest that mrna levels might be a far better predictor of protein abundance than previously believed ( li and biggin 2015 ) , increased protein production is not necessarily equivalent to increased functional activity ( feder and walser 2005 ) .
however , in evolved / steady - state comparisons , transcriptional variation can correspond remarkably well to differences in enzyme activity ( nikinmaa et al. 2013 ) .
given the extensive acclimation period of this study , we are likely safe to assume that current transcriptional data are reflective of steady - state levels typical of summer conditions , both current and projected .
as such , it is plausible that a degree of functional significance is captured in these data and that the most likely candidates in the physiologically mediated function / fitness nexus should be found at the functional intersection with genes under selection in the wild .
a role for plasticity ?
all genes exhibited significant heritability for transcription .
although the proportion of total phenotypic variance explained by additive genetic effects was moderate ( table 2 ) , estimates are similar to that observed in various taxa ( reviewed in leder et al. 2015 ). whether these are too low to effectively respond to selection exerted by increasing temperature remains an open question .
for example , in uk populations of the great tit ( parus major ) , heritability for breeding time is similarly modest ( h 2 = 0.16 ) , and insufficient to account for shifts which appear to track environmentally induced changes in an important prey item 's phenology ( charmantier et al. 2008 ) .
in this example , plasticity in breeding time appears to have facilitated the shift .
given the labile nature of transcription , this raises the possibility of plasticity also facilitating a shift towards new optima beyond the limits of existing genetic variation .
plasticity in the form of acclimation seems an unlikely long - term strategy .
indeed , species with an evolutionary history in highly variable thermal environments ( i.e. those frequently adjusting / acclimating to changing conditions ) may currently exist within their tolerance limits for physiological stress ( tomanek 2010 ) , and so may have limited plastic acclimation potential beyond this to meet additional physiological challenges imposed by climate change .
the view with respect to transcriptional plasticity is also ambiguous .
for example , a comparison of acute versus chronic ( 3 weeks ) thermal stress in the bald notothen ( pagothenia borchgrevinki ) revealed that mrna levels of genes associated with ros scavenging were increased in acute exposure but did not differ between control and chronic exposure ; most critically , chronically exposed fish showed significantly higher levels of oxidative damage ( almroth et al. 2015 ) .
it should be noted , however , that this observation comes from a highly stenothermal species , a group which may lack a typical heat - shock response ( tomanek 2010 ) .
in contrast , brown trout ( salmo trutta ) sampled from different thermal environments exhibit patterns of g x e for transcription suggestive of either a role for plasticity during adaptation to different temperatures , or the evolution of plasticity within them ( meier et al. 2014 ) .
one possible caveat to the role of transcriptional plasticity in adaptation , however , may be seen in the yeast model .
although studied in the context of nutritional environmental quality and not temperature , significant g x e for transcription was largely restricted to genes unlikely to have unique essential functions , for example paralogous genes ( landry et al. 2006 ) .
if this observation also holds true for other taxa , this might limit the number and / or types of genes with adequate heritable plasticity .
one likely candidate , however , remains the ppar pathway .
transcriptional regulation via ppars ( e.g. pparab ) may play a role in acclimation to both temperature and nutritional stress ( seebacher et al. 2010 ) .
in freshwater sticklebacks , plasticity in the transcription of pparaa ( a pparab paralogue ) is thought to have played a role in the colonization of a broader range of thermal environments than experienced by the ancestral population ( morris et al. 2014 ) .
in all cases , for plasticity to play a meaningful role in adaptation to a changing environment , it must move the phenotype towards the new fitness peak and it should be heritable ( gotthard and nylin 1995 ; ghalambor et al. 2007 ) .
in subtropical rainbowfish , differences in temperature reaction norms indicate considerable variation in the potential response to increasing temperature ( fig. s1 ) .
likewise , the relatively wide - ranging posterior density intervals for certain families can be interpreted as a proxy for plasticity in the classical sense ( i.e. the ability of a given genotype to produce a range of phenotypes in different environments ) .
moreover , we suggest that significant variation among families in the slope coefficient for nine of the twelve candidate genes is representative of broad - sense heritability for plasticity .
as such , if plasticity itself becomes an important determinant of fitness , there may be sufficient genetic variation upon which selection might act .
given that increased temperature variations are also a feature of most projections for the region ( reisinger et al .
2014 ) , such potential for adaptive plasticity may play an important role in the persistence of m. duboulayi along the east coast of australia .
acclimation time influences transcription pattern for many candidate genes , the transcriptional response to a season - length duration of increased temperature showed patterns similar to those exhibited following short - term ( i.e. 14d ) exposure ( smith et al. 2013 ) .
three in particular ( hmgcs1 , nr1d4b & nsdhl ) were not only consistent between studies of m. duboulayi , but also with respect to observations in threespine stickleback ( gasterosteus aculeatus ) subjected to an acute temperature stress ( leder et al. 2015 ). that the range of fold - change values observed among these studies was also remarkably similar would suggest that these genes may play a general role in the thermal stress response and / or thermal acclimation in teleost fishes - indeed increased liver transcription of hmgcs1 has also been reported in zebrafish ( danio rerio ) exhibiting metabolic and oxidative stress ( hugo et al. 2012 ; zhang et al. 2012 ; tsedensodnom et al .
2013 ) , both conditions associated with thermal stress .
similarly , two other candidate genes ( gstr & uqcrc2b ) were consistently upregulated in this and the previous study of m. duboulayi .
however , seven of the twelve genes studied exhibited patterns of transcription opposite of that inferred by transfrag quantitation of rna - seq data .
given the preponderance of transcription differences between sexes , and the fact that only males were assayed in the previous rna - seq study , sex - specific patterns are one potential explanation for observed discrepancies .
however , only tmx2b and hsp90aa1.2 show sufficient variability ( i.e. overlapping posterior density intervals ; fig. 1a and k ) from which biased sampling might potentially suggest increased transcription in response to temperature , as observed previously .
moreover , although males show a trend towards increased hsp90aa1.2 transcription , this is neither significant ( table 1 ) nor within an order of magnitude of the degree of fold change previously reported ( ca. 140x ) .
conversely , threespine sticklebacks have been shown to exhibit a ca .
10 - fold increase of hsp90aa1.2 in liver tissue immediately following a temperature increase ( leder et al. 2015 ) .
likewise , killifish ( austrofundulus limnaeus ) show levels of hsp90alpha induction that appear to increase over the first 24 h of thermal treatment , but maintain a relatively constant level of upregulation over a 14 - d period ( podrabsky and somero 2004 ) .
the common element between these experiments and previous observations in m. duboulayi is the relatively short duration of exposure , likely occurring within a window of physiological stress / disruption of homeostasis .
in contrast , current observations were made on fish likely acclimated to the increased temperature .
acclimation time is known to affect the expression of a suite of physiological traits ( schulte et al .
2011 ; healy and schulte 2012 ) , and molecular responses to thermal challenge are no exception. with respect to mrna transcription , expression is dependent not only upon acclimation time , but also the degree of thermal change experienced ( currie and schulte 2014 ) .
whilst the common , immediate response to increased temperature involves initiation of a stress response , there appears to be considerable variability in the length of time required for homeostasis to be re - established .
for many temperate - zone fishes , including both stenothermal and eurythermal species , transcriptome - wide patterns of expression have been observed at steady state within a 4 - week acclimation period ( vornanen et al. 2005 ; logan and somero 2010 ) .
in contrast , transcriptional patterns consistent with those of acute thermal stress persist in zebrafish following 4 weeks of exposure to elevated temperatures ( vergauwen et al. 2010 ) .
little is known about the duration and / or periodicity of the molecular response to thermal stress in m. duboulayi specifically ; as such , we can only assume that transcript levels following 80 days of acclimation to experimental temperatures are at steady state .
irrespective , given the choice of experimental temperatures , these observations are likely to capture some elements of the transcriptional mechanisms underlying acclimatization to future summer seasons .
it should also be noted that previous observations were made on wild - caught fish .
although acclimated to control temperature for 1 month prior to experimentation , it is unknown to what extent experimental individuals may have experienced different temperatures when inhabiting a naturally heterogeneous thermal environment .
temperature variation during embryonic development can have a significant impact on thermal acclimation potential and the transcriptomic response of adult fish to thermal stress ( schaefer and ryan 2006 ; scott and johnston 2012 ) .
thus , discrepancies could merely reflect differences between fish reared under fluctuating versus constant temperatures during a critical developmental stage .
whilst this may open reasonable debate regarding the extent to which observations on model animals reared under artificially homogeneous conditions can be extrapolated to wild populations , we would re - iterate that this is outweighed by a significant advantage : the ability to disentangle environmental and genetic sources of variation .
in conclusion , this study provides a tangible example that can be added to the debate surrounding adaptive evolution in response to climate change .
evidence of heritability in candidate gene expression , in addition to broad - sense genetic variation in transcriptional plasticity , speaks to the potential for an adaptive response to future increases in environmental temperature .
additionally , molecular pathways of candidate genes were found to co - occur with genes putatively under climate - mediated selection in wild m. duboulayi populations .
such findings are essential to meaningful discussions of adaptive change , but are sorely lacking in many studies of climate change adaptation .
although establishing a direct link between transcriptional variation and fitness remains essential if we are to understand its role in m. duboulayi 's adaptive potential in a changing thermal environment , our study represents important first steps towards that end .

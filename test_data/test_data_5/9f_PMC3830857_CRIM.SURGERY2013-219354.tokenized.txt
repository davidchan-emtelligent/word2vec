gossypiboma , an infrequent surgical complication , is a mass lesion due to a retained surgical sponge surrounded by foreign body reaction .
in this case report , we describe gossypiboma in the abdominal cavity which was detected 14 months after the hysterectomy due to acute abdominal pain .
gossypiboma was diagnosed by computed tomography ( ct ) .
the ct findings were a rounded mass with a dense central part and an enhancing wall .
in explorative laparotomy , small bowel loops were seen to be perforated due to inflammation of long standing gossypiboma .
jejunal resection with end - to - end anastomosis was performed .
the patient was discharged whithout complication .
this case was presented to point to retained foreign body ( rfb ) complications and we believed that the possibility of a retained foreign body should be considered in the differential diagnosis of who had previous surgery and complained of pain , infection , or palpable mass .
1. introduction retained foreign body ( rfb ) has been reported after abdominal , thoracic , cardiovascular , orthopedic , and neurosurgical procedures [ 1 ] .
rfb is a rare condition for both patient and surgeon that can lead to very serious consequences after abdominal surgery .
gossypiboma can cause serious complications such as intra - abdominal abscess in the early stages .
but it might remain asymptomatic for many years .
some imaging modalities including plain radiography , ultrasonography ( usg ) , computed tomography ( ct ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) may help to have exact diagnosis [ 2 ] .
surgery is the recommended treatment option in these cases .
gossypiboma , in patients with a diagnosis of intra - abdominal mass and had previous history of surgery , should be considered in the differential diagnosis , even if it is a rare condition .
the appropriate surgical intervention should be planned as soon as possible due to legal and medical problems .
the present case had emergency hysterectomy 14 months ago and suffered from mild intermittent abdominal pain only since to present acute abdominal syndrome and was admitted to hospital .
the aim of present case was to draw attention to the complication of rfb .
2. case presentation a 38 - year - old woman with 27.3 bmi needed an emergency caesarean section in the fourth delivery 14 months ago in public hospital .
after caesarean section , the surgeons had to perform hysterectomy due to continued bleeding .
medical record revealed no postoperative complication and the patient was discharged after one week from the hospital .
in the follow up , the patient suffered sometimes from mild intermittent abdominal pain only .
however , the surgeons did not perform advanced examinations and the problem was explained with postoperative adhesions .
the patient was satisfied with surgeons' statements and did not continue the followup .
but , after 13 months of operation , mild intermittent abdominal pain was converted to mild abdominal colic and the patient felt discomfort .
hence , last week before admittance to hospital , intermittent fever , which reached up to 39degreesc , and severe abdominal colic emerged .
the patient was admitted to emergency department with above mentioned symptoms .
physical and laboratory examinations showed that the blood pressure was 100 / 80 mmhg , pulse was 110 / min , body temperature was 38.5degreesc , wbc was 6.3 x 103 / microl , and crp was 241 mg / l. abdominal usg shows a mass in pelvic area , but the source is not certain .
ct demonstrated that a mass ( 15 x 13 cm ) with a dense central part and an enhancing wall ( gossypiboma ) was located in the pelvic area ( figure 1 ) .
the patient underwent emergency surgery and exploratory laparotomy shows that an encapsulated abdominal compression is surrounded by omentum ( figures 2 and 3 ) .
retained abdominal sponge caused perforation of jejunum at the 50 cm below the ligament of treitz and was surrounded by intestinal content , which caused regional contamination ( figure 4 ) .
after removal of abdominal sponge , adhesiolysis and segmental small bowel resection with end - to - end anastomosis were performed .
the abdominal cavity was irrigated with 8 - 10 l saline and three abdominal drains were inserted .
bowel sound was begun and serous drainage content decreased to 50 ml in postoperative day ( pod ) 2 .
the patient tolerated the solid diet at pod 3 .
drains were taken at pod 5 and crp decreased up to 15 .
the patient was discharged at pod 7 due to patient feeling good enough .
the patient was still well in one - week and one - month followup .
3. discussion the reported incidence of retained surgical sponge is one per 1,000 - 15,000 abdominal operations [ 3 ] .
incidence of gossypiboma is low in developed countries due to the advanced operation room conditions and radiological techniques .
a surgical sponge can be retained after any surgery but most commonly after hysterectomy , appendectomy , and cholecystectomy .
persistent wound infection , unexplained pain , and fever in the postoperative period should lead one to suspect a retained foreign body .
this condition is often underestimated , because case numbers are calculated only on the basis of malpractice claims .
reason of nonreporting of occurrences is the fear of medicolegal repercussions [ 4 ] .
patients are often asymptomatic and not detected for a long time .
in fact , many cases were discovered to have a retained surgical sponge more than 30 years after the initial surgery [ 5 ] .
some of patients present with abdominal mass or subacute intestinal obstruction .
they may rarely result in fistula , perforation , or even extrusion per anus .
in our case , the patient had also a gynecological operation 14 months ago and she had intermittent abdominal pain only .
the main signs and symptoms are pain / irritation ( 42 %) , palpable mass ( 27 %) , and fever ( 12 %) [ 2 ] .
the retained surgical sponge triggers two biological responses named as aseptic fibrinous responses due to foreign body granuloma or exudative reaction leading to abscess formation [ 6 ] .
the most common detection methods were computed tomography ( 61 %) , plain radiography ( 35 %) , and ultrasound ( 34 %) .
so , the first diagnostic modality to rule it out should be a computed tomography scan .
mri features can be confusing because the radio - opaque marker is not magnetic or paramagnetic [ 7 ] .
intense acoustic collection in operation area or the mass can be shown by usg .
if sponge contains radio - opaque marker , it can be seen in direct x - ray .
the universal guideline which was stated by the american college of surgeons in october 2005 strictly recommended that radio - opaque sponges should only be used , and accurate sponge counts should be performed before the procedure , and before and after closure of the abdomen .
migration of retained sponge into bowel is rare but does occur when compared to abscess formation and occur as a result of inflammation of the intestinal wall that evolves to necrosis [ 8 ] .
in our case , a large surgical sponge caused intestinal perforation 14 months after surgery .
operation under emergency conditions , involvement of more than the surgical team in the operation , change in assistant staff during operation , increased bmi , volume loss , number of surgeons , and female gender are all risk factors for rfb [ 3 ] .
irrespective of the rarity of reports , operating teams should take care to count swabs used in all procedures .
surgeons should develop a habit of performing a brief but thorough routine postoperative wound and cavity exploration prior to wound closure [ 4 ] .
treatment of gossypiboma is the surgical removal usually through the previous operative site , but endoscopic or laparoscopic approaches may be attempted [ 9 ] .
as a result , gossypiboma is usually asymptomatic , has nonspecific radiological findings , and is a rare condition .
these situations might delay the diagnosis .
also , a gossypiboma can cause complications such as perforation and adhesion to the adjacent structures .
in order to avoid gossypiboma , the surgeons should comply with recommended statement on the prevention of retained foreign bodies after surgery .
atypical abdominal pain should be kept in mind since the gossypiboma even out of operation for a long time can be passed .
conflict of interests the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper .

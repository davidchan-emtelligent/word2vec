the applicability of acoustic emission ( ae ) techniques to monitor the mechanism of evolution of polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) fiber concrete damage under temperature fatigue loading is investigated .
using the temperature fatigue test , real - time ae monitoring data of pva fiber concrete is achieved .
based on the ae signal characteristics of the whole test process and comparison of ae signals of pva fiber concretes with different fiber contents , the damage evolution process of pva fiber concrete is analyzed .
finally , a qualitative evaluation of the damage degree is obtained using the kurtosis index and b - value of ae characteristic parameters .
the results obtained using both methods are discussed .
pva fiber - reinforced concrete temperature fatigue acoustic emission damage assessment health monitoring 1 .
introduction the application of fiber - reinforced concrete in various structures is increasing .
fiber can improve the tensile strength of concrete , its resistance to deformation , durability , dynamic effects , and so on [ 1 ] .
the crack resistance and toughness of fiber are better than those of plain concrete because an increase in fiber content enhances fiber resistance and delays cracking of the material .
the winter season in north china , the alternation of the four seasons , the day and night temperature differences , among other factors , expose concrete structures during their service life to temperature freeze - thaw conditions , which cause temperature fatigue damage .
polyvinyl alcohol ( pva ) fiber is an environmentally friendly , reinforced cement material ideal for use in northern china because of its good dispersion characteristics , ease of use in construction , good affinity with cement , alkali resistance , and resistance to the effects of climate and weather conditions .
pva can improve the antifreeze and anti - fatigue properties of concrete .
thus , the durability and frost resistance of concrete materials can be improved when mixed with pva fiber .
acoustic emission ( ae ) , a real - time monitoring technology , has many applications in material damage identification [ 2 ] .
the ae technique is used for monitoring the evolution of damage in substandard concrete materials [ 3,4 ] and to monitor matrix cracking and failure of different interfaces , especially in fiber concrete [ 5,6 ] .
previous studies showed that the ae technique can detect and possibly identify damage mechanisms in fiber - reinforced concrete by analyzing ae parameters .
among the parameters , ae energy , amplitude , and duration are usually used to examine the damage process zone [ 7 - 9 ] .
sometimes , however , the commonly examined ae parameters alone cannot correctly explain the mechanism of material failure .
several ae waveforms and spectral parameters were investigated to harness the full potential of the ae technique in studying the deformation of materials under stress [ 10 ] .
however , both direct ae parameters and waveform only qualitatively describe the damage process .
quantitative methods attempt to describe the nature of a source , for example , using moment tensor inversion techniques [ 11 - 13 ] .
however , quantitative methods cannot be easily applied in large structures , so qualitative methods are mostly used in the evaluation of material damage .
based on ae characteristic parameters , some indirect combination parameters are proposed to quantify the damage level of rc structures .
common ae qualitative methods include the b - value ' , felicity ratio , historical index versus severity index , relaxation ratio , kurtosis index , and ra value [ 14 - 19 ] .
in rc structures , the b - value theory and felicity ratio are the most basic methods of analysis .
the b - value is defined as the log - linear slope of the frequency - magnitude distribution of acoustic emissions , and shows good agreement with the process of fracture development in concrete .
the felicity ratio that has been developed into a standard can be used to determine if major structural defects are present in the material .
in this study , the damage of temperature fatigue load to pva fiber concrete specimens is monitored using ae technology .
the influence of different pva fiber contents in the freezing - thawing resistance durability of concrete material is also investigated .
the damage evolution process of specimens is studied using the correlation analysis method for ae parameters .
2. experiments 2.1 .
test specimens according to " standard test methods of long term performance and durability of ordinary concrete ( gb / t 50082 - 2009 )" , the specimen had a length of 400 mm and a cross - section of 100 mm x 100 mm. the mixture ratio is presented in table 1 and the pva fiber characteristics are shown in table 2 .
the experiment utilized high - quality fine aggregate sand with a fineness modulus of 2.13 and 1.5 % silt content .
the ii district - level was qualified .
standard curing lasted for 28 days .
the three - point bending experiments for the determination of the specimen toughness were performed .
the testing results were listed in table 3 .
the results were shown that the increase of fiber content improved the material 's ultimate load and toughness .
2.2 .
temperature fatigue test the temperature fatigue test protocol was also referred to the standard for gb / t 50082 - 2009 in china .
before temperature fatigue testing , the specimens from each mixture ratio group were taken and soaked in water for 4 days .
subsequently , the soaked specimen were put into the rapid freeze - thaw testing machine to simulate hot and wet testing cases for the temperature fatigue test .
humidity was above 90 % in the control group when the environment was more than 25 degreesc .
the temperature ranged from 50 degreesc to - 30 degreesc , changing by 10 degreesc for every step .
heating or cooling at 10 degreesc lasted 10 min .
thus , temperature was kept constant for 10 min for 320 min a cycle for 50 cycles , as shown in figure 1 .
2.3 .
ae acquisition system ae signals were collected by an ae acquisition system from the american physical acoustics corporation .
the sensor type is r15 - alpha .
its resonant frequency is 150 khz .
acquisition system parameters are as follows : the pre - amplifier gain for 20 db , the main amplifier for 30 db , threshold for 46 db and sample rate for 5 mhz .
one ae sensor was installed in the concrete specimen to assess the integrality of the structure .
the ae sensor was fixed using tape .
schematic diagram of ae sensor arrangement is in figures 2 and 3 .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
pva fiber concrete temperature fatigue damage ae characteristic parameters the ae characteristic parameters of pva fiber concrete specimen temperature fatigue damage are shown in figures 4 - 7 .
in contrast to the ae signal figure , all specimen ae signals slowly increase .
according to figure 4 , the ae signal energy of the different specimens is reduced with the increase of fiber contents .
this is reasonable because the deformation resistance capacity for high fiber content material is better than with low content fiber .
this can effectively prevent inner crack formation in the specimens under temperature fatigue load .
moreover , based on the relationship of ae amplitude vs. duration ( figures 5 - 7 ) , the ae signal varies with different pva fiber concrete contents .
for the specimen with fiber content of 1.5 kg / m3 , ae amplitude is lower than 75 db , and the duration of the signal is less than 1,000 mus .
the pva fiber exhibits a strong contribution in resisting crack propagation .
thus the specimen damage is small .
for the specimen with fiber content of 1.0 kg / m3 , ae amplitude is lower than 85 db , and the duration is less than 1,600 mus .
however , some high - amplitude and long - duration ae signals are observed when the ae amplitude reaches 100 db. the reason is because the decreased fiber content leads to the crack propagation resistance ability becoming weaker .
accordingly , when the fiber content is reduced to 0.5 kg / m3 , the distribution of ae amplitude vs. duration is more scattered .
thus , ae amplitude is higher and duration is longer .
lower pva fiber content in the concrete specimen also reduces the antifreeze ability .
many cracks appear on the specimen , the damage condition is more complex , and damage is more pronounced .
ae amplitude statistical distributions for different volumetric pva fiber content concrete were listed in figure 8 .
among the three different fiber content concretes , the 0.5 kg / m3 fiber content specimens' ae activity number was maximum .
the high amplitude ae events were increasing with decreasing fiber contents .
this is reasonable because each fiber pull - out event is a potential ae hit and the pull - out events increase with the fiber volume content [ 5 ] .
the testing results verified that the high pva fiber contents concrete could improve the concrete antifreeze ability and concrete damage degree was reduced .
3.2 .
pva fiber concrete temperature fatigue damage evolution describes based on ae amplitude over time the ae signal amplitude of different fatigue load phases is shown in figure 9 .
in figure 9 ( a - c ) , less ae signal is observed for the specimen with 1.5 kg / m3 fiber content during the whole cycle .
the amplitude is low and rarely any ae signal exists in temperature increase stage .
the specimens show little damage .
in figure 9 ( d - f ) , more ae signal is noted for the specimen with 1.0 kg / m3 fiber content during the whole cycle .
amplitude is also higher .
when the temperature goes down to 0 degreesc , the amplitude reaches the maximum value , and the specimen damage is bigger , but the damage process is still weak .
in figure 9 ( g - i ) , abundant ae signal and high amplitude are observed for the specimen with 0.5 kg / m3 fiber content in the first several cycles .
as the fatigue test is performed , the ae signal increases with reduction in fiber content of the specimen .
when the temperature is below 0 degreesc , a large ae signal occurs .
large , high - amplitude signals show more serious damage in the specimen , especially in the final several cycles where the specimen antifreeze ability is significantly reduced .
the antifreeze property of the material with the lowest fiber content is substantially reduced because it contains free water .
when the temperature is below freezing point , internal temperature stress in the material is caused by its volume expansion , and repeated freeze - thaw causes serious damage to the specimen .
moreover , pva fiber acts as an air - entraining agent .
when concrete is reinforced with pva fiber , the internal air content increases and gas porosity increases , which can delay the initiation and propagation of the micro cracks in the matrix material .
when the temperature continues to decrease below the freezing point , free water becomes ice and cracks begins to form and expand by frozen - heave stress in the material .
pva fibers bear more and more of the frozen - heave stress with micro crack formation and extension , and reduce matrix micro cracks of concrete and resist the matrix material damage .
when the rising temperature , the frozen - heave stress decreases gradually and material damage will not increase further , as shown in figure 9 ( a - i ) .
when the fiber content is small and the fiber tensile ability is reduced by repeated frozen - heave stresses , fiber fatigue damage occurs and this gradually leads to broken wire damage. with broken wire damage , the cement matrix damage and degradation rate increase , as shown in figure 9 ( g - i ) .
therefore , pva fiber - reinforced concrete material can show improved frost resistance ability , and a fiber content of 1.5 kg / m3 in the materials exhibits the best frost resistance .
4. damage evaluation for pva fiber concrete based on the ae data 4.1 .
evaluation pva fiber concrete damage evolution by kurtosis index the instantaneous index is often adopted to evaluate possible defects in rotating machinery and machinery service ability in vibration analysis .
kurtosis index is a measure of the impulsive nature of the signal .
thus it can be used to evaluate potential defects and its service capabilities for pva fiber concrete .
the kurtosis index was used to analyze ae signal in the present study .
it is calculated as follows [ 18 ] : ( 1 ) kurtosis = 1nsumn = 1n ( x ( n ) - 1nsumn = 1nx ( n )) 4 [ 1nsumn = 1n ( x ( n ) - 1nsumn = 1nx ( n )) 2 ] 2where n is the length of each group ae characteristic parameter ( energy ) x ( n ) .
kurtosis indexes can show the differences between different damage stages .
when the kurtosis value is smaller ; the fatigue damage is the smaller , and the greater the kurtosis value , the greater the fatigue damage is [ 18 ] .
in structural fatigue damage monitoring by ae , ae signals of each load cycle are as a group to calculate kurtosis value .
the kurtosis index is shown in figure 10 .
it is reduced in general when fiber contents increase .
on the 16th and 32nd cycle load sets , the kurtosis indexes of different fiber contents appear as extreme values , which suggests that the internal damage is serious .
the analysis reveals that in temperature fatigue load , the internal part of the concrete produces temperature stress , and the pva fiber bears part of the stress. with increasing damage , this internal strain is continuously accumulated .
when the strain reaches a certain limit , the accumulated energy is released and the temperature stress inside the specimen is reduced .
in later temperature fatigue load ( after 40 cycles ) , the kurtosis index of the 0.5 kg / m3 fiber content specimens increases rapidly , which results in increased and serious specimen damage .
in this case , the function of pva fiber in resisting stress and deformation weakens .
calculation of the kurtosis index reveals that antifreeze ability is more ideal for specimens with fiber content of 5 kg / m3 .
4.2 .
evaluation pva fiber concrete damage evolution by b - value the b - value is an effective method in studying the fracture mechanism .
the b - values for different materials also show different ranges of values and reflect the degree of damage degradation for the concrete material .
schumacher et al .
[ 20 ] proposed that if there are several low amplitude values for an ae event and the signal is more dispersed with b > 1.0 , microscopic cracks will form .
in this experiment , each cycle of temperature load is performed for a data group , and then b - value is calculated .
the b - value is calculated in the ae technique as follows [ 14 ] : ( 2 ) log10n = a - bxadbwhere n is the ae event , adb is the peak amplitude of the ae event in decibels , and a and b are empirical constants .
the b - value is obtained by the least square method .
the b - value is shown in figure 11 .
when the fiber content is greater , the b - value is higher .
a low fiber content has a lower b - value for higher amplitude events ( as shown in figures 8 ) from potential macro - cracking .
at the initial stage , the fibers bear part of the stress , which generates very small micro cracks and expansions .
on the 16th cycle load set , the b - value becomes small .
this indicates that internal micro cracks appear in the specimens , showing a redistribution of internal stress. with increasing temperature fatigue cycles , the bearing stress in the pva fiber increases .
the damage is slightly different from that at the initial stage .
the temperature fatigue resistance performance does not significantly change and brittle failure is not expected to occur .
the fatigue cycle last stage is the damage acceleration stage , especially for specimens with fiber content of 0.5 kg / m3 .
the b - value is reduced and reaches a minimum value. through visual inspection , some cracks appeared on the fiber concrete surface .
the inner micro cracks had developed external macro cracks .
the specimens deteriorate rapidly .
damage in specimens with fiber content of 1.0 and 1.5 kg / m3 is still very small .
the load and ae amplitude signals in figures 4 - 7 reflect the laws .
thus , pva fibers can effectively delay the deformation process in concrete material damage .
when the fiber volume is high , the damage is small .
5. conclusions in this study , pva fiber concrete temperature fatigue tests were used to obtain the ae characteristics parameters .
an analysis of the degradation and damage evolution process was then performed .
the main conclusions drawn from the experiment are as follows : pva fiber has a significant effect on the improvement of frost resistance in concrete , and effectively improves its durability .
the higher the fiber content , the smaller the degree of damage .
the ae signals show high correlation with the damage of the pva fiber concrete .
the damage evolution process of pva fiber concrete can be accurately expressed using the ae technique .
temperature fatigue load has a large influence on pva fiber concrete damage and ae characteristic parameters .
the kurtosis index and b - value index can qualitatively evaluate damage status and the damage evolution process for pva fiber concrete .
as damage develops on the pva fiber concrete , the kurtosis index increases and the b - value becomes small .

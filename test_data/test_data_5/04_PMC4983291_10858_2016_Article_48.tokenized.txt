new experiments dedicated for large idps backbone resonance assignment are presented .
the most distinctive feature of all described techniques is the employment of mocca - xy16 mixing sequences to obtain effective magnetization transfers between carbonyl carbon backbone nuclei .
the proposed 4 and 5 dimensional experiments provide a high dispersion of obtained signals making them suitable for use in the case of large idps ( application to 354 a. a. residues of tau protein 3x isoform is presented ) as well as provide both forward and backward connectivities .
what is more , connecting short chains interrupted with proline residues is also possible .
all the experiments employ non - uniform sampling .

these proteins are not only lacking stably folded tertiary structures but also their intrinsic flexibility has significant impact on their biological functionality , therefore challenging the old structure - function paradigm .
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( nmr ) is nowadays one of the most efficient spectroscopic techniques in the life sciences , providing insight into molecular structure and dynamics .
in recent years , the fast progress of nmr methodology and applications can be observed with special attention paid to difficult , but biologically relevant systems such as idps .
in contrast to well - folded globular proteins , the peculiar properties of idps introduce additional challenges that need to be overcome to obtain spectra enabling effective resonance assignment .
the conformational dynamics exhibited by idps lead to severe averaging of chemical shifts , which are mostly determined by the amino acid chemical composition and the protein 's primary structure .
at the same time , however , this dynamic behavior leads to favorable relaxation properties , and allows high dimensionality and long evolution periods within pulse sequences .
prolines are often abundant in idps , thus further complicating the resonance assignment procedure .
application of sparse non - uniform sampling ( nus ) in nmr experiments enabled resolution enhancement and high - dimensionality without prohibitively long experiment durations , by the acquisition of only a small fraction of data points required conventionally ( mobli and hoch 2008 ; coggins et al .
2010 ; orekhov and jaravine 2011 ; freeman and kupce 2012 ; hiller and wider 2012 ; kazimierczuk et al .
2012 ) .
in the case of an experiment producing a small number of spectral peaks featuring a limited range of amplitudes , reasonably good spectra can be obtained by employing simple zero - augmented fourier transformation .
however , when artefacts due to incomplete sampling are comparable or stronger than weaker peaks , the spectrum should be reconstructed in order to remove artefacts .
till now , several strategies were proposed for the reconstruction of sparsely sampled data sets .
among them : maximum entropy ( robin et al. 1991 ) , multidimensional decomposition ( mdd ) ( orekhov and jaravine 2011 ) , compressed sensing ( cs ) ( kazimierczuk and orekhov 2011 ; holland et al .
2011 ) , and signal separation algorithm ( ssa ) ( stanek and kozminski 2010 ; stanek et al. 2012 ) .
all of them proved their usability for different kinds of experiments .
the approaches for effective resonance assignment of idps include automated projection spectroscopy ( apsy ) ( hiller et al. 2005 ; narayanan et al. 2010 ; yao et al. 2014 ) , ha ( mantylahti et al. 2010 ; yao et al. 2014 ) and direct 13c detection ( bermel et al. 2006 , 2009 ; novacek et al .
2011 ; pantoja - uceda and santoro 2013 ) , as well as high - dimensional ( 4 - 7d ) non - uniformly sampled experiments ( kazimierczuk et al. 2013 ; nowakowski et al. 2015 ) .
in contrast to well folded proteins , where the use of aliphatic 1h and 13c chemical shifts proved their usefulness , in idps the aliphatic chemical shifts depend mostly on the residue type .
in the case of idp molecules , the most resolved are the backbone co and n chemical shifts , thus leading to the " con - con " approach ( piai et al. 2014 ; zerko and kozminski 2015 ) .
the aim of present study was to design new techniques capable of providing robust sequential resonance assignment of disordered proteins not only of moderate size but also for larger constructs , as illustrated by a full co , n , nh resonance assignment of 354 a. a. tau protein 3x isoform .
to achieve these goals two 5 dimensional : ( h ) ncoconh and ( haca ) con ( co ) conh techniques were designed and compared .
the use of mocca - xy16 block for performing co - co tocsy mixing as a crucial magnetization transfer between neighbouring amino acid residues was chosen .
both experiments provide robust connectivities through co ( i - 1 ) n ( i ) chemical shift pairs .
3d hnco was used as the base spectrum in the sparse multidimensional fourier transform ( kazimierczuk et al. 2009 ) processing routine .
high dimensionality secures good signal separation while nus allows to achieve high resolution in indirectly detected dimensions .
the first experiment , 5d ( h ) ncoconh , is a direct expansion of a 3 dimensional experiment presented by yoshimura et al .
( 2015 ) who already proved its capability of performing assignment of non - proline resonances of alpha - synuclein .
moreover , he showed that obtaining cross - peaks from i +/ - 3 residues is possible when long enough mixing time is used .
nevertheless , in our case , it was decided to attune mixing time to provide i +/ - 1 connectivities as lower number of peaks present in the spectra simplify data analysis as well as leads to a lower sampling noise level .
the second experiment , 5d ( haca ) con ( co ) conh , exploits halpha excitation .
it improves s / n ratio in the case of effectively exchangeable hn residues , but more importantly , makes the resonance assignment of proline residues fairly easy .
taking into account the presence of both i +/ - 1 cross - peaks , it allows reliable resonance assignment of proline abundant protein sequence fragments , which is often the case in idps .
in comparison to other 5d approaches a significant advantage is the correlation not only with antecedent ( i - 1 ) but also with a following ( i + 1 ) residue .
aforementioned approach presented by yoshimura et al .
( 2015 ) used only 3d spectra basing on peak separation in the 1h,15n dimensions .
in the figure s1 the comparison of 3d and 4d spectra , acquired for tau3x protein is provided .
it clearly shows significantly lower level of peak overlap owing to additional co dimension in 4d spectra , which facilitates unambiguous spectra analysis .
another important parameter is the b0 field strength used .
higher field brings improvements in both sensitivity and resolution , on the other hand , this effect is counterbalanced by an increase in relaxation loses during the co evolution and mixing periods .
in fact , mocca - xy16 mixing sequence minimizes relaxation loses ( furrer et al .
2004 ) since the magnetization is transverse only during 180degrees pulses .
nevertheless , such relaxation loses become significant for long mixing periods .
since relaxation of co nuclei is dominated by the chemical shift anisotropy mechanism , the effectiveness of which scales up with the square of b0 , the use of higher b0 fields may not be an optimal choice .
hence , proposed pulse sequences' performance was tested on 600 and 800 mhz spectrometers .
in principle , the resonance assignment strategy based on a 3d hnco and a single 5d experiment ( haca ) con ( co ) conh could provide complete ( including proline residues ) and robust data for a backbone ( hn , n and co ) resonance assignment .
the application to tau3x isoform proved that this ideal case in not as far from reality as one could imagine .
first , application of both 5d experiments to a sample of alpha - synuclein , a medium size ( 140 a.a. ) idp is presented .
finally , application of two complementary 4d experiments derived from 5d ( haca ) con ( co ) conh performed on a tau3x protein sample is discussed and compared with results obtained using a different set of 5d experiments .
materials and methods pulse sequences magnetization transfers schemes and pulse sequences of 5d ( h ) ncoconh and 5d ( haca ) con ( co ) conh are provided in the figs. 1 and 2 .
the radiofrequency ( rf ) field of the co - selective 180degrees pulses in mocca - xy16 was set at 4.68 ( 6.23 ) khz with a duration of the 180degrees pulse ( d ) of 107.0 ( 80.2 ) mus on the 600 ( 800 ) mhz spectrometer , which was determined in order to ensure that calpha nuclei experience an effective 720degrees rotation during each carbonyl 180degrees pulse ( felli et al. 2009 ) .
it is possible to choose pulse power to get 360degrees rotation for calpha but it would significantly increase the amount of energy dissipated at the rf coil .
furthermore , 720degrees rotation choice leads to narrower inversion profiles but in the case of idps such narrow bandwidths are still sufficient to cover all involved nuclei .
value of the 180degrees pulse repetition period delta ( delta is calculated including 180degrees pulse length ) was initially set to 500 mus .
mixing time was attuned to provide magnetizations transfers between consecutive co nuclei securing the presence of i +/ - 1 cross - peaks. fig. 1 coherence pathway schemes for 5d ( h ) ncoconh ( top ) and 5d ( haca ) con ( co ) conh ( bottom ) experiments fig. 2 ( h ) ncoconh ( top ) and ( haca ) con ( co ) conh ( bottom ) experiments pulse sequence schemes .
rectangles represent hard pulses .
filled and empty symbols represent 90degrees and 180degrees pulses , respectively .
1h and 15n composite pulse decoupling is performed with waltz - 16 ( shaka et al .
1983 ) , at gammab1 / 2pi of 5.1 and 1.14 khz at 800 mhz spectrometer , and 3.37 and 0.97 khz at 600 mhz , respectively .
simultaneous inversion of ca and co spins is achieved using a 6 - element composite pulse ( shaka 1985 ) .
selective ca and co 13c pulses are applied with the rf field strength adjusted to | deltaomegaca - co |/ sqrt15 ( sqrt3 ) for 90degrees and 180degrees pulses , respectively .
for the 800 mhz spectrometer 90degrees and 180degrees , rectangular and sinc - shaped pulsed ( bell - shaped at the scheme ) with a duration of 40.1 ( 35.9 ) micros , and 65.8 ( 58.8 ) micros , respectively , are used .
whereas , for the 600 mhz spectrometer the respective pulse lengths are 53.5 ( 47.9 ) micros and 87.8 ( 78.4 ) micros .
off - resonance pulses are applied using phase modulation of the carrier .
the pfg durations are set to 0.5 ms , except for coherence selection gradients for which 2.0 and 0.2 ms , are used .
delay durations are set as follows : deltanh = 5.4 ms , deltanco = 28 ms , deltacoca = 9.1 ms. evolution periods for h , n , co are in semi - constant - time mode : ai = ( ti + delta )/ 2 ; bi = ti ( 1 - delta / timax )/ 2 ; ci = delta ( 1 - ti / timax )/ 2 or in constant - time mode : ai = ( ti + delta )/ 2 ; bi = 0 ; ci = ( delta - ti )/ 2 where delta stands for deltanh , deltanco .
in the second sequence evolution for n in t2 is in real - time mode .
the four step phase cycle is : phi1 = x , - x ; phi2 = 2x , 2 ( - x ) and phirec = x , 2 ( - x ) , x. in t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 dimensions quadrature is accomplished using states - tppi method , by incrementing phi1 , phi2 , phi3 , phi4 phases , respectively .
the phase psi = x is inverted simultaneously with the last gradient pulse to achieve echo - antiecho coherence transfer selection in the last indirect dimension .
the coherence selection gradients marked with xyz are applied at the magic angle ( 600 mhz ) or along the z axis ( 800 mhz ) .
180degrees water 1.42 ( 1.07 ) ms sinc - shaped flipback pulses are used , on the 600 and 800 mhz spectrometers , respectively nmr spectroscopy all measurements were performed on agilent dd2 600 and 800 mhz spectrometers equipped with standard triple resonance room temperature probes .
in all experiments : four scans were acquired for each fid , relaxation delay of 1.3 s was used , mixing time was set to 250 ms and temperature to 288 k. delta of 500 and 250 mus was used for alpha - synuclein and tau3x protein measurements , respectively .
detailed spectral widths and maximal evolution times are given in the supporting information table s1 .
the pulse sequence codes for varian / agilent spectrometers are available from the authors on demand .
for 5d spectra 3d hnco was used as an input for sparse multidimensional fourier transform procedure ( kazimierczuk et al. 2009 ) .
all spectra were processed using toastd ( kazimierczuk et al .
2006 ) , additionally cleaner3d ( stanek and kozminski 2010 ) , cleaner4d ( stanek et al. 2012 ) , and reduced ( kazimierczuk et al .
2009 ) programmes were used for processing 3d , 4d and 5d spectra , respectively .
all used processing software is available at http :// nmr.cent3.uw.edu.pl / software .
all spectra were inspected using the sparky program ( goddard and kneller 2000 ) , nmrglue python package was used for visualization purposes ( helmus and jaroniec 2013 ) .
the whole spectra analysis and resonance assignment were performed manually .
sample preparation nmr sample of alpha - synuclein contained 1 mm of 13c,15n - labeled alpha - synuclein in a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer , ph 6.5 , 200 mm nacl , 10 % d2o .
nmr sample of tau3x contained 0.5 mm of 13c,15n - labeled tau3x in 20 mm nap , 1 mm beta - merc.etoh , 1 mm edta , 1 mm nan3 , 100 mm nacl , 10 % d2o .
results and discussion application to alpha - synuclein a crucial acquisition parameter is the length of the mixing sequence .
to find an efficient duration of the mixing time two ( h ) ncoconh spectra were recorded with mixing times set to 150 and 250 ms , respectively .
it appears that for the employed mocca - xy16 implementation longer mixing times are preferred ( see columns 1 and 2 in the table 1 ) and 250 ms mixing time was used for all further acquisitions .
since , the rate of coherence transfer does not depend on the field strength , the value established at 800 mhz , due to better relaxation properties at lower field , is always a safe choice .
the next step of the study was to compare the performance of the two proposed pulse sequences : ( h ) ncoconh and ( haca ) con ( co ) conh ( see fig. 3 for the examples of obtained 2d cross - sections ) .
note that , since s / n ratio in the case of non - uniformly sampled spectra is an ill - defined parameter ( hyberts et al .
2013 ) , to objectively evaluate the results from different acquisition setups the number of identified peaks was compared .
as one can see from comparison of the results presented in the columns 2 and 3 , table 1 .
( haca ) con ( co ) conh technique provides slightly more complete results .
note , that this experiment additionally allows effective resonance assignment of proline residues .
the smaller influence of the hn exchange on the performance of 5d ( haca ) con ( co ) conh seems to counterbalance the use of a longer and more complicated pulse sequence .

diagonal peak positions are marked with black crosses .
note the presence of cross - peaks a107co - p108n on 3rd and 4th panels ( bottom ) , which allow sequential assignment despite the presence of a proline residue to finally evaluate the performance of the proposed ( haca ) con ( co ) conh experiment , two longer ( 71 h long each ) acquisitions were performed on two different spectrometers , 600 and 800 mhz ( see table 2 ) .
although the results of the measurements on both spectrometers were comparable , surprisingly , the lower ( 600 mhz ) field spectrometer provided slightly more information .

2010 ) and 5d ( haca ) con ( ca ) conh ( zawadzka - kazimierczuk et al. 2012 ) .
additionally , for easy amino acid residue type determination 5d habcabconh ( kazimierczuk et al. 2010 ) and 5d hc ( cc - tocsy ) conh ( kazimierczuk et al. 2009 ; hiller et al. 2008 ) were recorded .
all spectra were recorded using a 800 mhz spectrometer equipped with a standard triple resonance room - temperature probe , total measurement time for all 5d experiments was 92 h. the obtained results are depicted in fig. 4. as one can see , the vast majority of the residues have been assigned ( 328 out of 353 coi - 1ni pairs ) which would ordinarily be considered a satisfactory result .
nevertheless , all of the unassigned coi - 1ni pairs are located in proline rich fragments of tau3x protein sequence , clearly showing that the assignment procedure was limited by insufficient information gained from analysed spectra .
in other words , for a full assignment of such regions a different approach is needed. fig. 4 tau3x protein sequence with resonance assignment of con pairs obtained using : 3d hnco , 5d hn ( ca ) conh , 5d ( haca ) con ( ca ) conh , 5dn habcabconh and 5d hc ( cc - tocsy ) conh .
green con pair assigned , black only co assigned , blue only n assigned , red no assignment knowing that sampling artefacts will be even more troublesome in the case of a larger protein and taking into account the incomplete set of signals obtained for the alpha - synuclein sample , suggesting limited sensitivity of the proposed techniques , it was decided to lower the dimensionality of experiments used for tau3x resonance assignment .
application of 4d spectra allows access to a vast number of efficient reconstruction methods , which suppress sampling artefacts ( i.e. maximum entropy , signal separation algorithm ) .
in addition , 4d experiments are more sensitive , on the other hand they provide more ambiguous data .
naturally , different choice of 4 from 5 dimensions in a 4d experiment derived from the proposed 5d experiment is possible .
in our approach each 4d experiment provides only one new chemical shift ( co or n ) correlating it with the three chemical shifts already known from 3d hnco - - we call this the " 1 + 3 " approach .
obviously several " 2 + 2 " 4d experiments could be proposed ( i.e. con + hn,n ; con + hn,co ;) .
we concluded that all of these " 2 + 2 " possibilities are less favourable , mainly because the main bottleneck in the analysis of resultant spectra of all of them would be the fact that none of 2d correlations could provide sufficiently dispersed peaks .
even the most desired co ( i - 1 ) n ( i ) correlation 2d spectrum becomes crowded in the case of relatively big proteins ( see fig. 5 ) and providing additional hn chemical shift can significantly reduce this problem .
another drawback of a con + cohn approach would be the lack of sensitivity enhancement that would compromise the signal to noise ratio in such a 4d experiment. fig. 5 tau3x con projection taken from a 3d hnco spectrum ( left ) .
zoom into the most crowded part of the con projection ( right ) the second attempt used only the 3d hnco , and two complementary 4d spectra : ( haca ) co ( nco ) conh and ( hacaco ) n ( co ) conh ( 66 h long each ) .
all spectra were recorded using a 600 mhz spectrometer equipped with a standard triple resonance room - temperature probe .
the 4d experiments used correlate co ( i - 1 ) and n ( i ) chemical shifts with signals present in the 3d hnco .
as a result , 4d spectra can be inspected in a manner similar to the usual 3d triple resonance experiments used for protein sequential resonance assignment ( see figs. 6 , 7 ) .
the only difference is that instead of 1h , 15n - hsqc a 3d hnco is treated as a base for the analysis of strip plots obtained from 4d experiments , which allows for a disambiguation of spectra analysis , as the resonance assignment process of idps is hampered by a severe peak overlap ( see figure s1 for a comparison of peaks separation provided by the used 4d experiments with 3d ( hacaco ) n ( coco ) nh and 3d ( haca ) co ( ncoco ) nh ) .
both 4d spectra were processed using the cleaner4d program ( stanek et al .
2012 ) performing spectral reconstruction using the ssa algorithm , currently the only one capable of efficient processing of such high resolution 4d data sets , with file sizes reaching 140 gbs .
what is worth mentioning , no additional spectra providing calpha and / or cbeta chemical shifts were used to aid with the identification of residue type , as it was not found to be necessary .
since a 600 mhz spectrometer was used , relaxation loses during tocsy mixing were significantly suppressed in comparison to the 800 mhz spectrometer , and to improve mixing effectiveness taking advantage of lower power load at 600 mhz , it was decided to use a shorter delta value of 250 micros. fig. 6 strip plots for the residues from a101 to g151 taken from 4d ( haca ) co ( nco ) conh of tau3x .
diagonal peak positions are marked with black crosses .
strips plots for proline residues are not shown .
13c chemical shifts of residues preceding prolines are evaluated from cross - peaks present on neighbouring residues' strip plots fig. 7 strip plots for the residues from a101 to g151 taken from 4d ( hacaco ) n ( co ) conh of tau3x .
diagonal peak positions are marked with black crosses .
strips plots for proline residues are not shown , nonetheless their 15n chemical shifts are evaluated from cross - peaks present on neighbouring residues' strip plots .
the small , lower 15n frequency peaks originate from 2h15n - 1h15n isotopomers the final results are depicted in fig. 8. only 1g and 150p n and 354l co chemical shifts are missing .
additionally , the mixed - up assignments of 213 - 214 and 276 - 277 residues were identified and corrected .
overall performance of the strategy used is more than satisfactory , as an almost full assignment was obtained , even though the experiments were performed using a standard 600 mhz spectrometer and without the use of an expensive cryogenically cooled probe. fig. 8 tau3x protein sequence with resonance assignment of con pairs obtained using 3d hnco , 4d ( haca ) co ( nco ) conh and 4d ( hacaco ) n ( co ) conh .
green con pair assigned , black only co assigned , blue only n assigned .
red background indicates correction of a previous assignment discussion the backbone ( hn , n and co ) resonance assignment obtained with ( 4 ) 5d ( haca ) con ( co ) conh could be easily complemented with calpha / beta and halpha / beta chemical shifts , for example with 5d habcabconh .
it would be even possible to incorporate evolutions of ca and ha chemical shifts within the presented experiments in a similar manner to the recently presented hybrid of sparse random sampling and projection spectroscopy ( zerko and kozminski 2015 ) .
resonance assignment can be further expanded to the side chains using 5d hc ( cc - tocsy ) conh leading to a full signal assignment .
in our study of tau3x isoform , 5d ( haca ) con ( co ) conh did not provide sufficient sensitivity .
it should be possible to overcome this limitation by utilising a cryogenically cooled probe , especially employing shaped salt tolerant nmr tubes .
spectral quality would surely benefit from the removal of sampling artefacts which at present is not possible for 5 dimensional spectra .
results obtained from a set of two 4d spectra are more than satisfactory .
in similar challenging studies of big disordered proteins comparably complete resonance assignment was obtained only for the map2c protein ( novacek et al. 2013 ) .
previous studies of proteins from the tau family provided less complete assignments than this study ( narayanan et al. 2010 ; yao et al. 2014 ) .
what is more , all of aforementioned studies were performed on significantly more concentrated samples and using far more expensive high - field spectrometers equipped with cryogenically cooled probes , which demonstrates the superiority of the novel approach presented herein .
conclusions we presented new 4d and 5d experiments for the backbone resonance assignment of intrinsically disordered proteins .
described techniques use co - co tocsy type magnetization transfers and are especially effective in the resonance assignment of proline rich sequence fragments .
we proved that these experiments can be successfully run on a standard room - temperature probe , even on a medium field nmr spectrometer ( 600 mhz ) .

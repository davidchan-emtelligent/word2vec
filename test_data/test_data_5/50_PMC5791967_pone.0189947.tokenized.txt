extremely low temperatures present various challenges to life that include ice formation and effects on metabolic capacity .
psyhcrophilic microorganisms typically have an array of mechanisms to enable survival in cold temperatures .
in this study , we sequenced and analysed the genome of a psychrophilic yeast isolated in the antarctic region , glaciozyma antarctica .
the genome annotation identified 7857 protein coding sequences. from the genome sequence analysis we were able to identify genes that encoded for proteins known to be associated with cold survival , in addition to annotating genes that are unique to g. antarctica .
for genes that are known to be involved in cold adaptation such as anti - freeze proteins ( afps ) , our gene expression analysis revealed that they were differentially transcribed over time and in response to different temperatures .
this indicated the presence of an array of adaptation systems that can respond to a changing but persistent cold environment .
we were also able to validate the activity of all the afps annotated where the recombinant afps demonstrated anti - freeze capacity .
this work is an important foundation for further collective exploration into psychrophilic microbiology where among other potential , the genes unique to this species may represent a pool of novel mechanisms for cold survival .

background the extreme cold environments of the polar , deep sea and alpine regions are inhabited by psychrophilic microbial life that have evolved physiological strategies for cold adaptation that include the production of antifreeze proteins , modulation of enzyme kinetics and preservation of membrane fluidity [ 1 , 2 ] .
cowan and colleagues [ 3 ] have reviewed the impact of ' omic ' technologies towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of psychrophilic adaptation in which they also presented a list of completed and unfinished psychrophilic genomes .
the early genomes of the psychrophilic microbes [ 4 - 7 ] were able to provide a glimpse into content that were unique for cold temperature survival and these were thus able to provide an understanding into role of genome evolution in cold adaptation [ 8 ] .
in addition to genome and omics acquired insights , biochemical investigations into enzyme function at low temperatures also contribute to a collective understanding how molecular adaptations [ 9 , 10 ] can be translated to a physiological psyhrophilic lifestyle .
for psychrophilic microorganisms , the absence of a physical insulative barrier to keep out the cold meant that adaptation had to be physiological and implemented at the cellular and molecular level .
these adaptations include the production of antifreeze proteins or cryoprotectants , changing the fluidity of its membrane and the modification of enzyme properties [ 2 ] .
cellular freezing that could damage the capacity for intracellular activity and change the osmotic level need to be avoided , and this could be achieved by the production of exopolysaccharides ( eps ) that function as cryoprotectants by trapping water , nutrients and metal ions thus facilitating biofilm formation around the cell [ 11 ] .
furthermore , eps can also lower the freezing point and ice nucleation temperature of the water [ 2 ] .
in addition , the presence of free radicals outside the cells could be protected by the formation of trehalose disaccharide which can also stabilize the cellular membrane under extreme cold condition [ 12 ] .
the rigidity of the membrane at freezing temperatures can be overcome by increasing the polyunsaturated fatty acid ( pufa ) content [ 1 ] .
this would hypothetically make genes encoding fatty acid desaturases ( fad ) that are involved in the addition of pufa an important characteristic of cold adaptation and many studies have indeed shown increased expression of genes encoding fad at lower temperatures [ 13 , 14 ] .
comparative studies also show that general membrane transport proteins such as peptide transporters , which are involved in the uptake of nutrients and membrane peptides , are also up - regulated at lower temperatures [ 15 ] .
furthermore , molecular studies shown that psychrophilic enzymes increased their structural flexibility in freezing temperatures due to the increased content of specific amino acids such as glycine [ 16 ] and this is notably so near the enzyme catalytic sites in order to increase its local mobility [ 17 ] .
in addition , the lysine - to - arginine ratios also increased thus lowering hydrogen bonding and salt bridge formation [ 18 , 19 ] .
to date , most cold - adapted enzymes have been discovered and sourced from bacteria [ 9 , 20 , 21 ] and archaea [ 22 , 23 ] ; even so , antifreeze proteins and several cold adapted metabolic enzymes have been reported for several fish species [ 24 , 25 ] .
most ice binding proteins are known to be monomeric , however , lee et al 2012 reported a novel dimeric example from the arctic yeast glaciozyma sp .
( formerly known as leucosporidium sp. ) that had a complex ice binding site which may allow interactions with multiple faces of the ice crystal [ 26 ] .
another report for glaciozyma sp. ice binding protein presented its capacity to provide antioxidative effects [ 27 ] .
analyzing the genome of a psychrophilic eukaryotic microbe will provide insights into the cold adaptation strategies that are independent of the significant insulative barrier mechanisms available to vertebrate eukaryotes .
in this work , we report the first genome sequence for a pyschrophilic yeast , glaciozyma antarctica .
several physiological pyschrophily mechanisms for microbes that include the production of antifreeze proteins ( afp ) , an increased proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane for maintenance of membrane fluidity , cold adapted enzymes and the presence of cryoprotectant sugars and polyols have been reviewed by d'amico et al .
[ 1 ] .
in this paper , we show the presence , in g. antarctica , of such previously reported cold adaptation mechanisms by first identifying components of the genome that encode antifreeze proteins ( afps ) and fatty acid desaturases ( fads ) .
having identified the relevant genes , we were then able to uncover temperature - related variations of gene expression levels for the different afps and fads encoded in the g. antarctica genome by quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( rt - qpcr ) experiments .
it is most probable that a combination of mechanisms are employed by g. antarctica for cold temperature survival and growth as has been previously reported by blanc et al [ 28 ] for the psychrophilic microalga c. subellipsoidea .
comparative analyses were further able to contrast features of the genome that were possibly due to g. antarctica 's psychrophilic lifestyle that were absent in non - psychrophilic yeasts but present in other , more distantly related , psychrophiles .
our genome characterization and subsequent validation experiments provide insights into an extensive array of defenses deployed to protect the cell against extreme persistently cold environments .
results and discussion genome content and structure the glaciozyma antarctica pi12 draft genome sequence ( genbank accession asrt0000000 ) was generated using a combination of 454 pyrosequencing ( 2.33 gb ; 117x coverage ) and sanger sequencing of 12,948 fosmid sequences ( 8.9 mb ) .
the 20,033,549 bps were assembled into 21 gap - free scaffolds ranging from 2.7 kb to 2.28 mb. gene predictions identified 7857 putative protein coding genes ( cds ) that make up 59.2 % of the genome sequence , 79 trna genes and 3 rrna genes .
the ~ 20 mb g. antarctica genome is similar in size to those of two other basidiomycetes with published genome sequences cryptococcus neoformans [ 29 ] and ustilago maydis [ 30 ] ( table 1 ) although it has a considerably higher g + c content of 60 % ( table 1 ) .

the est sequences were generated from nine cdna libraries that were constructed from mrna extracted from variations of temperature ( - 12degreesc , 0degreesc , 15degreesc ) , media ( ypd and ynb see table a in s1 file ) and growth phases ( lag , exponential , post - diauxic , stationary phases ) .
the combined est contigs yielded 7,369 unique transcripts consisting of 4,203 consensus and 3,166 singleton sequences .
the majority ( 67 %) of the predicted coding regions from the genome assembly were matched to the ests leaving 726 predicted genes with known homologs without assigned ests .
the remaining 2920 ( 37 %) of the predicted genes were classified as hypothetical proteins .
in order to acquire further insights into cold adaptation mechanisms that could be extracted from the genome sequence data , the genome was analyzed with the specific intent of ( i ) identifying unique components of the g. antarctica genome that are not present in the available genome sequences of other yeasts ; ( ii ) identifying components of the genome that were shared with other psychrophiles but are absent in other yeasts ; and ( iii ) identifying orthologs of proteins that have been reported to be involved in cold adaptation .
we were then able to select targets from these analyses for validation by either mapping their results back to ests that were products of cdna libraries generated from three different g. antarctica culture temperatures ( 15degreesc , 0degreesc , - 12degreesc ) , or via rt - qpcr analysis of the mrna extracted from g. antarctica at optimal culture temperatures ( 15degreesc ) and those that simulated cold stress ( 0degreesc and - 12degreesc ) .
intergenic , intronic and snorna sequences intergenic and intronic sequences represent 70.85 % of the entire g. antarctica genome .
similar intronic and intergenic contents have been observed in related yeast counterparts , with 63.85 % in saccharomyces cerevisiae ( s288c chromosome i - xvi ) , 71.66 % in schizosaccharomyces pombe ( 972h - chromosome i - iii ) and 73.65 % in cryptococcus neoformans ( var. neoformans jec21 chromosome 1 - 14 ) .
a total of 45 box c / d small nucleolar rna ( snorna ) genes were predicted by analysing the extracted intronic and intergenic sequences ( fig 1a ) .
snornas are small rna molecules that guide the chemical modifications of other rnas by enzymes such as methyltransferases ( for box c / d snornas ) and pseudouridylases ( for box h / aca snornas [ 31 , 32 ]. by using the predicted 18s and 25s rrna sequences as possible modification targets , we identified nine potential methylation sites and two potential pseudouridylation sites for snorna marking .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0189947.g001 fig 1 snorna sequence and yeast conserved orthologs .
( a ) comparison of predicted box c / d small nucleolar rna ( snorna ) and ribosomal biogenesis genes in drosophila melanogaster , saccaromyces cerevisiae , coccomyxa subellipsoidea and glaciozyma antarctica , ( b ) comparison of predicted conserved orthologs between g. antarctica , pseudogymnoascus destructans , cryptococcus neoformans , saccaromyces cerevisiae , chaetomium thermophilum and myceliophthora thermophila .
further analysis revealed that each of the 45 putative box c / d snorna genes form pairings with ribosomal rna processing genes in one of their flanking regions .
we compared this finding to box c / d snorna genes that we annotated for the polar microalga c. subellipsoidea from the genome sequence reported by blanc et al .
[ 33 ] and discovered that a similar ratio and arrangement is present in the c. subellipsoidea genome .
out of the 97 ribosomal biogenesis genes found , 92 were predicted to have box c / d snornas residing either on their upstream or downstream flanks ( fig 1a ) .
this is equivalent to about 94.8 % of the total ribosomal biogenesis genes in c. subellipsoidea .
in contrast , only 32 out of 46 box c / d snorna genes with similar ribosomal rna processing gene pairings have been reported in saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 34 - 36 ] , while only 4 out of 26 box c / d snorna genes are so arranged in drosophila melanogaster [ 37 , 38 ] ( fig 1a ) .
this increased number of ribosomal protein biogenesis genes in ratio to the number of c / d snorna genes perhaps reflect the existence of a mechanism to compensate for possibly slower rates of protein synthesis in a psychrophilic environment .
yeast conserved orthologs and psychrophile - specific genes the identification of orthologs shared between g. antarctica and five other available fungal genomes that are mesophilic yeast ( saccharomyces cerevisiae and cryptococcus neoformans ) , thermophilic fungi ( myceliopthora thermophile and chaetomium thermophilum ) and a psychrophilic fungi ( pseudogymnoascus destructans ) enabled us to contrast the contents for these genomes thus identifying g. antarctica genes absent in the more closely related yeasts but present in p. destructans and therefore possibly associated to psychrophily .
these comparisons revealed that out of the predicted 7857 putative protein coding sequences ( cds ) for g. antarctica , 31.4 % of the genes were unique to the g. antarctica genome for this particular comparison set while the remaining 68.6 % had detectable orthologs in the other five fungal genomes ( fig 1b ) .
several protein families and domains have been associated to cold stress responses .
these proteins are known to function either as transcription factors ( cold shock domains ) , and / or chaperones ( cold shock domains , heat shock proteins and peptidyl prolyl isomerases ) .
among the genes absent in the non - psychrophilic yeast genomes are four that encode for proteins containing cold - shock domains ( gan _ 01 _ 006 , gan _ 16 _ 627 , gan _ 16 _ 676 , gan _ 16 _ 853 ) .
proteins of this class are known to bind nucleic acids as transcription factors or rna chaperones [ 39 , 40 ] and typically contain a conserved cold shock domain ( csd ) carrying rna recognition motifs .
the arrangements of the csd were different for each of these four potential cold - shock response proteins ( csp ) , suggesting that they are parts of proteins that perform different roles and possible products of convergent instead of divergent evolution .
an ortholog for gan _ 16 _ 627 was not found in the c. subellipsoidea genome while the other three csps had detectable orthologs .
three of the csps had one cold shock domain with each containing the rna recognition motifs 1 and 2 .
compared to the other three csps , gan _ 16 _ 627 was found to contain two adjacent cold shock domains with one domain being free of the rna recognition motifs .
a total of nineteen peptidylprolyl isomerases ( ppiase ) were also annotated .
these enzymes interconvert the cis and trans isomers of proline peptide bonds and can thus effect an increase in the rate of protein folding .
ppiases that are active at low temperatures are therefore important to maintain protein folding rates. of the nineteen ppiase encoding orfs , one was not found in any of the other four genomes compared ( gan _ 04 _ 354 ) .
six heat shock protein genes ( gan _ 02 _ 075 , gan _ 02 _ 254 , gan _ 08 _ 430 , gan _ 13 _ 463 , gan _ 16 _ 081 and gan _ 17 _ 157 ) also did not have homologs in the three other yeast genomes compared .
these genome level comparisons further identified 299 orthologs in all three non - psychrophilic yeast genomes that are missing in g. antarctica .
anti - freeze proteins are expressed in response to cold temperatures afps are known to inhibit ice growth and recrystallization thus enabling organisms producing these proteins to survive at temperatures below 0degreesc .
the affinity of afps towards ice can depress the freezing point of a solution in a non - colligative process known as thermal hysteresis ( th ) as well as inhibiting ice recrystallization ( ri ) and thus preventing the formation of larger ice grains. g. antarctica was discovered to secrete at least one antifreeze protein into the culture medium when grown at low temperatures (< 10degreesc ) [ 41 ] .
the search for homologs to known afps revealed a total of nine non - paralogous afp genes designated as gaafp1 - gaafp9 .
the nomenclature for the afps we describe here is based on the molecular weight , with gaafp1 being the smallest , and gaafp9 the heaviest .
the afps of g. antarctica also did not have any sequence homologs to any proteins encoded in the c. subellipsoidea genome published by blanc et al [ 28 ] .
gaafp1 ( gan _ 05 _ 237 ) was identified as the afp previously reported by hashim et al [ 41 ] .
a wider blast search against the non - redundant database at genbank revealed that homologs of these afps have been documented in other psychrophiles .
it was also discovered that scaffolds 5 and 16 each contained three adjacently located afp genes ; gan _ 05 _ 236 ( gaafp8 ) , gan _ 05 _ 237 ( gaafp1 ) , and gan _ 05 _ 238 ( gaafp7 ) in scaffold 5 while gan _ 16 _ 650 ( gaafp3 ) , gan _ 16 _ 651 ( gaafp4 ) and gan _ 16 _ 667 ( gaafp5 ) were in scaffold 16 .
all the g. antarctica afp sequences were predicted to be extracellular proteins due to the presence of n - terminal signal peptides .
this is expected due to the defensive role of afps in manipulating the environment surrounding the cell to prevent ice formation .
although it is probable that expression levels of the afps are influenced by temperature - dependent protein stability [ 42 ] , the availability of different afps can in itself be regarded as an important clue regarding their potential roles as responses to different types of ice structures .
the interactions of afps with ice ( reviewed by jia and davies - - [ 43 ]) are similar to other protein - ligand interactions , albeit unusual in that they involve extensive van der waals or hydrophobic contacts that are supplemented by hydrogen bonds .
because ice formation can result in different planes of ice that may have different surface topology and spacing between the oxygen atoms , these resulting different ice surfaces can therefore be regarded as different ligands that will interact with different afps .
our experiments to quantify the expression levels of the g. antarctica afps revealed that the expression levels of all putative afp genes was generally higher at lower temperatures ( 0degreesc - - 12degreesc ) ( fig 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0189947.g002 fig 2 relative expression profiles of nine gaafp genes at different temperatures ; 15degreesc , 0degreesc and - 12degreesc .
the bars represent the standard errors calculated from three biological replicates of each experiment .
at 0degreesc , we observed that the expressions of gaafp3 increased only after 48 hours .
however in the - 12degreesc experiments , expression of gaafp3 was highest at the 6 hour sampling point .
some of the genes were found to be highly expressed during the early stages of exposure ( 6 hours , - 12degreesc ) had decreased levels of expression over time ( fig 2 ) .
our results also showed that gaafp3 was the most highly expressed of the gaafp genes at - 12degrees .
we also found a consistent relationship between the expressions of gaafp1 , gaafp7 and gaafp8 , which are adjacent in the g. antarctica genome ( fig 2 ) .
the expression of gaafp1 seems to be reciprocal to that of the other two members of this cluster , being highest when expression of gaafp7 and 8 is lowest , and vice versa .
we also find that gaafp7 and gaafp8 are expressed sequentially , with the former being more highly expressed until 72 hours , after which the latter becomes more highly expressed , under all conditions of cold - stress .
the proximity of the genes encoding gaafp1 , gaafp7 and gaafp8 to each other suggests a shared regulatory mechanism that may involve a sensor system that triggers a different type of afp to be produced .
in this case , the sensor system may be shared but yet able to differentiate different types of ice structures and the reporting of the system results in the different expressions observed for gaafp7 and gaafp8 .
in bacteria , cold temperature sensing is believed to involve a membrane associated signal transduction system and these systems were reviewed by shivaji et al [ 44 ] .
although quite likely , it is unknown if a similar system is also applicable to yeasts .
changes in membrane fluidity that may change the expression of the des genes , which we discuss later , may have a correlation to the gaafp expression .
however , we are unable to make the correlation at this time due to the depth of our data not allowing for such relationships to be ascertained .
the time point associated trigger for afp8 may be as simple as a detectable change in the ice structures encountered where over time , the ice structures begin evolving a different structure .
the consistency of this 72 hour time mark may therefore be a result of the ice developing under the constant solute and temperature conditions of the experiment and may not reflect the actual response of the gene expression over time in the natural sea ice environment of g. antarctica .
hew et al [ 45 ] reported that the expression of afp proteins from salmon is related to the seasonal temperature , with the highest levels of afp expression detected in november ( winter ) and minimum levels in may ( summer ) .
the range of temperatures that the g. antarctica yeasts were subjected to in our experiments can be viewed as simulative of the seasonal temperature changes that may happen in the antarctic sea water where the highest levels of expression were detected at - 12degreesc while at the same time , the data suggests different roles for the different afps , which in turn reflects the possibility of different afps targeting different planes of the ice crystals or different types of ice formations .
we further investigated this possibility by conducting thermal hysteresis assays and observing the ice recrystallization inhibition by the different gaafps .
thermal hysteresis and ice recrystallization inhibition activity of g. antarctica afps full length cdnas were generated from transcripts of the afps that were extracted from 4degreesc .
these cdnas were cloned and heterologously expressed by e. coli for ice - recrystallization inhibition and thermal hysteresis assays .
all nine g. antarctica afps were overproduced and their thermal hysteresis activities assayed .
thermal hysteresis is the effect created by afps which can be measured as the difference between the melting point and the freezing point .
the highest th values recorded was for gaafp4 ( th = 0.079 +/ - 0.008degreesc ) while the lowest was that of gaafp5 ( th = 0.034 +/ - 0.008degreesc ) .
ice - crystals formed on the individual recombinant proteins were modified into a hexagonal shape ( fig 3a ) while the ice crystals in the control sample that were not treated with any g. antarctica afps remained a circular disk shape .
a cocktail of all recombinant gaafps resulted in th activity ( 0.147 +/ - 0.005degreesc ) that was slightly higher than those recorded by hashim et al [ 41 ] using wild - type proteins ( 0.1degreesc ) .
the qualitative recrystallization inhibition activity assays revealed that the ice grains in samples containing gaafp1 and gaafp5 were smaller ( fig 3b ) .
mixtures of all recombinant afps changed the ice - crystals to a star - like shape that resembled those formed with wild - type proteins .
the addition of proteinase k to all recombinant afps eliminated the inhibition of ice - crystal formation thus proving that the observed hysteresis activity was a result of the afps' activity .
based on a review of the available literature , the work we report here is the first time in which all the identified afps from a single organism have been experimentally confirmed .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0189947.g003 fig 3 antifreeze activity exhibited by recombinant gaafp .
( a ) ice crystals in samples containing recombinant gaafp proteins were deformed into hexagonal shapes while the control untreated sample of ice crystals were disk shaped and the afp eliminated samples containing proteinasek reverted to the circular shape of the untreated sample ; ( b ) ice recrystallization inhibition activity after incubation at - 6degreesc for 30 min where samples containing the nine recombinant gaafp proteins resulted in the formation of smaller ice grains compared to the coarse grains observed for the untreated samples while the samples that have the afp effect eliminated by proteinasek have reverted to coarse ice grains .
the presence of multiple genes encoding different afps has been well documented ( see background section ) .
however , our gene expression analysis over time and at different temperatures , in addition to the thermal hysteresis and ice recrystallization inhibition assays , were further able to provide possible context with regard to the requirement for multiple afp genes .
it is clear that the various afps are not expressed simultaneously but are instead produced as seeming responses to specific temperatures and time periods for a sustained temperature .
although we do not have direct evidence of association , this observation implies that different afps may interact with different ice structures that form at different temperatures ; furthermore ice structures at the same temperature may also change over time thus requiring different afps to be deployed as a response over a longer time period at the same temperature .
fatty acid desaturases the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids by fatty acid desaturases ( fad ) , enzymes that introduce double bonds into membrane lipids , has been shown to be up - regulated in response to low temperatures in cyanobacteria [ 46 ] , milkfish and grass carp [ 47 ] and insects [ 48 ] .
a total of eight fads , from four different families ( des6 , des9 , des12 and des15 ) were annotated for g. antarctica .
we observed that the expression of des9 ( des9a ; gan _ 06 _ 293 , des9b ; gan _ 12 _ 274 , des9c ; gan _ 12 _ 275 ) , des12a and des12b genes were higher at the early stages of exposure ( 6 hours , fig 4 ) while the expression of des6 ( des6a ; gan _ 06 _ 180 , des6b ; gan _ 11 _ 019 ) and des15 ( gan _ 06 _ 218 ) were higher at the later stages of exposure ( 48 hours , fig 4 ) .
during the early stages of exposure , this organism will express more of the des9 , des12a and des12b genes that encode enzymes that catalyze the introduction of one or two double bonds in the fatty acid chains to increase the fluidity of the membrane .
los and murata [ 49 ] proposed that living organisms will alter their membrane lipids by desaturating the fatty acid chains to maintain the fluidity of the biological membranes over a certain range of temperature .
however , after 48 hours of cold exposure , g. antarctica was found to express more of the des6 and des15 gene products .
the addition of another one double bond to the fatty acid chains will increase the fluidity of the membranes by changing its physical properties [ 50 ] .

the bars represent the standard errors calculated from three biological replicates of each experiment .
conclusions the g. antarctica genome sequence has revealed multiple systems that are either known psychrophilic responses or , with the current knowledge available , appears to be present only in g. antarctica .
targeted gene expression experiments and assays further reveal that the presence of variable psychrophilic responses can be associated to time and temperature variations although the exact mechanisms for these relationships remain unclear .
the temperature and time specific responses implies potentially different mechanisms may exist as response systems to the types of different sea ice structures that the organism may encounter in line with variations in temperature as a result of winter - summer transitions , temperature shifts in the ocean and variations in salinity .
shifts of expression profiles over time may be associated to the need to interact with different ice structures in the case for the gaafps ; while for the fads , the variations in expression may turn out to be a wear and tear avoidance and resource management mechanism required for sustained periods of cold stress such as the antarctic sea ice habitat of this yeast .

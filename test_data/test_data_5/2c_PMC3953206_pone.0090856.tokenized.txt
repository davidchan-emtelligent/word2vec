background hiv protease inhibitor ( pi ) , the core component of highly active antiretroviral treatment ( haart ) for hiv infection , has been implicated in haart - associated cardiovascular complications .
our previous studies have demonstrated that activation of endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress is linked to hiv pi - induced inflammation and foam cell formation in macrophages .
raltegravir is a first - in - its - class hiv integrase inhibitor , the newest class of anti - hiv agents .
we have recently reported that raltegravir has less hepatic toxicity and could prevent hiv pi - induced dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by inhibiting er stress .
however , little information is available as to whether raltegravir would also prevent hiv pi - induced inflammatory response and foam cell formation in macrophages .
methodology and principal findings in this study , we examined the effect of raltegravir on er stress activation and lipid accumulation in cultured mouse macrophages ( j774a.1 ) , primary mouse macrophages , and human thp - 1 - derived macrophages , and further determined whether the combination of raltegravir with existing hiv pis would potentially exacerbate or prevent the previously observed activation of inflammatory response and foam cell formation .
the results indicated that raltegravir did not induce er stress and inflammatory response in macrophages .
even more interestingly , hiv pi - induced er stress , oxidative stress , inflammatory response and foam cell formation were significantly reduced by raltegravir .
high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) analysis further demonstrated that raltegravir did not affect the uptake of hiv pis in macrophages .
conclusion and significance raltegravir could prevent hiv pi - induced inflammatory response and foam cell formation by inhibiting er stress .
these results suggest that incorporation of this hiv integrase inhibitor may reduce the cardiovascular complications associated with current haart .

introduction the development of hiv protease inhibitors ( hiv pis ) is one of the most significant advances of the past two decades in controlling hiv infection .
incorporation of hiv pis in haart has had a profound impact on the natural history of hiv and aids .
however , in the era of haart , drug - induced metabolic toxicity has emerged as an important complication of combination antiretroviral therapy , particularly of those regimens containing hiv pis [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
hiv pi - induced dyslipidemia and inflammation are two major risk factors of cardiovascular complications in hiv patients under haart .
previous studies from other laboratories and ours suggest that hiv pi - induced endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress response and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response ( upr ) represent an important cellular signaling mechanism of hiv pi - induced metabolic syndromes ( dyslipidemia , insulin - resistance , lipodystrophy / lipoatrophy ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] - [ 9 ] .
er stress has been closely linked to various human diseases including inflammatory diseases , cardiovascular diseases , diabetes , and all types of human liver diseases [ 10 ] .
our previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that most hiv pis not only induce the accumulation of intracellular free cholesterol and lipid and activate the upr in hepatocytes and macrophages , but they also increase the release of inflammatory cytokines , promote foam cell formation and induce cell apoptosis in macrophages [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
hiv integrase inhibitor is a new class of antiviral agents used to treat hiv - 1 - infected patients .
raltegravir ( also known as mk0518 , isentress ) is a first - in - its - class oral integrase inhibitor and has demonstrated potent efficacy against multidrug - resistant hiv - 1 and was initially approved by the fda in 2007 to treat treatment - experienced hiv - 1 - infected patients [ 11 ] .
recently , raltegravir in combination treatment was listed as one of the preferred regimens recommended for treatment - naive hiv - 1 - infected patients .
clinical studies have shown that raltegravir was well - tolerated and had fewer side effects compared to other classes of antiretroviral drugs , such as hiv pis and reverse transcriptase inhibitors [ 12 ] - [ 14 ] .
our recent study demonstrated that raltegravir is able to prevent hiv pi - induced dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by inhibiting the er stress response [ 15 ] .
however , little information is available as to whether raltegravir would have a similar protective effect against hiv pi - induced inflammatory response and dysregulation of lipid metabolism in macrophages .
the current study was aimed at examining the effect of raltegravir on hiv pi - induced inflammatory response , foam cell formation and dysregulation of lipid metabolism in macrophages , and further determining whether the combination of this integrase inhibitor with existing , most commonly used hiv pis ( lopinavir and ritonavir ) could potentially prevent the previously observed development of inflammatory response and foam cell formation .

effect of raltegravir on hiv pi - induced upr activation and apoptosis our previous studies have shown that hiv pis induce er stress , activate the upr , and promote apoptosis in macrophages .
to determine whether raltegravir has a similar effect to hiv pis on er stress activation and induction of apoptosis in macrophages , we treated the j774a.1 cells and human thp - 1 - derived macrophages with raltegravir with or without ritonavir and lopinavir .

effect of raltegravir on hiv pi - induced foam cell formation in macrophages maintenance of the cellular lipid homeostasis is crucial to various cellular functions .
we have previously reported that hiv pis induce intracellular free cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation in macrophages [ 6 ] .
to determine if the protective effect of raltegravir on hiv pi - induced upr activation is correlated to its effect on lipid homeostasis , we examined the effect of hiv pis on lipid accumulation in mouse primary kupffer cells and peritoneal macrophages .
as shown in online supplementary fig. s1 , hiv pis increased intracellular lipid accumulation .
furthermore , our previous studies showed that hiv pis induced foam cell formation in human and mouse macrophages [ 6 ] .
we further examined whether raltegravir had any effect on lopinavir and ritonavir - induced foam formation in macrophages .
mouse j774a.1 cells were loaded with acetylated - ldl or oxidized - ldl and treated with hiv pis with or without raltegravir for 24 h. the intracellular lipid was stained using oil red o or nile red as described previously [ 6 ] , [ 18 ] .
as shown in fig. 5 , raltegravir did not promote lipid accumulation in the presence of modified ldl , but reduced hiv pi - induced increase of lipid accumulation .
similar results were obtained in human thp - 1 cells ( data not shown ) .
we further confirmed these observations in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages .
as shown in fig. 6 , raltegravir also reduced lopinavir / ritonavir - induced uptake of oxidized - ldl and lipid accumulation in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages .
our previous studies have shown that ritonavir not only promoted the foam cell formation , but it also increased the intracellular free cholesterol accumulation in mouse macrophages [ 6 ] .
in order to determine whether raltegravir has any effect on hiv pi - induced disruption of intracellular lipid homeostasis , we measured the intracellular free cholesterol , total cholesterol and triglyceride levels after the cells were treated with hiv pis with or without raltegravir .
as shown in fig. 7 , raltegravir significantly reduced lopinavir / ritonavir - induced increase of intracellular free cholesterol , total cholesterol and triglyceride in mouse j774a.1 macrophages .
similarly , lopinavir / ritonavir - induced increase of intracellular free cholesterol , total cholesterol and triglyceride was also inhibited by raltegravir in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages ( fig. 8 ) .

effect of raltegravir and hiv pis on the expression of key genes involved in regulation of lipid homeostasis in macrophages in order to identify the mechanisms by which raltegravir prevents hiv pi - induced lipid accumulation in macrophages , we first examined the effect of raltegravir and hiv pis on the expression of major surface receptors and transporters involved in lipid homeostasis including abca1 , abcg1 , cd36 , sra , and ldlr in macrophages using real - time rt - pcr .
as shown in fig. 9 , similar to our previous findings in mouse macrophages , hiv pis ( lopinavir / ritonavir ) significantly increased the expression of cd36 , sra and ldlr in human thp - 1 - derived macrophages , which was inhibited by raltegravir .
however , hiv pis and raltegravir had no significant effect on the expression of abca1 and abcg1 ( data not shown ) .

effect of raltegravir on hiv pi - induced depletion of er calcium stores in macrophages maintenance of er calcium homeostasis is essential for many cellular functions .
disruption of er calcium homeostasis is one of the major cellular mechanisms of the upr activation .
we have previously shown that hiv pi - induced er stress activation is closely linked to its effect on er calcium store depletion .
in order to further determine whether raltegravir exerts its protective effect against hiv pi - induced er stress through regulating er calcium homeostasis in macrophages , we assessed the effect of raltegravir on ritonavir - induced er calcium depletion in j774a.1 cells using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura - 2 / am as described previously [ 6 ] .
as shown in fig. 10 , raltegravir not only slightly increased the er calcium store by itself , but also prevented ritonavir - induced reduction of er calcium store .

effect of raltegravir on hiv pi - induced oxidative stress in j774a.1 cells numerous evidences indicate that er stress activation is associated with induction of oxidative stress .
we further examined the effect of raltegravir and hiv pis on reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production in j774a.1 cells by flow cytometry using c - h2 - dcfda as a fluorescent indicator .
as shown in fig. 11 , ritonavir significantly increased ros production , which was inhibited by raltegravir in a dose - dependent manner in macrophages .
in order to exclude the possibility of hiv pi - induced increase of intracellular fluorescence due to the increase of dye up - take , we further examined the effect of hiv pis and raltegravir on dye up - take using oxidized dcfda .
as shown in online supplementary fig. s2 , raltegravir had no effect on dye uptake , however , lopinavir / ritonavir significantly reduced dye up - take .
these results further suggest that hiv pis significantly increased cellular oxidative stress .

discussion hiv pis have been successfully used in haart for hiv infection , which is the most effective treatment currently available .
however , the benefit of haart is compromised by hiv pi - induced metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular complications [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] .
until now , the underlying mechanisms behind serious hiv pi - associated metabolic abnormality and atherosclerosis in hiv - infected patients remain to be fully determined .
therapeutic and preventive strategies have yielded only limited success so far .
our previous studies and studies from other groups suggest that hiv pi - induced er stress activation represents a critical cellular mechanism underlying hiv pi - induced inflammation , dyslipidemia , insulin resistance , and atherosclerosis [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
it is well recognized that macrophages play a pivotal role in regulating inflammatory response and lipid metabolism .
our recent studies indicated that raltegravir , the first agent in a new class of antiretrovirals , hiv integrase inhibitors , is not only less toxic , but also able to reduce hiv pi - induced dysregulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting the er stress response [ 15 ] .
based on the most recent guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in hiv - 1 - infected adults and adolescents released by the united states department of health and human services in february 2013 , raltegravir has been listed as a component of the preferred regimens recommended for treatment - naive hiv - 1 - infected patients .
clinical studies have shown that raltegravir is well - tolerated with fewer side effects when compared to hiv pis and reverse transcriptase inhibitors [ 21 ] .
in the present study , we examined the effects of raltegravir on hiv pi - induced activation of er stress , inflammation and dysregulation of lipid metabolism in cultured macrophages and mouse primary macrophages .
the results demonstrated that raltegravir has less toxicity and could prevent hiv pi - induced er stress activation , up - regulation of inflammatory cytokines , and foam cell formation ( figs. 4 - 6 ) .
the role of er stress is a rapidly emerging field of interest in the pathogenesis of various human diseases including liver diseases , metabolic syndromes , diabetes , inflammatory bowel diseases , and cardiovascular diseases [ 22 ] - [ 26 ] .
our previous studies demonstrated that activation of er stress also plays a critical role in hiv pi - induced disruption of intestinal barrier integrity [ 27 ] and dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism [ 5 ] .
our recent studies have indicated that raltegravir could prevent hiv pi - induced apoptosis and disruption of lipid metabolism by inhibiting er stress in rat primary hepatocytes and in liver [ 15 ] .
in this study , we further showed that raltegravir also inhibited hiv pi - induced er stress activation , apoptosis , and inflammatory response in macrophages .
the pathways of er stress activation and lipid metabolism are woven together tightly .
lipid overloading in macrophages is a prerequisite for foam cell formation , which leads to the development of atherosclerotic lesions .
accumulation of intracellular lipid results when lipid influx exceeds lipid degradation and export .
activation of er stress - mediated apoptosis will further increase the inflammatory response .
further analysis of the effect of raltegravir and hiv pis on the expression of major surface receptors responsible for lipid uptake in macrophages suggested that raltegravir inhibited hiv pi - induced foam cell formation mainly by down - regulating the expression of cd36 , sra and ldlr ( fig. 9 ) .
it has been shown that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and activation of an inflammatory response is involved in all stages of atherosclerotic development [ 28 ] .
we have previously shown that hiv pi - induced expression of inflammatory cytokines ( tnf - alpha and il - 6 ) is coupled to the upr and erk signaling pathways [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] .
in this study , we found that raltegravir not only inhibited hiv pi - induced upr activation , but also inhibited hiv pi - induced erk activation ( data not shown ) .
furthermore , raltegravir was able to reduce hiv pi - induced oxidative stress as indicated by reduction of ros production in macrophages ( fig. 11 ) .
activation of oxidative stress is closely associated with er stress activation and has been linked to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and other inflammatory diseases [ 29 ] - [ 31 ] .
we also showed that hiv pis induce ros production in cardiac myocytes [ 32 ] .
previous studies have shown that accumulation of intracellular free cholesterol induces er stress by depletion of er calcium store [ 33 ] .
our studies suggest that the raltegravir - mediated protective effect against hiv pi - induced dysregulation of lipid metabolism and activation of er stress may act through the stabilization of the er calcium content .
the inhibition of cd36 and sra expression may also prevent the uptake of modified lipids ( oxidized ldl and ac - ldl ) by macrophages .
recent studies also suggest that er stress and oxidative stress are also closely linked to autophagy , which has been recently identified as a key player in lipid metabolism [ 34 ]. whether hiv pis and raltegravir have any effect on autophagy activity remains to be further elucidated and is our current ongoing project .
in summary , the development of a hiv integrase inhibitor is a major step in the recent advance of anti - hiv therapy .
raltegravir not only increases the number of available agents to treat multidrug - resistant hiv infection with fewer side effects , but also provides a promising alternative in order to reduce the cardiovascular complications associated with commonly used anti - hiv agents .
our previous studies and the preliminary observations presented in this study suggest that hiv integrase inhibitors may be useful compounds not only for inhibiting multidrug - resistant hiv , but also for preventing hiv pi - associated metabolic complications .
our studies will provide important information for optimizing the combinational therapeutic regimen for hiv infection .

web - based computational chemistry education with charmming i : lessons and tutorial .
web - based computational chemistry education with charmming iii : reduction potentials of electron transfer proteins .
a lesson utilizing a coarse - grained ( cg ) g - like model has been implemented into the charmm interface and graphics ( charmming ) web portal ( www.charmming.org ) to the chemistry at harvard macromolecular mechanics ( charmm ) molecular simulation package .
while widely used to model various biophysical processes , such as protein folding and aggregation , cg models can also serve as an educational tool because they can provide qualitative descriptions of complex biophysical phenomena for a relatively cheap computational cost .
as a proof of concept , this lesson demonstrates the construction of a cg model of a small globular protein , its simulation via langevin dynamics , and the analysis of the resulting data .
this lesson makes connections between modern molecular simulation techniques and topics commonly presented in an advanced undergraduate lecture on physical chemistry .
it culminates in a straightforward analysis of a short dynamics trajectory of a small fast folding globular protein ; we briefly describe the thermodynamic properties that can be calculated from this analysis .
the assumptions inherent in the model and the data analysis are laid out in a clear , concise manner , and the techniques used are consistent with those employed by specialists in the field of cg modeling .
one of the major tasks in building the g - like model is determining the relative strength of the nonbonded interactions between coarse - grained sites .
new functionality has been added to charmming to facilitate this process .
the implementation of these features into charmming helps automate many of the tedious aspects of constructing a cg g model .
the cg model builder and its accompanying lesson should be a valuable tool to chemistry students , teachers , and modelers in the field .

introduction to function properly , most proteins must fold [ 1 ] .
determining the structure and understanding the mechanisms responsible for folding are active areas of biophysical research , as gleaning this information may provide critical insights towards fighting diseases that have been linked to protein structure , such as alzheimer 's [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
experimental determinations of protein structure are typically performed using x - ray diffraction of crystallized proteins or using nmr spectroscopy .
both techniques provide important information about a protein 's native folded structure , yet both methods are not without their drawbacks .
the process of crystallizing a protein is labor intensive , and structural information from a crystallized sample comes from a nonbiological environment .
nmr studies on an aqueous sample yield time - averaged results and are unable to resolve many important dynamic details .
considering the limitations of these techniques , computer simulations are an important tool to supplement and interpret information provided through direct experiment .
one way theoretical studies may lead to a better understanding of experimental results is by providing simple models with verifiable results .
computer models can be constructed at a variety of scales or resolutions ( figure 1 ) .
many simulation techniques represent each atom as a single interaction center .
the interactions between beads can then be evaluated using a force field .
however , it is possible to construct a coarse - grained ( cg ) model , in which multiple atoms are represented by a single center ( as in the right - hand panel of figure 1 ) .
these types of models can be useful theoretical tools because they can be specifically designed for a system or process of interest. by providing a simplified view of a complex molecular process , important physical details are retained in the model , while superfluous details are ignored .
the resulting cg model distills the essence of the biophysical process into its most important physical details , allowing the computational scientist a fundamental understanding of the process .

the success of cg models in representing a variety of biological phenomena is widely acknowledged .
starting from the earliest protein folding simulations [ 4 ] , to more recent studies on membranes [ 5 ] and transmembrane proteins [ 6 ] , cg models have been applied to diverse phenomena such as protein aggregation [ 7 ] , vesicle fusion [ 8 ] , protein structure refinement [ 9 ] , and the thermodynamics of rna folding [ 10 ] , among many other topics .
for a thorough discussion of the many diverse applications of cg models , please see the recent review literature [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
besides their simplification of complex biological phenomena , another attractive feature of cg models is their inexpensiveness relative to all - atom ( aa ) models .
the computational cost of performing a classical molecular mechanics simulation is typically dominated by the calculation of nonbonded forces ( electrostatic and van der waals interactions ) , as the number of interaction pairs is proportional to the square of the number of particles present in the model system .
for example , one of the most widely - used aa water models , tip3p [ 14 ] , represents a water molecule as three interaction sites. by comparison , the martini model [ 5 ] represents four water molecules using a single cg site , an effective reduction of 12 sites into one .
if a ten - to - one mapping is assumed for an entire cg model , the number of required nonbonded interactions to be computed is reduced by roughly two orders of magnitude .
one commonly used cg model is the g - like model [ 15 ] .
in this type of model , an aa crystal structure is used not only to build the coordinates and topology of the cg model ( as is the case with most cg models ) but also to build the parameters for the non - bonded interactions .
the assumption underlying the g model is that the native state below the melting temperature () is the global free energy minimum .
we know that the protein folds into a given crystal structure ; therefore , we assign parameters to always reproduce the experimentally known fold .
because we know the native state is stable , we know that native contacts are more stable than non - native contacts .
therefore we assign an attractive interaction potential to native contacts , and a short range repulsive interaction potential to non - native contacts .
while the g model is not based on first principles , nor is it transferable ( like the aa protein charmm force field ) [ 16 ] , these simulations reach equilibrium ( for small globular proteins ) , allowing for direct comparison between simulation and experiment [ 17 ] - [ 20 ] .
g - like models have been used to describe the kinetic features of protein folding [ 21 ] .
among the systems studied are the trp - cage fast folder [ 22 ] , the villin headpiece [ 23 ] , ribosomal protein s6 [ 24 ] , and c - src sh3 and ci2 [ 25 ] .
various physical insights have been gained from these studies ; however , the performance of a particular model depends upon how accurately it can reproduce aa kinetics .
some investigation of optimal parameters has been made [ 26 ] .
an accurate g - like model can provide these insights at a much smaller computational cost than its aa counterpart at the expense of transferability and fine - grained insights into structural behavior .
a consequence of coarse - graining the molecular model is the smoothing of the interaction potential .
this cg potential has two important implications : larger integration time step and accelerated dynamics .
in the reductive mapping process , many lighter particles are lumped together to form massive interaction centers ; this effectively integrates out the fastest moving degrees of freedom , allowing the usage of a longer integration time without incurring integration errors ( phantom heating ) .
for example , in aa simulations the hydrogen stretching motions occur at , dictating an integration time step of 1 or 2 fs. by removing this high - frequency motion , one may safely use a longer time step .
this allows a total dynamics simulation time one order of magnitude longer than that of an aa model over the same number of energy and force evaluations .
the smoother interaction potential also indirectly accelerates md by removing degrees of freedom , causing energetic barriers between conformations to disappear .
this effect can accelerate the rate of biophysical processes by another factor of two [ 12 ] .
taken together , these effects can facilitate the simulation of many biological processes , such as protein folding , that would be impossible to rapidly simulate using aa dynamics .
cg models are therefore very attractive in an educational environment , as they retain the qualitative features of their aa counterparts and can be performed cheaply and rapidly , leading to a far more interactive experience with the students .
in this lesson , we will use a g - like model in which each amino acid is mapped into two cg sites , one located at the alpha carbon () and one located at the side - chain center of mass ( sc ) .
many g - like models only provide for one interaction site per residue .
one such popular model has been developed by karanicolas and brooks [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
a web server that generates charmm input files for this model is available .
users are not able to perform test runs of their models through the server itself , and there are no interactive lessons , making it less comprehensive than the current charmming implementation .
however , some tutorial materials are available from the multiscale modeling tools for structural biology ( mmtsb ) website [ 29 ] .
in the remainder of this work we describe some of the details underlying both the bonded and non - bonded forces in the g model potential .
we also discuss the details of the dynamics simulations performed by charmming [ 30 ] ( www.charmming.org ) using the charmm simulation package [ 31 ] .
a procedure for extracting thermochemical values from the raw dynamic trajectories is also given .
we then outline step - by - step directions for setting up , performing , and analyzing the dynamics simulation using charmming .
this manuscript will give a basic description of the procedure suitable for undergraduate students .
new sections have been added to the charmm tutorial available at www.charmmtutorial.org with more in - depth descriptions of the methodology , and these are referenced within this work .
finally , we discuss the utility of this lesson both as an educational tool and as a research aid .
methods two cg protein models have been implemented into charmming [ 30 ] .
the one described in this manuscript is a two - site g model based on the work of klimov and thirumalai and described further in this section [ 18 ] .
the second model characterizes the chemical properties of residues and defines interactions accordingly .
for the g model , the bonded and nonbonded parameters are explicitly constructed to bias the protein towards the experimental crystal structure .
however , the inclusion of a sc particle serves to hinder the progress down the folding funnel and frustrate the folding process .
this creates a better balance between the folded and unfolded states than is typical in one - site g models such as the model of karanicolas and brooks referenced above , allowing for a more accurate description of folding thermodynamics .
further modifications to the standard g model allow the cg model to incorporate hydrogen bonding and secondary structure into the parameterization process .
the bonded and nonbonded force field terms of the two - site g model use the same functional form as those used in the aa charmm force field [ 16 ] .
however , the model must be re - parameterized to account for the fact that each amino acid is only represented by two cg beads .
this parameterization exploits the nontransferability of the model ; parameters are designed to reproduce the secondary and tertiary structure of the aa system .
the default parameters for the model are described in detail on charmmtutorial.org ; interested readers are encouraged to consult this page ( http :// charmmtutorial.org / index.php / coarse _ grained _ go _ models ) for more information and default values of these parameters .
those readers wishing to learn about the functional form of the charmm force field may visit http :// charmmtutorial.org / index.php / the _ energy _ function .
the bonded parameters for adjacent backbone atoms are modified based on the secondary structure ( as determined by the stride program [ 32 ]) of the aa model .
however , the bond strength is somewhat weaker than would be found between backbone atoms of an aa model since these " bonds " actually represent more flexible linkages between residues .
in addition , because the entirety of the backbone is represented by a single bead per amino acid , there is little to prevent 180 degree rotations of the side - chain that , in an aa representation , would correspond to a chiral flip .
this is a rare occurrence in nature because of the energy barrier involved , and therefore , the model adds a strong improper dihedral term to mimic this barrier .
all nonbonded interactions between sites on non - adjacent amino acids are described by a 12 - 6 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential .
there are no direct electrostatic components to the energy , however electrostatic effects are incorporated indirectly as will be discussed below .
the lj parameters used for sc particles depend on whether they form a native contact within the crystal structure , defined as occurring when their positions are within 4.5 a of one another .
the objective of any g - like model is to preserve such contacts while discouraging others .
so in this case the lj potential is attractive , with the minimum energy occurring when the sc beads are at the same distance as the sc centers of mass in the original crystal structure .
the strength of the attraction is determined by an experimentally derived contact potential , the most widely used of which was developed by miyazawa and jernigan [ 33 ] ( however , charmming supports other contact potentials as well ) .
this contact potential is how electrostatics are taken indirectly into account .
all other sc - sc interactions are modeled with a non - attractive lj potential , following the fundamental assumption of g - like models that the native structure is most stable .
all - and - sc interactions are also modeled non - attractively to account for volume exclusion , unless they take part in hydrogen bonding , in which case , the potential is slightly attractive .
this method of simulating hydrogen bonds has been shown to produce qualitatively correct results for cg water [ 5 ] .
one of the parameters of the klimov - thirumalai g - like model is the relative strength of the nonbonded versus the bonded interactions .
the motivation behind this parameter , as described in the supporting information of [ 20 ] , is that the strength of the native contacts must be scaled in order to provide a physiologically realistic melting temperature ; however , the scale factor ( nscale ) is not known a priori .
in the charmming implementation , the user may specify nscale or ask the interface to estimate it. our method of estimating nscale is to run temperature replica exchange [ 34 ] , which gives a boltzmann ensemble of the structure at a range of different temperatures. from these ensembles , a fraction of native contacts can be calculated , which can be used to plot a melting curve ( see below ) , allowing the melting temperature () to be estimated .
if is close to a physiological value for the system of interest , then nscale is considered correct .
otherwise , it is strengthened or weakened depending on whether is too low or too high .
a full discussion of temperature replica exchange is beyond the scope of this manuscript , but interested readers may consult http :// charmmtutorial.org / index.php / temperature _ replica _ exchange .
if a user asks charmming to determine nscale for them , the software takes an initial guess ( the default being 1 , no scaling ) , runs a brief temperature replica exchange simulation , and adjusts nscale upwards or downwards based on the calculated from that simulation .
the process is repeated until an nscale is found that yields a physiological . electrostatic interactions are not explicitly present in this model ( they are accounted for implicitly through the lj potential ) ; commonly used implicit solvent schemes ( e.g. , generalized born ) are fundamentally incompatible with this implementation of the g model .
solvation effects are incorporated into this model via langevin dynamics ( ld ) [ 35 ] .
both friction and knocking effects are approximately accounted for in this manner .
charmming allows the user to specify a collision frequency ( damping coefficient ) , but is employed in our lesson so as not to inhibit conformational transitions .
the parameter files produced by charmming set nonbonded cutoffs to 23 a , with the standard charmm switching function operating beyond 18 a [ 36 ] .
data analysis when analyzing trajectory data , an important consideration is the choice of reaction coordinate employed in data analysis .
as illustrated in table 1 , the choice of reaction coordinate can have an uncomfortably large effect upon the computed properties of the simulation .
the choice of a reaction coordinate is very complex and depends heavily on what scientific questions are being asked about the system under study .
users are encouraged to consult the literature broadly when choosing a reaction coordinate for a new system .
in this lesson , we will consider the fraction of native contacts ( q ) , a reaction coordinate which has been shown to be robust [ 37 ] .
this reaction coordinate is often used when mapping the thermodynamic landscape of various folding pathways of a protein .
when , a protein is considered folded ; when , a protein is considered unfolded .
the of a protein occurs when it is equally likely to be folded as unfolded .
figure 2 shows an example trajectory of a protein below its melting point. from the relative frequencies of folded versus unfolded structures , we can calculate . furthermore , by considering how changes with respect to temperature , we can plot a melting curve and apply the gibbs - helmholtz equation to determine the protein 's heat capacity () and enthalpy of fusion () ( see equation below ) .
figure 3 gives an illustrative example of a computed melting curve .

the fraction of native contacts are plotted as a function of time. by inspecting the histogram at the right , we observe that this trajectory was simulated below , as the protein is folded for 62 % of the simulation .

all results computed using . the coarse - grained lesson in this lesson , we consider the protein g related albumin - binding domain ( pdb code : 1prb ) .
this is a small globular protein that has been extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically [ 37 ] - [ 39 ] .
experiment has shown that this protein folds near the semi - empirical speed limit of [ 40 ] .
in solution , 1prb forms a three - helix bundle ( figure 1 ) ; it readily interconverts between its folded and unfolded states , allowing rapid convergence of its thermodynamic properties .
these features , taken together , make it an ideal candidate to demonstrate the efficacy of cg methodologies in an educational environment .
the sequence of steps that are carried out by the lesson , along with their inputs and outputs , are shown in figure 4 .

blue boxes represent the steps described in the text .
yellow boxes show the inputs and outputs of each step .
note that the charmm protein structure file is only built when a calculation is performed ( minimization , in this case ) .
q is the fraction of native contacts as defined in the text .
steps 1 and 2 : upload a protein to charmming and build the cg structure first charmming must be directed to obtain an aa crystal structure for our protein of interest .
the user must navigate to the " submit structure " page from the main menu .
he or she selects " retrieve a pdb using a pdb id " , and enters the pdb code " 1prb " into the text box .
for " what lesson is this structure associated with ?" , " lesson 5 " should be selected from the drop - down menu .
the user then submits the structure .
charmming will now redirect to the page entitled " build / select working structure. " on the " build / select working structure " page , an arbitrary name may be provided at the user 's discretion to label the working structure .
next , the user must select what type of structure charmming should build , select the radio button next to " a klimov - thirumalai style g model " and indicate that the " a - pro " segment should be used to build the model by selecting the appropriate box .
these options tell charmming to construct a g model with the appropriate cg topology , representing 1prb .
also on this page , the user must tell charmming how to generate parameters for the model system .
we will use the miyazawa - jernigan statistical potential as the basis for generating the strengths of the native contact interactions .
under the " contact types " heading , the " mj " radio button should be selected .
next , the nscale parameter must be assigned ; for 1prb the optimal value is 0.91 .
it is important to note that the user would normally need to tune this value manually , as described above .
the user can leave all other parameters at their default values and click " submit. " step 3 : light minimization although the native crystal structure is determined to be at the free - energy minimum , we still ask the user to do a short energy minimization .
this serves two purposes : firstly , it removes any minor issues with the geometry of the constructed structure , such as suboptimal non - native contacts or imperfect secondary structure , and secondly , it allows the user to verify that the model has been successfully built .
in order to accomplish this , the user must go to the " minimization " page and request ten steps of steepest descent minimization and 100 steps of adopted basis newton - raphson minimization .
the process of minimization is described more extensively in the first article of this series and on charmmtutorial.org .
because a coarse - grained model has no high frequency motions , shake , an algorithm used to constrain rapid bond and angle vibration [ 41 ] , may be turned off .
step 4 : run the langevin dynamics simulation once minimization is done , the user must go to the " langevin dynamics " page .
as described above , langevin dynamics mimics the frictional effects of solvent .
charmming is limited to 1,000 steps of dynamics , as described in the first article of this series .
however , users have the option of downloading all generated inputs and running them locally , assuming that they have a charmm license .
when submitting the langevin dynamics calculation , the user is instructed to set the " fbeta " value to five .
this controls the simulated collision frequency used in the dynamics , which simulates the jostling effects of solvent and also serves to couple the system to a heat bath ( in charmming , this is always set at 300 k ) .
charmming uses a 1 fs time step for all dynamics calculations ; for a production run this may be increased for the reasons given above .
step 5 : perform data analysis one of the most reliable metrics for gauging whether a protein is in a folded or unfolded state is the fraction of native contacts that are present ( q - - see above for details ) .
we have developed a native contacts calculator for g models in charmming , and as the final step of the lesson , the user must use it to see how the fraction changes .
because the simulation is so short , native contacts are unlikely to change much , if at all ; however , this is still a useful exercise since the same analysis can be applied to production simulations .
the user is directed to visit the " kt - go native contacts " page .
once he or she navigates to it , a table showing q every 50 steps is displayed immediately ; in the present version , no form needs to be filled in and submitted .
at this point , all calculations for the lesson have been completed , and the user should have gained a very basic understanding of the methods and results .
discussion and conclusion cg models are widely used in the study of biophysics because of their ability to efficiently simulate biomolecules and qualitatively test hypotheses .
the same attributes that make them suitable as research tools ( their speed and their qualitative nature ) also make them suitable as an education tool .
while building and running cg models in simulation software previously required the expertise of a specialist in the field , this is no longer true , as the charmming web portal to charmm now automates many of the tasks required to build a g model , allowing this class of cg models to be used in the classroom .
cg g models and other reduced lattice models also have tremendous applications for research into the folding of small globular proteins , as they can correctly predict their thermodynamic properties [ 37 ] , qualitative folding pathways [ 42 ] , and ensembles of partially folded structures in the presence of various denaturing agents such as heat and chemicals [ 20 ] .
the current work allows for the automation of the tedious process of parameter generation and model building for g models .
analogous tools for aa simulation have proven very valuable to the modeling community [ 43 ] .

keloid disease ( kd ) is an abnormal cutaneous fibroproliferative disorder of unknown aetiopathogenesis .
keloid fibroblasts ( kf ) are implicated as mediators of elevated extracellular matrix deposition .
aberrant secretory behaviour by kf relative to normal skin fibroblasts ( nf ) may influence the disease state .
to date , no previous reports exist on the ability of site - specific kf to induce fibrotic - like phenotypic changes in nf or normal scar fibroblasts ( ns ) by paracrine mechanisms .
therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of conditioned media from site - specific kf on the cellular and molecular behaviour of both nf and ns enabled by paracrine mechanisms .
conditioned media was collected from cultured primary fibroblasts during a proliferative log phase of growth including : nf , ns , peri - lesional keloid fibroblasts ( pkf ) and intra - lesional keloid fibroblasts ( ikf ) .
conditioned media was used to grow nf , ns , pkf and ikf cells over 240 hrs .
cellular behavior was monitored through real time cell analysis ( rtca ) , proliferation rates and migration in a scratch wound assay .
fibrosis - associated marker expression was determined at both protein and gene level .
pkf conditioned media treatment of both nf and ns elicited enhanced cell proliferation , spreading and viability as measured in real time over 240 hrs versus control conditioned media .
following pkf and ikf media treatments up to 240 hrs , both nf and ns showed significantly elevated proliferation rates ( p < 0.03 ) and migration in a scratch wound assay ( p < 0.04 ) .
concomitant up - regulation of collagen i , fibronectin , alpha - sma , pai - 1 , tgf - beta and ctgf ( p < 0.03 ) protein expression were also observed .
corresponding qrt - pcr analysis supported these findings ( p < 0.03 ) .
in all cases , conditioned media from growing marginal pkf elicited the strongest effects .
in conclusion , primary nf and ns cells treated with pkf or ikf conditioned media exhibit enhanced expression of fibrosis - associated molecular markers and increased cellular activity as a result of keloid fibroblast - derived paracrine factors .

introduction keloid disease ( kd ) is a complex fibroproliferative disorder of the skin characterised by formation of raised dermal lesions following an abnormal wound healing response [ 1 ] .
the aetiopathogenesis of kd has yet to be elucidated , although both environmental and genetic risk factors have been implicated [ 2 ] .
histopathologically , kd scars are characterised by rich vasculature [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , a thickened epidermis and a high mesenchymal cell density [ 5 ] .
these features are accompanied by thick compact hyalinised collagen fibres [ 6 ] forming whirl - like nodular structures in the reticular dermis [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
this irregular collagen distribution forms the basis for the dense ecm meshwork within the kd lesion [ 5 ] and is distinct from normal skin , in which collagen bundles appear parallel to the epidermis [ 9 ] .
the main inductive cells for kd are thought to be keloid fibroblasts ( kf ) , which initially show a marked infiltration in lesion tissue and subsequently mediate elevated pro - collagen i / iii expression [ 10 ] .
however , the exact mechanisms by which kf potentiate keloid scar formation and invasion , remain to be fully characterised .
it is possible that kf contribute to disease pathogenesis by possessing genetic or epigenetic variations [ 11 ] , potentiating abnormal secretory and / or responsive behaviour to cues in the lesional micro - environment [ 12 ] , . indeed , elevated cytokine production has been detected in kf conditioned media compared to normal dermal fibroblasts ( nf ) from non co - culture conditions [ 14 ] .
aberrant kf behaviour may also be augmented through kd mesenchymal - epithelial interactions , inducing changes such as increased collagen production [ 15 ] , connective tissue growth factor ( ctgf ) expression [ 16 ] and contraction of fibroblast - populated collagen gels [ 17 ] .
paracrine support from normal connective tissue fibroblasts during healthy cutaneous wound healing is thought saliant for efficient re - epithelialization of deeper dermal defects , where the supporting growth factor incentive is absent [ 18 ] .
in these healthy individuals , subsequent re - epithelialisation is deemed necessary to counteract excessive / fibrotic scar formation [ 19 ] .
any changes to the overall complement of growth factors , chemokines or cytokines in the wound micro - environment , either from kf inherently or as a result of epithelial - mesenchymal influence , may thus contribute towards aberrant physiological repair processes as occur in kd. transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - beta is a key cytokine involved in the initiation and termination of tissue repair , whose sustained production underlies development of tissue fibrosis and whose expression is thought to be up - regulated in kf [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
the chemotactic activity of vascular endothelial cells is strongly induced by kf conditioned media , resulting from endogenous tgfbeta - mediated up - regulation of fibroblast vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) [ 20 ] .
additionally , exogenous tgfbeta may stimulate significantly higher collagen i expression in kf versus normal skin fibroblasts [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] and work synergistically with insulin - like growth factor ( igf ) - 1 to induce markedly higher expression of collagen i , fibronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor ( pai ) - 1 [ 23 ] .
these results indicate that kf , in addition to producing more tgfbeta , may respond inappropriately to its production through autocrine and / or paracrine mechanisms and that ultimately , multiple secreted factors may influence a fibrotic phenotype .
the locality of kf within the lesion is also known to be intricately linked to the extent of collagen i / iii synthesis , with kf cultured from the peri - lesional ( growing margin ) area producing more collagen i and iii in vitro compared to those cultured from intra - lesional ( reticular dermis of scar ) or extra - lesional ( surrounding normal skin ) sites [ 1 ] .
also , observations indicate the fibrotic marker connective tissue growth factor ( ctgf ) is more concentrated in kf at the expanding invasive border of the kd scar [ 24 ] .
indeed , array profiling of kf have also shown differential region - specific gene expression patterns [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
these results collectively suggest that the site of the scar from which kf are specifically isolated may dictate or influence a certain type of cellular behaviour .
we hereby hypothesise that aberrant or enhanced secretory activity may occur in site - specific kf compared with healthy nf and normal scar fibroblasts ( ns ) .
furthermore , these paracrine effects may influence expression of fibrosis - associated markers in both nf and ns cells .
the objective of our study was to therefore investigate the influence of conditioned media from site - specific kf , i.e. from the invasive margin ( peri - lesional keloid fibroblasts ) or central reticular dermis of the scar ( intra - lesional keloid fibroblasts ) , on the cellular and molecular behaviour of both nf and ns as mediated through paracrine mechanisms .
materials and methods patients and tissue samples keloid tissues were harvested at the time of surgery from patients confirmed to have clinical and pathological evidence of keloid , were ethically consented ( ethical approval was obtained from nhs ethical committee , manchester , uk ) .
all cases recruited gave full verbal and written consent to take part in the study ( ethical reference number 11 / nw / 0638 ) .
following surgical excision , kd biopsy tissue was sectioned into two specific lesional sites : peri - lesional from the growing margin of the scar adjoining the normal non - affected skin ( n = 5 ) and intra - lesional from the reticular dermal centre of the scar ( n = 5 ) .
normal skin biopsies ( n = 4 ) were obtained adjacent to a normal scar during scar revision surgery .
normal scar biopsies ( n = 4 ) were defined as a flat scar in an individual with no previous personal or family history of hypertrophic or keloid scarring .
both normal skin and normal scars were used as controls in our study ( table 1 and figure 1a ) .
patient recruitment was determined using stringent diagnostic criteria with each kd scar confirmed histologically ( figure 1b ) , limiting any confounding effects of disease heterogeneity or misdiagnosis .
kd scars were defined as tumour - like lesions that extended beyond the margin of the initial underlying wound , continued to grow over time without spontaneous regression , commonly recurred following excision and were present for a minimum of one year .
complete clinical records including detailed data on scar history were obtained ( including cause , symptoms , past medical history , duration of scar and previous scar treatment ) .

briefly , biopsies were washed 3 times in 1x phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) ( paa , germany ) and incubated in dispase ii , 10 mg / ml ( roche , uk ) for 3 hrs at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 humidified atmosphere .
the epidermis and subdermal fat were removed and the remaining dermis dissected and incubated in 0.5 mg / ml collagenase i ( roche , uk ) for 4 hrs at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 .
cells were then centrifuged , pelleted and re - suspended in complete dmem ( containing 2 mmol / l l - glutamine ( paa , germany ) , 100 u / ml penicillin and 100 u / ml streptomycin ( paa , germany ) , 1 % non - essential amino acids ( sigma - aldrich , uk ) and 250 microg / ml amphotericin - b ( sigma - aldrich , uk )) with 10 % heat - inactivated foetal calf serum ( fcs ) ( sigma - aldrich , uk ) .
the entire re - suspended cell pellet , with residual tissue explants , was transferred into t25 cellbind flasks ( nunc , life technologies ltd. , germany ) and monolayer cultures subsequently established at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 .
haematoxylin and eosin staining keloid site - specific scar samples were fixed in formaldehyde , embedded in paraffin blocks and sectioned to 5 microm thicknesses .
the sections were then stained with haematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) ( surgipath , peterborough , u.k. ) for histological evaluation using standardised protocols established in the lab as described previously [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
micrographs were taken at 200 magnification using olympus microscopy ( bx51 , olympus , uk ) .
collection of conditioned media from primary fibroblast cultures once confluent peri - lesional keloid fibroblasts ( pkf ) , intra - lesional keloid fibroblasts ( ikf ) , normal dermal fibroblasts ( nf ) and normal scar tissue fibroblasts ( ns ) were established as monolayer cultures ( n = 16 ) , passaging of cells into t75 flasks ( nunc , life technologies ltd. , germany ) facilitated collection of conditioned media every ~ 60 hrs when each cell type was in a proliferative log phase of growth .
collection was started at 30 % confluency , ~ 1.0e4 cells , when cells were actively dividing and having formed lamellipodial and filopodial projections .
after each media collection , cells were washed in 1xpbs and 20 ml new complete dmem was placed onto cells .
the conditioned media was then collected corresponding to approx. 50 , 70 and 90 % confluency levels ( figure 2 ) .
collection periods were ~ 60 hrs apart depending on cell type .
pkf and ikf cells were not used beyond passage 3 in order to retain kd - like properties [ 1 ] .
conditioned media was stored at - 80degreesc until required , then thawed overnight ( 4degreesc ) and subsequently filtered through a 0.2 microm membrane ( appletonwoods , uk ) .
each sample collection time - point was amalgamated prior to use ( e.g. patient 1 pkf media representing 30 - 50 % , 50 - 70 % and 70 - 90 % confluency states were combined ) .

conditioned media was collected every ~ 60 hrs when pkf ( n = 5 ) , ikf ( n = 5 ) , nf ( n = 4 ) and ns ( n = 4 ) were in proliferative log phase of growth .
for each individual primary cell culture , conditioned media was collected at ~ 50 % , 70 % and 90 % confluency states and subsequently amalgamated prior to treatment of cells .
pkf = peri - lesional keloid fibroblasts , ikf = intra - lesional keloid fibroblasts , nf = normal skin fibroblasts , ns = normal dermal scar fibroblasts .
treatment of target primary fibroblasts with conditioned media pkf , ikf , nf and ns fibroblasts were grown in monolayers to confluency in t75 flasks .
cells were trypsinised ( paa , uk ) , re - suspended in 10 % fcs complete dmem and counted using the scepter 2.0 automated counter ( millipore , uk ) .
1.0e4 cells / well were seeded into 96 - well plates ( corning , uk ) or 3.0x104 cells / well in 24 - well plates ( corning , uk ) in triplicates and allowed to attach to the well surface .
cell - synchronisation was performed by starving cells in complete 0.2 % serum dmem for 24 hrs .
cells were washed once with 1x pbs and then conditioned media gently added ( 150 microl / well in 96 - well plate or 500 ul / well 24 - well plate ) .
plates were incubated at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 .
all media types were replaced with corresponding fresh conditioned media after consecutive 60 hrs periods , following a single 1x pbs wash .
end - point assays were performed on cells after 120 hrs or 240 hrs of replenishing conditioned media treatments ( figure 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0075600.g003 figure 3 schematic timeline for treatment of primary culture cells with conditioned media .
nf ( n = 4 ) , ns ( n = 4 ) , pkf ( n = 5 ) , and ikf ( n = 5 ) were independently treated with all the different conditioned media types ( n = 16 ) following 24 hrs cell synchronisation .
conditioned media was continually replaced every 60 hrs up to a final treatment period of 240 hrs .
rtca on a micro - sensory array was undertaken for the complete 240 hrs whereas end - point assays were conducted at either 120 hrs or 240 hrs .
pkf = peri - lesional keloid fibroblasts , ikf = intra - lesional keloid fibroblasts , nf = normal dermal fibroblasts , ns = normal dermal scar fibroblasts , rtca = real time cell analysis .
label free real - time cell analysis : rtca ( cell attachment , proliferation , spreading ) the rtca system monitors change in electrode impedance caused by the interaction between testing cells and electrodes .
electronic impedance is primarily determined by the ion environment both at the electrode / solution interface and in the bulk solution .
when an electric field is applied , ions undergo field directed movement leading to frequency dependent impedance dispersion .
the presence of cells affects the local ionic environment leading to an increase in the electrode impedance [ 29 ] .
cell index ( ci ) is used to represent cell status based on the measured frequency - dependent electrical impedance .
ci maybe used as a global guide to cellular behaviour including attachment , proliferation and cell spreading .
initially , 50 microl complete dmem was added to each well of a 96 - well plate microelectronic sensory array ( mesa ) .
the plate was pre - incubated at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 to achieve temperature equilibration prior to cell seeding .
1.0x104 cells were added to the 96 - well mesa plate depending on the experimental plate design , with three cell types ( treated with different conditioned media ) assessed in each plate .
an xcelligence instrument ( roche , uk ) , housed within a 37degreesc / 5 % co2 incubator , was used to assess ci values every 15 min over ~ 7 - 8 hrs .
after initial cell attachment to the well surface , the plate was washed once with 1x pbs and 150 microl conditioned media added to the appropriate wells in triplicate and ci further assessed every 15 min .
after consecutive 60 hrs periods , corresponding fresh conditioned media was added to the cells following a single 1x pbs wash .
ci was measured on a continual basis ( every 15 min ) up to 240 hrs .
the protocol is well established for primary fibroblasts [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
wst - 1 ( cellular proliferation / viability ) wst - 1 proliferation assay ( roche diagnostics , uk ) was performed according to the manufactures instructions , following different conditioned media treatments on our panel of primary fibroblast cultures after 240 hrs treatments .
briefly , cells were washed in 1x pbs and 90 microl complete 10 % serum dmem ( non - conditioned ) was added along with 10 microl wst - 1 reagent .
plates were agitated gently and then incubated at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 for 4 hrs .
during this incubation period any viable cells converted the stable tetrazolium salt ( wst - 1 ) to a water soluble formazan dye , largely dependent on the bio - reduction of glycolysis produced nad ( p ) h , thus acting as a direct measure of cell number / viability .
absorbance was measured at 450 nm and 690 nm ( background ) using a polarstar omega instrument ( bmg labtech gmbh , germany ) .
in vitro scratch wound migration assay pkf , ikf , nf and ns were seeded uniformly ( 5.0x104 cells / well ) into 6 - well plates ( with each well containing a single cover - slip ) and grown for 240 hrs with conditioned media being replenished every ~ 60 hrs .
a wound scratch was made across the centre of each confluent cell culture using a sterile 200 microl pipette tip and any non - adherent cells were washed off with 1x pbs .
conditioned media was then reapplied to the cells according to the previous treatment regimen and the plates incubated for a further 30 hrs at 37degreesc / 5 % co2 .
cellular fixation was then achieved using 4 % formaldehyde / pbs ( sigma - aldrich , uk ) applied for 30 min at rt , followed by permeabilisation with pbs / 0.1 % triton x - 100 solution ( sigma - aldrich , uk ) .
the cells were then treated with 1:1000 diluted rhodamine phalloidin ( sigma - aldrich , uk ) and dapi ( sigma - aldrich , uk ) .
each well was photographed six times using objective inverted microscopy ( olympus , uk ) and the number of cells that migrated into the scratched area counted ( using a standardised scratch area for each image ) as described previously [ 30 ] .
in cell western blotting ( protein expression ) following 240 hrs continuous conditioned - media treatments in 96 - well plates , cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde ( sigma - aldrich , uk ) for 20 min at room temperature .
in - cell western blotting was carried out as described previously [ 1 ] , briefly , after cells were fixed , the 96 well plates were washed three times with pbs ( 150 microl per well ) , permeabilized with pbs / 0.1 % tritonx - 100 ( 150 microl per well , three times , 5 min each ) , and blocked in odyssey blocking buffer ( li - cor , cambridge , u.k . )
( 150 microl per well ) for 2 h at room temperature .
primary antibodies used in this study included collagen type i , fibronectin , alphasma , tgf - beta , ctgf and pai - 1 ( table 2 ) .
a mouse anti - alpha - tubulin primary antibody ( abcam , uk ) was also used to simultaneously stain each well as a measure of determining housekeeping protein expression .
all the primary antibodies incubation was carried out over night at 4degreesc .
all rabbit primary antibodies were stained with irdye800cw donkey anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( li - cor , uk ) and the mouse alpha - tubulin primary antibody was stained with anti - mouse irdye680lt igg .
after staining with both , primary and secondary antibodies , the plates were imaged on an odyssey infrared scanner ( li - cor , uk ) to measure protein expression readings at the respective wavelengths ( 800 nm for irdye800cw and 700 nm for irdye680lt ) ( table 3 ) .
expression of each protein marker was normalised to alpha - tubulin expression ( 800 nm / 700 nm ratio ) for each cell - media combination as described previously [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
data were acquired by using odyssey software , exported and analysed in excel ( microsoft , reading , u.k . )

dynamic responses in our panel of cells ( to different conditioned media ) were continuously monitored following 24 hrs cell synchronisation .
nf cells treated with pkf conditioned media ( figure 4a ) produced steady increases in ci from 60 - 240 hrs , indicating an enhanced nf cell spreading , proliferation and changes in cellular morphology ( versus both ikf and control nf media ) .
ikf media produced intermediate ci levels , below those for pkf but above nf media .
similar ci trends were observed for ns treated with pkf , ikf or control ns conditioned media ( figure 4b ) .
the highest overall ci was from pkf ( figure 4c ) followed by pkf , ikf and nf media treatments in which pkf media elicited consistently higher ci ( above both ikf and nf treatments ) for the duration of 240 hrs .

phalloidin staining of fibroblasts indicated cultures were confluent prior to scratching and both nf and ns cells orientated in parallel monolayers in contrast to both pkf and ikf cells , which formed whirl - like aggregates in a similar manner to the whirl - like nodular structures demonstrated in post - confluent cultures ( figure 7 ) .

discussion keloids scars are benign fibroproliferative dermal tumours of unknown origin that often occur following even the most minor form of trauma to the skin in genetically predisposed individuals [ 2 ] .
the aetiopathogenesis of kd remains ill - defined , although a balance between keloid fibroblast ( kf ) proliferation and apoptosis is thought to influence both the accumulation of ecm and lesional invasion into the surrounding skin [ 32 ] .
region - specific kf growth - behaviour and ecm metabolism have previously been observed , wherein reticular dermal kf display reduced doubling times and increased cell - densities versus superficial and basal regions [ 32 ] .
in our study , conditioned media from both marginal peri - lesional fibroblasts ( pkf ) and reticular dermal intra - lesional fibroblasts ( ikf ) elicited increased spreading and proliferation in both normal skin fibroblasts ( nf ) and normal scar fibroblasts ( ns ) , as measured in real time ( over 240 hrs ) compared to their own control media ( figure 4 ) .
a corresponding , statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) increase in cell proliferation and viability was elicited by pkf and ikf conditioned media at both 120 hrs and 240 hrs ( figure 5a , 5b ) with concomitantly enhanced cell migration in an in vitro scratch wound assay ( figure 6a , 6b ) .
collectively , these results indicate pkf and ikf conditioned media can modify the cellular behaviour of normal non - disease fibroblasts through secreted paracrine mechanisms .
also , proliferation rates in pkf and ikf cells treated with control ns and nf media were above corresponding levels for nf and ns cells ( figure 5c , 5d ) .
these levels were significantly increased upon pkf or ikf media treatment .
thus , secreted autocrine factors may well influence the shorter doubling times as previously reported for kf in vitro [ 21 ] .
we also observed pkf and ikf cells in long - term ( post - confluent ) in vitro culture , form a stratified - three dimensional structure , producing nodular aggregates mimicking the formation of keloid - like nodular tissue ( figure 7 ) .
these observations are consistent with previous reports [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
the whirl - like kf aggregates could also be induced within 24 hrs with exogenous 1 ng / ml tgfbeta - 1 ( figure 10a ) .
these effects were not observed in nf ( figure 10b ) indicating kf may have a dysregulated response to tgf - beta signalling and / or respond through different tgfbeta - mediated pathways [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
indeed , kf cells treated with exogenous tgfbeta - 1 are known to stimulate significantly higher collagen i expression compared to nf [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
in our study , treatment of nf and ns with pkf or ikf media elicited higher tgfbeta expression at both protein ( figure 8a , 8b ) and mrna ( figure 9 ) levels compared to control media .
this observation is consistent with a statistically significant ( p < 0.03 ) increase in downstream protein markers associated with tgfbeta - 1 - induction , including collagen i , fibronectin ( fn ) , alpha - smooth muscle actin - ( sma ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( pai ) - 1 , connective tissue growth factor ( ctgf ) and tgfbeta ( figure 8a , 8b ) .
active in situ expression of collagen i and vi genes have previously been identified in lesional areas containing abundant kf ( invading margin of the lesion ) along with co - ordinate tgfbeta mrna and protein co - localisation [ 36 ] .
in addition , it has been observed that pkf produce elevated levels of collagen i and iii compared to both ikf and extra - lesional fibroblasts in vitro [ 1 ] .
these results collectively suggest that ikf , and particularly marginal pkf , are likely to influence fibroblast behaviour through tgfbeta - mediated signalling .

blue = nuclei , green = alpha - sma protein , nf = normal dermal fibroblasts ( n = 4 ) , pkf = peri - lesional keloid fibroblasts ( n = 5 ) .
interestingly , a synergistic effect of tgfbeta and insulin - like growth factor ( igf ) - 1 co - stimulation is known to produce markedly higher kf expression of collagen i , fn and pai - 1 [ 23 ] .
affymetrix microarray studies also support the idea of several igf - binding and igf - related proteins being over - expressed in cultured kf [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
however , igf - 1 treatment alone has been shown to have no stimulatory effect upon kf , suggesting igf - 1 may enhance tgfbeta - induced kd scar formation through tgfbeta cross - talk .
in our study , the increased expression of collagen i , fn and pai - 1 from nf and ns cells ( treated with pkf or ikf media ) may be a tgfbeta - influenced effect although a synergistic role for pkf / ikf secreted igf - 1 would need to be experimentally confirmed .
paracrine signalling from kf may therefore involve a combination of secreted factors , acting in concert , rather than the effect of any one particular cytokine alone .
ctgf is a fibroblast - secreted , downstream effector of tgfbeta signalling [ 39 ] .
it is known to elicit fibroblast - specific mitogenesis , chemotaxis and ecm synthesis in vitro [ 40 ] .
gene array profiling has also indicated ctgf may be over - expressed in isolated kf treated with hydrocortisone [ 37 ] .
in our study , the induction of significantly increased ctgf expression ( p < 0.05 ) in nf and ns , by both pkf and ikf conditioned media ( figures 8a , 8b and 9 ) may account for the concomitant significant increase in cellular viability and proliferation versus normal conditioned media controls ( figure 5b ) .
observations of a stronger induction by pkf media above ikf media , although not statistically significant , complement reports of greater in situ concentrations of ctgf mrna in kf from the scar periphery compared with a more diffuse distribution in reticular dermal kf [ 24 ] .
thus , elevated ctgf induction by pkf , and to a lesser extent ikf , may influence the localized behaviour of lesional fibroblasts and thus may facilitate kd invasion into the surrounding healthy skin .
fn is an integral glycoprotein component of the wound ecm and functions as a scaffold for collagens , which collectively contribute to the ecm network facilitating cell proliferation and migration .
a relative steady - state increase in both intracellular and extracellular fn from kf in vitro was previously reported ( versus nf ) resulting from increased fn mrna levels [ 41 ] .
also , exogenous rh - ctgf was shown to up - regulate both fn mrna and protein ( intracellular and secreted ) in nf [ 42 ] .
this induction was blocked by the pan - specific protein kinase - c ( pkc ) inhibitor , gf109203x , indicating ctgf - induced fn up - regulation is likely to be mediated through pkc secondary signalling [ 42 ] .
indeed , ctgf - mediated increases in collagen production have also been observed in nf [ 43 ] .
we have shown treatment of both nf and ns , with pkf and ikf conditioned media , induced a statistically significant increase in the levels of both fn and collagen i expression at the protein ( figure 8a , 8b ) and mrna levels ( figure 9a , 9b ) .
this increased expression may be a direct consequence of pkf / ikf secreted paracrine factors and / or a concomitant increase in ctgf secretion from nf and ns fibroblasts also induced by both pkf and ikf conditioned media over 240 hrs ( figure 8a , 8b ) .
this effect may be exacerbated by the auto - inductive role of ctgf in stimulating its own up - regulation [ 42 ] , [ 44 ] .
in this scenario , secreted ctgf may increasingly stimulate higher endogenous ctgf expression , resulting in higher fn and collagen i accumulation in the ecm and , thus , maintenance of fibrosis .
tgfbeta is known to induce smad2 / 3 phosphorylation in kf promoting elevated pai - 1 mrna expression mediated through several mitogen - activated protein kinase pathways including p38 , erk and jnk [ 45 ] .
tgfbeta has also been shown to stimulate increased pai - 1 in cultured nf in vitro [ 46 ] .
in our study , pkf and ikf media both elicited increased pai - 1 in nf and ns at the protein ( figure 8a , 8b ) and mrna ( figure 9 ) levels , which may well result from corresponding increases in tgfbeta ( following the same treatment regimen ) or through paracrine tgfbeta from pkf / ikf .
both pkf and ikf cells produced higher endogenous pai - 1 than nf or ns when treated with keloid media , consistent with previous reports of elevated pai - 1 in kf [ 47 ] .
previous reports also indicate elevated pai - 1 is causally linked to elevated collagen synthesis in both nf and kf [ 48 ] , supporting our observations of increased pai - 1 and collagen i. aberrant pai - 1 in kd may thus contribute to fibrosis by enhanced suppression of the fibronolytic protease plasmin , mediated through inhibition of upa , thus reducing the extent of fibrinolysis within a lesion .
interleukin ( il ) - 6 is a cytokine whose expression is significantly higher in primary kf compared to nf [ 49 ] .
stimulation of nf with an il - 6 peptide is also known to produce a corresponding dose - dependent increase in collagen type i alpha2 and fn1 mrna [ 49 ] .
analysis of conditioned media from both nf and kf ( non - culture ) has previously indicated il - 6 to be the most abundant cytokine secreted by each cell type with the highest levels detected in kf [ 14 ] .
these results suggest that il - 6 may be an important factor for eliciting pkf / ikf - induced paracrine effects as observed on both nf and ns. il - 8 was previously identified as the second most abundant cytokine secreted by kf with a significant increase versus nf. additionally , two unique cytokines have been detected in conditioned media from kf which are absent from nf , namely hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) at day 5 and oncostatinm ( osm ) at day 1 [ 14 ] .
further examination of this panel of cytokines indicated exogenous il - 6 and osm elicited strong py705 and ps727 stat3 in both nf and kf , with osm being the stronger inducer [ 14 ] .
stat3 is an oncogene and a latent transcription factor activated in cultured kf in vitro and thought to have an important role in keloid pathogenesis by promoting collagen expression , fibro - proliferation and cell migration [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] .
inhibition of this stat3 expression / phosphorylation in kf has shown reduced collagen production , impaired proliferation and delayed cell migration [ 50 ] .
thus , activation of stat3 via chemokine , cytokine and / or growth factors secreted in pkf and ikf conditioned media may contribute to the fibrotic - like behaviour that we observe in nf and ns. additionally , it may further enhance the activity of pkf and ikf fibroblasts in vitro , accounting for the generalised increase in proliferation , ecm and growth factor production when treated with their own respective conditioned media .
our findings can be interpreted by postulating that keloid fibroblasts may be altered as a result of for example a mechanical injury or exhibiting epigenetic differences to normal fibroblasts that allow differential paracrine signalling to occur .
this may subsequently result in up - regulation of fibrotic markers that may influence increased ecm deposition in a self - sustaining manner .
at the margin of the keloid scar , these fibroblasts show strong paracrine signalling compared to normal skin fibroblasts which appear to result in upregulation of proteins such as ctgf , pai - 1 , alpha - sma .
ctgf is a known mitogenic stimulant [ 52 ] for fibroblasts and pai - 1 is also known to increase collagen deposition through inhibiting pa activity [ 48 ] .
in addition , ctgf may increase both collagen and fibronectin levels concomitantly .
pai - 1 may also influence cell migration by stimulating pa receptor and beta3 integrin cycling by endocytosis [ 53 ] .
increased alpha - sma may also influence cell tension and adhesion ( our unpublished data ) .
collectively , these changes may influence migration into the surrounding healthy skin of keloid fibroblasts at the margin of the lesion , which may lead to the recurrence of keloid scarring ( figure 11 ) .

dermis : reticular dermis. b. keloid fibroblasts may be changed , for example by mechanical injury itself or as a consequence of the healing process eg inflammation , and exhibit epigenetic differences to normal fibroblasts that allow paracrine signalling to occur .
this may result in upregulated fibrotic markers that influence increased collagen and fibronectin deposition in a self - sustaining manner. c. at the margins of the lesion , keloid fibroblasts influence ( paracrine signaling ) normal skin primary fibroblasts to upregulate fibrotic markers such as ctgf , pai - 1 , alpha - sma .
ctgf is known mitogenic for fibroblasts and pai - 1 is known to increase collagen deposition through inhibiting pa activity .
ctgf may increase both collagen and fibronectin concomitantly .
pai - 1 may also influence cell migration by stimulating pa receptor and beta3 integrin cycling by endocytosis .
alpha - sma may also influence cell tension and adhesion .
collectively these changes may influence migration into the surrounding healthy skin leading to high recurrence of keloid lesion , post - surgery .
in conclusion , primary nf and ns cells treated with pkf or ikf conditioned media exhibit enhanced expression of fibrosis - associated molecular markers and increased cellular activity as a result of keloid fibroblast - derived paracrine factors .
kf autocrine / paracrine factors , in addition to genetic and epigenetic differences in kf as well as paracrine effects from inflammatory cells ( and / or re - epithelialising keratinocytes ) are all likely to exacerbate the abnormal kf secretory and / or responsive phenotype , resulting in an exuberant fibroblastic response .
further definition of the exact nature of kf autocrine and paracrine interactions may provide a progressively clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying aberrant kf activity and provide new targets for future therapeutic interventions .

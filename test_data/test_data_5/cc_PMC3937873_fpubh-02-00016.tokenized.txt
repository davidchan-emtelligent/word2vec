dental fear is a widely experienced problem. through a " vicious cycle dynamic ," fear of dental treatment , lower use of dental services , and oral health diseases reinforce each other .
research on the antecedents of dental anxiety could help to break this cycle , providing useful knowledge to design effective community programs aimed at preventing dental fear and its oral health - related consequences .
in this regard , frameworks that analyze the interplay between cognitive and psychosocial determinants of fear , such as the cognitive vulnerability model , are promising .
the onset of dental fear often occurs in childhood , so focusing on the child population could greatly contribute to understanding dental fear mechanisms and prevent this problem extending into adulthood .
not only can public mental health contribute to population health , but also community dentistry programs can help to prevent dental fear .
regular dental visits seem to act in a prophylactic way , with dental professionals playing an important role in the regulation of the patients' anxiety - related responses .
both public mental health and community dentistry could therefore benefit from a multidisciplinary approach to dental fear and oral health .
dental anxiety oral health cognitive vulnerability model access to health services community dentistry mental disorders and subclinical psychological problems may influence physical health , acting as a barrier to seeking needed treatment .
conversely , physical conditions appear to increase the risk of suffering from mental illness ( 1 - 5 ) .
this " vicious cycle dynamic " has been also found in dental fear problems .
dental anxiety can block normal access to health services , which increases the risk of experiencing oral health diseases , and the progressive worsening of untreated oral symptoms can in turn reinforce the fear of dental procedures .
we argue that dental fear should be a matter of concern for public mental health , as this problem has a high prevalence in both adult and child populations and deleterious health - related consequences .
drawing from previous research , insights into the interplay between public mental health and community dentistry are provided. from our point of view , a multidisciplinary approach could be useful to prevent dental fear and promote oral health in child and adult populations , objectives which are connected to one another .
prevalence of dental fear and anxiety in child and adult populations figures for dental fear prevalence vary greatly .
while some studies have reported percentages of adults with dental fear ranging between about 5 and 7 % ( 6 , 7 ) , other surveys have reported considerably higher prevalence rates .
for example , 24.3 % of dutch adults were found to have dental fear ( 8 ) , 16.1 % of the australian population older than 5 years reported high levels of dental fear ( 9 ) , and rates of extreme dental fear varied between 6 and 14 % in a study carried out among japanese university students ( 10 ) .
the variation in prevalence rates across different studies could be a consequence of the diversity of measures of dental fear , methods , and study populations , but they could also reflect discrepancies in the criteria used to define dental fear and anxiety ( 8 , 11 ) .
one study reporting results from a representative sample of the australian adult population used the index of dental fear and anxiety , which allowed the calculation of several anxiety - related scores using differing diagnostic criteria .
according to this research , 0.9 % of surveyed people met dsm - iv criteria for a diagnosis of dental phobia , 2.2 % suffered dental phobia if the criteria referred to acknowledging one 's fear as excessive or irrational were omitted , and 4.9 % of respondents experienced a phobic disease with a dental component ( 12 ) .
spanish research using the same instrument found similar results in a convenience sample , with 1.7 % of participants meeting criteria for a dsm - iv diagnosis of specific dental phobia , 3.5 % meeting less restrictive criteria of dental phobia , and 5.2 % presenting phobia or disorder with a dental component ( 13 ) .
the prevalence of dental fear in children is even more difficult to establish precisely .
for instance , rantavuori found prevalence rates varying from 6 to 56 % depending on the study 's characteristics ( 14 ) .
klingberg and broberg , identified a narrower range , finding percentages of dentally fearful children ranging from 5.7 to 19.5 % , depending on child age , with an overall mean of 11.1 % ( 15 ) .
previous research has also frequently reported figures within this range .
for instance , high levels of dental fear have been found to be present in 7.6 % of french children aged 5 - 11 years ( 16 ) , 7.1 % of british children aged 13 - 14 years ( 17 ) , and 6.7 % of swedish children aged 4 - 11 years ( 18 ) .
a series of studies carried out in spain has reported percentages between 4.9 and 13.6 % in samples including participants aged from 7 through to 18 years ( 19 - 22 ) .
summarizing the existing literature , we currently lack a precise estimate of the percentage of people affected by dental fear and anxiety ; however , a relatively high percentage of child and adult populations apparently suffer from high dental anxiety .
the vicious cycle dynamics connecting dental anxiety and oral health diseases dental fear has been argued to represent a major barrier to the delivery of oral health services .
several researchers have identified the existence of " vicious cycle dynamics " ( 23 , 24 ) whereby dental fear is associated with a lower or more irregular frequency of dental visits ( 17 , 21 , 25 - 30 ) , resulting in a worsening oral health status ( 30 - 33 ) and the subsequent reinforcement of dental treatment - related anxiety .
as dentally anxious patients are reluctant to seek dental care , they rarely benefit from preventive actions provided by regular check - ups .
furthermore , current oral pathologies of low or medium severity frequently remain untreated .
in the absence of adequate dental treatment , oral symptoms will inevitably worsen , resulting in more severe oral health problems ( 30 - 33 ) , which often require more intensive , urgent , and expensive treatments .
many dentally fearful patients will only attend the dentist when dental care is unavoidable , due to experienced pain or the intensity of symptoms .
not surprisingly , patients with more severe oral pathologies are more likely to receive potentially aversive dental treatments , which would confirm the patients' anticipated negative expectations of dental visits and reinforce the avoidance pattern associated with dental anxiety ( 23 , 24 ) .
the " vicious cycle mechanism " can also be seen among children , with dental fear , attempts to escape from or avoid dental treatments , and poorer oral health status also associated in this population .
children with high dental anxiety have been found to visit the dentist less frequently ( 25 , 26 ) , and they also experience more untreated caries , worse periodontal condition , a higher number and probability of missing teeth , and greater need of oral rehabilitation ( 16 , 27 , 28 , 34 - 36 ) .
public mental health meets community dentistry public mental health can contribute significantly to population oral health .
as discussed , dental fear can act as a hindrance to dental care delivery , and this psychological problem can eventually turn into a health concern .
in particular , addressing dental fear problems in child populations seems a priority task , due not only to its emotional - and health - related consequences , but also because child dental fear is frequently the precursor to dental fear problems in adulthood .
locker et al. , for instance , found that approximately 50 % of dental fearful individuals indicated that their fear developed in childhood , whereas 27 and 23 % reported that their fear originated in adolescence and adulthood , respectively ( 37 ) .
more strikingly , berggren and meynert found that dental anxiety problems started in childhood for 85.3 % of adults attending a specialized community dental unit for dental fear treatment ( 31 ) .
research has shown that dental treatment - related cognitive elements , i.e. , thoughts , beliefs , assessments , and expectations about dental care delivery , constitute a major influence on dental fear ( 38 - 42 ) .
indeed , cognitive elements have been found to be the best predictors of a person 's level of dental fear as compared with other variables connected with this problem ( 43 ) .
the cognitive vulnerability model , in particular , has identified a cognitive schema , which comprises four inter - related assessments associated with dental fear ( 44 ) .
according to this framework , dentally fearful people assess dental events as potentially dangerous , uncontrollable , unpredictable , and disgusting .
overall , research conducted using this model has supported the idea of a cognitive vulnerability schema operating in dental fear in both adults ( 45 , 46 ) and children ( 29 , 47 ) , with cognitive vulnerability perceptions accounting for just under one - half of the variance in dental fear scores beyond that accounted for by demographic variables and aversive dental experiences ( 45 ) .
however , while negative thoughts about dental treatments are clearly a strong risk factor for both dental fear and poorer oral health , we still do not know the extent to which these cognitions are present in the population , and this remains a task for research in public mental health .
family - related variables also seem to play a role in both dental anxiety and fearful dental cognitions .
parental and child dental fear have been found to be consistently associated ( 48 ) .
children 's fearful cognitions are connected with those of their parents , and parents' cognitive vulnerability levels are significant predictors of children 's dental fear ( 46 ) .
public mental health programs are suggested to address the interplay between cognitive assessments and family - related issues , in order to reduce children 's levels of dental fear .
while community dentistry could benefit from public mental health involvement , population mental health , in relation to dental fear in particular , could be improved by dental professionals' work .
for instance , regular check - ups could help provide children with positive or neutral dental treatment - related experiences .
it is generally regarded that frequent attendance to the dentist fosters familiarity with dental procedures and helps to prevent future dental anxiety problems ( 41 , 49 , 50 ) , playing a prophylactic role concerning the development of dental fear and children .
challenges for dental fear research in a public health context previous research has shown that dental anxiety is not only a mental health issue but also a public health concern .
fear of dental treatment increases the likelihood of experiencing oral health problems as a result of irregular or delayed dental visiting , and severe oral symptoms may reinforce dental fear , as potentially disgusting or threatening interventions are anticipated .
as discussed above , dental phobia and subclinical dental fear - related problems are relatively common in the population .
however , more precise data on the prevalence of dental fear - related problems are required , which could help to identify groups at risk of experiencing this problem .
epidemiological studies should pay attention to both dental phobia and subclinical forms of this problem , otherwise relevant information will be missed ( 51 ) .
people with moderate / high levels of dental fear and anxiety , even if not meeting dsm - 5 criteria for a dental phobia diagnosis , can enter into the " vicious cycle " of dental fear and be reluctant to regularly visit the dentist .
breaking the vicious cycle of fear and anxiety requires a multidisciplinary approach , which involves both mental health and community dentistry professionals. from our point of view , research in this field faces two main challenges .
first , better knowledge of the antecedents of dental anxiety are needed in order to design effective community programs aimed at preventing dental fear and its oral health - related consequences .
in particular , the interplay between cognitive and psychosocial determinants of dental fear appears as a promising area of enquiry , as these factors could be targeted at a population level .
the cognitive vulnerability model , which focuses on dangerousness , uncontrollability , unpredictability , and disgustingness appraisals , offers a compelling framework to analyze these relationships ( 47 ) .
second , studies focused on children could help to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms involved in dental fear development , as this problem usually emerges in childhood and subsequently extends to adulthood .
in this regard , focusing on children 's dental anxiety could be a smart strategy to prevent adults' fear .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

inflammation of adipose tissue in obesity is associated with increased il - 1beta , il - 6 and tnf - alpha secretion and proposed to contribute to insulin resistance .
amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) regulates nutrient metabolism and is reported to have anti - inflammatory actions in adipose tissue , yet the mechanisms underlying this remain poorly characterised .
the effect of ampk activation on cytokine - stimulated proinflammatory signalling was therefore assessed in cultured adipocytes .
ampk activation inhibited il - 1beta - stimulated cxcl10 secretion , associated with reduced interleukin - 1 receptor associated kinase - 4 ( irak4 ) phosphorylation and downregulated mkk4 / jnk and ikk / ikappab / nfkappab signalling .
ampk activation inhibited tnf - alpha - stimulated ikk / ikappab / nfkappab signalling but had no effect on jnk phosphorylation .
the jak / stat3 pathway was also suppressed by ampk after il - 6 stimulation and during adipogenesis .
adipose tissue from ampkalpha1 - / - mice exhibited increased jnk and stat3 phosphorylation , supporting suppression of these distinct proinflammatory pathways by ampk in vivo .
the inhibition of multiple pro - inflammatory signalling pathways by ampk may underlie the reported beneficial effects of ampk activation in adipose tissue .

plasma concentrations of these pro - inflammatory cytokines have been reported to be elevated in obese individuals ( lee et al. , 2009 ) .
tnf - alpha and il - 1beta trigger pro - inflammatory effects via simultaneous activation of the nuclear factor kappa b ( nfkappab ) and multiple mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) intracellular signalling pathways .
il - 1beta binding leads to recruitment of adapter proteins that further recruit il - 1 receptor associated kinase ( irak ) family members , directly interacting with irak4 which autophosphorylates and activates the downstream kinases irak1 and irak2 .
irak activation further stimulates formation of a signalosome including tnf receptor - associated factor - 6 ( traf6 ) , tgfbeta - activated kinase - 1 ( tak1 ) and ikappab kinase ( ikk ) ( salt and palmer , 2012 ) .
tnf - alpha engages multiple complex ubiquitin - dependent processes that also stimulate tak1 and ikk ( salt and palmer , 2012 ) .
ikk stimulates the phosphorylation of inhibitor of nfkappab ( ikappabalpha ) , targeting ikappab for proteasomal degradation and thereby releasing active nfkappab dimers , with p65 - p50 heterodimers being the principal form activated by the canonical nfkappab pathway in response to tnf - alpha and il - 1beta ( cohen , 2014 , brenner et al. , 2015 , salt and palmer , 2012 ) .
the p65 - p50 heterodimers subsequently translocate into the nucleus to bind kappab - responsive elements in the promoters of target genes , including other pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines .
tnf - alpha and il - 1beta stimulate activation of pro - inflammatory mapks , such as the c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) pathway , in parallel with nfkappab activation ( cohen , 2014 , salt and palmer , 2012 ) .
in contrast , il - 6 elicits its effects via binding a membrane - bound il - 6 receptor complexed with the co - receptor gp130 ( classic signalling ) , or by binding a soluble il - 6 receptor ( sil - 6ralpha ) that binds to gp130 ( trans - signalling ) , stimulating janus kinase ( jak ) - mediated activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription - 3 ( stat3 ) transcription factor predominantly via phosphorylation of tyr705 ( salt and palmer , 2012 , qu et al. , 2014 ) .
the cytokine - stimulated nfkappab , jnk and jak / stat pathways culminate in the secretion of multiple pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , including monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ( mcp - 1 ) , which stimulates the activation and infiltration of macrophages ( cohen , 2014 , brenner et al. , 2015 ; salt and palmer , 2012 , qu et al. , 2014 ) .
in adipose tissue , macrophages undergo a shift in polarisation from an anti - inflammatory ' alternatively activated ' state , to a ' classically activated ' pro - inflammatory state , which has been reported to dominate in wat in obesity ( lumeng et al. , 2007 ) .
increased atp consumption and / or decreased atp synthesis , leads to an increase in adp : atp and amp : atp ratios that activate the heterotrimeric ser / thr protein kinase amp - activated protein kinase ( ampk ) ( salt and palmer , 2012 , bijland et al. , 2013 ) .
activated ampk phosphorylates target proteins that act to normalise atp concentrations by stimulating atp - generating pathways such as fatty acid oxidation , mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle glucose transport , whilst inhibiting atp - consuming anabolic pathways including protein translation , fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis ( salt and palmer , 2012 , bijland et al. , 2013 ) .
in adipose tissue , ampk suppresses adipogenesis , fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis ( bijland et al. , 2013 ) .
more recently , ampk has been reported to have anti - inflammatory actions independent of its metabolic effects , diminishing immune responses in a range of in vivo models of inflammation ( salt and palmer , 2012 ) .
although ampk - dependent inhibition of pro - inflammatory signalling has been reported in preadipocytes , macrophages and vascular cells ( jeong et al. , 2009 , sag et al. , 2008 , ewart et al. , 2008 , chen et al. , 2016 ) , all of which are present in significant quantities in intact adipose tissue , ampk - dependent suppression of pro - inflammatory signalling in adipocytes remains poorly characterised .
various ampk activators have been reported to reduce pro - inflammatory cytokine expression and nfkappab activation in adipose tissue from rodents ( jeong et al. , 2009 , sun et al. , 2014 ) and inhibit expression and secretion of pro - inflammatory cytokines in human subcutaneous wat cultured ex - vivo ( lihn et al. , 2004 , lihn et al. , 2008 ) .
importantly , however , these studies did not examine the effect of ampk activation in adipocytes themselves or demonstrate the ampk - dependence of the ampk activators used .
this is critical due to the non - specific nature of and ampk - independent effects reported for several widely - used ampk activators , including aicar , phenformin and metformin ( garcia - garcia et al. , 2010 , guigas et al. , 2006 ) .
three studies have reported inhibition of ikkbeta phosphorylation in cultured adipocytes or rodent adipose tissue by ampk activators in a manner sensitive to compound c , which has been used widely to imply ampk - dependence ( wang et al. , 2013 , zhao et al. , 2014 , chen et al. , 2016 ) .
compound c is a poorly - selective inhibitor of ampk , with many reported ampk - independent effects and inhibiting several protein kinases other than ampk with similar or greater potency ( salt and palmer , 2012 , bain et al. , 2007 ) .
indeed , compound c has been demonstrated to influence pro - inflammatory signalling independent of ampk ( kim et al. , 2011 ) .
as ampk is activated by several existing drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes , including metformin and thiazolidinediones ( bijland et al. , 2013 ) , there is a need to understand the actions of ampk activation in metabolic tissues .
therefore , given the proposed anti - inflammatory actions of ampk and dearth of information concerning the role of ampk in adipocyte pro - inflammatory signalling , we investigated the effect of ampk activation on pro - inflammatory signalling in response to il - 1beta , tnf - alpha and il - 6 , the principal cytokines associated with adipose tissue inflammation , in cultured adipocytes using the selective ampk activator a769662 , which directly binds and activates ampk heterotrimers containing the beta1 non - catalytic subunit ( scott et al. , 2008 ) .
we also examined basal pro - inflammatory signalling pathway status in adipose tissue lacking the ampkalpha1 catalytic subunit .

3 results stimulation of 3t3 - l1 adipocytes with 300 - 1000 mumol / l a769662 or 1 mmol / l aicar significantly stimulated ampk activity ( fig. 1a ) , such that 300 mumol / l was used for subsequent experiments .
the stimulatory effect of a769662 was observed after 30 min incubation ( fig. 1b ) to determine the effect of a769662 on chemokine secretion , 3t3 - l1delta1car adipocytes were stimulated with il - 1beta at a concentration previously reported to stimulate il - 13 expression in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes ( kwon et al. , 2014 ) and chemokine / cytokine secretion assessed using a murine chemokine multiplex bead immunoassay and luminex ( r ) 100 ( tm ) detection system. of the 20 cytokines and chemokines assayed , il - 1beta stimulation markedly increased secretion of the chemokines cxcl1 , cxcl10 and mcp - 1 .
there was no detectable secretion of gm - csf , ifn - gamma , il - 1alpha , il - 1beta , il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 6 , il - 10 , il - 12 , il - 13 , il - 17 , tnf - alpha , cxcl9 , bfgf or vegf in conditioned media from 3t3 - l1delta1car adipocytes under basal or il - 1beta - stimulated conditions .
intriguingly , a769662 abolished il - 1beta - stimulated secretion of cxcl10 , markedly reduced mcp - 1 secretion and modestly reduced il - 1beta - stimulated cxcl1 secretion ( fig. 1c - e ) .
furthermore , pre - incubation of human sw872 adipocytes with a769662 or the chemically - unrelated ampk activator aicar attenuated il - 1beta - stimulated cxcl10 mrna expression , at concentrations that activated ampk activity , as assessed by phosphorylation of the ampk substrate , acc ( fig. 2 ) .
cxcl10 , cxcl1 and mcp1 expression are stimulated by the transcription factor nfkappab and / or the ap - i transcription factor complex which includes c - jun .
il - 1beta stimulated the translocation of nfkappab p65 to the nucleus of 3t3 - l1delta1car adipocytes , an effect markedly attenuated by preincubation for 30 min with a769662 ( fig. 3a and b ) .
a769662 - mediated inhibition of nfkappab p65 nuclear translocation was ablated in 3t3 - l1delta1car adipocytes infected with a dominant - negative ampkalpha1 mutant ( ad.alpha1 - dn ) ( fig. 3c - e ) .
efficiency of adenoviral infection with ad.alpha1 - dn was estimated to be approximately 60 - 70 % and a769662 - stimulated acc phosphorylation was ablated in cells infected with ad.alpha1 - dn , as assessed by myc immunoreactivity ( supplemental fig. 1a ) .
infection with ad.alpha1 - dn was not sufficient to inhibit a769662 - stimulated acc phosphorylation in total 3t3 - l1 adipocyte cell lysates , however ( data not shown ) .
furthermore , il - 1beta - stimulated p65 translocation was not observed in 3t3 - l1delta1car adipocytes infected with a constitutively active ampk mutant ( supplemental fig. 1b and c ) .
preincubation of 3t3 - l1 adipocytes with a769662 significantly attenuated il - 1beta - stimulated jnk , ikk and ikappab phosphorylation ( fig. 4 ) .
furthermore , a769662 stimulation inhibited both activating phosphorylation of the jnk kinase mkk4 in addition to autophosphorylation of the most upstream kinase in il - 1beta signalling , irak4 ( fig. 4 ) .
similar results were obtained when tnf - alpha was used as the pro - inflammatory stimulus at concentrations previously demonstrated to activate adipocyte proinflammatory signalling ( rotter et al. , 2003 ) , with a769662 attenuating tnf - alpha - stimulated cxcl10 mrna expression ( supplemental fig. 2 ) , nfkappab p65 nuclear translocation ( supplemental fig. 3 ) and ikappab phosphorylation ( supplemental fig. 4 ) in cultured adipocytes .
a769662 had no effect , however , on tnf - alpha - stimulated jnk phosphorylation ( supplemental fig. 4 ) .
neither il - 1beta nor tnf - alpha had any effect on basal or a769662 - stimulated ampk activity , as assessed by acc phosphorylation ( fig. 4 , supplemental fig. 4 ) .
the ampk - dependence of a769662 - mediated inhibition of il - 1beta - stimulated irak4 - mkk4 - jnk signalling was further investigated in ampkalpha1alpha2 - / - and ampkalpha1alpha2 +/+ mefs .
a769662 significantly inhibited il - 1beta - stimulated phosphorylation of jnk , mkk4 and irak4 in addition to the jnk substrate c - jun in wild type ampkalpha1alpha2 +/+ mefs , effects that were abolished in mefs deficient in ampkalpha ( fig. 5 ) .
increased il - 6 concentrations have been associated with insulin resistance and obesity and , in contrast to il - 1beta and tnf - alpha , signals via a jak - stat mediated pathway ( lee et al. , 2009 , salt and palmer , 2012 ) .
a769662 significantly inhibited stat3 tyr705 phosphorylation stimulated by a sil - 6ralpha / il - 6 trans - signalling complex in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes ( fig. 6 ) .
sil - 6ralpha / il - 6 had no effect on acc phosphorylation ( fig. 6 ) .
stimulation of 3t3 - l1 adipocytes in the presence of il - 6 but without sil - 6ralpha had no effect on stat3 tyr705 phosphorylation ( data not shown ) .
to examine whether a769662 stimulated tyrosine phosphatases , thereby reducing il - 6 - stimulated stat3 phosphorylation , the capacity of a769662 to inhibit il - 6 - stimulated stat3 phosphorylation was examined in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes preincubated with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate .
incubation with orthovanadate markedly increased il - 6 - stimulated stat3 tyr705 phosphorylation , yet this was still markedly inhibited by a769662 , indicating that ampk - mediated inhibition is at the level of jak activity rather than reduced stat3 phosphatase activity ( supplemental fig. 5 ) .
in contrast to il - 1beta , sil - 6ralpha / il - 6 - stimulation of 3t3 - l1delta1car adipocytes did not produce detectable changes in cytokine / chemokine production ( data not shown ) .
thus to examine the effect of ampk activation on a jak - stat mediated phenomenon in adipocytes , the effect of a769662 on adipogenesis was examined .
stat3 tyr705 phosphorylation occurred 24 - 48 h post - differentiation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes , an effect that was significantly reduced in the presence of a769662 ( fig. 7 ) .
a769662 had no significant effect on the early increase in expression of cebpbeta or cebpdelta during differentiation , but did suppress the later ( day4 onward ) increase in cebpalpha and ppargamma ( fig. 7 ) .
a769662 markedly inhibited the accumulation of triglyceride during adipogenesis , as assessed by oil red o staining ( fig. 7 ) .
to determine the significance of the suppressive effects of ampk on inflammatory signalling pathway status in adipose tissue in vivo , jnk and stat3 phosphorylation were assessed in subcutaneous and gonadal adipose tissue from ampkalpha1 - / - mice and their wild - type littermates .
fasting blood glucose , mass and glucose tolerance were not significantly different between genotypes ( supplemental fig. 6 ) .
basal levels of both jnk and stat3 phosphorylation were significantly increased in gonadal adipose tissue of ampkalpha1 - / - mice relative to wild - type littermates .
basal stat3 phosphorylation was also significantly increased in subcutaneous adipose tissue , with jnk phosphorylation approaching significance ( p = 0.054 ) ( fig. 8 ) .
4 discussion the principal findings of the study are that ampk activation in adipocytes inhibits multiple pro - inflammatory signalling pathways , including il - 1beta - stimulated phosphorylation and activation of mkk4 / jnk and ikk / ikappab / nfkappab pathways , tnf - alpha - stimulated ikk / ikappab / nfkappab and il - 6 trans - signalling - stimulated jak - stat3 signalling .
furthermore , we demonstrate that ampk - mediated suppression of il - 1beta - stimulated pro - inflammatory signalling in adipocytes is associated with reduced phosphorylation of the key proximal il - 1beta signalling pathway protein irak4 as well as markedly reduced expression and secretion of the chemokine cxcl10 by adipocytes .
increased jnk and stat3 phosphorylation is also observed in adipose tissue depots from mice lacking ampkalpha1 , supporting regulation of these distinct pro - inflammatory signalling pathways by ampk in adipose tissue in vivo .
4.1 inhibition of ikk - ikappab - nfkappab signalling by ampk in macrophages and macrophage cell lines , ampk - dependent inhibition of ikappabalpha degradation and nfkappab dna binding has been reported ( sag et al. , 2008 , yang et al. , 2010 ) .
furthermore , increased nuclear nfkappab p65 levels have been reported in endothelial cells from mice deficient in ampk subunits ( wang et al. , 2010 ) .
despite a clear inhibitory role for ampk in such cell types that constitute the stromal - vascular fraction of adipose tissue , ampk - dependent inhibition of ikk - ikappab - nfkappab signalling in adipocytes themselves has not been confirmed , although a compound c - sensitive inhibition of nfkappab and ikkbeta phosphorylation has been reported in cultured adipocytes and perivascular adipose tissue ( sun et al. , 2014 , chen et al. , 2016 , wang et al. , 2013 , zhao et al. , 2014 ) .
as compound c inhibits several protein kinases and can influence pro - inflammatory signalling independent of ampk ( salt and palmer , 2012 , kim et al. , 2011 , bain et al. , 2007 ) , the current study compliments these findings , by providing genetic evidence of the ampk - dependence of the inhibition of il - 1beta and tnf - alpha - stimulated nfkappab p65 translocation in adipocytes .
in endothelial cells , ampk has been proposed to inhibit nfkappab signalling via phosphorylation of the transcriptional co - activator p300 , which blocks activating acetylation of nfkappab p65 ( zhang et al. , 2011 ) , however this report did not investigate the effect of ampk activation upstream of nfkappab .
alternatively , ampk has also been proposed to hyperphosphorylate and inactivate ikk , thereby suppressing nfkappab signalling ( bess et al. , 2011 ) .
the findings in the current study do not fully support either of these mechanisms , as the rapid a769662 - mediated inhibition of the nfkappab pathway is associated with inhibition of activating ikk phosphorylation in adipocytes rather than hyperphosphorylation .
4.2 ampk - mediated inhibition of jnk phosphorylation whether ampk negatively regulates proinflammatory jnk signalling is far less well characterised .
ampk - dependent inhibition of jnk phosphorylation has been reported in macrophages ( jeong et al. , 2009 ) and increased jnk phosphorylation has been reported in macrophages and endothelial cells from mice deficient in ampk subunits ( galic et al. , 2011 , dong et al. , 2010 ) .
the ampk activator aicar has been previously reported to suppress basal jnk phosphorylation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes and adipose tissue of mice ( miyokawa - gorin et al. , 2012 , shibata et al. , 2013 ) .
despite this , the mechanism by which ampk inhibits activating jnk phosphorylation has not been reported .
in the current study , a769662 directly inhibited phosphorylation of the jnk kinase mkk4 in mefs in an ampk - dependent manner , demonstrating the inhibition is not due to increased jnk phosphatase activity .
this is in agreement with indirect evidence in a study published when this manuscript was in preparation , in which hearts of mice with a cardiac - specific knock in of a kinase - dead ampk were reported to exhibit increased mkk4 phosphorylation after ischaemia - reperfusion ( zaha et al. , 2016 ) .
furthermore , we show increased basal jnk phosphorylation in adipose tissue depots from mice lacking ampkalpha1 , reinforcing the negative regulation of pro - inflammatory jnk signalling by ampk in vivo .
intriguingly , a769662 was unable to suppress tnf - alpha - stimulated jnk phosphorylation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes , indicating a cytokine - specific effect of ampk activation .
this is in agreement with previous studies where aicar inhibited tnf - alpha - stimulated erk1 / 2 phosphorylation without impairing jnk phosphorylation in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes ( shibata et al. , 2013 ) and a769662 inhibited palmitate - stimulated ikk phosphorylation without influencing jnk phosphorylation in l6 myotubes ( green et al. , 2011 ) .
taken together with the current study , this suggests inhibition of mkk4 / jnk and ikk / ikappab / nfkappab pathways is not mediated by a common ampk target shared by both pathways .
4.3 ampk - mediated inhibition of irak4 phosphorylation we demonstrate that a769662 stimulation inhibits il - 1beta - stimulated phosphorylation of irak4 at thr345 / ser346 , a proximal event in il - 1beta signalling that is not common with tnf - alpha signalling ( flannery and bowie , 2010 , salt and palmer , 2012 ) .
this shows that ampk activation impairs il - 1beta signalling at a more early stage than previously reported .
it is feasible ; therefore , that inhibition of jnk signalling by ampk activation is dependent on impaired irak4 autophosphorylation .
as irak4 phosphorylation is a signalling event shared by several toll - like receptors ( flannery and bowie , 2010 ) , ampk activation should also inhibit signalling by other inflammatory stimuli that utilise irak4 .
4.4 inhibition of jak - stat signalling by ampk il - 6 - stimulated stat3 phosphorylation has been reported in liver - derived cells , which utilise the classical membrane - bound il - 6 receptor ( nerstedt et al. , 2013 , kim et al. , 2012 ) .
in contrast , il - 6 was only effective in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes when administered with sil - 6ralpha , demonstrating they utilise il - 6 trans - signalling .
furthermore , we demonstrate that a769662 - mediated inhibition of stat3 phosphorylation occurred 24 - 48 h post - differentiation in the mitotic clonal expansion ( mce ) phase concomitant with reduced lipid accumulation .
transient elevation in stat3 phosphorylation in the mce phase is essential for adipocyte differentiation ( wang et al. , 2009 ) .
this represents an earlier mechanism by which ampk activation may inhibit adipogenesis than the reduced expression of later adipogenic markers previously reported ( habinowski and witters , 2001 ) .
ampk activation by a769662 rapidly attenuates il - 6 - stimulated stat3 phosphorylation in the presence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate , indicating an effect on jak activity , in agreement with studies in liver cell lines ( nerstedt et al. , 2013 ) .
this is further corroborated by recent studies in our laboratories that have demonstrated that ampk can directly phosphorylate ser515 and ser518 in jak1 in vitro , and that mutation of the ser residues to ala ablates ampk - mediated inhibition of jak1 - stat signalling in intact cells ( rutherford et al. , 2016 ) .
a769662 - mediated inhibition of jak activity via phosphorylation of ser515 / 518 is therefore likely to underlie the inhibition of both il - 6 signalling and adipogenic jak - stat signalling .
4.5 inhibition of cytokine / chemokine synthesis by ampk activation a769662 suppressed il - 1beta - stimulated secretion of mcp - 1 , cxcl10 and cxcl1 from 3t3 - l1delta1car adipocytes in addition to il - 1beta - and tnf - alpha - stimulated cxcl10 gene expression in sw872 adipocytes .
ampk - dependent inhibition of mcp - 1 secretion has previously been demonstrated in several cell types ( salt and palmer , 2012 , ewart et al. , 2008 ) .
the current study supports and extends previous studies reporting ampk - mediated inhibition of ifn - gamma - stimulated cxcl10 mrna expression in mouse astrocytes and microglia ( meares et al. , 2013 ) .
when examining the cytokines and chemokines influenced by il - 1beta in adipocytes , it has previously been reported that il - 1beta stimulates mcp - 1 secretion in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes ( takahashi et al. , 2008 ) and a recent study in human differentiated adipocytes reported il - 1beta - stimulated secretion of mcp - 1 and cxcl10 ( alomar et al. , 2015 ) .
the latter study also reported il - 1beta - stimulated secretion of il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 6 , il - 10 , il - 13 , il - 17 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , vegf and gm - csf , which was not observed in the current study ( alomar et al. , 2015 ) .
the reason for the discrepancy may reflect the two different cell models , shorter exposure to il - 1beta in our study or differential sensitivity of the assays utilised .
cxcl10 is transcriptionally regulated by nfkappab and pro - inflammatory mapk signalling ( thiefes et al. , 2005 ) .
as a769662 had no effect on tnf - alpha - stimulated jnk phosphorylation yet robustly inhibited cxcl10 mrna expression , this may suggest that inhibition of the ikk - ikappab - nfkappab pathway underlies the inhibition in tnf - alpha - stimulated cells .
4.6 increased proinflammatory signalling in adipose tissue from mice with reduced ampk levels as increased jnk and stat3 phosphorylation was observed in adipose tissue depots from mice lacking ampkalpha1 , this indicates that these distinct pro - inflammatory signalling pathways are negatively regulated by ampk in adipose tissue in vivo .
in support of this , increased myocardial cytokine and chemokine expression has previously been demonstrated in the same mouse model after lps stimulation ( castanares - zapatero et al. , 2013 ) .
as the mouse adipose used in the current study is from mice globally deficient in ampkalpha1 , the increased basal jnk and stat3 phosphorylation observed may be a consequence of impaired ampk activity in adipocytes , macrophages or other stromal - vascular cells .
the effect was not due to differences in mass or glucose tolerance , which was unaltered between genotypes .
mice with adipocyte - specific deletion of ampkalpha1 , ampkalpha2 , ampkbeta1 and ampkbeta2 have recently been described ( wu et al. , 2015 , mottillo et al. , 2016 ) which would prove useful in order to further characterise the anti - inflammatory actions of ampk in adipose .
4.7 activation of ampk in adipocytes the concentration of a769662 ( 300 mumol / l ) required for activation of ampk in 3t3 - l1 adipocytes and sw872 adipocytes is higher than that previously reported in several other tissues and cell types ( goransson et al. , 2007 , foretz et al. , 2010 ) , although this concentration does not inappropriately alter amp : atp ratios in hek293 cells ( hawley et al. , 2010 ) .
as a few studies have reported ampk - independent effects of a769662 in other cell types ( garcia - garcia et al. , 2010 , benziane et al. , 2009 , moreno et al. , 2008 ) , the demonstration of ampk - dependent inhibition of signalling using dominant negative mutant ampk and mefs lacking ampk establishes the ampk dependence of these effects .
reduced ampk activity has been reported in metabolic tissues of animal models of insulin resistance and obesity ( viollet et al. , 2010 , coughlan et al. , 2014 ) .
furthermore , reduced ampk activity has been reported in adipose tissue of insulin resistant volunteers compared with bmi - matched insulin sensitive controls ( gauthier et al. , 2011 ) and weight loss is associated with increased adipose tissue ampk activity and insulin sensitivity ( fritzen et al. , 2015 , xu et al. , 2015 ) , although scat tnf - alpha and il - 1beta mrna levels were unchanged after weight loss ( xu et al. , 2015 ) .
multiple lines of evidence suggest activation of ampk is a useful therapeutic aim in obesity and insulin resistance .
activation of adipose tissue ampk is feasible , as previous work in our laboratory has shown that metformin stimulated ampk activity in scat of individuals with type 2 diabetes ( boyle et al. , 2011 ) .
4.8 conclusions taken together , our data demonstrate that ampk activation is associated with multiple anti - inflammatory actions in adipocytes including inhibition of il - 1beta - stimulated irak4 phosphorylation .
such anti - inflammatory actions would be likely to improve the insulin resistance associated with obesity in addition to the well - characterised metabolic actions of ampk .
accordingly ampk in adipose tissue is a therapeutic target worthy of further investigation .

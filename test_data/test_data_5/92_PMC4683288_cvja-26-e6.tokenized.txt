abstract persistent truncus arteriosus ( pta ) is a rare conotruncal defect , defined as a single arterial vessel arising from the heart , which gives origin to the systemic , pulmonary and coronary circulations .
it has an extremely poor prognosis and carries a high mortality rate during the early years of life unless surgically repaired .
a few known cases have been reported of patients reaching maturity , and exceptionally , patients suffering from this disease having lived into the fourth decade .
the purpose of this report was to present a new case of pta type 1 , diagnosed by echocardiography and mri , in a 41 - year - old woman , with the peculiarity of long survival into adult life .
she had also experienced a full - term pregnancy and delivery of a normal infant three years prior to her diagnosis .
pulmonary vascular disease made her condition inoperable but she was doing well with medical management after a follow up of 15 months .
based on this work , we concluded that pulmonary arterial hypertension is deleterious for life in some cardiovascular diseases , but in others , allows survival , as occurred in these patients with pta .
the patient 's clinical course and anatomical findings are reported , along with factors that may have contributed to her longevity .
persistent truncus arteriosus adult echocardiography pulmonary artery hypertension magnetic resonance imaging abstract persistent truncus arteriosus ( pta ) is an uncommon congenital heart disease ( chd ) that was first described by wilson in 1798 .
in 1976 , calder et al. reported it accounted for approximately 0.7 to 1.2 % of all congenital heart malformations and occurred equally in men and women.1 truncus arteriosus ( ta ) is defined as a single arterial vessel , usually arising from both the left and the right ventricle , which gives rise to the systemic , pulmonary and coronary artery circulations.1 it is mostly associated with a large , non - restrictive ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) situated below the semilunar truncal valve .
pta is also reported to be associated with a high rate of mortality if uncorrected .
calder et al. stated that about 65 % of patients treated medically did not survive beyond six months of age , and more than 90 % who did not have surgical repair died before one year of age.1 surgical intervention is required to avoid pulmonary vascular disease , which is common in the unrepaired patient .
because of this extremely poor prognosis , pta is uncommonly encountered in adult life .
here we report on the unusual case of a woman with unrepaired ta who was evaluated by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .
case report a 41 - year - old housewife initially presented to the cardiology department of hedi chaker hospital in tunisia in november 2011 with symptoms of exercise intolerance and occasional palpitations of several months' duration .
she had no family history of congenital defects .
three years earlier , when she was 38 years old , she gave birth to a normal baby after undergoing an uneventful full - term pregnancy and delivery .
cyanosis and dyspnoea on exertion had been present throughout her life , but despite this , she appeared to have had a fairly normal life , being able to tolerate daily activities well .
two weeks prior to admission , she reported having experienced an exacerbation of dyspnoea .
she was a small - built woman and appeared deeply cyanosed on examination but not dyspnoeic at rest .
prominent clubbing of the fingers was noticeable .
congestion of the jugular veins was also striking .
her oxygen saturation in room air was about 80 % .
physical examination revealed a mild systolic murmur over the left parasternal border and a loud second heart sound in the right second intercostal space .
a 12 - lead resting electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm , right bundle branch block and high qrs voltage suggestive of biventricular hypertrophy .
a chest radiograph revealed marked cardiomegaly with a prominent main pulmonary trunk and increased pulmonary vascularity .
transthoracic echocardiography indicated a levocardia heart with atrial situs solitus and concordant atrioventricular connections .
marked biventricular hypertrophy in the fourchamber view was also evident .
the left ventricle demonstrated a normal ejection fraction .
the most striking finding was a single large vessel arising from the base of the heart , with mild regurgitation related predominantly to the summit of the right ventricle ( 70 %) .
a large , non - restrictive outlet vsd was noted beneath the truncal valve ( fig. 1 ) .
neither the pulmonary artery ( pa ) nor the pulmonary valve could be seen .
figure 1 .
transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a hypertrophied right ventricle , a single great vessel ( persistent truncus arteriosus ) overriding both ventricles , and a large single subtruncal ventricular septal defect .
la , left atrium ; ra , right atrium ; lv , left ventricle ; rv , right ventricle ; tv , troncal valve ; pa , pulmonary artery .
cardiac mri was also performed to better delineate the origin of the pulmonary arteries .
it demonstrated a dilated common arterial trunk with the left and right pulmonary arteries arising from a short main pulmonary trunk at the posterior side of the common arterial trunk .
the left ventricle ( lv ) was normal in size .
the right ventricle ( rv ) was also normal in size with concentric hypertrophy .
a large , subarterial vsd was noted beneath the truncal valve , which was trileaflet , with mild insufficiency ( fig. 2 ) .

mri demonstrated a dilated common arterial trunk with the left and right pulmonary arteries arising from a short main pulmonary trunk at the posterior side of the common arterial trunk .
lv , left ventricle ; rv , right ventricle ; tv , troncal valve ; lpa , left pulmonary artery. from on the above findings , for this patient , a diagnosis in keeping with a conotruncal anomaly could best be classified as type 1 , based on collette and edwards' classification.2 furthermore , the thoracic vasculature was significantly altered , with irreversible pulmonary hypertension .
taking this into account , conservative management was recommended .
the patient appeared to make good progress on medical treatment , which included bed rest and fluid restriction .
she was advised against pregnancy , considering her mature age and in light of the underlying severe pulmonary hypertension .
her condition appeared to have remained stable 15 months after discharge from hospital .
chromosomal studies were not undertaken , however her child appeared in a good state of health .
discussion pta usually includes a large vsd with the presence of a significant left - to - right shunt , and is dependent on the resistance ratios between the systemic and pulmonary circulation .
indeed , pulmonary vascular resistance ( pvr ) decreases during the first weeks of life , and neonates experience congestive heart failure because of the increased pulmonary blood flow , unless the pulmonary arteries are hypoplastic or stenosed or there is persistently elevated pvr .
these factors may delay the appearance of symptoms and babies appear mildly cyanosed due to the high pvr .
according to marcelletti et al. , 3 these first effects are mainly beneficial and some patients unusually survived through to adulthood .
such survival is achieved only at the price of subjecting the pulmonary vasculature to the effects of severe pulmonary hypertension due to occlusive intimal fibro - elastosis.3 echocardiography is a reliable , non - invasive , first - line imaging tool that proved to be beneficial in the diagnosis of differentiating this lesion from pulmonary atresia with vsd .
the hallmark of pta is that only a single semilunar valve is seen.4 mri , although expensive and not easily accessible to all patients , is a complementary modality that has been shown to be accurate in the diagnosis and follow up of chd.5 it is a useful adjunct , currently recognised by paediatric cardiologists and cardiac surgeons because it includes a wide field of view and multiplanar capabilities and reconstructions .
the strength of mri includes comprehensive access and coverage , providing imaging of all parts of the right ventricle , pulmonary arteries , pulmonary veins and aorta.6 our case illustrates the major role of cardiac mri , due to it being a fairly safe technique that allows precise definition and high resolution , and in this case , it demonstrated the complex anatomy of pta .
in this patient , the truncal valve was trileaflet and competent , which may have played an important role in her survival , since it is well established that truncal valve insufficiency is associated with higher rates of early and late mortality.7 eisenmenger physiology is an absolute contraindication to pregnancy .
maternal mortality is reported to be as high as 36 %. 8 however , in this case , the patient had not received prior counselling before she fell pregnant , since her diagnosis was made three years after delivery .
she was fortunate not to have had a complicated pregnancy .
conclusion echocardiography and mri played an important role in detecting the pta in this patient , which assisted in appropriate management .
pta is an uncommon cardiovascular anomaly with a poor prognosis , and without surgical repair , is regarded to be incompatible with life .
this unique case study ( type 1 pta ) offers an example of the natural history of an unrepaired complex congenital cardiac disease that overcame the odds of a short life expectancy .

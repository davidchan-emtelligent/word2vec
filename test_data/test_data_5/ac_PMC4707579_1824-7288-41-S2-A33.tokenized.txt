joint national meeting sip , simgeped , study group on pediatric ultrasound , sup study group on hypertensionrome , italy background ultrasound ( us ) can be decisive for diagnosis , in some situations , in others the contribution of the us is only complementary and must be integrated with other diagnostic tests .
finally , in some cases , the ultrasound imaging does not provide solutions , but offers questions .
the clinic , experience , and knowledge can find appropriate solutions .
when an ultrasound is a diagnosis a male newborn of 3700 g. , born after 40 weeks' gestation via a vaginal dystotic delivery , apgar 8 and 10 to 1'and 5 ' , had a fracture of the right clavicle .
after about 48 hours he was admitted to our department for jaundice and hematoma of the right hemiscrotum ( fig.1 ) , with no pain , no other symptoms .
scrotal doppler us showed a normal testicle size and shape , regularly vascularized , but modest collection of fluid , finely corpusculated and marked thickening of subcutaneous tissue .
abdomen us revealed a complex mass upper pole of the right kidney ( 2.8 cm ) , not vascularized , withinhomogeneous echogenicity ( fig.2 ) .
ultrasonography had been sufficient to make the diagnosis of adrenal hemorrhage with hemorrhagic spreading at right hemiscrotum. were not performed further investigations and a conservative treatment was chosen .
ultrasound monitoring showed progressive organization of the hematoma and complete resolution after about 40 days .
figure 1 hematoma of the right hemiscrotum .
figure 2 complex mass upper pole of the right kidney when the ultrasound helps in diagnosis a boy , six years old , previously healthy , about 15 days ago was treated with oral antibiotics for uti .
an ultrasound is performed because urinary frequency , dysuria , urgency , gross hematuria reappeared .
us revealed one large stone bladder ( fig.3 ) ; microscopy of the urine sediments showed cystine crystals .
stone , removed from the bladder endoscopically , were composed of cystine and calcium oxalate , when analysed .
figure 3 one large stone bladder when the ultrasound raises clinical questions routine fetal ultrasound screening reports dilatation of the urinary tract in about 1 - 2 % of all pregnancies , most of these are mild or moderate , limited to the renal pelvis , calyceal and ureter is not seen , the bladder is normal , renal parenchyma have normal thickness and appearance .
these children do not have an obstructive pathology , nor a predisposition to uti , and in most cases the dilatation is transient and has no pathological significance .
only clinical experience and up to date knowledge avoids these children to undergo invasive , painful and expensive imaging techniques , or to strenuous follow - up. written informed consent for publication of clinical details and clinical images was obtained from the parents of the patients

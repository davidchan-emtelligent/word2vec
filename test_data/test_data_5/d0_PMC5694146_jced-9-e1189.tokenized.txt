background this study compared the solubility and the ph of different root canal sealers in vitro .
material and methods bioroot ( tm ) rcs , totalfill bc sealer , mta fillapex , sealapextm , ah plus , easyseal , pulp canal sealer ( tm ) and n2 were tested .
similar specimens were prepared using ring molds with an internal diameter of 20 +/ - 0,1 mm and a height of 1,5 +/ - 0,1 mm and digitally weighted to register the mass of each specimen before and after immersion in distilled water .
solubility was determined after 24 hours and statistically analysed using a one - way anova test and post - hoc tukey test .
the ph value was measured by a digital ph meter after 3 and 24 hours from manipulation .
results bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer showed significantly higher solubility ( p < 0.05 ) .
all the remnant root canal sealers fulfilled the requirements of solubility of the international standard organization 6876 demonstrating a weight loss of less than 3 % .
bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer exhibited high alkaline ph over time ( p < 0.05 ) ; the alkalinity of the other tested cements was significantly lower .
conclusions the prolonged alkalinity of bioceramic sealer matched the increase in solubility .
this may encourage their biological and antimicrobial effects , but the ongoing solubility may impact their ability to prevent apical leakage .
key words : ph , root canal sealers , solubility .
introduction endodontic sealers are used to obtain a stable seal of the root canal systems by the filling of discrepancies between the dentinal wall and gutta - percha ( 1 ) .
root canal sealers and gutta - percha entomb residual microorganisms , prevent the access of any bacteria from the oral environment and avoid their passage to the periapical tissues , thus aiding the healing of periapical lesions ( 2 ) .
an ideal sealer should offer specific properties ( 3,4 ) and insolubility is one of the most desiderable physical property for root canal sealers ( 5 ) because it may have a great impact on the success rate of root canal treatment ( 2 ) .
in fact , degradation of the sealer may cause gaps along the sealer / dentin or the sealer / gutta - percha interface which might provide a pathway for microorganisms and their toxic products into periapical tissues ( 5,6 ) .
low solubility of a root canal sealer has been introduced in 2000 as a requirement in the ansi / ada specification no .
57 and in 2001 as a requirement in the international standards organization 6876 standard for root canal sealing materials .
according to those standards the solubility of a sealer shall not exceed 3 % mass fraction after immersion in water for 24 hours ( 7 ) .
in addition , the ph change of sealers may be related with antimicrobial effects and deposition of mineralized tissue , thus playing a role in the healing process ( 8 ) .
alkaline ph of root canal sealers could neutralize the lactic acid from osteoclasts and prevent dissolution of mineralized components of teeth ( 9 ) .
today different types of endodontic sealers are available : zinc - oxide eugenol ( znoe ) , resin - based , calcium hydroxide containing , mta and bioceramic - based root canal sealers ( 10 ) .
the znoe sealers have a long history of successful usage , because of their widely demonstrated positive qualities ( 4 ) .
calcium hydroxide containing sealers supposedly have antimicrobical effects and biologic properties that stimulate a calcific barrier at the apex ( 4 ) .
epoxy - based cements are the primarily ones amongst re - sin - based sealers , with many tested properties like antimicrobial action , adhesion to dentin walls , good sealing ability and relative insolubility ( 4 ) .
because of its favorable biological characteristics , root canal sealers based on mineral trioxide aggregate ( mta ) have been introduced ( 11 ,) .
however , the handling characteristics of mta preclude the use as a sealer without the addition of chemicals that provide sufficient flow ( 12 ) .
components such as gels or water - soluble polymers have been added to enhance the cement manipulation ( 12,13 ) .
various studies reported the biocompatibility of mta endodontic sealers , which may stimulate mineralization and exhibit bioactivity by stimulating hydroxyapatite nucleation ( 14 ) .
recently , bioceramic - based sealers containing calcium silicate and / or calcium phosphate attracted considerable attention because of their physical and biological properties such as their alkaline ph , chemical stability within the biological environment , and lack of shrinkage ( 15 ) bioceramic materials contain calcium phosphate which enhances the setting properties of bioceramics and results in a chemical composition and crystalline structure similar to tooth and bone apatite materials , thereby improving sealer - to - root dentin bonding ( 16 ) .
the purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate solubility at 24 hours and ph at 3 and 24 hours of new bioceramic - based sealers root canal sealers comparing them to conventional sealers .
the null hypothesis tested was that there is no significant difference among root canal sealers tested .
material and methods eight different root canal sealers were tested : bioroot ( tm ) rcs , totalfill bc sealer , mta fillapex , sealapex ( tm ) , ah plus , easy - seal , pulp canal sealer ( tm ) , n2 ( table 1 ) .
table 1 root canal sealers tested .
- solubility test solubility was determined in accordance with the international standards organization ( iso ) 6876 method and with the american dental association ( ada ) specification no .
57. the iso 6876 standard specifies requirements for " materials used for permanent obturation of the root canal with or without the aid of obturating points " .
stainless steel ring molds with an internal diameter of 20 +/ - 0,1 mm and a height of 1,5 +/ - 0,1 mm were used for samples preparation .
all moulds were cleaned with acetone in an ultrasound bath for 15 minutes and weighted 3 times before use ( accuracy +/ - 0,0001 g ) using a precision balance ( mettler - toledo , model ae1633 , novate milanese , italy ) .
they were then placed on a glass plate , filled to slight excess with the mixed materials and covered with another glass plate under a light pressure in order to remove any exceeding material .
all root - canal sealers were mixed and prepared by the same operator in accordance with manufacturer 's instructions .
ten sets of specimens for each material were prepared .
all samples set into an incubator at 37 ( o ) c and > 95 % relative humidity ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) for a period corresponding to three times the setting time .
the excess of water was removed with absorbent paper and the samples were weighed 3 times .
the average reading was recorded to 3 decimal places .
the samples were placed two by two into a petri dish containing 50 ml of distilled water and transferred into the same incubator at 37 ( o ) c and > 95 % relative humidity for 24 hours .
after incubation time , the samples were rinsed with 3 ml of distilled water and the washings were allowed to drain back into the petri dish .
the samples were then discarded , and the petri dishes were dried in an oven at 105 ( o ) c for 48 hours ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) , cooled down in the same desiccator and reweighted .
the difference between the final mass and the initial mass of the petri dish divided by the initial dry weight of the sample x 100 correspond to the loss of mass of each specimen express as percentage of solubility ( 7,16 ) .
the solubility test was repeated 2 months after by using the same method ( 7 ) .
analysis of variance ( anova ) was applied to determine whether significant differences existed among the groups .
for the post - hoc test , the tukey 's test was used .
significance for all statistical tests was predetermined at p < 0.05 .
- ph measurements root canal sealers were mixed and placed onto cylindrical teflon moulds 2 - mm - height and 10 - mm - diameter and set into an incubator at 37 ( o ) c and > 95 % relative humidity ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) .
six samples were prepared for each group and were placed into separate vials containing 10 ml of distilled water .
the samples were stored at 37degreesc and ph measurement was performed 3 and 24 hours after incubation .
the ph values were measured by a digital ph meter ( oriontm ph meter 420a , orion research inc. , boston , ma , usa ) calibrated with buffer solutions ( orion buffer solution , perfect buffer 10 , orion research inc. [ ph = 4,01 ; ph = 7,00 ; ph = 10,00 ]) before each experiment .
after removal of the specimens , the container was placed in an orbital shaker ( r & d labs srl , saronno , italy ) for 5 sec before measuring .
the temperature of the room during the test was 25degreesc .
tukey 's test was applied to determine whether significant differences existed in ph values after 3 hours of incubation .
to determine whether time influenced the ph values of the root canal sealers , an analysis of longitudinal data was performed using t - test for paired data ( p < 0.05 ) between times of incubation ( 3 and 24 hours ) .
results - solubility (%) the results of solubility test are listed in table 2 .
bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer showed significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) solubility among the tested materials , although the highest solubility percentage was recorded for totalfill bc sealer .
all remnant root canal sealers ( easyseal ; mta fillapex ; pulp canal sealer ( tm ) ; sealapex ( tm ) ; ah plus and n2 ) fulfilled the requirements of the international standard organization 6876 and the ansi / ada specification no .
57 for endodontic sealing materials ( chicago , usa , 2000 ) , demonstrating a weight loss of less than 3 % .
ah plus provided the lowest solubility , significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) than all the tested sealers .
pulp canal sealer ( tm ) , n2 , sealapex ( tm ) , easyseal and mta fillapex showed solubility values significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) than bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer but significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) than ah plus .
no significant differences were found between pulp canal sealer ( tm ) , sealapex ( tm ) and n2 .
solubility values in increasing order were : ah plus < pulp canal sealer ( tm ) < n2 < sealapex ( tm )< easyseal < mta fillapex < bioroot ( tm ) rcs < totalfill bc sealer .
table 2 mean percentage values of solubility and standard deviation ( sd ) for each material .
- ph changes the ph mean values of all tested materials at different immersion times ( 3 and 24 h ) are described in table 3 .
bioroot ( tm ) rcs , totalfill bc sealer and sealapex ( tm ) exhibited high alkaline ph values over time , although the significantly highest alkaline ph score was recorded for totalfill bc sealer ( p < 0.05 ) .
no significant variation in ph was observed for sealapex root canal sealer over time , whereas it was significant for both bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer ( p < 0.05 ) .
significantly lower ( p < 0.05 ) was the alkalinity of easyseal , mta fillapex , pulp canal sealer ( tm ) and ah plus than that observed for bioroot ( tm ) rcs , totalfill bc sealer and sealapex ( tm ) .
mta fillapex exhibited initial neutral ph ( 7.68 ) followed by a weak alkaline ph ( 8.02 ) .
pulp canal sealer ( tm ) and ah plus had initial weak alkaline ph ( 8.0 ) followed by neutral ph (~ 7.6 ) .
n2 exhibited initial neutral ph (~ 7.1 ) followed by final weak acidic ph (~ 6.98 ) .
table 3 mean ph values and standard deviation ( sd ) for each the tested materials at 3 and 24 after incubation .
discussion root canal sealers have to provide an apical seal avoiding the leakage of irritants and pathogens from the root canal system into the periradicular tissues ( 4 ) .
solubility is an important factor in assessing the suitability of dental materials in dentistry : it 's defined as the ability of a substance to dissolve in another and it 's expressed as the concentration of the saturated solution of the former in the latter ( 17 ) .
the solubility of the root canal sealers shall not exceed 3 % mass fraction after immersion in water for 24 hours , when determined in accordance to the international standards organization 6876 standard or ansi / ada specification no .
57. the solubility test performed in the present study fulfilled these standards .
this kind of test is significant because root canal sealers can get direct contact with periapical tissues fluids in apical region ( 18 ) .
mta - based and bioceramic sealers have been introduced in endodontics for advantages like their biocompatibility that prevents rejection by the surrounding tissues and improved sealer - to - root dentin bonding , due to the deposition of bone apatite materials ( 19 ) .
the null hypothesis of this study was rejected : a significant difference in solubility percentages among the root canal sealers tested has been shown .
furthermore , the findings of this study demonstrated that bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer showed significantly higher solubility among the tested materials with a weight loss higher than 3 % .
many studies investigated the solubility of root canal sealers ( 2 ) .
znoe sealers are generally related with a certain degree of weight loss after storage in water , varying approximately from less than 1 % to 7 % ( 18 ) .
calcium hydroxide - containing sealers are also believed to be soluble over time ( 18 ) .
epoxy resin - based sealers have a relatively low solubility in water ( 18 ) .
mta - based sealers have been reported to fulfill the requirements of the international standard organization 6876 , demonstrating a weight loss of less than 3 % ( 19 ) .
in the present study bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer showed significantly higher solubility among the tested materials and they reported a weight loss higher than 3 % .
this is in agreement with a study by borges et al .
( 20 ) , which demonstrated that solubility of bioceramic sealer iroot sp did n't meet ansi / ada requirements : high solubility is the result of hydrophilic nanosized particles , which increases their surface area and allows more liquid molecules to come into contact with the sealer .
however , literature contains conflicting results : viapiana et al .
( 1 ) found high solubility of mta - fillapex , while zhou et al .
( 10 ) reported that solubility of the biocearmic sealer endosequence bc is consistent with iso 6876 / 2001 .
the discrepancy between the results of these authors may be attributed to variations in the methods used to dry the samples after having subjected them to solubility testing .
the freshly published article by lee et al .
( 20 ) showed that endosequence bc sealer and mta fillapex were not set in humid incubator condition even after one month , so non - complete setting of these root canal sealers should be another reason for higher solubility .
lee et al .
( 21 ) concluded that both bc sealer and mta fillapex are showed to not fulfill the required chemical and physical properties as ideal root canal sealers .
an alkaline ph may contribute to osteogenic potential , biocompatibility , and antibacterial ability of root canal sealers ( 8,10,21 ) .
the calcium hydroxide sealer tested ( sealapex ( tm )) demonstrated the higher alkalinity ( ph > 9 ) , epoxy resin - based sealers tested ( easyseal and ah plus ) showed a fair alkalinity ( followed by a neutral ph at 24 hrs for ah plus ) , the znoe sealers reported an initial weak alkaline ph ( 8.0 ) followed by a neutral ph (~ 7.6 ) for pulp canal sealer ( tm ) and an initial neutral ph (~ 7.1 ) that followed by a final weak acidic ph (~ 6.98 ) for n2 .
recent studies indicated that the resin - based sealers like ah plus are characterized by a slightly neutral ph and low solubility ( 22 ) .
this concept was confirmed by faria - junior et al .
( 23 ) : the neutral ph and its low solubility may reduce the antibacterial activity of the sealer .
the bioceramic - based sealers ( bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer ) exhibited high alkaline ph over time , significantly lower than the other tested materials .
mta fillapex reported an initial neutral ph ( 7.68 ) that was followed by a weak alkaline ph ( 8.02 ) .
various studies supported these findings about bioceramic - based sealers : their ph is ranging between 10 - 12 for some weeks after setting ( 10,22 ) .
silva et al .
( 24 ) showed that the initial ph of mta - fillapex was few alkaline ( ph = 9.3 ) and gradually declined over time to 7.76 after one week .
a strong alkaline ph is supposed to encourage a prolonged setting time and a long - lasting antibacterial effect that eliminates the residual microorganisms survived along dentinal walls .
silva et al .
( 24 ) suggested that mta - fillapex , due to high alkalinity , is able to release hydroxyl ions , thereby causing a high ca2 + ion release .
the alkaline behaviour could contribute to hard tissue formation by activating alkaline phosphatase , neutralize the lactic acid from osteoclasts and prevent dissolution of mineralized components of teeth , prevent the bone destruction and allow tissue repair with hydroxyapatite formation ( 25 ) .
in lee et al. study ( 21 ) the ph value of three different bioceramic - based root canal sealers remained significantly higher than that of epoxy re - sin - based sealers for 24 hours , with the highest alkaline ph measured from bc sealer for the entire period of evaluation .
conclusions based on the present results , the tested root canal sealers are showed to fulfill the required solubility properties , except the bio - root ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer .
even if ph values may encourage their biological and antimicrobial behaviour over time , the bioroot ( tm ) rcs and totalfill bc sealer should be improved to reduce their solubility and to increase their ability to prevent apical leakage .
further clinical trial tests and long term follow - up studies would be highly valuable to evaluate the bioceramic sealers' clinical performances .

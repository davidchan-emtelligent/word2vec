2007 elsevier ltdopen access under cc by 3.0 license recent years have revealed a high degree of structural organisation in the way in which cell - surface receptors and their associated signalling complexes interact at a molecular level .
fluorescence - based techniques have been at the forefront of methodologies used to investigate this organisation and dissect the pharmacology of drug - receptor interactions at the single - cell level .
one such technique , fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) , in conjunction with a fluorescent ligand or receptor , is capable of providing quantitative information about the number of receptors and their mobilities within small areas of the cell membrane that approach the size of some signalling domains .
this article describes the use of fcs to perform subcellular quantitative pharmacology , with particular reference to g - protein - coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) .
in conjunction with other forms of fluctuation analysis , such as two - colour cross - correlation fcs and molecular brightness analysis , fcs provides the first opportunity to investigate the domain - specific nature of gpcr pharmacology .
the need for single - cell pharmacology the quantitative characterization of the interaction of a ligand with its receptor in terms of affinity and efficacy has been a mainstay of pharmacology since the concept of receptors was first introduced .
such parameters were derived initially from functional responses in isolated tissue samples and are now obtained routinely from populations of thousands of cells to give valuable information about ligand affinity , efficacy and binding capacity at a macroscopic level .
the calculation of these ligand properties requires an accurate knowledge of both the free and bound concentrations of the drugs used .
mounting evidence suggests that membrane receptors and their associated signalling molecules exist in a highly ordered membrane environment [ 1 - 4 ] .
this is particularly true of g - protein - coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) , which can exist in dimeric and oligomeric complexes with other gpcrs , scaffolding proteins [ such as a - kinase - anchoring proteins ( akaps )] and adaptor molecules [ such as beta - arrestin and receptor - activity - modifying proteins ( ramps )] ([ 1 - 5 ] and references therein ) .
it is now evident that signalling from cell - surface receptors is highly compartmentalised , with receptors existing in close proximity to particular g - proteins , their effectors and the enzymes responsible for second - messenger metabolism [ 1,2 ] .
such organisation is mediated by protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions and is orchestrated by an association with the cytoskeleton and the tendency of some proteins to partition into membrane microdomains , such as lipid rafts and caveolae [ 2,3 ] .
this leads to the formation of signalling microdomains , such as those described for receptors that stimulate the formation of camp .
here , local second - messenger concentrations are controlled by the proximity of adenylyl cyclase , phosphodiesterases and camp - activated protein kinase a [ 2,5 ] .
a similar situation has been described for receptors linked to increases in intracellular calcium mediated by transient receptor potential ( trp ) channels [ 4 ] .
the movement of gpcrs to and from such domains can also be initiated by receptor stimulation .
for instance , the a1 - adenosine receptor moves out of caveolae following agonist stimulation , whereas , conversely , studies show that muscarinic , beta - adrenergic and bradykinin receptors move into caveolae following activation ([ 1,3 ] and references therein ) .
similarly , the movement of receptors to clathrin pits can be initiated by agonist - mediated receptor phosphorylation and the binding of adaptor proteins , such as beta - arrestin , adaptin and dynamin [ 6 ] .
the formation of such macromolecular complexes not only leads to the movement of the receptor to clathrin - coated pits and its subsequent intracellular trafficking but can also mediate the activation of g - protein - independent signalling pathways , such as those leading to extracellular signal - related kinase ( erk ) activation [ 1,5 ] .
alternative coupling to different effector signalling pathways can also have a major impact on the potency and efficacy of particular ligands [ 6 ] .
for example , the beta - adrenoceptor ligand propranolol is an inverse agonist of beta2 - adrenoceptor - mediated camp accumulation but activate erk1 / 2 through the same receptor in the same cells [ 7,8 ] .
it is , therefore , likely that the pharmacology of gpcrs can differ markedly depending on their membrane localisation and the signalling proteins present within that locality .
if gpcrs can exist in different signaling domains within a single cell , then this will have important implications for the orchestration of drug action within a given cell type and the potential for cross - talk with other signalling pathways [ 9 ] .
there is therefore an urgent need to develop techniques that can study the molecular pharmacology of gpcrs within specific membrane domains of single cells .
fluorescence - based imaging technologies have been used widely to assess the cellular distribution of gpcrs and their associated signalling partners at a single - cell level [ 10 ] .
in particular , genetic tagging of either the receptors themselves or associated proteins with green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) has proved a powerful technique for assessing the co - localisation of receptors and specific raft markers .
confocal - based techniques , such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) [ 11 ] , have provided useful information about the confinement of gpcrs within membrane domains , their macroscopic diffusion coefficients and how these are altered by receptor stimulation ( e.g. [ 12 ]) .
more sophisticated techniques , such as fluorescence ( forster ) or bioluminescence resonance - energy transfer ( fret / bret ) , have been used to probe the proximity of receptor - receptor and receptor - effector interactions directly ( reviewed in [ 10 ]) .
however , none of these techniques has both the temporal and spatial resolution to determine the properties of ligand - receptor complexes within membrane microdomains .
in addition , they lack the ability to quantify the concentrations of both free and bound ligand , which are a prerequisite to the determination of potency and affinity .
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) is one technique with the potential to fill this gap [ 13 - 15 ] .
as with the earlier described techniques , fcs is noninvasive and can be used on specific cell types within a mixed cell population , making it ideal for use with small numbers of cells ( e.g. in samples obtained from biopsies ) .
however , it also has a resolution high enough to localize measurements to areas of the cell membrane as small as some membrane microdomains .
uniquely , it is quantitative and its wide dynamic range allows the simultaneous detection of both fast - and slow - moving species ( e.g. both free and receptor - bound ligand ) .
here , we discuss the application of fcs - based techniques to measuring the subcellular pharmacology of gpcrs .
fcs and its application to studying ligand - receptor binding the technique of fcs is based on measuring fluctuations in fluorescence intensity as fluorescently labelled particles diffuse through a small defined detection volume , which is approximately 0.25 fl in size ( roughly the same volume as a mitochondrion ) ( box 1 ) .
statistical analysis of these fluctuations using autocorrelation analysis gives information about both the diffusion coefficient of the fluorescent particles and their concentration .
the concept of correlation spectroscopy and the statistical principles involved were originally described in the 1970s .
however , it was not until the advent of high - quality optics and photon - detection technology in the 1990s that the true power of the technique was finally realized ( see [ 15 ] for a history of fcs development ) .
this subsequently led to the application of fcs to the study of ligand - receptor interactions , by virtue of its ability to distinguish between species based on the speed of their diffusion ( box 2 ) .
such a difference is present during ligand - receptor interactions because the diffusion co - efficient of a fast - moving free fluorescent ligand just above the cell surface decreases significantly when it binds to a much slower moving membrane receptor .
fcs has been used to characterise the binding of ligands to gpcrs , tyrosine - kinase receptors and ion channels [ 16 - 21 ] .
ligand - binding affinities , receptor densities and off rates for a number of different ligand - receptor combinations have all been determined successfully .
in each case , even in heterogeneous cell populations from primary sources , useful quantitative information about ligand - receptor interactions was obtained , supporting the applicability of such methodology to studying pharmacology in biopsy samples [ 18,19,22 - 25 ] .
in the case of the insulin c - peptide [ 18,22,23 ] , kavain [ 25 ] and glucocorticoid receptors [ 26,27 ] , the fcs data provided the first direct evidence for the existence of specific cell - surface gpcrs for these ligands .
fcs using purified receptors ligand - receptor interactions were first quantified by fcs using a fluorescently labelled version of alpha - bungarotoxin to label the detergent - solubilised nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from torpedo californica [ 28 ] .
although this study was performed on purified protein , it established the principle that fcs was capable of distinguishing free ligand from bound in a single measurement , based on the differences in their diffusion coefficients .
a number of other similar studies have analysed binding to either membrane vesicles ( e.g. to endothelin and transferrin receptors ) or purified receptors [ e.g. the 5 - hydroxytryptamine - 3 ( 5 - ht3 ) receptor ] [ 29 - 31 ] .
this approach , coupled with molecular brightness analysis , is the basis for the use of fluorescent - fluctuation techniques in high throughput screening [ 32 ] .
in this application , the slower diffusion of individual membrane vesicles , and the increase in molecular brightness as ligand molecules bind to each vesicle , forms the basis for identifying and separating the receptor - bound and free - ligand components .
however , the real power of fcs is in its application to studying ligand - receptor interactions , in conjunction with imaging technology , in single cells .
fcs measurements of receptor - fluorescent protein fusions in living cells since cell - based fcs meaurements have become feasible , one of the most widely used labelling strategies has been to genetically tag the protein of interest with gfp or a related fluorescent protein .
several studies have demonstrated that fcs can measure diffusion of a tagged receptor in the cell membrane directly and yield information about its membrane environment. with respect to gpcrs , the membrane diffusion of the complement c5a [ 33 ] , bradykinin - bk2 [ 34 ] and a1 - adenosine receptors [ 35 ] have all been characterised , as well as the tyrosine kinase - linked epidermal growth factor ( egf ) receptor [ 36 ] .
for the a1 - receptor , a single diffusing species was identified , which was identical to that found for the diffusion of the antagonist - occupied receptor ( see later ) [ 35 ] .
the heterogeneous diffusion of the other receptors was described variously in two to three different populations , suggesting the presence of the receptor in a number of different membrane environments [ 33,34 ] .
agonist - receptor binding in single cells in the majority of examples in which fluorescent ligands have been used to monitor receptor properties , agonist peptide ligands have been used to provide information on the diffusional characteristics of agonist - occupied receptors .
generally , this is because endogenous peptides ( e.g. insulin and galanin ) can be labelled readily .
in addition , the extracellular - facing binding site of the receptor is sufficiently accessible to the ligand that there is less chance of the fluorophore interfering with its pharmacological action .
however , in the case of gpcrs that have low molecular weight ligands , the design of fluorescent ligands is more complex because the binding site is often located within the transmembrane regions of the receptor [ 37 ] .
in many cases , the addition of a fluorophore as large as the ligand itself creates a pharmacological entity that differs significantly in both potency and efficacy to the parent compound [ 35,37,38 ] .
choice of the correct fluorophore ( both from a photophysical and pharmacological perspective ) and an appropriate linker can be crucial to maintaining functional activity [ 24,30,38 ] .
all fcs ligand - binding studies undertaken to date indicate that agonist - occupied receptors can exist in at least two forms within the cell membrane ( indicated generally by taud2 and taud3 , with taud1 representing free ligand ; box 2 , table 1 ) .
these forms might represent receptor present in different membrane domains or associated with different cytoskeletal or scaffolding proteins .
they might also be indicative of different functional forms of the ligand - receptor complex .
the actual diffusion coefficients obtained for these species vary among studies , although their dwell times within the confocal volume fall generally within the 1 - 10 ms range for the faster species ( taud2 ) and more than 50 ms ( taud3 ) for the slower species ( summarized in table 1 ) .
it should be noted , however , that each of these two ' bound ' components might actually be a composite of multiple species with differing diffusion coefficients .
however , the relative amounts of these components differ significantly among receptor types .
for instance , the agonist - occupied galanin receptor exists predominantly as taud2 ( 88 %) [ 19 ] , whereas tetramethyl rhodamine ( tmr ) - egf binding consisted largely of taud3 ( 75 %) [ 17 ] .
binding of two different fluorescent a1 - receptor agonists ( aba - and abea - x - by630 ) to the a1 - receptor consisted of approximately equal amounts of each component [ 38,39 ] .
interestingly , a much higher percentage of the slower - diffusing taud3 component was observed using the same ligand at the closely related a3 - adenosine receptor expressed in the same cell type [ 40 ] .
there is some circumstantial evidence to suggest that these diffusion components might relate to different functional forms of the receptor .
for example , when fcs was used to measure the binding of labelled insulin [ 16 ] , egf [ 17 ] or kavain [ 25 ] to their respective receptors , different affinity states of the receptor appeared to be associated with the different diffusional components .
similarly , when a fluorescent dexamethasone derivative was used to detect cell - surface glucocorticoid receptors in a pituitary cell line , increasing the concentration of the ligand in a range approaching its measured affinity resulted in a shift from predominantly taud2 to predominantly taud3 [ 26,27 ] .
in addition , the non - raft marker , dio , showed a diffusion time comparable with that for taud2 , indicating that the cell - surface glucocorticoid receptor might move from non - raft domains to a more rigid raft - like domain on agonist activation .
some evidence also exists for the conversion of one diffusional component into another following more prolonged agonist stimulation ( e.g. the beta2 - adrenoceptor ) , which might be related to receptor clustering prior to internalisation [ 20,41 ] .
antagonist - receptor binding two studies have used antagonist ligands to measure cell - surface receptor diffusion .
for the 5 - ht3 receptor , antagonist - occupied receptors were also detected in fast - and slow - moving forms [ 42 ] .
the diffusion coefficients obtained appeared to correlate directly with receptor location and the slow - moving component ( taud3 ) was observed predominantly when the fcs detection volume was positioned over receptors that appeared clustered on the cell surface .
the antagonist - occupied a1 - receptor was described predominantly by a diffusion component ( taud2 ) of 15 ms. this was the same as that obtained for the tagged receptor itself [ 35 ] .
our studies using fcs to study the diffusion of the ligand - occupied a1 - receptors are the only ones to have used both an agonist and antagonist ligand in the same cell line [ 35,38,39 ] .
they appear to reveal significant differences between the diffusional properties of the agonist - and antagonist - occupied receptor populations , with the diffusion coefficients for both taud2 and taud3 of the agonist - occupied receptor being significantly faster than those obtained with the antagonist .
in addition , in the case of the agonist , both of these components appeared to be equally sensitive to the displacement by competitor , whereas , for the antagonist , taud3 appeared to be largely resistant to competitor .
however , the most probable explanation for these differences is that agonist and antagonist ligands , under the conditions used in these fcs experiments , are labelling different functional forms of the receptor ( see later and figure 1 ) .
progressing toward domain - specific pharmacology for fcs to achieve the goal of assigning populations of occupied receptors with different diffusion coefficients to specific functional domains , signalling complexes or lipid rafts , the basic ligand - binding techniques described here need to be extended .
fortunately , advances in fcs technology , data analysis and labelling technologies in recent years suggest that this is certainly possible .
localising measurements to specific domains precise positioning of the fcs measurement volume over defined receptor clusters is possible using confocal imaging , as has already been demonstrated for ligand binding measurements on the 5 - ht3 receptor [ 42 ] .
it is , therefore , possible to use domain markers ( separated spectrally from the ligand or receptor tag ) to localise measurements to the domains of interest and to characterise diffusion of the receptors that are co - localised .
such markers have been used previously in conjunction with fcs in artificial systems ( e.g. [ 43 ]) .
more recently , they have been used to label membrane domains in living cells and , subsequently , to measure domain diffusion [ 43 - 45 ] .
for instance , diffusion of lipid - based raft and non - raft markers differed significantly in both rbl and cos - 7 cells [ 43 - 45 ] .
gfp - tagged transmembrance proteins or receptors , known to localise to specific membrane domains , have also been used as domain markers .
for instance , a transferrin receptor - gfp fusion protein ( non - raft ) showed significantly faster diffusion than gfp - thy1 ( known to localise to rafts ) [ 44 ] .
fluorescently labelled cholera toxin b - subunit ( ctx - b ) has also been used to label rafts in live cells [ 43,46 ] .
interestingly , the diffusion coefficients obtained in these experiments are of the same order of magnitude as those found for ligand - occupied receptors in the fcs studies .
these studies also illustrate how the slow movements of strongly anchored domains are not detected easily using fluctuation techniques [ 43 ] .
for example , when the membranes of rbl cells were labelled with fluorescent ctx - b , a strong fluorescence signal was detected , but diffusion of the label could only be seen when the cytoskeleton was disrupted [ 43,46 ] .
this inability to detect effectively immobile particles , such as those anchored strongly to the cytoskeleton , is a limitation of standard fcs analysis .
it stems from the essential requirement of autocorrelation analysis to have fluctuations in fluorescence over time , which are not present if there is limited diffusion within the detection volume .
this can also limit the use of fcs in situations in which there is a large background population of fluorescent but immobile receptors .
detection of fluctuations on such a high background count can be difficult .
techniques such as image correlation spectroscopy ( ics ) and raster ics both use statistical analysis of images to obtain information about particle diffusion .
the analysis used in ics is more readily applicable in the presence of a high background and can , in some cases , actually provide an estimation of an immobile fraction [ 47,48 ] .
information on immobile fractions can also be provided on a macroscopic scale by techniques , such as frap .
the recent development of scanning fcs ( sfcs ) might also help in the detection of very slow moving species [ 49 - 51 ] .
scanning fcs uses a moving illumination volume , scanned over the sample at a fixed velocity , enabling the detection of fluctuations from multiple points on its orbit .
autocorrelation analysis of sfcs data thus enables us to see if the signal is still present each time the beam returns to the same point .
because the orbital velocity of the beam is relatively slow ( ms to s ) , this enables the detection of very slow moving species much more efficiently than standard single - point fcs .
as an example , the application of sfcs to studies on the gfp - tagged bradykinin bk2 receptor , enabled the more accurate determination of a very slow moving receptor population that was not detected using single - point fcs measurements [ 34 ] .
measuring specific receptor species in isolation comparisons of domain diffusion with those of ligand - occupied receptors or receptor - gfp fusion proteins provide some evidence for differences in the localization of , for instance , agonist - and antagonist - occupied receptors .
however , simply showing that a receptor species and a domain have the same diffusion properties does not definitively place the species within that domain .
the assignation of a species to a particular diffusion time is complex because differing domains might possess similar diffusion times and it is unlikely that a specific receptor species will be present in a given domain exclusively. is it possible , therefore , to use fcs - based techniques to monitor specifically the diffusion of particular functional forms of the receptor or specific receptor - protein complexes ?
as illustrated in figure 1 , the particular method used for labelling the receptor in the cell membrane already gives some degree of specificity in terms of the species of receptor that is detected .
for instance , in terms of the cubic ternary complex model of gpcr activation [ 52 ] , using a gfp - tagged version of the receptor itself will provide information about the properties of the total unoccupied receptor population ( r , r * , rg and r * g ; see figure 1 for definitions ). by definition , fcs uses low concentrations of fluorescent ligands and therefore operates at low receptor occupancies .
in the case of an inverse agonist ligand , this will lead primarily to the detection of ar and arg .
likewise , in intact cells in which the gtp concentration is high , low concentrations of agonist will detect ar * predominantly .
this could explain some of the discrepancies seen in table 1 but could also indicate differences in membrane properties of these receptor species .
allocation of such species to the taud2 and taud3 values obtained becomes more feasible in these situations .
in particular , the use of a range of receptor ligands , both agonist and inverse agonist , with varying efficacies and potencies should enable the delineation of taud2 and taud3 and their assignment to different functional forms of the receptor .
some newer and more advanced versions of fluorescence - fluctuation techniques might also help in identifying the diffusion properties of specific receptor - ligand and receptor - protein complexes .
the first of these , two - colour cross - correlation fcs ( fccs ) , uses two overlapping detection volumes , usually provided by two co - focussed lasers of differing wavelengths [ 14,53 ] .
emission from two spectrally distinct fluorophores is separated into two detection channels and the fluorescence fluctuations in each can be autocorrelated .
in addition to this , however , fluctuations can be correlated between the two channels ( cross - correlated ) .
a cross - correlation signal is therefore only obtained when both fluorescent species are present in the volume at the same time and gives an indication of the two species interacting .
this enables both the diffusion coefficient and concentration of the dual - labelled species to be determined .
unlike fret , for instance , fccs does not rely on the proximity of the interacting components to obtain a signal but simply their co - diffusion .
fccs has been used in a number of single cell - based studies , including tracking the dissociation of cholera - toxin subunits [ 46 ] , monitoring the interaction of calmodulin and ca2 +/ calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) [ 54,55 ] , detecting the interaction of the tyrosine kinase lyn with the fcepsilon receptor [ 56 ] , investigating immediate early gene dimerisation [ 57 ] and following caspase - 3 activity [ 58,59 ] .
when applied to the study of gpcrs , fccs will be useful in the specific detection of ligand - occupied receptors and in detecting receptors interacting with signalling partners ( e.g. g - proteins ) , scaffolding proteins ( e.g. clathrin , caveolin ) or other receptors ( e.g. dimerisation ) .
for instance , somatostatin analogues labelled with different fluorophores were used to obtain a cross - correlation signal at the cell membrane , which indicated the presence of receptor dimers [ 60 ] .
fccs is difficult to perform technically but recent improvements in fccs methodology will improve the applicability of this technique to cell - based applications [ 61 - 63 ] .
for instance , in single - wavelength excitation fccs , a single excitation volume is used to excite both fluorescent species , ensuring 100 % overlap in the excitation volumes .
single - wavelength fccs has been used recently to investigate the proportion of dimer formation of the egf receptor in living cells [ 64 ] .
a further method that has been developed recently , bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( bifc ) , could also prove a valuable tool in isolating the diffusion properties of particular receptor complexes ( reviewed in [ 65 ]) .
bifc uses two non - fluorescent fragments of a fluorescent protein , such as yellow fluorescent protein ( yfp ) , which regain their fluorescent properties when reconstituted .
fusion proteins made containing the non - fluorescent n - and c - fragments are constructed , such that fluorescence is only seen when the two proteins are in close enough proximity that reconstitution by complementation of full - length fluorescent protein is obtained .
this enables the detection of specific fluorescent species with a high signal - to - noise ratio and has already been used to monitor the diffusion of gpcr oligomers [ 66 ] and to localise specific combinations of g - protein beta and gamma subunits [ 67,68 ] .
fcs and fccs are based on the temporal analysis of the fluorescence fluctuations , thus providing information about the dwell times of species within the detection volume .
diffusional analysis is limited to some degree , however , because at least a 1.6 - fold change in diffusion time ( corresponding to a 6 - fold change in mass ) is required to reliably differentiate between two species [ 69 ] .
this would not distinguish , for instance , between monomeric and dimeric species of gpcrs based on mass difference alone .
analysis of the fluctuations with respect to the brightness of the fluorescent species , by either photon - counting histogram analysis ( pch ) [ 70 ] or fluorescent - intensity distribution analysis ( fida ) [ 71 ] , however , affords information about particle number and molecular brightness .
this can distinguish heterogenous species that differ by only twofold in their molecular brightness ( e.g. monomer vs dimer ) [ 72 ] .
the existence of a range of oligomer sizes for the egf receptor and the effect of cholesterol on this distribution has been demonstrated recently using fida [ 73 ] .
in other examples , pch analysis has been used to show the formation of higher - order oligomers of the na +/ h + co - transporter [ 74 ] , whereas similar analysis detected dimeric species of membrane - bound adenylate kinase [ 75 ] .
in a similar manner , pch has been used to monitor aggregation of the retinoid receptor and to determine the stoichiometry of its binding [ 76,77 ] .
more recently , the use of two - colour pch in cells raises the possibility that multiple species could be monitored simultaneously using this technique [ 78 ] .
conclusions fcs has already proved a powerful technique for quantifying the diffusion of receptors and ligand - receptor complexes in small areas of living cell membranes .
it gives us new information about the distribution and organisation of membrane receptors and enables such analysis to be performed in heterogeneous cell populations .
a number of recent advances in fcs technologies , such as total internal reflection - fcs [ 79 - 81 ] and the use of nanostructures [ 82 ] , could further increase the axial resolution of these measurements .
coupled with the newer labelling technologies described and the availability of fluorescent ligands with a wider range of affinities , the delineation of the properties of specific receptor - ligand and receptor - protein complexes at a subcellular level is a real possibility .

this diagram , based on the extended ternary - complex model , illustrates the receptor species likely to be present in a cell expressing a receptor ( r ) and a gtp - binding protein ( g ) in the presence of a ligand ( a ) .
the receptor can be present in either inactive ( r ) or active ( r *) conformations , each of which can be found bound to g - protein ( rg and r * g ) , ligand ( ar and ar *) or both ( arg and ar * g ) .
the coloured indicators show the species that are most likely to be detected when different labelling strategies are used for fcs experiments ( see text ) .
green highlights directly tagged gpcrs ( e.g. with gfp ) , which will represent the total ligand - unoccupied receptor population .
blue highlights the low concentrations of ligand used in fcs , at which an inverse agonist is likely to label predominantly the inactive forms of the receptor ( r and rg ) .
red highlights that , similarly , at such low concentrations , an agonist ligand will detect mainly activated receptor ( r * and r * g ) .
however , because the intracellular concentration of gtp is high , any r * g formed will revert rapidly to r * and this will be the predominant form detected .

box 1 basic principles of fcs and autocorrelation analysis fcs uses a small detection volume .
this is created by focussing a laser to a diffraction - limited spot using a microscope objective lens with a high numerical aperture .
positioning of a pinhole in the confocal image plane creates a gaussian - shaped detection volume of approximately 0.25 - 0.5 fl , depending on the excitation wavelength [ e.g. half axes of 0.15 ( lateral ) and 0.75 mum ( axial ) for 488 nm excitation through a 1.2 na objective lens , with the pinhole adjusted to 1 airy unit diameter ] .
as fluorescent molecules diffuse through this volume , they are excited and the emitted photons are detected in a time - correlated manner using a single photon - counting device , such as an avalanche photodiode .
over time , this leads to fluctuations in the detected fluorescent intensity .
these fluctuations can be caused by translational diffusion of the fluorescent species through the volume but also by photophysical events within the fluorophore or changes in its fluorescent properties , such as quantum yield or interstate conversions ( e.g. caused by conformational changes in the labelled species ) [ 13 - 15 ] .
autocorrelation analysis is a way of analyzing the time - dependent changes in the amplitude of these fluctuations about the mean fluorescent intensity .
autocorrelation analysis compares the size of the fluctuation ( deltai ) from the average intensity (< i >) at time t with a subsequent fluctuation at a time t + tau later .
this determines effectively whether the species responsible for the fluorescence is still present in the volume .
using a range of values for tau , results in an autocorrelation function , g ( tau ) , which is usually normalized to the square of the mean intensity (< i >) .
this function yields information about the average dwell time ( taud ) and the average number of molecules ( n ) of the fluorescent species within the volume during the measurement .
the dwell time ( taud ) is obtained from the mid - point of the decay of the autocorrelation function , g ( tau ) .
knowledge of the size of the detection volume ( acquired using a standard of known diffusion coefficient ) can therefore yield the diffusion coefficient of the species , which is related to properties , such as molecular mass , hydrodynamic radius and viscosity of the sample .
in addition , because tau - - > 0 , g ( 0 ) - - > 1 / n , where n is the average number of particles within the detection volume during the measurement. from this value , using knowledge of the shape and dimensions of the detection volume , the absolute concentration of the detected species can be calculated readily .
' n ' and ' taud ' are obtained from the autocorrelation function by non - linear curve - fitting of the data to an appropriate biophysical model , with the choice of model ( e.g. 2d vs 3d , free vs anomalous diffusion ) being crucial to the correct quantification and interpretation of the data. with modern hardware and detection technology , fcs can provide useful information over a large range of fluctuation times ( 1 mus - 500 ms ) and has thus led to its application in a number of fields , ranging from photo - physical investigations and chemical reaction monitoring to cell - based studies on protein diffusion .
the inverse relationship between the autocorrelation function at time zero [ g ( 0 )] and the number of diffusing particles ( n ) results in a greater sensitivity of the technique at lower particle numbers , such that the concentration range that can be used practically with fcs is between 0.1 and 400.0 nm , depending on signal - to - noise ratio of the sample [ corresponding to an average particle number ( n ) of 0.01 - 40.0 ] .
this signal - to - noise ratio , particularly in cells , can be severely affected by non - correlated background signal , such as shot noise or autofluorescence , although this can be accounted for in the biophysical model used .
further artefacts can be introduced by not allowing for the photophysics and photobleaching of the fluorescent label ( figure i ) .
box 2 fcs enables the distinction between free and bound ligand in small areas of cell membrane in complex mixtures , in which two fluorescent species with differing diffusion coefficients are present , their autocorrelation functions ( box 1 ) are simply additive , resulting in a biphasic decay curve for g ( tau ) .
this can yield diffusion coefficients for both species and also enables the calculation of their individual concentrations from their relative contributions to the amplitude of the function .
it is this property of the analysis that proves useful for investigating ligand - receptor interactions .
a free ligand molecule in the vicinity of the cell membrane will show fast 3d brownian diffusion , at a rate corresponding to its molecular mass .
if that ligand binds subsequently to a slow - moving membrane - localised receptor , its diffusion coefficient will be reduced substantially .
therefore , placing the fcs detection volume on the cell membrane will yield an autocorrelation function composed of a fast - moving component ( representing the free ligand diffusion ) and one or more slow - moving components ( representing the membrane - bound ligand ) [ 83 ] .
this is illustrated ( figure i ) with fluctuation data obtained on the upper membrane of cho cells expressing the human a1 - adenosine receptor labelled with a fluorescent antagonist that binds to this receptor ( xac - by630 ) [ 35 ] .
fluorescence fluctuations obtained 5 mum above the cell are produced by fast - moving free ligand alone .
autocorrelation analysis of these fluctuations results in a monophasic decay curve , with a diffusion time showing a single fast - moving component .
the average dwell time ( taud ) of a particular species is determined from the mid - point of the decay of the autocorrelation function [ g ( tau )] .
for example , for the diffusional characteristics of the free ligand in the figure , taud1 is 65 mus .
fluctuations recorded when the volume is placed in a position incorporating both extracellular solution and cell membrane are quantitatively and qualitatively different in their amplitude and temporal nature .
this is owing to the presence of slower moving receptor - ligand complexes ( and possibly non - specifically bound ligand ) .
autocorrelation analysis now reveals a more complex curve showing additional slow moving components representing bound ligand ( taud2 and taud3 ) .
fitting of the autocorrelation function to an appropriate biophysical diffusion model through non - linear curve - fitting enables the proportion of each component present to be calculated .
this information can then be used to calculate the actual concentrations of free ligand and ligand - occupied receptor within the measurement volume .
the quantitative biophysical model used for the curve fitting needs to be appropriate for the system .
in this case , the model used assumed free 3d diffusion of the free ligand and free 2d diffusion of the bound components .
the fitted equation also incorporated terms for particle number , photo - physical fluctuations from the fluorophore and the geometric shape of the volume .
such quantification also relies on a number of other conditions , for instance , low background noise and autofluorescence .
in particular , the free and bound ligand should have identical molecular brightness ( quantum yield ) or the determination of n is skewed heavily toward the brighter species .
under these conditions , fcs measurements are therefore capable of yielding the true free concentration of ligand in the immediate vicinity of the receptor , in addition to the diffusion coefficients and concentrations of any ligand - occupied receptors .

here , we show that both cd4 + and gammadelta17 cells are required for the development of autoimmune arthritis in il - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra ) - deficient mice .
specifically , activated cd4 + t cells direct gammadelta t - cell infiltration by inducing ccl2 expression in joints .
furthermore , il - 17 reporter mice reveal that the vgamma6 + subset of ccr2 + gammadelta t cells preferentially produces il - 17 in inflamed joints .
importantly , because il - 1ra normally suppresses il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells , il - 1ra - deficient mice exhibit elevated il - 1r expression on vgamma6 + cells , which play a critical role in inducing them to produce il - 17 .
our findings demonstrate a pathogenic mechanism in which adaptive and innate immunity induce an autoimmune disease in a coordinated manner .
control of gammadelta t - cell activation remains incompletely understood .
here the authors show that during autoimmune arthritis development alphabeta cd4 + t cells recruit a subset of il - 17 - producing gammadelta t cells to the joints , and that both components are essential to cause pathology in a mouse model of the disease .
interleukin ( il ) - 17 plays important roles in the development of autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , by inducing expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines , recruiting neutrophils and activating t cells and b cells12 .
although helper cd4 + t ( th17 ) cells are well - known producers of il - 17 that contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases , recent studies showed that innate immune cells and innate - like cells are also important sources of il - 17 in local inflammatory tissues34 .
mouse autoimmune disease models have revealed that il - 17 - producing gammadelta t ( gammadelta17 ) cells are an important innate source of il - 17 ( refs 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ) .
in collagen - induced arthritis , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and psoriasis - like skin inflammation , the synergy between gammadelta17 and alphabeta t cells is important for disease development561114 , but it remains unclear how gammadelta17 cells induce tissue - specific inflammation .
gammadelta17 cells share many characteristics with th17 cells .
however , in contrast to th17 cells in which differentiation in the periphery is required for il - 17 production , the functional potential of gammadelta17 cells is already determined during intrathymic development151617 .
these gammadelta thymocytes , which express the transcription factor rorgammat and the signature cytokine receptor il - 23r18 , leave the thymus as functionally committed cells19 .
therefore , gammadelta t cells produce il - 17 directly following stimulation with il - 1beta and il - 23 without t cell receptor ( tcr ) stimulation in the periphery513 .
although the expression of il - 23r on gammadelta17 cells is constitutive5 , expression of il - 1r in the periphery is tissue - type dependent20 .
il1r1 - / - mice or anti - il - 1r monoclonal antibody ( mab ) treatment abrogates il - 17 production in gammadelta t cells1120 , suggesting that il - 1r expression plays a critical role in il - 17 production .
however , the regulatory mechanism of il - 1r expression remains unclear .
in addition to rorgammat , transcription factors such as blk21 , hes - 1 ( ref. 22 ) , nfkappab23 , sox4 and sox13 ( ref .
24 ) are also required for gammadelta17 cell development .
in mice , the tcrgamma locus consists of seven vgamma ( vgamma1 - vgamma7 ) genes that are closely correlated with effector functions , although in most strains vgamma3 is a pseudogene25 .
il - 17 is produced by vgamma4 + and vgamma6 + gammadelta t cells26 ( heilig and tonegawa 's nomenclature27 ) .
although overall gene expression patterns are similar between these two subsets18 , each subset has distinct features .
vgamma6 + gammadelta t cells express the invariant vgamma6 / vdelta1 tcr , develop only in the late - embryonic thymus and preferentially localize in the uterus , vagina , lung , dermis and peritoneal cavity2829 .
on the other hand , vgamma4 + gammadelta t cells have a more diverse tcr repertoire , and develop in both foetal and adult thymus .
subsequently , they circulate in blood and reside in the dermis and secondary lymphoid organs30 .
however , the differences between the pathogenic roles of vgamma6 + and vgamma4 + gammadelta17 cells , particularly the contribution of vgamma6 + gammadelta17 cells to inflammatory diseases , remain unclear .
the mechanism of gammadelta17 cell migration into inflammatory sites is also poorly understood .
recent gene array analysis showed that the expression of chemokine receptors such as ccr6 , ccr2 and cxcr6 is upregulated in gammadelta17 thymocytes18 .
moreover , ccr6 expression is often used as a marker of gammadelta17 cells17 .
however , it remains unknown whether these chemokine receptors function in gammadelta17 cell migration .
il - 1 receptor antagonist ( il - 1ra , gene symbol : il1rn ) is an endogenous inhibitor of il - 1 activity that competes with il - 1alpha and il - 1beta for il - 1r binding .
il - 1ra - deficient ( il1rn - / - ) mice spontaneously develop arthritis in an il - 17 - and t - cell - dependent manner313233 , suggesting that excess il - 1 signalling caused by il - 1ra deficiency induces il - 17 production from t cells and the development of arthritis .
here , we found that gammadelta17 cells are the main producers of il - 17 in joints of il1rn - / - mice , and that recruitment of ccr2 + gammadelta t cells to the joints via induction of ccl2 by cd4 + t cells is important for the development of arthritis .
both vgamma6 + and vgamma4 + gammadelta t cells were recruited to the joints , but only the vgamma6 + subset efficiently produced il - 17 , because il1rn - / - vgamma6 + cells intrinsically expressed high levels of il - 1r due to the loss of downregulation of il - 1r expression by il - 1ra .
these observations provide novel insights into the pathogenic mechanism underlying the development of autoimmune arthritis in il1rn - / - mice .
results gammadelta t cells mainly produce il - 17 in il1rn - / - mouse joints we analysed il - 17 - producing cells in arthritic il1rn - / - mice .
both gammadelta17 cell and th17 cell populations were elevated in draining lymph nodes ( lns ) of affected joints ( fig. 1a,b ) , whereas proportions of il - 17 + cd8 + t cells and il - 17 + dx5 + t cells were unchanged ( supplementary fig. 1 ) .
notably , most joint - infiltrating il - 17 - producing cells were gammadelta t cells , whereas th17 cells were rare ( fig. 1c ) .
moreover , immunofluorescence staining revealed that il - 17 in the joints was primarily expressed in gammadelta t cells ( fig. 1d ) .
these observations suggest that gammadelta17 cells play a pathogenic role in the development of arthritis in il1rn - / - mice .
gammadelta and cd4 + t cells are involved in arthritis development to analyse the pathogenic roles of gammadelta t cells and cd4 + t cells , we injected either anti - gammadelta tcr or anti - cd4 mab into il1rn - / - mice before onset of disease .
both antibody treatments significantly suppressed the incidence of arthritis ( fig. 2a,b ) .
although the severity scores , determined by the swelling and ankylosing changes of the affected ankles of antibody - treated mice , were similar to those of untreated mice ( supplementary fig. 2a,b ) , the microscopic histological scores significantly decreased following treatment with anti - gammadelta tcr mab ( fig. 2c,d ) .
anti - gammadelta tcr mab treatment depleted 70 - 90 % of gammadelta t cells at early time points , but the population gradually recovered ( supplementary fig. 2c ) , probably due to the development of antibodies against this mab .
nonetheless , the anti - gammadelta tcr mab treatment greatly decreased the gammadelta17 population ( fig. 2e ; supplementary fig. 2d ) , suggesting that anti - gammadelta tcr mab effectively depleted gammadelta17 cells , at least at earlier times .
il - 17 production in the gammadelta tcr - population was not elevated in these mice ( supplementary fig. 2d ) .
most populations of cd4 + t cells , including th17 cells , remained depleted in il1rn - / - mice on day 11 after anti - cd4 mab treatment ( fig. 2f ; supplementary fig. 2e ) .
these results suggest that both gammadelta t cells and cd4 + t cells are involved in the development of arthritis in il1rn - / - mice .
however , arthritis developed normally in tcrd - / - il1rn - / - mice ( supplementary fig. 2f ) , and il - 17 - producing cd4 - cd8 - gammadeltatcr - t cells were increased in the lns and joints of these mice ( supplementary fig. 2g ) .
both gammadelta17 and cd4 + t cells collaborate to develop arthritis next , we directly examined the pathogenic role of gammadelta t cells and cd4 + t cells by adoptive cell transfer .
gammadelta t cells derived from cd4 - / - il1rn - / - mice and / or cd4 + t cells derived from tcrd - / - il1rn - / - mice were transferred into scid / scid mice .
we found that scid / scid mice that received transfer of whole - il1rn - / - t cells or a mixture of gammadelta and cd4 + t cells developed arthritis , whereas those that received transfer of gammadelta or cd4 + t cells alone did not ( fig. 2g ) .
instead , development of inflammation was observed in other organs , such as the colon and dermis , when gammadelta t cells alone were transferred ( supplementary fig. 2h ) .
when total t cells or a mixture of gammadelta and cd4 + t cells were transferred , gammadelta17 cells were present in arthritic joints ( fig. 2h ) ; however , no gammadelta t cells were located in the joints when gammadelta t cells were transferred alone .
when cd4 + t cells were transferred , no th17 cells were observed in the joints , although il - 17 - cd4 + t cells were found ( fig. 2h ) .
in contrast to the joints , gammadelta17 and th17 cells were observed in lns of scid / scid mice that received transfer of gammadelta and cd4 + t cells , respectively ( supplementary fig. 2i ) .
thus , il1rn - / - cd4 + t cells are required for the recruitment of gammadelta t cells to the joints , and gammadelta t cells are required for the production of il - 17 .
joint - infiltrating gammadelta17 cells predominantly express ccr2 to analyse gammadelta17 cells in joints , we generated an il - 17 reporter ( il17g / g ) mouse , in which ires - egfp was inserted into the il17a locus without affecting il - 17 production ( supplementary fig. 3a,b ) .
similar to il1rn - / - mice , il17g / gil1rn - / - mice spontaneously developed arthritis ( supplementary fig. 3c ) .
green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) expression correlated with intracellular il - 17 expression in joint - infiltrating cells from il17g / gil1rn - / - mice after phorbol myristate acetate and ionomycin ( p / i ) stimulation ( supplementary fig. 3d ) , indicating that gfp expression accurately reflects il - 17 expression .
consistent with intracellular il - 17 staining in il1rn - / - mice ( fig. 1c ) , joint gfp expression was mostly limited to gammadelta t cells ( supplementary fig. 3e ) .
gfp expression was detectable without any stimulation in joints , whereas only few were detected in lns ( supplementary fig. 3f,d ) , suggesting that gammadelta17 cells were activated in joints .
several chemokine receptors , including ccr2 , cxcr6 and ccr6 , were expressed on joint - infiltrating gammadelta t cells in il1rn - / - mice ( supplementary fig. 4a ) .
in particular , almost all gammadelta t cells expressed ccr2 , but not ccr5 , cxcr4 or ccr9 .
using these il17g / gil1rn - / - mice , we found that about 95 % of gammadelta17 cells expressed ccr2 , and that relatively large proportions of gammadelta17 cells also expressed cxcr6 and ccr6 ( fig. 3a ) .
next , we examined chemokine expression in joints .
consistent with our previous microarray analysis34 , expression of ccl2 ( ligand for ccr2 ) , cxcl16 ( ligand for cxcr6 ) , ccl5 ( ligand for ccr5 ) and cxcl12 ( ligand for cxcr4 ) was significantly elevated in joints of il1rn - / - mice relative to wild - type ( wt ) mice , whereas expression of ccl20 ( ligand for ccr6 ) was unchanged ( fig. 3b ) .
moreover , we detected moderate levels of gammadelta t - cell infiltration in the non - arthritic joints of il17a - / - il1rn - / - mice32 .
in these mice , gammadelta t cells expressed high levels of ccr2 , but not cxcr6 ( fig. 3c ) , indicating that the accumulation of ccr2 + gammadelta t cells is not a result of inflammation .
these observations suggest that the ccl2 - ccr2 axis is involved in the recruitment of gammadelta t cells into joints .
il1rn - / - cd4 + cells induce ccl2 expression in joints ccr2 + gammadelta t cells accumulated preferentially in arthritic joints , but not other organs , of il1rn - / - mice ( fig. 3d ; supplementary fig. 4b ) .
consistent with this , expression of ccl2 ( fig. 3e ) , but not ccl20 ( supplementary fig. 4c ) , was elevated in joints of il1rn - / - mice .
moreover , expression of ccl2 , but not cxcl16 , was specifically elevated in joints of scid / scid mice when il1rn - / - cd4 + t cells , but not gammadelta t cells , were transferred ( fig. 3f,g ) .
thus , activated cd4 + t cells induce ccl2 expression in synovial resident cells and cause migration of ccr2 + gammadelta t cells .
ccl2 recruits gammadelta t cells to joints and induces arthritis to determine whether elevated ccl2 expression in joints causes gammadelta17 cell accumulation and disease development in il1rn - / - mice , we injected anti - ccl2 mab into il17g / gil1rn - / - mice and analysed joint - infiltrating gammadelta t cells .
anti - ccl2 mab treatment significantly suppressed development of arthritis in il17g / gil1rn - / - mice ( fig. 4a ; supplementary fig. 5 ) , suggesting an important role for ccl2 in pathogenesis .
the frequencies of gammadelta t cells and ccr2 + gammadelta t cells were significantly reduced in joints of non - arthritic mice after mab treatment ( fig. 4b - e ) , indicating that ccl2 is responsible for recruitment of ccr2 + gammadelta t cells into joints .
in mab - treated non - arthritic mice , only a few gfp + gammadelta t cells were detected ( fig. 4d,f ) , suggesting a pathogenic role for joint - infiltrating gammadelta17 cells in development of arthritis .
notably , when gfp + gammadelta t cells were gated , ccr2 was expressed at similar levels even in cells from anti - ccl2 mab - treated non - arthritic mouse joints ( fig. 4g,h ) , suggesting that ccr2 expression in gammadelta17 cells is required for the development of arthritis .
on the other hand , the correlation between cxcr6 expression and disease development suggests that cxcr6 expression is a result of inflammation ( fig. 4i,j ) .
these data indicate that ccr2 + gammadelta t cells migrate into joints in response to high levels of ccl2 in il1rn - / - mouse joints , leading to development of arthritis .
il - 1ra suppresses il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells next , we analysed the mechanism of il - 17 induction in gammadelta t cells .
consistent with a previous report35 , il - 23 alone or il - 23 plus il - 1beta induced il - 17 production from magnetic - activated cell sorting ( macs ) - purified splenic gammadelta t cells ( purity : 80 %) ( fig. 5a ) .
however , macs - purified il1a - / - il1b - / - gammadelta t cells or fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) - purified wt gammadelta t cells ( purity : > 99 %) did not respond to il - 23 alone , and il - 1beta was required to induce il - 17 ( fig. 5a,b ) , suggesting that il - 1beta is essential for the il - 17 induction in gammadelta t cells .
consistent with these results , the development of arthritis was completely suppressed in il1b - / - il1rn - / - mice ( supplementary table 1 ) .
we then analysed the effects of il - 1beta and il - 23 on expression of genes encoding transcription factors characteristic of th17 cells , such as rorgammat , roralpha , ikappabzeta and batf .
rorgammat expression in gammadelta t cells was drastically increased by addition of il - 1beta and il - 23 together , but only marginally by il - 1beta or il - 23 alone ( supplementary fig. 6a ) .
a similar effect was observed on roralpha expression .
ikappabzeta and batf were induced by il - 1beta alone , and the increase in their expression was synergistically enhanced by the addition of il - 23 .
il - 23 remarkably increased il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells ( fig. 5c,d ; supplementary fig. 6b ) .
on the other hand , il - 23r was expressed on unstimulated gammadelta t cells from wt , il1a - / - b - / - and il1rn - / - mice , and its expression was not enhanced by the addition of il - 1beta ( fig. 5e ) .
il - 1beta or il - 23 signalling alone was not sufficient for induction of il - 17 ; instead , synergistic activation by il - 1beta and il - 23 was required ( fig. 5f ; supplementary fig. 6c ) .
il - 1r expression induced by il - 23 was suppressed by the addition of exogenous il - 1ra , and il - 1r expression was elevated on il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells ( fig. 5c,d ) , indicating that il - 23 and il - 1ra reciprocally regulates il - 17 production by regulating il - 1r expression .
consistent with the elevation in il - 1r expression , il - 17 production in response to il - 23 and il - 1beta stimulation was higher in il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells than in wt gammadelta t cells ( fig. 5f ; supplementary fig. 6c ) .
il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells were less sensitive than wt gammadelta t cells to inhibition of il - 1r expression by il - 1ra , and the maximum levels of il - 1r expression induced by il - 1beta and il - 23 on wt gammadelta t cells were lower than those on il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells ( fig. 5g ) .
these results indicate that il - 1r expression is abnormally elevated in il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells , resulting in higher il - 17 production in these cells ( fig. 5h ) .
thus , these results suggest that il - 1ra is not merely an antagonist of il - 1r for the binding of il - 1alpha and il - 1beta , but is also an important regulator of il - 1r expression on the cell surface .
vgamma6 + subset is the main il - 17 producer in il1rn - / - joints to identify the gammadelta subset responsible for il - 17 production in il1rn - / - mouse joints , we examined the vgamma subset in joint - infiltrating gammadelta t cells .
proportions of vgamma subsets were analysed using vgamma tcr - specific antibodies except for vgamma6 , because no anti - vgamma6 antibody was available .
we found that gammadelta t cells in the joints consisted of only two major populations : vgamma4 + and an ' other ' population that was stained by none of antibodies against vgamma1 , vgamma2 , vgamma4 , vgamma5 or vgamma7 tcr ( supplementary fig. 7a ) .
we assumed this ' other ' vgamma subset represented vgamma6 + cells , because only vgamma6 + cells are predicted to be unstained by all of these antibodies .
gammadelta t - cell subsets in lns were heterogeneous , but only the vgamma4 + and putative vgamma6 + subsets were capable of producing il - 17 ( supplementary fig. 7b ) .
next , we analysed vgamma subsets in gammadelta17 cells using il17g / gil1rn - / - mice .
an average of 80 % of joint - infiltrating gfp + gammadelta t cells were unstained by anti - vgamma4 and anti - vgamma1 / 2 antibodies ( putative vgamma6 + cells ) , and only 20 % of the population was vgamma4 + ( fig. 6a,b ) .
furthermore , mean fluorescence intensity of gfp was significantly higher in vgamma4 - cells than in vgamma4 + cells ( fig. 6c ) .
furthermore , the putative vgamma6 + cell population of il - 17 + gammadelta t cells ( 63 %) was larger than the vgamma4 + cell population ( 37 %) , as estimated by intracellular il - 17 staining ( supplementary fig. 7c ) .
the proportions of vgamma4 + cells in il - 17 + and in gfp + gammadelta t cells were slightly elevated following p / i stimulation ( supplementary fig. 7c,d ) , probably because gfp as well as il - 17 expression is elevated after p / i stimulation or cell activation233637 , and most vgamma6 + cells were already activated in il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells in vivo .
we also examined vgamma subset composition by measuring vgamma messenger rna ( mrna ) expression using reverse transcription ( rt ) - pcr .
vgamma6 mrna was preferentially expressed in facs - sorted gfp + gammadelta t cells in joints from il17g / gil1rn - / - mice , whereas other vgamma mrnas were also detected in ln gammadelta t cells ( fig. 6d ) , consistent with the results of facs analyses .
vdelta1 mrna was exclusively detected in gfp + gammadelta t cells in joints ( fig. 6e ) , suggesting that these cells are of the canonical vgamma6 / vdelta1 gammadelta t - cell subset38 .
thus , vgamma6 + gammadelta t cells are the major producers of il - 17 in joints of il1rn - / - mice .
il1rn - / - vgamma6 + cells highly express il - 1r intrinsically because both vgamma6 + and vgamma4 + cells were present in joints with high levels of ccr2 expression on the surface ( fig. 7a ) , we asked why il - 17 was preferentially produced by vgamma6 + cells in il1rn - / - mouse joints .
il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells was greatly elevated in both lns and joints of il1rn - / - mice ( fig. 7b ) , and most gfp + gammadelta t cells in il117g / gil1rn - / - mouse joints were il - 1r + ( fig. 7c ) .
this il - 1r + population was mostly vgamma6 + ( fig. 7d ) .
the mean fluorescence intensity of il - 1r was also significantly higher in vgamma6 + cells than in vgamma4 + cells ( fig. 7e ) .
this elevated il - 1r expression was already present in newborn thymic gammadelta t cells from il1rn - / - mice ( fig. 7f ) , and was detected on vgamma6 + ( vgamma4 - , vgamma1 / 2 - , vgamma5 - and vgamma7 - ) cells ( fig. 7g ) .
notably , il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells in newborn thymus correlated with ccr2 expression ( fig. 7h ) .
il - 1beta mrna expression was observed even in joints of wt mice , and was greatly elevated in joints of il1rn - / - mice ( fig. 7i ) .
il - 23 mrna expression in joints was also significantly higher in il1rn - / - mice than in wt mice ( fig. 7j ) .
these observations suggest that joint - infiltrating ccr2 + vgamma6 + il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells , which intrinsically express high levels of il - 1r , preferentially produce il - 17 in response to il - 1beta and il - 23 , resulting in development of arthritis .
discussion here we showed that both cd4 + t cells and gammadelta17 cells are important for development of arthritis in il1rn - / - mice , because antibody - mediated depletion of either gammadelta t or cd4 + t cells suppressed the development of arthritis .
furthermore , upon adoptive transfer , only a mixture of gammadelta t and cd4 + t cells induced arthritis in scid / scid mice .
gammadelta17 cells localized in joints of scid / scid mice when gammadelta t cells were transferred along with cd4 + t cells , whereas gammadelta t cells were not detected in joints when gammadelta t cells were transferred alone .
these observations suggest that gammadelta t cells alone cannot distribute into joints , and cd4 + t cells are required for the localization of gammadelta t cells .
anti - gammadelta tcr mab injection significantly suppressed not only the incidence of arthritis but also the histological severity score , indicating that gammadelta t cells are involved in development of arthritis .
it was recently reported that treatment with anti - gammadelta tcr mab results in internalization of gammadelta tcr rather than gammadelta t - cell depletion39 .
in our hands , however , the gammadelta t - cell population was greatly diminished by treatment with this antibody , indicating that the gammadelta17 population is actually depleted by this antibody .
importantly , the gammadelta17 population was significantly reduced without a compensatory increase in il - 17 + cells in the gammadelta tcr - population , suggesting that the reduction of gammadelta17 cells was not the result of replacement of gammadelta17 cells by hypothetical ' invisible gammadelta t cells'39 .
a reduction in il - 17 production following anti - gammadelta tcr mab treatment was also reported by another group40 .
although we examined the effect of gammadelta t - cell deficiency using tcrd - / - mice , we could not find any effect of this gene mutation on the development of arthritis .
interestingly , we found il - 17 - producing cd4 - cd8 - gammadeltatcr - t cells were increased in the joints of tcrd - / - il1rn - / - mice , suggesting that these cells may substitute for the deficiency of gammadelta t cells to produce il - 17 .
we are now further characterizing these cells .
in il17g / gil1rn - / - mice , most of the joint - infiltrating gammadelta17 cells expressed ccr2 , in association with elevated expression of ccl2 in the joints .
antibody - mediated blockade of ccl2 in il17g / gil1rn - / - mice reduced infiltration of ccr2 + gfp + gammadelta t cells in joints and suppressed the development of arthritis , suggesting that ccr2 + gammadelta17 cell accumulation in the joints , which is critical for the development of arthritis , is mediated by the ccl2 - ccr2 interaction .
the ccl2 - ccr2 axis - mediated gammadelta t - cell migration has also been reported as a protection mechanism against tumours41 .
regarding ccr2 expression , a subset of gammadelta t cells acquires effector functions and expresses il - 17 during intrathymic development1516 , and these thymic gammadelta17 subsets already express some chemokine receptors such as ccr2 , ccr6 and cxcr6 ( refs 17 , 18 ) .
in contrast to gammadelta17 cells in il1rn - / - mice , pathogenic th17 cells expressing ccr6 are recruited to inflammatory sites , such as joints of skg mice42 and the central nervous system of an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model4344 , via the ccr6 - ccl20 interaction .
because we did not observe a significant increase in ccl20 expression in joints of il1rn - / - mice relative to wt mice , the ccr6 - ccl20 axis may not be important for the gammadelta17 cell migration into joints , even though > 50 % of joint - infiltrating gfp + gammadelta t cells in il17g / gil1rn - / - mice also expressed ccr6 .
cxcr6 was also expressed on joint - infiltrating gammadelta17 cells in il17g / gil1rn - / - mice .
however , because this chemokine receptor was not expressed on joint - infiltrating gammadelta t cells in non - arthritic il17a - / - il1rn - / - mice , cxcr6 may not be involved in recruitment of gammadelta t cells , at least under non - inflammatory conditions .
importantly , il1rn - / - cd4 + t - cell transfer induced ccl2 expression in joints of recipient scid / scid mice , suggesting that cd4 + t cells directed the migration of ccr2 + gammadelta t cells .
we rarely detected th17 cells in the inflamed joints , indicating that il - 17 production from cd4 + t cells is not required for pathogenesis in il1rn - / - mice , at least for induction of local inflammation .
therefore , our results show that cd4 + t cells direct the tissue specificity of inflammation , and gammadelta17 cell - derived il - 17 elicits local inflammation and arthritis in il1rn - / - mice .
although the importance of gammadelta17 cells in the development of arthritis in the collagen - induced arthritis model was already suggested by ito et al.13 , the mechanism how these gammadelta t cells are distributed to joints has not been elucidated .
in this report , we first clarified the mechanism how gammadelta t cells are recruited to the inflammatory site .
actually , when gammadelta t cells alone were transferred to scid / scid mice , development of inflammation was observed in other organs , such as the colon and dermis , suggesting the importance of cd4 + t cells for the tissue - specific distribution of gammadelta t cells .
we showed previously that t cells from il1rn - / - mice are hyper - reactive due to the overexpression of cd40l and ox40 on the cell surface , and consequently lose tolerance against self - antigens3233 .
a combination of il - 1beta and il - 23 , but not il - 1beta or il - 23 alone , induces il - 17 in gammadelta t cells without tcr engagement11132035 .
in this report , we showed that il - 23 is required for the induction of il - 1r on gammadelta t cells , and il - 1beta is essential for the induction of il - 17 .
however , il - 1beta alone could not induce il - 17 production in il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells , even though these cells expressed il - 1r , consistent with a report that il - 1beta alone does not induce il - 17 in peritoneum - and lung - derived gammadelta t cells expressing high levels of il - 1r20 .
these observations suggest that il - 23 plays roles , other than upregulating il - 1r , in the induction of il - 17 expression in gammadelta t cells .
in this context , expression of il - 17 signature transcription factors such as rorc , rora , nfkbz and batf was increased by il - 1beta and il - 23 together .
moreover , il - 23 - induced il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells was suppressed by exogenous il - 1ra , suggesting that il - 1ra not only antagonizes il - 1alpha and il - 1beta for il - 1r binding , but also regulates cell - surface expression of il - 1r .
consistent with this , il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells was intrinsically augmented in il1rn - / - mice , making il - 17 production by these il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells hyper - sensitive to the action of il - 1beta and il - 23 .
il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells induced arthritis upon transfer into scid / scid mice .
because il - 1r expression levels induced by il - 1beta and il - 23 were much higher on il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells than on wt gammadelta t cells , endogenous low levels of il - 1ra in the recipients could not suppress il - 1r expression on il1rn - / - gammadelta t cells .
thus , the strict control of il - 1r expression by il - 1ra is important for regulation of il - 17 production in gammadelta t cells .
children with homozygous point mutations or deletions of the il1rn gene develop life - threatening severe inflammatory diseases with prominent involvement of bone and skin after birth4546 .
the population of il - 17 - producing cells is markedly elevated in inflamed skin , and a large amount of il - 1beta is produced in mononuclear cells , as in il1rn - / - mice4546 .
although the pathogenic roles of il - 17 in local inflammation in these patients remain unknown , gammadelta t cells may be involved in the inflammation .
our observation that exogenous il - ra suppresses il - 1r expression on gammadelta t cells may partly explain why treatment with the recombinant il - 1ra anakinra completely resolves symptoms in these affected children4546 .
using il17g / g mice , we showed that il - 17 was preferentially produced in vgamma6 + gammadelta t cells of il1rn - / - mouse joints , although both ccr2 + vgamma6 + cells and ccr2 + vgamma4 + cells were localized in the joints .
these results suggest that il - 17 production capacity differs in these two gammadelta t - cell subsets .
we found that il - 1r expression in joints is much higher on vgamma6 + cells than on vgamma4 + cells , explaining why il - 17 is induced preferentially in vgamma6 + cells in il1rn - / - mice .
this elevated il - 1r expression was observed even in newborn thymus .
notably in this regard , different transcription factors are required for the development of vgamma6 + and vgamma4 + cell subset24 , and vgamma6 + cells acquire the innate capacity to produce il - 17 in the embryonic thymus47 .
therefore , during embryonic development , the level of il - 1r is probably intrinsically higher in vgamma6 + gammadelta t cells than in vgamma4 + cells .
vgamma6 + gammadelta17 cells are thought to be a tissue - resident , long - lived , self - renewing population47 .
although our ccl2 inhibition and transfer experiments suggested that ln vgamma6 + gammadelta t cells capable of producing il - 17 were recruited to joints ( where they induced arthritis ) via ccr2 - ccl2 interaction , development of arthritis was not completely suppressed by treatment with anti - ccl2 mab .
therefore , we could not completely exclude the possibility that these tissue - resident vgamma6 + gammadelta17 cells are also involved in development of arthritis .
gammadelta17 cells have been observed in the peripheral tissues of several inflammatory diseases114849 , and the involvement of gammadelta17 cells is suggested in some autoimmune models5711121324 .
innate immune cell - derived il - 17 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammatory diseases4 .
however , the mechanisms by which these il - 17 - producing gammadelta t cells or innate immune cells are recruited to the inflammatory sites remain largely unknown .
in this report , we showed that cd4 + t cells determine the tissue specificity , and cd4 + t - cell - induced ccl2 recruits ccr2 + vgamma6 + gammadelta t cells to the joints .
therefore , our model may explain how il - 17 - producing gammadelta t cells or innate immune cells infiltrate local tissues and induce inflammation in other autoimmune diseases50 .
taken together , our findings provide important insight into the immunological mechanisms driving tissue - specific autoimmune diseases , and may provide a clue for the development of novel therapies .

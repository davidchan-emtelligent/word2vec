here we report a novel concept that cells can signal chromatin damage from the nucleus back to the surrounding tissue through the cytokine interleukin - 1alpha ( il - 1alpha ) .
thus , in addition to its role as a danger signal , which occurs when the cytokine is passively released by cell necrosis , il - 1alpha could directly sense dna damage and act as signal for genotoxic stress without loss of cell integrity .
here we demonstrate localization of the cytokine to dna - damage sites and its subsequent secretion .
interestingly , its nucleo - cytosolic shuttling after dna damage sensing is regulated by histone deacetylases ( hdac ) and il - 1alpha acetylation .
to demonstrate the physiological significance of this newly discovered mechanism , we used il - 1alpha knockout mice and show that il - 1alpha signaling after uv skin irradiation and dna damage is important for triggering a sterile inflammatory cascade in vivo that contributes to efficient tissue repair and wound healing .
the cytokine interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) is a major mediator of an increasing number of systemic and local inflammatory diseases , but also functions to promote tissue repair and host defense against infection1 .
the il - 1 family consists of 11 members of which il - 1alpha and il - 1beta have similar properties upon binding to the cell surface il - 1 receptor , however they display substantial differences related to their role in disease , tissue repair and immune defense1 .
whereas both proteins are synthesized as precursors , the precursor form of il - 1alpha ( precil - 1alpha ) is , unlike the il - 1beta precursor , highly active and is present in a broad range of healthy cells , especially in skin keratinocytes , epithelial cells of mucosal membranes and also endothelial cells1 .
il - 1alpha can serve as an initiator of the inflammatory process and mediates the initial neutrophil response at the site of inflammation2 , before il - 1beta exerts its role as pro - inflammatory cytokine .
il - 1alpha intracellular levels are upregulated during several stress responses such as hypoxia3 , heat shock4 or uv exposure .
when cells undergo necrotic cell death , precil - 1alpha is immediately released and initiates a pro - inflammatory " alarm signal " to the nearby cells .
due to a nuclear localization signal ( nls ) , the precursor form of il - 1alpha is also found in the nucleus and can act as a dual function cytokine having an intracellular as well as extracellular mechanism of action5 , similar to hmgb1 , il - 33 and il - 376 .
previous studies demonstrated that il - 1alpha interacts with the histone acetyltransferases p300 / pcaf and shows transcription activation capabilities that depend on its n - terminus78 .
despite the fact that il - 1alpha is a prominent " alarmin " released during necrosis , evidence also suggests that il - 1alpha may be secreted by cells that maintain their integrity9 .
for example , heat - shock4 and various genotoxic stresses such as uv radiation10 , dna cross - linking11 , oxidative stress12 and persistent dna damage13 , promote il - 1alpha secretion .
in addition , extensive oxidative dna damage occurs in a number of diseases such as systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) 131415 with accompanying levels of il - 1alpha in patients' serum1617 .
altogether , these reports suggest that cells that have been subjected to non - lethal stress can actively secrete the precursor form of il - 1alpha in addition to its passive release by necrotic cells .
however , up to now , no signaling mechanism or known secretion pathways were shown to link those events .
results and discussion since it had been reported that exposure to environmental factors that cause dna damage may trigger precil - 1alpha secretion410 and affect the progression and severity of inflammatory diseases121415161819 , we examined the possibility that il - 1alpha could transduce signals from the nucleus to communicate chromatin damage to the surrounding tissue .
we first confirmed that dna damage indeed induces the secretion of il - 1alpha precursor .
we used human keratinocytes and fibroblasts containing basal levels of the precil - 1alpha ( supplementary figure 1a ) to monitor the secretion of il - 1alpha after exposure to different genotoxic agents .
as previously reported1113 , we detected increased levels of il - 1alpha in cell supernatants after exposure to various dna damaging agents including h2o2 , uv or bleomycin ( fig. 1a ) .
to gain insight into the intracellular dynamics of il - 1alpha upon dna damage , we next used an il - 1alpha - egfp expressing cell line ( previously used in5 ) and performed time - lapse analysis upon h2o2 treatment .
within 1.5 hours after exposure of cells to sub - lethal doses of h2o2 that generate large scale dna damage , we observed a pronounced localization of il - 1alpha to nuclear foci and an increase in the cytoplasmic il - 1alpha signal ( n = 10 ) ( fig. 1b , supplementary video 1 and supplementary figure 1b ) .
we next treated cells with etoposide , a drug that prevents re - ligation of the dna strands20 and causes dna strands breaks .
interestingly , we found that il - 1alpha can co - localize with phosphorylated h2a.x ( gammah2ax ) foci that mark dna damage sites ( fig. 1c and supplementary figure 1c ) .
when dna was damaged by laser microirradiation , il - 1alpha also co - localized with gammah2ax foci and became enriched at these dna lesions within 5 to 10 minutes ( fig. 1d,e supplementary videos 2 and 3 ) .
furthermore , we observed localization of il - 1alpha at laser - induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers ( cpd ) , also induced by these laser pulses at lambda = 775 nm ( fig. 1f ) .
the il - 1alpha foci after genotoxic stress induction by low uv irradiation ( supplementary figure 2a lower panel ) were distinct from the broad immobile bulk il - 1alpha foci that we previously characterized during apoptosis ( supplementary figure 2a upper panel ) and they are largely excluded from pml bodies ( supplementary fig. 2b ) 5 .
together , this data shows that il - 1alpha can localize to dna damage sites and can be secreted without the loss of cellular integrity .
il - 1alpha can be cleaved by the ca2 + dependent protease calpain or several other proteases , such as ctl / nk - granzyme - b , mast cell chymase or neutrophil elastase , that may increase its biological activity ( providing more adjuvant activity in - vivo , or activation of cells in - vitro ) 21 .
this cleavage is not required for its release from stressed or dying cells or for binding to interleukin receptor - 1 il - 1r11 .
processing of il - 1alpha precursor allows separation of the nls containing domain from the receptor activating mature part of the molecule ; therefore , retention of the protein in the nucleus is prevented .
although cellular stresses can effect the levels of il - 1alpha transcript , it is not clear if they also influence il - 1alpha processing to the mature form which is secreted via the poorly understood , er / golgi - independent unconventional protein secretion pathway1 .
upon the cellular genotoxic stresses conditions used , we could not observe obvious precil - 1alpha processing ( fig. 2a,b ) and also not substantial cell necrosis ( fig. 2c,d ) or major apoptosis ( supplementary fig. 2c ) .
since the function and dynamics of many dna damage response factors and complexes involved in dna repair are regulated by posttranslational modifications ( ptm ) , we examined the possibility that the cytoplasmic localization of il - 1alpha after dna damage is also regulated by ptms .
to investigate the role of ptms in il - 1alpha function we searched for novel il - 1alpha modifications. by using immunoprecipitation ( ip ) , we observed that mouse il - 1alpha protein is strongly recognized by an anti - acetyl lysine ( kact ) antibody ( fig. 3a ) , suggesting a novel il - 1alpha acetylation .
to corroborate this finding and to map the acetylation sites we performed mass spectrometry analysis and detected acetylation of lysine k82 within the il - 1alpha nls ( fig. 3b ) .
to better understand the role of il - 1alpha acetylation , we expressed gfp tagged il - 1alpha mutated on k82 to an arginine ( k82r ) or glutamine ( k82q ) , which are non - acetylatable or an acetylation mimic , respectively .
interestingly , expressing the k82q mutation we detected increased il - 1alpha nuclear signal , whereas the k82r mutant seems to increase the cytoplasmic il - 1alpha signal without affecting overall cellular expression levels ( fig. 3c and supplementary figure 3a ) .
furthermore , the k82r mutation resulted in increased il - 1alpha release from uv irradiated cells , whereas release of the cytokine was lower when il - 1alpha was mutated to k82q ( fig. 3d ) .
together these results strongly suggest that il - 1alpha acetylation can regulate its cellular localization .
histone deacetylase inhibitors ( hdaci ) are widely used as anti - inflammatory agents22 and were shown to suppress il - 1alpha production from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells23 .
we therefore examined the effects of the hdaci trichostatin a ( tsa ) on the localization of il - 1alpha in non - damaged cells .
we found that tsa treatment increased the il - 1alpha nuclear signal and decreased the cytoplasmic signal over time , suggesting that hdacs could play a role in il - 1alpha sub - cellular localization ( fig. 3e and supplementary figure 3b ) .
in addition , histone deacetylase inhibition by tsa reduced the secretion of the il - 1alpha precursor and of il - 6 from lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) activated raw 264.7 macrophages , showing that hdacs may also play a role as regulators of cytokine secretion ( supplementary fig. 3c ) .
furthermore , the kinetics of il - 1alpha ( fig. 1e ) recruitment to dna damage sites resembles the recruitment of hdac1 and hdac224 , where they can deacetylate histone h3k56 and promote dna double strand break ( dsb ) repair .
indeed , using if we found a co - localization of hdac - 1 and il - 1alpha at dna damage sites ( fig. 3f ) suggesting that hdac 's could indeed regulate il - 1alpha acetylation in response to dna lesions and could be implicated in its nuclear / cytoplasmic re - localization .
to assess the potential physiological significance of il - 1alpha in dna damage sensing , we performed immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) on shaved , uv irradiated skin from wt and il - 1alpha ko25 .
despite the fact that cpd staining indicated no obvious differences in dna damage between wt and il - 1alpha ko skin after 18 h ( fig. 4a ) , skin swelling and immune cell infiltration ( fig. 4b ) , which are the hallmarks of uv skin tissue damage26 , were more prevalent in the skin of wt mice ( n = 3 ) .
the fact that infiltration of cells was severely reduced in skin from il - 1alpha ko mice suggests that the " alarmin " activity of il - 1alpha could be important for uv damage - associated skin inflammation .
in accordance with previous reports for il - 1alpha alarmin activity51827 , most of the uv associated inflammatory immune cells recruited by il - 1alpha were neutrophils as suggested by myeloperoxidase ( mpo ) staining ( fig. 4c and supplementary figure s4a ) .
since recombinant il - 1alpha has been reported to enhance epidermal wound healing by stimulating fibroblast and keratinocyte growth and to induce collagen synthesis by fibroblasts in animal models28 , we evaluated whether il - 1alpha deficiency may also affect tissue repair and wound healing in vivo .
in parallel to decreased or delayed inflammation in skin from il - 1alpha ko mice , collagen formation , after its breakdown by uv ( fig. 4d , supplementary and figure s4b ) and expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 ( mmp - 9 ) ( fig. 4e and supplementary figure s4c ) seem to be impaired 18 h post radiation in the skin of il - 1alpha ko mice , suggesting that il - 1alpha deficiency delays wound healing and tissue remodeling after uv induced skin damage .
in addition , il - 1alpha seems to be essential for the expression of several wound healing related genes ( e.g. leptin ( lep ) , cd44 , krt6b , sprr1b , thbs1 and bmp2 ) 29 , since their induction after uv exposure was decreased in il - 1alpha ko mice in comparison to wt mice ( fig. 4f ) .
several of these wound - healing genes are associated with tgf - beta signaling , which is a key regulator of the wound healing response3031 .
overall , our results suggest that the classical cytokine il - 1alpha can also act as an intracellular dna damage sensor and report for cellular genotoxic stress .
this novel mechanism can contribute to downstream tissue repair and wound healing processes and may potentially effect development of autoimmunity or cancer .
the physiological significance of this newly discovered pathway and the role of il - 1alpha in efficient wound healing is supported by the observation that mice lacking either mmp - 932 or the adapter protein of the interleukin - 1 receptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 ( myd88 ) 33 show impaired wound healing .
to date , the accepted immunologic danger model suggest that the immune system discriminates between dangerous and safe signals by recognition of pathogens or " alarm " signals from cells and tissues when cells are disrupted after injury , infection or oncogenic transformation34 .
damage or danger associated molecular patterns ( damps ) which are normally masked by cell compartmentalization are passively released by losing cell membrane integrity ( e.g. traumatic cell death or necrosis ) and activate the innate immune system .
our data adds a new layer to this concept of common danger theory by showing that " alarmins " could also sense and report cellular damage without the need for cell integrity breakdown .
additionally , by identifying acetylation as a novel regulator of il - 1alpha cellular localization and secretion we uncovered a new role for hdac 's in cytokine secretion , a mechanism that may also influence other cytokines .
these findings would help to better understand the anti - inflammatory effects of hdac inhibitors .
indeed hdac inhibitors are now used to treat patients with severe acute graft - versus - host disease ( gvhd ) 35 and systemic onset juvenile arthritis36 where levels of ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha and il - 1alpha drop showing their potential as potent anti - inflammatory or immuno - modulatory effects at non - cytotoxic doses .
our data additionally suggest that blocking il - 1alpha or hdac inhibition may be beneficial for reducing disease severity and symptoms37 in a broad spectrum of diseases with persistent dna damage .
furthermore , uncontrolled il - 1 signaling may lead to acute pathogenesis , chronic diseases , autoimmunity and may promote tumorigenesis121819 .

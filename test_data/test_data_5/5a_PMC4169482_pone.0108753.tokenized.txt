zhi - chao li is only affiliated with # 2 department of pathology and pathophysiology , fourth military medical university , xi'an , people 's republic of china .
dun - quan xu and hai - ying dong should not have been attributed equal contribution to this work .
there are a number of errors in the legend for figure 9 , " effects of tanshinone iia on the expression of skp2 in pulmonary arteries in hph rats. " the complete , correct figure 9 legend is : representative western blot for skp2 protein ( a ) and agarose gel electrophoresis for rt - pcr products of skp2 mrna ( b ) in pulmonary arteries from control and hph rats .

representative western blot for skp2 protein ( a ) and agarose gel electrophoresis for rt - pcr products of skp2 mrna ( b ) in pulmonary arteries from control and hph rats .
beta - actin was used as control .
summarized data are shown in the bottom respectively .
hypoxia significantly increased the skp2 protein and mrna level in pulmonary arteries from hph rats , tanshinone iia significantly reversed the effects of hypoxia on the expression of skp2 (* p < 0.05 vs nomoxia group , # p < 0.05 vs hypoxia group , mean +/ - sem , n = 3 ) .

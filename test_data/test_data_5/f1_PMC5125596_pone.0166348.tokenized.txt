complement dysregulation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) , but the specific mechanisms are incompletely understood .
complement also potentiates retinal degeneration in the murine light damage model .
to test the retinal function of cd59a , a complement inhibitor , cd59a knockout ( ko ) mice were used for light damage ( ld ) experiments .
retinal degeneration and function were compared in wt versus ko mice following light damage .
gene expression changes , endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) stress , and glial cell activation were also compared .
at baseline , the erg responses and rhodopsin levels were lower in cd59ako compared to wild - type ( wt ) mice .
following ld , the erg responses were better preserved in cd59ako compared to wt mice .
correspondingly , the number of photoreceptors was higher in cd59ako retinas than wt controls after ld. under normal light conditions , cd59ako mice had higher levels than wt for gfap immunostaining in muller cells , mrna and protein levels of two er - stress markers , and neurotrophic factors .
the reduction in photon capture , together with the neurotrophic factor upregulation , may explain the structural and functional protection against ld in the cd59ako .

introduction age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among people over 55 years old [ 1 ] .
it has two forms : the non - exudative ( dry ) form , which is more prevalent , and the exudative ( wet ) form , which is more acutely damaging .
although our understanding of contributing mechanisms remains incomplete , genetic and histological evidence indicate that elevated complement activation is involved [ 2 ] .
in addition , oxidative stress has been implicated [ 3 ] .
light - induced photoreceptor degeneration has been studied in experimental animals for over 40 years as a model of oxidative stress - induced photoreceptor degeneration [ 4 - 5 ] .
during light damage ( ld ) , photo - oxidative stress combined with high oxygen tension and a high concentration of easily oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids injures photoreceptor cells .
the complement system has been implicated in ld - induced photoreceptor degeneration .
eliminating the alternative pathway by knockout of complement factor d has been shown to protect photoreceptors from ld in balb / c mice [ 6 ] .
further , complement genes are up - regulated in the retina following light damage [ 7 ] , and complement - expressing microglia / macrophages infiltrate the photoreceptor layer following ld [ 8 - 9 ] .
as a part of innate immunity , complement plays an important role in host defense .
activation of the complement system must be carefully controlled by complement regulatory proteins in the fluid phase and on cell membranes .
cd59 is a membrane complement regulatory protein that is attached to the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) anchor .
cd59 inhibits the formation of c5b - 9 ( membrane attack complex ; mac ) by preventing the binding of c9 to the nascent c5b - 8 complex [ 10 - 13 ] .
cd59 protein is localized to the basolateral surface of retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) cells [ 14 ] .
cd59 expression is relatively low in young and healthy rpe , but later increases with age [ 15 ] .
interestingly , cd59 levels in amd patients are decreased relative to age - matched controls in flattened rpe cells overlying drusen and near regions of geographic atrophy [ 16 ] .
in contrast , choroidal levels remain unchanged .
this reduction in surface rpe expression of cd59 is mimicked in human rpe cells in culture exposed to oxidative stress induced by h2o2 [ 14 ] or by phagocytosis of bisretinoid - laden photoreceptor outer segment fragments [ 17 ] .
furthermore , there is a negative correlation between the amount of mac deposition and the number of rpe cells [ 18 ] .
these results suggest an important role of cd59 in limiting the amount of complement activation in amd .
while knockout of cd59a in mice has not been shown to cause retinal degeneration , it has been associated with upregulation of alternative complement pathway activators in the retina , and especially the rpe [ 19 ] .
herein , we investigated whether constitutive lack of cd59a in cd59ako mice would increase photoreceptor susceptibility to ld. surprisingly , we found protection against ld in cd59a kos and uncovered evidence of retinal pre - conditioning .
materials and methods animals and light exposure male cd59ako balb / c mice , aged 12 weeks , were generated and housed at the university of pennsylvania [ 20 ] .
age - and sex - matched control wild - type ( wt ) balb / c mice were purchased from jackson laboratory ( bar harbor , me , usa ) and maintained in adjacent cages to cd59ako mice in the upenn animal facility for at least one week before light exposure .
the rpe65 variant was checked in genomic dna from cd59ako mice and found to be the same as wt balb / c controls , with leu at amino acid 450 .
all mice were maintained in a temperature - controlled room at 21 - 23 c with a 12 h : 12 h light - dark photoperiod .
for light damage ( ld ) , mice were exposed to 10k lx of cool white fluorescent light continuously for 8 h in a room that was well - ventilated .
during this period , mice had free access to water and a standard laboratory diet .
after light exposure , mice were returned back to normal light / dark cycle for 7 days .
eyes were enucleated after sacrifice at day 7 following ld for morphologic analysis .
euthanasia was performed by ketamine / xylazine administration followed by cervical dislocation .
the euthanasia methods are consistent with the recommendations of the american veterinary medical association ( avma ) guidelines on euthanasia .
a separate set of experiments was performed on c57bl / 6 male and female cd59a deficient mice kindly provided by dr. b. paul morgan ( cardiff university , uk ) [ 21 ] , which were confirmed to be positive for the met variant of rpe65 at amino acid 450 .
these mice were raised at the medical university of south carolina animal facility with a 12 h : 12 h light - dark photoperiod .
for ld , mice were dark - adapted overnight , pupils dilated and exposed to 30k lx of cool white fluorescent light in a well - ventilated room continuously for 4 h. after light exposure , mice were returned to a dark room for 10 days .
experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the association for research in vision and ophthalmology ( arvo ) statement for the use of animals in ophthalmology and vision research .
all protocols were approved by the animal care review board of the university of pennsylvania and the medical university of south carolina .
immunofluorescence mice were humanely euthanized , and eyes enucleated and immersion - fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pfa ) for 10 min .
eyeballs were then rinsed in pbs , and eye cups were generated by removing the anterior segment .
the eye cups were infiltrated in 30 % sucrose overnight and embedded in tissue - tek oct ( sakura finetek , torrance , ca , usa ) .
immunostaining for cd59a was performed on 10 - mum - thick cryostat sections .
the primary antibodies were mouse anti - mouse cd59a ( hm1116 , hycult , pa , usa ) at 1:500 dilution and a mouse - on - mouse polymer ihc kit ( ab127055 , abcam , ma , usa ) was used to optimize signal to background staining ratio .
we used an hrp - conjugated secondary antibody followed by diaminobenzidine to yield a brown precipitate .
rat anti - mouse glial fibrillary acid protein ( gfap ) antibody ( 13 - 0300 , invitrogen , camarillo , ca , usa ) was used at a 1:500 dilution .
gfap antibody was detected using fluorophore - labeled secondary antibodies ( jackson immunoresearch laboratories , inc. , pa , usa ) .
control sections were treated identically but without primary antibody .
the sections were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with identical exposure parameters ( model te300 microscope , nikon , tokyo , japan ) with imagepro software ( media cybernetics , silver spring , md , usa ) .
morphologic analysis eyes enucleated 7 ( balb / c ) or 10 ( c57bl / 6 ) days following ld were immersion - fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde / 2 % glutaraldehyde overnight .
for standard histology , 3 - mum - thick plastic sections were cut in the sagittal plane and toluidine blue - stained as we have described [ 6,22 ] .
the number of nuclei per column of outer nuclear layer ( onl ) photoreceptors was counted in triplicate at four locations , 400 mum away from the onh and 400 mum from the ora serrata , using image analysis software ( imagepro plus 4.1 ; media cybernetics ) to calculate distances from manually set lengths .
quantitative real - time pcr gene expression in the neurosensory retina ( nsr ) samples obtained from cd59ako and wt control mice was analyzed by quantitative rt - pcr as we have described [ 23 ] .
quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) with taqman probes ( abi , grand island , ny , usa ) was performed using a dna amplification / detection system ( prism model 7500 ; abi ) with the deltadeltact method , which provides normalized expression values .
probes used were cd59a ( cd59a , mm01276239 _ m1 ) , rhodopsin ( rho , mm01184405 _ m1 ) , fibroblast growth factor 2 ( fgf2 , mm00433287 _ m1 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf , mm01281449 _ m1 ) , glucose regulated protein 78 ( grp78 , mm00517690 _ g1 ) , and glucose regulated protein 94 ( grp94 , mm00441926 _ m1 ) .
to quantify the expression of target genes , eukaryotic 18s rrna ( hs99999901 _ s1 ) was used as an endogenous control .
the amount of target mrna was compared among the groups of interest .
all reactions were performed on samples from four mice .
for each mouse , technical triplicates were analyzed .
electroretinography electroretinography ( erg ) recordings for balb / c mice followed procedures described previously [ 24 ] .
in brief , mice were dark - adapted overnight and then anesthetized .
pupils were dilated with 1 % tropicamide ( mydriacyl ; alcon ) , and mice were placed on a stage maintained at 37degreesc .
two electrodes made of uv - transparent plastic with embedded platinum wires were placed in electrical contact with the corneas .
a platinum wire loop placed in the mouth served as the reference and ground electrode .
the ergs were then recorded ( espion electrophysiology system ; diagnosys llc , lowell , ma , usa ) .
the apparatus was modified by the manufacturer for experiments with mice by substituting light - emitting diodes with emission maximum at 365 nm for standard blue ones .
the stage was positioned in such a way that the mouse 's head was located inside the stimulator ( colordome ; diagnosys llc ) , thus ensuring uniform full - field illumination .
the flash intensities of rod a - and b - waves are 0.01 and 500 scot cd m - 2s , respectively .
ergs recorded on c57bl / 6 mice were performed according to our published procedures [ 25 ] .
mice were dark - adapted overnight , anesthetized using xylazine ( 20 mg / kg ) and ketamine ( 100 mg / kg ) and pupils were dilated with a drop of phenylephrine hcl ( 2.5 %) and tropicamide ( 1 %) .
body temperature was stabilized via a dc - powered heating pad , and held at 37degreesc .
a needle ground electrode was placed in the tail and a reference needle electrode in the forehead .
erg responses were measured using a contact lens containing a gold - ring electrode [ 26 ] held in place by a drop of methyl cellulose .
ergs were recorded with the utas - 2000 ( lkc technologies , inc. , gaithersburg , md ) system , using a grass strobe - flash stimulus .
the responses were recorded at a gain of 2 k using a notch filter at 60 hz , and were bandpass filtered between 0.1 and 1500 hz. ergs were recorded in response to a single light flash ( 2.48 photopic cd - s / m2 at the dome 's inner surface as calibrated by the manufacturer ; in units of time - integrated luminance ) .
rod a - wave amplitudes were measured from baseline to a - wave trough ; b - wave amplitudes were measured from a - wave trough or baseline to peak of b - wave .
western blotting analysis retinas were dissected and frozen immediately at - 80degreesc , then lysed in ripa buffer plus complete , edta - free protease inhibitor ( roche diagnostics , indianapolis , in ) .
equal amounts of total protein were used per lane .
native samples were used for detection with anti - rhodopsin antibody and denatured samples ( incubated for 10 m at 70degreesc ) were used for detection with anti - kdel antibody .
protein lysates were separated on a 4 - 12 % gradient sds - page gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane .
blocking was achieved by incubation for 1 hour in tris - buffered saline that contained 5 % milk and 0.1 % tween 20 .
membranes were incubated overnight at 4degreesc with anti - rhodopsin antibody ( ab5417 , abcam , cambridge , ma , usa ) at 1:1000 dilution and 4 mug / ml mouse anti - kdel antibodies ( ab12223 , abcam , cambridge , ma , usa ) .
after washes , membranes were incubated with anti - mouse secondary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution ( jackson immunoresearch laboratories , inc. ) and were developed with ecl plus enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ( ge healthcare , chalfont st. giles , uk ) .
anti - actin antibody ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) was used as loading control .
images were acquired with the amersham imager 600 ( ge healthcare ) , and densitometry analysis was performed with image j .
11 - cis retinal regeneration analysis after overnight dark - adaption , pupils were dilated with topical 1 % phenylephrine and 1 % atropine , and the mice were placed in a cubic plastic box lined with aluminum foil ; this design allowed for uniform full - field illumination of the animals .
the light source utilized in experiments used 10 halogen bulbs ( 12 v 50 w each ; bulbtronics , farmingdale , ny ) , and produced ganzfeld illuminance of 4x104 scot cd m - 2 ; the mice were illuminated at this light intensity for 6 s. since the rhodopsin bleach rate in balb / c mice in a ganzfeld is of 8.3x10 - 6 s - 1 ( scot cd - 1 m2 ) - 1 [ 27 ] , in our experiments ( illuminance of 4x104 scot cd m - 2 ) , the rhodopsin bleach rate was 8.3x10 - 6x4x104 s - 1 ~ 3 s - 1 , and the corresponding time constant was ~ 0.3 s , so a 6 s illumination guaranteed photoisomerization of > 99.99 % of rhodopsin .
after illumination , mice were euthanized at predetermined time points , and their eyes were flash frozen in dry ice .
retinoid extractions for analysis of retinoid content in the course of regeneration after illumination was performed following a modified lipid - extraction protocol [ 28 ] as we described and validated previously [ 29 ] .
one or two frozen mouse eyes were placed in a centrifuge tube on dry ice , 180 mul dissection medium was added ( vol / vol : 60 % meoh , 30 % chloroform , 10 % 1 m nh2oh ; ph 7 ) , the eyes were minced , and medium was added to 0.6 ml final volume .
samples were cooled on dry ice for 3 to 5 m , and sonicated with a microtip probe ( 30 pulses at 0.3 power and 0.1 duty cycle ; branson , danbury , ct ) .
temperature in the sample was monitored with a bat - 10 digital thermometer equipped with an ht - 1 thermocouple ( physitemp , clifton , nj ) ; at the end of sonication , it did not exceed 150degreesc .
chloroform ( 200 mul ) was added , samples were vortexed for 5 s , then 250 mul of water was added , and samples were vortexed and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 m. the chloroform ( lower ) phase was collected , dried under nitrogen , and dissolved in hexane ( 200 mul ) .
normal phase hplc analysis of retinoids was performed on a model 1100 hplc system equipped with multidiode array detector and chemstation software ( agilent , palo alto , ca ) in the following system : supelcosil lcsi analytical column ( 4.6 x 150 mm , 3 - mum particle size , sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo ) and 92.5:7.5 n - hexane / ethyl acetate mobile phase .
the retinoids eluted were identified by their absorbance spectra .
all chemicals were from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo ) .
all procedures were performed under dim red light .
rhodopsin measurements retinas from dark - adapted mice were collected under dim red light .
the samples were prepared according to our previously published method [ 30 ] .
in short , tissues were homogenized in 500 mul pbs containing 1x protease inhibitor ( sigma - aldrich ; st. louis , mo ) .
samples were centrifuged ( 27,000x g , 15 min ) , the supernatant discarded and the remaining pellet solubilized in 1 % dodecylmaltoside ( in sodium phosphate buffer , ph 7.4 ) .
the sample was shaken at 4degreesc for 2 h , centrifuged ( 88,000x g for 10 min ) , and measured on a softmax pro spectrophotometer ( varian ; palo alto , ca ) .
the difference spectra were determined from measurements before and after bleaching with white light .
the concentration of rhodopsin was calculated using the following extinction coefficient : epsilon ( rhodopsin ) = 40,600 l.mol - 1.cm - 1 .
rpe phagocytosis assay via immunostaining with anti - rhodopsin antibody rpe phagocytosis was assessed using an established procedure described in detail previously [ 31 ] .
briefly , eyes were enucleated from mice sacrificed 1 or 2.5 h after lights turned on or 1 h after lights turned off and immediately immersion fixed in davidson 's fixative ( 33 % ethanol , 22 % formalin , and 11.5 % acetic acid ) .
following removal of the anterior segment , eye cups were embedded in paraffin .
7 - mum - thick microtome sections were de - paraffinized .
rpe melanin pigment was bleached by incubation for 2 min in fresh 1 % sodium borohydrate solution before immunostaining .
sections were incubated in mouse anti - opsin n - terminus antibody clone b6 - 30 ( a kind gift from paul hargrave , university of florida , gainesville , fl [ 32 ]) followed by alexafluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody ( life technologies , carlsbad , ca ) .
dapi was used to counterstain nuclei .
sections were mounted in vectashield ( vector laboratories , burlingame , ca ) .
image z - stacks were acquired by recording x - y images 0.25 mum apart on a leica tsp5 laser scanning confocal microscopy system .
opsin - positive phagosomes were counted in maximal projections of image stacks representing exactly 5 - mum tissue depth and averaged per length of retina .
statistical analysis the means +/ - standard errors were calculated for each comparison pair .
p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all experiments .
statistical analyses for erg , qpcr , retinoid profile analysis , as well as pixel density quantification for immunostaining and western analysis bands were performed in graphpad prism 6.0 ( san diego , ca , usa ) using the student 's two - group , two - sided t - test .
comparison of onl thickness ( nuclei ) was performed with one - way analysis of variance with post hoc pairwise comparisons using bonferroni adjustment .
phagosome counts were evaluated using one - way anova and tukey 's post hoc tests to establish significant differences between time points .
results cd59a is expressed in mouse retina , rpe and choroid in the mouse , two cd59 genes have been identified [ 33 - 34 ] .
cd59a is expressed broadly in various tissues , whereas cd59b is only expressed in the mouse testis [ 33 - 34 ] .
our immunostaining results showed that cd59a is present in all layers of nsr , as well as in the rpe and choroid ( fig 1b ) , but not in negative control cd59ako retinas ( fig 1c ) .
this localization is consistent with previously published results [ 35 ] , now adding the ko control .
the mrna level of cd59a was more than 60 - fold higher in nsr compared to isolated rpe cells of wt mice ( p = 0.0003 ) , but not detectable in cd59ako samples ( fig 1d ) .

cd59ako mice are resistant to ld light damage experiments were performed in both balb / c and c57bl / 6j cd59ako mouse strains .
at day 7 following ld in balb / c wt mice , we observed severe thinning of the onl and loss of photoreceptor inner / outer segments ( is / os ) .
in comparison , balb / c cd59ako mice had a thicker onl and better preserved photoreceptor is / os after ld ( fig 2a ) .
counting of onl nuclei at four different retinal locations in the balb / c strain revealed no significant difference in onl thickness between non - light - damaged wt ( nld , black line in fig 2b ) and non - light - damaged cd59ako mice ( blue line ) across all retinal regions a - d. in contrast , there were significantly fewer onl nuclei in light - damaged wt retinas ( ld , green line ) compared to nld wt ( black line ) .
likewise , there were significantly fewer onl nuclei in ld cd59ako retinas ( red line ) relative to nld cd59ako ( blue line ) .
comparing ld cd59ako retinas ( red line ) to ld wt retinas ( green line ) , there was partial preservation of onl nuclei in the cd59ako .
in a parallel experiment with c57bl / 6 mice , at day 10 following ld , we observed photoreceptor cell death in wt mice , which was mitigated in cd59ako retinas ( fig 2c ) .
however , in contrast to the non - pigmented balb / c strain , there was a small but significant reduction in onl thickness in c57bl / 6 nld cd59ako mice ( blue line in fig 2c ) compared to nld wt ( black line ) .

in wt retinas on both the balb / c and c57bl / 6 background , there was a significant decrease of onl thickness across all sampled retinal regions ( a - d ) comparing non - light - damaged ( nld ) ( black line in b and c ) and ld ( green line in b and c ) .
however , there was a smaller reduction of onl thickness comparing nld ( blue line in b and c ) and ld cd59ako retinas ( red line in b and c ) .
data are expressed as means +/ - sd. n = 4 .
* p < 0.01 , and significance markings refer to overall differences between groups across all four retinal regions ( a - d ) .
retinal erg responses in cd59ako mice are reduced before ld but preserved after ld full - field erg was employed to evaluate retinal function in the two cd59ako strains .
in both genetic backgrounds , pre - light exposure cd59ako mice showed reduced rod a - and rod b - wave amplitudes compared to their respective pre - ld wt ( fig 3a and 3b ) .
at day 7 after ld , however , balb / c cd59ako mice had significantly higher amplitude rod a and b - waves relative to wt mice ( fig 3a ) .
consistent with results from the balb / c strain , there were no differences in erg responses of c57bl / 6 cd59ako 10 days after ld compared to the significant reduction in c57bl / 6 wt mice ( fig 3b ) .
this observed ~ 50 % reduction in erg amplitudes in pre - ld cd59ako c57bl / 6 mice relative to wt is unlikely to have been caused exclusively by the thinning of the onl in nld cd59ako mice ( fig 2c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0166348.g003 fig 3 erg responses before and after ld. before ld , rod - a ( p < 0.05 ) and rod - b ( p < 0.05 ) waves were decreased in cd59ako balb / c mice compared to wt ( a ) .
at day 7 after ld , however , rod - a ( p = 0.04 ) and rod - b ( p = 0.01 ) waves were all larger in cd59ako compared to wt ( a ) .
data are expressed as means +/ - sd. n = 4 .
similarly , rod - a ( p < 0.05 ) and rod - b ( p < 0.01 ) wave amplitudes were smaller in cd59ako c57bl / 6j mice compared to c57bl / 6j mice at baseline , and while c57bl / 6j mice have diminished erg amplitudes 10 days after ld , amplitudes in cd59ako mice remain unchanged ( b ) .
data are expressed as means +/ - sd. n = 6 - 7 .
rhodopsin levels and 11 - cis retinal regeneration in cd59ako mice anatomic and functional protection against light damage can be due to significantly slower 11 - cis retinal regeneration or a reduction in visual pigment levels ( i.e. , less substrate for light to interact with and cause phototoxicity ) .
to examine these possibilities , 11 - cis - retinal regeneration as a percentage of total retinoids was measured at several time points after bleach in balb / c cd59ako mice ( fig 4a , s1 and s2 tables ) .
no difference was observed in regeneration between cd59ako and wt , implying that the visual cycle was not affected by loss of cd59a .
next , rhodopsin protein levels in balb / c wt and cd59ako mice were measured via western - blotting analysis ( fig 4b ) , and rhodopsin levels in balb / c cd59ako retinas were significantly lower relative to wt ( fig 4c , p = 0.03 ) .
rhodopsin concentration per retina was also measured by microspectrophotometry in c57bl / 6 mice ( fig 4d ) .
consistent with results of western analysis from balb / c mice , c57bl / 6 wt mice contained 250 +/ - 13.1 pmol of rhodopsin per retina while cd59ako mice contained only 150 +/ - 16.5 pmol ( p = 0.001 ) .

rpe phagocytosis of spent photoreceptor outer segment fragments is normal in cd59ako mice long - term photoreceptor cell function relies on continuous photoreceptor outer segment renewal , which is dependent on a balance between outer segment growth and shedding of distal outer segment tips .
shed photoreceptor outer segments are phagocytosed by rpe cells in a diurnal fashion , peaking shortly after light onset .
outer segment renewal can be assessed by quantifying the phagosome load of the rpe , which was assessed in this study by immunostaining tissue sections with an antibody against rhodopsin ( fig 5a ) .
here , we quantified the frequency of rhodopsin - positive phagosome inclusions within the rpe as a function of time of day .
c57bl / 6 cd59ako mice showed a clear peak of rpe phagosome load 1 h after light on , with levels returning to baseline by 2.5 h after light on , and maintained at 1 h after light off ( i.e. , 13 h after light on ) ( fig 5b ) .
these results suggest that outer segment renewal takes place and follows a diurnal rhythm in cd59ako mice as is characteristic for wt mice with a normal photoreceptor outer segment renewal program [ 36 ] .

gfap is up - regulated in cd59ako retinal muller cells protection against light damage could also be due to preconditioning generated by the gene defect , a phenomenon we have observed in the past in brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) knockout mice [ 37 ] .
in order to assess the potential for muller cell activation by cd59ako , nld retinal sections were immunostained with an anti - gfap antibody .
in wt retinas , specific gfap staining was confined to the retinal nerve fiber layer astrocytes ( fig 6 , compare c to a ) .
however , gfap was increased in muller cells of cd59ako retinas ( fig 6d ) .
measurement of pixel intensity confirmed higher gfap levels in nld cd59ako retinas compared to nld wt controls ( fig 6b , p = 0.03 ) .

neurotrophic factors and er - stress are up - regulated in cd59ako retinas we further assessed retinal stress by determining levels of er - stress markers via qpcr .
two er stress markers , grp78 and grp94 , were both up - regulated in nsr from balb / c nld cd59ako mice compared to nld wt ( fig 7a ) .
neurotrophic factors fgf2 and vegf were also up - regulated in balb / c nld cd59ako retinas ( fig 7b ) .
consistent with the qpcr result , grp78 and grp94 protein levels were also significantly higher in nld cd59ako retinas compared to levels in wt retinas in both balb / c ( fig 8a and 8b ) and c57bl / 6 mice ( fig 8c and 8d ) .

neurotrophic factor genes , fgf2 ( p < 0.01 ) and vegf ( p = 0.03 ) , also were significantly up - regulated in cd59ako retinas ( b ) .
mrna levels were also measured for three members of the neuropoietic cytokine family known to have retinal neuroprotective effects : ciliary neurotrophic factor ( cntf ) , interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , and leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) .
mrna levels for all three factors appeared lower in cd59ako relative to wt retinas , with significant differences in il - 6 ( p < 0.01 ) and lif ( p < 0.001 ) expression ( c ) .
data are expressed as means +/ - sd. n = 4 .

comparison of the levels of grp78 ( p = 0.02 ) and grp94 ( p = 0.01 ) showed higher levels in cd59ako ( b ) .
similarly , both grp78 ( p = 0.03 ) and grp94 ( p < 0.01 ) were increased in retinas of cd59ako - c57bl / 6 mice ( c and d ) .
data are expressed as means +/ - sd. n = 3 .
to elucidate the mechanism of reduction in erg amplitudes and rhodopsin expression in nld cd59ako retinas , we considered changes in expression of various factors .
ciliary neurotrophic factor ( cntf ) has been shown to decrease erg amplitudes and rhodopsin expression when up - regulated [ 38 ] .
in addition , interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) and leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) are members of the same neuropoietic cytokine family as cntf with similar retinal neuroprotective effects observed in other contexts [ 39 - 40 ] .
in our study , the mrna levels for all three factors appeared lower in cd59ako relative to wt retinas , with significant differences in il - 6 ( p < 0.01 ) and lif ( p < 0.001 ) expression ( fig 7c ) .
discussion herein , we found that cd59a is expressed in all layers of the nsr , and also in the rpe and choroid .
in the absence of cd59a , photoreceptor sensitivity to light is reduced and the retina undergoes a stress response indicated by increased levels of er - stress gene ( grp78 and grp 94 ) mrnas , muller cell gfap expression , and neurotrophic factor ( ffg2 and vegf ) expression .
these responses to cd59ako are associated with decreased photoreceptor susceptibility to ld. this diminished ld in cd59akos was discovered independently in two separate labs on two genetic backgrounds ( br using c57bl / 6 and jld using balb / c ) .
regarding differences between the two strains , c57bl / 6 mice are more resistant to ld because the pigment in the rpe cells exerts a protective effect by absorbing light and because the rpe65met450 isoform in this strain regenerates 11 - cis - retinal more slowly .
our observation that , unlike in the balb / c strain , there was no significant decrease in onl thickness after ld in c57bl / 6 cd59ako mice ( fig 2c ) is consistent with this phenomenon .
previous studies have shown that cd59a is expressed in both human and mouse retinas and rpe cells [ 35,41,42 ] .
our results reproduced these findings and , in addition , showed that cd59a mrna levels in the nsr were more than 60 - fold higher than in rpe cells .
these results suggest cd59a may play an important mac - inhibitory role in the nsr .
in this study , we found that cd59ako mice at baseline ( before ld ) had lower erg amplitudes than their age - matched and genetic background - matched controls .
this reduction in erg amplitudes was , however , not due to a significant loss of photoreceptors or abnormality in photoreceptor outer segment renewal , but rather due to reduced sensitivity of the photoreceptors to light .
cd59ako rod photoreceptors exhibited lower levels of rhodopsin , but important rpe functions in support of photoreceptors such as 11 - cis retinal regeneration and diurnal rpe processing of phagocytosed outer segment tips were normal , suggesting that the loss of cd59a may have caused changes in the nsr rather than the rpe .
in support of the hypothesis that some optimal level of complement activation is required for full retinal functionality , eliminating both activators and inhibitors in the complement cascade have been shown to decrease retinal function .
previously , we have shown that in mice lacking complement factor b ( a required activator of the alternative pathway of complement ) , both rod and cone erg amplitudes were reduced by 20 - 30 % across all light intensities by 9 months of age [ 43 ] .
in these mice , there was no loss of cells in the onl or inl , but rather a reduction in opsin and rpe65 gene expression .
similar reductions in erg amplitudes have been reported for mice lacking the anaphylatoxin c3a receptor ( a g - protein - coupled receptor required for chemotaxis ) and complement component c3 ( a central component required for all three complement activation pathways ) [ 44 ] .
finally , elimination of complement factor h ( an inhibitor in the alternative pathway ) has resulted in significantly reduced visual acuity and rod erg amplitudes in aged mice [ 45 ] .
it will be of great interest to determine the beneficial effects of optimal complement activation in ocular tissues in the context of different genetic backgrounds on tissue homeostasis , retinal structure , function , and pathology [ 46 ] .
as discussed in the recent review by wenzel and colleagues , light - damage induced by short exposures to bright white light ( as was used in our experiments ) requires the visual pigment rhodopsin as an essential trigger of the cell death mechanism [ 47 ] .
hence , the reduced amounts of bleachable rhodopsin in the presence of normal rates of pigment regeneration observed in the cd59ako mice could be responsible for their reduced sensitivity to light damage .
the search for neuroprotective agents for photoreceptors has uncovered many pathways and mechanisms that play a role in this process .
one of those mechanisms is pre - conditioning .
liu and colleagues [ 48 ] have demonstrated that exposure of animals to 12 hours of bright light 48 hours prior to bright light damage significantly protected the rat retina from photoreceptor degeneration .
this preconditioning was correlated with an increase in neuroprotective factors fgf2 and cntf .
in agreement , mice with reduced levels of the neurotrophic factor bdnf ( bdnf +/ - ) are protected against light damage [ 37 ] .
these mice have increased levels of glial - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) mrna prior to ld , and have shown preservation of neurotrophin levels after ld. we speculated in that manuscript that " chronic reduction of bdnf in the retina provides a level of preconditioning against stress " .
our findings in the present study of increased mrna levels and proteins indicative of er stress , muller cell gfap , and neurotrophic factors such as fgf2 in cd59ako retinas further support this notion of constitutive retinal preconditioning .
to further explore the mechanism of preconditioning , we considered the following members of the neuropoietic cytokine family : cntf , il - 6 , and lif .
none of the three factors was up - regulated in cd59ako retinas , suggesting that they are not responsible for the observed decrease in erg amplitudes and rhodopsin expression in the cd59ako mice .
cd59a is a mac - inhibitory protein , also called membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis .
it prevents c9 from binding to the preformed c5b - 8 complex on the cell membrane , and hence prevents formation of the final complement membrane attack complex .
although we cannot measure mac directly in our study due to unavailability of effective mac detection assays suitable for mice , we hypothesize that the absence of cd59a leads to increased mac formation .
prolonged or high levels of mac formation may result in cell lysis , whereas short or low levels of mac formation may result in sub - lytic effects .
however , the lack of retinal degeneration in the cd59ako mouse may serve as yet another example of redundancy in the complement system .
in the absence of cd59a , other inhibitors of the terminal pathway appear to limit mac activation .
those might include protein s , a vitamin k - dependent plasma glycoprotein [ 49 ] , and clusterin [ 50 ] , a protein also known to be associated with the clearance of cellular debris and apoptosis [ 51 ] .
interestingly , clusterin expression is increased in light - induced retinal degeneration [ 52 ] .
how might sub - lytic activation of complement in the absence of cd59a lead to changes in photoreceptor cell function and subsequent protection against light damage in the nsr ?
previous studies in vascular endothelial cells revealed that mac - induced reversible changes in cell membrane permeability lead to altered concentrations of cytosolic ions .
these changes , in turn , lead to cellular proliferation triggered by release of growth factors [ 53 - 54 ] .
similarly , cell - membrane pore formation by sub - lytic mac on photoreceptors may lead to sodium and calcium ion influx , partly depolarizing ( light - adapting ) the photoreceptor , which could limit light - induced hyperpolarization .
this could be a reason for reduced erg response in nld cd59ako retinas .
studies on the effects of sub - lytic mac on the plasma membrane of the rpe suggest that mac can also affect the behavior of this cell type .
sub - lytic mac assembly on rpe cells generates a pro - inflammatory microenvironment , including increased rpe production of il - 6 [ 14,55,56 ] .
in photoreceptors , rhodopsin levels are diminished by the il6 related cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif ) [ 57 ] .
thus , mac - induced il - 6 upregulation may contribute to the observed rhodopsin down - regulation in cd59ako mice .
in summary , our data highlight the importance of cd59a for retinal function .
they also indicate that stress caused by cd59ako affords partial protection against an acute insult in the form of damaging light .
this protection may result from diminished rhodopsin levels , upregulation of stress response genes , or both .

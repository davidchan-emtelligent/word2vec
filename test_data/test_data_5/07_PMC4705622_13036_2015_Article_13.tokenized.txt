the publisher apologises for any inconvenience caused. fig. 1 overview .
a partially overlapping dna fragments are transformed into yeast cells together with a linearized plasmid backbone , or fused together by pcr , seamless or gibson assembly prior to the transformation .
homologous recombination ( hr ) enables the fusion of the dna fragments without pretransformation assembly .
b the assembled plasmid insert contains 4.5 kb dna encoding two expression units , the tef1 promoter driving kanr expression , and the tdh3 promoter driving a fusion of the trp1 and gfp genes .
the insert has dna sequences at the ends that are homologous to the ends of the linearized plasmid backbone ( not shown ) .
assembly success was tested when the insert was broken into two , three , four or five fragments with short or long regions of homology to neighboring fragments or the linearized rs416 plasmid .
the transformation used 2 ng or 20 ng of total dna , including the linearized plasmid .
the linearized plasmid dna was added at the pre - transformation step for seamless and gibson assembly fig. 2 charts illustrating the overall success rate and the success rates for each assembly method under different conditions .
success is defined as a 95 % hypergeometric probability or higher that at least one of three clones screened carry a fully functional plasmid .
the fraction of failed tests is indicated in grey .
the fraction of successful tests is subdivided into different colors to indicate the method used .
a all tests .
overall success rate : 65 % .
individual method success rates : 44 / 56 / 73 / 81 % for hr alone , pcr , seamless and gibson , respectively .
b tests with 20 ng transformed dna .
overall : 75 % .
methods : 63 / 75 / 83 / 79 % .
c tests with 20 ng transformed dna and long regions of overlap between dna fragments .
overall : 87 % .

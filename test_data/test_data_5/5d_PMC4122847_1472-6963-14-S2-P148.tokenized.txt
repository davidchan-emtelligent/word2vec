in this model , the cms plays the pivotal role of procurement , storage and warehousing of all health commodities before they are distributed to the next level in the supply chain .
challenges with technical and organization capacity at the cms level has led to longstanding difficulties in creating sustainable performance improvements in several countries .
in mozambique , the central medical store ( central de medicamentos e artigos medicos - cmam ) receives significant us government support ( through usaid ) for both health commodities and technical assistance .
we tested the effectiveness of a pbf scheme between cmam and usaid , to improve the functioning of the cms in mozambique .
materials and methods in january 2013 , usaid entered into a year - long government to government grant arrangement that conditions disbursement of tranches of usaid support on specific results at cmam .
the disbursements would take the form of a fixed amount reimbursement award ( fara ) of up to $ 125,000 per quarter ($ 500,000 per year ) if cmam could demonstrate meeting quarterly targets on six performance indicators .
these indicators were related to planning , distribution , and warehouse management .
the aim of the pbf program was to spur innovation , hard work and improve warehousing .
we hypothesized that the incentive would lead to improvements through three pathways : 1 .
improved staff motivation and morale due to individual or group bonus payments 2 .
improved collaboration between and within cmam departments due to the need for cooperation among departments in order to achieve the performance targets , and 3 .
increased targeted investments in infrastructure , systems and human resources , due to the additional funds available to cmam through the grant .
indicators were selected in areas where change had previously been difficult to achieve , where baseline data could be collected , where performance was entirely under cmam 's control , and for which measurable targets could be set and achieved within 1 year of the program .
baseline data was collected in the last quarter of 2012 .
results and conclusions we found improvements in all indicators over one year .
matching records of stock status reports and physical counts improved from 70 % at baseline to over 85 % by 2013 .
there were improvements in picking accuracy , order cycle times and distribution planning .
the incentive led to better collaboration between cmam departments .
we found process improvements due to the pbf scheme , possibly leading to increased availability of health commodities .

donor t cell transfusion , which is a long - standing approach to prevent allograft rejection , operates indirectly by alteration of host t cell immunity .
we therefore hypothesized that adoptive transfer of immune regulatory host th2 cells would represent a novel intervention to enhance cardiac allograft survival .
using a well - described rat cardiac transplant model , we first developed a method for ex vivo manufacture of rat host - type th2 cells in rapamycin , with subsequent injection of such th2.r cells prior to class i and class ii disparate cardiac allografting .
second , we determined whether th2.r cell transfer polarized host immunity towards a th2 phenotype. and third , we evaluated whether th2.r cell therapy prolonged allograft viability when used alone or in combination with a short - course of cyclosporine ( csa ) therapy .
we found that host - type th2.r cell therapy prior to cardiac allografting : ( 1 ) reduced the frequency of activated t cells in secondary lymphoid organs ; ( 2 ) shifted post - transplant cytokines towards a th2 phenotype ; and ( 3 ) prolonged allograft viability when used in combination with short - course csa therapy .
these results provide further support for the rationale to use " direct " host t cell therapy for prolongation of allograft viability as an alternative to " indirect " therapy mediated by donor t cell infusion .
introduction clinical interventions to prolong cardiac allograft survival have relied primarily on long - term post - transplant administration of calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine a ( csa ) for suppression of host t cells that mediate rejection [ 1 ] [ reviewed in [ 2 ]] .
however , long - term calcineurin inhibitor therapy is typically only partially effective and the t cell immune deficiency predisposes to life threatening infection and malignancy [ reviewed in [ 3 ]] .
as such , new approaches in transplantation seek to limit patient exposure to calcineurin inhibitors and to promote immune tolerance through either pharmacologic or cellular interventions [ reviewed in [ 4 ] , [ 5 ]] .
" donor specific tolerance " was observed when recipients of t cell - containing , third - party blood transfusion prior to clinical organ transplantation were found to have a reduced incidence of graft rejection [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
recent animal model experiments have demonstrated that the reduction in graft rejection through donor t cell infusion occurs " indirectly " through modulation of host t cells [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
most recently , in a murine model of transplantation tolerance , donor regulatory t ( treg ) cells contained within transferred blood products were found to induce naive host t cells to adopt a treg phenotype [ 11 ] .
as such , various t cell transfer methods that result in the modulation of host t cell populations represent a general approach to prolong allograft survival .
recently , we have shown that donor t cells polarized into a th2 phenotype modulate host t cells towards a th2 phenotype , thereby preventing graft rejection in a murine model of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
based on this background , we now project that host th2 cell adoptive transfer may represent a " direct " pathway to prolong solid organ allograft viability .
host t cell therapy would be particularly useful for cardiac allograft recipients due to the lack of cadaveric donor t cells .
in addition , rat cardiac allograft rejection has been characterized as a th1 - type process [ 14 ] , and therefore predictably amenable to th2 cell therapy , which we have shown to be capable of modulating th1 - type transplantation responses [ 12 ] .
towards this aim , we tested our hypothesis in a well - characterized rat cardiac allograft transplantation model .
in murine models of graft rejection [ 12 ] and graft - versus - host disease [ 15 ] , we found that adoptive transfer of th2 cells that were manufactured ex vivo in rapamycin (" th2.r cells ") were more effective than control th2 cells ; the increased in vivo efficacy of th2.r cells is likely due to their rapamycin - induced anti - apoptotic phenotype , which permits prolonged in vivo t cell persistence [ 13 ] .
in light of these data , we hypothesized that adoptive cell therapy using host - type th2.r cells may represent a novel approach to modulate host immunity towards a th2 phenotype for prolongation of solid organ transplant survival .
results ex vivo manufacture of rat cd4 + th2 cells with or without rapamycin there are no reports in the literature pertaining to the ex vivo manufacture of rat th2 cells in the presence of rapamycin ; as such , we first evaluated if rat cd4 + t cells could be polarized to a th2 phenotype during rapamycin exposure .
in previous experiments evaluating th2 cell therapy in the context of murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , we identified an effective strategy whereby cytokine polarization occurred ex vivo in a polyclonal manner , with subsequent acquisition of allosensitization in vivo [ 16 ] ; as such , for these studies , we performed cytokine polarization in the context of polyclonal co - stimulation .
co - stimulation and il - 4 priming in the presence or absence of rapamycin resulted in t cells expressing a th2 phenotype , as defined by minimal ifn - gamma secretion ( fig. 1a , panel i ; fig. 1b , panels i , ii , iii ) and high levels of il - 4 secretion ( fig. 1a , panel ii ; fig. 1b , panel iv , v , vi ) .
relative to control th2 cells (" th2 ") , rapamycin treated th2 cells (" th2.r ") secreted higher amounts of il - 4 ( p < 0.05 for supernatant assay in fig. 1a ; p = 0.03 for i.c. flow cytometry assay in fig. 1b ) .
control th2 cells and th2.r cells each had minimal expression of the treg transcription factor , foxp3 ( fig. 1c ; percent cd4 + foxp3 + expression , mean +/ - sem , th2 vs. th2.r : 2.0 +/ - 0.5 vs. 0.5 +/ - 0.6 ) .
as such , ex vivo rapamycin enhanced host t cell th2 polarity without promoting a treg phenotype .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0018885.g001 figure 1 characterization of rat th2 cells .
cd4 + t cells were isolated and expanded using anti - cd3 and anti - cd28 co - stimulation in the presence of rhil - 2 , rril - 4 , and rhil - 7 either with rapamycin (" th2.r ") or without rapamycin (" th2 ") for 3 days .
( a ) expanded th2 and th2.r cells were subjected to repeat co - stimulation , and the 24 h supernatant was tested for cytokine content using multiplex bead array .
( b ) after repeat co - stimulation , th2 and th2.r cells were evaluated for intra - cellular expression of ifn - gamma and il - 4 by flow cytometry .
( c ) on day 3 , cells were harvested and intra - cellular flow cytometry was performed to evaluate foxp3 transcription factor expression .
results are a summary of n = 10 cultures .
th2.r cell therapy combined with csa therapy reduces t cell activation during allograft challenge and augments post - transplant th2 polarity expanded host - type th2.r cells were infused intravenously into recipient ( host - type ) rats following cardiac transplantation surgery at day 0 .
cohorts received the allograft either alone (" allograft ") or in combination with : csa for 28 days ( csa 28 ) ; csa for 18 days ( csa 18 ) ; th2.r cells ; or th2.r cells plus ( csa 18 ) .
at the final day 28 post - transplant endpoint , recipients in the rejection control cohort that did not receive csa or th2.r cells had low frequencies of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + t cells ( fig. 2a top panels ) and had high frequencies of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 - activated effector t cells ( fig. 2a , bottom left panel ) and cd8 + cd25 + foxp3 - activated effector t cells ( fig. 2a , bottom right panel ) in the spleen , inguinal lymph nodes , and mesenteric lymph nodes. by comparison , recipients of daily subcutaneous csa therapy had undetectable levels of activated effector cd4 + and cd8 + t cells .
statistical analyses were performed , with comparison of each experimental cohort to the rejection control cohort .
relative to rejection controls , recipients of a short - course of csa alone , th2.r cells alone , or the combination of short - course csa plus th2.r cells had decreased frequencies of effector cd4 + and cd8 + t cells ; as such , both csa and th2.r cell infusion reduced in vivo host t cell activation during allograft challenge .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0018885.g002 figure 2 host th2.r cell infusion prolongs cardiac allograft survival .
rat allogeneic cardiac transplants was performed and assigned to one of five treatment cohorts , including : no drug and no cell therapy (" rejection control ") ; 28 - day daily cyclosporine a therapy [" csa ( 28 );" engraftment control ] ; th2.r adoptive cell therapy alone on the day of transplant [" th2.r ( d0 )"] ; 18 - day , short - course csa therapy alone [" csa ( 18 )" ; experimental control ] ; or a combination of short - course csa plus th2.r cell therapy [" csa ( 18 )+ th2.r ( d0 )"] .
( a ) at day 28 post - transplant , recipients were euthanized and spleen , inguinal lymph nodes , and mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested .
the frequency of activated cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in each cohort at each organ site was then determined by flow cytometry ( percent of cd4 + or cd8 + t cells that co - expressed cd25 in the absence of foxp3 expression ; results are mean +/ - sem of 3 evaluated per cohort ; * , indicates p <= 0.05 ; ** , indicates p <= 0.005 ) .
cells harvested at day 28 post - transplant were co - stimulated ( b ) or allo - stimulated ( c & d ) , and the 24 h supernatants were tested for cytokine content by multiplex assay .
next , we evaluated the cytokine profile of the various cohorts at day 28 post - transplant ; post - transplant t cell cytokine production was induced after polyclonal stimulation using co - stimulation ( fig. 2b ) and by syngeneic and allogeneic antigen - presenting - cell ( apc ) stimulation to determine allospecific cytokine secretion ( fig. 2c ) .
upon co - stimulation and allogeneic apc activation , spleen and lymphoid cells isolated from recipients of short - course csa or the combination of short - course csa plus th2.r cells had increased secretion of il - 4 relative to spleen and lymphoid cells isolated from recipients of either continuous daily csa therapy or th2.r cell therapy alone ( fig. 2b and 2c , respectively ) ; the mechanism ( s ) whereby short - course csa consistently increased post - transplant il - 4 secretion capacity is not clear and was not addressed in our experiments .
the rejection control cohort secreted low levels of il - 4 .
as such , whereas daily csa therapy suppressed the host th2 response , short - course csa and th2 cell transfer promoted th2 immunity .
furthermore , infusion of th2.r cells in the context of short - course csa therapy reduced post - transplant t cell capacity to secrete ifn - gamma in both a polyclonal and an allospecific manner ( fig. 2b and 2c , respectively ) .
evaluation of th2.r cell therapy timing and rapamycin co - administration further experiments were performed in host - type bn rats to optimize th2.r cell therapy .
we hypothesized that infusion of host th2.r cells one or two weeks prior to the allogeneic transplant might induce more marked host skewing towards a th2 state , thereby enhancing a th2.r cell protection against graft rejection .
in lieu with our prior finding that murine th2.r cells were relatively resistant to in vivo rapamycin drug therapy [ 17 ] , we also hypothesized that pre - transplant co - administration of rapamycin might further augment the host th2 state .
indeed , at day 7 after host th2.r cell infusion , there was a dramatic increase in host capacity to secrete il - 4 ( fig. 3a ) ; however , co - administration of rapamycin actually abrogated this host th2 shift. of note , host immunity was not significantly polarized at day 14 after th2.r cell infusion ; as such , further experiments focused on an anti - rejection strategy incorporating th2.r cell infusion at day - 7 pre - transplant .
seven days after treatment with cd4 + th2.r cells , no significant increase in foxp3 + t cells was observed ( fig. 3b ) .
both host cd4 + and cd8 + t cells were enriched for il - 4 secretion capacity ( fig. 3c ; representative flow plot panel i gated on cd8 + t cells and ii gated on cd4 + t cells ; summary iii and iv ) ; as such , similar to our previous work in murine models , the adoptive transfer of highly purified rat cd4 + th2.r cells resulted in the transfer of th2 immunity to other host t cell populations. of note , th2.r cell induction of host cd4 + and cd8 + t cell il - 4 secretion was inhibited by rapamycin co - administration .
th2 skewing was confirmed by the ability of the host cd8 + t cells to secrete il4 .
furthermore , seven days after host th2.r cell infusion , we observed a marked decrease in host cd4 + t cell capacity for ifn - gamma secretion ( fig. 3c ; v ) .
interestingly , rapamycin drug therapy did not reduce cd4 + t cell ifn - gamma secretion in a statistically significant manner .
in addition , th2.r cells or rapamycin did not significantly alter ifn - gamma secretion capacity within host cd8 + t cells ( fig. 3c ; vi ) .
since rapamycin was not permissive for th2 polarization in our system , further experiments tested th2.r cell therapy in the setting of csa rather than rapamycin drug therapy .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0018885.g003 figure 3 evaluation of th2.r cell timing and rapamycin co - administration .
host - type bn rats received an intravenous infusion of isogeneic th2.r cells either at day - 7 or day - 14 prior to host euthanasia at " day 0 " , with subsequent immune evaluation ; th2 cell therapy was administered either alone or in combination with in vivo rapamycin therapy .
( a ) harvested spleen , inguinal lymph node , and mesenteric lymph node cells were harvested and subjected to co - stimulation ; resultant 24 h supernatants were then tested for cytokine content by multiplex assay .
( b ) % foxp3 expression was measured using ic flow on splenocytes at day7 ( c ) after co - stimulation , cd4 + and cd8 + t cells from recipients in each cohort were evaluated by intra - cellular flow cytometry for ifn - gamma and il - 4 production .
* indicates p < 0.05 ; n = 5 per cohort .
th2.r cell therapy combined with short - course csa therapy prolongs cardiac allograft viability we next evaluated host - based th2.r cell therapy in a stringent , 28 - day model of allograft rejection that utilized csa for only the initial 10 days post - transplant .
at day 28 post - transplant , as anticipated , recipients of daily csa ( through day 28 post - transplant ) had reduced cd8 + t cell activation in the spleen , inguinal lymph nodes , and mesenteric lymph nodes relative to recipients of short - course csa ( fig. 4a ; top panels ) .
remarkably , host th2.r cell infusion plus short - course csa also reduced cd8 + t cell activation at these tissue sites to levels comparable with daily csa therapy ; in general , this cd8 + t cell inhibition occurred whether th2.r cells were administered at day - 7 , day 0 , or day - 7 plus day 0 .
however , th2.r cell infusion without short - course csa did not inhibit cd8 + t cell activation .
in marked contrast to these cd8 + t cell results , csa therapy and / or th2.r cell therapy did not significantly alter cd4 + t cell activation ( fig. 4a ; bottom panels ) ; it is possible that the substantial cd4 + t cell activation in th2.r cell recipients reflects activation of the adoptively transferred th2.r cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0018885.g004 figure 4 th2.r cell therapy plus cyclosporine reduces host t cell activation , induces a host th2 phenotype , and reduces intra - cardiac allospecific t cells .
rat allogeneic cardiac transplants were performed and assigned to one of eight treatment cohorts , including ; 28 - day daily cyclosporine a therapy [" csa ( 28 )" ; engraftment control ] ; th2.r adoptive cell therapy alone (" th2.r ") at day 0 ( d0 ) , day - 7 ( d - 7 ) or both ( d - 7 + d0 ) ; 10 - day , short - course csa therapy alone [" csa ( 10 );" experimental control ] ; or a combination of short - course csa plus th2.r cell therapy [" csa ( 10 )+ th2.r "] at day 0 ( d0 ) , day - 7 ( d - 7 ) or both ( d - 7 + d0 ) .
( a ) at day 28 post - transplant , transplant recipients were euthanized and splenocytes were harvested .
the frequency of activated cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in each cohort at each organ site was then determined by flow cytometry ( percent of cd4 + or cd8 + t cells that co - expressed cd25 in the absence of foxp3 expression ; results are mean +/ - sem of 5 or 7 evaluated per cohort ; * , indicates p < 0.05 ) .
splenocytes were harvested and subjected to either co - stimulation ( b & c ) or syngeneic and allogeneic apc stimulation ( d & e ; allospecific cytokine secretion is shown ) ; resultant 24 h supernatants were then tested for cytokine content by multiplex assay .
( f ) the frequency of activated cd4 + and cd8 + t cells in harvested cardiac tissue was determined by flow cytometry ( percent of cd4 + or cd8 + t cells that co - expressed cd25 in the absence of foxp3 expression ; results are mean +/ - sem of 7 evaluated per cohort ; * , indicates p < 0.05 ) .
( g ) intracardiac t cells were subjected to stimulation with allogeneic dendritic cells ; resultant 24 h supernatants were then tested for cytokine content by multiplex assay .
( h ) survival of cardiac allografts between various cohorts is shown .
next , we evaluated the in vivo cytokine profile at day 28 post - transplant .
spleen cells from recipients of daily csa therapy secreted very low levels of ifn - gamma in a polyclonal manner ( fig. 4b ) or in an allospecific manner ( fig. 4d ) .
in contrast , spleen cells from recipients of either short - course csa alone or th2.r cells alone had increased polyclonal and allospecific secretion of ifn - gamma. of note , multiple infusions of th2.r cells ( both day - 7 and day 0 ) prior to transplantation resulted in a decrease in ifn - gamma secretion relative to recipients of a single dose th2.r cells .
recipients of short - course csa plus th2.r cells ( independent to th2.r cell timing ) had decreased polyclonal and allospecific ifn - gamma secretion relative to recipients of short - course csa alone .
relative to recipient of short - course csa alone , recipients of short - course csa plus th2.r cell infusion had an increase in allospecific il - 4 secretion ( fig. 4e ) ; this increase in allospecific il - 4 secretion was observed in each of the three cohorts to receive th2.r cells .
interestingly , limited differences was noted in il - 4 secretion between cohorts on polyclonal stimulation ( fig. 4c ) .
furthermore , at day 28 post - transplant , we tested for the presence of activated t cells within the cardiac allografts .
as anticipated , recipients of short - course csa alone had a high frequency of activated cd4 + and cd8 + t cells infiltrating the graft ( fig. 4f ) ; by comparison , recipients of daily csa had minimal evidence of intra - cardiac activated t cells .
relative to recipients of short - course csa alone , recipients of th2.r cell therapy in combination with short - course csa therapy had reduced frequencies of intra - cardiac activated cd8 + t cells .
interestingly , th2.r cell therapy reduction in the frequency of intra - graft activated cd4 + t cells was modest relative to cd8 + t cells ; however , marked reductions of intra - graft activated cd4 + t cells were observed in recipients of th2.r cells on day 0 of transplant .
most importantly , intra - cardiac t cells from th2.r cell recipients had greatly reduced capacity to secrete ifn - gamma in an allospecific manner relative to recipients of short - course csa ( fig. 4g ) .
as anticipated , the control group that received short - course csa universally had non - viable cardiac allografts by day 28 post - transplant ( fig. 4h ) ; recipients of th2.r cells alone also universally had nonviable allografts .
administration of daily csa predictably increased the incidence of clinical graft viability ( graft viability frequency , 85 %) .
remarkably , recipients of short - course csa combined with th2.r cells at day 0 , day - 7 , or day - 7 plus day 0 were also generally protected from graft failure ( graft viability frequencies : 86 % , 100 % , 100 % , respectively ; table 1 ) .
haematoxylin and eosin staining obtained at day 28 post - transplant demonstrated that recipients of short - course csa , who had poor allograft viability , had severe myocardial necrosis and a dense mononuclear cell infiltration ( fig. 5a ) .
in contrast , recipients of short - course csa combined with host th2.r cell therapy had minimal myocardial necrosis in the setting of substantial mononuclear cell infiltration ; importantly , recipients of short - course csa plus th2 cells on day 0 of transplant had a statistically significant reduction in rejection by standard histology criteria ( fig. 5b ). of note , recipients of th2 cells at day - 7 plus day 0 of transplant or day - 7 of transplant , who had 100 % graft viability , did not have reduced histology scores .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0018885.g005 figure 5 th2.r cell therapy plus cyclosporine prolongs cardiac allograft survival .
allograft recipients were monitored for cardiac viability through the 28 - day post - transplant period of observation .
rejection and engraftment control cohorts received a 10 - day short - course of cyclosporine a [" csa ( 10 ]" or a daily 28 - day course of " csa [ csa ( 28 )"] .
other cohorts received either no cyclosporine a or short - course csa ( 10 ) in combination with th2.r cell therapy at day - 7 [" th2.r ( d - 7 )" or " csa ( 10 )+ th2.r ( d - 7 )"] , day 0 [" th2.r ( d0 )" or " csa ( 10 )+ th2.r ( d0 )"] , or day - 7 plus day 0 [" th2.r ( d - 7 + d0 )" or " csa ( 10 )+ th2.r ( d - 7 + do )"] .

discussion utilizing a well - characterized experimental rat cardiac transplantation model , we have shown that allograft viability can be prolonged by direct modulation of host immunity via adoptive t cell therapy using rapamycin - generated th2 - type cells .
these data add to the growing body of information relating to cellular approaches to rejection prevention , and squarely places an emphasis upon use of host t cell populations as an alternative to indirect modulation of host immunity via third - party donor cell infusions .
importantly , as a step towards potential clinical translation , we have determined that host th2 - type cell adoptive transfer is efficacious when used in combination with calcineurin inhibitor therapy , which remains the standard of care therapy .
reports more than 30 years ago determined that donor - specific [ 18 ] or third - party [ 19 ] transfusions reduced solid organ transplantation rejection through a phenomenon termed donor - specific - tolerance .
however , further clinical advances with respect to use of adoptive cell therapy for rejection abrogation did not ensue , in part because the mechanism ( s ) underlying transfusion - induced tolerance have not been fully characterized and in part because adoptive cell therapy is only now becoming a burgeoning translational medical approach [ 20 ] .
it has long been proposed that modulation of host t cell immunity might be harnessed to promote graft tolerance , including an early study of " host t cell vaccination " prior to experimental transplantation [ 21 ] ; however , further investigations into host derived t cell based engraftment strategies have been limited .
extensive mechanistic data exists on donor specific tolerance [ 11 ] , [ 14 ] where adoptive transfer of ex vivo generated host treg cells prevents allograft rejection [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
although focus has been placed upon host tregs for cellular induction of transplantation tolerance [ reviewed in [ 24 ] , [ 25 ]] , other host t cell populations such as cd4 - cd8 - " double - negative " t cells have been shown to facilitate engraftment [ 26 ] .
in this context , our current results using host - type , rapamycin - generated th2 cells indicate that a diversity of functionally - defined host t cell subsets represent candidate populations to prevent solid organ graft rejection .
the current study is the first to demonstrate that the adoptive transfer of th2 polarized host t cells represents a candidate approach to prolong cardiac allograft viability .
although enthusiasm for the potential role of th2 responses for the regulation of th1 - mediated solid organ rejection has waned with the resurgence of treg cell research [ reviewed in [ 27 ]] , several previous studies have supported a beneficial role of th2 cells in cardiac transplantation models , including : evidence that type ii cytokines help promote ' infectious tolerance ' [ 28 ] ; modulation of the th1 / th2 balance via icam / lfa blockade [ 14 ] ; and treg cell up - regulation of il - 4 and th2 responses during infectious tolerance [ 29 ] .
in our studies , the phenotype of the ex vivo , rapamycin - generated host t cell population was consistent with an effector th2 phenotype , as indicated by prolific secretion of il - 4 , a high precursor frequency of cells capable of il - 4 secretion , and minimal expression of the treg cell transcription factor , foxp3 .
these results stand somewhat in contrast to other ex vivo results that described rapamycin to promote treg cell differentiation [ 30 ] , but are consistent with our murine results that have identified a capacity to generate either effector th1 and th2 populations in rapamycin depending upon polarizing cytokine exposure [ 17 ] , [ 31 ] .
most importantly , the adoptively transferred t cells mediated a th2 - type response in vivo , as evidenced by : increased post - transfer il - 4 secretion ; reduced post - transfer ifn - gamma secretion ; and minimal induction of foxp3 - expressing t cells .
we also observed that recipients of the cd4 + th2.r cells were enriched for post - transplant cd8 + t cell capacity for il - 4 secretion capacity ; this result indicates that the post - transplant th2 polarization induced through th2.r cell infusion could be attributable not only to the infused th2 cell product but also to the transfer of th2 polarity to endogenous t cells .
similar to our previous observations in murine bone marrow transplant models that utilizing donor - derived th2.r cells [ 15 ] , [ 32 ] , we also observed that host adoptive th2 cell therapy significantly reduced the number of post - transplant cd8 + t cells in secondary lymphoid organs ; given the major role for host cd8 + t cells in mediating cardiac allograft rejection [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , we speculate that th2 - mediated control of cd8 + t cell immunity may account in part for allograft survival effect we observed in this model .
it is interesting to note that th2.r cell infusion alone did not achieve post - transplant skewing towards a th2 phenotype , whereas th2.r cell infusion plus short - course csa consistently yielded increased post - transplant il - 4 and reduced post - transplant ifn - gamma .
we speculate that csa therapy is limiting the expansion of the host th1 - type rejection response , thereby allowing expansion of the infused th2 cells ; in the absence of csa , the th2 cells may be inhibited by a predominant th1 response .
our results stand somewhat in contrast to previous studies that found tc2 cells [ 35 ] or il - 4 [ 36 ] to be detrimental to graft survival .
we speculate that our use of purified cd4 + t cells that secreted high levels of il - 4 may help account for the positive results we achieved with a type ii cytokine strategy ; further experiments will be required to clarify specific molecular mechanisms that account for the th2.r cell therapeutic effect .
it should be mentioned that our model utilizes a relatively short recipient follow - up for assessment of allograft viability , and as such , the effect of the th2 cell strategy on long term allograft viability would require further study [ 37 ] .
we observed that both the long - term immune suppression cohort and the short - course suppression plus th2.r cohort each had prolonged allograft viability ; therefore , from these experiments , we can not conclude that one strategy is advantageous relative to the other .
rather , we conclude that short - course suppression plus infusion of a t cell modulation population such as the host th2.r cells may represent an alternative to long - term immune suppression .
determination of the relative risks and benefits of each approach would require further comparative studies in additional models .
it is important to point out that , in spite of the increase in cardiac viability in th2.r cell recipients , such recipients did not have a reduction in the rejection score by standard histology criteria .
it should be noted that the rejection score is based heavily on mononuclear cell infiltration ; because we found that th2.r cell recipients had relatively dense intra - cardiac t cell infiltration by cells that did not secrete allospecific ifn - gamma , it is possible that in the context of interventions such as host - type th2.r cell transfer , cardiac infiltration by mononuclear cells alone may not accurately predict rejection .
finally , it should also be noted that we did not assess the impact of th2.r cell infusion on alloantibody formation , which can play an important role as a mediator of kidney allograft rejection [ reviewed in [ 38 ]] .
infusion of host - type th2.r cells one week pre - transplant optimally promoted host th2 - type immunity at the time of transplant and preserved allograft viability in 100 % of recipients .
since the th2.r cell product was generated in high - dose rapamycin , we predicted that the th2.r cells may be relatively resistant to the effects of in vivo rapamycin , thereby further promoting an in vivo th2 shift ; however , to the contrary , co - administration of rapamycin drug therapy abrogated the ability of th2.r cells to polarize host immunity towards a th2 phenotype .
in our previous murine studies , we did observe that ex vivo rapamycin resistance does not necessarily confer resistance to rapamycin in vivo [ 17 ] ; such observations may be due to rapamycin blockade of non - t cell pathways in vivo , such as antigen - presenting - cell populations [ 39 ] that may help drive t cell expansion in vivo .
furthermore , we also determined that administration of rapamycin did not increase foxp3 + regulatory t cells in vivo .
in contrast to these results using in vivo rapamycin , we found that cyclosporine therapy was permissive for the immune modulatory effect generated through th2 cell therapy .
as such , although experimental models indicate that rapamycin has more tolerance - induction properties relative to cyclosporine therapy [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] , our data indicate that calcineurin inhibitor therapy may be preferentially utilized in the setting of polarized th2.r cell therapy for solid organ allografting .
it is also important to note that infusion of th2.r cells on the same day as cardiac allografting was sufficient to prolong allograft survival ; this lack of requirement for pre - infusion of th2 cells would be advantageous for clinical translation because of the unpredictability of cardiac allograft availability .
in conclusion , the adoptive transfer of ex vivo generated , rapamycin - resistant host th2 - type cells represents an effective new approach to the prolongation of cardiac allograft viability .
these data support the current momentum in the field to develop adoptive cell therapies for tolerance induction in a calcineurin - inhibitor sparing manner , and suggests that functionally - defined and cytokine - polarized effector t cells , as well as treg cells , may contribute to the future armamentarium to protect against solid organ allograft rejection .

heterotropic cardiac transplantation brown - norway ( bn ) rats served as recipient and dark agouti ( da ) rats served as allograft cardiac donor .
allogeneic cardiac transplantations were performed using a modified version of the heterotopic cardiac transplantation model reported by yokoyama et al [ 44 ] .
as previously described [ 45 ] , preparation of the donor heart for transplantation entailed ligation of pulmonary vessels , superior vena cava and inferior vena cava ( ivc ) , creation of an atrial septal defect , and disruption of the tricuspid valve leaflets .
the donor ascending aorta was anastamosed to the recipient abdominal aorta and the donor right atrium was anastamosed to the recipient ivc .
upon re - establishment of blood flow , all transplanted hearts resumed spontaneous contractions , had coordinated atrioventricular activity , and were free of gross surgical injury at the time of closure .
the transplanted animals were subjected to various treatments with csa ( 0 , 10 , 18 , or 28 day regimen ) , rapamycin , and adoptive transfer of 1x107 th2.r cells per injection ( at day 0 of transplant and / or day - 7 pre - transplant ) , as summarized in table 2 .
survival of cardiac grafts was evaluated by daily palpation ; cessation of heartbeat was interpreted as lack of viability .
specimens were processed for histopathology using hematoxylin and eosin staining [ 46 ] .

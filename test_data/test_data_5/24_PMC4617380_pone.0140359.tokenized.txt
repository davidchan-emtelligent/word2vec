protein - protein interactions are among today 's most exciting and promising targets for therapeutic intervention .
to date , identifying small - molecules that selectively disrupt these interactions has proven particularly challenging for virtual screening tools , since these have typically been optimized to perform well on more " traditional " drug discovery targets .
here , we test the performance of the rosetta energy function for identifying compounds that inhibit protein interactions , when these active compounds have been hidden amongst pools of " decoys. " through this virtual screening benchmark , we gauge the effect of two recent enhancements to the functional form of the rosetta energy function : the new " talaris " update and the " pwsho " solvation model .
finally , we conclude by developing and validating a new weight set that maximizes rosetta 's ability to pick out the active compounds in this test set .
looking collectively over the course of these enhancements , we find a marked improvement in rosetta 's ability to identify small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions .

introduction virtual screening has become an important tool in modern drug discovery , complementing high - throughput biochemical and phenotypic screening to provide small molecules that engage target proteins important in human disease [ 1 ] .
already contributions from computer - aided design have helped advance a number of drugs into the clinic [ 2 , 3 ] .
structure - based ( receptor - driven ) virtual screening , or " docking ," is comprised of two interrelated tasks : pose generation and ranking .
the former involves searching various locations and orientations of each compound in a library , to produce structural models of each potential protein - ligand complex .
this search is carried out by optimization of some scoring function , and can include the internal degrees of freedom for the protein and / or for the ligand .
once models have been built for each member of the compound library , these are then ranked to identify those compounds most likely to exhibit the desired biological activity .
ranking may either be carried out using the same scoring function used in pose generation , or by using a more detailed ( computationally demanding ) approach. by prioritizing a small number of compounds drawn from a much larger library , structure - based screening offers the potential to dramatically reduce the number of compounds that must be tested in the early stages of a drug discovery campaign .
both tasks are equally critical to successfully selecting active compounds .
if an active compound is inappropriately positioned relative to the protein (" mis - docked ") , then it is unlikely to achieve a favorable ranking .
at the same time , accurately identifying the most promising compounds in the set - - without an abundance of false positives - - is also essential for harnessing the utility of virtual screening .
in this study we focus on the latter step , and ask how recent enhancements to the rosetta energy function affect its ability to successfully identify active compounds from among large numbers of docked " decoy " compounds .
the rosetta macromolecular modeling software suite [ 4 ] was originally developed as a protein - only tool for structure prediction [ 5 , 6 ] and design [ 7 ] , but then grew to allow simulations that can include dna [ 8 , 9 ] , rna [ 10 ] , small molecules [ 11 , 12 ] , non - canonical " peptoid " backbones [ 13 ] , and even mineral surfaces [ 14 ] .
rosetta is supported by a broad community of users studying highly diverse systems , and the underlying energy function is a key contributor to the success of these applications .
the rosetta energy function is typically validated for new applications through two classes of benchmark experiments .
the first class focuses on design applications , and includes tests for recapitulation of native sequences [ 15 , 16 ] and predicting changes in stability / function associated with point mutations [ 17 , 18 ] .
the second class focuses on structure prediction applications , and includes large - scale tests to examine distributions of specific structural features [ 19 ] in addition to traditional recapitulation of native rotamers , loops , or complete protein structures [ 20 ] .
protocols that introduce new functionality into rosetta , such as the ability to model and design protein - ligand complexes , are typically evaluated using one or both classes of benchmark [ 11 , 21 ] .
here , we directly evaluate the performance of the rosetta energy function in a different type of benchmark : distinguishing known small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions from large sets of " decoy " compounds .
whereas " traditional " targets for therapeutic intervention include g protein - coupled receptors , ion channels , and various enzymes [ 22 , 23 ] , the role of protein - protein interactions in all aspects of cell growth and development has recently brought extreme attention to this emerging target class [ 24 , 25 ] .
despite innovative new approaches including fragment - screening [ 26 ] and mimetics of protein secondary structural elements [ 27 , 28 ] , biochemical and biophysical methods to identify inhibitors of protein - protein interactions remain more challenging to implement than in campaigns against traditional targets .
in principle , the difficulties of " wetlab " approaches in this target space might provide an important opportunity for contributions from virtual screening .
in practice , however , computational tools built for screening against traditional targets perform less well when they are deployed at protein interaction sites [ 29 ] .
to isolate the rosetta energy function and examine its performance free from any complications of conformational sampling , our benchmark focuses only on the " ranking " step of virtual screening .
for each of 18 non - redundant protein targets with crystal / nmr structures that have been solved in complex with a small - molecule inhibitor ( table 1 ) , we have generated docked models for 2500 diverse " decoy " compounds. by evaluating how rosetta ranks the active compound for each protein target relative to the decoys ( fig 1 ) , we are able to track changes in performance stemming from updates to the energy function .
we will highlight the effects of two very recent additions to rosetta - - talaris [ 19 , 20 , 30 ] and pwsho [ 31 ] - as well as introduce a new set of weights for the terms in the energy function , to optimize the performance of rosetta for identifying small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0140359.t001 table 1 protein targets used in this study .
these targets correspond to non - redundant protein - protein interaction sites for which a crystal structure or an nmr structure has been solved in complex with a small - molecule inhibitor .
for this study , three protein targets have been removed from our previously reported set [ 29 ] ( see methods ) .

a target protein is provided in complex with a known small - molecule inhibitor acting at this protein interaction site .
a collection of 2500 diverse " decoy " ligands have also been docked to this site .
the benchmark entails scoring each of the 2501 complexes , and determining the rank of the native ligand relative to the decoy compounds .
this experiment carried out for each of 18 non - redundant protein targets ( table 1 ) .
methods protein target set previously , we described a set of 21 complexes drawn from the 2p2i [ 32 ] and timbal [ 33 ] databases and supplemented from our own curation of the literature [ 29 ] .
in cases where a given protein has been separately solved in complex with more than one different ligand , we retained only the structure with the most potent of these ligands .
no two proteins in this set are homologs of one another .
for the present study , we removed three structures from this set : 1ctr ( steric clashes in the crystal structure ) , 2vc2 ( a very large protein ) , and 1alw ( the geometry of the active site led to poorly docked decoys ) .
the results presented here were obtained using the other 18 complexes ( table 1 ) .
three of these complexes were solved by nmr , and the other fifteen by x - ray crystallography .
the resolution of the crystal structures ranged from 1.27 to 2.90 a , and the r - free from 0.182 to 0.350 .
among the complexes for which electron density was available , we visually examined the electron density to ensure that the ligand atomic coordinates were appropriately defined by the density .
preparing decoy complexes the underlying intention is that decoy compounds are expected not to be active against the protein target .
to enhance the likelihood that this assumption holds true , we prepared a separate custom set of 2500 " presumed inactive " compounds for each protein target .
drawing from the zinc database [ 34 , 35 ] , we started by randomly selecting 10,000 compounds with molecular weight between 350 and 550 da , and hydrophobicity ( xlogp ) matched to that of the known inhibitor .
for each protein target , we then removed from this initial set any compound that was similar in chemical structure to the known inhibitor ( 2d fingerprint tanimoto score [ 36 ] >= 0.5 ) .
to ensure diversity ( non - redundancy ) of the decoy set , we next removed any compound with similar chemical structure to another compound already included in the set ( 2d fingerprint tanimoto score >= 0.8 ). from the compounds that remained after this filtering , we randomly drew 2500 to form the final decoy set .
to prepare for docking , we used omega [ 37 - 39 ] to generate up to 300 conformers of each decoy compound ( using default parameters ) [ 37 - 39 ] , and defined the binding site for each of the 18 proteins using the bound ligand in the experimentally - determined structure ( using the oedocking " receptor _ setup " utility ) .
we then docked each decoy compound to the corresponding protein structure using fred ( with default parameters ) [ 40 , 41 ] , and selected the top structure for each compound based on the fred 's chemgauss4 score ; the resulting structure for each protein - ligand pair was used as a " decoy complex. " by using fred ( rather than rosetta ) to carry out this docking step , we ensured that any artifacts of the rosetta energy function would not be inadvertently incorporated into the set of decoy complexes .
as part of the benchmark experiments described below , however , each complex ( decoy and native ) was subjected to an equivalent energy minimization with the particular rosetta energy function to be used for the subsequent ranking of compounds : in part , this ensures that our evaluation of a given rosetta energy function is not simply a reflection of how well that rosetta energy function detects potential artifacts of fred docking ( and uses these to distinguish the native complexes ) .
preparing native complexes the ranking step in rosetta ( described below ) does not currently consider alternate tautomeric states or protonation states of the ligand .
the state in the complex may , however , differ from the most likely state existing in solution .
since performance will be evaluated using the correctly - docked pose , it is critical to ensure that the rosetta calculations are carried out using an appropriate description of the bound ligand .
an alternate form of the active ligand would not be expected to have activity ; thus , these ( non - native ) forms of the ligand are not suitable for evaluating how well a given method identifies active compounds .
for this reason , we used the protoss program [ 42 ] to obtain the most likely tautomeric state / protonation state for each native ligand , in the context of the protein - ligand complex. by contrast , the most likely tautomeric state / protonation state for the decoy ligands was determined using the quacpac toolkit [ 43 ] , in the absence of the protein .
we note that for a real virtual screening application , the native ligand 's tautomeric state / protonation state in the protein environment would not be known a priori ; those particular active ligands with a configuration that differs in solution versus in the protein environment would simply be missed if the ligand configuration is not adjusted in response to the protein during screening ( i.e. false negatives ) .
we note that this experimental design does disadvantage the decoy ligands relative to the native ligands ; we therefore use this benchmark to track differences in performance - - and not absolute performance - - of various scoring functions .
availability of the benchmark set the entire benchmark set is available as ( s1 benchmark ) .
for each target protein , this includes the protein itself , the native ligand ( in the experimentally - determined pose and in the fred - docked pose ) , and the decoy ligands ( in the fred - docked pose ) .
the native ligand is provided with both the protoss and the quacpac tautomeric state / protonation state .
ranking complexes using rosetta prior to scoring each complex , we used the " molfile - to - params " application [ 12 ] to assign atomic chemical properties and generate parameter definitions for each ligand .
we then performed gradient - based energy minimization of the complex , using the same rosetta energy function that would later be used to score and rank each complex .
all internal dihedral angles of the ligand and of the protein ( backbone and sidechains ) were included as degrees of freedom in this step , along with the ligand 's position and orientation relative to the protein .
after minimization , the protein - ligand interaction energy was evaluated using the desired energy function .
the rank of the active compound 's interaction energy was determined relative to those of the decoy compounds , as shown in fig 1 , from 1 ( best ) to 2501 ( worst ) .
we have made available the ranking of the active compound for each protein target under each energy function in this study ( s1 dataset ) ; these data comprise the results described below .
statistical analysis to compare the performance of two different energy functions , we considered - - for each of the 18 proteins in our test set - - which energy function positioned the native compound at a more favorable rank relative to the decoys , and assigned that energy function a " win " for the protein target ; we then counted the total number of " wins " from each of the two energy functions .
to avoid noise from very small differences in ranking , we excluded from the comparison any protein target for which both rankings were within 10 % of one another .
to determine the statistical significance of performance differences exhibited by two different energy functions , we started from the null hypothesis that both energy functions performed equally well .
our comparisons are between two sets of paired samples ( i.e. the protein targets ) , and the rankings may not be normally distributed ; for these comparisons we therefore applied the ( non - parametric ) wilcoxon signed - rank test .
all comparisons were applied to the logarithms ( base10 ) of the rankings .
we used the implementation of this test in the r statistical computing environment [ 44 ] , invoked as follows : wilcox.test ( mydata $ scorefxn _ a , mydata $ scorefxn _ b , paired = true , alternative = " greater ") because this test uses the rank values in the two energy - function sets , it has the advantage of taking into account the magnitude by which an energy function " wins " a given protein target ; this would not be the case if we were to simply compare the number of " wins " by each energy function .
in light of the chronological order by which the improvements to the energy function occurred , we had a prior expectation of which version would outperform the other ; for this reason , throughout this study we conducted our analyses using one - tailed tests .
results performance of the 2008 - 2013 rosetta energy function as a starting point for further comparisons , we began with the default rosetta energy function from early 2013 , " score12 " .
prior to recent improvements , this version of the energy function had remained essentially unchanged over a period of ten years [ 6 ] .
for each of the 18 protein targets , we used this energy function to score the 2501 complexes and evaluate the rank of the native inhibitor ( fig 1 ) .
as an objective point of comparison , we also carried out the same task using the most recent scoring function provided with fred , chemgauss4 [ 40 , 41 ] .
in fig 2a we compare the performance of the rosetta score12 energy function to that of fred 's chemgauss4 .
we find that chemgauss4 outperforms score12 in 10 of the 18 testcases ( points below the diagonal ) .
nonetheless , it is important to note that in many of the cases for which score12 " wins " , neither method performs particularly well - - in 5 of these 7 cases the active compound is ranked outside the top 100 by both methods .
in contrast , many of chemgauss4 's " wins " correspond to very good rankings of the active compound : in five cases , the active compound is ranked by chemgauss4 in the top 25 ( corresponding to the top 1 % of the set ) , and in three cases the active compound is ranked first overall - - ahead of every decoy complex .
both scoring functions have the same ( optimal ) performance on target 3zrc , the only one ranked first overall by score12 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0140359.g002 fig 2 baseline performance of the rosetta energy function prior to recent enhancements .
each plot compares the performance of two different scoring functions for identifying the active compounds in our virtual screening benchmark .
each of the 18 protein targets corresponds to a single point ( green dots ) ; the rank of the active compound ( relative to 2500 diverse " decoy " compounds ) by each scoring function is indicated .
the orange dotted line indicates a ranking of 25 , corresponding to the top 1 % of the decoy set .
( a ) fred 's chemgauss4 energy function outperforms rosetta 's original energy function intended for protein - only systems , score12 , but not at a statistically significant threshold ( p = 0.085 ) .
( b ) the variant of the score12 energy function that was developed specifically for modeling protein - ligand interactions , score12 _ ligand , offers improved performance over score12 ( p = 0.001 ) .
( c ) fred 's chemgauss4 energy function performs at a similar level as score12 _ ligand ( p = 0.239 ) .
all p - values are calculated by applying the wilcoxon signed - rank test to the logs of the ranks ( see methods ) .
it is clearly important to consider the magnitude of the differences in the rankings when comparing two scoring functions , and not just the number of protein targets at which each method " wins " .
to do so , we compared these scoring functions using the wilcoxon signed - rank test , applied to the difference in the logs of the rankings ( see methods ) .
based on this test , we cannot quite conclude statistical significance for the observation that fred 's chemgauss4 is more effective at ranking the known inhibitors ( p = 0.085 ) .
here , the relatively small number of available testcases limits the statistical significance of the comparison ; this is an unfortunate consequence of the overall dearth of small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions reported in the literature to date ( and correspondingly , the lack of available crystal structures ) .
even when the p - value indicates that the difference in performance between the two scoring functions is not statistically significant ( p >= 0.05 ) , however , it can still provide a useful way to quantify the performance differences .
this first experiment made use of score12 , a " standard " rosetta energy function intended to be used in protein - only simulations .
for studies involving small molecules , an alternative energy function is typically preferred [ 11 ] : this one shares most energy terms with score12 , but combines them in a different linear combination ( the so - called " ligand " weight set ) .
unsurprisingly , we find that this " score12 _ ligand " energy function outperforms score12 in identifying the native ligands in our benchmark ( fig 2b ) : performance is improved for 13 protein targets , and worse for only 1 target ( for the remaining 4 targets , the rankings from the two energy functions are within 10 % of one another and are thus considered " ties ") .
this improvement is further reflected in the fact that the active compound is now ranked in the top 1 % in two cases .
applying the wilcoxon signed - rank test , we conclude that the improvement in ranking associated with score12 _ ligand is indeed statistically significant ( p = 0.001 ) .
the improvement from score12 to score12 _ ligand is also evident when score12 _ ligand is compared to fred 's chemgauss4 ( fig 2c ) .
fred 's chemgauss4 " wins " only 2 targets more than score12 _ ligand ( 9 vs. 7 ) , and the similar performance of these two scoring functions is also reflected in the wilcoxon signed - rank test ( p = 0.239 ) .
talaris and pwsho talaris , the updated energy function mentioned above , became available to the rosetta community in june 2013 .
this major update contained multiple improvements throughout the energy function [ 19 , 20 , 30 ] , most notably including : an updated functional form for the hydrogen bond term , an explicit coulombic electrostatic term (" fa _ elec ") to replace the previous low - resolution , knowledge - based term (" fa _ pair ") , adjusted parameters in the lennard - jones and solvation terms , and new bicubic interpolation and rotamer library for the knowledge - based terms .
we anticipated that the improvements in the hydrogen bond term and the electrostatic term , in particular , would prove particularly important in this virtual screening benchmark .
ligand - specific weights have not yet been developed for talaris ; accordingly , we compared the performance of the default talaris to that of the default score12 , since both energy functions are intended primarily for simulations of proteins alone .
we find that the use of talaris improves performance for 13 protein targets relative to score12 , with decreased performance in only 4 cases ( performance was unchanged for one target ) ( fig 3a ) .
this difference was associated with marked improvement in the overall rankings as well , as determined from the wilcoxon signed - rank test ( p = 0.013 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0140359.g003 fig 3 recent enhancements to the functional form of the rosetta energy function enable improved performance .
( a ) rosetta 's " talaris " energy function [ 19 , 20 , 30 ] includes updates to the functional form of the hydrogen bond term and of the electrostatic term .
these changes lead to improved performance relative to score12 , at a statistically significant level ( p = 0.013 ) .
( b ) replacing rosetta 's default model of polar solvation , eef1 , with a newly developed model , pwsho [ 31 ] , leads to further improvement at a statistically significant level ( p = 0.0004 ) .
an ancillary utility of this benchmark is that the detailed energetic contributions for individual complexes can help rationalize why a given energy function outperforms another .
in particular , this insight can be gained from complexes - - either native or decoy - - that are ranked favorably by one energy function , and less favorably by the other .
to do so we compared score12 and talaris using the same ( non - minimized ) structures of the decoy and native complexes .
this choice allowed us to directly link differences in ranking to differences in the evaluation of energy components - - a connection much more difficult to draw in the case of minimized decoys , since the conformation changes slightly in response to the energy function .
two examples are provided by the decoy complexes shown in s1 fig : their very favorable ranking by score12 but not by talaris can be explained in terms of score12 's less - refined treatment of solvation , electrostatics , and hydrogen bonding .
burial of polar groups is penalized by rosetta 's solvation model ; by default this has been eef1 [ 45 ] .
in the context of this benchmark we examined the effect of replacing this model of polar solvation with a newly developed model , pwsho [ 31 ] , that was introduced to the rosetta community in july 2014 .
whereas eef1 determines the desolvation penalty by simply integrating the occluded volume around a polar group , pwsho additionally considers the energetic " value " of the water that has been displaced from this volume .
for example , displacing water that would otherwise make a strong hydrogen bond to the polar group of interest is penalized more strongly than displacing water that would not .
in its current implementation pwsho is on the same energy scale as eef1 , such that it can be used to replace eef1 without any further re - weighting of the energy function .
since pwsho describes only the polar part of desolvation , the non - polar part of eef1 ( energetics of burying hydrophobic groups ) is retained when using pwsho .
in separate simulations using pwsho in place of eef1 , we observe fewer output structures containing buried " unsatisfied " polar groups ( i.e. , polar atoms sequestered away from the solvent but not participating in compensatory intramolecular / intermolecular hydrogen bonds ) .
given the importance of solvation for inhibitors of protein - protein interaction ( due to their characteristic shallow binding pockets ) , we anticipated that pwsho would also assist in identifying the active compounds in this experiment .
upon replacing eef1 with pwsho in the rosetta energy function , we find improved performance for 12 of the 13 protein targets exhibiting differences in rankings ( fig 3b ) , with notable differences in the ranking of the active compounds by the wilcoxon signed - rank test ( p = 0.0004 ) .
thus , modeling protein - water interactions through pwsho leads to accumulation of higher energetic penalties on decoy atoms for their unfavorable desolvation ( s2 fig ) , which in turn proves beneficial to the discrimination of known inhibitors from decoy ligands .
collectively , these results suggest that the enhancements to the rosetta energy function from talaris and pwsho together provide improved performance relative to score12 .
however , it must still be recalled that the performance of score12 _ ligand was far superior to that of score12 , since the former was parameterized specifically for protein - ligand interactions .
optimal weights for identifying small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions in a previous benchmark experiment , we found that virtual screening by fred was exceptionally effective for traditional drug targets ( proteins naturally evolved to bind small molecules ) , but much less so for identifying inhibitors of protein - protein interactions [ 29 ] .
much like fred 's chemgauss4 scoring function , rosetta 's score12 _ ligand weights [ 11 ] were optimized for performance on a broad variety of protein - ligand interactions rather than for a particular class of interaction .
further , others have reported that performance can be enhanced by using weights optimized for a particular class of protein - ligand interaction [ 46 ] .
accordingly , to investigate the extent that performance might be improved under the current functional form of the rosetta energy function ( with talaris and pwsho ) , we next built a set of weights tailored to small - molecule inhibitors of protein interactions .
there are seven component energy terms in rosetta that contribute to the total intermolecular energy of a protein - ligand complex : fa _ atr ( attractive portion of the lennard - jones potential ) fa _ rep ( repulsive portion of the lennard - jones potential ) lk _ nonpolar ( the hydrophobic part of eef1 ) fa _ elec ( electrostatics with a distance dependent dielectric ) hb _ bb _ sc ( hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the protein backbone ) hb _ sc ( hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the protein sidechains ) occ _ sol _ fitted ( pwsho ) these terms are combined in the energy function as follows : einterface = c1 * efa _ atr + c2 * efa _ rep + c3 * elk _ nonpolar + c4 * efa _ elec + c5 * ehb _ bb _ sc + c6 * ehb _ sc + c7 * eocc _ sol _ fitted we fixed the weight of " fa _ atr " ( c1 ) at 0.8 , its value in the talaris 2013 energy function .
we also fixed the weight of " lk _ nonpolar " ( c3 ) at 0 , after preliminary runs of the optimization procedure ( described in the next paragraph ) converged to negative c3 values ; this term favors close packing of hydrophobic groups , and is thus somewhat redundant with " fa _ atr " .
developing a new weight set , then , required determining the optimal values for c2 / c4 / c5 / c6 / c7 .
for this purpose , we first extracted the component energies for each native and decoy complex in our benchmark .
we then used nelder - mead simplex optimization , as implemented in the c ++ gsl multidimensional minimization library ( http :// www.gnu.org / s / gsl /) , to optimize the values of c2 / c4 / c5 / c6 / c7 ; the objective function was defined to be the sum of the logs of the ranks of the native complexes relative to the corresponding decoys .
thus , each step of this simplex optimization entailed updating 45,018 energies ( 18 protein targets x 2501 complexes for each ) using a new set of weights .
because we had pre - computed the component energies for each of these 45,018 complexes , however , updating the total energy for each complex and re - evaluating the rank of the native ligand for each protein target was trivial ( and did not require calling rosetta ) ; thus , the optimization could be completed in seconds .
given the stochastic nature of the nelder - mead simplex algorithm , we ran 5 independent optimizations , then selected the set of weights that yielded the minimum value for the objective function .
the resulting weight set , trained on all 18 protein targets , is now available in rosetta distributions alongside the other standard weight sets , with the name " ppi _ discrimination.wts " .
examination of these weights ( s2 dataset ) reveals that the " hb _ bb _ sc " energy term is strongly upweighted ( by a factor of 3.5 ) , suggesting that favorable hydrogen bonding with the protein backbone is a distinctive feature that helps identification of small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions .
the electrostatic term (" fa _ elec ") and the pwsho term (" occ _ sol _ fitted ") are also upweighted ( by a factor of 2.35 and 1.55 , respectively ) .
the weights for the " hb _ sc " term and the " fa _ rep " term are decreased ( each by a factor of 0.8 ) , though this may arise from high variability of these two weights across training sets ( s2 dataset ) .
taken together , the optimized weights highlight the importance of polar contacts in complexes of small molecules that employ shallow binding modes , such as those acting at protein interaction sites .
it is important to note that these new weights are intended to be used in virtual screening tasks that entail scoring and ranking of ( minimized ) static structures ; these weights are not intended to be used in simulations ( including energy minimization ) that alter the structure of the protein - ligand complex .
to fairly evaluate the performance of this new energy function relative to the others we have considered so far , we used leave - one - out cross validation .
for a given protein target , we first developed a unique weight set by training on the other 17 protein targets ; we then applied this " custom " weight set to determine the rank of the native complex for the protein target of interest .
we repeated this procedure for each of the 18 protein targets , and used the rankings obtained in this manner for the comparisons below .
first , we compared the performance of these new weights to that of the talaris + pwsho function with standard weights ( fig 4a ) .
we observe that the new weight set " wins " 10 targets , whereas standard talaris + pwsho " wins " only 5 .
while this improvement in performance is not statistically significant ( p = 0.078 ) , we find that in 4 cases the active ligand is now included in the top 1 % of the compound library , and in 7 cases it is ranked among the top 100 compounds .
comparison to fred 's chemgauss4 ( fig 4b ) shows that this new rosetta weight set performs comparably ( p = 0.221 ) .
finally , we find that this new weight set also slightly outperforms score12 _ ligand ( fig 4c ) , albeit not by a statistically significant margin ( p = 0.123 ) .
we anticipate that the improvements of this new energy function derive from a combination of talaris , pwsho , and weights that were developed specifically for identifying inhibitors of protein - protein interactions .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0140359.g004 fig 4 new weights for identifying small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions .
using the talaris + pwsho functional form of the energy function , we identified new weights to optimize rosetta 's ability to distinguish true inhibitors from decoy compounds .
the results presented here were obtained by leave - one - out cross validation of the weights over the benchmark set of 18 non - redundant protein targets .
( a ) reweighting of the talaris + pwsho energy function leads to improved performance , though not at a statistically significant level ( p = 0.078 ) .
( b ) this new reweighted energy function provides comparable performance as fred 's chemgauss4 energy function ( p = 0.221 ) .
( c ) the new reweighted energy function slightly outperforms score12 _ ligand , though again not to a degree attaining statistical significance ( p = 0.123 ) .
discussion in this study we evaluated the performance of the rosetta energy function for an important and timely virtual screening application : selecting active compounds that will inhibit protein interaction sites , from among large libraries .
as we noted earlier , this is a particularly challenging task compared to virtual screening against " traditional " drug targets [ 29 ] .
this class of protein - ligand interactions is mediated by shallower binding modes than those observed in " traditional " complexes , and accordingly sterics provide less information to guide identification of active compounds .
instead , polar contacts are of increased importance , and long - standing challenges in accurately describing the energetics of polar interactions may thus underlie difficulties in computationally screening against protein interaction sites .
further , sub - optimal performance may also result from the use of tools parameterized for " traditional " targets .
in the course of the studies presented here , we have developed a new set of weights for the rosetta energy function that is specifically designed for identifying candidate inhibitors to disrupt protein interaction sites .
critically , this weight set is not intended for carrying out simulations that alter the structure of protein - ligand complexes , but rather is focused solely on the final " re - ranking " step that determines which compounds will be advanced for testing in biochemical or cell - based assays .
virtual screening can be split - - both conceptually and pragmatically - into two separate tasks : docking each member of a compound library , and then re - ranking the docked complexes .
here , we focus exclusively on the latter task and have developed a benchmark experiment specifically designed to evaluate performance for this task .
in doing so , however , we note that our benchmark does differ in certain key aspects from the scenario of a " true " virtual screen .
first , our benchmark makes use of fred - docked decoy complexes , but experimentally - derived native complexes ( with subsequent minimization of both ) .
in a real virtual screening scenario , of course , all of the complexes come from docking .
indeed , we find that using fred - docked native complexes , instead of the experimentally - derived complexes , leads to diminished performance in this benchmark ( s3 fig ) .
while this is a more realistic experiment , it does not clearly decouple the performance of the docking task from the re - ranking task .
an incorrectly docked pose should not score favorably , even if the compound happens to be a true inhibitor .
failure to identify the correct pose is a deficiency of the docking step , and thus should not influence the results of a benchmark for the re - ranking task .
our benchmark also makes use of the tautomeric state / protonation state for the known ligand that best fits the protein environment in the correctly - docked pose , as identified by protoss .
again this assumes knowledge that would not be available in a true virtual screening scenario , and again failure to provide this knowledge ( in this case , relying on quacpac to provide the configuration , without insight from the protein environment ) leads to diminished performance ( s4 fig ) .
in this case too though , a docked pose in which the ligand configuration is not matched to the protein environment should not score favorably ; thus , it is most helpful to utilize a high - resolution benchmark that stresses identification of the known inhibitor only when this compound can be selected " for the right reason. " finally , we note that each of the complexes in our benchmark are minimized using the same scoring function that is used to ranking the complexes .
carrying out this calculation for each compound in a very large library is often impractical , and thus minimization is typically only used for the top - scoring compounds after docking ( if at all ) .
in this case the minimization step does not provide extra knowledge that would not be available in a realistic scenario , however , but rather the opposite : fred - docked decoys contain more steric clashes than the corresponding experimentally - derived complexes , and as a result it becomes nearly trivial to pick out the ( non - docked ) active complex ( s5 fig ) .
though minimization of a complete library may not be practical for a large - scale virtual screen , it was a necessary component of this benchmark in order to ensure that the decoy compounds were not unfairly disadvantaged .
using the benchmark we describe here , the performance of rosetta for this task can be directly tracked across several recent enhancements to the energy function ; all the comparisons described in the course of this study are summarized in table 2 .
we note that this is still an exceedingly challenging benchmark , as highlighted by the relatively poor performance of score12 at the outset of our study .
hence , any substantial improvement in rank may indicate that the underlying modification to the energy function is worth pursuing further , even if the absolute rank is still unimpressive .
however , given that the number of compounds advanced to experimental validation rarely exceeds a few dozen , improvements at low rank ( i.e. among the most favorably scored compounds ) should be valued more than improvements at high rank .
together , these two considerations motivate our decision to apply the wilcoxon signed - rank test to the complete set of compounds ( 1 - 2501 ) , and also to compare ranks in terms of their logarithms .
it is thus exciting and encouraging that rosetta 's ability to identify the active compounds in this benchmark was improved to the extent observed in this study - - ultimately bringing it to a level of performance similar to that of fred 's chemgauss4 scoring function .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0140359.t002 table 2 summary of the comparisons made in this study .
among the 18 protein targets used as testcases , those for which the rankings by both scoring functions were within 10 % of one another were considered to be " ties " .
the reported p - values were calculated by applying the wilcoxon signed - rank test to the difference in the log of the rankings , over all testcases .
this ( non - parametric ) statistical test has the advantage that the degree to which a given method " wins " each testcase - - and not just the number of " wins " - - is taken into account .
comparison fraction of targets with improved performance p - value ( wilcoxon signed - rank test ) fred chemgauss4 outperforms score12 10 / 17 0.085 score12 _ ligand outperforms score12 13 / 14 0.001 fred chemgauss4 outperforms score12 _ ligand 9 / 16 0.239 talaris outperforms score12 13 / 17 0.013 talaris + pwsho outperforms talaris + eef1 12 / 13 0.0004 reweighted talaris + pwsho outperforms original talaris + pwsho 10 / 15 0.078 reweighted talaris + pwsho outperforms fred chemgauss4 11 / 18 0.221 reweighted talaris + pwsho outperforms score12 _ ligand 9 / 17 0.123 nonetheless , even with these enhancements both fred 's chemgauss4 and rosetta fail to rank the known inhibitor in the top 1 % of compounds for most targets , confirming that identifying small - molecule inhibitors of protein - protein interactions remains a challenging task .
given the complexity of this task , it also remains difficult to ascertain precisely why current methods fall short .
it is noteworthy , though , that considerable orthogonality remains between chemgauss4 and rosetta .
if both methods represented slight variations of the same underlying approach , one would expect them struggle / excel on the same targets as one another .
clearly , however , this is not the case : among the five targets for which chemgauss4 ranked the known inhibitor in the top 1 % , rosetta performed comparably in only two cases , and in one case rosetta failed even to rank the known inhibitor in the top 50 % ; conversely , rosetta had more " wins " in the same experiment ( fig 4b ) .
these differences imply that chemgauss4 recognizes important energetic features of the native interaction that are missed by rosetta , and vice versa ; we are therefore optimistic that detailed examination of complexes for which the two cannot agree ( s6 fig ) will reveal further avenues for improving the both energy functions .

s1 fig rationalization of decoys that rank favorably with score12 , but less so with talaris .
to appropriately compare between the two energy functions , the same conformation was scored using both energy functions ( i.e. without minimization ) .
both images were produced using pymol [ 47 ] , with the protein represented in spheres and the ligand represented in sticks .
( a ) the protein pdb id is 4gq4 , the ligand zinc id is zinc01019586 .
this decoy complex is ranked 10th by score12 and 34th by talaris , with protein - ligand interface energies of - 10.522 and - 8.913 rosetta energy units ( reus ) , respectively .
seventy - three percent of the difference in interface energy is due to the solvation component of the interface energy , which is + 8.397 under score12 and + 9.564 under talaris .
the change reflects the increase from 0.65 in score12 to 0.75 in talaris in the weight that solvation energy has in the computation of total energy ; the unweighted solvation components are indeed very similar : + 12.918 for score12 and + 12.752 for talaris .
the electrostatic component contributes 20 % of the difference in interface energy , because the score12 " fa _ pair " component is 0 reus , whereas the talaris " fa _ elec " component is + 0.315 reus .
b : the protein pdb id is 3in7 , the ligand zinc id is zinc00792906 .
this decoy complex is ranked 3rd by score12 and 16th by talaris , with interface energies of - 8.706 and - 7.288 reus , respectively .
here the solvation component accounts for 72 % of the difference in interface energy , its value being + 10.147 reus under score12 and + 11.172 reus under talaris .
another 26 % of the difference in interface energy is contributed by the hydrogen - bond component ; in particular , the hydrogen bonds between the ligand and the protein ( yellow broken lines ) have a total energy of - 0.925 reus under score12 and - 0.558 reus under talaris .

s2 fig rationalization of a decoy that ranks favorably with eef1 's polar solvation , but less so with pwsho 's polar solvation .
the protein pdb id is 4g55 and the ligand zinc id is zinc00624571 .
to appropriately compare between the two energy functions , the same conformation was scored using both energy functions ( i.e. without minimization ) .
this decoy complex is ranked 10th by talaris + eef1 and 32nd by talaris + pwsho , with protein - ligand interface energies of - 6.611 and - 6.369 reus , respectively .
the entire difference in interface energy is contributed by the polar solvation component , whose eef1 value is + 8.721 reus and whose pwsho value is + 8.964 reus .
to help understand why pwsho penalizes this complex more than eef1 , we present the interaction between the protein backbone carbonyl atom o ( 65 ) and atom s1 of the ligand .
the energetic cost for desolvating o ( 65 ) with s1 is + 0.05 reus under eef1 , whereas it is + 0.10 reus under pwsho .
the same applies for the interaction of the protein sidechain arginine atom neta2 ( 64 ) with atom c23 in the ligand .
the energetic cost for desolvating neta2 ( 64 ) with c23 is + 0.12 reus under eef1 , versus + 0.22 reus under pwsho .
in both of these cases , the pwsho energy more strongly penalizes the fact that ligand binding reduces this ability of these protein atoms to hydrogen bond with nearby water .
this image was produced using pymol [ 47 ] , with the protein represented in spheres and the ligand represented in sticks .

s3 fig identification of the known inhibitor using a fred - docked model of the complex .
scoring in this experiment was carried out using the talaris + pwsho energy function .
( a ) performance for this task is diminished significantly ( p = 0.019 ) if the known inhibitor is docked , rather than provided in the experimentally - determined pose : with 3 versus 11 " wins " , respectively .
( b ) the fold - decrease in performance observed upon using the docked structure of the known inhibitor , as opposed to the experimentally determined structure , appears uncorrelated to the rmsd between the two structures .
performance decreases even in some of the cases for which the rmsd of the fred - docked structure is less than 2 a from the native pose , suggesting that even this accuracy may be insufficient for the known inhibitor to be selected by the downstream scoring function .

s4 fig identification of the known inhibitor using its " default " tautomeric state and protonation state .
performance for this task is diminished significantly ( p = 0.0008 ) if the tautomeric state and protonation state of the known inhibitor are computed with quacpac ( i.e. without knowledge of the protein environment ) rather than with protoss ( i.e. using the experimentally - derived structure of the native complex ) .
there are zero " wins " using the quacpac ligand configuration , versus ten " wins " using the protoss ligand configuration .
scoring in this experiment was carried out using the talaris + pwsho energy function .
( eps ) click here for additional data file .
s5 fig identification of the known inhibitor using non - minimized complexes .
scoring in this experiment was carried out using the talaris + pwsho energy function .
( a ) performance for this task becomes a much easier if performed on non - minimized rather than minimized complexes , due to the presence of steric clashes in non - minimized decoy complexes .
the increase in performance is dramatic ( p = 0.000004 ) , with the known inhibitor being ranked 10 times as first overall , and 15 times in the top 1 % of the compound library .
( b ) the fold - increase in performance upon using non - minimized complexes , as opposed to minimized complexes , appears uncorrelated with the rmsd between minimized and non - minimized structures of the known inhibitor .
this is consistent with the expectation that minimization makes the decoy complexes more competitive , and thus the change in performance is unrelated to how minimization affects the active complex .
rmsd was computed over the inhibitor 's heavy atoms , after superposition of the protein residues within 10 a of the inhibitor .
( eps ) click here for additional data file .
s6 fig rationalization of cases where fred chemgauss4 and talaris + pwsho rank the known inhibitor discordantly .
to appropriately compare between the two energy functions , the same conformation was scored using both energy functions ( i.e. without minimization ) .
both images were produced using pymol [ 47 ] , with the protein represented in spheres and the ligand represented in sticks .
a : the pdb id of this active complex is 4gq4 .
the known inhibitor is ranked 3rd by fred chemgauss4 , but 23rd by talaris + pwsho .
both scoring functions agree that the inhibitor has moderately favorable hydrogen - bonding and polar - solvation energies .
a prominent difference between the two scoring functions is in the evaluation of non - polar solvation : while chemgauss4 has no explicit term to model non - polar solvation , talaris + pwsho ranks the inhibitor 's " lk _ nonpolar " energy term very unfavorably ( 2461st out of 2501 ) .
b : the pdb id of this active complex is 2yel .
the known inhibitor is ranked 1st by talaris + pwsho , but 371st by chemgauss4 .
under chemgauss4 the inhibitor has unfavorable shape complementarity ( ranking 682nd by combined " cg3 : steric " and " cg3 : clash " scores ) and unfavorable intermolecular hydrogen bonding ( 434th by " cg4 : hb " score ). by contrast , under talaris + pwsho the inhibitor has excellent shape complementarity ( 3rd by combined " fa _ atr " and " fa _ rep " energies ) , and favorable hydrogen bonding ( 42nd by combined " hb _ bb _ sc " and " hb _ sc " energies ) .

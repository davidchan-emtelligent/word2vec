cop1 ( constitutive photomorphogenic 1 ) , a ubiquitin e3 ligase , is a central negative regulator of photomorphogenesis .
however , how cop1 activity is regulated by post - translational modifications remains largely unknown .
here we show that sumo ( small ubiquitin - like modifier ) modification enhances cop1 activity .
loss - of - function siz1 mutant seedlings exhibit a weak constitutive photomorphogenic phenotype .
siz1 physically interacts with cop1 and mediates the sumoylation of cop1 .
a k193r substitution in cop1 blocks its sumo modification and reduces cop1 activity in vitro and in planta .
consistently , cop1 activity is reduced in siz1 and the level of hy5 , a cop1 target protein , is increased in siz1 .
sumoylated cop1 may exhibits higher transubiquitination activity than does non - sumoylated cop1 , but siz1 - mediated sumo modification does not affect cop1 dimerization , cop1 - hy5 interaction , and nuclear accumulation of cop1 .
interestingly , prolonged light exposure reduces the sumoylation level of cop1 , and cop1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of siz1 .
these regulatory mechanisms may maintain the homeostasis of cop1 activity , ensuing proper photomorphogenic development in changing light environment .
our genetic and biochemical studies identify a function for siz1 in photomorphogenesis and reveal a novel sumo - regulated ubiquitin ligase , cop1 , in plants .
author summary in darkness , the ubiquitin e3 ligase cop1 accumulates in the nucleus and mediates ubiquitination and degradation of positive regulators of photomorphogenesis , such as hy5 .
in response to light , cop1 activity is reduced to ensure proper photomorphogenic development .
however , post - translational modifications that regulate cop1 activity are largely unknown .
we have found that the arabidopsis sumo e3 ligase siz1 negatively regulates photomorphogenesis .
genetic and biochemical lines of evidence demonstrate that siz1 - mediated sumo modification of cop1 enhances its e3 ubiquitin ligase activity , which causes increased ubiquitination and degradation of hy5 .
in response to the light , sumoylation level of cop1 is decreased , which may also contributes to the reduction of cop1 activity in the light .
moreover , cop1 mediates ubiquitination and 26s proteasome - dependent degradation of siz1 and this feedback repression may ensure the moderate levels of cop1 activity .
our study established a post - translational regulatory modular consisting of siz1 - mediated sumoylation and cop1 - mediated ubiquitination that tightly regulate photomorphogenesis .

introduction sumoylation is a post - translational modification in which sumo ( small ubiquitin - like modifier ) peptides are covalently attached to a sumo consensus motif ( psikxe / d ; psi a large hydrophobic amino acid residue ; k , the acceptor lysine ; x , any amino acid ; e / d , glutamate or aspartate ) in target proteins through a series of biochemical steps involving activation ( e1 ) , conjugation ( e2 ) , and ligation ( e3 ) enzymes [ 1 , 2 ] .
sumo conjugation can be reversed by sumo - specific proteases [ 3 ] .
in yeast and metazoans , sumoylation has been implicated in several aspects of cellular functions , including chromatin remodeling , dna repair , nuclear / cytoplasmic transport , transcription , and the cell cycle [ 4 ] .
the pias [ protein inhibitors of activated stats ( signal transducer and activator of transcription )] - type sumo e3 ligase , siz1 [ sap ( scaffold attachment factor , acinus , pias ) , and miz1 ( msx2 - interacting zinc finger )] , regulates abiotic stress responses ( i.e. , responses to heat , cold , drought , and salt stresses ) , hormone signaling ( i.e. , abscisic acid , salicylic acid , and auxin pathways ) , nutrient ( i.e. , phosphate , nitrogen , and copper ) homeostasis , and development ( i.e. , flowering time and female gametophyte development ) in arabidopsis [ 5 , 6 ] .
increasing evidence indicates that the sumo and ubiquitin systems are tightly associated .
sumoylation antagonizes ubiquitination by competing for acceptor k residues or promotes ubiquitination by recruiting sumo - targeted ubiquitin ligases ( stubls ) to sumoylated substrates in yeast , mammals , and plants [ 7 , 8 ] .
moreover , the pias family of sumo e3 ligases positively or negatively regulates ubiquitin ligase activity by sumo modification of the sumo - regulated ubiquitin ligases ( srubl ) in humans [ 9 , 10 ] .
in arabidopsis , sumo modifications regulate the protein stability of della , ice1 ( inducer of cbf / dreb1 expression ) , abi5 ( aba insensitive 5 ) , myb30 , nia1 / 2 ( nitrate reductase ) , sly1 ( sleepy1 ) and snrk1 ( snf1 - related protein kinase 1 ) likely by antagonizing or promoting ubiquitination [ 11 - 17 ] .
srubls may also exist in plants ; however , they remain to be identified .
dark - grown seedlings have an elongated hypocotyl , closed cotyledons , and an apical hook ( skotomorphogenesis ) .
in the light , arabidopsis seedlings undergo photomorphogenesis and exhibit short hypocotyls and open cotyledons with no apical hooks [ 18 ] .
the ubiquitin e3 ligase cop1 ( constitutive photomorphogenic 1 ) , a central repressor of photomorphogenesis , mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of positive regulators of photomorphogenesis , such as hy5 ( elongated hypocotyl 5 ) , hyh ( hy5 homologue ) , laf1 ( long after far - red light 1 ) , hfr1 ( long hypocotyl in far red 1 ) , sth3 ( salt tolerance homolog 3 )/ bbx2 and pil1 ( phytochrome interacting factor 3 - like1 ) [ 19 - 24 ] .
spa ( suppressor of phya - 105 ) and pifs ( phytochrome interacting factors ) interact with cop1 , and enhances its e3 ligase activity [ 21 , 25 , 26 ] .
csu1 ( cop1 suppressor1 ) , a ring - finger e3 ubiquitin ligase , regulates cop1 homeostasis by ubiquitinating and degrading cop1 in darkness [ 27 ] .
csu2 and fin219 interact with cop1 , and negatively regulate its e3 ligase activity and protein level , respectively [ 28 , 29 ] .
in response to lights , phya ( phytochrome a ) , phyb , cry1 ( crytochrome 1 ) and cry2 , repress cop1 activity through modulating cop1 - spa1 complex [ 30 - 34 ] , reduced cop1 activity in the lights causes the accumulation of hy5 and the transcriptomic reprogramming of hy5 target genes [ 35 , 36 ] .
however , post - translational modifications that regulate cop1 activity are largely unknown .
recent study has revealed that sumo modification of phyb represses red light signaling , at least partly , through inhibiting interaction between phyb and pifs [ 37 ] .
in this study , we demonstrate that siz1 negatively regulates photomorphogenesis , at least partly , through promoting cop1 ubiquitin e3 ligase activity by sumo modification , and that cop1 in turn mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of siz1 .
our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of cop1 and siz1 in photomorphogenesis .
results the sumo e3 ligase siz1 negatively regulates photomorphogenesis the observation that loss - of - function siz1 mutant seedlings showed a short - hypocotyl phenotype under white light prompted us to evaluate the light responsiveness of siz1 - 2 .
the siz1 - 2 seedlings exhibited a short - hypocotyl phenotype under darkness and red , blue , and far - red light conditions ( fig 1a and 1b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006016.g001 fig 1 the siz1 mutant seedlings display a short - hypocotyl phenotype .
( a ) siz1 - 2 seedlings exhibit a short - hypocotyl phenotype under red ( r : 10 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , blue ( bl : 14 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , and far - red ( fr : 12 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) light conditions , and this phenotype is rescued by complementation with siz1 driven by its own promoter ( ssg ) .
bar = 2 mm .
( b ) hypocotyl length of five - day - old col - 0 , siz1 - 2 , and ssg under darkness and red ( r ) , blue ( bl ) , and far - red ( fr ) light conditions at the indicated fluence rates .
data are the mean +/ - se of 30 seedlings .
( c ) qrt - pcr analysis showing the enhanced responsiveness of light - responsive genes in siz1 - 2 seedlings compared to those in the wild type under the dark to light transition .
five - day - old dark - grown seedlings were transferred to white light for an additional 6 h. relative expression was normalized to that of ubc .
error bars indicate +/ - se ( n = 3 ) .
( d ) siz1 - 2 seedlings exhibit unfolded apical hooks under dark conditions ( dk ) .
bar = 0.5 mm .
( e ) siz1 - 2 seedlings show more opened cotyledon compared to col - 0 under dark ( dk ) , red ( r ; 10 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , blue ( bl ; 14 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , and far - red ( fr ; 12 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) light conditions .
** student 's t - test indicates significant differences between the col - 0 and siz1 - 2 ( p <= 0.01 ) .
expression of prosiz1 : siz1 - gfp in siz1 - 2 plants ( complemented lines referred to as ssg ) [ 38 ] suppressed the short - hypocotyl phenotype of siz1 - 2 under these conditions , indicating that mutation of siz1 is responsible for the short - hypocotyl phenotype ( fig 1a and 1b ) .
the short - hypocotyl phenotype of siz1 - 2 was due to a reduction in cell elongation but not in cell number ( s1 fig ) .
the expression of light - inducible genes , cab ( chlorophyll a / b binding protein ) and rbcs ( rubisco small subunit ) [ 39 , 40 ] , and a light - repressed gene , pora ( protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase a ) [ 41 ] , was up - and down - regulated , respectively , in siz1 - 2 during the transition from darkness to light , indicating that the regulation is stronger in siz1 - 2 than in wild type ( fig 1c ) .
in addition to the short - hypocotyl phenotype , siz1 - 2 seedlings had unfolded apical hooks in darkness ( fig 1d ) and exhibited more opened cotyledons than did wild - type seedlings in dark and light conditions ( fig 1e ) .
these results suggest that siz1 negatively regulates photomorphogenesis .
the short - hypocotyl phenotype of siz1 - 2 is due to impaired sumo1 / 2 modification and not elevated sa to determine if siz1 - mediated sumo1 / 2 modification is involved in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation , we determined the hypocotyl length of sum1 and sum2 double mutant under darkness and red , blue , and far - red light conditions ( fig 2 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006016.g002 fig 2 sumo e3 ligase - mediated sumo1 / 2 modification , but not sa , regulates hypocotyl elongation in response to light .
( a ) siz1 - 2 , sum1 - 1 amir - sum2 , and nahg siz1 - 2 seedlings display shorter hypocotyls than the control plants col - 0 and nahg under red ( r ; 10 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , blue ( bl ; 14 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , and far - red ( fr ; 12 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) light conditions .
bar = 2 mm .
( b ) hypocotyl length of five - day - old col - 0 , siz1 - 2 , sum1 - 1 amir - sum2 , nahg , and nahg siz1 - 2 seedlings under darkness and the indicated light conditions .
data are the mean +/ - se of 30 seedlings .
sumo1 and 2 have redundant functions , and the sum1 sum2 double knockout mutant is embryo lethal [ 42 ] .
therefore , we used a viable weak allele , sum1 - 1 amir - sum2 , in which sumo2 expression is down - regulated by rnai in the sum1 - 1 knockout mutant background [ 43 ] .
similar to siz1 - 2 , sum1 - 1 amir - sum2 seedlings exhibited a short - hypocotyl phenotype under dark and light conditions , suggesting that sumo1 / 2 modification regulates hypocotyl elongation ( fig 2 ) .
elevated sa levels in siz1 - 2 cause dwarfism , and the dwarf phenotype is substantially suppressed by expression of nahg , a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase [ 44 ] .
to determine if the short - hypocotyl phenotype of siz1 - 2 is due to increased sa levels , the hypocotyl lengths of five - day - old wild - type , siz1 - 2 , nahg , and nahg siz1 - 2 seedlings were compared under darkness and red , blue , and far - red light conditions ( fig 2 ) .
the expression of nahg did not affect hypocotyl elongation , but the siz1 - 2 and nahg siz1 - 2 seedlings exhibited an identical short - hypocotyl phenotype in all tested conditions , indicating that the elevated sa level in siz1 - 2 did not contribute to the short - hypocotyl phenotype .
siz1 mediates sumo modification of cop1 since siz1 - 2 seedlings exhibit a weak cop1 - like phenotype , we examined whether siz1 physically interacted with cop1 to regulate its activity .
to do so , we performed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation ( bifc ) assay .
yfp fluorescence signals were detected in the nucleus of n. benthamiana cells that coexpressed cop1 - yfpn ( fused with the n - terminal half of yfp ) and siz1 - yfpc ( fused with the c - terminal half of yfp ) under light ( 1 h light exposure ) and dark conditions ( fig 3a and s2 fig ) .

anti - sumo1 antibody was used to determine sumoylated cop1 .
input and immunoprecipitated myc - cop1 were detected with anti - myc antibody .
arrowhead indicates non - sumoylated cop1 band .
asterisks indicate sumoylated cop1 bands .
( f ) light exposure reduces sumoylation levels of cop1 .
myc - cop1 and flag - sumo1 co - expressing n. benthamiana leaves were incubated under darkness for 12 h , and then exposed to white light ( 150 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) for 12 h. the nuclear proteins were isolated at the end - of - dark ( 0 h ) and the end - of - light ( 12 h ) period , and the sumoylation level of cop1 was analyzed as described in ( d ) .
input flag - sumo1 and flag - sumo1 aa were detected with anti - flag antibody in a separate blot , shown in s5b fig. ( g ) the level of cop1 sumoylation was substantially lower in siz1 - 2 than in col - 0 .
myc - cop1 and flag - sumo1 were transiently co - expressed in col - 0 or siz1 - 2 protoplasts , and the sumoylation level of cop1 was analyzed as described in ( d ) .
( h ) k193 is a primary sumoylation site in cop1 .
flag - sumo1 was transiently co - expressed with myc - cop1 , myc - cop1k14r , myc - cop1k193r , or myc - cop1k653r in col - 0 protoplasts , and immunoprecipitation was performed as described in ( d ) .
consistently , siz1 - gfp was coimmunoprecipitated with myc - cop1 ( fig 3b ) .
these results indicate that siz1 physically interacts with cop1 in the nucleus .
sumoplot ( http :// www.abgent.com / sumoplot ) analysis predicted the presence of three potential sumoylation motifs [ 45 ] ( vk14pd , ik193ed , and wk653sd ) in cop1 ( s3 fig ) , suggesting that cop1 may be a sumo substrate .
to test this possibility , we performed an in vitro sumoylation assay to determine sumo modification of cop1 as described previously [ 15 ] .
anti - flag and anti - sumo1 antibody detected slow migrating multiple bands above original cop1 protein in the reaction containing sumo e1 ( his6 - sae1b and his6 - sae2 ) , sumo e2 ( his6 - sce1 ) , and his6 - sumo1 - gg , but not in the reaction lacking his6 - sumo1 - gg , suggesting that cop1 is a possible sumo substrate ( fig 3c ) .
to further confirm cop1 is sumoylated in vivo , we performed an in vivo sumoylation analysis as described previously [ 38 ] .
we co - expressed myc - cop1 with flag - sumo1 or flag - sumo1aa ( a conjugation - deficient mutant ) in arabidopsis protoplasts or n. benthamiana leaves .
myc - cop1 was immunoprecipitated with anti - myc antibody and the immunoprecipitated proteins were detected with anti - flag antibody .
higher molecular weight sumoylated cop1 bands were detected when myc - cop1 and flag - sumo1 were co - expressed , but not in myc - cop1 and flag - sumo1aa co - expressing cells ( fig 3d and s4a fig ) .
moreover , to confirm that sumoylation of cop1 occurs in planta , we generated an myc - cop1 overexpression transgenic line ( referred to as 35s - myc - cop1 ) and performed an in vivo sumoylation analysis .
anti - sumo1 antibody detected higher molecular weight sumoylated cop1 bands ( fig 3e ) .
furthermore , we evaluated if sumoylation of cop1 changes in response to light .
since light exposure promotes nucleus to cytosol re - localization of cop1 [ 46 ] , we monitored the sumoylation status of cop1 in the nucleus under dark ( 0 h ) and light ( 12 h ) conditions ( fig 3f ) .
under darkness , sumoylated cop1 bands were detected in the myc - cop1 and flag - sumo1 co - expressing nuclear fraction , but the sumoylation level of cop1 was substantially reduced in response to 12 h of light exposure .
taken together , these data demonstrate that cop1 is a sumo substrate , and sumoylation level of cop1 is regulated by light .
to test if siz1 mediates sumo conjugation of cop1 , we cotransformed myc - cop1 and flag - sumo1 into arabidopsis protoplasts isolated from wild - type or siz1 - 2 plants , and analyzed the sumoylation status of cop1 .
whereas cop1 - sumo1 conjugate was detected in the wild type , substantially lower levels were present in siz1 - 2 ( fig 3g ) , indicating that siz1 facilitates the sumoylation of cop1 .
the lower levels of sumoylated cop1 in siz1 - 2 may be due to another sumo e3 ligase ( s ) that facilitates the residual sumo modification of cop1 .
alternatively , it is also possible that e1 and e2 contribute to basal levels of cop1 - sumo conjugation , since e1 and e2 alone mediate the sumoylation of cop1 in vitro ( fig 3c ) .
k - to - r substitutions in sumoylation motifs block sumo conjugation [ 47 ] .
to elucidate the sumoylation motifs of cop1 , sumo conjugation of myc - cop1k14r , myc - cop1k193r , and myc - cop1k653r were evaluated in arabidopsis protoplasts .
the k193r substitution blocked cop1 - sumo1 conjugation , but k14r or k653r substitutions did not ( fig 3h ) .
unfortunately , we could not confirm the effect of k193r substitution in vitro , due to anti - flag antibody detected long smear bands above the original purified mbp - cop1k193r - flag , which would strongly affect subsequent in vitro sumoylation analysis .
cop1 - sumo1 conjugation was also blocked by the k193r substitution in n. benthamiana leaves ( s4b fig ) .
these results indicate that siz1 mediates sumoylation of cop1 and that k193 is critical for sumo conjugation .
siz1 - mediated sumoylation positively regulates cop1 activity since siz1 mediates sumo modification of cop1 and siz1 - 2 seedlings exhibit a weak cop1 - like phenotype ( figs 1 and 3 ) , we hypothesis that siz1 - mediated sumo modification may enhances cop1 activity .
to test this possibility , we first determined the effect of sumoylation of cop1 in planta .
myc - cop1 and myc - cop1k193r ( a non - sumoylated form ) overexpressing arabidopsis transgenic plants were generated , and two independent lines with similar levels of transgene expression for each construct were selected for further phenotypic analysis ( s6 fig ) .
35s - myc - cop1 seedlings exhibited longer hypocotyls than did the wild type under white light conditions ( fig 4a ) , confirming a previous report [ 48 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006016.g004 fig 4 siz1 - mediated sumoylation enhances cop1 activity .
( a ) the hypocotyls of 35s - myc - cop1 seedlings , but not 35s - myc - cop1k193r , are longer than those of col - 0 seedlings under 50 mumol m - 2 s - 1 fluence rate of white light .
bar = 2 mm .

( c ) total protein extracts from five - day - old dark - grown 35s - myc - cop1 , 35s - myc - cop1k193r , col - 0 and cop1 - 4 seedlings , and bead - conjugated 6xhis - hy5 were used as e3 ligases and substrate , respectively , to perform an in vitro ubiquitination assay .
after reaction , the beads were washed and ubiquitinated 6xhis - hy5 were eluted for immunoblot analysis with anti - his and anti - ubiquitin antibodies .
arrowhead indicates ubiquitinated hy5 .
asterisk indicates non - specific band .
cop1 was detected with anti - cop1 antibody .
( d ) siz1 - 2 suppresses the long - hypocotyl phenotype of cop1 oe. col - 0 , siz1 - 2 , cop1 oe siz1 - 2 , and cop1 oe seedlings were grown under white light for 5 days .
bar = 2 mm .
( e ) hypocotyl length of five - day - old light - grown seedlings .
data represent the mean +/ - se ( n = 30 ) .
** student 's t - test indicates significant differences between the cop1 oe siz1 - 2 and cop1 oe ( p <= 0.01 ) .
( f ) total protein extracts from five - day - old dark - grown col - 0 and siz1 - 2 seedlings , and bead - conjugated his - hy5 were used as e3s and substrate , respectively , to perform an in vitro ubiquitination assay .
cop1 - 4 was used as a negative control .
ubiquitinated hy5 was determined using anti - his and anti - ubiquitin antibody .
arrowhead indicates ubiquitinated hy5 .
asterisk indicates non - specific bands .
cop1 was detected with anti - cop1 antibody .
( g ) genetic interaction between cop1 and siz1 .
col - 0 , siz1 - 2 , cop1 - 4 siz1 - 2 , and cop1 - 4 seedlings were grown under darkness for 5 days .
bar = 2 mm .
( h ) hypocotyl length of five - day - old dark - grown seedlings .
data represent the mean +/ - se ( n = 30 ) .
** student 's t - test indicates significant differences between the siz1 - 2 and cop1 - 4 siz1 - 2 ( p <= 0.01 ) .
under 30 mumol m - 2 s - 1 fluence rate of white light conditions , the hypocotyls of 35s - myc - cop1k193r seedlings were longer than that of the wild type , but shorter than that of 35s - myc - cop1 ( fig 4b ) .
under relatively higher fluence rate of white light conditions ( 50 and 80 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , while 35s - myc - cop1 seedlings still exhibit longer hypocotyls than wild type , the hypocotyls of 35s - myc - cop1k193r seedlings were of similar length as those of the wild type , suggesting that non - sumoylated myc - cop1k193r exhibits lower activity than myc - cop1 ( fig 4a and 4b ) .
next , total protein extracts isolated from 35s - myc - cop1 , 35s - myc - cop1k193r , col - 0 and cop1 - 4 seedlings were used as e3s to perform an in vitro hy5 ubiquitination assay as described previously [ 49,50 ] ( fig 4c ) .
ubiquitination of hy5 was stronger in the reaction containing protein extracts isolated from 35s - myc - cop1 than in that containing extracts from 35s - myc - cop1k193r .
we did not detected ubiquitination of hy5 in the reaction containing col - 0 protein extracts due to short expose time for the blot ( fig 4c ) .
next , we overexpressed cop1 in siz1 - 2 plants by crossing the cop1 overexpression line , cop1 oe , with siz1 - 2 ( referred to here as cop1 oe siz1 - 2 ) , and tested if the siz1 mutation reduces cop1 oe effect on hypocotyl elongation .
overexpression of cop1 causes a long - hypocotyl phenotype under light conditions ( fig 4d and 4e ) [ 48 ] .
consistent with our hypothesis , the hypocotyl length of cop1 oe siz1 - 2 was substantially shorter than that of cop1 oe , suggesting that cop1 activity is reduced in siz1 - 2 ( fig 4d and 4e ) .
finally , we compared the cop1 ubiquitin e3 ligase activity of col - 0 and siz1 - 2 .
total protein extracts from the wild type mediated the ubiquitination of hy5 more efficiently than did those from siz1 - 2 ( fig 4f ) .
collectively , these results demonstrate that siz1 - mediated sumo conjugation promotes cop1 e3 ubiquitin ligase activity .
furthermore , genetic interaction between cop1 and siz1 was analyzed .
the hypocotyl length of cop1 - 4 [ 51 ] was shorter than that of the wild type and siz1 - 2 under dark and light conditions ( fig 4g and 4h and s7 fig ) .
the cop1 - 4 siz1 - 2 double mutant exhibited a short - hypocotyl phenotype similar to cop1 - 4 in both dark and light conditions , suggesting that siz1 regulates hypocotyl elongation partly through cop1 ( fig 4g and 4h and s7 fig ) .
siz1 negatively regulates hy5 levels siz1 enhances cop1 activity ( fig 4 ) and cop1 mediates ubiquitination and degradation of hy5 [ 19 ] .
therefore , we tested if the protein level of hy5 is up - regulated by mutation of siz1 .
anti - hy5 antibody [ 52 ] revealed that endogenous hy5 was more abundant in siz1 - 2 than in the wild type under light conditions ( fig 5a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006016.g005 fig 5 protein abundance of hy5 is increased in siz1 - 2 .
( a ) immunoblot analysis of hy5 in col - 0 , siz1 - 2 , cop1 - 4 , cop1 - 4 siz1 - 2 and hy5 - 215 seedlings .

( d ) hy5 - 215 suppresses the short - hypocotyl phenotype of siz1 - 2 under red ( r ; 10 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , blue ( bl ; 14 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) , and far - red ( fr ; 12 mumol m - 2 s - 1 ) light conditions .
bar = 2 mm .
( e ) hypocotyl length of five - day - old seedlings under darkness and red ( r ) , blue ( bl ) , and far - red ( fr ) light conditions at the indicated fluence rates .
data represent the mean +/ - se ( n = 30 ) .
consistent with previous report [ 19 ] , higher level of hy5 was accumulated in cop1 - 4 , and the hy5 level in cop1 - 4 was similar to that of cop1 - 4 siz1 - 2 , suggesting that higher level of hy5 in siz1 - 2 is possibly due to reduced cop1 activity rather than increased transcription of hy5 in siz1 - 2 ( fig 5a ) .
consistent with this hypothesis , the level of hy5 expression was similar in the wild type and siz1 - 2 ( fig 5b ) .
these results indicate that siz1 negatively regulates hy5 protein abundance .
consistent with the increased hy5 level in siz1 - 2 , the expression level of the cell elongation - related direct target genes of hy5 , i.e. , exp2 ( expansin2 ) , ext3 ( extensin3 ) , xtr6 ( xyloglucan endotransglycosylase6 ) , and xth17 ( endotransglucosylase / hydrolase17 ) [ 36 , 53 ] , was down - regulated in siz1 - 2 compared to the wild type ( fig 5c ) .
the loss - of - function hy5 - 215 seedlings exhibited a long - hypocotyl phenotype under light conditions [ 54 ] .
to identify genetic interactions between hy5 and siz1 , we generated the hy5 - 215 siz1 - 2 double mutant through genetic crossing .
the short - hypocotyl phenotype of siz1 - 2 was partially suppressed by hy5 - 215 under various light conditions ( fig 5d and 5e ) , suggesting that the accumulation of hy5 in siz1 - 2 at least partly accounts for the short - hypocotyl phenotype under light conditions .
in addition to hy5 , cop1 also mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of hyh , laf1 , hfr1 , sth3 / bbx2 and pil1 [ 19 - 24 ] .
thus , it is possible that the protein levels of these positive regulators of photomorphogenesis are higher in siz1 - 2 , which may causes a weak cop1 - like phenotype of siz1 - 2 .
sumo modification may enhances the transubiquitination activity of cop1 siz1 - mediated sumo modification may regulate cop1 expression , cop1 stability , nuclear accumulation level , interaction with other proteins and / or affects its enzymatic activity .
the level of cop1 expression was not significantly affected by the siz1 - 2 mutation , indicating that siz1 does not regulate the transcription of cop1 ( fig 6a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006016.g006 fig 6 sumoylation may enhances the transubiquitination activity of cop1 .

input e3s were detected with anti - flag antibody .
asterisks indicate non - specific bands .
anti - cop1 antibody [ 30 ] revealed that endogenous cop1 protein abundance was similar in the wild type and siz1 - 2 , indicating that the reduced cop1 activity in siz1 - 2 was not due to reduced levels of cop1 ( fig 6b ) .
since cop1 functions as a homodimer [ 55 ] , we examined whether sumo modification affected cop1 dimerization .
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that myc - cop1 and myc - cop1k193r ( a non - sumoylated form ) immunoprecipitated the same amount of flag - cop1 , indicating that sumoylation of cop1 did not significantly affect cop1 dimerization ( fig 6c ) .
next , we examined if sumo modification enhanced the cop1 - hy5 interaction using in vitro co - immunoprecipitation assays .
sumoylation of cop1 did not enhance the substrate accessibility of cop1 under dark and light conditions ( fig 6d ) .
moreover , the siz1 mutation did not affect the level of nuclear cop1 under dark and light conditions ( fig 6e ) .
finally , we evaluated if sumo conjugation regulates transubiquitination acitivity of cop1 .
in vitro sumoylated and non - sumoylated mbp - cop1 - flag were used as e3s to perform an in vitro hy5 ubiquitination assay .
anti - gst and anti - ubiquitin antibodies detected higher level of ubiquitinated proteins in the reaction containing sumoylated cop1 than did non - sumoylated cop1 ( fig 6f ) , suggesting that siz1 - mediated sumo modification may enhances transubiquitination activity of cop1 .
cop1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of siz1 although the biological functions of siz1 have been extensively characterized , the mechanism that regulates siz1 activity is largely unknown .
our finding that cop1 interacted with siz1 ( fig 3a and 3b ) prompted us to determine if cop1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of siz1 .
to determine if cop1 promotes degradation of siz1 , we analyzed the decay kinetics of siz1 - gfp in the presence or absence of myc - cop1 .
the degradation of siz1 was more rapid in the presence of myc - cop1 ( fig 7a ) .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006016.g007 fig 7 cop1 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of siz1 .
( a ) cop1 enhances the degradation of siz1 .

data indicate the mean +/ - se ( n = 3 ) .
( d ) in vitro ubiquitination of siz1 by cop1 .
mbp - cop1 - flag and bead - conjugated mbp - siz1 - myc were used as e3 ligases and substrate , respectively , to perform an in vitro ubiquitination assay .
mbp - flag was used as a negative control .
input e3s were detected with anti - flag antibody .
after reaction , the beads were washed and ubiquitinated mbp - siz1 - myc was eluted for immunoblot analyses with anti - myc and anti - ubiquitin antibodies .
the vertical line indicates ubiquitinated siz1 proteins .
moreover , the cop1 - promoted siz1 degradation was inhibited by mg132 , a 26s proteasome inhibitor ( fig 7b , upper panel ) .
in agreement with a previous report [ 21 ] , mg132 also repressed the degradation of cop1 ( fig 7b , middle panel ) .
siz1 expression was not affected in cop1 - 4 , indicating that cop1 does not regulate siz1 transcription ( fig 7c ) .
next , we evaluated if cop1 mediates the ubiquitination of siz1 .
mbp - cop1 - flag was used as the e3 ligase in an in vitro siz1 ubiquitination assay .
anti - myc and anti - ubiquitin antibody revealed that cop1 facilitates ubiquitination of siz1 in vitro ( fig 7d ) .
these results suggest that cop1 negatively regulates siz1 protein stability through ubiquitination and subsequent 26s proteasome - dependent degradation .
discussion cop1 protein stability is regulated by csu1 - mediated ubiquitination [ 27 ] .
however , how the cop1 e3 ligase activity is regulated by post - translational modifications remains largely unknown .
our genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that cop1 activity is enhanced by siz1 - mediated sumo modification .
the role of sumo modifications in photomorphogenesis loss - of - function siz1 - 2 and sum1 - 1 amir - sum2 seedlings exhibited a short - hypocotyl phenotype under dark and light conditions ( figs 1 and 2 ) , suggesting that siz1 - mediated sumo1 / 2 modification negatively regulates photomorphogenesis .
siz1 physically interacts with cop1 and facilitates its sumo modification ( fig 3 ) .
cop1 exhibits higher activity compared to that of non - sumoylated cop1 , cop1k193r , and the cop1 activity was attenuated in siz1 - 2 ( fig 4 ) .
the reduced cop1 activity in siz1 resulted in higher levels of hy5 , stronger down - regulation of cell elongation - related hy5 direct target genes ( fig 5a and 5c ) .
these results strongly suggest that siz1 - mediated sumo modification enhances cop1 activity ; thus , cop1 is a plant sumo - regulated ubiquitin ligases ( srubl ) .
the hypocotyl length of cop1 - 4 siz1 - 2 was slightly shorter than that of cop1 - 4 ( fig 4g and 4h and s7 fig ) , suggesting that siz1 regulates hypocotyl elongation through at least two pathways , a cop1 - dependent and - independent pathway .
recently , it has been shown that sumo modification of phyb negatively regulate photomorphogenesis under red light [ 37 ] .
ots1 ( overly tolerant to salt1 ) mediate desumoylation of phyb , but whether the sumo modification is facilitated by siz1 remains to be determined .
however , it should be noted that cop1 - 4 is a weak allele , which expresses a partially functional truncated cop1 protein ( 1 - 282 aa , which contains the k193 sumoylation motif ) [ 51 ] .
therefore , it is also possible that the partial cop1 activity in cop1 - 4 is further attenuated in cop1 - 4 siz1 - 2 .
regulation of cop1 activity by sumo modifications it has been demonstrated that cop1 is regulated by different mechanisms : ( 1 ) light , fin219 and cold induces nuclear - to - cytoplasmic export of cop1 , but ethylene enhances nuclear retention of cop1 in the light [ 29 , 56 - 58 ] ; ( 2 ) csu1 , fin219 and heat shocks reduce protein abundance of cop1 [ 27 , 29 , 59 ] ; ( 3 ) spa positively regulates cop1 activity may through enhancing substrate recruitment [ 21 , 25 ] ; ( 4 ) phya , phyb , cry1 and cry2 repress cop1 activity by affecting cop1 - spa complex in the lights [ 30 - 34 ] ; ( 5 ) pif1 not only enhances substrate recruitment , but also increases autoubiquitination and transubiquitination activities of cop1 [ 26 ] .
the present study reveals that siz1 - mediated sumoylation does not regulate cop1 protein abundance , dimerization of cop1 , or nuclear - to - cytoplasmic translocation ( fig 6 ) .
sumo modification possibly increased transubiquitination activity of cop1 in vitro ( fig 6f ) , but did not affect substrate recruitment ( fig 6d ) .
at the molecular level , sumoylation affects protein - protein interactions and target protein conformation [ 60 , 61 ] .
we speculate that the enhanced transubiquitination activity of cop1 by sumoylation possibly due to conformational change of cop1 or increased cop1 - e2 interaction .
recent study has demonstrated that csu2 negatively regulates cop1 activity through their coiled - coil domains [ 28 ] .
sumo modification site , k193 , is located in the coiled - coil domain of cop1 .
thus , it is also possible that the sumoylation inhibits interaction between csu2 and cop1 in vivo , but remain to be elucidated in the near future .
it has been shown that a certain amount of cop1 is present in the nucleus even under prolonged light exposure , and plays a critical role in regulating development [ 27 , 51 , 58 , 62 - 64 ] .
interestingly , prolonged light exposure reduced sumoylation levels of nuclear - localized cop1 ( fig 3f ) , which results in decreased cop1 activity .
thus , we hypothesize that light - induced reduction of cop1 - sumo levels is required for the maintenance of moderate cop1 activity under light conditions to ensure the tight regulation of photomorphogenesis .
the reduced sumoylation level of cop1 under light conditions may be due to decreased siz1 - mediated sumoylation and / or increased sumo protease ( s ) - mediated desumoylation , but the details of the mechanisms by which light regulates the balance between sumoylation and desumoylation remain to be elucidated .
collectively , our study demonstrates that siz1 - mediated sumoylation negatively regulates photomorphogenesis , at least partly , through enhancing cop1 activity .
interestingly , cop1 in turn mediates the ubiquitination and 26s proteasome - dependent degradation of siz1 ( fig 8 ) .
this feedback repression of siz1 activity by cop1 may reflect the requirement of tightly regulated cop1 activity for proper photomorphogenic development .
10.1371 / journal.pgen.1006016.g008 fig 8 proposed model of how siz1 and cop1 regulate photomorphogenesis .
under darkness , cop1 mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of hy5 ( thinner t - bar ) .
siz1 - mediated sumo modification enhances cop1 ubiquitin e3 ligase activity toward hy5 ( thicker t - bar ) , but cop1 in turn promotes ubiquitination and 26s proteasome - mediated siz1 degradation .
under light , cop1 activity is repressed by photoreceptors and nuclear exclusion .
light exposure reduces the sumoylation level of cop1 , which may also contribute to the repression of cop1 activity .
sumo protease possibly mediates the desumoylation of cop1 in response to light .

dotted line indicates hypothetical regulation .

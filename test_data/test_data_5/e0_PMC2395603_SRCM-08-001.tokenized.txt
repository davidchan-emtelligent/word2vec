we have investigated whether there is evidence that patients with soft tissue sarcomas do better if treated in a specialist centre compared with district general hospitals. patients .
all patients diagnosed with soft tissue sarcomas who were residents of wmrha between 1994 and 1996 , with minimum follow up of 5 years , excluding head and neck or retroperitoneal tumors. methods .
we reviewed data from the royal orthopaedic hospital oncology service ( rohos ) database and the cancer intelligence unit ( ciu ) database , with medial record review where necessary .
main outcome measures were local recurrence and overall survival. results .
a total of 260 patients were diagnosed as having sts over the 3 - year period ( incidence = 1.62per 100000 per year ) : 37 % of patients had the majority of treatment at the specialist centre under the care of three surgeons , whilst the other 63 % were treated at a total of 38 different hospitals .
the rate of local recurrence was 39 % at the district general hospitals compared with 19 % at the specialist centre despite the fact that tumours treated at the district hospitals were smaller and of lower grade .
the most significant factors affecting survival were grade ( high versus low ) and depth of the tumour .
patients treated at the specialist centre had a small survival advantage after multivariate testing. conclusion .
soft tissue sarcomas are rare .
centralization of treatment improves local control in all patients and survival in some .
appropriate mechanisms for ensuring that patients with soft tissue sarcomas are seen and treated at specialist centres should be developed .

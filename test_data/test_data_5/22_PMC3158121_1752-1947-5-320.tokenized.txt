introduction endometriosis is a clinical entity which presents with functioning endometrial tissue at sites outside the uterus .
bowel endometriosis is usually asymptomatic , but it may show non - specific symptoms .
the presence and / or association of appendiceal endometriosis , concomitant with rectal endometriosis , is possible .
case presentation a 36 - year - old greek woman was admitted to the emergency room of our hospital with signs of acute abdomen .
on physical examination , our patient had a painful distended abdomen .
digital examination revealed an empty rectum and bowel obstruction was diagnosed .
our patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and rectum stenosis ( almost complete obstruction ) was observed .
the bowel stenosis was resected , and temporary colostomy and appendectomy were performed .
the pathology report showed endometriosis of the colon and the appendix , and our patient received medical treatment for endometriosis .
six months after this operation our patient had another surgery for restoration of large bowel continuity .
no endometriosis was found .
our patient was doing well at the one - year follow up. conclusion endometriosis of the bowel is a disease that may cause large bowel obstruction .
in women of reproductive age , the surgeon should consider endometriosis as a differential diagnosis in case of various gastrointestinal symptoms .
introduction endometriosis is a clinical entity , which was first described by von rokitansky kitansky as the presence of functioning endometrial tissue at sites outside the uterus [ 1,2 ] .
endometriosis occurs in 3 - 10 % of the general female population of reproductive age , 40 - 80 % present symptoms such as pelvic pain , infertility , or both [ 2,3 ] .
endometriosis rarely involves the small intestine , the appendix , the colon , the lung or other tissues [ 4,5 ] .
bowel endometriosis is usually asymptomatic , but it may show non - specific symptoms , such as abdominal colic - like pain , nausea , vomiting , and general symptoms of intestinal obstruction [ 6,7 ] .
circumferential endometriosis of the rectum should be differentially diagnosed from inflammatory or malignant diseases [ 5 ] .
endometriosis of the appendix usually presents with abdominal pain [ 8 ] .
the presence and / or association of appendiceal endometriosis , concomitant with rectal endometriosis , is possible , because endometriosis could occur in more than one anatomical location at the same time .
a pubmed search revealed less than 20 reported cases of large bowel obstruction due to endometriosis in the last 10 years .
in none of these reports was the appendix involved .
we add here an additional case report .
we present a case of rectal endometriosis and bowel obstruction , together with appendiceal endometriosis , diagnosed after surgical treatment in a female patient of reproductive age .
case report a 36 - year - old greek woman was admitted to the emergency room of our hospital with signs of acute abdomen .
at admission , the physical examination revealed abdominal pain and abdominal distention .
our patient also complained of constipation and failure to pass gas or feces for three days .
on physical examination , our patient had a painful distended abdomen .
digital examination revealed an empty rectum .
an x - ray of her abdomen revealed a bowel obstruction ( figure 1 ) .
the impression was that the large bowel obstruction was due to a tumor .
figure 1 abdominal x - ray shows dilatation of proximal bowel segments .
our patient had undergone a cesarean section for delivery of her first child , 12 years before this admission , in another country .
one year after the cesarean , she was operated on for symphysiolysis because of an acute bowel obstruction .
after that surgery our patient started taking oral contraception which she stopped when she decided to have a second pregnancy .
the second child was delivered normally .
she then resumed taking oral contraception for two years , and stopped .
she then started having symptoms of menstrual irregularity and cyclic menstrual pain , but she did not seek any medical help .
our patient underwent exploratory laparotomy because of the bowel obstruction .
there were adhesions in her abdomen between her appendix , uterus , the sigmoid and her left ureter .
her appendix was found with small abnormal lesions , and an appendectomy was performed .
during adhesiolysis , the left ureter was injured , and it was restored at this point using a pig - tail .
her bowel was swollen and the feces could not pass through .
the rectum stenosis ( almost complete obstruction ) was located 8 - 10 cm from her anus .
a rectosigmoidectomy with rectal stump closure and temporary colostomy ( hartmann 's procedure ) was performed .
our patient recovered and was sent home .
the pathology report showed endometriosis of the colon and the appendix ( figures 2 , 3 ) .
because of the double location , the gynecologist prescribed medical treatment with triptorelin 3.75 mg every 28 days .

figure 3 endometrial glands and stoma within muscle coat of the appendix ( h & ex100 ) .
six months after surgery our patient had another operation for the restoration of large bowel continuity .
her bowel was checked and a specimen was sent to the pathologist .
no endometriosis was found .
our patient was doing well at the one - year follow up. discussion although endometriosis of the gastrointestinal tract was described by marshak and friedman and grimes in the 1950 s [ 9,10 ] , its diagnosis is still very difficult , particularly when it appears as acute obstruction of the abdomen .
there are many theories which have tried to explain the pathogenesis of endometriosis , such as sampson 's theory of retrograde spread , vascular dissemination , colonic metaplasia , autoimmune disease , and others [ 11 ] .
the ectopic endometrial tissue and its behavior can also be explained by these theories and the effect of the ovarian hormones [ 12 ] .
the progressing processes taking place explain the fibrotic change in the wall of the bowel and the obstruction [ 12 ] .
the symptoms of intestinal endometriosis vary according to the site of involvement .
tauhe symptoms of bowel endometriosis are usually abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , fecal tenesmus , painful defecation , alternating constipation and diarrhea distention , and rectal bleeding [ 13,14 ] .
it has to be mentioned that the endometrial foci might have malignant transformation [ 15 ] .
it is known that the occurrence of endometriosis in the general female population is lower than in that of reproductive age , while the occurrence in endopelvic and gastrointestinal locations is at 5 - 15 % of patients of reproductive age [ 5,6,16,17 ] .
gastrointestinal endometriosis ( 3 - 37 % of an ectopic location ) may affect the ileum , appendix , sigmoid colon and rectum [ 6 ] with a more frequent location in the rectosigmoid ( 50 - 90 %). of the patients with a rectosigmoid location , only a few cases have been reported as an acute abdomen [ 6,7 ] .
in a large series of patients with endometriosis , the number with intestinal endometriosis and obstruction was between 0.1 % and 0.7 % [ 18,19 ] ; therefore , the present case still remains very interesting , because of the diagnostic difficulties .
intestinal endometriosis often presents as a sub - mucosal tumor or luminal stenosis , because it mainly involves the muscularis propria and subserosa or mesentery .
diagnostic pre - operative evaluation in patients with chronic symptoms is easier and should include computed tomography ( ct ) scans , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , and a positron emission tomography ( pet ) scan to avoid false positive diagnosis of malignancy [ 20 ] .
due to the emergency of our case , no ct scan was performed .
another diagnostic problem is the intact mucosa and annular lesion in the bowel wall in the case of diagnostic endoscopy .
in the present case , endometriosis was presented as acute abdomen with rectosigmoid obstruction , so our patient was treated as an emergency case with no diagnostic endoscopy .
therefore , in emergency cases like ours , surgical treatment should be considered even when the differential diagnosis of malignancy is not certain .
the histological changes of the intestine wall involving endometriosis are located between muscular fibers , subserosa , and serosa , and the mucosa is mostly intact .
in our patient , the pathologist findings showed the annular lesion of endometriosis and the intact mucosa .
our patient also had endometriosis of the appendix , although the predominant symptoms were only from the rectosigmoid obstruction .
endometriosis of the appendix occurs in approximately 2.8 % of patients suffering from endometriosis , and may present with chronic pelvic pain or with symptoms of acute appendicitis [ 8,21 ] .
in our patient , chronic pain was present but it was not the main symptom .
the treatment of patients with endometriosis is , in general , conservative ( for example oral contraceptive , danazol , gonadotropin - releasing hormones , prostaglandin inhibitors ) in order to ameliorate the symptoms .
intestinal endometriosis is difficult to diagnose when it presents as an obstruction of the large bowel .
it is also difficult to differentiate it from malignancy .
in the case of an obstruction , the treatment is surgical with removal of ectopic endometrial tissue , followed by confirmation of free margins .
conclusions endometriosis of the bowel may present as a large bowel obstruction .
to get the diagnosis is difficult because of the limited diagnostic procedures .
in our case , final diagnosis could only be given by the pathologist report .
in women of reproductive age , the surgeon should consider endometriosis as a differential diagnosis in cases of various gastrointestinal symptoms .
therefore , multidisciplinary care should be encouraged to ensure correct evaluation and improve the management of these patients .

abstract in order to meet the need of consumer preferences for natural flavor compounds , microbial synthesis method has become a very attractive alternative to the chemical production .
the 2 - phenylethanol ( 2 - pe ) and its ester 2 - phenylethylacetate ( 2 - peac ) are two extremely important flavor compounds with a rose - like odor .
in recent years , escherichia coli and yeast have been metabolically engineered to produce 2 - pe. however , a metabolic engineering approach for 2 - peac production is rare .
here , we designed and expressed a 2 - peac biosynthetic pathway in e. coli .
this pathway comprised four steps : aminotransferase ( aro8 ) for transamination of l - phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate , 2 - keto acid decarboxylase kdc for the decarboxylation of the phenylpyruvate to phenylacetaldehyde , aldehyde reductase yjgb for the reduction of phenylacetaldehyde to 2 - pe , alcohol acetyltransferase atf1 for the esterification of 2 - pe to 2 - peac .
using the engineered e. coli strain for shake flasks cultivation with 1 g / l l - phenylalanine , we achieved co - production of 268 mg / l 2 - peac and 277 mg / l 2 - pe. our results suggest that approximately 65 % of l - phenylalanine was utilized toward 2 - peac and 2 - pe biosynthesis and thus demonstrate potential industrial applicability of this microbial platform .

2017 ; 6 : e486 https :// doi.org / 10.1002 / mbo3.486 1 introduction 2 - phenylethylacetate ( 2 - peac ) , as a high - value aromatic ester with a rose - like odor , is in high demand and widely used as an additive in food , drinks , perfumes , cosmetics , and household products ( kuo , chen , chen , liu , & shieh , 2014 ) .
in addition , due to its high - energy density , 2 - peac is a potential fuel molecule .
currently , 2 - peac is mainly produced by chemical synthesis ( manabe , iimura , sun , & kobayashi , 2002 ) .
although the chemically synthesized 2 - peac has strong advantages in cost and yield , consumers prefer more natural flavor compounds in the field of food and cosmetics ( etschmann , bluemke , sell , & schrader , 2002 ) .
however , production of natural 2 - peac by extraction from the essential oils of flowers and plants is costly and labor - intensive ( etschmann et al. , 2002 ) .
therefore , the production of 2 - peac using engineered microorganisms can be an attractive alternative to the traditional low - yielding and costly extraction and distillation processes .
many yeast strains naturally produce small amounts 2 - phenylethanol ( 2 - pe ) and 2 - peac from the catabolism of amino acids via the ehrlich pathway : phenylpyruvate is decarboxylated to phenylacetaldehyde , then reduced to 2 - pe , and finally , esterified to 2 - peac ( etschmann & schrader , 2006 ) .
several wild yeast have been evaluated the capacity of synthetic 2 - peac ( adler , hugen , wiewiora , & kunz , 2011 ; akita , ida , obata , & hara , 1990 ; lilly , lambrechts , & pretorius , 2000 ; viana , belloch , valles , & manzanares , 2011 ; viana , gil , valles , & manzanares , 2009 ; wittmann , hans , & bluemke , 2002 ) .
recently , microbial production of 2 - pe in engineered e. coli or yeast was reported ( kim , cho , & hahn , 2014 ; kim , lee , & oh , 2014 ; yigal , zohar , & ayelet , 2014 ; yin et al. , 2015 ) .
however , the production of 2 - peac by engineered micro - organisms is rare .
in this study , we engineered e. coli to produce 2 - pe by overexpressing 2 - keto acid decarboxylase ( kdc ) , and aldehyde reductase ( yigb ) .
then we further generated a 2 - peac biosynthetic pathway in this 2 - pe - producing strain by overexpressing an alcohol acetyltransferase ( atf1 ) for the subsequent esterification 2 - pe to 2 - peac .
finally , we improved 2 - peac production by increasing the precursor substrate availability ( figure 1 ) .

cells were selected on lb plates containing kanamycin ( 50 mg / l ) .
2.4 shake flask cultures recombinant strains of e. coli were streaked onto lb agar plates with antibiotics ( 50 mg / l kanamycin ) and incubated at 37degreesc for 12 - 20 hr. single colonies were picked and inoculated into 5 ml lb medium in 20 - ml flasks .
flasks were incubated at 37degreesc in a rotary shaker at 200 rpm for 12 hr. cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 g for 1 min , resuspended in 100 ml modified m9 medium as previously described by guo , zhu , deng , & liu ( 2014 ) , and shaken as above .
when the od600 reached 0.8 , iptg was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mmol / l. samples were taken at 28 hr after fermentation and analyzed by gc / ms .
2.5 gc / ms analysis of 2 - pe and 2 - peac cultures samples ( 15 ml ) were transferred to 50 - ml glass tubes with glass stop corks .
glass beads were added to disrupt the cells by vigorous shaking .
2 - pe or 2 - peac was extracted using 15 ml chloroform followed by centrifugation at 8,000g for 3 min .
the chloroform phase was withdrawn , evaporated to dryness , and redissolved in 0.6 ml chloroform .
gc / ms analysis of 2 - pe or 2 - peac dissolved in chloroform phase was performed on a series 7890a gc system equipped with a series 5975c ei msd detector ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca ) .
the chloroform phase ( 1 mul ) was analyzed after splitless injection on a db - 5 ms capillary column ( 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 m , agilent technologies ) .
helium was used as the carrier gas .
injector and detector temperatures were 270degreesc and 250degreesc , respectively .
the following temperature program was applied : 100degreesc for 3 min , an increase in 12degreesc / min to 200degreesc .
quantification was done by using 2 - phenethylpropionat as internal standard .
3 results 3.1 construction of 2 - pe biosynthetic pathway in escherichia coli the gene kdc which encode 2 - keto acid decarboxylase was amplified from s. cerevisiae and introduced to e. coli mg1655 strain to yield e. coli mg1655 / pdg30 .
the recombinant and the control strains were cultured in a modified m9 media and the 2 - pe production was analyzed by gc - ms ( figure s1 ) .
no 2 - pe was detected in the negative control strain e. coli .
in contrast , 85.7 +/ - 4.34 mg / l of 2 - pe was formed in the recombinant strains ( table 3 ) .
this result suggests that there is an endogenous phenylacetaldehyde reductase in e. coli .
table 3 2 - pe and 2 - peac production in engineered e. coli strains from glucose in shake flasks for 28 hr. all experiments were performed in triplicate and error bars show s.d production ( mg / l ) the engineered e. coli strains mg1655 / pdg30a mg1655 / pdg34b mg1655 / pdg35c mg1655 / pdg36d 2 - pe 85.7 +/ - 4.34 180.9 +/ - 4.23 95.9 +/ - 5.28 45.9 +/ - 2.20 2 - peac 53.7 +/ - 2.83 a expression of kdc .
b co - expression of kdc and yjgb .
c co - expression of kdc and adh6 .
d co - expression of kdc , yjgb and atf1 .
john wiley & sons , ltd yjgb has been identified as aldehyde reductase in e. coli and can accept a broadly range of various aldehydes as substrates for the various alcohols production ( guo , hong , & xun , 2015 ; rodriguez & atsumi , 2014 ) .
to improve the production of 2 - pe , yjgb was amplified and co - expressed with kdc in e. coli .
the overexpression of the yjgb gene resulted in an approximately 110 % increase in 2 - pe production up to 180.9 +/ - 4.23 mg / l ( table 3 ) .
an aldehyde reductase adh6 gene from s. cerevisiae , which shows high activity for the various short - chain alcohols production ( larroy et al .
2002 ) , was also co - expressed with kdc and resulted in a small increase of 2 - pe ( table 3 ) .
this result suggests that phenylacetaldehyde is not a good substrate for adh6 .
3.2 construction of 2 - peac biosynthetic pathway in escherichia coli alcohol acyltransferase ( aat ) plays a major role in the biosynthesis of acetate esters in plant and yeast .
an alcohol acetyltransferase ( atf1 ) from s. cerevisiae was previously discovered and shown to exhibit a broadly substrate specificity for short - chain alcohols , fatty alcohols and 2 - pe ( guo et al. , 2015 ; rodriguez , tashiro , & atsumi , 2014 ; saerens , delvaux , verstrepen , & thevelein , 2010 ; tai , xiong , & zhang , 2015 ; yoshimoto , fukushige , yonezawa , & sone , 2002 ) .
after succeeding in demonstrated the biosynthesis of 2 - pe in e. coli , we further generated a 2 - peac biosynthetic pathway in this 2 - pe - producing strain by overexpressing atf1 for the subsequent esterification 2 - pe to 2 - peac .
2 - peac was extracted from recombinant e. coli mg1655 / pdg36 and analyzed by gc / ms ( figure s1 ) .
induction of the engineered pathway in recombinant e. coli in a modified m9 media resulted in the accumulation of 2 - peac with a titer of 53.7 +/ - 2.83 mg / l ( table 3 ) .
3.3 increase 2 - peac production by adding the precursor substrate phenylpyruvate phenylpyruvate is the precursor substrate for the biosynthesis of 2 - peac .
therefore , we hypothesized that increasing phenylpyruvate availability would improve 2 - peac production .
in this study , we evaluated the effect of the adding phenylpyruvate ( 1.0 g / l ) for the biosynthesis of 2 - peac in engineered strain mg1655 / pdg36 .
strain grown in 1.0 g / l phenylpyruvate showed a high molar yield .
in this medium , mg1655 / pdg36 strain produced up to 432.4 +/ - 8.22 mg / l 2 - pe with the molar yield of 0.58 mol / mol and 247.3 +/ - 4.99 mg / l 2 - peac with the molar yield of 0.25 mol / mol ( figure s2 ) .
this results suggested that phenylpyruvate availability is a bottleneck for the biosynthesis of 2 - peac .
3.4 the biosynthesis of 2 - peac from l - phenylalanine although the precursor substrate phenylpyruvate can be de novo synthesized from glucose , the efficiency is quite low because of feedback regulations in many branched metabolic pathways ( manuel et al. , 2009 ) .
another strategy is transamination of l - phenylalanine to phenylpyruvate by aminotransferase .
several groups have demonstrated the biosynthesis of 2 - pe from l - phenylalanine with a high titer by transamination ( kim , cho , et al. , 2014 ; yin et al. , 2015 ) .
the gene aro8 which encode aminotransferase was amplified from s. cerevisiae and introduced to 2 - peac - producing strain .
in this study , we evaluated the biosynthesis of 2 - peac from l - phenylalanine ( the range from 0.5 to 2 g / l ) in engineered strain mg1655 / pdg37 .
the titer of 2 - pe and 2 - peac is presented in figure s3 .
strain grown in 1.0 g / l of l - phenylalanine showed the highest the molar yield of 2 - peac .
in this medium , mg1655 / pdg37 strain produced up to 277.6 +/ - 4.26 mg / l 2 - pe with the molar yield of 0.38 mol / mol and 268.8 +/ - 4.21 mg / l 2 - peac with the molar yield of 0.27 mol / mol ( table 4 ) .
a large amount of 2 - pe failed to be effectively converted to 2 - peac , suggesting that alcohol acetyltransferase atf1 is a another bottleneck for the biosynthesis of 2 - peac ( figure s3 ) .
table 4 2 - pe and 2 - peac production in engineered strain mg1655 / pdg37 ( co - expression of aro8 , kdc , yjgb and atf1 ) with modified m9 medium containing 0.5 , 1.0 , or 2.0 g / l of l - phenylalanine in shake flasks for 28 hr production ( mg / l ) the concentration of l - phenylalanine 0.5 g / l 1 g / l 2 g / l 2 - pe 104.1 +/ - 7.61 277.6 +/ - 4.26 364.3 +/ - 9.28 2 - peac 199.8 +/ - 6.55 268.8 +/ - 4.21 180.7 +/ - 8.03 all experiments were performed in triplicate and error bars show s.d. john wiley & sons , ltd 4 discussion flavor compounds are in high demand and widely used as an additive in food and cosmetics industry .
the production of natural flavor compounds has recently attracted a great deal of interest and represents a challenging target for synthetic biology research ( kuo et al. , 2014 ) .
in order to meet the need of consumer preferences for natural flavor compounds , microbial synthesis method has become a very attractive alternative to the chemical production .
the 2 - pe and its ester , 2 - peac , are two extremely important flavor compounds with a rose - like odor .
in recent years , e. coli and yeast have been metabolically engineered to produce 2 - pe , by overexpressing the ehrlich pathway enzymes 2 - keto acid decarboxylase ( kdc ) and alcohol dehydrogenase ( adh ) ( daisuke , hayato , kunihiko , takashi , & kiyofumi , 2012 ; kim , cho , et al. , 2014 ) .
shen , nishimura , matsuda , ishii , & kondo , 2016 ; reported that a 2 - pe biosynthetic s. cerevisiae strain with overexpression of aro10 and deletion of aro8 ( aromatic aminotransferases ) produced 96 mg / l 2 - pe ( shen et al. , 2016 ) .
kang , zhang , du , & chen , 2014 ; constructed a heterologous pathway to produce 2 - pe in a phenylalanine - producing e. coli. with overexpression of adh1 ( alcohol dehydrogenase ) from s. cerevisiae and kdc ( phenylpyruvate decarboxylase ) from pichia pastoris gs115 , this modified strain produced 285 mg / l 2 - pe ( kang et al. , 2014 ) .
however , a metabolic engineering approach for 2 - peac production is rare .
several enzymatic methods have been reported for the preparation of 2 - peac by lipase ( kuo , liu , chen , chang , & shieh , 2013 ; kuo et al. , 2012 ) .
however , there are some drawbacks by using enzymes in bioprocesses such as the need of long and complicated steps for enzyme isolation and purification .
in this study , a fermentative route was created using an engineered e. coli for biosynthesis of 2 - peac from l - phenylalanine based on atf1 .
the results suggest that approximately 65 % of l - phenylalanine was utilized toward 2 - peac and 2 - pe biosynthesis and thus demonstrate potential industrial applicability of this microbial platform .
gc / ms analysis of extracts from the strain of our study revealed that a large number of 2 - pe failed to be effectively converted to 2 - peac , suggesting that atf1 is a bottleneck for further improvement of 2 - peac biosynthesis .
thus , improving of the catalytic activity of atf1 through protein engineering or identification a better alcohol acetyltransferase to replace atf1 in the future is a promising strategy for enhancing 2 - peac production in genetically engineered microorganisms .

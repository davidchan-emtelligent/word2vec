microrna - 200c ( mir - 200c ) recently was found to have tumor - suppressive properties by inhibiting the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in several cancers .
mir - 200c also interacts with various cellular signaling molecules and regulates many important signaling pathways .
in this study , we investigated the radiosensitizing effect of mir - 200c and its mechanism in a panel of human cancer cell lines .
malignant glioma ( u251 , t98g ) , breast cancer ( mda - mb - 468 ) , and lung carcinoma ( a549 ) cells were transfected with control pre - microrna , pre - mir - 200c , or anti - mir - 200c .
then , rt - pcr , clonogenic assays , immunoblotting , and immunocytochemisty were performed .
to predict the potential targets of mir - 200c , microrna databases were used for bioinformatics analysis .
ectopic overexpression of mir - 200c downregulated p - egfr and p - akt and increased the radiosensitivity of u251 , t98g , a549 , and mda - mb - 468 cells .
in contrast , mir - 200c inhibition upregulated p - egfr and p - akt , and decreased radiation - induced cell killing .
mir - 200c led to persistent gammah2ax focus formation and downregulated pdna - pkc expression .
autophagy and apoptosis were major modes of cell death .
bioinformatics analysis predicted that mir - 200c may be associated with egfr , akt2 , mapk1 , vegfa , and hif1an .
we also confirmed that mir - 200c downregulated the expression of vegf , hif - 1alpha , and mmp2 in u251 and a549 cells .
in these cells , overexpressing mir - 200c inhibited invasion , migration , and vascular tube formation .
these phenotypic changes were associated with e - cadherin and epha2 downregulation and n - cadherin upregulation .
mir - 200c showed no observable cytotoxic effect on normal human fibroblasts and astrocytes .
taken together , our data suggest that mir - 200c is an attractive target for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy via a unique modulation of the complex regulatory network controlling cancer pro - survival signaling and emt .
microrna - 200c egfr - associated signaling network radiosensitization human cancer cells introduction micrornas ( mirnas ) are important regulators of cell signaling pathways crucial for the growth of human cancer cells [ 1 ] .
cancer - associated mirnas are located downstream of major oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that act as transcription factors [ 2 ] .
alterations in mirnas can result in cancer genesis and progression .
for example , levels of some mirnas are decreased in human cancers [ 3 ] .
therefore , understanding the regulatory function of mirnas during tumor progression will contribute to the development of targeted molecular therapies .
a member of the mirna - 200 family , mirna - 200c ( mir - 200c ) , recently was found to have tumor - suppressive properties by inhibiting the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) process in several cancers .
in primary glioblastoma multiforme ( gbm ) tissues , mir - 200c and e - cadherin were found to be downregulated when epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) was highly amplified [ 4 ] .
egfr wild - type non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) cell lines regained sensitivity to egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors when emt was inhibited by mir - 200c overexpression [ 5 ] .
mir - 200c also interacts with various cellular signaling molecules and regulates many important signaling pathways , such as stat3 , pi3k / akt [ 6 ] , and erk [ 7 ] .
clinically , analysis of patient data using the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) datasets showed that decreased mir - 200 family expression was associated with poor overall survival in ovarian , renal , lung , and basal - like breast cancers [ 8 ] .
however , at this time , it is not clear whether mir - 200c has a radiosensitizing effect in human cancer cells .
in the present study , we investigated the radiosensitizing effect of mir - 200c and the mechanism of radiosensitization in a panel of human cancer cell lines with activated egfr - associated signaling .
results ectopic overexpression of mir - 200c increases the radiosensitivity of human cancer cells with activated egfr signaling ectopic overexpression of mir - 200c increased the radiosensitivity of gbm ( u251 and t98g ) , nsclc ( a549 ) , and breast cancer ( mda - mb - 468 ) cells .
the sensitizer enhancement ratios ( ser ) , calculated as the isoeffective dose to obtain 50 % survival ( ser0.5 ) , were 1.24 , 1.20 , 1.05 , and 1.12 for u251 , t98g , a549 , and mda - mb - 478 cells , respectively ( supplementary data 1 ) .
in contrast , radiation - induced cell killing was decreased by anti - mir - 200c ( figure 1a - 1d ) .
figure 1 effects of mir - 200c on radiation response and egfr - associated signaling ectopic overexpression of mir - 200c inhibited expression of p - egfr and downstream signaling molecules pi3k 110a , p - akt , and p - erk , and increased the radiosensitivity of u251 ( a ) , t98g ( b ) , a549 ( c ) , and mda - mb - 468 ( d ) cells .
in contrast , mir - 200c inhibition upregulated the expression of the above proteins and decreased radiation - induced cell killing .
points on the survival curves represent surviving fractions calculated from cells treated in triplicate .
each experiment was also repeated three times with similar results .
mir - 200c overexpression induces prolongation of gammah2ax focus formation and down - regulates p - dna - pkcs having demonstrated that mir - 200c increased radiosensitivity in cancer cells with activated egfr signaling , we next planned to confirm the mechanism of radiosensitization .
overexpression of mir - 200c caused a marked prolongation of gammah2ax focus formation 4 hours after irradiation with 6 gy. there was no significant difference in gammah2ax focus formation unless radiation was delivered ( supplementary data 2 ) .
this was associated with a discernible downregulation of p - dna - pkcs , which are involved in the non - homologous end joining repair process following dna double - strand breakage ( figure 2a - 2d ) .
figure 2 overexpression of mir - 200c led to prolonged gammah2ax focus formation and p - dna - pkcs downregulation overexpression of mir - 200c caused a marked prolongation of gammah2ax focus formation at 4 hours after irradiation with 6 gy ( right panels ) and was associated with discernible downregulation of p - dna - pkcs ( left panels ) in u251 ( a ) , t98g ( b ) , a549 ( c ) , and mda - mb - 468 ( d ) cells .
beta - actin was probed as a control .
mode of cell death : apoptosis , autophagy , and senescence the effect of mir - 200c on apoptosis was confirmed using annexin v / propidium iodide ( pi ) double staining [ 9 ] .
treatment of u251 and a549 cells with anti - mir - 200c before irradiation significantly reduced apoptotic or necrotic cell death compared to expression of mir - 200c ( figure 3a ) .
we also examined the expression of caspase - 3 , a key apoptosis - triggering factor , and confirmed that caspase - 3 was upregulated when u251 and a549 cells were treated with both mir - 200c and radiotherapy ( figure 3a ) .
these results showed that mir - 200c and radiotherapy synergistically induced apoptotic cell death in human gbm and nsclc cells .
figure 3 effects of mir - 200c on apoptosis , autophagy , and senescence ( a ) annexin v / propidium iodide ( pi ) double staining was used to assess the degree of apoptosis or necrosis in cells with or without 6 gy of radiation .
treatment with anti - mir - 200c dramatically reduced apoptosis in u251 and a549 cells .
caspase - 3 expression also correlated with apoptosis .
( b ) treatment with both mir - 200c and 6 gy irradiation notably induced autophagy in u251 and a549 cell lines .
on the other hand , anti - mir - 200c treatment rendered both cell lines more resistant to autophagic cell death .
expression of the autophagosome marker lc3 was upregulated after mir - 200c treatment , whereas it was reduced after anti - mir - 200c treatment .
( c ) the effect of mir - 200c on cellular senescence was not significant compared to normal control cells or cells treated with anti - mir - 200c as determined by beta - galactosidase staining .
cellular stressors such as irradiation can trigger senescence signaling cascades that may promote autophagic cell death [ 10 ] .
we evaluated the influence of mir - 200c on the ability of u251 and a549 cells to form autophagosomes , which are associated with autophagy or autophagic cell death .
upon mir - 200c overexpression , u251 and a549 cell lines showed a significantly higher degree of accumulation of acidic compartments , as demonstrated by labeling cells with lysotracker and subsequent analysis by fluorescence microscopy .
in both cell lines , treatment with mir - 200c and irradiation ( 6 gy ) resulted in lysosomal localization of lysotracker within 24 hours of treatment ( figure 3b ) .
to elucidate the mechanism underlying autophagy in u251 and a549 cell lines , we investigated the effects of mir - 200c and anti - mir - 200c on the conversion of microtubule - associated protein light chain ( lc3 ) , an autophagosome marker .
both cell lines were positive for the unconjugated ( lc3 - i ) and the conjugated ( lc3 - ii ) forms as determined by western blotting .
however , treatment with mir - 200c upregulated lc3 - ii expression in 24 hours ( figure 3b ) .
the amount of lc3 - ii protein is associated with the number of autophagosomes [ 11 ] .
according to these results , mir - 200c and radiation synergistically induced autophagic cell death in gbm and nsclc cells .
however , the effects of mir - 200c on cellular senescence as determined by beta - galactosidase staining indicated no significant difference from normal controls or cells treated with anti - mir - 200c ( figure 3c ) .
target prediction and confirmation for mir - 200c bioinformatics analysis predicted that egfr had the high probability of being a mir - 200c target ( supplementary data 3 ) .
thus , the cell lines used in the current study should be valid tools to determine this because of their activated egfr signaling status .
western blot analysis confirmed that mir - 200c overexpression decreased the expression of p - egfr ( figure 1 ) .
regarding signaling pathways , we focused on pathways that were previously reported to be associated with radiosensitivity such as pi3k / akt and erk [ 12 , 13 ] .
these pathways are well known to decrease radiation - induced cell apoptosis and increase cell proliferation .
bioinformatics analysis also suggested pi3k , akt , and erk1 / 2 as putative targets of mir - 200c .
as presented in figure 1 , the ectopic overexpression of mir - 200c led to attenuated formation of pi3k 110alpha , p - akt , and p - erk .
angiogenesis and emt - associated genes such as vegfa , hif1an , and cdh1 , were predicted as target genes of mir - 200c .
we performed western blots and validated the effect of mir - 200c on vegf , e - cadherin , and n - cadherin .
ectopic expression of mir - 200c inhibits angiogenesis , invasion , and migration overexpression of mir - 200c led to discernible inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry and was associated with downregulation of vegf , hif - 1alpha , and mmp2 .
the overexpression of vegf in human cancer cell lines u251 and a549 was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using an anti - vegf antibody .
however , treating these cell lines with mir - 200c resulted in significantly lower vegf expression ( figure 4a and 4b ) .
figure 4 effects of mir - 200c on vascular tube formation overexpression of mir - 200c led to a discernible inhibition of vasculogenic mimicry and was associated with downregulation of vegf , hif - 1alpha , and mmp2 .
vegf antibody staining also confirmed the downregulation of vegf in cell lines u251 and a549 upon treatment with mir - 200c ( a and b ) .
to explore the crucial role of mir200c in emt through controlling cell migration and polarity , we evaluated invasion and migration in the panel of human cancer cells .
overexpressing mir - 200c significantly inhibited the invasion potential of u251 and a549 cells ( figure 5a ) .
mir - 200c also significantly compromised migration in u251 and a549 cells as determined by wound healing assay , while a mir - 200c inhibitor restored the migration potential ( figure 5b ) .
as shown in figure 5c , u251 and a549 cells treated with mir - 200c exhibited downregulated e - cadherin and upregulated n - cadherin .
expression of epha2 also was significantly reduced after treatment with mir - 200c , whereas cells treated with anti - mir - 200c had dramatically increased epha2 expression .
figure 5 effects of mir - 200c on invasion and migration potential and e - cadherin , n - cadherin , and epha2 expression ( a ) overexpression of mir - 200c significantly inhibited the invasion potential of u251 and a549 cells .
( b ) mir - 200c significantly compromised the migration potential of u251 and a549 cells , which was restored by mir - 200c inhibition .
overexpressing mir - 200c increased e - cadherin expression while treatment with anti - mir - 200c decreased e - cadherin expression .
anti - mir - 200c also enhanced epha2 expression whereas u251 and a549 cells incubated with anti - mir - 200c exhibited a significant upregulation of epha2 expression ( c ) .
normal cell toxicity to evaluate the toxicity of mir - 200c in normal cells , a clonogenic assay was performed .
the ectopic expression of mir - 200c resulted in no observable cytotoxic effect on normal human fibroblasts or normal human astrocytes ( figure 6 ) .
figure 6 testing toxicity of mir - 200c in normal cells ectopic overexpression of mir - 200c did not alter the radiosensitivity of normal human astrocytes ( a ) or normal human fibroblasts ( b ) .
points on the survival curves represent mean surviving fractions calculated from the treated cells in triplicate .
each experiment was also repeated three times with similar results .
discussion mirnas have complex interactions with mrnas , but a few of their targets have been revealed by experiments .
to overcome the limited experimental data , several mirna target prediction algorithms have been developed .
we used multiple target prediction algorithms to establish target gene candidates of mir - 200c as previously reported [ 12 ] , since the computational results often have inconsistencies [ 14 ] .
predicted targets were confirmed by western blotting .
our results suggested that mir - 200c is an important modulator of the egfr pro - survival cell signaling network implicated in the radiation response of human cancer cells .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report to evaluate the regulatory role of mir - 200c in response to radiation in gbm cells .
inhibiting the pi3k / akt signaling complex increased radiosensitivity in egfr - activated cells by suppressing pro - survival signaling and dna damage repair [ 15 ] .
in our previous reports [ 12 , 13 ] , we observed that overexpressing mirnas was associated with downregulated egfr - associated signaling and increased radiosensitivity of human cancer cells that have activated egfr and / or co - activation of pi3k - akt signaling .
overexpression of mirnas led to impaired dna damage repair , which was associated with downregulated p - atm or p - dna - pk. here we also report that overexpressing mir - 200c resulted in findings indicating impaired dna damage repair .
we therefore speculated the same radiosensitization mechanism resulted from inhibiting the egfr - associated signaling network .
the additional regulatory roles of mir - 200c in important cellular signaling pathways other than pi3k - akt or erk have been reported .
in breast cancer cells , mir - 200c suppressed ubiquilin - 1 expression and enhanced radiation - induced autophagy [ 16 ] .
tank - binding kinase - 1 ( tbk1 ) , also a reported target of mir - 200c , inhibits radiation - induced apoptosis in breast cancer and nsclc cells [ 17 , 18 ] .
enhanced chemosensitivity by mir - 200c was also reported to occur through the akt [ 19 , 20 ] and jnk2 / c - jun [ 21 ] signaling pathways .
notch signaling activation was also reported to be regulated by mir - 200c in human cancer cell lines [ 22 , 23 ] .
notch genes are responsible for the expression of transmembrane receptors involved in communication between cells that are in contact .
the notch signaling network has been associated with radioresistance , and has been suggested to be a novel therapeutic target for cancer treatment [ 24 - 26 ] .
mirnas also affect a particular set of pro - survival cellular signals that enhance emt , conferring cells with the ability to achieve carcinogenesis and invasiveness .
recently , a correlation between emt and radioresistance was reported .
in a gene signature study using gene expression omnibus ( geo ; glioma patients ) and tcga ( gbm patients ) datasets , samples with a radioresistant phenotype were enriched with emt - related genes , while samples with a radiosensitive phenotype had decreased levels of emt - related genes [ 27 ] .
in vitro , emt - like phenotype and e - cadherin loss induced by hypoxia contributed to radioresistance in breast cancer cells [ 28 ] .
in head and neck cancer patients who had low levels of emt - inhibiting mirna expression pre - treatment , intrinsic radioresistance was confirmed [ 29 ] .
we observed a significant loss of e - cadherin expression upon mir - 200c inhibition in gbm and nsclc cell lines .
one of the first steps in the invasion of malignant cells through a weakened epithelium is loss of e - cadherin expression [ 30 ] and overexpression of n - cadherin [ 31 ] .
loss of e - cadherin in epithelial cells results in the emergence of mesenchymal characteristics during emt [ 32 ] .
we also confirmed that mir - 200c inhibited the invasion and migration potential of gbm and nsclc cell lines with activated egfr pathways .
adam et al .
[ 33 ] observed that the expression of mir - 200c reversed the emt transition in bladder cancer through the egfr signaling pathway .
several groups also reported that the sensitivity of cancer cells to egfr - targeted therapy is associated with e - cadherin expression and other characteristics of typical " epithelial " tumor phenotypes [ 32 , 34 - 37 ] .
these results demonstrated the critical regulatory role of mir - 200c on emt - related signaling pathways through one of the most important cell signaling pathways in cancer , egfr signaling .
mir - 200c particularly suppresses the zinc finger e - box - binding homeobox 1 ( zeb1 )/ e - cadherin axis , an activator of emt and a key promoter of metastasis [ 38 ] .
recent observations have strengthened the role of the zeb1 / mir - 200c regulatory loop during emt ; on the one hand , mir - 200c regulates zeb1 expression ; on the other hand , zeb1 regulates mir - 200c transcription [ 38 , 39 ] .
tissue microarrays of 30 primary gbm samples reported an inverse correlation between mirna - 200c and zeb1 .
gbm samples with high egfr amplification exhibit zeb1 upregulation and mir - 200c downregulation [ 4 ] .
in nsclc cells ( a549 ) , inhibiting tbk1 attenuated radiation - induced emt by activating glycogen synthase kinase - 3beta and decreasing zeb1 expression [ 18 ] .
emt in cancer cells can lead to chemoresistance and radioresistance .
in a study using doxorubicin - resistant mcf - 7 breast cancer cells , loss of mirna - 200c was associated with decreased e - cadherin and pten expression , and increased zeb1 and p - akt expression , which ultimately caused chemoresistance [ 19 ] .
we further confirmed another post - transcriptional role of mir - 200c : inhibiting vascular formation .
it is well known that hif - 1 increases vascular formation , cell survival , invasion , and radioresistance in cancer cells [ 40 , 41 ] .
mmp - 2 and vegf , as transcriptional targets of hif - 1 , play an important role in angiogenesis of nsclc and gbm via the pi3k / akt signaling pathway [ 42 , 43 ] .
in nsclc cells ( a549 ) , mir - 200c was reported to have a radiosensitizing effect by targeting the vegf - vegfr2 pathway [ 44 ] .
therefore , mir - 200c could be a viable target to increase radiation - induced cell killing of human tumor cells .
in this study , we found that mir - 200c significantly suppressed epha2 expression in gbm and nsclc cells .
to our knowledge , this is the first study to report a correlation between mir - 200c and epha2 in gbm and nsclc cells .
epha2 is a member of the eph receptor family , the largest family of tyrosine kinase receptors , which controls cell growth , migration , and differentiation .
in gbm , epha2 was overexpressed [ 45 ] and this was related with invasiveness and poor prognosis [ 46 ] .
similarly , in nsclc , epha2 overexpression was correlated with egfr activation , k - ras mutation , and poor prognosis [ 47 ] .
eph has been proposed as an effective therapeutic target for gbm and nsclc due to the cross - talk that occurs between epha2 and egfr signaling [ 48 - 51 ] .
in conclusion , we confirmed that mir - 200c significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of radiotherapy in a panel of human cancer cell lines .
this radiosensitizing effect was associated with attenuated egfr - associated pro - survival signaling and impaired dna damage repair .
mir - 200c also mitigated emt - related processes such as vascular formation , invasion , and migration .
taken together , our data suggest that mir - 200c is an attractive target for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy via its unique modulation of the complex regulatory network controlling cancer pro - survival signaling and emt .

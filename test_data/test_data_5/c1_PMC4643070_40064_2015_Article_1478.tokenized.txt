to evaluate the degree of heart rate ( hr ) changes at rest ( hrrest ) , during breath hold ( hrtest ) , and during cardiac ct examinations ( hrscan ) in a large group of patients , and to derive and asses the feasibility of a predictive formula for hrscan .
hrrest , hrtest , and hrscan were retrospectively compared in a total of 563 consecutive patients who underwent 320 - row cardiac ct. multiple regression analysis was performed to derive predictive formulae for hrscan in the entire study population and , in each group of patients with decreased ( dec ) or increased ( inc ) hr during breath hold .
the predictive formula was evaluated as accurate when less than 5 % of the actual hrscan exceeded the predicted hrscan by +/ - 5 beats per minute ( bpm ) .
the average values of the hrtest ( 65.3 +/ - 12.0 bpm ) and hrscan ( 63.7 +/ - 11.9 bpm ) significantly decreased from those of the hrrest ( 68.4 +/ - 11.9 bpm ) ( p < 0.0001 ) .
the predictive formula ( hrscan = 3.601 + 0.113hrrest + 0.8hrtest ) was determined to be accurate only in group dec .
the hrtest significantly decreased from the hrrest , and the hrscan significantly decreased from the hrtest .
an accurate predictive formula for hrscan could be built only for group dec .
keywords heart rate 320 - detector row ct breath hold contrast material issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background cardiac computed tomography ( ct ) has long been performed with single - source , 64 - row scanners or less .
scanning the whole heart requires 6 - 10 heartbeats , or even more when scanners have fewer rows of detectors. with the advent of 320 - and 256 - detector row ct and dual - source 64 - row ct with flash mode , it has become possible to perform most adult cardiac ct scans in 1 - 3 heartbeats .
using 320 - row ct , patients with heart rates ( hr ) lower than 75 beats per minute ( bpm ) can be scanned with one beat , with some adjustments in their acquisition windows based on the hr. in particular , the acquisition window should be widened to scan the systolic phase as well as the diastolic phase , when the hr is predicted to be relatively fast .
in contrast , when the hr during the actual scan is lower than expected , the patient would be exposed to unnecessary radiation during systolic scanning .
in this regard , prediction of the scan hr is necessary for patients with low hr , particularly if between 65 and 75 bpm .
for high hr patients , multi - segment reconstruction may be used to improve temporal resolution ( tomizawa et al. 2013 ) .
in multi - segment reconstruction , accurate prediction of hr is necessary to determine the number of scans ( i.e. , heartbeats ) and the time of the gantry rotation , both of which affect temporal resolution ( halliburton et al. 2003 ; herzog et al. 2007 ) .
therefore , hr prediction before cardiac ct scan is crucial for both low and high hr patients .
past studies on changes in hr during breath holding and contrast injection during cardiac ct are small , and gave controversial results .
none of these studies involved 320 - row cardiac ct ( zhang et al. 2008 ; horiguchi et al. 2011 ; christensen et al. 2011 ; becker et al. 2011 ) .
we hypothesized that scan hr ( hrscan ) can be predicted from pre - scan parameters , such as hr at rest ( hrrest ) and during breath hold ( hrtest ) .
methods patients this study was approved by the institutional review board , and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 declaration of helsinki and its later amendments .
the requirement for informed consent to participate in this study was waived , because of the retrospective design .
the patients' records and information were made anonymous before starting the analysis .
the records of 791 consecutive patients ( 470 men , 321 women ; mean age 65.5 +/ - 13.9 years , range 8 - 94 years ) who underwent cardiac ct angiography from august 2011 to july 2013 were retrospectively reviewed .
the patients were suspected of having coronary artery disease , had a history of myocardial infarction , or had a complex cardiac anomaly .
the exclusion criteria were arrhythmia , such as atrial fibrillation and flutter ( n = 43 ) , premature ventricular contraction during hr recording ( n = 16 ) , premature atrial contraction during hr recording ( n = 4 ) , complete left bundle branch block ( n = 4 ) , complete right bundle branch block ( n = 1 ) , proxysmal supraventricular tachycardia ( n = 1 ) , sick sinus syndrome ( n = 1 ) , and sustained ventricular tachycardia ( n = 1 ) ; presence of pacemakers ( n = 7 ) ; wide - volume scanning in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery ( n = 88 ) ; expiratory scanning for ablation planning ( n = 9 ) ; irregular protocol for concurrent evaluation of the pulmonary artery or right ventricle ( n = 8 ) ; pediatric patients ( n = 2 ) ; and inaccurate ecg - recording ( n = 43 ) .
the final study group included 563 patients ( 311 men , 252 women ; mean age 65.2 +/ - 12.9 years , age range 18 - 94 years ; body weight 61.3 +/ - 14.4 kg , range 32 - 142 kg ) .
medications that could possibly influence hrs were beta blockers in 290 patients ( 51.5 %) , digitalis derivatives in 110 patients ( 19.5 %) , calcium channel blockers in 86 patients ( 15.3 %) , nifedipine in 21 patients ( 3.7 %) , anti - arrhythmcs in seven patients ( 1.2 %) , and alpha - blockers in three patients ( 0.5 %) .
ct data acquisition all examinations were performed by 320 - detector ct scanner ( aquilion one vision edition : toshiba , tochigi , japan ) with prospective ecg gating axial scans .
the scanning parameters were as follows : detector configuration , 320 x 0.5 mm ; gantry rotation time , 275 , 300 , 320 or 350 ms depending on breath hold hr ; tube potential , 120 kv ; and tube current , from at 250 to 760 ma depending on body habitus .
acquisition window and number of scans were determined based on the experience of attending radiologists ( em , nt , ky , and sk ) .
patients received 22.2 mgi / kg of iopamidol 370 mgi / ml ( iopamiron 370 : bayer , osaka , japan ) ; the mean volume administered was 45.7 +/ - 10.4 ml ( range , 25 - 96 ml ) over 14 s. bolus tracking was performed using thresholds of 100 ( hu ) in the left ventricle and 260hu in the descending aorta .
patients were assigned to breathe in and hold their breaths after the first threshold .
the scan was immediately started after the second threshold .
as a baseline medication , oral beta - blocker was administered to 116 patients .
for 173 outpatients with hrs higher than 75 bpm , 20 - 40 mg of metoprolol ( lopresor : novartis , tokyo , japan ) , was administered .
the patients were instructed to take the medicines 2 h prior to the examination .
in 2013 , we started to use an intravenous beta - blocker , landiolol at 0.125 mg / kg ( corebeta ; ono pharmaceutical , osaka , japan ) for patients with hrs higher than 75 bpm .
eighteen patients received injection before the test breath hold , and were scanned 4 - 7 min after injection .
before 2013 , no additional beta - blocker was used when the hr was higher than 75 bpm at the time of the examination .
no patients who were administered beta - blockers had contraindications , such as hypotension , more than grade ii atrioventricular block , severe pulmonary hypertension causing right - sided cardiac failure , severe cardiac failure , and allergy to beta - blockers .
there were no side effects from beta - blockers recorded .
all patients received 2.5 mg sublingual isosorbide dinitrate ( nitorol ; eisai , tokyo , japan ) before imaging .
no nitrates were administered to patients with contraindications , such as severe hypotension , closed angle glaucoma , and allergy to nitrates .
acquisition of heart rate hr was recorded in terms of rr interval on ecg ( ivy model 3000 ; chronos , chiba , japan ) .
mean hr during free breathing for 10 s ( hrrest ) was immediately recorded prior to giving instructions for the test breath hold ; the actual test breath hold lasted for 10 s. hrtest was defined as the average hr of four beats , with the first beat designated as the one occurring at 5 s of the test breath hold .
hrscan was defined as the average hr of four consecutive beats , with the second beat corresponding to the first ct cardio angiogram scan ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 definition of the four beats and the timing of exposure .
hrscan was defined as the average hr of consecutive four beats ( arrow ) , with the second beat corresponding to the first ct cardio angiogram scan .
the scan duration took place during the rr interval within the gray box .
the beginning of the scan was the left edge of the gray box , and the end of the scan was the right edge of the gray box statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using jmp pro software ( version 10.0.2 ; sas , cary , nc ) .
quantitative variables were expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation .
the differences in hrrest , hrtest , and hrscan were determined by the bland - altman method and were analyzed in the entire population as well as in the groups of patients in whom the hrtest decreased from the hrrest ( group dec ) and those in whom the hr test increased from the hrrest ( group inc ) .
this analysis based on groups was performed to determine whether the behavior of hr during breath hold was related to the behavior of hr after contrast injection ; for this purpose , multiple regression analysis was performed after extracting patients in whom the hrtest decreased from the hrrest .
the ratios of changes in hrscan in both groups were analyzed using fisher 's exact test .
multiple regression analysis was based on data acquired during odd - numbered months .
the derived multiple regression predictive formula was then applied to data acquired during even - numbered months , to assess accuracy of prediction .
this analysis was performed on the entire study population , group dec , but not on group inc because the number during the even - numbered months ( n = 36 ) was too small to calculate the 5 % assessment of feasibility .
the prediction was evaluated as accurate when less than 5 % of the actual hrscan exceeded the predicted hrscan by +/ - 5 bpm ; this criterion was based on the fact an error of +/ - 5 bpm will result in inadequate 1 - beat scan or unnecessary 2 - beat scan when the predicted hr was 70 - 75 bpm .
a p value of < 0.05 was determined as significant .
the accurate formula was applied to the hrrest and hrtest to calculate the estimated hrscan .
a theoretical acquisition window based on the predictive formula and percentage of rr interval was determined from the estimated hrscan and was compared with the actual acquisition window .
if the actual acquisition window was longer than the theoretical acquisition window , the examination was determined to have an excessive acquisition window .
the percentage of examinations with excessive acquisition window in the concerned group was estimated .
clinical parameters , such as sex , age , weight , height , body mass index , amount of contrast material , speed , beta - blockers used , history of diabetes mellitus , and standard deviation of hr at rest were compared between the groups dec and inc .
the same parameters were also compared between the patients whose hrscan decreased from hrtest vs hrscan increased from hrtest , in group dec and group inc respectively .
for comparison , student 's t test was applied for quantitative parameters and fisher 's exact test was applied for categorical data .
the significance level was adjusted by bonferroni to 0.05 / 10 = 0.005 .
results the measured hrrest , hrtest , and hrscan are shown in table 1 and fig. 2. hrtest significantly decreased by approximately 3 bpm from the hrrest ; the hrscan significantly decreased by approximately 1.5 bpm from the hrtest .
the average duration between the end of the breath hold instruction and the actual scan was 4.3 s. bland - altman analysis revealed statistically significant differences between hrrest and hrtest and hrtest and hrscan in all groups .
the behavior of hr in groups dec and inc are shown in table 2 .
the ratios of changes in the hrscan in groups dec and inc were not significantly different from each other ( p = 0.83 ) .

this formula was applied to group dec and the estimated hrscan was calculated ; the actual acquisition window was assessed as excessive in 80 patients ( 14.2 %) ( fig. 3 ). fig. 3 ecg - gated cardiac ct with curved multi - planar reconstruction in a 68 - year - old man with multiple coronary risks .

the hr test decreased from hr rest in approximately 90 % of patients , but increased from hrrest in 10 % of patients .
hrscan significantly decreased from hrtest , regardless of the changes in hr during breath hold .
for group dec , it was feasible to predict hrscan from hrrest and hrtest with the formula that we specified , with 14.2 % of the scans having an excessive acquisition window .
the rr interval is influenced by various factors , such as arterial pressure receptors , chemical receptors , cardiac receptors , and stretch receptors in the lungs and thoracic cavity ( wheeler and watkins 1973 ; horiguchi et al. 2006 ; cooke et al. 1998 ; clynes 1960 ; angelone and coulter 1964 ) .
respiration is the most influential factor for the rr interval ; upon inhalation , a negative intrathoracic pressure increases venous return and hr ( clynes 1960 ) .
however , although hr increases for 4 s , it is also known to decrease for 10 s afterwards ; this may explain the behavior of hr during breath hold ( clynes 1960 ) .
although the hrtest and hrscan in the present study were recorded to be approximately 4 s after the breath hold instruction , patients started holding their breaths after the inhalation instruction that came before the breath hold .
therefore , we consider that breath hold duration was actually longer than 4 s. decrease of the hrscan from the hrtest may be partially explained by deep inhalation during breath hold at scanning .
one possible explanation for the hrscan being lower than the hrtest is the difference in frequency and depth of respiration , which are known to influence rr interval ( angelone and coulter 1964 ) .
fast contrast injection may also contribute to decrease in hr , but we could not find the supporting evidence .
the results of previous small - scale studies that determined hrscan decreasd from hrtest have been heterogeneous and controversial .
zhang studied 101 patients who underwent 64 - row cardiac ct and concluded that hr decreased by approximately 4 bpm during breath hold , but was same during the scan and at rest ( zhang et al. 2008 ) .
horiguchi analyzed 112 patients who underwent 64 - row coronary ct and found that hr during coronary angiogram scan was almost the same as the hr during non - contrast calcium scoring scan obtained with breath hold ( horiguchi et al. 2011 ) .
they also found that hr range was wider during coronary angiogram scan than during calcium scoring scan ; therefore .
hr during coronary angiogram scan may be difficult to predict .
christensen studied 64 - row cardiac ct in 60 patients and compare iopamidol - 370 versus iodixanol - 320 ( christensen et al. 2011 ) .
they found no significant hr changes between the breath hold hr and scan hr when iopamidol - 370 was used ; whereas the scan hr significantly decreased by approximately 2 bpm from breath hold hr when iodixanol - 320 was injected , by about 2 bpm .
becker studied 64 - row dual - source cardiac ct in 96 patients and compared iomeprol - 400 versus iso - osmolar iodixanol - 320 ; they concluded that there were no significant hr changes between the calcium scoring scan and coronary angiogram scan ( becker et al. 2011 ) .
the results of the present study on a large population shows that both breath hold and contrast injection were associated with significant decreases in hr during scanning , at least for 320 - row cardiac ct. the derived predictive formula was feasible for group dec and could retrospectively determine the examinations with theoretically excessive acquisition window .
as a next step , we would like to prospectively apply this formula on patients with decreased hr during breath hold to predict the hr at scan and to determine the width of acquisition window .
further validation of the formula would be possible by comparing image qualities between experience - based and formula - based cardiac ct scans .
for group inc , we could not derive a predictive formula because the number of patients was too small to perform a feasibility study .
as shown in table 2 , the hrscan increased from the hrtest in 21.7 % of patients in the group in. this percentage of patients was prone to scan failure , particularly when hr was 65 - 75 bpm .
therefore , if a patient showed increase in hr during breath hold , it may be better to widen the acquisition window when the rest hr was higher than 65 bpm , and to increase the number of scans when the rest hr was higher than 75 bpm .
this study had some limitations .
we could not analyze variation in hr in a longer span of time because the hrrest was recorded for only 10 s , whereas some of the past pulmonary or abdominal studies recorded the rest hr for 5 min ( chartrand - lefebvre et al. 2011 ; sahani et al. 2007 ; romano et al. 2009 ) .
this restriction was due to the original setting of the ecg that we used .
another limitation was the likelihood that the timing of starting inhalation and breath hold varied from patient to patient .
many patients started to inhale at the beginning of instructions , but some started after the end of instructions for inhalation , or even after the breath hold instruction .
conclusions the hrtest significantly decrease by approximately 3 bpm from the hrrest in 90 % , and the hrscan significantly decrease by approximately 1.5 bpm from the hrtest .
predictive formula for hrscan seems to be accurate and prevent excessive acquisition window for group dec patients .

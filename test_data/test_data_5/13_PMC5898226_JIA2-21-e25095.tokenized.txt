abstract introduction awareness of hiv - infection goes beyond diagnosis , and encompasses understanding , acceptance , disclosure and initiation of the hiv - care .
we aimed to characterize the hiv - positive population that underwent repeat hiv - testing without disclosing their serostatus and the impact on estimates of the first unaids 90 target .
methods this analysis was nested in a prospective cohort established in southern mozambique which conducted three hiv - testing modalities : voluntary counselling and testing ( vct ) , provider - initiated counselling and testing ( pict ) and home - based testing ( hbt ) .
participants were given the opportunity to self - report their status to lay counsellors and hiv - positive diagnoses were verified for previous enrolment in care .
this study included 1955 individuals diagnosed with hiv through vct / pict and 11,746 participants of a hbt campaign .
those who did not report their serostatus prior to testing , and were found to have a previous hiv - diagnosis , were defined as non - disclosures .
venue - stratified descriptive analyses were performed and factors associated with non - disclosure were estimated through log - binomial regression .
results in the first round of 2500 adults randomized for hbt , 1725 were eligible for testing and 18.7 % self - reported their hiv - positivity. of those tested with a positive result , 38.9 % were found to be non - disclosures .
similar prevalence of non - disclosures was found in clinical - testing modalities , 29.4 % ( 95 % ci 26.7 to 32.3 ) for pict strategy and 13.0 % ( 95 % ci 10.9 to 15.3 ) for vct .
prior history of missed visits ( adjusted prevalence ratio ( apr ) 4.2 , 95 % ci 2.6 to 6.8 ) , younger age ( apr 2.5 , 95 % ci 1.4 to 4.4 ) and no prior history of treatment (( apr ) 1.4 , 95 % ci 1.0 to 2.1 ) were significantly associated with non - disclosure as compared to patients who self - reported .
when considering non - disclosures as people living with hiv ( plwhiv ) aware of their hiv - status , the proportion of plwhiv aware increased from 78.3 % ( 95 % ci 74.2 to 81.6 ) to 86.8 % ( 95 % ci 83.4 to 89.6 ) .
conclusion more than one - third of individuals testing hiv - positive did not disclose their previous positive hiv - diagnosis to counsellors .
this proportion varied according to testing modality and age .
in the absence of an efficient and non - anonymous tracking system for hiv - testers , repeat testing of non - disclosures leads to wasted resources and may distort programmatic indicators .
developing interventions that ensure appropriate psychosocial support are needed to encourage this population to disclose their status and optimize scarce resources .

2018 ; 21 ( 4 ) : e25095 1 introduction in 2014 , unaids set the ambitious global strategy of reaching the 90 - 90 - 90 targets to end the hiv epidemic by 2020 1 .
this plan established that 90 % of the people living with hiv ( plwhiv ) will know their hiv - status , 90 % of those will be on antiretroviral therapy ( art ) , and 90 % of those on art will reach viral suppression .
there has been a 29 % decline in new hiv infections in adults from 2010 to 2016 in eastern and southern africa , even though , this region remains the most severely affected , where almost 19.4 million people are currently infected with hiv 2 , 3 .
despite the progress , important challenges remain unresolved .
globally , in 2016 , 30 % of the 36.7 million plwhiv did not know their hiv - status and 47 % did not receive art 3 .
awareness of hiv infection is the first critical step in the continuum of hiv care .
however , it goes far beyond hiv serological testing and includes an understanding of the implications , acceptance of the diagnosis , willingness to disclose their status to health providers , family members and close community 4 , 5 , 6 and enrol and start in hiv care and treatment .
little is known about the extent and causes of non - disclosure in different epidemic settings although it has an important impact both at an individual and at a public health level .
non - disclosure may lead to repeated hiv - testing and / or repeated drop out and re - engagement in hiv care after a positive hiv - diagnosis 7 .
efforts to quantify and describe testing inefficiencies will contribute to optimize resources to reach the 90 - 90 - 90 objectives in high burden areas of sub - saharan africa .
accurate indicators of hiv awareness , linkage and retention in care need to take into account individuals that are aware of their hiv - positivity but do not disclose their serostatus to the health provider .
this study sought to characterize plwhiv who fail to disclose their serostatus during clinical and community hiv - testing campaigns in a rural district of southern mozambique .
2 methods 2.1 study area and population the study was performed in the manhica district , a semi - rural area in maputo province , southern mozambique .
since 1996 , the manhica health research centre has run a continuous health and demographic surveillance system ( hdss ) for vital events including births and deaths , and migrations 8 which in 2015 , at the time of the study , covered a total population of nearly 174,000 individuals 9 , 10 .
this is a high hiv burden setting , with an estimated community based prevalence of 39.7 % among adults in 2012 10 , 11 .
voluntary counselling and testing ( vct ) and provider initiated counselling and testing ( pict ) were the most widespread hiv - testing modalities in the district , while home - based testing ( hbt ) was not routinely performed as a programmatic hiv - testing strategy .
hiv - testing and care is offered free of charge and criteria to start art treatment followed the who recommendations 12 .
at each health facility , pict and vct are offered and routine patient - level hiv clinical data are recorded in an electronic patient tracking system ( epts ) , which allows monitoring of the hiv population registered in the facility , the quality of care provided as well as the retention , treatment adherence and occurrences of opportunistic infections .
hiv - testing is anonymous in mozambique , and the current epts registers only hiv - positive patients after they have attended their first clinical visit ( further study area details on appendix s1 ) .
2.2 study procedures and definitions the current analysis was nested in a larger prospective observational linkage cohort offering hiv - testing to adults through vct , pict and hbt between may 2014 and june 2015 in the manhica hdss 13 ( appendix s1 ) .
the cohort inclusion criteria were adults over 18 years willing to participate , resident in the manhica district hospital ( mdh ) catchment area , and receiving a first hiv - positive result .
individuals at vct and pict were screened for eligibility after receiving an hiv - positive result whereas hbt , patients were screened prior to testing .
individuals were excluded if they were pregnant women or co - infected with tuberculosis .
hiv rapid testing was performed following who / unaids and national guidelines 14 .
in order to be enrolled in the linkage cohort , all hiv - diagnoses performed via vct , pict and hbt were verified for the absence of a previous hiv clinical chart registered in the epts available for three of district health facilities .
the analysis of disclosure included those patients identified as having an hiv - diagnosis prior to the testing campaigns , either found in the epts or self - reported .
one thousand nine hundred fifty - five subjects testing hiv - positive through vct and pict were invited to participate in order to reach the sample size target for the linkage cohort .
based on the sample size calculations ( appendix s1 ) of the linkage cohort study , hbt was attempted to be offered to 12,500 adults randomly selected from the all hdss adult enumeration , of which 10,897 were visited at home and offered hiv counselling and testing ( hct ) the hbt campaign took place in four field - rounds and individuals were invited to participate in the linkage cohort prior to hct 13 .
during the recruitment process , patients were given the opportunity to disclose their hiv - status prior to counselling and testing when the counsellor asked up to two times about hiv - testing history .
hiv - testing was offered to all individuals who did not disclose an hiv - positive status .
for the purposes of this study , the following definitions were used : newly hiv - diagnosed : individuals testing hiv - positive during the campaign and not previously registered in the epts .
known hiv - positive : self - reported hiv - positive : individuals disclosing previous hiv - positive diagnosis to the counsellor at any time prior to hiv - testing .
only applicable for the hbt population .
non - disclosure of hiv - positive status : individuals accepting hiv counselling and testing without revealing a previous hiv - diagnosis .
non - disclosure participants were identified among vct , pict and hbt strategies .
loss to follow - up ( ltfu ) : was defined as having the last clinical visit performed more than 180 days before the study visit .
2.3 data collection and data management specific questionnaires , including information on awareness of hiv - status , history of previous hiv - testing , time since last hiv - test and socio - demographic information were designed for the study .
data from both clinical venues , vct and pict , were collected in paper format and double - entered using the openclinica platform 15 .
as participants who self - reported a previous hiv - positive diagnosis were not included in the linkage cohort , only age and sex were recorded for those subjects .
data from the hbt venue were directly collected in electronic format in open data kit software 1.4 ( odk ) 16 at the time of the visit and uploaded into a database in redcap ( research electronic data capture ) , 17 .
as a pilot , prior to the first round of hbt ( hbt - r1 ) a standard deterministic and probabilistic record - linkage 18 was conducted in order to match the hdss individuals simple randomized for hbt and the manhica hospital epts records for those already enrolled in care .
in the consecutive three hbt rounds individuals identified by that system were not visited in order to improve the efficiency and yield of hbt strategy .
ascertainment of known hiv - positive individuals was conducted by confirmation of the physical hospital identification card and / or location of individual 's name in one of the three main district epts databases .
2.4 statistical analysis we conducted a descriptive analysis stratified by hiv - testing modality , assessing proportions by pearson and fisher 's exact chi - square tests .
for hbt analysis , data from the first round , where adults had the opportunity to disclose their serostatus to a study counsellor , was used for description and prevalence whereas data from rounds 1 to 4 were used for risk - factor analysis .
to assess potential risk factors associated with non - disclosure to the health personnel , we estimated prevalence - ratios ( pr ) through use of log - binomial regressions 19 , 20 .
both unadjusted and adjusted pr ( apr ) were computed , and the analysis was conducted among the hbt participants and then among those who were enrolled in clinical care at the mdh .
age category ( 18 to 24 , 25 to 34 , 35 to 44 , > 45 ) , sex , being previously enrolled in care and ltfu were included in the model as covariates .
confidence intervals for the binomial proportions were calculated through the clopper - pearson method .
statistical analyses were performed using stata 14.1 21 .
2.5 ethics this study was approved by the mozambican national bioethics committee as well as the institutional review boards at the hospital clinic of barcelona ( spain ) , the manhica health research centre .
it was also reviewed according to centres for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) human research protection procedures and was determined to be research , however cdc was not engaged directly with research participants .
the purpose of the study was explained to participants and written informed consent was obtained .
3 results 3.1 study profile and baseline characteristics during the hospital testing data collection phase , a total of 1955 people tested positive for hiv through vct and pict strategies. of these , 39.7 % ( 776 / 1955 ) did not meet the inclusion criteria for this analysis ( figure 1a ). of the remaining 1179 eligible individuals , 36.1 % ( 426 / 1179 ) were later identified in the epts system as known hiv - positive ( 118 individuals in vct and 308 in pict ) and 63.9 % ( 753 / 1179 ) were considered newly hiv - diagnosed ( figure 1a ) .

hbt - refers only to the first round of hbt ( n = 2500 ). from the individuals randomly selected and visited for hbt - r1 , 69.0 % ( 1725 / 2500 ) were eligible for participation ; 18.7 % ( 322 / 1725 ) self - reported their status , and were thus considered as known hiv - positive individuals and not tested ( figure 1b ). of those 1023 undergoing hct , 10.6 % ( 108 / 1023 ) tested positive for hiv .
after testing positive , 38.9 % ( 42 / 108 ) of the individuals were identified by the epts system as known hiv - positive ( figure 1b ) .
the record - linkage algorithm matched an epts record for 42.2 % ( 182 / 431 ) of those defined as known hiv - positive ( either self - reported or non - disclosure ) in hbt - r1 .
the median age of known hiv - positive individuals from hbt , vct and pict was 37.3 years ( iqr 29.0 to 44.0 ) and significantly higher ( p < 0.001 ) for the hbt group 38.3 years ( iqr 30.0 to 45.0 ) as compared to the pict 32.5 years ( iqr 26.0 to 37.0 ) and vct 32.7 years ( iqr 26.0 to 38.0 ) .
a significantly higher proportion of clients in pict were men as compared to vct and hbt ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) .

john wiley & sons , ltd 3.2 disclosure of hiv status to counsellors from those participants included at hbt - r1 , a total of 431 were defined to be known hiv - positive individuals , among which 74.7 % ( 322 / 431 ) self - reported their hiv - status to the study staff and .
almost 10 % ( 42 / 431 ) underwent hct without disclosing their hiv - positive status to the counsellor .
an additional 15.5 % ( 67 / 431 ) previously identified as hiv - positive by the record - linkage algorithm were not visited ( figure 1b ) .
among those testing hiv - positive in the vct , pict and hbt testing campaign , the proportion of non - disclosures was highest in the hbt - r1 arm , reaching 38.9 % ( 95 % ci 29.7 to 48.7 ) , followed by the pict at 29.4 % ( 95 % ci 26.7 to 32.3 ) , and vct at 13.0 % ( 95 % ci 10.9 to 15.3 ) ( table 2 ) .
vct showed a significantly lower proportion of non - disclosures as compared to the hbt and pict ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
the lower proportion in hbt - all rounds as compared to hbt - r1 is due to not visiting 39.0 % ( 849 / 2177 ) of the individuals randomized to rounds 2 to 4 with a matched record in epts as mentioned in methods .

john wiley & sons , ltd 3.3 factors associated with non - disclosure of hiv serostatus to the health personnel we assessed factors associated with non - disclosure among those who had the opportunity to disclose their serostatus over the four hbt rounds , thus excluding from the analysis those non - disclosures in vct and pict. of a total of 1328 known hiv - positive individuals , 1207 were self - reported and 121 were non - disclosures ( figure s1 ) .
in a log - binomial regression , younger age was significantly associated with non - disclosure of hiv - positive status ( table 3a ) .
individuals aged 18 to 24 years , had a 3.31 fold greater proportion ( 95 % ci 1.91 to 5.74 ) of non - disclosure as compared to the reference category of individuals over 45 years of age ( table 3a ) .
the association was maintained for the 25 to 34 year - old group ( adjusted prevalence ratio apr 1.77 , 95 % ci 1.10 to 2.87 ) .

john wiley & sons , ltd we then assessed the proportion of non - disclosures solely among those 933 ( 70.3 %) patients with a hospital identification epts number and with non - missing data for covariates included in the model ( table 3b ) .
again , in this population , younger age was associated with non - disclosure ( table 3b ) .
individuals aged 18 to 24 years , had a 2.47 fold greater risk of non - disclosure ( 95 % ci 1.38 to 4.44 ) compared to the reference category group .
those individuals with a history of ltfu prior to the time of the study had a 4.24 fold greater risk of non - disclosure ( 95 % ci 2.64 to 6.81 ) than those without prior recorded ltfu .
furthermore , individuals with no prior history of art had a 1.44 fold greater risk of non - disclosure ( 95 % ci 1.01 to 2.06 ) than individuals enrolled in care but on art ( table 3b ) .
sex was not significantly associated with non - disclosure of hiv serostatus .
3.4 impact of non - disclosure on estimates of the first 90 we then assessed non - disclosure in the context of our population of plwhiv in hbt - r1 ( n = 497 ) which included those previously identified by the record - linkage algorithm ( n = 67 ) , self - reported hiv - status ( n = 322 ) , non - disclosures ( n = 42 ) and newly hiv - diagnosed individuals ( n = 66 ) .
in the absence of a mechanism to identify non - disclosures , the apparent proportion of the 497 hiv - positive individuals considered new hiv - diagnoses would have been 21.7 % ( 108 / 497 ) ( 95 % ci 18.2 to 25.6 ) and the proportion who were aware of their status 78.3 % ( 389 / 497 ) ( 95 % ci 74.4 to 81.8 ) .
however , identification of the non - disclosure population among those who tested positive modified these proportions .
figure 2 shows that shifting the 42 / 497 ( 8.5 % , 95 % ci 6.2 to 11.3 ) of non - disclosures from the category of new hiv - diagnoses to the category of known hiv - positive reduces the proportion of new diagnoses to 13.2 % ( 95 % ci 10.4 to 16.5 ) and increases the proportion who are aware of their status to 86.8 % ( 95 % ci 83.4 to 89.6 ) ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 impact of linking hiv testing results to patient registries on proportion of hiv - infected individuals that know their status .
( n = 497 ) 4 discussion our findings show that in a semi - rural area of southern mozambique , the proportion of individuals who did not disclose previous hiv - positive status to a counsellor at the time of hiv - testing varied according to testing venue and age .
among those individuals testing hiv - positive in the vct 13 % underwent testing without disclosing a previous hiv - diagnosis .
this proportion was two - fold higher in pict and three - fold higher in hbt .
in the absence of an efficient and non - anonymous clinical record tracking system for hiv - testers , the apparent proportion of the hiv - positive population who were aware of their serostatus in the community was 78.3 % .
however , after record - linkage of hiv - testers with the epts system , the adjusted proportion of the known hiv - positive population rose to 86.8 % , coming close to the unaids target of 90 % of the hiv - positive population with an hiv - diagnosis .
non - disclosures were more likely to be young , have dropped - out of care and not have a history of art .
in sub - saharan africa , between 20 and 55 % of the plwhiv has been described to be unaware of their hiv - status 4 , 5 , 22 .
nevertheless , our results suggest that this proportion may include individuals who are in fact aware of their hiv - status but prefer not to disclose and to repeat the test .
this may lead to overestimation of the yield of new hiv - diagnoses and overall hiv prevalence .
depending on the methods and back calculations used to estimate the undiagnosed hiv population , repeat hiv - testing might overestimate the true proportion of plwhiv who are still unaware of their hiv - status 23 .
to ensure that 90 % of plwhiv initiate art , treatment delivery must be scaled - up. expansion of art must go beyond treating new hiv cases and patients in follow - up without art criteria , to reach known hiv - positive individuals who have dropped - out of care and are more likely to undergo repeat testing without disclosing known hiv - positivity to the counsellor .
indeed finding and re - engaging hiv - positive patients that have been lost at any step of the care cascade and may not disclose a prior hiv - diagnosis is equally important to ensuring high yields of new hiv - diagnoses .
several studies have shown a strong association between disclosure , social support and adherence 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 .
plwhiv who experienced positive social support were more likely to disclose their hiv - status and link and retain in care , while those who perceived stigma or feared disclosing , presented lower levels of access to care 5 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 30 .
despite this , very few studies have documented the magnitude of non - disclosure to health providers 31 , 32 and to our knowledge , no studies have measured non - disclosure to the lay counsellor at the moment of hiv - testing .
non - disclosures may not be an isolated phenomenon .
in a clinical pict and vct cohort in south africa 33 , 10 % of the participants were identified as non - disclosure after re - testing whereas in a community based trial of self - testing in malawi , 26 % of residents who self - tested were already on art 7 , 34 , 35 the reasons for non - disclosure at time of counselling may include not believing the result , feeling that some time on treatment has cured them or stigma among others .
furthermore studies will shed light on the similarities and differences in non - disclosure to a health provider versus to a partner .
the magnitude of non - disclosures can distort programmatic indicators .
at health facility level , non - disclosures could overestimate basic indicators , such as the number of new hiv - diagnoses and the total number of people living with hiv as well as underestimate the proportion of new hiv - diagnoses linked to care .
in mozambique and other sub - saharan settings , most programmatic estimates of hiv - testing coverage and linkage are based on comparing crude numbers of anonymous hiv - positive tests versus number of people enrolling in care in an unlinked manner 36 , 37 .
here , we document single repeat hiv - testing in hiv - positive individuals who did not disclose their status to the lay counsellor .
however , as long as testing information remains anonymous , individuals may repeat an hiv test several times without disclosing prior diagnoses .
thus , a proportion individuals classified as new diagnoses linked to care will actually be individuals lost over the care cascade who should be re - engaged instead of re - tested .
identifying repeat hiv - testers who are non - disclosers is complicated by the generalized anonymity of the hiv - diagnosis in mozambique 38. with the increasing benefits of art and challenges in linking new hiv - diagnoses to care , who has revised its surveillance testing guidelines to move away from anonymous testing and encourage confidential linked hiv testing 14 .
in our study , under informed consent , hiv - testing was not anonymous and thus allowed tracking these patients .
another important health system related obstacle is the reliance on paper charts when patients enrol in care .
digital entry of the clinical information in the epts is secondary to the clinical visit , where the information is recorded directly on the paper chart .
mckay et al. described the phenomenon of " medical multiplicity " in maputo health facilities where one individual may have multiple charts 39 .
in addition , each health facility has their own clinical epts database , which complicates tracking silent transfers and migrants from one health post to another .
mechanisms such as the confirmation of the identity of individuals testing hiv - positive prior to enrolment or the removal of anonymity of the hiv - diagnosis implemented in our study allowed us to reduce the problem of ' medical multiplicity ' .
in this study , we did not conduct qualitative analyses to understand the reasons for non - disclosure to the counsellor or to ascertain non - disclosure to family members .
however , the need for understanding the main reasons for non - disclosure has increased in recent years as a greater proportion of the population is tested for hiv .
identifying barriers could reduce the magnitude of the problem and potentially improve adherence to art and care due to the close relationship between disclosure and adherence 5 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 30 .
the main reasons for non - disclosure at various levels ( partners , family , friends , healthcare providers or even employers ) are fear of discrimination or rejection 40 , stigma 27 , 30 , 41 , 42 , 43 or previous negative experiences disclosing to a confident 28 .
in mozambique , results from a national stigma survey have shown that more than 50 % of people interviewed had experienced some form of discrimination in the previous year and less than 40 % knew that they had rights as hiv patients 27 , 44 .
only half of the population of the survey had disclosed their status to their sexual partner or family 44 .
interventions that reduce stigma and empower plwhiv will improve individual and social context outcomes .
these interventions should be aimed at increasing sensitization , retention in care and de - stigmatization of hiv at both individual and public health level 27 , 30 .
the main limitation of this study is related to the method of identification of the non - disclosure population based on the epts , which only records individuals with a clinical visit rather than all those diagnosed and is independent by health facility .
thus , we were not able to include individuals who knew their hiv - status but had not reached the point of a clinical visit or individuals that were enrolled in other health facilities .
in addition , for hbt - all rounds , our estimate of non - disclosure is conservative because individuals that were identified as known hiv - positive through the record - linkage algorithm were not provided with the opportunity to disclose their hiv condition .
this is likely to lead to underestimation of the prevalence of non - disclosure. with quality systems that allow the identification of previously diagnosed individuals , we will have the capacity to accurately measure the proportion of people still unaware of their hiv condition , after implementing all the strategies proposed to reach the first 90 goal .
5 conclusions in high hiv burden settings such as southern mozambique , close to 40 % of people who tested positive within different hct strategies had a prior hiv - positive diagnosis .
repeat hiv - testing of previously diagnosed individuals may contribute to medical multiplicity , wasting of scarce resources and distortion of programmatic indicators .
in the absence of an efficient and non - anonymous tracking system for hiv - testers , repeat testing of non - disclosing plwhiv leads to misclassification between linkage and re - engagement in care and can potentially lead to an underestimation of the first unaids 90 objective .
since hiv - status disclosure is believed to affect overall physical and mental health including disease transmission and the quality of relationships , understanding disclosure behaviour can impact many aspects of wellbeing of plwhiv .
these findings point to a need , not only to link new hiv - diagnoses to care but also to address the gap of re - engagement at every step of the cascade in order to avoid extensive repeat hiv - testing .
youths have become a target group for intensification of hiv - testing .
however , attention must be given to strategies of re - engagement in care without repeating hct .
intensifying the importance of disclosure and re - engagement during counselling as well as ensuring appropriate psychosocial support are necessary to encourage plwhiv to disclose their status .

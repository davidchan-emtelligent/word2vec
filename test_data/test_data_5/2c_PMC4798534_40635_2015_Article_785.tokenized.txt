historically patients with hiv requiring itu admission had a poor outcome , with mortality up to 70 % however in recent years itu mortality rates have fallen ([ 1 ]) .
an aging population presenting with both hiv complications and non - hiv related disease combined with improved survival rates has implications for itu management and prognostication .
objectives to undertake a retrospective observational study comparing the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed hiv infection admitted to the intensive care unit at the royal sussex county hospital , brighton between 1996 - 2006 and 2007 - 2014 .
methods patients were identified from the itu electronic records using either the entry of a diagnosis of hiv or a cd4 count .
diagnosis was confirmed using pathology and hiv department patient records .
data including demographics and level of organ support was collected .
comparison was made to data available from 1996 - 2006 .
results between 2007 - 14 , 75 patients were admitted to the itu with a total of 86 patient episodes ; an increase from 48 admissions in the previous period .
the mean itu length of stay was 6.1 days ( range < 1 - 37 days ) .
the patient group was largely male with a significant increase in the mean male age since 2007 ( 50.7 vs. 41.6 , p = 0.0002 ) .
while the diagnosis of hiv was made in 24 % of patients during the hospital admission there was a statistically significant increase in patients presenting to itu established on antiretroviral therapy ( 48 vs. 17 , p = 0.0096 ) and an associated increase in non - hiv related disease leading to admission. between the comparison periods , there was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients receiving respiratory support ( invasive or non - invasive ventilation , 58 vs. 38 , p = 0.20 ) or renal replacement therapy ( 6 vs. 5 , p = 0.20 ) .
there was no correlation between itu mortality and either cd4 count ( p = 0.52 ) or viral load ( p = 0.85 ) .
mortality rates halved between the comparison groups ( 10 % vs. 20 %) with no statistically significant difference between mortality in hiv - infected patients and the general itu population since 2007 ( 10 % vs. 17.7 % , p = 0.39 ) .
conclusions itu admissions in hiv infected patients have increased since 1996 .
testing of patients for hiv remains important as undiagnosed patients continue to present however increasing numbers of patients are admitted on antiretroviral therapy with non - hiv related disease .
the level of respiratory and renal support has remained constant but mortality rates have halved. with increasing survival and no correlation between mortality and cd4 count or viral load , all patients should be considered for admission .

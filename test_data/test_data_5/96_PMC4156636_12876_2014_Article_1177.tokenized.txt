background aim was to explore the association of ercc1 and ts mrna levels with the disease free survival ( dfs ) in chinese colorectal cancer ( crc ) patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5 - fu based adjuvant chemotherapy .
methods total 112 chinese stage ii - iii crc patients were respectively treated by four different chemotherapy regimens after curative operation .
the ts and ercc1 mrna levels in primary tumor were measured by real - time rt - pcr .
kaplan - meier curves and log - rank tests were used for dfs analysis .
the cox proportional hazards model was used for prognostic analysis .
results in univariate analysis , the hazard ratio ( hr ) for the mrna expression levels of ts and ercc1 ( logts : hr = 0.820 , 95 % ci = 0.600 - 1.117 , p = 0.210 ; logercc1 : hr = 1.054 , 95 % ci = 0.852 - 1.304 , p = 0.638 ) indicated no significant association of dfs with the ts and ercc1 mrna levels .
in multivariate analyses , tumor stage ( iiic : reference , p = 0.083 ; iib : hr = 0.240 , 95 % ci = 0.080 - 0.724 , p = 0.011 ; iic : hr < 0.0001 , p = 0.977 ; iiia : hr = 0.179 , 95 % ci = 0.012 - 2.593 , p = 0.207 ) was confirmed to be the independent prognostic factor for dfs .
moreover , the kaplan - meier dfs curves showed that ts and ercc1 mrna levels were not significantly associated with the dfs ( ts : p = 0.264 ; ercc1 : p = 0.484 ) .
conclusion the mrna expression of ercc1 and ts were not applicable to predict the dfs of chinese stage ii - iii crc patients receiving 5 - fu and oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy .
keywords colorectal cancer ercc1 ts real - time pcr adjuvant chemotherapy issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 background colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the third most common cancer worldwide and has a high mortality rate [ 1 ] .
about 608,000 deaths from crc are estimated worldwide , accounting for 8 % of all cancer deaths [ 2 , 3 ] .
surgery is the most common treatment for crc , yet prognosis remains poor [ 4 ] .
as a result , considerable interest has concentrated on chemotherapy after surgery , such as oxaliplatin or 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) - based adjuvant chemotherapy [ 5 , 6 ] .
the 5 - fu is an analogue of uracil with a fluorine atom at the c - 5 position in place of hydrogen , which disrupts rna synthesis and the action of thymidylate synthase by converting to several active metabolites : fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate ( fdump ) , fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate ( fdutp ) and fluorouridine triphosphate ( futp ) [ 7 ] .
it was reported that 5 - fu - based chemotherapy was a safe and effective treatment for elderly patients with advanced crc [ 8 ] .
oxaliplatin is a platinum - based drug that has demonstrated antitumor activities in crc both in vitro and in vivo [ 9 ] .
it was reported that oxaliplatin based chemotherapy could significantly increase the progression - free survival in patients with metastatic crc [ 10 ] .
moreover , the better efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin combined with 5 - fu as first - line chemotherapy for elderly patients with metastatic crc has been proved [ 11 ] .
however , there is no predictive factor for efficacy of these treatments .
the ercc1 ( encodes excision cross - complementing 1 ) gene codes for a nucleotide excision repair protein involved in the repair of radiation and chemotherapy - induced dna damage [ 12 ] .
it has been reported that the gene polymorphism of ercc1 at codon 118 was a predictive factor for the tumor response to oxaliplatin / 5 - fu combination chemotherapy in patients with advanced crc [ 13 ] .
furthermore , thymidylate synthase ( ts ) , as a target enzyme of 5 - fu , is associated with response to 5 - fu in human colorectal and gastric tumors [ 14 , 15 ] .
it was reported that ts genotyping could be of help in predicting toxicity to 5 - fu - based chemotherapy in crc patients [ 16 ] .
however , little is known about the association between mrna expression levels of ercc1 and ts and clinical outcomes of oxaliplatin and 5 - fu based adjuvant chemotherapy in chinese people with crc .
in this study , we investigated the association of ercc1 and ts mrna levels with the disease free survival ( dfs ) in chinese crc patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5 - fu based adjuvant chemotherapy .
methods patients this study was carried out with the institutional ethics committees approval and following the chinese medical research council guidelines .
all participants gave their written informed consent prior to entering the study .
this is a prospective study .
a total of 112 chinese crc patients who were treated at jiangsu tumor hospital , china , from may 2005 to january 2010 were investigated in this study .
eligibility criterion was histological confirmation of stage ii - iii crc after surgery according to the ajcc tnm classification [ 17 ] .
chemotherapy treatment all the patients were treated with chemotherapy after curative operation .
four types of chemotherapy regimens were used for the treatment of crc patients : i ) the first one was the standard folfox - 4 consisting of 2 - hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin ( 85 mg / m2 ) on day 1 , and 2 - hour intravenous drip infusion of calcium folinate ( 200 mg / m2 ) on days 1 - 2 , followed by intravenous injection of 5 - fu ( 400 mg / m2 ) and continuous infusion of 5 - fu ( 600 mg / m2 ) lasting 22 h on days 1 - 2 , every 2 weeks ; ii ) the second one was the modified folfox consisting of intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin ( 130 mg / m2 ) and 2 - hour intravenous drip infusion of folinate calcium ( 200 mg / m2 ) on day 1 , followed by intravenous injection of 5 - fu ( 400 mg / m2 ) and continuous infusion of 5 - fu ( 1000 mg / m2 ) over 24 h on days 1 to 3 , every 3 weeks ; iii ) the third one was oral xelox consisting of 2 - hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin 130 mg / m2 on day 1 plus oral capecitabine 850 mg / m2 twice daily for 2 weeks in a 3 - week cycle ; iv ) the fourth one was a conventional intravenous drip infusion including 2 - hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin 130 mg / m2 on day 1 and continuous infusion of 5 - fu ( 750 mg / m2 ) lasting 4 h on days 1 to 5 , every 3 weeks .
all the chemotherapy regimens were performed by a trained nurse .
the selection of chemotherapy regimens for each patient was according to the recommendation of an experienced expert .
after treatment , the clinical outcomes were obtained by telephone follow - up or a return visit with the deadline of january 2014 .
dfs , which defined as the time from the end of chemotherapy to the first event of either recurrent disease or death , was calculated according to follow - up data .
rna extraction and real - time rt - pcr rna was extracted and purified from formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) tissue samples of surgically resected primary crc using an rneasy mini kit ( qiagen , inc. ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions [ 18 ] .
the cdna of ercc1 and ts was prepared by reverse transcription from rna [ 19 ] .
the abi prism 7700 sequence detection system ( perkin - elmer applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) was used to perform taqman probe - based real - time pcr reactions as previously described [ 20 - 22 ] .
relative levels of mrna transcripts were calculated according to the comparative ct method using beta - actin as an endogenous control [ 23 ] .
statistical analysis the cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors .
the variables included six continuous variables ( age , duration of chemotherapy courses , interval between surgery and chemotherapy , cumulated dosage of oxaliplatin and mrna expression levels of ercc1 and ts ) and eight categorical variables ( sex , primary tumor location , tumor stage , tumor differentiation , lymph node staging , nerve invasion , vascular invasion and chemotherapy regimens ) .
the logarithms of the ts and ercc1 mrna levels ( logts , logercc1 ) were calculated for fitting normal distribution as the requirement of analysis .
dummy variables were considered for all the categorical variables .
the chemotherapy regimens were used as a stratification variable in all the analyses .
the backward stepwise method was used in the multivariate analysis base on the likelihood ratio statistics .
kaplan - meier curves and log - rank tests were used for dfs analysis .
hazards ratios were used to calculate the relative risks of recurrence or death .
all tests were two - sided , and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
analyses were performed using sas version 9.1 ( institute , cary , nc ) and spss 19.0 ( ibm , armonk , new york ) .
power was calculated using the ps power and sample size calculation , version 3.0.43 ( vanderbilt university , nashville , tn , usa ) .
results characteristics of patients and follow - up results demographic details on the patients investigated in this study are shown in table 1 .
a total of 112 chinese patients ( 40 females and 72 males ) aged from 32 to 75 years old ( average , 52.75 ) were analyzed in this study .
there were 61 rectum cancer patients and 38 colon cancer patients .
all patients ( stage iia , 24 ; stage iib , 1 ; stage iiia , 3 ; stage iiib , 53 ; stage iiic , 31 ) underwent curative operation and then received 4 different chemotherapy regimens , respectively , including the standard folfox - 4 ( 20 cases ) , modified folfox ( 15 cases ) , oral xelox ( 19 cases ) and conventional intravenous drip infusion ( 58 cases ) .
the median follow - up duration was 36 months ( ranged from 1.2 to 78 months ) .
relapse occurred in forty - four patients ( 39.3 %) and eleven patients ( 9.8 %) died of disease .
the median dfs was 36 months ( minimum : 3 months ; maximum : more than 77 months ) ( table 1 ) .

the median mrna expression level of ercc1 , relative to the housekeeping gene beta - actin , was 1.7 x 10 - 3 ( minimum , 8.57 x 10 - 5 ; maximum , 6.7 x 10 - 2 ) .
in addition , when analyzed by sex and age , no significant association between the ts or ercc1 mrna levels and these parameters was found ( p > 0.05 ) .
association of dfs with ts and ercc1 mrna levels for the univariate analysis , the hazard ratio ( hr ) for the mrna expression levels of ts and ercc1 ( logts : hr = 0.820 , 95 % ci = 0.600 - 1.117 , p = 0.210 ; logercc1 : hr = 1.054 , 95 % ci = 0.852 - 1.304 , p = 0.638 ) indicated that there was no significant association of dfs with the mrna expression levels of ts and ercc1 in chinese crc patients treated with oxaliplatin and 5 - fu based adjuvant chemotherapy ( table 2 ) .

factors considered in the multivariate analyses included age , sex ( male , female ; reference category : female ) , tumor stage ( stage iia , stage iib , stage iiia , stage iiib , stage iiic ; reference category : stage iiic ) , tumor differentiation ( high , high or medium , medium , medium or low , low ; reference category : low ) , primary tumor location ( rectum , colon ; reference category : rectum ) , lymph node staging ( n0 , n1 , n2 ; reference category : n2 ) , vascular invasion ( positive , negative ; reference category : positive ) , nerve invasion ( positive , negative ; reference category : positive ) , interval between surgery and chemotherapy , duration of chemotherapy course , cumulated dosage of oxaliplatin as well as the mrna expression levels of ts and ercc1 .
it is clearly showed that only the tumor stage ( tumor stage iiic , reference , p = 0.083 ; tumor stage iib , hr = 0.240 , 95 % ci = 0.080 - 0.724 , p = 0.011 ; tumor stage iic , hr < 0.0001 , p = 0.977 ; tumor stage iiia , hr = 0.179 , 95 % ci = 0.012 - 2.593 , p = 0.207 ) entered the model in the final step and was confirmed to be the independent prognostic factor for dfs .
the results indicated that the dfs in the patients with tumor stage iib was significantly longer than that in the patients with tumor stage iiic .
in addition , there was no evidence to prove the association between the dfs and the ts and ercc1 mrna levels ( table 3 ) .
table 3 cox regression analysis for multivariate analysis variable disease free survival hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval p tumor stage ( reference category : tumor stage iiic ) 0.083 tumor stage iib 0.240 0.080 - 0.724 0.011 tumor stage iic < 0.0001 - - 0.977 tumor stage iiia 0.179 0.012 - 2.593 0.207 for the tumor stage iic , the hazard ratio was so small that the 95 % confidence interval could not be displayed by the software .
the patients were divided into two groups based on the median mrna expression levels of ts ( high expression group : > 2.86 x 10 - 1 ; low expression group : <= 2.86 x 10 - 1 ) and ercc1 ( high expression group : > 1.7 x 10 - 3 ; low expression group : <= 1.7 x 10 - 3 ) .
the kaplan - meier dfs curves according to the mrna expression levels of ts and ercc1 all showed no significant difference between high and low expression group ( ts : p = 0.264 ; ercc1 : p = 0.484 ) , suggesting that the mrna expression levels of ts and ercc1 was not significantly associated with the dfs ( figure 1 ) .

discussion the expression of ercc1 and ts has been reported to be related with the clinical outcomes of patients treated with the oxaliplatin or 5 - fu - based adjuvant chemotherapy [ 24 , 25 ] .
nevertheless , there was no enough evidence to prove the prognostic role of ercc1 and ts expression in crc patients treated with oxaliplatin and 5 - fu - based adjuvant chemotherapy .
therefore , we analyzed the association of mrna expression levels of ercc1 and ts with dfs in chinese patients with stage ii - iii crc in this study .
the results indicated no significant association between dfs and the mrna expression levels of ercc1 and ts , suggesting that the expression of ercc1 and ts were not applicable as the predictive factors for dfs in chinese stage ii - iii crc patients receiving 5 - fu and oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy .
however , the mrna levels of ercc1 and ts has been reported by shirota y et al. to be associated with survival of 5 - fu and oxaliplatin adjuvant chemotherapy in crc patients [ 20 ] .
it may be due to the difference in cancer stage and ethnicity of patients .
in this study , the patients were at the stage ii - iii of crc .
however , the patients in the study of shirota y et al .
[ 20 ] were at stage iv. the mrna expression levels of ercc1 and ts may vary with different stage of cancer .
in addition , the patients were all chinese in this study but american in the study of shirota y et al. the gene expression profiles were different among ethnic groups [ 26 ] .
therefore , we inferred that the response of gene ercc1 and ts to oxaliplatin and 5 - fu based adjuvant chemotherapy might be different between chinese and american patients .
some previous studies have reported that ercc1 expression is a predictive factor for survival after chemotherapy in advanced non - small cell lung cancer [ 27 ] , bladder cancer [ 28 ] , gastric cancer [ 24 ] .
however , there was no evidence to prove the association between the mrna expression of ercc1 and dfs of stage ii - iii crc patients receiving oxaliplatin and 5 - fu based adjuvant chemotherapy in this study .
it indicated that ercc1 expression could predict clinical outcomes of chemotherapy in cancers such as non - small cell lung cancer , bladder cancer , and gastric cancer but not in stage ii - iii crc .
moreover , in this study , we found that tumor stage was a significant prognostic factor of dfs in crc patients receiving 5 - fu and oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy .
it has been reported that the survival of advanced / recurrent rectal cancers treated with 5 - fu based chemotherapy was significantly associated with the tumor stage [ 29 ] .
meanwhile , another studies reported that pathologic stage significantly influenced the dfs of locally advanced rectal cancer patients after preoperative chemoradiation ( 5 - fu or oxaliplatin ) [ 30 ] .
therefore , tumor stage must be considered in the further studies for the prognostic analysis of 5 - fu and oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy for crc patients .
there were some notable limitations of this study .
first , power calculation ( alpha = 0.05 ; ts : power 1 - beta = 0.511 ; ercc1 : power 1 - beta = 0.656 ) showed that the sample size was small for reliably accessing the association between ts or ercc1 expression and dfs .
thus , more studies with larger sample size were required .
second , the follow - up duration was short , so that further studies must be done to verify the results of this study .
third , there were four chemotherapy regimens in this study , which may be a limitation for identifying association between ts or ercc1 expression and dfs in this study .
in addition , the dose of 5 - fu may also affect the clinical outcomes of chemotherapy , and we must investigate this potentially prognostic factor in the further studies .
conclusions in conclusion , our data demonstrated that mrna expression levels of ercc1 and ts were not significantly correlated with the dfs of chinese stage ii - iii crc patients receiving 5 - fu and oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy .
it suggested that the mrna expression levels of ercc1 and ts were not applicable as the predictive factors for dfs in chinese stage ii - iii crc patients receiving 5 - fu and oxaliplatin based adjuvant chemotherapy .
further investigations to clearly define the role of ercc1 and ts gene expression in this setting are needed .

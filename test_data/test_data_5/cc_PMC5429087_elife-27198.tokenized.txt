2017. synthekines are surrogate cytokine and growth factor agonists that compel signaling through non - natural receptor dimers .
elife 6 : e22882 .
doi : 10.7554 / elife.22882 as with john lennon and paul mccartney , pairings can sometimes exceed the sum of their parts .
many biological processes also rely on proteins forming pairs : for example , a wide variety of cells ( particularly those involved in the immune system ) release small proteins called cytokines to communicate with other cells , and typically it takes two cytokine receptors to detect one of these proteins .
now , in elife , christopher garcia and colleagues at stanford university school of medicine - including ignacio moraga as first author - report that they have developed a new class of molecule called synthekines that bind to different pairs of cytokine receptors than the cytokines they are based on ( moraga et al. , 2017 ) .
each cytokine interacts with a unique cytokine receptor pair and activates signaling pathways that lead to changes in gene expression ( figure 1 ) .
in mammals , there are ~ 40 cytokine receptors that employ the jak - stat signaling pathway : this is an evolutionarily conserved pathway composed of four jak proteins and seven stat proteins that cooperate to sense when specific cytokine receptors form pairs ( villarino et al. , 2017 ) .
simple math tells us that , if all such receptors could freely associate with each other , there would be 40x40 = 1,600 combinations of pairs .
however , this is not the case ; the cytokines present in an organism determine which receptor pairings occur , limiting the actual number of pairings to less than 50 .
figure 1 .
cytokines and synthekines .
the cytokines present in an organism dictate which cytokine receptors can form pairs : in this schematic example , cytokine 1 causes receptors r1 and r2 to form a pair ( left ) , while cytokine 2 causes receptors r3 and r4 to form a pair ( right ) .
moraga et al. made new molecules called synthekines , with each synthekine being a composite of two mutant cytokines that each bind only one of their related receptors .
these synthekines trigger the formation of ' unnatural ' pairs of receptors ( r2 and r3 in this case ) .
the jak - stat signaling cascade downstream of the synthekine is weaker than the cascades triggered by the parent cytokines : there are also other differences in the signaling cascades ( see main text ) .
cytokines bind to a region of cytokine receptors known as the ligand - binding domain , which sticks out from the cell surface .
this causes the signaling domains of two receptors , which are inside the cell , to interact with one another and activate jak - stat signaling .
moraga et al. first tested whether ' unnatural ' cytokine receptor pairings can trigger jak - stat signaling .
to that end , they devised an experimental system in which the signaling domains of 10 different cytokine receptors were each fused to one of two ligand - binding domains .
these ligand - binding domains were compatible with a single cytokine that , in turn , could induce any one of the 10x10 = 100 possible pairings of signaling domains , depending on which two were fused to the ligand - binding domains .
moraga et al. discovered that most combinations of ligand - binding and signaling domains were able to activate jak - stat signaling .
this confirms that the pairing of cytokine receptors is sufficient to trigger signaling inside cells and that the specificity of the interaction between cytokines and ligand - binding domains is what determines which receptors can form pairs .
the researchers also showed that a cytokine receptor can even trigger signaling when forced to form a pair with a completely different class of receptor molecule , such as a receptor tyrosine kinase .
moving beyond proof - of - principle , moraga et al. developed a way to produce ' unnatural ' receptor pairings in native human cells .
based on the biophysics of the interactions between cytokines and their receptors , they designed mutant versions of three cytokines that were capable of binding to only one component of their ' natural ' receptor pairs .
two of these mutant cytokines were then linked together to create synthetic cytokines ( named synthekines ) that can cause one receptor for each mutant cytokine to form a pair that would not naturally occur ( figure 1 ) .
the experiments show that jak - stat signaling activity downstream of two synthekines called sy1 and sy2 were distinct from those of their parent cytokines .
the responses driven by synthekines generally had lower overall levels of jak - stat activity compared to the responses triggered by their parent cytokines .
furthermore , the patterns of stat protein activity differed .
for example , stat1 is the most active stat protein in the response to sy2 , but least active in the response to its parent cytokines .
furthermore , a technique called high - dimensional mass cytometry revealed that other signaling pathways , particularly downstream of a protein called phosphoinositide 3 - kinase , were altered .
thus , synthekines are not just a watered down combination of their parent cytokines but , instead , are new biological entities with unique signaling properties .
this makes them useful research tools and promising drug candidates .
there are clear precedents for the current work ( see , for example , cunningham and wells , 1991 ; shanafelt et al. , 2000 ; levin et al. , 2012 ; junttila et al. , 2012 ; levin et al. , 2014 ; moraga et al. , 2015 ; ng and galipeau , 2015 ) .
however , by presenting an expansive , multi - pronged methodology for devising and testing chimeric cytokines , moraga et al. move the field on significantly .
furthermore , they introduce new design principles to circumvent some of the problems encountered by previous efforts ; for instance , they report how to prevent the individual components of the synthekines from interacting with their ' natural ' receptor pairs. of course , like all pioneering endeavors , the studies of moraga et al. raise questions and compel further investigations .
the cellular and molecular consequences of synthekines ( versus their parent cytokines ) have only begun to be explained , and their bioactivity in animals , particularly regarding therapeutic uses , has yet to be addressed .
the latter will require the generation of synthekines that are compatible with rodents and other animal models because the current versions are made from human constituents .
however , there appear to be no major obstacles to doing this .
all told , this work stands as a triumph of scientific imagination , a lucid illustration that we need not be constrained by the rules of engagement prescribed within the genome .
after all , given the ever - growing practicality of synthetic biology , we are living in a time where , in the words of lennon and mccartney , there 's " nothing you can make that ca n't be made " ( lennon and mccartney , 1967 ) .

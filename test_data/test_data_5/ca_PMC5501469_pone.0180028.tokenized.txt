objectives ischemia - reperfusion injury ( iri ) is a major cause of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease .
two promising preconditioning methods for the kidney , intermittent arterial clamping ( ic ) and treatment with the hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride , have never been directly compared .
furthermore , the protective efficacy of the chemically related transition metal zn2 + against renal iri is unclear .
although co2 + ions have been shown to protect the kidney via hypoxia inducible factor ( hif ) , the effect of zn2 + ions on the induction of hif1alpha , hif2alpha and hif3alpha has not been investigated previously .
materials and methods the efficacy of different preconditioning techniques was assessed using a sprague - dawley rat model of renal iri .
induction of hif proteins following zn2 + treatment of the human kidney cell lines hk - 2 ( immortalized normal tubular cells ) and achn ( renal cancer ) was measured using western blot .
results following 40 minutes of renal ischemia in rats , cobalt preconditioning offered greater protection against renal iri than ic as evidenced by lower peak serum creatinine and urea concentrations .
zncl2 ( 10 mg / kg ) significantly lowered the creatinine and urea concentrations compared to saline - treated control rats following a clinically relevant 60 minutes of ischemia .
zn2 + induced expression of hif1alpha and hif2alpha but not hif3alpha in hk - 2 and achn cells .
conclusion zncl2 preconditioning protects against renal iri in a dose - dependent manner .
further studies are warranted to determine the possible mechanisms involved , and to assess the benefit of zncl2 preconditioning for clinical applications .

introduction partial nephrectomy ( pn ) using minimally invasive ( laparoscopic or robotic - assisted ) surgery is now the gold standard treatment for small kidney cancers .
pn has been shown to provide equivalent cancer control and decreased risk of chronic kidney disease [ 1 ] .
however , clamping the renal artery during pn leads to renal ischemia reperfusion injury ( iri ) and renal dysfunction .
iri describes a complex array of tissue - destructive processes that is one of the key causes of acute kidney injury ( aki ) following pn. iri is also a serious complication of human organ transplantation .
the consequences of aki in surgical patients are potentially disastrous with a short term 5 - 8 fold increase in post - operative 30 day mortality and a long term risk of ckd in 5 - 17 % of patients [ 2 ] .
therefore , the ischemia time must be kept as short as possible .
current clinical data support a " safe " warm ischemia time of 25 minutes and a cold ischemia time ( when the kidney is placed on ice slush ) of 35 minutes ( and up to 2 hours can be tolerated ) [ 2 ] .
however , cold ischemia is impractical in laparoscopic surgery .
the overwhelming concern amongst urologists about the deleterious effect of iri means that less than 25 % of resections are done by pn and over 75 % by radical nephrectomy [ 3 ] .
an intervention which could extend the critical ischemia time and minimize the possibility of aki would dramatically increase the proportion of cancers that could be treated with nephron - sparing pn rather than radical nephrectomy [ 1 ] .
ischemic preconditioning in general involves exposing an organ to sub - lethal ischemia to protect it against subsequent ischemic injury [ 4 ] .
intermittent clamping ( ic ) is one method of ischemic preconditioning in which the organ to be protected is subjected to multiple short cycles of ischemia and then reperfusion , whereby it is postulated that the tissue will upregulate protective mechanisms before the main ischemic insult .
although ic has shown promise in preclinical models of liver and cardiac ischemia , it has not been studied in the human kidney .
newer chemical preconditioning methods , such as treatment with cobalt chloride ( cocl2 ,) have been shown to protect the kidney against iri via hypoxia inducible factor ( hif ) [ 5 ] .
although subcutaneous injection of cobalt has been shown to ameliorate renal iri in a rat model , cobalt is unsuitable for human use because of its toxic effects [ 6 ] .
salts of zinc , a chemically related transition metal , are commonly ingested by humans and have also been shown to either exacerbate or protect against myocardial or neuronal ischemic injury ( reviewed in [ 7 , 8 ]) .
a direct comparison of the efficacy of ic and cobalt preconditioning , either separately or in combination , has not been reported previously .
therefore the aim of this study was to compare the protective ability of ic with cocl2 preconditioning in a rat model of iri .
having established the proof - of - principle benefit of the hypoxia - mimetic cocl2 , the protective ability of zinc chloride ( zncl2 ) was compared to cocl2 using the same rat model of iri .
co2 + ions inhibit iron - dependent prolyl hydroxylases ( phd ) by displacing fe2 + and thus cause accumulation of the active hif protein .
we hypothesized that zn2 + will displace fe2 + in a manner similar to co2 + , thereby inhibiting phd activity [ 9 ] and inducing hifs .
therefore in this study the ability of zn2 + ions to induce hifs was examined using the immortalized human proximal renal tubule cell line hk - 2 and the renal cancer cell line achn .
materials and methods induction of renal ischemic reperfusion injury eight to twelve - week - old adult male sprague - dawley rats weighing 250 - 350g were housed 2 per cage in the bioresources research facility at austin health , melbourne , australia , and provided standard rat pellets and sterile water ad libitum .
all procedures were approved by the animal ethics committee of austin health ( project number 2009 / 03382 and a2012 / 04638 ) .
the committee is guided by the national health and medical research council ( nhmrc ) australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes 8th edition ( 2013 ) .
rats were anaesthetised with 5 % isoflurane in a sealed chamber at an oxygen flow rate of 0.5 l / min .
continuous anaesthesia was maintained on a 37degreesc heat mat via a specially fitted nose cone at a maintenance concentration of between 0.75 - 1.5 % .
prior to surgery , a baseline 400 mul blood sample was drawn from the tail vein .
to establish a single kidney model for preconditioning and ischemia , all rats initially underwent a right nephrectomy via a midline incision .
seven days post right nephrectomy , a second blood sample was collected to ensure a return to baseline levels .
seven days after initial right nephrectomy and after the standard preparation above , the midline laparotomy wound was re - opened and the left renal pedicle was clamped for either 40 or 60 min using a releasable 3 / 0 silk tie and bulldog vascular clamps .
ischemia of the kidney was confirmed by a rapid colour change to dark purple .
after 40 or 60 min the artery was unclamped and the kidney observed to ensure reperfusion .
cobalt chloride and zinc chloride preconditioning the rats in the intervention groups were preconditioned with subcutaneous injections of cocl2 or zncl2 at the indicated dose and time in a maximum volume of 0.5 ml saline prior to renal pedicle occlusion .
control groups received placebo preconditioning with subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml normal saline .
ic of the renal artery after standard surgical exposure , the left renal artery was clamped for 5 minutes of ischemia , followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion , over 4 continuous cycles ( total time 60 minutes ) .
after completion of this regime , the renal artery was clamped for a further 40 minutes of critical ischemia ( fig 1a ) .

cobalt chloride plus ic of the renal artery six rats were injected with cocl2 on the underside flank preoperatively .
the left renal artery was then clamped for 5 minutes of ischemia , followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion , over 4 continuous cycles ( total time 60 minutes ) .
serum sampling and analysis blood samples ( 400 mul ) were collected from the tail vein of the conscious rats into lithium heparin tubes on days 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 .
left kidney was removed for histological analysis , and rats were euthanized by exsanguination on day 7 .
blood samples were centrifuged and aliquots stored at - 20degreesc till analysis for creatinine and urea by the clinical trials department , austin pathology , heidelberg , australia .
creatinine ( jaffe method ) and urea ( nadh method ) in the serum samples were measured on a fully automated roche cobas 8000 c702 analyser .
sickness score animals were monitored daily post - surgery .
scores of 0 ( normal ) , 1 ( minor change ) or 2 ( gross change ) were assigned to each of the indicators of pain , distress or suffering and general well - being , which included rough coat , laboured breathing , change in posture , movement , aggression , restlessness or overactivity , or change in body weight as a % of starting weight , and the individual scores were summed for each animal .
health scoring of animals was carried out every 12 hours .
histology of kidney sections harvested kidneys were fixed overnight in 10 % formaldehyde and underwent standard haematoxylin and eosin fixation .
each kidney was analysed semi - quantitatively by a blinded anatomical pathology registrar using two previously published methods of scoring histological damage : ( 1 ) the jablonski acute score [ 10 ] ( 2 ) the sum of the areas of tubular damage and coagulative necrosis [ 11 ] .
the morphological changes associated with the jablonski acute score were graded as follows : score 0 = normal , score 1 = mitoses and necrosis of individual cells ; score 2 = necrosis of all cells in adjacent proximal convoluted tubules , with survival of surrounding tubules ; score 3 = necrosis confined to the distal third of the proximal convoluted tubule with a band of necrosis extending across the inner cortex ; score 4 = necrosis affecting all three segments of the proximal convoluted tubule .
where there were varying jablonski acute grades across the sections , the case was scored according to the worst grade .
features associated with acute tubular damage in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules included focal tubular dilation with simplification , flattening and attenuation of the epithelium , loss of the luminal brush border , apoptotic tubular cells and luminal necrotic debris .
areas of coagulative necrosis included areas of loss of renal parenchyma with ghost outlines of cells and structures with sharp demarcation from the adjacent viable tissue .
the tubular damage and the coagulative necrosis were assessed individually as a percentage of the area of the whole section and then added according to the acute tubular necrosis ( atn ) scoring system [ 11 ] .
mammalian cell lines the human renal cancer cell line achn was cultured in mem medium plus non - essential amino acids , pyruvate and 7.5 % fbs , and the immortalized human proximal renal tubular cell line hk - 2 was cultured in dmem / f12 medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and 7.5 % fbs , in a humidified incubator at 37degreesc with 95 % air and 5 % co2 .
western blot treated cells were lysed with 0.1 - 0.2 ml pre - boiled sodium dodecyl sulphate ( sds ) lysis buffer .
proteins were separated by sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane .
following the transfer membranes were probed with antibodies against hif1alpha ( monoclonal anti - human , r & d systems ) or hif2alpha ( rabbit anti - human , cell signaling ) or hif3alpha ( rabbit anti - human , abcam ) as previously described [ 12 ] .
densitometric analysis of the protein bands was performed with multigauge software ( fujifilm ) .
statistical analysis results are expressed as means +/ - sem unless otherwise stated .
statistics were analysed with sigmastat version 3 ( spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) , using t - tests for equally distributed data .
where the data were not normally distributed , were compared with the mann - whitney rank sum test .
repeated - measures anova was undertaken to evaluate differences between the two study groups .
results cobalt provides superior protection compared to ic post 40 minute ischemia rats pre - treated with 30 mg / kg cocl2 according to the protocol shown in fig 1a showed a significant reduction in sickness score ( fig 1b ) , in serum creatinine ( fig 1c ) , and in serum urea ( fig 1d ) , compared to 40 - minute control ischemic rats ( p < 0.05 ) .
the rats had no adverse side effects as a result of injection with cocl2 .
although the rats pre - treated with ic showed a significant reduction in sickness score ( fig 1b ) , the serum creatinine ( fig 1c ) values only differed statistically at day 3 and 5 , and the serum urea values ( fig 1d ) were not statistically different compared to control ischemic animals .
the general anaesthetic time was prolonged to 100 minutes in this control group to account for the 60 minutes of anaesthesia delivered during ic , prior to 40 minutes of critical ischemia .
there was no statistical difference in serum urea or creatinine between the 40 minute and 100 minute anaesthesia control groups ( data not shown ) .
in the six rats that underwent cocl2 preconditioning and intermittent clamping , improvement in the sickness scores was delayed and the serum creatinine and urea were not statistically different from control ischemic animals ( fig 1c and 1d ) .
mortality post 60 minutes of ischemia previously , a 20 % mortality rate following 60 minutes of critical ischemia in rats has been reported [ 13 ] .
our data is in agreement with that study as there were 5 mortalities out of the total 25 rats used in our study according to the protocol shown in fig 2a .
as the mortalities were not confined to one particular group but rather extended across all groups ( 1 in control , 2 in cocl2 , 1 in 10 mg / kg zncl2 and 1 in 30 mg / kg zncl2 group ) , 60 minutes of ischemia apparently causes irreversible damage to the kidney in some rats , and ischemia times exceeding 60 minutes would result in an unacceptably high mortality .
therefore , 60 minutes is the ideal ischemic time to test the efficacy of reno - protective agents .

rats treated with 10 mg / kg zncl2 had a significantly lower rise in serum creatinine and urea after 60 mins ischemia compared to control ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig 2b and 2c ) .
on repeated measures anova , including days one to seven , there was a statistically significant difference between 10 mg / kg zncl2 compared to saline control ( p = 0.038 ) .
while the serum creatinine and urea were lower in the 30 mg / kg cocl2 and 30 mg / kg zncl2 groups , the differences did not reach statistical significance .
the serum creatinine and urea values in the 5 mg / kg zncl2 group were indistinguishable from the control group .
zinc preconditioning improves the health of animals maintenance of body weight is a commonly used marker of animal health during an experimental protocol .
weight loss was observed in all groups post left renal pedicle occlusion ( fig 2d ) .
following 60 minutes of renal ischemia , the mean percentage weights on day 5 , expressed as a percentage of the weight on day 0 , were 95 +/ - 1 % and 95 +/ - 1 % in the groups treated with zncl2 at 10 mg / kg or 30 mg / kg , respectively , compared to 91 +/ - 2 % , 92 +/ - 0.4 % and 90 +/ - 2 % in the control group , and the groups treated with cocl2 at 30 mg / kg or zncl2 at 5 mg / kg , respectively .
furthermore , a reversal from the peak percentage weight loss occurred on day 4 in the groups treated with zncl2 at 10mg / kg and 30mg / kg ( fig 1d ) .
although there was no significant difference between the animal health scores across the groups , zinc preconditioning apparently provides an additional improvement in health outcomes compared to cobalt - or saline - treated rats .
zinc administration reduced the tubular damage and necrosis induced by ischemia a grading scale of 0 to 4 , as outlined by jablonski et al .
[ 10 ] , was used to assess the degree of renal tubular necrosis post renal ir injury .
histology of the kidneys in the animals treated with 10mg / kg zncl2 had the lowest average jablonski score of all groups representing the most normal looking renal architecture with the least amount of damage ( table 1 ) .
most kidneys showed small areas of coagulative necrosis apart from tubular damage and some showed extensive areas of necrosis , however these necrotic areas may be secondary to global warm ischemia or thrombosis of a segmental artery .
a further advantage of the acute tubular injury and necrosis score [ 11 ] is that it gives a semi - quantitative numerical score as opposed to just a grade .
the acute tubular damage ranged from 2 % to 80 % and the coagulative necrosis ranged from 0 % to 65 % across the groups .
as shown in fig 2b , the control group with 77.5 +/ - 3 % had the most acute tubular damage and coagulative necrosis as compared to the other groups .
preconditioning with 10mg / kg zncl2 significantly ( p < 0.05 ) reduced the tubular damage and coagulative necrosis to 18 +/ - 9 % .
although there was a trend for a reduction in tubular damage and coagulative necrosis in the 5mg / kg zncl2 , 30mg / kg zncl2 and 30mg / kg cocl2 groups compared to control , the differences did not reach statistical significance .
overall the kidneys from the group treated with 10 mg / kg zncl2 were the only group that had significantly preserved renal architecture and reduced proximal renal tubular damage ( table 1 and fig 3a ) .
this preservation of renal architecture may contribute to improved long term renal function .

an h & e - stained section of the kidney from a rat treated with 30 mg / kg cocl2 displays complete coagulative tubular necrosis with jablonski acute score 3 .
an h & e - stained section of the kidney from a rat treated with saline displays acute tubular injury affecting the distal one third to one half of the proximal convoluted tubules and has a jablonski acute score 4 .
( b ) tubular damage and necrosis was significantly (* p < 0.05 ) reduced in kidneys of rats treated with 10 mg / kg zncl2 .
data are expressed as mean +/ - sem for each treatment group .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0180028.t001 table 1 jablonski score of rat kidneys after iri .
a grading scale of 0 - 4 , as outlined by jablonski et al. [ 10 ] was used for the histopathological assessment of damage to the proximal tubules induced by ischemia and reperfusion .
rats preconditioned with 10 mg / kg zinc had the lowest average jablonski score after 60 minutes of renal ischemia followed by 7 days of reperfusion .
group primary jablonski score for individual rats average jablonski score saline control ( n = 4 ) 3 2.75 3 3 2 cobalt ( 30mg / kg ) ( n = 3 ) 3 2.67 1 4 zncl2 ( 5mg / kg ) ( n = 5 ) 2 2.60 4 4 2 1 zncl2 ( 10mg / kg ) ( n = 4 ) 1 2.00 4 2 1 zncl2 ( 30mg / kg ) ( n = 4 ) 1 3.00 4 4 3 zinc preconditioning extends the critical ischemia time having established that zncl2 at 10 mg / kg provided the maximal protection against iri in our model , the magnitude of the effect of zncl2 preconditioning was compared to the " safe " warm ischemia time of 30 minutes .
the rise in serum creatinine and urea values induced by 60 minutes ischemia after 10 mg / kg zncl2 preconditioning was almost identical to the rise after 30 minutes of ischemia , and significantly less than in the group subjected to 60 minutes ischemia alone ( fig 4a and 4b ) .
the increase seen in serum creatinine and urea induced by 30 minutes of ischemia is consistent with previous studies [ 14 ] .
therefore , we conclude that zncl2 preconditioning can extend the critical ischemia time from 30 to 60 minutes .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0180028.g004 fig 4 zinc preconditioning extends the critical ischemia time .
the effects of 60 minutes of ischemia with and without zncl2 preconditioning were compared to 30 minutes of ischemia in a rat model of iri .
renal function was assessed by measurement of serum creatinine ( a ) and serum urea ( b ) in rats after 60 minutes ischemia treated with saline (*) or 10mg / kg zncl2 preconditioning ( v ) , or after 30 minute ischemia treated with saline (⬢) .
zncl2 at 10 mg / kg reduced the aki after 60 minutes of ischemia to a level comparable to 30 minutes ischemia , thereby effectively doubling the critical ischemia time .
data are expressed as mean +/ - sem for each treatment group .
comparison of stimulation of hifs by cobalt chloride and zinc chloride preliminary investigation revealed that zncl2 increases the expression of hif1alpha in the immortalized human proximal tubular cell line hk - 2 and in the renal cancer cell line achn in a dose dependent manner ( fig 5a ) .
some toxicity at zncl2 concentrations higher than 75mum was evident from the reduction in expression of gapdh .
therefore , in subsequent experiments a dose of 50mum zncl2 was used .
in order to mimic the three - fold higher dose of cobalt ( 30 mg / kg , compared to 10 mg / kg zncl2 ) used in our in vivo study , a non - toxic 150mum dose of cocl2 was chosen .
150mum cocl2 stimulated hif1alpha and hif2alpha to a far greater degree than 5mum zncl2 in both achn and hk - 2 cells with hif expression decreasing by 24 hours ( fig 5b - 5e ) .
interestingly , neither zncl2 nor cocl2 stimulated expression of hif3alpha in achn or hk - 2 cells .
treatment with zncl2 for 4 hours stimulated phosphorylation of akt in both achn and hk - 2 cells ( fig 5b - 5e ) but activated phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 only in achn cells at 24 hours ( fig 5b and 5c ) .
cocl2 had no effect on phosphorylation of either akt or erk1 / 2 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0180028.g005 fig 5 cobalt and zinc induce hif1alpha and hif2alpha but not hif3alpha .
( a ) western blots revealed that zncl2 induces hif1alpha protein in the human renal cancer cell line achn and the immortalized human renal tubular cell line hk - 2 in a dose - dependent manner .
the expression of hif1alpha , hif2alpha , hif3alpha , phosphorylated - akt and phosphorylated erk1 / 2 proteins in achn ( b , c ) and hk - 2 ( d , e ) cells after treatment with 150mum cocl2 or 50mum zncl2 for 4 or 24 hours was measured by western blot ( b , d ) and analysed by densitometry ( c , e ) .
protein expression was normalized to glyceraldeyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) , and expressed as the fold increase relative to untreated control cells .
data are mean +/ - sem from at least three independent experiments .

discussion even though the protective effect of ic on renal iri has been shown in many animal studies , ic has not been translated to the clinic [ 15 ] .
the limiting step has been the conflicting nature of the published results on ic [ 16 , 17 ] , with no protocol shown to be significantly superior to others .
the use of ic in clinical practice may be limited due to the risk of damage to vascular structures , and the possibility of damage to the target organ in patients with co - morbidities such as diabetes or hypertension .
alternatively as no significant differences were observed between ic and remote ischemic preconditioning ( ripc ) in a meta - analysis of the animal studies [ 15 ] , it was hypothesized that ripc has an equal potential for translation to the clinic .
in contrast results from large - scale randomized controlled trials of ripc focusing on patient - centred outcomes do not support its wider application [ 18 ] .
our observation that ic only marginally reduces serum creatinine and urea post renal iri suggests that further research is warranted before embarking on clinical trials .
no study has previously compared the efficacy of ic and cobalt preconditioning in the kidney .
this study has shown for the first time that renal protection afforded by cocl2 is superior to ic or a combination of both after 40 minutes of warm ischemia .
treatment with cocl2 has the added advantage of simplicity , and allows stimulation at any desired time point by subcutaneous injection .
our observations are consistent with a previous study which showed that cocl2 administered subcutaneously at a dose of 30 mg / kg at day - 1 and day 0 with 12 - hr interval confers significant protection against renal iri induced by 45 minutes of renal pedicle occlusion in rats [ 5 ] .
in some instances there has been an additional protective effect of individual preconditioning techniques when administered in combination as opposed to insufficient protection when administered individually [ 19 ] .
a rather surprising finding of our study was that the combination of cocl2 and intermittent clamping was the worst of all the preconditioning groups .
this difference was observed both in the increases of serum creatinine and urea and in the health scores .
a possible mechanism is the reaction of superoxide ( o2 - ) , produced by ic , with co2 + ions to produce hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) , which is a toxic reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 20 ] .
our finding emphasises the importance of pre - clinical testing of combination therapies in animal models before commencement of any human trials .
despite the beneficial effect of cocl2 , the " quebec beer - drinkers cardiomyopathy " observed in the 1960s and the associated toxicity [ 6 ] have rendered cobalt unsuitable for human use .
while studies are limited , the effect on renal iri of a related metal ion zn2 + , which is routinely used as a dietary supplement , are conflicting .
two decades ago , hegenauer and co - workers showed that intravenous treatment with zn2 + ( 2.5 mg elemental zn / kg , equivalent to 5 mg zncl2 / kg ) 30 minutes prior to warm ischemia produced a significant improvement in renal function in rabbit kidneys [ 21 ] .
in contrast , a decade ago ogawa and co - workers concluded that a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg / kg zinc sulphate had only a minor protective effect against renal iri induced by 30 minutes of ischemia in rats [ 22 ] .
the current study has demonstrated that the efficacy of zncl2 pre - treatment against renal iri is dose dependent .
the lowest dose of 5 mg / kg zncl2 did not offer any protection and , although the rats treated with the highest dose of 30 mg / kg zncl2 displayed no signs of toxicity or discomfort , there was a reduction in renal protection post iri compared to the optimal dose of 10 mg / kg. therefore we concluded that at low doses zncl2 may not reach the therapeutic threshold and at higher doses , zncl2 may become ineffective due to toxicity .
animal health scoring is typically used to assess animal well - being post - surgery .
in this study the sickness score peaked early and then recovered quickly in all preconditioned rats but did not correspond with the serum creatinine and urea values .
alternatively weight loss , measured as a percentage decline from initial weight , is another commonly used criterion of animal health , as rats with acute renal failure will experience reduced appetite .
while not statistically significant , a trend was observed for rats preconditioned with 10 and 30 mg / kg zncl2 to have reduced weight loss compared to control rats at all time points , and an earlier return to weight gain compared to the other groups .
the observation that iri associated with 60 minutes of ischemia after preconditioning with 10 mg / kg zncl2 was equivalent to the " safe " 30 minutes of warm ischemia [ 2 ] suggests that zncl2 preconditioning can effectively double the safe warm ischemia time from 30 minutes to 60 minutes .
if translated to the clinic this discovery will have significant implications for the management of kidney cancer and increase the proportion of cancers that can be treated with nephron - sparing pn rather than radical nephrectomy [ 1 ] .
cocl2 strongly induces expression of the hypoxia - inducible transcription factors ( hifs ) which are involved in a cell 's ability to adapt to low oxygen ( hypoxia ) [ 5 ] and this induction may be one mechanism by which cocl2 protects against iri [ 5 , 23 ] .
more recently , several pharmaceutical companies have developed potent hif - inducing prolyl - hydroxylase ( phd ) inhibitors which have been shown to protect against renal iri [ 24 ] .
the effects of zn2 + ions on the induction of hif1alpha are contradictory and vary between tissues .
the only study using renal cancer cells ( rcc4 ) demonstrated that zn2 + down - regulates expression of hif1alpha and its downstream target vegf in vivo and in vitro [ 25 ] .
the effects of zn2 + ions on hif2alpha and hif3alpha induction had not been investigated previously .
the present study has shown for the first time that zn2 + induces expression of hif1alpha and hif2alpha but not hif3alpha in the renal cancer cell line achn and the immortalized normal tubular cell line hk - 2 .
several studies have highlighted the complexity of iri and indicated that hifs are not the only important pathway .
thus , although the powerful phd inhibitor hydralazine stimulates hif1alpha expression , it does not protect against renal iri [ 26 ] .
moreover , deletion of the hif1alpha gene from cortical neurons does not diminish the protection from hypoxic ischemic injury , nor does it prevent the protective effect of phd inhibition [ 27 ] .
also , while co2 + and hypoxia both induce hif1alpha and hif2alpha , the overlap in the induction of gene expression is very limited [ 28 ] .
furthermore , co2 + and zn2 + ions induce expression of genes independently of either hif1alpha or hif2alpha induction [ 29 , 30 ] , and zn2 + can activate transcription factors other than hifs [ 29 , 31 ] .
further studies are warranted to clarify the role of hif1alpha and hif2alpha activation in zn2 + - mediated protection in renal iri .
there is also a possibility of involvement of other proteins in zinc - induced protection against renal iri .
one such group of candidate proteins are metallothioneins which are cysteine - rich polypeptides of 6 - 7 kda in size .
a connection between their antioxidant activity and protective effects against oxidative stress is well established [ 32 ] .
interestingly a recent study found that although zinc supplementation ( oral 60 mg per day ) did not increase serum metallothioneins in humans there was a significant positive correlation between metallothioneins and kidney function ( as measured by glomerular filtration rate ) , which was influenced by zinc supplementation [ 33 ] .
zn2 + ions have been shown to activate signalling pathways including mapk and pi3k that are involved in cellular proliferation and survival in various cell types [ 29 , 34 , 35 ] .
the current study demonstrates the ability of zn2 + to activate phosphorylation of akt in hk - 2 and achn cells and the phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 in achn cells .
in contrast although co2 + was able to induce expression of hif proteins , it did not stimulate phosphorylation of either akt or erk1 / 2 .
the protective effect of zn2 + against iri in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was previously shown to involve activation of the pi3k / akt signaling pathway [ 36 ] .
the in vitro data presented here support a role for zn2 + in the activation of these pathways to protect against renal iri .
in conclusion , zn2 + preconditioning is able to protect against renal iri in a rat model of iri .
pn is currently under - utilised because of concerns about the warm ischemia time .
although a number of drugs and agents have been shown to improve renal function and provide cytoprotection in vitro and in vivo against ischemic models of acute renal failure , all have failed in human trials and none have progressed to the clinic .
however , a doubling of the currently accepted critical ischemia time through zn2 + preconditioning may cause a transformational change in the management of kidney cancers .

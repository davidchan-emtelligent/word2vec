pfhslv has no homolog in the human host and it is a promising drug target essential to the plasmodial metabolism .
the use of single proteasome inhibitor targeting these threonine proteases has a potential to be antimalarial drug candidate .
one of our recent studies identified several promising inhibitors against 20s beta5 subunit of p. falciparum [ 3 ] .
the present study adopts a similar knowledge based virtual screening strategy using support vector machines ( svm ) and molecular docking to build a focused library of potential pfhslv inhibitors .
svm model has been trained using 170 molecular descriptors of 64 inhibitors and 208 putative non - inhibitors .
the non - linear classifier based on radial basis function ( rbf ) kernel yielded classification accuracy of 97 % .
the svm model rapidly predicted inhibitors from nci library and were subsequently docked in to the active site of an optimised three - dimensional model of pfhslv .
the novel drug - like pfhslv inhibitors with very good binding affinity and novel scaffold can be a good starting point to develop new antimalarial drugs .

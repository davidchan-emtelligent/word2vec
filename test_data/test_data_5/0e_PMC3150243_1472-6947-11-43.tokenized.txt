background previously we described parents' and professionals' experiences with a web - based communication system in a 6 - month pilot in three dutch cerebral palsy care settings .
we found that half of the participating professionals had not used the system , and of those who had used the system one third had used it only once .
the present study aimed to evaluate whether professionals' system use was associated with their a priori expectancies and background .
methods professionals who had not used the system ( n = 54 ) were compared with professionals who had used the system more than once ( n = 46 ) on the basis of their questionnaire responses before the pilot , their affiliation and the number of patients which they represented in the study .
the questionnaire items comprised professionals' expectancies regarding the system 's performance and ease of use , as well as the expected time availability and integration into daily care practice .
results overall , users had higher a priori expectancies than non - users .
system use was associated with expected ease of use ( p = . 046 ) and time availability ( p = . 005 ) : 50 % of the users ( vs. 31 % of the non - users ) expected that the system would be easy to use and 93 % of the users ( vs. 72 % of the non - users ) expected that they would be able to reserve a time slot each week for responding to submitted questions. with respect to professionals' affiliation , system use was associated with professionals' institution ( p = . 003 ) and discipline ( p = . 001 ) , with more ( para - ) medical professionals among users ( 93 % vs. 63 % among non - users ) , and more education professionals among non - users ( 37 % vs. 7 % among users ) .
in addition , users represented more patients ( mean 2 , range 1 - 8 ) than non - users ( mean 1.1 , range 1 - 2 ) ( p = . 000 ) .
conclusions professionals' system use was associated with expected ease of use and time availability , professionals' affiliation and the number of represented patients , while no association was found with expected performance of the system .
to achieve higher adoption rates in the future , it is important to further develop the technology by optimizing the system 's ease of use and interoperability and including advanced consultation options .
in addition , better identified end users should be more extensively informed about the system 's possibilities through tailored education .
background children with special health care needs ( cshcn ) are an important population from health care services , economic and policy perspectives [ 1 ] .
the cshcn population involves ' children who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical , developmental , behavioural , or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally ' [ 2 ] .
the broad range of care needs in this population often requires complex and long - term health ( related ) services from multiple providers across diverse organisations and sectors .
in such ' integrated care ' settings , inter - professional communication about children 's needs , family context , and prior experiences with and responses to health care is essential for effective coordination of services [ 3 ] .
however , the findings of the u.s. national survey of cshcn 2005 - 2006 revealed that those children most in need of comprehensive , coordinated systems of care were the least likely to receive such care [ 4 ] .
in addition , a study among cshcn populations with neurological conditions found that children with multiple conditions had the greatest unmet needs and dissatisfaction with care coordination [ 5 ] , which was defined in terms of communication among doctors and between doctors and other providers and whether the family received sufficient help coordinating care , if needed .
failure of professionals caring for the same child to communicate with one another often leaves the parents as information intermediaries [ 6 ] .
this corresponds to our findings on the care of children with cerebral palsy in the netherlands ( see appendix 1 ) , in which we identified various gaps in patient care communication , such as lack of patient centredness and poor inter - professional information exchange , leading to parents acting as messengers of information , as well as to hesitation among professionals to contact each other due to unfamiliarity with those involved in the care network [ 7 ] .
although much has been written about the potential of telemedicine to increase access to care , applications in paediatrics are relatively scarce [ 8 ] .
nevertheless , they are increasingly being applied to facilitate communication between health care providers and caregivers of paediatric patients with health conditions requiring follow - up [ 9,10 ] .
examples include applications using synchronous video - conferencing as the most common mode of communication , and consultation and diagnosis as the most common function [ 9 ] .
in order to improve parent - professional and inter - professional communication in three dutch cerebral palsy care settings , we developed an asynchronous , secure web - based communication system aimed at increasing patient centeredness , facilitating inter - professional contact and enhancing network transparency .
previously we described its design features , technical feasibility and clinical usability with respect to its aims , as well as parents' and professionals' actual system use in a 6 - months pilot in three dutch care regions .
we found that half of the participating professionals had not used the system at all and of the professionals who had used the system , a third had used it only once [ 11 ] .
to enable the development of services with a higher adoption rate it is important to obtain insight into the determinants of use and non - use [ 12 ] , which might facilitate the definition of user requirements and hence a better fit between user requirements and the system .
functional user requirements generally concern the clinical value / targeted performance , while non - functional requirements mostly concern ease of use , both of which are considered important determinants of usage intention and subsequent usage behaviour [ 13,14 ] .
the aim of this study was therefore to evaluate whether professionals' a priori expectancies regarding the system 's performance and ease of use were associated with their subsequent use and non - use of the system .
in addition , as focus groups convened in the development phase of the project revealed the importance of time availability and integration into daily practice and the role of professional background , these aspects were evaluated as well .
the evaluation was performed on user level , comparing professionals who had not used the system ( n = 54 ) with professionals who had used the system more than once ( n = 46 ) , hypothesizing higher a priori expectancies in the use - group .
professional background was evaluated in terms of professionals' affiliation ( care region , institution , discipline ) and the number of patients which they represented in the study , hypothesizing that professionals in the use - group would represent a higher number of patients .
appendix 1 ) cerebral palsy care in the netherlands in the netherlands , paediatric rehabilitation services are delivered in both inpatient and outpatient settings .
the 23 national rehabilitation centres with paediatric facilities and the rehabilitation departments of all medium - sized and larger hospitals offer treatment on an outpatient basis only .
for inpatient treatment children can be referred to one of nine specialized , regional rehabilitation centres .
annually , 6,755 children are treated on an outpatient basis and 363 children on an inpatient basis [ 15 ] .
more than half of these children have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy , an umbrella term for a group of motor disorders which cause activity limitation and are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation , perception , cognition , communication and behaviour , by epilepsy , and by secondary musculoskeletal problems .
while its prevalence ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births with little or no variation among western nations , the importance of cerebral palsy is particularly related to its severity and its consequent burden on affected children , families and societies [ 16 ] .
given the broad range of disabilities associated with cerebral palsy , various professionals from diverse organizations are involved in meeting each patient 's care needs .
in the netherlands , cerebral palsy patients aged 4 - 8 years usually are under the supervision of a rehabilitation physician in a ( specialized ) regional or academic hospital , who often plays a coordinating role in the integral medical care .
at the age of 4 , the children are referred either to regular schools ( whether or not assisted by ambulant supervision ) or to schools for special education / specialized day care centres .
children in regular education can often do with outpatient supervision combined with mono - disciplinary therapy in a primary care centre .
schools for special education usually have close cooperation with the local rehabilitation centre , while specialized day care centres are often supported by ambulant consultation of a rehabilitation physician .
methods study population to obtain data representative for the integrated care setting of cerebral palsy , the study covered three dutch care regions ranging from urban to more rural settings .
the inclusion of professionals was based on the inclusion of cerebral palsy patients and their parents , which was determined by a rehabilitation physician based on specific selection criteria which we described in our previous study [ 11 ]. of all the professionals involved in the care of the 30 selected cerebral palsy patients , 120 ( 67 %) were willing to participate in the study .
both parents and professionals gave informed consent after which they received log - in details for system access .
system use was on a voluntary basis , i.e. professionals were free in their choice to use the system in a given situation or to apply their usual modes of communication ( face - to - face , telephone etc. ) .
the study was conducted in keeping with the protocol of the wma declaration of helsinki .
according to dutch legislation ( wmo medical research involving human subjects act ) a medical ethics review was not required .
system use and non - use the system comprised an open access part ( a generally accessible website with project related information ) and a personalized secured access part with various consultation options .
professionals could contact the parents of the patient ( s ) whom they represented in the study , as well as colleague - professionals involved in the patient 's care network .
a detailed description of the system 's technical and functional specifications can be found in our previous study [ 11 ]. of the 120 participating professionals , 54 had not used the system during the 6 - month pilot ( of which 33 did log into the system ) , 20 professionals had used the system only once and 46 had used it more than once ( with a mean of n = 6 questions / responses per professional , sd 5 and range 2 - 23 ) .
in view of the system 's aim to facilitate inter - professional contact , professionals' system use was defined in terms of submitting a question / response in the system more than once .
consequently , trying out the system only once or logging - in without submitting a question / response was not considered actual system use .
the definition of use in terms of using the system more than once was made quite arbitrarily , but with the intention to create a real contrast between the use and non - use group .
study design we verified that all 120 participating professionals completed the baseline questionnaire before obtaining access to the web - based system .
in table 1 an overview is given of the questionnaire items .
performance expectancy items were derived from the system 's aims , which were based on the experienced gaps in communication we previously identified in cerebral palsy care settings [ 7 ] .
for the majority of items a 5 - point likert - scale was used , ranging from ' no , not at all ' to ' yes , definitely ' with open text area for clarification .
the items on inter - professional communication ( i.e. frequency of contact , accessibility of professionals and facilitation of inter - professional consultation ) were assessed by means of a scoring table in which professionals could mark their response for each professional involved in their care network (' rarely '/' occasionally '/' regularly ' for the item frequency of contact and ' yes '/' do n't know '/' no ' for the items accessibility of professionals and facilitation of inter - professional consultation ) .
table 1 questionnaire items evaluating professionals' a priori expectancies of the web - based system .
performance frequency of contacthow often do you expect to contact colleague - professionals through use of the system ?
accessibility of professionalsdo you expect that you will be able to reach colleague - professionals more easily through use of the system ?
facilitation of inter - professional consultationdo you expect that you will be able to consult colleague - professionals more often through use of the system ?
parents' messenger roledo you expect that as a result of using the system parents less often have to act as messenger of information between professionals ?
consistency of informationdo you expect that as a result of using the system more consistent information can be given to parents ?
transparency of care networkdo you expect that as a result of using the system the child 's care network will be more transparent ?
( i.e. who is involved from which organization etc. ) ease of use do you expect that the system will be easy to use for you ?
time availability do you expect that you will be able to reserve one time slot each week for responding to submitted questions on the system ?
integration daily care practice do you expect that you will be able to reserve time for system use within your regular working hours ?
the individual scores in each scoring table were recoded into one total score .
for the item frequency of contact the total score was ' regularly ' when the respondent expected to have regular contact with at least one of his / her colleague - professionals .
when this was not the case , the total score was ' occasionally ' when the respondent expected to have occasional contact with at least one of his / her colleague - professionals .
when the respondent did not expect to have regular nor occasional contact with any of his / her colleague - professionals , the total score was ' rarely ' .
for the items accessibility of professionals and facilitation of inter - professional consultation a positive total score (' yes ') was given when the respondent expected to resp .
reach / consult at least one of his / her colleague - professionals more easily / more often .
a negative total score (' no ') was given when the respondent did not expect to reach / consult any of his / her colleague - professionals more easily / more often .
a neutral total score was assigned when the respondent did not know what to expect .
data analysis professionals who had not used the system ( n = 54 ) were compared with professionals who had used the system more than once ( n = 46 ) .
professionals who had used the system only once ( n = 20 ) were included in descriptive overviews , but were left out of the statistical analysis in order to create a real contrast between the use and non - use group .
for the comparison of professionals' expectancies , fisher exact tests ( alpha = . 05 , df = 1 ) were applied , contrasting the upper response category ( positive expectancy scores ) with the latter two response categories ( neutral and negative expectancy scores ) , using one - sided p - values in line with our hypothesis that users would have higher expectancies than non - users .
for the comparison of professionals' affiliation and the number of patients which professionals represented in the study , pearson chi - square tests were applied ( alpha = . 05 , 2 - sided ) .
given the skewed distribution of the number of represented patients ( the majority of professionals participated in the study for only 1 child ) , it was categorized into an ordinal variable ( n = 1 , n = 2 and n >= 3 ) .
results system use & professionals' a priori expectancies in table 2 an overview is given of professionals' a priori expectancies in the use and non - use group .
as can be seen , both users and non - users had rather high a priori expectancies of the system , although expectancies of users were mostly higher than those of non - users .
a statistically significant association was found between system use and expected ease of use ( p = . 046 ) and time availability ( p = . 005 ) : 50 % of the users vs. 31 % of the non - users expected that the system would be easy to use while 93 % of the users vs. 72 % of the non - users expected that they would be able to reserve one time slot each week for responding to submitted questions .
although no statistically significant association was found between system use and professionals' expectancies regarding the system 's performance , users tended to score higher than non - users .

overall , users had higher a priori expectancies than non - users .
system use was associated with expected ease of use and time availability , while no association was found with professionals' a priori expectancies regarding the system 's performance .
the association with expected ease of use confirms our hypothesis and is conform adoption literature [ 13,14 ] .
the association with expected time availability is in line with findings in literature reporting providers' concerns that web - based communication would add to their work - load rather than substitute for other tasks [ 17,18 ] .
considering the rather high performance expectancies of both users and non - users , one could argue there was little doubt in either of the groups about the expected clinical value of the system , whereas the groups differed in the amount of effort they expected to invest in using the system .
those expecting to have more time available and / or that the system would be easy to use indeed used the system more often .
comparing these findings with frequently used it adoption models such as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology [ 14 ] , the lack of association between system use and professionals' expectancies regarding the system 's performance is surprising , as performance expectancy is considered a direct determinant of usage intention and subsequent usage behaviour [ 14 ] .
the fact that we did not find an association might be related to our operationalization of performance in terms of the aims of the web - based system .
although these system aims were derived from experienced gaps in communication previously identified in cerebral palsy care settings [ 7 ] , an operationalization in broader terms ( i.e. system use would improve my job performance / increase my productivity / make it easier to do my job / etcetera [ 14 ]) might have better addressed the wide range of professionals' outcome expectancies. with respect to professionals' affiliation , system use was associated with institution and discipline , with more ( para - ) medical professionals among users and more education professionals among non - users .
on the one hand this could imply that the system was of less use to education professionals : their communication with parents usually comprises face - to - face contact , while their inter - professional communication might be less focused on the integrated care network but more on the internal contact within the school / day care centre .
on the other hand , they could have had the intention to use the system , but might not have needed to use it for the particular child they represented in the study , a hypothesis strengthened by the fact that all 31 education professionals who participated did so for only one patient .
indeed , system use was significantly associated with the number of patients which professionals represented in the study : of the professionals who had not used the system the far majority ( 93 %) represented only one patient .
although professionals' system use was associated with their a priori expectancies and background , the differences between users and non - users were not as pronounced as might be expected. from a methodological point of view , this might be related to the fact that professionals who had not used the system at all were compared with professionals who had used the system more than once .
this low cut - off point was chosen given the limited range of frequency of use .
a clearer contrast between use and non - use and larger population series might have yielded more pronounced differences between both groups .
the evaluation in the present study was performed on the level of individual users and was not focused on the inter - professional and inter - organizational environment that is inherent to integrated care settings such as cerebral palsy .
adoption of innovative technologies that span professional and institutional boundaries pose challenges in terms of coordination of care processes , such as changing handovers , alignment of objectives and working culture and integrating the technology in each different setting [ 19 ] .
to ensure that health care technologies are effectively used , an approach is needed that incorporates the complex interdependencies between technology , people and their social - cultural environment [ 20 ] .
usually the design and pilot evaluation phases require an interactive process of co - creation and close collaboration with intended users and stakeholders [ 20 ] , and it will take a while before the technology is sufficiently stable for broad diffusion and interoperable across organizational and social contexts and technical infrastructures [ 21 ] .
these dynamics are to be taken into account when deciding on an evaluation method .
in order to generate usable evidence in the early stages of the fast changing field of telehealth [ 22 ] , new methodologies such as constructive technology assessment [ 23 ] or a holistic approach for the design and evaluation of ehealth technologies [ 20 ] can be considered .
conclusions for a better understanding of the adoption of telemedicine applications , analysis of determinants of use and non - use is essential .
the findings of the present study suggest that users and non - users differ from each other with respect to some of their a priori expectancies , their affiliation and the number of patients which they represented in the study .
this information can be taken into account in the further implementation of the system in every day care , but also by making system adaptations in order to increase the chance of professionals' system use .
considering the users' higher expectancies of the system 's ease of use , this aspect could be further optimized by reducing the amount of time involved in system use and providing a better integration of the system in daily care practice by linking the system 's communication automatically with existing patient records .
as performance expectancies are generally considered a strong determinant of system use , tailored education addressing the broad range of professionals' outcome expectancies may contribute to adoption. with respect to professional background , system use by education professionals might be stimulated through advanced consultation options tailored to their specific needs , provided that the number of patients for which they participate is large enough in order to adequately engage in the system .
in line with a staged approach to telemedicine evaluation , the present study had an explorative character and focused on a limited number of factors that could explain professionals' system use and non - use .
further research may include a more comprehensive evaluation of technology , human and organization issues , in which multivariate analysis can be used to gain insight into the relative contribution of these factors .

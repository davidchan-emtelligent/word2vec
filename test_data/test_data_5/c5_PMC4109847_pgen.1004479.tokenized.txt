craniofacial development requires signals from epithelia to pattern skeletogenic neural crest ( nc ) cells , such as the subdivision of each pharyngeal arch into distinct dorsal ( d ) and ventral ( v ) elements .
wnt signaling has been implicated in many aspects of nc and craniofacial development , but its roles in d - v arch patterning remain unclear .
to address this we blocked wnt signaling in zebrafish embryos in a temporally - controlled manner , using transgenics to overexpress a dominant negative tcf3 , ( dntcf3 ) , ( tg ( hsp70i : tcf3 - gfp ) , or the canonical wnt inhibitor dickkopf1 ( dkk1 ) , ( tg ( hsp70i : dkk1 - gfp ) after nc migration .
in dntcf3 transgenics , nc cells in the ventral arches of heat - shocked embryos show reduced proliferation , expression of ventral patterning genes ( hand2 , dlx3b , dlx5a , msxe ) , and ventral cartilage differentiation ( e.g. lower jaws ) .
these d - v patterning defects resemble the phenotypes of zebrafish embryos lacking bmp or edn1 signaling , and overexpression of dntcf3 dramatically reduces expression of a subset of bmp receptors in the arches .
addition of ectopic bmp ( or edn1 ) protein partially rescues ventral development and expression of dlx3b , dlx5a , and msxe in wnt signaling - deficient embryos , but surprisingly does not rescue hand2 expression .
thus wnt signaling provides ventralizing patterning cues to arch nc cells , in part through regulation of bmp and edn1 signaling , but independently regulates hand2 .
similarly , heat - shocked dkk1 + embryos exhibit ventral arch reductions , but also have mandibular clefts at the ventral midline not seen in dntcf3 + embryos .
dkk1 is expressed in pharyngeal endoderm , and cell transplantation experiments reveal that dntcf3 must be overexpressed in pharyngeal endoderm to disrupt d - v arch patterning , suggesting that distinct endodermal roles for wnts and wnt antagonists pattern the developing skeleton .
author summary craniofacial abnormalities are among the most common birth defects .
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying craniofacial disorders is crucial for developing treatment strategies .
much of the craniofacial skeleton arises from specialized embryonic structures known as pharyngeal arches .
patterning of these arches requires precise spatial and temporal expression of multiple genes , which is coordinated between tissues by secreted signals .
wnts are secreted ligands expressed throughout the pharyngeal arches yet their role in craniofacial patterning remains unclear .
in this study we examine the role of wnts in craniofacial patterning using transgenic zebrafish to inhibit downstream wnt signaling .
we show that wnt signaling deficient embryos have lower jaw specific defects , which strongly resembles loss - of - function phenotypes in both the bmp and edn1 signaling pathways. through rescue experiments we find that wnts are upstream regulators of both bmp and edn1 signaling .
we thus have uncovered a crucial requirement for wnt signaling in craniofacial patterning .

introduction a fundamental question in skeletal biology is how cartilages and bones with distinct shapes arise from skeletogenic precursor cells .
much of the craniofacial skeleton derives from neural crest ( nc ) cells that migrate in streams into the pharyngeal arches and contain anterior - posterior ( a - p ) patterning information obtained prior to migration [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
however , these nc cells also become intimately associated with epithelia , including surface ectoderm and pharyngeal endoderm , which produce signals important for skeletal patterning .
for example , fgf8 from the facial ectoderm regulates a - p polarity of the mandibular arch as well as nc proliferation / survival [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] .
surgical disruption of the pharyngeal endoderm in chick [ 7 ] , or mutations that disrupt endoderm in zebrafish , lead to severe cartilage malformations [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] .
endoderm - derived fgf3 induces cartilage formation [ 9 ] and sphingosine phosphate - 1 from endoderm modulates shh signaling to promote mandibular growth and patterning [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] .
ectoderm - derived shh induces upper jaw and neurocranial structures [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
thus , craniofacial skeletal shapes reflect interplay between epithelial signals and intrinsic properties of mesenchyme , but the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear .
one well - studied example of such epithelial - mesenchymal interactions in the pharyngeal skeleton is the induction of ventral skeletal fates along the dorsal - ventral ( d - v ) axis of the mandibular arch by ectodermal endothelin 1 ( edn1 ) and bone morphogenetic proteins ( bmps ) [ 16 ] - [ 22 ] .
conditional loss of bmp4 in the facial ectoderm in mice inhibits ventral mandibular growth and patterning [ 23 ] .
loss of edn1 and / or any of several components of its signal transduction pathway leads to severe jaw truncations , both in mice and in humans , and in some cases transformations of ventral tissues ( the lower jaw ) to a more dorsal identity [ 22 ] , [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] .
initially both edn1 and bmps induce similar subsets of ventral / intermediate genes as well as restricting jag1 signaling to the dorsal domain [ 16 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 28 ] .
but once arch primordia are established , effects of bmps become more ventrally restricted to domains that no longer depend on edn1 , particularly the transcription factor hand2 .
uniform application of bmp or edn1 proteins can restore many aspects of d - v patterning in bmp - and edn1 - deficient zebrafish embryos , suggesting that other ventralizing signals must interact to control d - v patterning [ 22 ] .
wnts are good candidates for additional signals involved in d - v patterning based on their localized expression and known requirements in craniofacial development .
several wnt ligands show restricted expression in facial epithelia ( ectoderm , endoderm ) in zebrafish , chick and mouse embryos [ 29 ] - [ 32 ] and frizzled ( fzd ) receptors are expressed throughout arch nc cells and endoderm [ 31 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
in addition , expression of lef1 , tcf1 , beta - catenin ( betacat ) , [ 35 ] , and transgenic wnt signaling reporter lines ( lef / tcf promoters driving beta - gal or lacz expression ) in mice all are ventrally ( distally ) restricted in the mandibular as well as distal maxillary prominences [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
like bmps , wnt signaling is necessary for early nc cell induction [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] and also plays later roles in nc migration , fate specification , and proliferation [ 40 ] .
in zebrafish , conditional overexpression of a dominant negative tcf3 ( dntcf3 ) during nc cell specification dramatically reduces nc cell numbers [ 41 ] , similar to depletion of fzd3 receptors in xenopus [ 42 ] .
wnt1 - / - / wnt3 - / - double mutant mice show reduced proliferation of pre - migratory nc cells [ 43 ] .
conditional loss of betacat in the pharyngeal ectoderm impairs growth of the facial prominences [ 44 ] , while conditional loss of betacat in cranial nc cells leads to apoptosis and a nearly complete loss of nc - derived craniofacial structures [ 45 ] .
finally , loss of tcf4 / lef1 function or overexpression of the wnt inhibitor dickkopff - 1 ( dkk1 ) results in smaller facial structures and clefting between the frontonasal and maxillary prominences [ 36 ] .
similarly , wnt signaling is important for facial midline development in humans as incidences of cleft lip and palate have been mapped to genetic variations in wnt ligands [ 46 ] .
in this study , we examine temporal requirements for wnt signaling in zebrafish d - v craniofacial development .
we utilize two transgenic lines , tg ( hsp701 : dkk1 - gfp )( dkk1 +) and tg ( hsp70i : tcf3 - gfp ) ( dntcf3 +) , to interfere with wnt signaling conditionally , in a stage - specific manner .
tg ( hsp701 : dkk1 - gfp ) embryos overexpress dkk1 , a secreted negative regulator , while tg ( hsp70i : tcf3 - gfp ) embryos overexpress a dominant negative form of the tcf3 transcription factor .
both methods of inhibiting wnt signaling after nc cell migration result in proliferation and ventral patterning defects in the mandibular and hyoid arches .
interestingly , dkk1 + embryos also show unique clefting of the lower jaw .
defects in ventral - intermediate specific gene expression and expansion of the dorsal specific jag1b resemble loss of bmp and edn1 signaling [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
we show that wnt signaling promotes bmp signaling through regulation of expression of two specific bmp receptors , bmpr1ab and bmpr1ba , in the pharyngeal arches .
ectopic bmp protein can rescue msxe , dlx3b , dlx5a but not hand2 in the absence of wnt signaling , demonstrating that wnts participate in a regulatory network with bmp and edn1 signaling , but separately in hand2 regulation , to control d - v pharyngeal patterning .
chimeric analyses reveal that dntcf3 acts cell autonomously in pharyngeal endoderm , which also expresses dkk1 .
this suggests that wnts regulate patterning in the endoderm , which through some as yet unknown signal imparts d - v patterning upon neighboring skeletal progenitors in the nc. results wnt responses are highest in the ventral pharyngeal arches numerous wnt ligands ( wnt2 , wnt4 , wnt5a / b , wnt 6 , and wnt7a / b ) and receptors ( fzd1 , fzd3 , fzd4 , fzd6 , fzd7 , fzd8 , and fzd10 ) are expressed broadly in the pharyngeal ectoderm , endoderm , neural crest ( nc ) , and mesoderm [ 29 ] , [ 32 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] .
to determine which regions of the pharyngeal arches respond directly to wnt signaling we used in situ hybridization ( ish ) to examine expression of the direct downstream wnt target mycn ( fig. 1a,b ) , an oncogene with roles in regulating wnt - dependent morphogenesis and proliferation [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] .
mycn mrna was detected throughout the arches but at higher levels in the ventral domain , primarily within the nc mesenchyme ( arrowheads in fig. 1a,b ) .
to further address which pharyngeal tissues respond directly , we examined expression of a transgenic wnt reporter zebrafish tg ( 7xtcf - xla.siam : gfp ) ia4 ( 7xtcf : gfp ) [ 49 ] , which contains seven tcf response elements driving expression of gfp , thus acting as a live reporter in cells where stabilized beta - catenin ( betacat ) interacts with tcf transcription factors .
ish for gfp mrna at 28 hours postfertilization ( hpf ) revealed regions of 7xtcf : gfp expression in the ventral first and second arches ( fig. 1c ) , which in transverse sections appeared localized both to arch nc cells and pharyngeal endoderm , but not pharyngeal ectoderm ( fig. 1d ) .

blocking wnt signaling after nc migration disrupts the ventral arch skeleton to bypass earlier requirements for wnts in embryogenesis we took a conditional loss - of - function approach using heat shock - inducible transgenic zebrafish lines to inhibit wnt signaling in a temporally - controlled manner .
tg ( hsp70i : tcf3 - gfp ) ( hs - dntcf3 ) embryos overexpress a truncated form of the transcription factor tcf3 with gfp replacing the betacat - interacting domain , under control of heat shock promoter 70 [ 41 ]. with a similar hsp70 promoter , tg ( hsp701 : dkk1 - gfp ) ( hs - dkk1 ) embryos overexpress full length dkk1b tagged with a gfp [ 50 ] , which prevents fzd - lrp co - receptor binding [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
to verify that wnt - betacat signaling was affected in hs - dkk1 + and hs - dntcf3 + embryos we used ish to examine the expression of mycn and axin2 , both direct wnt targets , after heat shocking during stages of craniofacial patterning .
at 4 hours post heat shock ( hphs ) hs - dntcf3 + embryos heat shocked at 22 hpf showed severe reductions in expression of mycn in the arches , eyes , and brain and axin2 ( which shows only very weak or no expression in pharyngeal arches ) , in the eyes and brain ( fig. 1e - h ) .
similarly , compared with controls ( fig. s1a , c ) at 2 hphs hs - dkk1 + embryos heat shocked at 24 hpf showed reduced mycn in the arches , eye , and brain and axin2 expression in the brain but to a lesser extent than in hs - dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. s1b , d ) .
to determine stage - specific defects caused by disrupting wnt signaling in hs - dntcf3 + and hs - dkk1 + embryos we performed quantitative real time pcr ( qpcr ) analysis of direct wnt targets .
in hs - dntcf3 + embryos , axin2 and mycn expression was reduced significantly from 2 - 8 hphs ( fig. 1i ) , but recovered and slightly increased by 24 hphs ( fig. 1i ) .
lef1 , a transcriptional cofactor in the wnt pathway [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] , was also significantly reduced in hs - dntcf3 + embryos from 2 - 8 hphs ( fig. 1i ) .
in hs - dkk1 + embryos , axin2 expression was severely reduced from 1 - 8 hphs , while lef1 downregulation started later , from 4 - 8 hphs ( fig. s1e ) .
thus both hs - dntcf3 and hs - dkk1 lines deplete wnt signaling almost immediately after heat shock and repress wnt signaling for up to 8 hphs .
alcian blue staining of cartilage in larvae at 96 hpf revealed that , compared with controls , hs - dkk1 +/ - heterozygotes heat shocked for 30 min at 16 - 28 hpf developed mandibular clefting and reduced meckel 's cartilages ( mc ) , as well as mild reductions in other craniofacial cartilages ( fig. 2a , b , d ) .
homozygous hs - dkk1 +/+ larvae displayed dramatic shortening of mc ventrally in the first arch , as well as the symplectic ( sy ) , a more intermediate / dorsal element of the second arch ( fig. 2c , e ; [ 19 ] , [ 20 ]) .
thus , hereafter " dkk1 +" refers to homozygous hs - dkk1 embryos / larvae heat shocked for 30 min between 20 - 22 hpf .

scale bar : 100 microm .
heterozygous hs - dntcf3 + larvae heat shocked slightly later ( 22 - 24 hpf ) also showed mild reductions in mc , but in this case mc was fused to the more dorsal palatoquadrate ( pq ) in arch 1 ( fig. 2f , h ) .
the ceratohyal ( ch ) in ventral arch 2 was also variably reduced , but more posterior cartilages appeared largely unaffected .
cartilage defects in homozygous hs - dntcf3 larvae heat shocked similarly were much more severe ( fig. 2e , g ) - 41 % showed reduced mc and ch reduction / loss , while 66 % showed joint fusion between mc and pq ( fig. 2h ) .
thus , hereafter " dntcf3 +" refers to heterozygous hs - dntcf3 +/ - embryos / larvae heat shocked for 12 min between 22 - 24 hpf .
to determine tissue - specific requirements for wnt signaling in the pharyngeal arches , we transplanted dntcf3 + cells at gastrula stages either into the fate map position that gives rise to nc or co - injected with taram - a mrna to drive them to an endodermal fate , into non - transgenic wt hosts [ 9 ] .
while dntcf3 + nc cells in chimeras that virtually filled the entire mandibular arch caused no discernable cartilage defects ( not shown ) , large grafts of dntcf3 + endodermal cells into the pharyngeal region induced d - v patterning defects that resembled dntcf + embryos , including reduced mc and fused mc - pq ( fig. s2a ) .
these results suggest that the critical direct response to wnt occurs in the endoderm ( which expresses 7xtcf : gfp ) and is indirectly relayed to surrounding nc cells .
to verify that cartilage defects in dkk1 + and dntcf3 + larvae reflect specific requirements for wnt signaling we attempted to rescue them using the compound 6 - bromoindirubin - 3 ' - oxime ( bio ) , which stabilizes wnt signaling by inhibiting gsk - 3 [ 55 ] .
bio treatments of 7xtcf : gfp embryos at 24 hpf caused ectopic gfp expression and direct wnt targets were upregulated in a dose - dependent manner as determined by ish and qpcr analysis at 30 hpf ( fig. s3 ) .
treatment of wild type embryos with bio resulted in an overall reduction of cartilages in a dose - dependent manner , which correlated with reduced proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( pcna ) expression ( which marks cells in mitosis [ 56 ]) in the arches at 30 hpf , indicating reduced proliferation of cartilage precursors ( fig. s4j - l ) .
despite their smaller sizes , dorsal cartilages acquired more rod - like morphologies similar to ventral mc and ch , suggesting partial ventralization ( fig. s4a - c ) .
bio treatments of both heat shocked dntcf3 + and dkk1 + transgenics partially rescued cartilage defects , including mc - pq joint fusions and ch was consistently restored in dntcf3 + larvae ( fig. s4d - i , m ) .
bio also rescued mc clefting in dkk1 + larvae at higher concentrations ( fig. s4g - i ) .
therefore loss of canonical wnt signaling in dntcf3 + and dkk1 + embryos accounts for the majority of craniofacial defects .
blocking wnt signaling disrupts proliferation in ventral arch nc cells cartilages in dntcf3 + and dkk1 + larvae were 30 - 50 % smaller than controls ( fig. 2 ) .
this reduced cartilage size was not due to increased cell death as we could detect no differences in the number of acridine orange stained cells in the arches between dntcf3 + , dkk1 + and control embryos at 6 hphs ( fig. s5 ) .
to examine proliferation in the arches we performed ish for pcna .
pcna mrna was detected throughout the pharyngeal arches from 3 - 22 hphs ( 25 - 44 hpf ) in controls ( fig. 3a - d ) , but somewhat reduced at 3 hphs ( 25 hpf ) in both dkk1 + and dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 3a , e , i , m ). by 6 hphs ( 28 hpf ) pcna expression was nearly undetectable in the arches in both dkk1 + ( 66 % , n = 6 ) and dntcf3 + ( 60 % , n = 10 ) ( fig. 3b , f , j , m ). by 8 hphs ( 30 hpf ) , pcna expression had recovered slightly in dntcf3 + embryos ( 36 % , n = 11 ) ( fig. 3k , m ) but not in dkk1 + embryos ( 80 % , n = 5 ) ( fig. 3g , m ) .
both recovered completely by 22 - 28 hphs ( 44 hpf ) ( fig. 3d , h , l , m ) .

( m ) histogram quantifying percentages of dkk1 + and dntcf3 + embryos with moderate versus severe reductions in pcna expression .
scale bar : 100 microm .
to confirm these apparent defects in proliferation we used an antibody that recognizes phosphohistone3 ( ph 3 ) , a protein involved in chromosome condensation in mitotic cells [ 57 ] , which marks a subset of pcna + dividing cells .
in dkk1 + and dntcf3 + embryos ph 3 staining was reduced throughout the eye and brain ( fig. s6a - b , d - e ) .
at 4 hphs , dkk1 + embryos had a 75 % reduction in ph 3 + cells in the arches compared to controls ( fig. s6a ' , b ' , c ) .
similarly , at 3 hphs dntcf3 + embryos had approximately 50 % fewer ph 3 + cells in the arches than controls ( fig. s6d ' , e ' , f ) .
thus depleting wnt signaling in embryos between 24 - 30 hpf severely impairs proliferation in the arches , which correlates with reductions in cartilage and in wnt target gene expression ( figs. 1 , 2 ) .
blocking wnt signaling disrupts expression of ventral arch patterning genes to investigate roles for wnt signaling in d - v patterning within the arches , we examined expression of genes that mark distinct ventral , intermediate and dorsal regions of the arch primordia in dntcf3 + and dkk1 + embryos with ish [ 19 ] .
hand2 expression in the ventral - most domains of each arch was severely reduced in both dkk1 + ( 53 % , n = 15 ) and dntcf3 + ( 59 % , n = 17 ) embryos ( fig. 4a - c , q ) , with a small domain of expression remaining at the arch 1 - 2 boundary in dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 4c ) .
similarly , expression of dlx3b and dlx6a in the intermediate domains of each arch were mildly reduced in dkk1 + ( 44 % , n = 18 , 23 % , n = 21 ) and severely reduced in dntcf3 + embryos ( 83 % , n = 12 ; 90 % , n = 21 ) ( fig. 4d - i , q ) .
finally , expression of the notch ligand , jag1b in the dorsal - most domains of each arch [ 28 ] , was variably expanded ventrally in dkk1 + ( 10.5 % , n = 57 ) embryos and consistently expanded in dntcf3 + embryos ( 55.5 % , n = 9 ) as well as chimeras in which dntcf3 + cells were transplanted into the pharyngeal endoderm ( fig. 4j - l , q ; fig. s2b - c ) .
these gene expression changes were not simply due to an overall loss of arches or nc cells , since dlx2a expression ( fig. 4n , p ) as well as sox10 : lyntdtom expression throughout the d - v extent of the arch nc were unaffected in the arches of both dkk1 + and dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. s7 ) .
additionally , bio treatments of wild type embryos caused dorsal expansion of expression of the ventral - intermediate gene msxe , mild expansion of dlx3b and hand2 expression , and reduced jag1b expression in the dorsal domain ( fig. s8 ) .
therefore , wnt signaling promotes ventral and intermediate - cell fates in the arches .
dntcf3 + embryos in particular , with residual hand2 expression at the arch 1 - 2 boundary , closely resemble mutants in bmp and edn1 signaling [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .

blocking wnt signaling disrupts bmp and edn1 signaling in the arches because dntcf3 + embryos showed d - v defects in cartilage morphology and gene expression that more closely resembled bmp - and edn1 - deficient embryos than dkk1 + we focused on dntcf3 + .
to examine interactions between wnt and bmp signaling in the arches we used an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated smad1 / 5 / 8 ( psmad1 / 5 / 8 ) in dntcf3 + embryos .
in controls psmad1 / 5 / 8 localized to ventral arches 1 and 2 where levels of bmp signaling have been shown to be highest at 24 hpf ( fig. 5a - c ; [ 19 ]) .
anti - psmad1 / 5 / 8 staining was slightly reduced in the first arch at 2 hphs ( 24 - 26 hpf ) in dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 5d ) , in both arches by 4 hphs ( fig. 5e ) , and virtually lost altogether at 6 hphs ( fig. 5f ) .
western blots confirmed that psmad1 / 5 / 8 levels were much lower than controls at 6 hphs ( fig. 5g , h ) .
to examine potential interactions between wnt and edn1 signaling in the arches we performed qpcr for edn1 in dntcf3 + embryos at 6 hphs .
edn1 expression was significantly reduced relative to control ( fig. 5i ) .
these results reveal an indirect role for wnts in d - v patterning through regulation of both bmp and edn1 signaling .

exogenous bmp or edn1 proteins partially rescue ventral patterning in wnt - deficient arches bmps act together with edn1 to promote ventral - intermediate cell fates in the arches [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 58 ] .
therefore we examined the ability of bmp and edn1 to restore ventral - intermediate gene expression in wnt signaling - deficient embryos .
beads coated in human recombinant bmp4 / 7 heterodimers effectively induce bmp target genes in zebrafish pharyngeal arches [ 19 ] .
similarly , microinjection of a 25 ng / nl bmp4 / 7 solution extracellularly on one side of the head induced bmp signaling , as measured by expression of the transgenic bmp - response element reporter ( bre : gfp ; [ 19 ]) at 8 hours post injection ( hpi ) ( fig. 6a , b ) .
unilateral injections of bmp4 / 7 protein into dntcf3 + embryos at 4 hphs partially rescued cartilage defects on the injected side ( fig. 6c - j ) .
typically this restored mc length and ch , but not the mc - pq joint , and rescue was dose - dependent ( fig. 6c , d ) .
these results suggest that wnt signaling acts upstream of , or possibly in parallel to , bmp signaling to promote ventral cartilage cell fates in the arches .
edn1 protein injections have previously been shown to rescue an edn1 mutant phenotype and partially rescue a bmp loss of function phenotype [ 16 ] , [ 19 ] .
edn1 injections into dntcf3 + embryos also partially rescued mc length , but notably were more proficient at rescuing ch and joint development ( fig. 6c - d , l ) .

while both bmp and edn1 signaling induce many of the same genes that specify ventral - intermediate nc cell fates in the early arches , by later stages bmps become much stronger inducers of hand2 ( ventral ) and msxe ( ventral - intermediate ) [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
strikingly , neither bmp4 / 7 nor edn1 protein injections at 4 hphs were sufficient to rescue hand2 expression in dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 7a - d , q ) .
bmp4 / 7 but not edn1 restored msxe expression ( fig. 7e - h ) , particularly in the mandibular arch near the injection site ( fig. 7g ) .
in contrast , both bmp4 / 7 and edn1 injections restored dlx3b and dlx5a expression in the intermediate domain ( fig. 7i - p , q ) .
these results suggest that hand2 expression absolutely requires wnt signaling to respond to bmps , while other signals can partially substitute for wnts in induction of more intermediate - dorsal nc cell fates .

wnt signaling regulates expression of bmp receptors to further investigate how wnts might regulate the ability of nc cells to respond to bmp signaling , we examined whether or not dntcf3 + embryos show any changes in expression of bmp receptors .
zebrafish have four type 1 receptors ( bmpr1aa , ab , ba , bb ) and two type ii receptors ( bmpr2a and b ) .
whole mount ish for all six receptors revealed that only bmpr1ab , bmpr1ba , and bmpr1bb are expressed strongly in the arches at 24 hpf ( fig. s9c - f , i - j , m - r ) .
bmpr1aa , bmpr2a , and bmpr2b were detected much more broadly throughout the embryo at this stage ( fig. s9a - b , g - h , k - l ) .
bmpr1ab expression extended throughout arches 1 and 2 , while bmpr1ba and bmpr1bb expression was restricted to more intermediate and ventral domains ( fig. s9m - o ) .
transverse sections additionally showed that bmpr1ab and bmpr1ba expression is limited to arch nc cells and not surrounding epithelia ( fig. s9p - r ) .
in dntcf3 + embryos bmpr1ab was severely reduced ( 57 % n = 35 ) ( fig. 8a - b , g ) , while bmpr1ba was slightly reduced ( bmpr1ab : 46 % n = 57 ) and bmpr1bb expression was largely unaffected ( bmpr1bb : 31 % n = 29 ) ( fig. 8c - f , g ) .

changes in bmp receptor expression in dntcf3 + embryos were further quantified by qpcr analysis .
at 6 hphs we compared the relative expression of arch specific bmp receptors ( bmpr1ab , bmpr1ba , bmpr1bb ) with ubiquitously expressed bmpr2a and tgfbr1a , a tgf - b receptor expressed in the arches unrelated to bmp signaling [ 59 ] .
there was no detectable reduction in tgfbr1a or bmpr2a expression in dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 8h ) .
at 6 hphs , both bmpr1ab and bmpr1ba expression were reduced ( fig. 8i ) but bmpr1bb expression showed no difference from controls ( fig. 8h ) .
a time series analysis revealed no change in bmpr1ab and bmpr1ba expression at 2 hphs , despite reduced wnt signaling ( see fig. 1 ) , but levels dropped dramatically by 4 hphs .
bmpr1ba but not bmpr1ab expression recovered substantially by 8 hphs .
this suggests differential requirements for wnt signaling in induction of bmp receptors .
dkk1b functions in the pharyngeal endoderm dkk1 + embryos exhibit a unique clefting of the mandible not seen with dntcf3 + .
although primarily known as a repressor of wnt signaling , dkk1 has also been reported to positively regulate the wnt - pcp pathway [ 60 ] .
to gain further insights into its tissue - specific functions , we examined dkk1b expression in pharyngeal arch primordia. of the five known dkk genes in zebrafish , only dkk1b is expressed in the embryonic arches [ 61 ] .
we found that between 28 - 48 hpf dkk1b expression localized to the pharyngeal endoderm , particularly the pouches between arches ( fig. s10a - c ) .
consistent with this , expression was lost in van gogh ( vgo ) mutants , which lack pouches [ 10 ] ( fig. s10d - e ) .
dkk1b expression was also detected in the stomodeum ( oral ectoderm ) at 28 hpf ( fig. s10a ) and later in the ectoderm of the mouth at 48 hpf ( fig. s10f ) .
signals from the pharyngeal endoderm and oral ectoderm are necessary for craniofacial patterning and chondrogenesis [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] .
to determine if there were gross defects in these epithelial layers in dntcf embryos , we examined nkx2.3 , and found that its expression in the pharyngeal endoderm was disorganized in the first two pouches ( fig. s11b,f ) and severely reduced in the more posterior pouches ( fig. s11b ) .
in contrast , anterior pouches appeared unaffected in dkk1 + embryos , while the more posterior pouches were occasionally disorganized ( fig. s11d,h ) .
expression of pitx2ca in the oral ectoderm ( fig. s11i - r ) was delayed in dkk1 + embryos until 26 hphs ( fig. s11o ) , by 30 hphs the mouth opening was abnormally elongated laterally and by 51 hphs showed a ventral midline fold ( fig.s11p - r ) .
thus pharyngeal pouch and mouth defects differ between dntcf and dkk1 embryos , which could account for some of the differences in their effects on growth and morphogenesis of the lower jaw .
discussion we show that wnt signaling promotes proliferation and provides ventral - intermediate patterning cues to nc cells in the pharyngeal arches by participating in a regulatory network with edn1 and bmp ( fig. 9 ). by overexpressing dkk1 or dntcf3 to disrupt wnt signaling , we show that wnt promotes expression of ventral ( hand2 ) and ventral - intermediate genes ( dlx3b , dlx5a , msxe ) and their corresponding skeletal derivatives , and acts upstream or in parallel to the ventralizing activities of edn1 and bmp .
unlike edn1 and bmp , however , our chimeric analyses suggest that direct responses to wnt signaling occur in the pharyngeal endoderm , which also expresses dkk1 .
this endoderm must secondarily produce as yet unknown signals important for d - v patterning , which regulate the competence of nc cells to respond to bmp signaling , in part by transcriptionally regulating bmp receptors .
overexpression of dkk1 also causes a unique midline clefting of the mandible , which we suggest reflects a role in formation of the mouth .

each arch is subdivided into ventral ( blue ) , intermediate ( dark green ) , and dorsal ( light green ) domains , which correspond to eventual dorsal - intermediate - ventral cartilage identities .

the yellow arrow indicates an unknown ventralizing signal x from the endoderm induced in response to wnt .
( b ) diagrams illustrating regulation of bmp receptor expression along the d - v axis at 24 hpf ( colored diagonal bars ) by wnt , bmp and edn1 .
wnt - mediated patterning and growth in craniofacial development direct wnt responses in the ventral first and second arches resemble the pattern of top : gal expression in mice , including distal ( ventral ) arch 1 [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
mycn , a direct transcriptional wnt target , is also expressed in both fish and mouse arch nc cells , where it is likely to inhibit wnt - beta - catenin signaling [ 62 ] , and provide negative feedback .
murine mycn is expressed in highly proliferative cells and mutants show hypoplasia of the mandibular arch [ 63 ] , [ 64 ] .
similarly , we find reduced proliferation in the pharyngeal arches in wnt - deficient zebrafish and smaller craniofacial cartilages ( fig. 3 ; fig. s5 ) .
thus , wnt signaling may promote growth of the ventral arches through induction of mycn expression .
we show a critical requirement for wnt signaling in arch growth and patterning that is distinct from its earlier roles in nc induction and migration .
earlier heat shocks of dntcf3 or dkk1 zebrafish ( 10 - 20 hpf ) disrupt premigratory nc formation [ 41 ] , [ 65 ] similar to wnt1 / wnt3a mutant mice [ 43 ] .
unlike recent conditional loss - and gain - of - function studies of betacat in the pharyngeal ectoderm in mice [ 44 ] , we find no changes in cell survival in the arches in dntcf3 + embryos .
d - v defects in gene expression in the arches caused by overexpressing dntcf3 or dkk1 at these later stages point to a problem with canonical wnt signaling .
both reduce expression of canonical wnt target genes up to 8 hphs ( fig. 1i ; fig. s1 ) , and both lead to ventral cartilage and joint defects .
however , dkk1 overexpression has more subtle effects ( restricted primarily to mc and the jaw joint ) than dntcf3 .
defects in dkk1 + embryos are also stronger when heat shocked at slightly earlier stages ( 15 - 22 hpf ) , than dntcf3 + ( 22 - 24 hpf ) .
these differences may reflect distinct functions for the two transgenes , or a delay due to the time required for dkk1 to competitively bind with the lrp5 / 6 co - receptor , whereas tcf3 directly binds betacat and wnt target genes .
heat shocking dntcf3 or dkk1 at earlier stages eliminates cartilage , consistent with requirements for canonical wnt signaling in nc induction .
both mycn and axin2 expression recover by 24 hphs in heat shocked embryos indicating a transient requirement for canonical wnt signaling prior to skeletal cell differentiation .
wnt and the d - v signaling network in pharyngeal arch development bmps and edn1 secreted by the pharyngeal ectoderm both promote ventral - intermediate skeletal cell fates in the arches [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] and our results implicate wnt as an additional ventralizing factor .
overexpression of dntcf3 leads to reduced hand2 , dlx3b , and dlx5a ventrally and expansion of dorsal jag1b expression ( fig. 4 ) , and similar but less severe changes in gene expression result from dkk1 overexpression .
loss of the positive wnt regulator , r - spondin , in mice also disrupts expression of hand2 , dlx5 , dlx6 , and msxe [ 66 ] , suggesting a conserved requirement for wnt signaling in promoting ventral - intermediate cell fates .
how are these different ventralizing signals integrated during d - v arch patterning ?
wnts can either activate or inhibit bmp signaling in different developmental contexts [ 67 ] - [ 71 ] .
psmad1 / 5 / 8 expression is reduced in the pharyngeal arches of dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 5 ) , suggesting a novel role for wnts upstream of bmp signaling during arch development .
consistent with this model , microinjection of bmp4 / 7 protein directly into the arch primordia at 4 hphs rescues ventral cartilages ( mc , ch ) in dntcf3 + embryos , but not joint fusions ( fig. 6c , f ) .
similar injections of bmp4 / 7 protein into edn1 - / - mutant zebrafish rescues ventral cartilages but not joint fusions , while ectopic edn1 can rescue joint defects caused by a loss of bmp [ 19 ] .
we show that injection of edn1 protein rescues joint fusions in wnt deficient embryos ( fig. 6d,l ) .
wnts also induce edn1 expression in the pharyngeal ectoderm [ 66 ] .
taken together , these results suggest that wnt signaling influences ventral cell fates in the arches through both bmps and edn1 , and joint patterning specifically through edn1 .
another clue to specificity in the d - v arch patterning system comes from the fact that msxe expression ( a direct bmp target and marker of more intermediate identities ) is induced by bmp4 / 7 in edn1 - / - mutants [ 20 ] , and by edn1 protein in the absence of bmp signaling [ 19 ] .
surprisingly , however , msxe expression in dntcf3 + embryos is only rescued by bmp4 / 7 , and not edn1 , while dlx3b and dlx5a expression is rescued in both .
this suggests that edn1 can only induce msxe expression in the arches in the presence of wnt signaling .
thus wnt controls the competence for arch cells to respond to edn1 in addition to inducing expression of edn1 itself .
mice mutant in the essential wnt receptor co - factor , lrp6 , also lack expression of msx1 and msx2 , in the arches [ 72 ] , possibly as a result of defects in bmp signaling .
neither bmp4 / 7 nor edn1 overexpression rescues hand2 expression in dntcf3 + embryos , revealing a critical requirement for wnt in induction of hand2 [ 17 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 73 ] - [ 75 ] .
both bmp and edn1 induce hand2 expression and specify the ventral arch domain initially , but later bmps maintain hand2 in the ventral domain while edn1 promotes expression of more ventral - intermediate genes .
we pinpoint a critical period for wnt signaling in d - v patterning between 24 - 30 hpf , when hand2 expression is unresponsive to edn1 .
our results suggest that bmp signaling requires wnt signaling to induce hand2 expression in the arches .
consistent with this model , wnt signaling directly regulates hand2 transcription in chondrocytes [ 76 ] .
failure of hand2 induction is not simply due to loss of cells , since ventral nc cells are still present in the arches of dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 4n - o ; fig. s7 ) .
bmp protein can also induce hand2 throughout the d - v extent of the arch [ 20 ] .
our results suggest that wnt signaling plays a critical role in regulating the competence of cells to respond to bmps and to express hand2 .
we propose that wnt signaling activates a signal ( factor x ) from the pharyngeal endoderm that primes the ability of nc cells to respond to bmp signaling , in part through the transcriptional regulation of bmp receptors ( fig. 9 ) .
similarly in d - v patterning of the mouse limb wnt signaling is thought to act upstream of bmpr1a [ 71 ] .
three type i bmp receptors , bmpr1ab , bmpr1ba , bmpr1bb , have arch - specific expression in zebrafish , similar to mice [ 77 ] .
these are expressed in nested patterns within the arches : bmpr1ab throughout and bmpr1ba / bb only in intermediate - ventral domains .
thus bmpr1 receptors may have distinct roles in different spatial domains ( in addition to their cell - type specific roles [ 78 ] , [ 79 ]) , but this has been difficult to test due to early lethality in traditional bmpr knockouts [ 80 ] , [ 81 ] .
we show that overexpression of dntcf3 + inhibits bmpr1ab and bmpr1ba , but not bmpr1bb and bmpr2a , expression in the arches .
this reduction in bmpr expression occurs later than most direct wnt targets ( fig. 8i ; 4 - 8 hphs ) suggesting that it is indirect , consistent with our model that wnt activates an unknown signal from the endoderm important in this process .
bmpr1ba expression also recovers by 8 hphs , before bmpr1ab expression and within the period during which wnt signaling is significantly reduced ( fig. 1i ) indicating that bmpr1ab is particularly sensitive .
this could help explain the inability of bmp protein to rescue hand2 expression in dntcf3 + embryos if bmpr1ab plays a specific role in hand2 induction .
in contrast , intermediate - ventral genes such as msxe and dlx3b , may be rescued by bmp protein because other bmp receptors are sufficient for their induction .
such distinct transcriptional roles for bmp receptors could help fine - tune d - v domains within an arch despite the relatively broad expression of bmp ligands .
distinct roles for wnt signaling in pharyngeal endodermal development both dntcf3 + and dkk1 + embryos appear to function in the pharyngeal endoderm , which is an important signaling center in craniofacial development [ 7 ] , [ 9 ] .
our chimeric analyses demonstrate a cell autonomous requirement for dntcf3 in endoderm ( fig. s2 ) and dkk1 expression is restricted to this epithelium .
interestingly , we do not detect dkk1 expression in the first pharyngeal pouch , which lies between arches 1 and 2 ( fig. s10 ) .
this could help explain why wnt signaling only appears to be required for d - v patterning in these arches ; the more posterior ceratobranchials ( arches 3 - 7 ) are largely unaffected in heterozygous dkk1 + and dntcf3 + embryos ( fig. 2b,f ) .
these results suggest a previously unrecognized role for wnts and wnt antagonists in endoderm and the existence of an as yet unknown factor x produced by endoderm that is important in d - v patterning of the nc ( see fig. 9 ) .
the distinct and highly penetrant clefting of the mandible observed in dkk1 + embryos is never observed in dntcf3 + embryos .
disruption of the canonical wnt pathway can cause clefting of the palate in mice [ 36 ] , [ 46 ] , [ 67 ] , but such midline clefts in the lower jaw are rare .
midline facial defects , particularly of the frontonasal process , have been reported in wnt signaling mutants in mice [ 36 ] , [ 66 ] , [ 67 ] .
mice mutant for dlx5 / 6 have cleft mandibles and wnt9b mutants have cleft lip [ 82 ] , [ 83 ] .
humans with richieri - costa - perieira syndrome also exhibit clefting of the lower jaw similar to what we describe in dkk1 + embryos [ 68 ] , [ 84 ] .
dkk1 not only inhibits canonical wnt signaling [ 52 ] but can also activate the non - canonical wnt - pcp pathway during zebrafish gastrulation [ 60 ] .
non - canonical wnt signaling has also been implicated in craniofacial midline development as wnt5a mutant mice have clefting of the secondary palate [ 66 ] .
thus , overexpression of dkk1 may lead to both a canonical wnt / betacat loss - of - function and a non - canonical wnt - pcp gain - of - function to cause lower jaw clefting .
overexpression of dkk1 also leads to elongation and ventral clefting of the mouth , which is not observed in dntcf3 + embryos .
both loss - and gain - of - function mutations in mammalian dkk1 result in midline clefts in the frontonasal and maxillary prominences [ 36 ] .
nc cells fated to form the lower jaw lie adjacent to the oral ectoderm ( stomodeum ) , which secretes important skeletogenic signals such as shh [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] and bmps [ 19 ] .
dkk1b transcripts are normally restricted to the anterior ectoderm of the mouth opening ( fig. s10f ) where both fgf8 ( distal ) and shh ( medial ) are expressed .
thus , misexpressing dkk1b throughout the oral ectoderm may disrupt one of these other signals .
future experiments are needed to determine the roles of wnt signaling in mouth development and the causes of mandibular clefts .

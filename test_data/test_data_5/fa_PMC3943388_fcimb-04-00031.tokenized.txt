cell death or senescence is a fundamental event that helps maintain cellular homeostasis , shapes the growth of organism , and provides protective immunity against invading pathogens .
decreased or increased cell death is detrimental both in infectious and non - infectious diseases .
cell death is executed both by regulated enzymic reactions and non - enzymic sudden collapse .
in this brief review we have tried to summarize various cell death modalities and their impact on the pathogenesis of mycobacterium tuberculosis .
apoptosis pyroptosis intrinsic pathway extrinsic pathway autophagy mycobacterium tuberculosis introduction cell death is a primordial event in embryogenesis , metamorphosis , and in innate immune response against the invading pathogens .
cell death as a defense mechanism is also documented in the plant kingdom ( kabbage et al. , 2013 ) .
cell death is executed in a series of ordered biochemical cascades and is referred as programmed cell death or pcd .
till early 2000 , cell death was discussed as dichotomy in terms of either apoptosis or necrosis .
however , with the growth of science many distinct modes of cell death with well - organized signaling cascades were unraveled .
currently , there exists nine different forms of cell death namely apoptosis ( fink and cookson , 2005 ) , autophagy ( fink and cookson , 2005 ) , mitoptosis ( chaabane et al. , 2012 ) , necrosis ( fink and cookson , 2005 ) , necroptosis ( galluzzi and kroemer , 2008 ) , netosis ( remijsen et al. , 2011 ) , oncosis ( fink and cookson , 2005 ) , pyroptosis ( fink and cookson , 2005 ) , and pyronecrosis ( willingham et al. , 2007 ) .
it is still a puzzle whether these pathways are different features of the same response or physiologically distinct responses .
apoptosis as an defense mechanism initiates both innate and adaptive immunity ( behar et al. , 2010 ) .
however , pathogenic organisms have developed mechanisms to modulate apoptosis for their survival .
apoptosis of the infected cells have been reported to be a favorable outcome for the dissemination of infections like yersinia , francisella , etc .
( ruckdeschel et al. , 1997 ; wickstrum et al. , 2009 ) .
on the contrary , impairment of apoptosis provides a survival niche to many intracellular pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis ( behar et al. , 2010 ) , leads to auto immunity , cancer and degenerative disorders ( elmore , 2007 ) .
studies in m. tuberculosis have identified a causal relationship between virulence of the strain and induction of apoptosis .
inhibition of apoptosis favors m. tuberculosis survival in many ways like preventing bactericidal effects , t - cell priming , etc .
( velmurugan et al. , 2007 ) .
in contrast , a recent report states that apoptosis inducing strains could disseminate m. tuberculosis infection ( aguilo et al. , 2013 ) .
necrotic cell death of burdened m. tuberculosis infected cells was shown to pave way for re - infection ( butler et al. , 2012 ) .
in here , we summarize various apoptotic modalities and their role in the pathogenesis of m. tuberculosis .
furthermore , we share our experience in analyzing these responses in m. tuberculosis infection .
models of cell death apoptosis first represented in the article by kerr , wyllie , and currie in 1972 ( elmore , 2007 ) .
apoptosis is an energy dependent regulatory process that disintegrates the dying cell by enclosing the cytoplasmic contents inside membrane bound vesicles called apoptotic bodies .
these apoptotic bodies are engulfed by the phagocytic cells by a process called efferocytosis thereby efficiently clearing the dying cell without any inflammatory responses ( lee et al. , 2009 ) .
three pathways namely extrinsic / ligand - mediated pathway , intrinsic / mitochondrial pathway , and the granzyme b - mediated pathway regulate the process of apoptosis upon activation by physiological or pathological conditions ( elmore , 2007 ) .
the major players in apoptosis are caspases , adaptor proteins , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) receptor ( tnf - r ) super family , and bcl - 2 family of proteins ( strasser et al. , 2000 ) .
there are three categories of caspases ; initiators ( caspase - 2 , - 8 , - 9 , - 10 ) , effectors or executioners ( caspase - 3 , - 6 , - 7 ) , and inflammatory caspases ( caspase - 1 , - 4 , - 5 ) ( elmore , 2007 ) .
caspase - activated dnases activate endonuclease that produce the typical internucleosomal dna cleavage during apoptosis ( strasser et al. , 2000 ) .
adapter proteins play a major role in apoptosis as a link between caspases and the tnf - r by mediating homotypic interactions between the domains death domain , the death effector domain , and the caspase recruitment domains ( strasser et al. , 2000 ) .
bcl - 2 family of proteins are classified into three types that fall into pro - survival and pro - apoptotic categories based on the amino acid sequence homology to bcl - 2 homology regions bh1 - bh4 .
pro - survival bcl - xl , bcl - w , a1 / bfl - 1 , mcl - 1 , and boo / diva have three or four bcl - 2 homology regions while the pro - apoptotic members called bax - like death factors bax , bcl - xs , bak , and bok / mtd contain two or three homology regions ( pecina - slaus , 2010 ) .
the third group of proteins bad , bik / nbk , bid , hrk / dp5 , bim / bod , and blk , etc. that possess only a bh3 region are potent inducers of apoptosis ( strasser et al. , 2000 ) .
apoptotic pathways extrinsic pathway is initiated by binding of the ligands like tnf - alpha , fasl , cd95l , trail , etc .
to their respective receptors tnfr , fas / cd95 , and dr3 on the cell surface .
this activates the initiator caspases such as caspases 8 and 10 that results in the formation and activation of death inducing signaling complex ( disc ) that activates caspase 3 ( pecina - slaus , 2010 ; kalimuthu and se - kwon , 2013 ) .
caspase 3 activation leads to cleavage of various death substrates that results in the characteristic hallmarks of apoptosis like dna fragmentation , membrane blebbing , etc .
( kalimuthu and se - kwon , 2013 ) .
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is trigged due to the intracellular death signals .
mitochondrial enzyme endonuclease g , bcl - 2 family of proteins like bax , bid , and other mitochondrial proteins aif , diablo [ smac ( second mitochondria - derived activator of caspases )] , and cytochrome c plays a major role in this response ( kalimuthu and se - kwon , 2013 ) .
upon the stimulus , the bh3 - only protein bid activates bax and bak that results in conformational change and oligomerization , forming an oligomeric pore in the outer mitochondrial membrane called permeability transition pores ( ferri and kroemer , 2001 ; kalimuthu and se - kwon , 2013 ) .
this results in the release of cytochrome c and other pro - apoptotic factors from the mitochondria into the cytosol .
cytochrome c interacts with apaf and activates caspase - 9 forming a multi - protein subunit complex called casposome ( apoptosome ) comprising cytochrome c , apaf - 1 , procaspase - 9 , and atp .
in the absence of death stimulus , inhibitor of apoptosis family proteins ( iap ) inactivates the caspase activity by direct binding .
however , upon apoptotic stimuli iaps are negatively regulated by smac and that leads to the activation of caspase - 3 ( pecina - slaus , 2010 ; kalimuthu and se - kwon , 2013 ) .
furthermore , extrinsic pathway was found to influence the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by truncation of bid ( cillessen et al. , 2007 ) .
granzyme b - mediated pathway utilizing the extrinsic mode of apoptosis is used by cytotoxic t lymphocytes as a mechanism to kill its target .
besides this , the secretion of pore forming granules containing serine proteases granzyme a and granzyme b also execute apoptosis that is both dependent and independent of caspase activation ( elmore , 2007 ) .
autophagy it is a regulated homeostatic response conserved in all living cells degrading their own cytoplasm .
autophagy is a predominant cell survival response that is involved either in nutrient turnover or energy production during stress or removal of long lived cells or to protect against invading intracellular pathogens ( chaabane et al. , 2012 ) .
three forms of autophagy namely macroautophagy , microautophagy , and chaperone - mediated autophagy exist .
during the autophagy , damaged organelle is lined with an isolation membrane called the phagophore that enlarges forming the double membrane structure called autophagosome .
the autophagosome fuses either with late endosomes or lysosomes causing cell death ( levine and deretic , 2007 ; remijsen et al. , 2011 ) .
autophagy is regulated by autophagy - related proteins , serine / threonine kinase , mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , class i and class iii phosphoinositide 3 - kinases ( pi3ks ) ( levine and deretic , 2007 ; su et al. , 2013 ) .
mitoptosis apoptotic changes inside the mitochondria are called mitoptosis .
mitoptosis is still in infancy and no specific factors have been identified .
the identification is based on morphological changes like disintegrating cristae , swollen mitochondria , etc .
( chaabane et al. , 2012 ) .
necrosis accidental cell death induced due to pathological or physiological conditions are called necrosis .
during necrosis , swelling of organelles like endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria occurs thereby rupturing the plasma membrane .
this leaks the intracellular contents of the necrotic cell into the intercellular space causing inflammatory responses ( fink and cookson , 2005 ; chaabane et al. , 2012 ) .
necroptosis in the year 2008 , hitomi et al. reported that necrosis could be a regulated process of cell death .
the activation of serine / threonine kinase rip1 , bh3 only protein bmf , and mitochondrial dysfunction executes necroptosis ( galluzzi and kroemer , 2008 ) .
netosis in 2004 , the findings of brinkman group unveiled another cell death program named by steinberg in 2007 called netosis ( mesa and vasquez , 2013 ) .
one among the defense mechanisms used by neutrophils is the extrusion of intracellular material in the form of extracellular traps ( ets ) to the surrounding extracellular medium .
this concentrates the microbicidal substances to trap and kill pathogens ( mesa and vasquez , 2013 ) .
release of ets by neutrophils is called nets and mast cells as mcets .
nets are composed of dna and histones , and they are resistant to degradation by proteases , insensitive to caspase inhibition and necrostatins ( cytoprotective agents ) ( mesa and vasquez , 2013 ) .
during netosis both the nuclear and granular membranes disintegrate leaving the plasma membrane intact ( remijsen et al. , 2011 ) .
netosis is activated by pathogens , platelets activated with lps and in eosinophils ( remijsen et al. , 2011 ) .
formation of net is both nuclear and mitochondrial in origin .
oncosis it is the swelling of cells that involves rapid plasma membrane breakdown , and swollen nuclei without internucleosomal dna fragmentation .
oncosis depletes cellular energy and leads to failure of the ionic pumps in the plasma membrane .
it is elicited by agents that disrupt the atp production of the cell ( fink and cookson , 2005 ) .
pyroptosis apoptosis in general does not induce an inflammatory response .
however , apoptosis in shigella , salmonella , francisella , and legionella infections produce inflammatory responses that are called as pyroptosis ( carneiro et al. , 2009 ; lee et al. , 2011 ) .
pyroptosis is executed by the formation of inflammasomes by bacterial products involving nlrc 4 ( nod - like receptor - - nlr ) , that activates caspase - 1 and the processing of il - 1beta and il - 18 cytokines promoting cell death ( fink and cookson , 2005 ; carneiro et al. , 2009 ) .
pyronecrosis cathepsin b - dependent apoptosis that is independent of caspase - 1 activation and inflammasome formation is called pyronecrosis .
this mode of apoptosis is observed in shigellosis ( willingham et al. , 2007 ; carneiro et al. , 2009 ) .
other apoptotic models tumor suppressor protein 53 ( tp53 ) induced apoptosis involves the transcriptional induction of redox proteins , generation of reactive oxygen species , and oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components that results in cell death .
tp53 was shown to transcriptionally regulate proapoptotic proteins like bax and noxa ( yamada et al. , 2002 ) .
nf - kb expression is implicated in the survival of living cells .
nf - kb family contains five proteins namely c - rel , rela , relb , p50 / p105 , and p52 / p100 .
nf - kb as a homo or hetero dimers bind to the kb sites on their target dna and regulate their expression ( barkett and gilmore , 1999 ) .
nf - kb is activated by various stimuli like pathogens , mitogens , proinflammatory cytokines , etc .
it plays a major role in immune responses and affects the expression of genes c - iap - 1 and c - iap - 2 , fas ligand , c - myc , p53 , etc .
involved in apoptosis ( zhang and ghosh , 2001 ) .
two tnf receptors tnfrsf8 and tnfrsf9 were shown to promote apoptosis , former activating , and latter inactivating nf - kb expression ( wang et al. , 2008 ) .
apoptosis and mycobacterium tuberculosis m. tuberculosis infections with virulent strains have been reported to inhibit macrophage apoptosis ( behar et al. , 2010 ) .
varied mechanisms of apoptotic suppression have been reported in m. tuberculosis infections ( table 1 ) unraveling the tactics of this pathogen to generate a protective niche inside the host .
among the various cell death modalities described above , only three apoptotic responses were documented in m. tuberculosis infection namely apoptosis ( nuog , seca2 , pkne , lpqh , esxa ( esat - 6 ) , pe _ pgrs33 , psts - 1 , rv3654c , and rv3655c ) , pyroptosis ( zmp1 , rv3364c ) , and autophagy ( eis ) ( hinchey et al. , 2007 ; velmurugan et al. , 2007 ; jayakumar et al. , 2008 ; master et al. , 2008 ; sanchez et al. , 2009 , 2012 ; danelishvili et al. , 2010 , 2012 ; shin et al. , 2010 ) .

the abbreviations moi denote multiplicity of infection , manlam , mannosylated lipoarabinomannan ; pge2 , prostaglandine2 ; ros , reactive oxygen species ; atp , adenosine tri phosphate .
serine / threonine protein kinases ( stpk ) two component signaling systems were considered as the standalone mechanism of signaling in prokaryotes in response to environmental cues .
however with the availability of various molecular techniques serine , threonine , and tyrosine mediated phosphorylation events unique to eukaryotes were documented in pathogenic prokaryotes like m. tuberculosis , streptococcus species , staphylococcus spp , pseudomonas spp , etc .
( chao et al. , 2009 ; chakraborti et al. , 2011 ) .
among the 11 stpks that m. tuberculosis encodes , only five of them pkne , pkng , pknh , pkni , and pknk were reported to support intracellular survival ( walburger et al. , 2004 ; papavinasasundaram et al. , 2005 ; jayakumar et al. , 2008 ; gopalaswamy et al. , 2009 ; malhotra et al. , 2010 ) .
our data for the first time proved that pkne was the only stpk to inhibit apoptosis ( jayakumar et al. , 2008 ) .
pkne in innate immunity the function of pkne was established from our studies using the deletion mutant deltapkne generated using specialized transduction .
deletion of pkne had reduced intracellular survival , increased apoptosis , and reduced proinflammatory responses ( jayakumar et al. , 2008 ) .
subsequent molecular pathogenesis studies revealed that the deletion of pkne promotes macrophage cell death dependent on intrinsic pathway of apoptosis , tp53 , and arg2 .
this apoptosis was independent of tnf - alpha , inos , akt , arg1 , and pro - inflammatory cytokines ( kumar and narayanan , 2012 ). m. tuberculosis encounters reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates inside the macrophages as one among the host defenses .
characterization of the promoter of the pkne gene showed its elevated expression during nitric oxide ( no ) stress ( jayakumar et al. , 2008 ) .
macrophage experiments performed using no donor sodium nitroprusside to mimic the host microbicidal activity confirmed that , pkne in response to no stress suppresses innate immune responses ( kumar and narayanan , 2012 ) .
in vitro studies carried with the deletion mutant showed defective growth in ph 7.0 and lysozyme ( a cell wall - damaging agent ) with better survival in ph 5.5 , sds ( surfactant stress ) , and kanamycin ( a second - line anti - tuberculosis drug ) .
deltapkne was reduced in cell size during growth in liquid media and exhibited hypervirulence in a guinea pig model of infection ( kumar et al. , 2012 ) .
the data from the in vitro studies highlighted the role of pkne in adaptive responses of m. tuberculosis .
recently we reported that , deletion of pkne results in defective phosphorylation kinetics of mapks ( p38mapk , erk ( 1 / 2 ) , and sapk / jnk ) and their transcription factors atf - 2 and c - jun .
deletion of pkne also revealed crosstalks in the host macrophages where erk ( 1 / 2 ) signaling was found to be influenced by sapk / jnk and p38 pathways independently .
modulations in intra cellular signaling altered the expression of coreceptors ccr5 and cxcr4 in macrophages infected with the deletion mutant of pkne that were authenticated using hiv tropic strains ( parandhaman et al. , 2014 ) .
for the first time , our data showed that difference in apoptosis and intracellular signaling events , and the virulence capacity of the m. tuberculosis strain could influence the copathogenesis of hiv infection ( parandhaman et al. , 2014 ) .
collectively the reports show that pkne has a role suppression of innate immunity and help m. tuberculosis to adapt to the different environmental condition that it encounters .
conclusion molecular techniques have revolutionized our understanding of pathogenic organisms and their interactions with the immune system .
pathogenic organisms have evolved host mimicking properties and utilize the host responses for their own survival and propagation .
this review has addressed the various mechanisms of cell death that is vital for initiating an innate and adaptive immunity against the invading pathogen .
as novel cell death paradigms evolve , it adds to the complexity of how temporally and spatially the immune system coordinates these responses .
most of the cell death models described here disrupt the energy source of the cell , mitochondria indicating whether these paradigms are interconnected response of a single biochemical event and this still remains a puzzle .
adding complexity to this conundrum is that , pathogenic organisms like m. tuberculosis is able to inhibit the various apoptotic models that were discovered so far .
this arise the question whether m. tuberculosis by educating itself avoids cell death or has antigens that are poor inducers of cell death and that await further studies .
conflict of interest statement the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .

abstract cerium oxide nanocrystals ( ceo2 - ncs ) exhibit superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic activities .
based on these catalytic activities , ceo2 - ncs have been suggested to have the potential to treat various diseases .
the crystalline size of these materials is an important factor that influences the performance of ceo2 - ncs .
previous reports have shown that several metal - based nanocrystals , including ceo2 - ncs , can induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells .
however , the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear .
to characterize the anticancer activities of ceo2 - ncs , several assays related to the mechanism of cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis has been performed .
here , we have carried out a systematic study to characterize ceo2 - ncs phase purity ( x - ray diffraction ) , morphology ( electron microscopy ) , and optical features ( optical absorption , raman scattering , and photoluminescence ) to better establish their potential as anticancer drugs .
our study revealed anticancer effects of ceo2 - ncs in ht29 and sw620 colorectal cancer cell lines with half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) values of 2.26 and 121.18 mug ml - 1 , respectively .
reductions in cell viability indicated the cytotoxic potential of ceo2 - ncs in ht29 cells based on inverted and florescence microscopy assessments .
the mechanism of cytotoxicity confirmed by estimating possible changes in the expression levels of bcl2 , bclxl , bax , parp , cytochrome c , and beta - actin ( control ) proteins in ht29 cells .
down - regulation of bcl2 and bclxl and up - regulation of bax , parp , and cytochrome c proteins suggested the significant involvement of ceo2 - ncs exposure in the induction of apoptosis .
furthermore , biocompatibility assay showed minimum effect of ceo2 - ncs on human red blood cells .

introduction nanobiotechnology , a rapidly emerging field of advanced materials science , has expanded the possibility for advances in medical sciences such as gene - delivery systems , targeted drug delivery , and artificial implants [ 1 - 3 ] .
nanotechnology has been widely employed in applications such as cancer control , biomarker discovery , molecular biology , genetic engineering , cell engineering , drug delivery , skin care products , cosmetics , non - viral gene carriers , bio - analytical , clinical , diagnostics , and therapeutic fields [ 4,5 ] .
the invention and development of nanomaterials represents one of the most potent and beneficial achievements that has advanced modern science and technology and allowed for the control of various conditions , including bacterial and fungal infections , as well as various types of cancer [ 6 - 8 ] .
cancer is considered to be one of the most insidious , complex , and heterogeneous diseases that occurs because of changes in the regulation of the proliferation of normal cells [ 9 ] .
colorectal cancer ( crc ) represents a major cause of death in the usa .
in 2016 , approximately 49,190 individuals died as a consequence of crc , while an estimated 95,270 people are diagnosed with the disease in usa [ 10 ] this type of cancer is very common in western countries as one in 21 men and one in 23 women are predicted to develop the disease [ 11 ] .
in this study , to explore the potential effects of cerium oxide nanocrystals ( ceo2 - ncs ) , we selected two crc cell lines , ht29 and sw620 cells , for study .
despite advances in the diagnosis of cancer , the actual rate of treatment of this disease has yet to be markedly reduced .
in crc , normal cells progressively transform into malignant cells through initiation , promotion , and progression phases .
various studies have reported significant toxicity of nanomaterials against several types of cancer [ 12 - 14 ] .
recently , ceo2 - ncs or nanoceria have been shown to exhibit a broad range of potential applications in medical science .
for example , ceo2 - ncs act as potential therapeutic agents against various diseases , including cancer , with the least toxicity towards normal cells and tissues [ 15,16 ] .
ceo2 - ncs have potential catalytic and antioxidant activities that resemble those of catalase and superoxide - dismutase and can act to protect cells from oxidative stress .
however , several reports have demonstrated a protective role for ceo2 - ncs towards oxidant - associated apoptosis [ 17 ] , and many studies have confirmed that ceo2 - ncs can induce oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro [ 18,19 ] .
furthermore , it was reported that ceo2 - ncs can effectively reduce the proliferation of endothelial cells [ 20 ] .
therefore , ceo2 - ncs could potentially be used to control the process of angiogenesis .
the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in cells is generally associated with adverse effects .
ros may promote the growth of tumors as a consequence of the deregulation of ros scavengers and down - regulation of the expression of antioxidant enzymes [ 21 ] .
it has been established that ros are involved in changes in intracellular processes , so they represent a potential risk factor for cellular injury .
it has also been shown that various types of ncs work as effective antioxidants and free radical scavengers .
thus , ceo2 - ncs exhibit antioxidant properties that may counteract the progression of various diseases , including cancer , that are associated with oxygen levels and ros generation [ 22 ] .
several studies that assessed the activity of ceo2 - ncs in cancer showed that ceo2 - ncs have anti - invasive effects against several types of cancer cells [ 23 ] , and also confer radioprotection to normal cells and induce radio - sensitization [ 24 ] by controlling the extent of ros and antioxidant enzyme activities [ 25 ] .
adverse health implications are rarely observed upon exposure to ceo2 - ncs , and such outcomes differ between researchers , e.g. toxic effects on various organs such as the lung and kidney [ 26,27 ] .
recently , high cytotoxic effects of ceo2 - ncs were reported in studies that used ht29 colorectal adenocarcinoma and 518a2 melanoma cell lines , while minimum cytotoxic effects were observed on other cell lines .
although present data on the medical applications of ceo2 - ncs , including in cancer , are promising , conflicting reports exist regarding in vitro cytotoxicity .
moreover , data about the underlying mechanism and potential link to the induction of apoptosis are insufficient .
therefore , more research is required to confirm the mechanism of action of ceo2 - ncs in apoptosis because of the possible cytotoxic effect of these compounds in human colorectal adenocarcinoma .
herein , we present the chemical synthesis and characterization of ceo2 - ncs and evaluate potential cytotoxic effects of ceo2 - ncs on two human colon cancer cell lines .
we also analyzed the potential effects of ceo2 - ncs on the expression levels of bcl2 , bclxl , bax , poly - adp ribose - polymerase ( parp ) and cytochrome c proteins , which all are involved in the apoptotic pathway .
furthermore , we also characterized the biocompatibility of ceo2 - ncs on red blood cells ( rbcs ) .
our findings illustrated that ceo2 - ncs have sufficient cytotoxic potential against ht29 and sw620 cancer cell lines .
we also observed that exposure of ceo2 - ncs to the ht29 cancer cell line altered the normal expression levels of bcl2 , bclxl , bax , parp , and cytochrome c proteins .

3. results and discussion 3.1 .
crystallographic and morphological studies the phase structural and crystalline properties of the prepared product were determined by xrd .
figure s1 shows a powder xrd pattern of sol - gel - prepared ceo2 - ncs .
xrd data showed that ceo2 - ncs were properly crystallized and exhibited patterns that were in accord with a cubic structure .
the main reflection peaks of ceo2 were analyzed for the diffraction pattern , and they corresponded to the ( 111 ) , ( 200 ) , ( 220 ) and ( 311 ) planes [ 32 ] .
the observed reflection peaks could be indexed to the cubic fluorite structure of ceo2 .
no samples illustrated an extra peak that would correspond to any impurity phase of metal salt , which ruled out the formation of a secondary phase .
the intensities and positions of the diffraction plane were well match with the jcpds card no .
( 34 - 0394 ) and previously reported data [ 33 ] .
the broadened peaks confirm the nanocrystalline nature of synthesized ceo2 - ncs in the diffractogram .
the robust peak ( 111 ) at 2theta = 28.4degrees and another peak ( 220 ) at 2theta = 47.17degrees were used to analyze the average crystallite size of ceo2 - ncs , which according to the scherrer equation were found to be ~ 10 - 15 nm. a tem micrograph of ceo2 - ncs was also obtained ( figure s2 ) .
it could be observed that synthesized ceo2 - ncs have an irregular shape and are slightly aggregated with a narrow size distribution .
similarly , marques et al .
[ 34 ] observed that ethylene glycol ( eg ) promoted the aggregation of nucleation seeds or tiny particles on the surface by potential interactions with the hydrogen bonding of h2o and with the polymer - oh groups .
additionally , the average particle size was reduced from 20 to 13 nm , which is consistent with the average particle size attained from the peak broadening in the xrd studies .
3.2 .
optical properties ftir spectroscopy was performed to determine the surface chemistry of the synthesized ceo2 - ncs , as shown in figure s3 .
a strong absorption band between 400 and 500 cm - 1 could represent an adsorption of metal oxygen ( m - o ) stretching band [ 35 ] .
ir broad bands located at 1380 , 1636 , and 3450 cm - 1 could be attributed to the nuo - h symmetrical stretching and bending vibrations of physically absorbed h2o molecules on the ncs surface [ 35 ] .
the kbr pellet technique was used to record ftir spectra using a perkin - elmer 580b ir spectrometer in a range 400 - 4000 cm - 1 .
figure s4 shows the optical absorption spectrum of the ncs suspended in deionized water ( suspensions were diffused in an ultrasonic bath before the absorption spectra were analyzed ) .
an absorption band in the wavelength range of 250 - 450 nm was ascribed to a charge transfer transition from the o2 - ( 2p ) to ce4 + ( 4f ) orbital in ceo2 .
this finding indicates that the charge transfer transition of ce4 + overlaps with the 4f1 - 5d1 transition of ce3 + .
raman - active phonon modes can be used to measure the structural order at a short range in the samples .
figure s5 shows raman spectra of the ' as - synthesized ' ceo2 - ncs in the range of 200 - 700 cm - 1 , which confirms the formation of a cubic fluorite phase .
unpolarized raman scattering accumulated in the backscattering configuration with a 488 nm laser line at room temperature .
the raman active peak could be observed at 455 cm - 1 .
the lattice expansion was used to elucidate systematic changes in the raman peak with decreasing particle size , which coincides with the x - ray findings .
the raman spectrum also is in agreement with that of the pure ceo2 - ncs , as previously reported in the literature [ 36 ] .
the photoluminescence properties of ceo2 - ncs were measured under 325 nm excitation wavelength using a jobin yvon horiba spectrometer at room temperature , as shown in figure s6 .
the ceo2 - ncs exhibited a broad emission band within the 400 - 700 nm spectral range .
it is well known that the emission band of ceria ncs resembles direct emission from the 2d ( 5d1 ) state to the two split 4f1 ground states of 2f5 / 2 and 2f7 / 2 that originate from spin orbit coupling .
3.3 .
evaluation of the anticancer activity of ceo2 - ncs by cytotoxicity assay the potential antitumor activity of ceo2 - ncs was assessed on ht29 and sw620 cell lines using serial dilutions of ceo2 - ncs ( 5 - 640 mug ml - 1 ) with the mtt assay .
the ceo2 - ncs were shown to effectively reduce the viability of ht29 and sw620 cells in a dose - dependent manner , as shown in figures 1 and 2 .
the synthesized ceo2 - ncs showed antitumor effects on ht29 and sw620 cells with a lower concentration of 50 mug ml - 1 .
the viability of ht29 and sw620 cells decreased by 10 % with 50 mug ml - 1 ceo2 - ncs , while at 100 mug ml - 1 the viability of ht29 and sw620 cells was remarkably reduced up to 46 % .
the mechanism of action of ceo2 - ncs remains the subject of some debate .
we used an aqueous environment to prepare ceo2 - ncs , which has large amount of hydroxyl groups on the surface of nanocrystals .
because of these surface hydroxyl groups , ceo2 - ncs are biocompatible and less toxic .
moreover , they may be considered to be eco - friendly and do not pose significant environmental hazards , in contrast to those compounds used for the chemical reduction method [ 37 ] .
the cytotoxic effects of ceo2 - ncs on colon cancer cell lines suggest that ceo2 - ncs can play an important role in the development of drugs against colorectal cancer .
additionally , the results of the mtt assay with various concentrations of positive control doxorubicin ( 0.5 , 1.0 , and 2.0 mum ) , as shown in our recent report , indicated that the control drug had considerable effects on ht29 cells [ 28 ] .
figure 1 .
ht29 cell viability assessed based on the frequency of surviving cells after 48 h exposure to different concentrations of ceo2 nanoparticles by mtt assay .
the ic50 was found to be 2.26 mug ml - 1 .
error bars indicate standard deviation ( n = 3 ) .
figure 2 .
sw620 cell viability assessed based on the frequency of surviving cells after 48 h exposure to different concentrations of ceo2 - ncs by mtt assay .
the ic50 values were found to be 121.18 mug ml - 1 .
error bars indicate standard deviation ( n = 3 ) .
the present study explored the cytotoxic potential of ceo2 - ncs on the ht29 and sw620 human colorectal cancer cell lines .
ceo2 - ncs showed excellent anticancer activity with half maximal inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) value of 2.26 and 121.18 mug ml - 1 against ht29 and sw620 cells , respectively .
our data were in agreement with previously published reports that cell lines required high drug concentrations and / or more incubation times than ht29 cells to achieve cytotoxic effects [ 28 ] .
it had been previously observed that cytotoxicity of different nps in different cancerous cell lines depends upon the concentration of nps used and the exposure time [ 38 ] .
previous studies reported the non - significant toxicity of ceo2 - ncs against different normal epithelial cell lines [ 23 ] .
3.4 .
examination of morphological changes in ht29 cells by microscopy the outcomes of invert microscopy using the ht29 cell line demonstrated a reduction in the numbers of cells in response to various concentrations of ceo2 - ncs .
the control group of untreated cells showed no change in the number of cells or in cell morphology compared with ceo2 - ncs - treated cells by crystal violet staining ( figure 3a - d ) .
treated cells exhibited morphological alterations ( i.e. they became rounded ) , which is a possible sign of apoptosis .
moreover , inhibition of cell growth , loss of membrane integrity , and condensation of the cytoplasm could be detected in ht29 cells treated with ceo2 - ncs when compared with untreated controls .
these findings indicate that ceo2 - ncs induce cell death by inhibiting the proliferation of ht29 cells .
figure 3 .
inverted microscopy results show the potential effect of ceo2 - ncs by crystal violet staining .
( a ) no significant effects were observed on untreated ht29 cells ( control ) .
( b - d ) ht29 cells were treated with different concentrations of ceo2 - ncs .
alterations in morphology and reductions in cell number indicate the activity of ceo2 - ncs .
bars = 10 mum .
3.5 .
mmp assay it is well recognized that the mmp of cells is reduced during apoptosis .
potential differences in the mmp of ceo2 - ncs - treated and - untreated ht29 cells were analyzed by measuring the intensity of fluorescence using a mitochondria - specific rh - 123 dye .
the mmp assay results revealed that ceo2 - ncs reduced the mmp in ht29 cells when compared with untreated cells ( figure 4a - b ) .
these mmp assay results supported the crystal violet - staining findings and demonstrated the cytotoxic potential of ceo2 - ncs .
figure 4 .
the microphotographs obtained by fluorescence microscopy indicate changes in mitochondrial membrane potential ( mmp ) .
( a ) untreated ht29 cells were used as a control .
( b ) ht29 cells showed significant changes in mitochondrial membrane potential ( mmp ) after treatment with ceo2 - ncs .
bars = 10 mum .
3.6 .
study of the apoptotic pathway ceo2 - ncs have been used in different therapeutic and industrial applications .
in the present study , a molecular approach was used to dissect the apoptotic pathway linked to cell death by estimating changes in the expression of anti - apoptotic ( bcl2 and bclxl ) and pro - apoptotic ( bax , parp and cytochrome c ) proteins , along with control proteins .
these studies were important because limited data are available about the molecular mechanism activated by ceo2 - ns that affects the protein expression levels of pro - and anti - apoptotic genes .
3.6.1 .
estimation of changes in the expression of bcl2 and bclxl proteins immunoblotting was carried out to examine possible changes in the expression levels of bcl2 and bclxl proteins in ht29 cells .
the expression levels of selected genes were compared with those of a housekeeping gene , beta - actin , that served as a control .
ht29 cells were exposed to synthesized ceo2 - ncs at a concentration of 2.26 mug ml - 1 for 24 h .
ceo2 - ncs induce cell death , as indicated by the down - regulation of bcl2 family anti - apoptotic proteins .
these experiments indicated that ceo2 - ncs inhibited the expression of bcl2 and bclxl when compared with beta - actin and the untreated negative control ( figure 5a - b ) .
no significant changes compared with the expression of beta - actin were observed ( figure 5c ) .
figure 5 .
western blot assessment of the expression of the anti - apoptotic proteins bcl - 2 , bcl - xl , and beta - actin ( control ) in ht29 cells treated with 2.26 mug ml - 1 ceo2 ncs for 24 h ; controls were untreated ht29 cells .
immunoblot images show the expression levels of anti - apoptotic proteins .
( a ) down - regulation of bcl - 2 expression was observed by immunoblot .
( b ) down - regulation of bcl - xl expression was observed by immunoblot .
( c ) expression levels of beta - actin ( control ) were unchanged .
several reports have shown that down - regulation of the expression of bcl2 and bclxl increased apoptotic potential [ 39,40 ]. by contrast , the up - regulation of bcl2 and bclxl expression inhibits apoptosis [ 39 ] .
our present findings indicated that ceo2 - ncs markedly reduced cell proliferation by inducing the down - regulation of bcl2 and bclxl expression .
therefore , the immunoblot findings were in accord with those of the mtt assay .
3.6.2 .
estimation of changes in expression of parp and cytochrome c proteins our data indicated that treatment of ht29 cells with ceo2 - ncs induced the expression of bax , a pro - apoptotic protein ( figure 6a ) .
furthermore , ceo2 - ncs could also induce parp cleavage in ht29 cells ( figure 6b ) .
parp is a protein that is involved in various cellular processes , such as dna repair and programmed cell death .
parp can be activated during the dna damage and cellular stress responses .
caspase activation results in parp cleavage during apoptosis .
our results demonstrated that cytochrome c was markedly increased in ht29 cells exposed to ceo2 - ncs when compared to controls ( figure 6c - d ) .
cytochrome c released from mitochondria promotes the induction of apoptosis .
these findings indicate that ceo2 - ncs remarkably inhibit cell growth by inducing apoptotic pathways .

western blot analysis of the pro - apoptotic proteins bax , parp , cytochrome c , and beta - actin ( control ) in ht29 cells treated with 2.26 mug ml - 1 ceo2 - ncs for 24 h ; untreated ht29 cells served as controls .
immunoblot analyses of the expression levels of apoptotic proteins are shown .
( a ) .
up - regulation of the expression of bax .
( b ) .
up - regulation of the expression of parp .
( c ) .
up - regulation of the expression of cytochrome c .
( d ) no significant change in the expression of beta - actin ( control ) .
3.7 .
biocompatibility assay of ceo2 - ncs in vitro blood hemolysis was measured using a biocompatibility assay .
the assay was used to analyze hemolysis considering the toxic nature of synthesized ceo2 - ncs , as described in a recent study [ 40 ] .
hemolysis may act as a potential cause of anemia in various pathological settings [ 28,41 ] .
human rbcs showed the hemolytic potential of ceo2 - ncs ( figure 7a ) .
these findings suggest that the hemolytic potential of ceo2 - ncs was less significant compared with that of a positive control , which implies that less damage occurs after the use of ceo2 - ncs .
our in vitro experiments demonstrated the biocompatibility of the synthesis of ceo2 - ncs , which indicated their suitability and biocompatibility for future drug development and applications in the field of biomedical science .
as shown in the graphs , hemolysis was less frequent in the test sample when compared with the positive control ( figure 7b ) .
therefore , the minimum hemolysis associated with ceo2 - ncs suggests the better suitability and biocompatibility of synthesized ncs for applications in biomedical science , such as the treatment and management of different diseases , including cancer .
figure 7 .
an in vitro biocompatibility assay shows possible hemolysis of ceo2 ncs compared with both positive and negative controls .
( a ) the test sample ( ceo2 - ncs ) showed minimum destruction of rbcs , and the negative sample exhibited no rbc destruction compared with the positive control .
( b ) the percentage of hemolysis in test samples and the positive control .
4. conclusions ceo2 - ncs were successfully synthesized and their physical properties were optimized using various techniques .
the fetem micrograph of prepared ceo2 ncs showed that the particles were well dispersed with a diameter range of 13 - 20 nm , which was confirmed by xrd .
an in vitro cell cytotoxicity assay showed that ceo2 - ncs had cytotoxic potential .
it is essential to determine whether other molecular mechanisms in different pathways are involved .
the apoptotic pathway assessments with western blot assays confirmed that ceo2 - ncs targeted to ht29 cancer cell lines altered the expression levels of the anti - apoptotic proteins bcl2 and bclxl , and increased the expression of the bax , parp , and cytochrome c proteins .
bcl2 protein can exert anti - apoptotic effects , while the bax protein is potentially involved in the regulation of pro - apoptotic activities [ 42 ] .
certain ratios of bax / bcl - 2 protein are associated with cell death , which determines the death or life of particular cells in response to an apoptotic stimulus ; a higher ratio of bax / bcl2 robustly inhibits cellular resistance to apoptotic stimuli .
furthermore , the reduced effect of ceo2 - ncs on rbcs in the hemolysis assay suggests biocompatibility .
therefore , the synthesis of ceo2 - ncs in the present study may be further examined for use in the preclinical development of novel anti - cancer drugs , which could improve the health of humans because of the significant anticancer potential of such compounds .
studies of the anti - cancer properties of ceo2 - ncs are in an advanced stage for the development of next - generation drugs for in vivo trials .

uterine leiomyosarcoma ( lms ) is a rare tumor constituting 1 % of all uterine malignancies .
this sarcoma demonstrates an aggressive growth pattern with an high rate of recurrence with hematologic dissemination ; the most common sites are lung , liver , and peritoneal cavity , head and neck district being rarely interested .
only other four cases of metastasis in the oral cavity have been previously described .
the treatment of choice is surgery and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation has limited impact on clinical outcome .
in case of metastases , surgical excision can be performed considering extent of disease , number and type of distant lesions , disease free interval from the initial diagnosis to the time of metastases , and expected life span .
we illustrate a case of uterine lms metastasis in the upper buccal gingiva that occurred during chemotherapy in a 63 - year - old woman that underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy for a diagnosis of lms staged as pt2bn0 and that developed lung metastases eight months after primary treatment .
surgical excision of the oral mass ( previously misdiagnosed as epulis at a dental center ) and contemporary reconstruction with pedicled temporalis muscle flap was performed in order to improve quality of life .
even if resection was achieved in free margins , " local " relapse was observed 5 months after surgery .
1. introduction uterine leiomyosarcomas ( lmss ) constitute 1 % of all uterine malignancies and approximately 25 % of uterine sarcomas , that are rare tumors that account for only 3 % to 7 % of all uterine cancers [ 1 , 2 ] .
they demonstrate an aggressive growth pattern with a high rate of recurrence with hematologic dissemination ; the most common sites are lung , liver , and peritoneal cavity [ 3 ] .
head and neck district is rarely interested , and only other four cases of metastasis in the oral cavity have been previously described [ 4 ] .
in particular , we illustrate the second case of metastasis in the upper buccal gingiva in a 63 - year - old woman in which lung metastasis was also present .
2. case report a 63 - year - old woman with a history of advanced uterine lms presented to our center with a painful , ulcerated swelling on the right upper buccal gingiva ( figure 1 ) .
she underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy for a diagnosis of lms staged as pt2bn0 fourteen months previously .
eight months after primary treatment she developed two bilateral lung masses ( suv max : 7.8 at ( 18 ) f - fluoride pet / ct ) ; histological examination of the 11 mm lung mass in the right chest revealed a metastasis of lms .
an adjunctive lung mass was present in the left chest .
chemotherapy was administered , initially with isofosfamide - epidoxorubicin , with scarce tolerance ( grade 3 - 4 neuthropenia ) so that it was decided to administer taxotere .
during this treatment she developed a rapidly growing mass in the right upper buccal gingiva .
she was referred to her dentistry that performed an excisional biopsy under local anesthesia suspecting a " haemorragic epulis. " histological examination was compatible with metastasis of leiomyosarcoma , incompletely excised .
a ct scan performed about 1 month after resection revealed an osteolytic lesion of 30 x 35 mm of the upper maxilla ( figure 2 ) ; mri was not performed because the patient was claustrophobic .
because of the rapid growth observed just in 40 days , it was decided according to oncologist to perform a partial maxillectomy and contemporary reconstruction with temporalis muscle pedicled flap even if a lung metastasis was present .
histological examination confirmed the presence of a 6 cm spindle cells lms , entirely excised .
immunohistochemical analysis against monoclonal antibodies for a - smooth muscle actin ( a - sma ) , desmin , hhf - 35 , caldesmon , and vimentin was positive ; mitotic index ( ki67 ) was of 90 % ( figure 3 ) .
considering the radical excision , no " adjuvant " radiotherapy on the oral cavity was administered .
in order to control lung metastasis and considering the aggressiveness of the disease , it was decided to perform two other cycles of chemotherapy with ifofosfamide - epidoxorubicin .
a partial regression of the lung metastasis was obtained , but again it was impossible to continue treatment because of high toxicity .
a pet - ct performed 3 months after surgery revealed a right femur metastasis , so that radiotherapy was performed .
two months later , after an episode of epistaxis , head and neck ct scan with contrast revealed a relapse in the masticatory space and rinopharynx : the patient was referred to palliative radiotherapy .
3. discussion lmss usually arise in anatomical sites with abundant smooth muscle , such as gastrointestinal tract , retroperitoneum , and uterus ; nevertheless , uterine lmss constitute only 1 % of all uterine malignancies [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] .
despite variable results , patients with uterine lms have an overall poor prognosis with a long - term 5 - year survival and risk of recurrence ranging from 25 % to 75 % , even if these tumors are usually confined to the uterus at the time of diagnosis [ 5 , 6 ] .
the majority of patients who recur do so within 2 years of initial diagnosis , and up to 90 % of patients who fail show distant metastases either alone or concurrent with pelvic recurrence .
in our case , the tumor was confined to the uterus at the time of diagnosis , and distant metastases to the lung were detected eight months after primary treatment .
the most common sites of recurrence are peritoneal cavity ( 30 - 50 % of cases ) , lung ( 30 - 40 %) , and liver ( about 10 %) ; only rarely do they involve the brain and skull (< 1 %) owing to pulmonary arterial circulation [ 7 ] .
metastatic uterine lms to the oral cavity are extremely rare , and only four other cases have been previously described [ 4 , 8 ] .
also considering lmss originated from other primary sites , only other three cases with metastasis to oral cavity can be found [ 8 , 9 ] .
the rarity of buccal mucosa involvement can be due to the fact that in the oral cavity smooth muscle is very scarce , being present in the blood vessel walls and the circumvallate papillae of the tongue .
kim et al. hypothesize that " the metastatic mass must be related to the blood vessels in the buccal cheek , and the maxillary gingivae with haematogenous spread from the uterus via lung to the oral cavity " [ 4 ] .
in our case oral metastasis to the upper gingival developed after lung metastases .
they also found that metastatic tissue was different from tissue from primary site , being more vascularized and composed by cells more spindle - shaped moderately positive to the a - sma antibody [ 4 ] .
in our case it was impossible to compare the two specimens , because the patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy at another center .
the treatment of choice of uterine lms is surgery and the use of adjuvant treatment has limited impact on clinical outcome , and radiotherapy seems only to improve local control , because most recurrences develop at distant sites [ 6 , 10 ] .
the most common chemotherapic agent used for lmss is doxorubicin , usually associated with ifofosfamide [ 10 , 11 ] .
in this case no adjuvant radiotherapy was administered after total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy , and chemotherapy was started after the detection of lung metastases .
in case of metastatic disease , factors that would contribute to the decision of operability would include extent of tumor ( tnm ) , number and type of metastases , disease free interval from the initial diagnosis to the time of metastases , and expected life span [ 7 ] .
in our case , the decision to proceed with surgical removal of the upper gingiva mass , even in presence of advanced disease , was taken in order to improve quality of life , being chemotherapy and radiotherapy inadequate to control the oral recurrence .
obviously , reconstruction has been achieved using the " simplest " methods , using temporalis muscle flaps , even if a free flap reconstruction is the treatment of choice in order to reconstruct both bone and soft tissue [ 12 , 13 ] .
bone grafts were not use in order to avoid complication in case of irradiation [ 14 , 15 ] .
adjuvant radiotherapy was not considered because of resection in free margins with no suspect of residual disease .
nevertheless , local recurrence was observed 5 months after surgical removal so that patient was referred to palliative radiotherapy .
in conclusion , even if head and neck metastases from uterine leiomyosarcoma are rare , they have to be suspected in case of rapidly growing haemorrhagic mass .
due to the aggressive growth pattern of the tumor , wide surgical excision in free margins of metastatic lesions could not be sufficient , so that in selected cases , in order to improve local control , the use of adjuvant radiotherapy can be considered .
obviously , this can lead to improving quality of life not influencing clinical outcome .

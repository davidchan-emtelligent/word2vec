background research training is essential to the development of well - rounded physicians .
although many pediatric residency programs require residents to complete a research project , it is often challenging to integrate research training into educational programs .
objective we aimed to develop an innovative research program for pediatric residents , called the scholarly activity guidance and evaluation ( sage ) program .
methods we developed a competency - based program which establishes benchmarks for pediatric residents , while providing ongoing academic mentorship .
results feedback from residents and their research supervisors about the sage program has been positive .
preliminary evaluation data have shown that all final - year residents have met or exceeded program expectations .
conclusions by providing residents with this supportive environment , we hope to influence their academic career paths , increase their research productivity , promote evidence - based practice , and ultimately , positively impact health outcomes .
research postgraduate medical education pediatrics teaching medical residents the knowledge , skills , and attitudes they need to appraise and conduct research is essential to their development into well - rounded physicians. by equipping residents with the tools they need to succeed in research activities , residency programs can help promote evidence - based practice , advance the field of medicine , and ultimately , improve patient health outcomes .
the general standards of accreditation of the royal college of physicians and surgeons of canada ( rcpsc ) require that residency programs ' must be able to demonstrate that there are effective teaching programs in the critical appraisal of the medical literature ' and ' be able to demonstrate that residents are able to conduct a scholarly project ' ( 1 ) .
in addition , the rcpsc pediatric - specific objectives of training state that all pediatric residents must significantly participate in a scholarly activity in order to be eligible to graduate from their residency program ( 2 ) .
the interpretation of what constitutes significant scholarly activity varies widely , with some programs accepting , for example , journal clubs , the teaching of other students , conference attendance , or resident research involvement as evidence of scholarly activity ( 3 ) .
regardless of which form their scholarly activity takes , residents require guidance and evaluation to ensure they develop research skills , which carry benefits for clinical care , critical appraisal , clinical reasoning , and lifelong learning ( 4 , 5 ) .
attempts to develop residents' research skills have been described in both medical and surgical specialties ( 6 - 14 ) .
yet , the successful conduct of research during residency training is not without its challenges .
residents have listed inadequate protected time , lack of previous research training , insufficient financial support , vague curricular requirements , and limited contact with ongoing research projects as perceived barriers ( 15 ) .
the lack of available mentors has also been identified as one of the key factors preventing residents from completing research during their clinical training ( 16 , 17 ) .
many pediatric programs encourage their residents to participate in or complete a research project during residency training .
although critical elements of successful programs have begun to emerge ( 18 , 19 ) , there is still an overall lack of evidence on how best to integrate a research training program into the culture of a residency training program ( 15 , 18 - 20 ) .
an informal review of canadian pediatric residency programs demonstrated a widespread absence of structured programs to assist residents in the development of their research skills .
while most canadian pediatric residency programs have a coordinator to oversee their research activities , none , to our knowledge , have developed a formalized program with clear expectations and benchmarks .
a needs assessment conducted in 2012 of both residents and faculty members who supervise resident research projects at our institution revealed that 32 % of participating residents and 26 % of participating supervisors believed that our center was not supportive of resident research in that it did not provide sufficient resources or training for research ( 21 ) .
thus , there was a clear need for the development of a formal support system to foster resident research initiatives .
in this article , we describe our scholarly activity guidance and evaluation ( sage ) program ; a competency - based research program .
this program provides ongoing academic mentorship and establishes benchmarks for pediatric residents , who are required to complete research projects as part of their residency training .
methods in september 2012 , we established the sage program for pediatric residents at a tertiary care pediatric academic health sciences center in ontario , canada .
the program is based on the key competencies that residents must attain to fulfill the scholar role , as described by the rcpsc .
the scholar role is one of seven roles that physicians are expected to develop over the course of their residency training ( 22 ) .
the key competencies that residents must demonstrate as part of the scholar role include the ability to : 1 ) maintain and enhance professional activities through ongoing learning ; 2 ) critically evaluate information and its sources , and apply this appropriately to practice decisions ; 3 ) facilitate the learning of patients , families , students , residents , health professionals , the public , and others , as appropriate ; and 4 ) contribute to the creation , dissemination , application , and translation of new medical knowledge and practices ( 23 ) .
the sage program focuses primarily on the development of residents' abilities related to competencies 2 and 4 as described above .
program overview the sage program includes two mandatory components .
the first consists of in - person lectures and presentations on topics relevant to the development of scholarly projects ( e.g. , basic statistics , research design , research ethics , literature reviews , formulating research questions ) and journal clubs .
since these activities have traditionally been part of the training of residents , they were seamlessly integrated into the sage program .
the second and more innovative component of the program is designed to support and promote residents in the successful completion of their scholarly projects .
the goal of this component of the program is to foster residents' contributions to the creation , dissemination , application , and translation of new medical and educational knowledge and practices. by providing residents with the appropriate resources , guidance , and mentorship , along with regular assessments of their progress based on realistic and achievable benchmarks , we sought to improve residents' scholarly abilities and develop accountability in terms of the completion of their projects .
each resident is expected to participate in the program for the duration of their pediatric residency ( typically 3 - 4 years ) .
the first - year milestone consists of residents identifying a research idea , question ( s ) , and project supervisor .
two worksheets need to be completed - one that helps them brainstorm a research idea and another that assists them in designing a question that accounts for the target population , intended intervention , comparison factor , and intended outcome .
the second - year milestone consists of drafting a research proposal , which includes a literature review , research objective ( s ) and question ( s ) , a description of the methodology , ethical considerations , dissemination plans , and a budget .
the remaining milestones , which include carrying out the proposed research by meeting with content and methodology experts , submitting the projects to the required ethics board ( s ) , applying for research funding ( if needed ) , collecting and analyzing data , drafting a manuscript , and disseminating findings at academic conferences , are achieved over the subsequent 1 to 2 years of training ( see appendix a ) .
the sage program provides structured support , guidance , mentorship to , and assessment of the residents throughout this process , as further detailed in the following sections .
sage resources a resident sage handbook is available in electronic and hardcopy format .
the handbook describes the sage program and includes yearly milestones , timelines , worksheets , progress report forms , forms used by residents to request protected research time , links to grant and ethics application forms , as well as information on our newly developed online resident research training program ( 21 ) .
the online resident research training program includes four short online lessons on : 1 ) how to critically evaluate research literature ; 2 ) how to write a research proposal ; 3 ) how to submit an application for research funding ; and 4 ) how to write a manuscript .
sage rounds sage rounds are open to all staff members at our institution and occur four times a year .
this is a forum for residents to present their research - in - progress or nascent research ideas , and receive constructive feedback from program mentors and peers .
residents are instructed to keep their presentations informal , as a means of stimulating a fruitful and unintimidating discussion .
depending on the stage of the residents' projects , these rounds can be used as an opportunity to bounce ideas off of the audience or discuss challenges .
sage committee this committee is chaired by the scholarly activity coordinator and consists of 12 to 14 individuals .
it includes representatives from the primary stakeholder groups in resident research - resident research supervisors , residents , community - based clinicians , residency program directors , and research staff with expertise in basic science , clinical research , and medical education research .
residents must submit a research progress report to this committee every six months that outlines the current state of their required scholarly projects and any challenges they are facing .
the committee reviews the reports , provides written feedback to each resident , connects residents with content and methodological experts , and reviews their draft ethics and funding applications prior to submission .
sage resident assessment the sage committee uses an eight - item open - ended assessment form to provide formative feedback to each resident .
this form is returned electronically to the resident and his / her research supervisor .
the committee also assesses the residents' progress to date , categorizing it as : ' on track - no major concerns with progress ' , ' minor concerns with progress ' , or ' major concerns with progress ' .
if the committee has major concerns with a resident 's progress , the scholarly activity coordinator meets with the resident to discuss the perceived challenges and to jointly brainstorm solutions .
in addition , the scholarly activity coordinator meets individually with all first - year residents within the first six months of their residency training to provide guidance on the selection of a research topic and supervisor .
lastly , prior to writing their pediatric certification examinations , the scholarly activity coordinator in consultation with the other members of the sage committee , determines if residents have met the established scholarly expectations .
to graduate from the residency program , residents must have completed one of the following dissemination activities : 1 ) presentation of their project at the institution 's annual resident research day ; 2 ) presentation of the project at a local , provincial , national , or international meeting ; or 3 ) submission of a manuscript to a peer - reviewed journal .
results anecdotal feedback from residents and their research supervisors about the sage program has been positive .
preliminary evaluation data have also shown that , over the last two years , all final - year residents have met or exceeded the expectations of the sage program relating to the dissemination activities as stated above .
in addition , the number of submissions to our institutional annual resident research day has consistently increased , despite the fact that the number of residents enrolled in our local residency training program has not significantly risen .
for example , in the 2011 - 12 academic year , we had seven resident research day submissions ( out of 42 residents ) , compared to 12 submissions in the 2014 - 15 academic year ( out of 43 residents ) .
given these promising findings , we are now undertaking a formal and systematic evaluation of the sage program .
the evaluation is structured around guskey 's five critical levels of evaluation ( 24 ) and will be used to strengthen the structure and content of the program .
more specifically , we will evaluate the following : 1 ) level 1 : residents' and supervisors' reactions to the program ; 2 ) level 2 : residents' learning 3 ) level 3 : organization support and change ; 4 ) level 4 : residents' use of new knowledge and skills ; and 5 ) level 5 : residents' learning outcomes .
to guide this comprehensive evaluation , we have developed an evaluation framework , which includes the indicators , data sources , and data collection methods that we will use ( see appendix b ) .
conclusion our innovative sage program is designed to promote pediatric resident research success and foster canmeds scholar competencies .
as competency - based medical education has emerged as a priority topic in medical education ( 25 ) , initiatives such as the sage program are of particular interest , as they specifically target scholar competencies , which have traditionally been found difficult to teach .
the strength of the program lies in the easy access that residents have to a rich network of support , guidance , supervision , and mentorship , which are focused on the unique needs of each resident .
it has been shown that residents exposed to research have an increased interest in academic careers ( 15 ) .
as such , we hope that , by providing residents with a supportive learning environment , we will influence their academic career paths , increase their research productivity , promote evidence - based practice , and ultimately , positively impact health outcomes .

according to previous reports , ribosomal rack1 was also suggested to control translation depending on the status in translating ribosome .
we here show that rack1 knockdown induces autophagy independent of upstream canonical factors such as beclin1 , atg7 and atg5 / 12 conjugates .
we further report that rack1 knockdown induces the association of mrnas of lc3 and bcl - xl with polysomes , indicating increased translation of these proteins .
therefore , we propose that the rack1 depletion - induced autophagy is distinct from canonical autophagy .
finally , we confirm that cells expressing mutant rack1 ( rack1r36d / k38e ) defective in ribosome binding showed the same result as rack1 - knockdown cells .
altogether , our data clearly show that the depletion of ribosomal rack1 alters the capacity of the ribosome to translate specific mrnas , resulting in selective translation of mrnas of genes for non - canonical autophagy induction .
rack1 ( receptor for activated c - kinase 1 ) is a scaffold protein that can bind hundreds of other proteins .
rack1 was first identified as a signaling molecule that interacts with pkcbetaii to contribute to cellular growth , movement and differentiation.1 , 2 , 3 because it lacks catalytic domains,4 rack1 functions as a molecular ship that shuttles activated pkcbetaii and various other signaling proteins , including integrin and src .
the interaction between rack1 and various proteins in different cellular compartments plays a critical role in many physiological processes , such as cell motility , cell survival and death , proliferation , immune signaling , tumorigenesis and neuronal function.5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 also , rack1 can regulate global and specific translations in different ways .
rack1 is an integral component of ribosomal 40s subunit,11 acts as a signaling platform for the translational machinery and regulates a late step in translation initiation.12 , 13 ribosomal rack1 is located at the head region of the 40s subunit , in the vicinity of the mrna exit channel.14 when a cell receives a signal that promotes translation , rack1 - associated pkcbetaii phosphorylates eif6 .
in succession , phosphorylated eif6 is released from the 60s subunit to induce 80s ribosome formation.15 , 16 furthermore , ribosomal rack1 is required for ires - mediated translation after viral infection,17 suggesting a function for ribosomal rack1 in selective mrna translation .
deletion of the yeast rack1 homolog asc1 is not lethal,18 whereas the complete depletion of rack1 in mouse embryo is lethal .
moreover , rack1 hypomorphic mice are deficient in protein synthesis.19 also , in nematodes and mammals , rack1 contributes to the recruitment of mirisc ( mirna - induced silencing complex ) to the ribosome complex , followed by mirna - mediated regulation of gene expression at the post - transcriptional level.20 however few reports have addressed the relationship between rack1 and autophagy.21 cells strive to maintain beneficial environmental conditions .
this self - adjusting mechanism is called homeostasis .
eukaryotic cells have two protein degradation processes to maintain cellular homeostasis ; one is an ubiquitin - proteasome system ( ups ) and the other is an autophagy.22 in contrast to ups , autophagy selectively eliminates protein aggregates and useless cellular organelles .
in general , autophagy is a slower mechanism than the ups and it degrades relatively long - lived proteins .
autophagy is classified into two categories according to the target .
one is selective autophagy and the other is non - selective autophagy .
non - selective autophagy is involved in the random degradation and sequestration of a portion in a cytosol .
however , selective autophagy is more complex .
it can degrade specific protein aggregates or organelles using adaptor proteins such as p62 / sqstm1 and nbr1.23 ribophagy , mitophagy and reticulophagy are examples of selective autophagy.24 , 25 in autophagy signaling pathways , the two types of autophagy have much in common .
association of lc3 with a double - membrane structure , phagophore , is a key step in the autophagic mechanism .
the phagophore is extended by additional lc3 , engulfs the target protein and forms an autophagosome , which fuses with lysosomes to form autophagolysosomes , resulting in lysosome - mediated degradation .
thus , components of proteins or cellular organelles are reused for adaptation to new environments.26 autophagy is a complex process controlled by numerous autophagy - related ( atg ) proteins.27 , 28 under nutrient - rich conditions , mtor complex 1 suppresses the ulk1 complex .
upon autophagy induction , the ulk1 complex is activated , which is the first step in canonical autophagy.29 active ulk1 complex induces the class iii phosphatidylinositol ( ptdins ) 3 - kinase complex ( beclin1 complex ) and mediates the initial stages of vesicle nucleation , resulting in autophagosome formation.30 meanwhile , beclin1 forms a complex with bcl - 2 or bcl - xl under normal conditions , which inhibits canonical autophagy .
the interaction is disrupted by jnk1 - mediated bcl - 2 or bcl - xl phosphorylation , which is followed by autophagy induction.31 , 32 after nucleation by the beclin1 complex , two ubiquitin - like conjugation systems , the atg5 - atg12 system and the lc3 conjugation system , cause autophagosomal elongation.33 the last step of canonical autophagy is autophagolysosome formation by the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes.34 , 35 several other autophagy mechanisms , which are now referred to as a non - canonical autophagy , are not related to the canonical autophagy pathway.36 an example of non - canonical autophagy is beclin1 - independent autophagy , which does not require the canonical nucleation step mediated by the beclin1 complex.37 however , the molecular mechanism of non - canonical autophagy is unclear .
our data suggested that rack1 depletion stimulates non - canonical autophagy due to induction of lc3 and bcl - xl translation .
results knockdown of rack1 induces autophagy in ht1080 cells rack1 participates in numerous cellular functions through interacting with many signaling proteins .
we here showed the activation of autophagy when rack1 sirna is treated , judging from the levels of two autophagic markers , p62 and lc3.38 , 39 the level of p62 / sqstm1 , an autophagy receptor , was reduced and that of lc3 - ii was increased by rack1 knockdown ( figure 1a ) .
subsequently , we treated control and rack1 - knockdown cells with bafilomycin a1 , an autophagy inhibitor that blocks the fusion of autophagosome and lysosome .
as shown in figure 1b , p62 / sqstm1 was restored in bafilomycin a1 - treated rack1 - knockdown cells .
we demonstrated that this phenomenon was not caused by an sirna off - target effect .
other sirnas that target different regions of the rack1 mrna sequence also induced autophagy ( supplementary figures s1a and c ) .
according to previous reports in yeasts , nonfunctional or abnormal ribosomes were shown to induce a selective autophagy known as ribophagy , which degrades the ribosome complex .
therefore , we checked the levels of other ribosomal proteins that belong to both 40s small and 60s large subunits .
the rps3 , rpl13 and rpl11 protein levels were little changed by rack1 knockdown ( figure 1c ) .
next , as rack1 is a scaffold protein involved in numerous signaling pathways , we assessed its participation in autophagy signaling .
however , overexpression of rack1 did not affect the level of lc3 in ht1080 cells ( figure 1d ) .
thus , rack1 does not seem to be an inhibitor of autophagy .
to extend our finding of rack1 - knockdown - induced autophagy , we investigated the accumulation of gfp - lc3 puncta by fluorescence microscopy .
we generated a stable cell line expressing egfp - lc3 , and then the cells were treated with sirnas for control and rack1 .
the number of egfp - lc3 puncta and relative size of autophagosome were markedly increased in rack1 - knockdown cells compared with control ( figures 1e and f ) .
in addition , the lc3 - ii protein level and the number of egfp - lc3 puncta are significantly higher only in rack1 - knockdown cells compared with rps3 - and rpl30 - knockdown cells ( figures 1g and supplementary figure s1d ) .
in addition , in the stable cell line , co - localization of the autophagosome and lysosome was examined.40 rack1 - knockdown cells exhibited significantly elevated co - localization level of gfp - lc3 puncta and lysotracker , compared with control cells ( figure 1h ) .
these data collectively indicate that rack1 knockdown induces autophagic flux in terms of an increment in p62 / sqstm autophagic degradation and autophagolysosome formation .
rack1 depletion induces non - canonical autophagy autophagy has a very complicated mechanism and a lot of factors that contribute to its flux in diverse ways .
pointing out a few examples , ulk1 , atg13 and rb1cc1 are major components of the ulk1 complex , which is involved in the initiation step of autophagy29 and antiapoptotic proteins , bcl - xl and bcl - 2 , function as an inhibitor of beclin1 complex.32 among the intricate pathway , to characterize the rack1 - knockdown - induced autophagic flux in detail , we examined the pathways upstream and downstream of lc3 .
especially , we checked the levels of two significant factors essential for canonical autophagy , beclin1 and conjugated atg5 / 12 .
beclin1 is a mammalian homolog of yeast atg6 , which constitutes the class iii pi3k complex.30 the class iii pi3k complex contributes to an upstream step of autophagic flux such as vesicle nucleation .
conjugated atg5 / 12 is involved in autophagosome membrane elongation .
it is part of the ubiquitin - like conjugation system and functions as an e2 - like enzyme for lipidation of lc3 - i protein.33 as shown in figure 2a , the levels of these proteins were not increased by treatment with rack1 sirna .
additionally , ht1080 cells were transfected with rack1 sirna together with beclin1 sirna ( figure 2b ) or atg5 sirna ( figure 2c ) .
because beclin1 and atg5 are positive regulators of canonical autophagy , knockdown of beclin1 and atg5 resulted in a reduced level of lc3 - ii , indicating blockade of canonical autophagy .
however , the increased lc3 protein level induced by rack1 knockdown was not blocked by beclin1 or atg5 sirna co - treatment .
also , we reconfirmed that rack1 knockdown did not increase the levels of beclin1 or atg5 / 12 conjugates .
therefore , the increased level of lc3 - ii induced by rack1 knockdown results in beclin1 and atg5 / 12 - independent non - canonical autophagy .
moreover , rack1 depletion - induced autophagy was independent of the levels of several other autophagy - related factors ( figure 2d ) .
when treated with rack1 sirna , the protein levels of ulk1 , atg9a , atg4b and atg16 were unaffected .
these proteins were increased under serum - starvation conditions as an example of canonical autophagy induction ( supplementary figure s2b ) .
thus , the rack1 - knockdown - induced autophagy follows a non - canonical pathway .
interestingly , we detected a significant increment of lamp1 and lamp2 levels in rack1 - knockdown cells ( figure 2e ) .
lysosomal - associated membrane protein 1 and 2 ( lamp1 and lamp2 ) , lysosomal membrane glycoproteins,41 are downstream markers of autophagy that facilitate autophagolysosome formation .
a similar increment was detected under serum - starvation conditions ( supplementary figure 2c ) .
given that the phosphorylation of ulk1 at serine 758 by mtor inhibits canonical autophagy , we next examined the phosphorylation status of ulk1 .
we found that rack1 knockdown does not affect the ulk1 protein level , but induces an increment of the ser758 phosphorylation status of ulk1 ( supplementary figure s2e ) .
the increased phosphorylation on ser758 of ulk1 by rack1 knockdown was even more clearly observed under starvation condition ( supplementary figure s2f ) .
these findings strongly suggested that rack1 knockdown induces non - canonical autophagy that is independent of initiation step as indicated by the increment in lc3 protein .
knockdown of rack1 increases bcl - xl protein level in addition to these , we further found that the bcl - xl level was significantly increased by treatment with rack1 sirna ( figure 3a ) .
bcl - xl is an antiapoptotic protein that contributes to cell survival and inhibits canonical autophagy by binding to the beclin1 complex.31 , 32 then the increment of bcl - xl was not affected by beclin1 sirna treatment ( figure 3b ) and by rapamycin treatment ( figure 3c ) .
bcl - xl belongs to bcl - 2 protein family and bcl - xl and bcl - 2 are very similar,42 but their expression patterns were quite different when rack1 was depleted ( figure 3b ) .
because bcl - xl and beclin1 interact under basal conditions to regulate autophagy induction , we in turn performed co - ip experiment to examine the effect of rack1 knockdown on the interaction ( figure 3d ) .
the bcl - xl and beclin1 interaction was markedly increased in rack1 - knockdown cells as compared with control cells , indicating repression of canonical autophagy .
these findings suggested that rack1 knockdown induces non - canonical autophagy as indicated by the increments of lc3 protein and of the interaction of beclin1 with bcl - xl .
rack1 - knockdown - induced autophagy is not a cell - line - specific phenomenon thus far , we investigated the autophaic flux induced by rack1 - knockdown in ht1080 cells .
to determine whether other cell lines show a similar phenomenon , several other cells were used .
autophagy induction by rack1 knockdown was also observed in hela and u2os cells ( figures 4a and i - k ) .
this result is in a good agreement with our previous data in ht1080 cells .
however , the incubation time after sirna treatment differed between those cell lines ( supplementary figures 1b and 3a ) .
moreover , this phenomenon was also detected in normal human dermal fibroblasts ( hdfs ) ( figures 4b and k and supplementary figure 3b ) .
similar to hela and u2os cells , hdf cells also appeared to have an effective time for autophagy induction after rack1 sirna treatment ( supplementary figure 3c ) .
in two other hcc cell lines , hepg2 ( p53 wild type ) and hep3b ( p53 null ) cells , the autophagy induction was also observed ( figures 4c and k ) .
in addition , there was no noticeable increment in beclin1 and decrement in several ribosomal proteins ( figure 4d ) .
indeed , using a fluorescence microscope , egfp - lc3 stably expressing hepg2 and hep3b cell lines also exhibited markedly increased numbers of gfp - lc3 puncta following rack1 sirna treatment ( figure 4f ) .
moreover , the lc3 - ii protein level was increased in rack1 - knockdown cells but not in rps3 - or rpl30 - knockdown cells , and the fluorescence data showed identical patterns as well ( figure 4e and supplementary figure 3d ) .
besides , co - localization level of gfp - lc3 puncta and lysotracker was also elevated in rack1 - knockdown cells ( supplementary figure 3e ) .
in conclusion , these results indicate that rack1 - knockdown - induced autophagy is neither a cell - line - specific nor a p53 - dependent phenomenon .
furthermore , we proved that the phenomenon is not related to tumorigenic stages , using two breast cancer cell lines , mcf7 and mda - mb231 cells ( figures 4g and k ) .
in the breast cancer cell lines , non - canonical autophagy induction and bcl - xl increment were also detected when rack1 sirna was treated .
the similar phenomenon is observed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( mefs ) , in addition to several human cell lines ( figures 4h and k ) , and even observed in asc1 , a yeast rack1 homolog , deletion strains in saccharomyces cerevisiae ( data not shown ) .
to sum up , when cells were treated with rack1 sirna , lc3 - ii protein level is increased and p62 protein level is decreased , meaning autophagy induction , and bcl - xl is also increased .
increment of lc3 and bcl - xl occurs at the translational level our findings presented so far indicate that rack1 knockdown induces non - canonical autophagy , accompanied by an increment in the level of lc3 and bcl - xl proteins .
then , we were curious about how the level of those proteins was increased in rack1 - knockdown cells .
rack1 is a component of the 40s ribosomal subunit and may contribute to protein translation as a link between extracellular signals and the ribosome complexes .
additionally , rack1 regulates the selective translation of viral ires - containing mrnas,17 and recruits the mirna - induced silencing complex to the translating ribosome.43 beclin1 - independent autophagy , meanwhile , is related to ires - dependent translation.44 accordingly , to clarify the inductions of both lc3 and bcl - xl in rack1 depletion condition , we intended to examine the effect of ribosomal rack1 depletion on mrna translation .
as depicted in supplementary figures s4a and b , ribosome fractionation of rack1 sirna - transfected cells were performed , followed by isolation of polysomes.45 the level of polysomal fraction peaks in rack1 - knockdown cells was decreased compared with control cells and the rate of protein synthesis was also slightly reduced ( supplementary figure s4c and d ) .
subsequently , translating mrna was extracted from these polysomal fractions , and the mrna was analyzed ( supplementary figure s4e ) .
based on our results and other previous reports , we suggested that ribosomal rack1 depletion affects the repertoire of mrna in actively translating ribosomes .
to explore whether the increment in lc3 protein induced by rack1 knockdown occurs at the translational level , cells were treated with a combination of cycloheximide and bafilomycin a1 after treatment with several sirnas .
rack1 knockdown increased the lc3 protein level compared with control ( figure 5a , lanes 1 and 5 ) , and the increment was diminished to the basal level by cycloheximide treatment ( figure 5a , lanes 3 and 7 ) .
co - treatment of cells with cycloheximide and bafilomycin a1 induced a slight increase in the lc3 protein level following rack1 knockdown comparison with control cells ( figure 5a , lanes 4 and 8 ) .
in summary , the increment of lc3 induced by rack1 knockdown is regulated at the translational level , even if bafilomycin a1 is considered as an inhibitor of the autophagosomal degradation of lc3 protein .
we next performed a real - time pcr assay of lc3 and bcl - xl mrnas in polysomes of rack1 - depleted cells .
the real - time pcr data , which were normalized to the appropriate mrna level of beta - actin , indicated a significant increment in the translating lc3 and bcl - xl mrna levels in the polysomal fraction of rack1 - depleted cells compared with control cells ( figure 5b ) , while the levels of these mrnas in whole - cell lysates were unchanged ( figure 5c ) .
we performed the same experiment using a different lc3 primers and obtained a similar result ( supplementary figure s5a ) .
therefore , in rack1 - knockdown cells , the increment in lc3 and bcl - xl protein levels is caused by specific translation of the rack1 - depleted ribosome .
to completely exclude the probability of canonical autophagy induced by rack1 knockdown , we used atg7 knockout mef cells ( supplementary figure s5b ) .
because atg7 is an e1 - like activating enzyme related to lc3 activation,46 knockout of atg7 cannot induce the conversion of lc3 - i into lc3 - ii that indicates the blockade of canonical autophagy .
as shown in figure 5d , in atg7 knockout mef cells , the increment of lc3 - i and bcl - xl protein levels by rack1 sirna treatment was also observed when treated with pepstatin a , which blocks the degradation of autophagolysosome ( figure 5d ) .
collectively , the results suggested that rack1 depletion - induced autophagy is independent of atg7 , indicating non - canonical autophagy due to specific translation by the rack1 - depleted ribosome .
overexpression of rack1r36d / k38e also induces autophagy to determine whether depletion of ribosomal rack1 influenced other canonical autophagic proteins , we transfected a plasmid of ribosome - binding defective mutant , rack1 r36d / k38e ( terms rack1 de mutant ) plasmid into cells .
the rack1 de mutant did not associate with polysomes ( supplementary figures s6a and b ) and the rate of protein synthesis was slightly reduced ( supplementary figure s6c ). 47 in ht1080 cells , transfection of the rack1 de mutant increased the levels of lc - ii and bcl - xl proteins compared with rack1 wt transfection ( figure 6a ) .
moreover , hela , hepg2 and hep3b cells yielded similar results ( figures 6b and c ) .
in addition , autophagosome formation was increased by transfection of rack1 de mutant .
the number of gfp dots was greater in the rack1 de mutant - transfected cells than rack1 wt - transfected cells , using three different cell lines stably expressing gfp - lc3 ( figure 6d ). and the co - localization level of gfp - lc3 puncta and lysotracker was also elevated in rack1 de mutant ( supplementary figure s6d ) .
therefore , depletion of ribosomal rack1 enhances autophagic flux , including increments in lc3 and bcl - xl protein levels .
thus , the rack1 status of a ribosome complex is a critical factor for non - canonical autophagy induction by lc3 mrna - specific translation .
discussion autophagy is induced by various cellular stresses , such as starvation , hypoxia and viral infection .
under stress conditions , cells use autophagy to maintain the cellular homeostasis for the optimal levels of intracellular macromolecules and atp .
non - canonical pathways of autophagosomal degradation by bypassing the canonical pathway have been identified.36 in case of emergency , most of the translational activities are decreased except stress - related proteins .
the non - canonical autophagy may enable cells to cope with cellular emergencies promptly and efficiently .
here , we found that rack1 knockdown induces non - canonical autophagic flux .
we confirmed induction of events downstream of lc3 , including lc3 puncta , increments in lamp1 and lamp2 protein levels , and degradation of p62 / sqstm1 .
furthermore , with atg7 knockout mef , we clearly demonstrated that rack1 - induced autophagy is activated via an atg7 independent manner ( figure 5d ) .
these data suggest that ribosomal rack1 depletion promotes non - canonical autophagy that is dependent on lc3 , but differs from canonical autophagy , which requires ulk1 , conjugated atg5 / 12 , atg7 and beclin1 .
rack1 knockdown also increased the level of bcl - xl protein ( figure 3a ) , followed by a significant increase in the bcl - xl - beclin1 interaction , indicating the repression of canonical autophagy ( figures 2f and 3c ) .
it has been recently known that arsenite induces autophagy.48 , 49 , 50 , 51 moreover , smith et al.52 suggested that arsenic trioxide induces non - canonical autophagy .
arimoto et al.47 also showed that rack1 is recruited into stress granules under stress conditions .
moreover , lc3 - associated non - canonical autophagy has been discovered to promote immune responses through activation of antigen presentation and control of interferon production , suggesting that non - canonical autophagy might play a crucial role in the response to extracellular stimuli.53 therefore , we supposed that rack1 depletion - induced non - canonical autophagy might also play a role in the physiological circumstances .
emerging evidence suggests that ribosome heterogeneity resulting from the alteration of ribosomal components regulates the selective translation of specific mrnas.54 similarly , ribosomal rack1 contributes to the selective translation of specific mrnas,55 and is involved in ires - dependent translation after viral infection stress.17 here , as global translation and polysomal fraction were slightly decreased in rack1 sirna - transfected cells ( supplementary figures s4c and d ) , depletion of ribosomal rack1 affects the translation of specific mrnas , such as lc3 and bcl - xl ( figure 5b ) .
thus , in rack1 sirna - transfected cells , translation of specific mrnas is dependent on the presence of ribosomal rack1 in the ribosome complex .
we differentiated the role of ribosomal rack1 from that of non - ribosomal or cytoplasmic rack1 .
rack1 plays various roles in the cytoplasm .
however , because rack1 has no catalytic domain,3 its roles vary according to its cellular localization and binding partners .
consequently , rack1 could have diverse effects on physiological phenomena , depending on the cellular context .
for example , rack1 can promote tumorigenicity of non - small - cell lung cancer through hedgehog signaling,56 and the proliferation , invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer.57 in contrast , a lack of rack1 could induce metastasis of gastric cancer through mirna - mediated mechanisms.58 although we found that ribosomal rack1 depletion induces non - canonical autophagy , it is possible that rack1 contributes to other steps in autophagic flux due to its interactions with diverse binding partners .
in fact , rack1 is related to the upstream signaling pathway of canonical autophagic flux.21 , 59 on the contrary to these previous studies , our results indicate that loss of ribosomal rack1 induces non - canonical autophagic flux increased the downstream event of lc3 .
using the rack1 de mutant , we confirmed that our findings were due to depletion of ribosomal rack1 but not non - ribosomal rack1 , which is not associated with the ribosome complex , as shown in figure 6 .
however , we hypothesize that non - ribosomal rack1 disappeared earlier than ribosomal rack1 during rack1 sirna treatment .
indeed , rack1 depletion - induced autophagy was dependent on the sirna concentration and the incubation time after sirna treatment ( supplementary figures s1b and c ) .

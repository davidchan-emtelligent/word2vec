motivation : establishing phospholipid identities in large lipidomic datasets is a labour - intensive process .
where genomics and proteomics capitalize on sequence - based signatures , glycerophospholipids lack easily definable molecular fingerprints .
carbon chain length , degree of unsaturation , linkage , and polar head group identity must be calculated from mass to charge ( m / z ) ratios under defined mass spectrometry ( ms ) conditions .
given increasing ms sensitivity , many m / z values are not represented in existing prediction engines .
to address this need , visualization and phospholipid identification is a web - based application that returns all theoretically possible phospholipids for any m / z value and ms condition .
visualization algorithms produce multiple chemical structure files for each species .
curated lipids detected by the canadian institutes of health research training program in neurodegenerative lipidomics are provided as high - resolution structures .
availability : valid is available through the canadian institutes of health research training program in neurodegenerative lipidomics resources web site at https :// www.med.uottawa.ca / lipidomics / resources.html .

1 introduction the past 10 years have seen remarkable advances in high performance liquid chromatography , electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ms ) .
coupled with careful biochemistry enabling the separation of membranes and , in some cases , membrane microdomains , adaptation of these technologies to the study of lipids is permitting comprehensive phospholipid profiling at the molecular level .
the emerging field of lipidomics faces three main analytical challenges : ( i ) a paucity of bioinformatic tools for spectral analysis ; ( ii ) the need for accurate lipid prediction algorithms before experimenters can proceed to empirical validation ; ( iii ) a requirement for visual tools capable of displaying all theoretically possible lipid conformations in 2d and 3d .
the most comprehensive tool kit has been developed by the lipid maps consortium representing > 37 000 lipid species .
the majority of their curated ms data has been generated using mouse leukemic monocyte - macrophage cells and , while extensive , does not yet represent all biological lipids .
to our knowledge , none of the existing open - access web - based engines have capacity to predict identity of every m / z value detected in different ms spectra ( supplementary table s1 ) .
visualization and phospholipid identification ( valid ) is a comprehensive , simple to use , resource enabling rapid prediction of these tissue - specific lipid ' unknowns ' .
2 tool description and functionality 2.1 database content the valid database contains exact and average masses ( de laeter et al. , 2003 ) for all theoretically possible : ( i ) phosphocholines ; ( ii ) phosphoserines ; ( iii ) phosphoethanolamines ; ( iv ) glycerophosphates ; ( v ) glyceropyrophosphates ; ( vi ) glycerophosphoglycerols ; ( vii ) glycerophosphoglycerolphosphates ; and ( viii ) cytidine 5 ' - diphosphate 1,2 - diacyl - sn - glycerols .
the database includes lyso - and phospholipids with 1 to 30 carbons in each chain and up to six cis unsaturations .
calculations consider ester , alkyl ether and vinyl ether linkages .
numerical datasets are in excel ( tm ) files .
2.2 software requirements valid requires a javatm - enabled internet browser .
2.3 using valid to predict lipid identity the valid search engine predicts lipid identity taking into consideration user - specific ms conditions ( fig. 1 ) .
the search engine is coded in java ( tm ) .
the excel files are read with jexcelapi .
users choose exact or average mass before inputting their m / z of interest .
simple pull - down menus restrict carbon chain lengths and linkages within phospholipid classes while considering appropriate ion type .
predictions appear in two panels : ( i ) possible lipids include and ( ii ) possible isomeric lipids include .
the first panel returns lipid identities with arbitrarily assigned sn - 1 and sn - 2 carbon chains .
the second panel lists corresponding isomers .
list position is ordered by lipid subclass ( polar head group ) and sorted by ascending ( i ) m / z ; ( ii ) number of carbons ( sn - 1 chain ) ; ( iii ) degree of unsaturation ( sn - 1 chain ) ; ( iv ) number of carbons ( sn - 2 chain ) ; and ( v ) degree of unsaturation ( sn - 2 chain ) .
nomenclature adheres to the lipid maps classification system ( fahy et al. , 2011 ) .
to assist in decision - making , a ' best guess' feature is available whereby lipids in blue are considered ' most likely ' based on the prevalence of constituent fatty acids in mammalian cells ( miyazaki and ntambi , 2008 ) .
lipids in red indicate that ( i ) the species is part of our canadian institutes of health research training program in neurodegenerative lipidomics ( ctpnl ) - curated database of neural lipids for which ( ii ) we have generated multiple high - resolution representations .
lipids in black represent theoretically possible combinations. fig. 1. the valid interface 2.4 displaying glycerophospholipid structures to display all theoretically possible phospholipid conformations , users can highlight the lipid of interest and click on the ' display all ' button .
the valid algorithm is confined to drawing cis double bonds separated by a minimum of two carbons .
using jexcelapi , valid calculates where each atom should be in 2d - space and generates 2d representations displayed using chemaxon 's marvin view 5.5.1.0 .
marvin view enables the user to toggle through structural views and save each species in a variety of formats .
chemical structures are drawn in accordance to the standards developed by the lipid maps consortium ( fahy et al. , 2011 ) .
the ' best prediction ' button displays only those lipid species found in valid 's predicted to be common database .
the ' structural representations' button displays lipids that are part of valid 's curated structural representations database identified in neural tissue by ctpnl researchers .
these species can be viewed in high - resolution as ( i ) 2d skeletal models ; ( ii ) 3d ball and stick models ; ( iii ) space filling models ; or ( iv ) rendered ' valid view ' models .
valid view models were assembled in chemdraw3d ( r ) , translated into a 3d model where each atom was marked by an x , y and z coordinate and exported into autodesk ( r ) maya ( r ) v2012 .
rigid and dynamic models were derived using maya ( r ) nparticles , converted into smooth polygonal meshes .
these meshes were directed to the original x , y and z coordinates and imported as points in space to recapitulate the original molecular structure in an abstracted , organic , form .
resulting valid view models are available for download as rigid polygons .
they are also available on request fitted with a rig of movable joints between atoms , a process typically used by graphic artists to animate human or animal characters , to facilitate membrane reconstruction and modelling .
3 conclusion valid is a web - based application linking a convenient search engine , a phospholipid database and multiple visualization features for identification and dissemination of large - scale lipidomic datasets .
valid returns all theoretically possible species based on m / z and user - defined ms conditions .
the user is cautioned that valid includes lipids ( and isomeric bond configurations ) that may not be biologically relevant .
investigators are encouraged to mine these lists for species most relevant to their specific biological system for subsequent validation .
to assist in decision - making , a ' best guess' feature is available to focus on lipids predicted to be common based on the prevalence of the fatty acid chains in mammalian cells .
every theoretical conformation ( in cis configuration ) for each species can be viewed in 2d and 3d .
curated species can also be downloaded in multiple high - resolution representations for further visualization and model production .

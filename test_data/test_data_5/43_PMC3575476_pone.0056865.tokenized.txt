dendritic cells initiate adaptive immune responses , leading either to control cancer by effector t cells or to exacerbate cancer by regulatory t cells that inhibit ifn - gamma - mediated th1 - type response .
dendritic cells can also induce th17 - type immunity , mediated by il - 17a .
however , the controversial role of this cytokine in cancer requires further investigations .
we generated dendritic cells from peripheral blood monocytes to investigate lifespan , phenotype and chemoresistance of dendritic cells , treated with il - 17a with or without ifn - gamma .
studying the expression of bcl - 2 family members , we demonstrated that dendritic cells constitutively express one pro - survival bcl - 2 member : mcl1 .
immature dendritic cells were cd40lowhladrlow cd1a + mcl1 + , did not express cd14 , cd68 or bcl2a1 , and displayed a short 2 - day lifespan .
il - 17a - treated dc exhibited a semi - mature ( cd40high hladrlow ) pre - m2 ( ccl22 + cd206 + cd163 + il1rn + il - 10 - cxcl10 - il - 12 - ) mixed ( cd1a + cd14 + cd68 +) macrophage - dendritic cell phenotype .
they efficiently exerted mannose receptor - mediated endocytosis and did not produce superoxide anions , in the absence of tlr engagement .
interestingly , il - 17a promoted a long - term survival of dendritic cells , beyond 12 days , that correlated to bcl2a1 induction , a pro - survival bcl - 2 family member .
bcl2a1 transcription was activated by nf - kappab , downstream of il - 17a transduction .
thus , immature dendritic cells only express mcl1 , whereas il - 17a - treated dendritic cells concomitantly expressed two pro - survival bcl - 2 family members : mcl1 and bcl2a1 .
these latter developed chemoresistance to 11 of the 17 chemotherapy agents tested .
however , high doses of either vinblastine or cytarabine decreased mcl1 expression and induced dendritic cell death .
when il - 17a is produced in vivo , administration of anti - il - 17a biotherapy may impair dendritic cell survival by targeting bcl2a1 expression .
consequently , depending on the effector or regulatory role of dendritic cells , blocking il - 17a , may be either dangerous or beneficial for cancer outcomes , thus contributing to the apparent controversy around the role of il - 17a in cancer .

introduction about 15 % of human cancers are associated with inflammation [ 1 ] .
a topical question is whether it can be advantageous to add biotherapy to conventional chemotherapy for affected patients .
crohn 's disease and sjogren 's syndrome are il - 17a - dependent chronic inflammatory diseases that are associated with an increased risk of colon cancer [ 2 ] and lymphoma [ 3 ] , respectively .
il - 17a is a proinflammatory cytokine associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases [ 4 ] , which regulates the activities of nf - kappab transcription factor and mitogen - activated protein kinases to stimulate the expression of il - 6 , cyclooxygenase - 2 and nitric oxide .
its receptor is composed of il - 17ra and il - 17rc .
il - 17ra is ubiquitously expressed , with particularly high levels in immune cells , while il - 17rc is preferentially expressed in non - immune cells [ 5 ] .
it is not clear how myeloid cells , which are il - 17ra +/ il - 17rc - , bind il - 17a .
recent crystallographic and computational analysis have suggested that il - 17ra is a common chain shared by all receptors [ 6 ] , and the exact contribution of il - 17rc is under investigations .
the role of il - 17a in cancer remains controversial with protumor ( pro - angiogenic ) versus antitumor ( immune ) effects .
in mouse models of fibrosarcoma or colon adenocarcinoma , over - expression of il - 17a by cancer cells increased tumor growth [ 7 ] .
this effect was indirectly mediated by a vegf - dependent pro - angiogenic activity. by contrast , in hematopoietic tumors such as mastocytoma or plasmacytoma , il - 17a prevented tumor development by increasing the generation of tumor specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes [ 8 ] .
this effect is probably also indirect since activation of naive cd8 + t lymphocytes usually relies on ifn - gamma - mediated th1 - type response and primarily requires dendritic cells ( dc ) , presenting tumor peptides on their mhc molecules .
the role of il - 17a on dc is therefore a challenge to address .
since more than twenty years , immunologists have studied the biology of monocyte - derived dc , obtained with gm - csf and il - 4 , in vitro .
the in vivo relevance was finally established in the mouse in 2010 [ 9 ] .
we have reported that il - 17a robustly activates survival pathways in monocyte - derived dc , but not monocytes , in vitro [ 10 ] .
however , the il - 17a - dependent mechanism that controls dc survival has not been established .
proteins of the b - cell lymphoma 2 ( bcl - 2 ) family regulate survival and sensitivity to apoptosis by governing mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway [ 11 ] .
the main function of the pro - survival bcl - 2 proteins is to counteract the activation of the pro - apoptotic bcl - 2 proteins which include the bh3 - only proteins , bak and bax .
once activated , bh3 - only proteins activate bax or bak that form pore in the outer mitochondrial membrane , mediating cytochrome c release .
thus , pro - survival members can either directly inhibit bax , bak or sequester and inactivate bh3 - only proteins in the cytoplasm .
myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 ( mcl1 ) was first discovered as a pro - survival member in a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line [ 12 ] .
bcl - 2 - related protein a1 ( bcl2a1 ) , discovered in 1995 in b cell lymphoma , is another pro - survival member preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
due to their central function in the apoptotic machinery , bcl - 2 proteins are often deregulated in the sense of a pro - survival effect , in cancer .
small molecules that inhibit pro - survival bcl - 2 proteins in cancer cells counteract chemoresistance and cure cancer in a high percentage of mice [ 15 ] .
in this study , we reveal that the long - term survival mechanism induced by il - 17a in human dc is under the control of bcl2a1 induction .
in addition , we studied the phenotype and chemoresistance of il - 17a - treated dc to 17 drugs , in vitro , and provide new insights on combining cytotoxic compounds with anti - il - 17a biotherapy .
materials and methods healthy donors we obtained blood samples from healthy adult volunteers at the etablissement francais du sang ( lyon , france ) .
the local ethics committee ( research committee for the hospices civils de lyon ) approved this study and we obtained written informed consent from each subject ( national procedure used for blood donations ) .
reagents we purchased recombinant human gm - csf , ifn - gamma , il - 4 and il - 17a from peprotech ( neuilly - sur - seine , france ) .
flow cytometry : cd14 , cd68 , cd1a , hla - dr , cd40 , cd206 , cd163 and isotype controls were purchased from becton dickinson ( le pont de claix , france ) , anti - bcl2a1 ( 3401 anti - a1 ) from biovision ( san francisco , usa ) , anti - mcl1 ( y37 ) from abcam ( cambridge , uk ) and bay - 11 - 7085 ( 2 microm ) , inhibitor of the classical nf - kappab pathway , from calbiochem ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) .
toxic compounds : dexamethasone , 6 - mercaptopurine and fludarabine were purchased from sigma aldrich ( st louis , mo , usa ) and the remaining drugs were kindly provided by the karolinska university hospital pharmacy ( see methods s1 ) .
cultures cd14 + monocytes were purified (> 95 % cd14 +) from the peripheral blood by ficoll and percoll gradients , followed by negative magnetic depletion of cells expressing cd3 or cd56 or cd19 .
monocytes were treated 6 days with 50 ng / ml gm - csf and 500 u / ml il - 4 in rpmi ( life technologies , carlsbad , ca , usa ) supplemented with 10 % fcs , 10mm hepes , 2 mm l - glutamine , 40 microg / ml gentamicin ( life technologies ) [ 16 ] .
cytokines were then removed by washing dc twice in cytokine - free medium .
flow cytometry analysis was routinely used for quality control of the immature dc phenotype cd14 - cd1a + mhc - ii + cd83 - (> 98 %) , in vitro .
the very day , dc at day 0 , were seeded at 4,800 cells / mm2 in the presence or not ( none ) of il - 17a with or without ifn - gamma .
cytokines were added at 2 ng / ml , otherwise indicated on the figure , and replenished every week .
toxic compounds were added either concomitantly with il - 17a and ifn - gamma or 24 hours later , as indicated .
dc survival and fusion efficiency quantification by trap and hoechst staining in long - term cultures , cells became adherent and underwent cell fusion .
as previously described [ 10 ] , [ 16 ] , we analyzed survival and cell fusion after tartrate resistant acidic phosphatase ( trap ) and hoechst double staining .
we used the leukocyte acid phosphatase kit ( sigma - aldrich ) to visualize the cytoplasm stained by the pink product resulting from trap activity .
then we stained the nuclei with 10 microg / ml of hoechst 33342 ( sigma ) , a blue fluorescent dna dye , for 30 min at 37degreesc .
after two washes and fixation with 1 % formaldehyde , we counted ( n ) the total number of active nuclei in viable mono or multi - nucleated cells , per well , over time .
106 dc per well were put in culture , at day 0 .
survival percentage was calculated : [( n )/ 106x100 ] .
we counted ( n ) the total number of nuclei included in mgc , per well .
cells were considered as mgc when containing strictly more than 2 nuclei .
then we calculated the fusion efficiency as the percentage of the total nuclei , included in mgc : [( n )/( n ) x100 ] .
cfse and cd14 - pe labeling for proliferation study dc were suspended at 107 cells / ml in alpha - mem containing 2 % fcs .
after 15 minutes of incubation in the presence of 10 microm carboxyfluorescein diacetate , succinimidyl ester ( cfse ) , the cfse incorporation was blocked by the addition of a large excess of alpha - mem , containing 2 % fcs [ 16 ] .
dc were then washed twice by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4degreesc in alpha - mem containing 2 % fcs and seeded in alpha - mem containing 10 % fcs with indicated cytokines .
cells were then harvested at day 7 by a trypsin treatment ( sigma - aldrich ) and scraping , and finally immunostained with a cd14 - pe antibody .
the expression of cd14 - pe and cfse was quantified on an lsrii ( becton dickinson ) and analyzed using flowjo software .
dioc6 and pi labeling for cell survival quantification by flow cytometry from day 0 to 7 , > 95 % of the il - 17a - treated dc were mononucleated .
cell survival was analyzed by flow cytometry after dioc6 ( 3 ) ( 3,39 - diexyloxacarbocyanine ) and propidium iodide ( pi ) double staining .
cells were incubated 15 min at 37degreesc with 40 nm dioc6 ( molecular probes ) in culture medium to evaluate mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( deltapsim ) .
viable cells have stable deltapsim whereas deltapsim decreases with cell commitment to apoptosis .
pi ( 0.5 microg / ml ) was added before flow cytometry analysis of the cells and incorporated into dna of dead cells whose membrane is permeabilized .
apoptotic cells are dioc6 - pi + , while living cells are dioc6 + pi - . 106 dc / well ( survival > 98 %) were seeded at 4,800 cells / mm2 , at day 0 .
the total number of viable cells per well was quantified by a time - monitored flow cytometry analysis during 2 min at high speed ( 1 microl / s ) .
cell survival was calculated as the percentage of viable cells at day 7 related to day 0 , for 106 dc introduced at day 0 .
in absence of cell division , cell death percentage is the complement of the survival percentage to 100 .
flow cytometry staining immunostaining of cells was performed in 1 % bsa and 3 % human serum - pbs .
we used 2 microg / ml of primary or secondary pe - f ( ab ') 2 goat to mouse igg , 115 - 086 - 062 , jackson immunoresearch ( west grove , pa , usa ) antibodies .
for intracytoplasmic staining , we blocked the golgi apparatus with bd golgistop ( tm ) , fixed and permeabilized the cells with the cytofix / cytoperm reagents according to procedures from the manufacturer ( becton dickinson ) .
fluorescence was quantified on a lsrii ( becton dickinson ) and analyzed using flowjo software .
affymetrix genechip study rna was purified from dc , either untreated , or cultured for 12 days with indicated cytokines : after cell lysis , extraction in trizol ( invitrogen , saint aubin , france ) and purification on megaclear column ambion ( invitrogen ) to reach an rna integrity number > 9 with agilent bioanalyser , " profilexpert " ( www.profilexpert.fr ) performed the chip study ( see methods s1 ) .
functional analysis of mr - mediated endocytosis the endocytotic capacity of cells was analyzed with dextran fitc , a probe for mr - mediated endocytosis .
as , in addition to receptor - mediated endocytosis , there is some uptake of dextran fitc by pinocytosis , preincubation with mannan was performed to block the mr - mediated endocytosis and delineate mr - mediated endocytosis from the background fluorescence of dextran fitc uptake by pinocytosis .
cells were cooled down in an ice water bath .
time course studies were performed at 0 , 10 and 30 min by re - warming the cells in a water bath to 37degreesc in the presence of dextran fitc ( 1 mg / ml ) , or a 10 min pre - incubation with mannan ( 1 mg / ml ) followed by dextran fitc ( 1 mg / ml ) .
for quantitative evaluation of the receptor density , two - dimensional dot plot analysis was performed for the respective monocytes , derived dc , and these dc treated for 7 days with il - 17a .
populations were gated out manually .
the mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) of the fitc signal was determined and fluorescent dye uptake was quantified by calculating the fluorescent index ( fi ) for the different time points : fi = [ mfi ( 10 , 30 min ) - mfi ( 0 min )]/ mfi ( 0 min ) .
this normalization procedure makes the entire procedure resistant against donor variability .
real - time quantitative pcr total rna from 2 millions of cells was extracted using trizol ( r ) ( invitrogen ) and rneasy mini kit ( r ) ( qiagen , dusseldorf , germany ) to reach an rna integrity number > 9 with agilent bioanalyzer .
rt - pcr reactions were performed with superscript ( r ) ii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen ) .
one microg total rna was reverse - transcribed using oligo ( dt ) 12 - 18 primers ( invitrogen ) .
for expression studies , 25 ng of cdna were amplified in stratagene mx3000p apparatus ( agilent technologies ) , using the quantitect ( r ) sybr ( r ) green pcr kit ( qiagen ) .
primer sequences were as follows : bcl2a1 , aca ggc tgg ctc agg act atct ( forward ) , ctc tgg acg ttt tgc ttg gac ( reverse ) ; gapdh , cac cca ctc ctc cac ctt tgac ( forward ) , gtc cac cac cct gtt gct gtag ( reverse ) ; tbp , quantitect ( r ) primers specific hs _ tbp _ 1 _ sg quantitect primer assay ( qiagen ) .
all samples were normalized to expression of gapdh or tbp .
western blot analysis three millions cells were harvested , sonicated and lysed 1 h at 4degreesc with ripa buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail ( roche , indianapolis , usa ) .
cellular debris were pelleted by centrifugation ( 10,000 g 15 min at 4degreesc ) and protein extracts ( 100 microg per lane ) were loaded onto a 12 % sds - polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto pvdf sheet ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca , usa ) .
filters were blocked with 5 % bsa in pbs / 0.1 % tween 20 ( pbs - t ) for 2 h and then incubated over - night at 4degreesc with anti - bcl2a1 / bfl1 , 0.9 microg / ml in pbs - t ( rabbit polyclonal ab75887 , abcam , cambridge , uk ) .
after three washes with pbs - t , filters were incubated 1 h with biotin - conjugated goat anti - rabbit igg , 2 microg / ml in pbs - t , 5 % bsa ( molecular probes / invitrogen , eugene , oregon , usa ) .
after three washes with pbs - t , filters were incubated 1 h with hrp - conjugated streptavidin ( streptactin - hrp , bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca , usa ) dilution 1:50,000 in pbs - t , 5 % bsa .
detection was performed using immun - startm westernctm kit chemiluminescence system ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca , usa ) .
actin staining was realized using a rabbit polyclonal anti - betaactin from santa cruz ( sc - 130656 , santa cruz , ca , usa ) .
immunocytofluorescence labeling of p65 / rela 4x105 monocyte - derived dendritic cells were cultured in 8 - well lab - tek ( tm ) chamber slide ( tm ) system ( nunc , thermo scientific ) , eventually with il - 17a ( 2 ng / ml ) .
at the indicated times , the chamber slides were gently centrifugated and cells were fixed with pbs containing 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4degreesc .
cells were permeabilized with pbs containing 0.2 % triton x - 100 for 20 minutes at room temperature .
after saturation ( 30 minutes at room temperature in pbs 1 % bsa , 3 % human serum ) , cells were incubated 2 h with 4 microg / ml p65 / anti - rela in pbs 1 % bsa ( c - 20 , santa cruz biotechnology , california , usa ) .
after 3 washes in pbs 1 % bsa , cells were incubated 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark with alexa fluor 647 goat anti - rabbit igg ( 10 microg / ml , molecular probes , invitrogen , carlsbad , california usa ) .
after 3 washes , cells were mounted in dako fluorescent mounting medium ( dako , denmark ) , and immunostaining images were analyzed using a leica tcs - sp5 laser scanning confocal microscope ( leica , wetzlar , germany ) .
statistical analysis polynomial statistical analysis and mann - whitney u test from graphpad prism 5 software were applied to detect differences between subgroups ; the cutoff level of p < 0.05 was regarded significant .
results il - 17a promotes long - term survival of a new non - proliferating myeloid cell subset with a pre - m2 macrophage - dc phenotype dc lifespan controls the priming of adaptive immune responses .
in vitro - generated dc , from human monocytes cultured with gm - csf and il - 4 , cannot survive more than 48 h in cytokine - free medium or with ifn - gamma alone ( fig. 1a ) .
notably , il - 17a treatment rescued around half of dc from death , and these cells then survived long - term in culture , without gm - csf and il - 4 , if il - 17a was replenished once a week .
in the presence of il - 17a , no dc proliferation was observed ( fig. 1b ) .
il - 17a dose - dependently induced dc survival ( fig. 1c ) .
ifn - gamma had no effect on il - 17a - induced survival , whereas it potentiated il - 17a - induced dc fusion quantified at day 12 ( fig. 1d ) .
in the presence of gm - csf and il - 4 , cd14 + cd1a - human monocytes differentiated into cd14 - cd68 - cd1a + hla - dr + cd40low immature dc ( fig. 1e ) .
il - 17a - treated dc still expressed the cd1a dc marker at 48 h , but also acquired macrophage ( cd14 / cd68 ) markers .
the intensity of hla - dr remained unchanged , while the cd40 expression was upregulated by il - 17a treatment .
addition of ifn - gamma did not affect the il - 17a - mediated semi - mature mixed dc - macrophage phenotype .
the up - regulation of csf1 by il - 17a reinforced the csf1 / csf1r axis in the dc ( fig. s1 ) .
therefore the phenotype of il - 17a - treated dc may be closer to a macrophage rather than a dc. we studied whether these myeloid cells were polarized towards m1 or m2 type macrophages ( fig. 2 ) .
we studied the m1 and m2 genes in monocytes , dc and il - 17a - treated dc. although the il - 17a - treated dc did not exhibit all the characteristics of m1 or m2 macrophages , their phenotype looked like a pre - m2 phenotype with high expressions of ccl22 , cd206 , cd163 and il1rn ( il - 1 receptor antagonist ) mrnas , while the m1 genes were weakly or not expressed ( fig. 2a ) .
flow cytometry confirmed high cd206 ( mannose receptor ) and cd163 protein expressions in il - 17a - treated dc ( fig. 2b ) .
as assessed by the uptake of dextran - fitc , cd206 - mediated endocytosis was functional in il - 17a - treated dc ( fig. 2c ) .
in the absence of toll receptor engagement , we noticed neither an activated m2 microenvironment , since il - 4 , il - 13 and il - 10 were not detected ( in the transcriptome and by elisa ) , nor an activated m1 microenvironment , since ifn - gamma , il - 1beta , il - 12 and superoxide anion production ( nitro blue tetrazolium assay ) were also below the technical background ( data not shown ) .
altogether , these data demonstrate that il - 17a strongly modifies the human dc phenotype into cd1a + cd14 + cd68 + long - term surviving mono and multinucleated myeloid cells , displaying a pre - m2 non - activated phenotype .

statistical significance was determined by the mann - whitney test , * , significant p < 0.05 ; ** , very significant p < 0.01 .
il - 17a treatment administrated for ( a ) 12 days and ( b,c ) 48 hours .
il - 17a induced bcl2a1 transcription in human dc we studied the bcl - 2 family gene expression that regulates cell survival in monocyte - derived dc in four donors .
untreated dc expressed five pro - apoptotic genes ( bax , bcl2l11 , bcl2l13 , bid and bnip3 ) and one pro - survival gene ( mcl1 ) ( fig. 3a ) .
untreated dc hardly survived 48 h ( fig. 1a ) , indicating that mcl1 was not sufficient to maintain dc survival .
large scale transcriptome analysis was performed in parallel on the same dc cultured 12 days with il - 17a , alone or combined with ifn - gamma .
as generally observed for hematopoietic tissue , we found that il - 17ra was expressed in immature dc , whereas il - 17rc mrna was below the threshold level of detection ( data not shown ) .
exposure to il - 17a , which induced long - term survival , resulted in a major activation of bcl2a1 transcription , while mcl1 , bcl2l11 and bid mrna amounts decreased to about half , and bnip3 increased three - fold ( fig. 3a ) .
contrary to the pro - apoptotic genes whose expression was overall weak , both mcl1 and bcl2a1 pro - survival genes were highly expressed in il - 17a - treated dc , as illustrated by the fold change heat map , after 12 days of il - 17a treatment ( fig. 3b ) .
early induction of bcl2a1 by il - 17a was further confirmed by quantitative rt - pcr in three additional donors at day two of culture ( fig. 3c ) .
the increase of fold inductions between day 2 and day 12 ( fig. 3c and 3a ) revealed high accumulation of bcl2a1 mrna under the control of il - 17a .
we then studied intracellular expression of mcl1 and bcl2a1 proteins by flow cytometry after membrane permeabilization ( fig. 4a ) or by western blot analysis after cell lysis ( fig. 4b and 4c ) .
both techniques established that il - 17a induced bcl2a1 in mcl1 + dc from three additional donors .
despite its role on cell fusion , addition of ifn - gamma regulated neither bcl2a1 mrna expression ( fig. 3a - c ) , nor bcl2a1 protein expression ( fig. 4c ) .
therefore , il - 17a - treated dc , with or without ifn - gamma , strongly co - express the pro - survival proteins mcl1 and bcl2a1 .

bcl2a1 expression induced by il - 17a enhances human dc lifespan our results suggest that co - expression of the mcl1 and bcl2a1 pro - survival genes in dc may support il - 17a - dependent long - term cell survival .
dose responses of il - 17a were performed on dc from three donors and showed that il - 17a increased dc survival in a dose - dependent manner ( plateau at 1 - 2 ng / ml ) ( fig. 5a ) .
as introduction of sh / sirna by lipofection or nucleofection affected survival and phenotype of stimulated dc in the control experiment , we could not directly investigate the consequences of bcl2a1 mrna blockade ( data not shown ) .
therefore , we used a statistical approach to study the putative link introduced by il - 17a treatment on the three parameters that we quantified : dc survival , and bcl2a1 and mcl1 expression ( fig. 5a - c ) .
statistical analysis showed that the ability of dc to survive was correlated to bcl2a1 expression by a two parameter degree 2 polynomial with a correlation factor > 0.978 ( data not shown ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0056865.g005 figure 5 correlation studies between cell survival , mcl1 and bcl2a1 expression in il - 17a - treated dc. dc were cultured 7 days with il - 17a ( eight doses from 0.016 to 2 ng / ml ) .
flow cytometry analysis of ( a ) survival , assessed by dioc6 and pi staining , ( b ) bcl2a1 and ( c ) mcl1 intracellular expressions for three donors ( 5 , 8 , 9 ) , in separated experiments , sd < 2 % .
in conclusion , although constitutive mcl1 expression is sufficient for short - term ( 48 h ) survival of dc , additional high and persistent bcl2a1 expression , induced by il - 17a , is correlated with a long - term lifespan of dc ( beyond 12 days ) .
il - 17a induced nf - kappab translocation upstream to bcl2a1 expression in human dc the nuclear factor p65 / rela protein , a member of the nf - kappab transcription factor family , is a known regulator of bcl2a1 gene expression [ 17 ] , expressed in immature dc. therefore , we next investigated p65 / rela translocation in dc nuclei by immunofluorescence detection ( fig. 6a ) .
in untreated immature dc , p65 / rela was located in the cytoplasm , as demonstrated by fluorescent cytoplasm and black nuclei analyzed by confocal microscopy .
one hour after il - 17a stimulation , fluorescence stained nuclei in about 90 % of the dc. moreover , the nf - kappab inhibitor bay - 11 - 7085 blocked il - 17a - dependent bcl2a1 mrna induction in healthy dc ( fig. 6b ) .
in conclusion , il - 17a stimulation induces nf - kappab p65 / rela subunit translocation , thus activating a high and stable expression of the pro - survival bcl2a1 protein in human dc .

bcl2a1 - expressing dc develop chemoresistance bcl2a1 is known to confer chemoresistance in b cell leukemia [ 18 ] .
consequently , we investigated whether dc also acquire chemoresistance when they express bcl2a1 .
in vivo , it would be interesting to kill cancer cells , while dc survive to prime ifn - gamma - mediated anti - tumor activity .
therefore we studied chemoresistance of il - 17a - stimulated dendritic cells , in the presence of ifn - gamma , in vitro .
we tested 17 chemotherapy agents targeting glucocorticoid receptors , calcineurin , dna synthesis , topoisomerase ii or microtubules ( fig. 7a , table s1 ) .
dc were cultured with il - 17a and ifn - gamma .
toxic compounds were added together with cytokines .
we analyzed cell death 4 , 24 and 72 hours later .
we observed no cytotoxic effect of four glucocorticoids , fludarabine or etoposide , and unexpected pro - survival effects of dexamethasone , two calcineurin inhibitors , 6 - mercaptopurine and methotrexate .
on the contrary , cladribine ( 2cda ) , cytarabine ( arac ) , cisplatin ( cis ) , doxorubicin ( dox ) , vinblastine ( vbl ) and vincristine ( vcr ) killed cytokine - stimulated dc. noticeably , dc were resistant to some drugs but not to others , even if the drugs belong to the same group .
2cda , arac , cis , dox , vbl and vcr displayed the same effect on il - 17a - treated dc , with or without ifn - gamma ( data not shown ) .
dose response studies showed that cis , dox and 2cda killed only at high doses , exceeding the therapeutic doses ( fig. 7b - d ) while , interestingly , vcr , vbl and arac killed at moderate doses ( fig. 7e - g ) .
we observed that 24 h of pre - incubation with the cytokines facilitated dc killing by cis while , it conversely protected dc from death induced by low doses of vbl or arac .
vbl and dox were effective already at four hours ( fig. 7h ) .
optimal death was obtained at 24 hours with vcr and cis , and at 72 hours with arac and 2cda .
altogether , these data demonstrate that il - 17a and ifn - gamma - stimulated dc are chemoresistant to 11 of the 17 chemotherapy agents tested but they are highly sensitive to vbl and arac , at concentrations observed in clinical settings .

mean and sd of a triplicate experiment representative of ( a ) n = 5 , ( b - g ) n = 3 and ( h ) n = 3 , sd below 10 % .
vbl and arac induced cell death by targeting mcl1 but not bcl2a1 40 - 60 % of mcl1 + bcl2a1 + dc survived in the presence of low doses of vbl or arac while high doses killed il - 17a and ifn - gamma - treated dc ( fig. 8a ) .
we next investigated the role of vbl and arac on mcl1 and bcl2a1 expression in dc. when dc underwent cell death in the presence of high doses of vbl or arac , bcl2a1 expression did not change contrary to mcl1 expression which was strongly decreased by either vbl or arac ( fig. 8b and 8c ) .
we stained microtubules , actin and nuclei to visualize that cytokines induced a giant microtubule network in giant cells ( fig. s2 ) which is disorganized by vbl .
in addition , it was possible to reverse bcl2a1 expression by adding anti - il - 17a blocking antibodies after bcl2a1 induction by il - 17a and this strategy ten times increased cell sensitivity to either vbl or arac ( data not shown ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0056865.g008 figure 8 survival and phenotype of dc cultured with vbl or arac .
dc were stimulated with il - 17a and ifn - gamma for 7 days .
according to their toxicity kinetic , vbl or arac were added in the culture at day 6 or 5 , respectively .
( a ) cell survival assessed by dioc6 and pi staining , at day 7 .
( b ) bcl2a1 and ( c ) mcl1 intracellular expressions were measured prior dioc6 and pi staining .
" low " doses of vbl and arac were 0.06 and 4 microm , respectively .
" high " doses were ten times more .
mean and sd of n = 5 .
therefore , we demonstrated that while survival is prolonged by il - 17a - mediated bcl2a1 up - regulation , vbl and arac induces death by down - regulating mcl1 expression , without affecting bcl2a1 .
overall , in the absence of mcl1 expression , bcl2a1 alone is unable to maintain dc alive , indicating that both bcl2a1 and mcl1 are mandatory to establish long - term dc survival .
discussion tumor - associated dc can either mount an anti - tumoral immune response or support tumor tolerance , thus their biology is central in carcinogenesis .
here , we provide original evidence that the usual pattern of short - time ( two days ) dc lifespan is significantly extended beyond 12 days by exposure of dc to il - 17a , in vitro .
interestingly , the pro - inflammatory il - 17a up - regulates macrophage markers in dc and induces , via nf - kappab , the expression of bcl2a1 .
the long - term surviving myeloid cells , expressing both bcl2a1 and mcl1 , do not proliferate but develop a chemoresistance to 11 of the 17 chemotoxic agents tested .
however , these chemoresistant myeloid cells were highly sensitive to vbl and arac that target mcl1 .
these data provide a rationale for novel therapeutic approaches , targeting both mcl1 and bcl2a1 in myeloid cells , which may be useful in the treatment of cancer whose development is sustained by tolerogenic dc. when il - 17a interacts with its receptor chain il - 17ra , act1 and traf6 are recruited and further activate nf - kappab [ 19 ] .
among the five nf - kappab proteins known in mammals , only rela was expressed in the transcriptome of il - 17a - stimulated dc. furthermore , a rela responsive element is located in the promoter of bcl2a1 gene and positively regulates bcl2a1 expression [ 17 ] .
in dc , we demonstrate that il - 17a activates nf - kappab p65 / rela subunit translocation , which then induces bcl2a1 transcription , as illustrated by the shut off operated by the nf - kappab inhibitor bay - 11 - 7085 .
independently of bcl2a1 , it was previously demonstrated that balance between nf - kappab and jnk / ap - 1 activity controls dc apoptosis : jnk / ap - 1 activity is under negative feedback control of nf - kappab and can execute apoptosis in dc [ 20 ] .
therefore nf - kappab inhibitors induce dc death , by licensing jnk / ap - 1 - mediated apoptosis .
finally , downstream of il - 17a signaling , nuclear translocation of nf - kappab provides the basis both for inhibiting jnk / ap - 1 - dependent apoptosis , and for up - regulating bcl2a1 - dependent survival , thus indicating an important unexpected function of bcl2a1 in dc , during il - 17a - driven inflammation .
our data demonstrate that il - 17a - induced bcl2a1 expression was correlated to the acquisition of long - term survival .
the function of bcl2a1 is to counteract the activation of the bh3 - only proteins bak and bax .
we showed that dc highly express mrna of bcl2l11 and bid .
bh3 profiling and fluorescence polarization assay has indicated that bcl2a1 binds bcl2l11 , bid and bbc3 / puma [ 21 ] .
therefore , inhibition of the intrinsic apoptosis by bcl2a1 that ensures long - term survival of il - 17a - treated dc may result from the sequestration of bcl2l11 and bid bh3 - proteins by bcl2a1 .
in humans , bcl2a1 is widely expressed in lung , small intestine , testis and smooth muscle [ 22 ] .
early involved in fetal liver hematopoiesis , it is also induced later in life , upon tnf - alpha and il - 1beta treatment , in activated endothelial cells which then become protected from death [ 23 ] .
it has been suggested that bcl2a1 expression protects endothelial cells from death when they are exposed to inflammation - associated cellular toxins .
we showed that il - 17a is a pro - inflammatory cytokine that induces bcl2a1 expression in human dc , protecting them from death .
due to the specific function of dc in activating naive t cells , we suggest that , in addition to endothelial cell protection , il - 17a could be a molecular key to support the development of a chronic inflammation mediated by multiple dc - t cell crosstalks , due to increased life of mcl1 + bcl2a1 + dc. high bcl2a1 expression has been found to correlate with more severe cases of progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia , indicating that bcl2a1 contributes to apoptosis resistance [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
however , transgenic bcl2a1 mice do not develop lymphomas [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , suggesting that either bcl2a1 overexpression is not sufficient for tumorigenesis or bcl2a1 functions differ between mice and humans , as is the case of bcl2a1 cellular distribution .
more recently , human bcl2a1 mrna was found to be overexpressed in various solid tumors such as stomach , colon cancer , and breast cancer , skin squamous cell carcinoma , hepatocellular carcinoma and melanoma [ 28 ] .
the highest expression is predominantly associated with advanced disease stages [ 29 ] .
thus , human bcl2a1 is overexpressed in a variety of cancer cells , including hematological malignancies and solid tumors and contribute to tumor progression .
in addition to bcl2a1 expression , we also identified a pre - m2 phenotype in il - 17a - treated dc , opening the view that , in the absence of ifn - gamma , il - 17a - dependent myeloid cell plasticity may give rise to m2 - like tumor - associated macrophages [ 30 ] .
they generally present an il - 12lowil - 10high phenotype , less antigen presentation and tumoricidal capacity , and high expression of angiogenic factors such as vegf .
we found that il - 17a - treated dc highly express ccl22 .
in breast tumors , this chemokine attracts peripheral blood ccr4 + regulatory t cells , which are then selectively activated in lymphoid tumor infiltrates , thus preventing effector t cell activation , while sustaining immune escape , and ultimately tumor progression [ 31 ] .
high expression of bcl2a1 is associated to chemoresistance against fludarabine or etoposide in progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells , in vitro [ 18 ] , [ 32 ] .
conversely , silencing bcl2a1 sensitizes t or b cancer cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy or anti - cd19 biotherapy , in both cell lines and cells from patients [ 33 ] .
we document that il - 17a - treated dc develop chemoresistance to a wide range of toxic compounds ( 11 / 17 ) when they acquire bcl2a1 expression .
it was surprising that dc were resistant to some drugs and not others , even when they belong to the same group .
however , we could find some explanations in the literature .
cellular uptake of fludarabine requires dephosphorylation by phosphatases , in the body circulation , to produce arabinosyl - 2 - fluoroadenine , which can then be transported into the cells and become active [ 34 ] ; therefore failure of fludarabine to kill il - 17a - treated dc , in vitro , may be due to its inability to enter into dc. contrary to etoposide that affects only dividing cells , doxorubicin could affect non - dividing cells and the difference sensitivities to these anthracyclin antibiotics is already known for freshly generated monocyte - derived dc [ 35 ] .
it may come either from the higher ability of doxorubicin to produce superoxide anions that induce apoptosis , or from a differential drug effect on dna integrity , as previously shown on cancer cell lines [ 36 ] .
indeed , reversal of dna lesions rather than the occurrence of dna breaks plays a major role in cell survival .
dna lesions produced by doxorubicin persisted and even increased following drug removal while reversal of etoposide - induced dna breaks was associated to cell survival .
il - 17a - treated dc are nevertheless sensitive to high doses of vbl and arac , which target only mcl1 .
vbl appears to be more potent than arac , maybe due to its additional activity on microtubules .
indeed , both vbl and vcr , two related vinca alkaloids with close formulas , were previously known as microtubule depolymerizing drugs [ 37 ] .
interestingly , our studies extend the recently documented mcl1 degradation after vcr treatment [ 38 ] also to therapy with vbl .
anti - il - 17a biotherapy is currently developed for the treatment of inflammatory diseases .
transcriptional profiling recently characterized the tumor microenvironment and host inflammatory response in diffuse large b - cell lymphoma , which expresses bcl2a1 [ 14 ] .
according to the data set analysis , the authors suggested that tumor inflammation was chronic but ineffective .
they proposed to identify tumors with pre - existing abundant t cell and dc infiltrates and to further characterize their associated underlying immune response to perform immunomodulatory approaches as a treatment .
when the dc are tolerogenic , it is important to kill them as well as tumor cells , by suitable therapy .
il - 17a may stimulate angiogenesis and long - term survival of tolerogenic dc , thus driving tumor growth .
myeloid cells mediate suppression either directly or indirectly by activating regulatory t cells .
concomitant expressions of il - 17a , with or without ifn - gamma , pro - angiogenic vegf , pro - survival bcl2a1 and suppressive il - 10 [ 39 ] or free radical peroxynitrite [ 40 ] may indicate that il - 17a strongly supports cancer development .
our data obtained with human primary dc cultures delineate future personalized medicine combining anti - il - 17a biotherapy with ( vbl - or arac - based ) chemotherapy to counteract cancer cell survival in an il - 17a - rich tolerogenic microenvironment .

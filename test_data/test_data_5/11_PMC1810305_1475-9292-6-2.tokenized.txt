background current chemotherapy of human african trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness relies on drugs developed decades ago , some of which show toxic side effects .
one promising line of research towards the development of novel anti - trypanosomal drugs are small - molecule inhibitors of trypanosoma brucei cysteine proteinases .
results in this study , we demonstrate that treatment of t. brucei - infected mice with the inhibitor , carbobenzoxy - phenylalanyl - alanine - diazomethyl ketone ( z - phe - ala - chn2 ) , alters parasite morphology and inhibits cell division .
following daily intra - peritoneal administration of 250 mg kg - 1 of z - phe - ala - chn2 on days three and four post infection ( p.i. ) , stumpy - like forms with enlarged lysosomes were evident by day five p.i. in addition , trypanosomes exposed to the inhibitor had a 65 % greater protein content than those from control mice .
also , in contrast to the normal 16 % of parasites containing two kinetoplasts - a hallmark of active mitosis , only 4 % of trypanosomes exposed to the inhibitor were actively dividing , indicating cell cycle - arrest .
conclusion we suggest that inhibition of endogenous cysteine proteinases by z - phe - ala - chn2 depletes the parasite of essential nutrients necessary for dna synthesis , which in turn , prevents progression of the cell cycle .
this arrest then triggers differentiation of the long - slender into short - stumpy forms .
background trypanosoma brucei is the aetiological agent of human african trypanosomaisis or sleeping sickness .
at present there are only four drugs available for treatment of sleeping sickness and some of these induce serious side effects [ 1 ]. with this in mind , recent research has shown that small - molecule inhibitors of clan ca cysteine proteinases [ 2,3 ] kill t. brucei in vitro and alleviate parasitiemia in mouse models of the disease [ 4 - 7 ] .
as possible targets for these inhibitors , two cysteine proteinases have been identified .
the first , an ortholog of mammalian cathepsin b ( tbcatb ) , is a single copy gene and expressed in both procyclic and bloodstream forms , but with greater detectable mrna levels in the latter stage [ 8 ] .
as yet , its sub - cellular localization is unclear but may be in either the endosome and / or lysosome .
tetracycline - induced rnai of tbcatb resulted in dysmorphic parasites leading to cell death [ 8 ] , raising the possibility that tbcatb may be a useful molecular target for disease intervention .
the second potential target for cysteine proteinase inhibitors , termed trypanopain - tb [ 5 ] , brucipain [ 6 ] or rhodesain [ 9 ] , is a cathepsin l - like cysteine proteinase [ 10,11 ] encoded by 11 gene copies [ 12 ] and predominant in terms of enzymatic activity [ 9 ] .
inhibition of brucipain by the small molecule inhibitor , carbobenzoxy - phenylalanyl - alanine - diazomethyl ketone ( z - phe - ala - chn2 ) , correlated with the compound 's trypanocidal action in vivo [ 4 ] .
also , this and other peptidyl inhibitors blocked proteinolysis in the lysosome as evidenced by the accumulation of undigested fitc - transferrin [ 4,7 ] , data consistent with the lysosomal localization of brucipain using specific antibodies [ 9,13 ] .
brucipain is developmentally expressed , with approximately five - fold more protein found in short - stumpy forms than in either long - slender or procyclic forms [ 9 ] .
here , we demonstrate that z - phe - ala - chn2 when administered to mice infected with t. brucei results in parasites with altered cell morphology , a decreased capacity to degrade intracellular protein and an inability to mitotically replicate .
we discuss these findings with respect to the parasite proteases targeted by z - phe - ala - chn2 .
results to study the effect of z - phe - ala - chn2 on the cell morphology and cell division activity of bloodstream - form trypanosomes in vivo , mice infected with t. brucei were injected i.p. once daily on days 3 and 4 p.i. with 250 mg kg - 1 of the inhibitor or vehicle alone .
on day 5 p.i. , blood smears were prepared and parasites were isolated from infected blood .
for examining the cell morphology of the parasites by light microscopy , blood smears were stained with may - grunwald dye .
in the blood of control mice , a mixed population of dividing long - slender forms and cell - arrested short - stumpy forms was found ( fig. 1b ) , with significantly ( four times ) more long - slender forms .
in contrast , the blood of z - phe - ala - chn2 - treated mice contained few long - slender forms and almost all trypanosomes (> 90 %) appeared as stumpy - like forms ( fig. 1a ) .
in addition , a large blue - stained region was observed between the kinetoplast and the nucleus , i.e. , in a position consistent with that of the lysosome ( fig. 1a ). that this is the lysosome is corroborated by the fact that the may - grunwald dye stains acidic cell components .
long - slender and short - stumpy forms from control mice did not contain this structure ( fig. 1b ) .
figure 1 effect of z - phe - ala - chn2 on the morphology of t. brucei bloodstream forms in vivo .
mice that had been infected with the pleomorphic variant clone antat 1.1 were injected intraperitoneally with 250 mg kg - 1 of z - phe - ala - chn2 or vehicle alone on days 3 and 4 p.i. on day 5 p.i. , blood smears were prepared and stained with may - grunwald 's stain solution .
representative examples from z - phe - ala - chn2 - treated mice ( a ) and control mice ( b ) are shown .
trypanosomes exposed to the inhibitor appeared stumpy - like with a blue - stained region ( arrowhead ) between the kinetoplast and the nucleus , a location that is consistent with that of the lysosome in bloodstream forms .
k , kinetoplast ; n , nucleus ; ls , long - slender forms ; ss , short - stumpy forms .
upon electron microscopy , trypanosomes from z - phe - ala - chn2 - treated mice were considerably larger than those from control mice ( fig. 2 ) .
also , the lysosomes of trypanosomes exposed to the inhibitor were significantly larger than those of short - stumpy forms from control mice ( fig. 2 ) .
the enlargement of the lysosome may also explain why this organelle could be easily observed by light microscopy after may - grunwald staining .
in addition , the mitochondrion were also enlarged ( fig. 2 ) .
figure 2 effect of z - phe - ala - chn2 on the size of the lysosome of t. brucei bloodstream forms in vivo .
mice were infected and treated as described in the legend to fig. 1. on day 5 p.i. , trypanosomes were purified and processed for electron microscopy .
ultrathin sections of representative cells purified from mice treated with z - phe - ala - chn2 ( a ) and vehicle alone ( b ) are shown .

next , the protein content of trypanosomes purified from z - phe - ala - chn2 - treated and control mice was compared .
trypanosomes exposed to the inhibitor had 65 % more protein than parasites from untreated animals ; the mean values were 8.9 and 5.4 pg cell - 1 , respectively ( table 1 ) .
thus , the microscopically observed enlargement of trypanosomes exposed to z - phe - ala - chn2 correlated with a higher protein content of the cells .

trypanosomes were considered to be dividing if the parasites contained two kinetoplasts .
in contrast to the 16 % of the normal trypanosome population containing two kinetoplasts , just 4 % of parasites exposed to z - phe - ala - chn2 were dividing ( table 2 ) .
as the segregation of the kinetoplast precedes trypanosomal cytokinesis [ 14 ] , this result indicates that the cell division of trypanosomes was impaired under the influence of z - phe - ala - chn2 .

discussion previously , we demonstrated that small molecule inhibitors of cysteine proteinases kill t. brucei in culture and experimentally - infected mice [ 4,6 ] .
we now report that upon treatment of infected mice with the diazomethyl ketone inhibitor , z - phe - ala - chn2 , parasite death is preceded by an increase in cell body mass and enlargement of constituent organelles ( lysosome and mitochondrion ) with a predominance (> 90 %) of trypanosomes displaying a " stumpy - like " morphology .
swelling of the cell body prior to cell lysis has been reported previously for bloodstream forms of t. brucei and t. cruzi after incubation with peptidyl fluoromethyl ketones in vitro [ 15 ] .
the mechanism proposed involved inhibition of cysteine proteinase activity .
treatment with z - phe - ala - chn2 elicited a striking enlargement of the lysosome of trypanosomes coincident with the appearance of the same organelle after staining with may - grunwald 's solution .
this suggests that the inhibitor prevents normal proteolysis in the lysosome thereby allowing the accumulation of undegraded proteins and the consequent increase in parasite weight ( table 1 ) .
the alteration in lysosomal size and function is consistent with the previous finding that co - incubation of cultured t. brucei bloodstream forms with z - phe - ala - chn2 and fitc - labelled transferrin prevented degradation of the latter in the lysosome [ 4 ] .
however , the lack of increased electron density in the enlarged lysosome , as would normally be expected upon accumulation of undegraded proteins , may suggest an increased water permeability of the organelle .
while it is formally possible that z - phe - ala - chn2 exerts its trypanocidal action through one or more off - target mechanisms , one likely molecular target responsible for the enlarged lysosome phenotype is brucipain given that it is localized in the lysosome [ 9 ] and that exposure to the inhibitor in vivo results in a marked decrease ( 92 %) in cellular cysteine protease activity , most of which is due to brucipain [ 4 ] .
it is also possible that the phenotype was a result of inhibition of tbcatb by z - phe - ala - chn2 , even though a sub - cellular localization of this enzyme consistent with the phenotype is as yet unknown [ 8 ] .
interestingly , tetracycline - induced rnai of tbcatb , but not brucipain , induced a lethal phenotype prefaced by an enlarged endosome / lysosome compartment [ 8 ] similar to that consequent on exposure to z - phe - ala - chn2 .
the conclusions were that tbcatb , not brucipain , was essential to t. brucei survival and that tbcatb was the most likely target of the inhibitor [ 8 ] .
however , with respect to brucipain , both of these judgments are open to reinterpretation given the available data .
first , fully 35 % of rhodesain activity remained in the presence of tetracycline - induced rnai [ 8 ] , possibly sufficient to allow for normal cell function and the lack of an obvious phenotype .
therefore , it is still unclear what a total knock - down of brucipain might yield in terms of the parasite 's ability to survive .
secondly , z - phe - ala - chn2 is chemically reactive with both mammalian cathepsins b and l [ 16,17 ] and there is no quantitative data to suggest that tbcatb is preferentially inhibited by this compound .
indeed , it has been shown that , in t. brucei lysates , both brucipain and a 34 kda proteinase species ( consistent with the molecular weight of tbcatb ) are inhibited by z - phe - ala - chn2 [ 9 ] .
for other protozoan parasites , morphological aberrations , consistent with the prevention of normal proteinolysis , have been noted upon application of cysteine proteinase inhibitors .
thus , incubation of t. cruzi epimastigotes with the cysteine proteinase inhibitor morpholinourea - phenylalany - homophenylalanine vinylsulfone phenyl ( k11777 ) led to enlarged intracellular organelles ( endoplasmatic reticulum , nuclear membrane , mitochondrion ) and morphological alterations of the golgi complex [ 18 ] .
likewise , for plasmodium falciparum trophozoites , cysteine proteinase inhibitors disrupted the morphology of the food vacuole and prevented degradation of haemoglobin [ 19,20 ] .
in addition to the morphological changes , the " stumpy - like " nature of trypanosomes exposed to z - phe - ala - chn2 was substantiated by the low number of dividing parasites .
only 4 % of the parasites were proliferating which is close to the number of dividing cells ( long - slender forms ) of about 2 % found in natural short - stumpy enriched populations in vivo [ 21 ] .
because we observed no increase in multinucleated cells with aberrant kinetoplast / nucleus configurations , as can occur under non - physiological conditions [ 22,23 ] , the low number of dividing cells indicates z - phe - ala - chn2 induces a cell cycle arrest .
transformation of long - slender forms into " stumpy - like " forms has been previously observed upon treatment with the methylating agent 1,2 - bis ( methylsulfonyl ) - 1 - methylhydrazine and the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor dl - alpha - difluoromethylornithine ( dfmo ) [ 22,24,25 ] .
whereas the primary effect of dfmo is depletion of the intracellular polyamine pool , that of 1,2 - bis ( methylsulfonyl ) - 1 - methylhydrazine is modification of dna .
however , the subsequent effect of both agents is an inhibition of dna synthesis which in turn leads to arrest of the cell cycle [ 22,25 ] .
a similar mechanism may also account for the cell cycle arrest in trypanosomes exposed to z - phe - ala - chn2 : inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis depletes the parasite of nutrients necessary for dna synthesis and this is followed by blockage of mitosis .
the cell - cycle arrest may also explain why z - phe - ala - chn2 - exposed trypanosomes are 65 % larger than control parasites as they continue to grow but have stopped dividing .
conclusion this study has shown that treatment of t. brucei - infected mice with the cysteine proteinase inhibitor z - phe - ala - chn2 results in an increased number of mitotically - arrested , stumpy form - like parasites .
the findings agree with previous suggestions that enforced cell cycle arrest can trigger slender - to - stumpy differentiation [ 21 ] .
materials and methods reagents z - phe - ala - chn2 was purchased from bachem , heidelberg , germany ; may - grunwald 's stain solution was obtained from merck , darmstadt , germany ; 4,6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylinodole ( dapi ) was bought from sigma , deisenhofen , germany ; bca protein assay was from pierce chemical company ( rockford , il , usa ) .
treatment of t. brucei - infected mice with z - phe - ala - chn2 female balb / c mice ( about 10 weeks old ) were infected intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) with 2 x 104 cells of the pleomorphic t. brucei variant clone antat 1.1 [ 26 ] .
on days 3 and 4 post infection ( p.i. ) mice were treated once daily with i.p. injections of 250 mg kg - 1 of z - phe - ala - chn2 dissolved in 70 % dmso / 30 % physiological nacl solution .
infected control mice received only the vehicle .
on day 5 p.i. , blood smears were prepared or parasites were purified from blood by deae - cellulose chromatography [ 27 ] .
staining of blood smears blood smears were stained with may - grunwald 's stain solution and additionally treated with 0.0001 % dapi to label the nucleus and the kinetoplast .
the stained slides were examined under a microscope ( axioplan ) using a 100x plan - neofluar objective in transmitted and fluorescence light .
electron microscopy purified trypanosomes were fixed in 2 % formaldehyde / 0.05 % glutaraldehyde in pbs for 60 min .
after embedding in 1 % agarose , cells were post - fixed with 1 % osmium tetraoxide / 0.9 % ferricyanide in pbs for 60 min followed by 1 % uranyl acetate for 60 min .
cells were dehydrated in ethanol and subsequently embedded in epoxy resin .
ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate , and examined with a philips 201 electron microscope at 60 kv. protein assay the protein content of trypanosomes was determined using the bicinchoninic acid ( bca ) method .
lysed trypanosomes ( 2.5 - 3.7 x 105 cells in 10 mul ) were incubated with 200 mul of bca protein assay reagent at 37degreesc .
a series of dilutions of bsa ( 0.1 - 0.9 mg ml - 1 ) was used to generate a standard curve and each dilution was set up in duplicate .
after 30 min of incubation , the absorbance at 500 nm was determined using a dynatech mr5000 elisa reader .

small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis ( psc ) is characterized by cholestatic liver function tests , histological evidence of psc but absence of classic cholangiographic findings .
large duct or classic psc in association with hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection has rarely been reported .
however to the best of our knowledge small duct psc in association with hcv infection has not been reported .
we report this case of small duct psc in a patient with hcv infection .
hcv infection in our patient was successfully treated with ribavirin and peg interferon alfa - 2a , as evidenced by undetectable hcv ribonucleic acid levels .
however , the patient had persistently elevated liver function tests suggestive of cholestasis .
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) revealed normal architecture of bile ducts .
hence patient underwent liver biopsy and its histopahological findings were suggestive of psc .
he had colonoscopy along with biopsy and inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) was ruled out .
primary sclerosing cholangitis small duct hepatitis c virus introduction small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis ( psc ) is a rare disorder characterized by cholestatic liver function tests , histological evidence of psc but without classic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) findings .
inflammatory bowel disease has been associated with large duct as well as small duct psc , although the small duct variant is rare .
association of psc with hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection is very rare .
in fact small duct psc in association with hcv infection has not been reported .
we present a case of small duct psc in a patient with hcv infection who has been successfully treated but had persistently elevated liver function tests .
case report a 26 - year - old man presented to the emergency department with severe upper abdominal pain of two days duration .
he denied any fever , nausea , vomiting or gastrointestinal bleeding .
his medical history included genotype 1a hcv infection diagnosed 5 years ago .
there were no clear risk factors for hcv infection .
he was treated successfully with ribavirin and peg interferon alfa - 2a for 48 weeks .
at the end of the treatment his hcv rna levels were undetectable .
however , his alanine amino transferase ( alt ) , aspartate amino transferase ( ast ) , and alkaline phosphatase levels remained high after the completion of the treatment .
his surgical history included right inguinal hernia repair 5 years ago and elective laparoscopic cholecytectomy 3 years ago for cholelithiasis .
he denied alcohol or substance use .
initial physical examination revealed mild tenderness in both upper quadrants of the abdomen without guarding or rigidity .
he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
his amylase , lipase , total and direct bilirubin levels were elevated .
he underwent computerized tomography ( ct ) of the abdomen which showed findings suggestive of acute pancreatitis .
ultrasonography of the abdomen was performed which showed mildly dilated common bile duct .
he was admitted to the hospital with the impression of acute pancreatitis .
he underwent ercp for evaluation of dilated bile duct that revealed biliary sludge with normal architecture of bile ducts .
a stent was placed during ercp and his clinical condition improved gradually .
his amylase , lipase and bilirubin levels normalized , but alt , ast and alkaline phosphatase levels remained persistently elevated .
he was discharged with follow - up appointment in gastroenterology clinic .
further workup including serum ceruloplasmin , copper and iron levels were normal .
screening for hepatitis a virus and hepatitis b virus was negative .
he was tested negative for rheumatoid factor , anti - nuclear , anti - smooth muscle , anti - mitochondrial , anti - myeloperoxidase and anti - proteinase - 3 antibodies .
his rapid plasma reagin and human immunodeficiency virus tests were negative .
patient underwent ct guided needle biopsy of the liver .
liver biopsy showed : " onion - skin " periductal fibrosis ( fig. 1 ) , bile duct loss , ductular reaction ( fig. 2 ) , hypocellular fibrous septa ( fig. 3 ) and possible bile duct scar which were suggestive of psc .
subsequently the patient underwent colonoscopy to rule out inflammatory bowel disease .
the histopathological findings of colon and terminal ileal specimens did not show any evidence of inflammatory bowel disease .
at this point he remains clinically asymptomatic and does not require any treatment .
figure 1 liver biopsy showed " onion - skin " periductal fibrosis .
figure 2 liver biopsy showed bile duct loss and ductular reaction .
figure 3 liver biopsy showed hypocellular fibrous septa .
discussion small duct psc previously known as pericholangitis [ 1 , 2 ] is described as having biochemical evidence of cholestasis , histological features of psc but with normal ercp findings [ 3 ] .
it has been known that small duct psc occurs in association with inflammatory bowel disease [ 1 , 4 , 5 ] , esinophilic gastroenteritis [ 6 ] , as a component of overlap syndrome with autoimmune hepatitis [ 7 , 8 ] and in explanted liver [ 6 ] .
both small duct and large duct psc resemble in clinical , biochemical and histological features [ 4 ] .
however , small duct psc occurs less frequently compared to large duct psc [ 9 ] , affecting adults more than children [ 8 ] , males more than females [ 4 ] .
natural history of small duct psc is more benign compared to large duct psc [ 10 , 11 ] .
significant proportion of small duct psc patients may progress to large duct psc [ 1 , 10 , 12 ] or end stage liver disease requiring liver transplantation [ 9 ] .
progression to cholangiocarcinoma never occurs in small duct psc patients compared to large duct psc patients [ 9 , 12 , 13 ] .
small duct psc patients live longer without transplantation [ 9 , 10 ] and it may recur after transplantation [ 10 ] .
classic or large duct psc in association with hcv infection is very rare [ 14 ] .
there have been two case reports describing the association ; the first case was reported in a patient with hcv infection after successful treatment with interferon and second in a patient where interferon therapy could not clear the virus .
however , currently there is no available data on association of small duct psc with hcv infection .
as the available evidence suggests that small duct psc may represent earlier spectrum of disease progression [ 1 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 ] , this case may represent onset of disease process and it may progress to large duct psc in future .
abnormal liver function tests always mandate work up to understand and diagnose disease process .
this case signifies the importance of pursuing further noninvasive and invasive interventions to achieve the diagnosis in patients with biochemical evidence of cholestasis .
before attempting invasive interventions other causes of liver function abnormalities including infectious , metabolic and autoimmune [ 7 , 8 ] etiologies have to be ruled out .
invasive procedures like ercp , liver biopsy and colonoscopy to rule out coexisting bowel disease [ 4 , 5 ] may be needed to confirm the diagnosis .
this case warrants further studies to understand pathogenesis and treatment modalities of small duct psc particularly in association with hcv .

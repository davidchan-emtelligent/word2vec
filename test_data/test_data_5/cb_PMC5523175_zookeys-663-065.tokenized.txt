https :// doi.org / 10.3897 / zookeys.663.11494 introduction the genus qingryllus was established by chen and zheng ( 1995 ) for q. striofemorus chen & zheng , 1995 , based on female specimens .
li and zheng ( 2001 ) described the male characters of q. striofemorus , with limited distribution in ningshan ( china : shaanxi ) , this genus remains monotypic until the present time ( eades et al. 2016 ) .
in our recent study on gryllinae from sichuan , china , a new species of qingryllus was discovered and it is described here under the name of q. jiguanshanensis sp. n. there are two species of qingryllus , both occurring in china ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 .
distribution map of the genus qingryllus chen & zheng .
the genus qingryllus differs from most groups of gryllinae by the fore tibia without tympanum and tegminal venation similar in both sexes .
in gryllinae , the genus qingryllus has the greatest similarity to goniogryllus chopard , 1936 , but differs from the latter by the tegmina , developed hind wings , and hind tibiae with four pairs of dorsal spines on both sides .
goniogryllus is generally without wings or with very short tegmina , and the hind tibiae usually has three dorsal spines ( chen and zheng 1995 ) .
meanwhile , the two genera have different microhabitat preferences , with qingryllus living in trees and shrubs and goniogryllus living in the litter layer .
materials and methods specimens examined were collected using sweeping method in trees and shrubs .
the type specimens of the new species have been deposited in the museum , hebei university , baoding , china ( mhbu ) .
the male genitalia were dissected and cleared in 10 % koh solution .
all morphological structures were photographed using a leica m205a microscope .
images of multiple layers were stacked using combine zm. the distribution map was constructed using the software package arcgis 10.2 ( esri , redlands , ca , usa ) , based on localities of the specimens examined for this study and those mentioned in literature ( chen and zheng 1995 ; li and zheng 2001 ) .

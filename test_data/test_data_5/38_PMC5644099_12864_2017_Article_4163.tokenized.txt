background trypanosomatids are a group of protozoan parasites that includes the etiologic agents of important human illnesses as chagas disease , sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis .
these parasites have a significant distinction from other eukaryotes concerning mrna structure , since all mature mrnas have an identical species - specific sequence of 39 nucleotides at the 5 ' extremity , named spliced leader ( sl ) .
considering this peculiar aspect of trypanosomatid mrna , the aim of the present work was to develop a trypanosoma cruzi specific in vitro transcription ( ivt ) linear mrna amplification method in order to improve parasite transcriptomics analyses .
methods we designed an oligonucleotide complementary to the last 21 bases of t. cruzi sl sequence , bearing an upstream t7 promoter ( t7sl primer ) , which was used to direct the synthesis of second - strand cdna .
original mrna was then amplified by ivt using t7 rna polymerase .
t7sl - amplified rna from two distinct t. cruzi stages ( epimastigotes and trypomastigotes ) were deep sequenced in solid platform .
usual poly ( a ) + rna and and t7 - oligo ( dt ) amplified rna ( eberwine method ) were also sequenced .
rna - seq reads were aligned to our new and improved t. cruzi dm28c genome assembly ( pacbio technology ) and resulting transcriptome pattern from these three rna preparation methods were compared , mainly concerning the conservation of mrna transcritional levels and degs detection between epimastigotes and trypomastigotes .
results t7sl ivt method detected more potential differentially expressed genes in comparison to either poly ( a ) + rna or t7dt ivt , and was also able to produce reliable quantifications of the parasite transcriptome down to 3 ng of total rna .
furthermore , amplification of parasite mrna in hela / epimastigote rna mixtures showed that t7sl ivt generates transcriptome quantification with similar detection of differentially expressed genes when parasite rna mass was only 0.1 % of the total mixture ( r = 0.78 when compared to poly ( a ) + rna ) .
conclusions the t7sl ivt amplification method presented here allows the detection of more potential parasite differentially expressed genes ( in comparison to poly ( a ) + rna ) in host - parasite mixtures or samples with low amount of rna .
this method is especially useful for trypanosomatid transcriptomics because it produces less bias than pcr - based mrna amplification .
additionally , by simply changing the complementary region of the t7sl primer , the present method can be applied to any trypanosomatid species .

initially based on dna microarrays [ 2 ] , nowadays transcriptomics is mainly performed by rna - seq [ 3 ] .
this method consists in deep sequencing of cdna , followed by transcript identification and quantification based on the alignment of millions of sequences ( reads ) to a reference genome [ 4 ] , resulting in a quantitative digital map of rna expression [ 5 ] .
rna - seq is a very powerful technique [ 1 , 6 ] , but one limitation is the initial rna mass required for entering the pipeline ( generally 100 ng for poly ( a ) + rna ) .
to circumvent input limitations , rna amplification is an interesting option , and recent developments have enabled transcriptome analysis from few or even single cells [ 7 , 8 ] .
three main rna amplification methods are mostly used : ( i ) in vitro transcription ( ivt ) , ( ii ) pcr - based and ( iii ) rolling circle amplification ( reviewed by [ 8 ]) .
ivt protocol was initially developed in the eberwine laboratory [ 9 ] , and is based on reverse transcription with an oligo ( dt ) primer bearing an upstream t7 promoter , which directs in vitro transcription with t7 rna polymerase ( amplification ) after synthesis and purification of double - strand cdna .
the linear amplified material provides a more precise estimation of transcript levels in comparison to pcr - based exponential amplification [ 10 ] .
as microarrays required a higher rna mass when compared to rna - seq , ivt was commonly used to produce enough material for array hybridization [ 11 ] , and no significant bias was introduced by rna amplification [ 12 - 14 ] .
besides , a more reproducible expression profile from a wide range of rna inputs is produced , improving the reliability of array results regardless of sample expansion [ 12 , 13 ] .
hence , ivt mrna amplification was extensively used for preparing rna samples for array analysis [ 15 , 16 ] and it was recently adapted for rna - seq [ 17 ] and single - cell rna - seq [ 18 - 20 ] .
trypanosomatids are a group of human pathogenic parasites that includes the etiological agents of chagas disease ( trypanosoma cruzi ) , sleeping sickness ( trypanosoma brucei ) and leishmaniasis ( leishmania sp ) [ 21 ] .
trypanosomatids have a significant distinction from other eukaryotes concerning rna transcription and processing : all mature mrnas are produced after the processing of polycistronic precursors by concerted trans - splicing and polyadenylation reactions [ 22 ]. through trans - splicing , all mature mrna have the same 39 nucleotides species - specific sequence at the 5 ' region , called mini - exon or spliced leader ( sl ) [ 23 ] .
this characteristic allows the use of the sl sequence for specific analyzes of all mrna from trypanosomatids .
the " spliced leader trapping " method [ 24 ] enriches for 5 ' - sl extremity of mrna by using a sl specific primer for second - strand cdna synthesis and to further amplify 5 ' - sl containing fragments by pcr , enabling simultaneous mapping of 5'splice sites and profiling of corresponding gene expression on rna - seq experiments .
similar protocols have been used to map splice sites [ 25 - 27 ] and to measure changes in splice site usage during t. brucei life cycle [ 24 , 26 ] .
detailed protocols to generate rna - seq libraries enriched for 5 ' - sl mrna extremity were recently published [ 28 , 29 ] and a web server platform for quantitative identification of sl and polyadenylation sites in kinetoplastid genomes is also available [ 30 ] .
recently , using a method similar to sl trapping , mulindwa and collaborators [ 31 ] used sl primers to synthesize t. brucei - specific cdna on host - parasite rna mixtures , followed by pcr amplification using nested primers to amplify parasite mrna .
although introducing significant bias in comparison to poly ( a ) + rna , the authors considered that pcr based amplification method of sl - containing mrnas allowed comparison of different samples as long as they were all treated equally [ 31 ] .
here , we describe the use of t. cruzi sl sequence for parasite - specific mrna amplification .
we demonstrate a t. cruzi specific ivt amplification method based in second - strand cdna synthesis using a sl primer bearing an upstream t7 promoter ( t7sl ) .
rna - seq analyses of two distinct forms of t. cruzi ( epimastigotes and trypomastigotes ) show that t7sl amplification does not introduce significant bias in rna - seq quantification and also allows parasite transcriptome analysis in mixed rna samples .
this method presents better performance , measured by pearson correlation , than the recently published pcr - based t. brucei mrna amplification [ 31 ] , enabling better transcriptome quantification , especially for samples with low amount of rna or host - parasite mixtures .
methods cell culture parasite culture : t. cruzi dm28c epimastigotes [ 32 ] were cultured at 28 degreesc in litb medium supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) as previously described [ 33 ] .
tissue culture - derived trypomastigote forms were obtained by infection of cultured vero cell ( atcc ( r ) ccl - 81 ( tm )) at 37 degreesc in a humidified 5 % co2 atmosphere using a multiplicity of infection ( moi ) of 10 parasites per host cell .
trypomastigotes were recovered after 4 days of infection , in the cell burst peak .
fluorescence activated cell sorting ( facs ) flow cytometry and cell sorting experiments were performed in a facsariaii ( becton - dickinson , san jose , ca , usa ) using a 85 mum nozzle and 45 psi sheet pressure .
a total of 10,000 events were acquired in the regions previously identified as corresponding to t. cruzi cells [ 34 ] .
for epimastigote cell sorting , a fsc - a vs ssc - a gate comprising about 90 % of all singlets were used .
one hundred thousand ( 105 ) epimastigotes were sorted directly to 700 mul of rna extraction buffer ( buffer rlt of qiagen rneasy kit ) kept under 4 degreesc during sorting .
total sorting volume was ~ 200 mul .
to the resulting cell lysate ( 900 mul ) , 250 mul of 100 % ethanol was added and rna was purified by rna clean - up protocol of qiagen handbook with additional on - column dnase digestion step .
rna purification total rna was extracted from t. cruzi epimastigote and trypomastigote forms ( 5 x 108 cells ) with the rneasy kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions , with an additional on - column dnase digestion step .
total rna from hela cells were obtained from messageamp ( tm ) ii arna amplification kit from life technologies ( r ) (# amb1751 - 5 ) .
rna integrity was assessed on an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer with rna 6000 nano labchip kit , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
polyadenylated rna were purified from at least 50 mug of total rna using polya + track ( r ) mrna isolation system iii from promega ( r ) (# z5300 ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
rna amplification all mrna amplification reactions were done using reagents from messageamp ( tm ) ii arna amplification kit from life technologies ( r ) (# amb1751 - 5 ) .
for classic eberwine amplification method , first - strand cdna was synthesized using a t7oligo ( dt ) primer that contains a t7 rna polymerase promoter upstream to the poly - t tract ; this promoter will further direct the in vitro mrna synthesis ( amplification ) .
first , 100 ng of total rna ( in 11 mul ) were mixed with first - strand cdna reaction mix containing 1 mul of t7oligo ( dt ) primer , 2 mul first - strand buffer , 4 mul dntps , 1 mul rnase inhibitor and 1 mul arrayscript reverse transcriptase and incubated for 2 h at 42 degreesc .
second - strand cdna was then synthesized for 2 h at 16 degreesc using the total 20 mul first - strand product plus 80 mul of second strand mix containing 63 mul water , 10 mul second - strand buffer , 4 mul dntps , 2 mul dna polymerase and 1 mul of rnase h. double - strand cdna was then purified using purelink ( r ) pcr micro kit from life technologies (# k310250 ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
eluted cdna was adjusted to 16 mul and used as template for amplification reaction in a total volume of 40 mul containing 16 mul ntps , 4 mul amplification buffer and 4 mul of t7 rna polymerase ; in vitro transcription took 14 h at 37 degreesc .
amplified rna ( arna ) was then purified using rneasy minelute cleanup kit ( qiagen , # 74204 ) , according to manufacturer 's instructions .
for specific amplification of spliced leader containing mrna , we used a custom designed primer complementary to the last 21 bases of t. cruzi spliced leader ( in bold ) with an upstream t7 rna polymerase promoter ( in lower case ) ( 5 ' - ggccagtgaattgtaatacgactcactatagggaggcggtacagtttctgtactatattg - 3 ') , which we named t7sl .
in this case , t7sl was used for second - strand cdna synthesis , while first - strand cdna was produced using random primers , according to the second round amplification protocol of messageamp ( tm ) ii arna kit .
template total rna was adjusted to 10 mul , mixed with 2 mul of " second round primers " ( random primers ) and incubated at 70 degreesc for 10 min followed by snap cooling on ice to allow annealing of random primers to the rna .
then , 8 mul of the reverse transcription master mix was added and first - strand cdna was synthesized at 42 degreesc for 2 h. rnase h was added ( 1 mul ) and the sample incubated at 37 degreesc for 30 min to specifically degrade the remaining rna .
t7sl primer was added to a final concentration of 1 mum and the sample was incubated at 70 degreesc for 10 min and then placed on ice .
second - strand cdna master mix without rnase h was added ( 74 mul ) and the reaction incubated for 2 h at 16 degreesc .
double - strand cdna purification , in vitro transcription and arna purification was performed as described above .
for a more stringent second - strand cdna synthesis directed by t7sl primer , we also developed a modified protocol using platinum ( r ) pfx dna polymerase ( life technologies , # 11708013 ) for second - strand cdna synthesis at 68 degreesc instead of 16 degreesc , and primer annealing at a higher temperature , when using the dna polymerase of messageamp ( tm ) ii arna kit .
in this case , after rna degradation with rnase h , single - strand cdna were mixed with t7sl primer ( 1 mum ) and platinum ( r ) pfx dna polymerase mix ( 5 mul 10x pfx amplification buffer , 1 mul 50 mm mgso4 and 1 mul polymerase ) in a final volume of 50 mul .
sample was placed on a thermal cycler as following : 95 degreesc for 3 min ( denaturing ) , 55 degreesc for 10 min ( t7sl annealing ) and 68 degreesc for 30 min ( second - strand cdna synthesis ) .
cdna purification , in vitro transcription and arna purification was performed as described above .
rna quantification and length distribution assessment amplified rna was quantified using qubit rna hs assay kit (# q32852 ) in a qubit ( r ) 2.0 fluorometer ( life technologies ) .
for length distribution analysis , arna concentration was adjusted to 1 ng mul - 1 and analyzed on an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer with rna 6000 pico labchip kit , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
rna - seq sample preparation and sequencing negative control arna samples , generated from pure hela rna , were sequenced in omega bio - tek inc .
( norcross , ga , usa ) using the illumina 2 x 100 paired - end sequencing method .
all other samples were sequenced in the dna sequencing platform of instituto carlos chagas ( curitiba , pr , brazil ) using solid ( tm ) 1 x 50 single - end sequencing method .
for solid ( tm ) sequencing , total rna - seq kit ( life technologies , # 4445374 ) was used accordingly to manufacturer 's instructions .
briefly , rna was fragmented using rnase iii and cleaned up with invitrogen ribominus ( tm ) concentration module .
strand - specific adaptors were hybridized and ligated to both extremities of rna in an overnight reaction , followed by first - strand cdna synthesis with reverse transcriptase .
cdna was purified using minelute ( r ) pcr purification kit ( qiagen ) and gel - based selected for size using a novex tbe - urea 6 % gel (# ec6865box ) .
on - gel cdna was amplified by pcr using solid ( tm ) rna barcoding kit primers ( life technologies , # 4427046 and # 4453189 ) and purified with invitrogen purelink ( r ) pcr micro kit .
amplified dna was quantified with qubit ( r ) dsdna hs assay kit on a qubit ( r ) 2.0 fluorometer .
equal masses of each sample , containing specific barcodes , were pooled together and the mixture used as dna template for emulsion pcr on applied biosystems solid ( r ) ez bead ( tm ) e80 system (# 4453095 ) .
after 3 ' end modification with terminal transferase , template beads were deposited onto glass slides and libraries sequenced on a solid ( tm ) 4 system using multiplex fragment sequencing protocol that generates about 700 millions 50 bases short reads per run .
data analysis illumina 2 x 100 paired - end rna - seq reads were aligned to the t. cruzi dm28c genome ( genbank accession number mbsy00000000 ) and human genome ( version 19 ) using bowtie2 v .

2.2.3 [ 36 ] with the following arguments : - - strata - h 80 % - - local - - max - alignments 1000 , in order to consider all top scoring multiple alignments of each read since the t. cruzi genome is highly repetitive [ 37 , 38 ] ; multiple alignments reads were further randomly attributed to a single aligned position .
only reads mapped with an score higher than 300 were used for posterior analyses .
for rna - seq gene coverage analysis , genes were divided in 100 equally proportional bins and the number of reads aligned to each bin were summed up from the sam file [ 39 ] using custom perl scripts ; percentage of maximum coverage were calculated for each bin considering the higher count bin ( for each sample ) as 100 % .
in order to exclude redundancy in t. cruzi gene annotation and read counts , clusters of orthologous genes were determined by mcl algorithm v .

all rna - seq data have been deposited in ncbi 's gene expression omnibus and are accessible through geo series accession number gse94766 .
results establishment of t7sl ivt method and comparison to t7oligo ( dt ) ivt to optimize the t7sl ivt method , we initially compared the amplified rna ( arna ) profile with the arna generated by the classic eberwine method that uses t7oligo ( dt ) primer .
for specific amplification of mrna bearing sl , we designed an oligonucleotide complementary to the last 21 bases at the 3 ' - end of t. cruzi spliced leader with an upstream t7 rna polymerase promoter ( see methods ) , which we named t7sl .
first - strand cdna was synthesized using random primers and , after rna degradation , second - strand cdna was produced using the t7sl primer ( fig. 1a ) .
distinct from t7oligo ( dt ) ivt procedure , where the t7 promoter is added to the first - strand cdna , the t7sl ivt method attaches the t7 promoter to the second - strand cdna ( fig. 1a ) .
hence , t7sl ivt will produce sense oriented arna , while t7oligo ( dt ) ivt produces anti - sense arna. fig. 1 t7sl ivt method .
a comparison between t7oligo ( dt ) ( left ) and t7sl ivt ( right ) methods .
in the eberwine method , the reverse transcription reaction is performed using a t7oligo ( dt ) primer , resulting in a first - strand cdna containing the t7 promoter .
the t7 rna polymerase is added for in vitro transcription of the purified cdna and antisense arna is obtained .
for the second method ( t7sl ivt ) , the reverse transcription reaction is performed using random primers and the second - strand cdna is obtained by a dna polymerase reaction with the t7sl primer , which also contains the t7 promoter .
after cdna purification , in vitro transcription with the t7 rna polymerase is performed , producing sense arna .
b distribution of rna lengths from ivt samples and poly ( a ) + rna ( control ) , quantified by the bioanalyzer 2100 equipment ( agilent ) .
c median length of poly ( a ) + rna and arnas from the ivt samples .
d arna yield obtained from the two ivt methods rna amplified by t7sl ivt showed a smooth length distribution , consistent with a global amplification of all mrnas of the parasite ( fig 1b ) .
although t7oligo ( dt ) showed a similar pattern , a rna spike approximately at 600 nt was always present ( fig. 1b ) .
when compared to purified poly ( a ) + rna from t. cruzi , both amplification methods showed a smaller median rna size ( fig. 1b and c ) .
as discussed below , this is probably due to the 5 ' and 3 ' bias in t7sl and t7oligo ( dt ) amplification methods , respectively .
the arna yield was similar for both methods ( fig. 1d ) ; starting with 100 ng of total rna , t7sl and t7oligo ( dt ) ivt generate an average of 14 and 21 mug of arna , respectively .
considering an empiric estimation that 3 % of total parasite rna correspond to mrna ( 3 ng on a 100 ng total rna sample ) , these yields are equivalent to 4718 and 7000 - fold mass amplification of input mrna , respectively .
arna - seq after initial optimization of t7sl ivt , we analyzed the arna composition by rna - seq , comparing our method to the usual t7oligodt ivt amplification and the gold standard rna - seq with purified poly ( a ) + rna .
we sequenced an average of 24 +/ - 4 million short reads ( 50 bases ) for each one of the 44 samples in the solid ( tm ) platform ( additional file 3 ) .
visualization of aligned reads on the parasite genome showed that each rna class ( t7oligodt , t7sl , poly ( a ) + rna ) has distinct coverage profiles ( figs. 2a and b ) .
while poly ( a ) + rna presented a more even read distribution across annotated genes , as expected [ 5 , 45 ] , t7sl and t7dt have 5 ' and 3 ' bias , respectively , which is more evident for longer genes ( additional file 4 : figure s1 ) .
this is expected as each ivt method positioned the t7 promoter in different mrna extremities ( fig. 1 ) .
although each method has distinct gene coverage profiles , the detection of differentially expressed supra genes ( degs ) between epimastigotes and tissue culture - derived trypomastigotes is similar for the three methods ( details below ) , as generally the biases are gene - specific .
raw and normalized sg read counts are shown in additional file 5. fig. 2 arna - seq results .

for all scatter plots , scales are log2 of normalized read counts and values inside the graphs represent pearson correlation rna - seq reads were aligned to our first version of t. cruzi dm28c genome produced using pacific bioscience technologies ( pacbio ) [ 46 ] .
as this third generation sequencing technology generates reads in average longer than 8 kb , this draft version is of higher quality than the usual cl brener reference genome , lowering the number of contigs from 32,746 to 1030 , increasing the size of the larger contig from 0.26 mb to 1.54 mb and increasing contig n50 from 15 kb to 133 kb [ 37 ] .
these improvements , as well as the fact that our mrna samples were derived from dm28 , improve the alignment of rna - seq reads ( 68 % of the reads aligned in a single position in dm28c genome , instead of 56 % in the cl brener genome ) .
there is another version of the dm28c genome available at genbank ( aylp00000000.1 ) , but it has lower quality , as this version was sequenced using 454 technology and hence has a more fragmented contig distribution , with its larger contig having only 0.09 mb , besides the higher error rate in homopolymer tracts typical of pyrosequencing .
this whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj / ena / genbank under the accession mbsy00000000 .
the version described in this paper is version mbsy01000000 .
after aligning the rna - seq reads to t. cruzi genome , per supra gene read counts were computed .
when comparing the technical replicates ( same total rna sample used as template for two independent amplification reactions ) , both ivt amplification methods have a very high correlation between technical replicates ( fig. 2c ) .
after summing up read counts for ivt technical replicates , we also assessed the biological degree of reproducibility , using two independent biological samples for the same parasite stages , epimastigote and trypomastigote .
for both ivt methods , biological variance is similar to the technical variance ( fig. 2d ) .
interestingly , the t7sl method presented a slightly higher average biological correlation in comparison to t7dt and poly ( a ) + rna ( additional file 4 : table s1 ) .
as rna - seq is typically used to detect degs , we applied all three methods ( t7sl ivt , t7oligo ( dt ) ivt and poly ( a ) + rna ) to compare two different stages of t. cruzi life cycle , epimastigotes and trypomastigotes .
at the same statistical significance level ( fdr < 0.01 ) , t7sl showed a higher number of degs , as this method detected 56.3 % and 6.5 % more putative degs in comparison to poly ( a ) + and t7dt methods ( fig. 3a ) .
however , when using a twofold threshold in supra gene expression level , all methods showed a similar number of degs , indicating that those degs detected only on t7sl are of small fold change and probably due to an increased reproducibility .
when co - visualizing the fold change , read counts and statistical significance of degs in a network representation ( additional file 4 : figure s2 ) , it is evident that degs identified in all three methods are of higher fold change and / or read counts .
t7sl method , however , has more capability of detecting low expressed or smaller fold change degs .
this increased detection can be a technical bias , but generally it is considered that t7 - amplification improves the mrna quantification by decreasing variability , as mentioned above .
a list of epimastigote to trypomastigote degs for each method used herein can be found in additional file 6. fig. 3 putative deg detection for the three analyzed methods .

far right scatter plot correlates t7sl fold changes to the ones detected by our analysis of li and collaborators data [ 44 ] we computed the read count fold change ( log2 ) for all parasite genes , and showed that epimastigote to trypomastigote fold changes are similar for all three methods ( fig. 3b ) .
higher correlation were obtained when comparing t7sl ivt to either one of the other methods , in comparison to t7dt versus poly ( a ) + rna correlation , suggesting that t7sl is a reliable representation of fold changes distribution .
we compared the recently published t. cruzi transcriptome data [ 44 ] to present results .
normalized read counts showed low correlations when comparing same parasite stages ( r = 0.26 to 0.56 ) ( additional file 4 : figure s3a ) , but this can be explained by several reasons , including ( i ) different parasite strains , ( ii ) distinct genome used for rna - seq alignments and ( iii ) distinct laboratorial procedures .
however , when comparing the expression fold changes between epimastigotes to trypomastigotes ( fig. 3b and additional file 4 : figure s3b ) , the correlation slightly improves ( r ~ 0.6 ) , showing that , apart from distinct methods used , the biological meaning of both works was similar .
when comparing epimastigote to trypomastigote degs ( fdr < 0.01 ) , about 64 % ( 1463 of 2298 ) of significant genes detected using li and collaborators data [ 44 ] were also detected in the present work ( additional file 4 : figure s4a ) .
furthermore , present t7sl data detected 952 epimastigote to trypomastigote degs that were not detected in li data ( additional file 4 : figure s4a ) .
when considering the most significative degs for t7sl method ( fdr < 0.01 , fold change > 2 ; 872 genes ) , about 53 % ( 461 ) was also detected in li data ( additional file 4 : figure s4b ) .
apart from the peculiarities of each method , 98 % ( 448 of 461 ) of this common degs showed the same fold change direction ( additional file 4 : figure s4b - i and s4b - iv ) .
present data corroborate previous work on the t. cruzi steady state transcriptome [ 44 , 47 ] , showing the upregulation of several metabolism enzymes in epimastigote stage ( additional file 4 : figure s4b - i ; additional file 6 ) and several masps and trans - sialidases in trypomastigotes ( additional file 4 : figure s4b - iv ; additional file 6 ) .
t7sl ivt improves parasite transcriptome analysis in host - parasite rna mixtures after the establishment and validation of t7sl ivt , we evaluated the specificity of parasite mrna amplification by testing the reaction in mixtures of t. cruzi and hela rna .
the arna yield of t7sl ivt was around 43 times smaller when using hela rna as input ( 340 ng arna produced from 100 ng input ) , but in order to increase specificity , we modified the protocol used for t. cruzi rna samples , using platinum ( r ) pfx dna polymerase for second - strand cdna synthesis at 68 degreesc instead of 16 degreesc when using regular dna polymerase .
this modification did not affect the yield and pattern of t. cruzi rna amplification ( fig. 4a ) but decreases human arna yield in 20 %. fig. 4 performance of t7sl ivt on rna mixtures .

c scatterplot comparing t7sl pfx ivt and mixtures of hela - epi rnas , or polya + rna against hela - epi rnas .
d scatter plots of epimastigote to trypomastigote fold changes when comparing polya (+) transcriptome quantification to t7sl using t.cruzi / hela rna mixtures we further tested the t. cruzi transcriptome quantification in the following t. cruzi / hela rna mixtures : ( i ) 900 ng hela plus 100 ng epi ( 10 % parasite rna ) , ( ii ) 990 ng hela plus 10 ng epi ( 1 % parasite rna ) and ( iii ) two mixtures containing 0.1 % of parasite rna ( 4995 ng hela plus 5 ng epi and 9990 ng hela plus 10 ng epi ) .
the 0.1 % mixtures corresponds to about 106 human cells ( around 5 mug of total rna ) together with 104 epimastigotes ( around 5 ng of total rna , see additional file 4 : table s2 ) .
bioanalyzer analysis demonstrates that the 0.1 % parasite rna mixture generate arna with length distribution profile resembling the one from t. cruzi arna , but with a less smooth pattern ( fig. 4a ) .
we conducted rna - seq experiments on arna generated from mixture samples and the resulting reads were aligned to a t. cruzi - h. sapiens concatenated genome in order to observe the percentage of aligned reads with best match on the parasite or human genome .
for the 10 % parasite rna sample , around 94 % of aligned reads were best aligned to t. cruzi genome ( fig. 4b ) ; for the 1 % parasite rna sample , more than 60 % of aligned reads showed a best match to the parasite genome ; and when decreasing the parasite rna proportion to only 0.1 % of total mass , around 10 % of the aligned reads have a best match to the parasite genome .
although this means a lower sequencing coverage for samples with low proportion of parasite mrna , it is a significant reduction in read waste when comparing to mixture rna samples without amplification , as 10 % of aligned reads on a 0.1 % original sample represents a 100 - fold enrichment for parasite rna .
for hela pure samples , only a very small proportion of aligned reads (~ 0.02 %) showed a better alignment to the t. cruzi genome ( detailed below ) .
when comparing read counts per supra gene for pure and mixed samples using t7sl pfx ivt arna ( fig. 4c ) , the parasite transcriptome quantification was very reproducible with pearson correlations above 0.94 even for the 0.1 % parasite rna samples ( fig. 4c ) .
finally , we visualized read counts scatter plots when comparing epimastigote poly ( a ) + rna to epimastigote t7sl pfx ivt arna generated in the most diluted samples ( fig. 4c ) .
when using the optimized protocol for t7sl pfx ivt from 100 ng of pure parasite rna , pearson correlation was 0.78 to poly ( a ) + rna .
interestingly , arna generated from host - parasite rna mixture containing only 0.1 % of parasite rna had a similar pearson correlation ( r = 0.77 ) .
this result indicates that t7sl amplification method performs better , in general , than pcr based mrna amplification , since a recent study in t. brucei based on this technique reported a correlation of 0.38 [ 31 ] between poly ( a ) + rna and sl - based pcr amplified rnas .
scatter plots of epimastigote to trypomastigote fold changes showed that when the percentage of epimastigote rna on the mixture diminishes , the correlation to poly ( a ) + transcriptome decreases from 0.67 ( 10 % epimastigote mass ) to 0.50 ( 0.1 % epimastigote ) indicating a higher impact of stochastic factors when the parasite rna input is too low ( fig. 4d ) .
visualization of rna - seq reads alignment on parasite genome showed that even for t. cruzi - hela mixtures containing only 0.1 % of epimastigote rna , t7sl amplification generate a similar coverage throughout the genome ( fig. 5 ) .
it is worth to mention that t7sl arna - seq of samples generated from hela pure rna illustrates that hela amplified material has no significant impact in distorting t. cruzi read count per cds .
apart the extremely low level of reads mapping to the t. cruzi genome (~ 0.02 %) , the great majority of them (~ 80 %) are mapped in or nearby a 186 nt repetitive element that are close to the rdna gene cluster ( additional file 4 : figure s5 ) .
interestingly , there is no sequence similar to this repetitive element in the reference human genome .
one possible explanation is that a similar sequence is present in the hela genome , but not in the reference human genome. fig. 5 igv view of rna - seq aligned reads coverage for t.cruzi - hela mixture samples .
a ~ 8 kb genome region , containing six genes ( blue boxes at the bottom ) , is showed .
for each sample , y axis is log10 of coverage , with counts range specified at the left .
percentage of epimastigote rna in the t. cruzi - hela rna mixture used for t7sl pfx amplification is indicated for each sample minimal rna mass input for optimal t7sl ivt finally , we evaluated the minimal mass of input rna allowing efficient mrna amplification without significant bias .
serial twofold dilutions from 100 to 0.78 ng were used and the corresponding arna yield was non linearly related to input total rna mass , since these variables follow a second order polynomial function ( fig. 6a ). from the arna yield function , we estimated that 4 ng of input total rna allows the generation of 100 ng of arna .
arna length distribution have a similar smooth pattern down to 6 ng of input rna ; smaller inputs produce artifact small arna molecules of about 100 nt ( fig. 6b ) .
this artifact small arna also appears when the t7sl amplification yield was smaller ( using hela pure rna ) or mainly when using no rna for amplification ( blank samples , fig. 4a ). fig. 6 minimal input rna mass for optimal t7sl ivt .

b arna length distribution obtained with different input rna mass .
note that below 6.25 ng input , the arna lose the typical smooth length distribution .
for all samples , the same rna mass were applied on a bioanalyzer chip .
c rna - seq scatterplot with different rna inputs ( from 100 to 3 ng ) for t7sl ivt .
pearson correlation is depicted , based on log normalized read counts .
note that even when 3 ng of mass input is used for rna amplification , the transcriptome quantification is very similar across all expression levels .
" sort " sample correspond to 105 epimastigotes sorted directly to rna extraction buffer , which roughly corresponds to 68 ng of total rna ( additional file 4 , table s2 ) we sequenced t7sl ivt arna generated from 100 to 3 ng of input total rna and also from 100,000 sorted epimastigotes ( around 68 ng of input total rna ) .
results showed that even when pushing down the input mass to 3 ng , the transcriptome quantification shows a very good correlation ( r = 0.90 ) to poly ( a ) + rna .
in general , the global rna quantification distribution is maintained , hence even with few nanograms of rna ( or 100,000 sorted parasites ) we can quantify the parasite transcriptome with satisfactory precision ( pearson correlation higher than 0.9 , fig. 6c ) .
t7sl enable degs detection independently of parasite rna mass input and purity to observe if the limiting percentage of parasite rna on mixture samples influenced the quantification of degs , we compared all epimastigote experimental points ( from 100 % to 0.1 % of relative parasite mass ) to the trypomastigote stage , as a reference sample .
besides , we included the limiting mass samples on the same analysis .
after detecting degs in all comparisons to trypomastigote , we plot in a heat map the 1079 most confident ones accordingly the optimal t7sl condition : epimastigote ( 100 ng , t7sl ) versus trypomastigote ( t7sl )( fdr 0.01 and twofold change ) .
interestingly , fig. 7a shows that almost all experimental points ( mixtures or limiting mass ) have the same expression change direction when comparing epimastigote to trypomastigote .
those few supra genes that were detected with fdr < 0.01 and have discrepant fold change directions between samples are low read counts supra genes ( 9 of 1079 genes ) , which are naturally more prone to quantification stochastic variations ( fig. 7a ) .
principal component analysis showed that complex mixture samples or limiting mass of parasite rna have a similar total transcriptome quantification to pure epimastigote samples , being that each group of samples ( mixtures or limiting mass ) clustered in pca plot distinctly separated from the trypomastigote samples ( fig. 7b ) .
this is not surprising given that the epimastigote and trypomastigote stages have very distinct mrna profiles and that the t7sl ivt method displays low technical bias .
it is interesting to notice that although mixture and limiting mass samples are closer to each other , they cluster in two distinct groups. fig. 7 t7sl ivt degs detection on mixtures and limiting mass samples .

note that , in general , all epimastigote samples show a similar fold change pattern for the great majority of genes , independent of initial mass used for amplification ( limiting mass samples ) or percentage of parasite rna on host - parasite mixtures ( mixture samples ) .
b principal component analysis ( pca ) of the same samples used in a. the first component represents 84 % of the total variation and is mainly due to epimastigote to trypomastigote differences ; the second component represents 9 % of the total variation and is mainly due to epimastigote transcriptome differences between the limiting mass experiments .
pca graph was created using perseus v.1.5.0.31 software .
c euler diagram showing the number and overlap of detected degs for epimastigote to trypomastigote comparison using five different groups : ( i ) poly ( a )+ : both parasite stages analyzed by poly ( a ) + rna ; ( ii ) t7sl : both parasite stages analyzed by t7sl ivt amplification method from 100 ng of initial mass ; ( iii ) epi _ 3ng : limiting mass of 3 ng for epimastigote t7sl ivt ; ( iv ) epi _ 0.1 % : mixture of host - parasite rna containing only 0.1 % of parasite rna ; ( v ) epi _ sort : amplification of rna obtained from 105 sorted epimastigotes next , we compared the identified degs in trypomastigote versus epimastigote samples , using five distinct comparisons : ( i ) purified poly ( a ) + rna obtained for both parasite stages ( gold standard rna - seq method ) , ( ii ) pure epimastigote arna produced from 100 ng of total rna , ( iii ) the most limiting mass used for t7sl ivt ( 3 ng of epimastigote rna ) , ( iv ) the lower percentage of epimastigote rna in a host - parasite mixture ( 0.1 % of parasite rna ) and ( v ) epimastigote rna obtained by sorting of 105 parasites .
comparisons ( ii ) to ( v ) were against t7sl ivt trypomastigote arna .
after independent calculation of degs for each comparison , we compare the list of degs ( considering an fdr of 1 %) and plotted the overlap of degs in an euler diagram ( fig. 7c ) .
a vast majority of putative degs detected by gold standard poly ( a ) + rna method were also detected by t7sl ivt method , even when using a limiting input mass of 3 ng. in general , t7sl ivt has reliable performance in degs detection even in the most extreme conditions of low input or low percentage of parasite rna .
discussion direct rna - seq analysis of parasites in their hosts is a difficult task due to the low amount of rna available to be extracted directly from infected tissue in comparison to the higher amount of co - purified host rna .
when the parasitemia is relatively high , typical poly ( a ) + rna - seq can be used to simultaneously capture the parasite and host cell transcriptomes , as recently showed for t. cruzi [ 44 , 48 ] , t. brucei [ 49 ] and leishmania [ 50 ] .
li and collaborators [ 44 ] analyzed the t. cruzi transcriptomic modulation associated with the establishment of intracellular t. cruzi infection .
in the initial times of infection ( 4 to 24 h ) , when the number of parasites to host cells is not higher than 1:1 , generally less than 5 % of the mixed host - parasite read pool mapped to the t. cruzi genome , reflecting the larger proportion of the host cell transcriptome .
hence , in cases where the relative number of parasites to host cells is much smaller than 1:1 , the fraction of reads mapping to parasite genome will be too small .
in this scenario , the parasite specific mrna amplification method showed here is of great utility .
the t. cruzi / hela mixed samples showed that it is possible to quantify the parasite transcriptome even when only 0.1 % of total rna mass correspond to parasite rna , which is similar to a mixture of 106 human cells and 104 t. cruzi epimastigotes .
in this case , typical poly ( a ) + rna - seq will not efficiently capture the parasite transcriptome and the present method is especially useful for low parasitemia samples or low input parasite total rna .
considering that all mrnas from trypanosomatids possess the same specific sequence at the 5 ' region , the spliced leader or mini - exon , they could be selectively amplified through a sl - bearing primer .
although the sl trapping method theoretically provides a means of analyzing parasite transcriptome in complex rna samples ( such as host - parasite mixtures ) [ 24 ] , this hypothesis was only recently addressed by mulindwa and collaborators [ 31 ] .
using a method similar to sl trapping , these authors synthesize t. brucei - specific cdna by priming with a sl - specific oligo , followed by pcr amplification using nested primers to evaluate the t. brucei transcriptome in host - parasite rna mixtures consisting of only 0.1 % of t. brucei rna .
their pcr based amplification of sl - containing mrnas allowed comparison of different samples as long as they were all treated in the same way , but introduced significant bias when comparing to gold standard poly ( a ) + rna - seq [ 31 ] .
our method uses a different procedure , ivt for rna amplification , as it linearly amplifies original mrnas [ 8 ] .
as already pointed out by mulindwa and collaborators [ 31 ] , sl priming followed by pcr - based cdna amplification distorted relative abundances of the cdna products and cannot be used , by itself , to measure absolute mrna levels .
although the present t7sl ivt method also showed some bias on transcriptome quantification , the amplification distortion was smaller .
when comparing transcriptome read counts distributions , the t7sl ivt method showed higher correlations to poly ( a ) + rna ( r = 0.77 , for the 0.1 % mixture ) in comparison to pcr - based method ( r = 0.34 ) [ 31 ] .
this improvement is important to increase the ability to detect true changes in the expression profile , specially with low amount rna or low ratio of parasite to total rna samples .
furthermore , if comparing samples produced by the same t7sl ivt protocol , the correlation was very good even when using complex mixed samples or low input rna , indicating that the bias created by the method , when compared to poly ( a ) + rna , are gene - specific and not influenced by the rna sample complexity .
the higher ability to detect epimastigote versus trypomastigote degs when using samples produced by the t7sl ivt method corroborate the idea that linear rna amplification enables a more reproducible transcriptome quantification [ 12 , 13 , 17 ] .
when analyzing samples with very low amount of parasite rna , the lower proportion of parasite reads can be resolved by a larger amount of sequencing data , obviously with significant increase in cost .
even though t7sl ivt amplifies host rna , present method showed at least 100 - fold enrichment of parasite mrna on resulting rna - seq reads that can be directly translated to a similar decrease in sequencing costs .
other useful characteristic of the t7sl ivt method is the 5 ' bias of the generated reads .
due to the fact that 5 ' - utr regions are significantly smaller than 3 ' - utr [ 51 ] , usually 30 to 70 nt , a higher proportion of reads will align inside cds regions .
these regions are more diverse than utrs and hence their correct mappability is higher in general .
conclusions we concluded that the t7sl ivt method has several advantages for those researchers preparing trypanosomatid rna - seq libraries whenever the parasite rna mass is a concern .
as long as all samples are treated equally , t7sl ivt allows a powerful detection of putative degs in complex samples , including low input and host - parasite mixtures ( especially for low parasitemia samples ) .
although we developed t7sl ivt method using t. cruzi total rna as template for amplification , this method can be easily adapted for any trypanosomatid species by only modifying the t7sl oligonucleotide .
t7sl ivt opens new perspectives for trypanosomatid studies , specially parasite transcriptome analysis directly in their hosts .

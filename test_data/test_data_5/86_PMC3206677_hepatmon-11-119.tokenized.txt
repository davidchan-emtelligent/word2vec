background the level of hbsag in some chronic hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) - infected individuals may decline over time so that it is not detectable in serum .
objective to assess the efficacy of hbv vaccine in those who lost their hbsag without seroconverssion to anti - hbs antibody .
patients and methods from april 1993 to december 2008 , of 1603 chronic hbv - infected individuals , 34 ( 22 men and 12 women ) became hbsag - negative in follow - up visits , with no detectable anti - hbs antibody and hbv dna in their sera .
they received hbv vaccination at 0 , 1 and 6 months ( case group ) .
fifty - two subjects ( 30 men and 22 women ) who were negative for hbsag , anti - hbs and anti - hbc antibody , received hbv vaccination according to the said schedule ( control group ) .
anti - hbs antibody was assessed one month after the last dose of vaccination in the both groups .
results the mean +/ - sd age of the case and control groups was 38 +/ - 12.7 and 33.4 +/ - 8.6 years , respectively ( p = 0.07 ) .
the sex distribution between these two groups were similar ( p = 0.652 ) .
the mean +/ - sd years of follow - up for the case group was 7.6 +/ - 4.5 years .
anti - hbs antibody level >= 10 iu / l was found in 8 ( 24 %) subjects in the case group and in 45 ( 87 %) in the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .
the mean +/ - sd anti - hbs antibody level in the case group was 68 +/ - 32.66 and in the control group 344.6 +/ - 38.9 iu / l ( p < 0.001 ) .
conclusions we found that nearly 24 % of chronic hbsag - positive subjects who lost their hbsag responded to hbv and the remaining cases need to be followed for occult hbv infection .
chronic hepatitis b follow - up study hbsag hepatitis b virus hepatitis b vaccine background approximately two billion people in the world have serological evidence of past hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infection and more than 400 million people are chronic carriers of hbv .
" chronic carrier " of hbv is defined by the presence of hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) in the serum for more than six months [ 1 ][ 2 ] .
years after chronic infection , in some cases serum hbsag level declines below the measurable limit .
although it is unusual , it occurs in less than 1 % of adult patients per year and 0.05 % to 0.8 % of those with infection acquired in infancy or early childhood [ 2 ][ 3 ] .
detection of hbv dna in the absence of a detectable hbsag level and occasionally other hbv serologic markers is termed " occult hepatitis b " ( ohb ) [ 4 ] .
these patients not only can transmit hbv to others , but may progress to chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma .
the prevalence of ohb in hemodialysis patients in different parts of the world is reported to be 3.8 % to 27 % [ 5 ][ 6 ][ 7 ][ 8 ] .
the prevalence and the outcome of ohb in chronic hbv - infected individuals has not yet been reported .
on the other hand , those who lost hbsag and not seroconverted to anti - hbs with no detectable hbv dna are frequently seen in the clinical practice ; the outcome of this group of patients is not clear .
this study was therefore performed to evaluate the efficacy of hepatitis b vaccine in subjects who were chronically infected with hbv and lost their hbsag over time .
patients and methods selection of the case group from april 1993 to december 2008 , 1603 patients with chronic hbv infection were followed at the department of internal medicine and infectious diseases , babol university of medical sciences , babol , iran .
the departments give service to more than 1.5 million people living in babol , amol , and ghaemshar located in northern iran .
chronic hbv - infected patients were followed at six - month intervals for determination of their viral status .
we provided a follow - up sheet for each person for recording the data during each follow - up. our follow - up protocol was testing for hbsag , hepatitis b e antigen ( hbeag ) if the patient was hbeag - positive , antibody against hbsag ( anti - hbs ) , antibody against hbeag ( anti - hbe ) , serum aspartate aminotransferase ( ast ) , alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) , and alpha - fetoprotein .
liver sonography was performed in those aged over 40 years to find out any evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma .
the viral markers were tested by elisa ( hbsag , from bio merieux , the netherlands ; anti - hbs from radim italy , anti - hbc , hbeag from dia.pro diagnostic bioprobes , italy ) .
these tests were repeated at six - month intervals .
those who lost hbsag and were not seroconverted to anti - hbs with undetectable serum hbv dna were retested six months later .
for isolation of hbv dna from plasma , we used qiaamp dna minikit ( qiagen gmbh ) .
all processes were done based on the manufacturer 's instructions .
for quantification of hbv dna , we used roter - geen 3000 ( corbett research ) using artus hbv rg pcr kit ( qiagen , humburg , germany ) .
according to the kit instructions , the sensitivity of the test was 3.8 iu / ml ( 1 iu = 7 copies / ml ) .
forty - eight ( 2.9 %) patients became hbsag - negative .
among them , two developed anti - hbs antibody and 12 had 50 to 850 copies / ml of hbv dna - both groups were excluded from the study .
therefore , 34 cases ( 22 men , 12 women ) who were hbsag - and hv dna - negative but anti - hbe - and anti - hbc - positive in two occasions six months apart , were selected as the case group z ( table 1 ) .
selection of the control group in the control group , 52 healthy individuals ( 30 men [ 58 %] and 22 [ 42 %] women ) were evaluated .
subjects in the control group have never been exposed to hbv ( negative for hbsag , anti - hbs , and anti - hbc ) .
intervention both groups received 20 microg hepatitis b vaccine ( engerix - b , smithkline beecham ) at 0 , 1 and 6 months .
sera from all subjects were tested for anti - hbs antibody one month after the last dose of the vaccine .
anti - hbs >= 10 iu / l was considered as protective level in both groups .
the study was approved by the infectious diseases research center , babol university of medical sciences .
the ethical committee also approved this study .
informed consent was obtained from all participants .
statistical analysis data were analyzed using spss ( r ) ver 15 .
means of two continuous variables were compared using student 's t test and categorical variables were compared by x ( 2 ) test and fisher 's exact test when appropriate .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results table 1 shows the outcome of 1603 cases with chronic hbv infection during the follow - up period .
our analysis included 34 cases ( 22 men and 12 women ) who were hbsag - and hbv dna - negative but anti - hbe - and anti - hbc - positive .
the mean +/ - sd age of subjects in the case group was 38 +/ - 12.7 years ; it was 33.4 +/ - 8.55 years in the control group ( p = 0.07 ) .
the sex distribution in these two groups were similar ( p = 0.652 ) .
the mean +/ - sd years of follow - up in the case group was 7.65 +/ - 4.5 years .
alt and ast in all cases were within the normal range during the follow - up. after vaccination , a protective anti - hbs antibody level (>= 10 iu / l ) was developed in eight ( 24 %) of subjects in the case group and in 45 ( 87 %) in the control group ( p = 0001 ) ( table 2 ) .
the non - responders were re - evaluated with no changes in their status .
the mean +/ - sd anti - hbs antibody level in the case group was 68 +/ - 32.66 and in the control group was 344.6 +/ - 38.9 iu / l ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 1 ) .

development of anti - hbs antibody may be a clue showing that they have protection and are less likely prone to develop chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 1 ][ 2 ] .
twenty - six individuals in the case group in our study with no response after hepatitis b vaccination may have low levels of hbsag , have immunologic tolerance to hepatitis b vaccination , and have no ability to produce anti - hbs antibody as reported previously [ 9 ] .
in contrast , in the healthy individuals in this study , the response rate was 87 % , like what reported earlier [ 10 ][ 11 ] .
the concept of low level hbsag carriers has further been supported by reports of hbv infection following transfusion of blood from donors with isolated anti - hbc antibody [ 12 ] .
however , incidental finding of cases with negative hbsag and anti - hbs antibody and positive anti - hbc antibody are frequently reported in the intermediate and highly endemic regions of hbv infection [ 11 ][ 13 ][ 14 ][ 15 ][ 16 ][ 17 ] .
these subjects have either chronic hbv infection but had lost hbsag over time or resolved hbv infection with decrease in anti - hbs antibody levels below 10 iu / l. with hepatitis b vaccination of those with isolated anti - hbc antibody , several studies reported significant anti - hbs levels in 91 % - 96 % of the subjects [ 13 ][ 14 ][ 15 ][ 16 ][ 17 ] .
in korea , 34 subjects with persistent isolated anti - hbc antibody who were hbsag - negative received hepatitis b vaccination at 0 , 1 and 2 months ; protective level of anti - hbs antibody was developed in 70.6 % of them .
as we found in our study , the hbv dna was not detectable in any of subjects with isolated anti - hbc antibody who had not responded to hepatitis b vaccination [ 10 ] .
lok , et al , reported no response rate after three doses of hepatitis b vaccine in 28 % of 32 subjects with isolated anti - hbc antibody [ 9 ] .
lai , et al , reported no anti - hbs response in 22.9 % of 48 cases with isolated anti - hbc after three doses of hepatitis b vaccination [ 18 ] .
kabir , et al , found that among 94 cases with isolated anti - hbc who received three doses of hbv vaccines , 19 ( 20.2 %) were non - responders .
they found that previous history of hbsag positivity was associated with decreased response to vaccination [ 19 ] .
the non - responders in the above studies may be due to the presence of low levels of hbsag in their sera or they might have immunologic tolerance to hbsag of the vaccine , as we noted earlier .
the selection of cases in our study ( prior positive hbsag with loss of this marker over time ) compared with those mentioned in the above studies which selected isolated anti - hbc - positive cases may explain the large number of non - responders among our cases .
we think that some isolated anti - hbc cases with negative hbv dna may have ohb .
hbv dna may be present in hepatocytes or other sites and may re - appear later .
investigation of the presence of hbv dna in hepatocytes of these individuals may be helpful and gives a potential answer to this question .
unfortunately , due to ethical considerations , we did not perform liver biopsy in these cases .
at present , an ohb is defined as " isolated anti - hbc cases with detectable hbv dna measured by pcr " [ 2 ] .
in this study , we found that nearly 77 % of those who lost hbsag during follow - up and were negative for hbv dna may still have ohb .
the weakness of this study was the relatively small number of patients studied and lack of liver biopsy for detection of hbv dna in hepatocytes .
another weakness of this study may be related to spontaneous seroconversion in the case group with no relation to vaccination .
other studies with large number of cases with or without vaccination are necessary to confirm our findings .
the results of this study emphasize the hypothesis that chronic hbsag - positive cases who lost their hbsag and are negative for hbv dna in their sera may still have ohb .
in summary , the results showed that nearly 24 % of chronic hbsag - positive cases who lost their hbsag and are negative for hbv dna responded to hepatitis b vaccination ; the remaining people must be followed for ohb .
the authors would like to thank the staffs of razi laboratory for performing the laboratory tests .
implication for health policy / practice / research / medical education : clinicians especially internists should pay more attention in follow - up of patients with chronic hepatitis b infection .
in the management of these patients special attention should be considered to those who lost hbsag during a period of time .

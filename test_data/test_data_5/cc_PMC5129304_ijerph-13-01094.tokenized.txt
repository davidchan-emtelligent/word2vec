background : approximately 35 new hiv ( human immunodeficiency virus , hiv ) cases and at least 1000 serious infections are transmitted annually to health care workers .
in china , hiv prevalence is increasing and nursing personnel are encountering these individuals more than in the past .
contaminated needle - stick injuries represent a significant occupational burden for nurses .
evidence suggests that nurses in china may not fully understand hiv / aids ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , aids ) and hiv - related occupational safety .
at this time , universal protection precautions are not strictly implemented in chinese hospitals .
lack of training may place nurses at risk for occupational exposure to blood - borne pathogens .
objectives : to assess the effectiveness of integrated interventions on nurses' knowledge improvement about reducing the risk of occupationally acquired hiv infection .
methods : we audited integrated interventions using 300 questionnaires collected from nurses at the affiliated hospital of xiangnan university , a public polyclinic in hunan province .
the intervention studied was multifaceted and included appropriate and targeted training content for hospital , department and individual levels .
after three months of occupational safety integrated interventions , 234 participants who completed the program were assessed .
results : of the subjects studied , 94.3 % ( 283 / 300 ) were injured one or more times by medical sharp instruments or splashed by body fluids in the last year and 95.3 % considered their risk of occupational exposure high or very high .
after the intervention , awareness of hiv / aids - related knowledge improved significantly ( chi2 = 86.34 , p = 0.00 ) , and correct answers increased from 67.9 % to 82.34 % .
correct answers regarding risk perception were significantly different between pre - test ( 54.4 %) and post - test ( 66.6 %) ( chi2 = 73.2 , p = 0.00 ) .
when coming into contact with patient body fluids and blood only 24.0 % of subjects used gloves regularly .
the pre - test knowledge scores on universal precautions were relatively high .
correct answers about universal precautions improved significantly from pre - test ( 83.71 %) to post - test ( 89.58 % ; chi2 = 25.00 , p = 0.00 ) .
after the intervention , nurses' attitude scores improved significantly from pre - test ( 3.80 +/ - 0.79 ) to post - test ( 4.06 +/ - 0.75 ; t = 3.74 , p = 0.00 ) .
conclusions : integrated educational interventions enhance nurses' knowledge of risk reduction for occupationally acquired hiv infections and improve the observance of universal precautionary procedures .
this enhancement allows nurses to assume a teaching role for prevention and management of hiv / aids .
nurses occupational exposure hiv knowledge early intervention 1 .
introduction unaids ( the joint united nations programme on hiv / aids , unaids ) and the who ( world health organization , who ) estimate that approximately 37.0 million people worldwide had hiv ( human immunodeficiency virus , hiv ) by the end of 2014 [ 1 ] .
the who defines hiv occupational exposure in health care workers as percutaneous injuries ( e.g. , needle - stick and sharps injuries , nsis ) or the contact of mucous membranes or non - intact skin ( chapped , abraded or diseased ) with blood , tissue , or other body fluids that are potentially hiv - infectious [ 2 ] .
the average risk of hiv transmission from a positive source is estimated to be 0.3 % by a single percutaneous exposure and 0.09 % by mucous membrane exposure. with increasing volumes of blood and viral loads in the exposures , transmission risk is greater [ 3,4 ] .
in 2003 , the who reported that from 14 geographical regions , the burden and fraction of hiv infections attributable to needle / sharp instrument injuries of heath care workers was three million , and these led to about 5.5 % new hiv cases ( range 0.5 % - 11 %) [ 2 ] .
nurses represent the greatest proportion of exposed heath care workers as they are frontline providers who more often encounter patients with hiv / aids and can be more accessible for aids prevention and control .
therefore , nurses are ideally positioned to have a role in hiv / aids prevention [ 5 ] .
in china , 86 % of nurses were reportedly injured by needles and splashed with body fluids , and of these subjects studied 59.7 % were concerned about contracting hiv / aids [ 6 ] .
in contrast , approximately 50 % to 67 % of nsis were unreported [ 7 ] .
worse , some studies suggest that many nurses in china still do not fully understand hiv / aids transmission pathways .
although universal precautions can protect heath care workers from hiv transmission through occupational exposure [ 8 ] , 85 % of nurses lack universal precautions practices and are often occupationally exposed to hiv in rural china [ 9 ] .
moreover , in china , studies about hiv / aids occupational exposures depend on officially reported data and thus few interventions have been undertaken [ 10,11 ] and nurses' roles in hiv / aids prevention and management are less recognized [ 12 ] .
therefore , we studied the incidence of nsis among a cohort of chinese nurses , and their knowledge of and attitudes towards occupational safety related to hiv / aids .
then , we measured the effectiveness of an intervention to improve nurses' knowledge / attitudes about hiv / aids and hiv - related occupational exposures and universal precautions .
2. methods 2.1 .
study setting and participants this study was conducted at the affiliated hospital of xiangnan university located in chenzhou , hunan province , a public polyclinic with more than 1000 beds .
table 1 depicts data for increased prevalence of hiv / aids and hiv tests for the past five years in this hospital .
all participants were clinical registered nurses working across all units ( medical , surgical , pediatric , intensive care , operation room , emergency and oncology ) .
subjects included those with clinical roles involving patient body fluid contact or sharp medical instruments for one year in the past three years ( n = 451 ) .
before the intervention , during a three - day survey , all nurses on duty who satisfied inclusion criteria and voluntary were selected .
after obtaining permission from the hospital management departments and mobilizing by the nursing department , a trained investigator administered 327 questionnaires to the selected nurses at their workplaces .
the investigated nurses sat in separate areas to complete questionnaires anonymously and return them to the investigator on the spot .
there were 300 valid questionnaires and the valid return rate was 91.7 % .
interventions were carried for all nurses in the hospital .
after the intervention , from the original 300 pre - intervention participants , 240 questionnaires were distributed to the post - intervention respondent nurses who finished all intervention programs and on duty during a two - day survey .
2.2 .
study design and procedure this study was conducted from october 2014 to january 2015 and included pre - and post - intervention assessments spaced three months apart .
the interventions focused on occupational safety and included evaluation of intervention efficacy .
a questionnaire was used to document nurses' knowledge and attitude about hiv / aids - related occupational exposures before an intervention anonymously .
then , integrated interventions of multiple stages were used to deliver appropriate and targeted training at hospital , department and individual levels .
after three - months of interventions , another questionnaire was given to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions .
each questionnaire was completed independently and discussion among participants was not allowed .
prior to the official study , the questionnaire was pilot - tested on 31 nurses to determine optimal length and subject comprehension .
face validity was established by expert opinion and test - retest reliability indicated that scores for first and second questionnaires were positively correlated .
all investigated nurses gave their informed consent for study participation .
the study was approved by the institutional review board of xiangnan university ( ect 2013 - 26 ) .
all subject information was kept confidential .
2.3 .
integrated intervention study interventions were divided into five stages , which included appropriate and targeted training content for hospitals , departments or individuals .
as required by management department of the hospital , all nurses should participate in intervention .
the purpose of the intervention was to improve nurses' knowledge and attitude about hiv / aids and hiv - related occupational exposures and universal precautionary measures .
in the first step , at the management level , administrative staff was informed about hiv / aids occupational exposure and improvement with universal precautions .
these information sessions were provided every month to make next .
next , training classes were held for head or key nurses from departments to prepare them to educate other nurses once a month .
during the intervention , three training classes were held for the nurses .
the goals of these classes were to increase general knowledge about hiv / aids including prevention , modes of transmission such as through occupational exposure , post - exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) , treatment or clinical management .
these classes which included lectures with discussions demonstrations and small group sessions also measured attitudes for caring for individuals with hiv / aids .
in the third intervention stage , peer education was performed by nurses for nurses in all departments .
the head or key departmental nurses explained the knowledge learned from training courses including hiv epidemiology , modes of transmission , natural disease history , early symptoms , diagnostic testing , occupational exposure and post - exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) .
the aim of peer education was to increase clinical nurses' occupational safety knowledge as well as to modify attitudes towards hiv / aids .
in the fourth stage , the intervention was accelerated via the distribution of materials for prevention of occupational exposures to hiv , using knowledge contests ( quizzes or question - and - answer games ) , organizing universal precautions skill competitions and with invitations to front - line staff to share experiences with carding for hiv - positive patients .
finally , the effects of the integrated interventions were assessed using chi2 - test analyses .
2.4 .
measures the pre - intervention questionnaire included 48 questions divided into four sections .
the first section collected demographic information ( age , education , marital status , department , total years employed as a nurse ) .
the second section included nine questions about occupational injuries and related outcomes .
in the third section , 28 questions addressed hiv / aids and occupational exposure - related knowledge ( six covered basic hiv / aids knowledge ; nine covered exposure risk perception ; eight were about universal precautionary protection ; and five were about post - exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) ; the fourth section included five questions focused on nurses' attitudes about hiv / aids ) .
these questions were developed after reviewing the relevant literature .
all 33 questions for the third and the forth sections for the pre - intervention questionnaire were repeated in the post - intervention questionnaire .
intervention effects were assessed by improvements in knowledge and attitude based on scores to these 33 questions .
2.5 .
data analysis data were assessed with pasw statistics 18 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) software .
scales were used for correct answers and a dichotomous point scale was used to measure the intervention effect on knowledge and beliefs .
correct answers before and after the intervention were compared using a chi - squared test .
mean knowledge / attitude scores were compared using an independent two - sample student 's t - test .
each correct answer was one point and an incorrect answer was 0 points ( p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant ) .
3. results prior to the intervention , 300 questionnaires were collected , and , among these , 234 participants completed the program .
anova confirmed no significant differences in socio - demographic factors for pre - intervention and post - intervention samples .
table 2 depicts the nurses' demographic characteristics .
table 3 depicts injuries reported and reasons for them .
post - intervention scores confirmed that hiv / aids - related knowledge improved significantly and these data appear in table 4 .
nurses' perceptions of risk of occupational exposure were high or very high and these data appear in table 5 .
nurses' personal precaution habits for handling patient body fluids varied and these data appear in table 6 .
the intervention improved personal protection awareness and correct responses increased for these five questions in the post - test .
data appear in table 7 and table 8 .
after the intervention , nurses' attitudes about " sympathy for the suffering experienced by hiv / aids patients " and " do not agree that the majority of hiv / aids patients are suffering the consequences of their action " changed significantly ( table 8 ) and scores were higher after the intervention .
4. discussion approximately 35 new hiv cases and at least 1000 serious infections are reported annually by health care workers [ 13,14 ] .
hiv exposure and subsequent hiv positivity arising from health care occupational exposures appear to be relatively rare .
however , contaminated nsis represent a significant occupational burden for nurses .
the prevalence of hiv / aids is increasing in china , and this means that hospital personnel are increasingly being exposed to hazardous body fluids from patients with hiv / aids as well as encountering injuries from contaminated sharp instruments .
in the previous 12 months , among professional korean nurses nsis totaled 1.31 events / nurse / year ) .
table 3 depicts data regarding injuries from medical sharp instruments or splashed body fluids in the last year and the data show that nurses are at greater risk for hiv or hepatitis b and c [ 15 ] .
although 95.3 % of investigated nurses in our study considered their risk of occupational exposure to be high or very high , they did fail to follow universal protection precautions .
when contacting patient body fluids / blood , only 24.0 % used gloves regularly .
they also improperly disposed of medical waste which caused most of the occupational exposures [ 16 ] .
universal precaution protocols exist in china ; however , if preventable , exposures are often accepted as being inherent to the job and not true hazards [ 17 ] .
therefore , improving knowledge of professional behaviors is essential to minimize occupational exposures to hiv .
before our intervention , chinese nurses did not fully understand hiv / aids , as the knowledge test suggested that 67.9 % were correct about hiv ; 54.4 % gave correct answers about risk perception ; 83.7 % were correct about universal precautions ; and 65.4 % were correct about hiv post - exposure prophylaxis .
knowledge about the importance of starting post - exposure prophylaxis early is very low ( 28.7 %) .
only 30.3 % have previously received occupational safety special training .
the lack of awareness and related training may influence discrimination of hiv patients [ 18 ] .
thirteen percent agreed that patients with hiv / aids should be treated only in infectious diseases hospitals .
discriminatory or unethical behavior toward patients with hiv / aids exists among health care professionals , as documented in other countries , which may interfere with effective prevention and treatment [ 19 ] .
effective measures to prevent nurses from occupational exposure include universal precautions , eliminating unnecessary injections , education , use of sharp instrument containers for disposal , and elimination of needle recapping , and these have reduced nsis by 80 % [ 12,16 ] .
a case - control study documented that prompt initiation of zidovudine can decrease the risk of acquiring hiv by 81 % after occupational exposure [ 20 ] .
post - exposure prophylaxis has come to be accepted as a standard of care for the prevention of hiv infection after a hospital - associated occupational exposure. with the accelerating hiv epidemic in china , a well - designed educational program should be implemented as soon as possible .
the integrated educational intervention implemented in this study was multifaceted , included appropriate and targeted training content , and included the hospital , the department and the individual .
specifically , these interventions included lectures with discussions , demonstrations , small group sessions , and peer education .
group discussion was necessary to decrease fear and hiv discrimination and nurses improved scores on all 33 questionnaire items about knowledge and attitudes regarding hiv - related issues , universal precautions , occupational hiv exposure and post - exposure prophylaxis , and most of them were statistically significant improvements after the intervention .
the post - test knowledge scores on universal precautions were only marginally improved .
improving knowledge on universal precautions as a very important regular training program is often inspected by the infection control department in this hospital .
so , the pre - test scores on universal precaution were relatively high , except the item on whether the contaminated bedding and clothing should be classified for disposal .
the most important preventive measures to reduce occupational hbv ( viral hepatitis type b ) , hiv , and hcv ( viral hepatitis type c ) in health care workers are education and observance of routine procedures [ 11 ] .
our integrated educational intervention enhanced nurses' knowledge about reducing the risk of occupationally acquired hiv infection and improved observance of universal precautions , and these events decreased fear and discrimination of hiv / aids patients as well as increased their willingness to care for these individuals .
this improved the quality of care delivered to hiv / aid patients created a novel understanding of nurses as hiv / aids educators in a prevention plan [ 11 ] .
limitations of the study include the single institution , the self - control before and after the intervention , and the short - term nature of the evaluation only at the individual level .
because this study uses cross - sectional convenience sampling with only self - control , results are not generalizable to other nurses in china .
the short - term multifaceted hiv / aids educational intervention cannot allow the study of any improvements in behavior or observance of routine precautionary procedures in everyday work either .
therefore , more studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on the reduction of risk for occupational exposure in china .
assessment on the effectiveness of the integrated intervention should be done in different hospitals and at every level including individual and administrative departments of the hospital .
5. conclusions in china , contaminated nsis represent a significant occupational burden for nurses .
however , the nurses did not fully understand hiv / aids , and they did fail to follow universal protection precautions .
so , hiv / aids - related educational programs across a broader spectrum of knowledge and attitudes about hiv / aids in work settings are needed .
the professional and integrated educational intervention will facilitate an attitude change towards hiv / aids and the nurses' observance of universal precaution routine procedures in everyday work , in addition to increasing knowledge about hiv / aids and how to reduce their risk of occupationally acquired hiv infection .
this enhancement allows nurses to assume a teaching role for the prevention and management of hiv / aids .

we report the draft genome sequence of mycobacterium heraklionense strain davo , isolated from a fine - needle aspirate of a right - ankle soft - tissue mass .
this is the first draft genome sequence of mycobacterium heraklionense , a nonpigmented rapidly growing mycobacterium .
cover - datejuly / august 2015 genome announcement mycobacterium heraklionense is an unpigmented member of the mycobacterium terrae complex that was originally isolated from heraklion , a city in crete , greece ( 1 ) .
it is an uncommon cause of infection of humans , with the first case reported only in 2014 ( 2 ) .
mycobacterium heraklionense has also been reported to have been isolated from water treatment sludge ( 3 ) .
the notable phenotypic characteristics of mycobacterium heraklionense include an intermediate growth rate , smooth colonies with no pigmentation , positive nitrate reduction , and positive beta - glucosidase activity ( 1 ) .
rapidly growing mycobacteria constitute a commonly isolated population of acid - fast bacilli in the clinical microbiology lab of varying clinical importance , and molecular methods are often the only means of rapidly discriminating between them ( 4 , 5 ) .
we sequenced the first draft genome of mycobacterium heraklionense from a fine - needle aspiration sample from a 53 - year - old woman , who presented to an orthopedic surgery clinic in 2014 with a right - medial soft - tissue ankle mass .
the patient had previously had a repair of a transverse laceration of her right achilles tendon after a gardening accident 20 years prior .
cytological analysis of the aspirate revealed purulent fluid consistent with an inflamed cyst , and the acid - fast bacillus culture returned positive on day 14 of culture .
the isolate was originally typed as mycobacterium heraklionense based on partial rpob sequencing .
susceptibility testing showed the following mics ( mug / ml ) : amikacin , <= 2 ; ciprofloxacin , > 4 ; clarithromycin , >= 4 ; ethambutol , 1.25 ; kanamycin , 8 ; moxifloxacin , > 2 ; rifabutin , 0.25 ; rifampin , > 16 ; and streptomycin , 4 .
no other bacteria or yeast were recovered from the aspirate .
dna from m. heraklionense strain davo was extracted using the qiagen ez1 kit , and paired - end libraries were prepared using the nextera xt dna library kit , followed by 2 x 250 - bp sequencing on illumina hiseq .
sequences were adapter and quality trimmed ( q30 ) using cutadapt , de novo assembled using spades version 3.5 , metagenomically screened for contaminating sequence with surpi , and annotated via prokka version 1.1 ( 6 - 9 ) .
a total of 11,595,000 paired - end reads with an average length of 181 nucleotides were recovered after trimming .
de novo assembly yielded 75 contigs for a total assembly size of 5,109,749 bp with an n50 of 187,081 bp , an average coverage of 337x , and a total of 4,742 coding sequences .
contiguity was most likely disrupted by the high gc content ( 68 %) , along with several high - copy - number integrases , transposases , and recombinases that were longer than the sequence read length .
a 55.5 - kb contig that was present at a 20 - fold - higher copy number than other genomic contigs demonstrated 65 % nucleotide identity to a variety of mycobacterium phages , including saal , sparky , and captaintrips ( 10 ) .
blastn analysis of the complete 16s sequence from strain davo showed 100 % identity to m. heraklionense type strain nctc 13432 , while other top hits included members of the m. terrae complex , including m. arupense , m. senuense , and mycobacterium sp. jdm601 .
no high - confidence antibiotic resistance genes were identified by comprehensive antibiotic resistance database analysis ( 11 ) .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
this whole - genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj / ena / genbank under the accession number ldpo00000000 .
the assembly described in this paper is the first version , ldpo01000000 .

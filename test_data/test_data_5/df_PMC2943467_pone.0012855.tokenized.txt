background npm1 gene at chromosome 5q35 is involved in recurrent translocations in leukemia and lymphoma .
it also undergoes mutations in 60 % of adult acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) cases with normal karyotype .
the incidence and significance of npm1 deletion in human leukemia have not been elucidated .
methodology and principal findings bone marrow samples from 145 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) and aml were included in this study .
cytogenetically 43 cases had isolated 5q - , 84 cases had 5q - plus other changes and 18 cases had complex karyotype without 5q deletion .
fish and direct sequencing investigated the npm1 gene .
npm1 deletion was an uncommon event in the " 5q - syndrome " but occurred in over 40 % of cases with high risk mds / aml with complex karyotypes and 5q loss .
it originated from large 5q chromosome deletions .
simultaneous exon 12 mutations were never found .
npm1 gene status was related to the pattern of complex cytogenetic aberrations .
npm1 haploinsufficiency was significantly associated with monosomies ( p < 0.001 ) and gross chromosomal rearrangements , i.e. , markers , rings , and double minutes ( p < 0.001 ) , while npm1 disomy was associated with structural changes ( p = 0.013 ) .
interestingly , in complex karyotypes with 5q - tp53 deletion and / or mutations are not specifically associated with npm1 deletion .
conclusions and significance npm1 / 5q35 deletion is a consistent event in mds / aml with a 5q - / - 5 in complex karyotypes .
npm1 deletion and npm1 exon 12 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive and are associated with two distinct cytogenetic subsets of mds and aml .
introduction in humans , nucleophosmin ( npm1 ) is implicated in the genesis of different cancers [ 1 ] .
we previously found npm1 exon 12 somatic mutations in approximately 60 % of adult acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) and normal karyotype [ 2 ] .
npm1 fusion proteins are also specifically involved : t ( 5 ; 17 )( q35 ; q21 )/ npm1 - rara causes acute promyelocytic leukemia ; t ( 2 ; 5 )( p23 ; q35 )/ npm1 - alk underlies anaplastic large cell lymphoma ; t ( 3 ; 5 )( q26 ; q35 )/ npm1 - mlf1 is associated with myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) and aml with trilineage dysplasia and poor prognosis ( http :// atlasgeneticsoncology.org ) .
in the last cytogenetic subgroup of mds / aml a cryptic loss of npm1 gene may occur at the 5q35 breakpoint of the translocation [ 3 ] .
despite of this sporadic observation the role of npm1 deletion in hematological malignancies remains to be elucidated .
in human leukemia an interstitial isolated deletion at chromosome 5q identifies a myelodysplastic syndrome with a benign clinical course ( the " 5q - syndrome ") [ 4 ] .
moreover a partial or complete 5q loss ( 5q - / - 5 ) may occur as part of a complex karyotype in high risk mds / aml , including cases arising after radio - and / or chemo - therapy [ 5 ] .
chromosomes 5q - are heterogeneous in size as deleted segments vary in extension and have different centromeric and telomeric breakpoints [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
experimental evidences indicate that the 5q - syndrome originates from haploinsufficiency of more than one critical pathogenetic gene included in the hemizygous chromosome deletion [ 8 ] - [ 12 ] .
thus identification of genes that go lost in different 5q - chromosomes of mds and aml is very important to understand the pathophysiology of the associated malignant disorders .
focusing on npm1 gene we investigated a large series of mds and aml with and without a 5q deletion .
materials and methods patient inclusion criteria aml or mds and one of the following abnormal karyotypes , according to the iscn [ 13 ] : isolated 5q - ; 5q - / - 5 plus one or more additional changes ( non - isolated ) ; complex karyotypes without 5q - / - 5 .
145 patients ( 60 males ; 85 females ; age range 9 - 94 years ; 71 with mds and 74 with aml ) were recruited from the hematological institutions , university of perugia , italy , sant pau hospital , barcelona , spain , and the demokritos cancer centre , athens , greece .

total rna was extracted using trizol ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol with minor modifications .
two micrograms of total rna were treated with 4 units of dnase i ( deoxyribonuclease i amplification grade , sigma ) in a total volume of 11 microl .
one microgram of treated rna was reverse transcribed to single strand cdna according to the eac protocol [ 15 ] and 1 microg was used in a control reaction ( - rt ) using the same procedure without the m - mlv reverse transcriptase enzyme ( perkin elmer applied biosystems , foster city , usa ) .
the rt - qpcr mixture reaction contained 12.5 microl taq man universal pcr master mix ( life technologies ) , 300 nm primers , 200 nm probe and 5 microl cdna ( 1 / 10 of rt product ) , in a total volume of 25 microl .

rt - qpcr reactions and fluorescence measurements were performed on an abi prism 7700 sequence detection system ( life technologies ) .
gene expression levels of npm1 and abl1 were detected using specific assays on demand ( life technologies ) following the manufacturer 's instructions : id : hs02339479 _ g1 ( exon 4 - 5 ) for npm1 and id : hs00245445 _ m1 ( exon 3 - 4 ) for abl1 .
rt - qpcr reactions were performed in quadruplicate for npm1 and in duplicate for abl1 .
npm1 transcript levels were quantified relative to endogenous abl1 and expressed as 2 - deltadeltact [ 17 ] .
universal human reference rna ( stratagene , la jolla , ca , usa ) was used as calibrator in all experiments .
a threshold value of 0.1 was used throughout the study .
statistical analysis inter - group differences were analyzed by non parametric tests using first analysis of variance ( anova ) with the kruskal - wallis test to compare three groups and the mann - whitney u test to compare two .
if significant , multiple comparisons were carried out using the mann - whitney u test with the bonferroni correction ( i.e. 0.05 / numbers of comparisons ) .
the multivariable poisson regression model analyzed the adjusted effect of npm1 and tp53 on gross chromosomal changes and monosomies .
contingency tables studied associations among categorical variables which were analyzed by fisher 's exact test for 2x2 tables or the chi - square test .
unless otherwise indicated , significance was set at < 0.05 .
spss version 17.0 software ( chicago , il ) was used for statistical analysis .

results and discussion one hundred forty five patients with mds / aml ( 60 males and 85 females ; median age = 68 years , range 9 - 94 ) were included in the study ( table s1 ) .
the mono - allelic npm1 deletion was a very infrequent lesion in the " 5q - syndrome " because it was not detected in 42 / 43 cases .
it identified two molecular sub - groups , here named npm1 +/ - and npm1 +/+ , since it was present in 38 / 84 ( 45 %) cases with complex karyotypes and 5q - . interestingly lessard et al .
[ 18 ] demonstrated loss of the 5q35 chromosome band in 30 % of de novo and therapy related aml .
npm1 loss may have occurred as an early step in mds / aml as it remained stably mono - allelic in 4 npm1 +/ - patients and did not develop in 6 npm1 +/+ over a median of 9 months follow - up ( range : 2 - 156 months ) ( table 2 ) .

the npm1 loss was not cryptic since it was absent in 18 patients with complex karyotypes without 5q - ( table s1 ) .
chromosome 5q breakpoints were distributed over a wide chromosomal area within genomic regions which extended beyond the isolated 5q deletion breakpoints .
in npm1 +/ - patients telomeric breakpoints clustered between npm1 and fgfr4 ( approximately 5.7 megabases ) in 4 / 16 cases and included subtelomeric sequences in 12 ( 75 %) ( figure 1a,b,c , and table s1 ) .
centromeric breakpoints involved chromosome bands from q11.2 to q14.1 in more than 50 % and were proximal to rp11 - 80k5 ( figure 1a,b,c , and table s1 ) .
notably in cases with isolated 5q deletions centromeric breakpoints always fell distally to rp11 - 80k5 ( figure 1a and table s1 ) .

b ) g - banded karyotype of a representative case ( n.103 , supporting table s1 ) showed a complex karyotype including monosomies , unbalanced translocations , five markers , and a very small deleted chromosome 5 corresponding to the largest 5q deletion including npm1 with breakpoints at q11.2 and q35.3 ( right ideogram ) .
c ) fish of case n.103 : concomitant deletion of rp11 - 117l6 / npm1 ( green ) and rp11 - 266n13 ( red ) indicate centromeric breakpoint ( left ) and rp1 - 240g13 / subtelomeric sequences ( red ) indicate telomeric breakpoint ( right ) .
only one copy of each clone is present .
d ) gene sequencing of case n.103 shows no npm1 exon 12 mutation in the non - deleted chromosome 5 .
the last 12 amino acids encoded by exon 12 of wild type npm1 ( nm _ 002520 ) are annotated on top of the sequence .
exon 12 mutations were not found in this study indicating that monoallelic npm1 deletion and heterozygous mutation can not occur at the same time ( figure 1d and table s1 ) .
furthermore , the npm1 deletion corresponded to reduced npm1 expression in mds / aml cells which was significantly lower in npm1 +/ - cases than in the npm1 +/+ ( p < 0.001 ) and normal controls ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 2 ) .
notably , npm1 is a multifunctional protein which regulates ribosome biogenesis , tp53 protein activity and stability , arf protein stability and localization , and dna integrity [ 1 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
in keeping with evidence from murine models [ 21 ] , in which npm1 loss induced morphological signs of mds , favored c - myc lymphomagenesis and underlay chromosomal instability , chromosome rearrangements constituting complex karyotypes were significantly different in npm1 +/ - and npm1 +/+ patients .
in npm1 +/+ structural chromosome rearrangements ( translocations ; deletions ; insertions ; inversions ) were significantly more frequent ( median 3 , range 0 - 7 vs median 1.5 , range 0 - 5 ; p = 0.013 ) ( table s2 ) but in the npm1 +/ - group gross chromosomal changes ( markers i.e. derivative chromosomes unclassified by karyotyping , rings , and double minutes ) were significantly more common ( median 3 , range 0 - 9 vs median 0 , range 0 - 6 ; p < 0.001 ) ( table s2 ) .
aneuploidy was present in 47 / 64 npm1 +/+ patients ( 73 %) and in 38 / 38 npm1 +/ - patients ( 100 %) ( p < 0.001 ) .
significantly more monosomies were found in the npm1 +/ - subgroup ( median 2 , range 0 - 8 vs median 1 , range 0 - 6 ; p < 0.001 ) ( table s2 ) , with the most frequent , monosomy 7 , being detected in 18 / 38 ( 47 %) of npm1 +/ - and in 11 / 64 ( 17 %) of npm1 +/+ ( p = 0.002 ) .

( p values according to the mann - whitney u test and bonferroni correction ) ; n.s .
= non significant .
since npm1 is related to tp53 [ 19 ] , , a master gene of chromosome stability that is frequently involved in mds / aml with complex karyotype [ 24 ] , 57 cases from this series were investigated ( table 3 and tables1 ) .
univariate analysis on tp53 and chromosome rearrangements showed a significant association between the number of monosomies and tp53 deletion and / or mutation ( median 2 range 0 - 8 vs median 0 range 0 - 3 ; p = 0.006 ) ( table s3 ) .
however , both npm1 and tp53 gene status maintained significant association with monosomies in a multivariate analysis ( p = 0.014 and p = 0.013 , respectively ) ( poisson regression model ) , suggesting each gene plays an independent role , but may interact synergistically , in determining chromosomal abnormalities .

npm1 loss was not associated with copy number variations of 14 genes other than tp53 that are putatively involved in the complex regulatory network of genetic stability .
gains and losses of clones containing bub1a , atr , fbw7 , c - myc , cdkn2a - 2b , pten , chek1 , atm , mdm2 , brca2 , rb1 , bub1b , brca , chek2 were equally distributed in npm1 +/+ and npm1 +/ - cases ( figure 3 ) , suggesting that whatever roles these genes play in mds / aml with complex karyotypes , they are independent of the npm1 deletion .

gains ( upper ) and losses ( lower ) in npm1 +/+ patients ( white columns ) and npm1 +/ - ( grey columns ) .
in conclusion these findings prove that haploinsufficiency of the npm1 gene , is present in more than 40 % of patients with high risk mds / aml characterised by chromosome 5q - and complex karyotypes .
npm1 haploinsufficiency and mutation appear to exert very different effects ( figure 4 ) as patients with npm1 mutated - aml have normal karyotype , rare tp53 involvement , good prognosis if flt3 - itd mutations are absent , and a predominance of females [ 2 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
npm1 haploinsufficiency was not linked to female gender ( table s4 ) .
it significantly reduced npm1 expression and , in synergy but independently of tp53 deletion and / or mutation , was associated with a strong tendency to perturb chromosomal stability .
consequently npm1 gene status appears to indicate diverse genetic backgrounds in two different myeloid leukemias .

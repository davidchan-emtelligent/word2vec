( https :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 /) introduction researchers and regulators need to know how changes to cigarette packages can influence population health .
we sought to advance research on the role of cigarette packaging by assessing a theory - informed framework from the fields of design and consumer research .
the selected context of consumption framework posits cognitive , affective , and behavioral responses to visual design .
to assess the framework 's potential for guiding research on the visual design of cigarette packaging in the u.s. , this study seeks to understand to what extent the context of consumption framework converges with how adult smokers think and talk about cigarette pack designs .
methods data for this qualitative study came from six telephone - based focus groups conducted in march 2017 .
two groups consisted of lesbian , gay , and bisexual participants ; two groups of participants with less than four years college education ; one group of lgb and straight identity ; and one group the general population .
all groups were selected for regional , gender , and racial / ethnic diversity .
participants ( n = 33 ) represented all nine u.s. census divisions .
we conducted a deductive qualitative analysis .
results cigarette package designs captured the participants' attention , suggested the characteristics of the product , and reflected ( or could be leveraged to convey ) multiple dimensions of consumer identity .
particular to the affective responses to design , our participants shared that cigarette packaging conveyed how the pack could be used to particular ends , created an emotional response to the designs , complied with normative expectations of a cigarette , elicited interest when designs change , and prompted fascination when unique design characteristics are used .
conclusions use of the context of consumption framework for cigarette product packaging design can inform regulatory research on tobacco product packaging .
researchers and regulators should consider multiple cognitive , affective , and behavioral responses to cigarette pack design .
product packaging tobacco products tobacco industry government regulation united states food and drug administration introduction the passing of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act of 2009 ( fsptca ) gave the u.s. food and drug administration ( fda ) the authority to regulate tobacco products , including premarket review authority for ' new tobacco products'1 .
premarket review requires that new tobacco products , not substantially equivalent to a predicated tobacco product , demonstrate that they are appropriate for the protection of public health .
this is a robust standard that must take into account users and non - users alike in an attempt to assess the net population - level health impacts of tobacco products1,2 .
including packaging as part of the premarket review is critical when assessing whether product changes have implications for population health1,3,4 .
reynolds 's camel no .
9 brand , for example , with its sleek pink and black packaging , was associated with an upswing in adolescent female smoking5 .
industry documents show how changes to product packaging have likely resulted in population - level changes in smoking patterns by increasing smoking among women6,7 .
however , fda attempts to regulate changes to pack design have met with repeated legal challenges by the tobacco industry8 .
the authority of the fda hinges on the strength of the scientific literature on how changes to the visual design of cigarette packs can influence consumer responses .
it is critical that fda regulations be able to draw upon scientific evidence designed to inform them9 .
previous research in the fields of consumer behavior and design has shown that product packaging influences consumer perceptions for a myriad of consumable products10 - 12 .
particular to the tobacco - control literature , numerous studies have examined product packaging from specific vantage points , including plain packaging and graphic warning labels13 - 16 .
however , few studies have focused on pack design among u.s. smokers .
moreover , no research has leveraged a theory - informed framework that could guide researcher understanding of different types of consumer responses to cigarette pack design .
the fda calls for research to inform efforts to '[ r ] estrict product changes to protect public health ' as part of its framework of tobacco regulatory research ( ashley et al.9 p. 1047 ) .
to answer this call , we draw on an influential context of consumption framework from the field of design by crilly and colleagues17 ( figure 1 ) that focuses on the visual design of products .
use of such a theory - informed framework could open new areas of research to support science - based regulation of tobacco products .
utilizing the context of consumption framework for cigarette pack design research to introduce the reader to the context of consumption framework , we first use it to organize a brief overview of selected research on the role of cigarette packaging on consumer perceptions .
we focus in particular on research based in the u.s. as it provides a unique regulatory context for this work , given the absence of graphic warning labels and preclusion of plain packaging requirements .
as shown in figure 1 , a producer 's design team creates the visual design of a product .
previous research has leveraged tobacco industry documents to describe the internal decisions of the tobacco industry ( i.e. the producer ) and its own testing of pack characteristics3,6,18,19 .
our interest , however , is centered on how consumers respond to product design after the product is generated .
the context of consumption framework posits theory - informed consumer responses to the product now created by the design team .
these are cognitive , affective , and behavioral responses .
while these responses will be recognized as core concepts in psychology20 , the framework expands these to include a typology of responses that could inform tobacco product regulation .
the context of consumption framework breaks down cognitive responses into three types : aesthetic impression that denotes the appealing nature of the design , as well as its contrast ( in its own design and against others ) and novelty , linking or contrasting the product to other similar products .
in previous research , a cross - sectional study assessed the ability of the pack design to attract attention and rated packs for attractiveness11 , while an experiment assessed the appeal of women - oriented packaging21 .
globally , packs have been rated for similar responses , e.g. being ' worth looking at'22 .
semantic interpretation that denotes the apparent utility of the product and its perceived qualities , assessed in the literature as effectiveness11 , health11,12,21 , nicotine12 , quality11 , tar11,12,21 , and taste11,12,21 .
globally , researchers found evidence to support that packaging communicates information about the cigarettes within ( e.g. ford et al.22 , guillaumier et al.23 ) .
finally , symbolic association that denotes how the product reflects users' identities .
we identified one study that experimentally tested women - oriented pack designs21 and a cross - sectional study that rated packs based on ' concern with image'12 .
globally , there are similar findings , including about emerging products24 - 26 .
the context of consumption framework suggests another type of response , affective , labeled ' affect ' in figure 1 .
affective response can be a feeling , mood , or emotion prompted by the product20 .
the context of consumption framework posits five different types of affective responses evoked by the product : instrumental , emotions based on the perception of whether the product will fulfill the consumer 's objectives ( e.g. satisfaction ) ; aesthetic , emotions based on how the product might delight or offend ( e.g. attraction ) ; social , emotions based on social norms about the product ( e.g. admiration ) ; surprise , emotions based on novelty ( e.g. amazement ) ; interest , emotions based on the promise and challenge of the product ( e.g. fascination ) .
we identified no u.s. studies that have considered affective response to tobacco product pack designs , although affective responses to marketing of alternative tobacco products have been documented27 .
evidence about behavior , which describes consumers' approach or avoidance of a product , largely comes from epidemiological cohort studies and surveys that did not directly assess responses to cigarette packs ( e.g. pierce et al.5 ) .
globally , researchers have documented the importance of pack design on behavior16 .
thus , the context of consumption framework provides three cognitive , five affective , and two behavioral responses that could result from the visual design of cigarette packs .
as evidenced in this brief , selected review , a conceptual framework can identify gaps in the evidence base .
for example , we find relatively little work on affective responses to the design of cigarette packs .
these gaps , when identified in the u.s. , represent weaknesses in the scientific evidence available to develop , implement , and defend strong science - based regulations of tobacco products .
this paper thus aimed to assess the potential for using the context of consumption framework in research on consumer responses to tobacco product packaging .
specifically , we attempt to answer the question : ' do smokers' responses to cigarette pack design align or diverge from the context of consumption framework ?' .
if smokers' responses to cigarette pack design show alignment with the context of consumption framework , this would provide evidence that tobacco regulatory - science researchers should consider assessing cognitive , affective , and behavioral responses .
alternatively , if smokers' responses diverge , this would suggest parts of the context of consumption framework could be omitted in tobacco regulatory - science research or that there may be other responses that should be examined .
methods this paper is a secondary analysis of qualitative data collected for a research project , funded by the national cancer institute and the fda , entitled ' cigarette packaging : design , cognition , and consumer choices' ( r03ca212542 ) 28 .
following best practices in tobacco regulatory science29 , our research included a lawyer trained in tobacco regulatory science ( krg ) in the entire research process .
in march 2017 , we created six focus groups with adults who were current smokers .
to maximize the geographic diversity of these groups , we conducted interviews of the groups by telephone .
telephone - based focus groups are increasingly being used and come with advantages : including logistics , anonymity of participants , and geographical representation30,31 .
use of video - based groups would have omitted participants without internet access , and use of in - person focus groups would have omitted participants from many regions of the country .
participants were recruited from the national opinion research center ( norc ) at the university of chicago 's amerispeak panel , which is a probability - based , nationally representative panel .
participants for the focus groups were purposively recruited .
recruitment screening was conducted by norc with the attempt to maximize diversity by race , ethnicity , region , sexual orientation , and gender .
we included a focus on sexual minority ( e.g. lesbian , gay , and bisexual ) and low - socioeconomic status smokers , as both groups are at much higher risk of tobacco use than the general population32 .
we did this to ensure that groups at high risk of tobacco use would be well represented in our groups .
two focus groups consisted of sexual minority participants , two focus groups consisted of lower socioeconomic status participants ( classified as less than 4 years of college education ) , one focus group consisted of sexual minority and straight participants , and one focus group consisted of the general population .
participants were compensated by norc for their participation in amerispeak ' points ' .
all groups were moderated by an experienced norc staff person and lasted 60 - 90 minutes .
two authors ( jgll , pea ) attended each group and confirmed saturation of themes .
audio was recorded after participants verbally consented .
recordings were professionally transcribed using a smooth verbatim protocol .
we developed a semi - structured focus - group guide designed to elicit thoughts about the meaning and design of cigarette packs , with questions designed to assess the cognitive , affective , and behavioral domains of the context of consumption framework .
this guide is available online28 .
we did not include visual stimuli in this study ; instead , we asked participants to talk about the design of cigarette packs they had encountered .
for example , we used probes such as : ' tell us what the cigarette pack of your first cigarette looked like ' and ' tell me about a time at any point in your life that " your brand " changed its packaging ; how did it make you feel ?' .
this added to the richness of the discussion , as one participant would ask what a pack that was being discussed by another participant looked like. that is , instead of asking for responses to stimuli provided by researchers , we asked about salient memories and participants' own packs or packs they recalled .
prior research has examined and confirmed the role of senses , such as touch33 in relation to cigarette packs ; we thus focused on visual responses .
we tested the guide in a pilot focus group of seven people and used the results to inform our probes in the six groups .
analysis as we wished to assess an existing framework , we used a deductive qualitative analysis method34 .
in deductive coding , data are sorted as they fit with existing concepts ( or codes ) of an a priori framework , i.e. the different response types of the context of consumption framework .
we coded in four levels of analysis : open coding , axial coding , selective coding , and a negative case analysis .
first , in open coding , we coded the text using codes derived a priori from the context of consumption framework .
second , in axial coding , we further analyzed data within the context of consumption framework codes .
here , we attended to groupings or sub - themes within the concept to see if further refinement of the context of consumption framework was possible .
third , in selective coding , the data were further examined to see if there was a possible reduction to a single category or core concept .
fourth , a negative case analysis examined data that did not fit with the a priori context of consumption framework .
this analysis process was conducted by one author ( pea , a professor of social work and qualitative methodologist ) and discussed , refined , and verified with a second ( jgll , a tobacco control and public health researcher ) at each stage .
a third author ( tb , a consumer behavior researcher ) also refined codes in the selective coding stage .
the analysis team included past experience smoking cigarettes and a short phase as a social smoker , but no member of the team currently uses tobacco products .
we provide quotes selected for their representativeness of each theme .
we used best practices in qualitative research to ensure the reproducibility of our study35 .
these include credibility , dependability , transferability , and confirmability .
to address these , we engaged in triangulation of analysis , an audit trail , and research journal and peer debriefing .
participants the six focus groups had 33 participants of whom 29 fully completed the group , one dropped out after completing most of the group ( i.e. 1 hour and 10 minutes ) , one dropped out after 40 minutes , and two dropped after 20 minutes .
dropping out was not reported to be about the content of the study. of the 33 participants , 36 % identified as lgb , 49 % as having less than four years college education , 49 % identified as white , 24 % as black , 9 % as hispanic , 3 % as american indian , and 15 % as multi - racial .
participants represented all 9 u.s. census divisions .
six participants ( 18 %) did not have internet access at their homes .
all reported current smoking based on 100 cigarettes in lifetime and currently smoking some days ( 6 %) or every day ( 94 %) ; 46 % usually smoked menthol .
fifty - eight per cent smoked their first cigarette of the day within 30 minutes of waking up. age ranged from 22 to 62 years , with a mean of 46 ( sd = 11.5 ) , and most participants identified themselves as female ( 64 %) .
results consistent with the context of consumption framework , we found support for the a priori themes of cognition ( sub - themes : aesthetic , semantic , symbolic ) , affective response ( sub - themes : instrumental , aesthetic , social , surprise , and interest ) , and behavior .
based on the negative case analysis , we do not find cause to modify or reject any parts of the framework .
cognitive , affective , and behavioral responses to the visual design of cigarette packs are supported by the data in this study .
we did not identify any differences by the composition of the focus groups .
cognition within the context of consumption framework , after the initial sensory experience , cognition is one key aspect of consumer response .
according to the context of consumption framework , cognitive responses are judgments made by the consumer based on provided visual information .
the cognition category includes three specific areas of response , as described and discussed below .
aesthetic aesthetic impression addresses consumers' overall judgments about a product 's attractiveness or unattractiveness .
typically , consumers contrast products against one another in terms of novelty or similarity to make aesthetic judgments .
we found strong support for the role of attractiveness , for example : '... they look cool because they 're just so bright and different than the rest of the cigarettes such as pall mall .
you do n't notice those on the shelf but american spirits you would . '
( group 2 , lower education ) , ' the black and gold , my eye just directly goes straight to it . '
( group 3 , lgb ) .
however , it is of note that the participants did not provide clear descriptions of cigarette packages that were judged as unattractive based on product packaging .
rather , some participants shared their view that they never judged a cigarette pack unattractive .
in short , consumers cognitively judged cigarette packaging as overwhelmingly aesthetically attractive and appealing : ' i have never really seen anything that visually looked repulsive to me . '
( group 2 , lower education ) .
semantic semantic interpretation denotes the perception of the product 's utility or function .
for cigarette packaging this can relate to perceived quality , tar levels , taste , etc .
many of the participants discussed the products' characteristics and how these are perceived through the packaging style .
participants' discussion supported the idea that packs serve a semantic function , signaling to consumers that some packs were healthier , natural , and basic or cheap in quality : ' it just makes me think of free - spirited and it 's considered like the healthier of all the cigarettes because of the less ingredients and what not and the packaging reflects all that . '
( group 2 , lower education ) , ' i know for me like the basic packs , despite the name being basic , it 's very plain and it just makes me think of inferior quality .
the same with other , like , cheaper brands , like just the way the packaging is very simple and so it does make me think that it 's a less quality of a product . '
( group 5 , lower education ) .
symbolic symbolic association refers to the consumer 's perception of what product design communicates about the consumer 's personal and / or social identity .
participants discussed particular identities and stereotypes of various smokers .
moreover , they clearly connected these identities and stereotypes with the consumption of cigarettes from packs with particular designs .
this aspect of the context of consumption framework seems particularly salient for assessing packaging and its impact upon consumers' connection of particular designs to specific races , genders , subcultures , and psychographic profiles : ' well , to be honest with you i think what would characterize the marlboro reds are straight , white men . '
( group 1 , lgb ) , ' well take the capris for example .
they 're marketed generally for women , and there 's a nice really thin , slim , long , you know . '
( group 4 , lgb / mix ) .
affective response within the context of consumption framework , another aspect of consumer response is affective response , which captures consumers' emotions , feelings , and moods associated with visual design .
more specifically , the affective response domain includes five sub - themes : instrumental , aesthetic , social , surprise , and interest .
instrumental instrumental emotions are tied to consumers' perception of whether the visual product design signals that a product will assist or hinder their consumption objectives .
typically , these emotions are expressed as satisfaction or , among our participants , as relief : ' the only thing i think of whenever i see the actual pack is that i 'm going to smoke one and relief is coming . '
( group 3 , lgb ) .
discussions about instrumental characteristics occurred mostly when participants were asked about the experience of having a pack change its design , and in these instances participants shared their concern that the changes would be disappointing : ' but speaking for myself and the peers that i frequently smoke around and they smoke as well , [ the change in newport packaging after acquisition by reynolds american ] was basically more of a discomfort and it made us kind of feel like something was wrong with the cigarettes . '
( group 3 , lgb ) .
aesthetic aesthetic emotions include disgust or attraction , and are connected with the ability for visual product design to delight or offend a consumer 's senses .
in turn , aesthetic emotions elicit positive or negative feelings and moods about a visual design , and ultimately the product .
our participants had very strong feelings when looking at certain cigarette packs .
these feelings included disgust , fearfulness , happy , and / or attraction , all of which related to package colors and design .
' gpc 's blue pack just almost makes my stomach turn . '
( group 2 , lower education ) , ' the american spirit , the yellow pack , always seemed of sun - it made me think of sunny days , beaches , outside activities . '
( group 3 , lgb ) .
social social emotions include indignation or admiration , and are tied to consumers' beliefs that the design complies with social norms .
the participants spoke of certain brands' iconic packaging style and that a brand 's history and longevity , as demonstrated through packaging , can evoke esteem or regard among consumers : ' i think as far as like a menthol cigarette , i think the way that they use their green coloring , the green and then the white but mostly green was like a power statement as far as a menthol cigarette was concerned . '
( group 2 , lower education ) , ' i do n't think the newport packaging has changed all that much since they 've been around .
it 's pretty much still the same .
you kind of ca n't miss them .
they 're like marlboro ; you kind of ca n't miss the easy identification of it . '
( group 1 , lgb ) .
surprise emotions of surprise include amazement and novelty about the design of cigarette packs .
the surprise emotion , as expressed by our participants , seems to stand in contrast to the social admiration of long standing iconic brands .
social admiration was based on not changing the design , while surprise is based in atypical design .
the surprise sub - theme captures participants' discussions of cigarette packaging that was found to be appealing due to its unique designs .
participants seem to notice packaging that did not feature standard design elements .
for instance , designs were often considered unique when they featured bright colors , contrasting colors , and patterns : ' it does n't look like a typical pack of cigarettes , as far as the package .
i mean , it 's packaged in a typical cigarette box , but the decoration of the box is not typical of a regular cigarette . '
( group 1 , lgb ) , ' yes , one of my supervisors at work smoke them .
it 's like a yellow pack with an indian with all the little colorful stuff in it. that 's what draw my attention to it. i 'm like , what are you smoking ? ?
( group 4 , lgb / mix ) .
interest the emotions within this area capture participants' boredom or fascination with pack design and the connection of these emotions to their hopes of product changes .
the following quote demonstrates the feeling of fascination and a hint of challenge : ' the camel with the whole picture that goes along with it. there 's actually a little thing sometimes you can find and it became like a thing where you could actually have games and find things on the back of the camel packs and there were things like that and just the way it looked .
it was the only one of its kind . '
( group 2 , low education ) .
in contrast , the following quote demonstrates boredom in pack design and that packages are only noticed when they change : ' i guess i 'm oblivious to what 's on them after a while .
you just notice if they change . '
( group 4 , lgb / mix ) .
behavior after the cognitive and affective responses , the context of consumption framework posits that consumers select one of two paths : approach or avoid the product .
when a consumer enters the approach path they will often engage in one or more of the following behaviors : information search , purchase , and / or consumption of the product .
if a consumer selects the avoidance path they will likely ignore the product or fail to purchase it. the participants shared experiences supporting the connection between cigarette packaging , both the approach and avoidance paths : ' i actually started smoking them for a little while because i thought the little pack was cute . '
( group 4 , lgb / mix ) , ' i think that is what the packaging is trying to convey to the consumer , is that hey it 's okay , this is a safer cigarette for you to smoke , and that 's why i picked them up to begin with . '
( group 6 , general population ) .
negative case analysis while the participants' discussion of cigarette pack design confirmed the domains of the context of consumption framework , our participants also clearly expressed that design is not the only driver of behavior .
there were substantial discussions on the importance of price and couponing , and our participants , who were smokers and tended to be middle age , were keenly interested in the delivery of nicotine when going into withdrawal .
for instance , one participant went as far as to say , ' as long as it 's not [ wrapped in ] doo - doo. okay ?
it does n't matter ' ( group 1 , lgb ) .
yet , others indicated that design mattered in their original decision to try a particular cigarette and that the role of design may be different across the life course : ' i think some things are geared as influencing younger people .
i do n't think people over 40 get influenced by packaging for cigarettes . '
( group 1 , lgb ) .
discussion principal findings in the six focus groups of smokers from across the u.s. , we found that the context of consumption framework aligned with how smokers discussed responses to the visual design of cigarette packs .
participant discussions yielded data that supported the cognitive response theme of visual design as well as its aesthetic , semantic , and symbolic sub - themes .
cigarette package designs captured the participants' attention , suggested the characteristics of the product , and reflected ( or could be leveraged to convey ) multiple dimensions of consumer identity .
particular to the affective responses to design , our participants expressed that cigarette packaging conveyed how the pack could be used to particular ends ( instrumental ) , created an emotional response to the designs ( aesthetic ) , complied with normative expectations of a cigarette ( social ) , elicited interest when designs change ( surprise ) , and prompted fascination when unique design characteristics are used ( interest ) .
participants also tied changes to the visual design of packs to behavior .
study findings in context our findings fit within the broader qualitative literature about cigarette pack design and marketing .
previous ethnographic research has documented the salience of touch in smokers' relationship with cigarette packs33 .
other qualitative studies further affirm the role of cigarette branding , including package design36 , in youth 's social identities ( i.e. the cognitive symbolic domain ) 37,38 , and the appeal of packaging25,39,40 .
reseach into tobacco - industry documents shows careful psychographic targeting by the industry41 .
there is clear evidence that pack designs reference broader marketing imagery42 .
in addition , the size of design elements , such as the marlboro chevron , have been used to communicate health claims ( e.g. tar levels ) 43 .
interest in alternative tobacco product marketing is tied to affective responses of hope27 .
this study is compatible with the broad scientific consensus within consumer behavior that the visual design of product packaging matters to consumers and ultimately influences their perceptions and behaviors17,44,45 - 47 .
for instance , in the cognition sub - theme of symbolic response we found that consumers often associated specific pack designs with a particular type of consumer , often a stereotype associated with a lifestyle choice and / or demographic factors .
this can be explained by the self / product congruency literature , which supports the notion that consumers often purchase products that reflect or align with their ideal personal or social self48 .
this research suggests researchers and fda regulators should consider multiple types of consumer responses ( i.e. cognitive , affective , and behavioral ) to the visual design of cigarette packages .
our findings have important implications for measurement of outcomes in experimental and observational research on cigarette packaging .
specifically , the context of consumption framework suggests that researchers and regulators should assess the three cognitive and five affective responses posited by the context of consumption framework .
limitations this study has a number of limitations .
first , while the use of a telephone for the focus group allowed broad geographic representation and did not require internet access , it limited face - to - face participant - to - participant interaction , and as such the ability to read facial expressions .
additionally , the phone mode limited our ability to eliminate other distractions for participants , and likely made it easier to drop out of the group .
second , although we recruited from the probability - based amerispeak panel , our findings reflect qualitative themes that emerged in our unique , purposively sampled set of participants , and as such the findings may not be generalizable to all smokers .
not all identities were represented in our study ; for example , we had a limited number of american indian and hispanic / latino participants and no participant identified as asian .
our participants skewed to an older age demographic , which may have influenced our results .
third , this study solely examined cigarette packaging and did not assess applicability to other tobacco products .
fourth , due to the use of a panel service , we were not able to check our findings with the participants .
fifth , the context of consumption framework contains other sources of influence and potential moderators ; future research should examine these for use in tobacco regulatory research .
conclusions future research should experimentally link the domains of the context of consumption framework to consumer responses and , ultimately , to changes in population health .
we recommend additional work on developing standardized measures of these responses .
our research identifies themes that show compatibility with the context of consumption framework , but does not indicate whether some responses are more influential than others in changing purchase or use behaviors .
future research should extend this to youth and on the role of package design in initiating cigarette smoking .
when asking tobacco manufacturers to demonstrate a new product 's substantial equivalence , the fda may request additional data comparing consumer perceptions of the new tobacco product and the predicate that could affect initiation , cessation , frequency of use , patterns of use , smoking behavior , and perceptions of harm or addictiveness49 .
given the potential for visual design changes in cigarette packages to influence population health ( e.g. camel no .
95,7,50 ) , building the scientific evidence for pre - market review of cigarette products remains an important area of tobacco research .
tobacco control researchers and federal regulators should leverage the theory - informed context of consumption framework to assess the impact of product packaging on a full range of consumer responses .

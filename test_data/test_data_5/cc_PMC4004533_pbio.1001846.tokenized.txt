toxoplasma effector maf1 mediates recruitment of host mitochondria and impacts the host response mitochondria , the powerhouses of eukaryotic cells , regulate many pathways related to cell growth and division .
they also participate in apoptotic cell death and survival pathways such as autophagy and in innate immune responses .
as such , mitochondria are a tempting target for intracellular pathogens , which may seek to block or manipulate mitochondrial activity to meet their own needs .

sometimes it is obvious when a pathogen is affecting mitochondria .
for example , the protozoan toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that resides within intracellular vacuoles inside host cells .
some strains of t. gondii can corral and sequester their host 's mitochondria together at the vacuole - - a process termed host mitochondrial association ( hma ) .
how the parasite achieves hma , and what benefits it gains from doing so , are unknown .
but now , as they report in their paper published this month in plos biology , lena pernas , john boothroyd , and colleagues have brought us closer to understanding the mechanism used by t. gondii to sequester host cell mitochondria .
pernas and colleagues began by examining three t. gondii strains known to cause disease in humans , which are classified by type ( type i , ii , and iii ) according to their genetic lineage .
the three strains are different genetically and in many other respects ; for example , each strain provokes a qualitatively different response from infected individuals' immune systems .
this characteristic led the authors to wonder whether the different strains might also behave differently with respect to hma .
to test this , pernas and colleagues exposed human foreskin fibroblasts to the separate strains and then looked for evidence of mitochondrial sequestration .
importantly , both the type i and type iii strains caused hma , but the type ii strain , me49 , did not .
the absence of hma appears to be a feature typical of type ii t. gondii parasites , because another type ii strain also failed to induce hma .
to determine the mechanistic basis for hma , pernas and coworkers evaluated the progeny of a cross between type ii and type iii parasites for their ability to induce hma .
then , the strains' hma status was compared with their possession of different chromosomal markers , to determine which chromosomal region hosted the gene necessary for hma .
the region identified contained 153 candidate genes , and the authors then narrowed the field further by searching this portion of the parasite 's genome for genes with features likely to be important for hma .
for example , pernas and colleagues suspected the gene they sought would probably encode a membrane - spanning protein whose expression levels differed between hma - positive and hma - negative strains .
using this approach , the researchers ultimately identified one gene , designated as tgg1 _ 053770 in the t. gondii genome database , as a likely candidate to mediate hma .
pernas and coworkers next examined the protein 's location in t. gondii - infected host cells using immunofluorescence .
the protein was observed lining the limiting membrane of the vacuole that houses type i and type iii parasites , but not that of type ii parasites .
western blotting showed that both type i and type iii parasites expressed large amounts of tgg1 _ 053770 's protein product , but type ii parasites did not .
these data raised the possibility that tgg1 _ 053770 may encode a protein important for hma , so the authors tentatively dubbed it mitochondrial association factor 1 ( maf1 ) .
to determine if maf1 really does mediate hma , pernas and coworkers genetically engineered type ii parasites to express the version of maf1 found in the type i strain .
indeed , the modified type ii parasites now recruited host mitochondria , whereas type i parasites whose maf1 gene was deleted could not .
interestingly , maf1 - deficient type i parasites grew at about the same rate as their wild - type counterparts and , similarly growth of type ii parasites was unaffected by the presence or absence of maf1 .
although type ii parasites do n't require maf1 to grow , their expression of maf1 causes dramatic changes to host cell biology .
first , pernas and colleagues observed that host mitochondria infected by wild - type type ii parasites are not sequestered and appear normal in size .
in contrast , those sequestered by maf1 - expressing type ii parasites expanded to a huge size .
maf1 also altered host cells' response to parasite infection ; murine monocytes growing in cell culture secreted a different constellation of immunomodulatory proteins when infected with maf1 - expressing type ii versus wild - type type ii parasites .
finally , in mice infected with parasites , the presence or absence of maf1 affected both the host animals' immune responses and the patterns of genes they expressed in response to infection .
together , these results suggest that maf1 is involved in t. gondii hma , and that maf1 affects the course of t. gondii infections .
at this time , the mechanisms by which maf1 drives hma remain unclear , and the impact maf1 has on mitochondrial biology is also unknown .
the identification of maf1 as the mediator of t. gondii hma will help scientists answer these questions and many more .

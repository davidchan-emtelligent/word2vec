valosin - containing protein ( vcp ) is a highly conserved mechanoenzyme that helps maintain protein homeostasis in all cells and serves specialized functions in distinct cell types .
in skeletal muscle , it is critical for myofibrillogenesis and atrophy .
however , little is known about vcp 's role ( s ) in the heart .
its functional diversity is determined by differential binding of distinct cofactors / adapters , which is likely disrupted during disease .
vcp mutations cause multisystem proteinopathy ( msp ) , a pleiotropic degenerative disorder that involves inclusion body myopathy .
msp patients display progressive muscle weakness .
they also exhibit cardiomyopathy and die from cardiac and respiratory failure , which are consistent with critical myocardial roles for the enzyme .
nonetheless , efficient models to interrogate vcp in cardiac muscle remain underdeveloped and poorly studied .
here , we investigated the significance of vcp and mutant vcp in the drosophila heart .
cardiac - restricted rnai - mediated knockdown of ter94 , the drosophila vcp homolog , severely perturbed myofibrillar organization and heart function in adult flies .
furthermore , expression of msp disease - causing alleles engendered cardiomyopathy in adults and structural defects in embryonic hearts .
drosophila may therefore serve as a valuable model for examining role ( s ) of vcp in cardiogenesis and for identifying novel heart - specific vcp interactions , which when disrupted via mutation , contribute to or elicit cardiac pathology .
ter94 cdc48 p97 myopathy multisystem proteinopathy ibmpfd 1 .
introduction valosin - containing protein ( vcp ) is a type ii aaa ( atpases associated with a variety of activities ) enzymatic machine that converts energy from atp hydrolysis into mechanical work [ 1,2 ] .
vcp monomers assemble into a functioning macromolecular homo - hexameric complex in which six subunits form a ring around a central pore .
it is highly conserved among eukaryotes , is ubiquitously expressed , and is extremely abundant .
in animals , vcp accounts for more than 1 % of total cellular protein .
vcp is the most intensely investigated member of the aaa protein family , which can be attributed to its diverse biological roles .
this diversity results from the enzyme 's promiscuity in substrate and cofactor binding [ 3,4 ] .
it helps maintain proteostasis in all cells , in part , by governing critical steps during ubiquitin - proteasome system - mediated protein degradation and er - associated degradation [ 5 ] .
other biological processes that involve vcp include membrane fusion , transcriptional activation , apoptosis , protein folding , and protein aggregation clearance [ 1,3,4,6 ] .
vcp also performs specialized functions in distinct tissues .
in skeletal muscle , for example , it is essential for myofibrillogenesis [ 3 ] .
critical roles during muscle atrophy and in the accelerated degradation of muscle proteins have also been recently identified [ 7 ] .
the precise mechanisms underlying these roles , however , remain unknown .
similarly , a comprehensive understanding of how vcp mutations that cause human disease might alter tissue - specific functions and drive pathology is also lacking [ 8 ] , which thereby necessitates the development and examination of an array of animal models .
autosomal dominant mutations in vcp cause a debilitating form of inclusion body myopathy formerly known as inclusion body myopathy associated with paget 's disease of the bone and fronto - temporal dementia ( ibmpfd ) [ 9 ] , which more recently has been designated " multisystem proteinopathy " ( msp ) [ 10 ] .
msp is an inherited degenerative disorder characterized by highly heterogeneous and variably penetrant phenotypes [ 3,9 - 15 ] .
to date , more than 30 vcp missense mutations have been shown to cause msp [ 16,17 ] .
clinical features include muscle weakness in mid - life , which advances to disabling weakness .
affected skeletal muscle contains " rimmed vacuoles " as well as myonuclear and sarcoplasmic inclusion bodies [ 18,19 ] .
weakness progresses to involve respiratory and heart muscles [ 17 ] .
patients frequently develop cardiomyopathy and typically die from respiratory or cardiac failure in their 40s to 60s [ 13 - 15,17 ] .
the presence of cardiomyopathy is indicative of vital cardiovascular roles for the enzyme .
despite a vast expenditure of investigative effort to decipher numerous and unique functions of vcp in various tissues and in multiple cellular contexts , our comprehension regarding the roles of this enzymatic machine in heart muscle remains limited [ 20 ] .
drosophila melanogaster , the fruit fly , has proven to be an effective model for investigating vcp functions and msp disease alleles [ 21 - 25 ] .
drosophila contains a single vcp homolog , ter94 [ 26 ] , which shares 83 % protein sequence identity with human vcp [ 21 ] .
expression of msp ter94 alleles in flies disrupts skeletal muscle integrity and performance , leads to the formation of inclusion body - like structures reminiscent of the rimmed vacuoles found in patients' muscles , and causes progressive neurodegenerative defects [ 21 ] .
moreover , these models have helped uncover the nature of particular msp - causing vcp mutations and a novel link between cellular atp level and msp pathogenesis [ 21 ] .
the fly is also well - suited for investigating cardiac - restricted roles of vcp .
an array of genetic tools permits unprecedented temporal and spatial manipulation of the enzyme and its interacting partners .
for example , the gal4 - uas system permits targeted transgene expression [ 27 ] .
here , a transgene is located downstream of an " upstream activating sequence " ( uas ) .
it is inactive in the absence of the gal4 transactivating protein .
however , when flies carrying a uas - transgene are mated with flies harboring a gal4 transcriptional activator , the progeny inherit both genes and express the transgene in the same pattern as gal4 .
additionally , drosophila has a short lifespan yet shares common mechanisms that determine aging rates and longevity [ 28,29 ] .
this is especially advantageous for investigating phenotypes associated with progressive disorders , such as msp , which typically require months to years to develop in higher organisms as opposed to weeks in drosophila .
the fly 's heart is composed of ~ 100 cardiomyocytes that form a simple tubular structure , and they share significant proteomic and ultrastructural homology with myocytes from vertebrate hearts [ 30 ] .
furthermore , since the fly does not rely on its heart for oxygenation , cardiac function can be severely compromised without necessarily inducing death .
thus , flies are highly tolerant of cardiac - specific genetic manipulation and serve as a valuable platform for in vivo analysis of myocardial defects that are lethal in other organisms .
to begin investigating cardiac - restricted roles of vcp we tested the hypotheses that ter94 is required for fly heart tube formation , maintenance , structure , and function and that mutations in conserved ter94 residues , when expressed only in the heart , initiate cardiac pathology and remodeling .
rnai - mediated ter94 knockdown in adult hearts severely perturbed myofibrillar and cardiomyocyte organization and function .
conditional rnai expression , post - development , induced extensive cardiac defects shortly after activation .
furthermore , expression of msp disease - causing alleles triggered cardiomyopathy in adult flies and structural defects in embryonic hearts .
these data support major roles for the enzyme during cardiogenesis and , in mature cells , in cardiomyocyte maintenance , which are likely disrupted by disease - causing mutations .
thus , drosophila may serve as an efficient model for investigating vcp in myocardium , its tissue - specific interacting partners , and potential modifiers of the pathological response to disease - causing mutations .
2. results 2.1 .
cardiac - specific knockdown of ter94 severely affects adult drosophila heart structure and function consistent with key myocardial roles for vcp , we previously identified high protein abundance in drosophila melanogaster cardiac tubes [ 30 ] , and our global in vivo rnai screen distinguished ter94 as a possible regulator of heart performance [ 31 ] .
to verify that ter94 is required for normal structure and function of the adult heart and its constituent cardiomyocytes , each of two drosophila lines with uas - controlled ter94 rnai transgenes ( i.e. , l1 and l2 ) was crossed with the cardiac - specific driver lines hand4.2 - gal4 or tinc - gal4 .
the progeny expressed rnai exclusively in myocardium. by one week of age hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) adult heart tubes displayed aberrant cellular morphology ( figure 1 ) .
specifically , in these flies , rnai - mediated suppression of ter94 expression disrupted the highly ordered packing of myofilaments into discrete striated contractile units , indicative of compromised sarcomerogenesis , and it rendered the hearts nonfunctional .
hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) accordingly exhibited a drastically shortened lifespan compared to control flies ( figure 2a ) .
a relatively large reduction of ter94 mrna in adult cardiomyocytes was confirmed via fluorescence in situ hybridization ( figure 3a,b ) .
tinc - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) drosophila were pupal lethal .
to confirm these findings , a second uas - ter94rnai fly line ( l2 ) was also crossed with the hand4.2 - gal4 and tinc - gal4 driver lines .
the resulting progeny from both crosses exhibited markedly reduced lifespans relative to controls ( figure 2a,b ) .
however , despite a similar reduction in ter94 mrna ( supplementary figure s1 ) , hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l2 ) flies showed improved survival relative to hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) flies ( figure 2a ) and thus permitted extensive assessment of cardiac physiology at one and three weeks of age ( figure 4a ) .
hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l2 ) hearts exhibited a dilated phenotype at both time points compared to controls , specifically displaying significantly increased diastolic ( 1 week : 84 +/ - 1 mum vs. 71 +/ - 4 mum ; 3 week : 81 +/ - 2 mum vs. 70 +/ - 1 mum ) and systolic diameters ( 1 week : 54 +/ - 1 mum vs. 41 +/ - 1 mum ; 3 week : 54 +/ - 2 mum vs. 44 +/ - 1 mum ) and reduced fractional shortening ( 1 week : 0.35 +/ - 0.01 vs. 0.42 +/ - 0.01 ; 3 week : 0.33 +/ - 0.01 vs. 0.37 +/ - 0.01 ) .
while tinc - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l2 ) flies survived to adulthood , their cardiac morphology and function were exceedingly poor and resembled that of hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) hearts ( data not shown ) .
these data corroborate and extend our previous findings from a genome - wide rnai screen that initially recognized cardiac function depends on normal expression of ter94 , which when suppressed in the heart caused premature death [ 31 ] .
2.2 .
modest cardiac - specific knockdown of ter94 has no effect on lifespan or cardiac function to determine if minor reductions of ter94 would produce a negative yet potentially mild effect on overall cardiac performance and survival , flies expressing the relatively weak gmh5 - gal4 cardiac - specific driver were crossed with uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) drosophila .
gmh5 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) cardiomyocytes were characterized by a slight but significant reduction of ter94 mrna ( figure 3c ) .
no difference was detected between lifespans of gmh5 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) flies and controls ( figure 2c ) .
furthermore , no discernable differences in cardiac performance indices between gmh5 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) and controls were identified in one - , three - , and five - week - old flies ( figure 4b ) .
thus , mild expression of uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) in the drosophila heart using the gmh5 - gal4 driver may not silence a sufficient amount of mrna to have significantly negative effects on myocardial structure or function .
2.3 .
heart - specific knockdown of ter94 post - development affects cardiac structure and function to determine if the negative effects observed in adult hand4.2 - gal4 > or tinc - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai drosophila result exclusively from impaired heart development and to discern if the enzyme is required for mature cardiomyocyte maintenance , flies with an ru486 - inducible cardiac - restricted driver , hand4.2 - geneswitch - gal4 ( hand4.2 - gs - gal4 ) , were crossed with uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) .
at two days post - eclosion , adult progeny were placed on food supplemented with 100 mug / ml ru486 ( dissolved in 100 % ethanol ) to activate the rnai transgene or vehicle ( 100 % ethanol ) .
lifespan was abruptly shortened in flies aged on the drug compared to sibling controls aged on vehicle ( figure 5a ) .
after one week , however , no morphological differences or reductions in cardiac performance in flies on drug relative to those on vehicle were observed .
after three weeks of aging on drug , flies showed extensive cardiac remodeling similar to that observed in hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) hearts at one week ( figures 5b and 1 ) .
most cardiomyocytes of the conical chamber showed either a complete loss of sarcomeric material or disorganized , poorly - striated myofibrils .
cardiac performance declined accordingly compared to those on vehicle , as manifested by significantly reduced fractional shortening ( 0.15 +/ - 0.01 vs. 0.36 +/ - 0.01 ) governed by significantly larger systolic diameters ( 54 +/ - 1 mum vs. 41 +/ - 1 mum ) ( figure 5c ) .
importantly , wildtype adult flies similarly treated with 100 mug / ml of ru486 for three weeks exhibited no difference in cardiac diameters or fractional shortening relative to flies exposed to vehicle ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
these data are consistent with those obtained by tricoire et al .
( 2013 ) [ 32 ] .
thus , excessive reduction of cardiac ter94 via rnai knockdown , both continuously and conditionally , resulted in structural defects , poor heart function , and decreased lifespan .
in sum , the above findings support a vital requirement for relatively high vcp expression for both cardiogenesis and cardiomyocyte maintenance throughout life .
naturally occurring mutations in vcp , which impair the enzyme 's functions , may likewise deleteriously impact heart performance and trigger cardiac pathology .
2.4 .
expression of ter94 msp alleles engenders a restrictive cardiac phenotype in adult flies although a prevalent phenotype associated with msp is skeletal muscle myopathy , patients exhibit an increased potential for cardiomyopathy and heart failure [ 13 - 15,17 ] .
three ter94 transgenic drosophila lines were generated to model discrete human vcp mutations associated with msp [ 21 ] .
they recapitulate many hallmarks of the human disease .
to determine if these specific ter94 mutations affect myofibrillar structure in cardiomyocytes and / or lead to cardiomyopathy , drosophila containing a uas - controlled wildtype ter94 ( uas - ter94wt ) transgene , or a transgene with the msp - causing mutations ter94 r152h ( uas - ter94r152h ) , r188q ( uas - ter94r188q ) , or a229e ( uas - ter94a229e ) were crossed with flies harboring the hand4.2 - gal4 driver .
unlike what was observed following rnai expression , expression of wildtype ter94 or msp ter94 alleles seemingly had no effect on sarcomeric development or organization in the progeny ( figure 6a ) .
all three mutant transgenic lines exhibited myofibrillar striations that were indistinguishable from those of control .
at one week , however , hearts expressing the uas - ter94r152h , uas - ter94r188q , or uas - ter94a229e mutant alleles displayed significantly restricted diastolic diameters compared to control hearts ( 1 week : 61 +/ - 1 mum , 62 +/ - 1 mum , and 59 +/ - 1 mum , respectively , vs. 67 +/ - 1 mum ) ( figure 6b ). by five weeks , the restriction did not worsen drastically in the hearts of all three mutants compared to one week but remained significantly restricted vs. age - matched control hearts ( 5 week : 60 +/ - 1 mum , 59 +/ - 1 mum , and 59 +/ - 1 mum , respectively , vs. 64 +/ - 1 mum ) ( figure 6b ) .
because of mutant diastolic restriction , fractional shortening was also significantly reduced relative to controls ( 1 week : 0.33 +/ - 0.01 , 0.34 +/ - 0.01 , and 0.34 +/ - 0.01 , respectively , vs. 0.39 +/ - 0.01 ; 5 week : 0.33 +/ - 0.01 , 0.33 +/ - 0.01 , and 0.33 +/ - 0.01 , respectively , vs. 0.36 +/ - 0.01 ) ( figure 6b ) .
these results demonstrate that heart - specific expression of mutant isoforms of ter94 , which are analogous to msp - causing variants in humans , induces cardiac remodeling and myopathic responses .
2.5 .
expression of ter94 msp alleles in muscle progenitor cells causes cardiac defects in the embryonic heart to determine if msp - inducing alleles have an effect on early drosophila cardiac development , uas - controlled wildtype and mutant ter94 transgenes were expressed via the myoblast - specific driver , 24b - gal4 , which inherently co - expressed cd8 - gfp .
stage 16 live embryos expressing uas - ter94wt , uas - ter94r152h , uas - ter94r188q , or uas - ter94a229e were collected and stained with anti - dmef2 antibody to help visualize potential structural defects in the dorsal heart and the somatic musculature .
24b - gal4 > uas - cd8 - gfp > uas - ter94wt drosophila exhibited an ordered , two - row contralateral arrangement of cardioblasts and a regular segmental arrangement of somatic cells ( figure 7a ) .
in contrast , embryos expressing msp - causing mutant ter94 showed disorganized pairing of myocardial cells with an aberrant twisting of the heart ( figure 7b - d ) .
in addition , disrupted organization of the intersegmental somatic muscle cell pattern was evident .
these results show that 24b - gal4 - mediated expression of msp mutant isoforms of ter94 induces cardiac remodeling and myopathic responses in the early developing embryonic drosophila heart and somatic skeletal musculature .
3. discussion vcp is an abundant , multi - functional , and highly conserved enzyme .
very few studies have focused on the roles of this enzymatic machine in heart muscle .
it thus remains crucial to understand how vcp influences normal myocardial physiology .
moreover , comprehending how disease - associated mutations in the protein disrupt cardiac morphology and performance , which contribute to heart failure and early death , is also imperative .
vcp - associated msp is an inherited , heterogeneous , and progressive syndrome characterized by myopathy , dementia , motor neuron disease , and / or paget disease of bone [ 3,9 - 15 ] .
predominantly , afflicted patients present gradual skeletal muscle weakness and die from heart and respiratory failure .
the potential for cardiomyopathy and heart failure underscores critical roles for vcp in cardiac muscle , which are likely perturbed during disease [ 13 - 15 ] .
as with other myopathies , in order to help take additional steps toward management and treatment of msp , it is necessary to establish novel model systems suitable for high throughput and comprehensive investigation of the protein in the heart and in the pathogenesis of vcp - related cardiac anomalies .
here , we investigated requisite functions of vcp / ter94 in the drosophila heart tube .
our results represent the first demonstration of the cardiac autonomous responses to vcp knockdown and msp - associated mutations , in vivo .
they suggest the fly heart may serve as a unique system to investigate msp - associated heart failure precipitated by vcp mutations .
suppression of ter94 expression using two independent uas - rnai lines in conjunction with the relatively strong cardiac - specific gal4 driver lines , hand4.2 - gal4 or tinc - gal4 , severely disturbed adult heart structure and function .
in certain instances , e.g. , pupal lethality , our data indicate ter94 knockdown substantially impairs cardiac development .
we additionally observed reduced lifespans , which is also consistent with severely compromised heart performance .
in situ live - video imaging and assessment of myocardial physiology verified impaired function .
these alterations can be attributed to , at least in part , poorly organized contractile elements .
the loss of discrete actin - based striations along myofibrils throughout the cardiomyocytes suggests impaired sarcomerogenesis , and possibly maintenance of the highly ordered cytoskeletal structures .
relatively low constitutive expression of ter94 rnai , however , had no obvious effects on myocardial physiology , myofibrillar order , or lifespan .
these findings imply that high cardiac ter94 expression levels normally afford an important functional reserve such that mild loss of the enzyme can be tolerated without overt biological consequences .
conditional ter94 knockdown , post - cardiac tube development , initially had minimal effects on the drosophila heart .
major defects in cardiac function and myofibrillar organization , however , were identified within weeks of rnai activation .
use of the ru486 - inducible driver ruled out the possibility that the hearts of hand4.2 - gal4 > or tinc - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai flies performed poorly exclusively as a result of disrupted cardiogenesis .
vcp is therefore likely required for development of cardiomyocytes and for the maintenance of mature cells and their contractile structures .
preserving structural and functional cellular and subcellular integrity over time is critical to ensure proper performance of post - mitotic tissues characterized by limited regenerative capacity .
in skeletal muscle , vcp is essential for myofibrillar development , protein quality control , atrophy , and accelerated degradation [ 3,7,33 - 37 ] .
the enzyme appears to perform analogous roles within cardiomyocytes .
interestingly , expression of three msp - associated disease alleles also disrupted the drosophila heart and influenced its performance , consistent with cardiomyopathy observed in humans with analogous vcp mutations .
the restrictive cardiac phenotypes were similar to those recently observed in drosophila with myosin heavy chain and troponin t mutations [ 38,39 ] and did not mirror the effects of excessive rnai - mediated ter94 knockdown .
the results illustrate that while the disease - associated amino acid substitutions influence the enzyme 's ability to operate normally , as manifested by restricted and poorly functioning cardiac tubes , the mutations did not induce a complete loss of enzymatic function .
vcp participates in diverse biological processes through highly promiscuous interactions with cell - specific cofactors and distinct substrates .
over 50 proteins have been shown to associate either directly or indirectly with vcp [ 3 ] , although the actual number is likely substantially higher .
in skeletal muscle fibers for example , vcp processes have been shown to involve interactions with a host of cofactors that include p47 , ufd1 / npl4 , ufd2 / e4b , and ubxd1 and client proteins such as the myosin chaperone unc45 , caveolin , myosin regulatory light chain , and actin [ 3,7 ] .
a recent co - immunoprecipitation study revealed associations of vcp with hsp22 , akt , cryab , and a limited set of other partners in cardiomyocytes [ 20 ] .
multiple lines of evidence suggest alterations in cofactor and substrate interactions , and not a global loss of vcp function , explain msp molecular pathogenesis [ 3,4,34,40 ] .
thus , such perturbations between vcp and cardiomyocyte - specific binding partners are likely triggers for cardiac dysfunction and heart failure in patients .
fly models overexpressing vcp / ter94 mutant transgenes via the gal4 - uas system recapitulate a spectrum of disease phenotypes , including , as evidenced here , cardiac pathology .
thus , as in humans , mutant monomers are seemingly incorporated into and disrupt myocardial roles of the hexameric vcp complex .
impending studies would nevertheless benefit from generating mutant flies via targeted knock - in technology ( e.g. , crispr / cas9 ) .
this would ensure proper timing of gene expression and , potentially , appropriate mutant protein quantities to establish the range of normal and mutant subunit mixtures comprising vcp hexamers to more faithfully recapitulate the diseased state .
since there is remarkable conservation across species of basic vcp functions in non - cardiac tissues [ 21,26 ] , it is expected that cardiac - specific roles identified in flies are also shared with mice and humans .
therefore , ongoing and future studies , ideally suited for flies , are likely to provide novel insight into vcp 's roles in the heart during health and disease .
for example , drosophila is an invaluable tool for rapidly screening for and investigating genetic interactions between proteins of interest .
such experiments , which can be time and cost prohibitive in vertebrates , permit identification and confirmation or rejection of functional interactions between two gene products hypothesized to be in association .
they have the potential to help resolve the vcp interactome that dictates the molecule 's functional roles in the heart and to identify possible modifiers of cardiac disease pathogenesis .
therefore , drosophila is an ostensibly powerful model for investigating vcp in cardiomyocytes , resolving its heart - specific interacting partners , and identifying potential modifiers of the response to disease - causing mutations in the enzyme .
4. materials and methods 4.1 .

flies were transferred onto new food every day to ensure constant exposure to the drug .

fly number was counted and food changed every third day .
for each genotype , three independent cohorts from three separate crosses with 100 flies per set were studied .
4.5 .
drosophila cardiac analysis approximately 20 - 40 cardiac tubes of one - , three - , and five - week - old female drosophila were surgically exposed under ah at 25 degreesc [ 42 ] .
then , 30 second movies were taken at ~ 120 frames per second using a hamamatsu orca flash 2.8 cmos camera ( naka - ku , hamamatsu city , shizuoka , japan ) on a leica dm5000b tl miscroscope ( leica microsystems , buffalo grove , il , usa ) with a 10x immersion lens ( 0.30 na ) .
several indices of cardiac performance were measured from the high - speed videos using semi - automated optical heartbeat analysis ( soha ) ( www.sohasofware.com ) , a free , custom - written motion analysis program [ 43,44 ] .
measurements of cardiac diameters at peak diastole and systole were made at two locations along the third abdominal segment of each heart tube , directly from individual movie frames , and averaged together .
significance was assessed using student 's t - tests and one - way anovas with bonferroni multiple comparison tests .
4.6 .
drosophila embryo immunohistochemistry drosophila embryos were collected from grape - juice agar plates and aged to the specified stage .
embryos were dechorionated and fixed according to a previously described protocol [ 45 ] .
the anti - dmef2 antibody ( used in 1:750 dilution ) was a generous gift from b. paterson .
5. conclusions vcp / ter94 is vital for embryonic and adult drosophila heart development and myocardial physiology .
as found in other tissues it is abundantly expressed , which likely ensures adequate functional reserve for the enzyme .
thus , mild reductions in vcp / ter94 activity can be tolerated .
excessive loss , however , substantially disrupts myofibrillogenesis and mature cardiomyocyte maintenance .
additionally , expression of msp disease alleles in the fly heart precipitates cardiomyopathy as observed in patients .
the fly permits relatively rapid genome - wide screens via established tools and readily available fly strains to probe cardiac - specific vcp / ter94 interacting partners .
thus , future studies , including such screens , may identify genetic modifiers of vcp - induced cardiomyopathy and therapeutic targets to alleviate the pathophysiological remodeling of the heart that is associated with msp .

( left ) confocal micrograph of an adult drosophila melanogaster cardiac tube with fluorescently - labeled f - actin .
scale bar = 100 mum .
( right ) myofibrils from a region ( represented by the red box , left ) of the anterior conical chamber of the heart .
the myofibrils extended the length of cardiomyocytes of control hand4.2 - gal4 x w1118 flies at one week of age , and they exhibited highly organized , repetitive striations , which reflect well - ordered sarcomeres .
in contrast , hearts of age - matched hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) flies demonstrated an aberrant morphology overall .
their cardiomyocytes displayed severe myofibrillar disarray and completely lacked cross - striations , indicative of compromised sarcomerogenesis and / or disrupted myofibrillar maintenance and degeneration .
this phenotype was consistently observed in all hearts of hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) adult flies .
scale bar = 5 mum .
figure 2 heart - restricted ter94rnai expression , driven by hand4.2 - gal4 or tinc - gal4 , reduces drosophila lifespan .
( a ) expression of uas - ter94rnai using the " strong " hand4.2 - gal4 driver shortened lifespan .
hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) flies exhibited radically poor survivorship .
hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l2 ) flies showed a better survival rate compared to ( l1 ) , albeit substantially reduced compared to the hand4.2 - gal4 x attp2 control .
( b ) expression of uas - ter94rnai ( l2 ) using a second " strong " driver , tinc - gal4 , also resulted in severely shortened lifespan .
tinc - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) exhibited pupal lethality .
( c ) expression of uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) using the " weak " gmh5 - gal4 driver did not overtly alter lifespan .
n = 300 flies / genotype .
figure 3 heart - restricted ter94rnai expression significantly reduces ter94 mrna .
viewrna fluorescence in situ hybridization ( viewrna fish ) was used to directly visualize and quantify ter94 mrna levels in the heart .
( a ) conical chamber of a control drosophila heart .
white particles represent individual ter94 transcripts and red particles represent individual gapdh messages , which served as an endogenous control .
signals emanating from pericardial cells ( p ) , fat ( f ) , and associated skeletal muscles ( not shown ) were excluded from quantification .
scale bar = 25 mum .
( b ) threshold adjusted ter94 transcript signals from cardiomyocyte - restricted regions of the conical chamber ( e.g. , depicted by the white box in ( a )) of hand4.2 - gal4 x w1118 and hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) flies ( left ) .
ter94 and gapdh transcript levels were quantified using the imagej particle counter and ter94 / gapdh ratio determined ( right ) .
a large discernible reduction in ter94 / gapdh mrna signals was evident in the hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) hearts compared to hand4.2 - gal4 x w1118 hearts .
significance was assessed via unpaired t - test , ** p < 0.001 , n = 7 .
( c ) threshold adjusted ter94 transcript signals from conical chamber regions of gmh5 - gal4 x w1118 and gmh5 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) flies ( left ) .
a small but significant decrease in ter94 / gapdh ratio was identified in gmh5 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) hearts compared to control ( right ) .
significance was assessed via unpaired t - test , * p < 0.05 , n = 7 .
figure 4 excessive ter94 knockdown causes a dilated cardiac phenotype .
( a ) semi - automated optical heartbeat analysis of hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l2 ) flies at one and three weeks of age ( 1 week : n = 25 ; 3 week : n = 20 ) unveiled a dilated cardiac phenotype at both time points relative to control ( 1 week : n = 23 ; 3 week : n = 20 ) .
diastolic and systolic diameters were significantly greater in hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l2 ) compared to hand4.2 - gal4 x attp2 .
in addition , age and ter94 knockdown led to a significant reduction in fractional shortening .
( b ) modest reduction of ter94 in gmh5 - gal4 > uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) hearts did not prompt any significant alterations in cardiac performance in one - , three - , or five - week - old flies ( 1 week : n = 21 ; 3 week : n = 20 ; 5 week : n = 20 ) compared to age - matched controls ( 1 week : n = 24 ; 3 week : n = 20 ; 5 week : n = 22 ) .
significance was assessed via two - way anova , bonferroni post - test .
figure 5 conditional expression of ter94rnai using the cardiac - specific ru486 - inducible hand4.2 - gs - gal4 driver disrupts the adult drosophila heart post - development .
( a ) post - development cardiac - restricted knockdown of ter94 ( induced by 100 mug / ml ru486 ) significantly shortened lifespan compared to that of cohorts on vehicle .
n = 300 flies / condition .
( b ) confocal micrographs showing extensive myofibrillar degeneration with substantial loss of sarcomeric material in the conical chamber of a fly following uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) expression relative to control .
images were taken after flies were maintained for three weeks on food supplemented with 100 mug / ml ru486 to activate rnai compared to siblings maintained on food with vehicle ( 100 % ethanol ) .
the aberrant myocardial phenotype was observed in all ru486 fed flies .
scale bar = 25 mum. ( c ) cardiac performance of flies on drug and expressing uas - ter94rnai ( l1 ) for one week post - eclosion ( n = 21 ) was unaltered compared to flies on vehicle ( n = 20 ) .
in contrast , after three weeks on drug , flies with ter94 knockdown ( n = 20 ) displayed poorly functioning hearts with significantly large systolic diameters and reduced fractional shortening vs. control ( n = 30 ) .
significance was assessed via two - way anova , bonferroni post - test .
figure 6 expression of ter94 msp disease alleles in drosophila causes cardiomyopathy .
( a ) confocal micrographs of myofibrils from the conical chamber of the hearts of five - week - old hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94wt , hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94r152h , hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94r188q , and hand4.2 - gal4 > uas - ter94a229e flies .
compared to wildtype ter94 , expression of the msp ter94 alleles did not noticeably alter cardiomyocyte myofibrillar organization .
scale bars' color demarcates genotype ( see ( b )) and = 5 mum .
( b ) assessment of cardiac function in flies expressing msp ter94 alleles revealed restrictive cardiac physiology as early as one week of age .
all three mutant transgenic lines displayed significantly restricted diastolic diameters resulting in reduced fractional shortening .
the phenotype did not worsen drastically with age , but all mutant hearts remained significantly restricted relative to age - matched controls .
significance was assessed via two - way anova , bonferroni post - test , n = 40 - 42 flies / genotype or age group .
figure 7 overexpressing ter94 msp mutant alleles in muscle progenitor cells causes structural defects in the drosophila embryonic heart .
dorsal views of stage 16 embryos expressing membrane - tethered cd8 - gfp and the indicated ter94 allele using the 24b - gal4 driver .
embryos were stained with anti - dmef2 antibody ( red ) to label the dorsal vessel ( enlarged in lower panels ) and somatic muscle cells .
( a ) in embryos that expressed uas - ter94wt , the two rows of cardioblasts aligned contralaterally to meet at the dorsal midline forming the dorsal vessel , and somatic cells were organized in a regular pattern .
( b - d ) in contrast , expression of the msp - inducing mutant ter94 alleles uas - ter94r152h , uas - ter94r188q , or uas - ter94a229e resulted in a disordered alignment of the cardiac cells and an abnormally twisted conformation of the dorsal vessel .
moreover , disorganization of the somatic muscle cell pattern at the body segments was evident .
the mutant phenotypes appeared modestly variable in severity and were highly penetrant .
nearly all embryos examined displayed aberrant somatic and / or cardiac muscular patterning .
scale bars = 25 mum .

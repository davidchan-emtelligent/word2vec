background shigella dysenteriae type 1 ( sd1 ) is a cause of major dysentery outbreaks , particularly among children and displaced populations in tropical countries .
although outbreaks continue , the characteristics of such outbreaks have rarely been documented .
here , we describe the sd1 outbreaks occurring between 1993 and 1995 in 11 refugee settlements in rwanda , tanzania and democratic republic of the congo ( drc ) .
we also explored the links between the different types of the camps and the magnitude of the outbreaks .
methodology / principal findings number of cases of bloody diarrhea and deaths were collected on a weekly basis in 11 refugee camps , and analyzed retrospectively. between november 1993 and february 1995 , 181,921 cases of bloody diarrhea were reported .
attack rates ranged from 6.3 % to 39.1 % and case fatality ratios ( cfrs ) from 1.5 % to 9.0 % ( available for 5 camps ) .
the cfrs were higher in children under age 5 .
in tanzania where the response was rapidly deployed , the mean attack rate was lower than in camps in the region of goma without an immediate response ( 13.3 % versus 32.1 % respectively ) .
conclusions / significance this description , and the areas where data is missing , highlight both the importance of collecting data in future epidemics , difficulties in documenting outbreaks occurring in complex emergencies and most importantly , the need to assure that minimal requirements are met .
introduction shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 ( sd1 ) has been identified as the cause of large - scale dysentery outbreaks , which are often associated with high attack rates ( ar ) and case fatality ratios ( cfrs ) [ 1 ] - [ 5 ] .
over the last fifty years , sd1 outbreaks were reported from central america [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , bangladesh [ 8 ] , south asia [ 9 ] , and central [ 10 ] - [ 12 ] and southern africa [ 13 ] - [ 14 ] .
the last reported large - scale sd1 outbreak occurred in sierra leone in 1999 [ 15 ] - [ 16 ] .
displaced populations , faced with an insufficient supply of clean water , poor sanitation , overcrowding and concomitant malnutrition are at high risk for dysentery outbreaks [ 17 ] - [ 24 ] .
in 1993 and 1994 , civil wars devastated burundi and rwanda and led to the displacement of millions of people .
in april 1994 , approximately 500,000 refugees from rwanda crossed the border into tanzania [ 20 ] .
more than fifteen non - governmental organizations ( ngos ) and the united nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) provided medical support .
within days , camps were supplied with drinking and potable water , non - perishable food , latrines and transportation systems [ 25 ] .
a second mass influx of refugees occurred between july 14 and 17 , 1994 when approximately one million people crossed into neighboring zaire ( now democratic republic of congo , drc ) .
refugees entered drc principally through the town of goma , north of lake kivu , and during the following weeks , thousands died of cholera around goma [ 20 ] .
many of the survivors moved further north into drc to large camps or within the town of goma .
the context in which the camps were set - up in drc differed substantially from those in tanzania .
in drc , ngos were overwhelmed by the massive influx of refugees over a very short time .
water resources , sanitation and local infrastructure were severely deficient [ 20 ] , [ 26 ] .
the medical ngo medecins sans frontieres ( msf ) was involved in the response to 11 outbreaks of bloody diarrhea occurring in camps located in tanzania , rwanda and drc , all related to laboratory - confirmed sd1 .
here , we use msf surveillance data to describe the sd1 outbreaks in these settlements .
methods we describe 11 outbreaks of bloody diarrhea , which occurred in refugee settings supported by msf between 1993 and 1995 in rwanda ( kaduha , rukondo and nzangwa ) , tanzania ( benaco and lumashi ) , and drc ( kibumba , mungunga , katale , kashusha , kalehe and inera ) .
data collection and assumptions data presented here come from two different sources : published literature referenced in pubmed / medline ; and grey literature from the msf archives , mainly " field reports " written at the time .
for each camp , we collected data on ( i ) number of cases / deaths of bloody diarrhea ; ( ii ) results of bacteriological examinations ; and ( iii ) crowding , sanitation , water and food supply .
bacteriological examinations were not routinely available for individual diagnosis and dysentery was diagnosed clinically .
we used the who clinical case definition used at the time , to define a dysentery case as any person with diarrhea ( passage of 3 or more watery or loose stools in the past 24 hours ) and visible blood in the stool [ 27 ] .
sd1 was identified as the causative organism of bloody diarrhea in all eleven camps [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 and msf unpublished data ] and dysentery cases were assumed to be caused by sd1 .
in most refugee settings , the surveillance began on august 1994 except for nzangwa in rwanda ( november 1993 ) and benaco and lumashi in tanzania ( april 1994 ) .
as recommended by who guidelines [ 27 ] , the number of cases and deaths related to dysentery were collected on a weekly basis for two age groups : children under five years , and persons five years or older .
the mean weekly camp populations ( under 5 's and 5 years and older ) were used as denominator to estimate attack rates ( ar ) .
for three camps ( kaduha , nzangwa and katale ) , population data were not available on a weekly basis .
in each of these camps , total population size was based on information provided by msf field workers ( based on epidemiologic studies ) , and was considered constant over time [ msf unpublished data , 24 ] .
the mean weekly population for each camp is shown in table 1 .

data analysis camps were grouped according to the sphere requirements for ( i ) water supply ( estimated by the average quantity of water available per person per day ) ; ( ii ) food availability ( estimated by the average food ration in kcal / person / day ) ; and ( iii ) sanitation ( estimated by the average number of individuals using each latrine ) [ 30 ] .
minimum requirements were 7 - 15 liters of water / person / day , 2100 kcal / person / day , and a maximum of 20 persons per latrine .
for shelter and settlement , health infrastructures and transportation system , precise quantitative estimates were impossible .
as , we could get only an overall picture of the logistic organization and health system in each camp , we considered the size ( maximum population ) of camps as a proxy classification for complexity and logistic difficulties .
we categorized camps as : small ( maximum weekly population ranging from 10,000 to 34,000 ) , medium ( 35,000 to 79,000 ) , and large ( 80,000 to 217,000 ) .
cutoffs were chosen according to the values of first and third quartile of maximum weekly population .
descriptive statistics were performed using the r statistical package ( r development core team ; r foundation for statistical computing [ http :// www.r - project.org ]) .
all data analysed in this work are strictly anonymous and come from a routine surveillance system , therefore no ethical approval was required .
results population in camps the mean weekly population in each camp ranged from 8,588 refugees in the smallest camp of kalehe ( drc ) to 215,889 in the largest ( benaco - tanzania , table 1 ) .
the mean proportion of population under 5 was around 18 % ( range : 17 % - 21 %) .

the attack rates varied greatly between camps , ranging from 6 % in inera to 39 % in the large camp of kibumba in drc ( figure 1 ) .
the cfrs for dysentery could be estimated only for five camps .
the highest cfr , 9.0 % was recorded in inera ( drc ) .
in the other four camps , the cfrs were lower ( table 1 ) .
the cfrs were higher in children under 5 with the highest cfr seen in inera ( 18.3 %) and lowest cfr ( 1.6 %) in rukondo .
the median duration of dysentery epidemics was 27 weeks , ranging from 5 ( in inera ) to 29 weeks in benaco .

the first documented sd1 epidemic started in rwandan camp of nzangwa in november 1993 ( figure 2 ) .
the epidemic ended by april 1994 as the camp residents , burundian refugees , began to return to burundi with the onset of the conflict in rwanda .
the next two epidemics occurred in tanzania , in benaco ( may - october , 1994 ) and in lumashi ( june - october , 1994 ) , following massive influx of refugees from rwanda .
the largest epidemic started in drc in august 1994 and lasted until february 1995 .
at the same time , dysentery outbreaks were reported from the rwandan camps of kaduha and rukondo .
outbreaks occurred throughout the calendar year with eight outbreaks beginning between june and october , during the dry season ( figure 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004494.g002 figure 2 weekly number of cases of bloody diarrhea between november 1993 and february 1995 .
the first documented sd1 epidemic started in rwanda in nzangwa camp in november 1993 .
the epidemic ended in march - april 1994 as burundian refugees began to return from rwanda to burundi at the beginning of the conflict in rwanda .
the two following outbreaks occurred in tanzania , in benaco ( may - october , 1994 ) and in lumashi ( june - october , 1994 ) , corresponding to the first massive influx of refugees who fled rwanda .
the major epidemic started in drc ( democratic republic of congo , formerly zaire ) around july - august 1994 and lasted until february 1995 .
at the same time , a revival of epidemic activity was observed in the rwandan camps of kaduha and rukondo .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004494.g003 figure 3 time course of the epidemics in relation to the seasons .
four seasons are usually observed in the great lakes region : two dry seasons ( december to mid - march and june to october ) and 2 rainy seasons ( october to december and mid - march to the end of may ) .
three outbreaks ( in nzangwa , benaco and lumashi ) started during the rainy season ( november , may and june , respectively ) and peaked in the dry season .
the start of eight subsequent outbreaks occurred during the dry period .
however , since surveillance data was not available from the start of these outbreaks , they are likely to have started at the end of the rainy / beginning of the dry period .
most outbreaks were concentrated between june and october .
differences between camps the mean attack rates were 18.3 % (+/ - 9.9 ) , 13.5 % (+/ - 4.8 ) and 28.1 % (+/ - 9.4 ) in small , medium and large camps respectively ( median 12.3 % , 10.8 % and 34.4 % , respectively ) .
considering the context of settlement and availability of resources ( table 2 ) , three different situations occurred : ( 1 ) benaco and lumashi in tanzania , ( 2 ) goma in drc , and ( 3 ) bukavu in drc .
in tanzania , the two camps were supplied with medical support , drinking and potable water , non - perishable food , latrines and transportation systems from the first days of the influx of refugees .
lumashi residents were provided with 15 l of water per day and each latrine was shared by twenty refugees .
in benaco , water supply was inadequate ( 3.7 l per person per day ) at the beginning of the epidemic , but rapidly increased in the following weeks ( table 2 ) .
conversely , in the three camps located around goma ( katale , kibumba and lumashi ) , the capacity of relief organizations was immediately overwhelmed , the construction of latrines seriously impeded by the rocky volcanic topography of the site , and water resources were severely deficient .
in the first days of the epidemic , less than 1 l of water was available per person and per day , and hardly reached 3 l after 6 days .
in these camps , these estimates correspond to the amount of " safe " water delivered by ngos .
refugees completed their daily water ration by their own means ( streams , lake , etc. ) .
the number of residents per latrine was extremely high , from 184 per latrine in katale to 1030 in mugunga .
as expected , the mean attack rate was lower in the camps with favorable context of settlement , compared to those where relief capacities were quickly overwhelmed , in the region of goma ( 13.3 %+/ - 2.1 versus 32.1 %+/ - 6.9 respectively ) .
in the region of bukavu ( south of lake kivu , drc ) , attack rates were much lower than in goma .
delivered water supply reached 2 to 6 l per resident per day .
the average food ration , although under the minimum recommended , was the highest among the eleven camps considered ( 2000 kcal / person / day in kashusha ) .
the three camps in bukavu located in this region reported good organization of the sites , with shelters available for all refugees , laid out in lines and rows , and the availability of medical support .
discussion civil disturbances in 1993 - 1995 in the great lakes region led to large - scale and prolonged epidemics of sd1 , with major burden among displaced populations .
the observed cfrs were higher in children under 5 , confirming previous observations [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] .
as expected , the context of settlement , availability of resources and speed of response seemed to be crucial to reduce the burden of sd1 outbreaks , as noted when examining the mean attack rates : 13.3 % ( standard deviation , sd = 2.1 ) in tanzania , where resources were quickly available versus 32.1 % ( sd = 6.9 ) in the region of goma .
data presented are based on a clinical definition of dysentery from a surveillance system put in place in the context of a civil war and major humanitarian crisis .
in this context , like in many complex emergencies , the surveillance system was the only source of data available and confirmation of cases was not possible .
although attempts were made to derive a model for attack rates , we feel that the data were too disparate to identify explanatory factors by statistical modelling , and chose to present a descriptive analysis .
this surveillance data does not reflect all shigella cases , but rather provides a guide concerning the magnitude of the outbreaks .
previous studies suggest that less than one - third of culture - proven shigellosis episodes present with dysentery [ 3 ] .
special attempts were made to obtain precise and reliable data from all camps in the region , but we nevertheless made several assumptions .
for example , the count of the total population was not available on a weekly basis in all camps ( kaduha , nzangwa and katale ) .
however , population estimates in the 8 other camps ( based on weekly estimations ) were relatively constant over time , and estimates provided by msf field workers ( based on epidemiologic studies ) were concordant with the published literature .
despite intensive literature search performed both in pubmed and the archives of msf , key indicators could not be estimated for each camp .
despite the need to make assumptions about missing data , this description is consistent with those presented in previous observational studies in terms of attack rates and case fatality ratios [ 19 ] - [ 24 ] .
the cfrs observed during this crisis were high compared to the mortality found in recent epidemiological studies in endemic settings in asia [ 3 ] .
these differences can be related to host factors such as nutrition status , co - infections or the virulence of the organism including the emergence of antibiotic resistances in central africa at that time .
the strain identified in the region of goma ( drc ) was resistant to most commonly used antibiotics , including nalidixic acid [ 20 ] .
inappropriate antibiotic treatment likely played a significant role in the emergence of resistance , and consequently on the cfrs .
these data likely underestimate the true cfr , especially in a context of high resistance [ 32 ] .
we present crude data from number of sources , which provide only snapshots of resistance .
ideally , microbiologic examination should have been performed throughout the duration of the outbreaks which was not possible in an emergency setting .
where data were available , we examined the weekly cfr by week and no particular trend was observed , however it is probable that conjunction of antibiotic resistance , poor sanitary conditions and insufficient food and water supply lead to the major crisis observed in goma .
there may well be a place for a future shigella vaccine which would be of great interest in the prevention of dysentery outbreaks and containment of drug resistance .
such vaccine could potentially be used in a reactive way , although preventive use is clearly preferable .
the utility of a future vaccine would largely depend on its administration ( e.g. number of injections , oral or injectable ) .
meanwhile , effective antibiotics have to be readily available where needed .
considering the current resistance data available , quinolone ii generation ( e.g. ciprofloxacin ) is now recommended [ 33 ] .
this description , and the areas where data is missing , highlight both the importance of collecting data in future epidemics and the potential difficulties in documenting outbreaks occurring in complex emergencies .
the contrast between camps located in tanzania compared to those in the region of goma ( drc ) , in terms of number of cases and deaths related to bloody diarrhoea , further reinforce the need for a rapid response by health agencies .
the top ten public health priorities for complex humanitarian emergencies [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] should be kept in mind ( box s1 ) .
in 2008 , the confrontation between the congolese army and an armed opposition group forced 400,000 people from their homes and threatens to cause another major crisis among displaced populations ( source : unhcr ) .
if sd1 is still circulating in the region , it could re - emerge and have a devastating effect .

objective it is highly debated whether associations between osteoporosis and atherosclerosis are independent of cardiovascular risk factors .
we aimed to explore the associations between quantitative ultrasound ( qus ) parameters at the heel with the carotid artery intima - media thickness ( imt ) , the presence of carotid artery plaques , and the ankle - brachial index ( abi ) .
methods the study population comprised 5680 men and women aged 20 - 93 years from two population - based cohort studies : study of health in pomerania ( ship ) and ship - trend .
qus measurements were performed at the heel .
the extracranial carotid arteries were examined with b - mode ultrasonography .
abi was measured in a subgroup of 3853 participants .
analyses of variance and linear and logistic regression models were calculated and adjusted for major cardiovascular risk factors .
results men but not women had significantly increased odds for carotid artery plaques with decreasing qus parameters independent of diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , and hypertension .
beyond this , the qus parameters were not significantly associated with imt or abi in fully adjusted models .
conclusions our data argue against an independent role of bone metabolism in atherosclerotic changes in women .
yet , in men , associations with advanced atherosclerosis , exist .
thus , men presenting with clinical signs of osteoporosis may be at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease .

introduction osteoporosis and atherosclerosis substantially impact the elderly , leading to increased morbidity and mortality [ 1 , 2 ] .
osteoporosis , on the one side , is a chronic disease characterized by low bone mass , microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue , and an increased fracture risk [ 1 ] .
based on these diagnostic criteria , 27.6 million women and men in the european union are affected by osteoporosis [ 1 ] .
atherosclerosis , on the other side , is characterized by loss of elasticity of the artery walls , wall thickening , and plaque formation [ 2 ] .
cardiovascular disease due to atherosclerosis represents a major economic burden on the european health care system , with estimated annual costs of 192 billion euros [ 3 ] .
moreover , cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide , with more than 17.5 million deaths in 2012 [ 4 ] .
osteoporosis and atherosclerosis share common risk factors like aging , dyslipidemia , oxidative stress , inflammation , hypertension , and diabetes [ 2 , 5 ] .
furthermore , they share molecular pathways involving , for example , bone and vascular mineralization or inflammatory processes [ 6 ] .
despite these common risk factors , epidemiologic studies suggested an independent association between low bone mass and atherosclerosis [ 5 , 7 ] .
thus , a population - based study including [ 5 ] 2726 postmenopausal women and 2543 men from norway reported associations between low bone mineral density ( bmd ) and echogenic calcified atherosclerotic plaques .
further , lower volumetric trabecular lumbar bmd was associated with advanced carotid plaque in 1833 postmenopausal women and men from a subsample of the multi - ethnic study of atherosclerosis [ 7 ] .
in that study [ 7 ] , also , associations of lower volumetric trabecular lumbar bmd with lower ankle - brachial index ( abi ) and increased internal carotid artery intima - media thickness ( imt ) were found in men but not in women .
a male - specific inverse association between femoral neck bmd and the 10 - year risk for coronary heart disease was also described in a study including 5415 men and 7409 women from the general population in korea [ 8 ] .
on the other side , associations between bmd and pulse wave velocity [ 9 ] as well as between bmd loss and coronary artery calcification [ 10 ] were described for women only .
the previous study results [ 5 , 7 - 10 ] appear even more controversial when considering that competing studies reported no associations between a low bmd and carotid imt as well as pulse wave velocity and abi [ 11 ] or that associations between peripheral artery disease and bone loss turned nonsignificant after age adjustment [ 12 ] .
taken together , it is still uncertain whether low bone quality is associated with atherosclerotic changes independent of major cardiovascular risk factors like diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , or hypertension or whether sex - specific differences exist .
besides , there are only few data in the association between bone quality at the heel , measured by quantitative ultrasound ( qus ) , and atherosclerosis [ 13 , 14 ] .
we therefore aimed to explore the associations between qus - based parameters , with carotid artery imt , the presence of carotid artery plaques , and the abi in the general population .
2. subjects and methods 2.1 .
study populations the present analysis is based on data from two population - based cohort studies in northeast germany : the second follow - up of the study of health in pomerania ( ship - 2 ) and ship - trend .
details on the study design , protocols , and sampling methods have been reported elsewhere [ 15 , 16 ] .
in short , the baseline examinations in the ship cohort were performed between 1997 and 2001 with a total of 4308 men and women aged 20 - 81 years .
the second follow - up ( ship - 2 ) was performed between 2008 and 2012 with 2333 subjects aged 30 - 93 years being re - examined .
the baseline examinations in the ship - trend cohort were performed in parallel with ship - 2 between 2008 and 2012 with a total of 4420 adult men and women aged 20 - 84 years .
all investigations were carried out in accordance with the declaration of helsinki , including written informed consent of all participants .
the study methods were approved by an institutional review board ( ethics committee at the university of greifswald ) .
data from ship - 2 and ship - trend were pooled for the present analyses. from the resulting population of n = 6753 , all subjects with missing data in qus , imt , plaque , or confounder variables were excluded as well as subjects with extremely high values in the qus variables , pregnant women , subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) below 30 ml / min / 1.73m2 or missing egfr , and those who reported with intake of bisphosphonates , selective estrogen receptor modulators , parathyroid hormone , steroids , or strontium ranelate ( for details , see supplemental figure 1 available online at https :// doi.org / 10.1155 / 2017 / 3946569 ) .
the resulting study population comprised 5680 subjects .
among these subjects , two - thirds ( 67.8 %) participated in the abi examination , resulting in a subsample of 3853 subjects .
2.2 .
interview and physical examination all ship - 2 and ship - trend participants were offered a large range of standardized medical examinations , biomaterial sampling , and an extensive computer - aided personal interview .
during the personal interview , information on sociodemographic characteristics , lifestyle , and medical histories were collected .
all participants were asked to bring their medications taken seven days prior to the time of examination .
medication data were obtained online using the idom program ( online drug - database leaded medication assessment ) and classified using the anatomical - therapeutic - chemical ( atc ) classification system .
intake of bisphosphonates was defined as atc m05ba - bb , selective estrogen receptor modulators as atc g03xc , pth preparations as atc h05aa , strontium ranelate as atc m05bx03 , glucocorticoids for systemic use as atc h02ab and h02bx , vitamin d preparations as atc a11cc , and cardioprotective medication as atc c. participants were defined as physically inactive if they reported less than one hour of regular physical activity per week during summer and winter .
risky alcohol consumption was defined as alcohol intake at or above 30 g / day in men and 20 g / day in women .
all women older than 60 years of age and women between 40 and 60 years of age without self - reported menstrual cycling were classified as postmenopausal .
years since menopause were calculated as the difference between current age and age at last menstruation .
standardized measurements of body height and weight were performed with calibrated scales .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight ( kg )/ height2 ( m2 ) .
systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured three times on the right arm of seated subjects , using a digital blood pressure monitor ( hem - 705cp , omron corporation , tokyo , japan ) .
the mean of the second and third measurements was used for statistical analyses .
hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmhg or self - reported intake of antihypertensive medication .
diabetes mellitus was defined when a respective physician 's diagnosis or intake of antidiabetic medication ( atc a10 ) was reported , when hba1c was >= 6.5 % or serum glucose concentrations were >= 11.1 mmol / l. dyslipidemia was defined as total cholesterol concentration >= 6.2 mmol / l or ldl - cholesterol concentration >= 4.1 mmol / l or hdl - cholesterol concentration < 1.04 mmol / l or triglycerides >= 1.7 mmol / l or intake of lipid - modifying agents ( atc c10 ) .
2.3 .
qus qus at the heel was performed using the achilles insight device ( ge medical systems ultrasound , ge healthcare , chalfont st. giles , u.k. ) , a water - based bone ultrasonometer , as reported previously [ 17 ] .
two devices without systematic differences were used during the course of the study .
the measurements were performed successively on both feet of the seated participants by trained and certified examiners .
alcohol was used as a coupling agent .
the system measures the frequency - dependent attenuation of the sound waves ( broadband ultrasound attenuation ( bua )) and the speed of sound waves ( sos ) as they pass through the heel ( os calcis ) .
bua and sos were combined to form the stiffness index according to the following formula : stiffness index = ( 0.67 x bua ) + ( 0.28 x sos ) - 420 .
the system automatically compares individual stiffness index results to values obtained in a healthy young reference population .
indices below the reference mean minus 2.5 standard deviations were taken to indicate a high osteoporotic fracture risk , indices above the reference mean minus 2.5 standard deviations but below the reference mean minus 1 standard deviations were taken to indicate a medium osteoporotic fracture risk , and indices above the reference mean minus 1 standard deviations were taken to indicate a low osteoporotic fracture risk [ 17 ] .
2.4 .
imt and plaques certified medical assistants examined the extracranial carotid arteries with b - mode ultrasonography ( vivid - i , ge medical systems , waukesha , wi , usa ) using a broad - bandwidth linear array transducer with an operating frequency of 13 mhz .
longitudinal scans of the distal straight portion of the far wall of the common carotid artery ( cca ) of both sides were recorded .
cca - imt was assessed on - screen using a semiautomated edge tracking software , which measures the distance between the lumen - intima and media - adventitia interfaces at an arterial segment of 1 cm in length located directly proximal to the widening of the artery at the bifurcation .
the " mean cca - imt ," which was used for statistical analyses , was calculated as the average of the mean values of 250 measurement points of each side .
the carotid arteries were further evaluated in longitudinal and cross - sectional scans for the presence of atherosclerotic plaques .
each arterial segment ( i.e. , the left or right common carotid artery , internal carotid artery , external carotid artery , and the carotid bifurcation ) was categorized into either affected by plaque or plaque - free .
if at least one arterial segment was classified as being affected by plaque , " carotid plaques " were defined as being present .
further , the number of arterial sites affected by plaque ranging between zero and eight was recorded .
2.5 .
abi the doppler method was used to determine systolic blood pressure in both arms ( brachial artery ) and both ankles ( anterior and posterior tibial arteries ) for the calculation of the abi .
after at least ten minutes of rest in the supine position , the measurements were started .
the measurements were performed with the " dopplex d900 " ( huntleigh healthcare ltd. , cardiff , u.k. ) and a blood pressure cuff ( welch allyn , skaneateles falls , usa ) .
the calculation of the abi followed the guidelines of the american heart association [ 18 ] .
the higher of the anterior and posterior tibial artery systolic blood pressure of each leg was divided by the higher of the right or left brachial artery systolic blood pressure .
the lower of the right or left leg abis was used for statistical analyses .
2.6 .
laboratory measurements blood samples were taken between 7 a.m. and 1 p.m. from participants in the supine position .
creatinine , glucose , total cholesterol , triglyceride , hdl - cholesterol , and ldl - cholesterol serum concentrations were measured on the dimension vista ( siemens healthcare diagnostics , eschborn , germany ) .
hba1c concentrations were measured with high performance liquid chromatography on a diamat analyzer ( bio - rad laboratories , munich , germany ) .
serum 25 - hydroxy vitamin d ( 25ohd ) concentrations were measured in a subgroup of 3540 ( 62.3 %) ship - trend participants with the ids - isys 25 - hydroxy vitamin d assay on the ids - isys multidiscipline automated analyser ( immunodiagnostic systems limited , frankfurt am main , germany ) .
the egfr was calculated according to the 4 - variable modification of diet in renal disease equation [ 19 ] .
2.7 .
statistical analyses due to previously reported marked differences between men and women in the association between bone metabolism and atherosclerotic changes , all analyses were stratified by sex .
continuous data are expressed as median ( 1st - 3rd quartiles ) and nominal data as percentage .
the kruskal - wallis test or the chi2 test was used for group comparisons .
a value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
analyses of variance ( anova ) and linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of the qus - based parameters ( exposures : bua , sos , stiffness index , and risk for osteoporotic fractures ) with the cardiovascular parameters ( outcomes : imt , carotid plaque , the number of arterial segments , and abi ) .
in all analyses , a one standard deviation decrease in the continuous exposure variables ( bua 13.7 and 14.7 db / mhz ; sos 37.5 and 33.5 m / s ; and stiffness index 18.1 and 17.5 in men and women , resp. ) was modelled .
in models with the categorical exposure variable , osteoporotic fracture risk , a low osteoporotic fracture risk was used as a reference category .
the outcomes imt and abi entered the regression models as continuous variables , while carotid plaque was dichotomized ( present / not present ) .
finally , the number of arterial segments affected by plaque was used as a continuous variable .
it was transformed ( log ( number of segments + 1 )) before being entered in the anova or linear regression models .
we report adjusted means with 95 % confidence intervals from the anova , beta - coefficients with standard errors and p values from the linear regression models and odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals from the logistic regression models .
results from unadjusted and fully adjusted models , including age , bmi , smoking status , physical inactivity , risky alcohol consumption , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidemia , hypertension , and , in women , intake of estrogens ( oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy ) and years since menopause , are presented .
among the ship - 2 and ship - trend participants , a subpopulation underwent the abi examination .
to account for the possible selection bias according to nonparticipation , inverse probability weights using sex , age , smoking , education , equivalence household income , blood pressure , antihypertensive medication , diabetes mellitus , hba1c , lipids , and bmi as explanatory variables were applied [ 20 ] .
all statistical analyses were performed with sas 9.4 ( sas institute inc. , cary , north carolina , usa ) .
3. results the majority of men ( 68.2 %) and women ( 61.2 %) in our study population had a low qus - based osteoporotic fracture risk .
on the other side , 4.4 % of men and 6.5 % of women had a high and 27.4 % and 32.3 % a medium qus - based osteoporotic fracture risk , respectively .
the presence of cardiovascular risk factors differed between the three fracture risk groups .
men with a high fracture risk were older , had lower bmi , were more often smokers or physically inactive , and were more often risky alcohol consumers than men with a low or medium fracture risk .
women with a high risk were also older than those with a low or medium risk , had more often diabetes , dyslipidemia , and hypertension but did not differ with respect to bmi , physical inactivity , and risky alcohol consumption .
besides , the cca - imt , the presence of plaques , and the number of arterial segments affected by plaque significantly increased over the three risk groups in men and women ( table 1 ) .
in unadjusted linear regression analyses , inverse associations of bua , sos , stiffness index , or the qus - based osteoporotic fracture risk with the cca - imt were found .
in men , for example , a decrease in the stiffness index by 18.1 points was associated with an increase in cca - imt of 0.016 cm. after adjustment for age ( data not shown ) and also in fully adjusted models , however , the associations were not confirmed ( table 2 ) .
regarding plaques , unadjusted logistic regression analyses demonstrated significantly increased odds for the presence of plaques with decreasing qus - based parameters in both sexes .
in fully adjusted models , these associations were confirmed in men but not in women ( table 3 ) .
men with a high fracture risk had significantly increased odds for plaque occurrence compared to men with a low risk .
in men , also , the number of arterial segments affected by plaque significantly increased over the risk categories ( figure 1 ) in unadjusted as well as in the fully adjusted anova .
in women , similar findings were made in unadjusted analyses , whereas in fully adjusted models , the results disappeared .
in the subpopulation with abi measurement , the proportions of men and women with high , medium , or low fracture risk were comparable to the proportions in the whole population ( men and women high risk : 69.2 % and 62.1 % ; medium risk : 26.3 % and 32.0 % ; and low risk : 4.5 % and 5.9 % ; for more details , see supplemental table 1 ) .
the abi was similar between the three risk groups [ median ( 1st - 3rd quartiles ) for men and women with a high risk : 1.12 ( 1.07 - 1.19 ) and 1.11 ( 1.07 - 1.18 ) , medium risk : 1.13 ( 1.07 - 1.19 ) and 1.13 ( 1.08 - 1.19 ) , and low risk : 1.12 ( 1.04 - 1.21 ) and 1.13 ( 1.08 - 1.18 ) , resp. ] .
fully adjusted , sex - specific linear regression models ( supplemental table 2 ) revealed no significant association between the qus parameters and the abi in men or women .
4. discussion in the present study , we demonstrated associations between decreased bone quality , defined by heel qus parameters , and the presence of atherosclerotic carotid artery plaque in men .
these associations were independent of major cardiovascular risk factors , including dyslipidemia , diabetes , and hypertension .
in contrast , our data do not provide evidence for relevant independent associations of heel bone quality with cca - imt or abi .
traditionally , osteoporosis and atherosclerosis have been regarded as independent processes sharing common risk factors , for example , aging [ 21 ] .
recent evidence from cell culture as well as epidemiological studies , however , points to an age - independent association between osteoporosis and atherosclerosis [ 6 , 22 ] .
defects in bone mineralization and arterial calcification were attributed of having a similar pathogenesis [ 6 ] , and associations between bone quality and atherosclerotic changes independent of cardiovascular risk factors have been proposed .
following this hypothesis , the previous studies [ 23 , 24 ] demonstrated associations between decreased bmd and increased imt in elderly individuals .
for example , the san antonio family osteoporosis study demonstrated that decreased bmd at various sites is correlated with carotid artery imt in older women and men [ 23 ] .
among the ship - 2 and ship - trend participants , highly significant inverse associations between the qus - based parameters and the carotid artery imt were observed in unadjusted models but turned nonsignificant after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors .
comparable observations were made by frost et al .
[ 25 ] , who found associations between spine bmd and imt , but the relationship was not significant after adjustment for age , mean arterial pressure , and triglycerides .
while our data thus argues against independent associations between bone metabolism and imt , it provides evidence for a male - specific relation with carotid artery plaques .
cca - imt and plaques are biologically and genetically distinct markers of atherosclerosis .
they differ with respect to specific pattern of risk factors , their pathogenesis , and their ability to predict cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events [ 26 ] .
numerous factors including inflammation , protein metabolism , and oxidative stress were proposed to promote development of disease in both osteoporotic and atherosclerotic changes [ 7 ] .
these factors are likely involved in the pathogenesis of focal atherosclerotic plaques but are less important for an arterial wall thickening of the cca , which may explain the strong association between qus - based bone quality and plaque occurrence and the nonsignificant association between bone quality and imt .
corresponding observations of associations between bone quality and the presence of plaques were reported from various studies [ 5 , 25 , 27 , 28 ] .
for example , the tromso study [ 5 ] showed that bmd was associated with calcified echogenic plaque independent of potential confounders , mediators , and shared risk factors in men and women [ 5 ] .
also , hyder et al. investigated in 904 postmenopausal women and 929 men an independent association between echogenically measured carotid plaque and lower volumetric trabecular lumbar bmd [ 7 ] .
while our results were restricted to men , other studies reported associations between carotid plaques and bmd only in women [ 10 , 27 ] or were restricted to women [ 25 , 29 , 30 ] .
nevertheless , also , male - specific associations between bmd and plaques [ 7 , 8 , 31 , 32 ] were previously reported .
the sex differences in the examined associations may be explained by differences in bone metabolism between men and women .
men have a higher peak of bone mass than women [ 33 ] , and osteoporosis emerges later in life and is more often due to secondary causes [ 34 ] .
at the same time , osteoporosis is strongly associated with comorbidities and frailty in men than in women [ 35 ] and men have a higher fracture - related mortality than women [ 36 ] .
thus , men presenting with clinical signs of osteoporosis may be generally more frail and present with a larger number of comorbidities than men without such signs .
this probably explains the increased risk of cardiovascular pathologies with decreasing bone quality , independent of age , and further cardiovascular risk factors .
in these men , heightened awareness regarding atherosclerotic changes may be of clinical importance .
in previous studies , bone quality was rarely assessed by qus , instead dual - x - ray - absorptiometry ( dxa ) was performed .
dxa provides information on bmd and is the recommended measurement in the diagnosis and monitoring of osteoporosis [ 37 , 38 ] .
however , also , qus provides reliable results to predict fracture risk [ 39 , 40 ] and has the advantage of being radiation - free and easy to handle .
to our knowledge , there are only few studies using qus to investigate the association between bone quality and atherosclerosis [ 13 , 41 - 43 ] .
these studies reported conflicting results , but predominantly suggest an association between qus and atherosclerotic changes , which is in line with our results .
next to imt and plaques , we assessed the relation between bone stiffness and abi , as a marker of vascular calcification and increased vessel stiffness [ 44 ] .
it is known that decreased blood flow to the lower limbs caused by pad leads to compromising the bone quality [ 45 ] .
in line with this , the rotterdam study [ 46 ] , including 5268 individuals , reported a significantly increased risk for pad in women with a low femoral neck bmd even after adjusting for age .
our study failed to show an association between bone stiffness and abi .
yet , pad as defined by abi <= 0.9 was rare in our study population ; only 1.53 % of participants entailed these values , and early stages of pad may not impair bone health [ 12 ] .
this may have prevented us from detecting a respective association .
moreover , our results are in line with the majority of previous studies that report no [ 43 , 47 ] or only weak [ 12 , 48 ] associations between bmd and arterial stiffness .
our study has several strengths and limitations .
strengths result from the large sample including men and women over a large age range ( 20 - 93 years ) .
further , all study participants underwent intensive medical examinations with highly standardized procedures , assuring high data quality .
moreover , we adjusted our models for interfering covariates to assess the impact of comorbidities .
besides these strengths , our study has its limitations .
first , the cross - sectional design does not allow assessing causality between the measures .
second , cardioprotective drugs were taken by a large proportion ( 40.7 %) of our study population .
the intake of such medication reduces the cardiovascular risk and may lead to an underestimation of the effect of the examined associations .
third , bmd measurements were not available ; thus , our study is not directly comparable to other studies using bmd .
however , the qus - based results provide complementary evidence and , in a population - based research setting , offer the advantage of being simpler , less expensive , and free of ionizing radiation .
fourth , abi measurements were only available in a subsample .
to rule out that nonparticipation resulted in a selection bias , we weighted the respective data based on social - demographic and health - related variables .
fifth , 25ohd concentrations were unavailable in nearly 40 % of the study population , and vitamin d intake was reported by only 29 subjects .
therefore , we refrained from including that information in the analyses .
sixth , our study was performed exclusively in caucasian european subjects ; thus , our results may not be directly transferrable to other regions or ethnicities .
in conclusion , our data argue against an independent role of bone metabolism in atherosclerotic changes in women .
yet , in men , associations with atherosclerotic changes , especially formation of plaques , seem present .
thus , men presenting with clinical signs of osteoporosis may be at increased risk for atherosclerotic disease .
further studies are needed to understand the relation between calcified plaque and decreased bone quality .

this article is licensed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 unported licence ( cc by 3.0 ) reactive oxygen species ( ros ) scavenging mn3o4 nanozymes effectively protected live mice from ros - induced ear - inflammation in vivo .
reactive oxygen species ( ros ) - induced oxidative stress is linked to various diseases , including cardiovascular disease and cancer .
though highly efficient natural ros scavenging enzymes have been evolved , they are sensitive to environmental conditions and hard to mass - produce .
therefore , enormous efforts have been devoted to developing artificial enzymes with ros scavenging activities .
among them , ros scavenging nanozymes have recently attracted great interest owing to their enhanced stability , multi - functionality , and tunable activity .
it has been implicated that mn - contained nanozymes would possess efficient ros scavenging activities , however only a few such nanozymes have been reported .
to fill this gap , herein we demonstrated that mn3o4 nanoparticles ( nps ) possessed multiple enzyme mimicking activities ( i.e. , superoxide dismutase and catalase mimicking activities as well as hydroxyl radical scavenging activity ) .
the mn3o4 nanozymes therefore significantly scavenged superoxide radical as well as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical .
moreover , they were not only more stable than the corresponding natural enzymes but also superior to ceo2 nanozymes in terms of ros elimination .
we showed that the mn3o4 nps not only exhibited excellent ros removal efficacy in vitro but also effectively protected live mice from ros - induced ear - inflammation in vivo .
these results indicated that mn3o4 nanozymes are promising therapeutic nanomedicine for treating ros - related diseases .
introduction inflammation has been demonstrated to cause various diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis,1 cardiovascular diseases,2 and even cancer.3 it has been established that the dysregulation of highly active reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , including superoxide radical (. o2 - ) , hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) and hydroxyl radical (. oh ) , plays very important roles in these diseases.4 the dysregulated ros can lead to oxidative stress , causing harm to biomolecules like dna , proteins and lipids.5,6 therefore , live organisms have evolved a number of antioxidant enzymes to scavenge ros and protect tissues from inflammation - induced damages.7,8 among them , superoxide dismutase ( sod ) catalyzes the dismutation of . o2 - to h2o2 .
subsequently , catalase catalyzes the reduction of h2o2 to water.9 though ros scavenging natural enzymes work efficiently to combat inflammation , they are sensitive to environmental conditions ( such as temperature and ph value ) and hard to mass - produce.10 therefore , intensive efforts have been made to develop ros scavenging artificial enzymes to overcome the inherent drawbacks of the natural enzymes.11,12 in last decades , catalytic nanomaterials with natural enzyme - like activities ( termed as nanozymes ) have been developed as emerging artificial enzymes.13 - 31 nanozymes have many advantages , such as excellent thermal and biological stability , multi - functionality , ease - of - preparation , and tunable activity.13,32 - 34 among these developed nanozymes , a variety of nanomaterials with ros scavenging activities have been reported.35 - 38 for instance , ceria nanoparticles ( ceo2 nps ) have been demonstrated to possess sod mimicking activities due to the mixed valance states of ce3 + and ce4 +. 35 nevertheless , the ros scavenging capability of most nanozymes is moderate .
therefore , numerous strategies have been proposed to design more active nanozymes .
one possible strategy is adding dopant ions ( such as zr4 +) into ceria nps to modulate the ratio of ce3 +/ ce4 +. 39 the superoxide scavenging activity of ceria nps could also be enhanced through an electron transfer strategy.40 on the other hand , pharmacokinetic studies revealed that natural mn sod is superior to cu / zn sod and fe sod for chronic diseases treatment,41 which inspires a long effort to synthesize mn based sod mimics.42 despite of the great promise , only a few mn - based nanozymes with antioxidant activities have been developed so far.43 - 45 a very recent study reported the antioxidant activities of flower - like manganese oxide nps and applied them for cellular protection in vitro.45 however , mn - based nanozymes have not been explored for in vivo anti - inflammation yet .
to fill this gap , here we demonstrated that mn3o4 nps synthesized via a hydrothermal method possessed remarkable sod mimicking activities , thanks to the double oxidation states of mn2 + and mn3 + .
thus , the mn3o4 nps could be used to eliminate . o2 - by the disproportionation of . o2 - into h2o2 and o2 .
besides , the mn3o4 nps were also capable to catalyze the elimination of h2o2 and scavenge . oh. notably , the ros scavenging capacity of mn3o4 nps was superior to ceo2 nps , which promoted us to further apply them to eliminate ros both in vitro and in vivo .
we showed that the mn3o4 nps not only exhibited excellent ros removal efficacy in vitro but also effectively protected live mice from ros - induced ear - inflammation in vivo .
results and discussion synthesis and characterization of mn3o4 nps the mn3o4 nps were synthesized by a hydrothermal method.46 tem and xrd techniques were employed to analyze the morphology and the phase composition of mn3o4 nps .
as presented in fig. 1a and s1a ,+ the mn3o4 nps were uniform polyhedrons with an average size of 7 - 8 nm. dynamic lighting scattering ( dls ) ( fig. s2 +) and zeta potential ( fig. s3 +) results of the newly - prepared and two - month stored mn3o4 nps demonstrated their good long - term storage stability .
the lattice shown in tem agreed well with d [ 101 ] = 0.492 nm , demonstrating highly crystalline nature of the as - prepared mn3o4 nps .
the xrd pattern of mn3o4 nps was shown in fig. 1b .
all the measured diffraction peaks matched well to the standard pattern of hausmannite mn3o4 [ jcpds card no .
24 - 0734 , i41 / amd ( 141 )] , confirming their highly crystalline nature .
as catalytic reactions happened on the surface of nps , the surface of mn3o4 nps was further characterized by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) ( fig. s4 +) .
mn 2p3 / 2 and 2p1 / 2 peaks were centered at 641.7 ev and 653.5 ev , respectively .
the area ratio ( i.e. , molar ratio ) of mn2 + and mn3 + was about 1 : 2 , which agreed well with the theoretical value. fig. 1 ( a ) tem image of mn3o4 nps .
( b ) powder x - ray diffraction pattern of mn3o4 nps ( the red lines at the bottom mark the reference pattern of hausmannite mn3o4 from the jcpds database , card no. 24 - 0734 ) .
sod mimicking activity of mn3o4 nps since . o2 - is one of the most destructive ros , scavenging . o2 - by mn3o4 nps was first investigated .
such . o2 - scavenging activity could be attributed to the sod mimicking activity of mn3o4 nps .
first , . o2 - was generated by the reaction of xanthine and xanthine oxidase .
then the ability of mn3o4 nps to scavenge . o2 - was characterized by a . o2 - specific probe hydroethidine ( he ) .
he could react with . o2 - to produce fluorescent ethidium , which emitted strong fluorescence centered at 610 nm ( fig. 2a , red line ) .
in the presence of mn3o4 nps , the fluorescent intensity was significantly reduced ( fig. 2a , blue line ) compared with the red line , which illustrated the efficient elimination of . o2 - by mn3o4 nps .
the sod - like catalytic activity of mn3o4 nps was dose - dependent , and the . o2 - scavenging efficiency reached almost 75 % when the concentration of mn3o4 nps was 20 mug ml - 1 .
this result was comparable with that using 1 u ml - 1 natural sod ( fig. 2b ) , indicating the excellent sod - like activity of mn3o4 nps .
besides , when compared with the most widely used sod mimicking ceo2 nanozymes ( fig. s1b +) , the mn3o4 nps exhibited 1.5 - fold enhancement than ceo2 nps under the same experimental condition ( fig. 2b ) .
moreover , mn3o4 nps showed better thermal stability than natural sod ( fig. s5 +) .
mn3o4 nps also possessed high sod mimicking activities over a broad temperature range ( from 20 to 60 degreesc ) , which has not been achieved for natural sod ( fig. s6 +) .
two - month stored mn3o4 nps showed almost the same sod mimicking activity as the newly - prepared nps ( fig. s7 +) .
in addition , the scavenging of . o2 - with mn3o4 nps was further confirmed by epr with 5,5 - dimethyl - 1 - pyridine n - oxide ( dmpo ) as a spin trap .
as shown in fig. s8 ,+ the dmpo /. ooh signal decreased with the increase of the concentration of mn3o4 nps , indicating the ability of mn3o4 nps to eliminate . o2 - . these results illuminated that the mn3o4 nps showed significant sod - like catalytic activity and high stability. fig. 2 ( a ) fluorescent spectra of he after reaction with x and xo , in the absence and presence of mn3o4 nps .
x for xanthine and xo for xanthine oxidase , respectively .
( b ) dependence between the elimination of . o2 - and concentrations of mn3o4 nps , ceo2 nps , and natural sod .
catalase mimicking activity of mn3o4 nps as h2o2 is the product of . o2 - , another important ros , the h2o2 elimination capacity of mn3o4 nps was also tested .
as shown in fig. 3a , terephthalic acid ( ta ) reacted with h2o2 to produce 2 - hydroxyterephthalic acid with a fluorescent peak at 425 nm. in the presence of mn3o4 nps , the fluorescent intensity significantly decreased , illustrating the h2o2 elimination activity ( i.e. , the catalase - like activity ) of mn3o4 nps .
the catalase - like of mn3o4 nps was concentration dependent , and about 75 % of h2o2 was eliminated by using 20 mug ml - 1 mn3o4 nps , which was even more efficient than that using 10 u ml - 1 catalase .
besides , mn3o4 nps also showed better thermal stability than natural catalase ( fig. s10 +) .
the h2o2 elimination capacity of mn3o4 nps was also higher than that of ceo2 nps ( fig. 3b ) .
in addition , the elimination of h2o2 with mn3o4 nps was also studied by monitoring the absorbance of h2o2 at 240 nm ( fig. s11 +) .
both the fluorescence and absorption spectra confirmed that mn3o4 nps could also eliminate h2o2 and possessed superior catalase mimicking property. fig. 3 ( a ) fluorescent spectra of ta after reaction with h2o2 , in the absence and presence of mn3o4 nps .
( b ) dependence between the elimination of h2o2 and concentrations of mn3o4 nps , ceo2 nps , and natural catalase .
hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps . oh is another important ros , therefore its scavenging would help to protect cells or live organisms from ros - induced damages more efficiently .
to check whether the mn3o4 nps could also eliminate . oh , both absorption and epr spectra were applied to detect . oh level in the presence of mn3o4 nps .
fenton reaction with the fe2 +/ h2o2 system was used to produce . oh. first , the generated . oh was detected by its specific probe salicylic acid ( sa ) .
as shown in fig. 4a , an obvious absorption peak at 510 nm was observed after mixing sa with fe2 +/ h2o2 .
the absorption intensity decreased significantly after adding mn3o4 nps , which proved the . oh scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps. fig. 4b showed that the elimination of . oh was enhanced with the increase of the nps concentration .
nearly 70 % elimination was achieved with 10 mug ml - 1 of mn3o4 nps .
we also compared mn3o4 nps with ceo2 nps , demonstrating the higher . oh scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps ( fig. 4b ) .
in addition , the . oh scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps was further confirmed by epr .
the signal of dmpo /. oh decreased with the increase of mn3o4 concentration , which was attributed to the scavenging of . oh ( fig. s12 +) .
all the above results clearly demonstrated the highly efficient ros scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps , which was better than the most widely used ceo2 nanozymes. fig. 4 ( a ) absorption spectra of sa after reaction with fe2 +/ h2o2 , in the absence and presence of mn3o4 nps .
sa alone , and sa reacted with fe2 + or h2o2 were used as control .
( b ) dependence between the elimination of . oh and concentration of mn3o4 nps and ceo2 nps ( mean +/ - s.d. , ** p < 0.05 ; n.s. , not significant ) .
intracellular ros scavenging detection after demonstrating the scavenging abilities of mn3o4 nps toward . o2 - , h2o2 , and . oh , the intracellular ros scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps was then investigated using hela cell line as a model .
first , the toxicity of mn3o4 nps was evaluated .
the mtt results showed that the mn3o4 nps exhibited no obvious cytotoxicity within the experimental conditions ( fig. 5a ) .
then the intracellular ros level was monitored using 2 ' , 7 ' - dichlorofluorescein diacetate ( dcfh - da ) as the fluorescent probe.47 as shown in fig. 5b , the treatment with rosup resulted in remarkable fluorescent enhancement by laser confocal fluorescence imaging , which corresponded to the increased ros level in the hela cells .
when the mn3o4 nps were added , the fluorescence decreased obviously. and the more nps were added , the more fluorescence decreased , which indicated the dose dependent intracellular ros scavenging activities of mn3o4 nps ( fig. 5b and c ). fig. 5 ( a ) hela cell viability under different concentrations of mn3o4 nps .

( c ) corresponding fluorescent intensity of dcfh - da in panel ( b ) .
in vivo anti - inflammation encouraged by the above cellular results , an ear inflammation model was established to evaluate the anti - inflammation activity of mn3o4 nps in vivo .
as displayed in fig. s13 ,+ the right ear of an experimental mouse appeared red and swollen after the topical application of phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( pma ) for 6 h , indicating a typical characteristic of inflammation .
in order to study the in vivo ros scavenging capability of mn3o4 nps , the inflamed ears were thereafter subcutaneously treated with mn3o4 nps at the dose of 0.5 mug kg - 1 and 1.25 mug kg - 1 for each mouse , respectively .
as demonstrated in fig. 6a and b , no obvious fluorescence was observed for mice after treatment with dcfh - da or pma only .
in contrast , a strong fluorescence was observed in the pma / dcfh - da - treated ear ( fig. 6c ) , which indicated the elevated level of ros due to the pma induced inflammation .
after treatment with mn3o4 nps , the fluorescence in the inflamed ear decreased obviously ( fig. 6d , e , and s14 +) .
hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) stained images of pma induced inflammation ear were also obtained .
as shown in fig. s15b ,+ lymphocytes infiltration was observed obviously compared with the healthy mouse ear ( fig. s15a +) .
after treatment with mn3o4 nps , the symptom was alleviated ( fig. s15c and d +) .
besides , as shown in fig. s16 ,+ h & e stained histology section of liver , spleen , and kidney demonstrated negligible toxicity of mn3o4 nps toward live tissues .
these results indicated that the mn3o4 nps possessed efficient ros scavenging capacity toward ear inflammation in live mice with safety. fig. 6 in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice with pma - induced ear inflammation after treatment with ( a ) pma , ( b ) dcfh - da , ( c ) pma and dcfh - da , ( d ) pma and dcfh - da with 0.5 mug kg - 1 mn3o4 nps , and ( e ) pma and dcfh - da with 1.25 mug kg - 1 mn3o4 nps .
conclusions in summary , we synthesized mn3o4 nanozymes with excellent ros scavenging activity .
due to the sod mimicking activity , they eliminated as much as nearly 75 % . o2 - , which was superior to ceo2 nps .
besides , the mn3o4 nps could also catalyze the elimination of another two important ros of h2o2 and . oh. in vitro experiments showed that the mn3o4 nps significantly scavenged intracellular ros .
due to their excellent antioxidant activities in vitro , an inflammation model was established to evaluate the ros scavenging ability of mn3o4 nps in vivo .
the mn3o4 nps efficiently relieved the pma - induced ear inflammation in live mice .

then the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml teflon - lined stainless steel autoclave for thermal treatment for 24 h at 120 degreesc .
the products were washed by deionized water for three times after cooling down to room temperature , and the dark - brown precipitate was obtained .
synthesis of ceo2 nps the ceo2 nps were synthesized according to our previous work.48 sod - like activity of mn3o4 nps the sod - like catalytic activity of mn3o4 nps was evaluated via two methods .
both of them monitored the amount of . o2 - scavenged .
the more . o2 - scavenged , the higher sod - like activity of mn3o4 nps was .
method one the amount of . o2 - scavenged was indirectly detected by measuring the fluorescent intensity of ethidium , which was the oxidation product of he by . o2 - . first , . o2 - was generated by mixing xanthine ( 0.6 mm ) and xanthine oxidase ( 0.05 u ml - 1 ) in phosphate buffer ( 0.1 m , ph 7.4 ) at 37 degreesc.49 after 40 min , the mn3o4 nps were added to the solution for another 40 min reaction , followed by adding he ( 0.5 mg ml - 1 ) .

method two epr was used to directly detect . o2 - scavenging .
the mn3o4 nps were added to the mixture of xanthine and xanthine oxidase to scavenge the generated . o2 - . dmpo ( 100 mm ) was employed to trap the unscavenged . o2 - by forming dmpo /. ooh .
dmso was also added to enhance the stability of spin adduct.50 catalase - like activity of mn3o4 nps the catalase - like activity of mn3o4 nps was evaluated by monitoring the catalytic elimination of h2o2 with mn3o4 nps using fluorescent and uv - visible absorption spectra .
fluorescent method h2o2 can decompose into . oh , which would react with ta to produce fluorescent 2 - hydroxyterephthalic acid with an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission peak at 425 nm.51 in the presence of catalase ( or catalase mimics ) , h2o2 would decompose into h2o and o2 and could not generate fluorescent 2 - hydroxyterephthalic acid .
therefore , by monitoring the fluorescent signal of 2 - hydroxyterephthalic acid , the elimination of h2o2 could be investigated .
after phosphate buffer ( 25 mm , ph 7.4 ) containing h2o2 ( 10 mm ) and different concentrations of mn3o4 nps was vortexed vigorously and incubated at room temperature for 6 h , ta in dmf ( 0.5 mm ) was added .
then the fluorescence of the mixture was measured .
absorption method the elimination of h2o2 was also detected by monitoring its characteristic absorbance at 240 nm using uv - visible absorption spectroscopy .
hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps the . oh was generated through fenton reaction of 1.8 mm feso4 and 5 mm h2o2 for 10 min .
two methods were applied to study the . oh scavenging activity of mn3o4 nps .
method one the amount of . oh scavenged was detected by measuring the characteristic absorbance of 2,3 - dihydroxybenzoic acid at 510 nm , which was produced by reacting sa ( 1.8 mm ) with . oh. method two the scavenging of . oh was also detected by using epr .
dmpo was used as a spin trap to form dmpo /. oh spin adduct , which yielded four characteristic lines with relative intensities of 1 : 2 : 2 : 1 .
cytotoxicity assay hela cells were refreshed in high glucose dmem culture medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( 10 000 u ml - 1 ) under the atmosphere of 5 % co2 at 37 degreesc .
for cell viability assay , hela cells were seeded into 96 - well plates with a density of 8 x 103 cells per well .

intracellular ros scavenging detection the intracellular level of ros was monitored by using non - fluorescent dcfh - da , which could penetrate through the cell membrane into cytosol and be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase into dcfh .
then dcfh reacted with intracellular free radicals to produce fluorescent product dcf with excitation and emission wavelength at 488 nm and 520 nm , respectively .
the whole procedure was performed as below : hela cells were first seeded into 24 - well plates and incubated for 24 h , followed by adding rosup ( 0.5 mg ml - 1 ) to produce intracellular ros .
after 30 min , the medium was refreshed three times and then mn3o4 nps with different concentrations were added for 1 h incubation .

after 6 h induction , the mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and subcutaneously injected with mn3o4 nps ( at a dose of 0.5 and 1.25 mug kg - 1 , respectively ) .
after 30 min incubation , 50 mul of dcfh - da ( 1 mm ) was injected in a similar way .
after another 30 min incubation , the whole body fluorescent images were recorded by a perkinelmer in vivo imaging system with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm. mice without treatment and treated with pma or dcfh - da only were used as control .

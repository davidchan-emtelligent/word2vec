the potential utilization of cyanobacteria for the biological production of alkanes represents an exceptional system for the next generation of biofuels .
here , we analyzed a diverse group of freshwater and marine cyanobacterial isolates from indian culture collections for their ability to produce both alkanes and alkenes .
among the 50 cyanobacterial isolates screened , 32 isolates ; 14 freshwater and 18 marine isolates ; produced predominantly alkanes .
the gc - ms / ms profiles revealed a higher percentage of pentadecane and heptadecane production for marine and freshwater strains , respectively .
oscillatoria species were found to be the highest producers of alkanes .
among the freshwater isolates , oscillatoria ccc305 produced the maximum alkane level with 0.43 mug / mg dry cell weight , while oscillatoria formosa bdu30603 was the highest producer among the marine isolates with 0.13 mug / mg dry cell weight .
culturing these strains under different media compositions showed that the alkane chain length was not influenced by the growth medium but was rather an inherent property of the strains .
analysis of the cellular fatty acid content indicated the presence of predominantly c16 chain length fatty acids in marine strains , while the proportion of c18 chain length fatty acids increased in the majority of freshwater strains .
these results correlated with alkane chain length specificity of marine and freshwater isolates indicating that alkane chain lengths may be primarily determined by the fatty acid synthesis pathway .
moreover , the phylogenetic analysis showed clustering of pentadecane - producing marine strains that was distinct from heptadecane - producing freshwater strains strongly suggesting a close association between alkane chain length and the cyanobacteria habitat .
cyanobacteria marine strain freshwater strain hydrocarbon profile fatty acid synthesis pathway phylogenetic analysis department of biotechnology , govt. of india introduction the increased carbon footprint and the rapidly depleting petroleum reserves have necessitated the development of responsible , environment - friendly alternatives with immediate impact ( timilsina , 2013 ) .
within this context , the biological production of alkanes , which can serve as drop - in fuels , offers a possible solution .
as major constituents of diesel , gasoline , and jet fuels along with their high - energy content and compatibility with the existing fossil fuel infrastructure , alkanes are ideal candidates in this regard ( speight , 1997 ) .
several prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms that naturally produce hydrocarbons have been reported in the literature ( coates et al. , 2014 ) .
the most prominent among these are the cyanobacteria ( winters et al. , 1969 ) , which produce both alkanes and alkenes using fatty acid precursors via two different pathways ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ; mendez - perez et al. , 2011 ) .
one pathway involves two terminal enzymes , acyl - acyl carrier protein reductase ( aar ) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase ( ado ) , which successively convert fatty acyl intermediates to alkanes ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ; li et al. , 2011 , 2012 ; zhang et al. , 2013 ). through another pathway , medium chain alkenes ( also known as alpha - olefins ) are produced via large multi - domain protein homologous to type i polyketide synthases ( pks ) .
here , the fatty acyl - acp is converted to an alpha - olefin via elongation - decarboxylation mechanism leading to odd - numbered carbon chain with the double bond at the alpha position ( mendez - perez et al. , 2011 ) .
there have been no cyanobacterial species described so far with genomes that harbor both these pathways ( coates et al. , 2014 ) .
however , it appears from the recent study that the aar / ado pathway is prevalent in alkane - producing cyanobacteria ( klahn et al. , 2014 ) .
in an earlier study , deletion of these two genes rendered cyanobacteria incapable of producing alkanes with no obvious impact on the growth of these cyanobacteria ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) .
this suggested that alkane production is not imperative for the survival of these cyanobacteria .
however , this observation also raised the question about the relevance of alkane production in cyanobacteria since even after considerable transcriptomic analysis of alkane - producing cyanobacteria under various growth conditions , there was no clear correlation between aar / ado expression and the environment ( hernandez - prieto and futschik , 2012 ; klahn et al. , 2014 ) .
moreover , since different chain length alkanes were observed in different cyanobacteria , it is difficult to predict whether the difference in chain length was due to the genetic factors or the diverse climatic condition in which they are naturally found ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) .
cyanobacteria are found in a variety of habitats ( cameron , 1962 ; miller and castenholz , 2000 ; garcia - pichel et al. , 2001 ) , with the most prominent ones being found in marine and freshwater environment ( reed et al. , 1984 ; nadeau and castenholz , 2000 ; martins et al. , 2011 ) .
several useful compounds from marine cyanobacteria and its commercial potential have been well documented ( bloch and tardieu - guigues , 2014 ) .
however , no systematic study has been reported comparing the alkane and / or alkene production capabilities of marine and freshwater cyanobacterial strains .
in this study , we selected cyanobacterial isolates from indian marine and freshwater habitats and screened them for the production of alkanes and alkenes .
we found that carbon chain lengths correlated well with the natural habitat of that cyanobacterium but not with the cultivation media used in the laboratory .
we further compared the intrinsic ability of cyanobacteria to produce different chain length fatty acids with the alkane chain length profile .
finally , we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rdna sequences of alkane - producing strains and show a distinct clustering of marine and freshwater cyanobacteria .
materials and methods collection and maintenance of cyanobacterial cultures source indian freshwater cyanobacterial isolates were procured from the national centre for culture collection and utilization of blue green algae , indian agriculture research institute ( iari ) , new delhi and marine cyanobacterial isolates from national facility for marine cyanobacteria ( nfmc ) , thiruchirapalli , india .
synechococcus elongatus pcc7942 and s. elongatus pcc7002 were obtained from pasteur culture collection of cyanobacteria , france .
culture medium and maintenance the freshwater strains were cultured in bg - 11 medium while the marine isolates were cultured in asn - iii medium ( rippka et al. , 1979 ) .
experimental cultures were incubated in identical condition at light intensity 49.5 +/ - 6.6 mumolm - 2s - 1 ; photoperiod 16:8 h ( light : dark ) ; temperature 25 - 30degreesc and ph 7.3 +/ - 0.1 with a salinity preference of 25 ppt in case of marine strains .
strain isolation strain isolation was achieved via antibiotic treatment and / or dilution plating ( sarchizian and ardelean , 2010 ) .
for antibiotic treatment , the cultures ( 20 ml each ) were incubated for 1 h at 25 - 30degreesc in bg - 11 or asn - iii medium containing 0.1x lb ( tryptone - 1 g / l , yeast extract - 0.5 g / l , nacl - 1 g / l ) , followed by the addition of antibiotics - penicillin g ( 100 mug / ml ) , streptomycin ( 50 mug / ml ) , chloramphenicol ( 10 mug / ml ) , and augmentin ( 100 mug / ml ) to each of the culture tubes .
the samples were incubated for 24 h in dark , washed with sterile water and then incubated in the respective medium ( without antibiotics ) in light for 24 h. for isolation via dilution plating , cyanobacterial strains were cultured in their respective medium until the log phase .
a small volume of each culture was withdrawn and subjected to washing with sterile water followed by washing with respective sterilized medium .
serial dilutions of the cultures were prepared ( dilutions up to 1000 times ) and plated on bg - 11 - agar / asn - iii - agar plates .
for both methods , strain purity was checked by growing the strains overnight in lb medium in dark .
growth curve of cyanobacteria the growth characteristics of alkane - producing cyanobacteria were analyzed in liquid culture .
equal amount of samples of freshwater and marine cyanobacterial cultures corresponding to a final concentration of 0.02 mg dry cell weight / ml were inoculated in their respective media in 50 ml volume for each time point and grown for 10 days under optimal growth conditions as mentioned in the previous section .
each 50 ml culture was harvested after an interval of 24 h ( up to the tenth day after inoculation ) and the samples were centrifuged and dried in the oven at 65degreesc .
multiple readings were taken during the incubation period until a constant weight was attained by all the samples ( figure s1 in supplementary material ) .
the dry weight of each of the samples was measured and normalized per milliliter of the culture .
strain cultivation was performed in triplicate and data plotted as an average .
the hydrocarbon estimation was performed for the cultures harvested from day 5 to 9 .
determination of the alkane and alkene content for alkane and alkene analysis , the strains were grown in 1 l culture in erlenmeyer flasks at 25 - 30degreesc for 8 days and the hydrocarbons were extracted and analyzed using the protocol modified from schirmer et al .
( 2010 ) .
briefly , the sample volume corresponding to 20 mg dry cell weight [ cells dried at 65degreesc until the weight was constant ( figure s1 in supplementary material )] was withdrawn from the culture , centrifuged for 1 min at 13,000 rpm , resuspended in methanol and sonicated using a sonics vibracell for 10 min at amplitude of 30 % and a pulse of 9.9 s on / off .
after centrifugation for 3 min at 13,000 rpm , the supernatants were transferred to fresh vials and analyzed on a 7890 a gas chromatography system equipped with a 7000 gc / ms triple quadrapole system ( agilent ) .
the hp - 5 capillary column ( 30 m length , 0.32 mm internal diameter , 0.25 mum film thickness ) was used for the separation of metabolites with following method parameters : 1 mul sample was injected ( splitless ) onto the gc - ms column with inlet temperature at 150degreesc , the oven was held at 100degreesc for 3 min .
the oven temperature was ramped up to 300degreesc at a rate of 20degreesc / min and was then held at 300degreesc for an additional 5 min .
the ms quadrupole scanned from 50 to 550 m / z. retention times and fragmentation patterns of product peaks were compared with authentic references to confirm peak identity .
the hydrocarbon concentrations were quantified through multiple reaction monitoring ( mrm ) mode based on commercial standards ( absolute standards ) .
determination of the fatty acid content for the analysis of the cellular fatty acid content , cyanobacterial cultures were harvested on day 8 .
cell pellets were dried in the oven at 65degreesc and then crushed using pestle and mortar ( ahmad et al. , 2012 ) .
the dried sample ( 100 mg ) was used for fatty acids extraction with chloroform and methanol and finally with hexane .
trans - esterification was done using 2 m potassium hydroxide in methanol .
the upper hexane layer was collected , filtered , and transferred to fresh vials for fatty acyl methyl ester ( fame ) analysis by gc / ms triple quadrapole system .
quantification of fame was carried out using the 7890 a gas chromatography system equipped with omega wax 250 column ( 30 m length , 0.25 mm internal diameter , 0.25 mum film thickness ) .
the following method parameters were employed : 1 mul sample was injected ( split ratio 1:10 ; inlet temperature held at 150degreesc ) onto the gc column , the oven was held at 140degreesc for 5 min .
the oven temperature was ramped up to 240degreesc at a rate of 4degreesc / min and was then held at 240degreesc for an additional 20 min .
supelco ( r ) 37 component fame mix ( sigma aldrich ) was used as standard to identify the retention times and fragmentation patterns of the product peaks and for quantification of the specific fame .
phylogenetic analysis genomic dna from the cyanobacterial host was isolated by the conventional hexadecyl - trimethyl - ammonium bromide ( ctab ) method ( zhang et al. , 2014 ) and was used as template to amplify the 16s rdna sequence with the help of universal primers 27f ( 5 ' - agagtttgatcmtggctcag - 3 ') and 1492r ( 5 ' - tacggytaccttgttacgactt - 3 ') .
the pcr product was analyzed on a 1 % agarose gel in the presence of ethidium bromide , purified using a gel extraction kit ( genetix ) and sequenced at macrogen inc .
the phylogenetic analysis of cyanobacterial strains was conducted in mega6 ( tamura et al. , 2013 ) with the help of 16s rdna sequences using the neighbor - joining method ( saitou and nei , 1987 ) .
the bootstrap analysis was performed employing 1000 bootstrap replications ( felsenstein , 1985 ) .
the evolutionary distances were computed using the p - distance method ( nei and kumar , 2000 ) .
results screening of freshwater and marine cyanobacteria for alkane and alkene production we obtained 21 freshwater and 29 marine cyanobacterial strains from iari and nfmc culture collections , respectively ( table 1 ) .
since most of these cultures were contaminated with bacteria , we initially attempted to isolate the cyanobacterial strains via antibiotic treatment .
however , many antibiotics interfered with the growth of cyanobacteria and , in a large number of cases , did not reduce the contamination .
we therefore resorted to serial dilution to isolate the cyanobacterial strains by transferring four to five times on agar plates .
the purity of the cyanobacterial culture was verified by growth on lb liquid medium , lb agar plate , and bright field microscopy .

bdu51781 spirulina subsalsa bdu30311 synechococcus elongatus bdu130192 synechocystis pevaleikii bdhku35101 after cultivation for 8 days , alkanes and / or alkenes were extracted from both the freshwater and marine strains cultivated in their respective liquid media and analyzed via gc - ms. s. elongatus pcc7942 was used as a positive control strain and s. elongatus pcc7002 was used as a negative control strain due to the presence and absence of the alkane - producing aar / ado pathway , respectively ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) .
a total of 32 cyanobacterial strains , which included 14 freshwater and 18 marine strains , were found to produce significant quantities of alkanes though alkenes were also detected ( table s1 in supplementary material ) .
we selected these strains and analyzed the chain lengths of the alkanes produced along with their quantification through mrm mode of triple quadrapole mass spectrometer .
the majority of these strains produced pentadecane and heptadecane ( figure 1 ) .
the freshwater and marine strains predominantly produced heptadecane and pentadecane , respectively , though a few marine stains also produced hexadecane .
oscillatoria strains were the highest producers of alkanes for both the freshwater and marine categories .
oscillatoria ccc305 produced a total alkane content of 0.43 mug / mg dry cell wt , which was three times higher than the amount produced by the best alkane - producing marine strain oscillatoria formosa bdu30603 ( 0.13 mug / mg dry cell wt ) , and more than five times higher than the amount produced by s. elongatus pcc7942 ( 0.083 mug / mg dry cell wt ) ( figure 1 ) .
the representative plots of the full gc - ms scan and the alkane / alkene quantitation of these strains through mrm are given in figure 2 and figure s2 in supplementary material , respectively .
phormidium sp. were the second highest alkane - producers for both freshwater and marine cyanobacteria. s. elongatus pcc7942 , a freshwater isolate , produced 0.022 mug / mg dry cell wt pentadecane and 0.0076 mug / mg dry cell wt heptadecane .
this was in stark contrast to the other freshwater strains , which predominantly produced heptadecane .
as expected , s. elongatus pcc7002 , which was used as a negative control strain , did not shows any alkane and / or alkene production .
growth curves were obtained for strains , which produced significant quantities of alkane in order to identify optimum levels of alkane production ( figure 3 ) .
for most of the strains , the exponential growth phase ranged from 2 to 8 days after which point the growth rate declined .
we analyzed alkane production between day 5 and 9 of growth .
the trend showed an increase in alkane production until day 8 for most of the strains and then reaching saturation ( figure 4 ) .

impact of cultivation media on hydrocarbon production based on our gc - ms / ms analyses , we observed that the majority of freshwater cyanobacterial strains produced heptadecane as the predominant alkane while marine strains produced pentadecane .
to investigate whether alkane chain length is associated with differences in composition of the cultivation media , we grew five ( highest alkane - producers ) of the freshwater strains in asn - iii medium , which has high - salt concentration and is generally used to grow marine strains , and five ( highest alkane - producers ) of the marine strains in bg - 11 medium , which has low - salt concentration and is commonly used for growing freshwater strains. s. elongatus pcc 7942 , classified as a freshwater strain ( as indicated on the culture collection website ) , served as the reference strain and was grown in the asn - iii medium .
all strains showed hampered growth due to change in cultivation medium ; nevertheless , they grew and attained reasonable biomass at 8 days of cultivation ( figure 5 ) .
upon gc - ms / ms analysis it was found that the freshwater strains predominantly produced heptadecane while the marine strains produced pentadecane , akin to the trend observed with standard cultivation medium ( figure 5 ) .
these findings were a clear indication that a change in the media composition from low - to high - salt concentration or vice versa had no major impact on the chain length of the alkanes produced .
figure 5 impact of growth medium on hydrocarbon profile of ( a ) freshwater and ( b ) marine cyanobacterial strains .
data represent average and sd of three independent experiments .
fatty acid distribution in cyanobacteria since environmental factor such as media composition did not contribute to differences in the hydrocarbon chain length in freshwater and marine cyanobacteria , we looked at the possible involvement of fatty acid synthesis pathway in determining the hydrocarbon chain length characteristics .
we extracted fatty acids from the major alkane - producing cyanobacterial strains , trans - esterified them and analyzed on gc - ms / ms , as mentioned in section " materials and methods. " we found that the marine strains consistently produced higher amount of c16 chain length fatty acid ( figure 6 ) , which is a precursor for the c15 chain length alkane ( pentadecane ) ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) , a characteristics for marine strains .
on the other hand , the relative proportion of c18 chain length fatty acids increased significantly in freshwater strains as compared to marine , thus explaining the presence of the higher c17 chain length ( heptadecane ) in these strains .
however , phormidium ccc495 produced a much higher quantity of c16 chain length fatty acids though the higher c17 chain length alkane ( heptadecane ) was still present ( figure 2a ) .
the positive control s. elongatus pcc7942 strain continued to show a higher level of c16 in concordance with higher production of pentadecane .
an intriguing observation was made with regards to the cellular fatty acid composition of both freshwater and marine cyanobacteria .
we found that unsaturated fatty acid contents were significantly higher ( figure s3 in supplementary material ) , which were not reflected in the low abundance of alkenes .
figure 6 fatty acid chain length profile of freshwater and marine cyanobacterial strains .
cellular fatty acids were extracted from cyanobacteria , trans - esterified to fatty acyl methyl ester ( fame ) and analyzed on gc - ms / ms. data represent average and sd of three independent experiments .
phylogenetic analysis of alkane - producing strains we selected the alkane - producing cyanobacterial strains and analyzed their phylogenetic properties by aligning the 16s rdna sequence via neighbor - joining method .
we found that all marine strains occupied one sub - branch while all freshwater strains occupied another sub - branch ( figure 7a ) .
the branching pattern concurred quite well with alkane chain length , where the pentadecane was associated with the marine sub - branch while heptadecane was associated with the freshwater sub - branch .
for this analysis , the 16s rdna sequences of five cyanobacterial strains reported to be hydrocarbon producers by schirmer et al .
( 2010 ) were included : nostoc pcc73102 , s. elongatus pcc6803 , s. elongatus pcc7942 , prochlorococcus ccmp1986 , and cyanothece atcc51142 .
the information available at the culture collection website indicated nostoc pcc73102 , s. elongatus pcc6803 , s. elongatus pcc7942 as freshwater strains , and prochlorococcus ccmp1986 and cyanothece atcc51142 as marine strains .
we noted that s. elongatus pcc7942 aligned along with pentadecane - producing strains that originated from the marine habitat ( figure 7b ). s. elongatus pcc6803 also clustered with pentadecane producers , though it was reported to be a heptadecane producer ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) .
others aligned in the clusters as expected from their habitat and carbon chain length characteristics .

discussion recent characterization of the alkane - producing aar / ado pathway in cyanobacteria opens up the possibility of producing alkanes within a commercial context using various synthetic biology tools .
cyanobacteria occupying different niches will quite likely have the ability to produce different kinds of hydrocarbon .
prominent among different niches are freshwater and marine habitats .
cyanobacteria from both these habitats have been reported to produce both alkanes and alkenes .
however , a detailed study on the characteristics of the alkanes and alkenes produced by the marine and freshwater cyanobacteria is not available .
given the richness of microbial diversity in india , we obtained freshwater and marine cyanobacterial strains from two indian culture collections and studied their alkane - producing capacities ( satyanarayana and johri , 2005 ) .
among the 50 strains , 32 ( 14 freshwater and 18 marine ) strains produced alkanes and to a lesser extent alkenes .
the freshwater strains predominantly produced heptadecane while marine strains predominantly produced pentadecane .
this unique observation has never been reported before .
furthermore , the lack of unsaturation at the alpha carbon position would suggest that the aar and ado pathway rather than the pks - type pathway serves as the main route toward alkane / alkene production , corroborating a previous report that a large number of cyanobacteria possess aar / ado pathway ( coates et al. , 2014 ) .
it is not really known what triggers alkane production in cyanobacteria .
some studies have indicated that environmental signals might be responsible but no clear conclusion has been drawn ( klahn et al. , 2014 ) .
it has previously been suggested that media composition , especially salt concentration , may play a role in conferring different alkane chain lengths in freshwater and marine strains .
in our case , altering the media composition for freshwater and marine strains had no major impact on the composition of the alkane profile .
we considered the metabolic characteristics of the cyanobacteria as another possible determining factor .
alkane production is thought to proceed primarily through the fatty acid synthesis ( fas ) pathway followed by reduction and a carbonyl group removal via aar and ado enzymes ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) .
it was observed previously that although the s. elongatus pcc6803 produced only heptadecane , the recombinant e. coli carrying aar and ado of s. elongatus pcc6803 produced a mixture of pentadecane and 8 - heptadecene ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) .
similarly , while s. elongatus pcc7942 has a preference for the production of pentadecane with some heptadecane in the ratio of ~ 3:1 ( figure 1 ) , the engineered e. coli expressing the aar and ado of this strain produced mainly pentadecane and 8 - heptadecene ( figure s4 in supplementary material ) ( schirmer et al. , 2010 ) .
these results indicated that perhaps aar and ado are not responsible for the variation in the chain length of the alkanes observed between freshwater and marine strains .
we further analyzed the properties of fatty acid synthesis pathway of freshwater and marine strains by analyzing the fatty acid content of the alkane - producing strains .
we found that all the marine strains predominantly produced c16 chain length ( figure 6 ) , which provides the rational for them being the predominant c15 chain alkane producer .
the relative proportion of c18 chain fatty acid increased in freshwater strains , again providing rational for predominantly c17 chain alkane production by these strains .
interestingly , both the fatty acid and hydrocarbon chain length of s. elongatus pcc7942 exhibit characteristics similar to that of marine species , though it is considered a freshwater species .
overall , these data strongly suggest that alkane chain length is strongly determined by the indigenous fatty acid synthesis pathway of the cyanobacterial strain .
previous study showed clustering of aar / ado genes along with a few genes of the fatty acid synthesis pathway , which may indicate a close association of fatty acid and alkane biosynthesis ( klahn et al. , 2014 ) .
however , we also observed that several fatty acids in these cyanobacteria were unsaturated though this did not correlate with accumulation of the respective alkenes .
the unsaturation events were perhaps introduced at a later stage by the known desaturase enzymes , the prominent one being cyanobacterial desa that introduces double bond at the delta position of fatty acid bound in membrane glycerolipids to provide cold tolerance ( wada et al. , 1990 ) .
it seems quite possible that alkane synthesis and hydrocarbon chain unsaturation may form diverging pathways from fatty acid synthesis .
since it was evident from the above observation that genetic factor determines the hydrocarbon chain length in the cyanobacterial strains , we therefore analyzed the phylogenetic properties of alkane - producing strains through alignment of their 16s rdna sequences .
clustering of pentadecane - producing marine cyanobacteria on one side of the evolutionary branch with heptadecane - producing freshwater strains clustering on another suggests that the alkane chain length perhaps evolved according to the natural habitat in which they lived ( figure 7a ) .
what significance this property holds for the cyanobacteria needs to be analyzed further .
we also gathered information from the literature regarding the hydrocarbon chain length , 16s rdna sequence , and the natural habitat of some of the alkane / alkene - producing cyanobacteria reported by schirmer et al .
( 2010 ) .
again , s. elongatus pcc7942 clustered along with other pentadecane producers from marine source ( figure 7b ) , though it is considered a freshwater strain within the literature. s. elongatus pcc6803 , which has been reported to be a heptadecane producer from freshwater source , surprisingly clustered well with pentadecane - producing marine strains .
it is tempting to hypothesize from the phylogenetic analysis that these strains might have evolved from the marine environment .
while pcc7942 still retains its pentadecane - producing ability , pcc6803 may possibly have switched to heptadecane production .
this hypothesis would require further investigation. with a few exceptions , our analysis does suggest that the majority of alkane - producing cyanobacterial strains cluster according to their niche area of habitation and alkane chain length .
in summary , we screened and identified cyanobacterial strains that produced more than fivefold higher alkane than the amount produced by previously reported s. elongatus pcc7942 .
we found that the freshwater strains and marine strains predominantly produced heptadecane and pentadecane , respectively , which correlated well with their phylogenetic clustering .
most importantly , the distinct alkane chain length between freshwater and marine strains is most probably attributed to the subtle differences in the metabolic characteristics of the fatty acid synthesis pathway .

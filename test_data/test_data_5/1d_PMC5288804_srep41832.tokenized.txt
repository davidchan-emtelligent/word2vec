this study was designed to investigate the potential of astragaloside iv ( asiv ) , an active ingredient of radix astragalus , to ameliorate colonic mucosal injury , with focusing on the implication of energy restoration in the underlying mechanism .
experimental colitis model was established in rats by injecting 2,4,6 - trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) through anus .
after 24 hours , asiv was administrated once daily by gavage for 6 days .
on day 1 and day 7 , colon tissue was collected for macroscopic and histological examination , elisa , western blot and immunohistochemical analysis .
tnbs impaired colonic mucosa with an injured epithelial architecture , increased inflammatory cell infiltration , and decreased colonic blood flow .
lgr5 positive cell number in crypt and beta - catenin nuclear translocation were down - regulated by tnbs treatment .
tnbs induced epithelial f - actin disruption and junctional protein degradation .
furthermore , adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) content and atp synthase subunit beta expression in the colon tissue were significantly decreased after tnbs stimulation .
all of the aforementioned alterations were relieved by asiv post - treatment .
the present study revealed that asiv promoted mucosal healing process in tnbs - induced colitis , which was most likely attributed to regulating energy metabolism .
inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , which includes ulcerative colitis ( uc ) and crohn 's disease ( cd ) , is an idiopathic disease characterized by chronic , relapsing inflammation and erosion as well as ulcer in the gastrointestinal tract with increased risk of developing colorectal cancer12 .
the pathophysiology and etiology of ibd have not been fully understood so far , though , repeated intestinal epithelial damage with disruption of mucosal barrier function has been recognized as one of the crucial pathogenic factor in ibd34 .
thus , regenerating epithelial architecture to restore the normal function of colon has become a standard treatment goal in the management of ibd in clinic56 .
a series of clinical studies have demonstrated that complete regeneration of the intestinal mucosa predicts long - term remission6 , while failure to achieve mucosal healing may predict a poor prognosis7 .
accordingly , development of drugs essential for promoting recovery of the impaired mucosal epithelium has received increasing attention .
the intestinal epithelium is one of the tissues that are most capable of self - renewal in the body , which is supported by proliferative resident intestinal stem cells ( isc ) .
isc are located close to the crypt base and produce vigorously proliferating progenitors called transit - amplifying cells , which continuously move upward as coherent columns to replace the died and shed epithelial cells8 .
however , in a variety of human diseases , including ibd as well as colon cancer , this renewal process is dysregulated and the homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium is disturbed .
researches have been conducted to restore the homeostasis of intestinal epithelium after injury910 , but none of them has been translated to clinic .
dysfunction of energy metabolism has been shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of ibd11 .
inflammation reaction , such as neutrophils infiltration and phagocytosis , increases the demand of energy .
on the other hand , inflammation - induced abnormal microvasculature causes a decreased supply of nutrient and oxygen that further aggravates the energy deficiency .
this energy deficiency contributes to the disruption of mucosal epithelium barrier found in ibd , which is regulated by interendothelial cell junctions and f - actin filaments , both of which need energy to maintain integrity121314 .
in addition , increasing evidence suggests that restoration of injured epithelium in ibd is an energy consuming process15 .
therefore , regulating energy metabolism is anticipated as a promising strategy for ibd therapy .
astragalosides iv ( asiv , fig. 1a ) is one of the major active ingredient of radix astragalus ( ra ) , a well - known chinese medicine with tonic property .
ra has been used to promote burn wound healing with efficiency .
previous study demonstrated that ra extracts boost healing of open cutaneous wounds by suppressing inflammation and stimulating basal cell growth16 .
ra saponins were found to be capable of stimulating re - epithelization and neovascularization in skin lesions171819 .
in addition , a recently study showed that vegf - and akt - dependent signaling pathways are involved in the pro - angiogenic effect of asiv20 .
our previous study has proved that huang - qi - jian - zhong pellet , a formula containing ra as a major component , accelerates the recovery of colonic injury in experimental colitis animals21 .
particularly , asiv was demonstrated to regulate myocardial adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) synthase activity by restoring atp synthase subunit delta ( atp5d ) expression after ischemia and reperfusion injury22 .
based on these data , we speculated that asiv may have a potential for mucosal healing in ibd with implication of energy regulation .
the present study was designed to test this speculation by using trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid ( tnbs ) - induced colitis model .
results asiv reduces tnbs - induced colitis in rats in a dose - and time - dependent manner we first evaluated the efficacy of asiv in coping with colitis in rats , which were challenged by tnbs for 24 hours followed by treatment with asiv for 6 days .
as shown in fig. 1b,c and supplement figure 1 , tnbs challenge for 24 hours evoked obvious damage in colon , including atrophy , hyperemia , edema , erosion and degeneration , which sustained until day 7 , though to a less extent , if without intervention .
strikingly , treatment with asiv at 10 mg / kg for 6 days promoted colitis recovery , exhibiting only a slight hyperemia and inflammation .
in addition , we found no significant effects of asiv on the mucosal damages at the dose of 5 mg / kg 7 days after tnbs stimulation , nor for asiv at 5 mg / kg or 10 mg / kg 4 days after tnbs stimulation ( supplement figure 1 ) , suggesting the improvement effects of asiv on tnbs - induced mucosal injury was dose - and time - dependent .
meanwhile , the animals in asiv only group did not show any change in colon , as compared with that in sham group ( fig. 1b and c ) .
histological evidence for the beneficial role of asiv in tnbs - induced colitis in rat observation by microscopy provided some details for the beneficial effect of asiv on colitis caused by tnbs .
figure 2a shows the images of he - staining colon tissue sections from different groups .
compared to sham and asiv alone group , an apparent injury was found in tnbs 1d group , including mucosal epithelial necrosis , hyperemia , edema , and inflammatory cell infiltration ( fig. 2a , a3 - c3 ) .
a similar , but less obvious , structural abnormalities in colonic mucosa was noticed in tnbs 7d group , with remained hyperemia , inflammation and microvascular occlusion in the submucosa ( fig. 2a , a4 - c4 ) .
as expected , tnbs - induced alterations in rat colonic mucosa were significantly restored by treatment with asiv , as evidenced by regeneration of crypt and villus integrity , increased vascular density and deceased erosion ( fig. 2a , a5 - c5 ) .
these results were confirmed by a quantitative assessment of the morphological manifestation ( fig. 2b ) .
immunohistochemistry of colon tissue was conducted for assessment of mpo and cd68 , which are the biomarker of infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes , respectively .
as shown in supplement figure 2a,b and c , the mpo expression was significantly elevated in tnbs 1d group , which became reduced in tnbs 7d group .
while cd68 expression increased with time .
asiv administration for 6 days relieved the tnbs - caused expression of both mpo and cd68 .
asiv promotes epithelium reconstitution in tnbs - treated rat colon immunohistochemistry was conducted to assess the expression of ki67 in colon epithelium ( supplement figure 3a and b ) .
compared with sham and asiv alone group , less ki67 - positive cells were found in tnbs 1d group .
the number of ki67 - positive cells increased in tnbs 7d group , implying a spontaneous recovery of the injured epithelium .
asiv administration resulted in a further increase in ki67 positive cells .
western blot analysis showed that the expression of e - cadherin , a marker of epithelial cells , decreased in tnbs 1d group , but became recovered in tnbs 7d group ( supplement figure 3c ) , which was significantly accelerated by asiv treatment .
asiv increases the blood flow in tnbs - induced rat colon as a source of oxygen and nutrient , blood flow plays a critical role in inflammation and injury recovery .
thus , blood flow in colon was determined by laser doppler perfusion in different groups , and the representative images and quantitative results are shown in fig. 3a and b , respectively .
as expected , the mucosal blood flow in tnbs 1d group showed a dramatic reduction compared with sham group , which , albeit recovered to some extent , was still much lower in tnbs 7d group than sham and asiv alone group .
impressively , asiv administration for 6 days significantly improved the mucosal blood flow compared to the tnbs 7d group .
asiv increases intestinal stem cell number in mucosal crypt of tnbs - stimulated rat colon the intestine epithelium has a considerable capacity to repair after damage , mainly depending on its continuous replenishment fueled by resident stem cells , which reside at the crypt base and give rise to all the differentiated cell types .
immunohistochemistry was performed in the present study to assess the expression of lgr5 , a biomarker of stem cells23 , in different groups .
the results demonstrated that under normal circumstances , the positive staining of lgr5 at the crypt base was obvious ( fig. 4a , a1 , b1 , a2 , b2 ) .
on the contrary , lgr5 staining decreased remarkably in tnbs 1d group ( fig. 4a , a3 , b3 ) , which recovered to some degree in tnbs 7d group , though , but was still lower than sham and asiv alone group ( fig. 4a , a4 , b4 ) .
excitingly , lgr5 staining in asiv treatment group increased to a level close to normal ( fig. 4a , a5 , b5 and b ) .
consistent with this result , western blot analysis showed that tnbs induced a significant reduction of lgr5 expression in colon tissue , which was ameliorated by asiv treatment ( fig. 4c ) .
as lgr5 is a wnt target gene24 , we next examined the changes of the key molecule in the wnt signaling pathway after tnbs stimulation and asiv administration .
the expression and nuclear translocation of beta - catenin , a key downstream transcriptional factor of wnt in regulating lgr5 expression , varied among groups in a similar manner ( fig. 5a and b ) .
these data suggested that asiv stimulated intestinal stem cell driving epithelium regeneration , which might be correlated with its stimulation of beta - catenin nuclear translocation .
asiv ameliorates tnbs - induced actin filaments disruption and tight junction protein degradation epithelial barrier integrity is of pivotal impotence for normal function of intestine , which is regulated by intercellular junctions and disrupts in ibd .
to assess the role of asiv in restoring the disrupted epithelial barrier in tnbs - induced colitis , an immunofluorescence staining of two tight junction protein , occludin and claudin - 5 , in mucosal epithelium was performed in the present study for different groups .
in sham and asiv alone group , both occludin ( fig. 6a , a1 , b1 and a2 , b2 ) and claudin - 5 ( fig. 6b , a1 , b1 and a2 , b2 ) in the mucosal epithelium were abundant and well - organized .
however , expression of occludin ( fig. 6a , a3 , b3 ) and claudin - 5 ( fig. 6b , a3 , b3 ) in epithelial cells revealed a noticeable decrease in tnbs 1d group .
in tnbs 7d group , the expression of occludin ( fig. 6a , a3 , b3 ) and claudin - 5 ( fig. 6b , a3 , b3 ) increased as compared to that in tnbs 1d group , while the distribution was disordered ( fig. 6a , a4 , b4 ; and b , a4 , b4 ) .
interestingly , asiv treatment for 6 day significantly promoted the recovery of occludin and claudin - 5 in epithelial cells ( fig. 6a , a5 , b5 ; and b , a5 , b5 ) .
actin cytoskeleton is known to interact with the tight junction and modulate tight junction permeability .
we then examined the f - actin structure in the epithelium from various groups .
the representative confocal microscopic images are displayed in fig. 7 , wherein sham and asiv alone group revealed a normal f - actin structure , while a dramatic disruption of actin filaments was observed 1 day or 7 days after tnbs stimulation ( fig. 7 , a3 , b3 and a4 , b4 ) .
in contrast , this actin depolymerization was protected evidently by treatment with asiv for 6 days ( fig. 7 , a5 , b5 ) .
asiv regulates colonic energy status as atp is indispensable for maintaining the integrity of actin filament and intercellular junctions , as well as necessary for the recovery of injured epithelium , the atp , adp and amp content was thus analyzed in the present study by elisa .
as shown in fig. 8a,b and c , compared with sham and asiv alone group , a significant decrease was observed in atp content , the ratio of atp / adp and atp / amp 1 day and 7 days after tnbs stimulation .
this tnbs - induced decrease was restored significantly by treatment with asiv .
to gain insight into the mechanism thereby asiv upregulated atp synthesis , we next determined the expression of atp synthase catalytic subunit ( atp synthase subunit beta ) , the key atp synthase subunit , in each group by western blot .
the result showed that the expression of atp synthase subunit beta in tnbs - induced rat colitis decreased significantly on day 1 and day 7 , which was significantly ameliorated by asiv treatment ( fig. 8d ) .
these data suggested that asiv improved colonic energy metabolism via upregulation of atp synthase subunit beta .
discussion tnbs is widely used as a stimulus to establish animal model for ibd .
consistent with others , we observed in the present study an obvious injury in colon tissue 1 day after tnbs challenge manifesting mucosal epithelium damage , inflammatory cell infiltration and reduced colon blood flow. of notice , all the insults became less prominent 7 days after tnbs administration , implying the presence of a spontaneous recovery process .
interestingly , treatment with asiv for 6 days significantly accelerated this recovery process leading to a much better outcome .
these results provided evidence for the potential of asiv in coping with ibd .
the result of the present study suggested that the colon tissue has a mechanism to repair the injured epithelium .
in the present setting , it is not known how far this recovery process can move forward without intervention .
nevertheless , asiv treatment significantly enhanced the repair progressing .
the capacity of asiv to aid in promotion of epithelium regeneration has been suggested by the researches of radix astragalus , the herb that contains asiv as an ingredient , which has been shown to stimulate re - epithelization and used for healing of cutaneous wounds or ulcers .
the result of the present study indicated that it is the asiv in radix astragalus that is responsible for the potential of this herb in this respect .
two processes may contribute to the repair of injured epithelium .
one is the proliferation of the matured epithelial cells .
the other is the differentiation of resident stem cell population in the crypt , which normally continuously renews the epithelial cells lining the colon mucosal surface .
the results of the present study revealed that both processes were dysregulated after tnbs stimulation , as evidenced by the decrease in ki67 staining of mucosal epithelium and the expression of lgr5 and beta - catenin , in which ki67 represents epithelial cells undergoing proliferation , while lgr5 is a biomarker of stem cell the expression of which is regulated by beta - catenin nuclear translocation24 .
noticeably , asiv treatment boosted the proliferation of epithelial cells as well as increased the number of stem cells .
the mechanism thereby asiv modulated the proliferation of epithelial cells and of stem cells is at present unknown .
however , the fact that asiv interfered in both events implies that asiv may act some target that governs both processes .
a likely candidate for this target is atp synthase .
the importance of atp synthase and atp in regulation of cell proliferation has been noticed previously in some studies .
it was reported that atp controls cell cycle and induces cell proliferation by promoting late developing progenitors to progress from g1 to s phase of cell cycle25 .
barbosa and colleges demonstrated that atp regulates differentiation of hematopoietic stem cell26 .
a resent publication showed that atp synthase promotes germ cell differentiation independent of oxidative phosphorylation27 .
it is thus predicated that a normally functioning atp synthase and improved atp supply may help restore the injured mucosal epithelium in ibd .
furthermore , an improved energy metabolism is needed as well for maintaining mucosal epithelium barrier , particularly the integrity of f - actin and junctions proteins , the major determinants of epithelium barrier , which has critical role in the function of colonic mucosa .
on the other hand , we have previously showed the ability of asiv to restore atp synthase activity in myocardium after ischemia and reperfusion22 .
these data , together with the finding in the present study that asiv treatment elevated the atp level and increased the expression of atp synthase subunit beta , meanwhile , prevented f - actin depolymerization and tight junction protein downregulation , highly suggest atp synthase as the target for asiv action .
asiv relieves the decreased atp synthase subunit improving atp supply , which suggests that asiv attenuates the impaired atp synthase subunit by impacting on some link upstream atp synthase .
nevertheless , the mechanism for the beneficial role of asiv requires further study .
in conclusion , the present study demonstrated that asiv has a therapeutic effect on colonic mucosal injury , accelerating epithelial cell proliferation , provoking stem cell growth , and restoring the mucosal barrier relevant proteins , which is most likely attributable to its potential to attenuate the impaired atp synthase .
these data provide an alternative option for the development of new medications for patients with ibd by restoring energy supply to promote mucosal injury recovery .

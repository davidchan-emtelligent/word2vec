ultrasonic wave - sensing technology has been applied for the health monitoring of composite structures , using normal fiber bragg grating ( fbg ) sensors with a high - speed wavelength interrogation system of arrayed waveguide grating ( awg ) filters ; however , researchers are required to average thousands of repeated measurements to distinguish significant signals .
to resolve this bottleneck problem , this study established a signal - processing strategy that improves the signal - to - noise ratio for the one - time measured signal of ultrasonic waves , by application of parallel factor analysis ( parafac ) technology that produces unique multiway decomposition without additional orthogonal or independent constraints. through bandpass processing of the awg filter and complex wavelet transforms , ultrasonic wave signals are preprocessed as time , phase , and frequency profiles , and then decomposed into a series of conceptual three - way atoms by parafac .
while an ultrasonic wave results in a bragg wavelength shift , antiphase fluctuations can be observed at two adjacent awg ports .
thereby , concentrating on antiphase features among the three - way atoms , a fitting atom can be chosen and then restored to three - way profiles as a final result .
an experimental study has revealed that the final result is consistent with the conventional 1024 - data averaging signal , and relative error evaluation has indicated that the signal - to - noise ratio of ultrasonic waves can be significantly improved .
fiber bragg grating parallel factor analysis signal - to - noise ratio ultrasonic wave 1 .
introduction fiber bragg grating ( fbg ) sensors used in structural health monitoring have been studied extensively in terms of their long - term structural operation and safety [ 1,2 ] .
an fbg is a kind of distributed bragg reflector that reflects light of a particular wavelength .
because of their small size , passive nature , immunity to electromagnetic interference , and ability to directly measure physical parameters such as temperature and strain , fbg sensors have become an important sensing technology even in harsh environments [ 3 ] .
meanwhile , an arrayed waveguide grating ( awg ) filter has been applied in a high - speed optical - wavelength interrogation system to speedily reflect wavelength shifts of the fbg and lame waves detected employing this system [ 4 ] .
the solid state and low energy of the awg means that the system can be compact and cost effective .
additionally , the awg filter has been applied as a demultiplexer to precisely interrogate wavelength shifts of multiple fbg sensors [ 5 ] .
as a monitoring system , the normal fbg sensor with awg filter has been used to inspect ultrasonic wave signals in the damage detection of composite materials [ 6 ] .
however , the received waveform is always affected by noise from light sources .
in the conventional method , thousands of measurements have to be made under the same condition , and the data averaged to remove noise [ 7,8 ] .
therefore , the system can only be applied in limited situations and is difficult to apply to passive acoustic emission investigations .
recently , a phase - shifted fbg , connected with a tunable laser source , was developed to sensitively detect an ultrasonic signal [ 9,10 ] .
however , it remains necessary to develop effective measures of resolving the described bottleneck problem of multiple measurements for the normal fbg sensor system .
related to the application of a signal processing method to improve measuring accuracy of fbg sensors , a correlation signal processing was applied for multimode fbg sensors to improve measuring accuracy for strain and temperature applications [ 11 ] .
a fairly linear characteristic had been obtained for tensile strain , but the temperature characteristic was somewhat nonlinear .
in a parallel demodulation of extrinsic fabry - perot interferometer and fbg systems , a signal processing algorithm was proposed by the combination of a fourier transform spectrum and low - coherence interference to reduce the measurement errors [ 12 ] .
additionally , as a digital filter , finite and infinite impulse response algorithms were used to improve the wavelength detection accuracy introduced by the applied strain on the fbg sensors [ 13 ] .
however , the above three references did not discuss the signal - to - noise ratio in detail , even though the signal - to - noise ratio is one of the most important indexes for a signal processing method. with thorough research , up to now , we could not find any published literature about a signal processing method for ultrasonic wave sensing by application of the fbg system , other than the 1024 - data averaging method .
as a principal component analysis in psychometrics , parallel factor analysis ( parafac ) was developed for unique multiway decomposition without additional orthogonality or independence constraints [ 14 ] .
in chemometrics , parafac has been extensively studied for the analysis of variance , the unique decomposition of sparse fluorescence , and the prediction of amino - n in sugar samples from fluorescence [ 15 ] .
the parafac model , known as one of the most adequate , robust , and interpretable multiway methods , is suitable for the batch processing of multi - channel signals and multi - dimensional analyses .
the model is receiving interest in the scientific and engineering fields for the analysis of large - scale , arrayed , mixed , or partially missing data requiring increasing computational complexity .
in electrophysiology , parafac has been used to decompose the time - variant spectrum of multichannel electroencephalographic recordings into a series of space - time - frequency components , and thus to search for alpha , beta , and theta activities in a given spectral profile [ 16,17 ] .
the same method has been applied to reveal significant correlations in electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging results [ 18 ] .
as a timely application in engineering , parafac decomposition was adopted for vibration modal analysis of a supported beam in acquiring the natural frequency and modal shape through numerical simulation [ 19 ] .
for blind speech separation , a parafac - based frequency - domain technique was developed to improve the signal - to - interference ratio , and a low - complexity adaptive algorithm is suited to the under - determined environment in which there are more speakers than microphones [ 20 ] .
moreover , recent studies in civil engineering revealed that parafac analysis can be applied to the three - way analysis of structural health monitoring data , blind modal identification of damped systems , and ambient modal identification of a stress - ribbon bridge [ 21,22,23 ] .
the experimental results also indicated that the parafac model is a preferable denosing method to analyze a hyperspectral image , and a jointly filtering wavelet component tensor was further developed [ 24,25 ] .
there have , however , been few studies on the application of the parafac model to the signals of optical fiber sensors .
a preliminary work was presented in [ 26 ] , and the present study furthers the work by evaluation of the feasibility of parafac decomposition for the detection of ultrasonic wave signals using optical fiber sensors .
in particular , this study continues the development of an integrated signal - processing strategy to improve the signal - to - noise ratio of ultrasonic wave signals , and a comprehensive discussion of the performance of the parafac method is presented for different application conditions .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
ultrasonic wave - sensing system the experimental system was an ultrasonic wave - sensing system mainly comprising a function generator , an amplifier , a macro fiber composite ( mfc ) actuator , two fbg sensors , and a high - speed optical wavelength interrogation system with an arrayed waveguide grating ( awg ) filter , and a digital oscilloscope .
a schematic diagram of the ultrasonic wave sensing system is presented in figure 1 .
an input wave signal generated by the function generator is amplified and sent to the mfc actuator .
the mfc actuator used to excite ultrasonic waves is a flexible actuator consisting of thin rectangular piezoceramic fibers sandwiched between layers of an epoxy adhesive and a polyimide film with an electrode pattern [ 27 ] .
the mfc actuator is bonded to the carbon - fiber - reinforced plastic laminate with an epoxy adhesive .
figure 1 schematic diagram of the ultrasonic wave sensing system .
the fbg sensors glued on the surface of the laminate receive propagating ultrasonic waves .
the fbg sensors are fabricated in an optical fiber that has a refractive index that varies periodically along a certain length of the core .
when broadband light is injected into the core , the fbg reflects a narrow spectral component at a bragg wavelength that is proportional to the strain generated by the propagation of ultrasonic waves .
the awg filter is a kind of planar lightwave circuit that consists of an array of narrow bandpass filters .
the signal at each port of the awg filter is detected by a photodetector , and each pair of adjacent - port signals is processed as a ratio output .
when the light reflected from the fbg enters the arrayed filters , the reflection spectrum passes through two adjacent filters .
the optical power is then modulated to the ports of the filters , depending on the central reflection wavelength .
since the optical powers can be directly converted into an electrical signal by photodetectors , the awg filter can detect the bragg wavelength shift accompanying the high - speed strain changes .
in this study , two pairs of adjacent ports of the awg filter are adopted to reflect the wavelength shift from the two fbg sensors .
as shown in figure 2 , when the bragg wavelength of the fbg shifts upon the arrival of an ultrasonic wave , the areas of superposition of the reflection spectrum fluctuate between two adjacent ports of the awg filter .
in this situation , the area of superposition will increase for the port on one side and decrease for the port on the opposite side .
simply put , a significant ultrasonic wave can produce antiphase outputs for two adjacent ports of the awg filter .
figure 2 variation of the reflection spectrum between two ports of the awg filter .
it can be imagined that the measured signal always contains noise from light sources and measuring instruments .
on the basis of the hypothesis that noise from light sources interfuses into all ports without a phase difference and that noise from measuring instruments independently interfuses into each port , neither type of noise can result in an antiphase phenomenon .
therefore , a significant signal can be distinguished employing the antiphase feature .
2.2 .
proposal figure 3 is a flowchart of the proposed method for the processing of one - time - measured ultrasonic signals .
the mfc actuator emits ultrasonic waveforms that are detected by two fbg sensors and transferred to the four ports of the awg filter .
the time history and phase data are then preprocessed by a complex wavelet transform to add frequency data .
afterward , the three - way data are decomposed to multiple trilinear components of temporal , phase , and frequency profiles. through antiphase feature selection , the target component is restored to the three - way data to give the final result .
figure 3 flowchart of the proposed method .
2.3 .
signal processing wavelet transformations are conducted firstly for temporal data to produce frequency data .
adding relative phase data between adjacent ports of the awg , temporal data can be converted to a three - way time - varying spectrum array .
when s ( t ) is considered as the data from each port of the awg , the wavelet transform is defined as ( 1 ) ca,b = integral - infinityinfinitys ( t ) 1apsi ( t - ba ) dtwhere a , b , and psi ( t ) are the frequency scale , time position , and mother wavelet , respectively [ 28 ] .
in this report , a complex morlet mother function consisting of a sinusoid and cosine is used and defined as ( 2 ) psi ( x )= 1pifbexp ( - t2 / fb ) exp ( i 2pi fct ) where fb is the bandwidth parameter and fc is the center frequency .
for fb = 1.5 and fc = 1 , when the sample time is dt , the relation between the frequency f and scale a is found to be ( 3 ) f = 1a dt from the transformed data , the three - way data array s ( nf x nt x np ) can be constructed , where nf , nt , and np are the numbers of frequency , time , and channel points , respectively .
when the wavelet transform of channel p at frequency f and time t is denoted by cf,t,p , the element of s , which is represented by sftp , is given by ( 4 ) sftp = re [ cf,t,p ] parafac decomposition is sequentially conducted for the three - way array sftp , which is obtained from the ports of the awg filter through wavelet transformation , and can be indicated by the temporal , phase , and frequency data array .
a four - component parafac model is graphically illustrated in figure 4 .
figure 4 graphical representation of a four - component parafac model .
the three - way parafac decomposition can be characterized by the following generative model ( 5 ) sftp = sumk = 1nafkbtkcpk + epsilonftpwhere afk , btk , and cpk represent the elements of the vectors of ak , bk , and ck , respectively .
thereby , the three - way data array sftp is decomposed into a sum of atoms , where the kth atom is the trilinear product of the vectors of ak , bk , and ck , representing frequency , phase , and time signatures , respectively .
epsilonftp is the residual that is related to an associated sum - of - squares loss , and the sum - of - squares of the residual array ( i.e. , || epsilonftp || 2 ) is minimized to find the n components ( ak , bk , and ck ) by using an iterative alternating least squares approach .
within this model , any solution to equation ( 5 ) is a maximum likelihood solution under the assumptions of gaussian noise [ 29 ] .
one important problem is to find the appropriate number of atoms k when the parafac is applied to data decomposition .
a typical approach is to use the core consistency diagnostic , which is known as a simple but powerful tool for finding the appropriate number [ 30 ] .
the core consistency is defined as ( 6 ) core consistency = 1 - sumf = 1nf sumt = 1ntsump = 1np ( sftp - tftp ) 2sumf = 1nf sumt = 1ntsump = 1np ( tftp ) 2 where tftp is the element of the rank - one tucker model , defined as the equivalent form of a restricted tucker3 model [ 31 ] .
when the number of components is appropriate , the core consistency remains around 100 % .
however , if the core consistency drops noticeably below 100 % , it is necessary to reduce the number of atoms in obtaining the appropriate model .
accordingly , the number of components should be chosen according to the core consistency value being close to 100 % .
dependent on the characteristics of frequency , temporal , and phase profiles , the correlation between the input and decomposed atoms can be analyzed to find the target atom with which to deduce the analysis result .
furthermore , the decomposed atom can be restored to three - way data as a parafac - based analysis result .
for example , if the jth atom is treated as the target atom , its element of the three - way data , s'ftp , can be expressed by the trilinear product of frequency , temporal , and phase profiles as ( 7 ) s'ftp = arfjbrtjcrpj + i.aifjbitjcipjwhere arf , brt , and crp are the real parts of the frequency , time , and phase profiles , and aif , bit , and cip the imaginary parts of the frequency , time , and phase profiles , respectively .
the real and imaginary parts can be obtained from the wavelet transformation .
2.4 .
relative error as a traditional method , 1024 - time measurements made using the fbg are averaged for the noise reduction ; the result is referred to as the 1024 - time averaged signal .
in this study , parafac decomposition is applied to improve the signal - to - noise ratio for the one - time measured signal of the fbg .
therefore , relative errors for one - time measured and restored signals are applied to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the proposed method .
the relative measuring error , errm , representing the difference between the results of the one - time measured signal and the 1024 - time averaged signal , is defined as ( 8 ) errm = sumf = 1nfsumt = 1ntsump = 1np | sftpo - sftpa | sumf = 1nfsumt = 1ntsump = 1np | sftpa | where sdegreesftp and saftp are the elements of the results of the one - time measured signal and the 1024 - time averaged signal , respectively .
nf , nt , and np are the numbers of the frequency , time , and phase points , respectively .
the relative analysis error , errp , representing the difference between the results of the one - time restored signal obtained by parafac processing and the 1024 - time averaged signal , is defined as ( 9 ) errp = sumf = 1nfsumt = 1ntsump = 1np | s'ftp - sftpa | sumf = 1nfsumt = 1ntsump = 1np | sftpa | where s'ftp is the element of the results of the one - time restored signal .
3. results and discussions 3.1 .

the time histories of the one - time measuring signal are shown in figure 6a and those of the 1024 - data averaging signal are shown in figure 6b , for the ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 .
this study applied an arrayed waveguide grating ( awg ) to reflect the wavelength shift from the two fbg sensors ( see figure 1 ) .
the awg consists of 40 ports that are arranged in the sequence of the central wavelength , and pairs of adjacent ports from the 40 ports of the awg can be applied for one fbg sensor .
therefore , for the convenience of distinction in this study , the adjacent ports for the fbg sensor a were defined as the ports of a1 and a2 , and b1 and b2 for the other fbg sensor b. a bandpass filter ranging from 100 to 500 khz was used for both signals .
under the assumption that the ultrasonic wave signal can be clearly distinguished by employing the 1024 - data averaging method , the 1024 - data averaging signal was applied as a standard reference in this study .
for the one - time measuring signal , the target signals are buried since the amplitude of fluctuation is smaller than the noise .
the one - time measuring signal is broadband ; therefore , frequency - based filtering is not effective for signal detection .
because the two fbg sensors were placed at the same position , the four awg ports should be in anti - phase to each other .
table 1 gives the correlation between signals of ports of the awg filter , which are processed employing the averaging method and normalization .
the correlation coefficient is positive for the signals of ports a1 and b1 , but negative for the signals of ports a1 and port a2 or port b2 .
this means that port a1 is in anti - phase with ports a2 and b2 .
the same result is confirmed for the signals of the other ports .

parafac decomposition to decide the appropriate number of components , the core consistency was calculated using equation ( 6 ) , after complex wavelet transforms were processed for the one - time measuring signal .
for the different numbers of atoms , the results of the core consistency are presented in figure 7 .
when there were five atoms , the core consistency values dropped to 89.2 % and 87.0 % for the real and imaginary parts , respectively .
therefore , there should be four components , for which the core consistency values are closed to 100 % .
after complex wavelet transformation , the one - time measured signal is decomposed by parafac .

the normalized values show the peak frequencies are 449 , 289 , 179 , and 128 khz for arf1 , arf2 , arf3 , and arf4 of the real part , respectively , and the peak frequencies are 446 , 289 , 179 , and 125 khz for aif1 , aif2 , aif3 , and aif4 of the imaginary part , respectively .
the temporal profiles for the real and imaginary parts are presented in figure 9a,b , respectively .
art and ait are the time variations of atoms , and the index numbers are the order of the decomposed atoms .
the phase profiles for the real and imaginary parts are presented in figure 10a,b , respectively .
arp and aip are the relative phases of the awg ports , and the index numbers are the order of the decomposed atoms .
when the reflected wavelength of the fbg fluctuates between the two adjacent awg ports , the phases of the outputs of the awg ports are opposite .
thereby , the signs of the relative phase of the awg ports should be [+ - + - ] or [ - + - +] .
in figure 10 , the elements of crp3 and cip3 have the same array of signs as [+ - + - ] , and thereby , the two elements can be selected as the target atoms with which to deduce significant signals .

parafac can decompose three - way data into the sum of atoms , and each atom can be restored to three - way data separately. through correlation analysis and feature selection , the target atoms can be restored as significant signals and the other atoms then removed .
when the maximum input amplitude is 58 muepsilon , the input period 45 mus , and the input frequency 200 khz , the wavelet transforms at awg ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 for the one - time measured signal ( left ) , one - time restored signal ( middle ) , and 1024 - time averaged signal ( right ) are presented in figure 11 , respectively .
for all ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 , compared with the 1024 - time averaged signal , it is apparent that the one - time measured signals contain much noise .
however , the wavelet transforms for the one - time restored signal are clearly around 200 hz , and the frequency distributions are highly consistent with the results for the 1024 - time averaged signal , especially at ports a1 and a2 .

relative error evaluation 3.3.1 .
input signal amplitude in considering whether the proposed method can notably improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the one - time measured signal , it is necessary to discuss its applicability under different conditions .
therefore , in this study , an experiment was also carried out for different maximum input signal amplitudes , analysis periods , and input signal frequencies .
moreover , relative measurement and analysis errors are assessed according to equations ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) .
the effectiveness of the proposed method is quantitatively evaluated , by comparison of the results of the one - time measured signals , one - time restored signals , and 1024 - time averaged signals .
for an analysis period of 45 mus and input frequency of 200 khz , figure 12 shows the results of the relative measuring error errm and relative analysis error errp at different input amplitudes .
the relative analysis errors for the one - time restored signals are clearly lower than the relative measuring errors , which indicates that the signal - to - noise ratio was improved using the proposed method .
additionally , as the maximum input amplitude decreased to 58 , 48 , 38 , 28 , and 18 muepsilon , both relative errors increased .
additionally , the relative errors sharply increased for the weaker signal of 18 muepsilon , and no significant signal was found for the case of 8 muepsilon .
figure 12 relative measuring error errm and relative analysis error errp for the different maximum input amplitudes .
for further understanding of the effectiveness , the frequency distributions of the wavelet transforms were analyzed in all cases .
for a maximum input amplitude of 48 microepsilon , the wavelet transforms at awg ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 of the one - time measured signal ( left ) , one - time restored signal ( middle ) , and 1024 - time averaged signal ( right ) are presented in figure 13 , respectively .
likewise , the results of the wavelet transforms for maximum input amplitudes of 38 , 28 , and 18 microepsilon are presented in figure 14 , figure 15 and figure 16 , respectively .
figure 13 wavelet transforms for the maximum input amplitude of 48 microepsilon at awg ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 : ( a ) one - time measured signal ( left ) ; ( b ) one - time restored signal ( middle ) ; ( c ) 1024 - time averaged signal ( right ) .

figure 15 wavelet transforms for the maximum input amplitude of 28 microepsilon at awg ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 : ( a ) one - time measured signal ( left ) ; ( b ) one - time restored signal ( middle ) ; ( c ) 1024 - time averaged signal ( right ) .
figure 16 wavelet transforms for the maximum input amplitude of 18 microepsilon at awg ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 : ( a ) one - time measured signal ( left ) ; ( b ) one - time restored signal ( middle ) ; ( c ) 1024 - time averaged signal ( right ) .
in figure 13 , the results of the one - time restored and 1024 - time averaged signals are similar .
in figure 14 , however , from the time point of 30 mus , the frequency distributions of the one - time restored signals at ports a1 , a2 , and b1 begin to disappear in intervals , and similar distributions are observed overall for the one - time restored and 1024 - time averaged signals .
in figure 15 and figure 16 , for the one - time restored signals , the frequency distributions are similar at 300 and 250 khz , which indicates that other signals beyond 200 khz are mixed in the one - time measured signals and cannot be filtered correctly .
for the cases of 28 and 18 muepsilon , the relative measuring errors are higher than 300 % and it is difficult to obtain a significant signal for the one - time restored signals .
in addition , both frequency distributions disappeared in several places .
3.3.2 .
analysis period for the different analysis periods , the results of the relative measuring error errm and relative analysis error errp are presented in figure 17 , when the maximum input amplitude is 58 microepsilon and the input frequency is 200 khz .
furthermore , for an analysis period of 75 micros , the frequency distribution of the wavelet transforms at awg ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 are presented in figure 18 , for the one - time measured signal ( left ) , one - time restored signal ( middle ) , and 1024 - time averaged signal ( right ) .
likewise , for the analysis periods of 105 , 135 , and 165 micros , the results of the wavelet transforms are presented in figure 19 , figure 20 and figure 21 , respectively .

in figure 17 , the relative errors are presented in 30 - mus intervals from 45 mus .
for the analysis period of 165 mus , the relative analysis error could not be assessed .
in comparison with the relative measuring errors , the relative analysis errors were remarkably reduced using the proposed method .
for example , the relative measuring error is 205 % but the relative analysis error is only 73 % in the case of 45 mus .
this indicates that the noisy elements of the one - time measured signal were substantially filtered by the parafac - based processing .
meanwhile , the relative measuring errors increased with an increase in the analysis period .
it is thus clear that noise existed throughout the time period , and the measurement of the fbg sensors was strongly disturbed by such noise .
the relative analysis errors also increased because of the effect of such noise ; however , the increasing tendency is apparently gradual , which indicates that the parafac method is robust in dealing with such noise .
on the other hand , the risk of missing important atoms becomes high , while the relative measuring error becomes high enough for the one - time measured signal ; e.g. , for the analysis period of 165 mus , paired antiphase atoms could not been found for feature selection to restore the one - time measured signal , which may result from the high relative measuring error around 400 % .
in figure 18 , figure 19 , figure 20 and figure 21 , it is clear that significant signals were detected for the one - time restored and 1024 - time averaged signals , and their wavelet transforms are basically distributed around a frequency of 200 khz .
however , for the 1024 - time averaged signals , the frequency distributions were not revealed after about 40 micros , which means that the conventional averaging method failed to detect weakly significant signals with longer analysis periods .
figure 20c clearly shows that , for port b2 and an analysis period of 135 micros , no significant signal can be distinguished from the 1024 - time averaged signal .
conversely , for the one - time restored signals , significant signals are clearly observed even though the frequency distributions disappeared in many places .
the parafac - based method , compared with the conventional averaging method , is thus considered to be strongly robust against variations in the analysis period .

input signal frequency in the former sections , the effectiveness of the proposed method was discussed in the case of an input signal having a frequency of 200 khz .
to evaluate the effectiveness for different input frequencies , the one - time measured signal was processed at input frequencies of 60 , 90 and 300 khz .
here , the maximum input amplitude is 48 muepsilon and the analysis range is 10 to 500 khz .
the analysis periods are 150 , 100 , and 30 mus for input frequencies of 60 , 90 , and 300 khz , respectively .
the analysis periods were decided as three times the input times of the signals from the mfc actuator .
the results of the relative measuring error errm and relative analysis error errp , for the different the input frequencies are presented in figure 22. with an increase in input frequency , the relative measuring errors fluctuate for the 90 - khz input frequency but the relative analysis errors gradually increase .
the figure clearly shows that the signal - to - noise ratios improved for the one - time restored signals .
in the case of the input frequency of 60 khz , the frequency distribution of the wavelet transforms at awg ports a1 , a2 , b1 , and b2 are presented in figure 23a - c , for the one - time measured signal ( left ) , one - time restored signal ( middle ) , and 1024 - time averaged signal ( right ) .
likewise , for input frequencies of 90 and 300 khz , the results of the wavelet transforms are presented in figure 24 and figure 25 .
in figure 23 , strong consistency is observed between the wavelet transforms of the one - time restored and 1024 - time averaged signals , regardless of the awg port .
moreover , this consistency is also found in figure 24 , between the wavelet transforms of the one - time restored and 1024 - time averaged signals .
however , there is a small break close to 60 mus in figure 24b , for the wavelet transforms of the one - time measured signals .
in figure 25b for the one - time restored signals , the frequency distributions of the wavelet transforms were separated into two parts of 0 - 10 and 20 - 30 mus .
however , in figure 25c for the 1024 - time averaged signals , the frequency distributions of the wavelet transforms were separated into two parts around 200 and 300 khz in the vertical direction .
in both of the situations , the main frequency distribution is concentrated around 300 khz .

4. conclusions the present study investigated the signal recognition of ultrasonic waveforms by application of fbg sensors and awg filters , for which a novel method was proposed to distinguish a significant signal from one - time measured ultrasonic waves .
the method based on parafac decomposition is effective in dealing with noise .
relative to the traditional averaging method , which requires thousands of repeated measurement for noise reduction , the one - time measurement method is simple and cost effective .
thereby , the proposed method employing parafac decomposition for the one - time measured signal is a promising and meaningful tool for practical application .
researchers are always seeking new hardware and design to achieve real - time detection of ultrasonic waves , normally expensive and complex .
recently , researchers did propose several sensing systems with high sensitivity that can real - time detect ultrasonic signals but sacrifice the multiplexing ability in fbg - awg system [ 9,10 ] .
however , the proposed method in this manuscript not only has real - time detection ability , but also maintains the possibility of multiplexing .
this was considered one of the biggest advantages compared to the other techniques mentioned above .
based on parafac decomposition , the proposed signal processing method even has the possibility of being used in other optical fiber sensing systems , when two or more correlation signals could be obtained .
this method is especially suitable to the fbg - awg system , regardless of the amount of fbg sensors .
for example , it is also available for one fbg sensor with the awg system .
the paper started with a description of an experimental system of an ultrasonic wave sensing system that mainly comprises an mfc actuator , two fbg sensors , and an awg filter .
a novel signal processing procedure was then detailed .
in a series of measurement experiments conducted under different conditions , a comprehensive analysis was performed to validate the proposed signal processing strategy .
several conclusions are drawn from the results of the study : ( 1 ) the study established a signal processing strategy that improves the signal - to - noise ratio of the one - time measured ultrasonic signal ; meanwhile , a sound mathematical model was given to describe the signal processing procedure , which mainly includes complex wavelet transformation , parafac decomposition , and relative error evaluation .
( 2 ) the experimental investigation validated that the signal - to - noise ratio for a one - time measured signal can be improved through a comparison of relative measurement and relative analysis errors for different input amplitudes , analysis periods , and input frequencies of the ultrasonic wave signals .
the relative measuring errors increased greatly , whereas the relative analysis errors increased gradually following increases in the analysis period and input frequency and decreases in the input amplitude .
( 3 ) all frequency distributions of wavelet transforms were demonstrated for the one - time measured signals , one - time restored signals , and 1024 - time averaged signals .
it was validated that the proposed method is applicable and reliable for most experimental conditions .

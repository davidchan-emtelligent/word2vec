a conjugated reaction between 3,6 - diazidopyridazine and different types of phosphonyl carbanion reagents followed by intramolecular cyclization afforded the target products , by using sodium ethanolate solution as a reaction medium .
among the products , five compounds , at a dose of 50 mg per kilogram body weight , showed a notable antinociceptive and anti - inflammatory activity without toxic side - effects .
antinociceptive / anti - inflammatory agents imidazophosphor esters phosphonyl carbanions ring closure tetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazine introduction inflammation is a characteristic feature of disease pathology and progression in several neuro - degenerative disorders and physical functioning [ 1 - 2 ] .
recently , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are well established for the treatment of inflammatory disorders [ 3 - 5 ] .
the anti - inflammatory effect of nsaids is mainly based on the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase ( cox ) enzymes .
later on , it was reported that the second isoform of cyclooxygenase ( cox - 2 ) has a better effect on the inflammation with fewer side - effects [ 6 - 9 ] .
despite their widespread use , none of the presently available agents is ideal ; each has its own shortcomings [ 3 ] .
subsequently , to improve the efficacy / safety profile of new nsaids , the structural - activity relationship ( sar ) has been extensively studied , taking into account up - to - date knowledge about the mechanism of inflammation that balanced the inhibition of cox - 1 , cox - 2 , and lipoxygenase ( lox ) [ 10 - 12 ] .
as a part of our continued interest in the development of convenient synthetic approaches to beta - enamino - and alpha - aminophosphonates with anti - inflammatory properties [ 13 - 20 ] , we recently successfully synthesized a series of mono - and bisphosphonate - based tetrazolo [ 1,5 - a ] quinolines with marked anti - inflammatory properties [ 21 - 22 ] .
following this , synthesis of the target compounds , substituted tetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazinphosphor esters , is described herein .
in this context , we applied different types of phosphonyl carbanion reagents to 3,6 - diazidopyridazine ( 1 ) as an adopted substrate .
the anti - inflammatory and the antinociceptive properties of the prepared compounds were screened and the structure - activity relationships were studied .
the anti - inflammatory properties of many tetrazole [ 21 - 23 ] and pyridazine derivatives have also led to their clinical application as nsaids ( e.g. bucolome ) [ 24 ] .
several phosphonate derivatives also exhibit marked potency as inhibitors of cox - 1 and cox - 2 and are therefore believed to be useful as anti - inflammatory drugs [ 25 - 26 ] .
thus , we considered that it is of interest to gather these three motifs in one molecule .
results and discussion it has been reported that 3,6 - diazidopyridazine presents azido ( 1a ) tetrazolo tautomerism ( 1b ) whereby it is mainly in the tetrazole form 1b [ 27 - 29 ] .
accordingly , and as indicated from the spectral data of our products , we considered that the substrate 3,6 - diazidopyridazine ( 1a ) is exclusively , throughout our investigation , reacted in the tetrazolo - form 1b [ 28 - 29 ] ( scheme 1 ) .
the required [ 3,6 - diazidopyridazine ( 1a ) 6 - azidotetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazine ( 1b )] was prepared by treating the readily available 3,6 - dichloropyridazine with sodium azide [ 30 ] .
the reactions studied and the products obtained are depicted in schemes 1 - 7 ( see below ) .
reaction of 1b with 1.3 equivalents of methyl diethyl phosphonoacetate ( 2a ) or the ethyl analogue 2b in sodium ethanolate solution resulted in the same product assigned as diethyl 8 - oxo - 7,8 - dihydroimidazo [ 1,2 - f ] tetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazin - 7 - ylphosphonate ( 4 , 78 %) as indicated from the analytical and the spectroscopic data .
in the 1h nmr spectrum ( cdcl3 ) of 4 ( deltap = 28.4 ppm ) there is a doublet peak ( 2 j p - h = 22.3 hz ) at delta 5.36 ppm corresponding to h ( 4 ) of the imidazole ring while its c ( 4 ) - p appeared at deltac = 59.4 ( d , 1 j p - c = 148.6 hz ) .
a plausible mechanism for the formation of tetrazolopyridazinophosphonate 4 is presented in scheme 1 .
upon heating , the equilibrium between the azido - 1a and its isomeric tetrazolo - 1b form [ 1a 1b ] lies exclusively at the tetrazole isomer 1b [ 29 ] .
compound 1b is then intercepted by the nucleophilic attack of the phosphonyl carbanion 2a or 2b on the azido - function in 1b yielding the phosphonate intermediate 3 along with the evolution of a nitrogen molecule .
subsequent intramolecular ring closure , the fused imidazolo - phosphonate 4 would be obtained under elimination of an appropriate alcohol moiety .
scheme 1 synthesis of substituted diethyl oxophosphonate 4 .
in the same fashion , the substrate 1b reacted with the phosphonyl carbanion , diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate 5 , in ethanolate solution to yield diethyl 8 - aminoimidazo [ 1,2 - f ] tetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazin - 7 - ylphosphonate ( 7 ) in 74 % yield .
the ir spectrum of the phosphonate 7 ( deltap = 27.8 ppm ) showed the nh2 , p = o , and p - o - c motifs at nu 3377 - 3330 , 1226 , and 1123 cm - 1 , respectively .
its 1h nmr ( cdcl3 ) spectrum showed the nh2 - protons at delta 6.44 ( ha , br ) and 8.88 ppm ( hb , br ) , which are attributed to the p = o bonding with one proton of the amino - group .
furthermore , the 13c nmr spectrum of 7 revealed , among others , three doublets at : delta 153.6 [ d , 3 j p - c = 11.4 hz , c ( 2 )] , 141.2 ( d , 1 j p - c = 188.4 hz , c ( 4 ) - p ) , and at delta 126.4 ( d , 2 j p - c = 14.6 hz , c ( 5 ) - nh2 ) ppm .
as displayed in scheme 2 , the formation of the fused imidazophosphonate 7 was formed via the initial condensation intermediate 6 .
further alkaline hydrolysis of the cyano group and the intramolecular cyclization led to the product 7 ( scheme 2 ) .
scheme 2 synthesis of substituted diethyl aminophosphonate 7 .
conversely , similar treatment of 1b with diethyl ( methylthioalkyl ) phosphonates 8a and 8b under the same reaction conditions yielded the fused diazaphospholo - substituted compounds 10a and 10b in 72 and 74 % yield , respectively .
the 31p nmr spectrum ( cdcl3 ) of the diazaphospholes 10a and10b showed a sharp singlet around 14.5 ppm , which is within the range expected for the assigned structure [ 31 ] .
a mechanism for the formation of the heterophosphole structure 10 can be rationalized as in scheme 3 through the condensation of 1b with 8a or 8b to elaborate the intermediates 9a or 9b accompanied by the elimination of a n2 molecule .
further intramolecular cyclization of 9 afforded the diazaphospholes 10a and 10b , respectively , through the loss of an ethanol molecule [ 31 ] ( scheme 3 ) .
scheme 3 synthesis of fused diazaphospholo - substituted compounds 10a , 10b .
next , the fused imidazophosphono - substituted compound 13 ( 68 % yield ) was obtained from the reaction of 1b with diethyl ( 2 - amino - 2 - thioxoethyl ) phosphonate ( 11 ) in ethanolate solution .
obviously , 13 resulted in the same manner from the intermediate 12 initially formed , as outlined in scheme 4 .
scheme 4 synthesis of fused imidazophosphono - substituted compound 13 .
further , the azidotetrazole 1b was allowed to react with the horner - emmons ( he ) reactant , tetraethyl methylenebis ( phosphonate ) ( 14 ) under the same reaction conditions to give the respective beta - enaminobisphosphonate 15 (=~ 73 % yield ) .
the gem - diphosphonate structure 15 was delineated from ir , nmr and ms spectra .
the ir absorptions for 15 showed the 2 p = o stretching frequencies as two bands at 1262 ( p = o , free ) and 1226 ( p = o , bonded ) cm - 1 , which could be explained by a preferred conformation of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the nh proton and one of the p = o moieties .
the 31p nmr spectrum ( cdcl3 ) of 15 showed the presence of two separate doublets with equal 2 j p - p coupling constants 28.4 hz at delta 25.6 and 24.8 ppm .
the 1h and 13c nmr data were also in accordance with the assigned structure ( see supporting information file 1 ) .
the formation of 15 can be rationalized as occurring in scheme 5 through the addition of 14 to the azido group with concomitant evolution of a molecule of n2 ( scheme 5 ) .
bisphosphonates belong to an important class of bp - drugs used for the treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis , hypocalcemia , inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis [ 32 - 33 ] .
scheme 5 synthesis of beta - enaminobisphosphonate 15 .
finally , we studied the behavior of the azidotetrazole 1b toward the unsaturated he reactant , diethyl vinylphosphonate ( 16 ) , and diethyl 2 - methylallylphosphonate ( 18 ) in etona solution to give the fused imidazophosphono - substituted compounds 17 ( 76 %) and 19 ( 74 %) .
obviously , according to scheme 6 , the coupling cyclization reaction of 1b with 16 and auto - oxidation resulted in formation of the final product 17 in one step .
this behavior is familiar in similar reactions .
on the other hand , we presume that the allyl reagent 18 , which could be present in the isomeric forms 18a 18b ( scheme 7 ) , had been conjugated in 18b form with 1b to give the phosphonate 19 .
scheme 6 synthesis of fused imidazophosphono - substituted compounds 17 and 19 .
scheme 7 isomeric forms of diethyl 2 - methylallylphosphonate ( 18 ) .
in summary , it has been found that the substrate 3,6 - diazidopyridazine reacts with nucleophilic phosphorus reagents , he reactants , mainly in the tetrazole - form leading to the formation of tetrazolopyridazino - imidazophosphor esters or beta - enaminophosphor esters .
biological assays based on previous reports [ 24 - 26 ] that recognized the pyridazine nucleus is being suitable for anti - inflammatory and antinociceptive agents , and by the fact that ring - fused heterocycles containing more than one nitrogen atom ( e.g. , tetrazole nuclei [ 21 - 23 ]) are key structures in a large variety of biochemical processes , bioscreening of the synthesized substituted tetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazine - phosphor derivatives was carried out .
thus , keeping the tetrazolopyridazine core structure intact , we studied the effect of different phosphorus - containing moieties on their antinociceptive and anti - inflammatory effects .
substrate 1 was also tested to reflect the effect of its transformations to our products .
antinociceptive evaluation para - benzoquinone ( p - bq ) - induced writhing test the evaluation of antinociceptive activity of the synthesized compounds was assessed in vivo in mice by using the p - benzoquinone - induced writhing test [ 26 ] .
ibuprofen was used as a positive control in our experiments ; the antinociceptive capacity was expressed as the percentage change compared to writhing controls .
the results shown in table 1 indicated that beta - enaminobisphosphonate 15 is the most potent antinociceptive structure ( 86.4 %) , which was followed by alpha - aminophosphonates 13 ( 84 %) and 7 ( 81 %) .
indeed , while the azido substrate 1 showed only a weak antinociceptive effect ( 14 %) , the eight phosphor compounds demonstrated higher capacity than the reference ibuprofen drug ( 69.9 %) at the same dose of 50 mg per kilogram body weight .

anti - inflammatory screening carrageenan - induced hind paw edema test anti - inflammation properties of the new tetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazines - bearing mono - ( 4 , 7 , 10a , 10b , 13 , 17 , 19 ) and diphosphonate nuclei ( 15 ) were evaluated in an animal model , by the carrageenan - induced paw edema ( cpe ) method .
following the standard procedures [ 34 - 35 ] , these compounds were administered subcutaneously by using 50 mg per kilogram body weight , and the anti - inflammatory effect was measured at successive time intervals ( 90 , 180 , 270 , and 360 min , after carrageenan injection ) .
the results are profiled in table 1 and are compared to the substrate 1 and to indomethacin ( a ) .
beta - enaminobisphosphonate 15 showed the most potent inflammatory properties ( e.g. , 114 % after 360 min ) relative to indomethacin .
nevertheless , other compounds displayed good to excellent effects ( 95 to 108 %) in inflammation inhibition after 360 min comparing to a without toxic effects .
percentage inhibition of granuloma for the tested compounds at a dose of 50 mg per kilogram body weight at successive intervals is displayed in fig. 1. figure 1 percentage inhibition of granuloma for the tested compounds at a dose of 50 mg per kilogram body weight after the given time intervals .
error bar : 5 % .
according to the results of the biological assay in table 1 , we could deduce the structure - activity relationship ( sar ) as follows : ( 1 ) among the tested compounds , beta - enaminobisphosphonate 15 has the most antinociceptive / anti - inflammatory activity , even higher than the references ibuprofen and indomethacin ; ( 2 ) there is a parallel correlation between the anti - inflammatory activities and the antinociceptive activity results ( table 1 ) ; ( 3 ) the amino group substituent has a positive effect ( see 7 and 13 ) ; ( 4 ) like indomethacin , the tested phosphonates showed gradual increase in the second phase ( after 270 min ) .
ld50 of the most promising products in an acute - toxicity experiment , the most promising anti - inflammatory compounds 15 , 7 , and 13 were tested using the ld50 standard method in mice at doses of 500 , 750 and 1000 mg per kilogram body weight , which is 10 - 20 times the used anti - inflammatory effective dose ( 50 mg per kilogram body weight ) .
the assay did not show toxic symptoms or mortality rates throughout the following 24 h post - administration , indicating the safety of the used doses .
conclusion in summary , we have offered a practical and efficient procedure for the synthesis of imidazophosphor esters based tetrazolo [ 1,5 - b ] pyridazine in high yields by application of different types of horner - emmons ( he ) reagents on 3,6 - diazidopyridazine .
among the products , the beta - enaminobisphosphonate compound demonstrated the highest antinociceptive and the anti - inflammatory activities .

keywords orexin hypocretin phospholipase european society for neurochemistry biannual conference : molecular mechanisms of regulation in the nervous systemtartu , estonia14 - 17 june 2015http :// www.esn2015.ee / issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 orexin / hypocretin peptides are central for the regulation of the sleep / arousal states , and have , in addition , a role in the regulation of e.g. metabolism , addiction , stress response and pain gating .
orexin responses are mediated by g - protein - coupled ox1 and ox2 orexin receptors .
orexin signaling ( in different cell types ) is very versatile , ranging from excitation to induction of cell death .
orexin receptor coupling is promiscuous , engaging members of at least three different families of g - proteins , namely gi , gs and gq , and some non - g - protein mediators as well .
preferred g - protein - coupling of the receptors appears different in different tissues , but the mechanism determining this are unknown .
the primary signal transducers of orexin receptors very effectively activate phosholipase cascades , including pla2 , plc and pld , and also plc - diacylglycerol lipase - mediated endocannabinoid generation .
these cascades may play a significant role in the regulation of k + and non - selective cation channels , which are the effectors for the orexin - mediated neuronal excitation .
in some cell types , orexin receptor stimulation induces programmed cell death .
some different mechanisms for his have been proposed , but the picture is still incomplete .
orexin receptors have been a target for multiple drug discovery projects .
main focus has been on the antagonists , with insomnia as the indication .
for agonist drugs there are some ongoing smaller academic and semi - academic projects .
use of orexin receptor agonists is suggested to be beneficial in narcolepsy ( as peptide replacement therapy ) and putatively in other sleep / wakefulness disturbances , metabolic disorders and cancer .

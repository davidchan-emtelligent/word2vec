toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) play an important role in mycobacterial infection , although little is known about the roles of these receptors , cytokines and nitric oxide during anti - tuberculosis treatment .
our objective was to evaluate the mrna and cell surface expression of tlr2 and tlr4 ; inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) expression ; and cytokine th1 , th2 and th17 profiles in pulmonary tuberculosis patients at different time points of anti - tuberculosis treatment .
peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were obtained from ppd + healthy controls and from patients receiving anti - tuberculosis treatment .
gene expression quantification was performed by qpcr , cell surface expression was assessed using flow cytometry , and cytokine quantification was conducted using the cba technique .
the treated patients presented higher gene expression and higher numbers of receptors on the cell surface of lymphocytes and monocytes than did control individuals .
il - 12 and ifn - gamma levels increased after the start of treatment , whereas tnf - alpha levels were reduced .
tgf - beta presented the highest levels during treatment .
il - 10 and il - 17 expression and production tended to increase during treatment .
inos gene expression was reduced throughout treatment in patients .
our results suggest that anti - tuberculosis treatment modulates the immune response , inducing an increase in the expression of tlrs and pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines to combat bacteria and reduce the inflammatory process .

introduction tuberculosis ( tb ) is an infectious disease with chronic evolution , and its etiological agent is the intracellular bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis ( m. tuberculosis ) [ 1 ] .
toll - like receptor ( tlr ) 2 is the main receptor for mycobacterial constituents , recognizing lipoarabinomannan ( lam ) ; its precursor , phosphatidylinositol mannoside ( pim ) ; and 19 - kda lipoprotein [ 2 ] - [ 6 ] .
tlr4 is a receptor for exogenous ligands , such as lps from gram - negative bacteria , and can recognize endogenous ligands , such as heat shock protein ( hsp ) 60 / 65 , which is released by mycobacteria [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
studies have shown that the recognition of mycobacterial products by tlrs leads to nf - kappab activation and consequently to gene transcription that produces pro - inflammatory cytokines , such as il - 12 , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta and nitric oxide [ 9 ] .
the recognition of m. tuberculosis by tlrs induces phagocytosis by alveolar phagocytes and the production of il - 12 by macrophages and dendritic cells .
il - 12 stimulates natural killer ( nk ) cells and th1 responses that produce ifn - gamma [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
ifn - gamma is responsible for activating macrophages to produce tnf - alpha , which , in synergy with ifn - gamma , acts to increase phagocytosis and microbicidal activity through the production of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates involved in the growth inhibition and death of mycobacteria [ 12 ] - [ 15 ] .
tnf - alpha is also essential for forming and maintaining granulomas [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 12 ] .
studies have suggested that protective immunity against m. tuberculosis and th1 responses require th17 , mainly at the start of infection [ 18 ] .
il - 17 has pro - inflammatory properties that induce the expression of cytokines , chemokines and metalloproteinases , which are important in neutrophil recruitment , activation and migration [ 19 ] .
despite the protective effect of th1 and th17 responses against tuberculosis , the elevated expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines is related to disease immunopathogenesis [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
to limit this deleterious action , anti - inflammatory mechanisms arise , represented by soluble tnf - alpha receptors that impede this cytokine 's binding to its receptor through signal blockade by regulatory t cells and the anti - inflammatory cytokines il - 4 , il - 10 and tgf - beta [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] .
studies have shown that tlrs regulate the intracellular destination of bacteria through a complicated cascade of regulators and deregulators .
however , the roles of tlrs , cytokines and nitric oxide during anti - tuberculosis treatment are unknown .
in light of these observations , studies evaluating tlrs ; inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) ; and th1 , th2 and th17 cytokines in patients during anti - tuberculosis treatment may contribute to a better understanding of the host / pathogen relationship in this disease .
our study evaluated the mrna and cell surface expression of tlr2 and tlr4 ; inos expression ; and the production and expression of il - 12 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 17 , il - 10 and tgf - beta in pulmonary tuberculosis patients during anti - tuberculosis treatment .
materials and methods patients the study recruited 20 healthcare workers ( c ) as controls ( 13 males and six females ; mean age of 49 and 37 years , respectively ) with a positive tuberculin skin test ( tst ) ( induration >= 10 mm ) from botucatu medical school university hospital .
these individuals had no clinical complaints or with no history of tb disease , autoimmune disease or other infectious disease .
samples from c were collected at one time point .
the study also included 19 pulmonary tuberculosis patients ( tb ) ( 13 males and six females ; mean age of 49 and 37 years , respectively ) treated at the infectious and parasitic diseases services at botucatu medical school university hospital - unesp , botucatu teaching health centre , and at primary healthcare units in botucatu and the surrounding region .
tuberculosis patients were diagnosed based on a sputum smear or culture positive for m. tuberculosis or clinical - epidemiologic data and laboratory and imaging exams compatible with active tuberculosis .
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis concurrent with other active granulomatous disease , autoimmune disease , cancer , hiv or other immunodeficiency or multidrug resistance and pregnant women were excluded .
all pulmonary tuberculosis patients were treated for six months using the standard scheme ( rifampicin , isoniazid , pyrazinamide and ethambutol ) .
samples from patients were collected based on the anti - tuberculosis treatment timeline : m1 : patients with no more than one month of anti - tuberculosis treatment ; m2 : in the third month of anti - tuberculosis treatment ; and m3 : at the end of six months of anti - tuberculosis treatment .
all of the patients and controls agreed to participate in the study after due clarification and signing of a written informed consent form .
this study was approved by botucatu medical school - unesp research ethics committee .
blood sample collection blood samples ( 20 ml ) were collected from the forearm vein at one time point from controls and at three different time points of anti - tuberculosis treatment from pulmonary tb patients .
samples were collected in heparinized tubes and initially centrifuged at 1,500 g for 10 minutes to obtain plasma for measuring cytokines by cba .
the remaining blood samples were used to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) for later evaluation of the gene expression of tlr2 , tlr4 , inos and cytokines and the expression of tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface using flow cytometry .
harvesting mononuclear cells from peripheral blood pbmcs were obtained by the histopaque ( r ) gradient separation method [ 24 ] .
the layer rich in lymphocytes and monocytes was aseptically removed and washed with pbs for 15 minutes at 450 g. the cells were then resuspended in pbs .
cell identification and viability analysis were performed by turk count .
a 1x106 / ml or 2x106 / ml cell concentration was then prepared for the described protocols .
tlr2 , tlr4 , il - 12 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 17 , il - 10 , tgf - beta and inos mrna expression total rna was extracted from pbmcs at 2x106 cells / ml that were obtained once from controls or at m1 , m2 and m3 of anti - tuberculosis treatment from pulmonary tb patients by the trizol method ( gibco - brl , sao paulo , brazil ) .
the rna concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm ; all samples showed an absorbance value of approximately 2.0 .
one microgram of rna was used for the synthesis of 20 microl of complementary dna ( cdna ) by superscript ( tm ) iii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen , sao paulo , brazil ) .
tlr2 , tlr4 , il - 12 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 10 , tgf - beta , il - 17 and inos mrna levels were determined by real - time pcr .
primer sequences are shown in table 1 .
the beta - actin gene was used as an internal control .
relative quantification of each target mrna was performed using a standard curve - based method for relative real - time pcr data processing with a 7300 real - time pcr system ( applied biosystems , usa ) and power sybr green pcr master mix [ 25 ] .
the real - time pcr cycler conditions were 95degreesc for 10 minutes , followed by 40 annealing cycles at 95degreesc for 15 seconds and extension at 60degreesc for 1 minute .
fluorescence signals were collected during the annealing and extension cycle of amplification ( 60degreesc for 1 minute ) .
amplification of specific transcripts was confirmed based on the melting curve profiles generated at the end of each run .
the control samples' mean expression was assigned a relative value of 1.0 , and concentrations in all other samples were normalized proportionately .

each test contained a control tube in which cells were incubated with isotopic control antibodies labeled with respective fluorochromes .
cytokine production the levels of the cytokines il - 12 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 17 , tgf - beta and il - 10 were measured in the plasma by the cba technique and analyzed using flow cytometry ( facscalibur ( tm ) , becton dickinson ) using cellquest software ( becton dickinson ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
statistical analysis the gene expression of tlr2 , tlr4 , il - 12 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 10 and tgf - beta was compared using anova in repeated - measurement design on time , followed by an adjusted tukey 's test for multiple comparisons when the data presented a normal distribution .
in the case of a non - normal distribution of data on tlr2 , tlr4 , il - 12 , ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 10 , tgf - beta and il - 17 levels in patients and controls , the same design was fitted using a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution .

discussion in this study , we evaluated the gene and cell surface expression of tlr2 and tlr4 in pulmonary tuberculosis patients during anti - tuberculosis treatment .
we showed that these patients exhibit both receptors and expression increases during anti - tuberculosis treatment .
we also found that when cells were labeled with anti - cd3 and anti - cd14 , both lymphocyte and monocyte populations presented higher tlr2 expression than tlr4 expression , and most cells that expressed tlr4 also expressed tlr2 .
these results are in agreement with the findings of other studies demonstrating that tlr2 and tlr4 are involved in m. tuberculosis recognition [ 26 ] - [ 28 ] .
our results showed that although receptor expression is higher in monocytes , this expression is also observed in lymphocytes .
these results are in agreement with the findings of other studies that have shown increases in tlr mrna expression in cd4 + and cd8 + t lymphocytes in acute tonsillitis [ 29 ] and in various lymphocyte subtypes tb patients' pleural fluid [ 30 ] .
tlr ligands have different effects on innate immune cells , such as monocytes , including the induction and production of cytokines , the expression of costimulatory molecules and the expression of mhc ii molecules .
studies in mice with genes from inactivated tlrs have shown that tlr2 expression in monocytes is important in infection control and survival in these animals .
other studies have suggested a protective role for tlr4 expression in monocytes in mouse survival [ 31 ] - [ 34 ] , depending on the mycobacterium dose [ 34 ] .
in t lymphocytes , these receptors can act as costimulatory receptors for the tcr , increasing the proliferation of stimulated t cells and / or the production of cytokines .
different antigens from mycobacteria can indirectly modulate t cell function through functional changes in antigen - presenting cells , although direct interactions between m. tuberculosis molecules and t cells can occur when mycobacterial components contained in vesicles are liberated by infected macrophages [ 35 ] - [ 37 ] .
differences between expression and production can be explained by mrna stability , the transcription rate and factors that regulate translation that can directly affect the expression and production of mediators involved in immune responses [ 38 ] .
high tlr2 and tlr4 expression during anti - tuberculosis treatment associated with a moderate form of disease suggests that these receptors were seems likely beneficial to the patients because such tlrs can induce the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines .
in this sense , we showed that pulmonary tuberculosis patients at the start of the treatment presented similar il - 12 gene expression levels and production as did controls , and these parameters increased during anti - tuberculosis treatment .
sahiratmadja et al ( 2007 ) [ 39 ] showed that after two months of similar treatment , il - 12 levels considerably increased , becoming higher than levels in controls [ 39 ] .
contrary to what we observed , others have shown that serum levels of il - 12p40 were not higher in patients with active tuberculosis during anti - tuberculosis treatment than in healthy controls or contactants [ 40 ] .
a possible explanation for these results could be differences in experimental protocols , such as the treatment periods evaluated and the cytokine detection techniques .
il - 12 is important in mediating protective immunity against tb and is induced following phagocytosis of m. tuberculosis by macrophages and dendritic cells [ 41 ] , which leads to the development of a th1 response , with production of ifn - gamma [ 41 ] .
our study showed significantly increased mrna expression for ifn - gamma in tb patients at the beginning of treatment , and plasma levels tended to increase during treatment in relation to control individuals .
additionally , protein expression and production , but mainly production , increased at the three months of treatment and tended to decrease at the end of treatment .
a study showed that recently diagnosed patients presented higher serum ifn - gamma levels than did individuals with a previous tuberculosis history , although the levels were similar to those of healthy controls .
in the same study , untreated individuals presented much higher levels of this cytokine , which gradually decreased during treatment [ 42 ] .
these results differ from ours and those of another study in which ifn - gamma was shown to increase during the course of treatment [ 39 ] .
a possible explanation for this cytokine 's increased levels after treatment is based on a study performed by jo et al .
( 2003 ) [ 43 ] , which showed that at the moment of tuberculosis diagnosis , the ifn - gamma concentration is much higher at the infection site than in the peripheral blood , suggesting that during tuberculosis activity , there is a localization of specific lymphocytes against the mycobacterial antigen at the infection site and that the increase in the ifn - gamma serum concentration at the chemotherapy stage coincides with the arrival of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood .
in contrast to our findings , other studies have observed that ifn - gamma levels are depressed in patients with active tuberculosis [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] .
patients with the moderate form of tb present higher ifn - gamma levels than patients with the more severe form [ 39 ] .
although our results showed that the expression of this cytokine was higher at the start of treatment , this elevated expression did not translate into production , which only showed a trend toward being higher than in control individuals .
levels in this phase of treatment were not related to protection , seems likely because quantities were still not adequate to activate the mechanism responsible for mycobacteria destruction because the bacterial load was high in most patients at this stage .
ifn - gamma levels increased during treatment and were seems likely sufficient to activate a protective response .
tnf - alpha , an important cytokine for infection control , is involved in the macrophage activation process and is also an important factor related to disease immunopathology [ 46 ] .
in our study , tuberculosis patients presented significantly higher tnf - alpha levels than did controls .
during treatment , patients presented gradually decreasing levels of this cytokine .
other studies have also shown that individuals with tuberculosis presented elevated tnf - alpha levels in pbmc culture supernatant compared with controls , and these levels decreased during treatment [ 46 ] , [ 42 ] .
in our study , despite the high tnf - alpha levels in patients at the start of treatment , we observed that this cytokine was not protective at this phase and could have been involved in disease pathogenesis .
because treatment decreased tnf - alpha levels , we suggest that at lower levels , this cytokine could be involved in protection through the stimulation of pathogenic mechanisms .
tnf - alpha , depending on the concentration produced , could be involved in immunopathological effects such as fever , body weight reduction , tissue necrosis and shock [ 47 ] - [ 55 ] .
in our study , pulmonary tuberculosis patients tended to present much lower il - 17 levels at the start of treatment compared with controls .
during treatment , production and expression tended to increase .
th17 cells , which are involved in the development of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases , are also involved in protection against certain intracellular pathogens [ 56 ] - [ 58 ] , including m. tuberculosis [ 59 ] , [ 60 ] .
however , the exact role of th17 cells in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis , mainly during anti - tuberculosis treatment , is not very clear [ 61 ] .
il - 17 can be induced immediately after pulmonary infection with bcg [ 57 ] and can also be detected in the later stages ( 4 - 52 weeks ) of m. tuberculosis infection [ 60 ] .
the frequency of th17 cells in pulmonary tb patients has been reported as significantly lower than in healthy controls and individuals with latent tb [ 56 ] .
these results suggest that a reduced th17 response could be associated with the clinical manifestation of pulmonary tb and that this cell subtype might be involved in protection , rather than disease immunopathogenesis .
these ideas agree with our findings , as patients at the start of treatment had low il - 17 levels that tended to increase with treatment and pathogen killing .
our results showed that the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines , such as il - 10 and tgf - beta , tended to rise during anti - tuberculosis treatment and to diminish at the end of treatment .
this phenomenon suggested that these cytokines' main actuation was at the end of treatment , exerting a regulatory role to control the inflammatory process .
other human studies on tuberculosis have suggested that il - 10 also has a critical role in protecting the host against inflammatory immunopathology [ 62 ] .
in contrast to our results , studies have shown that patients with a recent diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis present higher serum levels of il - 10 than do previously treated or healthy individuals , although treatment reduces the serum concentration of this cytokine [ 40 ] , [ 42 ] .
moreover , another study observed that before treatment , tuberculosis patients presented similar levels of this cytokine as controls [ 63 ] .
we observed differences related to production and expression during treatment .
differences between expression and production can be explained by mrna stability , the transcription rate and factors that regulate translation that can directly affect the expression and production of mediators involved in immune responses [ 38 ] .
in tuberculosis , tgf - beta can primarily exert a suppressive role as part of a th1 profile and participate in fibrosis induction [ 46 ] .
at low concentrations , this cytokine still acts as a chemotactic factor for monocytes , inducing il - 1alpha and tnf - alpha secretion and participating in th17 cell differentiation , together with il - 6 and il - 21 [ 64 ] , and treg cell differentiation [ 65 ] .
our results agree with the literature , which reports that patients with pulmonary tb do not present a deficiency in tgf - beta production in active disease or during anti - tuberculosis treatment [ 46 ] , [ 63 ] .
during treatment , we suggest that the high levels of this cytokine are regulating inflammatory activity , contributing to protecting against the damage caused by the exacerbated inflammatory response and participating in extracellular matrix deposition and fibrotic processes .
no is considered to be one of the main mediators involved in mycobacterium killing [ 66 ] , and no generation is dependent on the inos enzyme [ 67 ] .
to our knowledge , this is the first study to evaluate inos in pulmonary tuberculosis patients during anti - tuberculosis treatment .
we observed an decrease of the gene expression of this enzyme during treatment compared with expression in control individuals .
certain studies have suggested that the inhibition of inos expression and no production can be considered as an escape mechanism for various infectious agents , such as mycobacterium leprae and m. tuberculosis [ 68 ] .
certain m. tuberculosis antigens , such as cfp - 10 and 19 - kda protein , can affect macrophage function , inhibiting macrophages' microbicidal capacity and creating a favorable environment for m. tuberculosis survival [ 69 ] .
the mycobacterial cell wall component lam can directly inhibit phagolysosome fusion [ 70 ] , [ 71 ] , and studies have suggested that mycobacterium can impede its recruitment to the phagolysosome , also characterizing an escape mechanism [ 72 ] .
another fact that must be taken into account is that other microbicidal mechanisms , such as oxygen metabolites , can be important in bacteria killing , including the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide [ 73 ] .
because our results did not show an association between tlrs and cytokines , we were not able to confirm that the levels of cytokines and inos measured in the study subjects were dependent on tlr2 and tlr4 .
our results also lack an association between demographic characteristics and expression and production of the variables evaluated .
these results may be due to our small sample size , high standard variation and the fact that all patients had a moderate presentation of ptb .
our study showed that during anti - tuberculosis treatment , pulmonary tuberculosis patients presented increased tlr expression and pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokine levels , which were seems likely responsible for controlling infection and excess inflammation .
therefore , we suggest that during anti - tuberculosis treatment , mycobacteria killing could occur due to a direct effect of the treatment , as well as by the activation of several mediators of the immune response .

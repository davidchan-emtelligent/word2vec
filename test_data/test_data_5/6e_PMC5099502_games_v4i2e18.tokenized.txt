background finding ways to increase and sustain engagement with mhealth interventions has become a challenge during application development .
while gamification shows promise and has proven effective in many fields , critical questions remain concerning how to use gamification to modify health behavior .
objective the objective of this study is to investigate how the gamification of mhealth interventions leads to a change in health behavior , specifically with respect to smoking cessation .
methods we conducted a qualitative longitudinal study using a sample of 16 smokers divided into 2 cohorts ( one used a gamified intervention and the other used a nongamified intervention ) .
each participant underwent 4 semistructured interviews over a period of 5 weeks .
semistructured interviews were also conducted with 4 experts in gamification , mhealth , and smoking cessation .
interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis undertaken .
results results indicated perceived behavioral control and intrinsic motivation acted as positive drivers to game engagement and consequently positive health behavior .
importantly , external social influences exerted a negative effect .
we identified 3 critical factors , whose presence was necessary for game engagement : purpose ( explicit purpose known by the user ) , user alignment ( congruency of game and user objectives ) , and functional utility ( a well - designed game ) .
we summarize these findings in a framework to guide the future development of gamified mhealth interventions .
conclusions gamification holds the potential for a low - cost , highly effective mhealth solution that may replace or supplement the behavioral support component found in current smoking cessation programs .
the framework reported here has been built on evidence specific to smoking cessation , however it can be adapted to health interventions in other disease categories .
future research is required to evaluate the generalizability and effectiveness of the framework , directly against current behavioral support therapy interventions in smoking cessation and beyond .
gamification mhealth mobile health smoking cessation health behavior health policy public health behavioral support introduction smoking is responsible for 19 % of all deaths in the united kingdom , with a direct cost of pound5.2 billion to the national health service ( nhs ) [ 1 ] .
it is a leading cause of chronic disease [ 2 ] , and has been declared as the most important cause of preventable morbidity and premature mortality worldwide [ 3 ] .
however , depressingly , there remains a significant disparity between individuals desiring to quit smoking (~ 68 %) , and those actually successfully quitting (~ 3 %) [ 4 ] .
in 2013 / 14 , the nhs stop smoking services reached only 9 % of individuals in the united kingdom seeking to quit .
alarmingly , this represented a 19 % year - on - year reduction [ 5,6 ] .
as a result , the nhs 5 - year forward view pledged ' hard - hitting national action ' against preventable diseases including smoking , with a new set of smoking cessation services being outlined by public health england to promote healthier behavior [ 7 ] .
a cochrane review concluded that high - intensity behavioral support combined with pharmacological intervention was the most effective method for smoking cessation [ 8 ] with the national institute for health and care excellence demonstrating a 35 % quit rate compared with a 2 % background quit rate .
however , this approach is expensive with lifetime costs of pound7010 per person , where behavioral support contributes to the bulk of the cost [ 9 ] .
the continuing economic and societal burden created by smoking suggests current smoking cessation techniques are underserving the population and begs the question : are there any other novel approaches we can take to tackle the addiction of smoking ?
the rapid technological advancement of mobile phone technologies over the last decade has facilitated a burgeoning market for mhealth apps .
however , while thousands of mhealth apps have been released , most have fallen short of their grand expectations owing largely to poor user engagement levels [ 10 ] .
user engagement was identified as a critical factor to the success of mhealth in an analysis of 945 mhealth apps [ 11 ] .
thus , finding ways to increase user engagement with their target audience has become a significant focus of mhealth interventions [ 12 ] .
gamification is ' the use of game design elements in nongame contexts' [ 13 ] , making use of the potential motivational ability of games .
gamification empowers users to complete tasks more efficiently , while making them more enjoyable , with the aim of increasing engagement [ 14 ] .
cugelman [ 15 ] argues that gamification is only effective when used in conjunction with academically grounded behavioral change strategies , and goes on to identify 7 " core ingredients " that can be used as persuasive strategies to promote behavioral change .
the application of gamification in mhealth is an emerging field .
sparx , a digital game intervention developed to treat clinical depression in adolescents , represents a successful implementation of gamification .
a randomized controlled trial demonstrated noninferiority of the game against traditional face - to - face counseling , along with significantly higher remission rates [ 16 ]. from the perspective of health behavior , gamification has shown promising results in encouraging physical activity by turning the ' work of exercise ' into a game [ 17 ] .
a recent review published in jmir mental health found no studies had been published explicitly examining the role of gamification features on program adherence with web - based interventions to manage common mental health disorders [ 18 ] .
many health apps have attempted to replicate such success by promoting positive health behavior in a wider context , particularly in relation to smoking , albeit with variable success [ 12 ] .
a systematic literature review found that the implementation of game elements helps to create motivational affordances that lead to desired psychological outcomes and the consequent behavioral outcome ( figure 1 ) [ 19 ] .
however , critical questions remain concerning the mechanism by which gamification exerts its influence , with a particular paucity in research surrounding gamification in the context of health behavior .
while gamification shows promise and has proven effective in many fields , research is required to investigate the beneficial effects on health behavior and disease self - management to warrant the implementation of such interventions [ 20 ] .
the aim of this study was to take a cognitivist approach , building on the evidence gathered from existing literature and our own data collection , to gain insight into the underlying thought processes and internal rules , which govern the way individuals react to a gamified smoking cessation intervention .
consequently , in this exploratory work , we aim to suggest how gamification might lead to a change in health behavior specifically with respect to smoking cessation .
figure 1 how motivational affordances lead to behavioral outcomes [ 19 ] .

the first cohort used a nongamified mhealth intervention free of any game components , while the second used a gamified mhealth intervention .
interventions in order to isolate the game - specific effects we would require 2 identical apps , differing only by the presence of gamified features .
to approach this level of distinction , we shortlisted , downloaded , and tested 12 apps to establish which , gamification aside , were the most similar in app mechanics to allow fair comparison .
' puff away ' and ' kwit 2 ' were chosen because they both used very similar mechanisms to engage the user , focussing on tackling user education and providing progress tracking .
the additional game components in kwit 2 are specified in table 1 [ 15 ] .
participants all participants met the following 4 criteria : a smoker currently intent on quitting ; 18 + years old ; english speaker ; and owner of a smartphone .
we excluded those with smoking - related illnesses .
participants were recruited from local smoking support groups and university campuses in london .
each participant was then randomly allocated to a cohort and asked to install the relevant app onto their own smartphones .
participants were not compensated for their time .
informed verbal and written consent was obtained prior to commencing the study .
the study had approval from the imperial college research ethics committee .
interview procedure we conducted semistructured , one - on - one interviews with participants ( 30 minutes ) .
four interviews were conducted with each participant over the course of 5 weeks .
the first interview ( week 0 ) assessed their smoking background and demographics .
this was accompanied by a standardized set of instructions on how to use their specific app .
subsequent interviews were then conducted at weeks 1 , 3 , and 5 , with changes in participant behavior and emotions being tracked and recorded .
interviewers were instructed to neither encourage nor discourage the participant 's smoking behavior so as to minimize any effect on their behavior .
interview questions were formulated and then discussed with 2 independent , experienced qualitative researchers .
the participants were asked about their progress in relation to smoking cessation , their experience using the app , the effect of the app on their behavior and emotions , as well as the specific effects of the game components .
the final interview incorporated an exit interview in which participants expressed their overall experience .
we conducted an internal pilot to test our methodology with 5 participants .
week 0 and week 1 interviews were conducted with each participant , allowing us to refine the interview questions and confirm the suitability of the 2 apps selected .
the methodology employed with the pilot study was deemed satisfactory for the main study and so the results of all 5 pilot participants were included in the full longitudinal study .
a semistructured interview guide can be found in the web - based supplement in multimedia appendix 1 .
analysis procedure the 6 - phase analytic framework was employed in our thematic analysis [ 21 ] .
audiotaped interviews were transcribed and read by 3 researchers on 2 separate occasions .
these interview scripts were then used to manually generate codes for recurring patterns across participants .
the codes were then analyzed to form overarching themes , all of which were defined by the 3 researchers .
ambiguities were resolved in discussion .
this was a recursive process , whereby researchers cycled back and forth through the phases to allow for iteration as required .
once the saturation point had been reached and no new themes were emerging , the recruitment of new participants was stopped , conforming to the grounded theory approach [ 22 ] .
all data regarding theme construction and interpretation was recorded in a reflexivity journal .
once the themes had been completed and defined , the researchers went back to the initial data sample to verify the accuracy of the overarching themes .
expert interviews semistructured interviews with 4 experts were conducted .
the experts were initially shortlisted following our literature search , subsequently looking specifically at the research credentials of candidates .
this shortlist was then narrowed to 4 based on their level of expertise within their respective fields of gamification , digital health , and smoking cessation .
the experts were : prof scott nicholson , professor of game design and development , and director at because play matters game lab , wilfrid laurier university ; prof steven johnson , assistant professor at fox school of business , temple university ; dr dominic king , coauthor of the most cited editorial on gamification and health behavior change ; and dr omar usmani , reader in respiratory medicine and consultant physician in respiratory medicine at the national heart and lung institute , imperial college london & royal brompton hospital .
a semistructured interview was conducted with each expert affording an in - depth multifaceted exploration of both gamification and smoking cessation .
the transcripts from these interviews underwent the same manual thematic coding procedure as outlined for the longitudinal participant interviews .
results participant characteristics of the 19 participants initially recruited , 3 participants dropped out after the week 0 interview. of the 3 dropouts , 2 were in the gamified cohort and 1 was in the nongamified cohort .
the reasons given for dropout were refusal of further contact ( 2 ) and problems with availability ( 1 ) .
the resulting analysis is of the remaining 16 participants : 9 used the gamified intervention and 7 used the nongamified intervention .
all 16 participants reported daily use of their smartphones .
all participants expressed a desire to quit smoking prior to recruitment to the study , with 31 % ( 5 / 16 ) of the participants attempting to quit for the first time .
additional characteristics are summarized in table 2 table 2 participant characteristics .

longitudinal participant interviews a total of 57 interviews were conducted across a 5 - week period : 16 interviews at week 0 , 16 at week 1 , 11 at week 3 , and 14 at week 5 .
transcripts and audio recordings were available for all the interviews .
three overarching themes that influenced the impact of the app intervention on health behavior were identified from the longitudinal participant interviews only , with 8 subthemes ( figure 2 ) : app engagement , game engagement , and external influences .
app engagement refers to the components common to both gamified and nongamified interventions that helped to create engagement with the user .
game engagement refers to those game components unique to the gamified intervention that helped build engagement with the user .
finally , external influence describes the factors external to both interventions that impacted engagement with the app .
the number of codes found in each subtheme can be found in figure 3 .
expert interviews there was a consensus among the experts that technology has the potential to support health care professionals , in providing the behavioral support necessary in certain segments of the population .
however , the experts questioned the long - term impact of a gamified intervention , and stated it would be a challenge to maintain long - term user commitment .
experts suggested that gamification can only reinforce desired behaviors , interventions should aim to build intrinsic motivation , rewards should be variable , and that a self - relevant experience is a critical success factor to building engagement with the game .
analysis of results following a thorough analysis of our findings , we identified drivers and modifiers to health behavior change .
drivers describe the key mechanisms by which behavioral change is produced .
modifiers were identified as those factors whose presence and quality determined the strength of the drivers , and therefore how likely the app was to promote positive health behavior .
we recognized 3 drivers common to the mhealth interventions : attitude change , goal setting , and association ( of the mhealth solution with the maladaptive health behavior ) .
additionally , 2 drivers were proposed as the method by which gamification promotes positive health behavior : perceived behavioral control and intrinsic motivation .
figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the themes from the participant interviews , the other data sources and the drivers to behavioral change .
drivers and modifiers common to the mhealth interventions driver 1 - attitude change a change in attitude toward the maladaptive health behavior described by 1 participant in the following statement : it makes me reconsider if i really need to smoke or not and sometimes that extra few seconds is enough to put my cigarette away ...
it makes you contemplate and double think ' do i really need a cigarette right now ? ?
this was seen repeatedly with another participant explaining the following : when someone is trying to quit it 's like a battle in your head [ between smoking and not smoking ] ...
the app helps you in this battle [ to not smoke ] .
this finding can be explained by the health belief model , which states that positive behavioral change can arise from increasing perceived threat of the negative health behavior and increasing perceived benefit of the positive health behavior [ 23 ] .
dr usmani , with a background in smoking cessation , reinforced this by explaining how highlighting the implications of an individual 's actions may result in behavior change : first of all contextualizing the advantage of stopping smoking gives them a scare , a bit of a shock ...
this is what happens in real life terms of making people want to quit smoking .
driver 2 - goal setting the progress tracking mechanism provided a simple visual means for participants to keep track of their efforts with participants appreciating the importance of such features : it gives [ me ] nice visuals .
sometimes it 's hard to visualize exactly what a cigarette means but the bars help you visualize it. others felt the impact even more stating that : it does help [ motivate me ] ...
especially with willpower .
participants also reported a sense of commitment and duty toward the goals of the app : it feels like i 've committed to this , so i am more motivated to try and make it work. with some this commitment was often expressed through some sense of guilt when they smoked : when i smoked it 's like cheating ...
you betray yourself when you press the button ...
now when i think about it i feel horrendously guilty [ when i smoked ] .
this commitment was more common among users of the gamified intervention with only 1 participant expressing commitment in the nongamified cohort , but 4 expressing this feeling in the gamified cohort in week 1 interviews .
prime theory states that in the context of smoking cessation , an intention or commitment is required before an individual can be motivated to change their behavior [ 24 ] .
driver 3 - association participants began to associate the act of smoking with the mhealth interventions with a participant explicitly voicing this : the app helped me create an associated between app and smoking .
another user went further to explain the change in his habit with the following : my routine has changed now , when i get my cigarette out i automatically get my phone out as well now .
the app has become integrated into my smoking .
the five modifiers of mhealth interventions .
extant knowledge : the usefulness of information provided was inversely proportional to the user 's existing knowledge .
user 's persistently commented on meaninglessness of repeated information : all this information is out there already ; i need something with more information [ that is not known by me ] .
ease of use : perceived simplicity increased engagement .
the less convenient and simple the app was to use the lower the level of engagement of the user : [ it 's ] impractical , when you reach for a cigarette the last thing you 're thinking about is pulling out your phone and update the app ...
you 've made your decision and you 're over that dilemma .
aesthetics : an attractive app design increased engagement with participants specifically mentioning unenticing visuals : [ it is ] difficult to engage in the app due to poor presentation and poor visuals .
initial motivation : the app was not able to change behavior if the user did not already possess the initial motivation to quit .
this was a key point mentioned across all data sources as described in the following statement : if i was on the path of trying to quit and desperately trying [ to quit ] then the game would help me , but due to not being in that mindset it did not [ help me ] .
physical distraction : the apps could act only as a supplementary tool in smoking cessation , as it was not able to address the physical side of the smoking habit .
as is explained when one user said : i chew some chewing gum ...[ it ] just gives me something to do with my mouth .
this phenomenon reflects pavlov 's theory of classical conditioning , whereby the instinctive , unconditioned stimulus ( the urge to smoke ) is paired with a new , conditioned stimulus ( drawing for the app ) [ 25 ] .
however , it is important to note that merely forming an association between smoking and the app was in itself insufficient to change health behavior .
in order to do so , it should be paired with intrinsic motivation as was emphasised by our expert interviews .
prof nicholson stated : if the app has n't built up intrinsic motivation and the user has n't found their own motivation to continue , then the health behavior will revert if there is no intrinsic motivation .
modifiers common to the mhealth applications we identified 5 modifiers of the mhealth interventions as shown in textbox 1 .
drivers and modifiers of gamified mhealth interventions driver 1 : perceived behavioral control our data indicated that breaking down challenges of changing health behavior into smaller milestones , helped to increase the perceived behavioural control ( pbc ) of the individual by increasing their control beliefs , illustrated in the following : if the end goal is just to quit smoking it makes it so hard , but if you have a game it enthuses the idea of something to work towards and it can steadily reward or punish you by setting short term goals ...
it has been further suggested that ' flow ' might be involved in shifting the locus of control from external to internal regulation , explaining how gamification might impact control beliefs and subsequently , pbc [ 26,27 ] .
achievements and rewards stimulated self - efficacy by providing a feedback mechanism , and thus a form of performance monitoring [ 28 ] .
in this way , the conditional rewards would reinforce positive health behavior and in turn serve as a conditioned stimulus [ 29,30 ] ; illustrated with the following users' statements : the ( achievements ) felt good ...
achieving something ...
makes you feel like you can do it. it constantly reminds you , it 's like going on a streak , you feel proud of yourself .
the game ( achievements ) showed that i can resist sometimes and proved that i can resist .
participants exhibited anxiety at the prospect of going down a level if they were to smoke a concept known as loss aversion [ 31 ] : it 's so annoying when you go down a level , i want to go up not down .
i did n't think much about gaining levels but i really did not want to lose levels .
it is essential to balance loss aversion against the possibility of negatively impacting self - efficacy by going down a level , and consequently reducing pbc .
pbc was also impacted by external influences , namely local networks ( family , friends , and near acquaintances ) .
if they did not support the idea of smoking cessation , it decreased self - efficacy , and thus pbc .
he [ my husband ] actually thinks that it 's possibly not the best time to do it [ quit ] because i have my exams coming in ...
so not go without any because ...
you 're going back to cigarettes .
this produced a negative effect as they discouraged the use of the intervention .
therefore , the local network had a profound effect in defining the level of perceived self - efficacy and their involvement should be minimized .
driver 2 : intrinsic motivation participants using the gamified intervention demonstrated greater levels of motivation and subsequent engagement than the nongamified cohort .
game elements such as rewards and level progression acted as motivational affordances leading to engagement .
participants in the nongamified cohort specifically mentioned game components with statements echoing the following quote : " if you put anything into a game it makes it more fun , and achieving something makes it more fun. " self - determination theory defines intrinsic motivation as ' an activity one does because it is inherently enjoyable ' and extrinsic motivation as ' doing something because it leads to a separable outcome ' [ 32 ] .
the motivational effectiveness of extrinsic rewards will reduce over time ; in the context of smoking this increases the likelihood of relapse as engagement decreases [ 33 ] .
however , intrinsic motivation leads to increased frequency of behavior , and therefore increased engagement with the app [ 34 ] .
intrinsic motivation was also impacted by external influences .
if local networks supported the idea of smoking cessation , participants were more likely to receive words of encouragement regarding their progress .
studies have shown positive feedback to be associated with smoking cessation , with the reverse also being true [ 35 ] .
however , although words of encouragement from peers can lead to positive behavior change in the short term , the effects are unlikely to be lasting if the encouragement is not self - relevant .
reliance on extrinsic rewards , which create a sense of duty , should be avoided ; especially if they are perceived as controlling : the pressure does not help , you do n't want to be told what to do , you want to do it on your own merit and i want to quit when i want to. it feels very parental and ... having people shove their own ideas down my throat as if i am not aware of what i am doing is very patronizing .
any such rewards will undermine the game and impact negatively on intrinsic motivation , thereby compromising engagement [ 32,36 ] .
modifiers of gamified mhealth interventions there are 7 modifiers that have determined the strength of the drivers specific to gamification : ( 1 ) personalization , ( 2 ) meaningful framing , ( 3 ) challenge - ability balance , ( 4 ) unpredictability , ( 5 ) user - centered design , ( 6 ) fun , and ( 7 ) social community .
personalization participants cited that achievements of the gamified intervention lacked self - relevance : " smoking is personal and should not have premade incentives , people should generate their own incentives and the app should empower [ them ]." the orientation of the individual affects how they will perceive extrinsic rewards ; whether they perceive it as controlling ( externally oriented ) , or informational ( internally oriented ) [ 32 ] .
an element of personalization can tailor an intervention to the individual , and thus account for an externally oriented user .
meaningful framing framing a challenge in a meaningful way works synergistically with the gamified reward system to enhance intrinsic motivation [ 37 ] .
challenge - ability balance ensuring a dynamic balance between the participants' perceived ability and the perceived challenge is a core tenet of flow [ 36 ] .
unpredictability participants exhibited tedium after using the gamified intervention for some time , which led to disengagement : " achievements became slightly repetitive and need to be more creative. " however , integrating variable rewards , which are informational and unpredictable in nature has been found to increase focus and engagement [ 38 ] .
in contrast , rewards that are contingent on engagement and performance alone should be minimized as far as possible , where do they not align with the individual 's intrinsic motivation , or they risk undermining it [ 27 ] .
user - centered design ensuring that the user 's needs and goals are the primary consideration at every stage of the process [ 39 ] .
fun a common request from participants in the nongamified cohort was to add an element of fun to the game : " if it was a game with milestones and achievements and levels it would definitely be really cool ...
if it was a game i would definitely do that. " fun can be defined as a type of intrinsic motivation that may play an important role in achieving a state of flow [ 40 ] .
it is important to note that ' fun ' is the product of the relationship between an activity and an individual 's goals , rather than solely as a property of the activity itself .
social community users were unwilling to share their progress via facebook and twitter. with multiple participants sharing the sentiment in the following quote : " i actually think it [ sharing on social media ] is counterproductive .
you do it for yourself , not other people. " however , they expressed desire to interact with like - minded individuals , with whom they could better relate .
kwon et al [ 41 ] reinforced these observations when they found that the motivations for social networking , and the motivations for building up reputation were not mutually exclusive .
discussion framework in this study , we compared 2 apps , 1 gamified and the other nongamified , in a longitudinal qualitative study and then analyzed our findings in the context of expert opinions and the extant literature .
we sought to establish how best to exploit gamification as an effective tool to build and maintain engagement of mhealth apps designed to promote smoking cessation .
this work culminated in the development of a framework to isolate the drivers and factors that govern effective gamification ( figure 4 ) .
the framework suggests that a change in health behavior is dependent on the degree of engagement with the gamified intervention and that this was influenced by ' critical factors' and ' drivers' of game engagement .
figure 4 how positive health behavior can be promoted by the gamification of mhealth apps .
critical factors critical factors were the 3 components that had to be present in order for users to engage with the game ; absence of any one of these critical factors would lead to disengagement .
a mhealth app looking to promote positive health behavior change needs a ' purpose ' that is made explicit and clear to the user .
however , this ' purpose ' needs to align with the user 's own personal objective (' user alignment ') .
this ' user alignment ' is key to tapping into the user 's intrinsic motivation , ensuring sustained engagement with the intervention as explained by both experts and users alike .
the final critical factor is ' functional utility ' or the perceived ability of the intervention to fulfil the needs and solve the problems of the participant .
this was the most frequently coded code during the thematic analysis , with 39 % ( 39 / 100 ) of codes referring to at least 1 of game or app functional utility .
we found that when users' perceived functional utility of the intervention was low , they became disengaged .
to enhance functional utility , the intervention needs to be easy to use , designed around the user , and integrate a feedback mechanism to allow users to track their progress .
drivers we identified ' perceived behavioral control ' and ' intrinsic motivation ' as positive drivers , which when present , directly led to game engagement .
in the context of health behavior , game engagement can be maximized by taking advantage of modifiers that boost self - efficacy and minimize control beliefs .
we also observed intrinsic motivation to be a principal driver of game engagement , and should be maximized , by using the modifiers in the presence of the 3 critical factors .
the impact of positive drivers is determined by factors in the framework classed as modifiers .
we identified 7 modifiers of gamified mhealth interventions : ( 1 ) personalisation : challenges and rewards that are self - relevant , ( 2 ) meaningful framing : link the challenge of changing health behavior to an overall self - relevant goal , ( 3 ) challenge - ability balance : a dynamic balance must exist between the perceived ability and perceived challenge , ( 4 ) unpredictability : unexpected rewards are perceived as least controlling types of rewards , ( 5 ) user - centered design : ensuring the user 's needs and goals are constantly met , ( 6 ) fun : the experience must be innately enjoyable , and ( 7 ) social community : create a community of like - minded individuals , where posting accolades will boost an individual 's reputation .
we also identified ' external social influence ' as a negative driver , which should therefore be minimized to optimally promote positive health behavior .
we observed that the presence of an external social influence negatively impacted self - efficacy and consequently decreased the individual 's perceived behavioral control and intrinsic motivation .
for emphasis , ' external social influence ' has been depicted to directly impact game engagement , although it does this by impairing the user 's pbc and intrinsic motivation .
applicability of the framework our aim is for our framework to be used as a guide for health care professionals and app developers in appraising whether a gamified app has the right ingredients to be successful in generating and promoting positive health behavior change .
the successful implementation of gamified mhealth interventions will require a multidisciplinary approach , marrying input from clinicians , behavioral scientists , and game designers to build compelling apps [ 42 ] .
as such , a further application of this framework is to provide a theoretical basis around which the multidisciplinary teams could collaborate .
limitations limitations to our study mainly relate to the infancy of gamification as a field , meaning only a limited number of interventions were available to us. although the gamified intervention was identified as one of the leading apps implementing game mechanics , it fell short in a number of areas leading to a drop in engagement over time .
however , it is unclear whether this was due to shortcomings solely within the app , or gamification itself .
in order to fully understand the effect of a gamified intervention , we would have benefited from a more optimal implementation of gamification as well as testing interventions employing a wider range of game elements reflecting the variety of gamification strategies employed by different health apps .
moreover , while we tried to choose 2 apps that employed the same intervention content , bar the presence of gamified features in one and the absence in the other , there may well be some confounding variables responsible for our results that we were unable to identify in our analysis .
to combat this , a further study would be required involving the creation , from scratch , of 2 interventions offering the same educational content and differing only by the use of gamified features .
in addition , we were unable to examine the long - term impact of gamification beyond the 5 - week study period .
a more representative analysis of the overall smoking demographic could have been conducted with the inclusion of the diseased population and a larger sample of smokers from different geographical and socioeconomic contexts .
a larger sample may also help to better elucidate the scale of the findings we present in the framework , for instance the extent to which external social influences result in a truly negative effect and whether there are instances where they may bolster an individual 's intrinsic motivation for example .
policy implications of implanting gamification in the national health service offering individuals a gamified mhealth intervention for smoking cessation could be the answer to the inability of current nhs smoking cessation services to serve the population , particularly for millennials who have grown up as ' digital natives' [ 43 ] .
a gamified mhealth intervention would confer the benefits of evidence - based behavioral therapy , while transforming the expensive interface of patient - doctor consultations , to one between patients and an app .
furthermore , the intervention will always be close at hand to the user helping to provide support when high - risk situations arise .
gamified mhealth interventions should not be used in isolation , but rather be considered as an additional tool in the delivery of health care .
for example , implementation among older , less technologically competent patients will prove challenging , with certain patients still favoring human - human interaction .
as such , it will be important to continue to offer conventional behavioral support alongside a new intervention to optimize the effectiveness of the service .
conclusions gamification holds the potential for low - cost , highly effective mhealth solutions that may replace or supplement the behavioral support component found in current smoking cessation programs .
our proposed framework has been built on evidence specific to smoking cessation .
we propose that it can also be extended to pave the way toward new methods of public health education , as our findings showed that gamification could be an effective modality for engaging people with the provision of information .
however , questions still remain in relation to the long - term effects of gamification .
future research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the above framework against current behavioral interventions in smoking cessation .

background c - terminal tensin - like protein ( cten ) is a focal adhesion protein originally identified as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer .
it has since been found to be overexpressed and function as an oncogene in numerous other cancers , but the expression status of cten in melanoma is still unknown .
methods using tissue microarrays containing 562 melanocytic lesions , we evaluated cten protein expression by immunohistochemistry .
the association between cten expression and patient survival was examined using kaplan - meier survival analysis , and univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were used to estimate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios .
results strong cten expression was detected in 7 % , 24 % , 41 % , and 46 % of normal nevi , dysplastic nevi , primary melanoma , and metastatic melanoma samples , respectively , and cten expression was found to be significantly higher in dysplastic nevi compared to normal nevi ( p = 0.046 ) , and in primary melanoma compared to dysplastic nevi ( p = 0.003 ) , but no difference was observed between metastatic and primary melanoma .
cten staining also correlated with ajcc stages ( p = 0.015 ) and primary tumor thickness ( p = 0.002 ) , with cten expression being induced in the transition from thin (< 1mm ) to thick (>= 1mm ) melanomas .
strong cten expression was significantly associated with a worse 5 - year overall ( p = 0.008 ) and disease - specific survival ( p = 0.004 ) for primary melanoma patients , and multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that cten expression was an independent prognostic marker for these patients ( p = 0.038 for overall survival ; p = 0.021 for disease - specific survival ) .
conclusion our findings indicate that induction of cten protein expression is a relatively early event in melanoma progression , and that cten has the potential to serve as a prognostic marker for primary melanoma patients .

background cutaneous malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer with a steadily increasing rate of incidence in the non - hispanic white population throughout the world [ 1 - 3 ] , with the highest incidence rates observed in australian and new zealand males [ 1,2 ] .
although melanoma accounts for less than 5 % of all skin cancers , it is responsible for the majority of all skin cancer - related deaths .
malignant melanoma is a highly invasive malignancy , and due to its high metastatic potential , the median survival for patients diagnosed with distant metastases is only 6 - 8 months , with an overall 5 - year survival rate as low as 5 - 16 % [ 3 - 5 ] .
however , if the primary tumor is found and surgically removed before metastasis has occurred , the 5 - year survival rate is approaching 100 % [ 3,5 ] , demonstrating the importance of early detection , diagnosis , and prognosis .
when used in combination with traditional prognostic markers , proteins that are differentially expressed during tumorigenesis could help create more reliable prognoses .
yet , despite numerous tissue biomarkers having already been identified for melanoma , currently none are routinely used clinically to improve risk stratification [ 6 ] , indicating a growing demand to identify dependable prognostic tissue markers for this disease .
c - terminal tensin - like protein ( cten ) is a novel focal adhesion protein belonging to the tensin family of proteins together with tensin - 1 , tensin - 2 , and tensin - 3 , and is hence also sometimes referred to as tensin - 4 [ 7 ] .
all tensin family members contain c - terminal src homology 2 ( sh2 ) and phosphotyrosine - binding ( ptb ) domains , but unlike tensin1 - 3 , which all contain an n - terminal actin binding domain ( abd ) , cten does not [ 8 ] .
the protein expression pattern of cten appears to be highly tissue - dependent , with high expression levels found in the prostate , in which it was first identified a decade ago as a potential tumor suppressor , and placenta , with no , or relatively low , expression reported for all other normal tissues [ 8 ] .
since its initial discovery , several studies have examined the expression status of cten in a number of cancers , with somewhat conflicting results .
whereas cten appears to be down - regulated in prostate and kidney cancers [ 8,9 ] , it has been found to be up - regulated and proposed to function as an oncogene in thymomas , lung , gastric , colorectal , breast , and pancreatic cancers [ 10 - 16 ] .
the status of cten expression in melanoma is currently unknown , and hence we were interested in examining this .
using immunohistochemical staining and tissue microarrays ( tmas ) containing 29 normal nevi ( nn ) , 88 dysplastic nevi ( dn ) , 297 primary melanomas ( pm ) , and 148 metastatic melanomas ( mm ) , we examined the expression profile of cten in melanoma progression , as well as the correlation between cten expression and melanoma patient survival , and other clinicopathological characteristics .
our data showed that cten was expressed significantly higher in dysplastic nevi compared to normal nevi , and in primary melanomas compared to dysplastic nevi , but that there was no difference between primary and metastatic melanomas , indicating that cten expression is induced in the early stages of melanoma progression , rather than during metastasis .
furthermore , strong cten expression was significantly associated with a poorer overall and disease - specific 5 - year survival , and was an independent prognostic marker , for primary melanoma patients .
materials and methods ethics statement all aspects of this study , including the use of human tissues and the waiver of patient consent , were performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki guidelines , as approved by the clinical research ethics board of the university of british columbia , vancouver , canada .
tma construction 748 formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tissues were obtained from vancouver general hospital , department of pathology , between 1992 and 2009 .
tissues with insufficient tumor cells or lost cores were excluded from the study , resulting in a total of 562 tissues available for evaluation , including 29 normal nevi , 88 dysplastic nevi , 297 primary melanomas , and 148 metastatic melanomas .
the tmas were assembled using a tissue - array instrument ( beecher instruments , silver spring , md ) , and duplicate 0.6mm thick tissue cores were taken from each biopsied tissue .
multiple 4mum sections were cut using a leica microtome ( leica microsystems inc. , bannockburn , il ) , and transferred to adhesive - coated slides using standard procedures. from each tma set , one section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin as per standard protocol , and the remaining sections were reserved for immunohistochemical staining .
immunohistochemistry of tma the tma slides were deparaffinized by heating at 55degreesc for 20 minutes followed by three 5 - minute washes with xylene , and rehydrated by consecutive 5 - minute washes in 100 % , 95 % and 80 % ethanol , and distilled water .
antigen retrieval was accomplished by heating the samples at 95degreesc in 10 mm sodium citrate at ph 6.0 for 30 minutes .
endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation of the slides in 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes .
the tissues were blocked with dako antibody diluent ( dako diagnostics , glostrup , denmark ) for 30 minutes to prevent non - specific binding , followed by incubation with a primary mouse monoclonal anti - cten antibody ( clone 684524 , 1:50 dilution , r & d systems , minneapolis , mn ) overnight at 4degreesc .
incubation in the antibody diluent without the primary antibody served as the negative control .
a small subset of metastatic melanoma samples ( n = 10 ) was stained with a second primary monoclonal anti - cten antibody ( clone sp83 , 1:100 dilution , abnova , walnut , ca ) to determine if the results obtained from our main study were reproducible .
next , the samples were incubated with a universal biotinylated secondary antibody followed by streptavidin - hrp ( dako diagnostics ) for 30 minutes each , and developed using 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine substrate ( vector laboratories , burlington , on , canada ) .
lastly , hematoxylin counterstaining was performed to visualize the nuclei , and the slides were dehydrated and sealed with cover slips .
evaluation of immunostaining cten staining was evaluated and scored based on intensity of staining ( 0 - 3 ) and percentage of cten - positive cells [ 1 ( 0 - 25 % ; 2 ( 26 - 50 %) ; 3 ( 51 - 75 %) ; and 4 ( 76 - 100 %)] by two independent observers , who were blinded to other clinical data .
the level of staining was calculated by multiplying the intensity score and the percentage of staining , and was identified as : negative ( 0 ) ; weak ( 1 - 3 ) ; moderate ( 4 - 6 ) ; and strong ( 8 - 12 ) .
in the event of two duplicate cores having different staining , the higher score of the two was used for statistical analysis .
cten expression was defined as being either negative to moderate ( neg - mod ; 0 - 6 ) or strong ( 8 - 12 ) , based on the level of staining .
statistical analysis differences in demographic and clinicopathological characteristics , and cten expression between subgroups were evaluated by chi2 tests ( degrees of freedom ( df ) = 1 , unless otherwise stated ) .
kaplan - meier and log - rank tests were used to evaluate the correlation between cten expression and overall and disease - specific 5 - year survival outcomes for melanoma patients .
univariate and multivariate cox regression analyses were used to determine the crude and adjusted hazard ratios , respectively , and their 95 % confidence intervals .
for all tests , a p - value < 0.05 was considered significant .
spss version 16.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il ) software was used for all analyses .
results clinicopathological features of tmas tmas containing 29 normal nevi , 88 dysplastic nevi , 297 primary melanoma , and 148 metastatic melanoma were evaluated for cten staining .
figure s1 shows the inclusion and exclusion of patient samples .
for the 445 melanoma cases , there were 263 males and 182 females , with a median age of 60 ( ranging between 7 and 95 years ) .
a total of 170 tumors were classified as ajcc stage i , 127 as stage ii , 62 as stage iii , and 83 as stage iv melanomas .
three samples lacked information regarding ajcc stage .
for primary melanoma , the tumors were sub - classified as acral lentiginous ( n = 9 ) , desmoplastic ( n = 11 ) , lentigo maligna ( n = 63 ) , nodular ( n = 44 ) , superficial spreading ( n = 109 ) and other ( unclassified , spitz - like , and nevoid , n = 61 ) melanomas. of these , 83 tumors were biopsied from the head and neck , and 211 from other , sun - protected sites .
99 of the primary tumors were < 1mm or in situ , 73 tumors were 1 - < 2mm , 64 were 2 - 4mm , and 61 were > 4mm thick .
ulceration was present in 53 cases .
for metastatic melanoma , 64 tumors were cutaneous , 55 were biopsied from lymph nodes , and 26 were obtained from visceral organs , while 3 samples lacked information about the location of the metastatic deposit ( table 1 ) .

samples lacking information about the location of metastasis ( n = 3 ) were excluded from the study cten expression is increased during melanoma development as seen in figure 1a - h , cten was expressed in the cytoplasm at all stages of melanocytic lesions , and staining with a second primary anti - cten antibody in a small subset of tumors supported these results ( figure s2 ) .
strong cten staining was observed in 7 % , 24 % , 41 % , and 46 % of normal nevi , dysplastic nevi , primary melanoma , and metastatic melanoma samples , respectively .
cten protein expression was found to be significantly higher in dysplastic nevi compared to normal nevi ( p = 0.046 , chi2 test ) , in primary melanoma compared to dysplastic and normal nevi ( p = 0.003 and < 0.001 , respectively , chi2 tests ) , and in metastatic melanoma compared to dysplastic and normal nevi ( p < 0.001 for both , chi2 tests ) , but no significant difference between metastatic and primary melanoma was observed ( p = 0.328 , chi2 test , figure 1i ) .

correlation between cten expression and clinicopathological characteristics strong cten expression was observed in 35 % of ajcc stage i melanomas compared to 47 % of melanomas belonging to ajcc stages ii - iv ( p = 0.015 , chi2 test , figure 2a ) .
for primary melanoma , cten staining was found to be significantly higher in tumors >= 1mm thick ( 47 % strong staining ) , compared to in situ and thin tumors < 1mm ( 28 % strong staining , p = 0.002 , chi2 test , figure 2b ) .
interestingly , we found that cten was expressed at comparable levels in dysplastic nevi ( 24 % strong staining , figure 1i ) and primary tumors < 1mm thick ( 28 % , p = 0.493 , chi2 test ) , and in primary tumors >= 1mm thick ( 47 % strong staining ) and metastatic melanomas ( 46 % , figure 1i , p = 0.850 , chi2 test ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0080492.g002 figure 2 cten expression correlates with ajcc stages and tumor thickness .
( a ) cten staining was significantly increased in ajcc stage ii - iv tumors compared to ajcc stage i tumors ( p = 0.015 , chi2 test ) .
( b ) cten expression was significantly higher in invasive , thick tumors >= 1mm compared to in situ and thin tumors < 1mm ( p = 0.002 , chi2 test ) .
strong cten expression was detected in 61 % of nodular melanomas compared to in only 37 % of all other primary melanoma subtypes ( p = 0.003 , chi2 test ) , and it was also found to be significantly lower expressed in other , mainly unclassified , melanomas ( p = 0.045 , chi2 test ) .
a significant difference in cten expression was furthermore observed between tumors found at sun - protected sites ( 47 % strong staining ) compared to tumors from the head and neck ( 27 % , p = 0.001 , chi2 test ) , whereas no correlation was seen for cten and ulceration status or primary melanoma patient age and sex .
additionally , no correlation between cten expression and patient age and sex , or tumor location for metastatic melanoma patients was detected ( table 1 ) .
correlation between cten expression and 5 - year survival of melanoma patients a total of 418 melanoma patients ( 271 primary melanoma and 147 metastatic melanoma patients ) had complete follow - up and clinical information ( figure s1 ) .
survival times were calculated as time from diagnoses to last follow - ups or death .
kaplan - meier analyses revealed that cten expression was significantly associated with the overall ( p = 0.008 ) and disease - specific ( p = 0.004 ) 5 - year survival for primary melanoma patients ( log - rank tests , figure 3 ) .
as expected , no significant correlation between cten expression and the overall and disease - specific 5 - year survival of all melanoma patients ( p = 0.079 and 0.072 , respectively ) or metastatic melanoma patients ( p = 0.434 and 0.367 , respectively ) was observed ( data not shown ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0080492.g003 figure 3 kaplan - meier analysis for the correlation between cten expression and 5 - year survival in 271 primary melanoma patients .
strong cten expression was significantly associated with a worse overall and disease - specific 5 - year survival for primary melanoma patients ( p = 0.008 and 0.004 , respectively , log - rank tests ) .
since cten expression appeared to be induced in the transition from thin (< 1mm ) to thick (>= 1mm ) melanoma ( figure 2b ) , we next examined whether there were any differences in patient survival between these groups .
figure 4a shows the association between tumor thickness and primary melanoma patient survival ( p < 0.001 for both overall and disease - specific 5 - year survival ) .
when cten expression was included in the analysis , we observed a significant difference in the 5 - year survival of melanoma patients with tumors >= 1mm thick , with strong cten expression being associated with a poorer survival outcome ( p = 0.031 and 0.022 for overall and disease - specific survival , respectively ) , but no correlation between cten and patient survival was observed for tumors < 1mm thick ( p = 0.939 and 0.857 for overall and disease - specific survival , respectively , p < 0.001 overall , log - ranks tests , figure 4b ) .
it is worth noting however , that the number of deaths in this category was very low , so no firm conclusions about the association between cten and patient survival can be made for this group without repeating the experiment in a larger study .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0080492.g004 figure 4 kaplan - meier analyses for the correlations between primary tumor thickness , cten expression , and patient survival .
( a ) tumors >= 1mm thick ( n = 192 ) were significantly associated with a poorer overall and disease - specific survival for primary melanoma patients compared to tumors < 1mm thick ( n = 79 , p < 0.001 for both , log - rank tests ) .
( b ) strong cten staining was significantly associated with a poorer overall and disease - specific 5 - year survival for patients with tumors >= 1mm thick ( black lines , p = 0.031 and 0.022 , respectively ) but not with tumors < 1mm thick ( gray lines , p = 0.939 and 0.857 , respectively ) .
a significant difference was also observed between tumors < 1mm thick with neg - mod cten expression and tumors >= 1mm thick with neg - mod ( p = 0.014 and 0.009 , respectively ) or strong cten expression ( p = 0.001 and < 0.001 , respectively ) , and between tumors < 1mm thick with strong cten expression and tumors >= 1mm thick with strong cten expression ( p = 0.007 for both ) , but not between tumors < 1mm thick with strong cten expression and tumors >= 1mm with neg - mod cten expression ( p = 0.085 and 0.098 , respectively , p < 0.001 overall , log - rank tests ) .
cten is an independent prognostic marker for primary melanoma patients univariate cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that strong cten expression was a significant prognostic factor for primary melanoma patients (( hr , 1.89 , 95 % ci , 1.17 - 3.05 , p = 0.009 ) for overall survival , and ( hr , 2.03 , 95 % ci , 1.24 - 3.30 , p = 0.005 ) for disease - specific survival , table 2 ) .
lastly , we used multivariate cox regression analysis to examine if cten was also an independent prognostic marker for primary melanoma patient survival .
sex , age , tumor thickness , ulceration status , tumor location , and cten expression were included in the analysis , and the results indicated that cten was an adverse independent prognostic factor for the overall ( hr , 1.69 , 95 % ci , 1.03 - 2.77 , p = 0.038 ) and disease - specific 5 - year survival of primary melanoma patients ( hr , 1.82 , 95 % ci , 1.10 - 3.01 , p = 0.021 , table 3 ) .

discussion even though cten was first identified as a potential tumor suppressor in prostate cancer [ 8 ] , it has since been reported to function as an oncogene in numerous other cancers , but the mechanisms behind this remain controversial [ 10 - 16 ] .
since the status of cten in melanoma is currently unknown , we here investigated the protein expression of cten in a large number of human melanocytic lesions as a first step to elucidate its role in melanomagenesis .
we detected exclusively cytoplasmic cten staining ( figure 1a - h ) , and despite of cten originally being described as a focal adhesion protein [ 8 ] , we did not distinguish a clear focal adhesion pattern .
staining with a second primary anti - cten antibody in a small subset of tissues yielded comparable results , and supported these findings ( figure s2 ) .
similarly , in breast and colorectal cancers , the immunohistochemical staining pattern of cten has been described as homogenous cytoplasmic , with no samples displaying focal adhesion staining [ 15,17 ] .
nuclear expression of cten was also reported in a fraction of colorectal cancer samples [ 14,17 ] , but it is likely that this discrepancy represents yet another tissue - specific characteristic of cten , since to our knowledge , this has not been reported in any other types of cancer , and does not seem to have any clinical significance [ 17 ] .
cten protein expression was significantly increased in the progression from melanocytic nevi to primary melanoma , but no difference in cten staining between primary and metastatic melanomas was detected in this study ( figure 1i ) .
we next separated the primary tumors into four groups based on their thickness ( figure 2b ) , and found that while cten was expressed at comparable levels in primary tumors < 1mm thick ( 28 % strong staining , figure 2b ) and dysplastic nevi ( 24 % strong staining , figure 1i ) , cten expression was significantly increased in tumors >= 1mm thick ( 45 % , 44 % and 53 % strong staining for tumors 1 - < 2mm , 2 - 4mm , and > 4mm thick , respectively , figure 2b ) .
likewise , the expression level of cten in metastatic melanoma samples ( 46 % strong staining , figure 1i ) was similar to that of primary tumors >= 1mm thick ( 47 % strong staining , figure 2b ) , and no significant difference was seen between cutaneous , lymph nodal or visceral metastatic melanomas ( table 1 ) , or between ajcc stage iii and stage iv melanomas ( figure 2a ) , indicating that cten expression is likely induced during the transition from thin (< 1mm ) to thick (>= 1mm ) melanomas rather than during metastasis .
accordingly , cten expression was significantly higher in tumors classified as ajcc stages ii - iv compared to ajcc stage i tumors ( figure 2a ) .
to investigate the role of cten in melanoma patient survival , we constructed kaplan - meier survival curves .
analyses showed that strong cten expression significantly correlated with a poorer overall and disease - specific 5 - year survival for primary melanoma patients ( p = 0.008 , and 0.004 , respectively , figure 3 ) .
these data are similar to what has been previously observed in gastric , breast and colorectal cancers [ 12,15,17 ] .
subsequent multivariate cox regression analysis showed that strong cten expression , when adjusted to sex , age , tumor thickness , location and status of ulceration , was an adverse independent prognostic factor for the overall ( hr , 1.69 , 95 % ci , 1.03 - 2.77 , p = 0.038 ) and disease - specific ( hr , 1.82 , 95 % ci , 1.10 - 3.01 , p = 0.021 ) 5 - year survival of primary melanoma patients ( table 3 ) .
while there are already numerous tissue biomarkers identified for melanoma [ 6 ] , many of these strongly correlate with breslow 's thickness - one of the most significant prognostic markers for primary melanoma patient survival [ 18 ] .
cten is no exception , and we here showed that cten was significantly stronger expressed in tumors >= 1mm compared to tumors < 1mm thick ( figure 2b ) , and that strong cten expression was significantly associated with a poorer survival specifically in patients with tumors >= 1mm thick ( figure 4b ) .
however , our survival analysis also showed that even though there was a trend , there was no significant difference in patient survival between tumors < 1mm thick with strong cten staining and tumors >= 1mm thick with negative - moderate cten staining ( figure 4b ) , and by including the same cut - offs for tumor thickness into our multivariate analysis ( table 3 ) , we demonstrated that cten was a significant prognostic factor for primary melanoma patient survival , independent of tumor thickness .
this , together with the fact that cten appears to have a highly restricted expression pattern in most normal tissues [ 8 ] , suggests that it could have the potential to one day be used clinically as a prognostic marker .
while it is currently unclear exactly how cten is activated and regulated , there seem to be multiple pathways involved .
intriguingly , strong cten expression has been associated with kras / braf mutations in colorectal cancer , and this association was confirmed as being functionally relevant in colorectal and pancreatic cancers , where cten has been identified as a downstream target of kras signaling [ 19 ] .
unlike in colorectal cancer however , where kras mutations have been described in 34 - 42 % of all tumors , kras mutations in melanoma are rarely observed [ 20 - 23 ] .
braf mutations on the other hand , especially the v600e point mutation , have been observed in over half of all melanomas [ 24,25 ] , and if there is a correlation between braf mutations and cten expression in melanoma as well , and if cten is in fact an oncoprotein , it could provide an attractive additional target for therapeutic intervention .
in support of these findings , hung et al .
( 2013 ) recently reported that cten expression was induced by a number of growth factors , including egf and fgf2 , via the mapk pathway in prostate and colon cancer cell lines [ 26 ] .
however , whether this is also the case in melanoma , or whether cten induction is the result of other signaling cascades , will have to be examined in more detail before any conclusions about the regulation and function of cten in melanomagenesis can be drawn .
in summary , we here found that cten expression was significantly increased in the progression from nevi to primary melanoma , with the most drastic increases in cten expression being observed between normal and dysplastic nevi , and between primary tumors < 1mm thick and tumors >= 1mm thick , indicating that cten induction is a relatively early event in melanoma progression .
moreover , we found that strong cten expression was associated with a significantly worse 5 - year survival , and was an adverse independent prognostic marker , for primary melanoma patients .
although this study would have to be repeated with an even larger set of samples for any firm conclusions to be drawn , these preliminary results support the use of cten as a potential prognostic marker for primary melanoma patients , and warrant for further studies into the function of this protein in melanomagenesis .

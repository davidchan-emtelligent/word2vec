evs can be found in a plethora of body fluids and are known to carry both vesicle as well as parental cell specific proteins .
the content of the particles is dependant on the stimulation and / or micro - environment surrounding the donor cell .
content analyses reveal the presence of proteins involved in targeting , adhesion , membrane trafficking , signal transduction , chaperones , enzymes and functional mrna and mirna , with particle release being a highly regulated process induced by biological , chemical or mechanical stimuli .
evs play a functional role in immune responses providing both activating and suppressive signals to target cells .
this is exemplified by the fact vesicles from pma - differentiated thp - 1 cells have been shown to induce naive thp - 1 cell differentiation .
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( sjia ) is a subtype of childhood arthritis that is characterized by its systemic manifestations , severe symptoms and , on a cellular level , polarization of monocytes to a pro - or anti - inflammatory phenotype depending on the active / remissive state of the patient .
objectives evs are biological vectors , carrying important messages from one cell to another .
we aimed to develop a system in which the influence of sjia patient plasma vesicles could be analyzed in order to determine their influence on monocyte differentiation and phenotype .
methods thp1 cells where cultured and differentiated into macrophages .
upon differentiation into macrophages , cells where further skewed toward a pro - or anti - inflammatory phenotype .
vesicles where subsequently harvested from the culture supernatant of differentiated cells and placed on undifferentiated thp1 or m0 macrophages .
cytokine production and cell surface markers were used as read out for cell differentiation .
results upon polarization , elevated cd80 signified m1 differentiation while ccl22 was upregulated in m2 - polarized macrophages .
vesicles harvested from m1 - polarized macrophages skewed naive macrophages towards an m1 phenotype while m2 vesicles may skew macrophages towards a more regulatory phenotype .
conclusion data provides evidence towards the functional role of evs in macrophage differentiation. by optimizing our system , this model could be used to analyze the function and activity of evs in sjia , allowing us to determine the influence of these particles on disease pathology and possibly inferring the future active or remissive state of a patient .

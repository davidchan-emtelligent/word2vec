repeated - sprint ability recovery neuromuscular fatigue neural drive sprint - matching in team sports , game decisive events are often reliant on transient repeated - sprint ability ( rsa ) , which refers to the ability to produce the best possible average sprint performance over a series of sprints (< 10 s ) , separated by short (< 60 s ) recovery periods ( bishop et al. , 2011 ) .
researches on rsa , particularly focusing on factors contributing to fatigue ( girard et al. , 2011 ) and interventions ( e.g. , training , ergogenic aids , altitude ) likely to improve this fitness component ( bishop et al. , 2011 ; billaut et al. , 2013 ) , are undergoing unprecedented popularity .
although differences exist in terms of sprint duration ( 4 - 10 s ) or distance ( 10 - 40 m ) and recovery time ( 10 - 30 s ) or nature ( passive or active ) between rsa protocols , a single set of 5 - 15 maximal " all - out " efforts ( i.e. , close - loop design ) is generally used to assess performance or fatigue resistance .
compared to time trials ( i.e. , possibility to constantly adjust mechanical performance ) or time to exhaustion tasks ( i.e. , option of voluntarily ending exercise ; open - loop design ) , one advantage of the rsa test model is to circumvent the confounding effects associated with pacing. with the repetition of maximal efforts , muscle fatigue develops ( i.e. , reversible decline in muscle force production ) , arising from a complex interaction between muscular perturbations and neural adjustments so that no singular isolated factor likely represents a direct causative mechanism explaining the rate of decline in peak sprint speed ( running ) or peak / mean power output ( cycling ) during rsa protocols ( girard et al. , 2011 ) .
in addition to large perturbations in peripheral physiological state with repeated sprinting , when substantial fatigue levels are incurred ( i.e. , sprint decrement score > 10 %) , reductions in mechanical performance and in the amplitude of quadriceps emg signals [ root mean square ( rms ) activity ] often coincide , implying that motor unit activity ( i.e. , a decrease in recruitment ; firing rate ; or both ) may also become suboptimal ( mendez - villanueva et al. , 2008 ; girard et al. , 2011 ; brocherie et al. , 2014 ) .
very recently , rsa investigations have been conducted under elevated environmental stress ( heat or hypoxia ) or where the degree of fatigue at exercise start was manipulated to more thoroughly understand the nature of the underlying mechanisms .
the consistent finding was that acute moderate hypoxia ( i.e. , a fraction of inspired oxygen of 13.8 % ; billaut et al. , 2013 ) or the induction of pre - existing locomotor muscle fatigue ( i.e. , following a 10 - min neuromuscular electrical stimulation protocol of the quadriceps ; hureau et al. , 2014 ) caused significant parallel reductions in rms activity of the active musculature and in power output with cycle - sprint repetitions ( i.e. , their magnitudes exceeded those of control situations ) , while the amount of peripheral quadriceps fatigue incurred at exercise termination was similar .
the interpretation was that feedback from fatiguing muscles plays an important role in the determination of central motor drive and force output , so that the development of peripheral muscle fatigue is confined to a certain level ( also referred as a " critical " threshold ) so as not to surpass a sensory tolerance limit .
because the modifications in muscle recruitment patterns are highly influenced by changes in rsa performance , it can be argued that muscle " de - recruitment " with sprint repetitions may not be the cause but rather the consequence of progressive decreases in velocity or power production .
in an effort to resolve this issue , innovative approaches have emerged , either based on the determination of the power - emg relationship during warm - up sprints that are subsequently compared to emg changes during a rsa test ( bishop , 2012 ) or based on the comparison of fatigue responses during two sets of repeated sprints separated by a recovery period ( i.e. , few minutes ) and matched for initial mechanical output ( mendez - villanueva et al. , 2008 ) .
the rationale is to determine whether a disproportionate decrease in neural drive over mechanical performance ( sprint time / power output ) actually occurs during rsa tests .
to delineate the neural and muscular factors driving performance recovery following repeated sprints a sprint - matching paradigm was introduced , where exercise responses during two sets of repeated cycling sprints ( 10 x 6 - s " all out " sprints with 30 s recovery followed after 6 min of passive recovery by five 6 - s sprints ) , matched for initial mechanical output in a " non - fatigued " ( sprints 4 - 8 ) and a " fatigued " state ( sprints 11 - 15 ) , were actually compared ( mendez - villanueva et al. , 2007 ) .
results indicated that there was a greater fatigability in the five repetitions of the second vs. first set , despite mechanical output produced for the initial bout of both sets ( i.e. , sprints 4 and 11 ) being similar .
furthermore , muscle activation was lower (~ 12 %) in sprint 11 than 4 , while the rate of decrease in net emg activity was similar for the two sets of repeated sprints .
taken as a whole , this highlights that the short - term activation history of the active musculature alters the muscle recruitment pattern and fatigability during sets of repeated sprints matched for initial power output .
using the same data set , with the addition of muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis obtained at rest , immediately after the 10 first sprints and after 6 min of recovery it was further demonstrated that phosphocreatine resynthesis was associated with total work done in sprint 11 ( r = 0.79 , p < 0.05 ) and total work done during sprints 11 - 15 ( r = 0.67 , p < 0.05 ) , while emg amplitude remained depressed ( mendez - villanueva et al. , 2013 ) .
the lower performance maintenance during subsequent repeated sprints was mostly mediated by intramuscular factors probably related to limitations in metabolic supply , as also evidenced by the disproportionate ~ 2 - fold greater decrease in total work in relation to rms in the second set of sprints ( sprint 11 - 15 ) than in the first five sprints ( sprint 1 - 5 ) .
in an effort to improve our understanding of fatigue - causing mechanisms during repeated sprinting , we invite multiple - sets rsa studies to carefully evaluate the ensuing recovery rate of single - and multiple - sprint performance and return of neuromuscular markers , with special reference to restoration of central nervous system functioning and of peripheral physiological state .
furthermore , quantifying whether disproportionate decreases in neural drive or in muscle contractility occur over mechanical performance during successive sets of repeated sprints , may help to determine if the attenuation of the emg amplitude is actually the consequence , or the cause , of slower sprint times or reduced power production .
further investigation where environmental stressing conditions could vary across successive sets of repeated sprints and / or during the between - sets intervening recovery periods may assist in clarifying this contention , accepting the premise that an increase in hypoxia severity would alter exercise - induced demands ( and thereby recovery requirements ) on the neuromuscular system .
under this framework , our recent comparison of the effects of an initial set of exhaustive intermittent cycling under normoxia , moderate or severe hypoxia on locomotor performance and quadriceps fatigability , and how recovery from this first exercise bout influence subsequent normoxic performance during the completion of a second set using a similar exercise mode may lead the way ( christian et al. , 2012 ) .
in doing so particular attention should be paid to study perceptual recovery as well , as it may interact with feed - forward / feedback mechanisms to influence athlete preparedness for ensuing exercise bouts ( minett and duffield , 2014 ) .

understanding the protein folding mechanism remains a grand challenge in structural biology .
in the past several years , computational theories in molecular dynamics have been employed to shed light on the folding process .
coupled with high computing power and large scale storage , researchers now can computationally simulate the protein folding process in atomistic details at femtosecond temporal resolution .
such simulation often produces a large number of folding trajectories , each consisting of a series of 3d conformations of the protein under study .
as a result , effectively managing and analyzing such trajectories is becoming increasingly important .
in this article , we present a spatio - temporal mining approach to analyze protein folding trajectories .
it exploits the simplicity of contact maps , while also integrating 3d structural information in the analysis .
it characterizes the dynamic folding process by first identifying spatio - temporal association patterns in contact maps , then studying how such patterns evolve along a folding trajectory .
we demonstrate that such patterns can be leveraged to summarize folding trajectories , and to facilitate the detection and ordering of important folding events along a folding path .
we also show that such patterns can be used to identify a consensus partial folding pathway across multiple folding trajectories .
furthermore , we argue that such patterns can capture both local and global structural topology in a 3d protein conformation , thereby facilitating effective structural comparison amongst conformations .
we apply this approach to analyze the folding trajectories of two small synthetic proteins - bba5 and gsgs ( or beta3s ) .
we show that this approach is promising towards addressing the above issues , namely , folding trajectory summarization , folding events detection and ordering , and consensus partial folding pathway identification across trajectories .
1 background the three dimensional ( 3d ) native structures of proteins have important implications in proteomics .
understanding such structures enables us to explore the function of a protein , explain substrate and ligand binding , perform realistic drug design and potentially cure diseases caused by protein misfolding .
the protein folding problem is therefore one of the most fundamental yet unsolved problems in computational molecular biology .
one major challenge in simulating the protein folding process is its complexity .
snow et al. state that performing a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation on a mini - protein for just 10 mus would require decades of computation time on a typical cpu [ 1 ] .
researchers in the folding @ home project recently proposed a world wide web - based computing model to simulate the protein folding process [ 2 ] .
as the volume of folding trajectories produced from high - throughput simulation tools increases drastically , there is an urgent need to compare , analyze , and manage such data .
previously , researchers have examined several summary statistics ( e.g. radius of gyration , root mean square deviation ( rmsd )) to identify similar 3d conformations in folding trajectories .
although summary statistics are commonly used for comparison , they can only capture biased and limited global properties of the conformation .
recently , russel et al .
[ 3 ] suggested using geometric spanners for mapping a simulation to a more discrete combinatorial representation .
they apply geometric spanners to discover the proximity between different segments of a protein across a range of scales , and track the changes of such proximity over time .
to overcome the difficulties in managing and analyzing the large amount of protein folding simulation data , berrar et al .
[ 4 ] proposed using a data warehouse system .
they embed the warehouse in a grid computing environment to enable data sharing .
they also propose implementing a set of data mining algorithms to facilitate commonly needed data analysis tasks .
in this article , we propose a spatio - temporal mining approach to analyze folding trajectories .
we extend the spatio - temporal data mining framework that we have developed earlier to analyze and manage such data [ 5 ] .
this framework is designed to analyze spatio - temporal data produced in several scientific domains .
previously , we have applied this framework to analyze 8732 proteins taken from the protein data bank to identify structural fingerprints for different protein classes ( e.g. , alpha - proteins ) [ 6 ] .
each protein is associated with a set of objects that are extracted from its contact map .
we then realize the notion of spatial object association pattern ( soap ) to effectively capture spatial relationships among such objects , furthermore , by associating soaps with proteins in different protein classes , we have identified multiple types of soaps that can potentially function as the structural fingerprints for different protein classes .
in this article , we extend such strategies to a new application domain : analyzing and characterizing the folding process of a protein .
clearly , protein folding trajectories consist of both spatial and temporal components .
each protein in a md simulation is composed of a number of residues spatially located in the 3d space that move over time .
each frame ( or snapshot ) of the trajectory can be represented as a 2d contact map , which captures the pair - wise 3d distances between residues .
we extract non - local bit - patterns from these contact maps .
we then use an entropy - based clustering algorithm to cluster such bit - patterns into groups .
these bit - patterns are further associated to form spatial object association patterns ( soaps ). by using soaps , we are able to effectively summarize and analyze folding trajectories produced by md simulations .
a major advantage of this representation is its appropriateness for cross - comparison across different simulations , as discussed in later sections .
compared to our previous work on protein structural analysis [ 6,7 ] , we have made the following contributions : * propose a contact map - based approach to analyze protein folding trajectories : our previous work focused on identifying structural signatures in native conformation of proteins in different classes or folds .
thus , there is no temporal component involved .
in contrast , a folding trajectory has both spatial and temporal components .
in addition , bit - patterns in a folding trajectory will interact with each other and evolve over time .
moreover , the proposed approach also effectively integrates 3d structural information in the overall analysis .
this is critical in understanding the protein folding mechanism .
* map 2d bit - patterns in contact maps with 3d structural motifs : to better understand and explain the biological meaning of the bit - patterns in contact maps , we have made an effort to establish a mapping between such bit - patterns and well - known structural motifs ( e.g. , alpha - helices and beta - turns ) in 3d conformations .
currently , this task is carried out manually .
we are in the process of automating this mapping .
such a 2d - 3d mapping is essential to folding data analysis due to the following reasons : first , to gain insight into the folding process , it is critical to identify the formation of important local 3d motifs such as beta - turns .
second , our previous studies show that by associating multiple bit - patterns in contact maps , one can construct effective structural signatures for different protein classes or folds [ 6 ] .
this leads us to hypothesize that a mapping might exist between 2d bit - patterns in contact maps and 3d local motifs of a protein .
in this work , we validate this hypothesis and report the mapping result later .
finally , such a mapping not only enables one to take advantage of the simplicity of working in the 2d space of contact maps , but also allows one to relate to the 3d space of protein conformations .
this is important in understanding the protein folding process .
* indirectly capture interactions among structural motifs in 3d space : in our previous work , two bit - patterns are considered spatially proximate if they are located in the same vicinity within a 2d contact map .
this is problematic in the context of protein folding , as two bit - patterns can be spatially proximate in a contact map even though their corresponding motifs are distant in the 3d conformation .
( see section 3 for more details. ) we address this issue by considering the 3d distance between two bit - patterns .
* propose novel strategies to analyze protein folding trajectories : we propose several novel strategies to analyze protein folding trajectories based on spatial and spatio - temporal association patterns .
in summary , one can benefit from our mining approach in two main aspects : * effective , informative and scalable representation of folding simulations : we represent each frame by a set of soaps , where each soap in turn characterizes the spatial relationship ( or interactions in the folding case ) among multiple bit - patterns .
soaps are not only easily obtainable but also , as we will show , able to capture folding events along a folding trajectory .
* cross - analysis of trajectories to reveal a consensus partial folding pathway : by representing each frame as a set of soaps , one can carry out analysis across different trajectories .
such analysis includes detecting critical events and identifying consensus partial folding pathways across trajectories .
the remainder of the article is organized as follows .
in section 2 , we describe the two proteins - bba5 and gsgs - and their trajectories produced from computational simulation .
we also identify two main goals to analyze such trajectories .
in section 3 , we present a step - by - step description of our analysis approach .
we next report the empirical results on analyzing the trajectories of the two proteins in section 4 .
we focus on the protein bba5 .
finally we conclude and report several ongoing research directions in section 5 .
2 analyzing protein folding trajectories 2.1 protein folding trajectories advances in high - performance computing technologies and molecular dynamics have led to successful simulations of folding dynamics for ( small ) proteins at the atomistic level [ 8 ] .
such simulations result in a large number of folding trajectories , each of which consists of a series of 3d conformations of the protein under simulation .
these conformations are usually sampled regularly ( e.g. , every 200fs ) during a simulation .
in this article , we also refer to each conformation as a folding frame or simply a frame .
furthermore , to represent a protein conformation , we adopt one of the commonly adopted representation schemes , where a conformation is represented as a sequence of alpha - carbons ( calpha ) located in 3d space .
in this article , we focus on the folding trajectories of two mini proteins : bba5 ( protein data bank id ) [ 9 ] and gsgs ( orbeta3s ) [ 10,11 ] .
such trajectories were produced by the folding @ home research group at stanford university [ 12 ] .
bba5 is a 23 - residue protein that folds at microsecond timescale .
the native structure ( or fold ) of bba5 shows a beta - hairpin involving residues 1 - 10 and centering about residues 4 - 5 .
it also includes an alpha - helix involving the remaining residues 11 - 23. by convention , residues are numbered increasingly from the n - terminal to c - terminal of a protein .
figure 1 ( a ) illustrates the native conformation of bba5 .
the two folding trajectories , referred to as t23 and t24 respectively , are of different length .
t23 consists of a series of 192 conformations ( or frames ) , while t24 has 150 frames .
each conformation is described at atomistic level in pdb format adopted by the protein data bank programs .
gsgs ( or beta3s ) is a 20 - residue peptide with an average folding rate of microseconds .
its nmr conformation shows a three - stranded anti - parallel beta - sheet with turns at residues 6 - 7 and 14 - 15 .
figure 2 ( a ) depicts this native conformation .
there are a total of 5 gsgs folding trajectories : t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 , and t5 .
the number of conformations in each trajectory is listed in table 1 .
similar to bba5 , each conformation corresponds to one pdb file .
pande et al. explained in detail on the simulation model and methods employed to produce such trajectories [ 8,9 ] .

figures 1 ( c ) and 1 ( d ) illustrate the last frame in the two trajectories t23 and t24 respectively .
this also applies to the five gsgs folding trajectories , where each starts with the same conformation ( figure 2 ( b )) but ends at a different conformation ( figures 2 ( c ) , 2 ( d ) & 2 ( e )) .
this seeming difference might be attributed to the stochastic nature of the folding simulation process [ 8,9 ] .
however , it is also desirable to characterize the similarities ( or dissimilarities ) across multiple trajectories .
to compare two trajectories , one must address the following key issue : how can we compare two protein conformations ?
several measures have been commonly used towards such a purpose , including rmsd ( root mean squared distance ) [ 13 ] , contact order [ 14 ] , and native contacts [ 15 ] .
however , all these measures are designed to quantify the global topology of a conformation .
furthermore , based on our empirical analysis of these measures , we notice that they are generally too coarse and thus can often be misleading .
even more importantly , such measures fail to identify similar local structures ( or motifs ) between conformations .
this is especially crucial for small proteins like bba5 .
as demonstrated in both experimental and theoretical studies , small proteins often fold hierarchically and begin locally [ 16 ] .
for instance , it has been shown that bba5 tends to first form secondary structures such as beta - turns and alpha - helices , then conform to its global topology [ 9 ] .
finally , as suggested by pande [ 8 ] , both sterics ( local motifs ) and global topology might play an important role in protein folding .
therefore , to compare conformations of ( small ) proteins , a more reasonable comparison should consider both local and global structures .
moreover , it should also take the native topology of the protein under study into account .
to meet these requirements , we propose the following two - step approach to compare conformations of bba5 .
first , we partition the 23 residues of bba5 into four fragments : ( i ) f1 : n - terminal 1 - 10 beta - hairpin ; ( ii ) f2 : c - terminal 11 - 23 alpha - helix fragment ; ( iii ) f3 : the first half of f1 and the second half of f2 ; and ( iv ) f4 : the second half of f1 and the first half of f2 , i.e. , the middle section in the primary sequence .
this segmentation of is also summarized in table 2 .
second , we recognize the secondary structure propensity in each fragment .
two conformations are said to be similar if they demonstrate the same secondary structure propensity in the same fragment .
for instance , the pair of conformations in figure 3 ( a ) are similar as residues in f1 , f2 and f4 from both conformations indicate a beta - turn like local motif .
please note that the orientation of local motifs does not affect the comparison .
for instance , in figure 3 ( d ) , we say the two conformations have a similar structure in f1 fragment , even though the beta - turn motifs have different orientations .
table 2 partitions along the primary sequence of bba5 .
partition amino acids remark f1 1 - 10 beta - hairpin f2 11 - 23 alpha - helix f3 1 - 6 , 16 - 23 the 1st half of f1 and the 2nd half of f2 f4 6 - 17 the 2nd half of f1 and the 1st half of f2 figure 3 selected conformation - pairs along the consensus partial folding pathway of bba5 .
the figure illustrates four conformation - pairs , one from each trajectory , along the consensus partial folding pathway identified in the two bba5 trajectories .
the same two - step approach is also applied to find similar gsgs conformations , except that a different segmentation strategy is adopted according to the native gsgs structure .
a total of seven segments are being used to identify the relative location of a motif in gsgs .
table 3 lists such segments .
also listed are the residues involved in each segment and its biological meaning .
table 3 partitions along the primary sequence of gsgs .

first , how can one effectively capture and represent local motifs ?
second , how can we represent the global topology of a conformation in terms of local motifs ?
to address the first issue , we leverage the non - local patterns in protein contact maps .
for the second , we characterize the spatial arrangement among non - local patterns .
please see section 3 for more details .
2.3 folding trajectory analysis : objectives there are two main goals we would like to achieve in analyzing the folding trajectories .
first , we would like to address the following issues for individual trajectories : ( 1 ) to detect ( or predict ) significant folding events , including the formation of beta - turns , alpha - helices , and native - like conformations ; and ( 2 ) to recognize the temporal ordering of important folding events in the trajectory .
for instance , between the two secondary structures alpha - helix and beta - hairpin in bba5 , which forms earlier ?
what is ordering of the two events preceding a beta - hairpin formation : formation of two extended strands or formation of the turn ?
in contrast to the first goal , our second goal concerns multiple trajectories .
specifically , we would like to identify a sub - sequence of similar conformations across trajectories .
this sub - sequence of conformations is referred to as the consensus partial folding pathway .
this is analogous to the longest common sub - sequence ( lcs ) problem [ 17 ] , but much more challenging due to the following reasons .
first , we are dealing with time series of 3d protein structures .
second , we are looking for similar conformations across trajectories , and our work on mining spatio - temporal data [ 5 ] .
3 algorithm in this section , we describe in detail the proposed approach for analyzing protein folding trajectories .
as shown in figure 4 , such an approach consists of three main phases : ( i ) data preprocessing , ( ii ) spatio - temporal object association pattern mining , and ( iii ) trajectory analysis .
we next discuss each phase in further details .
figure 4 algorithm .
main steps of summarizing and analyzing protein folding trajectories .
3.1 data preprocessing same as in our previous studies on protein structural analysis [ 6,7 ] , we represent 3d protein conformations by contact maps .
in order for this algorithm to be self - contained , we next briefly go over these preprocessing steps .
we also explain the rationale of such steps in the context of protein folding .
contact map generation when generating contact maps , we consider the euclidean distances between alpha - carbons ( calpha ) of each amino acid .
two alpha - carbons are considered to be in contact if their distance is within 8.5 a. thus , for a protein of n residues , its contact map is an n x n binary matrix , where the cell at ( i , j ) is 1 if the ith and jth alpha - carbons are in contact , 0 otherwise .
since contact maps are symmetric across the diagonal , we only consider the bits below the diagonal .
furthermore , we also ignore the pairs of calpha atoms whose distance in the primary sequence is <= 2 , as they are sure to be in contact .
this step transforms the two bba5 trajectories into two series of contact maps , with each contact map of size 23 x 23. by the same token , the 5 gsgs trajectories are transformed into 5 sequences of contact maps .
identifying maximally connected bit - patterns every bit in a contact map has eight neighbor bits .
for an edge position , we assume its out - of - boundary positions contain 0 .
in a contact map , a connected bit - pattern is a collection of bit - 1 positions , where for each 1 , at least one of its neighbors is 1 .
correspondingly , we define a maximally - connected bit - pattern ( also referred to as a bit - pattern in this article ) to be a connected pattern p where every neighbor bit not in p is 0 .
we apply a simple region growth algorithm to identify all the maximally - connected patterns in each contact map within the two series of contact maps , corresponding to the two folding trajectories of bba5 .
altogether , we identified 352 maximally - connected bit - patterns in such contact maps .
for the gsgs folding data , a total of 50,572 unique bit - patterns are constructed .
we then represent each identified bit - pattern as a 6 - tuple feature vector consisting of the following attributes : * height : the number of rows contained in the pattern 's minimum bounding rectangle ( mbr ) .
* width : the number of columns in the pattern 's mbr .
* numones : the number of 1s in the pattern .
* slope : the general linear distribution trend of all the 1s in the pattern within its mbr .
to compute the angle of a connected pattern we use the least - squares method to estimate the slope of a linear regression line .
for a pattern containing n 1s , we denote the positions of the 1s as : ( x1 , y1 )...( xn , yn ) .
the least - squares method then estimates the slope beta1 as : beta1 = sumi = 1n (( xi - x )*( yi - y ))/ sumi = 1n (( xi - x ) 2 ) * xstddev : the standard deviation of all the 1s' x - coordinates ( this quantifies how the 1s spread along the x dimension ) .
* ystddev : the standard deviation of all the 1s' y - coordinates .
note that this feature vector captures the main geometric properties of a bit - pattern .
as discussed in the literature [ 18 - 21 ] , non - local patterns ( where bit - patterns are one type of non - local patterns ,) in contact maps can effectively capture the secondary structure of proteins .
our previous work [ 6,7 ] demonstrated that by characterizing the spatial relationship among the above described bit - patterns , one can construct structural signatures for proteins of different classes or folds .
in the context of protein folding , we have observed that the above - defined bit - patterns are also capable of capturing a wide range of local 3d structural motifs .
they can even approximately measure the strength of secondary structure propensity in a conformation .
for instance , we have identified bit - patterns that correspond to " premature " alpha - helices and native - like alpha - helices respectively .
henceforth , we refer to the 3d structure formed by all the participating residues of a bit - pattern as the 3d motif of the bit - pattern .
the relationship between bit - patterns and 3d motifs will be further discussed in the next section .
clustering bit - patterns into approximately equivalent groups in this step , we partition the extracted bit - patterns into approximately equivalent groups , each of which consists of bit - patterns that exhibit similar geometric properties ( e.g. , shape and size ) .
to construct such equivalent groups , we run the k - means based clustering algorithm [ 22 ] over the bit - patterns' corresponding feature vectors , where k is the number of clusters ( or equivalent groups ) that will be produced .
to determine an optimal value of k , we take the following three steps .
first , we run the clustering algorithm on different k values .
this produces different clustering schemes for the same set of bit - patterns .
second , for each clustering scheme , we compute its entropy .
let c1 , ... , cl be the l clusters after clustering the set of n bit - patterns .
furthermore , each cluster ci ( 1 <= i <= l ) has an individual entropy hi and contains ni elements , then the total entropy of this clustering is given by the following formula : h = sumi = 1khi *( ni / n ) the entropy of each individual cluster , i.e. , hi , is computed by summing up the entropy of each of the six bit - pattern attributes such as its height and width .
for an attribute , we compute its entropy in a cluster according to the procedure explained by shannon [ 23 ] .
in the third and final step , we plot the entropy against the number of clusters , i.e. , k , and choose a value k where the entropy plot begins to show a linear trend .
for the bba5 folding data , this clustering step groups the 352 bit - patterns into 10 clusters ( or types ) .
as for the gsgs data , 12 clusters are identified .
intuitively , the 3d motifs of the bit - patterns in a cluster will also have similar 3d geometric properties .
this is verified based on our manual analysis on the bba5 trajectories .
figure 5 illustrates the representative 3d motifs.corresponding to the 9 of 10 types of bit - patterns identified in bba5 trajectories .
we omit type 0 , as bit - patterns of this type , unlike the others , correspond to a wide variety of 3d motifs .
figure 5 mapping between 2d bit - patterns and 3d sub - structures .
the figure visualizes the representative 3d sub - structures corresponding to the 10 classes of bit - patterns identified in the contact maps along bba5 's two folding trajectories .
the bit - patterns shown here are randomly selected from their respective group for illustration purpose .
we also observed a similar scenario for the 12 types of bit - patterns identified in the gsgs trajectories .
for instance , the typical 3d motifs of type 0 bit - patterns resemble the native conformation of gsgs ( see figure 2 ( a )) ; whereas those of type 6 identify with alpha - helices .
upon a closer look at this 2d - 3d mapping illustrated in figure 5 , one can observe the following interesting aspects .
first , multiple types of bit - patterns can be associated with a single type of 3d motif .
for instance , there are 3 types of bit - patterns are mapped to an alpha - helical motif .
second , contrary to a commonly accepted belief that beta - turns or beta - sheets cannot be captured by maximally connected bit - patterns as defined earlier , our analysis shows that this belief does not stand .
to illustrate this point , we take two examples .
the first example , illustrated in figure 6 , corresponds to the beta - turn structure .
as shown in figure 6 ( b ) , the beta - turn formed by the first 10 calpha atoms of bba5 can be captured by the maximally connected bit - pattern shown in figure 6 ( a ) .
the second example , shown in figure 7 , illustrates that a two turn beta - sheet ( figure 7 ( b )) can also be captured by a bit - pattern ( figure 7 ( a )) .
finally , not every type of bit - patterns can be mapped to a typical 3d motif .
this might be attributed to our entropy - based criteria for selecting an " optimal " value of the parameter k in the clustering task .
figure 6 beta - turns vs. maximally connected bit - patterns : an example .
( a ) a type 8 bit - pattern is identified in the 166th frame of the bba5 t23 trajectory .
this bit - pattern corresponds to the the connected 1s in the table , where a ' 1 ' indicates two corresponding calpha atoms are in contact ,' - ' otherwise .
this pattern consists of the first 10 calpha atoms .
( b ) the 3d conformation of this frame , where the first 10 calpha atoms resembles a beta - turn .
figure 7 beta - sheets vs. maximally connected bit - patterns : an example .
( a ) a type 0 bit - pattern is identified in the 24201th frame of the gsgs t1 trajectory .
this bit - pattern corresponds to the the connected ' x ' - es in the table , where an ' x ' indicates two corresponding calpha atoms are in contact ,' - ' otherwise .
it consists of calpha atoms from 5 through 20 .
( b ) the 3d conformation of this frame , where the 5 - 20 calpha atoms resembles a beta - sheet of two turns .
this demonstrates , to a certain extent , the advantage of using 2d contact maps to analyze 3d protein conformations .
undoubtedly , using contact maps greatly reduces the computational complexity , though at the cost of loss in structural information .
however , some of this information loss is re - compensated by mapping bit - patterns to structural motifs in 3d conformations .
more importantly , by exploiting different features in contact maps ( bit - patterns in this work ) , we are able to connect 2d features with features in 3d space .
in the bba5 case , by identifying 10 types of bit - patterns in contact maps , we indirectly recognize 10 different 3d structural motifs in the folding conformations .
re - labeling bit - patterns with the corresponding cluster label in this step , we re - label all the previously identified bit - patterns with their corresponding cluster label .
let p be a labeled bit - pattern .
it can be represented as follows : p = ( trajid , frameid , listcalpha , label ) .
here , trajid identifies a folding trajectory , and frameid indicates the frame where p occurs , listcalpha consists of all participating alpha - carbons of p , identified by their position in the primary sequence .
finally , label is the cluster label of p. for bba5 , label in { g0 , g1 , ... , g9 } , corresponding to the 10 approximately equivalent groups ( or types ) .
3.2 mining spatio - temporal object association patterns the preprocessing steps transform a 3d protein conformation into a set of labeled 2d bit - patterns , that indirectly capture the local 3d structural characteristics of the conformation .
for the two bba5 trajectories , each conformation contains an average of 6 bit - patterns .
as for the five gsgs trajectories , the average number of bit - patterns in each conformation is 4 .
as bba5 and gsgs fold , the dynamics among their residues is constantly changing until it reaches an equilibrium .
this means that two residues previously in contact may become out of contact later .
as a result , bit - patterns present in one conformation may be absent in the next .
the evolving nature of contacting residues and in turn bit - patterns , is essentially the consequence of a variety of weak interactions among amino acids at different levels .
such weak interactions include hydrogen bonds , electrostatic interactions , van der waal 's packing and hydrophobic interactions [ 24 ] .
to capture these ( potential ) interactions , a simple yet effective method is to consider how close two amino acids are located from each other in 3d .
we also adopt this method here .
specifically , we consider interactions between local 3d motifs captured by labeled bit - patterns .
we denote such interactions as " interactions among bit - patterns " .
let pi and pj be two bit - patterns in a protein conformation , and pi.listcalpha and pj.listcalpha be the list of alpha - carbons involved in pi and pj , respectively .
we define piand pj as interacting bit - patterns if at least one pair of alpha - carbons , each from pi.listcalpha and pj.listcalpha are located within a short distance delta .
note that the value of delta should be greater than the distance that is being used to identify contacting alpha - carbons when generating contact maps .
in our analysis , we set delta = 10 a. it is noteworthy that the above notion of interacting bit - patterns is new compared to our previous work , where two bit - patterns are associated if their distance in the 2d contact map space is below a certain threshold .
this can be misleading in the context of protein folding analysis .
as demonstrated in figure 8 , the two bit - patterns - bp # 1 and bp # 2 - are only 2 amino acids away in the 2d contact map .
however , they can be relatively far apart in 3d .
on the other hand , although the bit - patterns bp # 2 and bp # 3 are relatively far apart from each other in the 2d contact map , they are close to each other in 3d .
therefore , measuring the distance between bit - patterns in the actual 3d conformation is more robust with respect to capturing potential interaction among local motifs .
figure 8 discrepancy between distances in 2d and 3d spaces .
bit - patterns that are close to each other in the 2d contact map space , for instance , bp # 1 and bp # 2 , can be distant from each other in 3d .
similarly , bit - patterns that are distant in 2d space , for instance , bp # 1 and bp # 3 , can be close to each other in 3d .
so far , we have discussed our approach of using bit - patterns in contact maps to characterize local 3d motifs and further represent a protein conformation during folding .
we also define the notion of interacting bit - patterns in the folding context .
we are now ready to present our method of summarizing folding trajectories to fulfill the two objectives described in section 2.3 .
the main idea is that we can summarize a folding trajectory by characterizing the evolutionary behavior of interactions among different types of bit - patterns and in turn , the interactions among local 3d motifs .
definition of ( minlink = 1 ) soap as proposed in our previous work [ 5,25 ] , such interactions can be modeled and captured by discovering different types of spatial object association patterns ( soaps ) .
essentially , soaps characterize the specific way that objects , bit - patterns in this case , are interacting with each other at a given time .
among the proposed soap types , after a careful evaluation , we empirically select ( minlink = 1 ) soaps to model the interacting bit - patterns in the folding process .
let p = ( g1 , g2 , ... , gk ) be a ( minlink = 1 ) soap of size k , where gi is one of the 10 types of bit - patterns described above .
in the context of folding trajectories , p prescribes that there exists k bit - patterns b1 , b2 , ... , bk in a conformation , where bi.label = gi ( 1 <= i <= k ) .
furthermore , for each bi , it interacts with at least one of the remaining ( k - 1 ) bit - patterns .
note that the k labels in p are not mutually exclusive .
for instance , one can have soaps such as ( 7 9 9 ) , which involves one type 7 bit - pattern and two type 9 bit - patterns .
we further restrict ourselves to soaps that occur frequently during the folding process ( frequent soaps ) .
however , we are not ruling out rarely - occurring soaps in our future studies .
a soap is said to be frequent if it appears in no fewer than minsupp frames in a trajectory .
in our studies , we set minsupp = 5 for bba5 and 10 from gsgs .
soap episodes the next step is to capture the evolutionary nature of the folding process .
we do this by identifying the evolutionary nature of soaps .
as mentioned earlier , small proteins like bba5 and gsgs often fold hierarchically and begin with local folded structures .
as they fold , new soaps can be created and existing one can dissipate .
to capture such evolutionary behavior , we proposed the concept of soap episodes , which provide an effective approach to model the evolution of interactions among spatial objects over time [ 5 ] .
to reiterate , a soap episode e is defined as follows : e = ( p , fbeg , fend ) , where p is a soap composed of one or more bit - patterns , p was created in frame fbeg and persisted till frame fend .
note that for a given p , it can be created more than once during protein folding , and thus can have more than one episode .
to discover frequent ( minlink = 1 ) soaps and their episodes in the trajectories of bba5 and gsgs , we apply our soap mining algorithm as explained in our previous work [ 5 ] .
in summary , this mining phase produces the following results : ( i ) a list of ( minlink = 1 ) soaps of bit - patterns that appeared in at least 5 conformations in each folding trajectories for the protein bba5 and 10 for gsgs ; and ( ii ) a list of episodes , ordered by beginning frame fbeg , associated with each of these soaps .
3.3 folding trajectory analysis in this section , we describe our strategy on utilizing soaps to summarize a folding trajectory and address the two folding analysis issues described in section 2.3 .
soap - based trajectory summarization the previous mining phase discovers a collection of frequent ( minlink = 1 ) soaps and the associated episodes in each trajectory .
therefore , it identifies all the conformations in the trajectories that contain at least one frequent ( minlink = 1 ) soaps .
for instance , the last conformation in trajectory t23 ( figure 1 ( c )) has two soaps of size 2 :( 5 8 ) ( i.e. , association of a type 5 and a type 8 bit - pattern ) and ( 7 8 ) , and three soaps of size 1 : ( 5 ) , ( 7 ) , and ( 8 ) , while the last conformation in trajectory t24 has three soaps : ( 7 8 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) .
this leads to our soap - based approach for folding trajectory summarization .
to summarize a folding trajectory , we perform the following three steps .
first , for each conformation , we identify all the frequent soaps that appear in it and use these soaps to represent this conformation .
note that not every conformation contains frequent soaps , especially when minsupp is set high .
second , for each soap - representable conformation , we carry out two tasks on its associated soaps .
we next use the folding trajectories of bba5 to explain how these two tasks are carried out .
in the first task , for each soap , we mark the relative location of each involved bit - pattern in the primary sequence of bba5 .
this is done by identifying the segment of bba5 where the majority of a bit - pattern 's alpha - carbons are located .
the segment can be one of the following as described in section 2.2 : f1 , residues 1 - 10 ; f2 , residues 11 - 23 ; f3 , residues 6 - 17 ; and f4 : residues 1 - 5 and 18 - 23 .
let us again take the last conformation in t24 as an example .
it can be summarized by three soaps : ( 7 8 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) .
when we look at the list of alpha - carbons involved in these bit - patterns , we find out that 7 is mainly located in f2 and 8 in f1 .
therefore , we mark the three soaps as follows : ( 8.1 7.2 ) , ( 7.2 ) and ( 8.1 ) .
we re - arrange the bit - patterns in a soap by their relative locations in bba5 .
this super - imposes bba5 - specific spatial information to a soap .
in the second task , we prune away redundant soaps after marking each bit - pattern with its relative location in bba5 .
a soap is redundant if it is embedded in another soap .
for instance , in the previous example , we can prune away ( 8.1 ) and ( 7.2 ) as both are embedded in ( 7.2 8.1 ) .
after pruning , most conformations in such a small protein can often be represented by a single soap .
we can even take this summarization a step further , where we replace a bit - pattern with its corresponding 3d motif , as illustrated in figure 5 .
for instance , soap ( 7.2 8.1 ) will be transformed into ( beta.1 alpha.2 ) .
we refer to such soaps as generalized soaps , and the corresponding trajectory as a generalized trajectory .
note that in a generalized trajectory , multiple types of bit - patterns can be mapped into a single type of 3d motif .
for instance , the alpha - motif corresponds to three types of bit - patterns 4 , 7 , and 9 ( figure 5 ) .
figure 9 shows a segment in each summarized bba5 folding trajectory before and after being generalized with 3d motifs .
figure 9 soap - based folding trajectory summarization .
an sample segment in each of the two bba5 folding trajectories is presented , ( a ) after superimposing the relative location of each bit - pattern and pruning away redundant soaps .
( b ) after further generalizing each bit - pattern by corresponding 3d motif .
detecting folding events and recognizing ordering among events once each folding trajectory is summarized into generalized soaps , it is fairly straightforward to detect folding events such as the formation of alpha - helix or beta - turn like local structures .
this can be done by simply locating the frames that contain the local motif ( s ) of interest .
we can also easily identify native - like conformations , by finding those that contain the generalized soap ( beta.1 alpha.2 ) .
finally , based on the summarization , one can quickly identify the ordering of folding events in a trajectory .
for instance , to check which secondary structure forms more rapidly , alpha - helix or beta - hairpin , one can simply compare the first occurrence of these structures in the summarized trajectory ( figure 9 ( b )) .
identifying the consensus partial folding pathway across trajectories to do this , we simply compute the longest common sub - sequence ( lcs ) [ 17 ] between two summarized trajectories .
one can utilize the summarization either before the 3d motif generalization ( figure 9 ( a )) or after ( figure 9 ( b )) .
we use the latter in our analysis .
based on the lcs of generalized soaps , we construct the consensus folding pathway by identifying pairs of conformations , one from each trajectory , along the lcs of two summarized trajectories .
in other words , the resulting consensus pathway consists of a sequence of conformation - pairs of similar 3d structures .
notice here that the comparison between 3d protein conformations ( as described in section 2.2 ) is done by using bit - patterns to model local structural motifs , and associations of bit - patterns ( soaps ) to characterize the global structure .
this forms a hierarchical comparison and is in accordance with the hierarchical folding process of small proteins .
4 results in this section , we report results on analyzing the two trajectories of the small synthetic protein bba5 and the five trajectories of another small protein gsgs .
however , we will focus on bba5 .
in previous sections , we have described in detail the structure of bba5 of gsgs and their folding trajectories .
such information is summarized and tabulated in table 4 and table 5 .
table 4 a summary of the bba5 folding trajectories .
protein pdb identifier : bba5 ; primary sequence : 23 residues ; designed protein ; native fold : n - terminal 1 - 10 beta hairpin , c - terminal 11 - 23 alpha - helix trajectory two trajectories : t23 and t24 ; t23 : 192 conformations ; t24 : 150 conformations contact map based on contacts between alpha - carbons.two alpha - carbons are in contact if their euclidian distance is <= 8.5 a bit - patterns a total of 352 unique maximally connected bit - patterns were identified from all conformations ; average number of bit - patterns per conformation is 6 ; bit - patterns are further classified into 10 approximately equivalent types interacting bit - patterns if at least one pair of alpha - carbons , one from each bit - pattern , is of euclidian distance <= 10 a frequent soaps a soap is frequent if it appears in >= 5 conformations ; a total of 444 frequent soaps identified in trajectory t23 , and 258 in t24 consensus partial folding pathway we identified a consensus partial folding pathway across the two trajectories.it is composed of 71 pairs of similar conformations , one from each trajectory table 5 a summary of the gsgs folding trajectories .
protein name : gsgs or beta3s ; primary sequence : 20 residues ; designed protein ; native fold : three stranded anti - parallel beta - sheets with turns at 6 - 7 and 14 - 15 trajectory five trajectories : t1 , t2 , t3 , t4 and t5 ; t1 : 25 , 664 conformations ; t2 : 30 , 075 conformations ; t3 : 19 , 649 conformations ; t4 : 25 , 263 conformations ; t5 : 25 , 664 conformations ; contact map based on contacts between alpha - carbons.two alpha - carbons are in contact if their euclidian distance is <= 8.5 a bit - patterns a total of 50 , 572 unique maximally connected bit - patterns were identified from all conformations ; average number of bit - patterns per conformation is 4 ; bit - patterns are further classified into 12 approximately equivalent types interacting bit - patterns if at least one pair of alpha - carbons , one from each bit - pattern , is of euclidian distance <= 10 a frequent soaps a soap is frequent if it appears in >= 10 conformations ; 4.1 detecting and ordering folding events we summarize both folding trajectories of bba5 into a sequence of soaps as illustrated in figure 9 .
coincidently , both summarized trajectories consist of 64 conformations .
based on these summarized trajectories , we can quickly identify all the conformations where the first alpha - helix - like or beta - turn - like local motifs were formed .
for trajectory t23 , the first alpha - helix - like motif was identified in frame 26 , and the first beta - turn - like local motif was formed in frame 63 .
for the other trajectory t24 , the frames were 29 and 38 .
this is in accordance with experimental results that alpha - helices generally fold more rapidly than beta - turns .
however , since we only consider frequent soaps , it is very possible that we might miss the actual first formation of such local motifs .
to address this issue , we might need to consider rarely occurring soaps .
we plan to investigate this in the future .
for the two events related to beta - turn formation , formation of two extended strands and formation of the turn , we found that for both trajectories , the formation of extended strands preceded the formation of the turn .
also , we identify two conformations in each trajectory that show native - like structure .
we do this by locating the conformations associated with the generalized soap ( beta.1 alpha.2 ) .
figure 10 presents the 3d structure of these native - like conformations along with the native conformation of bba5 .
one can see that our soap - based comparison does well in identifying similar 3d conformations .
figure 10 the native - like conformations identified in the two bba5 trajectories .
according to the soap - based summarization of the two bba5 folding trajectories , two native - like conformations are identified in each trajectory .
4.2 consensus partial folding pathway across trajectories based on the generalized trajectory summarization of bba5 , we identify a consensus partial folding pathway of length 71 .
in other words , 71 pairs of conformations , one from each trajectory , are considered similar to each other .
figure 3 displays four such pairs along this consensus folding pathway .
for instance , the two conformations shown in figure 3 ( c ) , corresponding to the 182th frame in the t23 trajectory and the 116th frame in the t24 trajectory of bba5 respectively , are considered structurally similar , since both conformations exhibit an alpha - helix in the left half of the backbone , and a beta - turn in the right half .
figure 11 illustrate 5 pairs of conformations along the consensus folding pathway of the 1st and 3rd trajectories of gsgs. and figure 12 illustrates 5 conformation - pairs along consensus pathway of the 1st and 5th trajectories of gsgs .
we are currently in the process of identifying consensus pathways across more than 2 trajectories of gsgs .
note that by using bit - patterns , we naturally realize a rotation - invariant comparison .
to illustrate this , let us again examine the afore - discussed conformation pair of bba5 .
one notices that although the beta - turn in the two conformations orients differently , the two conformations are still identified as being structurally similar by our approach .
figure 11 selected conformation - pairs along the consensus partial folding pathway across the 1st and 3rd trajectories of the gsgs peptide .
the figure illustrates five pairs of conformations , one from each trajectory , along the consensus partial folding pathway identified in the 1st and 3rd trajectories .
figure 12 selected conformation - pairs along the consensus partial folding pathway across the 1st and 5th trajectories of the gsgs peptide .
the figure illustrates five pairs of conformations , one from each trajectory , along the consensus partial folding pathway identified in the 1st and 5th trajectories .
currently , we rely on visual tools to justify these consensus pathways .
we did attempt to use several measurements that have been used previously to quantify the similarity between 3d protein conformations , but to no avail .
these measurements include rmsd , contact order , and native contacts .
if we identify the pathway based on the best match given by any of the above measurements , we often ended up with a very short consensus pathway ( as short as 10 frames ) .
two conformations are said to be a best match if they have the lowest rmsd or have the smallest difference in contact order or native contacts .
moreover , different best - matched measurements rendered very different consensus pathways .
finally , we notice that the best - matched conformations based on any of such measurements can often exhibit very different structural characteristics .
we are investigating alternative methods for quantitative validation of our results .
5 conclusions and ongoing work in this article , we present a novel approach to analyze protein folding trajectories and a case study on the small proteins bba5 and gsgs .
we capture a variety of structural motifs in the 3d protein conformations by non - local bit - patterns identified in their 2d contact maps. by modeling the interactions or spatial relationships among bit - patterns as soaps and soap episodes , we effectively characterize the evolutionary nature of the folding process .
we also describe two methods to summarize folding trajectories by super - imposing protein specific information and 3d motifs onto soaps .
utilizing the summarized trajectories , we demonstrate that one can detect folding events and the temporal order among events .
we also show that through comparing such summarized trajectories , one can identify a partial folding pathway common to multiple trajectories .
we realize that it is a very hard and challenging task to understand the folding mechanism of proteins .
based on our analysis results over a small protein , we are not in the position to make any general comments on the protein folding problem .
however , the approach presented here is general and applicable to any folding trajectories .
presently , we are in the process of addressing several other related issues .
first , we are automating the mapping between 2d bit - patterns and 3d motifs .
second , we are further analyzing the identified consensus folding pathways and validating them through other means .
third , it is well - known that the side chains of a protein play a crucial role in the folding process .
we are currently investigating different approaches to involve side chains in our analysis .
finally , we are investigating whether bit - patterns can be used to index and manage protein folding simulation data .

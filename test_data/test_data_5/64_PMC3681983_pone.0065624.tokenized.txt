background pheochromocytomas are rare tumors generally arising in the medullary region of the adrenal gland .
these tumors release excessive epinephrine and norepinephrine resulting in hypertension and cardiovascular crises for which surgery is the only definitive treatment .
molecular mechanisms that control tumor development and hormone production are poorly understood , and progress has been hampered by the lack of human cellular model systems .
to study pheochromocytomas , we developed a stable progenitor pheochromocytoma cell line derived from a primary human tumor .
methods after irb approval and written informed consent , human pheochromocytoma tissue was excised , minced , dispersed enzymatically , and cultured in vitro .
primary pheochromocytoma cells were infected with a lentivirus vector carrying the catalytic subunit of human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( htert ) .
the htert immortalized cells ( hpheo1 ) have been passaged > 300 population doublings .
the resulting cell line was characterized morphologically , biochemically and for expression of neuroendocrine properties .
the expression of marker enzymes and proteins was assessed by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting .
telomerase activity was determined by using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol ( trap ) assay .
results we have established a human pheochromocytoma precursor cell line that expresses the neuroendocrine marker , chromogranin a , when differentiated in the presence of bone morphogenic protein 4 ( bmp4 ) , nerve growth factor ( ngf ) , and dexamethasone .
phenylethanolamine n - methyltransferase ( pnmt ) expression is also detected with this differentiation regimen .
cd - 56 ( also known as ncam , neural cell adhesion molecule ) is expressed in these cells , but cd31 ( also known as pecam - 1 , a marker of endothelial cells ) is negative .
conclusions we have maintained htert - immortalized progenitor cells derived from a pheochromocytoma ( hpheo1 ) in culture for over 300 population doublings .
this progenitor human cell line is normal diploid except for a deletion in the p16 region and has inducible neuroendocrine biomarkers .
these cells should be a valuable reagent for studying mechanisms of tumor development and for testing novel therapeutic approaches .
this study was supported by the north american neuroendocrine tumor society , american cancer society institutional grant , burroughs wellcome fund # 1005954 , and canadian institute of health research .
the funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript .
introduction pheochromocytomas are catecholamine - producing tumors , which arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla .
pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas ( extra - adrenal pheochromocytomas ) usually produce catecholamines .
the incidence of pheochromocytoma in the usa is 1 - 2 per million [ 1 ] .
patients with pheochromocytomas demonstrate variable clinical presentations including spells with paroxysmal hypertension and palpitations , and symptoms may mimic pre - eclampsia in pregnant women [ 2 ] .
if untreated , pheochromocytomas can lead to cardiovascular collapse or death due to excess catecholamine production .
surgical excision of pheochromocytomas represent the only curative therapy , although cytotoxic chemotherapy , high dose [ 131i ] - metaiodobenzylguanidine ( mibg ) [ 3 ] , and tyrosine kinase inhibitors [ 4 ] all show some activity in metastatic disease .
the basis of some of these treatment options is based on the discovery of a number of genes associated with pheochromocytomas , including neurofibromin 1 ( nfi ) , von hippel - lindau ( vhl ) , transmembrane 127 ( tmem127 ) , proto - oncogene ( ret ) , and myc associated factor x ( max ) [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
genes associated with extra - adrenal pheochromocytomas ( paragangliomas ) include four nuclear genes that encode subunits of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase ( sdha , sdhb , sdhc , sdhd ) , which catalyzes the conversion of succinate to fumarate in the krebs cycle [ 7 ] in addition to having an association with the hypoxia pathway .
hif2 is another gene associated with the hypoxia pathway and paragangliomas [ 8 ] .
despite some advancement in the genetics associated with pheochromocytomas , the exact mechanisms of how these tumors form and how the specific gain or loss of function of genes involved in the pathogenesis of this disease are still largely unknown .
fortunately , the recurrence and metastasis of pheochromocytomas are rare ; however , metastases are associated with a 5 year survival of < 40 % [ 9 ] [ 10 ] .
while molecular mechanisms that control pheochromocytoma development remain poorly understood , progress is further hampered by the lack of suitable model systems , limited to the pc - 12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line [ 11 ] , mouse pheochromocytoma ( mpc ) cell line [ 12 ] , and recently developed mouse mpc derivative known as mtt [ 13 ] .
attempts at developing human pheochromocytoma cell lines have not been successful , most likely due to the limited life spans of normal human cells in culture [ 14 ] .
establishing cell lines from normal tissues and benign tumors is challenging , since telomere shortening and lack of cell cycle augmentation derived from the characteristic of the transformed phenotype thwart long - term propagation .
previous reports [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] have shown that by introducing human telomerase reverse transcriptase ( htert ) into human cells , with or without introduction of cyclin dependent kinase 4 ( cdk4 ) , can lead to immortalization of cells with minimal alteration of cell phenotype .
to date , this method has been applied to non - malignant cells including human bronchial , mammary , retinal , colonic , skin epithelial cells , skeletal muscle cells , vascular endothelial cells , and fibroblasts [ 15 ] - [ 18 ] .
we applied this technology in an attempt to immortalize endocrine tumors of low or unknown malignant potential and to develop a cell line from a human pheochromocytoma , by stably introducing htert alone .
the result is that we have developed a unique neuroendocrine progenitor cell line derived from a human pheochromocytoma tumor that should have utility in dissecting molecular pathways that influence growth and differentiation leading to pheochromocytoma .
methods case a 39 year - old woman presented for work - up of recurrent nephrolithiasis and was incidentally found to have a 4 cm left adrenal mass .
she did not have hypercalcemia or any family history of pheochromocytoma , hyperparathyroidism , or thyroid cancer .
work - up of this mass revealed elevated 24 hr urine normetanephrine of 1120 microg / 24 hrs (< 900 ) and metanephrine of 973 microg / 24 hrs (< 400 ) .
norepinephrine in the 24 hr urine collection was 37 microg / 24 hrs ( 15 - 80 ) , epinephrine was 12 microg / 24 hrs ( 0 - 20 ) , and dopamine was 200 microg / 24 hrs ( 65 - 400 ) .
her plasma normetanephrine of 3.09 nmol / l (< 0.90 ) and metanephrine of 0.86 nmol / l (< 0.50 ) were also elevated .
she did not have cortisol and aldosterone hypersecretion .
in retrospect , she did report having episodic symptoms of tachycardia and nervousness .
she was referred for a left adrenalectomy .
pathology confirmed that this tissue was a pheochromocytoma .
isolation of cells derived from a human pheochromocytoma tissue from this woman 's pheochromocytoma was minced into small pieces and incubated with collagenase type 4 at 2.5 mg / ml ( worthington # 46k8986 ) along with deoxyribonuclease i at 0.05 mg / ml ( worthington # s7m9938f ) [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] , and mixed with 12 ml hank 's buffer salt solution ( hbss ) for 3 hours at 37c .
the digested tissue was dispersed into a single cell suspension by pipetting and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min .
the supernatant was aspirated , and the cell pellet was resuspended and maintained as nonadherent spheroids in a chemically defined serum - free dmem / f - 12 ( cellgro ) , consisting of human recombinant epidermal growth factor ( 20 ng / ml ; sigma ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( 20 ng / ml ; upstate ) , b27 supplement ( 1x ; invitrogen ) , insulin - transferrin - selenium - x ( 1x ; invitrogen ) , and penicillin - streptomycin ( 100 units / ml and 100 microg / ml ; hyclone ) [ 21 ] .
in this medium , fibroblasts remained attached to the polystyrene plate ( standard tissue culture coating ) , while the neuroendocrine cells remained in suspension as spheroids .
after 2 weekly passages , the medium was switched to acl4 medium [ 22 ] with 10 % fetal bovine serum , where cells settled on polystyrene t - 75 flask ( standard tissue culture coating ) .
cells were passaged with approximately two population doublings occurring per week .
lentiviral production hek293ft cells were plated at a density of 10e6 cells per 10 cm dish 24 hours prior to transfection .
the cells were transfected with the htert lentiviral vector along with packaging vectors , pmd2g , and pspax2 using the manufacturer 's suggested protocol for fugene6 .
the transfection medium was removed the following morning and replaced with standard acl4 growth medium .
supernatants from these cells were collected 24 hours after recovery from transfection .
the supernatants were filtered using a 0.45 microm syringe filter , combined with 4 microg / ml of polybrene , and added to the cultured primary pheochromocytoma cells .
htert immortalization of pheochromocytoma cells primary pheochromocytoma cells were infected with lentivirus - htert containing a blasticidin resistance gene .
pheochromocytoma cells were selected at six weeks post infection ( in order to allow enough cells to grow for selection ) with blasticidin ( 2 mg / ml ) for 10 days .
the telomeric repeat amplification protocol ( trap ) assay was used to determine whether the blasticidin resistant cells were expressing the htert catalytic subunit using the trapeze kit ( chemicon , temecula ca ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
the telomerase products ( 6 - bp ladder ) and the 36 - bp internal control ( itas ) bands were quantified using the alphaimager 2000 software ( alpha innotech corporation , san leandro ca ) .
relative telomerase activity ( rta ) was calculated as the intensity ratio of the trap ladder to that of the itas band ( relative intensity of each sample was normalized to that of the positive control ) .
see figure s1 .
characterization of immortalized pheochromocytoma cell line measurement of catecholamines samples were prepared by sonicating approximately 1 million cells in 15 ml conical tubes with 200 microl of 2 % formic acid in water .
methanol was added to precipitate proteins , and the samples were centrifuged .
samples were analyzed by an mds sciex api 5000 , equipped with turbo ion spray probe coupled to a shimadzu lc system .
separation of epinephrine ( e ) , norepinephrine ( ne ) , and normetanephrine ( nmn ) was achieved with a phenomynex luna cyano analytical column ( 15 cmx4.6 mm ; 5 microm particle size ) and with a phenomynex cyano guard column .
mobile phase was acetonitrile - water ( 60:40 by volume ) containing 1.5 mmol / l ammonium acetate and 0.6 g / l formic acid .
flow rate was 0.5 ml / min .
ionization of e , ne , and nmn was performed in positive mode with purified nitrogen as the curtain gas with zero air for gas 1 / gas 2 .
mass spectrometer settings were temperature = 500c , dwell time = 200 ms , declutering potential = 26 , entrance potential = 10 , collision energy = 29 , collision exit potential = 6 , q1 resolution = unit , q3 resolution = unit , collision gas = 8 , curtain gas = 20 , ionsource gas 1 ( gs1 ) = 25 , ionsource gas 2 ( gs2 ) = 25 , and ionspray voltage = 5500 .
20 microl of the sample was injected onto the column .
acquisition was achieved in multiple - reaction monitoring mode ( mrm ) .
transitions of the precursor ions to product ions were m / z 152 - - > 107 for ne , m / z 184 - - > 107 for e , and m / z 184 - - > 166 for nmn .
total chromatographic run time was 6 minutes .
quantitative analysis was by peak height .
immunoblotting immunoblot for tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ) , dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase ( dopadc ) , dopamine beta - hydroxylase ( dbh ) , and catecholamine - o - methyltransferase ( comt ) was performed using antibodies from santa cruz biotechnology ( th , # 14007 ; dopadc , # 46909 ; dbh , # 33914 ; and comt , # 25844 ) .
chromogranin a antibody was purchased from millipore .
protein extraction was achieved using lysis buffer ( cell signaling , # 9803 ) containing a full spectrum of protease inhibitors .
test samples were loaded using 25 microg protein / well .
proteins were resolved with 10 % sds - page and transferred to pvdf membranes ( immobilon - p , millipore ) over 1 hour at 86 volts .
the membrane was washed with ttbs ( tris * hcl buffer ph 7.5 , 0.5 % tween - 20 ) twice for 5 min , then blocked by shaking with 5 % fat - free milk in ttbs for one hour at room temperature .
the blots were then probed with primary antibody at 1:1000 in 5 % milk / ttbs overnight at 4c .
after washing with ttbs , the secondary antibody ( either rabbit anti - goat igg - hrp or goat anti - rabbit igg - hrp from bio - rad , richmond , ca , 1:5000 in 5 % milk / ttbs ) was added for 1 h at room temperature .
the membrane was washed with ttbs and developed using the thermo scientific westfemto kit ( pi34095 ) .
immunofluorescence staining cells were plated at 50 % density in 24 well plates on sterile glass .
they were later fixed in 3.7 % formalin in pbs .
after several washes in pbs , the cells on glass coverslips were blocked in normal goat serum , washed again , and subsequently primary cd56 antibody or cd31 antibody ( cell signaling ) was added for overnight incubation .
cells were then washed and respective secondary antibodies conjugated with alexa fluor were added for 1 hr and then counterstained with dapi .
after a final wash and slide mounting preparation , images were taken at 40x with 350 ms exposure time for rhodamine and 50 ms exposure time for dapi .
conventional chromosomal studies chromosome analysis was performed on metaphase cells derived from a short - term culture of cell lines according to the standard procedure [ 23 ] .
slides were g - banded for karyotyping analyses .
snp array profiling and feature extraction dna ( 500 ng ) from the pheochromocytoma cell line was profiled using the genome - wide human snp array 6.0 platform .
genechip command console software was used to generate feature extracted intensity files , which were processed using the birdseed v2 algorithm in the genotyping console to create genotype call files .
dna copy number , allelic status , and snp analyses total copy number and allelic status analyses were determined using partek genomics suite ( pgs ) .
specifically , for total copy number analysis , the " copy number analysis " workflow was used whereby the reference copy number for each sample was determined using a pool of 72 normal samples from the hapmap collection .
regions of copy number gain and loss were then statistically detected using the genomic segmentation method within pgs using default parameters , except for the " number of markers " parameter , which was changed to 50 .
single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) array analysis was performed through the bc cancer research centre array laboratory .
molecular fingerprinting genomic dna was extracted from cell pellets using the qiaamp dna blood mini kit ( qiagen ) , concentrated using a speed - vac , and diluted to 20 ng / microl .
dna ( 20 ng ) was genotyped via the powerplex panel of 9 highly informative microsatellite markers ( promega , san luis obispo , ca ) [ 24 ] .
the resultant haplotype of the pheochromocytoma cell line was compared to those of other common cell lines in use in our laboratories and those of the american type culture collection ( atcc , manassas , va ) .
microarray sample labeling , hybridization and data processing total rna was extracted from tissues and cells using qiagen rneasy mini kit according to manufacturer 's instruction .
illumina whole genome humanwg6 v3 expression beadchip was used in this study .
each rna sample with 0.5 microg of total rna was amplified using the illumina totalprep rna amplification kit with biotin utp ( enzo ) labeling .
the illumina totalprep rna amplification kit uses t7 oligo ( dt ) primer to generate single - stranded cdna followed by a second strand synthesis to generate double - stranded cdna , which is then column purified .
in vitro transcription was done to synthesize biotin labeled crna using t7 rna polymerase .
the crna was then column purified .
the crna was then checked for size and yield using the bio - rad experion system .
1.5 microg of crna was hybridized for each array using standard illumina protocols with streptavidin - cy3 ( amersham ) being used for detection .
slides were scanned on an illumina beadstation .
summarized expression values for probe sets were generated using beadstudio 3.1 ( illumina , inc ) .
the data were background subtracted and quantile - quantile normalized across samples using mbcb algorithm [ 25 ] .
clustering analysis hierarchical clustering analysis and dendogram generation were performed using partek genomics suite .
normalized gene expression values were used to cluster samples .
euclidean distance was used as dissimilarity matrix , and complete linkage was used as clustering method .
cell differentiation differentiation was induced by adding 20 ng / ml bmp4 ( r & d systems ) , 20 ng / ml nerve growth factor ( ngf , sigma - aldrich ) , and 10 microm dexamethasone ( sigma - aldrich ) .
the basal media used was composed of dmem / f - 12 containing 20 ng / ml basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf , sigma - aldrich ) , 20 ng / ml epidermal growth factor ( egf , sigma - aldrich ) , 1 % insulin transferring selenium ( its ) ( gibco ) , and 10 ng / ml leukemia inhibitory factor ( lif , sigma - aldrich ) .
differentiation protocol was followed as described [ 26 ] .
shrna knockdown of sdhb , ret , and comt shrna was used for knockdown of specific genes including sdhb , ret , and comt .
five million 293ft cells were plated per 10 cm plate in media x. the medium was changed the next day .
five micrograms of plasmid dna was diluted to 2 microg pmd2g and 3 microg pspax2 plasmids into 250 microl medium , which was vortexed and spun down .
thirty microliters of polyjet was diluted into 250 microl medium , which was also vortexed and spun down .
diluted polyjet was added to diluted plasmid dna , vortexed , spun down , and incubated for 20 minutes .
five hundred microliters of the transfection complex was added to the 293ft cells .
twenty - four hours after transfection , the medium was changed .
forty - eight and seventy - two hours after transfection , virus was collected and filtered with 0.45 microm filter .
using 4 ml virus mixed with 6.25 microl polybrene , the hpheo1 cells were infected .
the medium was changed again eight hours later .
since the shrna vectors contained green fluorescence protein ( gfp ) and a puromycin selectable marker , gfp expression was assessed two days later as well as a selection for puromycin resistance ( 2 mg / ml ) .
qpcr rna was extracted from cell pellets using qiagen rneasy kit ( cat # 74104 ) .
the bio - rad iscript ( cat # 170 - 8890 ) reverse transcriptase was used to synthesize cdna .
the mastermix used for the qpcr was bio - rad ssofast probes mix ( cat # 172 - 5230 ) , and the probes were from the roche universal probe library ( cat # 04683633001 ) and invitrogen taqman probes .
the qpcr was run on a roche 480 light cycler .
results establishment and properties of hpheo1 cells hpheo1 immortalized cell line derived from human pheochromocytoma lentivirus - htert infected cells were selected with blasticidin ( for 10 days ) and then passaged for > 300 population doublings , establishing the line .
these cells demonstrate high telomerase activity compared to the negative control , primary culture pheochromocytoma cells , using the trap assay ( figure s1 ) .
growth of this cell line in acl4 medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) averaged 2 population doublings ( pd ) per week initially , then growth increased to 6 pd / week with cells growing in 5 % fbs .
cultures could be established from previously cryopreserved cells ( in fetal bovine serum with 10 % dimethylsulfoxide ) without difficulty .
molecular analysis of the immortalized cell line by dna fingerprinting ( figure s2 ) did not match any other cell line in our database or in that of the atcc .
these cells have now been maintained in culture for ~ 5 years , and this immortalized line derived from a human pheochromocytoma is referred to as hpheo1 .
characterization of hpheo1 cells hpheo1 have loss of p16 gene and can be re - differentiated but do not make catecholamines the cytological appearance of the cells are shown in figure 1a .
hpheo1 cells have high level expression of chromogranin a after induction with bmp4 , ngf , and dexamethasone ( figure 2a ) .
in addition , hpheo1 cells express pnmt after induction with bmp4 , ngf , and dexamethasone ( figure 2b ) .
this indicates that hpheo1 cells have neuroendocrine properties .
karyotype and snp analyses demonstrated a small deletion of chromosome 9p on one chromosome , encompassing the cdkn2a gene encoding the p16 protein ( figure 1b and 1c ) .
no other cytogenetic change was noted .
the snp analysis of a portion of the tumor tissue did not show a microdeletion on 9p , at least at the gross level .
instead , tumor tissue shows the cytogenetic changes - 1p , + 3p , - 3q , - 4q , segmental losses on 11p and 11q , and - 17 .
immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) for cd56 ( ncam , neural cell adhesion molecules ) is positive for hpheo1 cells and pc - 12 cells as shown in figure 3 .
in contrast , ihc for cd31 ( endothelial cell marker ) is negative for hpheo1 cells but positive for the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line , huvec .
this demonstrates that hpheo1 cells are not endothelial cells. from rna expression ( figure 4 ) , enzymes associated with the catecholamine pathway are down - regulated , however comt expression is increased .
figure 2c confirms comt expression by western blot .
also , confirmed by western blot was lack of expression of th , dopadc , dbh ( data not shown ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0065624.g001 figure 1 characterization of hpheo1 cells. a. hematoxylin and eosin staining shows plump polygonal cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. b. karyotypic analysis shows a female diploid pattern with a single cytogenetic abnormality , del9p22 on one chromosome , near its telomeric end ( arrow ). c. snp analysis confirms the deletion of 9p , which encompasses the cdkn2a ( p16 gene ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0065624.g002 figure 2 differentiation of hpheo1 cells. a. western blot for chromogranin a shows expression more prominent after differentiation treatment. b. western blot for pnmt shows expression more prominent after differentiation treatment. c. presence of comt in hpheo1 cells is seen , whether treated with differentiating factors or not. d. neurite formation in hpheo1 cells occurs after treatment with nerve growth factor ( ngf ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0065624.g003 figure 3 immunofluorescence reveals cd56 is positive in hpheo1 and pc - 12 cells .
cd31 is negative in hpheo1 but positive in huvec cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0065624.g004 figure 4 rna expression of catecholamine enzyme synthesis .
enzyme expression for catecholamine synthesis is down - regulated in hpheo1 cells , however comt expression is increased .
molecular fingerprinting hpheo1 is a new human progenitor cell line as shown in figure s2 , genomic analysis of hpheo1 cells compared with the powerplex panel of 9 highly informative microsatellite markers , demonstrate that hpheo1 cells are a new and unique cell line , which has not been reported before .
microarray gene expression hpheo1 cells have high comt expression figure s3 shows clustering analysis of gene expression profiles of human skin fibroblasts , hpheo1 cells , pheochromocytoma tumor tissue from which the hpheo1 cells were derived , and three normal adrenal medullary tissues .
the gene expression profiles between hpheo1 cells , tumor tissue , and normal adrenal medulla show distinctly different expressions from fibroblasts , indicating that hpheo1 cells are not fibroblasts .
figure 4 shows the rna expression of enzymes for catecholamine synthesis .
all of the enzymes are up regulated in the tumor tissue ( blue bars ) , but not in hpheo1 cells or primary culture cells , except for comt .
when comparing comt expressions between the groups , comt expression is 8 - fold higher in hpheo1 and in primary cultures compared with the tumor tissue .
comt is known to normally degrade catecholamines .
shrna was used to knockdown sdhb , ret and comt as an attempt to re - differentiate hpheo1 cells qpcr showed no evidence of re - differentiation of hpheo1 cells after gene knockdowns figure s4 shows qpcr results indicating evidence of reduced expression of sdhb , ret , and comt in hpheo1 cells after respective shrna knockdowns .
figure s5 shows no up - regulation in the differentiation markers of th , dbh or chromogranin a after stable shrna knockdown of sdhb , ret , and comt. with ret knockdown , there was a minimal increase in dopadc , yet the expression of other components for catecholamine synthesis were either unchanged or low .
on the other hand , with sdhb , ret , and comt knockdowns , dbh expression was more reduced compared to other differentiation markers .
discussion it has been difficult to grow human pheochromocytoma cells in culture because they derive from low - grade benign tumors that are often telomerase negative .
therefore , we adopted an approach to immortalize pheochromocytoma cells utilizing htert .
previous reports [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] describing immortalization of cells include infecting cells with virus expressing cdk4 in order to overcome p16 - induced premature senescence , so that the cell cycle continues to proceed .
in contrast , it was not necessary for us to add cdk4 , as hpheo1 cells were found to have a deletion in cdkn2a ( p16 gene ) with no other large genetic changes noted on karyotype and snp analysis .
it is unclear whether mutations in p16 are important for oncogenesis of pheochromocytoma .
an earlier study using semi - quantitative pcr indicated that deletion of the p16 gene may not be common in pheochromocytoma [ 27 ] , so this loss could have occurred during the establishment of the cells in culture .
in contrast , a recent report utilizing data from tissue microarray , quantitative real - time pcr , and methylation - specific pcr noted an overall frequency of genetic alterations involving the p16 gene in over 60 % of pheochromocytomas [ 28 ] .
the tumor tissue from which hpheo1 cells are derived did not grossly have a p16 gene deletion , however , it did show additional cytogenetic alterations not found in the hpheo1 line. of note , alterations of - 1p , - 3q , along with losses of 11p and 11q , have been previously reported in pheochromocytoma snp analysis [ 29 ] .
fingerprinting analysis between the cell line and the tumor tissue confirm that both cell populations derive from the same patient .
we speculate that the discrepancy in the snp data between the cell line and tumor tissue reflects that the line arose from a subclonal population of progenitor tumor cells , which acquired the necessary mutation ( loss of p16 ) in order to survive but did not contain some of the other molecular changes in the bulk of the tumor .
besides absence of p16 , we believe hpheo1 cells are a stable line since these cells retain high telomerase activity for over 300 population doublings .
in contrast , the primary pheochromocytoma cell cultures ( without htert ) ceased to grow after eight passages (~ 15 pds ) .
microarray expression data were examined to compare common contaminant cells in tissue culture such as fibroblasts to hpheo1 cells , shown in figure s3 .
the hierarchical clustering analysis clearly indicated that the gene expression profile of hpheo1 cells belong to the same group as tumor and the normal adrenal medulla , but very different from fibroblasts .
data from immunofluorescence staining also demonstrate that hpheo1 cells are not endothelial cells .
comparison analysis of the gene expression analysis between hpheo1 cells and the tumor tissue from which they derive also show many differences , yet several genes are highly expressed in both hpheo1 cells and pheochromocytoma tumor tissue , including transforming growth factor - beta receptor iii ( tgfbr3 ) , involved in differentiation between benign and malignant pheochromocytomas [ 30 ] ; loc399942 ; tubulin alpha - 2 chain transcript variant 5 , involved with overexpression in neuroblastoma [ 31 ] ; and breast cancer anti - estrogen resistance 1 ( bcar1 ) , related to the accelerated differentiation of pc - 12 cells in response to nerve growth factor ( ngf ) [ 32 ]. with ngf treatment , neurites develop in hpheo1 cells ( figure 2d ) and properties of differentiation become more apparent .
since the hpheo1 cells have fewer cytogenetic changes than most cells in the primary tumor , it is possible that the line derives from a premalignant clone that had yet to reach terminal telomere shortening and was rescued by the addition of htert in vitro .
this explanation is consistent with the model that premalignant cells must reach critical telomere shortening , followed by genomic instability , and then reactivation of telomerase to allow continued cell proliferation .
our data are consistent with this interpretation and suggest that hpheo1 , a progenitor line , may be a useful cell reagent for additional cancer progression studies .
all of the genes associated with catecholamine synthesis are highly expressed in the tumor tissue , but most are down - regulated in hpheo1 cells ( figure 4 ) related to dedifferentiation or down - regulation of some enzymes due to adaptation to monolayer culture .
in contrast , expression of comt , which is involved in breakdown of catecholamines , is 8 - fold higher in hpheo1 cells compared to the primary tumor as noted in rna expression .
since comt is important for the degradation of catecholamines , shrna was used to knockdown comt ; however , this did not induce the up - regulation of th , dopadc , or dbh for catecholamine production .
it appears that the inherent up - regulation of comt did not necessarily metabolize any catecholamines that might be produced .
in addition , shrna was used to knockdown other genes associated with pheochromocytoma pathogenesis such as sdhb ( figure s5 ) , yet markers for re - differentiation were not up - regulated either .
a possible explanation is that the genes associated with pheochromocytoma pathogenesis have been implicated more so with tumor growth than differentiation .
however , the expression of chromogranin a and pnmt being more robustly inducible with bmp4 , ngf , and dexamethasone does provide additional evidence that these cells are neuroendocrine in nature .
independent of hormone production , these cells should be useful for studying signaling pathways controlling growth and metastasis .
the rat and mouse pheochromocytoma cell lines are the most commonly used cell reagents to study the cell biology of pheochromocytoma , yet they might not utilize the same signaling pathways for growth and differentiation as in human tumors .
here , we describe the generation and characterization of a progenitor cell line derived from a human pheochromocytoma , hpheo1 .
the molecular alterations in these cells might provide clues to the pathways that are essential for catecholamine synthesis and explain why some of these tumors remain biochemically silent .
further study of hpheo1 cells will increase our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved in oncogenesis and tumor progression , which might facilitate the development of new treatment targets for pheochromocytoma .

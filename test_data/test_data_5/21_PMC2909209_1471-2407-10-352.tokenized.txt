background glutathione s - transferase pi ( gst pi ) is a subgroup of gst family , which provides cellular protection against free radical and carcinogenic compounds due to its detoxifying function .
expression patterns of gst pi have been studied in several carcinomas and its down - regulation was implicated to be involved in malignant transformation in patients with barrett 's esophagus .
however , neither the exact role of gst pi in the pathogenesis nor its prognostic impact in squamous esophageal carcinoma is fully characterized .
methods immunohistochemistry was used to investigate gst pi expression on 153 archival squamous esophageal carcinoma specimens with a gst pi monoclonal antibody .
statistic analyses were performed to explore its association with clinicopathological factors and clinical outcome .
results the gst pi expression was greatly reduced in tissues of esophageal carcinomas compared to adjacent normal tissues and residual benign tissues .
absent of gst pi protein expression in cytoplasm , nuclear and cytoplasm / nucleus was found in 51 % , 64.7 % and 48 % of all the carcinoma cases , respectively .
gst pi deficiency in cytoplasm , nucleus and cytoplasm / nucleus was significantly correlated to poor differentiation ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) .
uicc stage and t stage were found significantly correlated to negative expression of gst pi in cytoplasm ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.004 , respectively ) and cytoplasm / nucleus ( p = 0.017 and p = 0.031 , respectively ) .
in univariate analysis , absent of gst pi protein expression in cytoplasm , nucleus and cytoplasm / nucleus was significantly associated with a shorter overall survival ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) , whereas only gst pi cytoplasmic staining retained an independent prognostic significance ( p < 0.001 ) in multivariate analysis .
conclusions our results show that gst pi expression is down regulated in the squamous esophageal carcinoma , and that the lack of gst pi expression is associated with poor prognosis .
therefore , deficiency of gst pi protein expression may be an important mechanism involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of the squamous esophageal carcinoma , and the underlying mechanisms leading to decreased gst pi expression deserve further investigation .
background esophageal cancer ( ec ) ranks the third among most common cancer of the digestive tract and the seventh leading cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide [ 1,2 ]. with new cases accounting for nearly half new cases of the world per year , china is among the highest incidence areas [ 3 ] .
ec is usually diagnosed at late stages with a five - year survival rate of only 5 - 10 percent [ 3,4 ] .
surgical resection is believed to offer the best chance for long - term survival compared to other therapies such as radio - and chemotherapy , used alone or in combination as adjuvant treatments [ 3,5 - 8 ] .
however , surgical resection is often unavoidably followed by considerable compromised life - quality .
therefore , individualized therapy which benefits patients with the highest treatment efficiency yet the least morbidity is increasing stringent for treatment .
to pave the way for it , it is important to identify prognostic markers and predictors of significance value in this tumor [ 9 ] .
glutathione s - transferases ( gsts ) , a supergene family with at least four distinct isoforms ( alpha , mu , pi , theta ) identified in human , are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds in the phase ii detoxification [ 10 - 12 ] .
they are capable of converting a variety of electrophilic and hydrophobic compounds into more soluble , more easily excretable compounds through catalyzing them in conjunction with glutathione [ 10 ] .
as numerous potentially toxic carcinogenic compounds , being electrophilic and hydrophobic , are detoxified in this way , gsts is believed to play an important role in cancer prevention [ 13,14 ] .
down - regulation of gsts has been reported as an increased risk for developing gastric , colorectal , and lung cancer [ 15 - 17 ] .
decreased gst enzyme activity in the gastrointestinal track is implicated with a raised tumor incidence [ 2 ] .
gst pi , the predominant isoform in the normal squamous esophagus epithelium [ 18 ] , is present in a wide range of normal human tissues [ 18,19 ] , as well as in various malignant tumors of urinary , digestive , and respiratory tracts [ 20 - 24 ] .
no consensus has been achieved yet regarding to the association between gst pi expression and malignant transformation .
some studies suggest an increased expression of gst pi as an indicator for premalignant and malignant changes [ 25,26 ] ; whereas , in others , gst pi expression is indicated to be a marker of carcinogen exposure in the upper aerodigestive tract [ 27 - 30 ] .
meanwhile , in some studies , loss of gst pi expression is suggested as a phenotype associated with carcinogenesis [ 31,32 ] .
as to the alternation of gst pi in development of esophageal carcinoma , several studies have been performed on barrett 's metaplasia and adenocarcinoma with results suggesting deficiency of gst pi may contribute to an increased cancer risk [ 2,33,34 ] .
however , limited knowledge is available in terms of gst pi alternation in squamous esophageal carcinoma , as well as its connection with clinical parameters .
therefore , in the present study , we report results of an immunohistochemical survey of gst pi in 153 squamous esophageal carcinoma cases with a long term follow - up. our study confirms a down - regulated gst pi expression in this type of tumor , and demonstrates the deficiency of gst pi protein expression is significantly associated with a shorter overall survival .
methods patient materials one hundred and fifty - three patients composed by 93 men and 60 women with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma , whom underwent potentially curative surgery during 1989 - 1994 at anyang tumor hospital , henan , china , were enrolled in this retrospective study .
the median age at diagnosis was 56.4 years ( range 33 - 73 years ) .
no preoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy were given .
all tumors were staged according to international union against cancer ( uicc ) 2003 classification .
one hundred ( 65.4 %) cases were classified as stage ii and 53 ( 34.6 %) cases as iii .
all patients were followed up until death or 31 .
may , 2004 .
ninety - seven ( 63.4 %) patients died of esophageal cancer .
the median follow - up time for all patients was 90 months ( range 1 - 155 months ) .
the follow - up and data analyses were performed by researchers from both sides of this international cooperation project , anyang tumor hospital , china and the norwegian radium hospital , norway .
patients' information included tumor size , tnm staging , pathologic grade , demographic data and mortality .
study approval was given by the regional committee for medical research ethics in norway .
specimens removed from surgery were fixed in formalin , processed and embedded in paraffin blocks for diagnosis and research use .
histological specimens were reviewed by two of the co - authors ( z.s and j.m.n ) who had no access to clinical information .
the detailed description as to the tumor characteristics was listed in table 1 .

after evaluation , two representative tumor areas and one stroma area on each sample were selected , respectively .
the chosen regions were then removed from the original paraffin block to a recipient paraffin block by using the hollow - cored needles with the core - diameter of 0.6 mm. by this way , the pin - picked chosen tissues were arrayed on the recipient paraffin block .
finally , five mum sections made from those recipient paraffin blocks were cut and mounted on the charged super - frost plus glass slides , and ready for immunohistochemistry analysis after pre - dried at 60a ( o ) c in an oven for 2 - 4 hours .
for samples on which the representative areas were failed to choose for tissue array , five mum sections from the whole tissue paraffin blocks underwent immunohistochemical analysis as well .
immunohistochemical method dako envision ( tm ) + system , peroxidase ( dab ) ( k4007 , dako corporation , ca , and u.s.a ) was employed for immunostaining .
sections were first deparaffinized in xylene and microwaved in 10 mm citrate buffer ph 6.0 to unmask the epitopes , and then treated with 0.3 % hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) for 5 min to block the endogenous peroxidase .
afterwards , monoclonal glutathione - s - transferanse pi antibody ( clone 353 - 10 , 1:50 , from acris antibodies gmbh , germany ) was applied on the sections for 30 min at room temperature , followed by an incubation with the horzeradish peroxidase ( hrp ) labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti - mouse igg for 30 min at room temperature .
sections were then incubated with 3'3 - diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ( dab ) for 10 min , and counterstained with hematoxylin , dehydrated and mounted in diatex before evaluation .
immunostaining of each section was semiquantitatively scored for both intensity ( 1 , absent / weak ; 2 , moderate ; 3 , strong ) and extent of staining ( percentage of the positive tumor cells : 1 , < 10 % ; 2 , 10 - 50 % ; 3 , > 50 %) .
the scoring results of intensity and extent were multiplied to give a composite score ranging from 1 to 9 for each section .
examination of immunostaining was performed by two independent observers ( z.w and z.s ) with no knowledge of patients outcome .
all discordant scores were reviewed until final agreements were obtained .
statistical analyses the associations between gst pi protein expression and clinicopathologic variables were evaluated by the person chi2 test .
the kaplan - meier method were employed to estimate the survival rate .
a cox proportional hazards regression model was formed to perform multivariate evaluation of survival rates , after the fulfillment of proportional hazard assumption of variables was evaluated by stata statistical software package ( stata 10.0 , collage station , tx ) .
the calculation was performed by usage of the spss 16.0 statistical software package ( spss , chicago , il ) , and p a / 1000currency 0.05 was considered as statistical significance .
results frequency of gst pi protein expression the majority of cases contained adjacent normal tissues and residual benign tissues , on which strong positive staining presented and served as the internal control for both cytoplasm and nucleus .
immunostaining in adjacent normal tissues and residual benign tissues was found in parabasal , middle and top layers of the esophageal epithelium ( figure 1a and 1b ) .

negative expression of gst pi in cytoplasm , nucleus and cytoplasm / nucleus was significantly correlated to high histological grade ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) .
uicc stage and t stage were found significantly correlated to negative expression of gst pi in cytoplasm ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.004 , respectively ) and cytoplasm / nucleus ( p = 0.017 and p = 0.031 , respectively ) .
no significant associations were found between gst pi expression levels and age , gender , location , tumor size and lymph node metastasis .
in evalution of proportional hazard assumption of variables , it was found that variables including uicc stage , t stage and gst pi staining in cytoplasm , nucleus and cytoplasm / nucleus were qualified for such analysis , and all survival curves did not cross substantially .
histological grade did not fulfill proportional hazard assumption , but was used in multivariate analysis as a strata variate .
in univariate analysis , high uicc stage ( p < 0.001 ) , high t stage ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.001 ) , and gst pi staining in cytoplasm , nucleus and cytoplasm / nucleus ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 respectively ) were associated with poor overall survival ( figure 2 ) .
in multivariate analysis with histological grade as a strata variate , only t stage and gst pi cytoplasmic staining retained independent prognostic significance ( p < 0.001 , p < 0.001 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) ( table 3 ) .

discussion previously , gst pi expression in tissue and serum was suggested as a cancer marker in several studies [ 10,26 ] , with results showing inconsistent gst pi expression patterns in various carcinomas .
in gastric cancer , an increased serum gst pi was hypothesized to correlate to the advanced stage , and its expression in tissue was found inversely correlated to survival [ 35 ] .
in precancerous foci of colorectal polyps , an increased gst pi expression presented in the high grade adenoma [ 36 ] .
however , in prostate adenocarcinoma , down - regulation of gst pi was observed and the loss of gst pi expression was regarded as a phenotype associated with malignant transformation [ 31,37 ] .
in esophageal carcinomas , many studies showed that down - regulation of gst pi expression was involved in malignant progression from barrett 's esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma [ 2,34 ] .
the decreased gst pi expression was observed in barrett 's epithelium [ 2,34,38 ] , and lower gst pi mrna levels were detected by northern blot analysis and measurements of enzymatic activity [ 38 - 40 ] .
these studies anticipated that the absence of this detoxifying enzyme may play an important role in development and progression of esophageal carcinoma [ 38,41 ] .
however , a study on limited samples ( 53 samples from 19 patients ) by chandra et al .
[ 2 ] argued that high gst pi expression connoted a poor prognosis .
at the same time , the authors failed in finding statistical significant difference to the disease - free survival [ 2 ] .
in our present study , down - regulated gst pi was observed in squamous esophageal carcinomas , a finding which is rather consistent with the esophageal carcinoma studies by huang et al .
[ 42 ] and fu et al .
[ 43 ] .
both huang 's and our study find that loss of gst pi expression is associated with clinicopathological factor of high histological grade .
furthermore , our results also demonstrate that the reduced gst pi expression is correlated to the overall survival , indicating that gst pi down - regulation is not only associated with esophageal tumorigenesis , a process with a variety of genetic and epigenetic alterations [ 34,38,44 ] , but also with esophageal tumor progression .
gst pi polymorphism has been suggested to be involved in alternation of gst pi enzyme activity .
van et al .
[ 45 ] showed that the reduced gst pi enzyme activity in barrett 's esophagus was attribute to the expression of gst pi b , a genotype encoding gst pi enzyme with a less activity , compared with gst pi a. compton and coworkers [ 40 ] suggested that down - regulation of gst pi was second to the decreased gst pi mrna level , which happened in transcription step due to gene interactions [ 38 ] .
in addition , decreased level of gst pi was implied to connect with the epigenetic alternation , resulting in the transcriptional silence .
hypermethylation of cpg islands within promoter regions has been found in several genes , and has been implied to be responsible for down - regulation of their protein products [ 46 - 48 ] .
hypermethylation of gst pi gene , although happened at a low frequency , has been reported in esophageal adenocarcinomas [ 44 ] .
potential mechanisms accounting for down - regulation of gst pi in malignant transduction in barrett 's esophagus may take place in squamous esophageal carcinoma as well .
we speculate that epigenetic alterations may happen in squamous esophageal carcinomas and results in a decreased gst pi expression in this type of tumor .
limited knowledge is known whether an increased risk of cancer development is secondary to gst pi down - regulation or not , but some studies on esophagus have suggested that imbalance between redox and gst enzyme might get involved [ 2 ] .
according to the study of chandra et al .
[ 2 ] , redox molecular species may play double - edged roles .
on one side , they could kill tumor cells by inducing cell apoptosis and / or through other mechanisms .
on the other side , due to the redox - mediated damages on dna molecules , they could initiate a cascade of mutational events which promoted the development or progression of malignancy .
studies on noa ^( tm ) , a redox molecular , have found that upper aerodigestive track malignancies strongly expressed the enzymatic machinery necessary to generate noa ^( tm ) , in spite of its known physiologic roles on regulation of vascular blood flow and an assistance on killing infectious and malignant cells [ 49,50 ] .
the prevalence expression of noa ^( tm ) in tumor cells indicated a potential high concentration of noa ^( tm ) in microenvironment of tumor [ 1,33,51 ] raising concerns of mutagenesis due to breaking up the double - strand structure of dna molecules [ 52 ] .
however , effects of high noa ^( tm ) levels can be counteracted by glutathione [ 53 ] .
gst enzymes , by catalyzing glutathione to nucleophilic compounds , provide a key biochemical sink for free radicals and highly reactive molecules [ 2 ] .
lack of gst expression may lead to accumulation of redox - mediated dna damages in cells , contributing to genome instability as a result of an imbalance between gst enzymes and redox species .
as to development and progression of squamous esophageal carcinoma , we speculate that lack or loss of gst pi protein expression may predispose a normal cell to undergo further genetic alternations , raising risks of malignant changes ultimately and even tumor progression .
conclusions the present study , by using immunohistochemistry on 153 cases , confirms that the expression of gst pi is down - regulated in squamous esophageal epithermal carcinomas and significantly associated with poor overall survival .
deficiency of gst pi protein expression may be an important mechanism involved in the carcinogenesis and progression of esophageal squamous carcinomas .
further studies are deserved to explore the underlying mechanisms leading to decreased gst pi expression in this type of tumor .

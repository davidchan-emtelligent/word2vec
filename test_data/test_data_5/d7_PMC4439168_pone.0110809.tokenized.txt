the accumulation of a considerable quantity of gibberellin fermentation residue ( gfr ) during gibberellic acid a3 ( ga3 ) production not only results in the waste of many resources , but also poses a potential hazard to the environment , indicating that the safe treatment of gfr has become an urgent issue for ga3 industry .
the key to recycle gfr is converting it into an available resource and removing the ga3 residue .
to this end , we established a co - bioconversion process in this study using house fly larvae ( hfl ) and microbes ( corynebacterium variabile ) to convert gfr into insect biomass and organic fertilizer .
about 85.5 % ga3 in the gfr was removed under the following optimized solid - state fermentation conditions : 60 % gfr , 40 % rice straw powder , ph 8.5 and 6 days at 26degreesc .
a total of 371g housefly larvae meal and 2,064g digested residue were bio - converted from 3,500g raw gfr mixture contaning1 , 400g rice straw in the unit of ( calculated ) dry matter .
hfl meal derived from gfr contained 56.4 % protein , 21.6 % fat , and several essential amino acids , suggesting that it is a potential alternative animal feed protein source .
additionally , the digested gfr could be utilized as an organic fertilizer with a content of 3.2 % total nitrogen , 2.0 % inorganic phosphorus , 1.3 % potassium and 91.5 % organic matter .
this novel gfr bio - conversion method can mitigate potential environmental pollution and recycle the waste resources .

introduction as a phytohormone , gibberellins play an essential role in plant physiological responses , such as cell division , enlargement and differentiation , organ senescence and abscission [ 1 ] .
gibberellic acid ( ga3 ) , an important member of the gibberellin family , is gaining great attention all over the world due to its effective use in agriculture , nursery , tissue culture , etc. , and a reduction of its production costs could lead to wider applications for a variety of crops [ 2 , 3 ] .
for example , ga3 may be used to reduce flowering in fruit trees ( peaches , citrus , japanese plums ) or to improve growth of faba bean [ 4 ] .
industrially , ga3 is mainly produced by submerged fermentation using the ascomycetous fungus fusarium fujikuroi [ 4 ] , thus generating a huge amount of the byproduct of ga3 fermentation residue ( gfr ) in the downstream process .
gfr is mainly made of the filter cake which contains mycelium , the residual medium , and the remaining ga3 .
for instance , about 9,000 tons of gfr were produced per 100 tons of ga3 products in jiang xi new reyphon biochemical co. , ltd , jiangxi province , p. r. china .
the gfr contains more than 70 % water with a special fetid odor .
if piled up outdoor for a long time , the gfr not only pollutes the air , soil and groundwater , but also wastes resources .
more importantly , there may be more than 2,000 mug / g residual ga3 in gfr ( patent no cn 100387553 c ) .
as a plant hormone released into the environment , ga3 could be taken into the body through drinking water , food and other channels .
due to its similar molecular structure to steroids , the potential hazard of ga3 to human health should be considered .
ga3 , some herbicides and insecticides are classified as endocrine disruptors ( environmental endocrine disrupters ) [ 5 ] .
it has been reported that ga3 may cause a significant weight increase in animal 's endocrine organ , such as thyroid , ovaries and adrenal gland [ 6 ] .
the oral administration of an overdose of ga3 also induces liver tumors and adenocarcinoma for some animals [ 7 , 8 ] .
however , a great amount of ga3 is released into the environment , which will pose a huge potential risk for human health if gfr is not handled properly ; thus , how to recycle the gfr effectively has become an urgent issue .
currently , gfr is usually treated by land filling directly or composting , but there are some problems with these methods .
while direct composting of ga3 waste has some viability , most of the protein was converted into inorganic nitrogen , and there was about 80mug / g ga3 remaining in the treated gfr [ 9 ] .
our preliminary experiments showed that the rotten gfr was the main breeding ground for several kinds of cyclorrhapha flies , such as housefly ( musca domestica l. ) and boettcherisca peregrina ( robineau - desvoidy ) .
one of our previous studies proved that the gfr could be converted into flesh fly biomass for biodiesel production [ 10 ] .
our previous experiment also demonstrated that housefly larvae could live on the decaying gfr .
it is worth noting that the housefly had more clear biological background and each female housefly can lay approximately 9,000 eggs in a lifetime , obviously higher than that of the flesh fly , this indicates that house flies are easier to mass - rear [ 11 , 12 ] .
there are a lot of reports on the treatment of livestock manure with housefly [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] , but little information is available on how to handle gfr with housefly .
fortunately , some microorganisms showed high efficiency to degrade ga3 substrates when using them as the nutrition supply for the microorganisms [ 16 ] .
however , we need to seek out the microbe which has the potential to degrade ga3 by solid - state fermentation pretreatment so as to assist bioconversion of gfr via housefly larvae .
materials and methods raw materials the gfr was transported from jiang xi new reyphon biochemical co. , ltd , and stored at 4degreesc .
this gfr contained crude protein ( 25 %) , crude fat ( 14.9 %) , crude fiber ( 7.0 %) , and crude ash ( 5.6 %) ( dry matter , weight / weight ) .
the initial ga3 content of gfr was 140.5 mug / g. preliminary analysis results showed that rice straw powder ( weight / weight ) should be added into gfr to modify its properties for the normal growth of housefly larvae .
rice straw pieces used in this experiment were prepared from rice cultivar huajing 295 , a high - yield commercial cultivar adopted in hubei , china .
the straw was ground to 40 mesh and weighed after drying .
the as - prepared straw powder contained water ( 13.6 %) , crude protein ( 5.2 %) , crude fiber ( 34.7 %) , and crude ash ( 11.9 %) ( dry matter , weight / weight ) .
housefly colony has been maintained for more than 20 generations at huazhong agricultural university , wuhan , china [ 17 ] .
adults were reared on a diet ( brown sugar and milk powder 1:1 , weight : weight ) and water in a dish inside a nylon cage ( 1 x 1 x 1m , 20,000 individuals ) at 75 % relative humidity , 30degreesc , and 12:12 hour ( light : darkness ) .
larvae were fed with fermented wheat bran ( 65 % moisture ) which was used as oviposition substrate to induce adults to lay eggs .
the oviposition substrate was collected daily at 8:00 am. microorganism bacterial strain c. variabile q0029 was originally isolated from the marine culture collection preserved in the state key laboratory of agricultural microbiology , college of life science and technology , huazhong agricultural university , p. r. china .
all of the microorganisms in the marine culture collection were cultured in the ga3 medium ( ga3 10g , na2hpo4 4.8g , kh2po4 3g , nh4no3 2g , nacl 20g , dissolving 1l water , 115degreesc sterilization ) .
subsequently , c. variabile q0029 was picked out by dilution plate and spread plate methods and routinely cultivated in the ga3 medium at 30degreesc .
to investigate the ga3 degradative capabilities of c. variabile q0029 in the gfr , the water in the fresh gfr was adjusted to 90 % , and a portion of 50 ml liquid gfr was loaded separately into each of the six 150 ml flasks .
three of the flasks containing 1ml inoculum of the strain c. variabile q0029 were then cultured , and another three flasks free of c. variabile q0029 were also cultured as control ( three replicates , 28degreesc , 180 r / min ) .
5ml liquid gfr was sampled every 24 h for ga3 determination .
optimization of parameters affecting gfr solid state fermentation to improve the ga3 degradation efficiency , three principal factors were optimized : fermentation time , ph value , and the content of straw powder .
based on the preliminary experimental results , three replicates were made for the solid fermentation medium ( 65 % , moisture ) which consisted of 60 % gfr and 40 % straw powder with the ph adjusted to 7 by adding sodium hydroxide ( naoh ) , followed by 7 - d fermentation at 26degreesc and sampling every 24 h. five groups ( three replicates per group ) of solid fermentation mediums consisted of 40 % straw powder and 65 % moisture , using naoh to adjust the ph as follows : the original ( ph 4.0 ) , ph 6.5 , ph 8.5 , ph 10.5 and ph 12.5 .
the other five groups of mediums contained 65 % moisture at ph 8.5 , with gfr mixed separately with 20 % , 30 % , 40 % , 50 % and 60 % of the straw powder for each group .
after adding water and mixing gfr with rice straw , 300g solid medium was loaded in a 1l beaker ( per replicate ) with gauze for sealing , and 10 % ( volume / weight ) seed liquid of strain c. variabile q0029 was cultured in each medium .
all of the groups were fermented for 7 d at 26degreesc .
the seed liquid was prepared by inoculating strain c. variabile q0029 in lb medium at 28degreesc under shaking ( 180 rpm ) until od600 = 1 .
when fermentation was completed , all of the samples were frozen at - 20degreesc for the next use .
optimizing bioconversion of fermented gfr by varying rice straw powder content fig 1 depicts the bioconversion process of gfr employing hfl assisted by c. variabile q0029 .
based on the optimized solid - state fermentation conditions ( 65 % moisture , ph 8.5 ) , four groups of gfr containing 20 % , 30 % , 40 % , and 50 % straw powder were fermented for about 6 d for hfl medium preparation ( 3 replicates ) .
every 10 kg medium was placed in a plastic box ( 0.65 m x 0.43 m x 0.14 m ) in each replicate .
after pretreatment , approximately 10,000 naive hfl ( incubated on wheat bran about 1day ) were cultured in 1 kg medium for 6 d at 26degreescfor bioconversion .
the old hfl ( 3rd instar ) and the digested gfr were separated by sieving and weighed .
about 4 % of the old hfl was put into the cage for pupation .
the emergence of adult flies ( eclosion of pupae ) would occur after 5 d to produce eggs for hatching naive hfl .
the main hfl biomass ( 96 %) was weighed and dried at 80degreesc to constant weight .

analytical methods each sample ( gfr , larvae or organic fertilizer ) was ground to a homogenous powder with liquid nitrogen .
an accurately weighed sample powder of 5.00 g was placed into a 50ml polypropylene centrifuge tube , followed by lc / ms / ms determination by extracting ga3 from the samples as previously reported [ 18 ] .
liquid chromatography ( shimadzu , japan ) was used in the lc / ms / ms system .
the analyte was separated on a hypersil gold - c18 column ( 150 x 2.1 mm ) , with a column oven temperature of 25degreesc .
the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile : water with 0.15 % formic acid ( 35:65 ) , with a flow rate of 0.2 ml / min and an injection volume of 10 mul .
detection was performed by multiple reaction monitoring ( mrm ) mode of selected ions on an triple - quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo ion spray interface .
mass spectral conditions and the optimal parameters of mrm are listed in tables 1 and 2 , respectively .

ga3 reduction was calculated by the following equation : ga3 reduction (%) = ( ci - - ct ) / cix 100 where ci represents the initial amount of absolute ga3 in medium , and ct represents the amount of absolute ga3 at reaction time t. specific characteristics of the hfl meal such as crude protein , crude fat and crude ash were analyzed in our laboratory according to aoac methods 990.03 , 920.39 and 942.05 , respectively [ 19 ] .
calcium was determined with kmno4 dripping method according to gb / t 6436 - 2002 and phosphorus was analyzed by phosphorus vanadium molybdate yellow colorimetric method from gb / t6437 - 2002 .
zinc and manganese were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry method according to gb / t 13885 - 2003 .
the content of amino acids ( aa ) was determined using an automatic amino acid analyzer ( biochrom , uk ) according to gb / t 18246 - 2000 .
the data about ga3 reduction were subjected to one - way analysis of variance for a completely randomized design with three replicates in each treatment .
the significance of differences among treatments was tested by duncan 's multiple - range test and a level of p < 0.05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance [ 20 ] .
results and discussion ga3 degradative capabilities of c. variabile q0029 in gfr fig 2 shows effects of the culturing time on ga3 reduction in the liquid gfr ( 90 % , moisture ) treated with the c. variabile q0029 strain .
no significant changes were observed in ga3 reduction from day 1 to day 4 , but a dramatic ga3 reduction occurred from day 4 to day 7 .
compared with the control , 78.23 % of ga3 was degraded at day 7 .
it is known that c. variabile is equipped with an extensive set of enzymes , such as lipases and esterases , which participate in degradation of lipids [ 21 ] .
it was also reported that c. variabile has the capability of biodegrading acid red b with phenyl [ 22 ] .
interestingly , lactone and phenyl are present in ga3 standard chemical structure , but the detailed mechanism of ga3 biodegradation needs to be further studied .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0110809.g002 fig 2 ga3 degradation rate ( mean +/ - standard error ) using c. variabile q0029 strain at 28degreesc and 180 rpm .
control : inoculation with 1ml sterile water .
optimization of solid state fermentation parameters in this study , three parameters ( fermentation time , medium ph and rice straw powder content ) were optimized for gfr solid - state fermentation .
fig 3a shows the effect of the fermentation time on ga3 biodegradation efficiency .
the results indicated that the ga3 content in gfr reduced significantly in the initial 3 days , but slowly from day 3 to day 6 .
gfr reduction at day 7 was 64.1 +/ - 1.8 % , showing no significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) from 62.4 +/ - 1.5 % at day 6 .
hence , 6 d was selected for the optimum solid - state fermentation time .
it was worth noting that there was obvious difference between the solid and liquid medium in the ga3 degradation dynamics ( fig 2 ) .
this might be relevant to the pretreatment conditions , including inoculation amount , medium ph and medium composition .
fig 3b depicts the effect of the medium ph on ga3 biodegradation .
the medium ph value was found to have a positive influence on ga3 reduction within a ph range of 4.0 to 8.5 .
however , at a ph above 8.5 , no significant improvement was observed in ga3 reduction .
this could be attributed to the chemical properties of ga3 , stable in acidic conditions ( ph 3 - 4 ) , but unstable in the neutral or slight alkaline solution .
additionally , a high - ph medium was not suitable for the growth of c. variabile [ 21 ] .
therefore , ph 8.5 was selected as the optimal ph value for ga3 biodegradation .
fig 3c presents the effect of rice straw content on the ga3 reduction rate .
among the five proportions of rice straw in the medium ( 20 % , 30 % , 40 % , 50 % and 60 %) , ga3 reduction rate showed no significant increase ( p > 0.05 ) from 82.4 +/ - 1.9 % to 85.5 +/ - 2.5 % with a rice straw content increase from 20 % to 40 % .
however , the ga3 reduction rate showed a significantly sharp decline ( p < 0.05 ) to 26.4 +/ - 2.5 % with rice straw content approaching 60 % .
therefore , a rice straw content of 20 % - 40 % was selected as the optimal content for ga3 biodegradation .
generally , the ascomycetous fungus fusarium fujikuroi was initially separated from rice seedling as a pathogen , and large amounts of live fusarium fujikuroi are present in the gfr , which can facilitate the decomposition of the rice straw powder [ 23 ] .
the possible reason is that more rice straw powder (> 40 %) will promote the growth of fusarium fujikuroi .
in addition , we found that water in gfr with a high content of rice straw powder (> 40 %) would evaporate more easily than that with a low content of rice straw powder .

effect of rice straw powder ratios on hfl growth fig 4 presents the hfl yields and digested gfr derived from fermented gfr supplemented with four different ratios of rice straw powder ( weight / weight ) ( 20 % , 30 % , 40 % and 50 %) .
the yields of hfl increased from 4.97 % to 11.40 % with an increase of straw powder content from 20 % to 40 % , and the production of the rest digested gfr declined from 78.17 % to 60.83 % , indicating that fermented gfr with 40 % rice straw powder could be the most efficient resource for culturing hfl .
about 12.6 % boettcherisca peregrina larvae and 65.7 % digested gfr could be obtained when using the similar medium , but lower reproductively limits the scale of its application [ 10 , 13 ]. when the content of rice straw powder in gfr increased to 50 % , the hfl yield was only 5.13 % , but the amount of the remaining digested gfr increased significantly ( 74.67 %) .
the raw gfr is mainly made of filter cake , very dense and compact [ 9 ] .
it is necessary to add rice straw powder to make the gfr more suitable for hfl growth , but adding too much rice straw powder will reduce the hfl yield , because of lack of nutrition in the medium .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0110809.g004 fig 4 effect of the rice straw powder ratios in gfr on hfl yields ( mean +/ - standard error ) .
ga3 residue in the housefly larvae and digested grf as shown in fig 1 , a total of 3,500g raw gfr mixture contaning1400g rice straw was reduced to 3,395g hfl medium in the unit of ( calculated ) dry matter in the first 6 - day fermentation step .
then , a total of 371g hfl meal , and 2,064g digested residue and fractions containing byproducts , such as hfl pupea exuviae and adult body were obtained in the unit of ( calculated ) dry matter in the second bioconversion step .
on the other hand , ga3 residue was reduced from 843 mg to 122 mg during the fermentation step. c. variabile played an important role in ga3 biodegradation .
the remaining 122 mg ga3 residue in the hfl medium was reduced to about 37.19 mg after the bioconversion step .
thus , it can be concluded that more than 80 % of ga3 was degraded in the fermentation step , but the mechanism of ga3 biodegradation in c. variabile and hfl needs to be elucidated in the further study .
table 3 shows the remaining ga3 in hfl and digested gfr determined by lc / ms / ms. there is 0.12mug / g ga3 in the live hfl ( 70.3 % moisture ) , lower than 0.20 mug / g , which is the maximum ga3 residual levels in fruits ( 70 - 90 % moisture ) set by japan [ 24 ] .
this value indicates that the as - prepared hfl has met the standard of ga3 residual levels for animal feed .
the dried hfl meal ( 4.8 % moisture ) contained 0.78mug / g ga3 , indicating that drying ( 80degreesc ) and grinding process had no effect on ga3 degradation .
the raw gfr ( with 40 % rice straw powder ) had a ga3 content of 140.50mug / g , but after bioconversion with hfl and c. variabile q0029 , 92.2 % ga3 could be removed from gfr .

components analysis of digested gfr table 4 presents the results of components analysis of digested gfr based on china organic fertilizer standards ny525 - 2012 .
the digested gfr was found to have a moisture content of 29.8 % , a ph value of 8.5 , a total nutrient content ( tn + p2o5 + k2o ) of 6.5 % and an organic matter content of 91.5 % , which were all within the ny525 - 2012 standards .
as about 17.92mug / g ga3 remains in the digested gfr , the optimal dosage of the digested gfr as an organic fertilizer should be further investigated in the future .
it was reported that a low - dosage application of ga3 in brassica juncea l. seedling was favorable to seed germination and increased individual biomass , while a high - dosage application restrained seed germination and obviously reduced individual biomass [ 25 ] .
the components analysis result indicates that the digested gfr has a potential application in agriculture and nursery as a novel fertilizer .

nutritional analysis of hfl table 5 lists the main nutrients contained by hfl meal , hermetia illucens l. and white fish meal .
the hfl meal derived from gfr contains 56.4 % protein , which is higher than h. illucens ( 43.3 %) , and close to the white fish meal ( 60.0 %) .
hfl has been proved to be a potential alternative animal feed protein source in many previous studies [ 26 , 27 ] .
the hfl meal contained 21.6 % of crude fat , lower than that of h. illucens , but much higher than that of the white fish meal .
hfl oil could be extracted and utilized as a novel feedstock for biodiesel production in our previous study [ 17 ] .
crude ash in hfl meal was 10.8 % , nearly 50 % that of the white fish meal ( 20.0 %) , but slightly higher than that of h. illucens ( 8.4 %) .
mineral elements such as calcium ( 1.1 %) , zinc ( 252 mg / kg ) and manganese ( 258 mg / kg ) in the hfl meal were obviously lower than those of h. illucens .
phosphorus in the hfl meal ( 1.6 %) was nearly twice that of h. illucens ( 0.9 %) , but lower than that of the white fish meal ( 2.3 %) .

table 6 displays the essential amino acids ( aa ) contents in hlm , h. illucens and white fish meal .
the aa content in the hfl meal was obviously higher than that of h. illucens , indicating that hfl meal had advantages over h. illucens prepupae as an alternative animal feed protein source .
meanwhile , there are many noticeable differences between hfl meal and white fish meal .
lysine in hfl meal was only 2.28 % , far below that of white fish meal ( 4.41 %) , but the contents of methionine ( 1.18 %) and threonine ( 2.06 %) in the hfl meal were close to those of h. illucens .
generally , the essential amino acids , methionine , lysine and threonine are only present in limited quantities in the crude feed materials , such as wheat bran , peas , rapeseed meal and soybean meal .
therefore , the bioconversion of gfr into hfl biomass can not only mitigate environmental pressure , but also save food .

conclusions in this study , the gfr was initially pretreated by solid - state fermentation with one strain of corynebacterium variabile capable of degrading ga3 , and the fermented gfr was then converted into larvae biomass via housefly .
more than 90 % ga3 residue was removed from gfr by co - conversion of hfl and c. variabile q0029 under the optimized solid - state fermentation conditions .
ga3 in the live hfl derived from the fermented gfr was 0.12 mug / g , suggesting that this hfl might be used as an alternative animal feed protein source .
the properties of digested gfr were all within china organic fertilizer standards ( ny525 - 2012 ) .
it can be concluded from the comprehensive analysis results that hfl with the assistance of microbes has the potential to recycle gfr into insect biomass and organic fertilizer , and reduce the environmental pollution of the wastes .

this 5d dataset can be displayed in a variety of ways to study disease states that exhibit variations in cardiac function with respect to respiration , such as pericardial tamponade / constriction and diastolic dysfunction .
background in conventional cardiac mri , respiratory effects are suspended or counteracted to avoid artifacts .
however , in many disease states , such as pericardial tamponade / constriction and diastolic dysfunction , it is precisely variations in cardiac morphology / function with respect to respiratory changes that reflect the pathophysiology and should be studied .
in this work , we image the heart during free breathing and explicitly resolve a 3d volume over both cardiac and respiratory cycles .
we explore a range of options for visualizing the information captured in this 5d state of the heart .
methods free - breathing 5d cardiac mri scans were conducted on a ge signa 1.5 t excite system .
a non - cartesian 3d cones sampling trajectory ( fig. 1a ) was used to achieve 4 - fold acceleration ( vs. cartesian ) and provide greater robustness to motion / flow and undersampling .
data were obtained in the short - axis orientation with fov of 36x36x8 cm3 and resolution of 2.4x2.4x8 mm3 .
cardiac and respiratory signals were recorded concurrently during the scan ( fig. 1b ) and used to retrospectively reorder the readouts into a dataset of dimensions [ 3d spatial information , 1d cardiac cycle , 1d respiratory cycle ] .
total scan time ranged from 2 to 5 min depending on the respiratory rate .
figure 1 ( a ) 3d cones sampling trajectory .
( b ) the respiratory phase ( respph ) and cardiac phase ( cardph ) of each readout are retrospectively determined from the recorded physiologic signals .
acquired data are then re - ordered and reconstructed to obtain a 5d dataset .
results fig. 2 shows representative data obtained from a healthy volunteer over 4 min 30 sec and reconstructed with 14 cardiac phases and 8 respiratory phases .
a view of all 10 slices at cardiac phase 10 of 14 ( end diastole ) and respiratory phase 4 of 8 ( end expiration ) is displayed in fig. 2a .
in this view , we can re - display the 5d data as ( 1 ) a typical cardiac cine at a fixed respiratory phase , or ( 2 ) a respiratory cine at a fixed cardiac phase .
an example of a respiratory cine of slice 5 and cardiac phase 10 is shown in fig. 2b , where displacement of the diaphragm over respiratory phases 1 through 5 is readily appreciated .
it is also useful to display a column of pixels in m - mode to visualize changes in the relative positions of chambers and interfaces over either the cardiac or respiratory cycle ( fig. 2c ) .
volumes and ejection fractions can also be measured with respect to respiratory - induced pressure changes and used to investigate diastolic dysfunction .

conclusions free - breathing 5d cardiac mri is a rapid and robust technique for capturing a respiratory - resolved view of the heart .
respiratory cine and m - mode displays can help to visualize phenomena such as inspiratory septal shift in constrictive disease .
other display options , such as volume - rendered cines , are also possible .

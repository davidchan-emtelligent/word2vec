purpose the retinoblastoma ( rb ) gene family member p130 binds preferentially to the e2f5 transcription factor and forms a repressive e2f5 / p130 complex that inhibits cell cycle progression and tumor growth .
it is unclear whether e2f5 , either alone or in combination with p130 , can interfere with the transcriptional activity of other e2f family members , such as e2f1 and e2f3a , in vivo .
in this study , we used transgenic mice to test whether overexpression of e2f5 with / without p130 would be sufficient to inhibit e2f1 or e2f3a induced cell cycle reentry .
methods transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of constructs containing different e2f cdnas ( e2f1 , e2f3a , and e2f5 ) or the p130 cdna linked to the mouse alphaa - crystallin promoter .
the e2f5 single and e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice were cross - mated with e2f1 or e2f3a transgenic mice .
the resulting double or triple transgenic mouse embryos were characterized by histology , in situ hybridization , immunohistochemistry , and brdu incorporation assays .
results overexpression of e2f5 alone was not sufficient to inhibit e2f1 or e2f3a induced cell cycle reentry in lens fiber cells .
transgenic mice coexpressing e2f5 and p130 in lens fiber cells did not show lens defects .
however , coexpression of e2f5 / p130 with e2f1 or e2f3a in lens fiber cells decreased the number of brdu positive fiber cells induced by the e2f1 or e2f3a alone .
therefore , overexpression of e2f5 / p130 , but not e2f5 alone , can inhibit activator e2f - mediated cell proliferation in vivo , confirming that p130 plays a critical role in the repressive activity of e2f5 / p130 complex .
conclusions overexpression of e2f5 / p130 in post - mitotic lens fiber cells does not affect their normal differentiation program , but can inhibit inappropriate cell cycle reentry induced by the activator e2fs .
since e2f5 alone cannot interfere with these e2f activities , we conclude that p130 is a key player in the inhibitory process .

because the main region of sequence similarity between these proteins resides in a pocket domain , they are often referred to as the " pocket proteins " [ 1 ] .
these proteins play important roles in many aspects of development , particularly in the regulation of cell cycle progression .
although they share many biochemical similarities and have extensive functional overlap , these pocket proteins are not equivalent .
for example , in humans , a germ - line mutation of the rb1 gene can lead to development of retinoblastoma , a highly malignant intra - ocular tumor that arises in the neural retina of infant eyes .
unlike the rb1 gene , the gene encoding p130 is located in chromosome 16q12.2 , and deletions in this area are related to several human cancers including prostate , breast , and ovarian cancers [ 2 ] .
in mice , rb1 null embryos die around day 13 of gestation with defects in placental , erythroid , neuronal , and lens development [ 3,4 ] .
in contrast , mice deficient in p107 or p130 develop normally and exhibit no overt adult phenotypes [ 5 ] .
the tumor suppressive properties of these pocket proteins are known to be dependent upon their ability to bind to the e2f family of transcription factors and to form a repressive rb - e2f complex [ 6 - 8 ] .
there are currently nine e2f genes ( e2f1 , e2f2 , e2f3a , e2f3b , e2f4 , e2f5 , e2f6 , e2f7 , and e2f8 ) identified in mammals [ 9,10 ] .
based on their functional considerations , these e2f proteins can be classified into either " activators " ( e2f1 , e2f2 , and e2f3a ) or " repressors " ( e2f3b , e2f4 , e2f5 , e2f6 , e2f7 , and e2f8 ) .
the activator e2fs contain a nuclear localization signal ( nls ) and are predominantly in the nucleus .
they bind with high affinity to prb , and their expression is highly upregulated in late g1 of the cell cycle .
ectopic expression of any of them is sufficient to induce g1 / s transition and cell proliferation [ 9 - 13 ] .
in contrast , the repressors e2f4 and e2f5 do not have such an nls domain , therefore , are primarily in the cytoplasm .
these two e2fs bind with high affinity to the prb homologs , p107 and p130 [ 8 - 10 ] .
they are mainly expressed in quiescent cells , and can activate transcription only under some circumstances [ 9,10,14,15 ] .
the members of e2f6 , e2f7 , and e2f8 , do not have a pocket protein interaction domain and are believed to repress transcription of specific promoters [ 9,10 ] .
the complexity of the e2f family suggests that individual e2f proteins play distinct roles in the regulation of cell proliferation , as described by our previous observations and many studies from others [ 9 - 11,13 - 15 ] .
however , it is not yet clear whether individual e2fs could interact with each other .
the prb homolog p130 is thought to be a tumor suppressor , and overexpression of p130 can inhibit cell proliferation by forming a strong repressive complex with e2f4 and e2f5 [ 2,9,16 - 20 ] .
knockout studies showed that e2f4 and e2f5 are necessary for the pocket protein - mediated g1 control of the cell cycle , because mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( mefs ) deficient for these two e2fs are unable to exit the cell cycle in response to p16ink4a [ 21 ] .
however , so far , there is no in vivo evidence showing that extra e2f4 or e2f5 , in the absence or presence of extra p130 , can interfere with the activities of activator e2fs .
here , we test whether overexpression of e2f5 with / without p130 is sufficient to repress cell cycle reentry induced by activator e2fs in post - mitotic lens fiber cells .
figure 1 generation and characterization of e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice .
a : microinjected constructs .
human e2f5 and mouse p130 cdnas were linked to the deltaenhancer alphaa - crystallin promoter in vector deltaenalphaa - minx ( dream ) [ 30 ] .

the e2f5 ( d ) and p130 ( e ) transgenes were expressed in lens fiber cells .
the size of lens in panel e is smaller as this section is more peripheral .

figure 2 expression of transgenes in e2f1 / e2f5 bigenic eyes at e14.5 .
in situ hybridizations with human e2f1 and e2f5 riboprobes were used to confirm expression of e2f1 and e2f5 transgenes .
hybridization signals were captured as bright - ( a , b , e , f ) and dark - ( c , d , g , h ) field images .
transcripts of the endogenous e2f1 and e2f5 were detected in non - transgenic fvb lens epithelial and corneal cells ( c , g ) .
endogenous e2f5 , but not e2f1 , was also detectable in the fvb lens fiber cells ( c , g ). by comparison , both transgenes were highly expressed in the bigenic lens fiber cells ( b , d , f , h ) , as described previously [ 15,29 ] .

the embryonic lens of the eye is an attractive model system for studying the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation .
the lens is composed of two cell types : anterior proliferative epithelial cells and posterior terminally differentiated , post - mitotic , elongated fiber cells [ 22 ] .
lens epithelial cells at the bow region are stimulated to exit from cell cycle and to differentiate into fiber cells .
almost all e2f family members are expressed in lens epithelial cells , while only e2f1 , e2f3 and e2f5 are detected in post - mitotic lens fibers [ 23 ] .
prb and p107 proteins were detected in both lens epithelial and fiber cells [ 23 ] .
since p130 / e2f complexes were not detected in lens fiber cells , it was proposed that prb and p107 are the primary regulators of e2f activities in differentiating lens fiber cells [ 23 ] .
previous studies have shown that inactivation of prb by targeted mutagenesis of the rb gene , or by expression of viral proteins , results in inappropriate cell cycle reentry in lens fiber cells [ 24 - 27 ] .
the activator e2fs , particularly e2f3 , make a major contribution toward the in vivo phenotypic consequences of prb deficiency [ 28 ] .
although both e2f5 and p130 are considered to play important roles in the regulation of cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation , it is not known whether elevated levels of e2f5 in combination with p130 would be able to alter lens fiber cell differentiation program .
in this study , we have generated double transgenic mice with lens - specific coexpression of e2f5 with e2f1 or e2f3a .
we have also generated transgenic mice coexpressing e2f5 with p130 in the lens fiber cells , and triple transgenic mice coexpressing e2f5 / p130 with e2f1 or e2f3a .
we found that overexpression of e2f5 / p130 in the lens fiber cells did not alter normal fiber cell differentiation .
overexpression of e2f5 alone was not sufficient to repress inappropriate cell cycle entry induced by e2f1 or e2f3a .
however , cell cycle reentry was significantly inhibited by overexpression of e2f5 / p130 .
figure 3 characterization of e2f1 / e2f5 bigenic eyes at e14.5 .
when compared with fvb lens ( a ) , the bigenic lens histology shows alterations in fiber cell elongation , and the presence of extra nuclei in the center of the lens ( b ) , similar to the lens phenotype in the e2f1 single transgenic lens [ 29 ] .
there are no brdu positive fiber cells ( brown nuclear stain ) in the fvb lens ( c ) .
brdu positive fiber cells were prevalent in the double transgenic lens ( d ) .

methods generation of the constructs and transgenic mice all animals were used in accordance with the arvo statement for the use of animals in ophthalmic and vision research .
human e2f1 , myc - tagged mouse e2f3a and human e2f5 transgenic lines were generated as previously described [ 15,29 ] .
e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice were generated by coinjection .
a sac ii - xba i fragment containing the human e2f5 cdna and a cla i - ecor v fragment carrying mouse p130 cdna were cloned downstream from the deltaenhancer / alphaa - crystallin promoter in the vector deltaenalphaa - minx ( dream ) [ 30 ] .
the resultant plasmids ( figure 1a ) were digested with kpni and noti to release fragments for microinjection .
the fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.2 % agarose gel and purified using a qiaex ii gel extraction kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear coinjection of both fragments into one - cell - stage inbred fvb / n embryos [ 31,32 ] .
two stable transgenic families ( ove1811 and ove1812 ) expressing both e2f5 and p130 transgenes were generated from the coinjection .
e2f5 single ( ove1598 ) and e2f5 / p130 double ( ove1811 ) transgenic mice were cross - mated with e2f1 ( ove527 ) or e2f3a ( ove1728 ) transgenic mice to generate double ( e2f5 / e2f1 or e2f5 / e2f3a ) and triple ( e2f5 / p130 / e2f1 or e2f5 / p130 / e2f3a ) transgenic mice .
screening of transgenic mice genomic dna from mouse tails was isolated as previously described [ 31 ] .
for polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) screening of e2f1 , e2f3a , and e2f5 single transgenic mice , sense ( 5 ' - gtg aag gaa cct tac ttc tgt ggt g ) and antisense ( 5 ' - gtc ctt ggg gtc ttc tac cct ttc tc ) primers specific to the simian virus ( sv ) 40 sequences in cpv2 were used to amplify a ~ 300 bp fragment .
to screen for the e2f5 and p130 transgenes driven by the deltaenhancer / alphaa - crystallin ( dream ) promoter , we used the following primers : 1 ) minx sense : 5 ' - gtc ttt cca gtg ggg atg ctc t - 3 ' ; 2 ) e2f5 antisense : 5 ' - tcc tgc agc agc gac acg aa - 3 ' ; 3 ) p130 antisense : 5 ' - gct gct gga tct gat ggc tc - 3 ' .
a ~ 400 bp fragment was amplified by the minx / e2f5 or minx / p130 primers .
pcr assays were performed as described previously [ 29 ] .
lens histology female transgenic mice were superovulated and mated with male transgenic mice .
the presence of a vaginal plug was defined as gestational day 0.5 .
embryonic heads at embryonic day ( e ) 14.5 and 15.5 were fixed in 10 % formalin , paraffin embedded , cut into 5 - mum thick sections , and stained with hematoxylin and eosin by standard techniques .

figure 5 expression of myc - e2f3a and e2f5 proteins .
immunohistochemistry was used to assay expression of the e2f3a and e2f5 transgenic proteins in non - transgenic fvb ( a , c ) and the e2f3a / e2f5 double transgenic lenses ( b , d ) .
using anti - myc antibody , there is no green staining in fvb lens ( a ). by comparison , green nuclear staining is present in the transgenic lens fiber cells ( b ) indicative of myc - tagged e2f3a expression .
when antibody against e2f5 was used , endogenous e2f5 in fvb lens fiber cells was detected as a weak green nuclear staining ( c ) .
a stronger signal was present in the double transgenic fiber cell nuclei ( d ) .
scale bars = 500 mum .
in situ hybridization in situ hybridization was performed using 35s - labeled riboprobes , as described in fromm and overbeek [ 33 ] .
an sv40 - specific riboprobe and the probes for e2f1 , e2f3a , and e2f5 were described previously [ 15,29 ] .
a riboprobe for mouse p130 was generated from plasmid p130 / pbluscript .
hybridization signals were initially captured as dark - field images .
for some of the figures , the dark - field images were pseudo - colored red , then superimposed on bright - field images of the same tissue section ( counterstained by hematoxylin ) using image analysis software ( photoshop ; adobe , san diego , ca ) .
brdu incorporation dna replication was detected by 5 - bromo - 2 ' - deoxyuridine ( brdu ) incorporation .
brdu ( 100 mug / g bodyweight ; sigma - aldrich co. , st. louis , mo ) was injected into pregnant female mice .
one hour later , the mice were sacrificed and embryos were analyzed by immunohistochemistry as described previously [ 25 ] .
for quantification , the tissue slides containing mid - frontal lens sections were selected for brdu staining , and the number of brdu - positive nuclei in lens fiber cells was counted and compared with the total number of nuclei in the same region , determined by hemotoxylin staining .
results are the mean +/ - sd from four individual tissue slides ( each slide was from different transgenic tissue block and contained at least 3 eye sections ) .
statistical analyses were performed with two - tailed student 's t - tests using microsoft excel software .
data were considered to be significantly different for p < 0.05 .
figure 6 expression of e2f3a / e2f5 / p130 proteins at e15.5 .
immunohistochemistry was used to assess expression of e2f3a , e2f5 and p130 proteins in non - transgenic fvb ( a , b , e , f , i , j ) and triple transgenic lenses ( c , d , g , h , k , l ) .
there was no positive staining for myc - e2f3a ( a ) or p130 ( i ) in fvb lens fiber cells. by comparison , intensive green nuclear staining was seen in the triple transgenic lens fiber cells for all three proteins ( c , g , k ) .
cell nuclei were visualized by dapi staining ( b , d , f , h , j , l ) .

figure 9 transcription of e2f1 / e2f5 / p130 transgenes at e15.5 .
in situ hybridizations were used to assay expression of the e2f1 , e2f5 and p130 transgenes using sv40 ( for e2f1 ) , human e2f5 and mouse p130 riboprobes .
bright - field ( a , c , e ) and dark - field ( b , d , f ) images are shown .
the transgenes were expressed specifically in lens fiber cells .
transcription signals of p130 ( f ) were much weaker than the e2f1 ( b ) and e2f5 ( d ) transgenes .
scale bars = 500 mum .
immunohistochemistry tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded alcohol series , washed with pbs , and incubated with 10 % methanol / 3 % hydrogen peroxide in pbs to block endogenous peroxidase activity .
slides were boiled in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer ( ph 6.0 ) for 20 min using a microwave oven , and then incubated with 10 % normal horse serum for 1 h at 37 degreesc .
for detection of e2f5 , p130 , and myc - tagged e2f3a transgenic proteins , primary antibodies against e2f5 ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca ) , p130 ( sigma - aldrich co. ) , or myc ( sigma - aldrich co. ) were used at a 1:500 dilution in 10 % normal horse serum in pbs , with incubation at 4 degreesc for 24 h. the slides were washed with pbs ( 4 x 5 min ) , and a secondary antibody ( 1:200 ; biotin - conjugated anti - rabbit or anti - mouse igg ; vector laboratories , burlingame , ca ) was added for 1 h at room temperature .
after washing 4 times with pbs , extravidin - fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate ( sigma - aldrich co. ) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature , followed by pbs washes .
the slides were mounted with aqua - poly / mount ( vector laboratories ) .
results overexpression of e2f5 does not affect e2f1 - induced cell cycle reentry in our previous studies , we generated transgenic mice specifically expressing e2f1 or e2f5 in lens fiber cells [ 15,29 ] .
at e15.5 , the e2f1 lenses ( ove527 and ove530 ) showed severe defects in fiber cell elongation and alignment .
at the posterior of these transgenic lenses , there were many extra nuclei which incorporated brdu indicative of inappropriate cell cycle reentry , and many condensed fiber nuclei indicative of apoptosis [ 29 ]. by comparison , the transgenic mice in each e2f5 family ( ove1598 and ove1599 ) showed a normal eye phenotype , and there were no extra brdu positive nuclei in the e2f5 expressing lens fiber cells [ 15 ] .
since e2f5 is thought to be a cell cycle " repressor ," we tested whether overexpression of e2f5 was sufficient to inhibit the e2f1 - induced cell cycle reentry .
homozygous e2f1 mice ( ove527 ) were cross - mated with e2f5 transgenic mice ( ove1598 ) to generate e2f1 / e2f5 double transgenic mice .
to confirm expression of transgenes , in situ hybridization was performed using riboprobes for human e2f1 or e2f5 .
at e14.5 , transcripts of the endogenous e2f1 and e2f5 were detected in non - transgenic fvb lens epithelial and corneal cells ( figure 2c,g ) , suggesting that these human e2f1 and e2f5 riboprobes cross - reacted to the mouse e2f1 and e2f5 transcripts .
endogenous e2f5 , but not e2f1 , was also detectable in the fvb lens fiber cells ( figure 2c,g ). by comparison , e2f1 and e2f5 transgenes were highly expressed in the double transgenic lens fiber cells ( figure 2b,d,f,h ) .
the double transgenic lenses showed defects in fiber cell elongation ( figure 2b ) , and many brdu positive lens fiber cells ( figure 3d ) .
the percentage of brdu positive fiber cells between e2f1 single and e2f1 / e2f5 double transgenic lenses was not significant ( p > 0.05 ; table 1 ) .
therefore , overexpression of e2f5 alone is not sufficient to repress e2f1 - induced cell cycle reentry .
overexpression of e2f5 does not affect e2f3a - induced cell cycle reentry e2f3a transgenic mice have small eyes and cataracts , similar to the e2f1 transgenic mice with brdu positive fiber nuclei and enhanced programmed cell death [ 15,29 ] .
to determine whether overexpression of e2f5 could alter the e2f3a phenotype , e2f3a transgenic mice ( ove1728 ) were cross - mated with the e2f5 transgenic mice ( ove1598 ) to generate the e2f3a / e2f5 double transgenic mice .
at e15.5 , in situ hybridization revealed that both transgenes were expressed in lens fiber cells , and that e2f5 was more highly expressed at the rna level ( figure 4a,b ) .
lens morphology and the number of brdu positive fiber cells in the e2f3a / e2f5 double transgenic lenses were similar to that seen in the e2f3a single transgenic lenses ( p > 0.05 ; figure 4c,d ; table 1 ) [ 15 ] .
to verify expression of both transgenic proteins , immunohistochemistry was performed using anti - myc antibody for the e2f3a and anti - e2f5 for the e2f5 transgene .
as shown in figure 5 , there was no staining for myc - tagged protein in the non - transgenic lens ( figure 5a ). by comparison , immunofluorescent staining was seen in the nuclei of the transgenic lens fibers confirming expression of the e2f3a transgene ( figure 5b ) .
we previously showed that in the non - transgenic fvb lens , there was weak staining for endogenous e2f5 protein in fiber cell nuclei ( figure 5c ) [ 15 ] .
the intensity of e2f5 staining was stronger in the transgenic lens ( figure 5d ) , indicating the presence of extra transgenic e2f5 protein .
therefore , overexpression of e2f5 alone is not sufficient to inhibit e2f3a - induced cell cycle reentry .
generation of e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice the prb homolog p130 is a binding partner of e2f5 .
it has been known that overexpression of p130 can lead to a g1 cell cycle arrest in cultured cells [ 34 ] .
since e2f5 and p130 complex are thought to be important in the regulation of cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation , we wanted to test whether coexpression of e2f5 and p130 would be able to alter normal lens fiber cell differentiation .
to generate transgenic mice expressing both e2f5 and p130 , we co - injected dream - e2f5 and dream - p130 constructs ( figure 1a ) .
two stable bigenic families ( ove1811 and ove1812 ) were obtained from the coinjection .
mice in both families showed a normal eye phenotype .
overexpression of e2f5 / p130 does not affect normal lens fiber cell differentiation the lens morphology in the e2f5 / p130 double transgenic embryos at e15.5 was similar to that seen in nontransgenic or e2f5 only transgenic lenses ( figure 1b ) [ 15 ] .
there was no brdu incorporation detected in the bigenic lens fiber cells ( figure 1c ) .
in situ hybridization revealed that transcripts of e2f5 and p130 were present specifically in the transgenic lens fiber cells ( figure 1d,e ) .
a previous study showed that e2f / p130 complexes were undetectable in rat lens fiber cells , probably due to degradation of the p130 protein by ubiquitination [ 23 ] .
to test the presence of p130 and e2f5 transgenic proteins , immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against p130 and e2f5 .
in the nontransgenic fvb lens , shown in the next section , there was no staining for p130 protein in fiber cells ( figure 6i ) , consistent with the previous observation [ 23 ]. by comparison , both p130 and e2f5 protein staining are present in lens fiber cell nuclei of the double transgenic mice ( figure 1f,g ) .
expression of e2f5 / p130 decreases e2f3a - induced cell cycle reentry hypophosphorylated p130 forms a repressor complex with the e2f4 , which can block e2f - responsive promoter sites , and can inhibit the g1 / s transition of the cell cycle [ 18 - 20 ] .
we hypothesized that the e2f5 / p130 complex could also function as a cell cycle repressor in vivo .
to examine whether coexpression of e2f5 and p130 can inhibit cell proliferation induced by e2f3a , e2f3a transgenic mice ( family ove1728 ) were cross - mated with the e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice ( ove1811 ) to generate triple transgenic mice .
at e15.5 , when compared to nontransgenic fvb lenses ( figure 7a,d ) , the e2f3a single transgenic lenses showed defects in fiber cell elongation and brdu positive fiber cells ( figure 7b,e ) [ 15 ] .
the triple transgenic lenses showed less severe pathology ( figure 7c ) .
although condensed fiber cell nuclei were still present in the center of the triple transgenic lens ( figure 7c ) , the number of brdu positive fiber nuclei was decreased by about 50 % ( p < 0.01 ; figure 7f ; table 1 ) .
immunohistochemistry showed staining for myc - tagged e2f3a , e2f5 and p130 proteins in most of the triple transgenic lens fiber cell nuclei ( figure 6c,g,k ) when compared to the non - transgenic fvb lenses ( figure 6a,e,i ) , confirming the expression of these transgenic proteins .
expression of e2f5 / p130 inhibits e2f1 - induced cell cycle reentry to test whether coexpression of e2f5 and p130 could also inhibit e2f1 - induced cell cycle reentry , e2f1 transgenic mice ( family ove527 ) were cross - mated with the e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice from family ove1811 to generate triple transgenic mice .
at e15.5 , the triple transgenic lenses still showed defects in fiber cell elongation and alignment , although slightly less severe than the e2f1 single transgenic lenses ( figure 8a,b ) [ 29 ] .
condensed fiber cell nuclei were still present in the center of the triple transgenic lens ( figure 8b ) , indicating that these cells were undergoing programmed cell death .
however , the number of brdu positive fiber cell nuclei in the triple transgenic lenses was decreased by 80 % ( p < 0.01 ; figure 8c,d ; table 1 ) [ 29 ] , suggesting that e2f5 / p130 expression causes a dramatic reduction in e2f1 activity .
the expression of e2f1 , e2f5 and p130 transgenes in the triple transgenic lens fiber cells was confirmed by in situ hybridization ( figure 9 ) .
when compared to the intensity of e2f1 or e2f5 transcription signals ( figure 9b,d ) , the level of p130 transgene expression was low ( figure 9f ) .
discussion e2f4 and e2f5 are thought to be cell cycle repressors as e2f4 - / - and / or e2f5 - / - cells are unable to exit the cell cycle in response to p16ink4a [ 21 ] .
our previous transgenic studies demonstrated that e2f4 can function as a weak cell cycle activator and can induce cell cycle reentry in post - mitotic lens fiber cells [ 15 ] .
in this study , we have expressed e2f5 , with / without p130 , together with e2f1 or e2f3a in the ocular lens of transgenic mice to assess the prediction that e2f5 can inhibit or repress cell cycle progression .
our results indicate that overexpression of e2f5 alone was not sufficient to inhibit cell cycle reentry induced by the cell cycle activators e2f1 and e2f3a .
bigenic expression of e2f5 and p130 in lens fiber cells did not affect normal fiber cell differentiation .
however , overexpression of e2f5 and p130 provided 50 - 80 % inhibition of e2f1 or e2f3a induced cell cycle entry .
our transgenic studies provide in vivo evidence that e2f5 / p130 can function as a cell cycle repressor and can inhibit cell proliferation .
our studies do not address the issue of whether p130 alone can inhibit cell cycle reentry induced by e2f1 - 3 , or whether this inhibition requires formation of a p130 - e2f5 complex .
e2f5 alone does not repress cell cycle progression when the prb family members are phosphorylated and dissociated from the e2fs , the free e2f4 and e2f5 proteins move to the cytoplasm , while the activator e2f proteins ( e2f1 , e2f2 , and e2f3a ) bind to the e2f - responsive gene promoters that are vacated by e2f4 and e2f5 , even though at some promoters their binding sites may be different [ 35,36 ] .
we have shown that expression of e2f1 - 4 in ocular lens fiber cells can upregulate e2f target genes and induce post - mitotic lens fiber cells to re - enter the cell cycle [ 15,29 ] .
in this study , we used the same transgenic approaches to test whether extra e2f5 could interfere with the activator e2fs .
we found that overexpression of e2f5 in fiber cells was not sufficient to disrupt s phase induction by e2f1 or e2f3a .
generation of e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice since extra " free " e2f5 did not interfere with the activator e2fs , we hypothesized that the role of repressor e2fs might be dependent upon their binding partners , the pocket proteins .
since e2f5 is believed to bind preferentially to p130 [ 8 ] , we used the deltaenalphaa - minx promoter ( dream ) vector for e2f5 and p130 cdna constructs to generate e2f5 / p130 double transgenic mice .
this modified alphaa - crystallin promoter has been shown to be active in both lens epithelial and fiber cells [ 30 ] .
however , among transgenic mice ( ove1811 and ove1812 ) that were obtained from our micro - coinjection , we found that both e2f5 and p130 transgenes were mainly expressed in lens fiber cells , with little or no expression in lens epithelial cells ( figure 1 ) .
inactivation of dream promoter in lens epithelial cells might be due to different transgene integration site , or repressive interaction between e2f5 and p130 transgenes .
e2f5 / p130 does not affect normal lens fiber differentiation , but inhibits deregulated cell cycle progression expression of e2f4 and e2f5 is found mainly present in quiescent cells at g0 , and is thought to be important for differentiation , because mice that are nullizygous for these e2fs have specific terminal - differentiation defects [ 37,38 ] .
the prb homologs , p107 and p130 , can form repressor complexes in conjunction with e2f4 or e2f5 at most if not all the e2f - responsive gene promoters [ 9 ] .
vairo et al .
[ 18 ] showed that p130 can interact with e2f4 , and can actively repress e2f - regulated promoter activities .
in our transgenic study , we found that when e2f5 and p130 were overexpressed in post - mitotic lens fiber cells , there was no inhibition of fiber cell differentiation or elongation .
however , coexpression of e2f5 and p130 did significantly repress the cell cycle progression induced by overexpression of e2f1 or e2f3a .
these results indicate that the activity of cell cycle " repressor " e2f5 , if any , is dependent upon the tumor suppressor p130 .
overexpression of p130 was previously found to arrest cancer cells in the g1 phase of the cell cycle and inhibit tumor growth [ 2,16,17 ] .
our transgenic observations are consistent with these previous studies .
however , so far it is unclear whether p130 can inhibit cell cycle progression in the absence of e2f5 .
it was reported that in the absence of both e2f4 and e2f5 , hypophosphorylated pocket proteins were unable to induce cell cycle exit [ 21 ] , suggesting that these repressor e2fs may be a necessary mediator for the pocket protein function .
the precise growth suppressive mechanisms of p130 are not fully understood .
one possibility is that it forms a repressive complex with e2f4 and e2f5 , which then recruits hdac1 to the e2f - regulated gene promoter and repress its activities [ 39 ] .
alternatively , since e2f1 , e2f2 , and e2f3 are capable of binding to p130 in two - hybrid systems or when overexpressed [ 40,41 ] , the other possibility is that p130 binds directly to e2f1 and e2f3a to eliminate their transactivation ability .
nevertheless , how p130 interplays with e2fs to function as a tumor suppressor remains to be determined .
e2f5 / p130 may be a useful tool in anti - cancer gene therapy our in vivo transgenic results may have clinical significance .
mutations in the human gene encoding p130 are detected in diverse cancers including prostate , breast , and ovarian cancers [ 2 ] .
several studies have shown that p130 is downregulated in tumors at the transcriptional level rather than by posttranslational modifications [ 42 - 44 ] , suggesting that loss of p130 expression could be an important event in development of tumors .
for example , downregulation of p130 has been found in the genesis of neoplasms of the lung [ 43 ] , breast [ 45 ] , ovary [ 42 ] , and non - hodgkin 's lymphomas [ 46 ] .
development of mesothelioma [ 47 ] and aids - related lymphomas [ 46 ] is also related to inactivation of p130 function by viral oncoproteins .
a previous study showed that retrovirus - mediated delivery of wild type p130 to the lung tumor cells could suppress tumor growth in vitro and in vivo [ 17 ] , indicating a role of p130 in gene therapy .
our transgenic observations further confirm that p130 , when overexpressed , can reduce inappropriate cell cycle reentry .
therefore , it may be a useful tool in gene therapy to inhibit tumor growth .
overexpression of e2f1 or e2f3 has been shown to lead to both p53 - dependent and - independent apoptosis in tissue culture cells [ 11,48 ] .
e2f1 was found to increase transcription of p53 [ 49 ] and to induce p53 protein accumulation through activation of p19arf [ 11 ] .
in addition , the p73 promoter region contains several e2f - binding sites , and overexpression of e2fs can transactivate the p73 promoter [ 48 ] .
in our previous transgenic studies , we showed that expression of e2f1 and e2f3a in post - mitotic lens fiber cells is sufficient to induce cell cycle reentry , followed by p53 and p73 stabilization and cell death [ 15,29 ] .
in the current study , we did not do tunel assays to analyze changes in apoptosis .
however , the many condensed nuclei in the triple transgenic lens fiber cells ( figure 7 and figure 8 ) indicate that programmed cell death is still occurring .
this suggests that overexpression of p130 may not interfere with e2f induced apoptosis , which would enhance the anti - tumor activity of p130 .
in summary , we have used the transgenic mouse lens as a model system to study e2f and p130 activities .
although e2f5 is one of the " repressor " e2fs , expression of e2f5 alone was not sufficient to interfere with cell cycle induction by the activator e2fs .
overexpression of both e2f5 and p130 did not affect normal post - mitotic lens fiber cell differentiation .
however , they did inhibit e2f - induced cell cycle reentry .
although the molecular basis of this phenomenon is not yet fully understood , our studies support the notion that p130 is an important cell cycle repressor , and therefore , may be useful for gene therapy in the treatment of tumors .

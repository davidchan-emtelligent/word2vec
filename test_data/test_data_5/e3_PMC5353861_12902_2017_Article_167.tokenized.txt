background the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among diabetic men varies between 35 - 90 % .
although erectile dysfunction is widespread among men with diabetes , the condition often remains undiagnosed and demands appropriate assessment and prompt treatment .
erectile dysfunction can affect all aspects of a patient 's life including physical , emotional , social , sexual , and relationships .
the main aim of this study is to determine the prevalence and determinants of erectile dysfunction among diabetic patients attending hospitals in the central and northwest zone of tigray , ethiopia .
methods a hospital based cross - sectional study was conducted on 249 male diabetic patients attending five hospitals in the central and northwestern zone of tigray , ethiopia using systematic random sampling .
the data was collected from january 1 - february 30 , 2016 and was entered and analyzed using spss version 20 .
correlation and multivariate logistic regression was employed to test associations between independent and outcome variables .
results the mean age of study participants was 43.39 years and the mean duration of diabetes diagnosis was 6.22 years .
the overall prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 69.9 % , with 32.9 % suffering from mild , 31.7 % moderate , and 5.2 % severe erectile dysfunction .
multivariate logistic regression revealed that erective dysfunction was significantly predicted by old age ( adjusted odds ratio [ aor ] = 15.013 , ci : 3.212 - 70.166 ) , longer duration of diabetes ( aor = 3.77 , ci : 1.291 - 11.051 ) , and lower monthly income ( aor = 0.285 , ci : 0.132 - 0.615 ) .
no association was found with body mass index , co - morbidity , glycemic control , and alcohol consumption .
conclusion the prevalence of erective dysfunction in this study population was very high .
age , income , and duration of diabetes were the independent predictors of erectile dysfunction .
nearly all of the patients in the sample ( 97 %) had not been screened or treated for erectile dysfunction .
assessment and management of erectile dysfunction in the diabetic clinic should be part of routine medical care during follow - up visits with diabetic patients .
healthcare providers should put an emphasis on screening and treating older patients and those who had a diabetes diagnosis for a longer duration .

keywords prevalence erectile dysfunction determinants diabetes mellitus tigray ethiopia issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background erectile dysfunction ( ed ) , or impotence , can be defined as an inability to initiate and have a persistence erection firm enough to have satisfying sexual intercourse .
in relation to the increasing prevalence of chronic conditions , such as diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , chronic complications such as ed are also rising [ 1 ] .
the rate of occurrence of ed in men with dm is two to three times higher than in men without dm. moreover , men with diabetes may experience ed as much as 10 to 15 years earlier than men without diabetes [ 2 ] .
studies conducted on prevalence rates of ed among diabetic men produce various results which generally range from 35 - 90 % .
for instance , ed rates among diabetic men were over 50 % in the united states , 35 - 78 % in mexico , 41 % in the netherlands , 80 - 90 % in saudi arabia , and 77 % in the isfahan province of iran [ 3 , 4 ] .
moreover , studies have demonstrated high rates of ed in africa .
the prevalence of ed is 72.5 % in nigeria and 55.1 % in tanzania , with 12.8 % of participants suffering from mild dysfunction , 11.5 % from moderate , and 27.9 % from severe dysfunction [ 5 , 6 ] .
sexual function is an important indices of quality of life .
the presence of ed has been negatively associated with men 's social interactions , emotional and psychological well - being , and partner relationships ' .
it is important to note that ed is one of the most treatable complications of diabetes ; the literature demonstrated that over 95 % of cases can be successfully treated [ 7 ] .
further complicating the issue is the sensitivity of the disorder .
erectile dysfunction is an issue that requires privacy ; many men feel embarrassed to disclose and discuss the problem with their doctor , or even their life partner .
in ethiopia , open discussions about sexual matters occur infrequently , making the issue of privacy even more important .
there is currently a gap in the literature , as no studies of ed have previously been conducted in ethiopia .
thus , this study will provide evidence regarding the sexual health , specifically ed , of diabetic patients and will contribute to efforts to improve the quality of life of diabetic patients including the prevention of undesirable psychosocial consequences .
methods design a hospital based cross - sectional study was conducted on 249 male diabetic patients attending five hospitals in the central and northwestern zones of tigray located in northern ethiopia .
the study hospitals are st. mary 's hospital ( aksum ) , adwa hospital , suhul hospital ( shire ) , may ayni hospital ( shiraro ) , and abi adi hospital .
these hospitals were selected due to their accessibility and affiliation with aksum university .
the data was collected from january 1 - february 30 , 2016 for two consecutive months .
ethical clearance was obtained from the institutional review board ( irb ) of aksum university college of health sciences .
a letter of support was also issued from the tigray regional health office to each respective health institution .
in addition , information about the study was provided and informed consent was obtained from study participants to confirm their willingness for participation .
to enable participants to disclose and respond openly , five data collectors who are male clinical nurses working at each respective study hospital were recruited .
moreover , to maintain privacy , anonymous questionnaires were used and patients were interviewed alone and by the male clinical nurses .
recruitment and sample a systematic random sampling technique was used to identify participants .
adult male patients age >= 18 years with a diagnosis of dm were included in the study .
the diagnosis of dm was made by physicians ( internists ) working at each study hospital .
we utilized the world health organization criteria of a fasting blood sugar ( fbs ) >= 126 mg / dl to diagnose a patient with dm. fasting blood sugar was measured using a glucometer immediately before breakfast when the patient arrived at the diabetic / chronic disease follow - up clinic of each respective study hospital .
study participants with known secondary ed from genetic , endocrine , neurological , or surgical causes were excluded from the study .
measures to assess for erectile function a pre - test and structured interviewer administered questionnaire adopted from the abridged 5 - item version of the international index of erectile function ( iief - 5 ) was used [ 8 ] .
data were gathered from both the chart and self - report of patients .
the tool also included socio - demographic variables , clinical characteristics , and other variables .
it was translated to the local language ( tigregna ) and back translated to english by professional translating organizations ( additional file 1 ) .
clinical characteristics of the patients were also measured including body mass index ( bmi ) and blood pressure .
a manual sphygmomanometer ( blood pressure cuff ) was used to measure blood pressure and the world health organization criteria were used to classify bmi .
operational definitions the following operational definitions were used for the outcome variable of ed based on the scores using the international index of erectile function ( iief - 5 ) .
severe ed : study participants who scored 1 - 7 out of 25 points .
moderate ed : study participants who scored 8 - 11 out of 25 points .
mild to moderate ed : study participants who scored 12 - 16 out of 25 points .
mild ed : study participants who scored 17 - 21 out of 25 points [ 8 ] .
data analysis the sample size was calculated using a single proportion formula considering 95 % confidence interval and 5 % margin of error .
since there were no previous studies conducted in ethiopia , we utilized the prevalence studied in nigeria as p = 41.5 % [ 9 ] .
the sample size was reduced by using the population correction formula and by adding 10 % for non - response rate to result in the final sample size of 249 .
finally , proportional sample size was taken from each five hospitals as per the total population .
the study subjects were selected using systematic random sampling ( k = 2 ) at diabetic and chronic disease follow - up clinics .
the collected data were entered and analyzed using spss version 20 ; p values were set at p < . 05 .
texts , charts , and tables were used to describe the result .
pearson correlation and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the association of independent and outcome variables .
results socio - demographic characteristics of participants two hundred forty nine ( 249 ) patients were interviewed to achieve the study aim with a 100 % response rate .
the mean age of study participants was 43.39 +/ - 14.7 years ( range : 19 - 83 years ) .
the mean duration of a dm diagnosis was 6.22 years ( range : 1 month - 30 years ) .
almost all ( 98.4 %) of the participants were of tigre ethnicity and the majority ( 86.7 %) were also married .
participants were also predominantly of the orthodox religion ( 88 %) and had low educational status .
most participants were farmers ( 49.8 %) , followed by government employees ( 19.3 %) .
as depicted in table 1 , a substantial proportion ( 43.4 %) of respondents had a monthly income of lower than $ 25 .

clinical characteristics of the participants indicated that the mean fbs level of study participants was 187.5 mg / dl , with 35.3 % of participants in the normal range (< 126 mg / dl ) and 64.7 % of participants above the normal range (>= 126 mg / dl ) implying that the majority of participant 's had poor control of their glycemic status at the time the study was conducted .
additionally , the mean bmi of respondents was 20.77 kg / m2 ( range : 13.8 - 14.9 kg / m2 ) .
results indicated that 71.5 % of study participants were in normal range for bmi ( bmi = 18.5 - 24.9 kg / m2 ) , 19.3 % were underweight ( bmi < 18.4kg / m2 ) , and 9.2 % were overweight ( bmi = 25 - 29.9kg / m2 ) .
no obese patients ( bmi > 30 kg / m2 ) were found in this study .
the majority of participants ( 90.4 %) were within the normal range for blood pressure ( bp < 120 /. 90 ) while the rest of participants had either stage 1 ( 8.4 %) or stage 2 ( 1.2 %) hypertension .
forty participants ( 16.7 %) had additional chronic disease beside dm. the most common chronic disease co - existing with dm was hypertension which accounted for 9.2 % of cases .
the breakdown for type of dm was 63.1 % were type 1 and the remaining 36.9 % were type 2 dm ( table 2 ) .

the prevalence of ed in this study was found to be 69.9 % of which 5.2 % had severe ed , 31.7 % had moderate ed , and 32.9 % had mild ed. only 30.1 % of patients had normal erectile function ( fig. 1 ) .
more specifically , the prevalence of ed in type 1 and type 2 dm patients was 60.2 and 76.2 % respectively. fig. 1 distribution of severity of erectile dysfunction among diabetics attending at central and northwest tigray , 2016 when evaluating treatment seeking behavior , only 8 ( 3.2 %) of patients sought medical care because of ed. relatedly , among those patients who had been treated for ed , only one respondent was treated by both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy .
multivariate logistic regression analyses show that there was an association between ed and age , income , and duration of diabetes .
respondents whose age was above 60 years old were 15 times more likely to develop ed as compared to those less than 30 years of age ( aor = 15.013 , ci : 3.212 - 70.166 , p = . 001 ) .
moreover , study participants who had a diagnosis of dm for more than 10 years were 3.77 times more likely to develop ed as compared to those who had a diagnosis of diabetes for less than 10 years ( aor = 3.77 , ci : 1.291 - 11.051 , p = 0.015 ) .
on the other hand , study participants whose monthly income was above $ 50 were 0.249 less likely to have ed as compared to those with an income below $ 25 ( aor = 0.285 , ci : 0.132 - 0.615 p = . 001 ) .
otherwise , no associations were found between ed and bmi , co - morbidity , glycemic control , and alcohol consumption ( table 3 ) .

on the other hand , type 1 dm is more common than type 2 dm in the central and northern zones of ethiopia .
this might be attributed to the fact that the greatest risk factor for type 2 dm is obesity , which is largely absent in the central and northern zones of ethiopia .
the study region is similar to other regions of the country and thus results should be considered as they may pertain to the country as a whole .
the study confirms that the prevalence of ed among dm patients is high ( 69.9 %) of which 5.2 % had severe ed that required immediate intervention .
the high prevalence of ed among dm patients is in line with several studies .
the prevalence of erectile dysfunction among diabetic men which has been reported across the world varies between 35 - 90 % .
the result of this study are within this range .
moreover , the study finding coincide with the results from nigeria in which the prevalence of ed is higher in diabetics than in other chronic diseases which reaches up to 72.7 % .
in another study in iran , sexual dysfunction was detected in 77 % of diabetic men , and in saudi arabia the prevalence ranges from 80 - 90 % .
however , there is some discrepancy with the study conducted at tanzania , and iran which is 55 and 59.5 % respectively .
the reason may be attributed to differences in the socio - cultural context of study participants and the methodology .
in this study , the chart review and in - person interviews may have uncovered additional cases of ed that would not have been found with only one data collection method .
beside this , in the united states the prevalence of ed among the general population is 18.4 % versus 51.3 % in diabetic population .
but the data collection tool used in this study was a one item question which is very different from this study [ 10 ] .
a review of current perspectives on diabetes and sexual dysfunction show the prevalence of ed is reported >= 50 % in male with diabetes worldwide which is congruent with the results of this study .
past literature has also demonstrated that advanced age , longer duration of diabetes , co - morbidity with hypertension , hyperlipidemia , glycemic control , smoking , sedentary lifestyles , being overweight , and obesity are the common independent predictors for ed. however , this study demonstrates that only advanced age , longer duration of diabetes , and lower income were significantly associated with ed in ethiopia .
this might be due to discrepancy of methodology , data collection tools , the sample size , and socio - economic differences of study participants [ 11 ] .
on the other hand , a study conducted in italy and israeli men on erectile dysfunction in type 1 and type 2 dm demonstrates similar finding on the independent predictor variables [ 12 , 13 ] .
the study further confirms that duration of diabetes , age , and monthly income are the independent predictors for ed and its severity .
in contrast , this study reveals bmi , glycemic control , co - morbidity , taking concomitant drug are not associated with ed. most studies have similar results demonstrating age and duration of diabetes are significantly associated with ed. older age groups , lower income , and patients with long duration with dm are more likely to develop ed. even the aor ( aor = 15 ) result among age groups above 60 years of age is similar with tanzania .
several reasons including age related physiological changes in the testicles and decline in male sex hormones have been attributed to the increasing incidence of ed in older men [ 5 ] .
on the other hand , obesity , glycemic control , co - morbidity , and taking additional drugs and drinking alcohol were not associated with ed. but in some studies these variables have been associated [ 4 , 14 ] .
among the 166 patients in this study who had ed only eight sought medical help in order to be treated for the disease .
almost all patients ( 97 %) had not been screened or treated for ed. this disparity might be attributable to patients' feeling embarrassed , not considering ed a treatable disease , and fear of side effects .
conclusion it is important to consider dm as a threat for rural communities .
the prevalence of ed in the study population was very high .
the prevalence of ed among type 2 dm patients was relatively higher than type 1 dm. almost all patients ( 97 %) had not been screened or treated for ed. increasing age , relatively lower income , and longer duration of dm were significant predictors of ed. assessment and management of ed should be part of routine medical care in diabetic follow - up clinics .
healthcare providers should openly ask men with chronic disease , particularly those with diabetes , about symptoms of ed. the medications used for treatment should be readily available in the hospital settings in ethiopia .
mental health professions should also be involved in providing psychotherapy ( sexual counseling ) for patients with ed. patients who are of older age and who have a longer duration of dm require special attention in screening for ed. additional file additional file 1 : questionnaire used to collect erectile dysfunction of diabetic patients .

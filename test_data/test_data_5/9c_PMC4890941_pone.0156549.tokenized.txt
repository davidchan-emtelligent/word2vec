myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdscs ) have been known to be a key factor in the regulation of the immune system under numerous conditions such as tumors , infections , autoimmune diseases , and transplantations .
in contrast to the proposed deleterious role of mdscs in tumors and infections , mdscs with their suppressive function are now proved to have the beneficial potential of suppressing the autoimmune response and promoting tolerance to transplantation .
therefore , the expansion of mdscs could be a promising therapeutic strategy for many diseases .
in this study , we aimed to identify fda - approved drugs that could aid in the expansion of functional mdscs .
we performed a high - throughput screening ( hts ) of fda - approved drugs based on the in vitro human mdsc - differentiation system and identified finasteride ( fin ) to have the best potency to aid the generation of human mdscs .
the fin - induced mdscs were quite similar to monocytic mdscs with regard to their surface phenotype , morphology , immunosuppressive function , and related gene expression .
next , we aimed to determine the mechanism of action of fin and found that fin induced the expansion of mdscs through up - regulation of the cox2 / pge2 pathway by enhancing the activity of cox2 promoter .
in addition , the administration of indomethacin ( ind ) , a cox2 inhibitor , abrogated the effect of fin .
based on these results , we suggested that fin could find applications in the future in the expansion of mdscs .
further development of fin - like compounds could be a novel strategy for generating functional mdscs for immunosuppressive therapies in various immune disorder conditions .

introduction myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdscs ) are identified as a heterogeneous population of multipotent progenitor cells that include granulocytes , monocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells ( dcs ) precursors .
mdscs are associated with tumor vasculogenesis and mediate tumor antigen - specific t cell tolerance by expressing immunosuppressive factors such as indoleamine dioxygenase ( ido ) , interleukin ( il ) - 10 , arginase , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) , nitric oxide ( no ) , and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) [ 1 ] .
over the last few years , increasing numbers of investigations have demonstrated the accumulation of mdscs under pathological conditions such as autoimmune diseases [ 2 - 4 ] and transplant rejection [ 5 , 6 ] .
furthermore , exogenously delivered functional mdscs have been observed to limit autoimmune - related pathogenesis in mouse models of ibd [ 7 ] , alopecia - areata [ 8 ] , and type 1 diabetes [ 9 ] .
the adoptive transfer of induced - mdscs also showed the capacity of prolonging the survival of allogeneic allograft in many cases of solid organ transplantation [ 10 - 13 ] .
given the vital regulatory capacity of mdscs in the immune system [ 14 , 15 ] , these cells are expected to be a potential candidate for the treatment of immune disorders .
therefore , the efficient in vitro generation and the subsequent adoptive transfer of mdscs in some hyper - responsive conditions is of great significance [ 16 ] .
it is well accepted that the generation of mdscs is dependent on two major signaling pathways .
one is predominantly responsible for the expansion of mdscs , which can be induced by various factors such as granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ( gm - csf ) , macrophage colony stimulating factor ( m - csf ) , granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) , interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , or vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) through the stat3 and / or the stat5 signaling pathway [ 17 - 19 ] .
the other one is principally for the activation of mdscs , and can be induced by various pro - inflammatory molecules such as ifn - gamma , il - 1beta , il - 4 / il - 13 , or toll - like receptor ( tlr ) ligands through the stat1 , stat6 and the nf - kappab signaling pathway or via the up - regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 ( cox2 ) [ 20 - 22 ] .
both of these two signals are essential for the accumulation of functional mdscs .
cox2 , as one of the cyclooxygenase isoenzymes , mediates the process of catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane .
except for its constitutive expression in brain and kidney , cox2 is primarily an inducible enzyme that can be activated in a variety of cells in response to cytokines , mitogens , and endotoxins [ 23 ] .
the major role of cox2 involves the conversion of arachidonic acid ( aa ) into prostaglandin - e2 ( pge2 ) ; therefore , the level of pge2 is often considered as an indicator of local cyclooxygenase activity [ 24 , 25 ] .
pge2 is a pro - inflammatory mediator produced by cancer , stromal , and infiltrating myeloid cells and acts on g - protein - coupled receptors .
cox2 is believed to be the key factor regulating the production of pge2 during immune responses .
however , there is a positive feedback loop between pge2 and cox2 , and the accumulation of pge2 may induce high cox2 expression under certain conditions [ 26 ] .
it has previously been reported that the cox2 / pge2 positive feedback loop plays an important role in the generation and activation of mdscs [ 27 ] .
artificial manipulation of this feedback would make it possible to enhance or suppress immune responses under different clinical conditions such as in cancer , autoimmune disease , or transplant rejection [ 28 , 29 ] .
in order to use mdscs for immunotherapy in immune diseases , investigators have tried various methods of expanding mdscs in vitro to replenish the deficiencies in endogenous functional mdsc production .
multiple biologically active factors including prostaglandins , growth factors , chemokines , and cytokines have been shown to promote mdsc expansion [ 11 , 20 ] .
in this study , we established a high - throughput screening system for fda - approved drugs to identify those that could aid in the generation and activation of mdscs .
the most potent drug was selected ; we further went on to elucidate the mechanism by which the drug induced the expansion of mdscs .
our study will serve as a platform for the development of therapies for autoimmune diseases and in cases of transplant rejection , and simultaneously provide a supporting for the feasibility of drug repositioning .

results identification of finasteride as a candidate for mdsc generation by high - throughput screening with the aim of identifying factors that could efficiently induce mdsc expansion at a low cost , we performed a high - throughput screening of 1280 fda - approved drugs to evaluate their active compounds .
to mimic the in vivo microenvironment , a human mdsc culture system was established using fresh human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) in the presence of il - 6 and gm - csf .
all the 1280 compounds , each at a concentration of 50 mum , were then screened using this system in 96 - well plates ( fig 1a ) .
after 6 days of culture , the compounds that could increase the frequencies of mdscs by 2 - fold or more , in comparison to the number of dmso - treated control cells , were selected .
these compounds were then re - tested by following the same procedure , except that the concentration of the compounds in this retest was reduced to 25 mum .
seven compounds were found to be able to enhance mdsc generation sustainably even at the lower concentration .
one of these compounds , finasteride ( fin ) , has widely been used in the clinic to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) and has relatively less side effects ; it was therefore chosen for further analysis ( fig 1b ) .
the structure of fin is shown in fig 1c .

( b ) flowchart of hts procedure .
1280 compounds from the fda - approved drug library were screened in a dose at 50 mum for the activity on mdscs expansion .
115 compounds that had activity (> 2 - fold induction ) were subsequently screened for the second round in a dose at 25 mum , leading to 7 compounds that were selected .
fin is one of the best candidates and identified for further investigation .
( c ) chemical structure of fin .
fin enhances the generation of functional human mdscs in vitro to further confirm the effect of fin , dose - response analysis was performed and the results showed that fin administration increased the proportion of mdscs ( hla - dr - / low cd11b + cd33 + cells ) in a concentration - dependent manner ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
to exclude the possibility of fin cytotoxicity , cell viability was measured ; the cytotoxicity data ( cc50 ) of fin was found to be more than 100 mum in human pbmcs ( fig 2c ) .
it is important to note here that , owing to their heterogeneity , human mdscs are further classified into monocytic ( m ) and granulocytic ( g ) subsets based on the expression of specific surface markers - - cd14 and cd15 .
we found that the fin - induced mdscs corresponded to monocytic mdscs , which were cd14 - positive but lacked cd15 expression ( fig 2d ) .
giemsa staining results indicated that the fin - induced mdscs had large unilobar nuclei and abundant cytoplasm ( fig 2e ) .
as the immunosuppression towards autologous t cells is considered the major function of mdscs , we next evaluated the effect of the fin - induced mdscs on t - cell responses .
the mdscs were co - cultured with autologous t - lymphocytes labeled with cfse at different ratios .
the results showed that the fin - induced mdscs could suppress the proliferation of both cd4 + and cd8 + t - cells in a dose - dependent manner ( fig 3 ) .

the cox2 / pge2 pathway mediates the effect of fin on mdsc expansion we next investigated the mechanism underlying the fin - induced generation of mdscs .
the efficacy of fin in clinical practice is dependent on the inhibition of type ii 5alpha - reductase .
however , information from the human protein atlas online database ( http :// www.proteinatlas.org ) suggested that type ii 5alpha - reductase is only moderately expressed in the prostate , fallopian tubes , and liver , but that it is not expressed in pbmcs from healthy blood donors .
therefore , we speculated that there was no close relationship between the activity of type ii 5alpha - reductase and the generation of the mdscs , which were derived from human pbmcs cultured in vitro .
given that the generation of mdscs in our study took place in the presence of sufficient il - 6 and gm - csf , which would have afforded the first expanding signal for mdsc accumulation , we hypothesized that fin might affect the second activating signal .
to verify our hypothesis , we analyzed the mrna expression of mdsc activation - related genes , which are mainly those encoding the inflammatory factors and members of signaling pathways .
excluding some genes such as il - 4 and il - 13 whose expression levels were too low to be detected using rt - pcr ( data not shown ) , we found that the mrna level of il - 1beta , among the reported activating cytokines , was significantly up - regulated upon fin administration ( fig 4a ) .
however , among these activating signaling molecules / transcriptional factors including nf - kappab , stat1 , stat6 , and cox2 , cox2 solely showed a significant increase in its mrna level upon fin treatment ( fig 4b ) .
when it came to the protein level , the phosphorylation of stat1 and stat6 were hardly detected and showed no significant alteration with or without fin .
the translocation of rela / p65 , subunit of nf - kappab also showed no difference ( fig 4c - 4e ) .
in contrast , cox2 was consistently up - regulated at its protein level ( fig 4f ) .
in previous studies , the cox2 / pge2 pathway had been found to play an important role in the differentiation of human mdscs .
we therefore confirmed the increased production of pge2 through an elisa assay ( fig 4g ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0156549.g004 fig 4 fin up - regulates the cox2 / pge2 pathway .
pbmcs from healthy donors were treated with fin ( 100 mum ) for 3 - 5 days .
dmso was used as negative control .
cells harvested on day 3 were for qrt - pcr , harvested at indicated time points were for western blot .
( a ) ifngamma and il - 1beta mrna expressions were determined by qrt - pcr .
results are shown in mean +/ - sem of 3 independent experiments .
( b ) mrna expressions of factors downstream of the second activating signal were determined by qrt - pcr .
results are shown in mean +/ - sem of 3 independent experiments .

( e ) stat6 and phosphorylated - stat6 protein level was assayed by western blot analysis .
( f ) cox2 protein level was assayed by western blot analysis with cells harvested on day 4 and day 5 .
( g ) culture supernatant was collected on day 3 and day 4 , and the pge2 content was detected with elisa .
results are shown in mean +/ - sem and representative of 3 independent experiments .
( h ) mrna expressions of factors related with suppressive function of m - mdscs were determined by qrt - pcr .
results are shown in mean +/ - sem of 3 independent experiments .
( c - f ) results are representative of three healthy individuals .
* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , compared with control by student 's t - test .
it is well known that the two subsets of mdscs implement their immunosuppressive function through different pathways .
g - mdscs primarily function via ros , while the m - mdscs act via inos , arginase i ( arg i ) and many other immunosuppressive cytokines [ 20 , 32 - 35 ] .
therefore , we analyzed the mrna expression of some key factors such as tgfbeta , il - 10 , arg i , and nos2 .
the expression of nos2 was too low to be detected using rt - pcr , but all the others showed increased expression upon fin treatment .
the expression of arg i was especially increased ( fig 4h ) , which was consistent with previous reports [ 36 ] , indicating that cox2 / pge2 were the major inducers of arg i expression in the mdscs .
fin activates the cox2 / pge2 pathway by increasing the activity of the cox2 promoter due to the fact that our data showed increased mrna expression of il - 1beta ( fig 4a ) , which was previously reported to play a role in inducing the expression of cox2 through the mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway [ 37 ] .
it is possible that il - 1beta could contribute to the up - regulation of cox2 mediated by fin in our system .
to this end , we knocked down il - 1r on the basis of fin treatment through sirna transfection , but found that the mrna expression of cox2 was not significantly altered ( s1 fig ) .
thus there must be other mechanism ( s ) conducted by fin for the induction of mdscs .
while the mrna and protein levels of cox2 were both increased by fin treatment , we hypothesized that the increased expression of cox2 could be due to an increase in its mrna transcription .
we therefore constructed a reporter plasmid with a 986 - bp fragment from position - 900 bp to + 86 bp of the transcription start site in the cox2 promoter region , which was followed by a firefly luciferase gene .
after transfection of this reporter plasmid into hek293t cells , the expression of the firefly luciferase gene was found to be significantly increased upon fin treatment ( fig 5 ) .
this result indicated that fin could enhance the activity of the cox2 promoter and thus increase the expression of cox2 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0156549.g005 fig 5 fin mediates the cox2 / pge2 pathway by increasing the activity of cox2 promoter .
the plasmid harboring a cox2 promoter fragment and a firefly luciferase ( fl ) gene ( 5ng / well separately ) was transfected into hek293t cells in a 24 - well - plate and a cmv - renilla luciferase ( rl ) plasmid ( 10ng / well ) served as a transfection control .
fin ( 50mum ) was treated for 6 h before harvesting the cells for dual - luciferase assay .
transfected cells treated with dmso were set as negative control .
results are shown in mean +/ - sem and representative of 3 independent experiments .

indomethacin ( ind ) abrogates the effect of fin on mdscs generation to further verify the involvement of cox2 / pge2 pathway in the fin - induced generation of mdscs , indomethacin , a specific inhibitor of cox1 / 2 [ 38 , 39 ] , was added into the culture system .
the results showed that the effect of fin on mdsc generation was almost abrogated by the addition of indomethacin ( fig 6a ) .
furthermore , the effect of indomethacin on restraining mdsc generation was dose - dependent ( fig 6b and 6c ) .
in addition , blocking of cox2 / pge2 signaling by indomethacin decreased the fin - induced expression of cox2 , as well as decreased the production of pge2 ( fig 6d and 6e ) .
furthermore , the indicated role of pge2 in fin - mediated mdsc generation was also confirmed by the pge2 neutralizing antibody treatment , which also counteracted the effect of fin ( s2 fig ) .
these observations supported our hypothesis that the cox2 / pge2 signaling pathway mediates the effects of fin on the mdscs .

discussion mdscs play defined roles in maintaining immune tolerance under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions [ 14 , 40 , 41 ] .
in recent years , emerging reports have shown that functional mdscs could be generated using many factors in vitro .
however , factors available for both in vitro and in vivo usage of mdsc generation with less side effects are still needed .
in light of this , in this study , we screened an accessible and reliable fda - approved drug library , and identified fin to be effective in generating mdscs in a human mdsc - differentiation system in vitro .
since these existing drugs have already been used in humans , they have well - established dose regimen with favorable pharmacokinetics ( pk ) and pharmacodynamics ( pd ) properties as well as tolerable side effects [ 42 ] , making them useful sources of application for some unintended disease conditions .
fin , as one of such existing drugs , is a potent inhibitor of 5alpha - reductase , which is an enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotesterone ( dht ) , and is involved in bile acid biosynthesis , androgen and estrogen metabolism , as well as in prostate cancer [ 43 ]. by inhibiting 5alpha - reductase , fin prevents the conversion of testosterone to dht through type ii and iii isoenzymes , resulting in a down - regulation of dht in the serum [ 44 ] .
as there is no 5alpha - reductase expression in pbmcs ( http :// www.proteinatlas.org / ensg00000277893 - srd5a2 / cell ) , with which we used to initiate the mdsc - inducing system , it is unlikely that fin would induce the generation of mdscs through the regulation of 5alpha - reductase .
our data indicated that both the surface phenotype and morphology of the fin - induced mdscs were similar to those of monocytic mdscs .
indomethacin potently inhibited the fin - induced generation of the mdscs , strongly supporting our hypothesis that the cox2 / pge2 pathway played an important role in fin - induced mdsc generation ( fig 7 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0156549.g007 fig 7 model for the role of fin in mdscs generation .
fin has a role in up - regulating the expression of cox2 through increasing the activity of cox2 promoter , which leads to increased production of pge2 , and eventually induce mdscs generation .
during this process , the cox2 inhibitor ind could abrogate the effect of fin .
conversely , although the treatment of bph with fin is a developed protocol in clinical practice , the fda recently concluded that fin administration may accompany an increasing risk of high - grade prostate cancer ( http :// www.fda.gov / drugs / drugsafety / ucm258314 ) and breast cancer [ 45 ] .
however , the exact reason why the treatment of fin resulted in such increased risk among 5alpha - reductase inhibitor - treated patients remained ambiguous .
the mdsc - inducing capacity of fin revealed in our study may provide a reasonable explanation for such increased risks .
upon administration , these fin - induced mdscs could induce tumor antigen - specific t - cell tolerance , thus allowing the deteriorating tumor to evade immunosurveillance .
coincidently , a recent clinical trial showed an absolute advantage in alleviating bph when adopting a combination therapy with a cox2 inhibitor and fin [ 46 ] , which further supports our hypothesis .
however , direct clinical evidence is certainly required to further verify our hypothesis in the future .
our study suggested that mdsc induction could play an important role in the adverse effects observed in fin - treated bph patients .
our findings also likely provide a new perspective on the clinical use of fin , and reveal a mechanism that may be responsible for the " evasion " of cancers that develop upon fin administration .
our study also provides a novel insight into the advantages of rational administration and combination therapy in diseases .
besides their recognized role in cancers , mdscs are also being gradually accepted as regulators of the immune system .
immature myeloid cells ( imcs ) in naive mice are an intrinsic part of normal hematopoiesis and are not immunosuppressive when they are in an inactivated state .
upon encountering some acute stress , the imc population will quickly undergo a transition into the activated state [ 14 ] .
however , this transient imc population with the suppressive functions of mdscs is always short lived and thus has minimal impact on immune response .
there has also reports indicating that the dysfunction of mdsc in vivo may be a factor driving autoimmune inflammatory pathogenesis [ 2 ] .
therefore , the administration of fin might help to activate the dysfunctional mdscs , initiating such immunosuppressive functions and making the regulatory network controllable ; it could therefore be a novel method that can be used for therapeutic purposes in a variety of clinical settings .
in summary , in our study , we identified fin as a compound that capable of inducing mdsc generation .
we also elucidated that fin performs this role through the cox2 / pge2 pathway by increasing cox2 expression through enhancing its promoter activity .
our findings provide a possible explanation for the increased risk of high - grade prostate cancer and breast cancer among fin - treated patients .
further , as mdscs play a role in the regulation of the immune system , fin may have potential applications in the treatment for autoimmune diseases and in cases such as transplant rejection .
further studies to validate the use of fin in such scenarios are required .

background central to the development of a sound evidence base for complementary and alternative medicine ( cam ) interventions is the need for valid , reliable and relevant outcome measures to assess whether the interventions work .
we assessed the specific needs for a database that would cover a wide range of outcomes measures for cam research and considered a framework for such a database .
methods the study was a survey of cam researchers , practitioners and students .
an online questionnaire was emailed to the members of the canadian interdisciplinary network for cam research ( in - cam ) and the cam education and research network of alberta ( camera ) .
the majority of survey questions were open - ended and asked about outcome measures currently used , outcome measures' assessment criteria , sources of information , perceived barriers to finding outcome measures and outcome domains of importance .
descriptive quantitative analysis and qualitative content analysis were used .
results one hundred and sixty - four completed surveys were received. of these , 62 respondents reported using outcome measures in their cam research and identified 92 different specific outcomes .
the most important barriers were the fact that , for many health concepts , outcome measures do not yet exist , as well as issues related to accessibility of instruments .
important outcome domains identified included physical , psychological , social , spiritual , quality of life and holistic measures .
participants also mentioned the importance of individualized measures that assess unique patient - centered outcomes for each research participant , and measures to assess the context of healing and the process of healing .
conclusion we have developed a preliminary framework that includes all components of health - related outcomes .
the framework provides a foundation for a larger , comprehensive collection of cam outcomes .
it fits very well in a whole systems perspective , which requires an expanded set of outcome measures , such as individualized and holistic measures , with attention to issues of process and context .
background over the past 15 - 20 years , complementary and alternative medicine ( cam ) use has increased dramatically .
not surprisingly , questions of whether cam interventions are safe , efficacious and effective have become key research issues .
a review of articles indexed in medline between 1966 and 1996 suggests that both the number and proportion of reports of cam clinical trials is increasing at a significant rate [ 1 ] .
more recently , there is increasing attention to integrative medicine ( im ) , which combines mainstream medical therapies and cam therapies for which there is some high - quality scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness [ 2 ] .
central to the development of a sound evidence base for cam interventions is the need for valid , reliable and relevant outcome measures to assess whether the interventions work , in what conditions and for what population groups .
the number of available patient - centered outcome measures from a variety of health and social science disciplines is enormous .
several books have been published on health outcome measures ( e.g. , [ 3 - 9 ]) and , more recently , several websites have been developed to provide brief overviews of outcome measures ( e.g. , measurement excellence and training resource information center ( metric ) ; patient - reported outcome and quality of life instruments database ( proqolid )) .
despite these developments , there is growing recognition by cam practitioners and researchers that the current array of outcome measures is not sufficient for use in cam research and practice , as they do not cover the full spectrum of observed treatment effects .
many cam interventions ( e.g. , traditional chinese medicine , chiropractic , naturopathy , massage therapy ) may be conceptualized as whole systems of care [ 10 - 14 ] which consist of multiple components that provide an internally consistent , individualized approach to treatment .
components of care include , for example , the intervention itself as well as the process and context of healing , which are intertwined in a whole system based on a unique and consistent philosophical foundation .
an acknowledgement of the whole systems' nature of cam interventions ( and of im ) requires an expanded set of outcome measures , of which survival , conventional assessments of biomedical outcomes and quality of life are only part .
cam interventions and im are often aimed at affecting more than one aspect of a patient 's life , and instead focus on maximizing the individual patient 's capacity to achieve mental and physical balance and to , globally , restore his / her own health [ 11,13 ] .
thus , both individualized and global outcome measures appear necessary .
it is becoming increasingly clear that commonly used outcome measures fall short in addressing these aspects .
this perspective has led to a search for a broader range of outcome measures which may be less well - known , and for which psychometric quality is not always clear .
to help raise awareness of the range of relevant and available outcome measures , we set out to develop an online database of outcome measures relevant to cam / im interventions which would be widely available .
here we present the results of a survey aimed at identifying the specific needs for a database that would cover a wide range of outcomes measures for cam research .
the objectives of the study were to identify : 1 ) where cam researchers look for outcome measures ; 2 ) which specific outcome measures are in use for cam research ; 3 ) assessment criteria used when selecting outcome measures ; 4 ) perceived barriers to finding outcome measures for cam research ; and 5 ) outcome domains that are important for cam research .
methods the study design was a survey of cam researchers , practitioners and students .
the need for such a survey and the identification of relevant questions was pre - tested in a workshop on cam outcome measures offered at the second annual symposium of the canadian interdisciplinary network for complementary and alternative medicine research ( in - cam ) in november 2005 .
thirty participants attended the workshop and as part of the workshop completed a brief paper and pencil questionnaire .
the responses were used to refine the final questionnaire ; for example , small changes were made to make the questionnaire more " practitioner - friendly " ( some practitioner participants felt the questionnaire was not applicable to them as they did not conduct academically oriented research ) and to facilitate online completion of the questionnaire .
the final questionnaire took approximately 5 - 10 minutes to complete .
in february 2006 , a link to an online questionnaire was emailed to 1,100 in - cam members and 165 members of the cam education and research network of alberta ( camera ) .
membership in these networks is not a formal paid membership but consists of signing up in a membership database in return for which ' members' receive the networks' newsletters and newsflashes ( emails ) .
in - cam and camera members include cam researchers , practitioners , educators , policy makers and students .
one separate email describing the objectives and process of this survey was sent to all members of each network within the span of one week .
there is some overlap in membership between the networks , so it is possible that some individuals received the notification more than once .
the majority of survey questions were open - ended ( table 1 ) .
other questions addressed participants' role ( e.g. , practitioner , researcher ) , involvement in cam research , use of outcome measures and sources of information on outcome measures used .
validity , reliability , responsiveness , relevance , cost and patient and administrator burden are criteria commonly applied when selecting outcome measures for use in clinical research [ 15 ] .
we asked respondents to identify assessment criteria they apply in addition to this list .
table 1 sample questions asked on electronic questionnaire question 1 .
many outcome domains have been identified as important for cam research that fall into the broad categories of biological , physical ( e.g. , function , pain ) , mental ( e.g. , depression , anxiety ) , social ( e.g. , role function , social support ) , emotional ( e.g. , hope ) and spiritual outcomes domains. are there any other outcomes of cam interventions you feel are important and should be included in cam research ( please describe ) ?
2. what cam outcome measures would you like to use but have not been able to find ( please describe ) ?
3. common assessment criteria that are used when selecting outcome assessment tools include validity , reliability , responsiveness , relevance , burden and cost. are there any other assessment criteria that you use to assess measurement tools ( please describe ) ?
4. what do you perceive to be barriers to finding outcome measures for cam research ( please describe ) ?
analysis of responses to the open - ended questions was conducted using qualitative content analysis : responses to each open - ended question were first read as a complete list and then common responses were sorted into a set of data - derived categories .
the goal of the analysis was , for each question , to summarize the range of responses and to suggest the importance of some categories over others based on frequency of mention .
data from a question soliciting respondents' perceptions of important cam outcome domains ( table 1 , question 1 ) was used to develop a preliminary framework of outcome domains important for cam research .
the framework emerging from the data was very basic and relationships between the domains were not specified .
subsequently , this framework was refined through a consensus building meeting attended by all authors and through consultation with experts in the field of cam and outcome assessment .
results a total of 164 responses were received .
the largest number of respondents identified themselves as practitioners ( 32.3 %) followed by researchers ( 28 %) and educators ( 12.8 %) .
approximately half ( 48.2 %) indicated that they are actively involved in cam research , of which 78 % use outcome measures in their research ( table 2 ) .
table 2 characteristics of survey respondents n % primary role * : practitioner 53 32.3 researcher or research staff 46 28.0 educator 21 12.8 student 16 9.8 administrator 8 4.9 other 16 9.8 actively involved in cam research * : yes 79 48.2 no 81 49.4 currently use outcome measures in research : yes 62 78.5 no 17 21.5 * 4 respondents did not answer this question resources for outcome measures respondents indicated that they most commonly refer to colleagues as a resource for outcome measures ( 34.4 %) , followed by libraries ( 27.4 %) , and the internet ( 22.3 %) .
pubmed was identified most frequently as an internet site to help identify outcome measures .
google , the cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature and the national center for complementary and alternative medicine ( united states ) website were also mentioned , but less frequently .
use of outcome measures the 62 respondents who reported using outcome measures in their cam research identified 92 different specific outcomes , of which 63 were identified by name .
the remaining identified outcome measures were biological measures such as heart rate , blood pressure and range of motion , or general concepts , such as satisfaction , control and attitudes but with no specific tool name mentioned .
the most commonly identified tools were : short form 36 health status survey ( sf - 36 : n = 9 ) , profile of mood states ( poms : n = 7 ) , arizona integrative outcomes scale ( aios : n = 5 ) , pain visual analogue scales ( pain vas : n = 4 ) and measure your medical outcome profile ( mymop : n = 4 ) .
some of these outcome measures are also frequently used in conventional medical research ( e.g. , sf - 36 , pain vas ) ; however , others were specifically developed for and validated in cam patient populations ( e.g. , aios , mymop ) .
assessment criteria for outcome measures many assessment criteria were identified in addition to the provided list , including : accessibility ( e.g. , ease of locating , copyright issues ) , ease of use and scoring , extent of use , readability , overall look and word choice .
barriers to finding outcome measures respondents identified many barriers that they face when trying to find outcome measures for their cam research .
the most commonly identified barrier was that appropriate and relevant outcome measures do not exist ( n = 16 ) .
respondents stressed that outcomes in cam research deviate somewhat from those in conventional medical research and that measurement tools have not yet been developed to address the unique process , context and outcomes of cam interventions .
closely related to this barrier was the belief that many of the concepts important to cam research have not yet been explicitly defined ( n = 8 ) , for example personal transformation [ 16 ] or unstuckness [ 17 ] .
other identified barriers included : a lack of psychometric data on existing tools ( n = 11 ) ; lack of a common resource of outcome measures ( n = 7 ) ; not knowing where to look ( n = 5 ) ; poor documentation regarding outcome measures used in published research , making comparative studies difficult ( n = 4 ) ; copyright issues ( n = 2 ) ; and prohibitive cost ( n = 2 ) .
important domains of outcome measures participants responded in many different ways to the question regarding important outcome domains for cam research .
many identified that it is important to look at different perspectives of outcome measures such as the patient , provider , family and community perspective .
others identified aspects of interventions other than outcomes , such as process , context and meaning .
an additional group provided examples of outcome measures that they might have found difficult to group in domains , such as serenity , integration , body image , ability to relax , awareness and holism .
a framework of outcome domains important in cam research based on the questionnaire responses , a consensus building meeting of the authors and feedback from experts in cam and outcomes assessment , we have developed a preliminary framework of outcome domains important in cam research ( table 3 ) .
the framework has nine main categories .
outcomes can address physical , psychological , social and spiritual aspects of the intervention .
holistic outcomes encompass each of the physical , psychological , social and spiritual domains .
quality of life , encompasses any two of the physical , psychological , social and spiritual domains .
individualized measures assess unique patient - centred outcomes for each research participant .
examples of such measures are the mymop [ 18 ] and goal attainment scaling [ 19 ] .
while individualized measures may be classified into any or all of the remaining domains , depending on the nature of a research participant 's identified health concerns and personal treatment goals , they are unique because of their individualized nature and were therefore placed in a separate outcome domain .
the context of healing and the process of healing are not outcomes per se but were identified as being of such importance to cam research that , for completeness , they are included in our framework .

for example , awareness , balance and enablement are fundamental concepts within the spiritual domain .
awareness , however , may also be conceptualized as a psychological outcome and for this reason is listed under both the spiritual and psychological domains .
although the nine categories are not mutually exclusive , our aim was for as much exclusivity as possible .
many relevant concepts , by their nature , address more than one clinically relevant outcome domain and therefore exclusivity appears impossible .
presenting our framework of outcome domains as a table does not adequately portray the linkages between domains , nor the underlying global concepts of whole systems and healing ; however , we are somewhat constrained by a two - dimensional manuscript .
a diagram is somewhat more useful , as it can highlight these linkages , although it cannot show the amount of detail that can be listed in a table .
a complementary figure to table 3 is presented in figure 1 .
in the figure , outcomes that are more specific are indicated towards the centre , and outcomes that are more general towards the outside .
quality of life has dashed lines at the four corners to indicate that it may comprise some or all of the four categories it contains .
the choice of colour also intends to infer meaning : green commonly symbolizes holism ; quality of life is a gradient of the four colours representing the four categories ; process and context fade toward the four categories ; and bright yellow represents individualized outcomes to indicate difference from the rest .
figure 1 framework of outcome domains .
discussion our preliminary framework provides a foundation for the development of a large , comprehensive collection of cam outcomes .
the framework fits very well in a whole systems perspective , which requires an expanded set of outcome measures .
several authors have previously conceptualized the implications of a whole systems approach to the range of potential patient - related outcomes [ 14,20,21 ] , although it was not their intent to develop a framework of cam outcomes .
all identified the importance of the process and context of an intervention , in particular the patient - provider relationship .
each also addressed the impact of the philosophy and practice of health and healing on the therapeutic relationship , for example assisting patients in self - healing and providing individualizing treatments .
our framework builds on this work by highlighting how all relevant outcome domains , including issues of process and context , are linked and encompassed by a consistent philosophical approach to health and healing .
although measures do not exist for every outcome domain in the framework , the framework can be used to identify " gaps " and to direct future outcome measure development .
our proposed framework may also be used when making decisions regarding which outcome measures to use to ensure all appropriate domains are considered .
the framework and the data from this survey will be used to develop an online database of outcome measures relevant to cam research .
the database will help address some of the identified barriers to finding outcome measures - for example , the lack of a common resource .
further , appropriate marketing and hosting the database on in - cam 's web site [ 22 ] may address the barrier of not knowing where to look .
undoubtedly , the question will be posed whether there is a need to make such a clear distinction between conventional and cam outcomes and whether we are not , in fact , adding to the polarization between conventional medicine and cam .
we do not believe this is the case , and would encourage a similarly broad perspective in conventional medical research .
it is easy to see how conventional interventions can also be multidimensional , placing value on the patient - provider relationship and acknowledging non - specific aspects .
for example , the assessment of treatment interventions in cancer care often falls short in addressing the complexity of cancer treatment outcomes. whether or not cam is included as part of treatment , cancer treatment consists of many component parts that are difficult to tease apart , such as support from friends and family , the degree to which information needs are met and a strong patient - provider relationship .
each component plays an essential role in patient healing and when considered as a whole system of care , the whole is much greater than the sum of the component parts .
all effectiveness research , whether cam or conventional , should be designed to capture all factors relevant to the intervention and all relevant outcomes .
other common examples of conventional interventions that may be regarded as whole systems are palliative care , addiction treatment and chronic pain management .
our outcomes are particularly relevant to the concept of integrative medicine , which ideally covers the entire spectrum of ' good medicine ' [ 23,24 ] .
currently , many cam and integrative medicine practitioners do not use outcome measures to assess their interventions and , further , many cam / im researchers limit themselves to biomedical and quality of life outcomes .
therefore , it is important that comprehensive information is available to encourage the use of psychometrically sound and relevant outcome measures in cam / im research and practice .
we hope that the availability of an outcomes database will assist cam / im researchers in refining and clarifying their research questions , which too often are broad and unspecific .
the framework highlights the fact that there are many potentially relevant outcomes of cam / im interventions .
ideally , research should encompass all relevant domains ; but , the decision of which outcome measures to use must balance the choice between an all - encompassing set of outcome measures of high psychometric quality and patient burden .
further work on identifying a core group of outcomes for cam research is clearly needed .
some limitations to our study must be acknowledged , specifically with respect to our sampling method and response rate .
first , we conducted an online survey of a motivated group of individuals interested in cam research .
each member of our sampling frame has access to the internet and had taken the time to sign up as a member of in - cam , camera or both .
this group is therefore likely not representative of all individuals in canada with an interest in cam research .
further , our response rate was relatively low when standard survey methodology is considered ; however it is the highest response rate received for an online survey conducted by either of the research networks .
since membership is free of charge and there are no requirements for network membership , it is to be expected that our survey was relevant to only some of the ' members ' .
our respondents are clearly , then , a highly motivated group of individuals interested in cam outcomes and may not be representative of cam researchers and practitioners as a whole .
we believe , however , that 164 responses , plus the length of many written responses , suggest the relevance of our project to those involved or interested in cam research .
the magnitude of the response also suggests that the area of cam outcomes is in need of development and clarification .
conclusion a publicly available resource for accessing outcome measures that are relevant for cam research is needed .
we propose a framework for considering outcomes for clinical research into cam from a whole systems perspective .

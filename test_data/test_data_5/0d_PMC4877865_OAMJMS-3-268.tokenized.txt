background : il - 13 is one of many cytokines responsible for the chronic inflammation of asthma .
aim : the aim of this study was to determine the effect of combined therapy ics / laba and ics / laba plus montelukast in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma by analyzing of serum il - 13 and fev1 before the treatment and after 6 months of therapy .
material and methods : in study we included two groups .
first group with 27 patients were treated with ics / laba .
second group with 29 patients were treated with ics / laba plus montelukast .
in each of them were measured serum il - 13 levels by the elisa method and fev1 before and after 6 months of treatment .
results were statistically analyzed according to the wilcoxon pairs test and t - test .
results : the obtained results in both groups showed that the serum il - 13 before the start of therapy were much higher and after 6 months of treatment significantly reduces their value , which in the second group were more expressed .
the difference in the average value of fev1 in both groups before and after therapy was statistically significant .
conclusion : treatment with ics / laba plus montelukast proved superior compared to therapy of ics / laba in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma and allows achievement of well controlled of asthma with subjective clinical improvement .
asthma il - 13 fev1 ics / laba montelukast introduction if the 20 - th century was underlined with an " explosion " of allergic diseases and asthma , the 21 - th century is already called epidemic century for allergic diseases and asthma .
asthma is a worldwide problem and also is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide - - 300 millions or 7.2 % patients suffered from asthma .
prevalence was increasing in many countries , especially in children - - 6 % and in adult 10 % .
there are 250,000 deaths annually .
it is estimated that the number of people with asthma will grow by more than 100 million by 2025 [ 1 - 4 ] .
in the republic of macedonia 100,000 or 5 % of the population suffer from asthma [ 5 , 6 ] .
asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role ( mast cells , eosinophils , t lymphocytes , macrophages , neutrophils , and epithelial cells ) .
these mediators act on cells in the airway , leading to contraction of smooth muscle , oedema due to plasma leakage and mucus plugging .
the chronic inflammation is associated with airway hypersponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing , breathlessness , chest tightness and coughing , particularly at night or in the early morning .
these episodes are usually associated with widespread , but variable , airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment [ 1 , 7 , 8 ] .
in this chronic inflammation are involve more than 100 mediators and the interleukins take central place in this inflammation [ 9 , 10 ] .
the interleukins are cytokines that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells .
il - 1 activates t cells , il - 2 stimulates the proliferation of antigen - activated t and b cells ; il - 4 , il - 5 and il - 6 stimulated proliferation and differentiation of b cells ; interferon - gamma ( ifngamma ) activates macrophages while il - 3 , il - 7 , and ( gm - csf ) stimulate hematopoiesis [ 11 , 12 ] .
t cells play a key role in coordinating the immune response in asthma .
the key to the functioning of t cells is a molecule that binds to the antigen : t cells receptor .
generally the t cells which have the cd4 + act as helper cells ( th2 - ly ) , and cd8 + act as cytotoxic cells ( tc - ly ) .
cd4 + helper cells , differentiate into subpopulations of t cells in th1 , th2 , th9 , th17 , th22 and t follicular effectors cell .
th2 cells produce , il - 4 , il - 5 , il - 9 , il - 13 , gm - csf and il - 25 , il - 31 , il - 33 that are responsible for chronic eosinophilic inflammation , inflammation in allergic diseases , including and asthma [ 13 , 16 ] .
interleukin 13 ( il - 13 ) is one of many cytokines responsible for the chronic inflammation of asthma .
il - 13 is synthesized by activated th2 cd4 and cd8 cells in response to antigen specific stimulus .
it has a similar function as il - 4 .
this is due to the ability to connect to a common receptor il4r [ 16 , 17 ] .
patients with asthma who have increase values of serum il - 13 , lead to airway hyperresponsiveness , mucus hypersecretion , activation of fibroblasts and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of smooth muscle of the airways and if they do not use preventive anti - asthma treatment , may cause irreversible airway remodelling [ 18 ] .
the national asthma education and prevention program have classified asthma as : intermittent , mild persistent , moderate persistent and severe persistent .
these classifications are based on severity , which is determined by symptoms and lung function tests .
you should be assigned to the most severe category in which any feature occurs [ 19 ] .
asthma is considered severe persistent if without treatment any of the following are true [ 19 ] .
symptoms : occur throughout each day , severely limit daily physical activities , night time symptoms occur often , sometimes every night , lung function tests are abnormal ( fev1 < 60 % or less of expected value ) , and peak expiratory flow ( pef ) varies more than 30 % from morning to afternoon .
fev1 - forced expiratory volume in the first second is the maximal volume of air exhaled in the first second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration expressed .
fev1 should be measured from a series of at least three forced expiratory curves that have an acceptable start of test and are free from artefact , such as a cough .
the largest fev1 should be recorded after examining the data from all of the usable curves , even if they do not come from the same curve .
the calculated values than are converted to a percentage of normal , based on date of birth , height , weight , gender and race .
fev1 is a marker for the degree of airway obstruction in asthma .
reversibility with the use of a bronchodilator is defined as an increase in fev1 of 12 % or 200 ml [ 19 , 20 , 40 ] .
the aim of this study was to determine the effect of double combined therapy of inhaled corticosteroid and long - acting beta agonist - ics / laba and triple combined therapy ics / laba plus ltra : leukotriene receptor antagonist ( montelukast ) in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma by analyzing of il - 13 and fev1 before and after 6 months of therapy .
material and methods we have examined 56 patients with a diagnosis of uncontrolled severe persistent asthma treated at the clinic of pulmonology and allergology .
the available subjects were divided at random into two groups .
first group with 27 patients were treated with combined therapy of ics / laba ( 500 / 50 mcg - twice daily ) .
second group with 29 patients were treated with ics / laba ( 500 / 50 mcg - twice daily ) plus montelukast ( 10 mg - daily ) .
in each of them were measured serum il - 13 levels by the elisa method before the treatment and after 6 months of therapy at the institute of immunobiology and human genetics , faculty of medicine , ss cyril and methodius university of skopje .
the reference values for il - 13 are 0 to 6.9 pg / ml. spirometry was done with spirometer schiller sp - 1 according to the standard methodology at the clinic of pulmonology and allergology , faculty of medicine , ss cyril and methodius university of skopje .
we were analyzed fev1 - forced expiratory volume in the first second .
inclusion criteria : uncontrolled severe persistent asthma patients .
the classification was according to the actual version of the gina guidelines ( global initiative for asthma ) [ 1 ] and guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma ( epr - 3 ) of national asthma education prevention program ( naepp ) [ 19 ] .
the age of the patients was 18 - 70 years .

discussion the goal of asthma treatment is to achieve and maintain clinical total control .
combination therapy with ics / laba represents the gold standard in the treatment of asthma , safe and effective treatment which is recommended by the global initiative for asthma in the treatment of uncontrolled severe persistent asthma in the step 3 and 4 .
combination high dose of ics / laba , generally provides additional benefit but it is well recognized that not in all patients will achieve well - controlled asthma despite an appropriately high dose of ics or ics / laba combination therapy , in such patients , there is a need for additional add - on therapy such as treatment with a ltra .
addition of a leukotriene receptor antagonist ( ltra ) to patients who have considered to be insufficiently controlled resulted in a significant clinically improvement in asthma control , pulmonary function and quality of life [ 1 , 19 , 21 - 24 ] .
in our study serum il - 13 was increased in all patients before the treatment .
after 6 mounts therapy with combination of ics / laba in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma we found decreases of serum il - 13 , but added the montelukast in this combination proved superior effect and allow achievement of total control of asthma with subjective clinical improvement .
unfortunately there are not available studies that analyze the level of il - 13 from the effect of adding of montelukast to combination therapy ics / laba in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma .
it is known that the significant elevations in il - 13 are found in the airways of patients with both allergic and nonallergic asthma [ 24 ] .
in the study of shimbori c , montelukast treatment also decreased mrna levels of il - 6 , il - 10 , il - 13 , and tgf - beta1 , all of which were elevated in fibrotic lungs [ 26 ] .
in several studies have confirmed that montelukast add - on therapy with ics or ics / laba treatment is effective for managing asthma in achieving control and reducing asthma symptoms in patients who were previously uncontrolled asthma symptoms with ics or ics / laba treatment who had uncontrolled [ 27 - 29 ] .
in our study the value of fev1 at the start of therapy were lower in both groups and after 6 months of therapy confirmed as statistically significant improvement of lung function , increase especially in the group which used montelukast and ics / laba. that is referenced in other studies when added to ics , montelukast induced further improvement in symptoms and pulmonary function , particularly in patients still symptomatic despite treatment with ics .
although in short - term studies the combination of ics plus laba was more effective on symptoms and pulmonary function than ics plus montelukast [ 30 - 34 ] .
virchow et al in a recent article from an observational study on 1681 patients not controlled by ics , or ics plus laba , showed that the addition of montelukast improved both asthma control and asthma - related quality of life [ 21 , 34 ] .
in a 6 - week study in symptomatic patients on high - dose ics and short - acting b2 - agonists , the addition of an ltra significantly improved lung function and reduced exacerbations .
in addition , in a smaller , open label study of 313 patients with insufficiently controlled patients on fixed combination therapy with ics and labas , dupont et al. observed an improvement in asthma symptoms and pulmonary function with add - on ltra therapy after 2 months of therapy [ 21 , 35 , 36 ] .
many long - term studies on large groups of adult and pediatric patients , showed clinical and laboratory safety profile for montelukast because no reported significant or considerable side effects observed for placebo or active control / usual care therapies .
the safety profile of montelukast did not change with long - term [ 36 - 39 ] .
the relatively small number of participants may be considered a limitation factor .
in conclusion , treatment with ics / laba plus montelukast proved to be superior compared to therapy of ics / laba in patients with uncontrolled severe persistent asthma , leading to reduced inflammation and allows achievement of well controlled of asthma with subjective clinical improvement .
the reduced values of il - 13 after 6 month treatment with ics / laba led to clinical improvement , achieving good control of the disease and certainly able to reduce the dose of ics / laba .
this suggests that il - 13 is an important marker for monitoring of evolution and success of therapy in patients with asthma .
in the future , research in the field of therapy in asthma , may be directed to discover a new molecules which specifically inhibited the activity of th2 cytokines , which actually indirectly reduce mediators and markers of inflammation .

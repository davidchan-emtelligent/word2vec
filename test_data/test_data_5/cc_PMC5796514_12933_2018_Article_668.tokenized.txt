the creative commons public domain dedication waiver ( http :// creativecommons.org / publicdomain / zero / 1.0 /) applies to the data made available in this article , unless otherwise stated.issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 in a review article on this journal , milton packer discusses the " potential confounding effect of stem - cell chemokines ( sdf - 1alpha )" on diabetic vascular complications during therapy with dpp - 4 inhibitors [ 1 ] .
this misconception is also part of the underlying hypothesis in another author 's recent article [ 2 ] .
the purpose of this commentary is to show that such misinterpretation is not supported by data and derives from a partial and selective consideration of the literature .
the statement that sdf - 1alpha promotes inflammation and fibrosis thereby exerting a potentially worsening effect on the course of micro - and microvascular diabetic complications derives from a flawed interpretation of available data .
dpp - 4 inhibition increases the concentrations of biologically active / intact sdf - 1alpha [ 3 ] , whereas in studies showing an inverse association between sdf - 1alpha concentrations and adverse cardiovascular outcomes , total ( mostly cleaved and biologically inactive ) sdf - 1alpha was measured [ 4 , 5 ] , the concentrations of which actually decline during therapy with a dpp - 4 inhibitor [ 3 , 6 ] .
several of the remaining references cited to support the author 's claim refer to genetic studies on the sdf - 1 gene polymorphisms , which are not pertinent to the effect of dpp - 4 inhibitors on active sdf - 1alpha levels .
to interpret data in the right perspective , it should be noted that the best characterized physiological function of sdf - 1alpha is the regulation of hematopoietic stem / progenitor cell kinetics [ 7 ] .
as a practical example of this , plerixafor , a drug active on the sdf - 1alpha receptor cxcr4 , is clinically used to stimulate stem cell mobilization [ 8 ] .
the paper by kim et al .
[ 9 ] , mentioned by the author to support the claim that sdf - 1alpha - mediated neovascularization in diabetic neuropathy in detrimental to the course of this complication , actually provides evidence that stem cell mobilization with plerixafor is a therapeutic option against diabetic neuropathy , a concept that is being tested in ongoing trials .
remarkably , dpp - 4 inhibitors have been consistently shown to increase stem / progenitor cell levels in type 2 diabetes [ 3 , 6 , 10 , 11 ] .
since reduction of stem / progenitor cells strongly predicts the development or worsening of diabetic micro - and macroangiopathy [ 12 , 13 ] , the effect of dpp - 4 inhibitors on sdf - 1alpha and stem cells should speculatively be protective against complications .
the author presents contrasting data on the pathophysiologic role of sdf - 1alpha in diabetic versus non - diabetic renal disease , but fails to acknowledge studies in the literature that do not fit the proposed hypothesis , such as papers showing that sdf - 1alpha exerts a protective action against the progression of diabetic nephropathy [ 14 - 16 ] .
the author states that the mechanism whereby saxagliptin significantly reduced albuminuria in the savor - timi megatrial is unknown .
quite interestingly , while definite data are certainly not available , an experimental study by chang et al. shows that such a beneficial effect can be mediated by sdf - 1alpha [ 17 ] .
several reviews of the literature and pooled analyses indicate a consistent favourable effects of dpp - 4 inhibitors on albuminuria [ 18 , 19 ] .
a systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies supports that dpp - 4 inhibitors can indeed improve diabetic microvascular complications [ 20 ] .
selective literature citation leads to an imbalanced perspective also in the discussion about cardiovascular outcomes trials , where the author spotlights the risk of heart failure associated with dpp - 4 inhibitors , which is debated [ 21 ] , but fails to mention the highly consistent risk of amputations observed with the sglt2 inhibitor canagliflozin [ 22 - 24 ] .
in order to avoid problems in the interpretation of the rapidly evolving literature , review articles should describe methodologies for searching databases and selecting relevant articles .
otherwise , these are personal viewpoints and not review articles based on a comprehensive consideration of all the available evidence .

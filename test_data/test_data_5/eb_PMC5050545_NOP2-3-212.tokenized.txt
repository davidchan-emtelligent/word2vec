abstract background nursing students will graduate into stressful workplace environments and resilience is an essential acquired ability for surviving the workplace .
few studies have explored the relationship between resilience and the degree of innate dispositional mindfulness , compassion , compassion fatigue and burnout in nursing students , including those who find themselves in the position of needing to work in addition to their academic responsibilities .
aim this paper investigates the predictors of resilience , including dispositional mindfulness and employment status of third year nursing students from three australian universities .
design participants were 240 undergraduate , third year , nursing students .
participants completed a resilience measure ( connor - davidson resilience scale , cd - risc ) , measures of dispositional mindfulness ( cognitive and affective mindfulness scale revised , cams - r ) and professional quality of life ( the professional quality of life scale version 5 , proqol5 ) , such as compassion satisfaction , compassion fatigue and burnout .
method an observational quantitative successive independent samples survey design was employed .
a stepwise linear regression was used to evaluate the extent to which predictive variables were related each to resilience .
results the predictive model explained 57 % of the variance in resilience .
dispositional mindfulness subset acceptance made the strongest contribution , followed by the expectation of a graduate nurse transition programme acceptance , with dispositional mindfulness total score and employment greater than 20 hours per week making the smallest contribution .
this was a resilient group of nursing students who rated high with dispositional mindfulness and exhibited hopeful and positive aspirations for obtaining a position in a competitive graduate nurse transition programme after graduation .

nursing students will graduate into these environments and resilience is an essential acquired ability for surviving the workplace .
nursing students also face stressors from academic workloads and deadlines .
they commonly undertake paid employment above clinical placement commitments when already under stress from the many challenges of dealing with university study ( pulido - martos et al. 2012 ) .
resilience is also a desired attribute for nursing students .
understanding the relationship between resilience , coping mechanisms such as dispositional mindfulness , compassion satisfaction and self - compassion and the negative impacts of the workplace combined with study stress , such as compassion fatigue and burnout are central to the results offered in this study ( cyrulnik 2011 , drury et al. 2014 , hegney et al. 2014 , phillips et al. 2014 , craigie et al. 2016 ) .
background resilience is described as using flexible adaptability in the face of personal , workplace and academic related challenges and is recognized extensively in both individuals and social groups ( pulido - martos et al. 2012 , drury et al. 2014 , hegney et al. 2014 , rees et al. 2015 ) .
garcia - dia et al. define resilience as , ' the ability of a person to recover , rebound , bounce back , adjust or even thrive following misfortune , change or adversity ' ( 2013 , p. 264 ) .
cyrulnik adds that resilience describes an individual 's , ' ability to succeed , to live and to develop in a positive way despite the stress or adversity that would normally involve the real possibility of a negative outcome ' ( 2009 , p2 ) .
resilience is associated with greater self - compassion and compassion satisfaction ( neff & mcgehee 2010 ) .
a growing body of knowledge supports the association of stress resilience , psychological empowerment and academic achievement for students in nursing programmes ( hodges et al. 2008 , drury et al.2014 , galbraith et al. 2014 , hegney et al. 2014 ) .
there is evidence that personal resilience helps buffer the negative impact of stress in intrinsically challenging situations , for example , university students who maintain both academic and work - related responsibilities .
mindfulness is defined as , ' the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose , in the present moment and non - judgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment to moment ' ( kabat - zinn 2003 , p. 145 ) .
dispositional mindfulness is not the same as mindfulness meditation , where people make a conscious , focused practice of attending to their current state and sensations .
most recent evidence suggests that dispositional mindfulness could also be described in terms of an innate multifaceted construct characterized by different features that include observing , acting with awareness , non - judging , self - compassion and non - reactivity or acceptance ( feldman et al. 2007 , chiesa 2013 , jha et al. 2014 ) .
when dispositional mindfulness is present , individuals experience the world free or unfiltered from elaboration or internalization and therefore their self - esteem is less likely to be impacted on by positive or negative daily occurrences ( heppner et al. 2008 ) .
dispositional mindfulness is also associated with better performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks that have implications for maintaining psychological health .
dispositional mindfulness is therefore conceptualized as a stable state or ' disposition ' and can be seen as an inherent personality trait , though it can also be taught ( kabat - zinn 2003 , feldman et al. 2007 , heppner et al. 2008 , chiesa 2013 ) .
recent studies have focussed on mindfulness interventions in nursing students to alleviate stress and promote resilience ( goff 2011 , foureur et al. 2013 , mcgillivray & pigeon 2015 ) with watson et al .
( 2008 ) suggesting that nursing student 's personality and coping inability are related to adverse psychological outcomes .
as burnout and compassion fatigue are such a detriment to nurse well - being and the nursing workforce overall it is essential to uncover if and to what extent student nurses may be suffering from these debilitating affective / cognitive states .
there are gaps in understanding the complex relationships between factors affecting resilience and innate qualities such as mindfulness and self - compassion .
few studies have explored the relationship between resilience and the degree of innate dispositional mindfulness , compassion , compassion fatigue and burnout in nursing students , including those who find themselves in the position of needing to work in addition to their academic responsibilities .
the study aim the aim of this study was to observe the predictors of resilience in third year nursing students as a strategy for dealing with or managing study and workplace related stress .
specifically assessed were , innate dispositional mindfulness , professional quality of life and employment during study enrolment to determine if these psychological and workload states were predictive of personal resilience .
methodology this study was an observational quantitative successive independent samples survey design .
method design the sample used for this study was a subset of participants from the international collaboration on workforce resilience 1 ( icwr - 1 ) which was a larger ongoing study to test a workplace resilience model in both university students and the nursing workforce .
a complete description of the methodology and findings from the icwr - 1 study are available elsewhere ( rees et al. 2015 ) .
recruitment and data collection took place from december 2014 - june 2015 at different times across the three sites .
the invitations sent out by the universities contained a letter of invitation , the participant information sheet and a link to the qualtrics survey ( qualtrics labs inc. ) hosting site .
five successive survey availabilities dependant on class scheduling were offered with an average of a 20 % response rate .
to ensure reliability of the study , the inclusion criteria for the study required participants to be currently enrolled students at the university .
no mindfulness intervention was performed .
participants participants were 240 undergraduate nursing students from three australian universities , two metropolitan , one regional , who completed the survey measures .
as such the majority of participants were female ( n = 219 , 89 % , age : mean = 29 sd 10.56 ) .
in terms of country of birth , 75 % identified as australia , 16 % as asia or pacific islands , 9 % india / europe / africa .
all participants were volunteers and were provided with a written explanation of the research project and were given a link to complete the questionnaire via a confidential online survey .
five successive survey availabilities were offered with an average of 20 % response rate .
resilience variable resilience measure connor - davidson resilience scale ( cd - risc10 ) the connor - davidson resilience scale ( connor & davidson 2003 ) was developed as a survey based measure of stress , coping and ability or resilience .
evidence from previous studies in the community ( hegney et al. 2007 ) and nursing populations ( gillespie et al .
2009 ) suggests that this scale is a valid and reliable measure of resilience for a range of normal and clinical populations ( connor et al. 2003 ) .
the original 25 item scale uses a five point response scale .
higher scores reflect greater resilience .
this study used a shorter 10 - item version that assessed aspects of resilience pertaining to a central core resilience construct ( campbell - sills & stein 2007 ) .
the abridged cd - risc - 10 version reflects the ability to tolerate experiences such as change , personal problems , illness , pressure , failure and painful feeling ( item 's examples : ' able to adapt to change ' , ' tend to bounce back after illness or hardship ' and ' can stay focused under pressure ') .
in our sample , the cd - risc - 10 showed high internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha = 0.90 ) .
mindfulness and professional quality of life variables cognitive and affective mindfulness scale revised ( cams - r ) the 12 - item cognitive and affective mindfulness scale - revised ( cams - r , feldman et al .
2007 ) was used to measure individual differences in mindfulness either as a total score or with the four subset domains of mindfulness ( attention , present focus , awareness and acceptance / non - judgment ) .
the scale and its subsets demonstrated acceptable levels of internal consistency in our sample .
( cronbach 's alpha = 0.79 - 0.84 ) .
the professional quality of life scale version 5 ( proqol5 ) the professional quality of life scale version 5 ( proqol5 ) ( stamm 2010 ) is a 30 - item self - report measure of the positive and negative aspects of helping professions .
professionals rate themselves on each of the 30 statements on a five - point likert scale ( 1 = never 5 = very often ) .
the measure yields subscale scores for compassion satisfaction , burnout and secondary traumatic stress .
the compassion satisfaction subscale measures the extent to which an individual is able to derive pleasure from doing his or her work well or helping others ( e.g. i am happy that i chose to do this work ) .
higher scores on the compassion satisfaction scale indicate higher level of functioning and are correlated with self - compassion ( stamm 2010 ) .
the burnout subscales measure a professional 's feelings of hopelessness and difficulties in dealing with doing his or her job effectively ( e.g. ' i feel trapped by my job as a helper ') .
higher scores on the burnout scale indicate higher level of burnout .
the secondary traumatic stress subscale measures work - related , secondary exposure to people who have experienced trauma ( e.g. i find it difficult to separate my personal life from my job as a helper ) .
higher scores on the secondary traumatic stress scale indicate higher level of secondary trauma ( stamm 2010 ) .
the current sample yielded the following internal ( cronbach 's alpha ) consistency coefficients : compassion satisfaction ( 0.86 ) , burnout ( 0.76 ) and compassion fatigue ( 0.84 ) .
demographic data information that described the participants included what programme of study they were enrolled in , past nursing and tertiary qualifications , employment and the amount of hours while studying and if they were expecting to be accepted into a graduate nurse transition programme or internship at the completion of their studies .
ethical approval human research ethics approval was sought and secured at each university , site 1 ( hrec reference code : sonm28 - 2014 ) , site 2 ( hrec reference code : cf14 / 2126 - 2014001130 ) and site 3 ( hrec reference code : 2014 / 157 ) .
analysis statistical analyses were performed using stata 14 ( statacorp , college station , tx , usa ) .
the data from the three sites were extracted from the total icwr - 1 data and incomplete data and surveys were excluded leaving a sample of 240 students .
all continuous data were deemed normally distributed after skewness and kurtosis analysis .
descriptive data were presented across the three tertiles of resilience ( cd - risc ) scores as high , medium and low categories to describe the distribution of resilience related to the demographic variables .
differences between the three groups were tested using the chi - square test , cochrane 's q test or variance analysis according to anova .
stepwise linear regression and the ' margins' postestimation command to obtain estimated marginal means and associated confidence intervals were used to evaluate the extent to which resilience ( cd - risc total score ) was related to each predictive variable .
using seven selected predictor variables to run a multiple regression , this study needed a minimum sample size of 153 subjects to achieve 95 % power and a medium effect size ( 0.15 ) at alpha = 0.05 .
predictive variables were tested for multicollinearity and the residuals were tested for normal distribution by means of the kolmogorov - smirnov test .
an a priori alpha of p < 0.05 was established for this study .
results descriptive statistics of the 240 students , the greatest proportion ( n = 194 , 79 %) were studying on campus , were enrolled in a bachelor of nursing program ( n = 230 , 94 %) and were fulltime students ( n = 207 , 85 %) .
seventy - five per cent ( n = 183 ) had been employed in the last 4 weeks prior to the survey and 45 % of these ( n = 110 ) , had been employed greater than 20 hours per week .
seventy eight percent ( n = 192 ) were expecting to be accepted into a graduate nurse transition programme at the completion of their studies .
the mean resilience score was high ( 37 +/ - 7 ) and the distributions of the tertiles of resilience were different ( p < 0.001 ) .
the mindfulness ( cams - r ) mean score was different for each category of resilience ( f ( 2 , 239 ) = 66.19 , p < 0.0005 , wilk 's lambda = 0.62 , partial eta2 = 0.37 ) , as were the compassion satisfaction mean scores ( f ( 2 , 239 ) = 33.5 , p < 0.0005 , wilk 's lambda = 0.77 , partial eta2 = 0.22 ) and the compassion fatigue mean scores ( f ( 2 , 239 ) = 27.6 , p < 0.0005 , wilk 's lambda = 0.80 , partial eta2 = 0.19 ) .

john wiley & sons , ltd correlations between resilience , dispositional mindfulness , burnout , compassion satisfaction , compassion fatigue , employment > 20 hours per week and expecting to be accepted into a graduate nurse transition programme are summarized in table 2 .
resilience correlated positively with dispositional mindfulness ( r = 0.644 , p < 0.001 ) and compassion satisfaction ( r = 0.494 , p < 0.001 ) and negatively with compassion fatigue ( r = - 0.472 , p < 0.001 ) .
compassion fatigue correlated positively with burnout ( r = 0.529 , p < 0.001 ) and negatively with dispositional mindfulness ( r = - 0.465 , p < 0.001 ) and compassion satisfaction ( r = - 0.4830 , p < 0.001 ) .
compassion satisfaction correlated with dispositional mindfulness ( r = 0.376 , p < 0.001 ) and expecting to be accepted into a graduate nurse transition programme ( r = 0.321 , p < 0.001 ) .
employment status correlated only weakly with compassion satisfaction .

john wiley & sons , ltd a forward hierarchical linear regression analysis ( adjusted for age and gender ) was chosen to test the predictive validity for dispositional mindfulness ( cams - r ) , professional quality of life ( proqol5 ) , employment status and expecting to be accepted into a graduate nurse transition programme at the completion of their studies on the variance in resilience according to the research aim .
variables were entered into the model in a hierarchical manner and retained if p < 0.2 .
preliminary analyses were conducted to ensure no violation of the assumptions of normality , linearity , multicollinearity and homoscedasticity .
a summary of the hierarchical regression is presented in table 3 .

john wiley & sons , ltd after adjusting for age and gender ( removed ) , dispositional mindfulness ( cams - r ) and the subscales , acceptance , attention , awareness and present focus were entered at step 1 .
the present focus covariant was dropped because of between term collinearity .
both attention and present focus were removed from the model leaving the total dispositional mindfulness score and the sub score of acceptance .
model 1 explained a significant increase in the proportion of variance in resilience , r 2 = 0.47 , f ( 2 , 238 ) = 100.1 , p < 0.0001 , explaining 45 % of the variance in resilience .
professional quality of life ( pro - qol5 ) total score and its subsets , compassion satisfaction , burnout and compassion fatigue were entered into the model at step 2 and accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in resilience , r 2 = 0.56 , f ( 1 , 239 ) = 56.1 , p < 0.0001 .
the burnout subset was dropped from the model .
the total variance explained by the model as a whole was 56 % , thus explaining 9 % of the variance .
at step 3 , employment ( in the last 4 weeks ) was entered into the model and dropped .
then employment ( greater than 20 hours per week ) was entered into the model r 2 = 0.56 , f ( 6 , 239 ) = 47.31 , p < 0.001 .
at the last step , expectation of a graduate nurse transition programme acceptance was entered into the model r 2 = 0.57 , f ( 6 , 239 ) = 42.16 , p < 0.0001 .
the total model explained 57 % of the variance in resilience , all covariates were included .
this means that employment explained an additional 1.5 % of the variance in resilience , when the effects of dispositional mindfulness and professional quality of life were controlled for statistically .
all of the observed predictor variables made a statistically significant contribution to the model .
in the order of importance , dispositional mindfulness subset acceptance ( beta = 1.40 , omega2 = 0.125 ) made the strongest contribution , followed by the expectation of a graduate nurse transition programme acceptance ( beta = 1.76 , omega2 = 0.083 ) , with mindfulness total score ( beta = 0.270 , omega2 = 0.031 ) and employment ( beta = 0.892 , omega2 = 0.004 ) making the smallest contribution .
these beta values represent the unique contribution of each variable , when the overlapping effects of all other variables were controlled for statistically .
none of the other demographic variables were predictive of resilience .
marginal means were calculated for all predictor variables and presented graphically .
marginal means for continuous variables measures the instantaneous rate of change , which may or may not be close to the effect on the different variables p ( y = 1 ) of a one unit increase in resilience .
refer to figure 1 .
the marginal effects are the same as the slope coefficients .
this is because relationships are linear and do not vary depending on the values of the other variables .
figure 1 postestimation marginal means for resilience scores adjusted for age , and gender for independent variables and covariates in the prediction model .
discussion resilience the development of resilience in student nurses is related to their inherent traits , experience and management of stress ( reyes et al. 2015 ) .
in this study , the cohort resilience scores were high compared with other studies ( neff & mcgehee 2010 , mcgillivray & pidgeon 2015 ) , but comparable to paramedics and immigrant women studied in australia ( gayton & lovell 2012 , loh & klug 2012 ) .
an integrative review conducted on resilience in registered nurses ( hart et al .
2014 ) found that intrapersonal characteristics of hope , self - efficacy and coping assisted nurses to bounce back and recover from stressful situations. of the seven studies in hart et al. ' s ( 2014 ) review , only three reported a mean age of ( 46.1 , 38.4 and 35.4 years ) respectively .
suggesting that older nursing students had higher levels of resilience , a trend noted in this study .
gillespie et al. ' s ( 2007 , 2009 ) research on australian operating room nurses found age , experience and education did not contribute to resilience , whereas interpersonal characteristics ( alligned with dispositional mindfulness ) such as hope , self - efficacy and coping did .
to maintain resilience requires greater psychological flexibility through the skills of mindfulness and acceptance ( waugh et al. 2011 ) .
forty - five per cent of the variance in resilience was explained by dispositional mindfulness , in particular , the acceptance or non - judgmental subset of mindfulness .
dispositional mindfulness is an innate characteristic which is associated with salutary coping with stress , enhanced well - being and with less psychological distress ( roemer et al. 2015 ) .
as well , lower levels of waking cortisol ( the ' stress hormone ') have been associated with low levels of dispositional mindfulness ( daubenmier et al. 2014 , laurent et al. 2015 ) .
olson et al .
( 2015 ) survey of first year us paediatric medical residents found mindfulness and self - compassion were positively associated with resilience and inversely related with burnout , although gender was not related to resilience .
surprisingly , 40 % of medical residents met the criteria for burnout .
in this study , only 1 % of the cohort met the criteria for burnout ( stamm 2010 ) , but they were also working > 20 hours week and were rated in the highest tertile of compassion fatigue and the lowest tertile of both compassion satisfaction and resilience .
in keeping with hegney et al .
( 2014 ) , drury et al .
( 2014 ) and craigie et al .
( 2016 ) , compassion fatigue and burnout each had a negative relationship with resilience .
as well , working more than 20 hours per week had a weak , but evident , relationship with resilience , explaining less than 1 % of the variance .
as such , the benefits of being employed may be offset by the time constraints and additional stressors imposed as student nurses felt obligated to spend time at work , in competition with study time .
dyrbye et al .
( 2010 ) reports similar findings in medical students , though no published reports to our knowledge are available regarding nursing students and the employment variables linked to resilience .
a survey of third year nursing students ( n = 217 ) in china found that self - efficacy ( related to resilience and self - care ) contributed to optimism and problem - solving and reduced stress ( zhao et al. 2014 ) .
in addition , hodges et al .
( 2008 ) found that new graduate registered nurses in the usa , who are able to effectively problem solve and were goal - oriented , were more resilient .
it is worth noting though , that these findings may be affected by cultural issues .
expectations of receiving a graduate place following completion of the nursing degree explained 9 % of the variance of resilience .
a graduate nurse transition programme in australia is highly sought after and is believed by new graduate registered nurses to provide a solid foundation for practice ( mellor & greenhill 2014 ) .
at the time of the study , nursing students , in particular those from one site saw a downturn in graduate nurse transition programmes severely delaying their career prospects .
the students' positive thinking and emotional tenacity , all features of resilience qualities were demonstrated by 78 % of this cohort hopeful of a graduate placement .
the shortage of nurses remains a global issue , where reducing nursing turnover is an economic and quality of patient care imperative ( chachula et al. 2015 ) .
challenging , ever changing workplaces , job frustrations , diminished work - life balance and the reality of workplace dissonance reduces resilience and contributes to job stress and turnover of new graduate registered nurses ( hodges et al. 2008 , hart et al. 2014 ) .
the ability to ' bounce back ' following adverse circumstances requires personal traits such as hardiness , optimism , hope , self - efficacy , mindfulness and coping , where student nurses can learn behaviours to cope with stressful work environments before they graduate ( hart et al. 2014 ) .
reeve et al .
( 2013 ) highlight the need for nurse educators and academics to ensure that students develop positive coping strategies or learn to enhance the coping strategies they find successful , to successfully transition into the nursing workforce .
limitations in this study , five successive survey availabilities were offered with an average of a 20 % response rate .
the students who volunteered for the survey may have been the more resilient of targeted student groups , in keeping with the higher resilience scores in this cohort .
despite this , the sample did provide some insights into resilience in third year nursing students prior to transition into the workforce .
as resilience is needed for the nursing workforce , future longitudinal studies could follow a highly resilient student nurse population and investigate the adaption to the nursing workforce .
conclusion the results offered in this study are from an observational successive independent samples survey where 240 undergraduate nursing students from three universities in australia voluntarily responded .
the resilience scores were high overall compared with other similar surveys .
the strongest predictors of resilience were dispositional mindfulness and its subset of acceptance .
compassion fatigue and burnout correlated negatively with resilience .
employment greater than 20 hours per week explained only 1 % of the variance in resilience .
this was a resilient group of nursing students who rated highly with dispositional mindfulness and exhibited hopeful and positive aspirations for obtaining a position in a competitive graduate nurse transition programme after graduation .

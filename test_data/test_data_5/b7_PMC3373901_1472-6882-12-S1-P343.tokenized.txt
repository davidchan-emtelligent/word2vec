first , whether reflexologists consider it safe to treat people with heart disease and if so , whether the presence of cardiac disease influences the therapist 's treatment decisions .
reflexology teaching literature is contradictory on this subject , with ' heart ' disease listed as both an indication , which can benefit from treatment , and as a significant contraindication where treatment should be avoided .
the second concern is one of product quality , namely the issue of inconsistency of reflex points in reflexology maps .
methods an online survey invitation email was sent to all therapists in the membership database of the association of reflexologists .
survey questions included " do you treat clients with diagnosed heart problems " , " if you became aware of imbalances in the heart reflex area , what would you do " , " would you limit the treatment " and " would you expect the treatment to improve their heart condition ?
the email also contained a graphical attachment , an illustration of a blank outline of the feet with transparent bone structure .
we asked respondents to mark where they placed the heart reflex point on the template .
results the survey has shown that reflexologists beliefs and practises mirror the inconsistencies in the reflexology teaching literature , with almost a third of the respondents expressing concerns about treating cardiac patients and over half stating that they would limit or modify the treatment as a result .
furthermore , a signficant number of respondents demonstrated a marked level of inconsistency in heart reflex point placement on the foot template .
conclusion the survey findings demonstrate a lack of professional consistency and clarity regarding the suitability of reflexology for cardiac patients , marked inconsistencies in the heart reflex point placement and inconsistency in reflexologists treatment decisions for perceived heart imbalances .

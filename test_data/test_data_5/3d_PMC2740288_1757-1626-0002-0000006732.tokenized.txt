introduction epidural bleeding as a complication of catheterization or epidural catheter removal is often associated with perioperative thromboprophylaxis especially in adult reconstructive surgery .
case presentation we report on a case of a 19 years old male athlete that underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction , receiving low molecular weight heparin for thromboprophylaxis and developed an epidural hematoma and subsequent cauda equina syndrome two days after removal of the epidural catheter .
an urgent magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed an epidural hematoma from the level of l3 to l4 .
emergent decompression and hematoma evacuation resulted in patient 's significant neurological improvement immediately postoperatively .
conclusion a high index of clinical suspicion and surgical intervention are necessary to prevent such potentially disabling complications especially after procedures on a day - case basis and early patient 's discharge .
this article is available from : http :// casesjournal.com / casesjournal / article / view / 6732 introduction spinal epidural haematoma formation as a consequence of epidural catheterization is a rare ( e.g. between 1:150000 and 1:190000 ) but devastating complication [ 1 ] and may lead to permanent paraplegia if hematoma evacuation is not performed early after symptom onset [ 2 ] .
we report on a case of a young male athlete that underwent acl reconstruction , receiving lmwh for thromboprophylaxis and developed an epidural hematoma and subsequent cauda equina syndrome two days after removal of the epidural catheter .
case presentation a 19 years old caucasian male ( soccer player ) presented with an anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) rupture of his right knee two months ago .
he was admitted in our department for an arthroscopic acl reconstruction .
his medical history was unremarkable ( young athlete ) and he reported no medication intake .
preoperative examination did not reveal any disorders and the values of pt ( prothrombin time ) , aptt ( activated partial thromboplastin time ) , inr and platelet count were normal .
an epidural catheter was inserted prior to the operation to provide analgesia postoperatively .
its insertion was quick and easy without any complications as described by the anesthesiologists in charge .
the operation was completed uneventfully ( 75 minutes ) , regarding both intraoperative anesthesia and the surgery ( hamstrings autografts , endobutton cl , smith & nephew , memphis , tennessee , usa ) and the patient was transferred to the recovery room ( figure 1 ) .
during his staying in the recovery room ( approximately one hour ) , he remained hemodynamically stable without any complaints , regaining gradually his muscle strength and sensitivity , and then was transferred to the ward .
anticoagulative treatment started six hour after the end of the operation as in all patients with reconstructive knee surgery and consisted of administration of low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) ( tinzaparine sodium 4500 - anti - factor xa iu once daily ) .
blood loss was not significant and the drain was removed the first postoperative day .
analgesia was provided through the epidural catheter for 48 hours and mobilization started the second postoperative day .
the epidural catheter was removed the second postoperative day , 12 hours after the administration of the anticoagulative injection and 12 hours before the next dose , and the patient was placed on oral analgesics when it was needed .
the day of surgery and the first postoperative day he reported a minor loss of sensitivity and numbness in both lower extremities which improved till the second postoperative day .
at this point , neurological status was normal and mobilization ( walking with canes with the knee in an extension brace ) continued without any adverse events .
the third postoperative day , after the regular morning visit , the patient was discharged being able to ambulate independently without any aid .
on the afternoon , he reported moderate loss of sensitivity , perianal and perigenital numbness and muscle weakness in his lower extremities , and low back pain , which improved after the administration of one dose of 500 mg of paracetamol .
the fourth postoperative day the patient reported muscle weakness in all muscles of his lower extremities and deteriorating loss of sensitivity ( from level l1 to s5 ) which made his mobilization difficult .
he was admitted again in our department ; neurologic evaluation revealed at this point muscle weakness in all muscle groups of the lower extremities .
according to british medical research council ( mrc ) scale ( medical research council ) [ 3 ] muscle strength was rated as 3 for iliopsoas , 3 for quadriceps , 3 for hamstrings , 3 for anterior and 3 for the posterior tibial muscles .
the patient remained hospitalized , his neurological status worsened rather than improving and the fifth postoperative day , a dose of iv cortisone was administered ( 30 mg / kg mps ) .
an epidural hematoma was suspected and the administration of low molecular weight heparin ceased ; an urgent mri scan was ordered which revealed an epidural hematoma from the level of l3 to l4 ( figure 2 ) .
prothrombin time ( pt ) , activated partial thromoblastin time ( aptt ) and inr continued to be normal .
immediately , the patient was prepared emergently for the operating room ( fifth postoperative day ) .
it is worth mentioning that during patient 's preparation in the operating room , just prior to the administration of anaesthesia , a new clinical evaluation showed again worsening of the muscle weakness .
in more details , muscle strength was rated as 2 according to mrc scale in all muscle groups : 2 ( iliopsoas , quadriceps , hamstrings ) or 2 ( anterior and posterior tibial muscles ) .
the patient had also lost control of the sphincters , was almost paraplegic , unable even to move legs in bed with significant loss of sensation all over his lower extremities and in perianal and genitary region ( cauda equine establishment ) .

mri scans show the epidural hematoma at the level of l3 - l4 .
consequently , an emergent decompression through right fenestration at the level of the hematoma was performed ( l3 and l4 vertebrae ) without disturbing the facets and the vertebral canal was explored .
an extensive clot , which was compressing the dura and its contents had been formed .
the hematoma was meticulously evacuated .
no bleeding vessels were identified .
the wound was closed without fusion of the spine .
a bolus dose of methylo - prednizolone ( 1000 mgr of solumedrol in one hour ) was administered to the patient in the recovery room .
in the ward , the patient presented significant improvement ; he could mobilize his legs without pain and his loss of sensation and numbness were improving continuously .
he remained in bed for two days and he was regularly evaluated neurologically .
the first day after decompression the patient showed significant neurological improvement with increased muscle strength .
improvement continued and at day 2 post - decompression the patient could move his legs freely in bed and consequently was mobilized .
at day 3 postoperatively he could stand alone and make a few steps with a walker without any complaints ; his recovery was complete .
it is worth mentioning that genitary loss of sensation was the last to disappear .
according to mrc scale at day 3 muscle strength was rated as normal for all muscle groups of both lower extremities .
the patient was discharged from hospital at day 5 post - fenestration and was re - evaluated 1 week later ( day 12 after fenestration ) .
he presented without any neurologic deficit at all and range of motion at the operated right knee ranged from complete extension to 100 degrees of flexion .
at 2 months after acl reconstruction the patient presented with complete muscle strength , and his knee motion ranged from complete extension to 120 degrees of flexion .
mri scan two months post - op demonstrated complete absorption of the haematoma ( figure 3 ) .

discussion minimal self - limited bleeding in the epidural space may occur in 2.8 - 11.5 % of cases during uncomplicated epidural needle puncture or catheter insertion [ 4 - 7 ] .
however , such bleeding may lead to the formation of a compressive epidural haematoma when either a clotting abnormality ( spontaneous or drug - induced ) exists and / or or difficulty in needle or catheter placement is reported [ 5 ] .
risk factors were first described by vandermeulen et al .
[ 8 ] including advanced age , female gender , orthopaedic patients , renal insufficiency , ankylosing spondylitis , use of anticoagulants and coagulopathy , difficult catheter insertion and catheter removal .
epidural venous plexi have been suggested as the source of haemorrhage , as epidural veins are more susceptible to rupture after activities that transiently raise venous pressure such as mild exercise , coughing , straining , or other vasalva manoeuvres [ 9 ] .
case series from the last few years indicate that spinal epidural haematoma is more common than previously estimated , with a prevalence from 1:100000 in obstetric patients to as high as 1:3600 in female orthopaedic patients [ 6,10 ] .
epidural bleeding as a complication of catheterization is often associated with the use of perioperative thromboprophylaxis [ 5,8,10 - 16 ] .
guidelines regarding safe time intervals for epidural catheterization and catheter removal , adopted by many countries , do exist ; however they are not evidence based and rely mainly on published reports regarding relevant risks and on drugs pharmacokinetics [ 12,13 ] .
lmwh administration to prevent deep vein thrombosis has been implicated in the usa for the high - incidence of bleeding after central neural blockade , since the introduction of enoxaparin use in 1993 .
however similar complication rates in europe were not observed probably due to the different dosage regimes used in the two continents [ 17 ] .
as the plasma half - life of lmwh is 4 - 6 h , 10 - 12 h is now the recommended safe time interval following lmwh prophylaxis for placement of a central neuraxis or removal of an epidural catheter [ 5 ] .
although standard dose lmwhs are associated with a predictable anticoagulant effect considering that the anti - xa activity after a single bolus of 40 mg enoxaparine for example has nearly returned to baseline after 12 h in patients with normal renal function [ 18 ] , the risk of unexpected bleeding cannot be excluded [ 12,19 ] .
it is important to mention that despite existing awareness in a review of 613 cases with spinal haematoma , no clear aetiologic factors were confirmed in about 1 / 3 of patients [ 19 ] .
our patient , a 19 years old young athlete , with a free past medical history , no indication of coagulopathy , normal renal and liver function , no spinal pathology who underwent a typical epidural catheterization and received standard dose lmwh postoperatively was exactly the patient where this rare complication would be more than unexpected .
furthermore , the epidural catheter was removed 12 hours after last dose of lmwh and 12 hours before the next dose was administered .
initially the patient mobilized uneventfully and experienced symptoms of low - back pain , bladder incontinence and sensory and motor dysfunction , worsening in severity two days later .
a published case of , similarly to ours , late presentation of epidural bleeding [ 16 ] , 6 days after catheter removal in an 82 - years old patient receiving high dose ( 0.8 mg / kg twice daily ) enoxaparin , was attributed to his altered coagulation status .
in two recent reports [ 11,15 ] of epidural bleeding after catheterization in three orthopaedic patients , the complication was a consequence of a ) preoperative anticoagulant therapy ( long - standing dipyridamole [ 15 ] and warfarin [ 11 ] treatment ) in patients undergoing tka , or b ) difficult ( multiple punctures ) catheterization [ 15 ] .
in the currently presented case however , no clear risk factors were present , apart from orthopaedic surgical intervention and the use of lmwh .
haematoma formation was attributed to an arterial or venous injury in the vertebral canal , during removal of the catheter , which could not be foreseen .
thromboprophylaxis possibly played a significant role in maintaining bleeding leading gradually to spinal cord compression .
to our knowledge , no other case of epidural bleeding in young athletes undergoing an acl reconstruction has ever been presented .
surgical intervention and haematoma evacuation has been associated with better outcome [ 2 ] .
in such a case early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for avoidance of permanent neurologic deficits .
high index of suspicion with careful and repeated clinical examination is necessary to evaluate the patient 's symptoms , especially if there is gradual worsening , whereas magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred imaging modality that confirms compression in the vertebral canal [ 20 ] .
in our case , immediate postoperative improvement was evident and complete neurological recovery occurred within a week .
the treating surgeon should be however aware of the fact that complete neurological recovery is not always the outcome despite early surgical intervention [ 2 ] .
conclusion the current report focuses on the relevant rarity of the presented complication , pointing however on the importance of early clinical suspicion and surgical intervention to maximize the possibility of avoiding permanent patient 's disability .
although several risk factors have been proposed , the possibility of occurrence in young athletic individuals undergoing sports medicine related reconstructive procedures cannot be excluded .
furthermore , dealing with acl reconstruction procedures on a day - case basis and early patient 's discharge , which is common practice after these procedures , might lead to negligence in diagnosing similar conditions .
close follow - up is thus essential .

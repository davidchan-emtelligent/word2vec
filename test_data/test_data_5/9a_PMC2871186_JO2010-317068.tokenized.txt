the tgf - beta pathway controls a broad range of cellular behavior including cell proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis of various cell types including tumor cells , endothelial cells , immune cells , and fibroblasts .
besides tgf - beta 's direct effects on tumor growth and its involvement in neoangiogenesis have received recent attention .
germline mutations in tgf - beta receptors or coreceptors causing hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia and the loeys - dietz syndrome underline the involvement of tgf - beta in vessel formation and maturation .
several therapeutic approaches are evaluated at present targeting the tgf - beta pathway including utilization of antisense oligonucleotides against tgf - beta itself or antibodies or small molecule inhibitors of tgf - beta receptors .
some of these therapeutic agents have already entered the clinical arena including an antibody against the endothelium specific tgf - beta class i receptor alk - 1 targeting tumor vasculature .
in conclusion , therapeutic manipulation of the tgf - beta pathway opens great opportunities in future cancer therapy .
1. tgf - beta pathway the tgf - beta superfamily consists of over 30 structurally related multifunctional proteins , including three tgf - beta isoforms ( tgf - beta1 , 2 , and 3 ) , three forms of activin , and over 20 bone morphogenic proteins ( bmps ) , which control a broad range of cellular behavior such as cell growth , differentiation and apoptosis in various cell types including tumor , immune , and endothelial cells as well as fibroblasts [ 1 - 5 ] .
ligand signaling is mediated through two related single transmembrane type i and type ii receptors , which together comprise the only known family of serine / threonine kinases [ 6 - 8 ] .
in mammals , there are five different type ii ( tgfbr2 , actr - iia , actr - iib , bmpr2 , amhrii ) and seven type i receptors , also named activin receptor - like kinases ( alk - 1 - 7 ) [ 7 , 9 ] .
in most cases , the receptor combination is important for the binding of a specific ligand , but the tgf - beta family members often bind to more than one type ii and type i receptor combination [ 10 ] .
upon ligand binding , the type i and type ii receptors form a heteromeric complex , presumably consisting of two type i and two type ii receptors .
the type ii receptor exhibits a constitutively active kinase which transphosphorylates and activates the type i receptor in a glycine - and serine - rich region known as gs - box [ 11 ] .
the activated type i receptor propagates the downstream signaling by phosphorylating specific receptor - regulated smad proteins ( r - smad ) [ 12 , 13 ] .
r - smads interact with smad - 4 , the only known common mediator smad ( cosmad ) in mammals , and form heteromeric complexes which translocate to the nucleus where they influence gene expression ( by binding to the dna and acting as transcription factors , coactivators , and corepressors ) [ 14 - 17 ] .
the tgf - beta pathway has several feedback mechanisms , which regulate the duration of the signaling .
one of the feedback mechanisms is mediated by inhibitory smads ( i - smad ) , in humans smad - 6 and smad - 7 , which compete with the r - smads for binding to the type i receptor , but without the ability to transduce the downstream signal .
i - smads also recruit the e3 ubiquitin ligases smad ubiquitin related factor - 1 and - 2 ( smurf - 1 and - 2 ) , which ubiquitinate the smads and type i receptors , resulting in protein degradation [ 18 - 23 ] .
in humans , two accessory tgf - beta superfamily receptors have been described which have a more indirect role in tgf - beta signaling : betaglycan and endoglin .
the later is mainly expressed in endothelial cells [ 24 - 26 ] .
these type iii receptors are structurally related transmembrane receptors with short intracellular domains that lack any enzymatic motif but contain many serine and threonine residues .
they facilitate the binding of ligand to the type i and type ii receptors [ 27 ] .
a soluble form of endoglin has been described , most likely generated by proteolytic shedding , that antagonizes the membrane bound form [ 28 ] .
the components of the tgf - beta pathway are shown schematically in figure 1 .
2. tgf - beta signaling in cancer 2.1 .
hereditary cancer syndromes several hereditary cancer syndromes with mutations in tgf - beta superfamily members are known .
the autosomal dominant familial juvenile polyposis syndrome ( jps ) is the most common of the hamartomatous syndromes which occurs with an incidence of about one per 100.000 births [ 29 ] .
patients develop numerous polyps not only in the colon or rectum but also in the proximal gastrointestinal tract .
although most juvenile polyps are benign , malignant transformation occurs with a lifetime risk of colorectal carcinoma of approximately 70 % .
in addition , the risk of pancreatic , gastric , and duodenal carcinoma is increased [ 29 ] .
germline mutations in different members of the tgf - beta superfamily have been described in jps .
in every fourth patient a mutation in the type i receptor alk - 3 ( bmpr1a ) is found [ 30 ] .
in 15 % of cases smad - 4 is mutated [ 30 ] .
furthermore , mutations in the endoglin gene have been described , but the incidence is unknown [ 31 ] .
hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( hnpcc ) is the most common hereditary predisposition for the development of colorectal cancer .
hnpcc results from germline mutations within genes involved in the dna mismatch repair system , leading to microsatellite instability .
since the tgfbr2 gene contains a 10 - base pair polyadenine repeat microsatellite sequence , it is an apparent target for inactivation caused by errors of the dna mismatch repair .
indeed , a mutated form of tgfbr2 can be observed in up to 80 % of colon cancer patients with hnpcc [ 32 , 33 ] .
the autosomal cancer syndrome cowden syndrome ( cs ) and bannayan - riley - ruvalcaba ( brr ) disease are normally associated with a phosphatase and tensin homolog ( pten ) gene mutation .
however , in one patient with cs and brr symptoms but without pten mutation an alk - 3 mutation was found [ 34 ] .
2.2 .
dysregulated expression in cancer patients for several pathologies , especially cancer , a correlation between the expression level of a tgf - beta superfamily member and the severity of the related disease has been identified , which makes the concerning tgf - beta family member a diagnostic , prognostic , or predictive marker .
2.2.1 .
transforming growth factors in 1986 , nishimura et al. detected elevated tgf - beta levels in the urine of patients suffering from advanced cancer stages compared to healthy donors [ 35 ] .
since then , increased serum levels of tgf - beta1 have been implicated as a prognostic marker of advanced disease and poor prognosis in multiple cancer types such as gastric carcinoma , colorectal cancer , bladder carcinoma , prostate cancer , breast cancer , lung cancer , esophageal adenocarcinoma , and melanoma [ 36 - 44 ] .
but nevertheless tgf - beta levels are not yet used as tumor markers in clinical routine .
2.2.2 .
bone morphogenic proteins bone morphogenic proteins can also serve as prognostic markers , since the bmp - 7 expression is increased in malignant melanomas and their metastases , which correlates with a shorter time to tumor recurrence [ 45 ] .
furthermore , high bmp - 6 levels predicted development of distant metastasis in primary prostate cancer [ 46 ] .
on the other hand , the mrna level of bmp - 2 was significantly decreased in breast cancer tumors compared to normal breast tissue [ 47 ] .
2.2.3 .
tgf - beta receptors the expression of tgf - beta superfamily receptors within tumor cells can be a prognostic marker .
reduced alk - 5 and tgfbr2 expression correlates with a shorter survival rate of colon cancer patients , as does reduced expression of the coreceptor betaglycan in breast and prostate cancer patients [ 48 - 50 ] .
low expression levels of tgfbr2 have been observed in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia [ 51 ] .
in addition , mutations in alk - 5 and tgfbr2 have been described for other haematological malignancies , but it seems to be a rare event [ 52 , 53 ] .
a significant association between loss of bmpr2 expression and tumor grade was found in bladder transitional cell carcinoma [ 54 ] .
in contrast , high expression of type iii coreceptor endoglin was mainly detected on immature blood vessels in prostate tumors and had a negative impact on patient 's survival as well as with response rates in breast cancer or cervical cancer [ 55 - 58 ] .
calabro et al. detected elevated levels of soluble endoglin that correlated with low tgf - beta1 levels in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myeloproliferative disorders [ 59 ] .
however none of these markers is used in routine clinical practice .
3. tgf - beta signaling in endothelial cells several members of the tgf - beta superfamily are expressed in endothelial cells and play an important role in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis .
the targeted inactivation of tgf - beta signaling components in mice revealed the pathway 's crucial role in vascular morphogenesis .
for example , animals lacking tgf - beta1 , alk - 5 , alk - 1 , endoglin , or various smad proteins die at midgestation during embryogenesis due to defects in vascular development of the yolk sac [ 10 , 60 - 62 ] .
in humans , the hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia ( hht , also named rendu - osler - weber syndrome ) is an autosomal dominant disease in which vascular dysplasia results in teleangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations .
two forms with different clinical characteristics have been described : hht type 1 patients have a mutation in the endoglin gene whereas hht type 2 is characterized by a mutation in the alk - 1 gene .
together these mutations account for about 80 % of all hht patients [ 6 , 63 - 65 ] .
in 2005 , another autosomal dominant syndrome with mutations in tgf - beta receptors was described : the loeys - dietz syndrome .
patients have a very high risk for aortic dissection or rupture .
analysis of 52 families with a history of loeys - dietz syndrome revealed somatic mutations either in the type i receptor alk - 5 or in the type ii receptor tgfbr2 [ 66 , 67 ] .
3.1 .
functional aspects of tgf - beta signaling in endothelial cells in endothelial cells the type i tgf - beta receptors , which have been investigated most thoroughly , are ubiquitously expressed alk - 5 and endothel - specific alk - 1 .
previously , it was believed that alk - 5 and alk - 1 had opposite roles in angiogenesis and might balance the activation state of endothelium .
several investigators observed increased proliferation and migration when the tgf - beta / alk - 1 pathway had been stimulated whereas stimulation of the tgf - beta / alk - 5 pathway led to inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration [ 68 , 69 ] .
this opposing effect was thought to be mediated by activation of smad - 1 / 5 / 8 by alk - 1 and smad - 2 / 3 by alk - 5 [ 68 ] .
due to activation of different intracellular pathways , specific changes in gene transcription can be observed .
goumans et al. revealed that the inhibitor of dna binding 1 ( id - 1 ) , a helix - loop - helix ( hlh ) protein that can form heterodimers with members of the basic hlh family of transcription factors , is a specific downstream signal of alk - 1 , whereas the proteinase inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 ( pai - 1 ) is induced by alk - 5 activation [ 68 ] .
more recently published data might alter the presumed relationship between alk - 1 and alk - 5 .
david et al. showed that not tgf - beta1 but the bone morphogenic proteins 9 and 10 are likely to be the physiological ligands for alk - 1 .
binding of bmp - 9 to the alk - 1 and bmpr2 complex potently inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and migration [ 70 ] .
the increase of angiogenesis in ecs upon alk - 1 activation in former studies was due to tgf - beta1 binding to the alk - 1 / tgfbr2 complex .
thus , the role of alk - 1 is dependant of type ii receptor expression and ligand availability .
interestingly , both pathways signal via activation of smad - 1 , - 5 , and - 8 although these smads have been described as characteristic bmp downstream signals [ 71 ] .
hence , additional elements must be involved in regulation of the alk - 1 pathway driving it either to the pro or antiangiogenic direction .
indeed , cross - talk between the tgf - beta pathway with other pathways such as the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) , the phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( pi3k ) or the hedgehog pathways have been described [ 72 ] .
very recently , a possible explanation for the requisite role of alk - 1 and alk - 5 in angiogenesis has been described .
shao et al. demonstrated that alk - 1 and alk - 5 are both essential for the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , which is believed to be the central growth factor in angiogenesis .
tgf - beta1 / alk - 5 stimulation elevated the m - rna levels of vegf in bovine aortic ecs , whereas bmp - 9 / alk - 1 stimulation led to decreased vegf m - rna levels .
proliferation and migration assays were in line with these observations [ 73 ] .
a remaining question is the interdependence between alk - 1 and alk - 5 .
whereas goumans et al. proposed that alk - 5 mediates a tgf - beta - dependent recruitment of alk - 1 into the receptor complex and that alk - 5 kinase activity is essential for optimal alk - 1 activity [ 68 ] .
shao et al. observed opposite effects .
they found some hints that alk - 1 acts independently of alk - 5 but that alk - 5 might actually be dependent of alk - 1 [ 73 ] .
hence , interdependence between alk - 1 and alk - 5 seems to be apparent , yet it has to be clarified which of the receptors is the leading force .
4. tgf - beta receptor expression in leukemia since endothelial and hematopoietic cells have a common stem cell , the so - called hemangioblast , many immature hematopoietic cells share cell surface receptors with endothelial cells , such as receptors for hematopoieitc growth factors , for example , gm - csf or erythropoietin [ 74 , 75 ] .
our group investigated expression of alk - 1 and alk - 5 in various leukemic cells lines and samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) .
we found that both receptors are expressed in most cases implying that both alk - 1 and alk - 5 are involved in autocrine or paracrine growth stimulation in aml ( manuscript in preparation ) .
in a recent study , an association between high id - 1 expression and poor prognosis in patients with aml has been described .
id - 1 is the typical downstream mediator of alk - 1 signaling although enhancement of id - 1 expression by other tryrosine kinase receptors such as flt3 cannot be excluded in a subgroup of patients [ 76 ] .
however , data about dysregulated tgf - beta signaling in hematologic malignancies are rare , since only few reports in lymphoid neoplasms or myeloid leukemia have been published [ 52 , 53 , 77 , 78 ] .
5. tgf - beta signaling pathway as a therapeutic target because of the enormous number of observed alterations in the tgf - beta pathway in cancer patients , the development of therapeutic substances seems to be evident .
in fact , there are different reasons why the inhibition of the tgf - beta pathway might be a promising target for anticancer therapies .
first , the direct effect on tumor cells has to be stressed .
secondly , as described above , the tgf - beta pathway plays an important role in endothelial cell behavior and therefore in angiogenesis .
antiangiogenic therapies belong to the most promising therapeutic concepts which are currently under development .
thirdly , tgf - beta is one of the most potent naturally immunosuppressors [ 79 , 80 ] .
mice deficient for tgf - beta1 develop a harmful syndrome with multifocal , mixed inflammatory cell response , and tissue necrosis , leading to organ failure and death [ 4 ] .
furthermore , suppression of tgf - beta signaling in t cells by transduction with a truncated tgfbr2 resulted in severe autoimmune reactions [ 81 ] .
the immune response of cancer patients is often suppressed , since many advanced tumors overexpress tgf - beta resulting in inhibition of il - 2 - dependant proliferation and differentiation of nk and t cells [ 82 , 83 ] .
in addition , tgf - beta recruits different immune cells to the tumor microenvironment : monocytes and macrophages promote tumor invasion , angiogenesis and metastasis whereas mast cells secrete numerous tumor promoting factors [ 83 ] .
figure 2 summarizes the main tumor promoting effects of dysregulated tgf - beta signaling .
targeting the tgf - beta pathway should therefore not only affect the tumor cells by itself ; moreover a decreased tumor vascularization and strengthening the patient 's immune responses should be achieved .
numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have been performed , accounting for these different strategies to inhibit tumor growth and to target various components within the tgf - beta pathway including ligands , receptors and even downstream signals .
some of these studies passed the preclinical phase with success and phase i and ii clinical studies have been started .
table 1 gives a short overview of preclinical and clinical studies using agents targeted at tgf - beta family members .
representing the central factor of the pathway , tgf - beta is the preferred target structure in most cases .
for example , yang et al. developed transgenic mice expressing a tgf - beta antagonist consisting of a soluble tgf - beta type ii receptor fused with the fc domain of a human igg1 .
the number of metastases was reduced both in a tail vein metastasis assay with melanoma cells and in crosses with a transgenic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer [ 101 ] .
a neutralizing pan - tgf - beta antibody prevented radiation - induced acceleration of metastatic cancer progression in a transgenic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer [ 102 ] .
the pan - tgf - beta antibody gc - 1008 was tested in a phase i clinical study with 22 patients with renal cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma ( nct00356460 ) .
treatment was well tolerated with mainly grade 1 - 2 toxicity including skin rash , fatigue , headache and gastrointestinal symptoms .
5 patients achieved stable disease or better and one patient with skin disease achieved a partial response with > 75 % reduction of target lesions [ 84 ] .
several studies concentrated on the restoration of immune responses .
in a prostate cancer xenograft model a reduction in tumor weight was observed after implantation of tumor - reactive cd8 + t cells which were tgf - beta insensitive due to introduction of a dominant - negative tgf - beta type ii receptor vector [ 103 ] .
yamamoto et al. utilized direct hemoperfusion treatment with specific immunosuppressive substance adsorption columns for tgf - beta ablation in rats bearing a tgf - beta - producing hepatocellular carcinoma .
tgf - beta serum levels were decreased after hemoperfusion treatment leading to restored t lymphocyte response , decelerated tumor growth and longer survival times [ 104 ] .
fujita et al. observed similar results using plasmid dna encoding the extracellular domain of the tgf - beta type ii receptor fused to the human igg heavy chain ; after plasmid injection in the proximity of established murine lymphomas an increased number of tumor antigen - specific cd4 + and cd8 + cells could be detected in tumor - draining lymph nodes [ 105 ] .
another promising approach which has entered clinical phase i and ii trials is to inhibit tgf - beta function by means of antisense oligonucleotides ( as - odns ) .
in a preclinical trial , local intracranial administration of tgf - beta2 as - odns was combined with systemic tumor vaccine in a rat glioma model .
only the combination of both substances led to a significantly prolonged survival [ 106 ] .
increased survival of glioma patients who had received whole - cell vaccines comprising autologous tumor cells genetically modified by a tgf - beta2 antisense vector was observed in a phase i study [ 107 ] .
a phase ii trial with belagenpumatucel - l , a tgf - beta2 antisense gene - modified allogeneic tumor vaccine , is ongoing in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer ( nct01058785 ) [ 87 ] .
the antitumorigenic effect of antisense oligonucleotides was supported by phase ii trials with the tgf - beta2 inhibitor ap12009 .
in comparison to standard chemotherapy , treatment with ap12009 resulted in prolonged survival of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma [ 85 ] .
consistently , patients with high - grade glioma achieved a higher survival rate at 24 months and showed significantly more responders after 14 months when ap12009 treatment was compared to standard chemotherapy protocols [ 86 ] .
therapeutic concepts against tgf - beta receptors were almost exclusively targeted at alk - 5 , in most cases using small molecule inhibitors such as sb431542 which showed similar results in several in vitro and in vivo studies .
sb431542 caused inhibition of proliferation , tgf - beta - mediated morphognic changes , and cellular motility of glioma cells in vitro .
this effect was due to blocked phosphorylation of smads leading to reduced transcription of pai - 1 and vegf which are key mediators in cell invasion and neoangiogenesis [ 95 ] .
javelaud and collegues analyzed the role of tgf - beta in murine melanoma metastasis to bone .
both the therapy with sb431542 as well as tumors transduced with the inhibitory protein smad - 7 , showed significantly less osteolyses , longer survival and lower expression levels of osteolytic factors such as parathyroid hormone - related protein and interleukin - 11 [ 96 ] .
another alk - 5 small molecule inhibitor , sd208 , led to decreased tumor growth and metastasis in a murine mamma carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma model .
furthermore , antiangiogenic effects could be observed in both studies with a reduced microvessel density and altered expression levels of angiogenesis - related factors like flt - 1 , neuropillin - 2 and vegf - c , respectively [ 97 , 98 ] .
in addition , treatment of cd34 + cells isolated from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome with sd208 led to in vitro enhancement of hematopoiesis [ 78 ] .
furthermore in a malignant mesothelioma mouse model , the alk - 5 inhibitor sm16 significantly decreased tumor growth which could be ascribed to a cd8 + antitumor response [ 99 ] .
the substance ly2109761 inhibits both tgf - beta type i and type ii receptors [ 88 ] .
an orthotopic murine model of metastatic pancreatic cancer and a liver metastasis model proved the efficacy of ly2109761 , since tumor growth and spontaneous metastases were reduced whereas the animals' survival was prolonged [ 89 ] .
similar effects were observed in an experimental colorectal cancer mouse model [ 90 ] .
gianelli 's group performed several studies with ly2109761 in hepatocellular carcinoma .
tumor progression was delayed due to inhibition of vascular invasion as well as disturbance of cross - talk between hepatocellular carcinoma cells and stroma or endothelial cells .
in a xenograft chick embryo model , ly210976 treatment caused even enhanced inhibition of tumor growth and reduced microvessel density compared to bevacizumab - treated animals .
however , the strongest antitumoral effect was observed when combining both substances [ 91 - 93 ] .
myelo - monocytic leukemic cells cocultured with bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were stimulated with tgf - beta1 which led to inhibition of spontaneous and cytarabine - induced apoptosis .
this prosurvival signaling was neutralized with ly2109761 [ 94 ] .
although no in vitro data about specific alk - 1 inhibitors have been published so far , a clinical phase i study testing a human antialk - 1 antibody in patients with advanced solid tumors is ongoing ( nct00557856 ) .
since its expression is restricted to endothelial cells with higher expression levels in tumor - associated endothelium compared to normal tissue , the accessory receptor endoglin may represent a promising target for anticancer therapy [ 108 ] .
antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic effects could be observed in several in vivo tumor models using antiendoglin antibodies [ 109 - 112 ] .
for example , uneda et al. used multiple metastasis models with murine mamma carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma cells to test the effect of several antiendoglin antibodies targeted at different endoglin epitopes .
under treatment , metastases were suppressed and microvessel density was effectively reduced as measured by matrigel plug assay [ 109 , 113 ] : a phase i clinical trial with the human / murine chimeric antiendoglin monoclonal antibody trc105 in 19 patients with solid cancer .
treatment was well tolerated with mainly grade 1 - 2 toxicity including fatigue , anemia , proteinuria and diarrhea .
one patient with hormone refractory prostate cancer obtained a complete psa response and 3 patients had prolonged stable disease ( nct00582985 ) [ 100 ] .
6. outlook the results of numerous in vitro studies with cell lines , in vivo mouse models and clinical trials show that the tgf - beta pathway plays an important role in cancer progression and represents a promising target for anticancer therapy .
targeting tgf - beta isoforms , tgf - beta receptors as well as downstream signaling proteins yielded satisfactory results , since a reduction in tumor load was observed in most cases .
manipulating tgf - beta signaling implies the great advantage of affecting at least three important structures in tumor progression : in addition to the direct antitumor effect , endothelial and immune cells will be targeted .
although restoration of the immune system is a desirable achievement in cancer therapy , the complete inhibition of tgf - beta1 might have fatal consequences .
for example , tgf - beta1 deficient mice develop a lethal syndrome accompanied by a multifocal , mixed inflammatory cell response and tissue necrosis , leading to organ failure [ 4 ] .
furthermore , abrogation of tgf - beta signaling in t cells by introduction of a truncated tgfbr2 results in severe autoimmune reactions [ 81 ] .
in addition , tgf - beta1 plays an important role in fibroblast biology , since it is a relevant growth factor for extracellular matrix formation in fibroblasts due to its stimulation of collagen , fibronectin and proteoglycan synthesis [ 114 ] .
due to tgf - beta signaling , fibroblasts suppress the activation of tumor - promoting paracrine signaling which would target epithelial cells and could lead to epithelial to mesenchymal transition [ 115 ] .
bhowmick et al. inactivated the tgfbr2 gene in mouse fibroblasts which resulted in intraepithelial neoplasia in prostate and invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the forestomach [ 115 ] .
coimplantation of tgfbr2 - deficient mammary fibroblasts with mammary carcinoma cells promoted tumor growth and invasion as compared to wild - type fibroblasts [ 116 ] .
these examples reveal the great difficulty in targeting the tgf - beta pathway .
perhaps targeting the type i receptor alk - 1 or the accessory receptor endoglin might represent a solution to this discrepancy since expression of both receptors seems to be restricted to endothelial cells which could limit side effects .
therefore , results of phase i studies are awaited where patients with advanced solid tumors will be treated with an alk - 1 or an endoglin antibody ( nct00557856 and nct00582985 , resp. ) .
these studies might resolve this question .
integrating all results underlines the complexity in tgf - beta signaling in endothelial cells .
in some extent , this may be due to different experimental settings since tgf - beta superfamily members have often been overexpressed or downregulated in in vitro models using plasmid vectors .
furthermore , although discussed as important alk - 1 ligand in the regulation of angiogenesis , no physiological data about bmp - 9 or bmp - 10 expression in endothelial or tumor cells exist .
7. conclusion we conclude that the tgf - beta pathway might be a promising therapeutic target in anticancer therapy due to its involvement in several mechanisms including endothelial and immune cell biology that are most important for tumor progression .
on the other hand , since the tgf - beta pathway affects a broad range of cellular behavior , it is an ambitious approach to restore the delicate balance of physiological signaling .
therefore manipulation of the pathway bears the risk of adverse effects and of therapeutic success .
comprehensive investigations that comprise the interactions between tumor cells , fibroblasts , endothelial and immune cells are indispensable .

upon ligand binding the constitutively active kinase of the type ii receptor transphosphorylates and activates the type i receptor .
type iii receptors lack any kinase activity but they act as accessory receptors and facilitate ligand binding to the type i and ii receptors .
downstream signaling is mediated via r - smads which are phosphorylated by the activated type i receptor and form a complex with cosmads .
this complex translocates to the nucleus where it induces transcription of downstream signaling .
i - smad proteins represent important negative feedback structures , since they can block the signaling via competitive binding to the type i receptors or r - smads .
r - smad : receptor - regulated smad ; cosmad : common mediator smad ; i - smad : inhibitory smad ; tf : transcription factor .
figure 2 dysregulation of the tgf - beta pathway promotes tumor growth .
an unbalanced tgf - beta pathway can cause advanced tumorigenesis due to several cellular changes .
on the one hand , the dysregulation has a direct effect on tumor cells leading to elevated tumor cell proliferation .
secondly , endothelial cells are affected which results in increased angiogenesis and therefore in tumor vascularization .
finally immune responses are attenuated due to inhibition of t cell proliferation and migration caused by dysregulated tgf - beta signaling .

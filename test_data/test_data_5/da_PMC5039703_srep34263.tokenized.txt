calcification in the surface ocean decreases the buffering capacity of seawater for co2 , whilst photosynthetic carbon fixation has the opposite effect .
experiments in culture have suggested that coccolithophore calcification decreases under high co2 concentrations ([ co2 ( aq )]) constituting a negative feedback .
however , the extent to which these results are representative of natural populations , and of the response over more than a few hundred generations is unclear .
here we describe and apply a novel rationale for size - normalizing the mass of the calcite plates produced by the most abundant family of coccolithophores , the noelaerhabdaceae .
on average , ancient populations subjected to coupled gradual increases in [ co2 ( aq )] and temperature over a few million generations in a natural environment become relatively more highly calcified , implying a positive climatic feedback .
we hypothesize that this is the result of selection manifest in natural populations over millennial timescales , so has necessarily eluded laboratory experiments .
coccolithophores are the modern ocean 's dominant calcifying phytoplankton and coccoliths , the distinctive calcite plates that they produce , have populated the fossil record for over 200 million years12 .
biogenic calcification is an important climatic feedback34 , and in most organisms is thought to be strongly affected by changes in the carbonate chemistry of seawater .
in coccolithophores , calcite precipitation occurs inside the cell , so the site of calcite precipitation is buffered from the external environment and is subject to an unusually high degree of biological control .
the most abundant modern species of coccolithophore are emiliania huxleyi and gephyrocapsa oceanica ; bloom - forming members of the family noelaerhabdaceae ( haptophyta : coccolithophyceae : isochrysidales : noelaerhabdaceae ) .
laboratory culture experiments have shown that these two species tend to calcify less when carbon dioxide concentrations are higher567 , although the trade off between dic availability and ph appears to be critical8 .
yet these observed responses each characterize a single genome , adapted to the modern environment and exposed to artificially manipulated conditions in the laboratory in the absence of genetic change ( phenotypic plasticity ) .
in nature , communities are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous , and selective pressures lead to competition .
environments are dynamic , and changes in average conditions are subtle and prolonged .
sexual reproduction , which has never been observed in the laboratory in coccolithophores , genetically homogenizes a population within a biological species , whilst accelerating adaptation through propagation of the most beneficial combinations of alleles and removal of deleterious mutations via natural selection .
to elucidate the role of these phytoplanktonic marine calcifiers in nature across geological history , their response must be studied on timescales of tens to tens of thousands of years , within natural populations , where evolutionarily relevant processes such as meiosis and syngamy may occur910 , and where the rate and amplitude of environmental change is representative of the real world .
indeed a theoretical model has suggested that on such timescales the selective pressure of increasing [ co2 ( aq )] may have favoured the more heavily calcified forms of coccolithophore11 .
an apparent dichotomy exists between the consensus view of phenotypic plasticity as observed in short - term experiments and the theoretical result of long - term evolutionary adaptation .
however , experiments lasting hundreds of generations have shown that asexual coccolithophore populations have the potential to adapt in culture1213 and large - scale surveys have revealed trends across spatial environmental gradients in nature1415 .
the fossil record , by contrast , is an archive of information about ancient natural coccolithophore communities that responded to real environmental changes over geological timescales .
the challenge is to extract meaningful information from this resource .
isolated coccoliths in deep - sea sediment are often the only remnants of ancient coccolithophores to survive geological time , so inferences about the physiology of coccolithophores that lived in the past must come from this evidence alone .
results size - normalization of coccolith mass studies to date have yielded contradictory results regarding the response of calcification to environmental change on geological timescales1416 , but this disagreement is , at least in part , a result of the lack of consistency between the parameter measured , and how this is inferred to represent " calcification intensity " .
coccolith mass has been used extensively to infer calcification ability141516171819 , but as it is not independent of coccolith size , size - normalization is highly nontrivial and it remains a biologically abstract quantity .
in order to solve this problem , we have developed a procedure for size - normalising coccolith mass , by correlating an index based on coccolith morphometry with the molar ratio of particulate inorganic to particulate organic carbon ( pic : poc ) of the biomass .
the pic : poc ratio is a direct record of the ratio of integrated rates of calcification to photosynthesis3 , and therefore describes an energetic and carbon budget trade off between calcification and biological ( metabolic ) activity that makes more sense biologically than coccolith mass in the context of physiology and adaptation , and is independent of coccolithophore size. through size - normalising mass by consideration of a dimensionless but biologically meaningful parameter , we circumvent problems associated with allometry .
the concept for size - normalising coccolith mass is based on the following arguments : the molar pic : poc ratio of coccolithophore biomass is proportional to the ratio of spherical volumes of calcite to organic matter ( fig. 1b ) .
the square root of coccolith area () , which we use as a 1 - dimensional measure of coccolith size , is proportional to coccosphere radius ( rs ) : ( fig. 1c ) .
coccolith thickness ( tl ) is proportional to coccosphere thickness ( ts = rs - rc ) : ts ~ tl ( fig. 1d ) .
given ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) , a combination of coccolith mass and area can be related back to coccolithophore pic : poc , via cell and coccosphere dimensions , thus providing a rationale for size - normalisation of mass ( fig. 1e ) .
we tested each assumption and calibrated our mass - normalisation concept using cultured coccolithophores .
we grew two strains each of e. huxleyi and g. oceanica in artificial seawater , which was chemically altered to four different dic concentrations , at constant ph , temperature and nutrient levels , in duplicate ( see methods ) .
( i ) was established via in vivo measurement of coccosphere and cell volumes , and direct measurement of the molar pic : poc ratio of the biomass : where vs and vc are respectively the solid spherical volumes of the coccosphere and the cell , and rs and rc are respectively the radii of the coccosphere and the cell ( as labelled in fig. 1a ) .
equation 1 is shown in fig. 1b .
to generate disarticulated coccoliths , the filtered culture residue was bleached to remove organic matter whilst preserving the calcite intact , emulating the effect of decomposition .
we analyzed this synthetic coccolith - sediment using syraco20 ; an automated image analysis tool , which measures coccolith area and mass ( see methods ) .
our data support assumptions ( ii ) and ( iii ) ( fig. 1c,d respectively ) .
the relationship that we find between coccolith size and cell size agrees with the well established relationship between coccolith length and cell size in the noelaerhabdaceae21 , which is derived from fossils ( red dashed line fig. 1c ). that our strains all lie on the same line as fossil noelaerhabdaceae supports the theory that this family of coccolithophores are a continuum of forms1421 .
equation 1 can be simplified by approximating the cell and coccosphere as having the same radius ( rs ) .
the volume of organic material is then the volume of a sphere of radius , rs , and the volume of calcite in the coccosphere is that of a thin shell of thickness ts and radius rs. using assumptions ( ii ) and ( iii ) gives : where ml = coccolith mass , and al = coccolith area are the direct output from the syraco analysis , and ml / al = tl. as per ( iv ) , an ordinary least squares linear regression incorporating an estimate of the uncertainty in pic : poc based on the 1sigma prediction interval gives : where is the lateral cross - sectional aspect ratio of a coccolith ( arl ) .
equation 3 is derived from first principles , and is supported empirically .
the calibration is shown in fig. 1e .
arl is taken to be the most sensible way of size - normalising coccolith mass , which alone is biologically meaningless .
caveats associated with directly translating arl to pic : poc using eq .
3 are discussed later .
down - core experiment to explore the calcification response of natural coccolithophore populations to climatic change in the form of a down - core experiment , we used this novel approach to analyze sediment - core material from two glacial terminations , which are of contrasting magnitude ( fig. 2 ) .
the larger of these terminations sees an increase in atmospheric co2 mixing ratios ( co2atm ) similar in magnitude to that since the industrial revolution , albeit two orders of magnitude slower .
syraco analysis was performed on sediment from odp site 1123 , on chatham rise , east of new zealand in the southernmost pacific ( 41degrees47.2's , 171degrees29.9'w , 3290 m water depth ) .
depths span the penultimate and 6th most recent glacial - interglacial cycles ( mis 7 - 5 : ~ 200 - 100 ka and mis 15 - 13 : ~ 600 - 500 ka , respectively ) , and sample resolution is higher (~ 1000 year ) over the terminations ( tii : ~ 140 - 125 ka and tvi : ~ 540 - 520 ka ) .
dissolution proxies22 and sem observations of coccoliths show good preservation at this site throughout the periods of interest .
odp site 1123 exists at the northern edge of the sub tropical front ( stf ) in the southernmost pacific ocean , and may see an increased influence of sub antarctic water during glacials and subtropical water during interglacials22 .
we used in situ proxy reconstructions of sea surface temperature ( sst ) and relative nutrient concentration to infer surface ocean conditions throughout the periods of interest .
we calculated [ co2 ( aq )] from published co2atm records from ice cores ( see methods ) and from sst inferred from planktic foram mg / ca ratios ( see methods ) , assuming equilibrium between the atmosphere and surface waters .
[ co2 ( aq )] and temperature increased during each glacial termination , with no obvious change in relative nutrient concentrations ( see methods and fig. s2 ) .
ph and [ dic ] were unconstrained , but on these timescales , the decrease in ph due to invasion of co2 may be partially buffered by dissolution of carbonate sediments .
for this reason , [ co2 ( aq )] is used to describe the carbonate system , as this is the most well constrained component .
syraco analysis20 measures the mass and area of each coccolith belonging to the family noelaerhabdaceae in the analysed samples .
arl is calculated subsequently .
additionally , each coccolith is assigned to a morphotaxonomic group on the basis of shape .
these groupings approximate species - level taxonomic classifications and provide insight into subsets of the population .
here we show morphotaxon - specific records for the groups dominated by large gephyrocapsa spp. and by e. huxleyi ( mggeo and mgemi respectively ) .
these species are the most thoroughly studied in the laboratory , and their ultrastructure is suited to syraco analysis .
down - core results over tii , mean noelaerhabdaceae coccolith mass and area increase transiently across the termination .
this is accompanied by an increase in the mean - independent variance ( arithmetic coefficient of variation ; acv ) in both of these variables ( fig. 2 ) , implying a non - uniform response within the population .
specifically , the mass and area of mggeo transiently increase in parallel ( almost doubling ) over the termination , but ( mgemi ) shows a subtle decrease .
over tvi , prior to the first appearance of e. huxleyi coccoliths in the fossil record at around 290 ka23 , the absolute magnitude and acv of noelaerhabdaceae coccolith mass is very stable , though with a large decrease in acv during the mis14 glacial inception .
the absolute magnitude of coccolith area , however , peaks during mis14 glacial maximum and decreases during tvi , but with little change in the area acv .
the time series of population mean arl ( size - normalised mass ) exhibits an increase across both terminations .
this effect is paralleled but larger in the arl of mggeo , which increases by ~ 30 % across both tii and tvi. by contrast , the arl response of mgemi across tii is of a slight decrease .
the absence of e. huxleyi explains the higher population mean arl over tvi than over tii , and its presence and opposing response to g. oceanica , as inferred from the morphotaxa , explains the increased variance observed over tii .
the parameter arl reconciles the differing response of mass and area of mggeo to increasing [ co2 ( aq )] and temperature across these two terminations .
discussion the arl time series implies that coccoliths become more calcified in noelaerhabdaceae , and especially g.oceanica , with increasing [ co2 ( aq )] and temperature at site 1123 in natural populations over a timescale of thousands of years .
this increase contrasts with results from the literature that describe the capacity for phenotypic plasticity in these organisms .
in the laboratory , single strains of g. oceanica calcify relatively less with increasing [ co2 ( aq )] 56724 , and there is no discernible effect of temperature7. e. huxleyi 's plastic response to increasing co2 concentration over the reconstructed [ co2 ( aq )] range of our time series is of decreasing calcification when [ dic ] or alkalinity ( alk ) is held constant5672526 but the opposite at constant ph26 .
in e. huxleyi the plastic effect of temperature in the laboratory is large , but non - linear and poorly constrained7 .
so far , our proposed method for size - normalising coccolith mass has used the pic : poc ratio simply to justify our theoretical rationale with real biological data .
it is , however , possible to use this relationship as a proxy for pic : poc , using the coccolith aspect ratio as an input .
the predictive power of eq .
3 as a proxy for noelaerhabdaceae pic : poc is dictated by the spread of the residuals about the regression line : the prediction interval - not only by the confidence interval , which describes the uncertainty in the relationship27. with due consideration of the associated caveats , and formal consideration of uncertainty , eq .
3 can be used as a proxy to directly infer pic : poc from noelaerhabdaceae coccolith morphometry ( fig. 3 ) .
if the constant of proportionality between coccolith size and cell size is systematically influenced by the environment or differences between species , this will be reflected in the estimate of pic : poc .
in our calibration , hundreds of thousands of cells , and thousands of individual coccoliths were measured for each sample , which has the effect of averaging over the potential variation in the slope of eq .
3 due to variations in the number of coccoliths per cell , or the degree of overlap of coccoliths .
indeed , the established relationship between coccolith size and cell size in heterogeneous natural fossil populations21 agrees with ours very well ( fig. 1c ) , lending support to the constant relationship between cell size and coccolith size , and application to the whole noelaerhabdaceae family .
coccolith over - production in e. huxleyi , the only species where multiple coccolith layers are produced , will cause coccolith morphometry to underestimate net pic : poc , and this is unavoidable .
in the rare deposits where preservation is exceptional and coccospheres are intact , such as in the lagerstatte deposits of tanzania2829 , eq .
1 may be used to estimate pic : poc directly .
this approach would bypass the assumptions necessary to infer pic : poc directly from disarticulated coccoliths. with the aforementioned caveats in mind , changes in arl can be used to directly estimate the pic : poc ratio of the biomass in these ancient organisms using eq .
3 , albeit with a rather large associated uncertainty .
we have compiled pic : poc values from the literature and compared them with results inferred from our down - core record ( fig. 3 and fig. s1 ) .
the pic : poc of both the noelaerhabdaceae family mean , and of mggeo , increases in response to [ co2 ( aq )] and temperature .
this is opposite to results from the laboratory ( fig. 3 ) .
any change in pic : poc inferred from arl of mgemi coccoliths are well within the range of uncertainty however .
although the uncertainties in these estimates are large , these results are necessarily elusive to laboratory experiments due to the timescales involved .
phenotypic plasticity , as observed in laboratory experiments to date , cannot explain coccoliths becoming more calcified with increasing [ co2 ( aq )] and temperature .
based on our down - core observations we infer , therefore , either a component of selection for more heavily calcifying forms , or that the parameter space , and thus phenotypic plasticity , has not been thoroughly explored in the laboratory .
selection may drive evolution of the population internally through differential suitability of forms to the abiotic environment , or through differential susceptibility to grazers or viral attacks30 , or via propagation of differentially adapted forms introduced from elsewhere along gradients of nutrients , ph , salinity or temperature .
alternatively the apparent increase in size - normalised coccolith mass , within mggeo in particular , may be due to a transient increase in the relative abundance of established more highly calcifying pseudo - cryptic sub lineages1431 .
the increased mean - independent variance in size - normalised coccolith mass across tii may be the result of selection for different growth strategies , and / or differences in phenotypic plasticity across the population .
as a substrate , low co2 concentrations may limit growth rate32 , so increasing its concentration may allow for faster growth ; but elevated co2 at constant alkalinity decreases the saturation state of calcite making it more energetically costly to calcify .
increases in co2atm also drive increases in temperature .
to explain the increased variance over tii by the differential effect of phenotypic plasticity within the population superimposed on a general selection for more highly calcified forms , the more lightly calcifying forms would need to be more susceptible to a decreasing saturation state , but this is not observed in culture .
if anything , the relatively heavily calcifying g. oceanica appears to exhibit a greater plastic decrease in size - normalised coccolith mass with increasing [ co2 ( aq )] than the relatively lightly calcifying e. huxleyi .
alternatively , increasing [ co2 ( aq )] could conceivably create diverging niches ; lightly calcifying forms could be selected on the basis of faster growth on a given co2 substrate , and highly calcifying forms could be selected on the basis of reduced mortality due to the greater integrity of their calcitic ( presumably defensive ) structure .
whatever the mechanism , it is interesting to note that the size - normalised coccolith mass of the population is driven to a very narrow range during glacial times ( fig. 2 ) .
if this observation does indeed reflect a narrow range of pic : poc values , it may indicate that it is universally energetically favourable , at low temperature and [ co2 ( aq )] , to maintain a balance between the relative rate of photosynthesis to calcification , thus minimizing the effect of biomass production on intracellular carbonate chemistry ( fig. 4 ). from a biogeochemical viewpoint , calcification and photosynthesis alter the buffering capacity of water for co2 in opposing ways through their respective effects on [ dic ] and [ alk ] .
these effects are relevant on scales ranging from the sub - cellular environment in coccolithophores to global biogeochemical cycles .
in the sub - cellular environment , the ratio of calcification to photosynthesis determines the steady state drift in intracellular ph , that would otherwise occur if it were not counteracted by the active pumping of protons into or out of the cell ( fig. 4 ) .
during blooms , coccolithophores constitute an instantaneous net sink or source of co2 , or drive a change in ph , depending on their pic : poc ratio ( fig. 4 ) .
under typical modern conditions , formation of biomass in the surface ocean with a pic : poc of higher or lower than ~ 1.86 constitutes respectively an instantaneous source or sink of co2 ( fig. 4 ) , with this critical value varying with the carbonate chemistry of the water .
this effect is not permanent however ; the effect of biomass production on surface ocean seawater chemistry is often transient due to respiration and remineralization of organic matter by grazers , and dissolution of calcite causing cycling within the surface ocean .
carbon fluxes between the atmosphere and ocean are strongly influenced by export of organic matter and calcite from the surface ocean .
export has a prolonged effect on surface ocean / atmosphere partitioning of co2 because dic and alk are sequestered in the deep ocean or sediments , which have residence times of respectively hundreds , and tens of thousands of years .
coccolithophores are responsible for up to half of the calcification in the surface ocean1 , with members of the family noelaerhabdaceae typically contribute around half 33 .
it is through their role in pumping calcite to depth that coccolithophores constitute a significant lever on the global climate system .
in the modern ocean , phytoplankton stock is a function of light , nutrients , grazing and viral lysis34 .
the effect of predators and viruses cannot explain the current distribution of primary production in the surface ocean , which is dominated by nitrate and iron availability35 .
in coccolithophores , the pic : poc ratio describes the amount of calcite produced per unit organic matter .
as organic matter production is finite and limited by the availability of biologically accessible nitrogen and iron , the pic : poc ratio directly corresponds to the amount of calcite produced for a given standing stock or flux of ultimately limiting nutrients .
in the absence of other changes , an increase in the pic : poc ratio of coccolithophores in the surface ocean leads to an increase in the ratio of alk : dic exported , and thus a decrease in the buffering capacity of the surface ocean for co2 .
a confounding effect arises because cells are approximately the same density as water , and must be ballasted by heavy minerals , including calcite , in the form of aggregates or faecal pellets in order to be exported from the surface ocean before being remineralised .
in terms of the net effect on seawater carbonate chemistry in the surface ocean , export of calcite may therefore constitute a trade - off between direct removal of calcite , and the effect this has on the rate of export of organic matter36 .
in our down core record , coccolithophores belonging to the family noelaerhabdaceae appear , on average , to calcify more under increasing [ co2 ]( aq ) and temperature .
although it is impossible to decouple the effects of temperature , [ co2 ( aq )] , salinity and nutrient availability down - core , these parameters have varied together throughout geological time .
on glacial - interglacial timescales therefore , to first order , the noelaerhabdaceae ' may actually constitute a positive feedback to increasing co2atm on millennial timescales .
we have shown that natural coccolithophore populations appear to adapt to rising [ co2 ( aq )] and temperature on a millennial timescale , dominantly via selection for an increased tendency to calcify .
thus , this work introduces a temporal dimension to the prevailing view based on the results of culture manipulation experiments .
the theoretical model predicting this outcome describes a trade - off between fast growth and calcification11 , confounding the implications for the total rate of calcite production in the surface ocean .
we anticipate our results to be of use to biogeochemical modellers , but a more thorough understanding of the fate of biogenic material produced in the surface ocean is essential before the full implications of this work are realised .
methods culture experiments duplicate monoclonal batch cultures of four strains of coccolithophore belonging to the family noelaerhabdaceae were grown in sterile filtered ( 0.2 mum ) artificial seawater prepared according to esaw37 adapted for a range of dic concentrations ([ dic ] = 1.380 mm , 2.147 mm , 3.067 mm and 6.135 mm ) at constant ph ( 8.2 ) by varying sodium bicarbonate addition and titration with hcl and with nitrate ( 442 mum ) , phosphate ( 5.00 mum ) , vitamins , trace metals and edta according to k / 238 .
carbonate chemistry manipulation at constant ph is more analogous to changes expected in the surface ocean on a glacial - interglacial timescale than holding alkalinity constant , due to buffering by carbonate sediments .
cultures were maintained at 15 degreesc with an incident photon flux of 250 mue and a 12 / 12 light / dark cycle .
cells were acclimated for > 20 generations in dilute batch culture for each experimental condition prior to inoculation .
cells were inoculated in 2.4 l polycarbonate flasks , with no headspace and sealed off to the air with teflon lined caps .
removal of medium during the experiment was unavoidable due to the need to count and measure cells , and resulted in a maximum headspace of 20 cm3 at harvest .
in order to minimise the drift in culture conditions throughout the course of the experiment , cells were harvested at ~ 1 - 2 % ( and never greater than 4 %) of maximum cell density , which was determined for each experimental condition and strain combination via preliminary experimentation .
strains were ac478 ( rcc1211 gephyrocapsa oceanica from portuguese coast in atlantic ocean ) , ac472 ( rcc1216 emiliania huxleyi , from tasman sea in pacific ocean ) , ac448 ( rcc1256 emiliania huxleyi , icelandic coast in atlantic ocean ) and ac279 ( rcc1314 gephyrocapsa oceanica , french coast in atlantic ocean ) from the roscoff culture collection ( rcc ) .
particulate material was harvested by dry filtration onto pre - weighed membranes with 0.2 mum pore - size , and rinsed of salt with a minimal amount of deionised water ( adjusted to ph 7 ) .
coccolithophore size and concentration were obtained using a beckman z2 coulter counter ( see ref. 39 for description of coulter principle ) .
coccosphere and cell size were measured three times each respectively pre - and post - decalcification both morning and evening on the harvest day and the preceding day .
cells were decalcified by reducing the ph of the suspension with hcl addition to 5.0 with for around 20 minutes .
the coulter counter was calibrated to use esaw + k / 2 medium as an electrolyte , and for use with the acidified electrolyte , to accommodate for the difference in ionic strength .
cell division is synchronized under the light / dark cycle and cell size was assumed to increase linearly throughout the day40. by measuring cell and coccosphere size morning and evening , the bias introduced due to the time of day of measurement can be removed by interpolation to the same time of day .
this also removes the daily variation in the slope of eq .
3 which is a function of cell size40 and number of coccoliths per cell .
culture health was monitored by cell counts and microscope inspection on alternate days .
molar pic and poc were measured with a rock eval analyser , which is preferable to making assumptions about carbon density of biogenic material .
an aliquot of culture residue was bleached with dilute sodium hyperchlorite solution ( 4 % available chlorine for 20 minutes ) to remove the organic matter , and washed three times in deionised water to remove the bleach .
the resultant " pseudo - sediment " was subsequently analysed using the computational software , syraco204142 .
stable isotope and mg / ca measurements on planktonic foraminifera paired stable isotope ( delta18o and delta13c ) and mg / ca analyses were performed on typically 60 individual shells of globigerina inflata ( mis 15 - 13 ) and globigerina bulloides ( mis 7 - 5 ) , picked from the 300 - 355 mum size fraction .
in fig. 2 , the alternative filled points are temperatures inferred from the 250 - 300 mu size fraction , which captures the glacial termination more clearly than the larger fraction , but has little effect on [ co2 ( aq )] .
prior to isotopic analyses , samples were crushed , cleaned in 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution to remove any possible organic contaminants , rinsed with acetone and dried overnight in an oven at 60 degreesc .
measurements of the isotopic composition of carbon dioxide , released from the foraminiferal carbonate using a multiprep system , were performed on a vg sira mass spectrometer at the univ. cambridge .
calibration to the vienna peedee belemnite standard was through the nbs19 standard43 , and the analytical precision was better than 0.08 for delta18o and 0.06 for delta13c .
for mg / ca measurements , samples were prepared following the cleaning procedure described by barker et al.44 .
analyses were performed on a varian vista pro inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer ( icp - oes ) and a perkin elmer elan drcii quadrupole based inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometer ( icp - ms ) at the univ. cambridge , following established procedures4546 .
precision for measured mg / ca ratios determined from replicate runs of a standard solution containing mg / ca = 1.3 mmol / mol was 0.46 % .
accuracy of mg / ca determinations was confirmed by interlaboratory studies of foraminifera and carbonate reference materials4748 .
analytical methods proxy - derivation regressions are y - on - x ordinary least squares regressions on the mean of a fitted gaussian on log - transformed data .
an ordinary least squares regression was chosen because the uncertainty in the y - axis variable far exceeds that of the x - axis variable .
these histograms are given in the supplementary material .
volume - predicted pic : poc has a highly significant relationship with measured pic : poc ( p < 0.001 , f - statistic = 123 on 1 and 28 df ) , and an excellent linear fit ( = 0.81 ) .
the coccolith aspect ratio ( ar = coccolith thickness / sqrtcoccolith area ) is also a highly significant predictor of pic : poc ( p < 0.001 , f - statistic = 79 on 1 and 30 df ) and a good linear fit ( = 0.71 ) .
down - core odp site 1123 ( expedition 181 ) is located on chatham rise , east of new zealand in the southernmost pacific ( 41degrees47.2's , 171degrees29.9'w , 3290 m water depth .
the sediment age model for side odp site 1123 is based on a correlation with the orbitally tuned benthic oxygen isotope stack of lr044950 .
reconstructed sea surface temperature ( sst ) estimates are based on mg / ca ratios of planktic forams using species - specific published calibrations .
temperatures across the mis 7 - 5 interval were inferred from the g.bulloides 250 - 300 mum and 300 - 355 mum size fractions using the equation : mg / ca = 0.47 exp 1.08t , and those across mis 15 - 13 using the equation : mg / ca = 0.299 exp 0.090t51 .
[ co2 ( aq )] is estimated from global co2 mixing ratios of an assumed well mixed atmosphere from vostok and dome c antarctic ice cores ( fig. s2 ; compiled by52 ) , using the seacarb package in r53 , with dissolution assumed to be controlled only by sst at a constant salinity of 35 .
edc3 gas age was converted to lr04 using a published conversion54 .
carbon isotopic composition of planktic forams were used as a rough proxy for relative nutrient (~ phosphate ) availability corrected for the effect of temperature , using the relationships of 55 .
see fig. s3 for time series .
smear slides were prepared using a trial and error approach to attain the optimum coccolith density .
syraco analysis was carried out in cerege .
syraco in syraco analysis , all objects present in the field of view are individually segmented ( coccoliths and debris ) .
secondly the outline of segmented coccoliths is optimized for morphometric measurements .
the threshold is computed as the average between the mode of the pixels values ( corresponding to the dark background ) and the mean of the same segmented image .
this threshold value is reproducible and works with very different taxa ( f. profunda , e. huxleyi and u. sibogae to a sphenolithus and chiasmolithus etc. ) .
for all images , thresholds and parameters are measured the same way .
the area corresponds to the number of the isolated pixels ( minus the central are if it exists ) multiplied by the scale ( area of 1 pixel = 0.0036 mum2 ) .
the mass and the thickness is measured according to a published protocol20 .
effect of pic : poc on carbonate chemistry photosynthesis ( net photosynthesis = photosynthesis - respiration ) removes one mole of dic from surface ocean seawater and adds 15 / 106 moles of alkalinity56 ) for each mole of poc produced .
calcification removes 1 mole of dic and 2 moles of alkalinity for each mole of pic produced .
[ ta ] relative to [ dic ] dictates the buffering capacity of the surface ocean for co2 .
[ co2 ] and ph were calculated across dic and ta values at salinity = 35 , temperature = 25 degreesc , assuming zero concentration of phosphate and silicate and zero hydrostatic pressure , and published values for the first and second dissociation constants of carbonic acid57 .

figure 3 fractional change in pic : poc of natural heterogeneous populations over glacial terminations ( left ) , compared with that of monoclonal strains subject to an equivalent co2 change in culture ( right ) .
( a ) the response of mgemi in nature is within the range of uncertainty and of plasticity of e. huxleyi observed in the laboratory .
( b,c ) the pic : poc of mggeo in nature increases across both terminations , which is opposite to the equivalent plastic response as inferred from culture manipulations in g. oceanica .
error bars represent the 1sigma uncertainty , which for the down - core response , is calculated using the prediction interval of eq .
3. for culture results , details of the regressions are given in the supplementary material .
figure 4 instantaneous effect of biomass production on seawater carbonate chemistry as a function of pic : poc ( rho ) .
solid line isocontours represent [ co2 ] ( mumol / kg ) , and dashed isocontours represent ph. solid arrows represent the instantaneous effect of biogenic matter formation , and shaded arrows co2 exchange with an atmospheric carbon pool that is large relative to the perturbed sample of seawater .
depending on its rho , biogenic material may form an instantaneous sink or source of co2 .
for conditions typical of the modern ocean , when rho is < or > 1.42 , ph initially increases or decreases respectively , and when rho is < or > 1.86 [ co2 ] initially decreases or increases respectively .
these critical values depend on the carbonate chemistry of the surface ocean59 .

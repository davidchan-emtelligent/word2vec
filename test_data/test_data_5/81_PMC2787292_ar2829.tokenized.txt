introduction our previous study has reported that , in patients with untreated new - onset lupus ( unol ) , there was an abnormal increase in the number of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells that correlated with disease activity and significantly decreased after treatment .
however , little is known about the nature of this cell entity .
the aim of this study was to explore the nature of abnormally increased cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells in unol patients .
methods the expressions of surface ( cd4 , cd25 , cd127 , chemokine receptor 4 [ ccr4 ] , glucocorticoid - induced tumor necrosis factor receptor [ gitr ] , and cytotoxic t lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 [ ctla - 4 ]) and intracellular ( foxp3 ) molecules as well as cytokine synthesis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 unol patients were analyzed by flow cytometry .
the proliferative and suppressive capacities of different t - cell subgroups from unol patients were also assessed .
results in unol patients , the percentages of cd127low / - in cd25high , cd25low , and cd25 - subpopulations of cd4 + foxp3 + t cells were 93.79 % +/ - 3.48 % , 93.66 % +/ - 2.31 % , and 91.98 % +/ - 2.14 % , respectively ( p > 0.05 ) , whereas the expressions of foxp3 showed significant differences in cd25high ( 91.38 % +/ - 2.57 %) , cd25low ( 71.89 % +/ - 3.31 %) , and cd25 - ( 9.02 % +/ - 2.21 %) subpopulations of cd4 + cd127low / - t cells ( p < 0.01 ) .
the expressions of surface ccr4 , gitr , and ctla - 4 on cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells were significantly less than cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + t cells ( p < 0.05 ) .
moreover , unlike cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + t cells , cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells also synthesized interferon - gamma , interleukin ( il ) - 4 , il - 2 , and il - 17 ( p < 0.05 ) , though less than cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 - t cells .
the suppressive capacity was most prominent in cd4 + cd25highcd127low / - , followed by cd4 + cd25lowcd127low / - . cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - t cells showed the least suppressive capacity , which was similar to the effector t cells .
conclusions cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells in unol patients are different from regulatory t cells , both phenotypically and functionally .
cd127 is not an appropriate surface marker for intracellular foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells .
introduction systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by polyclonal activation of b and t lymphocytes .
it remains controversial whether the frequency and function of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + regulatory t cells ( tregs ) are altered in sle patients [ 1 ] .
in our previous study , we found that , in patients with untreated new - onset lupus ( unol ) , there was an abnormal increase in the number of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells ( instead of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs ) that correlated with disease activity and significantly decreased after glucocorticoid treatment [ 2 ] .
as foxp3 is currently thought to be one of the best markers for naturally occurring tregs ( ntregs ) , it is intriguing to explore the nature of this abnormally increased cell entity in unol patients .
to answer this question requires direct functional assay and indirect phenotypic analysis .
the crucial step of function assay is to find a proper surface substitute for intracellular foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells .
a study has suggested that low expression of cd127 ( receptor alpha chain of interleukin - 7 [ il - 7 ]) could be used as a surface marker for intracellular foxp3 in human cd4 + cd25 + tregs [ 3 ]. whether this is still true in cd4 + cd25 - t cells remains to be defined .
other cell surface molecules , including glucocorticoid - induced tumor necrosis factor receptor ( gitr ) , cytotoxic t lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 ( ctla - 4 ) , and chemokine receptor 4 ( ccr4 ) , have been investigated in tregs .
gitr has been found to be increased on cd4 + cd25 + tregs and plays a key role in dominant immunological self - tolerance [ 4,5 ] .
ctla - 4 is also predominantly expressed on cd4 + cd25 + tregs from thymus and peripheral blood and participates in the maintenance of immunologic self - tolerance [ 6 ] .
another cell surface molecule , ccr4 , is selectively expressed on th2 - type cells and tregs [ 7 - 9 ] .
foxp3 - transduced naive cd4 + cd25 - t cells have increased expression of ccr4 and obtain suppressive function as cd4 + cd25 + tregs [ 10 ] .
following our report , a recent study declared that these cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells functionally resembled conventional tregs by fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - t cells as a substitute for cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells from sle patients [ 11 ] .
in our current study , however , by analyzing the correlation of cd127 and foxp3 on cd4 + cd25 - , cd4 + cd25low , and cd4 + cd25high t cells , we found that , unlike in cd4 + cd25high t cells , cd127low / - was not a perfect surface marker for intracellular foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells ; therefore , cd4 + cd25 - cd127low / - t cells could not be used as a live substitute for cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells to perform functional assay .
we then set out to examine surface expressions of gitr , ctla - 4 , and ccr4 and ( importantly ) cytokine synthesis function of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + , cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + , and cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 - t cells .
we found that cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells in unol patients are different from tregs , both phenotypically and functionally .
materials and methods patients and healthy controls twenty - two unol patients of chinese ethnicity ( 19 women and 3 men ) were recruited in this study .
all patients fulfilled the sle classification criteria of the american college of rheumatology .
the mean age was 27.8 +/ - 9.1 years , and disease duration was 42 +/ - 28 days .
systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index ( sledai ) was 9.3 +/ - 5.2 .
twenty - five gender - and age - matched healthy volunteers were involved as healthy controls .
this study was approved by the ethics committee of peking union medical college hospital , and informed consent was obtained from each patient and healthy volunteer .
antibodies except as otherwise indicated , the monoclonal antibodies and reagents were obtained from ebioscience , inc .
( san diego , ca , usa ) : fluorescein isothiocyanate ( fitc ) - conjugated anti - human cd4 ( l3t4 ) , pecy5 - conjugated anti - human cd25 ( il - 2r ) , phycoerythrin ( pe ) - conjugated anti - human gitr , pe - conjugated anti - human ctla - 4 , allophycocyanin - conjugated anti - human foxp3 , and pe - conjugated anti - human il - 17 and their respective isotype controls .
pecy7 - conjugated ccr4 , pe - conjugated anti - human interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) , pe - conjugated anti - human il - 2 , and pe - conjugated anti - human il - 4 and their matched isotype controls were purchased from bd pharmingen ( san diego , ca , usa ) .
preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cell culture peripheral blood was collected , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) were prepared by ficoll - hypaque density gradient centrifugation .
for intracellular cytokine staining , freshly isolated pbmcs were cultured in complete rpmi 1640 media ( invitrogen ltd. , paisley , uk ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( hyclone , logan , ut , usa ) , 100 u / ml penicillin , and 100 mug / l streptomycin , as well as 20 ng / ml phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( pma ) ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) and 500 ng / ml ionomycin ( sigma - aldrich ) , in the presence of 10 mug / ml brefeldin a ( bd pharmingen ) in a humidified co2 - containing atmosphere at 37degreesc for 6 hours .
flow cytometry analysis pbmcs were washed in phosphate - buffered saline containing 2 % fetal calf serum and 0.09 % nan3 .
cells ( 1 x 106 ) were incubated with fitc - cd4 ( 20 mul ) and pecy5 - cd25 ( 20 mul ) and with pecy7 - ccr4 ( 5 mul ) , pe - gitr ( 20 mul ) , or pe - ctla4 ( 20 mul ) at 4degreesc for 30 minutes .
subsequently , cells were perforated , and intracellular staining for foxp3 and for pe - anti - ifn - gamma ( 20 mul ) , pe - anti - il - 4 ( 20 mul ) , pe - anti - il - 2 ( 20 mul ) , or pe - anti - il - 17 ( 20 mul ) was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer .
stained cells were then analyzed by a facscanto ( bd biosciences , san jose , ca , usa ) .
functional assays for the assessment of t - cell proliferation , facs - sorted cd4 + cd25 - cd127 + , cd4 + cd25highcd127low / - , cd4 + cd25lowcd127low / - , and cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - from pbmcs of unol patients were stimulated by soluble anti - cd3 monoclonal antibody ( 200 ng / ml ) in u - bottom 96 - well plates .
for the assessment of suppressive function of different t - cell subpopulations , 5 x 104 cd4 + cd25highcd127low / - , cd4 + cd25lowcd127low / - , or cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - t cells were respectively cultured in the presence of cd4 + cd25 - cd127 + t cells ( cell ratio 1:1 ) and irradiated pbmcs ( 1 x 105 ) in rpmi 1640 plus 10 % fetal calf serum at 37degreesc in a humidified co2 - containing atmosphere for 72 hours .
cck - 8 solution was added , and optical density value was measured 4 hours later .
statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss 13.0 software ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
numbers of cd4 + subpopulations were compared using the student t test .
a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant .
results correlations of cd127 and foxp3 expressions on cd4 + cd25 - , cd4 + cd25low , and cd4 + cd25high t cells from unol patients cd4 + t cells were divided into three subgroups by cd25 expression : cd4 + cd25high , cd4 + cd25low , and cd4 + cd25 - t cells .
we gated cd127low / - expression on foxp3 + t cells and backgated foxp3 expression on cd127low / - t cells , respectively .
we found that all cd4 + foxp3 + t cells had a low expression level of cd127 , regardless of cd25 expression .
percentages of cd127low / - in cd25high , cd25low , and cd25 - subpopulations of cd4 + foxp3 + t cells were 93.79 % +/ - 3.48 % , 93.66 % +/ - 2.31 % , and 91.98 % +/ - 2.14 % , respectively ( p > 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ) .
on the other hand , the expressions of foxp3 on cd4 + cd127low / - t cells showed significant differences in cd25high ( 91.38 % +/ - 2.57 %) , cd25low ( 71.89 % +/ - 3.31 %) , and cd25 - ( 9.02 % +/ - 2.21 %) subpopulations ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 2 ) .
foxp3 expressions in cd4 + cd127low / - t cells were high in cd25high but low in cd25 - subpopulations .
this result suggested that , unlike in cd4 + cd25high t cells , cd127low / - was not a perfect candidate surface marker for intracellular foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells and that cd4 + cd25 - cd127low / - t cells could not be used as a live substitute for cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells to perform functional assay .

moreover , the expressions of effector t cell ( teff ) - related cytokines , including ifn - gamma , il - 4 , il - 2 , and il - 17 , were analyzed to examine cytokine synthesis capacity of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells .
as shown in table 2 and figure 4 , in unol patients , unlike tregs ( cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 +) , cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells also synthesized ifn - gamma , il - 4 , il - 2 , and il - 17 ( p < 0.05 ) , though less than teffs ( cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 - ) .

first , all four subgroups were stimulated with anti - cd3 and assessed for their proliferative ability .
cd4 + cd25highcd127low / - tregs ( 0.205 +/ - 0.043 ) were found to be anergic compared with cd4 + cd25 - cd127 + teffs ( 0.421 +/ - 0.102 ) .
similarly , cd4 + cd25lowcd127low / - ( 0.210 +/ - 0.062 ) and cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - ( 0.272 +/ - 0.081 ) t cells showed a reduced proliferative response ( figure 5 ) .

then , cd4 + cd25highcd127low / - , cd4 + cd25lowcd127low / - , and cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - t cells were respectively cocultured with cd4 + cd25 - cd127 + teffs .
the suppressive capacity as shown by optical density was most prominent in cd4 + cd25highcd127low / - ( 0.213 +/ - 0.032 ) , followed by cd4 + cd25lowcd127low / - ( 0.281 +/ - 0.061 ) and cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - ( 0.387 +/ - 0.087 ) .
cd4 + cd25 - cd127 - t cells showed the least suppressive capacity , which was similar to the teffs , in line with its lesser expression of foxp3 ( 9.02 % +/ - 2.21 %) ( figure 5 ) .
discussion foxp3 is currently thought to be one of the best markers for ntregs .
it plays a pivotal role in the development and maturation of tregs .
foxp3 - deficient mice develop systemic autoimmune disease , and evidence from adoptive transfer experiments suggests that this is the direct result of ntreg defect .
moreover , overexpression of foxp3 in murine cd4 + t cells is sufficient to generate tregs in vitro .
in humans , foxp3 deficiency also leads to a systemic autoimmune disease known as ipex ( immune dysregulation , polyendocrinopathy , enteropathy x - linked syndrome ) .
it has been shown , however , that the expression of foxp3 is necessary , but not sufficient , to confer regulatory function of tregs .
foxp3 is also expressed on some activated cd4 + t cells [ 12 ] .
bonelli and colleagues [ 13 ] reported that foxp3 expression on cd4 + t cells significantly correlated with cd69 expression and that foxp3 might be associated with t - cell activation .
in our previous study , we found that a significant increase of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells in unol patients correlated with disease activity and that the cell number significantly decreased after glucocorticoid treatment [ 2 ]. whether these cells are tregs or activated teffs remains to be determined .
functional assay would be a direct way to identify the nature of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells if only we could find a proper surface substitute for intracellular foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells .
a study showed that low expression of cd127 could be used as a surface marker for intracellular foxp3 in human cd4 + cd25 + tregs [ 3 ] .
cd127 is expressed not only on lymphocytes , but also on monocytes and dendritic cells .
its ligand , il - 7 , is a pivotal cytokine involved in the development and survival of t and b lymphocytes [ 14 ] .
in addition , thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( tslp ) signals through cd127 in a heterodimeric complex with tslp receptor [ 15 ] .
tslp - activated dendritic cells might participate in the homeostatic maintenance of cd4 + and development of tregs in thymus [ 16 ] .
in this study , we gated and backgated expressions of cd127 and foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells .
we confirmed that cd4 + cd25highcd127low / - could be used as a substitute for isolating cd4 + cd25highfoxp3 + tregs , whereas the expression of foxp3 on cd4 + cd127low / - t cells showed significant differences in cd25high ( 91.38 % +/ - 2.57 %) , cd25low ( 71.89 % +/ - 3.31 %) , and cd25 - ( 9.02 % +/ - 2.21 %) subpopulations .
foxp3 expression on cd4 + cd127low / - t cells was high in both cd25high and cd25low subpopulations but low in cd25 - subpopulations .
this result suggested that , unlike in cd4 + cd25high t cells , cd127 was not a perfect surface marker for intracellular foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells .
it is also important to note that , although the cd25low population lies adjacent to cd25 - on a facs plot ( as shown in figure 2 ) , they belong to two different cell entities as their foxp3 expressions as well as their suppressive capacity and response to in vitro stimulation were different .
if the sorted cd25 - subgroup was ' contaminated ' with cd25low , it would bias function analysis of cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells from teffs to tregs [ 11 ] .
another possible explanation of the differences between the study of bonelli and colleagues [ 13 ] and ours is that there may be a difference between untreated , newly diagnosed patients and those more chronically ill who were drawn from an outpatient population .
it is possible that , as a consequence of illness , true cd25 + tregs have become cd25 - , whereas this has not occurred yet in patients with new - onset disease .
in our study , we found that the expressions of gita , ctla - 4 , and ccr4 on cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells resembled cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 - teffs and were significantly less than cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs .
moreover , unlike cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs , cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells also synthesized ifn - gamma , il - 4 , il - 2 , and il - 17 , though less than cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 - teffs , suggesting that the abnormally increased cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells in unol patients were not simple and pure tregs .
conclusions cd4 + cd25 - foxp3 + t cells in unol patients are different from tregs , both phenotypically and functionally .
cd127 is not an appropriate surface marker for intracellular foxp3 in cd4 + cd25 - t cells .

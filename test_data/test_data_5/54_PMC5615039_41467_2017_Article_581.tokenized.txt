about 50 % of the solar energy absorbed at the earth 's surface drives evaporation , fueling the water cycle that affects various renewable energy resources , such as wind and hydropower .
recent advances demonstrate our nascent ability to convert evaporation energy into work , yet there is little understanding about the potential of this resource .
here we study the energy available from natural evaporation to predict the potential of this ubiquitous resource .
we find that natural evaporation from open water surfaces could provide power densities comparable to current wind and solar technologies while cutting evaporative water losses by nearly half .
we estimate up to 325 gw of power is potentially available in the united states .
strikingly , water 's large heat capacity is sufficient to control power output by storing excess energy when demand is low , thus reducing intermittency and improving reliability .
our findings motivate the improvement of materials and devices that convert energy from evaporation .
the evaporation of water represents an alternative source of renewable energy .
building on previous models of evaporation , cavusoglu et al. show that the power available from this natural resource is comparable to wind and solar power , yet it does not suffer as much from varying weather conditions .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction evaporation , with an average global energy flux of about 80 w m - 2 , is a powerful process in nature1 - 3 that affects ecosystems , water resources , weather , and climate4 - 7 .
recent advances in water responsive materials8 - 11 and devices12 - 15 demonstrate the ability to convert energy from evaporation into work .
these materials perform work through a cycle of absorbing and rejecting water via evaporation .
these water - responsive materials can be incorporated into evaporation - driven engines that harness energy when placed above a body of evaporating water ( fig. 1a - c ). with improvements in energy conversion efficiency , such devices could become an avenue to harvest energy via natural evaporation from water reservoirs .
however , little is known about the potential of natural evaporation as a renewable energy source - - specifically , the power availability , intermittency , and the impact on water resources. fig. 1 the surface energy balance in the absence and presence of an evaporation - driven engine .
a the net radiative energy into a water body is balanced by convection and evaporation .
b an example of an evaporation - driven engine , incorporating water - responsive materials , placed at the water surface can harness energy from evaporation12 .
c such an engine harnesses energy from evaporation through a 4 stage cycle : ( i ) with the upper shutters ( gray jagged line ) closed , the water - responsive material ( green block ) swells , absorbing water vapor at the high chemical potential mu s .
( ii ) at maximum absorption , the upper shutters open as the bottom shutters close .
( iii ) with the upper shutter open , the water - responsive material shrinks , releasing water that evaporates away into the atmosphere at a lower chemical potential mu e .
( iv ) at maximum desorption , the upper shutters close as the bottom shutters open , restarting the engine cycle .
d the flows between the water body and the atmosphere occur along a thermal gradient between t s and t a for convection and along a chemical gradient between mu s to mu a for evaporation .
e the new energy balance can be illustrated between net incoming radiation , convection , evaporation , and work extracted between mu s and mu e the evaporation rate e is governed by the surface energy balance between net radiation and heat losses due to turbulent convection and evaporation ( fig. 1d ) .
combining this energy balance with equations of heat and mass transfer can predict e over a saturated water surface from meteorological data ( i.e. , net solar radiation , relative humidity , air temperature , and wind speed ) 16 .
this model has been adapted to understand changes in e over varying surfaces , such as plants17 and soil18 , 19 .
in this work , we estimate the power available from natural evaporation from open bodies of freshwater , such as lakes and water reservoirs , by modeling the effects of an evaporation - driven engine on the energy balance and coupled heat and mass transport .
we then study the power potential of natural evaporation from open water surfaces in the united states - along with the potential impact of such evaporation driven engines on water resources and energy reliability .
we find that natural evaporation could provide power at areal densities up to 10 w m - 2 ( triple that of modern wind power ) along with evaporative water losses being cut by nearly half .
when restricted to existing lakes and reservoirs larger than 0.1 km2 in the contiguous united states ( excluding the great lakes ) , we estimate the total power available to be up to 325 gw , which is over 69 % of the us electrical energy generation rate in 2015 .
finally , we investigate the possibility to control power output from an evaporation driven engine by using water 's heat capacity to store and release energy .
strikingly , we find that storing energy thermally in the water below an evaporation driven engine could substantially reduce intermittency by varying power supply to match power demand .
results a relationship between power and evaporation rate an evaporation - driven engine placed just above the water surface is powered by absorbing water at a high chemical potential , mu s , and releasing it at a lower chemical potential , mu e , to the atmosphere , mu a ( mu s > mu e > mu a ; fig. 1e ) .
for a reversible and isothermal engine , the power output depends on e and the work done per mole of evaporating water w = mu s - mu e. however , one cannot simply multiply existing e data by w , as the energy conversion process alters the evaporation rate .
therefore , predicting the power available from natural evaporation requires a relationship between w and e. e is affected by w in two ways .
first , the chemical potential drop w across the engine results in a reduction in water vapor pressure across the engine , which reduces the mass transport .
in the case of an ideal gas20 , w is - rt s ln ( alpha ) , where r is the molar gas constant , t s is the temperature of the surface , and alpha is the ratio of the vapor pressures above and below the engine .
note that the air immediately above the water surface is saturated with water vapor , therefore the ratio alpha is also the relative humidity at the top of the engine ( in dimensionless units 0.00 - 1.00 ) 21 .
we can rewrite alpha as follows : 1 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ alpha \ left ( w \ right ) = { e ^{\ frac {{ - w }}{{ r { t _ s }}}}}$$\ end { document } alphaw = e - wrts because the evaporation rate depends on the vapor pressure deficit between the engine surface and the atmosphere , an increase in w causes a reduction in evaporation rate .
second , the total energy required to evaporate water and extract energy from an evaporation - driven engine is the sum of the latent heat l and the work energy w. we define the ratio of this total energy to the unperturbed case as beta : 2 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ beta \ left ( w \ right ) = \ frac {{ l + w }}{ l }$$\ end { document } betaw = l + wl here , l is the molar latent heat of vaporization of water in j / mol .
thus , beta represents the energy penalty for evaporating water through an evaporation - driven engine versus the case with no engine .
consequently , w affects the energy balance between net radiation and heat loss due to convection and evaporation , because some portion of the energy from net radiation is now removed from the system as work .
using parameters alpha and beta , it is possible to derive a model that predicts the evaporation rate and power generated from it. note that w can be dynamically adjusted during operation by varying the resistance of the load so that the water responsive material in the engine must exert a larger force on the load .
thus , it is possible to control alpha and beta .
at steady - state , the net radiation leaves the engine surface via convection , evaporation ( i.e. , latent heat ) , and power generation .
the convective heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference between the engine surface and the atmosphere , whereas the latent heat flux is proportional to the difference in vapor pressures between the engine surface and the atmosphere .
the magnitudes of these two energy fluxes also depend on the transport characteristics of the air , which is primarily determined by turbulence and wind speed .
using these relationships , we derived an equation that relates the latent heat flux , f , to alpha and beta ( methods ) : 3 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ f = \ frac {{\ alpha \ delta }}{{\ alpha \ beta \ delta + \ gamma }}\ left ( { i + \ frac {\ gamma }{{\ alpha \ delta }} f \ left ( u \ right )\ left ( {\ alpha - {\ rm rh }} \ right ){ p _ a }} \ right )$$\ end { document } f = alphadeltaalphabetadelta + gammai + gammaalphadeltafualpha - rhpa here , f ( u ) is the convective mass transport coefficient of water vapor as a function of wind speed u , i is the net radiation , delta is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure versus .
temperature curve , gamma is the psychrometric constant , rh is the relative humidity of the air , and p a is the saturated vapor pressure of water at the air temperature .
equation ( 3 ) shows that evaporation occurs even when the net radiation is zero , as long as the relative humidity of the air is less than alpha .
under this condition , the remaining term in the parenthesis can be viewed as the drying power of the sub - saturated atmosphere .
once f is calculated , the evaporation rate e can be obtained from the relationship f = elrhom v , where rho and m v , are the respective liquid density and molecular weight of water .
finally , the areal power density w is given by w = fw / l. power generation and evaporative losses vary with weather conditions figures 2a , b illustrates predictions for w and e as a function of alpha ( w , t s ) for a range of rh values at conditions representative of typical mild weather conditions .
as alpha is lowered from unity ( w = 0 ) , the surface temperature rises while e gradually falls ( fig. 2b , c ) .
this gradual increase in surface temperature results in a proportional increase in convective heat losses c. evaporation ultimately stops at a certain alpha value , at which point heat is released mostly as convective heat c. importantly , w peaks at an optimal alpha value ( i.e. , an optimal w that maximizes the power density for given weather conditions ) .
interestingly , e at optimal power density is approximately half the open water e ( alpha = 1 ) under the same weather conditions ( supplementary fig. 1 ). fig. 2 steady - state power generation and effects on evaporative losses .
a energy fluxes , b evaporation rates , and c surface temperatures are calculated as a function of alpha ( w,t s ) for weather conditions of 200 w m - 2 i , 16 degreesc t a , 101.3 kpa p , and 2.7 m s - 1 ( 6 mph ) u at 5 values of rh ( mild conditions ) .
d maximum energy flux and e water saved from evaporation as a function of rh at cool ( pale , 12 degreesc , 150 w m - 2 ) , mild ( neutral , 16 degreesc , 200 w m - 2 ) , and warm ( dark , 20 degreesc , 250 w m - 2 ) weather conditions and three wind speeds : 1.8 ( 4 mph , solid ) , 2.7 ( 6 mph , dashed ) , and 3.6 m s - 1 ( 8 mph , dotted ) to better understand which weather variables most influence the optimal power density , we plot the optimal power densities and corresponding evaporation rate reductions as a function of relative humidity for a range of weather conditions ( fig. 2d , e ) .
interestingly , we find that the optimal power density varies weakly with wind speed , and increases strongly with decreasing atmospheric relative humidity .
we also find that the potential water savings increases with increasing wind speed and decreasing relative humidity .
the results suggest power densities of up to 15 w m - 2 and parallel evaporation rate reductions up to 7.5 mm h2o per day at some of the warmest and driest conditions .
note that these conditions vary over time and geography .
for example , the distribution of daily relative humidity values at daggett - barstow , california shows that the days where the relative humidity falls below 40 % occurs about 65 % of the time ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
therefore , one has to take into account the variability of weather conditions to determine the average power available .
using regional meteorological data22 , our model can now provide insight into the distribution of power densities available. by calculating maximum daily w and averaging it across an entire year , we generate a 5 ' resolution map of power density and parallel water savings across the contiguous usa ( fig. 3 and supplementary fig. 3 ) .
these maps suggest average annual power densities and corresponding water savings up to 10.49 w m - 2 and 5.9 mm h2o per day , respectively .
these maximums are located at needles airport in california , only 11 km from goose lake and 47 km from lake havasu .
this result is particularly striking since the locations of peak power potential and water savings occur simultaneously in the us southwest , a region that frequently suffers from water scarcity .
as a point of reference , the current mean total area power densities for current us wind and photovoltaic installations are 2.90 and 8.06 w m - 2 , respectively23 , 24. fig. 3 maps of power generation from natural evaporation and water savings .
a maximum power density available and b total decrease in evaporation rate due to power harvesting potentially available from open water surfaces across the contiguous united states of america .
maps calculated using the data22 across 934 weather stations to calculate w max and corresponding deltae at each location from eq .
( 3 ) with natural neighbor interpolation and linear extrapolation to generate a 5 ' resolution map the data in fig. 3 allow us to predict the total power and water savings potentially available from lakes and reservoirs in the us via a database of open water bodies25. by identifying the location and surface area of each open water body , we predict the potential annual mean power output and corresponding water savings available at each water body if it was covered entirely with an ideal evaporation driven engine .
our analysis reveals that 325 gw ( 2.85 million mwh per year ) is potentially available by covering lakes and reservoirs larger than 0.1 km2 across the contiguous us ( excluding the great lakes ) .
additionally , an additional 96.4 billion cubic meters of water could be recovered each year due to lower evaporation rates .
our results shown in table 1 indicate that potential power available exceeds demand in 15 of 47 us states studied26 , and saves more freshwater than consumed in 7 of those 15 us states27 .
the summary results of all us states studied can be found in supplementary table 1 .

this can be viewed as a feedback interaction between the engine and the atmosphere .
such feedback mechanisms can be critical to distributed renewable energy systems .
for example , atmospheric feedback imposes limits to the maximum power generation of wind turbines28 , 29 .
therefore , it is important to consider potential feedback effects in our model .
one potential feedback pathway is caused by the changes on the atmosphere due to covering lakes and reservoirs with evaporation - driven engines .
the evaporation - driven engine reduces the evaporation rate while increasing the rate of convective heat loss ( due to higher surface temperatures ) .
this shift of energy from evaporation to convection mimics the conditions seen when moist soils become dry , where higher convective heat fluxes warm the air due to reduced water availability for evaporation .
previous studies30 - 36 show that as previously moist soil become drier , the atmosphere becomes more arid , consistently shifting toward higher air temperatures and lower relative humidities37 , 38 .
these changes contribute toward a reduction in cloud cover39 , 40 ( i.e. , an increase in net radiation ) .
individually , these changes would increase the potential for evaporation that could result in power densities greater than those for fixed weather conditions , as seen in eq .
( 3 ) .
another feedback pathway is to expand the total available area for evaporation driven engines .
this could be due to artificially creating new reservoirs .
this would have the opposite effect ; with more open water surfaces made available , more evaporation would occur , leading to reduced air temperature and increased humidity .
such feedback has been shown in studies involving large - scale changes in land - use ( e.g. , urbanization , irrigation ) 41 , 42 .
this would result in power densities lower than those for fixed weather conditions .
however , the magnitude of these feedback pathways is likely to be small for the daily mean temperature and would primarily modify temperature extremes43 .
globally , any changes that could occur in the atmosphere is small since ocean evaporation dominates total global evaporation and the resulting temperature and humidity responses44 , 45 .
locally , feedback effects will also be small if the dimensions covered by an engine are below 500 km ( ref. 46 ) .
this is due to the important role of horizontal heat and moisture transport in the atmosphere that couples neighboring regions .
therefore , we are neglecting potential feedback effects , as they would not drastically affect our estimates .
control of power output under varying weather conditions while the model described by eq .
( 3 ) allows estimating power density and its dependence on meteorological variables , the ability to predict variability of power from evaporation at short timescales is limited due to the approximation that the net heat storage in the body of water is negligible .
evaluating this variability is crucial to understand the potential of evaporation as a renewable energy source since many renewable energy technologies suffer from intermittent availability .
to explore the variability of power from evaporation , we incorporate heat storage in the body of water below an evaporation driven engine into the energy balance among net radiation , evaporation , convection , and power generation .
to approximate the heat storage , we assume a simple mixed - layer water body with density rho , specific heat capacity c w , and mixed - layer depth d ( i.e. , the epilimnion ; typically , at least 5 m deep for lakes larger than 1 km2 ) 47 , 48 .
the energy balance is then given by ( methods , supplementary fig. 4 ) : 4 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ rho d { c _{\ rm { w }}}\ frac {{\ partial { t _{\ rm { s }}}}}{{\ partial t }} = i - \ beta f - c $$\ end { document } rhodcwdtsdt = i - betaf - c here , the rate of heat storage is balanced by incoming net radiation ( i ) and outgoing convective heat losses ( c ) and the sum of latent heat flux ( f ) and power output ( w ) .
note that betaf = f + w. thus , eq .
( 4 ) allows us to predict the water temperature t s , the latent heat flux f , and the power density w as a function of the chemical potential drop w and changing weather conditions over time .
importantly , w can be independently controlled .
this feature might allow us to control power generation , potentially mitigating the effect of changing weather conditions .
to demonstrate this , we develop a control system that adjusts w to match a power demand target over time ( supplementary fig. 5 ) .
we set the system 's power demand to that of three major u.s. energy markets in 2010 ( south - east central california49 , north central texas50 , and new york city51 ) along with their respective varying typical weather conditions22 .
because the power output of an evaporation driven engine scales with area , we are interested in relative variations in power demand over time rather than absolute values .
thus , we normalize each power demand curve to a target annual mean power density .
figure 4 illustrates the results of a simulation year in california with a target annual mean power demand of 2 w m - 2 .
the results show that power generation matches demand 95 % of the time , exhibiting some shortages on winter days where net radiation is low and relative humidity is higher .
supplementary fig. 6 illustrates results for texas ( 93 % match ) and new york ( 67 % match ). fig. 4 matching variable demand by controlling power output via heat storage .
results for the final year of a simulation run for south - east central california from daggett - barstow , california. from inside - out : hourly ( 1 ) i ( yellow , w m - 2 ) , ( 2 ) rh ( blue , %) , ( 3 ) t a ( red , degreesc ) , ( 4 ) u ( cyan , m s - 1 ) , ( 5 ) w pd ( gray , w m - 2 ) and predicted w o ( green dots , w m - 2 ) .
clockwise from the top - right are 3 - day samples of hourly w pd ( gray , w m - 2 ) and predicted w o ( green dots , w m - 2 ) for january , may , august , and november .
despite the variability of power demand and weather , power generation matches demand 95 % of the time .
meteorological data22 and power demand data49 are from publically available databases .
annual data are evenly divided by hourly data as the annual mean power demand increases , the frequency of power shortages increases despite an increase in the mean power generation .
figures 5a , b illustrates this aspect by comparing the 2 w m - 2 case to a 10 w m - 2 case in california .
as this comparison shows , the 10 w m - 2 case suffers from more power shortages during cooler months and is only able to match demand 48 % of the time .
however , some power generation still occurs during these cooler months resulting in the system 's annual generation - to - demand ratio to climb above 80 %. fig. 5 the relationship between reliability and average power output .
the demand ( gray line ) and generation ( dots ) for ( a ) 2 w m - 2 and ( b ) 10 w m - 2 annual average demand targets for the final simulation year in california .
in a , generation matches demand 95 % of the time with 99 % annual generation to demand ratio .
in b , generation matches demand 48 % of the time with 71 % annual generation to demand ratio .
c predicted average power generation as a function of target power demand for california ( circles ) , texas ( triangles ) , and new york ( squares ) test locations .
the overlaid contour map is the resulting generation to demand ratios at each power demand condition for that specific average power generation .
these simulations predict that the maximal generation is 2.4 , 5.1 , and 8.4 w m - 2 for the respective new york , texas , and california test locations to better understand the relationship between generation and demand , we repeat these calculations for a range of mean power demands .
figure 5c plots mean generation versus mean demand at each test location along with a generation - to - demand ratio heat map ( see also supplementary fig. 7 for water savings versus mean demand ) .
as demand increases , the system eventually saturates and provides no more additional generation .
these simulations predict a maximum generation of 2.4 , 5.1 and 8.4 w m - 2 for the respective new york , texas , and california test locations .
compared to the map in fig. 3a , the control system delivers at least 85 % of the power generation predicted by eq .
( 3 ) ( 2.8 , 5.3 , and 8.4 w m - 2 for the respective new york , texas , and california locations ) .
importantly , as the imposed generation target is reduced , the reliability of the system to match power demand increases .
discussion by developing a model of how an evaporation - driven engine perturbs the evaporation rate , this work provides the first predictions on how these energy harvesters could optimally perform in the natural environment .
although these evaporation energy harvesters are in the early stages of development , recent advances water - responsive materials8 - 11 and devices12 - 14 suggest several pathways toward achieving the predicted performance levels. with advances in energy conversion performance , these materials and devices could potentially contribute toward solving energy and water related challenges .
figure 3 illustrates the broad availability of energy and water savings by covering a water reservoir with evaporation driven engines .
these maps show that the regions of highest potential power generation and water savings are located where water is scarce .
this is striking because water and energy are typically seen as competing challenges while harnessing natural evaporation could address both challenges at once .
as an example , we consider the possibility of converting the e.v. spence reservoir in texas ( 31.93degreesn 100.57degreesw ) into an evaporation power plant .
if this reservoir ( 38.0 km2 surface area in 2004 ) 25 is completely covered by an evaporation driven engine , it would generate an average annual power output of 178 mw. this is 62 mw ( 53 %) greater than the nearby sweetwater phase iv wind farm23 .
moreover , the e.v. spence reservoir , which has been drastically impacted by a recent multi - year drought52 , could benefit from the potential water savings as a result of energy harvesting .
it is important to note that using evaporation driven materials and devices on lakes or reservoirs could affect freshwater resources53 ( e.g. , altering the water withdrawal rate , gas exchanges , water quality , and recreational use ) .
these consequences would impose additional design and planning constraints on such systems that could reduce the area available for energy harvesting .
however , the potential area available for open water energy harvesting is substantial - - lakes and reservoirs cover at least 95,000 km2 ( excluding the great lakes ) of the contiguous united states25 - - and are found across a geographically diverse range of locations54 .
some of these regions suffer from periods of water stress and scarcity52 , which might favor implementation of these energy harvesting systems due to the reduction of evaporative losses .
finally , a key challenge for current renewable energy resources is intermittency : wind turbines55 and solar photovoltaic panels56 produce power only when the wind and the sun are available .
since the supply of power must match demand on a real - time basis to maintain a stable electric grid , energy storage is a critical component of stable renewable energy systems to mitigate intermittency57 .
the results in figs. 4 , 5 show that the natural thermal energy storage capability of water is potentially sufficient to match realistic power demand variability .
this is a dramatic result for a renewable energy source that depends on variable environmental conditions .
thus , natural evaporation could provide a way to address the intermittency problem of renewable energy .
therefore , these findings suggest that natural evaporation could potentially be a widely available source of low - intermittency renewable energy .
methods derivation of equation ( 3 ) for steady - state evaporation , the incoming energy from net radiation leaves the water surface via convection and evaporation ( i.e. , latent heat ) .
the energy flux due to convection is proportional to the temperature difference between the surface and the atmosphere , whereas the energy flux due to evaporation is proportional to the difference in vapor pressures between the surface and the atmosphere .
we can eliminate the need to have surface temperature data by combining these fluxes with the energy balance16. by introducing the power output due to water evaporating through an evaporation - driven engine placed above a water surface , this new energy balance is 5 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ i = f + w + c $$\ end { document } i = f + w + c this system is now described by the energy balance between net radiation energy i ( solar plus longwave ) into a body of water against the energy losses through evaporative latent heat flux f , power per unit area w , and convective heat flux c. the latent heat flux f is proportional to the vapor pressure deficit between the engine and the atmosphere and a mass transfer coefficient 6 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ f = f \ left ( u \ right )\ left ( {\ alpha { p _{\ rm { s }}} - {\ rm rh }{ p _{\ rm { a }}}} \ right )$$\ end { document } f = fualphaps - rhpa here , f ( u ) is the mass transport coefficient and alphap s - rh p a is the vapor pressure deficit between the engine surface ( alphap s ) and the sub - saturated atmosphere ( rh p a ) .
the clausius - clapeyron relation describes the relationship between the change in saturation vapor pressure of water p and the change in temperature t , which yields the following form when the molar latent heat of vaporization l is assumed to be constant 7 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ p = \ exp \ left ( { 18.371 - \ frac {{ 5132 }}{ t }} \ right )$$\ end { document } p = exp18.371 - 5132t here , p is in kpa and t is in k. a more accurate relationship is given by the antoine equation .
however , differences are negligible for the temperature ranges involved in this analysis .
the convective heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference between the engine and the atmosphere and a heat transfer coefficient 8 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ c = \ gamma f \ left ( u \ right )\ left ( {{ t _{\ rm { s }}} - { t _{\ rm { a }}}} \ right )$$\ end { document } c = gammafuts - ta here , the psychrometric constant gamma ( units kpa k - 1 ) represents the ratio between the heat capacity of moist air to the latent heat of water , and combined with f ( u ) represents the heat transport coefficient58 .
the similarity in the relationships between f and c is because the fundamental mechanisms of heat and mass transport are essentially the same for water vapor in the air ( i.e. , the reynolds analogy ) .
for this work , we have used an empirical transport coefficient : 59 9 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ f \ left ( u \ right ) = 74.43 ( 1 + 0.536u )$$\ end { document } fu = 74.43 ( 1 + 0.536u ) this equation calculates the value of f ( u ) in w m - 2 kpa - 1 when u is given in m s - 1 at 2 m height .
we can couple f , c , and w together to simplify the right - hand side of the energy balance in eq .
( 5 ) as a function of the latent heat flux f. by our definition of beta in eq .
( 2 ) as the ratio of the total engine energy to latent heat , f + w = betaf .
likewise , because of the similarity in the relationships between the latent heat flux f and the convective heat flux c , we can express c as a ratio to f. this simple ratio is known as the bowen ratio58 10 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ b = \ gamma \ frac {{{ t _{\ rm { s }}} - { t _{\ rm { a }}}}}{{\ alpha { p _{\ rm { s }}} - {\ rm { rh }}{ p _{\ rm { a }}}}}$$\ end { document } b = gammats - taalphaps - rhpa we can now rewrite the energy balance as i = f ( beta + b ) .
however , this equation still requires currently unknown surface temperature data to solve .
to reduce the need for surface temperature data , we use the clausius - clapeyron relation delta , which is the slope of the vapor pressure versus temperature curve 11 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ delta \ equiv \ frac {\ partial }{{\ partial t }} p \ left ( t \ right ) = \ frac { l }{{ r { t ^ 2 }}} p \ left ( t \ right ) \ approx \ frac {{{ p _ s } - { p _ a }}}{{{ t _ s } - { t _ a }}}$$\ end { document } delta = ddtpt = lrt2pt =~ ps - pats - ta we can now estimate the temperature difference between the surface and the atmosphere by using ( p s - p a )/ delta , thus eliminating the need to know the surface temperature to predict the thermal gradient in eq .
( 10 ) .
we can now rewrite the bowen ratio from eq .
( 10 ) as 12 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ b = \ frac {\ gamma }{\ delta }\ frac {{{ p _{\ rm { s }}} - { p _{\ rm { a }}}}}{{\ alpha { p _{\ rm { s }}} - {\ rm rh }{ p _{\ rm { a }}}}}$$\ end { document } b = gammadeltaps - paalphaps - rhpa however , we still need a relationship to eliminate our dependence on surface vapor pressure data .
to address this challenge , we introduce the latent heat flux of the atmosphere 13 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${ f _ a } = f \ left ( u \ right )\ left ( {\ alpha { p _{\ rm { a }}} - {\ rm rh }{ p _{\ rm { a }}}} \ right )$$\ end { document } fa = fualphapa - rhpa here , the surface vapor pressure p s for f in eq .
( 6 ) has been replaced with the saturated vapor pressure of the atmosphere p a. thus , f a represents the drying power of the sub - saturated atmosphere if the surface was at the same temperature as the air .
therefore , the ratio of f a to f is 14 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ frac {{{ f _{\ rm { a }}}}}{ f } = 1 - \ alpha \ frac {{{ p _{\ rm { s }}} - { p _{\ rm { a }}}}}{{\ alpha { p _{\ rm { s }}} - {\ rm rh }{ p _{\ rm { a }}}}}$$\ end { document } faf = 1 - alphaps - paalphaps - rhpa we can use f a / f in eq .
( 12 ) to estimate the ratio between the saturation vapor pressure deficit due to temperature differences ( p s - p a ) and the true vapor pressure deficit between the engine and the sub - saturated atmosphere ( alphap s - rhp a ) , thus eliminating the need to know the surface temperature to predict the vapor pressure gradient. by re - writing the bowen ratio from eq .
( 12 ) with this new information , we get 15 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ b = \ frac {\ gamma }{{\ alpha \ delta }}\ left ( { 1 - \ frac {{{ f _{\ rm { a }}}}}{ f }} \ right )$$\ end { document } b = gammaalphadelta1 - faf we use eq .
( 13 ) and ( 15 ) to solve i = f ( beta + b ) and get the expression for f in eq .
( 3 )\ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ f = \ frac {{\ alpha \ delta }}{{\ alpha \ beta \ delta + \ gamma }}\ left ( { i + \ frac {\ gamma }{{\ alpha \ delta }} f \ left ( u \ right )\ left ( {\ alpha - {\ rm rh }} \ right ){ p _{\ rm { a }}}} \ right )$$\ end { document } f = alphadeltaalphabetadelta + gammai + gammaalphadeltafualpha - rhpa there are two important caveats to this model .
first , we have not completely eliminated the need to know the surface temperature for this model , since it is used to set alpha in eq .
( 1 ) .
second , we need to choose a temperature to evaluate delta in eq .
( 11 ) to estimate the ratio of the saturation vapor pressure deficit ( p s - p a ) to the thermal gradient ( t s - t a ) .
we can address both issues through an iterative approach .
for the first iteration , we approximate both alpha and delta at the air temperature .
after determining f , we re - approximate the surface temperature t s by using the aerodynamic equation for the convective heat flux c in eq .
( 6 ) and the bowen ratio shown in eq .
( 15 ) 16 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${ t _{\ rm { s }}} = { t _{\ rm { a }}} + \ frac {{ f - { f _{\ rm { a }}}}}{{\ alpha \ delta f \ left ( u \ right )}}$$\ end { document } ts = ta + f - faalphadeltafu this is an improved estimate of the surface temperature for alpha .
next , we calculate the mean temperature between the air and surface , t m = ( t s + t a )/ 2 , for solving delta in eq .
( 13 ) .
this provides a better estimate of the ratio between the saturation vapor pressure deficit ( p s - p a ) and the thermal gradient ( t s - t a ). with these improvements , we can iterate through eqs .
( 3 ) , ( 16 ) until the surface temperature converges toward a solution .
generation of geographical maps for our steady state model , we generate daily mean i , t a , rh , u , and p values at each tmy3 station in the contiguous usa ( 934 total stations ) and calculate the maximum power output and corresponding water savings for that day .
this calculation is repeated for 365 days in the dataset , and the annual average power output and corresponding water savings is calculated across these 365 samples ( supplementary fig. 3 ) .
the annual mean at each location is then used to develop the geographical maps in fig. 3 by natural - neighbor interpolation .
calculation of total power and water savings possible for our steady - state model , we identify the location and size of each contiguous lake and reservoir in the global lakes and wetlands database25 found within the contiguous united states .
we then interpolate between our data from fig. 3 to calculate the total power generation and corresponding annual water savings possible for that location if the entire water body was covered with an evaporation driven engine .
additionally , the distance to the nearest tmy3 weather station and the us air force code of that station is stored for each station .
the results of this calculation are used to develop the summary statistics shown in supplementary table 1 .
data from the energy information administration26 and us geological survey27 are used to determine the respective net energy generation rate and freshwater consumption in each state .
derivation of equation ( 4 ) our non - steady state ( dynamic ) model is exactly described by the energy balance between net radiation energy i ( solar plus longwave ) into a body of water against the energy losses through evaporative latent heat flux f , power density w , convective heat flux c , horizontal conduction g , and heating of the water s from the water body : 17 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ i = f + c + w + s + g $$\ end { document } i = f + c + w + s + g the horizontal conduction g represents the heat transfer due to the difference in temperatures between the water and the soil of the shore .
over the longer time scales of the steady - state analysis , g is estimated to be negligible .
to continue disregarding this heat transfer in the shorter time scales being explored , we assume that the sides and the bottom of the water body are insulated .
the remaining energy flows out of the body of water is power , evaporation , and convection .
the evaporative heat flux f is defined in eq .
( 6 ) , the convective heat flux c is defined in eq .
( 8 ) , and the power density w is defined by w = f w / l. the final remaining item in the energy balance is the heat storage term s. we describe s with a lumped capacitance model .
in this model , the energy storage capability of the body of water is proportional to the heat capacity of water and the change in temperature over time 18 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ s = \ rho d { c _{\ rm { w }}}\ frac {{\ partial { t _{\ rm { s }}}}}{{\ partial t }}$$\ end { document } s = rhodcwdtsdt here , rho is the density of water , d is the epilimnion depth of water ( the warmest , near isothermal , upper layer of a body of water ) , c w is the heat capacity of water , and dt s / dt is the rate of change in water temperature over time due to heat storage / loss. by substituting our new expressions for f , c , w , and s , we rearrange the energy balance of eq .
( 16 ) to produce eq .

( 4 ) does converge toward the steady state energy balance of eq .
( 3 ) ( supplementary fig. 4a - c ) .
due to the storage term s , the water surface temperature depends on the past history of the energy balance , thus exhibiting a memory effect .
the time needed for this system to forget the past is called the relaxation time , which is strongly dependent on the depth of water d ( supplementary fig. 4d ) , with some additional dependence on the wind speed u and the work load w. generation of simulation data for power demand matching tmy3 data from stations 723815 ( daggett - barstow airport ) , 722650 ( midland international airport ) , and 725020 ( newark international airport ) are used to provide hourly typical meteorological data for our three respective test markets in california , texas , and new york .
to simulate the varying power demand for each respective test location , each hourly regional power load data set is normalized by the respective mean power load for 2010 and then scaled by a pre - factor to gauge the potential power density of this power system .
hourly data is linearly interpolated to generate data at one - second intervals for calculations , with data sampling at one - hour intervals .
derivation of controller parameters to control the power delivery of the model system ( supplementary fig. 5a ) , a combined feedback and feedforward controller with saturation limits is designed ( supplementary fig. 5b ). by looking at fig. 2 , it is evident that operating on the high w ( low alpha ) side of the w curve would lead to lower evaporation rates ( therefore greater water savings ) and higher thermal energy storage .
to achieve this , a feedforward model is designed where the alpha required for zero evaporation , alpha 0 , is defined at any moment by knowing the current t s , t a , and rh. this is defined as the ratio between the sub - saturated vapor pressure in the air and the saturation vapor pressure at the water surface : 19 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ alpha _{\ rm { 0 }}} = \ frac {{{ p _{\ rm { d }}}}}{{{ p _{\ rm { s }}}}} = \ frac {{{\ rm rh }{ p _{\ rm { a }}}}}{{{ p _{\ rm { s }}}}}$$\ end { document } alpha0 = pdps = rhpaps this solution can be used to determine the w 0 required for zero evaporation : 20 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${ w _{\ rm { 0 }}} = l \ left ( {\ frac {{{ t _{\ rm { s }}}}}{{{ t _{\ rm { a }}}}} - 1 } \ right ) - {\ rm r }{{\ rm t }_{\ rm { s }}}\ log \ left ( {\ rm rh } \ right )$$\ end { document } w0 = ltsta - 1 - rts logrh for convenience , we use alpha in our implemented ideal proportional - integral ( pi ) controller scheme .
the controller gain is tuned to the inverse slope of the w ( alpha ) curve at alpha 0 21 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ k = \ frac {{\ partial \ alpha }}{{\ partial w }}{|_{{\ alpha _ 0 }}} = - \ frac { l }{{ f \ left ( u \ right ){ p _ s } r { t _{\ rm { s }}}\ log {\ alpha _{\ rm { 0 }}}}}$$\ end { document } k = dalphadw | alpha0 = - lfupsrts logalpha0 however , to reduce the computational time , an estimated gain of 0.0015 m2 w - 1 is used in this work .
the integral time is tuned to the time step of the simulation , one second in this work .
a saturation range of 0.0 - 0.2 is applied to the pi feedback controller to prevent controller overshoot due to the non - linearity of the system .
a final saturation control range of 0.0001 - 1.0 is applied to the sum of the feedforward and feedback controllers to prevent illogical controller values .
the clamping anti - windup method provided by matlab - simulink is used to prevent pi controller overshoot due to saturation .
the non - linear characteristics demonstrated by the power density versus surface vapor pressure curve in fig. 2a can be adequately linearized near the zero - evaporation and zero work condition ( low alpha ) .
however , at higher power density levels , there is a risk of the controller going ' over the hill ' and leading to a catastrophic failure of the pi control scheme .
to avoid this , we use saturation controls to design a relatively safe controller at the cost of losing out on the maximum power potential of the system .
it may be of interest to investigate alternative control methods to further improve the output of the proposed power plant system .

ob - jec - ti - ve : to investigate the relationships between thyroid function and metabolic risk factors in obese adolescents with non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) .
methods : one hundred sixty obese adolescents and 40 control subjects were enrolled in the study .
the obese subjects were divided into two groups based on presence or absence of liver steatosis ( nafld group and non - nafld group ) .
serum samples were assayed for glucose , insulin , cholesterol , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , free thyroxine ( ft4 ) , free triiodothyronine ( ft3 ) and thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) .
the ratio of ft3 to ft4 was evaluated as an indirect index of deiodinase activity .
insulin resistance was evaluated by homeostasis model assessment ( homa - ir ) from fasting samples .
results : nafld and non - nafld groups had slightly higher fasting blood glucose values than the control group .
fasting insulin levels in the nafld group were significantly higher than those in the non - nafld and control groups .
the nafld group had significantly greater homa - ir values compared with the non - nafld group and also with the control group .
the nafld group had significantly higher ft3 / ft4 ratio values compared to both non - nafld and control groups .
ft3 / ft4 was positively correlated with serum insulin levels in the nafld group .
conclusion : this study showed that obese adolescents with hepatosteatosis had elevated values for ft3 / ft4 ratio .
this finding suggested a high conversion of t4 to t3 due to increased deiodinase activity as a compensatory mechanism for fat accumulation .
thyroid function obesity non - alcoholic fatty liver insulin resistance introduction obesity is considered a worldwide health problem and its prevalence is known to increase steadily and dramatically all over the world ( 1 ) .
in parallel with epidemic obesity , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) has also been increasingly recognized worldwide in the last decade .
nafld encompasses a histological spectrum from isolated hepatic steatosis to steatosis with inflammation , cell injury and possible fibrosis .
some cases may progress to cirrhosis , portal hypertension and consequently , to liver - related death in early adulthood ( 2,3 ) .
obesity affects hypothalamic - pituitary - thyroid axis directly or indirectly leading to alterations in thyroid function tests .
subclinical hypothyroidism ( sh ) is a preliminary stage of overt hypothyroidism , defined as a mild elevation of thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) level in a patient with normal serum thyroxine ( t4 ) level .
sh has been found to be associated with hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance and obesity in adults .
however , to our knowledge , there are no reported studies on the interaction of sh and free triiodothyronine ( ft3 ) to free t4 ( ft4 ) ratio in obese adolescents with nafld in comparison with age - matched healthy controls .
this present study was undertaken to investigate , also considering the effect of metabolic risk factors , the relationships between sh and ft3 / ft4 ratio in obese adolescents with nafld .
methods one hundred sixty consecutive obese adolescents ( 81 girls and 79 boys , mean age : 12.5 +/ - 2.1 years , age range 10 - 15 ) recruited from pediatric patients admitted to our department of pediatric endocrinology between april 2010 and june 2011 were included in the study .
the obese subjects were divided into two groups based on presence or absence of liver steatosis with high transaminases .
the non - nafld group included 80 obese patients without liver steatosis ( 40 girls and 40 boys , mean age : 12.4 +/ - 2.1 years , age range 10 - 15 ) .
the nafld group included 80 obese patients with liver steatosis ( 41 girls and 39 boys , mean age : 12.6 +/ - 2.1 years , age range 10 - 15 ) .
lean adolescents ( 21 girls and 19 boys , mean 1.9 +/ - 2.5 years , age range 9 - 15 ) were enrolled in the study by selection from a group of non - obese healthy adolescents who attended the hospital for reasons other than infection , malignancy and without a history of thyroid hormone therapy or use of drugs causing insulin resistance .
exclusion criteria were hepatic virus infections ( hepatitis a , b , c , d , e and g , cytomegalovirus and epstein - barr virus ) , alcohol consumption , history of parenteral nutrition and use of drugs known to induce steatosis or affect thyroid functions ( e.g. valproate , amiodarone , thyroid hormones , propylthiouracil or prednisone ) .
autoimmune and metabolic liver disease , wilson 's disease and alpha - 1 - antitrypsin - associated liver disease were ruled out using standard clinical , laboratory and histological criteria .
family history for obesity and diabetes were obtained by questionnaires .
none of the patients had a family history of diabetes .
the study protocols were approved by the institutional review board of konya training and research hospital .
signed informed consent forms were obtained from the parents of the children .
height and weight were measured with an empty bladder in postabsorptive conditions .
height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm , without shoes , back against the wall tape , eyes looking straight ahead , with a right - angled triangle resting on the scalp and against the wall .
weight was measured with a lever balance , to the nearest 100 g , without shoes , in light undergarments .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight ( in kilograms ) divided by height ( in meters squared ) .
patients with a bmi of >= 95th percentile according to reference curves for turkish children and adolescents were accepted as obese ( 4 ) .
the pubertal development stage of the patients was assessed by a single pediatric endocrinologist using the criteria of tanner stages .
sexual maturation stage was 2 or greater in all patients ( tanner stages 2 - 4 ) .
after the child had rested for at least 5 minutes and was in a sitting position , diastolic and systolic pressure ( mmhg ) measurements were taken using a mercury - gravity manometer and a cuff appropriate for body size .
blood samples for estimation of serum glucose , insulin levels and other parameters were collected between 08:00 and 10:00 a.m. , following a 12 - h overnight fasting period .
serum concentrations of total cholesterol , high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - cholesterol ) and triglycerides were measured using routine enzymatic methods with abbott aeroset ( usa ) analyzer .
value of low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - cholesterol ) was calculated using friedewald equation .
in addition to standard liver function tests [ alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( ast )] , serum levels of calcium , phosphate , magnesium , alkaline phosphatase and creatinine were measured on the same day with an auto analyzer .
glucose was determined by the hexokinase method .
serum insulin levels were measured by an immulite immunoassay ( siemens diagnostics , usa ) .
insulin sensitivity index was derived from fasting blood samples .
the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) was calculated as fasting insulin concentration ( microu / ml ) x fasting glucose concentration ( mmol / l )/ 22.5 .
a homa - ir value greater than 3.16 was considered indicative of insulin resistance ( 5 ) .
metabolic syndrome was defined according to the modified world health organization ( who ) criteria adapted for children .
subjects were diagnosed as having metabolic syndrome if they met 3 of who criteria ( 6 ) .
serum samples were assayed for ft4 , ft3 and tsh levels using an automated chemiluminescence assay system ( advia centaur xp ) .
normal values were as follows : ft3 3.5 - 6.4 pmol / l ; ft4 9.54 - 23.09 pmol / l ; tsh 0.35 - 4 microiu / l. sh was defined as ft4 at the normal range and increased tsh levels .
the ratio ft3 to ft4 ( ft3 / ft4 ) was calculated as an indirect index of deiodinase activity ( 7 ) .
autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase ( tpo - ab ) and against thyroglobulin ( tg - ab ) were detected by radioimmunoassay .
patients with tpo - ab and tg - ab levels higher than 60 iu / ml , suggesting autoimmune thyroiditis , were excluded .
liver ultrasonography for assessment of liver steatosis was performed in all subjects by a trained operator who was blinded to all clinical and laboratory characteristics of the participants , using a general electric logic 9 ( mi , usa ) machine , equipped with 7.5 mhz probes in younger children and 5 mhz in larger or markedly obese children and adolescents .
the diagnosis of nafld is usually based on mild elevations in liver tests noted during a blood test and liver ultrasonography results in an overweight or obese child .
in the present study , all obese patients with nafld had high alt levels defined as > 30 u / l and the diagnosis of nafld was based on elevated alt levels (> 30 u / l ) ( 8 ) confirmed with abnormal liver ultrasonography results as defined by tominaga et al ( 9 ) .
although liver ultrasonography can estimate neither fibrosis nor inflammation , it has a sensitivity of 89 % and a specificity of 93 % for detecting histological steatosis ( 10 ) .
all patients with abnormal high transaminases and abnormal liver ultrasonography results were screened for other liver conditions ( hepatitis b surface antigen , hepatitis c antibody , prothrombin time , serum iron level , total iron binding capacity , ferritin and antinuclear antibodies ) which were all negative .
statistical analysis mean and standard deviations ( sd ) were used as descriptive statistics .
differences in the means of variables were tested using both parametric and nonparametric tests depending on the distribution of the variables .
the correlations among numerical data were analyzed by the pearson 's correlation coefficient ( r ) .
to analyze the associations between categorical variables , spearman 's rank correlation coefficient was used .
comparison between groups was performed using anova ( post hoc : bonferroni ) .
regression analysis was performed by multivariate stepwise regression .
a probability value of < 0.05 was considered significant .
the spss version 14 ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) was used for statistical analyses .

results table 1 shows the demographic , anthropometric , physical and biochemical findings in the lean group and in the obese groups with and without nafld .
age , height and gender ratios were similar in all three groups .
bmi - sds was significantly higher in the nafld and non - nafld groups compared to the control group ( p : 0.001 , p : 0.001 , respectively ) .
however , there was no significant difference between non - nafld and nafld groups for bmi - sds ( p : 0.12 ) .
while the obese groups showed no significant differences in terms of diastolic blood pressure ( p : 0.05 ) , both obese groups had significantly higher systolic blood pressure than the control group ( p : 0.01 , p : 0.01 , respectively ) .
hdl cholesterol levels were higher in the non - nafld group than in the nafld group ( p : 0.02 ) .
however , the control group had significantly higher hdl cholesterol levels compared to both nafld and non - nafld groups ( p : 0.001 , p : 0.001 , respectively ) .
no significant differences were found between nafld and non - nafld groups for other lipid levels .
there were no significant differences in terms of triglycerides , total cholesterol and ldl levels between the non - nafld and lean groups .
ast and alt levels were higher in the non - nafld group than in the control group ( p : 0.02 , p : 0.03 , respectively ) .
however , the nafld group had significantly higher ast and alt levels compared to both non - nafld and control groups .
nafld and non - nafld groups , as compared with the control group , were found to have slightly higher fasting blood glucose levels , but the differences were not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
the non - nafld group had significantly higher fasting insulin levels than the lean group ( p : 0.001 ) .
however , the nafld group had significantly elevated fasting insulin levels compared to both control and non - nafld groups ( p : 0.001 , p : 0.01 , respectively ) .
the nafld group had significantly greater homa - ir values compared to the non - nafld group ( p : 0.01 ) and to the control group ( p : 0.001 ) .
the control group had significantly greater ft4 values than the non - nafld group and also the nafld group , but ft4 levels were within the normal range in all groups .
the nafld group had significantly higher levels of ft3 than the non - nafld and control groups ( p : 0.001 , p : 0.001 , respectively ) .
there was no statistically significant difference between the groups for tsh levels , but nineteen patients in the nafld group had elevated tsh levels .
ft3 / ft4 ratio was higher in the non - nafld group than in the control group ( p : 0.002 ) .
however , the nafld group had significantly higher ft3 / ft4 ratio compared to both non - nafld and control groups ( p : 0.001 , p : 0.001 , respectively ) ( figure 1 ) .
thyroid ultrasonography findings were reported as normal in all subjects .
to establish the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the nafld and non - nafld groups , the obese groups were further classified into those with and without metabolic syndrome .
the proportion of patients who had metabolic syndrome was 65.0 % ( 52 / 80 ) in the nafld obese group , while this proportion was 22.5 % ( 18 / 80 ) in the non - nafld obese group .
in the nafld group , ft3 / ft4 was positively correlated with insulin levels ( r : 0.54 , p : 0.04 ) and negatively correlated with diastolic blood pressure values ( r : - 0.23 , p : 0.03 ) ( table 2 ) .
ft3 / ft4 ratio was positively correlated with fasting blood glucose ( r : 0.64 , p : 0.003 ) , insulin ( r : 0.52 , p : 0.02 ) and homa - ir ( r : 0.58 , p : 0.008 ) in the nafld group with elevated tsh levels ( tsh > 4 ) ( table 3 ) .
discussion to the best of our knowledge , our study is the first to evaluate the associations between ft3 / ft4 ratio and nafld , which also includes a comparison with lean healthy controls .
the findings of this study demonstrated that ft3 / ft4 ratio was higher in obese adolescents with nafld compared to both non - nafld obese and lean control groups , suggesting a higher conversion from ft4 to ft3 due to increased deiodinase activity as a compensatory mechanism for fat accumulation to improve energy expenditure .
furthermore , we found positive associations among ft3 / ft4 ratio , insulin and homa - ir. we emphasized that presence of nafld in an obese adolescent has a harmful effect on thyroid function and is also correlated with enhanced insulin resistance .
little is known about the significance of thyroid function abnormalities in obesity .
however , since these abnormalities often normalize with weight loss , they seem to be a reversible consequence of the weight status .
in some studies , a correlation between tsh and / or thyroid hormones and bmi has been reported in adult obese subjects ( 11 ) , but this relationship has not been shown in other studies ( 12 ) .
stichel et al ( 13 ) reported an increased frequency of elevated tsh concentrations ( 7.5 % above the upper normal limit of 4 u / l ) in 290 obese children , with t3 concentrations significantly higher than in the control group ( but within the normal range ) and with normal t4 .
reinehr and andler ( 14 ) reported moderately increased peripheral thyroid hormones ( t3 , t4 ) and tsh levels in obese children .
according to these authors , t3 , t4 and tsh correlated with the degree of overweight but not with leptin or lipid levels .
they also found that a reduction in overweight caused a significant decrease in t3 , t4 and leptin serum concentrations , with no significant changes in tsh .
in a more recent study , they reported that tsh and ft3 , but not ft4 , were significantly increased in obese children and that both were correlated with bmi ( 15 ) .
hepatic injury develops as hepatocytes and their anti - oxidant defenses are overwhelmed by oxidative stress as appears to be the case in nafld .
oxidative stress increases hepatic steatosis via lipid peroxidation increase and released cytokines lead to more mitochondrial damage ( 16,17 ) .
mitochondrial injury can lead to mutation and loss of mitochondrial dna ( 18 ) .
since atp is critical for maintaining cellular integrity , its depletion may predispose to hepatocellular injury ( 19 ) .
mitochondrial atp is a source of cyclic amp , which is a second messenger for lots of hormones including tsh and trh. with the depletion of atp , the production of the second messenger c - amp by adenylate cyclase decreases .
liver cells are one of the main targets of thyroid hormones and with depletion of cyclic amp , the action of these hormones in hepatocytes would be affected .
the clinical result is hepatocyte unresponsiveness to thyroid hormones and an increase in tsh level to overcome this decrease .
progressive fat accumulation was associated with a parallel increase in tsh and ft3 levels irrespective of insulin sensitivity and metabolic parameters and a positive association has been reported between the ft3 to ft4 ratio and both waist circumference and bmi in obese women aged 18 - 68 years ( 7 ) .
this finding suggests a high conversion of t4 to t3 in patients with central fat obesity due to increased deiodinase activity as a compensatory mechanism for fat accumulation to improve energy expenditure ( 7 ) .
the study by targher et al ( 20 ) involving a large cohort of unselected adult outpatients was the first to report a strong association between thyroid function tests and serum liver enzyme activity concentrations .
in particular , targher et al ( 20 ) found a significant positive relationship between serum tsh , alt and ggt activities throughout the normal and high tsh ranges and a similar inverse relationship between ft4 and serum liver enzyme activity concentrations .
pacifico et al ( 21 ) reported that serum tsh concentrations were significantly higher in obese children with fatty liver as compared to children with no fatty liver .
on the other hand , children with hepatic steatosis did not differ significantly from those with no hepatic steatosis with respect to ft3 and ft4 .
hizli et al ( 22 ) found that sh frequency in obese children with fatty liver is not higher than that in patients without fatty liver .
in conclusion , the results of this study show that ft3 / ft4 ratio values are elevated in obese adolescents with hepatosteatosis , suggesting a high conversion of t4 to t3 possibly due to increased deiodinase activity as a compensatory mechanism for fat accumulation .
our findings also point to a relationship between ft3 / ft4 ratio and the severity of insulin resistance .
detection of a high ft3 / ft4 ratio in an obese adolescent should alert the clinician to a possibility of nafld and insulin resistance .

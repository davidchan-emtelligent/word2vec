background the hyper - reactive malarial splenomegaly syndrome ( hms ) is a leading cause of massive splenomegaly in malaria - endemic countries .
hms is caused by a chronic antigenic stimulation derived from the malaria parasite .
classic fakunle 's major criteria for case definition are : persistent gross splenomegaly , elevated anti - malarial antibodies , igm titre > 2 sd above the local mean value and favourable response to long - term malaria prophylaxis .
the syndrome is fatal if left untreated .
the aim of this study is to systematically review the literature about hms , particularly focussing on case definition , epidemiology and management .
methods the search strategy was based on the following database sources : pubmed , embase , scopus .
search was done in march , 2014 and limited to english , spanish , italian , french , and portuguese .
results papers detected were 149 , of which 89 were included .
splenomegaly was variably defined and the criterion of increased igm was not always respected .
the highest prevalence was reported in papua new guinea ( up to 80 %) .
in different african countries , 31 to 76 % of all splenomegalies were caused by hms .
fatality rate reached 36 % in three years .
the most frequent anti - malarial treatments administered were weekly chloroquine or daily proguanil from a minimum of one month to lifelong .
in non - endemic countries , a few authors opted for a single , short anti - malarial treatment .
all treated patients with no further exposure improved .
cases not completely fulfilling fakunle 's criteria and therefore untreated , subsequently evolved into hms .
it seems thus appropriate to treat incomplete or ' early ' hms , too .
conclusions for patients not re - exposed to endemic areas , a short course of treatment is sufficient , showing that eradicating the infection is sufficient to cure hms .
longer ( probably lifelong ) courses , or intermittent treatments , are required for those who remain exposed .
splenectomy , associated with high mortality , should be strictly limited to cases not responding to medical treatment .
keywords hyper - reactive malarial splenomegaly management treatment epidemiology review issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background hyper - reactive malarial splenomegaly ( hms ) represents one of the leading causes of massive splenomegaly in malaria - endemic countries [ 1 ] .
hms is caused by an aberrant immune response to a chronic antigenic stimulation in subjects long exposed to malaria parasites [ 2 ] .
previously defined as tropical splenomegaly syndrome ( tss ) , hms has long been considered distinct from a splenomegaly directly resulting from malarial parasitaemia .
the syndrome is characterized by macroglobulinaemia with overproduction of immunoglobulin , especially of the igm class , which aggregate into high molecular immune complexes and cause persistent splenomegaly because of prolonged clearance from the reticuloendothelial tissue [ 3 ] .
cryoglobulins and autoantibodies , such as , for instance , rheumatoid factor , contribute to the macroglobulinaemia [ 4 ] .
a direct correlation between the spleen size and the igm titre has been described [ 5 - 8 ] .
genetic factors are likely to be involved in the development of hms .
studies carried out in papua new guinea reported a higher incidence in individuals with hla - dr2 haplotype or with hla heterozygosity [ 9,10 ] .
moreover a retrospective study carried out in ghana evidenced that the relatives of patients with hms were more likely to have splenomegaly than population controls [ 11 ] .
diagnostic criteria for hms were proposed by fakunle in 1981 [ 12 ] .
major criteria are : persistent gross splenomegaly extending more than 10 cm below the costal margin , without any other apparent cause , elevated anti - malarial antibodies , igm titre > 2 standard deviations ( sd ) above the local mean value and favourable clinical and immunological response to long - term malaria prophylaxis [ 13 ] .
minor diagnostic criteria are : hepatic sinusoidal lymphocytosis , normal cellular and humoral immune responses to antigenic challenge , including phytohaemagglutinin stimulation ( pha ) , hypersplenism , lymphocyte proliferation , occurrence within families or tribes .
other laboratory findings are related to hypersplenism , such as variable degrees of pancytopaenia , especially anaemia .
the underlying mechanism causing anaemia is the plasma volume expansion and the spleen sequestration along with an increased haemolysis .
reticulocytes and indirect bilirubin are often increased [ 14,15 ] .
acute episodes of haemolysis can also occur and seem to be associated with an autoimmune , cold - agglutinin - mediated response triggered by non - patent parasitaemia [ 16 ] .
sinusoidal lymphocytosis may be revealed by histologic examination of liver biopsy , but it is not specific .
the peripheral blood smear in hms subjects is most often negative .
however , using more sensitive diagnostic methods , such as polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , the proportion of positive cases increases [ 17 - 19 ] .
the main , severe complications of hms are acute infectious illnesses , haemolytic anaemia ( especially during pregnancy ) and splenic rupture .
according to historical data , the syndrome is often fatal if left untreated [ 20 ] .
some authors have hypothesized that hms could be considered as a pre - malignant state that could evolve to chronic lymphocytic or hairy cell leukaemia or splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes , as a result of a multi - step process with a single clone selection in a set of deregulated polyclonal expansion of lymphocytes [ 21 - 23 ] .
actually , hms and lymphoproliferative disorders are often clinically indistinguishable .
serological similarities between hms and splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes ( slvl ) have also been reported .
in the latter condition , too , a markedly raised anti - malarial antibody and igm level have been observed [ 24 ] .
spleen reduction after a prolonged anti - malarial treatment is one of the main criteria used to diagnose hms .
failure to respond makes an alternative diagnosis more likely [ 25 ] .
despite a comparatively large amount of literature on malaria , only a few papers deal with this particular complication .
moreover , diagnostic criteria are not uniform , epidemiological data are scarce and the clinical management has been variable .
this aim of this review was to retrieve the relevant literature on hms , focusing in particular on three key aspects : diagnostic criteria for the case definition , epidemiology ( prevalence and mortality ) and management .
methods searching the search strategy was based on the following database sources : pubmed , embase , scopus , with no limitation as for the year of publication .
the oldest paper retrieved was published in 1966 .
our searching strategy was based on these keywords ( using of course the specific language of each database ) : asymptomatic malaria , chronic malaria , malarious splenomegaly , splenomegaly syndrome , splenomegalic syndrome , tropical splenomegaly , malarial splenomegaly .
additional search terms used were : epidemiology , prevalence , incidence , pathogenesis , diagnosis , case definition , prognosis , mortality , fatality , management , treatment .
the search was restricted to ' humans' and to the following languages : english , french , spanish , italian , and portuguese .
the search was carried out in march 2014 .
reference lists of all the articles identified were also examined and relevant cited references were reviewed similarly .
types of study surveys , epidemiological studies , case reports / series , studies on etiology , pathogenesis , diagnosis and treatment of hms were collected .
reviews were excluded from the analysis .
inclusion criteria articles had to deal with hyperactive malaria splenomegaly or its synonymous , such as tropical splenomegaly or chronic malaria , as a main subject .
exclusion criteria papers were excluded when primarily dealing with acute malaria or with other causes of splenomegaly ( such as ebv , cmv , hiv , schistosomiasis ) .
all papers identified were assessed by two reviewers ( sl and db ) who independently screened the titles and abstracts , using the criteria mentioned above .
then they read the full text of those retained after the first screening .
in case of differences , a final consensus was reached after discussion that included a third reviewer ( zb ) .
data were extracted from all finally retained papers and specific fields of an excel spreadsheet were populated .
the spreadsheet was previously created on the basis of the study 's purpose. with available data the analysis was focused first on epidemiology , such as gender and age of patients , country where the study was conducted and country of origin of the patients , prevalence of the syndrome in a given area , mortality rate , etc .
then we filled the section on diagnostic criteria and in particular if they followed the fakunle 's criteria or not .
finally data were extracted considering the type and duration of the treatment and when available , also data on outcome at follow - up. finally , the reported treatment outcome of studies with more than 10 recruited subjects was summarized .
the studies were obviously heterogeneous but , because of the extreme poverty of papers dealing with hms , it was aimed to provide the most comprehensive picture of the main reported aspects of the syndrome since the first publication until now .
results the electronic search identified 331 papers from pubmed , 60 from embase and 75 from scopus .
sixty - eight duplicates were discarded .
after an evaluation of language , titles and abstracts , a total of 152 papers were detected that may relate to this review .
thirteen were not retrieved .
on the basis of the full text , 51 papers were discarded since they did not deal with hms .
the remaining 89 papers were included .
the flow is summarized in figure 1 ( prisma flow chart ) .
figure 1 prisma flow chart .
sixty - three papers described cases observed or studies conducted in endemic areas .
in particular , 50 / 63 ( 80 %) in africa , 8 / 63 ( 12 %) in asia [ 26 - 33 ] , and 5 / 63 ( 8 %) in south america [ 16,34 - 37 ]. of the 26 papers from non - endemic countries , 22 ( 85 %) concerned patients observed in europe , the others were case reports from israel [ 38 ] , the usa [ 39,40 ] and hong kong [ 41 ] .
apart from two retrospective studies [ 42,43 ] and one prospective longitudinal study [ 19 ] , the other papers were case reports / case series .
these included immigrants ( 15 papers ) , expatriates ( ten papers ) or both groups ( one paper ) .
the range of age of subjects under study fell from birth [ 44 ] to a maximum of 77 years [ 45 ] and most of the patients with hms were young adults .
according to some studies a male gender prevalence was noted but analysing the literature no significant gender difference was observed .
diagnostic criteria for case definition fakunle 's criteria were mostly used , but adherence to them was variable .
most authors declaring to follow fakunle 's criteria considered as splenomegalic a patient with spleen size bigger than 10 cm below the costal margin ( figure 2 ) , but lower measures were also reported [ 34,46 ] .
overall , the range of the spleen size reported to define splenomegaly was extremely variable , from 3 [ 27 ] to 30 cm [ 47 ] below the costal margin .
both palpatory and echographic methods were used .
some authors preferred to use hackett 's spleen size classification [ 16,20,29,35,48 - 50 ] , which is based on palpation .
they considered as splenomegalic a patient with spleen size classified at least in the ii or iii grade ( table 1 ) .
other authors did not define splenomegaly , but described the spleen as " gross " [ 13 ] or " huge " [ 39 ] .
the increase in igm titre was not always respected .
some authors considered it neither specific nor necessary [ 51,52 ] .
in five studies the syndrome was also diagnosed in absence of raised igm [ 1,32,37,52,53 ] .

spleen not palpable even on deep inspiration. i. spleen palpable below costal margin , usually on deep inspiration. ii. spleen palpable , but not beyond a horizontal line halfway between the costal margin and umbilicus , measured in a line dropped vertically from the left nipple. iii .
spleen palpable more than halfway to umbilicus , but not below a line horizontally running through it. iv. palpable below umbilicus but not below a horizontal line halfway between umbilicus and pubic symphysis. v. extending lower than class 4 .
in other studies the case definition relied on at least two out of the three major criteria ( leaving aside anti - malarial antibody titre that is invariably raised ) , besides excluding other causes of splenomegaly [ 28,42,43,54 ] .
it was observed that some of those patients , if further exposed to malaria , evolved to the complete syndrome , and this suggested the possibility to make the diagnosis at an early stage [ 43 ] .
moreover , a direct correlation between the splenomegaly class and the igm level has been demonstrated , suggesting a continuum in the syndrome evolution [ 42 ] .
another approach to the diagnosis of hms was a combination of major and minor criteria .
in 1976 , before the publication of fakunle 's criteria , mardsen and crane had suggested the following : persistent splenomegaly , hepatic sinusoidal lymphocytosis , disproportionate elevation of serum igm levels and high anti - malarial antibody titre , without considering the response to the therapy [ 55 ] .
in other papers , the exclusion of other causes of splenomegaly in an endemic area was sufficient to consider a patient as affected by hms [ 56,57 ] .
epidemiology in endemic countries there are scanty data regarding the prevalence of the syndrome in the general population .
studies performed in papua new guinea reported an extraordinarily high prevalence of the syndrome ( 85 % in five years old children and 80 % in adults ) among inhabitants of the upper watut valley [ 58 ] .
the relationship between the parasite rate and the spleen size varied with age : in children the spleen size appeared to be directly related to the parasite rate , while in adults the opposite occurred [ 44 ] .
studies conducted in the gambia reported a much lower prevalence : 1.6 per 1,000 subjects aged ten years or older [ 44,59 ] .
other authors studied the proportion of splenomegaly caused by hms .
in northern nigeria , 30 splenomegalic patients out of 75 ( 40 %) were classified as having hms , and so were 137 out of 334 subjects in northern zambia ( again , 40 %) , 38 patients out of 131 ( 31 %) in kenya , 91 / 221 ( 41 %) in ghana and 87 / 114 ( 76 %) in eastern sudan [ 1,48,60 - 62 ] .
in papua new guinea , the overall mortality rate in a series of 75 untreated patients during a 72 - month period was 36 % , reaching 57 % in patients with grade v splenomegaly [ 20 ] .
in another study , the reported mortality rate in adults was 26 % at ten years follow - up , but it fell to 13 % in subjects under chloroquine prophylaxis [ 2 ] .
the main causes of death were infectious diseases , acute haemolysis and multi - organ failure ( mof ) [ 35,63,64 ] .
non - endemic countries the first case of hms in a caucasian who lived in africa was described in 1970 [ 65 ] .
only two case series were retrieved describing more than ten expatriates returning to europe [ 42,43 ] .
most patients had lived for at least five years in an endemic area .
both series ( in belgium and italy , respectively ) included patients fully responding to the classic criteria ( 17 / 49 and 29 / 57 , respectively ) and patients with an incomplete syndrome .
the clinical outcome at follow - up was favourable for all patients who remained in europe and presented at follow - up. the only other case series described in europe is a prospective study in spain [ 19 ] on 14 immigrants ( from equatorial guinea or cameroon ) , all responded to fakunle 's criteria .
four had a positive blood film , and four additional patients were positive at pcr .
a six years old child was the youngest immigrant from africa diagnosed with hms [ 66 ] .
a seven years old child , born in uk to ghanaian parents , was diagnosed with hms after three short trips to ghana ( eight weeks in total ) , the last one eight months before presentation .
despite the absence of fever or fever history , plasmodium falciparum trophozoites and gametocytes were found in her blood [ 67 ] .
therapy in endemic countries the most frequent anti - malarial treatments administered in endemic countries were weekly chloroquine [ 2,26,31 - 34,37,49,61,62,68 - 71 ] or daily proguanil [ 13,25,52,57,60,64,71 - 78 ] .
other regimens were chloroquine plus primaquine [ 27,70 ] , mefloquine [ 28 ] , quinine [ 18 ] , pyrimethamine [ 56 ] , artemether [ 18 ] , and sulphadoxine / pyrimethamine [ 18,50 ] .
overall , the duration of therapy ranged from a minimum of one month [ 13,56 ] to a lifelong treatment [ 2 ] .
the largest cohort of patients ( 148 ) under lifelong chloroquine prophylaxis showed an improvement of all , with a partial regression of splenomegaly and an increase of haemoglobin level over a period of 12 - 18 months .
however , in no case a normalization of the spleen size was observed .
the prophylactic regimen halved the mortality rate over ten years compared to untreated patients [ 79 ] .
other studies confirmed the efficacy of this regimen [ 27,31,71 ] .
the most recent one was carried out in sudan in 2013 and reported , after a three - month therapy , a complete normalization of the spleen size in 14 patients out of 21 [ 69 ] .
in nigeria , 10 / 39 subjects fully recovered and 29 / 39 improved after daily proguanil administered for two to 12 months [ 76 ] .
two papers reported improvement after a single , short course of anti - malarial treatment followed by oral steroid therapy [ 50,80 ] .
however , other authors observed that the syndrome tended to quickly relapse once anti - malarial therapy was stopped [ 75,78 ] .
only one study in sudan [ 18 ] opted ( for the 33 patients included ) for a short course anti - malarial treatment ( various regimens ) as for an acute falciparum malaria .
for most of the patients , other treatments were administered during the follow - up ( for 15 to 24 months ) .
however , no prophylaxis was administered during the different treatments .
thirty - six patients had improved and 12 had worsened at the end of the follow - up period , while six were reported as unchanged .
table 2 summarizes the main results of the studies including more than ten patients .

only few data are available on hms treatment in pregnancy .
a recent retrospective study carried out in thailand reported the efficacy of weekly mefloquine , administered for two to 25 weeks ( median nine weeks ) to 31 pregnant women with suspected hms , without any major adverse event .
those presenting only one or two major criteria of the conventional definition of hms were also treated and showed on average a spleen size reduction of more than 40 % [ 28 ] .
therapy in non - endemic countries the management of hms in non - endemic areas has been heterogeneous .
overall , the drugs used were : chloroquine , quinine plus clindamycin or doxycycline or pyrimethamine - sulphadoxine , proguanil , mefloquine , atovaquone - proguanil , halofantrine , and artemisinin derivatives .
a few authors preferred to prescribe a short course (<= seven days ) of anti - malarial treatment , while the majority opted for longer therapy .
overall , the follow - up period ranged from six weeks to 36 months .
in six studies out of 21 a short course of treatment ( as for an acute malaria episode ) was administered [ 17,42,43,66,81,82 ] .
in the belgian study ( table 3 ) [ 42 ] all 49 expatriates received a short course of anti - malarial therapy .
thirty - nine patients were followed up for at least two weeks after treatment ( median six weeks ) showing improvement or a complete recovery .
the italian study ( table 3 ) [ 43 ] ( 57 patients , mostly european caucasians , of which 28 with an incomplete ' early ' stage hms ) confirmed the efficacy of short treatment in absence of re - exposure , and showed 100 % improvement at follow - up ( six to 36 months after therapy ) .
the remaining four papers are case reports .
two of them reported a global improvement at follow - up visits , two and 24 months after treatment , respectively [ 17,82 ] : one used quinine plus doxycycline and the other one mefloquine .
conversely , one case was described with no improvement eight months after a three - day course of atovaquone - proguanil [ 46 ] .

most other authors opted for long - term treatment following , in some cases only , a short anti - malarial course [ 84,85 ] .
the duration of therapy varied from one [ 46 ] to 12 months or until recovery [ 83,86 ] .
intermittent therapy was also used , with quinine [ 45 ] or with chloroquine plus proguanil [ 87 ] .
the most common prescription , just as in endemic countries , was chloroquine alone [ 54,83,85,88 ] , or in combination with doxycycline [ 46 ] , with proguanil [ 42,85,89 ] or with primaquine [ 90 ] , or preceded by a short course of quinine [ 19,83,88 ] or halofantrine [ 83 ] .
other regimens used for long - term treatment were proguanil [ 67,85,86 ] , mefloquine [ 91 ] or quinine plus doxycycline [ 17 ] .
all patients with no further exposure and with available follow - up data improved .
it is not clear whether a mere withdrawal of exposure , without treatment , could be sufficient to obtain hms resolution : only a few case reports debate on this aspect .
one described the persistence of hms in a eight years old caucasian boy , who had been on chloroquine prophylaxis while in africa , after an 18 - month stay in europe [ 91 ] .
another case of hms was diagnosed in an ethiopian immigrant after a 19 - month stay in israel [ 38 ] .
on the contrary , a spontaneous resolution of the syndrome was reported in a guinean patient after two months of residence in a malaria - free area , with a regression of the spleen size from 20 cm to 3 - 4 cm below the costal margin and a normalization of all laboratory findings [ 92 ] .
the main results of the three case series described in europe with more than ten patients are summarized in table 3 .
splenectomy splenectomy in hms is generally suggested for patients with huge splenomegaly and disabling symptoms , who do not respond to medical treatments [ 29,93 ] .
one study analysing short - and long - term outcome of splenectomy reported a peri - operative mortality rate of about 31 % rising to 39 % at long - term ( 41 - 74 months ) follow - up [ 94 ] .
the most frequent peri - operative complications described were major bleeding and infections .
the latter were the main cause of death in the following months .
most surviving patients improved .
however , the liver tended to progressively enlarge , probably related to persistence of the antigenic stimulus [ 95 ] .
in non - endemic areas , therapeutic splenectomy has been reported in venezuela , sri - lanka , hong kong [ 30,39,41 ] and the usa ( for haemolytic anaemia complicating hms ) [ 40 ] .
discussion the literature available on hms consists of some case reports and a few case series .
parameters considered by different authors are often heterogeneous and hardly comparable .
however some key points are identifiable .
first of all , hms should be taken into consideration in all patients with splenomegaly living / having lived in malarious areas .
strict adherence to fakunle 's criteria is questionable .
some authors observed that cases not completely fulfilling the criteria can subsequently evolve into the full - blown , ' classical ' hms [ 42,43 ] , thus representing an early stage of the syndrome .
considering the high fatality rate of this condition , if left untreated , as well as the wide availability of effective anti - malarial drugs , it seems appropriate to treat hms even in case the classical triad of splenomegaly , raised igm and anti - malarial antibodies is only partially satisfied .
clearly , investigations of other possible causes of splenomegaly should be carried out , in particular , but not limited to , considering lymphoproliferative disorders .
the treatments administered have been heterogeneous and do not permit recommending a first choice regimen yet , considering the lack of randomized clinical trials .
however , for patients who move from endemic to non - endemic areas , there is circumstantial evidence supporting the fact that an adequate short - course treatment is effective [ 42,43 ] .
this contrasts with the more common choice of a long - term anti - malarial course in these cases , too , which is the classical approach that has been suggested and followed for decades .
it reflects the view that the syndrome tends to evolve even though malaria parasites are no longer present in blood .
this particular aspect was described in a study showing a progressive enlargement of the liver after splenectomy in a patient with negative thick blood films .
this occurrence was attributed to persistence of the underlying stimulus to reticulo - endothelial system [ 95 ] .
according to the most cited authors [ 2 ] , the absence of parasitaemia is one of the diagnostic criteria .
this view does not hold any longer .
on the one hand , recent reports showed that more sensitive diagnostic tools have found a higher proportion of malarial infection in hms patients [ 17 ] .
this suggests that plasmodium is present , albeit often at sub - microscopic parasite density .
on the other hand , the full response to a short course of anti - malarial therapy indicates that the eradication of the infection is usually sufficient to cure hms [ 28,42,43 ] .
therefore , the presence of plasmodium in blood is necessary for a further development of the syndrome .
this is also suggested by the unusual case of hms reported above [ 67 ] : a child who still had circulating plasmodium eight months after her last short - term visit to a malaria - endemic country .
conclusion lifelong effective malaria prophylaxis or intermittent treatments are probably necessary for those who remain exposed to malaria transmission .
chloroquine seems to still be partially effective , even if p. falciparum resistance has developed .
possibly this regimen acts not only as an anti - malarial , but also as an immunomodulating and immunosuppressant therapy [ 47,96 ] , as it is suggested by the regression of the spleen size even in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders [ 60 ] .
the choice of the drug should consider the local pattern of p. falciparum drug susceptibility , as well as the availability and cost of the different regimens .
splenectomy is potentially associated with high mortality , therefore it should be strictly limited to cases that do not respond to medical treatment [ 94,97 ] .

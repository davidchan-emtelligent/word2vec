an untapped source of potential telephone counseling referrals is dental hygienists .
implementing a system that cues dentists and dental hygienists to give cessation advice and refer patients to telephone counseling has the potential to increase the number of smokers accessing telephone counseling .
we have previously reported on a clinical trial examining a computer - assisted tobacco intervention ( cati ) tool embedded in the electronic dental record ( edr ) .
the results showed significant increases in the rate at which dental hygienists assessed interest in quitting , discussed specific strategies for quitting , and referred for telephone counseling .
after the conclusion of the trial the system was permanently implemented in both the control and intervention clinics .
the question of sustained use is examined in this report .
methods electronic dental records were examined for use of advice scripts and referral to telephone counseling .
gee methods tested differences in quit line referral rates by time period .
results during the trial , 15.4 % of smoker visits at intervention clinics included a referral to telephone counseling .
intervention clinic referral rates were 15.6 % after full cati deployment and dropped to 12.2 % ( p = 0.004 ) after a change in the edr .
control clinic referral rates were 8.5 % after full deployment and 8.1 % ( p = 0.92 ) following a change in the edr .
how this research advances the field of d & i : appropriately designed software can help disseminate tobacco interventions into dental practice .
however , use is sensitive to software design and other factors .

in japan , adhesive skin plasters containing nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are frequently used to treat pain of musculoskeletal origin .
there are many reports on their efficacy but few on patients' impressions of usability or levels of satisfaction. objectives .
to elucidate the differences in perception between patients and physicians concerning nsaid plasters. subjects .
we conducted two surveys about nsaid plasters on patients and physicians .
600 patients currently using plasters and 200 physicians currently prescribing nsaid plasters were studied. methods .
questionnaire included items concerning usage , efficacy and side effects , site and intensity of their pain , pain management strategies , characteristics they desired from nsaid plasters , and their satisfaction with them. results .
the characteristic most frequently reported as desirable by patients was analgesic efficacy , followed by avoiding skin irritation and low medication cost .
the characteristics most frequently reported as desirable by physicians were analgesic efficacy , alignment with patient preference , safety to skin , and comfort when applied .
our survey revealed that both patients and physicians prioritized analgesic efficacy of nsaid plasters .
however , approximately half of the patients and physicians were unsatisfied with the analgesic efficacy of plasters. conclusions .
physicians may improve patient satisfaction by discussing analgesic efficacy , skin complications , and price with patients before prescription .
1. introduction topical plasters containing nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are designed to relieve pain of musculoskeletal origin and are indicated for a wide variety of diseases .
they are frequently used as a route of administration of analgesics in japan .
causing gastrointestinal complications less frequently than oral analgesics , nsaid plasters are safer for elderly patients [ 1 , 2 ] and will likely be used more frequently as society ages .
many previous studies have reported on the pharmacological strengths of nsaid plasters , which include analgesic efficacy and reduced side effects [ 3 , 4 ] .
however , few studies have considered which aspects of these plasters concern the patients who actually use them , for example , usability , treatment expectations , and satisfaction [ 5 ] .
it has been reported that only 19 % of people suffering from chronic musculoskeletal pain seek medical care , compared to 20 % who seek alternative therapies such as massage and acupuncture [ 6 ] .
such results are suggestive of a lack of efficacy or satisfaction from medical treatment in these conditions .
aiming to examine factors that could potentially raise patient satisfaction with nsaid plasters , we conducted two online surveys that enquired with patients and physicians about their treatment expectations of , and satisfaction with , such medications and compared their responses .
2. subjects and methods 2.1 .
patient survey our patient survey was an online survey run for six days ( march 25 - 30 , 2015 ) , administered using an existing mailing list of people in the general population. of the 12,083 respondents , those who were not currently using nsaid plasters were excluded .
the eligible respondents were stratified by age ( 20 - 44 , 45 - 59 , and 60 - 89 y ) and sex .
the first 100 were included in each respective age group of both sexes for a total of 600 ( average age = 53.2 y ) .
after 100 respondents were included for each category , further responses were excluded .
questionnaire items asked patients about the department or clinic that prescribed their nsaid plasters , the site and intensity of their pain , their pain management strategy , expectations and satisfaction of treatment with nsaid plasters , and their mental associations with the expression " comfort " when applied ( multiple responses allowed ) .
2.2 .
physician survey our physician survey was an online survey run for three days ( march 25 - 27 , 2015 ) , administered using an existing mailing list of physicians. of the 995 respondents , those who prescribed nsaid plasters to more than 50 patients in the past month were included .
the respondents were sorted by specialty and practice type ( outpatient clinic or hospital ) .
50 respondents who specialized in orthopedics and general practice ( the specialties that most often treat musculoskeletal pain ) for each practice type were chosen in chronological order for a total of 200 physicians .
after 50 respondents were included for each category , further responses were excluded .
questionnaire items asked physicians about their affiliated clinical department , their concerns and priorities when prescribing nsaid plasters , their satisfaction with existing drugs , their estimations of patient satisfaction , and specific factors that they associate with the expression " comfort " when applied .
the types and available formulations of the plasters included in this survey are shown in table 1 .
the specific dose and location of application were not included in the questionnaire .
this study was approved by the hirosaki university graduate school of medicine ethics committee .
3. results 3.1 .
patient survey 223 ( 37.2 %) patients used nsaid plasters in combination with oral analgesics .
the prescribing entity was most commonly a physician from an orthopedic surgery department ( 67 %) , followed by general internal medicine department ( 17 %) , general surgery department ( 3 %) , and other departments ( 1 % each ) .
in terms of frequency of use , 31 % of patients used nsaid plasters almost every day , while 35 % used them 1 - 3 times per week .
patients most frequently reported pain in their lower back ( 68.3 %) , followed by the shoulder ( 58.0 %) , the knee ( 38.2 %) , and the neck ( 37.8 %) .
74.7 % of patients complained of pain at multiple sites ( table 2 ) .
women had a higher incidence of shoulder and knee pain .
incidence of knee pain increased with each rise in age group , while neck pain decreased .
differences in the pain management strategy due to the pain site were observed , with patients visiting medical institutions most frequently for lower back pain ( 82.9 %) and least frequently for hip - joint pain ( 54.1 %) ( table 3 ) .
items related to analgesic efficacy were highly ranked among patients' desired characteristics of nsaid plasters , including strong pain relief ( 73.0 %) , length of action ( 57.8 %) , and early onset of action ( 57.2 %) .
the next most desired characteristics were avoiding skin irritation ( 56.3 %) and low price ( 38.3 %) ( figure 1 ) .
young adult patients prioritized medication price higher than older patients ; all other desirable aspects were more frequently cited by older patients .
patients' perceptions of nsaid plasters' analgesic effects differed by the affected site .
although 20 - 33 % responded that they did not feel any noticeable improvement , the majority of patients reported improvement of symptoms ( table 4 ). with regard to nsaid plasters' analgesic effects , 43.0 % of patients responded that they were either satisfied or somewhat satisfied , while the remaining 57.0 % were either ambivalent or unsatisfied .
patients also reported that they were satisfied with plasters' characteristics in terms of avoiding skin irritation ( 49.0 %) , comfort when applied ( 50.0 %) , and price ( 37.0 %) ( figure 2 ) .
3.2 .
physician survey in the second survey , 34.5 % of physicians reported analgesic effects to be the single most important characteristic desired of nsaid plasters .
the next most frequent response was whether the nsaid plaster matched their patient 's preference ( 26.5 %) , followed by safety to skin ( 12.0 %) and comfort when applied ( 12.0 %) ( figure 3 ) .
57.5 % responded that they were satisfied or somewhat satisfied with plasters' analgesic effects .
56.0 % were satisfied or somewhat satisfied with comfort when applied , while 39.0 % were satisfied with the drugs' prices ( figure 4 ) .
satisfaction with price was low , but the majority of physicians were ambivalent to this factor , reflecting the low priority among physicians .
both patients and physicians were asked about specific factors that they associate with the expression " comfort " when applied .
the responses most frequently seen were " not irritating to skin " ( patients = 51.0 % , physicians = 49.3 %) , " not itchy " ( 47.0 % , 45.0 %) , " no discomfort " ( 49.5 % , 53.0 %) , and " easy to apply " ( 48.5 % , 41.2 %) ( multiple responses allowed ) .
physicians also associated the term " comfort " with adhesiveness , but fewer patients felt the same ( 52.0 % , 35.0 % , resp . )
( figure 5 ) .
4. discussion respondents to our patient survey reported lower - back pain most frequently , followed by pain in the shoulder , knee , and neck , while 74.7 % complained of pain at multiple sites .
in addition , large differences were observed in rates of visitation to medical institutions depending on the pain site , from a maximum of 82.9 % of all patients with lower - back pain to a minimum of 54.1 % of all patients with hip - joint pain .
this suggests that patients may have different expectations of medical care depending on the site of their pain and may in some cases choose other treatments such as alternative therapies .
patients using nsaid plasters who visited medical institutions comprised a higher proportion of our patient population than in past studies .
this is likely because we specifically administered our survey to patients who were prescribed nsaid plasters at a medical institution .
the development and spread of transdermal nsaid plasters have followed a unique path in japan .
they are a frequently prescribed mode of administration for nsaids in japan today , owing to a lower incidence of systemic adverse effects and superior safety of topical administration [ 2 , 3 ] .
the north american and european literature lacks studies on nsaid adhesive plasters , focusing on topical agents instead in the form of gels and creams .
some differences between ointments and plasters exist , but both of these topical agents have been shown to be noninferior in analgesic efficacy to oral analgesics [ 2 , 7 - 9 ] .
extensive literature exists on the analgesic efficacy of nsaid topical agents for osteoarthritis of the knee .
in their 2014 guidelines , osteoarthritis research society international ( oarsi ) recommends that patients use topical agents for relief of pain due to knee osteoarthritis , citing superior safety and comparable pain relief to oral analgesics [ 10 ] .
our survey revealed that both patients and physicians prioritized analgesic efficacy highest among the desirable characteristics of nsaid plasters .
moving forward , we believe that a detailed examination of the efficacy of nsaid plasters according to specific diseases and disease severity , in combination with the continued development of topical agents with even stronger analgesic efficacy , will help to further improve patient satisfaction .
both patients and physicians viewed safety to skin as an important characteristic for nsaid plasters .
this may reflect the fact that 39.3 % of patients have experienced some form of skin complication due to the use of nsaid plaster medications [ 11 ] .
after analgesic efficacy and skin complications , we found that patients were most concerned with drug prices .
low price was of least concern to physicians among desirable characteristics of nsaid plasters , evidencing a marked difference between the concerns of patients and physicians which may have led to the difference in satisfaction of this aspect .
desire for lower prices was most pronounced in younger patients .
this may be due to the japanese medical system , where younger patients pay 30 % of their medication costs , while the elderly pay less according to age .
these results suggest that considering medication costs may lead to more patient - orientated prescription practices .
further , development of generic medications will reduce the costs and create greater patient choice , increasing the physician 's capability to increase patients' satisfaction concerning drug costs when providing patients with pain management strategies .
patient - physician differences in satisfaction were also observed for other items .
a mere 43.0 % of patients were satisfied with nsaid plasters' analgesic efficacy , compared with the estimated satisfaction rate of 57.5 % in physicians , suggesting patients may be less satisfied with the treatment than physicians perceive .
failure to meet patients' treatment expectations and functional status have been raised as factors that reduce patient satisfaction in general practice [ 12 ] .
skin plasters have been shown to provide comparable analgesic efficacy to oral dosage forms , but patients reported low satisfaction with the former in this study .
this may have resulted from individual differences in patients' expectations of treatment efficacy , or in the severity of their preexisting conditions .
also , this study did not include a control group of oral analgesics alone or alternative therapies , so a comparison between modes of therapy was not possible .
we believe physicians should fully explain to patients the analgesic efficacy they can expect of nsaid plasters , as well as their limitations , in light of their specific musculoskeletal conditions and severity .
fewer than half of patients and physicians were satisfied with nsaid plasters in terms of their safety to skin , suggesting there is room for improvement in the design of transdermal plasters .
also , 40 % of patients responded that they do not report side effects and preferences to their physician .
when considered with the low utilization of medical facilities , side effects and dissatisfaction with plasters are likely to be underrepresented and underrecognized .
in light of this , there may be a role for the pharmacist who can educate the patient concerning proper usage and side effects .
pharmacies are more easily accessible and usually have information of medications for multiple medical facilities , making them ideal for identifying and differentiating adverse effects and drug interactions .
only 20 % of physicians considered extradermal side effects , and 1.5 % responded that they were the most desired characteristics .
although nsaid plasters are systemically absorbed , systemic side effects are rare .
evans reported that topical nsaids did not increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a case - control study [ 13 ] .
the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to nsaids is said to be dose dependent , suggesting that topical formulations used in excess or absorbed more efficiently may cause harm .
in addition , non - dose - dependent side effects should be taken into account , as topical nsaids are contraindicated in patients with aspirin - exacerbated asthma and pregnant women .
renal side effects have also been associated with topical nsaid use [ 14 ] , necessitating physicians to be knowledgeable of systemic absorption .
50.0 % of patients were satisfied with the comfort of nsaid plasters .
there was a high degree of agreement between patients' and physicians' perception of " comfort " when applied , which may have contributed to a higher satisfaction rate .
a factor that was not taken into account was the relationship between adhesiveness and climate .
japan has a very diverse climate , so the temperature and humidity may vary greatly between geographic locations at any given time .
clothing and perspiration may also affect the adhesiveness of plasters and influence satisfaction .
this study was not designed to assess differences between locations , but from the available data , there was no difference in responses concerning satisfaction in comfort and the perception of adhesiveness between regions .
this may be due to the availability of various sizes , thicknesses , and adhesiveness , which patients may choose for their specific needs .
indeed , 101 ( 16.8 %) of respondents used multiple types of plasters .
musculoskeletal pain is extremely common : according to the 2013 national livelihood survey , respective reported incidences for men and women were 9.22 % and 11.82 % for lower - back pain , 6.02 % and 12.50 % for stiff shoulders , and 4.18 % and 7.03 % for limb - joint pain , respectively .
however , a mere 4.22 % of men and 5.85 % of women visit medical facilities because of lower - back pain .
one study found that only 19 % of people visit a medical facility to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain , while 20 % use alternative therapies ( i.e. , massage , physical therapy , and acupuncture ) and 55 % do not consult with a physician at all [ 6 ] .
the findings of these previous studies suggest low patient expectation with medical care for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain ; the findings of our study corroborate them .
our investigation had several limitations : as it was an internet survey , we did not directly examine patients and could not confirm the diagnosis of the underlying diseases .
in addition , while 37.3 % of patients were taking oral medication in combination with an nsaid plaster , we did not examine the details of their oral medication regimen .
also , as we did not have a control group , we could not compare the satisfaction between different treatment modalities ( i.e. , plasters , oral medications , and alternative therapies ) .
5. conclusions the most desirable characteristics of nsaid plasters according to both patients and physicians were strong analgesic efficacy and avoidance of skin complications .
patients and physicians had relatively high satisfaction with " comfort " of plasters , and their conceptions of the term had much in common .
we conclude that when prescribing transdermal nsaid plasters , physicians should be knowledgeable about their analgesic effects , potential skin complications , and prices .
sufficiently explaining these aspects to patients , along with prescribing in consideration of underlying diseases , should accordingly lead to increased satisfaction .
" high - absorption " transdermal plasters have been recently developed , which allow for high absorption of nsaids into the skin [ 15 , 16 ] : their increased efficacy may improve patient satisfaction .
if they can obviate the need for oral intake of nsaids , such plasters may reduce the incidence of adverse gastrointestinal events .
conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest .

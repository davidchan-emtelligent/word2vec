hepatitis e virus macaca mulatta genotype dear editor , one of the five known hepatitis viruses that can infect humans is hepatitis e virus ( hev ) .
the first documented infection that was caused by hev occurred in 1955 during an outbreak in new delhi , india [ 1 ] .
hev is a small nonenveloped particle that belongs to the family hepeviridae and the genus hepevirus .
its single - stranded rna genome has approximately 7200 base pairs [ 2 ]. by genomic sequence analysis , there are four genotypes [ 1 ][ 2 ][ 3 ][ 4 ] and at least 24 subgenotypes ( 1a - 1e , 2a - 2b , 3a - 3j , and 4a - 4g ) of hev in humans and other mammals [ 4 ] .
avian isolates of hev were initially proposed to constitute the fifth genotype of hev ; but , due to their shorter genome and low homology with mammalian isolates , they have been categorized as a member of a separate genus [ 3 ] .
hev genotypes 1 and 2 are limited to humans , and genotypes 3 and 4 are common between humans and other mammalian species [ 5 ] .
domestic animals , especially pigs , are the principal animal reservoirs for hev [ 6 ] , as are , to a lesser extent , boar , deer , rabbits , and rats [ 7 ][ 8 ] .
in a study in china , a serum positivity test for anti - hev antibodies was performed for farm animals .
the highest positive rates of serum anti - hev were detected in swine ( 81.17 %) , rabbit ( 54.62 %) , and cattle ( 25.29 %) [ 9 ] .
several animal species , such as chimpanzees ; rhesus and cynomolgus macaques ; and , more recently , pigs , rabbits , and chickens , have been used as animal models to study different aspects of hev infection and for vaccine trials [ 10 ] .
despite supporting hev replication and producing antibodies against the virus , there are insufficient studies on the capacity of monkeys to serve as natural reservoirs for the virus .
huang et al. in a study on hev seroepidemiology in china , found anti - hev igg and igm in the serum of rhesus monkeys ( macaca mulatta ) but not hev rna in their stool [ 11 ] .
regarding the possibility of cross - species infection between wild animals or between human and animals , such as on farms , knowledge of the seroepidemiology of the virus and its natural reservoirs seems to be essential .
workers at pig farms and slaughterhouse workers have twice the level of anti - hev compared with the general population [ 9 ] .
this may indicate the role of zoonotic infection by hev .
this is important , especially in xenotransplantations [ 12 ] .
another study showed that in an area with both swine and macaca mulatta , antibodies against hev were present in both groups .
however , despite the detection of swine hev genotype 4 rna in stool specimens , the same assay was negative for macaca mulatta .
swine hev can infect nonhuman primates ; cross - species transmission of the virusis possible [ 12 ] , although positive antibody detection can also be due to the existence of hev - like proteins [ 11 ][ 13 ] or incomplete replication of swine hev in macaca mulatta .
genomic changes ( mutation or recombination ) in the viral genome can lead to new genotype or subgenotype generations , rendering them undetectable by existing molecular approaches .
although the role of macaca mulatta as a natural reservoir for hev has been failed [ 11 ] , its seropositivity for viral antibodies against hev should not be underestimated .
thus , more studies are necessary to define hev seroepidemiology in nonhuman hosts .

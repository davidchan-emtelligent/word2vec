objectives to establish a trend in admissions by month , over 6 months for unplanned surgical admissions to a london fringe hospital & to determine : . mortality rates for the unplanned admissions ; compare to previous figures in 2008 and the intensive care national audit & research centre ( icnarc ) 2012 report .
.
mortality while on critical care , mortality from discharge to ward & discharge from hospital .
.
length of stay & apache ii scores by outcome for unplanned surgical admissions .
.
volume of patients by speciality & survival to discharge from hospital by surgical speciality .
methods this is a retrospective analysis of 142 unplanned surgical admissions over 6 months , from 1st july - 31st december 2013 , in a london fringe hospital with a 12 bed critical care unit .
a database was developed on excel using coded data & contained the breakdown of each admission , expected outcome predicted by apache ii score , outcomes including mortality on itu / hdu , mortality after discharge to ward & the length of stay by outcome for each of the admissions .
the icnarc 2012 data on similar sized units was analysed & the 2008 study from the same trust reviewed .
we compared to icnarc data & the local results from 2008 to assess how the unit is performing regarding patient outcomes & to see what , if any , changes had occurred since 2008 .
results conclusions despite an increased demand , the overall outcomes compare favourably with national standards , & previous figures from 2008 .
currently patient outcome is not jeopardised by the increased demand on the service .
however , if the trend of increasing critical care admissions ( planned or unplanned ) is to continue at this rate the evidence suggests that good outcomes are unlikely to remain [ 2 ]. the study also reveals the largest contributing speciality to unplanned admissions was general surgery & we noted a curious trending of admissions in october / november , which warrants further analysis .

psms have multiple functions in staphylococcal pathogenesis ; for example , they lyse red and white blood cells and trigger inflammatory responses .
compared to other psms , delta - toxin is usually more strongly expressed but has only moderate cytolytic capacities .
the amino acid sequences of s. aureus psms are well conserved with two exceptions , one of which is the delta - toxin allelic variant g10s .
this variant is a characteristic of the subspecies s. argenteus and s. aureus sequence types st1 and st59 , the latter representing the most frequent cause of community - associated infections in asia .
delta - toxin g10s and strains expressing that variant from plasmids or the genome had significantly reduced cytolytic and pro - inflammatory capacities , including in a strain background with pronounced production of other psms .
however , in murine infection models , isogenic strains expressing the two delta - toxin variants did not cause measurable differences in disease severity .
our findings indicate that the widespread g10s allelic variation of the delta - toxin locus has a significant impact on key pathogenesis mechanisms , but more potent members of the psm peptide family may overshadow that impact in vivo .
many members of the genus staphylococcus are important human pathogens .
staphylococcus aureus in particular causes a multitude of frequently severe and life - threatening diseases , with acute disease promoted by a series of secreted toxins and other virulence determinants12 .
in addition , s. aureus and coagulase - negative staphylococci , such as staphylococcus epidermidis , are a premier cause of hospital - associated infections on indwelling medical devices3 .
while virulence of s. aureus is clearly multi - factorial , the phenol - soluble modulin ( psm ) peptide family has recently been identified as a key contributor to infection with highly virulent s. aureus strains , such as community - associated methicillin - resistant s. aureus ( ca - mrsa ) 456 .
psms are short peptides that are under strict regulation by the agr quorum - sensing system7 and secreted by a dedicated transporter without a signal peptide8 .
they can be grouped into the shorter (~ 25 amino acid ) alpha - type peptides , which in s. aureus comprise the psmalpha1 through psmalpha4 peptides and the delta - toxin , and the longer (~ 45 amino acid ) beta - type peptides , of which two ( psmbeta1 , psmbeta2 ) are produced by s. aureus4 .
an additional psm peptide , psm - mec , is encoded on the meticillin resistance cassette sccmec and only produced by a certain group of meticillin - resistant s. aureus7 .
the psmalpha peptides in particular strongly impact the capacity of ca - mrsa strains to lyse human neutrophils and other cell types , and promote skin infection and bacteraemia5 .
less virulent hospital - associated strains characteristically produce smaller amounts of those peptide toxins59 .
in addition to their cytolytic potential , psm peptides promote inflammatory responses by activating the formyl peptide receptor 2 ( fpr2 ) 10 .
furthermore , they contribute to biofilm structuring , detachment , and the systemic dissemination of biofilm - associated infection1112 .
moreover , some psms may exhibit antimicrobial functions , for example toward streptococcus pyogenes1314 .
the delta - toxin is the member of the psm family that has been known for the longest time .
originally believed to be a large protein , it is in fact a peptide that tends to oligomerize1516 .
it is encoded within rnaiii , the regulatory molecule of the accessory gene regulator ( agr ) quorum - sensing system17 .
notably , despite frequent incorrect annotation in data banks , the delta - toxin does not contain a signal peptide , but is a 26 amino acid long peptide that - as the other members of the psm family - is secreted as the primary translation product with an n - terminal n - formyl methionine8 .
variants of the delta - toxin with often highly similar peptide sequences are present in many staphylococcal species18 .
the delta - toxin is usually the most strongly produced psm peptide and in many strains by far the most abundant secreted protein5819 .
while known for many years , the specific functions of the delta - toxin in pathogenesis and physiology have remained largely obscure .
previous correlative analyses between pathogenesis phenotypes and delta - toxin production hardly allow conclusions on the specific function of delta - toxin , because delta - toxin is agr - regulated in the same way as many other toxins , including , most notably , psms717 .
however , the discovery of psms also triggered a more detailed investigation of the contribution of delta - toxin to pathogenesis .
to that end , isogenic hld mutants were constructed with start codon mutations , abolishing translation but maintaining the function of rnaiii5 .
compared to other alpha - type psms , delta - toxin has generally more moderate potency5 .
it is somewhat cytolytic to neutrophils and erythrocytes and has moderate capacity to stimulate fpr2510 .
accordingly , an isogenic delta - toxin production mutant ( genomic hld start codon mutant ) in the community - associated meticillin - resistant s. aureus ( ca - mrsa ) strain mw2 only showed a slight impact on disease progression in a murine bacteraemia model , especially when compared to the strong contribution of the psmalpha locus ( encoding psmalpha1 through psmalpha4 ) , and no impact on skin infection in the usa300 ( lac ) ca - mrsa background5 .
the first truly delta - toxin - specific function has only recently been discovered .
the delta - toxin , but not other psms , triggers mast cell degranulation and thus has a significant contribution to the development of the skin disease , atopic dermatitis20 .
here we analysed the effect that the only widespread allelic variant of the delta - toxin locus , delta - toxin g10s , has on cytolytic and pro - inflammatory properties , and whether the changed properties that we found translate to a significant impact on disease progression in animal infection models .
results the g10s allelic variant of delta - toxin is a characteristic of st1 and st59 isolates the analysis of available s. aureus genomes , as well as high pressure liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry ( hplc / ms ) analysis of many s. aureus culture filtrates that we performed over the years , revealed the presence of two main allelic variants among s. aureus psm peptides .
one is the psmalpha3 variant psmalpha3n22y that is characteristically present in clonal complex ( cc ) 30 and on which we reported earlier21 .
the other is due to a non - synonymous mutation in the hld gene ( from the glycine codon ggt to the serine codon agt ) , leading to a delta - toxin ( hld ) peptide with a serine instead of glycine at position 10 ( hldg10s ) ( fig. 1a,b ) .
this allelic variant is found in 41 published genomes or genome projects , including notable st1 and st59 strains , such as , st59 strains m01322 , sa26823 , sa4024 , and sa95724 , and st1 strains mw225 and mssa47626 , in addition to the new sub - species " staphylococcus argenteus " [ s. aureus clonal complex ( cc ) 75 ] 27 .
st59 is the most frequent lineage causing methicillin - susceptible and methicillin - resistant community - associated ( ca ) infections in china and adjacent asian countries28 .
we analysed a series of st59 isolates ( 8 from china and 13 from san francisco ) , all of which showed the characteristic mass of the g10s variant of delta - toxin upon hplc / ms analysis , indicating that this variant is a characteristic of that successful lineage. of note , we never found hldg10s in many s. aureus isolates that we analysed by hplc / ms over recent years other than those of the st1 or st59 lineages .
( we did not analyse s. argenteus or other cc75 isolates by hplc / ms. ) together , these findings indicate that hldg10s is characteristic of a genetic subset of s. aureus ( including st1 and st59 ) and the subspecies s. argenteus .
hldg10s has decreased cytolytic capacity at micromolar concentrations , many alpha - type psms are strongly cytolytic towards many types of eukaryotic cells , which include human erythrocytes and neutrophils519 .
this mechanism of action is believed to play an important role in the progression of staphylococcal disease6 .
to determine if there are differences in the lytic activities between hld and hldg10s , we compared ( i ) synthetic peptides , ( ii ) culture supernatants of s. aureus strains expressing those peptides from plasmids in a psm - negative background ( strain usa300 lac with all psm genes deleted and translation of hld abolished , lac deltaalphabetahld or deltapsm ) , or ( iii ) culture supernatant of the st1 strain mw2 ( hldg10s ) in comparison to that from an isogenic mutant that was engineered to express " normal " hld from the genome .
the genetically altered mw2 strain , mw2 * , produced amounts of hld that were equal to those of hldg10s produced by the isogenic strain mw2 ( fig. 1c ) .
furthermore , production of other psms was unaltered .
however , when the delta - toxin variants were expressed from plasmids , we observed a somewhat stronger production of hldg10s than hld from the same strain and plasmid background ( fig. 1d ) .
lysis of human neutrophils was significantly decreased with synthetic hldg10s ( fig. 2a ) and with culture filtrates of strains expressing that peptide from a plasmid ( fig. 2b ) or the genome ( fig. 2c ) as compared to hld and isogenic strains expressing hld .
similarly , lysis of human erythrocytes was significantly decreased with culture filtrates containing hldg10s ( fig. 3b,c ) .
however , there was no significant difference using synthetic hldg10s peptide ( fig. 3a ) , possibly indicating that the difference in erythrocyte lysis observed with culture filtrates is due to synergistic haemolytic activity of delta - toxin with other toxins .
together , these findings show that the cytolytic properties of strains expressing hldg10s are significantly lower than of those expressing hld , which at least in the case of lytic activity toward neutrophils is due to differential cytolytic properties of the hld and hldg10s peptides .
hldg10s has decreased chemotactic activity calcium ion influx has been used as readout for the pro - inflammatory capacity psms exert on human neutrophils10 .
ca2 + influx was significantly decreased with synthetic hldg10s compared to hld , indicating significantly different capacities of hld and hldg10s to stimulate fpr2 ( fig. 4a ) .
chemotactic activity toward neutrophils is one of the most prominent pro - inflammatory functions that psms trigger via interaction with fpr210 .
therefore , we measured chemotaxis of human neutrophils to investigate whether the hldg10s allelic variant has different pro - inflammatory capacity than hld .
synthetic hldg10s and culture filtrates of mw2 ( expressing hldg10s ) had significantly decreased chemotactic activity compared to hld and culture filtrates of mw2 * ( expressing hld ) , respectively ( fig. 4b - d ) .
activity was not changed comparing culture filtrates of the plasmid - harbouring strains , which , however , may be due to the somewhat higher production of hldg10s as compared to hld that we observed with those constructs ( fig. 1c ) .
these findings show that the fpr2 - mediated pro - inflammatory capacity of hldg10s is lower than that of hld .
hldg10s does not cause a change in mast cell degranulation , biofilm formation , cell spreading or antimicrobial activity all psms including delta - toxin impact biofilm structuring and detachment in a way that leads to extended biofilm formation in their absence1129 .
therefore , we tested whether there is a difference in biofilm formation between the isogenic mw2 strain pair expressing hld versus hldg10s .
however , semi - quantitative biofilm assays did not reveal differences in biofilm formation due to the delta - toxin allelic variation ( fig. 5a ) .
some psms , including delta - toxin , have antimicrobial activities , in particular against steptococcus pyogenes1314 .
however , there no antimicrobial activity was detected with considerable amounts of either hld or hldg10s ( data not shown ) .
psms are believed to contribute to the commensal lifestyle of staphylococci by promoting emulsification of nutrients and cell spreading on surfaces3031 .
in the case of delta - toxin , contradictory results have been obtained depending on whether synthetic peptide was used or delta - toxin - expressing strains3032 .
our results using isogenic delta - toxin - expressing and control strains reflected those by omae et al.32 , inasmuch as the delta - toxin expressing strains spread less than the control strain .
however , no differences in cell spreading were observed comparing mw2 ( hldg10s ) and mw2 * ( hld ) or isogenic psm - free strains complemented with plasmids expressing hld or hldg10s ( fig. 5b ) .
recently , delta - toxin was found to be a key factor promoting pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by causing degranulation of mast cells20 .
differences in mast cell degranulation comparing hldg10s and hld peptides were very small , and absent comparing mw2 ( hldg10s ) and mw2 * ( hld ) culture filtrates ( fig. 5c,d ) .
the somewhat higher degranulation values by culture filtrates of the strain expressing hldg10s from a plasmid , as compared to the strain expressing hld ( fig. 5e ) , were in the range to be explained by the abovementioned differences in expression levels ( fig. 1c ) .
these findings indicate that mast cell degranulation , biofilm formation , cell spreading , and antimicrobial activity are not impacted significantly by the hldg10s allelic variation .
the hldg10s variation does not significantly impact s. aureus experimental infection among widespread s. aureus toxins , those with the most prominent impact on key s. aureus infection types like skin and blood infection , are psmalpha peptides and alpha - toxin5333435 .
nevertheless , we previously showed that abolishing translation of delta - toxin in strain mw2 also has a significant , yet less pronounced , impact on mortality in a murine bacteraemia model5 .
therefore , we analysed whether the hldg10s variation present in strain mw2 has an impact on disease in murine blood ( fig. 6a ) and skin ( fig. 6b ) infection models as compared to the isogenic mw2 * strain altered to express hld .
furthermore , we included the sensitive renal abscess model to best detect possibly only subtle differences ( fig. 6c ) .
we did not detect significant differences in disease severity between mice infected with the mw2 or mw2 * strains in any of the three infection models .
interestingly , strain mw2 was about as virulent in the renal abscess and blood infection models as strain lac ( usa300 ) , but much less virulent in the skin infection model .
discussion over the last years , psms have been increasingly recognized as important factors affecting both the commensal and infectious lifestyles of staphylococci46 .
acute virulence of s. aureus in particular is to a large extent defined by production of the cytolytic psmalpha peptides53637 .
cytolytic and pro - inflammatory capacities of the delta - toxin are in the range of other alpha - type psms , but fall short of reaching the strong potencies of , for example , psmalpha3 of s. aureus or psmdelta of s. epidermidis519 .
nevertheless , delta - toxin has been shown to impact s. aureus blood infection even in the background of a strain producing considerable levels of more potent psms5 .
furthermore , it has recently been demonstrated to be critical for the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis by degranulation of mast cells20 , a feature not observed with other s. aureus psms .
here we analysed available genome sequences and performed hplc / ms , showing that s. aureus st1 and st59 strains , and s. argenteus , produce an allelic variant of delta - toxin , hldg10s .
according to our analyses , hldg10s represents the only widespread allelic variant of a psm peptide in s. aureus other than the psmalpha3n22y variant present in cc30 strains21 .
hldg10s generally had decreased aggressive potencies , such as lower cytolytic activity and reduced chemotactic activity toward human neutrophils .
notably , these differences were also observed in an isogenic strain pair producing either of the two variants in a background with otherwise strong psm production5 , indicating that the allelic variation may influence pathogenesis phenotypes in vivo .
however , despite the key role of neutrophils in the defence against s. aureus infection38 , we could not detect differences between disease phenotypes elicited by this isogenic strain pair in several murine infection models .
we believe that this is due to the generally limited impact of delta - toxin on s. aureus infection as compared to other , more potent psms5 and other toxins such as alpha - toxin3539 .
furthermore , the delta - toxin allelic variants did not differentially impact mast cell degranulation as the only known pathogenesis mechanism that is specifically influenced by delta - toxin among psms20 .
this indicates that differences in the capacities of s. aureus strains to stimulate inflammation during atopic dermatitis are not linked to allelic variation of delta - toxin .
interestingly , our haemolysis data suggest that the differential impact on erythrocyte lysis between the two delta - toxin variants may be due to synergistic activities rather than differences in the lytic activities of delta - toxin itself , a phenomenon that remains to be explored further .
possible interaction partners of delta - toxin in the used mw2 strain background are alpha - toxin and leukotoxins , such as the panton - valentine leukocidin ( pvl ) , for which synergistic activity with other psms has been described40 .
notably , strain mw2 does not produce beta - toxin , a protein known to show synergistic hemolysis with delta - toxin4142 .
in conclusion , our study shows that the allelic variant of the s. aureus delta - toxin hldg10s is a characteristic of specific s. aureus lineages , among which st59 is the most epidemiologically important .
it significantly impacts cytolytic and pro - inflammatory properties , also when tested in a natural strain background with pronounced general production of psms .
while these differences did not translate into measurable differences in the tested animal infection models , the differential activities of hldg10s may well influence disease progression under different conditions or in strains with lower production of other psms .

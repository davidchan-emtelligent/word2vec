background continuum of care has the potential to improve maternal , newborn , and child health ( mnch ) by ensuring care for mothers and children .
continuum of care in mnch is widely accepted as comprising sequential time ( from pre - pregnancy to motherhood and childhood ) and space dimensions ( from community - family care to clinical care ) .
however , it is unclear which linkages of care could have a greater effect on mnch outcomes .
the objective of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of different continuum of care linkages for reducing neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality in low - and middle - income countries .
methods we searched for randomized and quasi - randomized controlled trials that addressed two or more linkages of continuum of care and attempted to increase mothers' uptake of antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care .
the outcome variables were neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality .
results out of the 7,142 retrieved articles , we selected 19 as eligible for the final analysis. of these studies , 13 used packages of intervention that linked antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care .
one study each used packages that linked antenatal care and skilled birth attendance or skilled birth attendance and postnatal care .
four studies used an intervention package that linked antenatal care and postnatal care .
among the packages that linked antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care , a significant reduction was observed in combined neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality risks ( rr 0.83 ; 95 % ci 0.77 to 0.89 , i2 79 %) .
furthermore , this linkage reduced combined neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality when integrating the continuum of care space dimension ( rr 0.85 ; 95 % ci 0.77 to 0.93 , i2 81 %) .
conclusions our review suggests that continuous uptake of antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care is necessary to improve mnch outcomes in low - and middle - income countries .
the review was conclusive for the reduction of neonatal and perinatal deaths .
although maternal deaths were not significantly reduced , composite measures of all mortality were .
thus , the evidence is sufficient to scale up this intervention package for the improvement of mnch outcomes .

introduction the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) call for reducing global maternal and child mortality by 2015 .
however , worldwide , approximately 289,000 women still died in 2013 due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth [ 1 , 2 ] .
about 99 % of such deaths occurred in low - and middle - income countries ( lmics ) [ 1 ] .
furthermore , the total number of under - five children 's deaths was 6.6 million in 2013 , of which 80 % occurred within 48 hours postpartum [ 1 ] .
only one - third of the 68 countdown countries are on track to achieve mdg4 ( reduce child mortality ) , and the average annual rate of decline is far below that needed for mdg5 ( improve maternal health ) [ 1 ] .
to improve maternal , neonatal , and child health ( mnch ) , various interventions have been recommended .
however , most of the over 190 mnch studies addressed only a single intervention [ 3 - 8 ] - - few of them looked at how these interventions could be combined .
moreover , mnch care programs are often vertical in nature ; because newborn health is largely dependent on maternal health , care for both the mother and newborns should be provided in a continuous manner [ 9 ] .
indeed , around 20 % of diseases among infants can be attributed to the mother 's poor health status , malnutrition , and inadequate care during the perinatal period [ 10 ] .
for instance , maternal treatment of infectious diseases such as hiv and malaria influences infants' health [ 11 , 12 ] .
the continuum of care has been well known as a potential means of improving mnch through integrated service delivery [ 13 - 15 ] .
recent mnch studies have begun to focus more on interventions to strengthen continuum of care [ 16 , 17 ] , although researchers have yet to establish a clear definition of continuum of care [ 3 , 14 ] .
in mnch , continuum of care has two core dimensions : sequential time and space [ 3 , 14 , 15 , 18 ] .
the time dimension includes service delivery from pre - pregnancy to childhood , while the space dimension includes community - family care , outreach - outpatient care , and clinical care [ 19 ] .
previous studies estimated that up to 67 % of neonatal deaths could be prevented by improving the coverage of common mnch care to 90 % of reproductive age women [ 7 , 20 ] .
however , as resources are limited , providing all possible mnch services is unrealistic , particularly in lmics .
for instance , about 0.68 - 1.32 billion usd was required for providing a total continuum of care package from antenatal care to postnatal care to avert 38 - 67 % of neonatal deaths in sub - saharan africa [ 20 ] .
as such , identifying the most effective mnch package must be prioritized in health policies to ensure more effective use of continuum of care .
the frequency and timing of care delivery are important considerations in defining continuum of care .
the recommended standards of mnch care are as follows : ( 1 ) four antenatal care visits [ 21 - 24 ] ; ( 2 ) delivery assisted by skilled birth attendants [ 25 - 27 ] ; and ( 3 ) postnatal care within 48 hours [ 28 - 32 ] , ( 4 ) at seven days [ 31 , 33 - 37 ] , and ( 5 ) at six weeks [ 31 ] .
regarding antenatal care , fewer visits have often been the standard in lmic trials [ 24 ] .
compared to five antenatal care visits , fewer than five antenatal care visits does not significantly increase maternal and neonatal mortality [ 21 , 38 ] , which led the world health organization ( who ) to define four antenatal care visits as the standard in their guidelines [ 39 ] .
however , both the frequency and timing of antenatal care are inconsistently applied in different mnch interventions [ 40 ] .
postnatal care frequency and timing are also inconsistent , possibly due to changes in global postnatal care recommendations .
the who 's practical guidelines from 1998 encourage mothers with babies to access postnatal care services at " six hours , six days , six weeks , and six months " [ 41 ] .
this formula targeted " crucial " moments of need for the mother and baby , though rigorous evidence was absent .
since then , different frequencies and timings have been recommended : in 2006 , the timings were within the first week , preferably 2 - 3 days after delivery , and 4 - 6 weeks [ 42 ] , and in 2009 , within the first 24 hours after birth , on day three , and on day seven , if necessary [ 30 ] .
this was based on evidence indicating high maternal deaths on the first and second days after birth [ 43 ] .
additionally , almost 40 % of under - five deaths occur within the first 28 days of life [ 30 , 44 ] , and three - quarters of neonatal deaths occur during the first week of life , with 25 - 45 % in the first 24 hours [ 37 ] .
thus , we need to examine whether these standards for frequency and timing of care delivery should be considered in defining the continuum of care .
although the expectation for continuum of care effectiveness is high and interventions have been planned , we found no prior review article or review protocol in this area .
comprehending the effectiveness of continuum of care linkages will encourage further opportunities for intervening in mnch care and guide in tailoring interventions .
thus , in this systematic review and meta - analysis , we quantitatively synthesized evidence proposing effective linkages of continuum of care .
our focus was which linkages reduce neonatal , perinatal , or maternal mortality in lmics in the continuum of care time and space dimension stages .
materials and methods we conducted a systematic review according to the guidelines of the cochrane collaboration [ 45 ] , and followed the four phases indicated in the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analyses ( prisma ) statement [ 46 ] .
the prisma statement for our systematic review is available in s1 table .
we registered the protocol for this systematic review at the prospero international prospective register of systematic reviews on october 25 , 2013 , and updated it on january 28 , 2015 .
the registration number for this review is crd42013006089 .
it is available at http :// www.crd.york.ac.uk / prospero ( s1 text ) .
study inclusion criteria we included only randomized and quasi - randomized controlled trials in this systematic review , including both individual and cluster - randomized studies .
regarding publication types , we included only peer - reviewed journals and reports from international organizations .
we considered papers of all languages , so long as they had english abstracts .
furthermore , we included only articles set in lmics as defined by the world bank [ 47 ] , and excluded non - randomized studies and non - intervention studies such as case series , case reports , and qualitative studies , as well as studies conducted in high - income countries .
participants we included women and neonates residing in lmics .
women had to be in the pregnancy , intrapartum , or postpartum period .
we excluded studies that included specific subpopulations that would have made it difficult to generalize the results to a wider population , such as hiv - positive women and groups at high risk for pregnancy complications .
interventions and controls interventions comprised packaged care / services that addressed different continuum of care time and space stages .
according to the who and the partnership for maternal , newborn and child health , the time dimension of continuum of care starts from pre - pregnancy and progresses to childhood and motherhood [ 14 , 48 - 50 ] .
however , given that we focused on neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality in the review , the target periods were only the pregnancy , birth , and postnatal periods of mothers and neonates .
the space dimension of continuum of care comprises three care stages - - community - family care , outpatient - outreach care , and clinic care [ 3 ] .
the community - family care interventions included home or community - based care practices addressing mothers and neonates' healthy behaviors .
the outpatient - outreach care included population - oriented services that health facilities or mobile services delivered routinely or periodically according to defined schedules .
the clinical care interventions included individual - oriented care through facility - based care at primary and referral levels .
we defined the control groups as those who received standard care .
in this study , standard care was defined as that provided in health facilities according to local or national guidelines .
outcomes we included studies assessing any of the outcomes below [ 51 , 52 ] .
since mortality is often the main outcome measure in mnch studies , we selected it as the primary outcome [ 52 ] .
we also included studies that had data from which we could calculate these outcomes .
neonatal mortality is defined as deaths in the first 28 days of life among live births .
perinatal mortality includes stillbirths and early neonatal deaths .
stillbirth is defined as the death of a fetus after 28 weeks of gestation but before delivery of the baby 's head .
early neonatal death is death of a neonate within seven days postpartum .
maternal mortality is defined as the death of a woman during pregnancy or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy .
search strategy we searched articles in the following bibliographic databases : pubmed / medline , popline , ebsco / cinahl , academic search complete , bibliomap , isi web of science , who regional database library , and the cochrane library .
additionally , we hand - searched relevant sources such as the lancet series ( neonatal survival and maternal survival ) to enlarge the study pool .
we also reviewed relevant internet sources from the who and google scholar for additional grey literature .
finally , we searched for additional studies using the snowball method of looking through the reference lists of retrieved articles .
we limited the publication period to 15 years , from 1999 to 2014 , to ensure that we retrieved a sufficient number of studies .
we used the following search strings combining the relevant medical subject headings ( mesh ) with additional key / text words : ( 1 ) pregnant women , mothers , neonate , newborn , infant , or community ; ( 2 ) maternal health or neonatal health ; and ( 3 ) mortality or death .
the specific electronic search strategy is provided in the s2 text .
data collection selection of studies the study selection process is summarized in the flowchart in fig 1 .
two review authors ( kk and so ) independently extracted data , and screened the quality and content of the included studies .
we identified articles by analyzing the titles and abstracts for relevance and compliance with the selection criteria based on the research setting , study design , and reported outcomes .
we classified articles as included , excluded , uncertain , or duplicate .
we confirmed all potential included or uncertain studies and resolved any disagreements by consensus .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0139288.g001 fig 1 diagram of information flow through phases of systematic review .
data extraction and management kk and so extracted the features of each study ( e.g. , study design , setting , components of intervention package , and outcomes ) and entered them into a standardized form .
kk performed the extraction and so checked for data accuracy and completeness .
again , when they noted discrepancies , the two review authors discussed until they reached an agreement , or consulted a third review author .
assessment of risk of bias on included studies kk and so assessed the quality of trials using the " risk of bias " tool presented in the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions [ 45 ] .
specifically , we assessed the risk of bias in seven domains : sequence generation , allocation concealment , blinding of participants and outcome assessors , incomplete outcome data , selective outcome reporting , and other potential threats to validity .
we resolved all discrepancies by consensus .
the summary of the risk of bias is shown in table 1 .
several studies lacked information related to the risk of bias or these risks were unclear .
due to the nature of the study design , allocation concealment was not an issue in the cluster - randomized studies we extracted [ 45 ] .
however , we counted baseline imbalance in determining selection bias .

measures of treatment effect we present results as risk ratios ( rr ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) for all randomized and quasi - randomized controlled trials .
unit of analysis errors we checked whether the study contained a unit of analysis error .
in cases where we observed this error , we re - analyzed the available data .
no analysis error was found .
analysis first , we narratively summarized the included study interventions .
second , we stratified the studies by the linkages of continuum of care time and space dimension stages .
then , we created a hierarchically categorized matrix by service delivery mode with the rrs of applied mortality .
third , we meta - analyzed neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality separately for each linkage of continuum of care time stages ( antenatal care + skilled birth attendance + postnatal care ; antenatal care + skilled birth attendance ; skilled birth attendance + postnatal care ; and antenatal care + postnatal care ) .
then , we analyzed all of these mortality types simultaneously to estimate a composite neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality risks for each linkage of time dimension stages .
finally , we stratified the studies by space dimension and estimated the composite risk of neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality .
the software revman 5.1 was used for the analysis .
we assessed the heterogeneity of the meta - analyses from the p - values at a significance level of < 0.10 and the i2 statistic .
we used random - effects models to adjust for possible heterogeneity .
results we retrieved a total of 7,142 articles from the sources ( fig 1 ). of them , 3,046 studies were identified from the pubmed database , 4,087 through other databases , and nine through hand searching .
after an initial screening , we excluded a total of 7,056 studies because they were duplicates or irrelevant to the research question. of the 86 studies remaining , we excluded a further 53 because they had no outcome / intervention or treatment ( n = 12 ) , no relevant design ( n = 22 ) , no clear comparison group ( n = 12 ) , or no relevant setting ( n = 7 ) .
we assessed the remaining 33 studies for eligibility through a review of the full - text articles .
after this full - text review , we included a total of 19 studies in the meta - analysis [ 53 - 71 ] .
they were all in english and had been published. of the 19 studies , 17 were cluster randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) [ 53 - 67 , 70 , 71 ] , one was a pre - post intervention design [ 69 ] , and one was a quasi - experimental study [ 68 ] .
the included studies were mostly conducted in asia and three were in africa .
in total , 361,306 births / live births were involved ( table 2 ) .

as shown in fig 2 , out of the 19 studies , 13 involved interventions that linked antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care [ 53 , 54 , 56 , 59 , 61 , 63 , 65 - 69 ] .
one study each linked antenatal care and skilled birth attendance [ 64 ] or skilled birth attendance and postnatal care [ 58 ] .
four studies linked antenatal care and postnatal care [ 55 , 57 , 60 , 62 ] .
however , no study used interventions that linked all the time stages as recommended - - namely , four antenatal care visits ; skilled birth attendance ; and postnatal care within 48 hours , at seven days , and at six weeks .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0139288.g002 fig 2 number of studies in each category of continuum of care linkage .
regarding the space dimension , among the 19 studies , 12 used interventions that linked community - family care , outpatient - outreach care , and clinical care [ 53 - 60 , 62 , 64 , 68 , 69 ] ; two studies included interventions that linked community - family care and outpatient - outreach care [ 61 , 66 ] , and five studies included interventions on community - family care only [ 62 , 63 , 65 , 67 ] .
timing and frequency of antenatal care / postnatal care the timing and frequency of antenatal care or postnatal care services delivery differed among the included studies .
most of the studies involved four antenatal care visits , with the minimum numbers of antenatal care visits for the interventions ranging from one to four times during the pregnancy period .
the timings of antenatal care , however , were not defined in most of the studies - - indeed , only three studies reported the timings of antenatal care : twice at 12 - 16 weeks and 32 - 34 weeks in a study in bangladesh [ 54 ] , twice during the first and second trimesters in a study in pakistan [ 64 ] , and once in the third trimester in a study in malawi [ 62 ] .
in the case of postnatal care , the timings varied , ranging from zero days to five months .
however , in most studies , postnatal care was provided for seven days at the very least .
the frequency was also rather diverse , ranging from one to five times .
six studies did not make clear mention of the timing or frequency , but reported on interventions during the postnatal care period .
effectiveness of care linkages between antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care table 3 shows the results of the 13 studies that linked antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care .
except for one study conducted in malawi , all studies were conducted in asia ( india , bangladesh , vietnam , nepal , and pakistan ). of the 13 studies , six included interventions that linked the three stages of the space dimension ( i.e. , community - family care , outpatient - outreach care , and clinical care ) .
although they linked the three time stages , the frequency of antenatal care visits ranged from two to four times between the studies .
the frequencies and timings of postnatal care were not the same across studies .

as for the components of the intervention , we noted some particular characteristics .
for instance , primary - care - level health officers ( e.g. lady health workers , community health workers ) provided antenatal care or postnatal care within the community for women and children via home visits [ 54 , 56 , 61 , 68 , 69 ] and outreach services [ 59 ] .
to improve care delivery , traditional birth attendants ( tbas ) received training in the form of basic neonatal care , cleanliness during delivery , and referral of women for emergency obstetric care [ 54 , 56 , 59 , 68 ] .
interventions often included community meetings for women to promote mnch .
the facilitators of such interventions were tbas , community health workers , or other recruited facilitators [ 54 , 56 , 61 , 65 , 67 ] .
the intervention packages in these 13 studies resulted in significant reductions in mortality .
twelve studies assessed neonatal deaths .
among them , seven reported significant reductions in neonatal mortality as a result of the interventions .
furthermore , 10 of the 13 studies measured perinatal deaths. of them , five reported significant reductions in perinatal mortality as a result of the interventions .
six studies measured maternal deaths. of them , one study showed a significant reduction as a result of the intervention and one study showed a significant increase .
according to the meta - analysis , the interventions that linked antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care significantly reduced neonatal mortality ( rr 0.84 ; 95 % ci 0.75 to 0.94 , random effects [ 12 studies , n = 184,260 ] , i2 82 % , p < 0.01 ) and perinatal mortality ( rr 0.81 ; 95 % ci 0.74 to 0.90 , random effects [ 10 studies , n = 136,153 ] , i2 83 % , p < 0.01 ) ( fig 3 ) .
however , the interventions did not lead to a significant decrease in maternal mortality ( rr 0.75 ; 95 % ci 0.46 to 1.22 , random effects [ six studies , n = 96,691 ] , i2 68 % , p < 0.01 ) .
the composite measure of all three mortality types was significantly reduced ( rr 0.83 ; 95 % ci 0.77 to 0.89 , random effects , i2 79 % , p < 0.01 ) .
to explore the considerable heterogeneities observed in this meta - analysis , we explored the publication bias using a funnel plot ( fig 4 ) .
the included studies were symmetrically distributed on both sides of the combined effect size line , indicating no obvious publication bias .

as for the components of the interventions , all four studies included home visits for antenatal care or postnatal care .
the practitioners who performed the home visits were primary - level health workers [ 55 , 57 ] , community volunteers [ 60 ] , or trained women 's group members [ 62 ] .
this intervention linkage resulted in significant reductions in mortality .
all four studies measured neonatal deaths , but only two reported a reduction in neonatal mortality .
two of the four studies measured perinatal mortality , both reporting significant reductions as a result of the intervention .
maternal death was measured in one of the four studies , but was not significantly reduced [ 62 ] .
fig 5 shows the meta - analysis .
neonatal mortality ( rr 0.81 ; 95 % ci 0.67 to 1.00 , random effects [ four studies , n = 69,671 ] , i2 75 % , p < 0.01 ) and perinatal mortality ( rr 0.74 ; 95 % ci 0.65 to 0.84 , random effects [ two studies , n = 15,591 ] , i2 0 % , p < 0.01 ) were both significantly decreased in this linkage .
we did not perform a meta - analysis for maternal mortality due to a lack of studies .

discussion this is the first systematic review to examine the effectiveness of interventions combining the continuum of care time and space dimensions for maternal , neonatal , and perinatal mortality .
we included a total of 19 studies in this review ; several results of some importance were obtained .
first , none of the studies followed the standards of the continuum of care time dimension stages : four antenatal care visits ; use of skilled birth attendance ; and postnatal care within 48 hours , at seven days , and at six weeks [ 31 ] .
however , two - thirds of the included studies did contain interventions that linked antenatal care skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care , albeit without considering frequency and timing of care ; another two - thirds of the studies linked community - family care , outpatient - outreach care , and clinical care .
second , the interventions linking antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care led to significant decreases in the composite measure of neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality .
however , the maternal mortality results were inconsistent .
the composite measure of mortality also showed reductions in a meta - analysis of the interventions involving linkages between the time and space dimension stages .
linkage patterns of time and space dimensions as mentioned above , none of the studies followed the standards of continuum of care .
however , without taking frequency and timing into consideration , linking the three time dimension stages reduced the risk of neonatal and perinatal deaths .
in a recent systematic review , the perinatal mortality increased with reduced antenatal care visits , but the difference was of borderline statistical significance ( three studies : rr 1.15 ; 95 % ci 1.01 to 1.32 ) [ 24 ] .
this could be because taking antenatal care would positively affect skilled birth attendance [ 72 ] .
this may also support strategies that promote " goal - oriented " antenatal care visits [ 24 , 49 ] , which directs attention to the quality of antenatal care , including its components and timing , more than the quantity of such care .
in our review , the frequencies and timing of postnatal care differed across studies .
this may be because of the postnatal care changes in global recommendations by the who [ 30 , 41 , 42 ] .
in our study , most of the postnatal care interventions included the first postnatal care visit within 1 - 2 days .
however , the timing of additional postnatal care visits was not consistent .
the risk of death is significantly elevated even after 42 days postpartum [ 73 , 74 ] .
regarding the frequency of postnatal care , there was no compelling evidence that more postnatal care visits are associated with fewer neonatal or maternal deaths [ 75 , 76 ] .
decisions on the frequency and timing of postnatal care could be better made if they were defined according to local needs [ 76 ] .
all of the included studies contained community - family care in the space dimension , and two - thirds included links with outpatient - outreach care and clinical care .
community involvement is a positive factor , especially for reducing neonatal mortality , perinatal mortality , maternal morbidity , and the number of stillbirths , as demonstrated in a previous review [ 77 ] .
effective linkages of the time dimension for reducing mortality linkage between antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care according to our meta - analysis , interventions that linked all three stages of the time dimension were most effective .
interventions utilizing a linkage of antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care appeared to reduce the risk of neonatal and perinatal deaths .
only the risk of maternal deaths showed inconsistent results .
the study by azad , which showed an increase in maternal deaths due to the intervention , did not provide a specific reason for this result .
however , no deaths among mothers who attended women 's groups , making it difficult to consider that the intervention would have influenced the negative results in maternal mortality .
notably , the significant increase was observed only when marginal populations were included ; thus , omission error could have affected the intervention results .
however , the intervention linkage of antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care was found to be effective for a composite measure of neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality .
this suggests the importance of considering these three time stages in designing mnch interventions in lmics .
linkage between antenatal care and postnatal care the intervention packages that combined only antenatal care and postnatal care significantly reduced the risk of neonatal and perinatal mortality .
this linkage was also effective in reducing the composite measure of mortality .
antenatal care is an entry point to mnch care , suggesting that antenatal care may improve overall mnch care uptake , which leads to better mnch outcomes .
however , this result also suggests that postnatal care might complement the effectiveness of antenatal care .
thus , linkages of antenatal care with postnatal care could be a key to designing effective mnch interventions .
effective linkages of the time and space dimensions for reducing mortality risks in the meta - analysis , the linkage of all time and space stages was effective for reducing neonatal , perinatal , and maternal mortality .
this was among the primary evidence found in this review study .
the importance of both dimensions has been argued in the past , however , until now , evidence justifying the effectiveness of linking the continuum of care time and space dimensions has been scarce .
indeed , the continuum of care has been promoted without solid evidence of its effectiveness .
understandably , further trial evidence will be necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the continuum of care with high reliability .
nevertheless , our systematic review will serve as evidence in defending the effectiveness of the continuum of care .
suggested definition and intervention of continuum of care the findings of this review demonstrate the effective continuum of care linkages : thus we can use the results to better define the components of continuum of care and thereby exploit it for the design of future intervention .
for the time dimension , the basic components of continuum of care could be linkages between antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care .
however , interventions combining antenatal care with postnatal care would be also an effective option when resources are limited .
the frequency of antenatal care should range between two and four visits .
we could not clearly identify the timings of antenatal care in this systematic review .
for postnatal care , timing appears more important than does frequency ; since most of the included studies first implemented postnatal care at 0 - 2 days postpartum , this postnatal care timing should be at least considered .
as for delivery , ensuring the presence of skilled birth attendants is not always possible .
however , if tbas receive training in appropriate skills , said tbas could be included as assistants for post - delivery care .
for the space dimension of the continuum of care , a basic component of interventions is linkages between community - family care , outpatient - outreach care , and clinical care .
we particularly recommend interventions based on community involvement , as per previous evidence .
additionally , our review and meta - analysis results indicated that interventions that include home visit care would be effective for improving neonatal and perinatal health .
particularly , early postnatal care visits between 0 and 2 days would be important .
these results suggest that a community - focused intervention would be a favorable design .
limitations this systematic review has two limitations .
first , the lack of randomized studies may have obscured the real results of the meta - analysis .
in particular , we found only one study each including interventions that linked antenatal care and skilled birth attendance or skilled birth attendance and postnatal care .
thus , for this linkage , we could not conduct a meta - analysis .
further evidence of these linkages is required to confirm their effectiveness .
second , a number of groups showed significant statistical heterogeneity .
we could have excluded studies that conflicted with the other studies from the meta - analysis .
however , we could not identify the sources of heterogeneity ; indeed , even after excluding the outlying studies , we identified heterogeneity .
furthermore , eliminating studies would also be unwise because it can introduce bias [ 45 ] .
thus , the findings need to be interpreted with caution .
conclusions our review encourages continuous uptake of antenatal care , skilled birth attendance , and postnatal care to improve mnch outcomes in lmics .
the review was conclusive regarding the reduction of neonatal and perinatal deaths .
although maternal deaths were not significantly reduced , composite measures of all mortality were .
as such , the evidence is sufficient to scale up this intervention package for the improvement of mnch outcomes .

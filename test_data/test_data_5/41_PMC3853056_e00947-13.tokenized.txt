nonpathogenic pantoea spp. have been shown to confer biofertilizer and biocontrol activities , indicating their potential for increasing crop yield .
herein , we provide the high - quality genome sequence of pantoea sp. strain as - pwvm4 , a gram - negative motile plant growth - promoting rhizobacterium isolated from a pomegranate plant .
the 4.9 - mb genome contains genes related to plant growth promotion and the synthesis of siderophores .
cover - datenovember / december 2013access - typefree genome announcement the rhizospheric region of the plant root contains beneficial microbes that improve plant growth directly through their biofertilizer and phytostimulation activities or indirectly via their biocontrol activities .
pantoea spp. , which are nonpathogenic plant epiphytic bacteria , have been reported as useful bacteria originating from edible plants ( 1 - 4 ) .
pantoea agglomerans , isolated as a symbiotic bacterium from wheat and rice , was reported to fix nitrogen and solubilize inorganic phosphorus ( 1 ) , is involved in indole - 3 - acetic acid and siderophore production ( 2 ) , and is capable of plant growth promotion ( 3 , 4 ) .
some pantoea strains have been developed as biological control agents for plant pathogens ( 5 - 7 ). p. agglomerans strain cpa - 2 , isolated from apple and pear , was found to be effective against botrytis cinerea , penicillium expansum , and rhizopus stolonifer ( 8 ) .
pantoea sp. strain as - pwvm4 , isolated from the rhizosphere of punica granatum , exhibits phosphate solubilization , ammonia production , and hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) and siderophore production , and it confers activity against a fusarium sp. , a fungal plant pathogen of pomegranates ( s. kaur , u. devi , i. khatri , d. sharma , s. subramanian , and a. k. saini , unpublished data ) .
the genome of pantoea sp. as - pwvm4 was sequenced using the illumina - hiseq 1000 technology .
sequencing resulted in 31,931,152 paired - end reads ( insert size of 350 bp ) 101 bp in length .
a total of 31,678,261 high - quality reads with approximately 640x coverage were assembled with clc bio wb6 ( word size , 35 ; bubble size , 55 ) to obtain 48 contigs ( n50 , 218,003 bp ) .
the genome - finishing module of clc bio , followed by the sspace version 2.0 scaffolder ( 9 ) and gapfiller version 1 - 10 ( 10 ) , was used .
the gap - filled scaffolds thus obtained were broken at the gaps to obtain 46 contigs ( n50 , 213,320 bp ) of 4,990,872 bp , with an average g + c content of 54 % .
functional annotation was carried out by rapid annotations using subsystems technology ( rast ) ( 11 ) , trnas were predicted by trnascan - se 1.23 ( 12 ) , and rrna genes were predicted by rnammer 1.2 ( 13 ) .
the genome contains 3 rrna genes ( 5s - 23s - 16s ) and 75 aminoacyl - trna synthetase genes .
a total of 4,525 coding regions ( 2,248 genes transcribed from the positive strand and 2,277 genes from the negative strand ) were found in the genome , of which 3,752 ( 83 %) were functionally annotated .
the genome coding density is 88 % , with an average gene length of 942 bp. the annotated genome has 97 genes responsible for motility and chemotaxis , including 16 genes for flagellar motility .
fifty genes are responsible for phosphorus metabolism .
twenty - nine genes are osmotic stress - responsive genes , including 4 for osmoregulation and 69 for oxidative stress , for a total of 165 genes in this organism that are responsible for stress response .
a functional comparison of the genome sequences available on the rast server revealed the closest neighbor of pantoea sp. as - pwvm4 to be pantoea sp. strain at - 9b ( score , 542 ) , followed by pantoea ananatis lmg 20103 ( score , 493 ) , pantoea sp. strain alphab ( score , 426 ) , and pantoea vagans c9 - 1 ( score , 407 ) .
nucleotide sequence accession numbers .
this whole - genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj / embl / genbank under the accession no. aszc00000000 .
the version described in this paper is the first version , aszc01000000 .

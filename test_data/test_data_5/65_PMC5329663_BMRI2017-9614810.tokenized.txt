to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture as monotherapy and as an alternative therapy in treating depression - related insomnia .
data source .
seven databases were searched starting from 1946 to march 30 , 2016 .
study eligibility criteria .
randomized - controlled trials of adult subjects ( 18 - 75 y ) who had depression - related insomnia and had received acupuncture. results .
18 randomized - controlled clinical trials ( rcts ) were introduced in this meta - analysis .
the findings determined that the acupuncture treatment made significant improvements in psqi score ( md = - 2.37 , 95 % ci - 3.52 to - 1.21 ) compared with western medicine .
acupuncture combined with western medicine had a better effect on improving sleep quality ( md = - 2.63 , 95 % ci - 4.40 to - 0.86 ) compared with the treatment of western medicine alone .
there was no statistical difference ( md = - 2.76 , 95 % ci - 7.65 to 2.12 ) between acupuncture treatment and western medicine towards improving the hamd score .
acupuncture combined with western medicine ( md = - 5.46 , ci - 8.55 to - 2.38 ) had more effect on improving depression degree compared with the western medicine alone. conclusion .
this systematic review indicates that acupuncture could be an alternative therapy to medication for treating depression - related insomnia .

introduction depression is one of the most common mental disorders and is listed as the major disease causing the second - highest financial burden of diseases in china [ 1 , 2 ] .
two large , recent epidemiological surveys indicated that the lifetime prevalence of depression was 16 % [ 3 , 4 ] .
depression has complicated influencing factors , such as loss of interest and sleep disorders [ 5 ] .
insomnia is defined as difficulty in falling asleep and in maintaining sleep ( including easy to awaken , waking up too early , and sleep difficulties ) .
it causes decreased sleep time and poor sleep quality which is affecting the ability to learn , work efficiency , and , ultimately , the quality of life .
there is a complex relationship between depression and sleep disorders [ 6 ] .
insomnia and depression are often closely linked ; approximately 70 % of patients with depression have symptoms of insomnia [ 7 ] .
the prevalence of depression in patients with insomnia is higher than that of patients without insomnia by 3 to 4 times [ 4 ] , and sleep disorders are one of the primary manifestations and diagnostic criteria for depression [ 8 ] .
one of the manifestations of severe depression is waking up two hours or more earlier than normal [ 4 ] .
first - line antidepressant medication includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) , serotonin - norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( snris ) , tricyclic antidepressants ( tcas ) , and monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( mois ) [ 9 ] .
however , these drugs are associated with a number of undesirable side effects such as weight gain , sedation , dry mouth , nausea , blurred vision , constipation , and tachycardia [ 9 ] .
the effect of acupuncture treatment for depression is significant .
chan 's [ 10 ] systematic review and meta - analysis of acupuncture combined with antidepressants for depression showed that acupuncture combined with antidepressants was better than the single use of antidepressants .
cheuk dkl 's [ 11 ] systematic review and meta - analysis of acupuncture treatment for patients with insomnia showed that acupuncture treatment was better in improving sleep quality , decreasing sleep latency , and prolonging total sleep time , compared with the control group .
the purpose of this meta - analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture as monotherapy and as an alternative therapy in treating depression - related insomnia .
acupuncture is widely used in the treatment of depression - related insomnia .
a large number of studies have reported that acupuncture treatment is effective in treating depression - related insomnia [ 12 - 29 ] .
however , it has been limited by the insufficient number of high - quality , well - designed randomized controlled trials .
this systematic review and meta - analysis on the acupuncture treatment for depression - related insomnia can find some results .
we provide further evidence of the quantity and quality in order to draw more definitive conclusions .
in this systematic review and meta - analysis , we further evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of depression - related insomnia .
2. methods 2.1 .
study inclusion and exclusion criteria the flowing search terms were used : acupuncture / electroacupuncture / ea and insomnia / sleep disorders and depression .
randomized placebo or sham controlled trials of adult subjects (> 18 y ) , who had depression - related insomnia and received acupuncture , or electroacupuncture , were included .
only papers published in english or chinese languages were included in the study .
letters , comments , editorials , case reports , technical reports , or any nonoriginal studies were excluded .
studies presented in the outcomes of interest were not presented in a quantitative manner .
2.2 .
strategy for literature search this meta - analysis was conducted in accordance with prisma guidelines .
two independent reviewers ( bo dong and jie ma ) performed systematic searches in the following databases : ( 1 ) chinese databases : chinese journal full - text database ( cnki ) ; wanfang database , chongqing vip database , and national knowledge infrastructure ( nki ) ; ( 2 ) english databases : medline ( 1946 - march , 2016 ) , in - process citations ( 1950 - 3 / 2016 ) , publisher supplied citation ( 1950 - march , 2016 ) , ovid , embase ( 1946 - march 2016 ) , and cochrane central register of controlled trials ( central , january 27 , 2016 ) .
we hand - retrieved the additional articles in the treatment for depression from 1979 to march 2016 .
2.3 .
data collection and analysis in an independent manner , two authors ( bo d and zq c ) performed data extraction on the included trials .
the data problems were solved through consultation , if necessary a third reviewer was consulted to resolve any uncertainties regarding study inclusion .
the following information was extracted from studies that met the inclusion criteria : the name of the first author , year of publication , study design , demographic data of subjects , types of intervention , and outcomes .
the criterion of data extraction is in accordance with the cochrane meeting standards [ 30 ] .
the quality of the data was evaluated using the cochrane risk of bias tool .
we evaluated the quality of the included trials according to the following categories : category a ( good ) : studies have the least biases and results are considered valid .
these studies consisted of clear descriptions of the study populations , the settings , and the interventions ; had appropriate statistical and analytical methods ; had no reporting errors ; had less than 20 % dropouts ; had clear reporting of dropouts ; and had appropriate consideration and adjustment for potential confounders .
category b ( fair ) : studies were susceptible to bias to some degree and were not sufficient to invalidate the results .
these studies may have had suboptimal adjustments for potential confounders and may have lacked certain information that was needed to assess limitations and potential problems .
category c ( poor ) : studies had significant biases that may invalidate the results .
these studies either did not consider potential confounders or did not make adjustments for them appropriately .
these studies may have had critical problems in design , analysis , missing information , or discrepancies in reporting .
2.4 .
evaluation of bias risk we used the jadad quality evaluation method to deter risk of bias in our meta - analysis studies .
these are the following outcomes : ( 1 ) correct method of generating randomization numbers ; ( 2 ) use of randomization ; ( 3 ) implementation of blind study ; ( 4 ) complete data set ; ( 5 ) publication bias ; and ( 6 ) possibility of other bias [ 8 ] .
2.5 .
evaluation results due to the different control groups included in the 18 articles , the meta - analysis was divided into 3 parts : ( 1 ) acupuncture with western medicine ; ( 2 ) acupuncture with sham or placebo acupuncture ; and ( 3 ) combination of acupuncture and medication with medication .
due to different measurement of the outcomes , not all of the articles appeared in each of the meta - analyses .
the primary outcome was the psqi score .
in 1989 , dr. buysse , a psychiatrist at the university of pittsburgh ( us ) , developed the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) .
it has commonly been used to evaluate the quality of sleep in patients with sleep disorders and concomitant mental disorders .
the secondary outcome was the hamd ( hamilton depression ) scale .
hamd is the most widely used scale for the clinical assessment of depression .
hamd scales ( 17 items , 21 items , and 24 items ) are different in involved areas and total score .
hamd scale ( 24 items ) includes circadian variations , depersonalization , paranoid symptoms , obsessive - compulsive behaviour , feeling of decreased ability , feeling of despair , and feelings of inferiority .
some clinical trials reported the effective rate of treatment , which provides a clear description for syndromes improving degree .
the definition of a clinical cure is a normal sleep time of > 6 h , deep sleep , being energetic after waking up , and the reduction rate of hamd scores being more than 75 % .
effectiveness is less insomnia symptoms , increasing sleep time < 3 h , and the reduction rate of hamd being more than or equal to 25 % .
invalid is no improvement after treatment or the reduction rate of hamd < 25 % [ 31 ] .
we used the software revman 5.30 that is provided by the cochrane collaboration network for data analysis .
data were summarized by using relative risk ( rr ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) for binary outcomes or mean difference ( md ) with 95 % ci for continuous outcomes .
a chi2 - based test of homogeneity was performed and the inconsistency index ( i2 ) and q statistics were determined .
if the i2 statistic was > 40 % , a random effects model was used .
if the i2 statistic was < 40 % , a fixed effect model was used .
pooled effects were calculated and a 2 - sided p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
the leave - one - out approach was used for sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome using .
publication bias was assessed by funnel plot .
2.6 .
analysis of results in final , 566 citations were identified , and the majority was excluded for having no acupuncture treatment , case reports , letters , comments , or basic research .
data from 44 rcts were included in this review ( figure 1 ) .
among them , 5 trials were unpublished and 5 papers were from graduate student dissertations .
sixteen rcts were excluded from this review due to multiple publications , non - rct design , and unavailable data or for not having met one of the inclusion criteria. by reading full texts of the published studies , 18 studies were confirmed that they were all randomized controlled trials of acupuncture treating insomnia associated with depression ( table 1 ) , among them 11 articles were rcts of acupuncture compared with western medicine ; 5 were rcts of acupuncture combined with medication compared with sole medication ; 2 were studies of acupuncture compared with sham or placebo acupuncture control .
results showed that there were 1678 participants included , 908 women and 641 men ageing from 18 to 75 y old .
the gender of 120 subjects remained unknown .
the duration of disease ranged in length from one m to 22 y ; there were 811 patients in the intervention group and 858 patients in the control group .
among the articles , 16 articles used pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) [ 12 - 14 , 16 - 29 ] , 12 of the studies applied the hamilton depression scale ( hamd ) [ 12 , 16 , 18 , 21 , 23 - 29 ] , and 5 articles used the self - rating depression scale ( sds ) [ 13 , 14 , 28 , 29 ] .
four articles observed the follow - up period and the recurrence rate [ 13 , 14 , 28 , 29 ] , and 6 articles studied the adverse reactions with treatment emergent symptom scale ( tess ) [ 16 , 17 , 21 , 23 , 28 , 29 ] .
the quality of the data was not high .
there was a high risk of detection bias due to no implementation of blind study and allocation concealment in more than half of the studies ( figure 2 ) .
2.7 .
acupuncture versus western medicine a total of 10 articles reported the pittsburgh sleep scale .
among them , 7 articles showed acupuncture was more effective than medication , and 3 showed no significant difference between two groups .
10 articles with high heterogeneity ( heterogeneity : chi2 = 140.70 , df = 9 ( p < 0.00001 ) ; i2 = 94 %) and the random effects model ( md = - 2.37 , 95 % ci - 3.52 to - 1.21 ) were used .
the forest map shows the psqi score in the acupuncture group was lower than in the medication group .
it indicates that the acupuncture treatment was more effective on insomnia and depression than medication ( figure 3 ) .
2.8 .
acupuncture combined with medicine versus single medicine four studies comparing the acupuncture combined with medicine and single medicine were analyzed and reported through the psqi score , among them , 3 articles showed acupuncture combined with medication was more effective than sole medication and one showed no significant difference between two groups .
the random effects model was used ( md = - 2.63 , 95 % ci - 4.40 to - 0.86 ) , due to the heterogeneity in the data ( heterogeneity : chi2 = 17.00 , df = 3 ( p = 0.0007 ) ; i2 = 82 %) .
the psqi scores in the acupuncture combined with medicine groups decreased significantly compared to the sole medication groups ( figure 4 ) .
2.9 .
electroacupuncture versus sham acupuncture or placebo acupuncture for a total of two articles based on the psqi scores to evaluate effect , one article showed no significant difference in psqi score between two groups and another one showed the control group was more effective than the electroacupuncture group , heterogeneity was detected ( heterogeneity : chi2 = 5.72 , df = 1 ( p = 0.02 ) ; i2 = 83 %) , and the random effects model was used ( md = 0.17 , 95 % ci - 1.68 to 2.03 ) .
the forest plot showed that there was no difference in psqi score between the electroacupuncture group and the sham acupuncture group or the placebo acupuncture group ( figure 5 ) .
2.10 .
acupuncture versus western medicine a total of 6 articles reported the hamd score .
the random effects model was used ( md = - 2.76 , 95 % ci - 7.65 to 2.12 ) ; heterogeneity in the data was detected ( heterogeneity : chi2 = 537.30 , df = 5 ( p < 0.00001 ) ; i2 = 99 %) .
4 articles showed acupuncture was more effective than western medicine , one showed no significant difference between two groups , and one showed the control group was more effective than the acupuncture group .
there were no differences between the acupuncture groups and the medication groups in hamd score .
however , two medication groups showed improvement in depressive symptoms after treatment ( figure 6 ) .
2.11 .
electroacupuncture versus sham acupuncture or placebo acupuncture a total of two articles have a contrast between electroacupuncture and sham acupuncture or placebo acupuncture .
one study showed no difference in hamd score between two groups ; another one showed the control group was more effective than the electroacupuncture group .
heterogeneity was found ( heterogeneity : chi2 = 1.86 , df = 1 ( p = 0.17 ) ; i2 = 46 %) , and we used the random effects model ( md = 0.55 ; 95 % ci - 0.7 to 1.79 ) , ( or = 0.89 , 95 % ci 0.69 to 1.08 ) .
the forest plot showed that there was no difference in hamd score between the electroacupuncture group and the sham acupuncture group or the placebo acupuncture group .
the high heterogeneity may be caused by the inconsistent timing of evaluation after the treatment ( figure 7 ) .
2.12 .
acupuncture combined with medicine versus single medicine a total of 3 articles reported hamd score .
all the articles showed acupuncture combined with medication was more effective than the sole mediation .
there was an obvious heterogeneity of these three articles ( heterogeneity : chi2 = 15.68 , df = 2 ( p = 0.0004 ) ; i2 = 87 %) ; the random effects model ( md = - 5.46 , ci - 8.55 to - 2.38 ) was used .
the results showed that the acupuncture combined with medicine group was more effective in improving depression degree than that in sole medication treatment group .
the appearance of high heterogeneity may result from the different versions of the hamd score and the inconsistent timing of evaluation after the treatment ( figure 8 ) .
2.13 .
acupuncture versus western medicine a total of 8 articles reported the effective rate .
4 articles showed acupuncture was more effective than western medicine group ; 4 showed no significant difference between two groups .
the forest plot showed that effective rate of acupuncture treatment is higher than western medicine alone ( or = 2.34 , 95 % ci 1.42 - 3.84 ) ( heterogeneity test : chi2 = 7.81 , df = 7 ( p = 0.35 ) ; i2 = 10 %) ( figure 9 ) .
2.14 .
publication bias publication bias was reported via begg 's funnel plot ( figure 10 ) , where asymmetry of the plots may have arisen through publication bias and the relationship between trial size and effect size .
3. result this systematic review and meta - analysis assessed the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating depression - related insomnia .
in patients' psqi score , after treatment , acupuncture or acupuncture combined with medication was lower than sole medication ( md = - 2.37 , 95 % ci - 3.52 to - 1.21 ) ( md = - 2.76 , 95 % ci - 7.65 to 2.12 ) ; however , the score in acupuncture group was higher than sham or placebo acupuncture control ( md = 0.17 , 95 % ci - 1.68 to 2.03 ) .
the effective rate of acupuncture treatment was higher than medication ( or = 2.34 , 95 % ci 1.42 - 3.84 ) .
for the hamd score , there was no significant difference between acupuncture and medication ( md = - 2.76 , 95 % ci - 7.65 to 2.12 ) , acupuncture combined with medicine reduced the score of hamd than sole medication ( md = - 5.46 , ci 8.55 to - 2.38 ) , and there was no significant difference between acupuncture treatment and sham or placebo acupuncture control ( md = 0.55. 95 % ci - 0.7 to 1.79 ) .
sensitivity analysis using the leave - one - out approach indicated the findings are robust and not dependent on any one study .
publication bias was detected .
4. discussion the object of this systematic review and meta - analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating depression - related insomnia .
we found that , compared to medication , acupuncture treatment was effective in improving depression - related insomnia and depression degree .
however , compared to sham or placebo acupuncture control , there was no significant difference .
this may be caused by the treatment period , the selection of points , or the level of the acupuncturist 's technical ability not being balanced .
we searched for recent systematic reviews of depression - related insomnia in english databases , but we did not retrieve any results .
there was one review found in the chinese journal of clinical acupuncture in 2013 [ 32 ] .
the quality of the research was relatively low , and 50 % of them had been included in the thesis of graduate students .
what they mainly compared is that the score of psqi , hamd , and the efficiency after the treatment , and the conclusion showed that the therapeutic effect of the treatment group is better than or equivalent to the controls .
we made a more comprehensive search in chinese and english databases , and 18 randomized controlled trials were included in the study .
the quality of literatures included in our review is relatively higher than that in the other study .
all literatures that we incorporated are randomized clinical trials and published in domestic and foreign journals , and they not only compare clinical curative effect but also assess the risk of bias evaluation and the quality of every piece of literature .
however , there were several limitations in this systematic review .
the acupoints used in the included studies were heterogeneous , which may have affected the outcomes .
the treatment duration of each study was different ; for example , the shortest treatment period was 18 days , while the longest was 3 ms. the random methods were not clear enough and there were some errors in the random methods in some studies .
only 3 of the 18 articles were published in english .
other studies were published in chinese .
the diagnostic criteria used in the articles were not the same .
some articles used chinese diagnostic criteria ; 3 articles used the diagnostic criteria in usa .
only 3 rcts mentioned the symptom 's severity in diagnosis criteria , 1 of them reported that the participants must be mild to moderate depression , and two reported that the subjects were excluded if they had significant suicidal risk .
patients included in the studies differed in age. and there was no study reporting the calculation of sample size ; 12 of 18 studies offered a detailed description of the specific steps of acupuncture treatment .
in the research , there is little mention of the detailed methods used in treating the control groups .
according to the funnel plot , there is publication bias , which may demonstrate that the authors had no confidence in their published trials if they resulted in a negative conclusion .
the quality of the results of meta - analysis was determined by the quality of the rct and by sufficient clinical evidence .
thus , if we want to draw a reasonable conclusion for a meta - analysis , we need larger sample sizes and more rigorously randomized controlled trials .
in conclusion , research evidence supported the use of acupuncture as an effective treatment to improve symptoms of depression - related insomnia .
compared with conventional western medicine , acupuncture may be more effective in decreasing psqi score. with regard to hamd score , there is no significant difference between acupuncture and conventional western medicine .
acupuncture combined with medicine showed to be significantly effective in decreasing score of psqi and hamd compared to sole medication .
current existing evidence allows limited conclusions to be reached through comparing acupuncture and medicine , and additional trials are needed to improve the reliability of these findings .
in terms of adverse events , acupuncture was linked to rare and slightly adverse events such as hematomas or pain , but these resolved quickly and no other serious events have been reported .
in addition , the use of acupuncture should be considered an appropriate alternative treatment for depression - related insomnia .

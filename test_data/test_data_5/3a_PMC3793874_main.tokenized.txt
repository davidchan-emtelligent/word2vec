2013 open access under cc by 3.0 license the fate of an mrna is largely determined by its interactions with rna binding proteins ( rbps ) .
post - transcriptional processing , rna stability , localisation and translation are some of the events regulated by the plethora of rbps present within cells .
mutations in various rbps cause several diseases of the central nervous system , including frontotemporal lobar degeneration , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fragile x syndrome .
here we review the studies that integrated uv - induced cross - linked immunoprecipitation ( clip ) with other genome - wide methods to comprehensively characterise the function of diverse rbps in the brain .
we discuss the technical challenges of these studies and review the strategies that can be used to reliably identify the rnas bound and regulated by an rbp .
we conclude by highlighting how clip and related techniques have been instrumental in addressing the role of rbps in neurologic diseases .
this article is part of a special issue entitled : rna and splicing regulation in neurodegeneration .
keywords clip neurodegeneration fus muscleblind rna binding proteins introduction as an mrna progresses through the various regulatory stages , from transcription to translation and degradation , it is associated with a myriad of multifunctional rna - binding proteins ( rbps ) .
indeed , recent studies suggest that hundreds of rbps interact with mrnas to collectively determine their fate ( baltz et al. , 2012 ; castello et al. , 2012 ) .
for example , many rbps are components of multi - protein complexes such as the spliceosome or ribosome that mediate specific aspects of gene expression .
others can directly interact with pre - mrnas , mrnas and other non - coding rnas to control their processing , localisation , stability and structure .
the importance of rbps is further highlighted by the fact that aberrant rbp interactions with rna can lead to several human pathologies , including neurodegenerative diseases , making their study of great importance .
here we briefly discuss what the genome - wide technologies have taught us about post - transcriptional regulation by rbps that are implicated in neurodegenerative disease .
identifying the rna targets of an rbp a crucial challenge of researchers studying the functions of rbps is to identify the rnas regulated by a specific rbp .
clip enables study of rbp - rna interactions that occur in intact cells or tissues since the biological samples are uv cross - linked , forming a covalent bond between the rnas in direct contact with the rbp .
the rbp - of - interest is then immuno precipitated , and the co - purified rna is ligated to adapters that enable production of cdna libraries for sequencing ( ule et al. , 2003 ) ( fig. 1a ) .
clip allows unbiased transcriptome - wide analysis of protein - rna interactions , which is a crucial step towards unravelling the mechanisms of post - transcriptional regulatory networks .
however , it is important to appreciate the challenges of clip , and the need to integrate it with other technologies .
a common expectation from the clip studies is that they will directly generate a shortlist of the functionally relevant rna targets , enabling the study of pathological relevance of these rnas and the development of new rna - based therapies .
clip is clearly a step towards this goal .
however , each rbp can regulate a great multitude of rnas by diverse mechanisms which presents a greater challenge than appreciated at first sight .
the frequency of clip sequence reads that identify a specific site depends not only on the affinity of the rbp for this site , but also on the rna abundance .
it is clear that rna abundance varies between genes , and can vary also within each gene due to variable kinetics of transcription , splicing and intronic rna degradation .
it remains challenging to adequately account for these factors in data analysis .
the tendency to report the absolute number of rna targets should thus be approached with caution , since these numbers depend on the variable quantitative quality of clip cdna libraries and require the use of arbitrary binding thresholds .
in appreciation of these points , we describe several approaches that can be used to increase the confidence in assigning functionally relevant rna targets of rbps .
produce clip data with high resolution and quantitative nature the original clip method ( ule et al. , 2003 ) , which was used also in hits - clip and clip - seq protocols ( licatalosi et al. , 2008 ; yeo et al. , 2009 ) , had not been optimised for the purpose of high - throughput sequencing .
therefore , when a limited amount of starting material is available , this method may generate cdna libraries that contain a limited number of unique sequence reads .
uv cross - linking employed by all clip methods leads to formation of a covalent bond between the rna and protein .
upon proteinase digestion to release the rna after immunoprecipitation , a short poly - peptide is left at the cross - link site which subsequently stalls reverse transcription in 80 - 100 % of cdnas ( sugimoto et al. , 2012 ) .
the original clip method relies on read - through across the deposited polypeptide during reverse transcription into a 5 ' adapter , and therefore does n't identify the majority of cdnas that truncate at cross - link sites .
this loss is avoided by the individual nucleotide resolution clip ( iclip ) , a method that captures the truncated cdnas resulting from stalled reverse transcription and thereby enables a more efficient and comprehensive analysis of protein - rna interactions ( konig et al. , 2010 ) ( fig. 1a ) .
importantly , the truncation sites in iclip enable nucleotide - resolution analysis of cross - link sites .
the challenge to identify functionally relevant rbp targets of an rbp is particularly great for rbps that bind to pre - mrnas in the nucleus .
due to the great length of pre - mrnas , a binding site for an rbp is present in most expressed pre - mrnas .
if sequencing is carried out to sufficient depth , clip studies typically identify multiple binding sites of each rbp in most expressed pre - mrnas .
it is therefore crucial that clip data are quantitative , in order to identify discrete regions where high cross - linking density corresponds to high - affinity binding .
iclip was developed to preserve the quantitative information by using primers for reverse transcription that contain a random barcode .
analysis of this random sequence enables computational filtering of high - throughput sequencing data to remove the artefacts caused by variable pcr amplification of different sequences ( sugimoto et al. , 2012 ) .
an alternative method to increase the efficiency of clip employs photoactivatable ribonucleoside enhanced cross - linking and immuno - precipitation ( par - clip ) ( hafner et al. , 2010 ) .
however , this method has yet to be used in the brain due to challenges facing the required incorporation of synthetic nucleosides in vivo .
a recent review on these technologies provides a more detailed discussion on the quality - control steps that can be taken when using these and other high - throughput studies for studying protein - rna interactions ( konig et al. , 2011 ) .
produce a rank - ordered list of rna - abundance normalised data a crucial step in the analysis of clip data is to identify sites where rbps bind with high - affinity , which can be identified by clusters of reads ( in clip ) or clusters of cross - link events ( in iclip or par - clip ) .
this in turn acts to reduce the prediction of false positive rna targets .
the most common approach used in the past studies is to calculate the probability that a cluster of reads that is present in a specific genomic region ( such as an intron or a gene ) is statistically significant when real clip data are compared to randomised clip data within the same region ( konig et al. , 2010 ; yeo et al. , 2009 ) .
this approach is particularly appropriate for studying intronic binding events , since intronic rna abundance has rarely been comprehensively quantified with current high - throughput sequencing methods .
one way to approximately measure intronic abundance is to use the average intronic read density of clip data .
to normalise mrna abundance for rbps that bind to mrnas , mrna sequencing ( rnaseq ) should be carried out simultaneously with clip experiments , and used to normalise the number of clip reads by the rnaseq reads ( kishore et al. 2011 ) ( fig. 1b ) .
the primary objective of this approach is to filter the regions with enriched clip reads from those which have widespread clip reads due to high rna abundance .
this normalisation is particularly important when cliping from heterogenous populations of cells in the brain , where expression of mrna targets can vary greatly , and often the mrnas with low expression have important cell - type specific functions .
the clip / rnaseq ratio can then be used to produce a rank - ordered list of rnas ( darnell et al. , 2011 ; konig et al. , 2010 ; polymenidou et al. , 2011 ) .
past studies have defined groups of high , medium and low confidence targets for further analyses ( darnell et al. , 2011 ; konig et al. , 2010 ; polymenidou et al. , 2011 ) .
an alternative approach would be to avoid the arbitrary thresholds , and instead use rank - ordered lists as in the sylamer method , which detects microrna target sites from a rank - ordered list of genes ( van dongen et al. , 2008 ) .
a similar approach has recently been used to evaluate the likely mrna targets of fmrp ( ascano et al. , 2012 ) .
use comparative genomics to identify the conserved binding sites evolutionary conservation of the sequence motifs bound by the protein can support the functional importance of the rna binding site ( fig. 1c ) .
for instance , analysis of the rna motifs that confer nova binding around its regulated exons demonstrated their high conservation between vertebrate species in clip identified targets ( jelen et al. , 2007 ) .
it was found that the most highly conserved nova binding sites were in genes with indispensable functions in synaptic development .
nevertheless , it must be considered that the analysis of conserved sites will bias against the sites that are functional and contribute to phenotypic diversity within and between species .
use independent functional methods genome - wide studies have revealed that rbps often control diverse aspects of post - transcriptional regulation .
initial biochemical studies were based on a small number of regulated rnas , therefore rbps that regulate splicing were often classified as splicing repressors or enhancers .
studies of nova showed that it can enhance or repress exon inclusion in many different rna targets ( ule et al. , 2005 ) , and this has now been seen also for most other rbps within the subset that are implicated in splicing regulation ( witten and ule , 2011 ) .
moreover , nova governs the usage of alternative polyadenylation sites ( licatalosi et al. , 2008 ) , and can also control mrna localisation ( racca et al. , 2010 ) .
similarly , a comprehensive functional evaluation of mbnl1 demonstrated its functions in pre - mrna processing , translation and control of rna localisation ( wang et al. , 2012 ) .
specifically it was found that mbnl1 bound transcripts showed a change in ribosomal footprints and redistribution from the membrane fraction to the insoluble fraction upon mbnl1 / mbnl2 knockdown .
due to this multifunctionality of rbps , the full functional validation of clip datasets will remain a challenge in the years to come .
integration of clip with multiple genome - wide methods including rnaseq , ribosom profiling ( ingolia et al. , 2011 ) , mrna localisation studies ( wang et al. , 2012 ) and others will be required to determine the full set of functionally relevant rna targets of an rbp ( fig. 1d ) .
define position - dependent regulatory principles , or " rna maps " integration of clip data with analysis of global changes of splicing has been used to identify the global positional principles governing the splicing functions of nova ( licatalosi et al. , 2008 ; ule et al. , 2006 ) .
the combined findings excitingly identified a position - dependent regulation of these transcripts by nova proteins and were used to define an rna map in which exon exclusion is facilitated by binding close to branch points , splice sites or within exons , and exon inclusion favoured by nova binding downstream of exons ( fig. 1e ) .
notably , binding sites close to the flanking exons also mediated predictable outcomes ( ule et al. , 2006 ) .
among others , this approach has now been used for tdp - 43 / tardbp ( herein referred to as tdp - 43 ) ( polymenidou et al. , 2011 ; tollervey et al. , 2011a ) , tia1 / tial1 ( wang et al. , 2010 ) , fus / tls ( herein referred to as fus ) ( lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ; rogelj et al. , 2012 ) , fox2 ( yeo et al. , 2009 ) , ptbp1 ( xue et al. , 2009 ) and mbnl1 ( wang et al. , 2012 ) , and has shown that many rbps have common positional principles in the regulation of splicing .
moreover , an rna map also underlined the position - dependent activity of nova proteins in alternative polyadenylation ( licatalosi et al. , 2008 ) .
the integrative analysis has three main advantages .
firstly , the rna map can validate the high quality of data by demonstrating that binding position correlates with the effect of the protein ( enhanced vs. repressed ) , and that binding at these positions in the regulated rnas is significantly enriched relative to the control rnas .
secondly , since the rna map defines the positions where rbps bind to have functional impact , it enables separation of those changes observed in rnaseq data that are the result of direct effects of the rbp from those that may result from indirect effects .
this is particularly important for studies in the brain , since manipulation of rbps can lead to developmental defects , cell stress , changes in neuronal networks or glia - neuron interactions , sirna off - targets , and other effects that can indirectly change gene expression .
thirdly , the positional pattern in the rna map can reveal new regulatory mechanisms employed by the rbps .
for instance , rna maps demonstrated that the enhancer elements are most often located immediately downstream of exons .
moreover , they showed that certain rbps can also regulate splicing via distal binding sites ( witten and ule , 2011 ) .
cliping the brain in health and disease to date , rna binding profiles of several rbps involved in neurologic disorders have been investigated either in cell culture , transgenic animal models , or human post - mortem tissue ( table 1 ) .
here we choose representative rbps to demonstrate how clip studies helped understand their activity in the cns , and thereby provide the foundation for understanding their role in disease pathologies .
nova paraneoplastic opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia is a neurological disorder mediated by autoimmune attack against onconeural disease antigens including nova - 1 ( buckanovich et al. , 1993 ) and nova - 2 ( yang et al. , 1998 ) , and was the study of initial clip experiments .
low - throughput ( ule et al. , 2003 ) and , more recently , high - throughput ( licatalosi et al. , 2008 ) sequencing of nova clip libraries revealed the rna map in which exon exclusion is facilitated by binding close to branch points , splice sites or within exon , and exon inclusion favoured by binding downstream of exons ( ule et al. , 2006 ) .
activity is specifically directed by binding to ycay clusters within target genes , with nuclear - cytoplasmic shuttling of certain targets possible due to nova 's nuclear localisation and nuclear export sequences ( racca et al. , 2010 ) .
this has been followed up by showing that nova can act outside of splicing to regulate alternative polyadenylation through binding of clusters flanking poly - a sites , although the relevance to disease remains unknown ( licatalosi et al. , 2008 ). by identifying the mrnas that are directly regulated by nova proteins ( licatalosi et al. , 2008 ; ule et al. , 2006 ) , the nova rna map enabled studies that revealed how specific mrnas mediate the function of nova proteins in the brain .
in particular , defective splicing of agrn and dab1 leads to defects in the formation of the neuromuscular junction and in neuronal migration in the cns of the nova1 - / - / nova2 - / - mice , respectively ( ruggiu et al. , 2009 ; yano et al. , 2010 ) .
fmrp loss of function of fragile - x mental retardation protein ( fmrp ) is responsible for fragile - x syndrome , the most common inherited form of mental retardation .
fmrp is an important regulator of translation ( khandjian et al. , 2004 ; laggerbauer et al. , 2001 ; li et al. , 2001 ) .
a study using clip in mouse brain reported that fmrp binds the coding sequence of mrnas with little sequence specificity. by uncovering fmrp interacting targets in polyribosomal enriched samples , it was shown that fmrp binding is enriched on open reading frames of a collection of mrnas encoding synaptic transcripts , including multiple receptor complexes and g - protein signalling pathways ( darnell et al. , 2011 ) .
a recent study using fmrp par - clip in hek293 cells additionally reported two binding motifs recognised by fmrp : acuk and wgga ( in which k = g or u and w = a or u ) .
an integration of par - clip data with motif analysis was used to determine a ranked enrichment of fmrp mrna targets .
interestingly , 93 of the top ranked genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorders ( angelman , prader - willi , rett , and cornelia de lange syndromes ) .
fmrp was found to regulate protein levels of several of these genes in human cell culture , mouse ovaries and human brain ( ascano et al. , 2012 ) .
interestingly , a recent study of celf4 , another neuronal rbp , showed that it shares more than 30 % of its rna targets with fmrp , and is even more strongly enriched in transcripts linked to autism spectrum disorders ( wagnon et al. , 2012 ) .
mbnl muscleblind - like proteins ( mbnl1 and mbnl2 ) are sequestered in various tissues within the neuromuscular diseases of myotonic dystrophy types 1 ( dm1 ) and 2 ( dm2 ) in response to expansions of cug repeats in the 3'utr of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( dmpk ) ( harley et al. , 1992 ; mahadevan et al. , 1992 ) , or ccug repeats in the zinc finger protein 9 ( znf9 ) ( ranum et al. , 1998 ) , respectively .
previously known to be regulators of splicing , two groups have now integrated clip , rnaseq and ribosome profiling to confirm that nuclear mbnl proteins bind introns , coding sequences and 3'utrs at ugc or gcu - containing 4 - mers to dictate splicing changes and identify direct targets for splicing regulation based on clip - identified binding ( charizanis et al. , 2012 ; wang et al. , 2012 ) .
the rna map reveals that mbnl proteins bind in upstream introns and alternative exons to promote exclusion , and in downstream introns to promote inclusion of exons .
further , a previously described role of mbnl proteins in regulating localisation in the cytoplasm ( adereth et al. , 2005 ) was extended transcriptome - wide , whilst the aforementioned regulation of the translation state of 3'utrs carrying mbnl1 binding sites provides further insight into disease mechanisms when this protein is sequestered ( wang et al. , 2012 ) .
it will now be important to assess if these perturbations in patient samples with cug repeats correlate with disease severity .
fus and tdp - 43 als and ftld are two diseases with phenotypic and mechanistic overlap ( ferrari et al. , 2011 ; lagier - tourenne and cleveland , 2009 ) .
familial mutations to tdp - 43 and fus have been identified in each disease ( broustal et al. , 2010 ; kabashi et al. , 2008 ; kwiatkowski et al. , 2009 ; van langenhove et al. , 2010 ; vance et al. , 2009 ) , and these proteins aggregate abnormally in neurons during disease progression .
despite these common links , clip studies of tdp - 43 and fus did not find a significant overlap in their rna binding sites .
whereas tdp - 43 has a strong specificity to bind distinct ug - rich rna regions ( polymenidou et al. , 2011 ; tollervey et al. , 2011a ) , fus binds with mild specificity to g - rich motifs along the full - length of pre - mrna transcripts ( ishigaki et al. , 2012 ; lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ; rogelj et al. , 2012 ) .
another observation made by fus clip was a saw - tooth binding pattern along long introns , similar to that seen in total rnaseq ( ameur et al. , 2011 ; lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ; rogelj et al. , 2012 ) .
however , whether this binding profile is distinct and disease - relevant remains a matter of debate .
this pattern is readily observed for fus in long introns ( ameur et al. , 2011 ; lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ) , but can also be observed in shorter introns using the increased coverage and quantitative ability of the iclip method ( rogelj et al. , 2012 ) .
although suggested to be unique to fus ( lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ) , iclip analysis showed that tdp - 43 , u2af65 and fus all had a linear increase in crosslinking as the distance from the 3 ' splice site increases , similar to the increase in total rnaseq ( rogelj et al. , 2012 ) .
this suggests that the saw - tooth pattern may be an indirect result of the variable abundance of the intronic rna , which increases linearly with the distance from the 3 ' splice site .
interestingly , fus and tdp - 43 regulate splicing of different alternative exons ( lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ; rogelj et al. , 2012 ) .
however , analysis of rnaseq data showed an overlap in the long genes , which were sensitive to loss of function of fus and tdp - 43 in transgenic models and in neurons derived from patients with familial mutations to fus ( lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ; polymenidou et al. , 2011 ) .
it will be important to understand the mechanisms behind changes in expression of long genes , and their role in disease pathology .
whereas the effect on long genes may involve novel transcriptional functions of tdp - 43 and fus , it could also result from accumulated defects in pre - mrna processing .
rbps can promote stability of mrnas by preventing recognition of cryptic exons ; for example , knockdown of hnrnpc leads to widespread expression of cryptic exons , which can result in decreased gene expression .
in the absence of hnrnp c , cryptic exons are recognised by u2af65 , a splicing factor that initiates the recognition of 3 ' splice sites ( zarnack et al. , 2012 ) .
rna splicing maps demonstrate that similar to hnrnp c , fus and tdp - 43 bind close to 3 ' splice sites to repress splicing , where they might displace u2af65 ( rogelj et al. , 2012 ; tollervey et al. , 2011a ) .
due to the saw - tooth pattern , u2af65 has increased binding in long introns ( rogelj et al. , 2012 ) , which could increase the danger of recognising cryptic exons , and thereby decreasing expression of long genes .
aberrant binding of u2af65 could be caused by loss of other rbps that regulate splicing in the brain .
therefore , it will be important to study gene expression in transgenic models of other rbps to assess if the effect on long genes is specific to tdp - 43 and fus .
future considerations for clip studies in the cns clip and its variants are now the primary method for studying protein - rna interactions and we have described how several early high - throughput studies have provided invaluable insights into the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases .
this includes the identification of putative rna targets and understanding the way in which an rbp acts through looking at its specificity and the regions bound within a transcript .
it is likely that clip - based approaches will remain popular , in part due to recent method developments making it a more robust , and also following the recent identification of many new candidate rbps using the global crosslinking - based purification ( baltz et al. , 2012 ; castello et al. , 2012 ) .
we explain the limitations in reporting a precise number of rna targets of an rbp based on clip .
clip tags alone are not sufficient to determine the functionally relevant binding sites of rbps .
therefore it is important to integrate clip with other approaches in order to identify the rnas that are bound and directly regulated by the rbps .
for rbps interacting with mrnas we encourage the use of normalisation of clip clusters to transcript abundance either using rnaseq , whereas other approaches are necessary for clip data normalisation of rbps binding pre - mrnas .
evaluation of evolutionary conservation , integration of complementary high - throughput methods , and generation of rna maps can help to unify the identification of functionally relevant rna targets for subsequent studies .
one application of clip that remains to be widely applied is the study of protein - rna interactions in human postmortem tissues ( tollervey et al. , 2011a ) .
it is important to appreciate that cell stress and neuronal loss can obscure the causative mechanisms in postmortem tissues .
this has become particularly apparent from the study of gene expression of ftld and alzheimer disease temporal cortex , which found widespread yet identical changes in gene expression ( tollervey et al. , 2011b ) .
whilst clip techniques are compatible with partially degraded postmortem tissue , it is important to appreciate that there are many variables in sample preparation that can affect the quality of the sample .
this can include the length to autopsy and sample collection , as well as the fixation and freezing methods employed .
therefore special care needs to be taken when analysing data produced from samples collected under variable conditions .
the studies of postmortem tissues are also inevitably correlative , since it is not possible to go back to the human tissue to manipulate the function of the rbp .
therefore , it is important to additionally study the relevant protein - rna interactions in disease model systems .
transgenic animal models have been used most often but a new opportunity is arising in the study of pluripotent stem cell ( psc ) disease models ( patani et al. , 2012 ) .
induced pscs ( ipscs ) of tdp - 43 m337v mutation have now been generated which have elevated levels of tdp - 43 protein and decreased survival following neuronal differentiation ( bilican et al. , 2012 ) , whilst fus has already been knocked down in differentiated neural stem cells and displayed comparative changes to both transgenic models and patient tissue ( lagier - tourenne et al. , 2012 ) .
if disease phenotype continues to be recapitulated for other disease - associated proteins , then ipscs will represent an invaluable sample source for future clip studies .
over the next years , we can expect more clip studies to assess rna interactions of multiple rbps at a specific stage of brain development , which will enable comprehensive comparative studies .
it will be possible at that point to define the phenomena specific to rbps involved in neurodegenerative disorders , and separate these from the more general aspects of protein - rna interactions .

** this article is part of a special issue entitled : rna and splicing regulation in neurodegeneration. fig. 1 identifying rna targets of an rbp with clip .
a ) schematic representation of hits - clip , clip - seq and iclip procedures .
samples are initially cross - linked with 254 nm uv before being lysed and the rbp - of - interest immuno precipitated together with bound rna .
a 3 ' adapter is ligated to the rna and integrity of rbp - rna complexes examined following isotopic labelling and denaturing electrophoresis ( not shown ) .
rna is released from the rbp by proteinase digestion .
in standard clip protocol ( used in hits - clip , clip - seq and par - clip ) , a 5 ' adapter is ligated to the released rna - - therefore , only the cdnas that pass across the cross - link site can be identified .
in iclip , the second adapter is included as an overhang on the primer used for reverse transcription .
circularisation of cdnas , followed by linearisation , enables iclip to identify the cdnas truncating at the cross - link site .
b ) normalisation to rnaseq reveals enriched clusters of tdp - 43 binding to the gria2 3'utr above background in the embryonic day 18 mouse brain ( red box ) , and shows that binding to the 3'utr of the beta - actin transcript is an artefact of high rna abundance .
scales on y - axis represent number of clip / rnaseq tags detected .
c ) evolutionary conservation of repressive nova binding sites around an alternative exon of neogenin 1 .
d ) confidence in the identification of clip targets can be improved when clip data is compared to other high - throughput approaches in which the rbp is manipulated .
this can include ribosome profiling and knockdown rnaseq analysis of different cell fractions to assess changes in locations .
e ) clip data can be integrated into rna maps which predict how rbp binding determines mechanistic outcomes on an rna target .

the term leishmaniasis comprises of a group of diseases caused by different species of a protozoan called leishmania .
there are three main clinical forms of leishmaniasis : visceral leishmaniasis , cutaneous leishmaniasis , and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis .
exclusive involvement of the mucosa is very rare .
we present a case of mucosal leishmaniasis located in the oral cavity .
the only manifestation of leishmaniasis disease in the described case was the appearance of an oral lesion .
treatment was provided in the form of antimoniates ( oral miltefosine and systemic sodium stibogluconate ) .
a review of literature is made on the subject .
1. introduction the term leishmaniasis comprises of a group of diseases caused by a species of protozoan called leishmania , transmitted by female sandflies of the genera phlebotomus and lutzomyia .
it belongs to the family trypanosomatidae , genus : leishmania .
synonyms for leishmaniasis are kala azar , meaning black fever in india , and espundia ( mucocutaneous form ) .
leishmaniasis is found worldwide and is considered to be endemic in 88 countries [ 1 , 2 ] .
the incidence of leishmaniasis as an opportunistic disease has increased in recent years because of the growing number of patients with immune depression secondary to chronic illnesses , neoplasms , immunosuppressive treatments , transplants , and hiv infection [ 1 , 3 ] .
its prevalence is 12 million infected individuals worldwide with a global incidence of 1.5 - 2 million new cases per year .
leishmaniasis is responsible for approximately 70,000 to 80,000 deaths a year [ 4 ] .
it occurs in three clinical forms - - cutaneous , mucocutaneous , and visceral [ 3 ] .
in the literature two different versions are discussed , that is , old world cutaneous leishmaniasis ( owcl ) and new world cutaneous leishmaniasis ( nwcl ) .
cutaneous leishmaniasis ( cl ) causes skin sores and chronic ulcers .
it is generally self - limiting but can be a chronic and progressive disease in a proportion of cases .
mucocutaneous leishmaniasis caused by leishmania species in africa and america affects the nasal , oral , and pharyngeal mucosa , producing a disabling and mutilating disease .
visceral leishmaniasis affects the spleen , liver , bone marrow , and lymph nodes , producing fever and anaemia .
it is usually fatal if untreated .
leishmaniasis afflicts males and females in the ratio of 2 : 1 .
in immunocompromised patients , oral mucosa is the second most frequently affected site of the head and neck region .
in the oral cavity , tongue is the most affected site .
mucocutaneous disease is due to extension of local skin disease into the mucosal tissue via direct extension , bloodstream , or lymphatics .
lesions mainly involve the oral and nasal mucosa and occasionally the laryngeal and pharyngeal mucosa .
if not recognized and adequately treated , it may disfigure the patient because of chronic local destruction of the tissues of the nose , pharynx , and palate .
generally , mucosal involvement develops 1 - 5 years after the healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis , though in some cases mucosal and skin lesions may coincide .
approximately 90 % of patients present with prior cutaneous scar .
occasionally , mucosal lesions may also appear in patients with no previous skin lesions [ 5 ] .
exclusive involvement of the mucosa is very rare .
we present a case of leishmaniasis where the only manifestation of disease in the reported case was the appearance of oral lesions without cutaneous involvement .
2. case report a 51 - year - old male reported to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery , king george 's medical university , india , with chief complaint of bleeding gums and ulceration of mouth leading to difficulty in mastication and swallowing ( figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
past medical history was suggestive of fever 1 month back with lymphadenopathy .
personal history revealed the patient to be a driver by profession with habit of tobacco chewing and smoking since last 5 years .
on general examination , there were no lesions / scars on skin of face , trunks , and extremities and also there was no history of previous cutaneous lesion .
on intraoral examination , there were present tender , diffuse , and multiple ulcerated nodules ( less than 1 cm ) on the hard and soft palate with surface hoarseness .
associated maxillary labial gingiva presented with cobblestone appearance , had marked erythema and was excrescent with granular inflammation .
oral hygiene was poor and lesions bled on exploration .
in our case , there was exclusive involvement of oral mucosa of maxillary labial / buccal surface and palate without cutaneous involvement .
neck examination revealed bilaterally enlarged and tender submandibular lymph nodes .
ent opinion was taken for dysphagia and was given symptomatic treatment .
patient was investigated with biopsy of the lesion from two different sites .
one tissue sample was taken from maxillary labial gingiva and the second from lateral margin of palate from the edge of ulcer .
hematoxylin - eosin ( h & e ) and giemsa staining of the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leishmaniasis ( figures 4 and 5 ) .
patient 's routine blood investigation revealed leukocytosis .
viral markers , that is , hiv , hbsag , and hcv , were nonreactive .
patient was treated with oral miltefosine and systemic sodium stibogluconate : 100 mg miltefosine daily as one capsule ( 50 mg ) in the morning and one capsule ( 50 mg ) in the evening , after meals for 28 days , and 20 mg sodium stibogluconate ( 0.2 ml pentostam ) per kg bodyweight daily intravenously for 30 days .
patient was regularly monitored through out with blood investigations and ecg during the course of treatment .
local lesion care ( oral prophylaxis , anesthetic and astringent mouthwash ) and management of secondary bacterial infection were additionally carried out .
patient responded well to the treatment with regression of lesions ( figure 6 ) .
patient did not turn up for prolonged follow - up visits so complete ( 100 %) degree of cure could not be assessed .
3. discussion leishmaniasis is an infection by protozoans of the genus leishmania .
early descriptions of the leishmanial parasite in cutaneous lesions were done by cunningham , borovsky , and wright between 1885 and 1903 [ 6 ] .
other forms of leishmaniasis were described later .
in 1903 , leishman and donovan separately described a protozoan parasite found in the splenic tissue of patients in india [ 7 , 8 ] .
their simultaneous discovery of the protozoan now called leishmania donovani first alerted the scientific community to the life threatening disease of visceral leishmaniasis .
this illness was included by the world health organisation in the list of neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination by 2015 [ 9 ] .
now a century later , millions are still afflicted by leishmania .
it is a disease known for its complexity and diversity .
it is endemic , in regions ranging from the rainforests of south america to the deserts of asia , and afflicts both rural and urban communities .
a host of about 21 different species of leishmaniasis is classified under its primary syndromes : cutaneous , mucocutaneous , and visceral , which result from parasite multiplication in macrophages in the skin , nasal - oral mucosa , and internal organs , respectively .
these protozoan species are transmitted by over 30 species of phlebotomine sand flies .
clinical manifestation of leishmaniasis depends on the interaction between the characteristic virulence of the species and the host immune response [ 10 ] .
mucosal leishmaniasis is a chronic infection of the mucosal membranes , which in most cases is primary but may develop during or after an attack of visceral leishmaniasis .
there are at least 30 species of leishmania , of which 12 named and several unnamed species affect man [ 11 ] .
3.1 .
pathogenesis leishmania lives two quiet separate lives - - one in the sandfly and the other in mammals .
in the sandfly , the organism exists as the promastigote ( leptomonad ) , and in tissue it exists as the amastigote ( leishmanial or aflagellar form ) [ 12 ] .
the vector sucks the blood of humans or mammals , containing the protozoan in its amastigote form ( lacking a flagellum ) .
once within the intestine of the vector , the parasite transforms into a promastigote ( equipped with a flagellum ) and reproduces as such. from the intestine of the vector , the protozoan then migrates to the esophagus , where it is expelled into the skin of the host when the insect bites the host , followed by invasion of the bloodstream and different tissues .
the promastigotes are phagocytosed by the macrophages of the host reticuloendothelial system , where they lose the flagellum and once again transform into amastigotes [ 1 , 4 ] .
when the infected cells are destroyed , the parasite infects new cells and thus spreads throughout the body .
histological picture of leishmaniasis consists of epithelium with chronic inflammatory infiltrate mainly composed of plasma cells and histiocytes , with cytoplasm invaded by leishmania parasites .
leishmaniasis has been reported from different parts of the world and in almost all cases involves the oral mucosa [ 13 - 15 ] .
a case has been reported in literature where recurrent mucosal leishmaniasis was associated with good syndrome ( characterized by immunodeficiency in patients with thymoma ) and was treated by multiple treatment regimens .
immunodeficiency needs to be highly suspected in patients suffering from recurrent leishmaniasis [ 16 , 17 ] .
the world health organization ( who ) estimates that 2 - 3 % of aids patients have developed leishmaniasis as opportunistic infection [ 1 ] .
mucosal leishmaniasis caused by leishmania braziliensis is known to affect 1 - 10 % of cases , generally developing 1 - 5 years after the healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis , though in some cases mucosal and skin lesions may occur simultaneously [ 5 ] .
it is the most feared form of cutaneous leishmaniasis because it produces destructive and disfiguring lesions of the face .
it is more common in workers , travelers and visitors to rural and forested areas in countries or areas at risk .
3.2 .
treatment the treatment of choice in all clinical forms of leishmaniasis is the administration of antimonial drugs such as meglumine antimoniate ( glucantime ) and sodium stibogluconate ( pentostam ) .
meglumine is given in doses of 20 mg / kg b.w. / day , via the intramuscular or intravenous route , to a maximum of 850 mg / day , for at least 20 days .
the possible adverse effects of these drugs are myalgia , joint pain , anorexia , nausea , vomiting , headache , hypertransaminasemia , chemical pancreatitis , thrombocytopenia , and neutropenia .
sodium stibogluconate ( pentostam ) dosage recommendations are based on the findings of the who expert committee on leishmaniasis which met in 2010 .
visceral leishmaniasis .
20 mg pentavalent antimony ( 0.2 ml pentostam ) per kg bodyweight daily is given intramuscularly or intravenously for 30 days ( or 28 days for l. infantum ) .
patients should be examined for evidence of relapse after 2 and 6 months .
cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by old world species .
in certain cases of old world cl ( owcl ) , lesions have seen to spontaneously heal without any need for therapeutic intervention .
local therapies ( thermotherapy , cryotherapy , paromomycin ointment , and local infiltration with antimonials ) are good options with less systemic toxicity , reserving systemic treatments ( azole drugs , miltefosine , antimonials , and amphotericin b formulations ) mainly for complex cases .
for lesions requiring local therapy : 100 - 500 mg intralesional pentavalent antimony ( 1 - 5 ml sodium stibogluconate injection ) per session every 3 - 7 days for 1 - 5 sessions .
for lesions requiring systemic therapy : 20 mg / kg pentavalent antimony ( 0.2 ml sodium stibogluconate injection ) intramuscularly or intravenously for 10 - 20 days .
monotherapy with sodium stibogluconate is not recommended for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by l. aethiopica .
cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by new world species .
the majority of new world cl ( nwcl ) cases require systemic treatment ( mainly with pentavalent antimonials ) , either to speed healing or to prevent dissemination to oral - nasal mucosa as mucocutaneous leishmaniasis [ 18 ] .
for lesions requiring local therapy : 100 mg - 500 mg intralesional pentavalent antimony ( 1 - 5 ml sodium stibogluconate injection ) per session every 3 - 7 days for 1 - 5 sessions .
for lesions requiring systemic therapy : 20 mg / kg pentavalent antimony ( 0.2 ml sodium stibogluconate injection ) intramuscularly or intravenously for 20 days .
mucocutaneous leishmaniasis .
patients should be treated with 20 mg pentavalent antimony ( 0.2 ml pentostam ) per kg bodyweight daily intramuscularly or intravenously for 30 days and intralesional injection of sodium stibogluconate ( 0.5 to 1.0 ml ) can be effective .
it offers less expensive alternative and low side effects [ 19 ] .
alternative treatment drugs are amphotericin b , pentamidine , rifampicin , or ketoconazole .
other drugs that have been used for treatment are phenothiazines , paromomycin , allopurinol , itraconazole , cyclosporine , miltefosine , dapsone , aminosidine , and interferon .
additional management options include surgery , topical treatments , immunotherapy , and infrared heat [ 5 , 20 , 21 ] .
genetic studies have been conducted for leishmaniasis that include comparing genetic polymorphism of leishmania ( viannia ) braziliensis in cases of mucosal leishmaniasis from hiv - infected and non - hiv - infected patients .
results have shown genetically divergent profiles in the cutaneous and mucosal lesions of the same hiv - infected patient [ 22 ] .
differential diagnosis of oral mucosal leishmaniasis must be established with fungal infections ( blastomycosis ) , syphilis , tuberculosis , leprosy , sarcoidosis , midline granuloma , wegener 's disease , and neoplasms , among other disorders [ 23 , 24 ] .
4. conclusion most common form of leishmaniasis is cutaneous leishmaniasis ; however exclusive involvement of oral mucosa is rare as in our case .
localized oral mucosal leishmaniasis is an uncommon event in an immunocompetent patient .
dentists play an important role in the diagnosis of oral leishmaniasis , which has systemic infestations .
diagnosing oral leishmaniasis presents a challenge but must be considered in differential diagnosis of exophytic lesions of oral mucosa .
early diagnosis is necessary to provide prompt treatment and to avoid recurrences .

the 4 - 1bb signal pathway plays a key role in organ transplantation tolerance .
in this study , we have investigated the effect of gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference ( rnai ) on the acute rejection in rats with liver transplantation .
the recombination vector of lentivirus that contains shrna targeting the 4 - 1bb gene ( lv - sh4 - 1bb ) was constructed .
the liver transplantation was performed using the two - cuff technique .
brown - norway ( bn ) recipient rats were infected by the recombinant lvs .
the results showed that gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rnai downregulated the 4 - 1bb gene expression of the splenic lymphocytes in vitro , and the splenic lymphocytes isolated from the rats with liver transplantation .
lv - sh4 - 1bb decreased the plasma levels of liver injury markers including ast , alt , and bil and also decreased the level of plasma il - 2 and ifn - gamma in recipient rats with liver transplantation .
lentivirus - mediated delivery of shrna targeting 4 - 1bb gene prolonged the survival time of recipient and alleviated the injury of liver morphology in recipient rats with liver transplantation .
in conclusion , our results demonstrate that gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference inhibits the acute rejection in rats with liver transplantation .
1. introduction costimulatory pathways between antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) and tcells play a crucial role in t - cells activation and alloimmune responses [ 1 , 2 ] .
4 - 1bb is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily .
the functions of receptor mainly as a costimulatory molecule in t lymphocytes .
4 - 1bb is expressed in activated t cells and antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells [ 3 ] .
4 - 1bb / 4 - 1bb ligand ( 4 - 1bbl ) signaling provides t - cells activation with costimulation , that is , dependent or independent of cd28 [ 4 ] .
4 - 1bb can supply sufficient costimulatory signals for t - cells activation [ 5 ] .
under the condition of repeated antigen stimulation , the downregulationg expresion of cd28 protein in activated t cells results in activation - induced celll death ( aicd ) , whereas very few 4 - 1bb molecules may supply sufficient costimulatory signals to sustain t - cells activation and inhibit aicd [ 6 ] .
as we all know , the liver transplantation is an effective therapy for end - stage liver disease .
but the transplantation rejective response is a formidable problem after liver transplantation , especially acute rejection which is the main cause of early dysfunction and transplantation failure [ 7 ] .
the incidence rate of acute rejection after liver transplantation is up to 50 % to 70 % [ 8 ] .
the acute rejection after the organ transplantation is mainly caused by the activation of the immune system in the host .
during the acute rejection , t cells are the most important effectors involved in antigen recognition , lymphcyte proliferation and differentiation , and immune regulation , cytolysis .
4 - 1bb plays a critical role in allograft rejection [ 9 , 10 ] .
our previous study illuminated that the blockade of the 4 - 1bb / 4 - 1bbl costimulatory pathway with 4 - 1bbl monoclonal antibody decreased the acute rejection in rat with liver transplantation [ 11 ] .
rna interference - ( rnai - ) mediated gene silencing can be generated by the expression of a vector - mediated rnai anywhere in the genome and is already being tested as a potential therapy in clinical trials for a number of diseases [ 12 , 13 ] .
the viral - based vectors have been developed as an alternative strategy of gene therapy .
therefore , the aim of present study was to investigate the effect of gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference on the acute rejection in rats with liver transplantation .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
lentiviral vectors the design of sirna was performed according to the previously published guidelines by using the ambion sirna - finding software [ 14 ] .
to minimize off - target effects , a blast homology search was systematically performed to ensure that a single - mrna sequence was targeted .
replication - deficient , self - inactivating lentiviral vectors pcdna - cmv - sh4 - 1bb - lentivector ( lv - sh4 - 1bb ) and the empty vector ( lv - nc ) were generated as follows .

but these phenomenons were not observed in lv - sh4 - 1bb1 group ( figure 8 ) .
4. discussion the orthotopic liver transplantation has become the most effective therapy for the patients with end - stage liver disease .
however , organ rejection is a thorny problem after transplantation , especially acute rejection which is the main cause of early dysfunction and retransplantation [ 21 ] .
therefore , it is very important to search new and effective methods to prevent and inhibit the organ rejection response in organ transplantation .
transplantation rejective response is principally mediated by t cells in the peripheral circulation and a variety of inflammatory stimuli that induce t cells to infiltrate the transplanted tissue [ 22 ] .
cd4 + t cells secrete a number of cytokines which may induce cell infiltration in the graft after allogeneic recognition , and cd8 + t cells are involved in the direct cytotoxicity towards the liver graft [ 23 ] .
deletion , anergy , regulation / suppression , ignorance , or induction of activation induced t - cell death will be ways to suppress acute rejection and induce immune tolerance [ 24 ] .
4 - 1bb is a family member of tumor necrosis factor receptor .
4 - 1bb is an important t - cell costimulatory molecule and expressed in activated cytolytic and helper t cells , as well as natural killers ( nk ) cells .
the ligand of 4 - 1bb ( 4 - 1bbl ) is expressed in b cells , macrophages , and dendritic cells .
4 - 1bb signaling preferentially promotes the proliferation and survival of cd8 + t cells and promotes the production of il - 2 in cd4 + t cells and prevents activation - induced cell death .
4 - 1bb is involved in the activation and survival of cd4 + , cd8 + , and nk cells [ 25 ] .
the activation of t cells in the absence of costimulation is futile because t cells deprived of costimulatory signals enter a state of unresponsiveness or anergy .
the interaction of 4 - 1bb and 4 - 1bbl can activate an important costimulatory pathway which plays the diverse and important roles in immune response and organ transplantation tolerance .
the previous studies showed that blocking the 4 - 1bb / 4 - 1bbl signal pathway might modulate the secretion of th1 / th2 cytokines and prolong the survival of the grafts [ 26 ] .
it was reported that administration of agonistic anti - 4 - 1bb monoclonal antibody ( mab ) prevented the development of various autoimmune and nonautoimmune conditions in vivo [ 27 , 28 ] .
our previous results also suggested the blockade of the 4 - 1bb / 4 - 1bbl costimulatory pathway with 4 - 1bbl monoclonal antibody attenuated the acute rejection in recipient rats with the liver transplantation [ 11 ] .
rnai - based gene silencing is more rapid and cost - effective compared with the gene knockout techniques .
rna interference ( rnai ) is a powerful tool to induce loss - of - function phenotypes by posttranscriptional silencing of gene expression .
viral delivery of short hairpin rna ( shrna ) expression cassettes allows efficient transduction in tissues such as immunological cell in vivo [ 29 ] .
the knockdown of gene expression has been achieved using lentiviral vector constructs that express shrnas within vector - infected cells .
the lentiviral vector system provided useful tools for elucidating gene function by analysis of loss - of - function phenotypes and for exploring the application of rnai in gene therapy [ 30 ] .
in our study , the recombination vector of lentivirus containing shrna targeting the 4 - 1bb gene was successfully constructed .
the liver transplantation was performed using the two - cuff technique .
bn recipient rats were infected by the recombinant lvs .
the results showed that gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference downregulated the 4 - 1bb gene expression of the splenic lymphocytes isolated from the recipient rats with liver transplantation .
our results also showed that lentivirus - mediated delivery of shrna targeting 4 - 1bb gene prolonged the survival time of recipient rats .
these results suggested that the silencing of 4 - 1bb gene by rna interference was successful in the recipient rats and useful for the liver transplantation .
the acute transplantation rejective response is the important cause of retransplantation and is principally mediated by t cells [ 31 ] .
cytokines including il - 2 , il - 10 , and inf - gamma can accelerate the t - cell mediated immune response , while il - 4 , 5 , and 6 can be helpful for b - cell mediated humoral immunity .
increase of cytokines is the marker of the acute transplantation rejective response [ 32 , 33 ] .
our results showed that gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference decreased the levels of plasma il - 2 and inf - gamma seven days after liver transplantation .
these illuminated that gene silencing of 4 - 1bb inhibited the t cell - mediated acute rejection in recipient rats with liver transplantation .
histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosing graft rejection after transplantation [ 34 ] .
there are the infiltration of inflammatory cells to portal area including activated lymphocytes , neutrophils and acidophils , inflammation of endotheliocytes under the portal vein and central vein , and the inflammation and injury of the bile duct in the acute rejection of liver transplantation [ 35 , 36 ] .
the dysfunction of the liver should be observed in the acute rejection of liver transplantation .
in our study , the results showed that gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference decreased the plasma levels of liver injury markers including ast , alt , and bil and alleviated the injury of liver morphology in recipient rats with liver transplantation .
our experiment strongly suggested gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference prevented the liver injury induced by the acute rejection in rats with liver transplantation .
in conclusion , we have demonstrated that gene silencing of 4 - 1bb by rna interference inhibits the acute rejection in rats with liver transplantation and it is a promising strategy to prevent progression of graft rejection .

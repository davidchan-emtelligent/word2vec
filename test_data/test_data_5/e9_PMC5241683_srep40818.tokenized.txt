the use of hourly data restricts existing global and regional analyses to periods larger than 2 h. however , a number of processes occur at minute timescales , of which the most ruinous are tsunamis .
meteotsunamis , hazardous nonseismic waves that occur at tsunami timescales over limited regions , may also locally dominate sea level extremes .
here , we show that nonseismic sea level oscillations at tsunami timescales (< 2 h ) may substantially contribute to global sea level extremes , up to 50 % in low - tidal basins .
the intensity of these oscillations is zonally correlated with mid - tropospheric winds at the 99 % significance level , with the variance doubling from the tropics and subtropics to the mid - latitudes .
specific atmospheric patterns are found during strong events at selected locations in the world ocean , indicating a globally predominant generation mechanism .
our analysis suggests that these oscillations should be considered in sea level hazard assessment studies .
establishing a strong correlation between nonseismic sea level oscillations at tsunami timescales and atmospheric synoptic patterns would allow for forecasting of nonseismic sea level oscillations for operational use , as well as hindcasting and projection of their effects under past , present and future climates .
knowledge of sea level extremes in changing climates is of the utmost importance , as sea level extremes inevitably impact densely populated coastlines1 .
a broad range of processes spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales contribute to these extremes345 , from long - term trends and variability , seasonal changes , planetary and synoptic sea level oscillations , up to the mesoscale .
processes operating at most of these scales have been fairly well documented through global and regional assessment of long - term sea level and remote sensing records678 , as standard tide gauge outputs are available at hourly resolution in global datasets such as the one managed by the university of hawaii ( http :// uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu ) , and remote sensing data have been available since 1993 ( http :// www.aviso.altimetry.fr ) .
still , a number of high - frequency processes that substantially contribute to sea level extremes ( such as tsunamis , meteotsunamis , and infragravity waves ) cannot be properly assessed using hourly data .
the science of tsunamis , due to their global importance and impact , has constantly been at the forefront of sea level research9 , while the remainder of the high - frequency sea level signal , which can be defined as consisting of nonseismic sea level oscillations at tsunami timescales ( nslott ) , has been researched only locally10111213 .
the concept of nslott events refers to all sea level oscillations except tsunamis that appear at periods between a few minutes to a few hours .
extreme realizations of nslott , which are capable of producing damage or impacts in a region , are referred to as meteorological tsunamis or meteotsunamis10 .
no global study assessing the importance of nslott events has been conducted so far , while there are several review papers documenting the world distribution of known meteotsunamis1014 .
recently , after the 2004 sumatra - andaman tsunami15 , the intergovernmental oceanographic commission ( ioc ) coordinated efforts to upgrade sea level observations to minute timescales and to create a global operational database called the sea level station monitoring facility ( http :// www.ioc - sealevelmonitoring.org ) .
this database contains raw , not - quality checked data with a temporal resolution of 1 min , and it is the only global database containing multi - year global sea level observations at tsunami timescales .
an initial regional ( mediterranean ) study using these data showed that nslott events may be dominant over tides during extreme sea level episodes and should thus be included in any sea level assessment13 .
the global distributions of nslott variance and maximum range , in terms of their absolute values and relative to total sea level variance and range , lead to similar conclusions ( fig. 1 ) .
variance is generally not high , up to 2 cm2 , being highest in shelf areas such as the north sea .
however , the tides are also large in the north sea16 ; therefore , nslott contribution to overall sea level variance is less than 0.25 % there .
moreover , nslott contribution to overall sea level variance is not high globally ; this contribution is up to 1.25 % in low - tidal basins such as the mediterranean and is even lower throughout rest of the world ocean .
nslott events are , however , highly changeable in time .
during the most extreme episodes , they may range up to a metre in some basins , such as the north sea and the south atlantic , and even more at specific stations .
the maximum station - averaged range of nslott is greater than 35 cm in all coherent regions of the world ocean , reaching average values up to 85 cm in some basins .
the contributions of nslott events to the overall maximum sea level range may be as high as 50 % in low - tidal areas ( such as the mediterranean and the caribbean ) , surpassing the tidal range .
these oscillations thus have the potential to strongly affect coastlines , especially when they are combined with strong currents , which can be an order of magnitude stronger at tsunami than at tidal frequencies17 .
interestingly , the absolute values of nslott variance and range ( right - hand panels in fig. 1 ) show a zonal pattern that shows generally lower values in the tropical and subtropical regions and increases towards the poles .
averaging over 10degrees zonal belts confirms this ( fig. 2 ) ; the average nslott variance and range are two to three times lower between - 20degreess and 20degreesn than in the mid - latitudes .
zonal distributions of variance and range are correlated at the 90 and 99 % levels , respectively , with zonal average wind speed at the 500 - hpa isobar ( which is located in the middle troposphere at a height of approximately 5.5 km ) .
the former correlation significance increases to the 99 % level when only data from 50degreess - 50degreesn are analysed .
this indicates a lower resemblance between nslott and zonal mid - tropospheric winds at the higher mid - latitudes ( fig. 2 ) , where a decrease in mid - tropospheric winds is not followed by a decrease in the nslott variance .
the importance of mid - tropospheric winds in generating nslott events has been recognized in a number of studies131819 , which show that 500 - hpa winds ( at the level of the mid - tropospheric jet ) are exceptionally strong during nslott events .
the anomalously strong 500 - hpa winds during nslott events are known to co - occur with other patterns , including ( i ) instability of the mid - troposphere jet , ( ii ) winds that quasi - linearly decrease towards the surface , ( iii ) a poleward flow of warm and dry air in the lower troposphere , and ( iv ) a weak surface cyclone barely detectable in surface air pressure charts .
these patterns have so far been recognized in a few regional studies18192021 .
to check for the existence of globally dominant nslott synoptic patterns , we extracted the most extreme nslott episodes ( in terms of their maximum range ) from a number of representative stations with multi - annual high - quality sea level series and related them to the ecmwf ( european centre for middle - range weather forecasts ) era - interim reanalysis fields .
figure 3 displays the atmospheric fields that are found to be characteristic for nslott events and averaged over the 15 strongest nslott episodes in four selected areas .
the maximum / median wave heights measured during these events at esperance ( australia ) , nagasaki ( japan ) , clearwater beach ( the gulf of mexico ) , and bahia mansa ( chile ) stations were equivalent to 101 / 70 , 107 / 74 , 93 / 40 and 152 / 99 cm. these events did not cause any reported damage , even though they constituted at most 50 , 34 , 40 and 42 % of the entire sea level range measured at these stations , respectively .
however , because they were not superimposed on extreme surges , they did not flood the coastal area and infrastructure adapted to such sea level changes .
however , currents may be quite strong during meteotsunami events1018 and normally affect the safety of navigation and harbour infrastructure1422 .
the synoptic patterns over three of the chosen areas are similar to conditions during previously described nslott events , while the synoptic patterns over chile stand out as somewhat different .
during most of the nslott episodes above southeastern australia , japan and the gulf of mexico , ( i ) weak to moderate pressure minima are located above the stations affected .
these minima are accompanied by ( ii ) poleward advection of warm air in the lower troposphere ( at a pressure level of ~ 850 hpa ) and ( iii ) strong mid - tropospheric jets ( speeds of 26 - 32 m / s at pressure levels of ~ 500 hpa ) embedded in ( iv ) unstable atmospheric layers ( ri < 0.25 at pressure levels of ~ 400 - 700 hpa ) .
a common source mechanism associated with such synoptic patterns is known to be responsible for nslott and meteotsunami events in the mediterranean1520 .
this mechanism is called wave ducting2324 and is associated with the generation and horizontal propagation of atmospheric gravity waves in the lower troposphere .
these atmospheric waves are often generated by mid - tropospheric shear25 and can be quite strong below the unstable mid - tropospheric jet .
they are further capped in the stable lower troposphere by the unstable jet and are detectable at the ocean surface as pronounced air pressure disturbances .
the propagation velocity of these pressure disturbances commonly matches the jet velocity2324 .
when the speed of atmospheric disturbances matches the speed of long ocean waves , the resonant transfer of energy from the atmosphere to the ocean occurs through a phenomenon called the proudman resonance26 .
the speed of long ocean waves equals , where g is gravity acceleration and h is water depth .
we hypothesize that proudman resonance occurs during most of the nslott events analysed in this paper .
for example , the mid - tropospheric jet speed of 28 - 32 m / s found during the esperance and nagasaki nslott events ( fig. 3 ) is equivalent to the speed necessary for resonant generation of ocean waves at depths between 80 and 100 m. these depths encompass large portions of the 100 - km wide shelf to the southwest of the esperance station , as well as the 700 - km wide shelf to the southeast of nagasaki station stretching into the east china sea .
it should be noted that the average speed of the mid - tropospheric jet over japan matches the speed of the atmospheric disturbance (~ 31 m / s ) that caused the destructive 1979 ' abiki ' event ( the local japanese name for meteotsunamis ) 1027 .
the slightly lower jet speed ( 26 - 28 m / s ) documented at the clearwater beach station ( fig. 3c ) also matches the depth distribution ( below 100 m ) along the 200 - km wide western florida shelf .
however , the atmospheric patterns related to strong nslott events differ in some world regions , like the chilean coast ( fig. 3d ) , where these events are associated with strong meridional gradients in air pressure .
indeed , intense high - frequency air pressure oscillations may be generated also by the wave - cisk ( convective instability of the second kind ) mechanism , squall lines , frontal passages or other phenomena2829 .
some of these processes are presumably more relevant at the higher mid - latitudes where deep and energetic extratropical cyclones that stretch over the whole troposphere normally form30 .
this analysis indicates a relationship between a certain atmospheric setup and nslott events in an area .
however , quantification of this relationship is a challenge , requiring synthesis of the atmospheric setup into a simple index or indices , which can then be correlated to the nslott intensity .
such an analysis will allow assessment of whether nslott events commonly result from a specific atmospheric setup or not .
a template for this analysis might be the recently introduced meteotsunami index for the area surrounding the balearic islands31 .
this index is a linear combination of a number of atmospheric variables that are highly correlated with high - frequency sea level oscillations measured at a single station .
to conclude , our analysis shows that ( i ) nslott events constitute an important part of the sea level budget in the world ocean and are especially important during extreme episodes , and ( ii ) nslott events are strongly associated with specific atmospheric patterns , suggesting that the wave - ducting mechanism is responsible for generation of tsunamigenic atmospheric disturbances within selected areas of the world ocean .
several important implications emerge from this study .
first , nslott events should be taken into account in any sea level assessment study , particularly when assessing sea level extremes .
these studies also need to include an assessment of other phenomena that contribute to extreme high - frequency sea level oscillations , such as ( i ) tsunamis , whose relevance varies strongly between different oceans , areas and basins32 , and ( ii ) tropical cyclones , which may cause extraordinary high - frequency sea level oscillations and primarily affect low - lying areas within the tropics33 , where nslott oscillations are at a minimum .
second , the global tide gauge network should be standardized to sample at the minute resolution , with quality check procedures implemented before releasing data to the public , as a large number of stations provide problematic data that are corrupted by spikes , offsets , drifts in time and space , scaling changes , etc .
finally , the demonstrated connection between nslott events and atmospheric patterns may be used for nslott forecasting and reconstruction under past , present and future climates and for identifying site - specific correlations between nslott and atmospheric reanalysis patterns , which can later be used to forecast nslott events a week in advance using operational forecasts ( like those of the ecmwf ) or to reconstruct them using climate model output .
methods we downloaded high - frequency sea level data from the intergovernmental oceanographic commission ( ioc ) sea level station monitoring facility website at http :// www.ioc - sealevelmonitoring.org .
stations having at least a 12 - month long time series and containing less than 10 % data gaps were used in our analyses .
time series with predominantly bad records , as determined using visual inspection , are not considered .
the dataset passed into the analyses included 336 sea level time series sampled with 1 - min resolution .
selected time series passed a rigorous quality control , which included automatic despiking procedures and manual control for spikes , shifts , drifts , changes in tidal range and other changes .
data related to tsunami events listed in tsunami catalogues ( ngdc / wds global historical tsunami database ) were omitted from the analyses .
the series were then filtered with a 2 - h kaiser - bessel high - pass filter and grouped into coherent regions .
fifteen nslott events with the largest wave heights were extracted from selected stations and associated with atmospheric patterns taken from era - interim reanalysis data products at the nearest times .
era - interim reanalysis data products are available from the ecmwf ( european centre for middle - range weather forecast ) website at www.ecmwf.int and have a temporal resolution of 6 h. the mean sea level pressure , the temperature at the 850 - hpa level , the wind at the 500 - hpa level and the richardson number ri were used in the analysis , as these variables have been found important in meteotsunami studies1819202124 .
the richardson number is a measure of the stability of the atmospheric layer and is computed from the brunt - vaisala frequency n ( s - 2 ) , the wind speed u ( m / s ) and the height z ( m ) as ri = n2 /( du / dz ) 2 .
the mid - troposphere layer ( 400 - 700 hpa ) at a particular era - interim grid point was considered unstable if ri < 0.25 .
finally , zonally averaged global winds at the 500 - hpa level were computed from the whole era - interim dataset ( 1979 - 2015 ) .

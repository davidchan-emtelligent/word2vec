background squaliform sharks represent approximately 27 % of extant shark diversity , comprising more than 130 species with a predominantly deep - dwelling lifestyle .
many squaliform species are highly specialized , including some that are bioluminescent , a character that is reported exclusively from squaliform sharks within chondrichthyes .
the interfamiliar relationships within the order are still not satisfactorily resolved .
herein we estimate the phylogenetic interrelationships of a generic level sampling of " squaloid " sharks and closely related taxa using aligned sequences derived from a targeted gene capture approach .
the resulting phylogenetic estimate is further used to evaluate the age of first occurrence of bioluminescence in squaliformes .
results our dataset comprised 172 putative ortholog exon sequences .
phylogenetic estimates result in a fully resolved tree supporting a monophyletic lineage of squaliformes excluding echinorhinus .
non - luminous squalidae are inferred to be the sister to a clade comprising all remaining squaliform families .
our results suggest that the origin of photophores is coincident with an elevated diversification rate and the splitting of families dalatiidae , etmopteridae , oxynotidae and somniosidae at the transition of the lower to the upper cretaceous .
the presence of luminous organs was confirmed for the sleeper shark genus zameus .
these results indicate that bioluminescence in sharks is not restricted solely to the families etmopteridae and dalatiidae as previously believed .
conclusions the sister - clade to non - luminous squalidae comprises five families .
the presence of photophores is reported for extant members of three out of these five families based on results of this study , i.e. lantern sharks ( etmopteridae ) , kitefin sharks ( dalatiidae ) and sleeper sharks ( somniosidae ) .
our results suggest that the origin of luminous organs arose during the rapid diversification event that gave rise to the extant squaliform families .
these inferences are consistent with the idea of diversification of squaliform sharks being associated with the emergence of new deep - sea habitats in the lower cretaceous , which may have been facilitated by the evolution of bioluminescence .

issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background squaliform sharks constitute a group of highly specialized species with a predominantly deep - dwelling lifestyle .
they represent a substantial part of extant shark diversity (~ 27 % [ 1 ]) comprising 24 genera and more than 130 described species [ 2 ] .
many squaliform species are bioluminescent , a feature which appears to be exclusive within the chondrichthyes .
currently , the families echinorhinidae ( bramble - and prickly sharks ) , squalidae ( dogfish sharks ) , centrophoridae ( gulper sharks ) , somniosidae ( sleeper sharks ) , oxynotidae ( rough sharks ) , dalatiidae ( kitefin sharks ) , and etmopteridae ( lantern sharks ) are discussed to form the squaliformes .
however , some previous morphological studies have suggested alternative intergeneric and interfamilial arrangements for the group [ 2 - 12 ] .
the phylogenetic placement of echinorhinidae has remained ambiguous in both morphological and molecular studies , either being included within squaliformes , considered sister to squaliformes , or placed in a separate group with saw sharks ( pristiophoriformes ) or angel sharks ( squatiniformes ) .
further , recent molecular studies have recovered squalidae , centrophoridae , dalatiidae , and etmopteridae as monophyletic lineages within the squaliformes , however , their interfamiliar relationships remain partially unresolved while the family somniosidae appeared paraphyletic as oxynotidae cluster within somniosidae [ 2 , 3 , 8 - 24 ] .
all of the molecular data sets examined to date have been based on the analysis of a single or few genes and none have recovered substantial support for branching events at the family level , likely due to limited phylogenetic signal supporting deeper nodes .
phylogenetic analyses based on morphological characters have not yielded consistent results either , e.g. [ 9 , 10 ] .
a dataset with strong phylogenetic signal is prerequisite for analyses of the evolution of taxa through time .
so far , molecular clock analyses have delivered conflicting results concerning the origin and radiation ages of squaliform sharks in general and the rise of families in particular [ 23 , 24 ] .
molecular clocks are best calibrated using information from fossils or from vicariant biogeographic events .
squaliformes are well documented in the fossil record for sharks , which is largely comprised of teeth .
most squaliform sharks display diagnostic clade specific dentitions pointing to high levels of trophic specialization and conservatism .
a number of fossils can therefore be readily assigned to extant lineages such as the gulper shark genus centrophorus [ 25 ] or the viper dogfish trigonognathus [ 26 ] , without the need to erect distinct genera for extinct forms whose phylogenetic affinities are unclear .
according to [ 25 ] , the fossil record of squalidae extends back to the upper jurassic , while families centrophoridae , etmopteridae , somniosidae , oxynotidae , and dalatiidae appeared rather instantaneously at the beginning of the upper cretaceous , which has been suggested to be a period of adaptive evolution in response to new ecological opportunities [ 23 , 24 ] .
the oldest echinorhinid fossils are recorded from the lower cretaceous [ 25 , 27 ] the evolution of bioluminescence in kitefin ( dalatiidae ) and lantern sharks ( etmopteridae ) appears to be correlated with the diversification of squaliform sharks in the deep - sea [ 23 , 24 , 28 , 29 ] .
surprisingly , it has not been clear at which point in their evolutionary trajectory , squaliform sharks first acquired photophores .
despite the fact that shirai [ 8 ] had noted that all squaloid sharks except echinorhinus , centrophorus , cirrhigaleus , deania , somniosus , and squalus bear luminous organs , several recent studies suggested that photophores are only present in etmopteridae and dalatiidae [ 2 , 23 , 30 , 31 ] .
in this study , we estimate the phylogenetic interrelationships of squaliform sharks by applying a gene capture approach that targets a large number of single - copy nuclear exons [ 32 ] to a generic level sampling of " squaloid " sharks and closely related taxa [ 8 ] .
we have used these data in conjunction with fossil calibration data , to estimate times of divergence and diversification rates among the extant lineages examined .
we have also explored the potential role that bioluminescence may have had in promoting diversification in these animals , by reconstructing ancestral character states based on the inferred tree and the presence of photophores in extant forms .
results and discussion molecular phylogeny of squaliformes on average , 200,000 of 352,605 possible basepairs , were sequenced per specimen ( additional file 1 : table s1 ) .
characteristics of the raw dataset are given in additional file 1 : table s2 .
missing data were randomly distributed among specimens resulting in a large amount of incomplete sequences per captured locus and specimen .
mare [ 33 , 34 ] detected 174 phylogenetically informative loci in the raw dataset ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
re - blasting the full genome of c. milii against the 174 phylogenetically informative loci resulted in two potentially paraloguous loci ( cds 1200 ( unknown ) and cds 1366 ( lrp4 )) .
excluding these two loci and repeating the maximum likelihood analysis as described above did not affect the inferred tree topology .
phylogenetic estimates presented herein provide a fully resolved and well - supported molecular hypothesis for the phylogeny of squaliform sharks .
the maximum likelihood trees as well as the bayesian inferences resulting from different types of analyses carried out using raxml [ 35 ] and phylobayes 3.3f [ 36 , 37 ] were broadly congruent in topology except for the phylogenetic placement of oxynotus .
this taxon appears as sister taxon to all somniosid genera except for somniosus in an analysis of all 1265 loci , but is nested among somniosid genera except for somniosus in the analyses of the reduced dataset comprising 174 and 172 loci , respectively .
the topology used for further analysis is summarized in fig. 1 , and is based on the 172 concatenated nucleotide loci that were selected through the mare matrix reduction process and re - blasting analysis .
the concatenated and aligned 172 nucleotide loci are deposited in the dryad data repository [ 38 ] ( additional file 1 : tables s3 and s4 , figures s3 to s6 ). fig. 1 maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimate of squalomorph sharks based on gene capture data of 172 nucleotide loci under a gtr + gamma model using raxml [ 35 ] partitioned into two sets , 1st and 2nd codon position as well as 3rd codon only .
analyzed specimens are listed in additional file 1 : table s1 .
nodes marked with black dots indicate 100 % bootstrap support and a posterior probability of 1 assessed in the bayesian inference from the phylobayes 3 analysis applying the cat model [ 36 , 37 , 64 ] .
tree rooted midpoint , no outgroup defined .
this phylogenetic estimate reveals two major clades : the squaliformes excluding echinorhinidae and a clade containing squatina , pristiophoriformes , and echinorhinus ( fig. 1 ) .
within this clade , echinorhinus is sister to squatina and pristiophoriformes .
results suggest that echinorhinidae are not squaliform sharks , but are the sister group to angel - ( squatiniformes ) and saw sharks ( pristiophoriformes ) , as previously suggested by the analysis of mitochondrial data [ 21 ] .
therefore , squaliformes form a monophyletic group only , if echinorhinus is excluded .
this study does not support results from [ 24 ] , suggesting echinorhinus being the sistergroup to the remaining squaliform lineages .
the node time estimation for the echinorhinus lineage suggests an upper jurassic splitting of the extant echinorhinus lineage and the squatina plus pristiophoriformes clade .
this dates the echinorhinus lineage older than anticipated from the fossil record , which reports the oldest echinorhinid fossil from the early cretaceous ( hauterivian ) of southeastern france [ 27 ] , while the oldest squatinids already appear in the upper jurassic [ 25 ] .
within the squaliform clade , the first split separates squalidae from the remaining families centrophoridae , etmopteridae , dalatiidae , somniosidae , and oxynotidae .
the genera squalus and cirrhigaleus appear as sister taxa .
centrophoridae split from etmopteridae , dalatiidae , somniosidae , and oxynotidae , where genera deania and centrophorus are sister .
dalatiidae are sister to a clade comprising etmopteridae , somniosidae , and oxynotidae .
there are two clades within the dalatiids , one comprising the isistius and dalatias lineages , the other squaliolus and euprotomicrus .
as shown in fig. 1 , somniosidae sensu stricto form two clearly distinct lineages that are sister to each other , one containing the genus somniosus ( fig. 1 ) , the other lineage contains all other remaining somniosid genera .
oxynotidae cluster within somniosidae ( fig. 1 ) .
within etmopteridae , trigonognathus is sister to a clade comprising aculeola and centroscyllium .
etmopterus is sister to this previously described clade forming four distinct lineages representing the subclades described in [ 23 ] .
oxynotus is inferred to be nested within somniosidae , rendering the family somniosidae paraphyletic ( fig. 1 ) in the current study .
this result is repeatedly recovered in phylogenetic estimates based on dna sequence data ( both mitochondrial and nuclear ) [ 19 - 24 ] .
given the consistency of the inferences from molecular data , it would be interesting to see if any anatomical features also support the link between oxynotidae and somniosidae .
oxynotus clusters with a group of otherwise morphologically similar species of somniosids , i.e. along with zameus , centroselachus , scymnodon , and centroscymnus .
our molecular results show that all five genera are closely related ( fig. 1 ) .
this is especially evident when comparing intergeneric diversity within somniosidae with the large intrageneric sequence differences evident within the genus etmopterus ( fig. 1 ) .
moreover , there are limited morphological characters that can be used to differentiate some of these taxa [ 8 , 39 ] .
together these results imply that assigning separate generic status to some species within somniosidae may be an overrepresentation of the true diversity within the family .
occurrence and significance of bioluminescence in squaliform sharks the bayesian inference estimated with beast [ 40 , 41 ] is widely congruent with the maximum likelihood phylogeny ( fig. 1 , additional file 1 : figures s3 to s6 ) .
results from node time estimates based on 172 loci support a squaliform shark radiation beginning in the lower cretaceous and continuing through to the upper cretaceous ( table 1 ) .
a sister - group relationship of non - luminous squalidae with a clade comprising all other squaliformes is strongly supported as the most ancient split of extant squaliformes ( table 1 ) and is consistent with the fossil record [ 25 , 29 ] .
centrophoridae rise in the lower cretaceous , followed by the splitting of dalatiidae , somniosidae , oxynotidae and etmopteridae , which also aligns with the sequence of appearance of these taxa in the fossil record .
however , 95 % confidence intervals are large , preventing exact estimates ( table 1 ) .
a second radiation occurred within etmopteridae and somniosidae in the upper cretaceous and the beginning of the palaeocene ( table 1 ) , again , a time period characterized by profound changes in the marine environment including the deep - sea .
as discussed in [ 23 ] , the eocene recovery phase and the admixing of the deep - sea by the establishment of the circum - antarctic current at the beginning of the oligocene , may have set the stage for this second radiation .

results from the medusa [ 42 , 43 ] analysis indicate a background diversification rate r = 0.02 .
an elevated diversification rate was detected for families etmopteridae , dalatiidae , oxynotidae and somniosidae , ( r = 0.05 ) and the radiation of the species - rich genus squalus ( r = 0.15 , fig. 2 ). fig. 2 chronogram resulting from the beast [ 38 ] analysis with estimated shift in the diversification rate .
background rate r = 0.02 .
the black stars indicate significant increase in the diversification rate to r = 0.15 ( radiation squalidae ) and r = 0.05 ( etmopteridae , oxynotidae and somniosidae ) estimated with medusa [ 39 , 40 ] .

numbers at branches refer to node numbers given in table 1 .
pie charts indicate the probability that ancestral taxa are luminescent ( blue ) or not ( red ) .
families etmopteridae and dalatiidae were coded as luminous as well as the genus zameus within somniosidae .
* = node calibrated with information from the fossil record ( table 2 ) we reconstructed ancestral character states in order to test the hypothesis that bioluminescence evolved in conjunction with the diversification of the dalatiidae , etmopteridae , oxynotidae and somniosidae .
in the first analysis , we coded dalatiidae and etmopteridae as luminescent .
results from this analysis indicated that the common ancestor of families dalatiidae , etmopteridae , oxynotidae , and somniosidae was already likely carrying luminous organs .
interestingly , somniosidae have been widely accepted as non - luminous [ 2 , 23 , 30 , 31 , 44 ] .
however , shirai [ 8 ] suggested that all somniosidae are luminescent except for the genus somniosus , which may have secondarily lost the ability to produce light .
we reviewed the presence of photophores in somniosidae and oxynotidae , by inspecting the ventral surface area of several specimens housed in zoological collections .
the inspection of skin samples from zameus squamulosus revealed clear presence of epidermal photophores ( mean diameter = 41.75 +/ - 1.95 mum , density = 26 units mm - 2 , pap = 3.74 %) in this taxon ( fig. 3 ) .
the majority of these organs appeared to be ring - shaped and covered with translucent dermal denticles .
zameus photophores are visible as open dark circular plaques , typical of functional photophores that are capable of producing light .
indeed , this morphology is typically adopted by dalatiid and etmopterid photophores while glowing [ 44 - 48 ] ; the translucent nature of z. squamulosus scales would allow efficient transmission of underlying photophore light , similar to the observation of light transmission through the ventral scales of opisthoproctid fishes [ 49 ] or through the dorsal finspines of the velvet belly lanternshark , etmopterus spinax [ 50 ]. fig. 3 microscopic photograph of an excised ventral skin patch of zameus squamulosus ( zsm30966 ) .
arrows indicate photophores in open state .
scale bar indicates 200 mum morphological data presented herein provide clear evidence that functional photophores are present within somniosidae , at least within the genus zameus ( fig. 3 ) .
all other inspected specimens showed no evidence of epidermal photophores .
in light of this , the ancestral character state reconstruction was repeated incorporating results from the inspection of skin samples , i.e. coding the genus zameus in addition to etmopteridae and dalatiidae as luminescent .
results from this analysis further increased the likelihood that the common ancestor of dalatiidae , etmopteridae and somniosidae was luminescent ( fig. 2 ) .
the common ancestor of centrophoridae , etmopteridae , dalatiidae , oxynotidae , and somniosidae is also implied to have been luminescent , but the likelihood is less compelling .
a further analysis following [ 8 ] coding somniosid genera centroselachus , centroscymnus , scymnodon , and zameus as luminous further increases the likelihood so that the common ancestor of all squaliformes except squalidae may already have been luminescent ( additional file 1 : figure s8 ) .
this indicates that extant centrophoridae may have secondarily lost their ability to emit light , i.e. that luminous organs may have already been present at the branching event giving rise to families centrophoridae , dalatiidae , etmopteridae , somniosidae , and oxynotidae ( fig. 2 ) .
this suggests that luminescence evolved along and facilitated the squaliform deep - sea radiation - a scenario that would be consistent with the elevated diversification rate detected for etmopteridae , somniosidae , and oxynotidae .
( fig. 2 , additional file 1 : figures s8 and s9 ) .
we speculate that the common ancestor of families dalatiidae , etmopteridae , oxynotidae , and somniosidae was luminescent and used this to enhance camouflage by counterillumination as this is assumed to be the most basal function of shark bioluminescence [ 23 , 28 , 45 , 47 ] .
the occurrence of bioluminescence within the family somniosidae is not surprising as especially the smaller sized genera ( centroselachus , centroscymnus , scymnodon , and zameus ) occur in sympatry with other luminous sharks such as etmopterids and dalatiids as well as a number of other luminescent deep - sea taxa including myctophid fishes which interestingly were estimated to have radiated in a similar time window [ 51 ] .
results presented here lend further support to the hypothesis that bioluminescence in sharks evolved only once [ 29 , 47 ] .
work in progress will allow identifying all luminous taxa within the family somniosidae .
conclusions our findings provide insights into the phylogeny of squaliform sharks as well as the evolution of bioluminescence in the group .
the radiation is estimated to have started in the lower cretaceous and continued through to the upper cretaceous .
the initial elevated diversification rate is correlated with the likely first occurrence of luminous organs in sharks .
the presence of photophores was confirmed for the genus zameus in the family somniosidae , implying that bioluminescence in sharks is not restricted to families etmopteridae and dalatiidae as is widely believed .
methods targeted gene capturing to ensure correct sample ids of target samples , we either used genomic dna of specimens which were previously analyzed in [ 21 , 23 , 52 , 53 ] or generated nadh2 sequences as described in [ 22 ] and compared to the samples analysed in [ 21 , 52 , 53 ] .
in the latter case , genomic dna was extracted from collection material ( tissues in gjpn tissue collection ) already used in previous studies and stored in 95 % ethanol .
genomic dna was obtained using the promega wizard ( r ) dna purification system ( fisher scientific ) .
total amounts of dna were measured using a qbit ( r ) fluorometer ( life technologies ) .
subsequently , genomic dna of the 28 target samples was sheared to approximately 500 bp using a covaris ( r ) sonicator .
sheared samples were used to prepare illumina sequencing libraries following the protocol provided in [ 32 ] .
see additional file 1 : table s1 for an overview of samples analysed .
we designed custom rna bait libraries for targeting putatively single - copy orthologous genes based on sequences derived from seven shark species in [ 32 ] , i.e. chlamydoselachus anguineus , etmopterus joungi , isurus oxyrinchus , orectolobus halei , carcharhinus amblyrhynchos , heterodontus portusjacksoni , and squatina nebulosa .
each bait library comprised a pooled series of 120 bp baits designed for each target locus .
as in [ 32 ] , a 60 bp tiled overlap across baits was used to generate two - fold redundancy coverage for each target gene .
when the length of the target gene was less than 120 bp , the sequence was extended in length to 120 bp by adding thymine nucleotides .
the baits were manufactured by mycroarray ( r ) ( ann arbor , mi , usa ) .
thereafter , gene capture was conducted by hybridization of target dna to the baits .
after hybridization , unbound and non - target dna was washed away [ 32 ] .
the remaining library was enriched for target loci and was re - amplified to incorporate sample specific indices .
samples were pooled in equimolar ratios for sequencing .
the pooled product was quantified using the cfx connect real - time pcr system ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) .
pooled sample was diluted to 8 pm and used for paired - end 150 bp or 250 bp sequencing on an illumina miseq sequencing instrument ( illumina , inc , san diego , ca ) .
sequence reads associated with each sample were identified by their respective indices .
alignment reconstruction of gene capture data adapters were trimmed from sequence reads using trimgalore v0.3.7 .
[ 54 , 55 ] and assembled de novo using abyss ver1.3.5 .
[ 56 ] with a k - mer of 64 .
assembled contigs were assigned to core ortholog groups using hamstr [ 57 ] .
the core ortholog database consisted of profile hidden markov models of orthologous sequence groups from model vertebrates [ 32 ] .
any sequence that matched a core - ortholog phmm was provisionally assigned to the corresponding orthologous group .
in order to be retained in the final matrix , provisional sequence hits also had to satisfy a reciprocal best blast criterion when compared to callorhinchus milii as the reference taxon .
orthologous exons were trimmed from non - target intron information and aligned with mafft [ 58 , 59 ] .
finally , all loci were concatenated .
data analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction maximum likelihood ( ml ) trees were estimated using raxml gui [ 33 , 60 ] .
the initial ml analysis used the complete concatenated dataset ( i.e. 1265 loci and 28 taxa ) under gtr gamma using different partitioning schemes ( additional file 1 : table s4 ) using the automatic halt for bootstrapping [ 61 ] .
squalomorph sharks are widely accepted as monophyletic [ 8 , 19 - 22 ] .
within squalomorphs , hexanchiformes are considered to form the most basal lineage [ 8 , 20 - 22 ] , therefore , hexanchus griseus was chosen as the outgroup taxon .
subsequently , mare ver.1.2 [ 33 , 34 ] was used to examine the dataset for phylogenetically informative sites and taxa .
mare [ 33 , 34 ] was designed to identify the most phylogenetically informative subset of sites contained in phylogenomic data sets .
it is especially well - suited to analysis of data sets with a high proportion of missing data .
mare [ 33 , 34 ] identified 174 maximally informative loci for our data set reducing the maximal total sequence length per specimen from 352,605 bp to 73,925 bp ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
as a further scan for paraloguous sequences , we re - blasted the full genome of callorhinchus milii against the remaining 174 loci to check , if each sequence has only a single hit in the c. milii genome using customized perl scripts ( additional file 1 ) .
the reduced nuclear dataset comprising 172 concatenated nucleotide loci is deposited at [ 38 ] .
this data was analysed as described for the full dataset and additionally raxml gui [ 35 , 60 ] was applied to the amino acid alignment comprising infomative loci using the best partitioning scheme suggested by partitionfinder protein v1.1.1 [ 62 , 63 ] .
further , the reduced 172 loci dna sequence data alignment was analysed with partitionfinder v1.1.1 to look for best fitting partition schemes and models of molecular evolution [ 62 , 63 ] to determine if different partition types influence the tree topology .
we used the rcluster option with a rcluster percentage of 10 [ 63 ] for the analysis .
the bayesian mixture model cat [ 64 ] implemented in phylobayes 3.3f [ 36 , 37 ] was used on the concatenated 172 amino acid alignment to partition sites into different rate categories using non - parametric modeling of site specific effects .
this allowed us a topological comparison to the ml analysis under gtr gamma [ 65 ] .
four independent chains were run in parallel .
the tracefiles and treelists of all four chains were used to check for convergence . the analysis was stopped with a maximum difference of 0.16 and effective sample sizes exceeding 100 , with the exception of the allocent statistic ( see additional file 1 ) .
a majority rule consensus tree was computed from 12997 input trees from each chain with a burn - in of 1000 trees and analyzing every second tree of the pooled trees .
the consensus tree was rooted midpoint .
see additional file 1 : table s4 and figures s3 to s7 for a summary of partitioning schemes and phylogenetic analyses conducted .
to ensure that the choice of a single outgroup does not have a negative effect such as long branch attraction on our phylogenetic analysis , we performed analysis not defining an outgroup , defining different outgroups as well as deleting hexanchus griseus from the dataset and re - computing a phylogenetic estimate without defining an outgroup taxon ( additional file 1 : figure s2 ) .
node time estimation and diversification rate beast ver .
1.8.0 [ 40 , 41 ] was used to estimate node ages from the mare [ 33 , 34 ] reduced nucleotide alignment excluding cds 1200 and 1366 and partitioned into two partitions , the first comprising codon positions 1 and 2 , the second codon position 3 applying the gtr gamma model .
xml files were created in beauti [ 41 ] .
the analysis assumed a relaxed molecular clock approach under an uncorrelated lognormal model [ 40 ] .
the yule speciation process was implemented assuming a constant speciation rate per lineage as tree prior .
we calibrated our phylogenetic tree using calibration points deployed from the fossil record of squalomorph sharks ( table 2 ) .
the root age calibration should reflect the age of origin of squalomorph sharks .
the discussion of the age of squalomorphs is enduring and contingent on the discovery of new fossil information [ 25 ] .
here , we assumed the origin of squalomorphii , i.e. our root age , to have occurred between 190 and 279 ma based on distinct hexanchoid teeth from the lower jurassic as minimum age and the fossil appearance of protracodus , the oldest tooth fossils that carry morphological characters of euselachians as a soft upper bound .
we would like to point out that we consider this calibration as a minimum age calibration for the crown squalomorphii following [ 25 , 66 ] even though the chondrichthyan stem may be as old as , or even older than , the middle ordovician [ 67 ] .
table 2 calibration points used for node time estimates of squaloid sharks taxon set minimum age ( ma ) soft upper bound ( ma ) citation cp 1 root age ( squalomorphii ) 190 279 [ 71 ] cp 2 squaliformes 130 163 [ 25 ] cp 3 echinorhinidae , squatinidae & pristiophoridae 145 163 [ 25 ] cp 4 centrophoridae 89 100 [ 72 ] cp 5 dalatiidae 65 100 [ 25 ] cp 6 etmopteridae 65 100 [ 25 ] cp 7 trigonognathus , aculeola & centroscyllium 44.5 100 [ 26 ] the clade comprising echinorhinidae , pristiophoriformes pliotrema and pristiophorus as well as squatina was assumed to vary in age between 145 to 163 ma ( upper jurassic ) based on articulated fossils of squatinids at the lower and echinorhinus sp. teeth at the upper end of the time frame [ 25 , 27 ] .
the minimum age of squaliformes was calibrated to 130 ma based on the fossil taxon protosqualus with a soft upper bound at 163 ma allowing for the possibility that squaliform sharks were already present in the upper jurassic [ 25 ] .
squaliform family - level diversity is assumed to have originated in the late mesozoic ( upper cretaceous ) [ 23 ] , while most extant genera likely originated in the cenozoic .
fossil evidence was used to calibrate the minimum age of centrophoridae , etmopteridae and dalatiidae to be 65 ma ( c / t boundary ) with a soft upper bound of 100 ma ( beginning of the upper cretaceous ) .
further , the clade comprising trigonognathus , aculeola , and centroscyllium was assumed to be of minimum age of 45 ma and a lower bound of 100 ma based on the fossil record of trigonognathus virginiae [ 26 ] and the age estimate of extant etmopteridae in [ 24 ] .
all analyses assumed an exponential prior distribution for calibration points .
three independent runs were performed with a markov chain lasting 90 million generations each , sampling trees every 1000 generations .
one run included the maximum likelihood inferred tree with the highest likelihood as a newick formatted starting tree .
this beast input file is deposited in the dryad data repository [ 36 ] .
combined log files were analyzed in tracer v.1.6 [ 68 ] to check , if the effective sample sizes ( ess ) of parameters represent the posterior distribution adequately ; further trace and density plots were checked for convergence of the mcmc and posterior probability distributions in different runs .
after defining a burn - in of 25 % of all sampled trees in each run , treeannotator [ 40 ] was used to create a consensus tree which was visualized in figtree v.1.4.0 [ 69 ] .
we used the r [ 70 ] module medusa ( modeling evolutionary diversification using stepwise aic ) [ 43 ] implemented in the geiger package [ 42 ] to estimate changes in the diversification rate based on the consensus chronogram attained from the beast [ 41 ] analysis .
species richness values were obtained from [ 1 ] .
ancestral bioluminescence within squaliformes ancestral character states of bioluminescence were reconstructed using maximum likelihood estimates implemented in the r [ 70 ] package geiger [ 42 ] and are based on the chronogram attained from the beast [ 41 ] analyses .
in a first analysis , we coded only dalatiidae and etmopteridae as luminescent .
results from this analysis indicated that the common ancestor of families dalatiidae , etmopteridae , and somniosidae was already likely luminescent .
as an empirical test of this idea , we subsequently inspected the ventral surface area of somniosidae and oxynotidae specimens from the bavarian state collection of zoology - centroselachus crepidater ( zsm30842 ) , centroscymnus owstonii ( zsm36725 ) , oxynotus bruniensis ( zsm30862 ) , and zameus squamulosus ( zsm30966 ) - and the zoological museum hamburg - somniosus microcephalus ( zmh 123507 ) , s. rostratus ( zmh 25751 ) , centroscymnus coelolepis ( zmh 119748 ) , centroscymnus owstonii ( zmh 104894 ) , centroselachus crepidater ( zmh 103185 ) , scymnodalatias sp .
( zmh 122774 ) , zameus squamulosus ( zmh 120262 ; zmh 120485 ) .
when pigmentation was apparent , a 1 cm2 skin patch was excised from the ventral surface of the specimen and observed under a binocular microscope ( leica mz6 , wetzlar , germany ) .
if photophores were observed , a picture was taken and analysed in image j v .
1.46 using a random 1 x 1 mm counting frame to estimate photophore mean diameter , photophore density and proportion of the skin surface area occupied by photophores ( pap ) following the method of [ 28 ] .
thereafter , the ancestral character state reconstruction was repeated incorporating results from the inspected skin samples in a second analysis , and incorporating information on presence of luminous organs in somniosids following [ 8 ] in a third test .

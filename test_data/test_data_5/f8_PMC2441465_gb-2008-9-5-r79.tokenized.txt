a systematic analysis of cpg islands in ten mammalian genomes suggests that an increase in chromosome number elevates gc content and prevents loss of cpg islands .
background cpg islands , which are clusters of cpg dinucleotides in gc - rich regions , are considered gene markers and represent an important feature of mammalian genomes .
previous studies of cpg islands have largely been on specific loci or within one genome .
to date , there seems to be no comparative analysis of cpg islands and their density at the dna sequence level among mammalian genomes and of their correlations with other genome features .
results in this study , we performed a systematic analysis of cpg islands in ten mammalian genomes .
we found that both the number of cpg islands and their density vary greatly among genomes , though many of these genomes encode similar numbers of genes .
we observed significant correlations between cpg island density and genomic features such as number of chromosomes , chromosome size , and recombination rate .
we also observed a trend of higher cpg island density in telomeric regions .
furthermore , we evaluated the performance of three computational algorithms for cpg island identifications .
finally , we compared our observations in mammals to other non - mammal vertebrates .
conclusion our study revealed that cpg islands vary greatly among mammalian genomes .
some factors such as recombination rate and chromosome size might have influenced the evolution of cpg islands in the course of mammalian evolution .
our results suggest a scenario in which an increase in chromosome number increases the rate of recombination , which in turn elevates gc content to help prevent loss of cpg islands and maintain their density .
these findings should be useful for studying mammalian genomes , the role of cpg islands in gene function , and molecular evolution .
background cpg islands ( cgis ) are clusters of cpg dinucleotides in gc - rich regions and represent an important feature of mammalian genomes [ 1 ] .
mammalian genomic dna generally shows a great deficit of cpg dinucleotides , for example , the ratio of the observed over the expected cpgs ( obscpg / expcpg ) is approximately 0.20 - 0.25 in the human and mouse genomes [ 2 - 4 ] .
this deficit is largely attributed to the hypermutability of methylated cpgs to tpgs ( or cpas in the complementary strand ) [ 5,6 ] .
in comparison , cpgs in cgis are often unmethylated and their frequencies are close to random expectation ( for example , obscpg / expcpg = ~ 0.8 in the promoter - associated cgis [ 7 ]) .
cgis are often associated with the 5 ' end of genes and considered as gene markers [ 8,9 ] .
however , a comparison of the human , mouse , and rat genomes indicated that , although these three genomes encode similar numbers of genes , the number of cgis in the mouse ( 15,500 ) or rat ( 15,975 ) genome is far fewer than that ( 27,000 ) identified in the non - repetitive portions of the human genome [ 10 - 12 ] .
the difference is probably due to a faster rate of loss of cgis in the rodent lineage , rather than faster gains of cgis in the human lineage [ 7,9 ] .
however , it remains unclear whether the loss - of - cgi model holds for other mammalian genomes .
furthermore , to our best knowledge , there has been no comprehensive analysis of cgis and their density at the dna sequence level in mammals .
there are three major algorithms for identifying cgis in a genomic sequence .
the original algorithm was proposed by gardiner - garden and frommer [ 13 ] in 1987 ; the three parameters are gc content > 50 % , obscpg / expcpg > 0.60 , and length > 200 bp. this algorithm , often with some modifications , has been widely applied in the analysis of cgis in single genes , small sets of genomic sequences , or single genomes .
however , many repeats ( for example , alu ) , which are abundant in the vertebrate genome , also meet the criteria , so this algorithm has usually been used to scan cgis only in non - repeat portions of the genome [ 2,11,12 ] .
second , takai and jones [ 14 ] evaluated the three parameters in gardiner - garden and frommer 's algorithm using human gene data and suggested an optimal set of parameters ( gc content >= 55 % , obscpg / expcpg >= 0.65 , and length >= 500 bp ) .
this algorithm can effectively exclude false positive cgis from repeats and more likely identify cgis associate with the 5 ' end of human genes ; it seems to be suitable for other genomes too [ 14 ] .
third , more recently , hackenberg et al .
[ 15 ] developed a new algorithm , namely cpgcluster , that entirely depends on the statistical significance of a cpg cluster from random sequences in the same chromosome .
because cpgcluster does not require a minimum length ( for example , it identified cpg clusters as short as 8 bp ) [ 15 ] , it likely identifies many more cgis ( for example , 197,727 in the human genome ) than other algorithms .
in particular , cpgcluster may exaggerate the number of cgis ( that is , cpg clusters ) in low gc - content chromosomes , which often have low gene density , because its cpg clusters were identified relative to the background ( random ) cpg property .
another similar cpg cluster algorithm identifies cpg clusters by requiring a minimum number of cpgs in each sequence fragment [ 16 ] .
since loss of cgis is likely an evolutionary trend in at least some genomes [ 7,9,17 ] , cpgcluster may be able to identify those cgis that have undergone degradation and thus can not meet the criteria of takai and jones' or gardiner - garden and frommer 's algorithms .
our major aim is to survey extant cgis ( that is , cgis that meet the three typical criteria : length , gc content , and obscpg / expcpg ) and their distribution in today 's genomes , rather than to identify regions that might originally be cgis , even though they do not meet the three typical criteria .
a comparative study of the features of such cgis will be helpful for studying the evolution of cgis and sequence composition changes in the course of genome evolution .
recent genome sequencing projects have released a number of mammalian genomes with good quality annotations , but only few non - mammalian vertebrate genomes .
thus , in this study we focused on the analysis and comparison of cgis and their correlations with genomic features in mammalian genomes .
for our aim , it is appropriate to apply the same cgi detection algorithm to screen cgis in multiple genomes for comparison .
according to the introduction of the three algorithms above , we selected takai and jones' algorithm as a major algorithm in this study .
we conducted a systematic survey of cgis in ten sequenced mammalian genomes : eight completely sequenced eutherian genomes ( human ( homo sapiens ) , chimpanzee ( pan troglodytes ) , macaque ( macaca mulatta ) , mouse ( mus musculus ) , rat ( rattus norvegicus ) , dog ( canis familiaris ) , cow ( bos taurus ) , and horse ( equus caballus )) ; one completely sequenced metatherian genome ( opossum ( monodelphis domestica )) ; and one prototherian genome ( platypus ( ornithorhynchus anatinus )) whose sequence was completed with a 6x coverage , though it has not been completely assembled .
we also compared the observations from these mammals to seven other non - mammal vertebrates .
results cgis and cgi density in ten mammalian genomes we first present our analysis of cgis identified by takai and jones' algorithm [ 14 ] in ten mammalian genome sequences .
the conclusions are essentially the same when we used the popular algorithm by gardiner - garden and frommer [ 13 ] or the recently developed algorithm cpgcluster [ 15 ] ( see discussion ) .
the species names and the sources of genome sequences are shown in the materials and methods .
table 1 summarizes the genome information and statistics of cgis .
except for the platypus , these genomes had similar sizes ( 2.0 - 3.3 gb ) and similar numbers of annotated genes ( 20,000 - 30,000 ; additional data file 1 ) .
however , both the number of cgis and the cgi density ( measured by the average number of cgis per mb ) vary greatly among genomes .
the dog genome has the largest number of cgis ( 58,327 ) and the platypus genome has the highest cgi density ( 35.9 cgis / mb ) .
remarkably , the number of cgis in the dog genome is nearly three times that in the rat ( 19,568 ) or mouse ( 20,458 ) genome , even though the number of dog genes has been estimated to be smaller than those of human or mouse genes ( dog , 19,300 [ 18 ] ; human , 20,000 - 25,000 [ 19 ] ; mouse , approximately 30,000 [ 11 ]) .
the cgi density ( per mb ) ranges from 7.5 ( opossum ) to 35.9 ( platypus ) in the 10 genomes investigated .
these results suggest that , although genes are often associated with cgis , the extant cgis are distributed very differently among genomic regions ( for example , genes versus non - coding regions ) in mammalian genomes .

correlations between cgi density and other genomic features we examined the correlations between cgi density and other genomic features .
because of incomplete genome sequence and lack of some chromosome data in platypus , we present the correlation results only for the other nine genomes ; the conclusion will likely be the same when the platypus data become available ( additional data file 2 ) .
we found a highly significant positive correlation between cgi density and number of chromosome pairs in a genome ( r = 0.88 , p = 7.9 x 10 - 4 ; figure 1a ) and a significant correlation between cgi density and number of chromosome arms ( r = 0.62 , p = 0.037 ) .
as expected , there was a significant positive correlation between cgi density and obscpg / expcpg ( r = 0.63 , p = 0.035 ) .
no significant correlation was found between cgi density and genome size ( r = - 0.53 , p = 0.073 ) or genome gc content ( r = 0.24 , p = 0.27 ) .

( b ) cgi density ( per mb ) versus log10 ( chromosome size ) .
the y chromosomes were excluded because of insufficient data .
( c ) cgi density ( per mb ) versus chromosome gc content (%) .
( d ) cgi density ( per mb ) versus chromosome obscpg / expcpg .
there were a total of 219 chromosomes available in these 9 genomes after excluding the y chromosomes .
we found a highly significant negative correlation between cgi density and log10 ( chromosome size ) ( r = - 0.51 , p = 2.6 x 10 - 16 ; figure 1b ) , a highly significant positive correlation between cgi density and gc content of the chromosome ( r = 0.65 , p = 3.5 x 10 - 28 ; figure 1c ) , and a highly significant positive correlation between cgi density and obscpg / expcpg ( r = 0.75 , p = 2.8 x 10 - 41 ; figure 1d ) .
we further separated the chromosomes into different groups by their sizes (< 25 , 25 - 50 , 50 - 75 , 75 - 100 , 100 - 150 , 150 - 200 , and > 200 mb ) .
interestingly , as the average size of a chromosome group increases , the cgi density decreases ( table 2 ) .
indeed , the cgi density in small mammalian chromosomes ( size < 25 mb ) is , on average , about three times that in large chromosomes ( size > 200 mb ) .
we noted that the platypus ( 2n = 52 ) , which has six pairs of large chromosomes but many small chromosomes [ 20 ] , has a much higher cgi density than the other nine mammalian genomes ( table 1 ) .
these results are consistent with the previous observation that cgis are highly concentrated on the microchromosomes in chickens [ 21 ] .

the dog has overall smaller chromosomes and high cgi density , while the opossum has a few large chromosomes and low cgi density .
to check whether our correlation analysis was largely driven by these two species , we performed a similar analysis but excluded the dog and opossum data .
the same conclusion still held .
for example , we found a significant correlation between cgi density and number of chromosome pairs ( r = 0.75 , p = 0.026 ) and a significant correlation between cgi density and log10 ( chromosome size ) ( r = - 0.49 , p = 5.9 x 10 - 12 ) .
cgis are considered gene markers , so they are expected to highly correlate with gene density [ 2,22 ] .
it is interesting to investigate whether the above correlation results still hold when gene information is excluded .
we identified cgis in the intergenic regions of nine mammalian genomes and found significant correlations between intergenic cgi density and log10 ( chromosome size ) ( r = - 0.55 , p = 7.3 x 10 - 19 ) , gc content of the chromosome ( r = 0.39 , p = 8.6 x 10 - 10 ) , and obscpg / expcpg ( r = 0.67 , p = 3.7 x 10 - 30 ) .
details are shown in additional data file 3 .
it is also interesting to examine whether the correlations between cgi density and other genomic factors would hold in different genomic regions .
we used human data because of their high quality annotations .
according to gene annotations in the ncbi database , we identified 24,228 cgis overlapped or within genes ( gene - associated cgis ) , 13,026 cgis whose whole sequences were within intergenic regions ( intergenic cgis ) , 12,136 cgis whose whole sequences were within gene regions ( intragenic cgis ) , and 11,192 cgis overlapped with transcriptional start sites ( tss cgis ) in the human genome .

cgi density and recombination rate recombination rate correlates with both the number of chromosomes and the number of chromosome arms , and elevates the gc content , probably via biased gene conversion [ 23,24 ] .
fine - scale recombination rates vary extensively among populations [ 25,26 ] , genomic regions [ 27 ] , or the homologous regions between two closely related organisms ( human and chimpanzee ) [ 28,29 ] , suggesting a rapid evolution of local pattern of recombination rates .
many genomic features , including cpg dinucleotide frequencies ( but not cgis or cgi density ) in genomic sequences , have been employed to analyze the pattern of recombination rate .
here we examined specifically the relationship between cgi density and recombination rate at the genome level .
we retrieved human recombination rate data ( window size , 1 mb , 2,772 windows ) from the ucsc genome browser [ 30 ] .
we found a significant positive correlation between cgi density and recombination rate ( r = 0.18 , p = 1.1 x 10 - 22 ) .
we obtained another set of recombination rate data ( in 5 mb and 10 mb windows ) for the human , mouse and rat from jensen - seaman et al .
[ 31 ] .
we discarded those regions that had more than 50 % ' n 's (' n ' denotes an uncertain nucleotide in the sequence ) or whose recombination rate was 0 .
in the latter case , it was likely due to insufficient available genetic markers or a small number of meioses used to construct the genetic maps [ 31 ] .
again , we found a significant correlation between cgi density and recombination rate , regardless of window size ( 5 mb or 10 mb ; table 5 and additional data file 4 ) .
for example , the correlation coefficient was 0.33 ( p = 5.9 x 10 - 16 ) for human recombination rates measured in a 5 mb window ( figure 2 ) .
the correlation became stronger as the window size increased .
furthermore , the extent of the correlation was different among the three genomes .
for example , the coefficients were 0.33 ( human ) , 0.24 ( mouse ) , and 0.17 ( rat ) , respectively , when the 5 mb window was used .

human recombination rate data measured with a 1 mb window were based on the decode genetic map and downloaded from the ucsc genome browser [ 30 ] .
recombination rate data measured with 5 mb and 10 mb windows were prepared by jensen - seaman et al .
[ 31 ] and downloaded from the associated supplementary material website .
figure 2 correlation between cgi density and recombination rate ( cm / mb ) in the human genome ; a 5 mb window was used .
recombination rates were found to increase from the centromeric towards telomeric regions [ 31 ] .
interestingly , we observed a trend of higher cgi density in the telomeric regions ( figure 3 ) in many chromosomes .
this feature supports a positive correlation between cgi density and recombination rate .
however , this finding is opposite to a previous observation of no correlation between cgi features and chromosomal telomere position based on a small gene dataset [ 17 ] .
figure 3 distribution of cgi density ( per mb ) on human chromosome 8 .
the data indicate a trend of higher cgi density in telomeric regions .
comparison of cgis in non - mammalian vertebrate genomes to retrieve information on the cgis in vertebrate genomes , we scanned cgis in seven non - mammalian vertebrate genomes , including the chicken , lizard and five fish ( tetraodon , medaka , zebrafish , stickleback and fugu ) genomes .
except for lizard and fugu , all these genomes had assembled chromosomes .
table 6 shows the cgis and other genome information for the seven non - mammalian vertebrates .
the cgi density had a much wider range ( 14.7 - 161.6 per mb ) among these genomes .
the cgi densities in the chicken ( 23.0 per mb ) and green anole lizard ( 25.9 per mb ) were similar to that in the dog ( 25.3 per mb ) , higher than that in the other eight therians , but lower than that ( 35.9 per mb ) in the platypus ( prototherian ) ( table 1 ) .
it is worth noting that both the chicken and platypus have many small chromosomes .
the chicken karyotype consists of 39 chromosomes , of which 33 are classified as microchromosomes [ 32 ] .
at the dna sequence level , chicken chromosomes were separated into three groups ( large macrochromosomes , intermediate chromosomes and microchromosomes ) by the international chicken genome sequencing consortium [ 33 ] .
using this classification , we found that cgi density in the 20 chicken microchromosomes ( 51.7 per mb ) was much higher than that ( 15.0 per mb ) in the 6 large macrochromosomes ( table 6 ) , consistent with an earlier report [ 21 ] .
we did not estimate the cgi density in the large or small chromosomes of platypus because the available assembled genome sequences ( 410 mb ) represent only a small portion of the genome , which is expected to be about the same size as the human genome [ 20 ] .

+ only 30 chromosomes were used in the analysis because chromosomes 29 - 31 and 33 - 38 were too small to assemble [ 39 ] .
the microchromosomes included chromosomes gga11 - 28 , 32 and w and the macrochromosomes included chromosomes gga1 - 5 and z. cgi densities in the five fish genomes varied to a much greater extent than in the mammalian genomes .
the cgi densities in tetraodon ( 161.6 per mb ) and stickleback ( 157.8 per mb ) were about 11 times that in zebrafish ( 14.7 per mb ) .
the obscpg / expcpg ratios in the fish genomes ( 0.479 - 0.662 ) were also much higher than those ( 0.129 - 0.296 ) in the mammalian , the chicken ( 0.248 ) and the lizard ( 0.296 ) genomes .
fishes are cold - blooded vertebrates and lack gc - rich isochores [ 34 ] .
an early study found certain fish did not have elevated gc content in nonmethylated cgis [ 35 ] , so our comparison of cgis in fishes should be taken with caution .
in contrast to the observation in mammalian genomes , the correlation between cgi density and number of chromosome pairs in the seven non - mammals was not significant ( r = - 0.42 , p = 0.17 ) .
we further examined cgi density at the chromosome level in the five non - mammalian genomes ( chicken , tetraodon , stickleback , medaka and zebrafish ) , whose assembled chromosomes are available , and compared it to the nine mammalian genomes .
to distinguish the features of cgis among different genomes , we separated them into different groups : primates ( human , chimpanzee and macaque ) , rodents ( mouse and rat ) , dog - horse - cow , opossum , chicken and fish ( tetraodon , stickleback , medaka and zebrafish ) .
figure 4 shows the plots of cgi density over chromosome gc content .
although there is an overall trend of increasing cgi density with chromosome gc content in both the mammals and non - mammals , their distributions of cgi densities over the chromosome gc content are different .
in mammals , cgi density is high in dog - horse - cow and low in rodents , but extensive overlaps are seen among different groups , especially between primates and other groups ( figure 4a ) .
this pattern is more evident in the plots of cgi density versus log10 ( chromosome size ) or versus chromosome obscpg / expcpg ratios ( additional data file 5 ) .
interestingly , we found an overall distinct distribution pattern among non - mammal genomes , especially among the fish genomes ( figure 4b ) .
the chromosomes from each fish genome clustered but they were separated from other fish genomes ( figure 4b , additional data file 5 ) .
finally , when all species were plotted together , there were overlaps between mammals and non - mammals , but overall , fish chromosomes and chicken microchromosomes could be separated from the mammalian chromosomes ( figure 4b , additional data file 5 ) .

discussion influence of cgi identification algorithms there are three major algorithms for identifying cgis in a genomic sequence ( reviewed in the background ) .
the major aim in this study is to investigate and compare the cgis in today 's mammalian genomes , rather than to identify cgis in the mammalian ancestral sequences .
thus , our analysis may provide insights into how cgis have evolved and their association with gene function and other genomic factors .
since cgis have been widely documented to be approximately 1 kb long [ 2,6 ] , takai and jones' stringent criteria seem to be the most appropriate for our analysis .
to assure the reliability of our analysis , we performed similar analysis using gardiner - garden and frommer 's algorithm ( only on the non - repeat portions of the genomes ) and cpgcluster with the ten mammalian genomes and seven other vertebrate genomes under study .
the conclusions were the same ; see detailed results in table 4 and additional data files 6 and 7 .
for example , there was a significant positive correlation between cgi density and chromosome number , using gardiner - garden and frommer 's algorithm ( r = 0.92 , p = 2.0 x 10 - 4 ; additional data file 6 ) or cpgcluster ( r = 0.81 , p = 0.004 ; additional data file 7 ) .
however , we found that the number of cgis identified by cpgcluster or gardiner - garden and frommer 's algorithm was remarkably larger than that identified by takai and jones' algorithm ( additional data file 8 ) ; for example , the numbers of cgis identified in the human genome was 37,531 ( takai and jones ) , 76,678 ( gardiner - garden and frommer ) , and 197,727 ( cpgcluster ) .
the number of genes was estimated to be approximately in the range 20,000 - 30,000 in mammalian genomes ( additional data file 1 ) .
since cgis have been widely considered as gene markers , both the gardiner - garden and frommer algorithm and cpgcluster likely identified either many cgis that are not associated with genes or multiple cgis that share one gene .
to address the latter case , we evaluated the length distribution of cgis identified by the three algorithms .
among all these vertebrate genomes , the majority of cgis identified by cpgcluster were shorter than 500 bp ( additional data file 8 ) , which is the minimum length in takai and jones' algorithm .
for example , the proportions of human cgis identified by cpgcluster were 44.3 % (< 200 bp ) , 45.9 % ( 200 - 500 bp ) , 7.3 % ( 500 - 1,000 bp ) , 1.9 % ( 1,000 - 1,500 bp ) , 0.4 % ( 1,500 - 2,000 bp ) , and 0.2 % (>= 2,000 bp ) .
for gardiner - garden and frommer 's algorithm , the proportion of cgis shorter than 500 bp was also large , for example , 65.8 % in the human cgis and 64.8 % in the opossum cgis ( additional data file 8 ) .
based on the evaluation above , we consider that our analysis using takai and jones' algorithm is the most reliable and appropriate , though further evaluation of species - specific algorithms may enhance our results .
evolution of cgis it was hypothesized that cgis arose once at the dawn of vertebrate evolution and vertebrate ancestral genes were embedded in entirely non - methylated dna during the divergence of vertebrates [ 9 ] .
genome - wide methylation has been found to be common in vertebrates ( except for promoter - associated cgis ) and fractional methylation common in invertebrates .
the transition from fractional to global methylation likely occurred around the origin of vertebrates [ 36 ] .
many cgis might have lost their typical features due to de novo methylation at their cpg sites and subsequent high deamination rates at the newly methylated cpg sites , leading to tpg and cpa dinucleotides .
excess of tpgs and cpas as well as other vanishing cgi features ( decreasing length , obscpg / expcpg ratio and gc content ) has been found in the homologous gene regions , evidence of frequent cgi losses in mouse and human genes and a faster loss rate in mice [ 7,9,17 ] .
recent methylation studies revealed weak cgis in promoter regions ( promoters with intermediate cpg content , icps ) , most of which were not found in the cgi library , had a faster loss rate of cpgs than stronger cgis ( promoters with high cpg content , hcps ) , suggesting that strong cgis might be protected from methylation and are thus better conserved during evolution [ 22,37,38 ] .
using the data in weber et al .
[ 37 ] and mikkelsen et al .
[ 38 ] , we found that hcp density has stronger correlations with genomic features than icps in both the human and mouse genomes .
the cgis identified by the takai - jones algorithm are different from hcps or icps .
however , when we separated the promoter - associated cgis identified by the takai - jones algorithm into hcgis ( those that satisfied the hcp criteria ) and non - hcgis , we also found that hcgis had stronger correlations with genomic features than non - hcgis .
this supports the observations from the methylation studies mentioned above .
although loss of cgis is likely a major evolutionary scenario in mammals , little comparative analysis at the dna sequence level has been performed yet , because cgis have been thought to be poorly conserved between species [ 7,9 ] .
our cgi analysis indicated that rodents have the lowest cgi density and most other eutherians have moderate cgi density when compared to platypus ( table 1 ) .
platypus is one of the only three extant monotremes and has a fascinating mixture of features typical of mammals and of reptiles and birds .
monotremes ( mammalian subclass prototheria ) are the oldest branch of the mammalian tree , diverging 210 million years ago from the therian mammals [ 20 ] .
although the platypus genome is incomplete , its higher cgi density is likely true because high frequencies of gc and cg dinucleotides and high gc content have been reported [ 20 ] .
further , our analysis of the chicken ( bird ) and green anole lizard genomic sequences , the only reptilian genome available at present , showed higher cgi density than most of the therians ( except dogs ) we examined .
these data support an overall decrease in cgis in mammalian genomes .
below we discuss specific cgi features of a few species .
the low number of cgis in the rodent genome is likely due to a much higher rate of cgi loss and a weaker selective constraint in the rodent lineage [ 7,17 ] .
interestingly , the dog has a notably large number of cgis and high cgi density among the nine therians investigated .
our further analysis revealed that the difference is due to the substantial enrichment of cgis in dog 's intergenic and intronic regions , while the number of cgis associated with the 5 ' end of genes is similar to the human and the mouse ( data not shown ). whether and how cgis have accumulated in dog requires further investigation .
it is also worth noting that opossum , which belongs to metatheria , is another evolutionarily ancient lineage of mammals .
the cgi density is very low ( 7.5 per mb ) .
this is likely attributed to its large chromosomes ( table 1 ) , as large chromosomes are correlated with low cgi density ( figure 1 ) .
large chromosomes reduce recombination rate , which has a positive correlation with cgi density ( figure 2 ) .
other possible factors that might influence cgi density it is interesting to examine whether species traits such as lifespan , body temperature and body mass are related to cgi density .
the small body size and short lifespan of mice were speculated to allow for their tolerance towards leaky control of gene activity , including erosion of cgis [ 17 ] .
a previous study also revealed that methylation status is correlated with body temperatures in fish and affected by the local environment [ 39 ] .
it was also proposed that gc content of the isochores is driven by increasing body temperature , which has selective advantages because of being more thermally stable in higher gc - content regions [ 40 ] .
our correlation analysis found a significant correlation between cgi density and body temperature in eight eutherians ( r = 0.67 , p = 0.035 ) and nine therians ( r = 0.63 , p = 0.034 ; figure 5a ) .
however , when platypus and / or chicken were added , the correlation became insignificant .
furthermore , we did not find a significant correlation between cgi density and lifespan in the eight eutherians ( r = 0.14 , p = 0.38 ) or nine therians ( r = 0.26 , p = 0.25 ; figure 5b ) .
some factors might have affected the estimation of lifespan , making the analysis unreliable .
first , living environments are much different between domesticated and wild animals ; meanwhile , modern medical treatment has increased human longevity .
second , lifespan in the same species may differ according to factors such as sex [ 41 ] and hormonal regulation [ 42,43 ] .
third , the divergence among mammals is low when compared to other vertebrates .
in summary , our analysis of these species traits should be considered preliminary .

( b ) insignificant correlation between cgi density and lifespan .
conclusion this study represents a systematic comparative genomic analysis of cgis and cgi density at the dna sequence level in mammals .
it reveals significant correlations between cgi density and genomic features such as number of chromosome pairs , chromosome size , and recombination rate .
our results suggest a genome evolution scenario in which an increase in chromosome number increases the rate of recombination , which in turn elevates gc content to help prevent loss of cgis and maintain cgi density .
we compared cgi features in other non - mammalian vertebrates and discussed other factors such as body temperature and lifespan that have previously been speculated to influence sequence composition evolution .
materials and methods genome sequences and genome information we downloaded the assembled genome sequences ( ten mammalian genomes and seven non - mammalian vertebrate genomes ) from the national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) [ 44 ] and the ucsc genome browser [ 30 ] .
the species names and data sources are provided in table 7 .
the repeat - masked sequences of these genomes were downloaded from the ucsc genome browser [ 30 ] .
we used the emboss package [ 45 ] to calculate the genome size , the gc content and the obscpg / expcpg ratios .
gene numbers were based on the annotations in ensembl [ 46 ] and also in the literature ( details are shown in additional data file 1 ) .
at present , it remains a great challenge to obtain an accurate estimation of the gene number in a genome , but we suspect that the actual gene numbers in these genomes are likely in a smaller range than the range 20,000 - 30,000 in additional data file 1 .

++ no assembled chromosomes .
identification of cpg islands we used three algorithms to identify cgis .
first , we used the stringent search criteria in the takai and jones algorithm [ 14 ] : gc content >= 55 % , obscpg / expcpg >= 0.65 , and length >= 500 bp. second , we used the algorithm originally developed by gardiner - garden and frommer [ 13 ] : gc content > 50 % , obscpg / expcpg > 0.60 , and length > 200 bp. because some repeats ( for example , alu ) meet these criteria , we scanned cgis in the non - repeat portions of these genomes only , as similarly done in other genome - wide identification studies [ 2,11 ] .
for both the takai and jones and the gardiner - garden and frommer algorithms , we used the cpg island searcher program ( cpgi130 ) available at [ 47 ] .
third , we used cpgcluster developed by hackenberg et al .
[ 15 ] to scan cgis in the whole genome .
we used the method of jiang and zhao [ 48 ] to identify cgis in different genomic regions ( genes , intergenic regions , intragenic regions , and tss regions ) .
briefly , we compared the locations of cgis with the coordinates of genic , intergenic , and intragenic regions and tsss based on the human gene annotation information from the ncbi database ( build 35.1 ) [ 44,49 ] .
cgis overlapped with any genes were classified as gene - associated cgis ; cgis whose whole sequences were in intergenic regions were classified as intergenic cgis ; cgis whose sequences were in gene regions were classified as intragenic cgis ; and cgis overlapped with tsss were classified as tss cgis .
recombination rate and cgi density we retrieved human recombination rate data based on the decode genetic map [ 50 ] from the ucsc genome browser [ 30 ] .
the recombination rates were measured in 1 mb windows .
we obtained another set of recombination rates from jensen - seaman et al .
[ 31 ] .
these data were measured in 5 mb and 10 mb windows for the human , mouse and rat and are available in the supplementary material for jensen - seaman et al .
[ 31 ] .
for both datasets , we discarded those regions having more than 50 % ' n 's [ 31 ] .
we also discarded those regions whose recombination rates were 0 because of too few genetic markers found in these regions [ 31 ] .
body temperature and lifespan in mammals records of body temperature in a species may vary to some extent in the literature because they might be measured in different environments ( for example , time of day , season , or geographical location ) or different sites of the body .
the body temperatures of ten mammals in this study were obtained from the literature ( details are shown in additional data file 9 ) .
when a species has a range of body temperatures in the literature , the average was used as the representative temperature .
there are several measurements of lifespan , such as maximum lifespan , average lifespan , and lifespan of each sex .
we used maximum lifespan , which was based on reports in the literature and from the anage database [ 51 ] ( additional data file 9 ) .

sumo is conserved among eukaryotes and is essential for the regulation of processes such as dna damage repair , transcription , dna replication and mitosis .
ubl modification of proteins occurs via a specific enzymatic cascade formed by the crosstalk between the e1 - activating enzyme , the e2 - conjugating enzyme and the e3 - ligase .
an essential discrimination step in all ubl modifiers corresponds to the interaction between e1 and e2 enzymes , which is mediated by the recruitment of the e2 to the ufd domain ( ubiquitin - fold domain ) of the e1 enzyme .
to gain insights in the properties of this interface , we have compared the structures of the complexes between e1 ufd domain and e2 in human and yeast , revealing two alternative ufd platforms that interact with a conserved e2 .
comparative sequence analysis of the e1 ufd domain indicates that the e2 binding region has been conserved across phylogenetic closely related species , in which higher sequence conservation can be found in the e2 binding region than in the entire ufd domain .
these distinctive strategies for e1 - e2 interactions through the ufd domain might be the consequence of a high selective pressure to ensure specificity of each modifier conjugation system .
the post - translational modification pathway of proteins by ubls ( ubiquitin - like modifiers ) is characterized by the presence of specific enzymatic cascades ( e1 , e2 and e3 enzymes ) , which results in the formation of an isopeptidic bond between the ubl and the protein target12 .
a major characteristic of this process is the specificity provided between all components of the ubl pathway , resulting in the formation of protein - protein complementary interfaces34 .
sumo ( small ubiquitin - like modifier ) is a ubl modifier that can alter the function of a myriad of target proteins inside the cell5 , being involved in processes such as dna damage repair , transcription , dna replication and mitosis167 .
the first specificity step in the pathway corresponds to the interaction of the ubl modifier with its particular e1 - activating enzyme89 .
in the sumo pathway , the e1 - activating enzyme is a large multidomain heterodimer ( sae1 - uba2 ) 10 that initiates the process by adenylation of the sumo c - terminus and the subsequently formation of a thioester bond with the active - site cysteine residue of e111 .
next , the activated ubl - thioester is transferred to the active - site cysteine residue of the e2 - conjugating enzyme ( ubc9 in sumo ) , which represents a second specificity step in the pathway by the formation of the e1 - e2 complex .
crystal structures of several e1 - activating enzymes12131415 revealed the presence of a domain displaying an ubiquitin - like fold ( ufd domain ) in the e1 - activating enzyme large subunit .
the e1 ufd domain plays a major role in the binding of the e2 enzyme , providing specific contacts between e1 and e2 enzymes .
this interaction was first observed in the crystal structure of the nedd8 e1 in complex with e213 , showing the direct binding of e2 to the e1 ufd domain .
recently , the crystal structure of the thio - ester transfer intermediate of ubiquitin e1 - e2 complex15 revealed a dual binding of e2 to the ufd domain and to the catalytic e1 cys - domain , which occurs after an significant rotation of the ufd domain , providing the structural basis for the isoenergetic thio - ester transfer between the e1 and the e2 enzymes15 .
this interaction between e2 and the cys domain of the e1 was proposed previously in the sumo pathway by nmr analyses , although e1 ufd - e2 interactions display higher affinity ( kd = 1.2 mum ) 16 than e1 cys - e2 interactions ( kd = 87 mum ) 17 , supporting a major role of the e1 ufd domain in e2 recruitment .
protein sequence variations in the e1 ufd domain of different ubl modifiers are quite significant , especially in the binding region to the e2 enzyme .
all reported structures of ufd domains display an analogous beta - grasp structure , and the interaction of the ufd domain with the e2 - enzyme occurs through the same side of the beta - sheet structure131415181920 .
however , in all reported complex structures superposition of the e2 enzymes reveal distinct orientations of the ufd domain , which is a direct consequence of different contacts in each ubl system1518 .
conservation analysis according to sequence alignments showed that yeast and human sumo ufd domains display little sequence homology ( 17 % sequence identity ) , and it is even lower considering only the binding region to ubc9 .
notwithstanding this low conservation , both proteins can efficiently interact with a highly conserved surface in their cognate ubc9 .
in this scenario , the identification of the molecular determinants that mediate e1 ufd and e2 interactions in evolutionary distant organisms cannot rely on sequence homology analysis .
instead , the elucidation of these molecular determinants requires specific structural studies of the interaction .
here we present a detailed structural comparison analysis of the two complexes between sumo e1 ufd domain and ubc9 from yeast21 and human .
we also present a novel structure of the human complex solved in a different space group than the recently deposited22 .
our results indicate that human and yeast ufd domains interact with a conserved surface of ubc9 , in each case by maintaining the same chemical character of the interface contacts despite the lack of sequence homology .
sequence alignment of these two e2 binding region discloses unique consensus motifs that have been maintained across species from the same kingdom ( in metazoa ) or in the same order ( in saccharomycetales ) .
phylogenetic and homology analysis revealed that the region involved in ubc9 binding displays a slightly higher conservation degree than the ufd domain between phylogenetically closely related organisms , although it also displays higher variability , highlighting the relevance of this interface in the protein - protein specificity for each type of ubl modification .
results complex between human sumo e1 ufd domain and sumo e2 the interaction between the ubiquitin - fold domain ( ufd ) of the e1 - activating enzyme and the e2 - conjugating enzyme has been revealed as a crucial discrimination step in the conjugation pathway of ubl modifiers14182324 .
the interface between e1 and e2 enzymes is unique and is required to confer specificity between cognate enzymes of each ubl conjugation pathway .
notably , differences in the interface are more significant in the ufd domain than in the e2 - conjugating enzyme , which is a highly conserved enzyme .
within the same ubl family , evolutionary distant species display a low degree of sequence conservation between e1 ufd domains .
in sumo pathway , yeast and human ufd domains were shown to display only a 17 % sequence identity25 .
to get structural insights for the different interaction between yeast and human , we have determined the crystal structure of the complex between human e1 uba2 ufd domain and human e2 ubc9 at 2.2 a resolution and compared this structure to the analogous complex in yeast ( pdb code 3ong ) 25 .
during the preparation of the manuscript , another structure of the human e1 ufd - ubc9 was also published in a different crystallographic space group , supporting our results22 ( pdb id 4w5v ) .
human e1 ubiquitin - fold domain ( ufd ) was designed based on the structure of the full - length human sae1 - sae2 e1 - activating enzyme ( pdb code 1y8q ) 24 .
we alternatively prepared a ufd construct including the c - terminal flexible extension , however this longer ufd was unstable and displayed proteolysis after complex formation with ubc9 .
both native gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography indicated the formation of the complex between human e1 ufd domain and ubc9 ( see supplementary fig. s1 ) .
after initial unfruitful crystallization trials with the purified complex , a lysine methylation protocol was conducted to induce crystallization .
suitable crystals diffracted beyond 2.2 a resolution , contained one complex of ufd / ubc9 per asymmetric unit and belonged to the tetragonal space group system ( table 1 ) , which is different to the monoclinic crystals recently deposited22 ( pdb code 4w5v ) .
an overall structural comparison of free and bound ubc9 structures displayed little variation ( 0.71 a rmsd calpha deviation ) , although differences were observed in the binding region to ufd , displaying rmsd calpha deviations between 1.50 a and 3.66 a in the residues forming the beta1 - beta2 loop ( lys30 to met36 ) .
similarly , free and bound e1 ufd structures are almost identical ( overall 0.72 a rmsd deviation ) .
according to the pisa server26 the human complex buries a surface of 1493 a2 and involves 26 and 19 residues of ufd and ubc9 , respectively , which is comparable to the analogous complex in yeast ( 1557 a2 interface ) 25 .
yeast and human interface comparison in contrast to the conservation proposed according to sequence homology between human and yeast ufd , 17 % of identity , this homology is even lower , 11 % , when a structural alignment is performed ( fig. 1a ) .
interestingly , differences between yeast and human are increased , 7 % of sequence identity , when comparing only the residues forming the interface of the e1 ufd domain with ubc9 , which are basically formed by a different set of residues capable to interact with a conserved ubc9 surface ( fig. 1b ) .
however , despite this low sequence homology between yeast and human ufd , the interaction occurs through the same surface2225 , forming an interdigitated complex between the alpha1 helix and the beta1 - beta2 loop of ubc9 that sits on the beta - sheet surface of ufd ( fig. 1c ) .
as a consequence of this low conservation , structural superposition of ubc9 reveals a rotation of the e1 ufd domain between both complexes ( fig. 1e ) .
different orientations of ufd domains in complex with e2 can also be observed in other ubl systems , as revealed by the structures of ubiquitin and nedd8 ufd in complex with e2 ( uba1 - ubc4 complex pdb code 4ii2 ; and uba3 - ubc12 , pdb code 2nvu refs 13 and 15 ) .
all these structures suggest plasticity in the ufd interface that has evolved to specifically interact with its cognate e2 - conjugating enzyme in each ubl pathway .
the binding surface of ubc9 in yeast and human is highly conserved , and is basically formed by similar backbone and side - chain interactions in the alpha1 helix and the beta1 - beta2 loop of ubc9 ( yeast and human ubc9 share 56 % sequence identity ) .
specific side - chain interactions in ubc9 include a hydrophobic patch formed by leu6 , met36 , and leu38 , and a basic patch formed by arg13 , lys14 , arg17 and lys18 ( fig. 2a,b ) .
interestingly , all these conserved residues in ubc9 engage specific contacts with the non - conserved ufd surfaces of yeast and human .
a major contact difference in ubc9 corresponds to ala10 , which is substituted by gln10 in yeast , forming a polar interaction with glu515 of the yeast ufd domain ( fig. 1d ) .
previous point mutational analysis on these two patches of ubc9 , namely the basic alpha1 helix and the hydrophobic beta1 - beta2 loop , showed impairment in the binding to the e1 activating enzyme , indicating a major role of these two regions in the transfer of sumo between e1 and e2 proteins2527 .
the ufd interacting surface is extended and mostly formed by residues emanating from beta22 and beta23 strands and connecting loops ( fig. 1c,d ) .
a general feature of this interaction , widespread so far in all characterized ubl pathways , is the interaction through the same beta - sheet surface ( fig. 2 ) .
but in contrast to the ubc9 , the region involved in ufd is poorly conserved between yeast and human .
for simplicity , we have designated this region as low homology region involved in e2 binding 2 ( lheb2 ) .
the lheb2 can be divided in two regions , each establishing interactions with the basic and hydrophobic patches of ubc9 ( fig. 2a,b ) .
the first contact region in human ufd is composed by asp479 , ser492 , ser493 , glu494 and glu497 , which engage polar and charged contacts with the basic patch of ubc9 , composed by alpha1 helix residues arg13 and arg17 .
the lheb2 in human is highly conserved in all metazoan species analyzed ( see later in fig. 3 ) .
in contrast , in yeast the basic patch of ubc9 interacts with asp488 , tyr489 and asp490 , which is also a highly conserved sequence in all saccharomycetales species analyzed ( see later in fig. 3 ) .
interestingly , in the human structure phe522 is buried in an aliphatic pocket formed by arg17 , lys14 and lys18 ( see fig. 1c ) , whereas in yeast a similar ubc9 pocket buries tyr489 ( see fig. 1d ) , a residue located at the center of the lheb2 sequence instead of the lheb2 c - terminal position that occupies its human counterpart .
the second contact region of ufd interacts with the hydrophobic patch of ubc9 .
this interface is composed by backbone and side chain interactions emanating from the beta22 - beta23 connecting loop and beta23 strand of ufd .
in human ubc9 leu6 interacts with the beta22 - beta23 loop formed by gly485 and gly487 ( fig. 1c ) .
in contrast , in yeast , the composition and length of this loop is different and ubc9 leu6 interacts with leu478 ( fig. 1d ) .
in this region we can observe the highest structural homology between human and yeast .
in human three backbone hydrogen bonds are formed between gly487 and ile489 with ubc9 met36 and asn37 , but only two in yeast , between leu485 and ubc9 met36 .
additionally , the side chain of ile489 in human ( or leu485 in yeast ) is buried in both cases in the ubc9 hydrophobic pocket formed by met36 and leu38 ( fig. 1c,d ) .
finally , it is worth mentioning that the specific contacts established by yeast arg484 and phe491 are absent in metazoan sequences but highly conserved in saccharomycetales .
interface comparison with other ubl e1 - e2 complexes comparison of the ufd - e2 interfaces in ubiquitin and nedd8 ( uba1 - ubc4 complex , pdb code 4ii2 ; and uba3 - ubc12 , pdb code 1y8x ) 1315 indicate that only the hydrophobic patch in ubc9 is partially conserved in the ubiquitin e2 ( ubc4 ) , formed in this instance by leu3 and leu30 , which can be aligned with ubc9 leu6 and leu38 ( fig. 2 ) .
however , the basic patch in the alpha1 helix of ubc9 , formed by arg13 , lys14 , arg17 and lys18 , represents a specific feature of the sumo pathway and are not present neither in nedd8 ( ubc12 ) nor in ubiquitin ( ubc4 ) , which are replaced by acidic and aliphatic residues .
ubc4 and ubc12 also display a shorter beta1 - beta2 loop compared to ubc9 ( fig. 2 ) .
these differences in the e2 - conjugating enzyme between ubls modifiers result in the presence of non - complementary surfaces with e1 ufd domains , which are indeed the basis for the enzyme specificity among each ubl pathway .
for instance , sumo e1 ufd domain contains specific polar contacts ( ser492 , ser493 , glu494 and glu497 in human or asp488 , asp490 and asp493 in yeast ) to interact with the basic patch of ubc9 , however , in ubiquitin and nedd8 these positions are substituted by aliphatic residues ( ala954 and phe956 in ubiquitin or leu415 , val418 and ile421 in nedd8 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
as mentioned before , human ile489 and yeast leu485 adopt a similar conformation and engage identical backbone hydrogen bonds with the beta1 - beta2 loop of ubc9 .
interestingly , despite the lack of sequence conservation , the equivalent residues in the ubiquitin ufd domain , namely ser950 - leu951 , also engage analogous backbone hydrogen bonds contacts with the beta1 - beta2 loop of the e2 enzyme ( ubc4 ) 15 .
thus this backbone interaction represents a unique conserved structural element maintained in distant ubl systems such as sumo and ubiquitin .
this interaction does not occur in nedd8 ( ubc12 - uba3 , pdb code 1y8x ref .
13 ) , in which the e2 enzyme sits across a similar region of the ufd domain but with a different angle compared to ubiquitin , and the contacts between both ubl systems are poorly conserved and thus not complementary1815 .
evolutionary conservation of the sumo e1 ufd interfaces structural comparison between human and yeast indicate that sumo ufd domains are composed by a different set of residues that can engage productive interactions with a conserved e2 enzyme .
in order to evaluate the biological relevance of these two alternative structural interfaces involved in e2 interactions , we have analyzed the conservation of the lheb2 sequence of the e1 ufd domains across species .
in human , the lheb2 region is comprised by residues between pro478 and phe509 ( figs 1a and 3e ) , whilst in yeast is composed by residues between pro472 and ile502 ( figs 1b and 3e ) .
we searched for human e1 ufd domain orthologs at the eggnog database and focused on metazoan and fungal species , for which structural information of the e1 ufd - e2 interactions is available .
since fungal e1 displayed a high level of sequence divergence , we focused on species belonging to the saccharomycetales order , which include saccharomyces cerevisae .
the phylogenetic analyses of both domains , e1 ufd and lheb2 , show that clustering of the e1 - ufd sequences in the phylogenetic tree reflects the taxonomical relationships of the species represented ( fig. 4a ) .
on the contrary , when the same analysis was performed with the lheb2 domain , tree distribution is not consistent with taxonomic lineages ( fig. 4b ) , suggesting that this region presents higher variability than the ufd domain where is contained .
in addition , we analyzed the distribution of homology between pairs .
saccharomycetales ufd or lheb2 sequences were compared with the corresponding human ( conservation to outlier ) or yeast sequences ( conservation within the group ) .
similarly , metazoan ufd or lheb2 sequences were compared with the corresponding yeast ( conservation to outlier ) or human sequences ( conservation within the group ) .
the homology pair distributions were plotted onto box plots ( supplemental fig. s2 ) .
in general , when sequences were compared with an outlier , in all groups except in saccharomycetales , the median of the obtained distribution was higher in the lheb2 sequence analysis than in the ufd .
at the same time , the box length , whose limits indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles , is higher for the lheb2 than for the ufd homology pair distributions , suggesting that this region also presents higher variability .
these results support the phylogenetic analyses indicating that , in general , the lheb2 sequence is more conserved than the ufd domain within each evolutionary group , although the individual sequences contained in each group display higher variability .
similar results were obtained when sequences were compared with a reference sequence within each group , saccharomycetales or metazoan .
the homology analysis of the residues involved in ubc9 contacts are even higher conserved and minor differences were identified among phyla .
in chordates , the highest conserved group , all the contacts described in the human structure are present in all species analyzed within this phylum ( fig. 3c ) .
in arthropoda , sequence comparison also display little divergence , but in this case variations can be found in the composition of the beta22 - beta23 connecting loop of ufd , presenting different loop lengths but still conserving gly485 and gly487 in many species of the phylum ( fig. 3b ) .
in nematode , the five species analyzed also display conservation in the major e2 contact residues , but in contrast to chordate and arthropoda , the beta12 - beta13 connecting loop displays little homology and gly485 and gly487 , present in chordata and arthropoda , have been substituted ( fig. 3a ) .
therefore , all major specific ufd contacts with ubc9 are basically conserved in metazoa , including contacts with the hydrophobic and the basic patches of the ubc9 surface .
for instance , human asp479 , ser492 , ser493 , glu494 and glu497 ( occasionally replaced by aspartic ) , which interact with ubc9 arg13 and arg17 , are highly conserved in all species analyzed .
similarly , the hydrophobic interaction of the human ufd ile489 , which interacts with ubc9 met36 and leu38 , is also conserved but can be occasionally substituted by valine in some species .
the major differences in the ufd interface in metazoa are located in the beta22 - beta23 connecting loop , formed in human by gly485 and gly487 , which interact with ubc9 leu6 .
whereas in chordate this connecting loop is highly conserved , in arthropod and particularly in nematode , this loop displays different lengths and amino acid composition .
it is worth mentioning here that the extension and composition of this particular loop in ufd domains is highly divergent between e1 - activating enzymes specific to different ubl modifiers , suggesting that this domain has evolved to interact with its cognate e2 - enzyme .
in contrast to metazoa , sequence comparison of the e2 binding region of the yeast ufd domain with members of the fungi kingdom is highly diverse , and further structural analyses will be required for establishing the molecular basis of e1 - e2 interactions in those divergent groups .
in the order of saccharomycetales , the major specific contacts described in the structure of s. cerevisiae ufd - ubc9 complex25 are conserved .
in this instance , as shown before in the structural comparison , the consensus binding sequence in saccharomycetales is completely different to metazoan .
yeast ufd residues asp488 , asp490 and asp493 , which interact with the basic patch of ubc9 , are highly conserved in saccharomycetales ( fig. 3d,e ) , as well as leu478 , leu485 and phe491 , which interact with the hydrophobic patch of ubc9 .
other specific contacts in the structure , such as arg484 and tyr489 , are replaced by residues with similar chemical properties , such as lysine for arg484 and , phenylalanine , isoleucine or valine for tyr489 ( fig. 3d,e ) .
in the essential sumo conjugation pathway , protein - protein interactions have evolved to maintain specificity of the modifier and the targets .
the sumo conjugating enzyme constitutes the link between modifier specificity , which is selected by the e1 activating enzyme , and the protein substrate specificity , mediated by the cooperation between the e2 and the e3 ligase enzymes .
in the e1 - e2 interactions , a region in the e1 ufd domain , the lheb2 sequence , plays a major role in e2 recruitment to the e1 .
in evolutionary distant groups , the lheb2 sequences are poorly conserved according to sequence homology and length .
on the contrary , in closely related phylogenetic groups , the conservation of the lheb2 sequence is higher , highlighting the relevance of this interaction between e1 and e2 structures .
we speculate that these distinctive strategies for e1 - e2 interactions through the e1 ufd domain are the consequence of a high selective pressure to ensure modifier specificity .
future structural analyses of other evolutionary distant groups , such as plants or protozoa , will most probably uncover novel molecular determinants mediating e1 - e2 interactions .
conclusions in summary , structural comparison of yeast and human sumo ufd - e2 complexes and sequence alignment of sumo ufd domains , reveal the presence of at least two complementary types of interfaces , which are conserved across species from the same kingdom ( metazoan ) or in the case of the fungi kingdom , in the same order ( saccharomycetales ) .
despite the low level of sequence homology in the ufd domains among these distant species of different kingdoms , these two types of interfaces maintain the structural and chemical properties necessary to interact with a conserved e2 binding surface .
structural and sequential comparisons have also revealed at least two different types of consensus sequences in the e1 ufd domain , which we named lheb2 sequences , that can complement the conserved surface in the e2 enzyme .
interestingly , sequence conservation in the e2 binding region is higher than in the overall ufd domain , suggesting the presence of an evolutionary pressure to maintain the contacts with the e2 - conjugating enzyme , which are essential for the correct function of each ubl pathway .

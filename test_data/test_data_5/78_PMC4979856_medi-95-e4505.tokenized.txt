http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract background : osteogenesis imperfecta ( oi ) is a rare congenital genetic osteodystrophy , which has a prevalence of 1:20,000 .
oi is caused by the mutation of the col1a1 / col1a2 genes , leading to a deficit of quality and / or quantity in the synthesis of procollagen - alpha type 1 .
seven different forms of diverse clinical entity have been classified by sillence and glorieux , although , recently , up to 11 forms characterized by different genetic mutations have been recognized .
patients with oi suffer from extreme bone fragility and osteoporosis , which often predisposes them to frequent fractures .
this paper presents the case of a child with oi type iv who , at birth , was also diagnosed with a severe clubfoot ( congenital talipes equinovarus ) grade iii .
patient 's mother also suffers from oi type iv. methods : the treatment was started by placing femoro - podalic corrective casts , according to the ponseti method , but some unexpected problems occurred during this treatment .
when the patient was 3 months of age , we decided to correct the clubfoot before the time limit planned , performing a bilateral posteromedial surgical release .
results : three weeks after surgery the casts were removed and replaced with bilateral spica cast - like braces .
on the 6th postoperative week , the patient began wearing bebax corrective shoes , after 1 year ambidextrous orthopedic shoes .
now , he is 2 years old and has started to walk properly without any orthesis .
conclusion : in the presence of an orthopedic pathology associated with oi , it is recommended to manage the patient according to the underlying pathology , always considering the bone fragility associated with oi. the final surgical treatment to correct the clubfoot can be done earlier , if necessary .
in our opinion , this uncommon association between oi and clubfoot is non - syndromic .
this means that the two congenital diseases are not necessarily included in a singular uncommon genetic syndrome , but the clubfoot was caused by multifactorial causes , especially by both the mother 's bisphosphonate drug therapy and the amniocentesis performed during her pregnancy to drain polyhydramnios .
in our analysis , those environmental factors could have interacted with an already altered genetic substratum , contributing to develop this rare combination of congenital disorders .
keywords bisphosphonates clubfoot congenital talipes equinovarus deformities osteogenesis imperfecta posteromedial release open - accesstrue 1 introduction osteogenesis imperfecta ( oi ) is a rare congenital genetic osteodystrophy .
this mutation leads to a quality and / or quantity deficit in the bones of patients with oi , characterized by extreme bone fragility and osteoporosis , which often predisposes them to frequent fractures .
in addition , according to the classification of sillence and glorieux ( 2004 ) , 7 different oi forms of diverse clinical entity have been classified , although , recently , up to 11 forms characterized by different genetic mutations have been recognized. [ 1 - 3 ] the prevalence of oi cases in the world 's population is approximately 1:20,000 livebirths ,[ 4 ] of which about half are affected with oi type i or iv. the authors report the case of a newborn suffering from oi type iv , who was brought to us for observation , at the center for reference and treatment of congenital osteodystrophies , located in the department of pediatrics of our hospital , at the age of 2 weeks .
the patient had a clubfoot ( congenital talipes equinovarus [ cte ]) grade iii ( fig. 1 ) , in combination with the basic genetic disorder .
the clubfoot deformity has a prevalence of 1:1000 livebirths ,[ 5 ] and this epidemiological data can give a clear picture of how rare it is to find a combination of these two pathologies .
on the other hand , oi type iv is an autosomal dominant condition , compatible with life even if its quality could be poor .
this disease is caused by the mutation of the col1a1 / col1a2 genes , leading to a deficit of quality and / or quantity in the synthesis of the procollagen - alpha type 1 .
figure 1 uncommon iii grade clubfoot ( congenital talipes equinovarus [ cte ]) in newborn patient affected by oi. oi = osteogenesis imperfecta .
this is an oi type of moderate seriousness and patients affected are characterized by low height , mild or moderate scoliosis , important bone weakness , white / grey sclerae , and dentinogenesis imperfecta .
our patient 's mother , who also suffers from oi type iv , had given birth to her child at the 34th week of gestation and reported a history of other two pregnancies brought to term , three bouts of polyhydramnios during the pregnancy , and the voluntary suspension of the infusion therapy with neridronate for the last 2 years .
all her children were affected with oi , but no other had presented with clubfoot .
2 materials and methods according to italian law , it is not necessary that an ethical committee approve this kind of study even if the patient is a minor , because an informed consent describing the study purpose was approved and signed by the patient 's parents , before starting the study .
the treatment was started after 2 weeks from the patient 's birth , by placing lightweight femoro - podalic corrective casts , according to the ponseti method , to be changed every 2 weeks in order to then proceed to the surgical correction of any residual deformities .
as the patient 's parents had to commute from another region , which was rather far from our center for reference and treatment of congenital osteodystrophies in the pediatrics department of the policlinico umberto i hospital , there was no possibility of a strict control on the progress of this treatment .
after 2 weeks of treatment with the casts , when the baby was 1 month of age , we were faced with the first unexpected problem : a shaft fracture at the middle third of the right femur , caused by a leverage effect of the cast on the femur of the child , which happened when his mother picked him up without supporting the leg ( fig. 2 ) .
a closed reduction of the fracture under anaesthesia was performed , with pelvic - podalic spica casting , including the feet , maintaining the correction of the clubfoot .
figure 2 right femur shaft fracture , accidentally caused by a leverage effect of the cast on the femur of the child .
about 21 days after the reduction , a second problem presented itself .
without medical consultation , the parents decided to cut the cast just above the foot , as they judged it to be too tight and that it could cause pain to the child .
this decision resulted in a venturi vacuum effect on the baby 's foot , which swelled with a massive deposit of liquids ( fig. 3 ) .
the venturi vacuum effect is the phenomenon that occurs when a fluid that flows through a circular duct is forced through a narrow section , resulting in a pressure reduction and a velocity increase .
this effect determines that , in the constricted circular duct , the fluid 's hydrostatic pressure decreases and its velocity increases on the distal side of the constriction. [ 6 ] figure 3 venturi vacuum effect on the baby 's foot , caused by the parent 's cutting of the cast just above the foot .
faced with such third party handling of the child 's care , both due to the distance and the difficulty by part of parents to handle such a delicate situation , and as the diaphyseal fracture of the femur was in advanced state of consolidation , we decided to wait at least 15 days , allowing the swelling of the foot to go down , in order to then intervene surgically , ahead of the predicted schedule , to correct the clubfoot .
the femoral shaft fracture healed in 45 days from the injury , without any kind of remaining deformity ; the bone callus formation was normal , without any delayed union or vicious consolidation .
consequently , when the patient was 3 months old , we performed a bilateral posteromedial release modified technique .
this is a syndesmoplasty and tenoplasty surgical procedure , which consisted in : the lengthening of the achilles tendon , the posterior tibial tendons , the flexor digitorum communis , and flexor hallucis ; the opening of the subtalar , talonavicular , and medial cuneiform joints in order to correct any deformities .
3 results three weeks after surgery the casts were removed and replaced with bilateral spica cast - like braces , in order to maintain the obtained correction ( figs. 4 - 6 ) .
on the 6th postoperative week , the patient , now almost 5 months old , began wearing bebax corrective shoes ( camp ( r )) 24 hours per day for 9 months. [ 7 ] then , in the next 4 months , bebax corrective shoes were worn only during the night , interchanging them with ambidextrous orthopedic shoes during the day .
the patient , at the age of 18 months , started to wear only orthopedic shoes .
there were no further complications .

figure 6 bilateral spica cast - like braces application to maintain the corrections obtained with surgery .
the patient has now turned 2 years of age , and ambulates properly without pain and with a minimum residual adduction of the forefoot , but without any stiffness ( fig. 7 ) .
he is continuing a medical therapy with neridronate ( therapeutic dose : 2 mg / kg i.v. every 3 months ) at our center , according to the oi protocol of treatment .
the patient is followed and controlled periodically in our center for reference and treatment of congenital osteodystrophies , in the pediatrics department of the policlinico umberto i hospital .

4 discussion in medical literature , we searched for how many cases of clubfoot ( cte ) combined with oi were reported .
the research was done on medline using the following keywords .
" osteogenesis imperfecta ," " clubfoot ," " congenital talipes equinovarus ," " case report ," " association ," " cases. " the only relevant article we found in literature was written by munns et al ,[ 8 ] who were the only ones to describe a similar case of a mother with oi who gave birth to a child with clubfoot and oi. it is true that oi is one of the commonest genetic disorders of the bone , even if it is a rare disease , but is very uncommon to find it combined with congenital clubfoot .
munns hypothesized , in his specific case , that the mother 's exposure to her periodic therapy with pamidronate may have been the causative factor that generated the clubfoot , even though the administration of this drug had been suspended during her pregnancy .
the doses given in this study refer to about 9 mg / kg / year of pamidronate , administered to the mother as drug therapy from the age of 12 to 17 , which is when she became pregnant .
our pharmacological protocol makes use of neridronate , administered intravenously at doses of 2 mg / kg every 3 months , a similar amount to that described by munns in his study .
in analyzing our case , the mother reported to have suspended the drug treatment , on her own , as of 2 years before her last pregnancy .
therefore , we cannot say with certainty that one of the possible causes of clubfoot in oi can be attributed to the drug treatment with bisphosphonates .
including the case we just described , the only two cases so far reported in literature of clubfoot combined with oi are both connected to children of mothers with oi. we cannot exclude a multi - factorial etiopathogenesis where the exposure to bisphosphonates also plays a role .
in a study conducted by d'eufemia et al ,[ 9 ] it is described that , even in the case of an interruption in the administration of neridronate , the drug remains in the circulation of patient 's organism for over 2 years .
in our case , this could have been the timeline in which our patient was exposed , during pregnancy , to doses of bisphosphonate that were sufficient enough to generate the clubfoot , despite the therapy interruption by part of the mother .
in the case described , the etiology of the clubfoot could be attributed not only to the possible teratogenic effect of neridronate , but also to additional factors .
the mother , in fact , reported a history of 3 bouts of polyhydramnios during the pregnancy .
during the first bout of polyhydramnios the clubfoot had not yet been diagnosed through the morphological prenatal ultrasound .
in our opinion , both the amniocentesis performed on the woman during the 14th and the 20th week of her pregnancy , to drain the amniotic fluid excess , played a role in developing child 's clubfoot .
bacino and hecht [ 10 ] recently analyzed and updated the pathogenic theories about clubfoot .
they describe the existence of a syndromic and a non - syndromic clubfoot .
the syndromic clubfoot is caused by different genetic mutations and is always associated with other genetic disorders , such as atrophy and myotonic dystrophy , distal arthrogryposis , myelomeningocele , or spina bifida .
the authors , instead , also describe the non - syndromic clubfoot in their study , which is caused by environmental or prenatal mechanical factors , especially maternal smoking during pregnancy , prenatal fetal exposition to teratogenic drugs , or early amniocentesis ( 11 - 14 weeks of pregnancy ) .
in our opinion , our patient 's clubfoot could be classified as non - syndromic , because its combination with oi does not necessarily belong to genetic mutations connected to the basic genetic disorder , but to the fact that the mother underwent two amniocentesis , once during her 14th week of pregnancy and the second one at the beginning of the 20th week .
cte was diagnosed on 23rd week of pregnancy through morphological prenatal ultrasound scan .
in 1980 , hall and spranger [ 11 ] already reported 13 cases of undefined and unclassifiable skeletal dysplasias diagnosed in infants during their examination at birth , defined by the authors as " congenital bowing of the long bones ," which were characterized most of all by the following different congenital deformities patterns : clubfoot ( talipes equinovarus ) , bowing and deformities of long bones , macrocephalia , microsomia , low weight and / or low height , triangular face , perinatal bone fractures , micrognathia , discoloration / defective teeth .
at least three of those patterns were described in each patient reported in the study , and a pregnancy characterized by polyhydramnios , olygohydramnios , or decreased fetal activity was described in almost in all the cases .
the authors describe those phenotypes as aspecific bone dysplasias , but are not able to give a certain diagnosis or explain about the exact etiopathogenesis that could have caused the disorders associated to those dysplasias .
in our specific case , as abnormalities associated to the oi type iv , the child presented only light grey sclerae , a mild dentinogenesis imperfecta of the milk teeth , extreme ligamentous laxity , and no hypoacusis .
during the physical examination at birth , the patient did not present any visceral defect and there was not yet any evidence of bone deformities .
there were no other rare combined congenital disorders to be reported .
we searched for disraphisms , spina bifida , congenital hip dislocation , muscular dystrophies , neurofibromatosis , but also for ehlers - danlos disease , marfan syndrome , and any other rare and genetic disease connected to collagen defect .
now the child is 2 years old , has been bearing weight on his legs since he was 20 months old , and started presenting with the following deformity patterns : left tibia and fibula varus and procurvatus bows , right tibia and fibula procurvatus bow and right femur varus bow .
at the moment these deformities are not severe .
we frequently evaluate our patients affected by oi , following them during their growth , and we promptly plan the specific surgical correction of deformities when it is necessary .
we first decided to perform a conservative treatment of the clubfoot , by placing lightweight femoro - podalic corrective casts , according to the ponseti method .
considering that the child was also affected by oi , we planned to manage this treatment carefully given the patient 's bone weakness , and to avoid the surgical correction , even though the clubfoot was a really severe type .
to avoid the surgical correction of the most severe clubfoot types , ponseti et al [ 12 ] described a modified conservative treatment , still based on progressive castings to correct the cte , but for longer periods and with more complex casts to place on children .
the results evidenced with this technique were successful .
in this case , we did not expect to be faced with the complications already described above and we could not wait any longer for the surgical correction of the clubfoot , even though the patient was only 3 months old at the moment of the intervention , and that it could be considered reprehensible to perform surgery on such a young infant .
however , to avoid any other unexpected problems , because of the patient 's fragility caused by oi and the bad compliance of his parents with our cares , we planned to perform the surgery as soon as possible .
a bilateral posteromedial surgical release was performed to correct the clubfoot , using a modified technique consisting in the lengthening of the achilles tendon , the posterior tibial tendons , the flexor digitorum communis and flexor halluces and the opening of the subtalar , talonavicular and medial cuneiform joints .
edmondson et al [ 13 ] also described that , in severely deformed clubfeet , it is correct to perform this surgical technique before 3 months of age , as patients operated before that age have the best results in terms of correction of deformity and functional outcomes in a long - term follow up , compared with those who are more than 3 months old at the time of surgery .
the case we reported is rare among the rare , for that reason , the treatment undertaken was decided not only by carefully assessing the risks associated with the base genetic condition , but also in relation to the unexpected problems we encountered during the course of treatment , which contributed in making the treatment more complex to manage .
in conclusion , in the presence of an orthopedic pathology associated with oi , we recommend always to manage the patient according to the underlying pathology , considering the bone fragility associated with oi at all times .
in order to avoid fractures of the oi patient 's weak bones , it is important to always place the most lightweight casts , acting with caution and even monitoring any possible autonomous initiative by part of the parents in the management of the case .
as was observed by our experience , the final surgical treatment to correct the clubfoot can be successful even if it is done earlier , if necessary , also if the patient is only 3 months old .
finally , we need to consider a possible association of clubfoot in oi caused by multifactorial factors and not necessarily included in a singular uncommon genetic syndrome .
in our case , we hypothesize that the mechanical effect of both the amniocentesis , performed on the mother during pregnancy to drain bouts of polyhydramnios , and the doses of bisphosphonates ( which are teratogenic drugs ) , administered to the mother before conception or during pregnancy , interacting with an already altered genetic substratum , could have played an important role on the clubfoot etiopathogenesis , independently from the genetic mutations or patterns associated with oi type iv. this causality so far has not been established , due to the rarity of the specific case , but it should be analyzed if other cases were to occur in the future , in combination with any other factors that may intervene in the etiopathogenesis of clubfoot in patients with oi. abbreviations : cte = congenital talipes equinovarus , oi = osteogenesis imperfecta .

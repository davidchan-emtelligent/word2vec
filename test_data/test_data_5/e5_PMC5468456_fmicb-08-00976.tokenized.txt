as the highest place of the world , the tibetan plateau is a fragile ecosystem .
given the importance of microbial communities in driving soil nutrient cycling , it is of interest to document the microbial biogeographic pattern here .
we adopted a microarray - based tool named geochip 4.0 to investigate grassland microbial functional genes along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m above sea level open to free grazing by local herdsmen and wild animals .
interestingly , microbial functional diversities increase with elevation , so does the relative abundances of genes associated with carbon degradation , nitrogen cycling , methane production , cold shock and oxygen limitation .
the range of shannon diversities ( 10.27 - 10.58 ) showed considerably smaller variation than what was previously observed at ungrazed sites nearby ( 9.95 - 10.65 ) , suggesting the important role of livestock grazing on microbial diversities .
closer examination showed that the dissimilarity of microbial community at our study sites increased with elevations , revealing an elevation - decay relationship of microbial functional genes .
both microbial functional diversity and the number of unique genes increased with elevations .
furthermore , we detected a tight linkage of greenhouse gas ( co2 ) and relative abundances of carbon cycling genes .
our biogeographic study provides insights on microbial functional diversity and soil biogeochemical cycling in tibetan pastures .
microbial biogeography soil microbial community microbial functional potential alpine grassland altitudinal gradient national natural science foundation of china10.13039 / 50110000180941471202national natural science foundation of china10.13039 / 50110000180941430856 introduction it is estimated that two - thirds of the tibetan plateau , the highest and largest plateau on earth characterized by cold climate , low oxygen level , strong uv irradiation and poor primary productivity , are comprised of alpine grasslands ( qiu , 2008 ) .
in the past decade , tibet has witnessed more than three - fold increases in average gross domestic product per capita and a 10 % increase in human population , resulting in pronounced influence on natural environments ( national bureau of statistics of china , 2015 - 2006 ) .
in addition , global warming has led to the substantial glacier and permafrost thaw , which impose risks of drought and flooding ( qiu , 2008 ) .
since soil is considered to be the most complex ecosystem on earth and plays a vital role in mediating biogeochemical cycling ( falkowski et al. , 2008 ; bardgett and van der putten , 2014 ) , it is of great interest to examine the biogeography of soil microbial communities in such a fragile ecosystem ( wu et al. , 2016a ) .
to date , biogeographic variations of microbial communities have predominantly been studied at the taxonomic level ( bryant et al. , 2008 ; singh et al. , 2012 ) .
phylogenetic diversities along elevation gradients showed a dip pattern ( singh et al. , 2014 ) or a bulge pattern ( singh et al. , 2012 , 2016 ) at mid elevations , a monotonic decrease pattern ( bryant et al. , 2008 ) , or no pattern ( lauber et al. , 2009 ; fierer et al. , 2011 ) .
the major controlling factors in driving the phylogenetic diversity can be attributed to temperature ( nottingham et al. , 2016 ) , soil ph ( zhang et al. , 2015 ) , c / n ( siles and margesin , 2016 ) , carbon content , climate variability ( delgado - baquerizo et al. , 2016 ) and plant diversity ( zhang et al. , 2015 ) .
nonetheless , there is a renewed interest in understanding the biogeography of microbial functional traits , which sheds light on microbial community functions ( green et al. , 2008 ) .
geochip , a microarray - based tool , is excellent in detecting microbial functional genes .
it contains dna probes targeting a variety of functional genes , including those associated with elemental cycling , stress response , metal resistance and complex carbon degradation ( he et al. , 2007 ) .
it has been successfully used to profile functional genes of microbial communities in different habitats ( van nostrand et al. , 2009 ; chu et al. , 2014 ; ding et al. , 2015 ) , which provides important insights into microbe - mediated processes .
it was shown that measurements of relative abundances of functional genes were predictive of in situ co2 and n2o emissions ( morales et al. , 2010 ) and nitrification potential ( zhao et al. , 2014 ) to certain extent .
recently , we have used geochip to examine functional genes of soil microbial communities in an enclosed tibetan alpine grassland to prevent anthropogenic disturbance , which revealed strikingly tight linkages between microbial functional gene structure and several environmental variables ( yang et al. , 2014 ) .
livestock grazing is the most prevalent economic activity in tibet ( zhou et al. , 2006 ) , resulting in significant ecological effects .
for example , it reduces vegetation biomass , switches dominant plant species to short and prostrate forb species ( lkhagva et al. , 2013 ) , expands the range of soil temperature fluctuation , increases soil mean temperature , enhances forage quality ( odriozola et al. , 2014 ) , and decreases microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen ( fu et al. , 2012 ) .
furthermore , owing to strong ruminant ch4 emission , total greenhouse gas budget of high grazing densities ( - 1034 g co2eq m - 2 yr - 1 ) was nearly four times to that of low grazing densities ( - 260 g co2eq m - 2 yr - 1 ) ( skiba et al. , 2013 ) .
thus , it is important to examine microbial biogeography of functional genes in the grassland subjected to livestock grazing , which is more common in tibet .
in this study , we collected soil samples along an altitudinal gradient of 3200 , 3400 , 3600 , and 3800 m asl in a tibetan grassland subjected to open free livestock grazing .
we adopted geochip 4.0 to examine microbial functional genes , aiming to address the following hypotheses : ( i ) because vegetation removal , manure deposition , and trampling by grazing impose multi - dimensional disturbance to soil , microbial biogeographic pattern in pasture would substantially differ from what is observed in the enclosed grassland ; ( ii ) the relative abundance of specific microbial functional genes can be used to explain co2 and n2o fluxes .
the relationship between gene abundance and process rates has been a topic of dispute .
it was shown recently that the activity of c degradation enzymes ( beta - d - cellulosidase , beta - xylosidase , alpha - glucosidase and n - acetyl - beta - glucosaminidase ) in grain - producing soils was significant correlated to the relative abundance of microbial functional gene abundance determined by geochip 4.0 ( r2 > 0.90 , p < 0.001 ) ( trivedi et al. , 2016 ) , and amoa gene relative abundances had significant positive correlations with soil nitrification potentials ( r > 0.48 , p < 0.05 ) in agricultural soils ( liu et al. , 2015 ) .
however , a meta - analysis showed that the linkages between gene abundance and processes are often missed in many studies , which can be ascribed to habitat type or differences among genes ( rocca et al. , 2015 ) .
therefore , it is interesting to examine whether there is such linkage in this study .
materials and methods site description and soil sampling this study was carried out at the haibei alpine meadow ecosystem research station located in the northeast of the tibetan plateau .
the region has a typical plateau continental climate characterized by cold and long winter but warm and short summer , with annual mean air temperature of - 1.7degreesc and annual mean precipitation of 570 mm ( zhao et al. , 2006 ) .
the vegetation growing season is from may to september .
the major soil type is mat cryic cambisol based on chinese soil taxonomic classification system ( arthur et al. , 2008 ) .
soil samples were collected at elevations of 3200 , 3400 , 3600 , and 3800 m asl .
geographical distances between adjacent elevations were 1.3 km ( 3600 - 3800 m ) , 4.2 km ( 3400 - 3600 m ) , and 6.2 km ( 3200 - 3400 m ) .
to reduce soil heterogeneity , five soil cores at the 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm depths were randomly taken from a location with a size of 1 x 1 m and thoroughly mixed to make a composite sample .
three such locations at each elevation , which were several to dozens of meters away from each other , were chosen to create biological triplicates .
all soil samples were collected in august 2009 and immediately transported on ice to the laboratory .
after being sieved with 2 mm mesh to remove visible vegetation roots , residues and stones , parts of samples were stored at - 80degreesc for dna extraction and 4degreesc for environmental variable measurements , respectively .
dna extraction , purification , and quantitation after mixing soil cores from 0 to 10 cm and 10 to 20 cm depths , we extracted soil dna with fastdna spin kits ( mp biomedical , carlsbad , ca , united states ) following manufacturer 's instructions and then purified the extracted dna in a mixture of 2.0 volume of 100 % ice - cold ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3 m naoac ( ph 5.2 ) .
after overnight incubation at - 20degreesc , dna solutions were centrifuged at 13000 g for 30 min and then washed with 1 ml 70 % ethanol .
then dna solutions were air dried for 30 min and dissolved in nuclease - free water .
we used nanodrop nd - 1000 spectrophotometer ( nanodrop technologies inc. , wilmington , de , united states ) to determine dna quality and a picogreen method using a fluostar optima ( bmg labtech , jena , germany ) to determine dna concentrations ( ahn et al. , 1996 ) .
geochip 4.0 experiments dna was labeled with dye cy - 5 by a random priming method as previously described ( yang et al. , 2017 ) and the labeled dna was purified with qia quick purification kits ( qiagen , valencia , ca , united states ) .
speedvac ( thermosavant , milford , ma , united states ) was used to dry dna at 45degreesc for 45 min .
we hybridized dna with geochip 4.0 on a maui hybridization station ( biomicro , salt lake city , ut , united states ) at 42degreesc for 16 h , as described previously ( yue et al. , 2015 ) .
the slides were scanned using a nimblegen ms200 scanner ( roche , madison , wi , united states ) at 633 nm using 100 % laser power and 75 % photomultiplier tube gain .
signal intensities were quantified by scanned images .
the elevation - decay relationship ( edr ) sorensen similarity was calculated for generating the edr z - value .
an equation of log ( ss ) = constant - 2zlog ( d ) was used to calculate power - law exponent z , in which d was the euclidean distance between two elevations and ss was the pairwise similarity in microbial compositions by using sorensen 's index .
elevation differences for samples at the same elevation were zero , which were changed into 0.01 to enable logarithm transformation ( legendre and legendre , 1998 ) .
since our pairwise comparison data were not independent with each other , we determined whether the slope was significant different from zero by bootstrapping ( 999 times ) ( efron and tibshirani , 1994 ) .
to this end , the original dataset was randomly paired ( with replacement ) and the slope of edr was calculated by the new dataset .
using one sample t - test , we determined whether the slopes of the regressions based on bootstrapping differed from the observed slope followed by bh correction for p - value ( zhou et al. , 2008 ) .
data analysis we processed raw data as follows : ( i ) removing spots with a signal to noise ratio of less than 2.0 ; ( ii ) removing spots detected only once in three replicates ; ( iii ) normalizing intensity of each spot by dividing total signal intensity of a sample and multiplying by a constant ; and ( iv ) taking natural logarithm ( wu et al. , 2016b ) .
subsequently , the detrended correspondence analysis ( dca ) , a multivariate statistical method ( ayoub - hannaa et al. , 2013 ) , was used to compare overall functional gene structures across different samples .
the hierarchical clustering analysis was used to cluster different microbial functional gene structures among soil samples .
the dissimilarity test of adonis , one of the permutational multivariate analysis using distance matrices ( ricotta and burrascano , 2009 ) , was used to test differences of functional gene structures among different elevations .
alpha diversities were presented by shannon and simpson indexes .
the canonical correspondence analysis ( cca ) was used to identify main environmental drivers in shaping microbial communities .
variance inflation factors ( vif ) of less than 20 were used as a threshold to remove redundant variables before performing cca .
the variation partitioning analysis ( vpa ) was used to partition environmental variables selected by cca into three groups .
simple mantel tests were performed to determine the relationships between microbial communities and environmental variables .
correlations between relative abundances of functional genes and environmental variables were determined by pearson correlation and then adjusted by false discovery rate ( fdr ) method .
these analyses were carried out using functions in the vegan package ( v. 2.3 - 1 ) in r - studio v .
3.2.2 .
association network analysis was performed with a subset of geochip data since the whole dataset was beyond the computational capacity .
a random matrix theory ( rmt ) - based algorithm was used to construct networks using the coefficients of spearman correlations to define similarity matrix ( deng et al. , 2012 ) .
measurements of soil and vegetation variables we recorded in situ soil temperatures using type - k thermocouples ( campbell scientific , logan , ut , united states ) with a cr1000 datalogger at the depth of 10 cm , which represents 0 - 20 cm. we measured in situ soil moisture at the depth of 10 cm using a time domain reflectometry ( model diviner - 2000 , sentek pty ltd. , stepney , sa , australia ) .
soil ph data were missing for our sample .
therefore , we used soils nearby our plots collected in 2012 as substitutes since soil ph in tibet was a generally stable variable , which had decreased only by 0.5 units since 1980 ( zhou et al. , 2009 ) .
we measured soil ph with a combination glass electrode in soil / water solution of volume ratio 1:5 .
the concentrations of ammonia and nitrate were detected by a fiastar 5000 analyzer ( yang et al. , 2013 ) .
to generate finer measurements of nitrogen , carbon and phosphorus , we examined total nitrogen ( tn ) , total organic carbon ( toc ) and total phosphorus at both depths of 0 - 10 cm and 10 - 20 cm. we determined tn by a vario el iii elemental analyzer ( elementar , hanau , germany ) , toc by a toc - 5000a analyzer ( shimadzu corp. , kyoto , japan ) and total phosphorus by a uv - visible spectrophotometer ( agilent 8453 , agilent co. , santa clara , ca , united states ) .
using a agilent 4890d gas chromatograph ( agilent co. , santa clara , ca , united states ) equipped with flame ionization detector ( fid ) and electron capture detector ( ecd ) ( wang and wang , 2003 ) , we quantified greenhouse gasses of co2 , ch4 and n2o except the 3600 m site , where rat holes were too rampant to perform accurate measurements of greenhouse gasses ( yang et al. , 2014 ) .
during gas sampling , static stainless steel chambers ( 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm ) were manually closed for half an hour .
then gas samples were taken every 10 min by plastic syringes and sampled within 24 h ( hu et al. , 2010 ) .
we determined vegetation variables of species number , aboveground vegetation biomass and vegetation diversity ( shannon index ) .
results environmental variables soil temperature ( t ) and ph decreased along the altitudinal gradient ( table 1 ) , while soil moisture , nitrate ( no3 - ) and tn measured at the 10 - 20 cm depth ( tn10 - 20cm ) increased with elevations .
toc measured at the 10 - 20 cm depth ( toc10 - 20cm ) , tn measured at the 0 - 10 cm depth ( tn0 - 10 cm ) and vegetation diversity were higher at 3400 and 3600 m than those at 3200 and 3800 m. notably , there were correlations ( p < 0.050 ) among toc , tn , and total phosphorous ( tp ) ( supplementary table s1 ) .

bsignificant differences among elevations are indicated by different alphabetic letters .
cvegetation diversity was calculated by shannon index .
the biogeographic pattern of microbial functional genes a total of 52864 genes were detected by geochip , ranging from 31528 to 43816 for each site ( supplementary table s2 ) .
the results of the dissimilarity test of adonis showed that samples were grouped by elevations ( supplementary table s3 ) .
microbial functional diversities , represented as shannon indices , ranged in 10.27 - 10.58 and increased ( p < 0.050 ) with elevations ( supplementary table s2 ) .
however , the evenness indices of microbial functional genes were similar across elevations ( supplementary table s2 ) .
the elevation - decay relationship ( edr ) a significant edr ( r = - 0.80 , p < 0.001 ) was observed for the whole functional community ( figure 1 ) with a z - value of 0.0093 ( supplementary table s4 ) .
we found that almost all z - values of carbon or nitrogen cycling processes were lower than 0.01 , with the highest z - value ( 0.0127 ) of anammox and the lowest z - value ( 0.0055 ) of nitrogen fixation .
figure 1 elevation - decay relationship for whole microbial community ( z - value = 0.0093 , t = - 209.6 , n = 999 , p < 0.001 ) .
similarity represents sorensen 's similarity index .
ubiquitous genes , defined as genes detected in all of four elevations , accounted for 50.41 % of all genes detected by geochip ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
in contrast , unique genes , defined as genes detected only in one elevation , accounted for only 20.98 % of all detected genes ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
the number of unique genes increased with elevations , which was in accordance with the increasing ratio of the unique gene number to the detected gene number at each elevation ( supplementary table s5 ) .
the percentage of shared genes between different elevations was the highest between 3600 and 3800 m asl ( 65.47 %) , which was the shortest in distance ( supplementary table s6 ) .
in contrast , it was the lowest between 3200 and 3800 m asl ( 54.57 %) , which was the highest in distance .
a negative correlation between distance and the number of shared genes ( r = - 0.71 , p < 0.001 ) ( supplementary figure s2 ) was detected .
the linkage of overall microbial functional gene structure and environmental variables we performed simple mantel tests to examine major factors linking to overall microbial functional gene structure .
the results showed that elevation was the most important factor in affecting functional genes structure ( table 2 ) .
to discriminate whether elevational influence is attributable to environmental variables , we performed cca to determine the linkage between microbial functional gene structure and environmental variables ( supplementary figure s3 ) .
seven environmental variables ( t , ph , no3 - , tp10 - 20cm , aboveground vegetation biomass , vegetation species number and vegetation diversity ) , were identified to have a significant influence on functional microbial structure , which was also verified by mantel tests ( p < 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) .
the vpa showed that these seven variables explained a total of 82.64 % variations of functional gene structure ( supplementary figure s4 ) .

bsignificance of differences : *** p < 0.001 , ** p < 0.010 , * p < 0.050 .
carbon cycling genes almost all of carbon cycling genes ( supplementary figure s5 ) increased in relative abundance with elevations .
however , there are certain exceptions .
the relative abundances of pula genes ( encoding extracellular polyurethane / esterase ) ( supplementary figure s5a ) , and rubisco genes ( encoding ribulose - 1 , 5 - bisphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase ) were lowest at the 3800 m site ( supplementary figure s5b ) .
we found that soil moisture has a strong positive correlation with mcra genes ( encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase subunit a , r = 0.75 , p = 0.010 ) and pmoa genes ( encoding particulate methane monooxygenase a , r = 0.84 , p = 0.001 ) ( figures 2a,b ) .
in addition , the important role of microbes on co2 flux was verified by mantel tests ( r = 0.58 , p < 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
in - depth investigation showed that co2 flux negatively correlated with aclb genes ( encoding atp citrate lyase involved in reductive tca cycle , r = - 0.83 , p = 0.009 ) , codh genes ( encoding carbon monoxide dehydrogenase involved in biosynthesis of acetyl - coa , r = - 0.89 , p = 0.001 ) and pcc genes ( involved in hydroxypropionate pathways , r = - 0.77 , p = 0.022 ) ( figures 2c - e ) .
figure 2 correlations between soil moisture and the relative abundance of mcra ( a ) and pmoa ( b ) , co2 flux and the relative abundance of aclb ( c ) , codh ( d ) and pcc ( e ) , nitrate and the relative abundance of amoa drived from ammonia - oxidizing archaea ( f ) and bacteria ( g ) and the total organic carbon measured at 10 - 20 cm depth and the relative abundance of mer ( h ) .
pearson correlation and tdist tests were used to calculate r and p values , respectively .
to identify major carbon fixation bacteria responsible for co2 flux , we performed a molecular ecological network analysis with carbon fixation genes and environmental variables .
the resulting network showed typical topological features of scale - free ( power law = 0.92 ) , small world ( average path distance = 3.49 ) , modular ( modularity = 0.64 ) and hierarchical ( average clustering coefficient = 0.21 ) ( supplementary table s7 ) .
notably , soil co2 flux showed correlations with rubisco genes derived from roseovarius , synechococcus , and nakamurella multipartita , and pcc genes derived from mycobacterium and comamonas testosteroni ( figure 3a ) .

nitrogen cycling genes almost all of nitrogen cycling genes increased in relative abundances with elevations , except that nosz genes ( encoding nitrous oxide reductase ) were similar across four elevations ( supplementary figure s6 ) .
no3 - positively correlated with amoa ( encoding active site polypeptide of the ammonia monooxygenase ) - aoa ( ammonia - oxidizing archaea ; r = 0.51 , p = 0.087 ) but negatively correlated with amoa - aob ( ammonia - oxidizing bacteria ; r = - 0.60 , p = 0.044 ) ( figures 2f,g ) .
in addition , no3 - positively correlated with a number of nitrogen cycling genes , such as amoa genes ( r = 0.57 , p = 0.051 ) , nirk / s genes ( encoding a nitrite reductase , r > 0.58 , p < 0.048 ) , napa genes ( encoding periplasmic nitrate reductase , r = 0.68 , p = 0.024 ) and gdh genes ( encoding glutamate dehydrogenase , r = 0.60 , p = 0.046 ) , and ammonia ( nh4 +) negatively correlated with nirk / s genes ( r < - 0.58 , p < 0.046 ) ( supplementary table s8 ) .
the ratio of nirk to nirs gene abundances positively correlated with nh4 + ( r = 0.59 , p = 0.046 ) and negatively correlated with moisture ( r = - 0.46 , p = 0.123 ) ( supplementary table s8 ) .
n2o flux was positively correlated with nosz gene derived from roseobacter denitrificans och 114 ( r = 0.71 , p = 0.034 ) and another two probes derived from uncultured bacteria ( r > 0.69 , p < 0.036 ) ( supplementary table s9 ) , and negatively correlated with norb gene derived from moraxella catarrhalis ( r = - 0.88 , p = 0.002 ) ( supplementary table s9 ) .
the association network with amoa genes and environmental variables showed topological features of scale - free , small world , modular and hierarchical ( supplementary table s7 ) .
notably , there was a positive correlation between n2o and amoa gene derived from pseudomonas ( figure 3b ) , which was abundant in tibet ( zhang et al. , 2007 ; tong et al. , 2008 ) .
in addition , soil ph was negatively correlated with amoa gene derived from aurantimonas .
stress response genes induced under cold environment , cold shock proteins help maintain cell phenotypes and viabilities through preventing damage of ice crystal ( willimsky et al. , 1992 ) .
in our study , increased cold shock genes of cspa and cspb ( encoding cold shock proteins ) along the altitudinal gradient suggested stronger capability of microorganisms in acclimation of cold environments ( supplementary figure s7a ) .
in addition , we found that soil temperature correlated with cspa genes ( r = - 0.74 , p = 0.010 ) and cspb genes ( r = - 0.90 , p < 0.001 ) ( supplementary table s8 ) .
relative abundances of genes associated with oxygen limitation , radiation stress and mercury generally increased with elevations ( supplementary figures s7b,c,e ) , such as arca genes ( encoding the cytosolic response regulator ) and arcb genes ( encoding the membrane - bound senor kinase ) derived from shewanella , vibrio , nitrosospira , and oxalobacter .
in contrast , genes associated with glucose limitation were similar in relative abundances ( supplementary figure s7d ) .
we found that toc10 - 20 cm was positively correlated with mer genes encoding a mercury - resist operon ( r = 0.85 , p = 0.001 ) ( figure 2h ) .
soil ph was negatively correlated with mer ( r = - 0.78 , p = 0.001 ) and merg ( r = - 0.64 , p = 0.021 ) ( supplementary table s8 ) .
discussion the effect of grazing on microbial biogeographic pattern it has been shown that soil microbial biomass , taxonomic compositions , and bacterial diversities differed along the altitudinal gradient ( faoro et al. , 2010 ; fu et al. , 2012 ) .
our studies provided evidence that functional gene structures of soil microbial communities also differed along the altitudinal gradient ( supplementary table s3 ) .
we observed increased soil moisture , tn10 - 20 cm and no3 - at higher elevations ( table 1 ) , which could provide more electron acceptors and available substrates to stimulate elemental cycling ( xu et al. , 2014 ) .
in addition , it has been shown that water - extractable organic carbon , microbial biomass carbon , and carbon storage increased with elevations ( pabst et al. , 2013 ; tsui et al. , 2013 ) .
therefore , the increased pattern of microbial diversity could mainly be attributed to the more resources at higher elevations .
the diversity patterns of microbial communities in this study differed from those in enclosed grasslands without livestock grazing using the same data analysis method ( yang et al. , 2014 ) .
we found microbial functional diversity increased with elevations ( supplementary table s2 ) .
however , microbial functional diversity showed a humpback shape in enclosed grasslands , suggesting that land uses imposed a significant impact on soil microbial communities .
environmental stresses may not contribute to differences in microbial biogeographic patterns , as genes associated with cold shock also increased with elevations in the enclosed grassland .
rather , we speculate that differences in soil nutrient inputs could lead to differences in microbial communities .
animal excreta from livestock provide available nitrogen to vegetation and microbial communities and consequently stimulate nitrogen cycling ( kohler et al. , 2005 ; ambus et al. , 2007 ) .
aboveground vegetation grazed by livestock could reduce litter input to soil , which ameliorates nitrogen limitation for microbial communities because vegetation c / n ratios are higher .
these two reasons could collectively stimulate substrate availability to soil microbial communities in pastures .
livestock grazing could result in more homogenous soil environments because of soil compaction induced by trampling of livestock ( zhao et al. , 2007 ) .
similarly , we found that variations of environmental variables in grazing sites , such as nh4 + ( 1.34 - 2.89 mg kg - 1 ) , soil inorganic nitrogen ( sin ; 2.88 - 3.62 mg kg - 1 ) and vegetation species numbers ( 19.46 - 26.26 ) , were smaller than variations of nh4 + ( 1.5 - 3.7 mg kg - 1 ) , sin ( 2.88 - 4.63 mg kg - 1 ) and vegetation species numbers ( 13.67 - 25.00 ) in enclosed grasslands ( table 1 ) .
at the functional gene level , the range of shannon diversities ( 10.27 - 10.58 ) was less than half of previous observations at the enclosed grassland ( 9.95 - 10.65 ) ( yang et al. , 2014 ) , suggesting the important role of livestock grazing on microbial diversities .
however , we could not exclude the possibility that some functional genes in soils might not be represented on geochip , which would lead to underestimation of microbial functional diversities ( zhou et al. , 2015a ) .
notably , geochip is also limited in discovering novel genes in the environment and subjected to errors derived from cross hybridization .
field simulation studies showed that soils exposed to warmer climates decreased functional diversities ( yue et al. , 2015 ) .
in addition , warming decreased microbial diversities under normal precipitation conditions ( sheik et al. , 2011 ) .
it is likely that dominant species would be more advantageous while rare species would extinct , resulting in decreased diversities ( fussmann et al. , 2014 ) .
alternatively but not exclusively , warming might increase nutrient availability ( rinnan et al. , 2008 ) .
since our results show that microbial functional diversities are higher in colder environments , we predict that warming in tibetan pastures will decrease microbial functional diversities and shift soil carbon and nitrogen cycling .
however , given strong metabolic flexibility and adaptability of soil microbial communities ( bardgett and van der putten , 2014 ) , it remains to be an open question whether warming will exert permanent effects on functional potentials of microbial communities and other parts of the biosphere ( lau and lennon , 2011 ) .
linkages between vegetation and microbial communities unique vegetation species number increased with elevations between 1000 and 4000 m asl in the tibetan plateau ( vetaas and grytnes , 2002 ) .
similarly , we found that numbers of unique genes , which are genes detected only at one elevation , increased with elevations ( supplementary table s5 ) .
the co - occurrence diversification of vegetation and microbes at higher elevations can be attributed to stronger environmental selective forces ( hanson et al. , 2012 ) , which was supported by revealing seven environmental variables explaining a total of 82.64 % variations of functional gene structure ( supplementary figure s4 ) and strong correlation between environmental variables and functional genes ( table 2 ) .
in contrast , evolutionary or ecological drift might play a minor role .
the tight linkages between vegetation and microbial communities , as indicated by cca ( supplementary figure s3 ) and mantel tests ( table 2 ) , can result from complex interactions between them .
vegetation root exudates and litter input could offer diverse organic resources to influence soil microbial communities ( wardle et al. , 2004 ; chu et al. , 2014 ) , while microbial communities provide feedbacks to vegetation through altering nutrient availability ( lau and lennon , 2011 ) .
in this study , aboveground vegetation biomass correlated with microbial community structures ( r = 0.52 , p < 0.010 ) ( table 2 ) , which has been observed elsewhere ( yang et al. , 2013 ; yue et al. , 2015 ) .
in contrast , vegetation diversity was not correlated with microbial community structures ( r = 0.14 , p > 0.050 ) ( table 2 ) , which could be explained by recent observations that vegetation diversity could predict beta but not alpha diversity of microbial communities in grasslands ( prober et al. , 2015 ) .
more aboveground vegetation biomass confers more litter and root exudate to soil , which consequently changes c / n ratio of substrates for microbial utilization and alters microbial communities .
c cycling genes negative correlations between co2 flux and carbon fixation genes ( figures 2c - e ) suggested that changes in co2 flux might be attributed to anaerobic acetyl - coa pathway , reverse tca cycle and hydroxypropionate pathways .
in contrast , calvin - benson - bassham cycle , as indicated by microbial rubisco genes encoding an enzyme coupling oxygenolysis of ribulose - 1 , 5 - bisphophate and co2 reduction , were similar along the altitudinal gradient .
however , this observation does not refute the possibility that rubisco genes play a substantial role in soil co2 flux .
recently , microbial rubisco gene abundance and enzyme activities were shown to be high in tibetan grasslands ( guo et al. , 2015 ) .
in addition , we have identified correlations between co2 flux and rubisco genes derived from roseovarius , synechococcus , and n. multipartita by the association network analysis .
therefore , individual functional species possessing rubisco genes might contribute to variations of co2 flux , despite the lack of overall changes in total abundance of rubisco genes .
higher soil moisture strengthens substrate utilization of microbial communities ( chen et al. , 2007 ) .
furthermore , toc , readily mineralizable carbon , water - soluble organic carbon and reducing sugar carbon increase when soil water - holding capability varies in 20 - 60 % ( hassan et al. , 2015 ) , owing to increase in microbial accessibility to soluble nutrients , especially autotrophic carbon , ammonia and nitrate ( bell et al. , 2008 ; van horn et al. , 2014 ) .
accordingly , we observed an increase of carbon degradation genes ( supplementary figure s5a ) .
soil moisture also has a strong effect on net soil ch4 uptake rate , which is the balance between ch4 production and oxidation ( shrestha et al. , 2012 ) .
as ch4 production and oxidation are two tightly intertwined processes ( inagaki et al. , 2004 ) , it is no surprise to note an increase in relative abundances of both ch4 production and oxidation genes with elevations and soil moisture ( supplementary figure s5c ) .
similarly , more ch4 and available substrates induced by soil moisture can stimulate microbial methanotrophs as well as ch4 oxidation gene abundance ( shrestha et al. , 2012 ) .
conversely , ch4 oxidation stimulates the growth of methanogenic bacteria by supplying energy ( hoehler et al. , 1994 ) .
n cycling genes many studies used nirs and ( or ) nirk genes as functional markers to profile diversities or structures of denitrifiers because nitrite reductase is the rate - limiting step of denitrification ( braker et al. , 1998 ; liu et al. , 2003 ) .
the ratio of nirk to nirs gene abundance negatively and positively correlated with soil moisture ( r = - 0.46 , p = 0.123 ) and nh4 + ( r = 0.59 , p = 0.046 ) , respectively ( supplementary table s8 ) , which was consistent with a recent finding that water logging decreased the nirk / nirs ratio ( yoshida et al. , 2009 ) .
in addition , both no3 - and nh4 + are associated with community compositions of nirs - type denitrifiers ( zheng et al. , 2015 ) .
the correlation between amoa and no3 - ( r = 0.57 , p = 0.051 ) has been similarly documented ( ding et al. , 2015 ) .
intriguingly , amoa - aob negatively correlated with no3 - ( r = - 0.60 , p = 0.044 ) and amoa - aoa positively correlated with no3 - ( r = 0.51 , p = 0.087 ) ( figures 2f,g ) , which could be attributed to different roles of ammonia monooxygenase , physiological pathways and electron transport mechanisms in aoa and aob ( hatzenpichler , 2012 ) .
consistently , it was shown in groundwater that nitrate positively correlated with copy numbers of amoa - aoa and negatively correlated with those of amoa - aob ( qin et al. , 2014 ) .
the positive correlations between no3 - and hzo and napa genes provide further evidence to the finding that no3 - can regulate the anammox and dissimilarity nitrate reduction processes ( silver et al. , 2001 ; trimmer et al. , 2005 ) .
heavy metal livestock manure was one of heavy metal sources to soil , including mercury ( nicholson et al. , 2003 ; wang et al. , 2016 ) .
at higher elevations , decreased turnover rate of soil organic carbon could accelerate mercury accumulation and cold temperature could decrease mercury evasion , causing the increasing abundance of mer genes ( zhou et al. , 2015b ) .
consistently , mer gene positively correlated with toc10 - 20 cm ( r = 0.85 , p = 0.001 ) ( figure 2h ) , which might be attributed to mercury affinity to organic matter ( zhou et al. , 2015b ) .
in addition , the negative correlations between ph and mer ( r = - 0.78 , p = 0.001 ) and merg ( r = - 0.64 , p = 0.021 ) genes indicated that soil acidification constrained hg volatilization ( supplementary table s8 ) .
conclusion this study represents an in - depth investigation of soil microbial functional gene profiles in an alpine pasture , based on geochip .
compared to enclosed grassland , stronger elevation - decay relationships of microbial functional genes were detected , which could be ascribed to strong environment selection in the alpine environment. by focusing on microbial functional genes , our study provides valuable insights for understanding microbe - mediated mechanisms of soil biogeochemical cycling .

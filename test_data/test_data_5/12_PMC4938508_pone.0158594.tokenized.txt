intrinsically disordered regions ( idrs ) are peculiar stretches of amino acids that lack stable conformations in solution .
intrinsic disorder containing proteins ( idp ) are defined by the presence of at least one large idr and have been linked to multiple cellular processes including cell signaling , dna binding and cancer .
here we used computational analyses and publicly available databases to deepen insight into the prevalence and function of idrs specifically in transmembrane proteins , which are somewhat neglected in most studies .
we found that 50 % of transmembrane proteins have at least one idr of 30 amino acids or more .
interestingly , these domains preferentially localize to the cytoplasmic side especially of multi - pass transmembrane proteins , suggesting that disorder prediction could increase the confidence of topology prediction algorithms .
this was supported by the successful prediction of the topology of the uncharacterized multi - pass transmembrane protein tmem117 , as confirmed experimentally .
pathway analysis indicated that idps are enriched in cell projection and axons and appear to play an important role in cell adhesion , signaling and ion binding .
in addition , we found that idp are enriched in phosphorylation sites , a crucial post translational modification in signal transduction , when compared to fully ordered proteins and to be implicated in more protein - protein interaction events .
accordingly , idps were highly enriched in short protein binding regions called molecular recognition features ( morfs ) .
altogether our analyses strongly support the notion that the transmembrane idps act as hubs in cellular signal events .

introduction functional proteins were often thought of as well - folded molecules with unique three - dimensional structures .
however a significant number of eukaryotic proteins are either entirely disordered or contain domains that are predicted to be disordered , at least in isolation [ 1 ] .
these so - called " intrinsically disordered proteins " ( idps ) or hybrid proteins containing ordered and intrinsically disordered regions ( idrs ) thus do not fit to the " lock and key " hypothesis proposed by emil fischer in 1894 [ 2 ] , highlighting that a stable three - dimensional structure is not a prerequisite for functionality .
over the last 15 years , disordered domains have increasingly intrigued biologists [ 3,4 ] .
idrs / idps have a highly biased amino acid composition , typically with a very low proportion of hydrophobic residues and a strong enrichment in polar and charged residues , which allows their identification using bioinformatics means .
a variety of disorder prediction tools have been developed , and it was observed that some 30 % of the human proteome contains regions of at least 30 consecutive amino acids predicted as disordered .
interestingly the abundance of idrs increases with the complexity of the organism , with very little in archea and bacteria and somewhat more in yeast [ 5 ] .
the structural adaptability of idrs allows them to accommodate multiple and very diverse binding partners .
consistently , they have been reported to be enriched among hub proteins [ 6 ] , signaling pathways [ 7,8 ] , and in particular in the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins [ 9,10 ] .
disorder - promoting amino acids are frequently found in the proximity of phosphorylation sites [ 11 ] , suggesting that they may play a role in the recruitment of regulatory proteins .
several idps play a role of chaperone , helping other proteins to fold and preventing their aggregation during this process [ 12,13 ] .
a major functional characteristic of idrs is thought to be their ability to undergo folding , or fitting , upon contact with a membrane , as observed for alpha - synuclein [ 14,15 ] , or with a partner protein [ 16 ] .
the one - to - many interactions attributed to idrs [ 17 ] would allow idps to be at the center of regulatory and signaling pathways [ 8 ] .
this mechanism of induced folding allows different partners to interact , sequentially , onto the same intrinsically disordered region of a protein [ 18,19 ] , but can also play an important regulatory function [ 20 ] .
there is still a debate concerning the binding mode of idrs to their partners [ 21 ]. two main mechanisms have been proposed : induced fit , where the idr folds in a specific manner upon ligand binding , or conformational selection where the very dynamic idrs adopt transiently a multitude of structures , and a specific ligand binds only to a specific subpopulation [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
changes in idrs structural properties can play a role in the regulation of protein activity .
a recent study showed that phosphorylation of two threonine residues result in the folding of a disordered linker in 4e - bp2 , which drastically reduces its affinity for eif4e and thus influencing translation initiation [ 24 ] .
in transmembrane proteins , idrs are also involved in regulating protein activity .
the cytoplasmic domain of e - cadherin , a single - pass transmembrane protein involved in homophilic cell - cell adhesion , was shown experimentally to be unstructured when unbound [ 25 ] and to fold after binding beta - catenin [ 26 ] .
it was proposed that this type of interaction allows a fine tuning of the binding strength , through local structural changes caused by posttranslational modification .
similarly , the intrinsically disordered r domain of cftr [ 27 ] , a c - amp dependent chloride channel , has been recently shown to interact with multiple partners depending on its phosphorylation state , illustrating its ability to act as a hub [ 28 ] .
these observations demonstrate that idrs can play a crucial role in the regulation of transmembrane protein function and thus we decided to focus on the peculiarities of intrinsic disorder in transmembrane proteins at the proteome level .
the ability of prediction tools that were trained on soluble proteins to predict intrinsic disorder in transmembrane proteins were shown to also form accurate prediction on membrane proteins [ 29,30 ] .
previous studies investigating the prevalence of idrs in transmembrane proteins did not address biological relevance but found a significant enrichment of these domains on the cytoplasmic side of proteins [ 9,10 ] .
our aim was to reassess idrs in membranes proteins using a different set of intrinsic disorder predictors and to gain more insight in the potential function of these domains in transmembrane proteins using publicly available databases and bioinformatic tools .
we also addressed their phosphorylation and protein - protein interaction propensities .
we confirm the biased localization and higher occupancy of idrs in the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins .
consistent with findings on soluble proteins , this correlated with an enrichment of proteins involved in cell signaling .
furthermore , transmembrane idps were found to have more phosphorylated residues and to interact with more partners than fully ordered transmembrane proteins , a peculiarity that could be attributed to their disordered domains .
material and methods dataset assembly the full amino acid sequences of all the human transmembrane proteins were retrieved from the uniprot kb knowledge database ( release 2013 _ 11 ) .
the analysis focused on a selection of all the annotated proteins regrouped under the << integral to membrane >> gene ontology .
the final dataset consists of 5316 proteins , about a fourth of the complete homo sapiens proteome ( 20 204 proteins ) .
we found that there were 2293 single - pass ( 43.1 % of the total ) , 2752 ( 51 , 8 %) multi - pass and 271 ( 5.1 %) unannotated proteins .
disorder and morfs prediction initial search for intrinsically disordered domains was performed using several prediction tools : iupred ( 25 ) , disopred2 ( 5 ) , foldindex ( 24 ) , topidp ( 26 ) , pondr - vl3 , pondr - vlxt ( 27 ) , pondr - vsl2 ( 28 ) and pondr - fit ( 29 ) .
iupred is a predictor based solely on a protein amino acid sequence that calculates the pairwise inter - residues interaction energy of a protein and estimates disorder propensity .
similarly , foldindex calculates a disorder score according to the charge and hydropathy ratios of the protein sequence .
topidp utilises a specific amino acid scale defining its disorder propensity .
disopred2 is based on a support vector machine for the order / disorder binary classification .
finally , the pondr series uses artificial neural network to predict the disorder propensity of a protein sequence .
for the functional analysis , we used the list of idps predicted by pondr - fit , but most of the results were confirmed using idps predicted by iupred and disopred2 .
molecular recognition features were predicted using morfpred [ 31 ] .
topology information for each idp we searched for the topo _ dom extracellular / cytoplasmic feature to attribute to each idr its localization according to the membrane topology .
out of the 5316 total transmembrane proteins , 2996 ( 56.36 %) were annotated in uniprotkb ( 65.4 % of the single - pass and 54.4 % of the multi - pass transmembrane proteins ) .
goterm analysis goterm analysis was conducted using david [ 32 ],[ 33 ] , an online resource allowing the clustering and classification of proteins according to their goterm .
we used as a background the complete dataset of transmembrane proteins , and compared the goterm clustering of the fully folded protein dataset to the idp dataset .
protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites were obtained using phosphosite [ 34 ] .
we summed all ptm reported for each protein , without setting any reproducibility threshold , in both fop and idp datasets .
protein - protein interactions imex [ 35 ] , an non - redundant database for protein - protein interaction was used to find the interaction partners of each protein in the fully folded protein and idp datasets .
the database consist of binaries interactions with a bait and a prey .
we looked for each proteins the number of unique interaction with every other protein , either as a bait or as a prey .
to confirm what we obtained with imex , a similar approach was used with another database for protein - protein interaction called hippie [ 36 ] .

results and discussion computational analysis of the abundance of intrinsic disorder in human membrane proteins as for many genome - or proteome - wide studies , membrane proteins are often excluded or under represented .
our aim here was to focus specifically on membrane proteins .
our initial dataset consisted of 5316 manually annotated human transmembrane proteins in the uniprotkb database ( release 2013 _ 11 ) .
to predict the presence of disordered domains , we made use of 8 available disorder prediction tools : foldindex [ 37 ] , iupred [ 38 ] , disopred2 [ 5 ] , topidp [ 39 ] , pondr - vl3 , pondr - vlxt [ 40 ] , pondr - vsl2 [ 41 ] and pondr - fit [ 42 ] .
pondr - fit is the most recent tool and is in fact a meta - predictor , integrating most of the available predictors .
we considered a protein as an idp if it contained at least one stretch of 30 or more consecutive amino acids predicted as disordered .
somewhat surprisingly , there was significant divergence between the outputs of the predictors ( fig 1a , table 1 ) .
indeed topidp predicted that 92 % of transmembrane proteins are idps , while iupred predicted only 36 % ( fig 1a ) .
an illustrative example is the wnt co - receptor lrp6 , involved in the binding of wnt proteins at the cell surface .
iupred and pondr - fit predict the presence of one large intrinsically disordered domain in the cytosolic side , which was not detected by disopred2 for instance ( fig 1b and 1c ) .
in contrast , all 3 predictors agreed that toll - like receptor 1 , involved in innate immune responses , is a protein with low disorder ( fig 1d ) .

we next analyzed the overlap between the idp datasets obtained by each predictor .
upon comparison , we found that the smallest datasets were almost entirely included in the larger one .
we therefore expressed overlaps as a percentage of the smallest dataset .
thus 87.09 % of idps found with pondr - fit were also found with disopred2 , 99.95 % of those found by iupred where found with topidp ( table 1 ) .
this matryoshka doll - like structure between the datasets shows that although there are potentially sensitivity differences between each predictor , they still possess a strong overlap .
we have chosen to use the meta - predictor pondr - fit to generate our idp dataset .
this program is a state of the art disorder meta - predictor that aggregate the prediction of all the previously cited software to deliver a disorder score between 0 and 1 for each amino acid .
importantly the same qualitative conclusions were reached when using the most stringent predictor iupred and disopred2. of 5,316 transmembrane proteins , pondr - fit predicted 2'610 ( 49.1 %) as idps , the remaining 50.9 % being defined as fully ordered proteins ( or fully folded protein ) ( fig 1a , s1 dataset ) .
using disopred2 , 35.2 % of the total proteome was predicted to have a least one region longer than 30 amino acids predicted as disordered [ 5 ] .
we predicted with disopred2 that 57.36 % of the human transmembrane proteins had at least one idr of minimum 30 amino acids .
it thus appears that intrinsically disordered domains are significantly more abundant in membrane proteins when compared to the full proteome .
it is worth noting that idps are on average considerably larger , with a median size of 534 amino acids , than fully folded proteins , which have a median size of 325 amino acids ( fig 1e ) .
amino acid composition we next analyzed the amino acid composition of idps vs. fully folded proteins .
even when analyzing the full length proteins , idps were enriched in the disorder promoting amino acid proline ( p ) , in the charged residues glutamic acid ( e ) , aspartic acid ( d ) and arginine ( r ) , as well as in glutamine ( q ) and serine ( s ) .
fully folded proteins were enriched in hydrophobic or aromatic residues like phenylalanine ( f ) , leucine ( l ) , isoleucine ( i ) , tyrosine ( y ) and tryptophan ( w ) ( fig 2a ) .
while hallmarks of transmembrane proteins , these hydrophobic residues also promote order , possibly by triggering a hydrophobic collapse during folding .
this compositional bias was even more pronounced when analyzing the amino acid composition of the idrs specifically .
we found a 66 % higher abundance of proline , 50.2 % of serine and 43.5 % of glutamic acid when compared to their abundance in the full , 5316 transmembrane protein dataset ( fig 2b ) .
the striking abundance of proline residues in idrs could be attributed to poly - prolines stretches , crucial for the binding of proteins with sh3 domains and for signal transduction [ 43 ] .
moreover , we observed that serine is the only residue highly enriched in idr that can be phosphorylated .
the propensity of serine residues in idrs to be phosphorylated will be analyzed below .
finally , lysine are poorly enriched in transmembrane protein idps and idrs ( 1 % and 12 % respectively ) , even if this residue has always been described as a major component of disordered regions [ 44 ] .

( a ) relative amino - acids composition of idps .
the enrichment is calculated by the formula : 100 - (% aa in idp * 100 /% aa in total dataset ) .
( b ) relative amino - acids composition of idrs .
the enrichment is calculated by the formula : 100 - (% aa in idr * 100 /% aa in total dataset ) .
for ( a ) and ( b ) we normalized to the percentage of amino acid contained in the complete transmembrane proteins dataset .
localization , length and topology of disordered regions single - pass and multi - pass proteins are known to have very different types of functions , and thus potentially a different requirement for disordered domains .
we therefore analyzed the relative frequency of intrinsically disordered regions in these two types of membrane proteins .
based on the uniprot annotations , 51.8 % of our membrane protein dataset are multi - pass and 43.1 % single - pass membrane proteins , with 5.1 % having no annotation ( fig 3a ). of note , 22.3 % of the multi - pass fully folded proteins have extracellular and intracellular domains smaller than 30 amino acids .
since these can , by our definition , not be classified as idps , we removed them from this analysis .
on the remaining transmembrane proteins , we found a similar frequency of intrinsically disordered regions for single - pass ( 58.4 %) and multi - pass ( 51.3 %) transmembrane proteins ( fig 3a ) .

( f ) zdhhc8 ( uniprotid : q9ulc8 ) is a multi - pass transmembrane protein with a long predicted idr in the cytoplasmic side .
for ( c ) and ( d ) , the blue dots represent the average disorder score using pondr - fit , iupred and disopred2 prediction tools and the error bars the standard error .
the blue lane shows the position of the transmembrane domain and the grey area the cytoplasmic c - terminal part of the protein .
we next analyzed the topological localization of the intrinsically disordered regions ; i.e. , cytoplasmic or extracellular / luminal .
in uniprot , 56 % of the membrane proteins have an annotated topology , corresponding to 52 % of the multi - pass and 76 % of single - pass transmembrane proteins .
interestingly , 63 % of the intrinsically disordered regions predicted in single - pass proteins mapped to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane , and this percentage was even higher , 81 % ( 669 out of 826 ) , for multi - pass membrane proteins ( fig 3b ) .
this observation held true when using both iupred and disopred2 ( s1 fig ) molecular recognition features ( morfs ) are short amino acid sequences that have been described to fold upon ligand binding [ 45 ] .
these domains are usually observed within idrs and display a wide range of induced folding , into alpha - helices or beta - sheet [ 45 ][ 46 ] .
several predictors have been developed to detect these domains , and we used morfpred [ 31 ] on our complete dataset .
confirming the previously observed association of morfs with intrinsically disordered domains , we saw a striking enrichment of morfs in idps ( 550 morfs , 3.02 morfs per protein ) compared to fully folded proteins ( 83 morfs , 1.17 morfs per protein ) ( fig 3c ) .
consistent with a preference for the cytosolic localization of idrs , morfs also show a similar localization with 83.6 % of them being cytoplasmic ( fig 3d ) , in agreement with a previous analysis [ 47 ] .
two illustrative examples of this topological preference are bmp receptor 2 ( bmpr2 ) and the palmitoyl - transferase enzyme dhhc8 .
as expected , the n - terminal extracellular ligand - binding domain and the cytoplasmic kinase domain of bmpr2 are predicted to be ordered .
however a very long - 500 residue - disordered domain is found at the c - terminus , with 9 predicted morfs ( fig 3e ) .
dhhc8 spans the membrane 4 times , its dhhc motif between helices 2 and 3 is known to localize to the cytoplasm [ 48 ] .
a very long and highly disordered domain is predicted in the cytoplasmic c - terminus ( fig 3f ) .
dhhc8 is one of the 23 human dhhc , a protein family of palmitoyl - transferases. of these , 10 members are predicted to have long cytosolic disordered domains .
it is tempting to speculate that these domains provide substrate specificity to the enzymes or regulate their activity .
next we analyzed the length of intrinsically disordered regions .
in single - pass membrane proteins , the average length (=~ 60 - 70 residues ) of idrs was similar in the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains ( fig 4a ) .
in percentage of the total length , unfoldedness however covered larger parts of the cytoplasmic domains ( fig 4b ) .
to illustrate this , we plotted the percent occupancy of a given predicted disordered regions either as an average or as a distribution .
on average , the disordered regions covered 61 % of the cytoplasmic domain ( fig 4b ) , with a significant proportion of proteins for which the entire cytoplasmic domain was predicted as disordered ( fig 4c ) , as for zdhhc8 .

in multi - pass membrane proteins , cytoplasmic idrs were significantly longer (=~ 70 residues ) than those found extracellularly (=~ 40 residues ) ( fig 4d ) .
on average idrs covered only 30 % of the cytoplasmic domain ( fig 4e and 4f ) .
using disorder to predict the topology of transmembrane proteins in the absence of a signal sequence , which defines the initial orientation of a membrane protein with respect to the er membrane , the topology of a membrane protein , in particular multi - spanning membrane proteins , are difficult to predict and multiple alternative options generally exist .
a useful indication of topology is the " inside positive " rule , by which positively charged residues at the boundaries of transmembrane domains will preferentially localize to the cytoplasm [ 49 ] .
considering the strong preference of idrs and morfs for the cytosolic side of multi - pass membrane proteins , we tested whether disorder information could assist the topology prediction of membrane proteins .
to test this possibility , we chose an uncharacterized multi - pass membrane protein : tmem117 , of 60 kda with 8 predicted transmembrane domains .
disorder prediction of tmem117 was performed with all 8 disorder predictors which all indicate the presence of two intrinsically disordered domains , of 50 and 34 amino acids long respectively according to pondr - fit , at the c - terminus ( fig 5a ) .
however , no morfs were predicted for tmem117 .
our prediction would thus be that the c - terminus of tmem117 resides in the cytosol .
to determine experimentally the protein topology , we generated tmem117 expression constructs harboring either a v5 tag or a gfp fusion at the c - terminus .

= mock transfected controls .
we first probed by immunofluorescence microscopy the protein localization , and observed a clear plasma membrane staining in hela cells transfected with tmem117 - v5 ( fig 5b ) .
the plasma membrane localization of the protein was also confirmed by biotinylation of surface protein and subsequent streptavidin pulldown , using gapdh as a cytoplasmic negative control and transferrin receptor as a surface positive control ( fig 5c ) .
to test experimentally our topology prediction , we first made use of the presence of two n - glycosylation consensus sites , at n353 and n371 , both present in the loop separating tmd7 and tmd8 .
modification of these sites in the er can only occur if our predicted topology is correct .
expression of tmem117 - v5 in hela cells led to the appearance of a smeared =~ 70 kda band on western blots , typical of a glycosylated protein ( fig 5c ) .
glycosylation and modification of the n - linked glycans by golgi enzymes was confirmed by treatment with n - glycosidase f and endoglycosidase h ( endo h ) respectively : a major decrease in apparent molecular weight was observed upon removal of the sugars , while the 70 kda smear was insensitive to endo h ( fig 5d ) .
subsequently , we mutated n353 and n371 or n353 / n371 together into alanine and observed by western - blot a significant decrease in the protein molecular weight for both single mutants and a faint expression for the double mutant ( fig 5e ) .
these results confirm that both n353 and n371 are able to be glycosylated and thus that the loop containing the two residues is extracellular .
in addition , glycosylation appears to play a role in tmem117 stability .
as an independent confirmation of the topology , tmem117 - gfp was expressed in hela cells ( fig 5d ) .
cells were subsequently labeled with anti - gfp antibodies under permeabilizing and non - permeabilizing conditions .
the gfp - staining indicated that a significant population of tmem117 was transported to the plasma membrane , similar to the v5 staining ( fig 5f ) .
tmem117 could however only be labeled with anti - gfp antibodies in permeabilized cells , indicating that the gfp moiety was inside the cell ( fig 5f ) .
these results demonstrated that tmem117 c - terminus containing the idrs and the gfp - tag is cytoplasmic , and the glycosylated loop between tm7 and tm8 is extracellular ( fig 5g ) .
thus altogether , we were able to predict the topology of tmem117 using disorder prediction and confirmed it biochemically and by immunofluorescence .
cellular localization and functions of idps to gain insight in the potential role of intrinsically disordered domains in membrane proteins , we used functional network analysis and clustering software .
database for annotation , visualization and integrated discovery ( david ) is a resource allowing the classification and enrichment of a given set of genes according to their annotation [ 33 ] .
we analyzed the idp and fully folded protein datasets probing for localization. with a 50:50 overlap in the early secretory pathway ( er , golgi ) and the lysosomes , a good segregation was observed with disorder containing transmembrane proteins in dendrite membranes , presynaptic membranes and cell projections .
ordered transmembrane proteins were more abundant in peroxysomes and in the inner mitochondria membrane , but interestingly the outer mitochondrial membrane was populated by both idps and fully folded proteins ( fig 6a ) .
this localization is consistent with disordered domain playing an important role in cell signaling and cell - cell contact while enzymatic function requires folded proteins .
the lack of disordered proteins in the inner mitochondria is consistent with their prokaryotic origin , since archea and bacteria were observed to have far less idps than eukaryotic cells [ 5 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0158594.g006 fig 6 cellular localizations and functions of idps .

the enrichment is calculated with the number of proteins in the ordered or disordered dataset compared to the total amount of proteins known to be in this family .
( c ) enrichment of goterm from the molecular function ontology for idps and fully folded proteins .
the enrichment score was calculated by david , an online tool for gene ontology .
( d ) disorder prediction of synaptotagmin 1 ( uniprotid : p21579 ) , a calcium binding protein involved in synaptic vesicles fusion .
( e ) disorder prediction of udp - glucuronosyltranferase 1 - 3 ( uniprotid : p35503 ) , an enzyme involved in the addition of glucoronic acid moieties to various compounds and important in detoxification .
for ( d and e ) the blue dots represent the average disorder score using pondr - fit , iupred and disopred2 prediction tools , and the errors bar the standard error .
the blue lanes show the position of the transmembrane domains .
we next classified our datasets according to protein families , and a strong segregation was observed via this analysis ( fig 6b ) .
for example , the synaptotagmin family has 13 annotated members , all having at least one predicted disordered region longer than 30 amino acids ( fig 6b and 6d ) .
moreover , goterm analysis indicated that the proteins with idrs had a high propensity to play a role in ion binding ( fig 6c ) .
in addition , these proteins were linked to cell adhesion , transcription regulation and cell morphogenesis , which are all molecular functions linked to cell signaling and signal transduction .
inversely ordered transmembrane proteins were mainly observed to be involved in enzymatic reactions such as lipid synthesis and glycosyl transferase activity , scaffolding with tetraspanin proteins and interestingly gpcr signaling ( fig 6c ) .
synaptotagmins are transmembrane calcium binding proteins involved in vesicles fusion in the pre - synaptic axon terminals .
for the proteins from this family , the amino acid stretch between the transmembrane domain and the calcium binding domains ( annotated as c2 domain 1 and 2 on the graph ) is predicted as intrinsically disordered ( fig 6d ) .
also , potassium channels and sodium channels are all predicted to contain disordered domains .
these proteins are mainly present in neurons and more specifically in dendrites and synapse , which explain the strong enrichment for these structures observed in the goterm analysis .
several other protein families are also exclusively present in the idp dataset , with the connexin family or the bcl - 2 family being striking examples .
inversely , some protein families appear to contain only fully ordered proteins , some of which are expected to be enzymes ( fig 6e ) .
disorder , post - translational modifications and protein - protein interactions disordered domains have been linked to signaling and our goterm enrichment analysis confirmed these observations .
post translational modifications ( ptm ) such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination , are important components of signaling networks .
phosphorylation is usually an early event in the transduction of extracellular signals to the cytoplasm following ligand binding .
using phosphosite , a manually curated ptm resource [ 34 ] , we compared the abundance of phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites in idp and ordered transmembrane proteins .
remarkably , 84 % of the idps were annotated as phosphorylated against 64 % in the ordered dataset ( fig 7a ) .
we also observed that the number of phosphorylation sites was more than two times higher ( 8.3 sites per protein ) in idps when compared to ordered transmembrane proteins ( 4 sites ) ( fig 7b ) .
indeed , 18,294 phosphorylation sites mapped on idps , compared to 7,045 on fully folded proteins ( s2a fig ) .
more significantly , we observed that the highly phosphorylated proteins were also disordered , with the vast majority of proteins containing more than 10 phosphorylation sites being intrinsically disordered ( fig 7c ) .
as the number of phosphorylation sites weakly correlated with protein length ( s2b fig ) , we calculated for both fully folded proteins and idps the percentage of phosphorylated amino acids .
even after normalization , there were 20 % more phospho - sites in idps than in fully folded proteins ( s2c fig ) .
this striking difference reinforces the hypothesis that intrinsically disorder domains play an important role in signaling and signal transduction .
additionally , we observed that phosphorylation occurs preferentially on serine in idr , representing 57.9 % of the phosphorylated residues ( s2d fig ) .
this result correlates well with the strong enrichment of serine discussed in fig 2 and previously reported [ 50,51 ][ 52 ] , and could indicate that serine phosphorylation ( ps ) is a potential regulator of idr function .
however , and somewhat unexpectedly , we observed that 72.7 % of the phosphorylation sites were localized outside of predicted idrs ( fig 7d ) .
thus it appeared that phosphorylation sites in transmembrane proteins tend to be excluded from idrs .
a similar observation was made with ubiquitination , with 83.8 % of the ubiquitinated sites localized outside of predicted idrs .
even if more idps ( 35.8 %) were annotated as ubiquitinated than fully folded proteins ( 15.2 %) ( fig 7a ) , we did not find any difference in the number of ubiquitination sites per protein in the two datasets ( fig 7b ) .
ubiquitination is involved in the internalization , degradation and recycling of membrane proteins , and is not directly linked to signaling [ 53 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0158594.g007 fig 7 phosphorylation , ubiquitination and protein - protein interactions of idps .
( a ) percentage of fully folded proteins and idps with at least one phosphorylation and / or ubiquitination site .
( b ) average number of phosphorylated and ubiquitinated sites per protein in both fully folded protein and idp datasets .
( c ) frequency distribution of the number of phosphorylation sites per proteins in fully folded proteins and idps .
( d ) percentage of phosphorylated or ubiquitinated site found inside or outside idrs ( od = ordered domain ) .
( e ) percentage of fully folded proteins or idps interacting with at least one known interacting partner .
( f ) average number of interacting partners found for each idps and fully folded proteins .
for ( a , b and c ) we used phosphosite as a ptm database .
for ( e and f ) we searched for binding partners in two different protein - protein interaction databases , imex and hippie .
finally we analyzed the propensity of idps and ordered transmembrane proteins to interact with other proteins .
to this end , we used imex and hippie [ 35 ][ 36 ] , two resources listing experimentally reported interactions between proteins. with imex , we observed that 57.4 % of the idps have at least one known interacting partner , compared to 41.5 % in the ordered dataset ( fig 7e ) .
interestingly , idps also had on average more interacting partners than ordered transmembrane proteins ( fig 7f ) .
indeed , with an average of 4.7 partners , idps have close to twice as many interacting partners as the ordered transmembrane proteins ( 2.81 partners , fig 7f ) .
similar conclusions were reached using another database of protein - protein interactions called hippie .
again , idps showed more protein - protein interactions : 69.8 % of the idps having at least one partner and 9.5 partners on average , while only 53.1 % of the ordered protein had at least one partners , with an average of 6 ( fig 7e and 7f ) .
unfortunately , we were not able to determine whether the interactions are mediated by idrs or by folded domains as the databases generally did not specify the domains involved in the interaction .
concluding remarks based on the meta - predictor of protein disorder pondr - fit , 50 % of transmembrane proteins have at least one stretch of 30 amino acids or more predicted as intrinsically disordered or natively unfolded .
a large majority of idrs localized to the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane proteins , indicating that disorder prediction can be a useful additional tool to predict the topology of multi - pass transmembrane proteins lacking a signal sequence .
disorder analysis for example allowed us to correctly predict the previously uncharacterized topology of the poorly described protein tmem117 .
our analysis indicates that idrs can cover large proportions , on average of 60 % , of the cytosolic domain of single spanning membrane proteins .
idps tend to localize to specific cellular subdomains , such as cell projections , dendrite and presynaptic membranes .
those structures are specific for high order multicellular organism and it could indicate that the idr functions tend to continuously evolve .
indeed , goterm enrichment showed that idps often play a role in ion binding and signal transduction whereas fully folded proteins were usually involved in enzymatic functions and gpcr signaling .
in addition , transmembrane proteins containing idrs shows a higher degree of phosphorylation , a higher number of partner proteins , which would fit the " one - to - many " model of interaction often reported for idps .
finally , idps appeared to localize to special plasma membrane domains , all consistent with a crucial role in signaling between the extracellular environment and the cytoplasm .

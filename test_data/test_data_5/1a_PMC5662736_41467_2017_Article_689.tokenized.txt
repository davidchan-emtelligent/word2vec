autophagy - mediated degradation of synaptic components maintains synaptic homeostasis but also constitutes a mechanism of neurodegeneration .
it is unclear how autophagy of synaptic vesicles and components of presynaptic active zones is regulated .
here , we show that pleckstrin homology containing family member 5 ( plekhg5 ) modulates autophagy of synaptic vesicles in axon terminals of motoneurons via its function as a guanine exchange factor for rab26 , a small gtpase that specifically directs synaptic vesicles to preautophagosomal structures .
plekhg5 gene inactivation in mice results in a late - onset motoneuron disease , characterized by degeneration of axon terminals .
plekhg5 - depleted cultured motoneurons show defective axon growth and impaired autophagy of synaptic vesicles , which can be rescued by constitutively active rab26 .
these findings define a mechanism for regulating autophagy in neurons that specifically targets synaptic vesicles .
disruption of this mechanism may contribute to the pathophysiology of several forms of motoneuron disease .
accumulating evidence suggests that disruption of autophagy is associated with neurodegeneration .
here the authors show that plekhg5 acts as a gef for rab26 , a small gtpase that promotes the autophagy of synaptic vesicles in neurons ; mice lacking plekgh5 develop late - onset motoneuron degeneration .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction in neurons , autophagosome biogenesis predominantly takes places in axon terminals .
newly synthesized autophagosomes mature during retrograde transport to the soma and fuse with lysosomes1 , 2 .
autophagy - mediated degradation of synaptic components is involved in neuronal network remodeling , presynaptic neurotransmission and synaptic pruning at polyinnervated neuromuscular junctions during development , but could also represent a mechanism of neurodegeneration3 - 6 .
selective elimination of axon terminals marks disease onset in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) and loss of synaptic vesicles precedes axon degeneration in sod1 g93a mice7 , indicating that autophagy temporally regulates degradation of synaptic vesicles in axon terminals .
neuron - specific disruption of autophagy by depletion of atg5 or atg7 results in progressive deficits of motor function and neurodegeneration8 , 9 .
modulation of the autophagy pathway modifies disease onset and progression in sod1 g93a mice , which further points to the contribution of autophagy to the pathology of motoneuron disease10 , 11 .
however , the molecular mechanisms that differentially regulate autophagy of synaptic vesicles and components of presynaptic active zones are not known .
here , we show that plekhg5 ( also known as syx , tech or gef720 ) 12 - 14 regulates autophagy of synaptic vesicles in motoneurons via its function as a guanine exchange factor ( gef ) for rab26 , a small gtpase selectively delivering synaptic vesicles into preautophagosomes15 .
plekhg5 is a pleckstrin homology domain containing member of the gef family .
it is predominantly expressed in the nervous system12 , 14 .
while several studies provided evidence for a function of plekhg5 in endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis in zebrafish and mice13 , 16 , its function in the nervous system remained elusive .
mutations in the plekhg5 gene have been associated with different forms of motoneuron diseases such as distal spinal muscular atrophy type iv ( dsma - iv ) 17 , intermediate charcot - marie - tooth disease ( cmt ) 18 , 19 and als20 .
the plekhg5 - mutations identified so far in cmt disease patients produce premature stop codons and are predicted to result in a functional null allele18 , 19 .
in contrast , mutations described to be causative for a recessive lower motoneuron disease with childhood onset lead to an exchange of one amino acid within the pleckstrin homology domain17 , 20 .
to analyze the function of plekhg5 in the nervous system and its involvement in motoneuron disease , we generated plekhg5 - deficient mice using a gene - trap approach21 .
plekhg5 - deficient mice develop a late - onset motoneuron disease , characterized by degeneration of motoneuron axon terminals .
plekhg5 - depleted cultured motoneurons show defective autophagy resulting in accumulation of synaptic vesicles at axon terminals and impaired axon growth .
furthermore , plekhg5 - deficient cells show a reduced activity of rab26 .
in a cell - free system plekhg5 is able to promote gtp exchange of rab26 .
finally , constitutively active rab26 rescues autophagy and axon growth deficits of cultured motoneurons .
our data indicate that the function of plekhg5 as a gef for rab26 is essential for axonal integrity , and that defective autophagy of synaptic vesicles is a pathogenic mechanism in this specific form of motoneuron disease .
results plekhg5 deficiency causes a late - onset motoneuron disease to analyze the cellular function of plekhg5 , we generated plekhg5 - deficient mice using an embryonic stem - cell line harboring a gene - trap cassette within the plekhg5 allele ( fig. 1 ) , ( supplementary fig. 1 ) 21 .
plekhg5 - deficient mice developed normally without obvious disease phenotype up to adulthood .
however , within 24 months after birth 33 out of 100 homozygous mice died , in contrast to 10 out of 100 heterozygous and 5 out of 100 wild - type animals ( fig. 1a ) .
affected mice developed hind - limb paralysis at 15 months ( fig. 1b ) .
a reduction in body weight became apparent in 18 - 24 months old plekhg5 - deficient mice ( fig. 1c ) .
to assess the impact of plekhg5 deficiency on motor performance in more detail , grip strength ( fig. 1e , f ) and rotarod performance ( fig. 1g ) were analyzed in animals of different ages .
these data indicate that the disease starts late at about 12 months of age and progresses from hindlimbs ( fig. 1f ) to forelimbs ( fig. 1e ) .
correlating with reduced grip strength , we observed a loss of motoneurons starting at 12 months as shown by quantification of nissl - stained lumbar spinal cord sections ( fig. 1d , h ) .
this decrease was more prominent in 24 - month - old animals ( fig. 1d ). fig. 1 plekhg5 - deficient mice develop a motoneuron disease with late onset .

mechanical withdrawal thresholds did not differ between genotypes p .
plekhg5 - / - mice showed heat hypersensitivity as compared to control littermates ( plekhg5 +/+ : n = 5 , plekhg5 - / - : n = 5 ; mann - whitney u - test ) we complemented the phenotypic characterization of the motor system with nerve conduction and electromyography studies of the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles ( fig. 1j - l , o ) .
in both muscles we observed a significantly delayed motor latency time ( fig. 1i ) .
the measurements in the gastrocnemius muscles also showed a marked reduction of motor unit potential ( mup ) amplitudes following sciatic nerve - stimulation ( fig. 1j ) .
our analyses revealed elevated single motor unit potentials ( smup ) ( fig. 1k ) and a decrease in motor unit number estimation ( mune ) ( fig. 1l ) in the gastrocnemius muscle , suggestive of sprouting of surviving motoneurons to re - innervate muscle fibers that have been denervated upon motoneuron loss .
this finding is also supported by the observed fiber grouping as shown by succinate dehydrogenase ( sdh ) staining ( fig. 1m ) .
these data are similar to the observed sprouting phenotype reported in sod g93a mice22 .
as previously described for plekhg5 mutant mice19 , we also detected a modest decrease in nerve conduction velocities ( ncvs ) ( fig. 1o ) .
next , we investigated beta - geo reporter - activity of the gene - trap cassette in mutant mice .
in contrast to spinal cord , beta - galactosidase activity was not detected in skeletal muscle ( fig. 1n ) .
therefore , loss of plekhg5 apparently does not affect the skeletal muscle directly , but rather indirectly via denervation and motoneuron loss .
we also assessed the impact of plekhg5 deficiency on sensory and cognitive function .
sensory function was analyzed using the von frey and hargreaves tests ( fig. 1p , q ) .
whereas plekhg5 - deficient mice did not show major changes in mechanical withdrawal thresholds as compared to wild - type littermates ( fig. 1p ) , they displayed hypersensitivity to heat ( fig. 1p ) , indicating that sensory perception is not reduced in these mice .
to address whether plekhg5 deficiency impairs cognitive function , we performed behavioral tests in 12 - 14 - month - old mice ( supplementary fig. 2 ) , before motor disease symptoms occur .
plekhg5 - deficient mice performed similarly in the open field test ( supplementary fig. 2a , b ) indicating that anxiety - related behavior is not altered .
they also did not display differences in object recognition ( supplementary fig. 2c , d ) and fear conditioning ( supplementary fig. 2e , f ) suggestive for unaffected learning and memory .
plekhg5 modulates synaptic vesicle turnover in motoneurons next , we studied neuromuscular junctions ( nmjs ) within the gastrocnemius muscle to analyze whether the degenerative process in plekhg5 - / - mice involves terminal axons ( fig. 2a , c ; supplementary fig. 3 ) .
wild - type animals exhibited regular pretzel - like nmjs at an age of 12 months , as indicated by bungarotoxin ( btx ) staining for labeling of postsynaptic acetylcholine - receptors and synaptophysin immunoreactivity for the corresponding presynaptic compartment ( fig. 2a ; supplementary fig. 3 ) .
in contrast , the presynaptic nerve terminals of plekhg5 - / - mice appeared swollen with accumulations of synaptophysin ( fig. 2a , c ; supplementary fig. 3 ) and neurofilament - h ( nf - h ) ( supplementary fig. 3 ). fig. 2 degradation of neuromuscular junctions in plekhg5 - deficient mice .

c , d quantification of presynaptic area by evaluation of synaptophysin staining and measurement of the widest expansion of presynaptic sites ( three animals per genotype with at least 15 nmjs analyzed per animal ; mean +/ - sem ; two - way anova ; bonferroni post - test ) respiratory failure due to progressive impairment of the neuromuscular system has been reported as a main cause of death in als and the major trigger for premature death in sod1 g93a mice23 .
we therefore investigated whether nmjs within intercostal muscles of plekhg5 - deficient mice also show signs of degeneration .
we observed a phenotype similar as in the gastrocnemius muscle with deformed and swollen axon terminals ( fig. 2b , d ) , indicating that muscles necessary for respiration become denervated which could make a major contribution to premature death .
at the ultrastructural level , axon terminals of plekhg5 - deficient mice were filled with membrane fragments and cytoplasmic inclusions ( fig. 3a - e ) , similar as those observed in patients with als24 , 25 .
strikingly , synaptic vesicles in plekhg5 - / - motoneuron terminals were frequently enlarged , in contrast to synaptic vesicles in wild - type mice , which appeared smaller and of a more uniform size ( fig. 3f - h ) .
furthermore , the organization of actin filaments in axon terminals appeared altered , with more actin fibers in close neighborhood of synaptic vesicles in active zones ( fig. 3f , g ) .
in line with these findings we detected elevated protein levels of several synaptic vesicle markers in sciatic nerve lysates of plekhg5 - / - mice ( fig. 3i , j ) .
the ultrastructural examination of nmjs also revealed axonal swellings in distal axons ( fig. 4a ) .
axons showed a highly disorganized cytoskeleton ( fig. 4b , c ) .
axonal swellings were also frequently detectable in spinal cord and sciatic nerve cross - sections ( fig. 4d - j ) .
in contrast , we detected no axonal swelling in wild - type animals ( fig. 4j ) .
taken together , these data indicate that plekhg5 deficiency results in degradation of axon terminals , but also affects axonal integrity in proximal parts of axons. fig. 3 structural alterations and accumulation of synaptic vesicle proteins in plekhg5 - deficient mice .

the overall morphology and layering of the hippocampus , cerebellum and cortex appeared normal ( supplementary fig. 4 ) .
in contrast to the abnormally swollen appearance of motoneuron terminals with synaptophysin - accumulations , synapses within the brain appeared unaffected in plekhg5 - deficient mice ( supplementary fig. 4 ) .
these observations are in line with our data on normal cognitive function in plekhg5 - deficient mice .
plekhg5 regulates autophagy in motoneurons under physiological conditions damaged organelles are removed from axon terminals by autophagy1 , 2 , 6 .
to assess whether dysregulated autophagy causes the accumulation of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals we examined the autophagic flux in plekhg5 - deficient motoneurons ( fig. 5 ) .
since autophagosomes rapidly fuse with lysosomes , changes in the biogenesis of autophagosomes are hardly detectable under basal conditions26 , 27 .
therefore , cultured motoneurons were transduced with lentiviruses expressing gfp - rfp - lc3 and treated with bafilomycin a1 after 7 days in culture ( fig. 5a - c ) .
bafilomycin a1 blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes resulting in an enrichment of lc3 - ii positive autophagosomes .
since fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes quenches the fluorescence of gfp , rfp positive structures selectively mark autolysosomes , whereas autophagosomes appear positive for both rfp and gfp27 .
under basal conditions we detected no difference in the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in the soma of wild - type and plekhg5 - / - cells .
however , upon treatment with bafilomycin a1 plekhg5 - deficient cells displayed a significantly reduced number of autophagosomes in comparison to wild - type motoneuron somata ( fig. 5a , b ) .
in axons of plekhg5 - / - motoneurons , a reduced number of autophagosomes was detected in both untreated cells and bafilomycin a1 treated cells ( fig. 5a , c ) .
in agreement with previous reports we only identified very few autolysosomes in axons of cultured motoneurons , confirming that full maturation of autophagosomes to lysosomes mostly occurs within or close to the soma1 , 26 .
the number of autolysosomes was not altered indicating that acidification of autolysosomes , as a late step of maturation , was unaffected ( fig. 5a - c ) .
to examine whether plekhg5 deficiency causes impaired axonal transport of autophagosomes , motoneurons were transduced with rfp - gfp - lc3 , and the movement of gfp - lc3 + structures was analyzed ( fig. 5d - f ) .
plekhg5 - / - motoneurons showed a reduced number of autophagosomes moving retrogradely towards the soma ( fig. 5f ) , whereas the relative number of retrogradely moving autophagosomes appeared unaltered ( fig. 5e ; supplementary movie 1 , 2 ) .
reduced protein levels of endogenous lc3 - ii were also biochemically detected in plekhg5 - deficient neurosphere - derived neurons upon treatment with bafilomycin a1 by western blotting ( fig. 5g , h ) .
this reduction of lc3 - ii levels was also apparent in spinal cord extracts of 24 - month - old mice ( fig. 5i , j ) .
taken together , these data emphasize that the biogenesis of autophagosomes is impaired in plekhg5 - deficient motoneurons resulting in a reduced number of retrogradely transported autophagosomes .
the remaining autophagosomes are transported normally. fig. 5 plekhg5 regulates biogenesis of autophagosomes .
a motoneurons of plekhg5 +/+ and plekhg5 - / - mice were transduced with mrfp - gfp - lc3 - expressing lentiviruses and cultured for seven days .
at day seven cells were treated with bafilomycin a1 for four hours or left untreated and the number of autophagosomes ( mrfp + - gfp + - lc3 ) and autolysosomes ( mrfp + - gfp - - lc3 ) was determined in the soma b and axon c ( three independent experiments with 15 cells analyzed in each experiment ; mean +/ - sem ; two - way anova ; bonferroni post - test ) .

western blot images have been cropped for presentation .
full size images are presented in supplementary fig. 7 an essential process for autophagosome formation is the production of phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate ( pi ( 3 ) p ) by phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase class iii at preautophagosomal membranes28 .
pleckstrin homology ( ph ) domains form a conserved family that mediates protein association to inositol lipids like pi ( 3 ) p. we analyzed whether plekhg5 binds to pi ( 3 ) p using extracts from mouse motoneuron - like hybrid cells ( nsc34 ) expressing flag - tagged plekhg5 .
we could precipitate plekhg5 with pi ( 3 ) p - coated beads but not with control beads ( fig. 5m ) suggesting that plekhg5 is able to associate with pi ( 3 ) p at preautophagosomal membranes28 .
for monitoring the fate of plekhg5 upon induction of autophagy , plekhg5 - yfp transfected nsc34 cells were starved for 4 h in hbss and the expression of plekhg5 - yfp was analyzed by western blot ( fig. 5k ) .
in contrast to a marked reduction of full - length plekhg5 - yfp , the signal for smaller protease - resistant yfp - positive fragments increased ( fig. 5k ) .
nutrient deprivation differently affects cell lines and primary neurons .
therefore , we also performed this experiment with cultured motoneurons by replacing enriched motoneuron - media with different media each deprived of specific nutrient components ( fig. 5l ) .
as observed in nsc34 cells , nutrient deprivation resulted in degradation of plekhg5 .
in contrast to overexpressed flag - plekhg5 , endogenous plekhg5 appeared as multiple bands that were differently affected by nutrient deprivation ( fig. 5l ) .
the identity of the bands that were detected by western blot analysis was controlled by sh - rna - mediated knockdown of plekhg5 ( fig. 5l ; supplementary fig. 5a , b ) .
in summary , these experiments suggest that plekhg5 is able to bind pi ( 3 ) p , placing plekhg5 to the inner autophagosomal membrane .
this idea is further supported by the degradation of plekhg5 upon autophagy induction .
fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes results in digestion of proteins in the lumen of the autophagosome including proteins localized to the inner autophagosomal membrane29 .
next , we determined whether impaired autophagy affects survival and / or morphology of plekhg5 - depleted motoneurons in vitro .
plekhg5 - depleted motoneurons grew shorter axons , whereas cell survival and dendritic complexity was not affected ( fig. 6a , b ; supplementary fig. 5 ) .
in order to find out how altered autophagy leads to axonal growth defects , we characterized the morphology of axon terminals in plekhg5 - / - motoneurons .
growth cones of cultured plekhg5 - / - motoneurons appeared atrophic with a significantly smaller size and with dysmorphic densely packed accumulation and clustering of synaptophysin - positive synaptic vesicles leading to a reduced number of f - actin filaments ( fig. 6c , d ) .
we next looked at the expression pattern of rab26 in axons of cultured motoneurons .
rab26 is a small gtpase enriched on synaptic vesicles designated for delivery to preautophagosomal structures15 .
in its gtp - bound form rab26 is an effector of atg16l leading to recruitment of the autophagy machinery to synaptic vesicles .
in plekhg5 - deficient cells rab26 - positive structures accumulate in regions directly at active zones , in contrast to wild - type motoneurons where these structures are found in more proximal areas of axonal growth cones ( fig. 6c , d ). fig. 6 depletion of plekhg5 results in axon growth defects and degeneration of axon terminals in vitro .
a motoneurons were transduced with sh - control or sh - plekhg5 # d lentiviruses or left untreated .
scale bar : 100 microm .
b seven days after sh - rna transduction , knockdown of plekhg5 reduced axon length , whereas dendrite length and number of dendrites were not affected .
each data point represents the mean of one individual experiment with at least 20 cells analyzed .

d quantification of axon terminal size ( n = 15 cells ; unpaired t - test ; two - tailed ) .
e motoneurons were cultured for 7 days and stained for synaptophysin , rab26 and f - actin and imaged by sim microscopy .
axons of plekhg5 - / - motoneurons display synaptophysin positive swellings .
scale bar : 10 microm .
scale bar ( blow up ) : 2 microm to examine these morphological alterations in more depth , we performed sim microscopy ( fig. 6e ) .
these high - resolution images confirmed the data obtained by confocal microscopy providing additional evidence that the number of rab26 - positive vesicles increased , and the actin cytoskeleton disorganized ( fig. 6e ) .
these findings support the in vivo structural analyses demonstrating marked alterations in cytoskeletal structures ( fig. 4b , c ) , which might cause the defect in axon growth .
plekhg5 functions as a gef for rab26 activation of gtpases requires dissociation of protein - bound gdp , an intrinsically slow process that is accelerated by specific gefs30 .
to explore whether plekhg5 regulates the activity of rab26 , neurosphere - derived cortical neurons were transduced with egfp - rab26 and labeled with 32p for 4 h. subsequently , egfp - rab26 was immunoprecipitated and gtp - or gdp - bound rab26 was separated by thin layer chromatography ( tlc ) ( fig. 7a ) , revealing a significantly reduced gtp / gdp ratio ( fig. 7b ) .
next , we asked whether plekhg5 is able to directly act as a gef for rab26 in a cell - free system ( fig. 7c - h ) .
using homogenously purified recombinant proteins we analyzed the ability of plekhg5 to catalyze gdp dissociation of rab26 and observed a marked acceleration of gtp exchange in the presence of the dh - ph ( dbl - homologous - pleckstrin homology ) tandem domain of plekhg5 for rab26 ( fig. 7g , h ) , but not for rab5 , rab27b , or rab33b ( fig. 7d - f ) .
these data demonstrate that plekhg5 acts as a gef for rab26. fig. 7 plekhg5 functions as a gef for rab26 .

g the initial gtp exchange rate of rab26 was evaluated using the first 10 s of each time course .
( mean +/ - sem ; student 's t - test ; two - tailed ) we then followed this line of experiments and tested wild - type and a constitutively active form of rab26 , rab26q123l ( rab26 - ql ) , in cultured motoneurons ( fig. 8 ) .
as previously described , wild - type egfp - rab26 accumulated in vesicles within axons15 .
in plekhg5 - deficien motoneurons , the size of these vesicles was significantly reduced ( fig. 8a , c ) , and the number of egfp - rab26 vesicles was also modestly reduced ( fig. 8a , d ). with constitutive active egfp - rab26 , the number and size of these vesicles normalized and no differences between wild - type and plekhg5 - deficient cells were detectable ( fig. 8a , c , d ) .
in correlation with these findings , egfp - rab26 - ql also fully restored axon growth defects of plekhg5 - deficient motoneurons ( fig. 8b , e ) .
in contrast , egfp - rab26 - ql only moderately enhanced axon growth in wild - type cells ( fig. 8b , e ). fig. 8 expression of constitutively active rab26 rescues axonal growth and autophagy defects in plekhg5 - deficient cells .

i number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes upon expression of flag - rab26 - wt and flag - rab26 - ql ( three independent experiments with 10 cells analyzed in each experiment ; mean +/ - sem ; two - way anova ; bonferroni post - test ) in order to study the effects of constitutive rab26 on axonal autophagy , we constructed lentiviral vectors that simultaneously express rfp - gfp - lc3 and flag - rab26 - wt or flag - rab26 - ql ( fig. 8f , g ) , respectively .
we then quantified the number of rfp - gfp - lc3 positive structures in proximal axons and found that the number of autophagosomes was reduced in plekhg5 - deficient motoneurons ( fig. 8h , i ) .
this reduction did not occur in plekhg5 - / - motoneurons expressing constitutive active rab26 - ql ( fig. 8h , i ) .
in agreement with the data shown in fig. 5a - c , the number of autolysosomes remained unaltered .
these data confirm the conclusion that plekhg5 acts as a gef for rab26 and contributes to autophagosome biogenesis .
plekhg5 modifies er - stress in sod1 g93a motoneurons protein misfolding and endoplasmatic reticulum ( er ) stress is a common disease mechanism in different models of motoneuron disease31 - 36 .
deficiency of global autophagy in neurons results in an impairment of proteostasis characterized by accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in inclusion bodies8 , 9 .
plekhg5 - deficient mice did not show any accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins at axon terminals or in motoneuron cell bodies as shown by immunohistochemical staining ( supplementary fig. 6a , b ) .
in addition , we were not able to detect any differences in the levels of polyubiquitinated proteins by western blotting ( supplementary fig. 6c ) .
in contrast , the levels of chop and ire1alpha were markedly elevated in plekhg5 - / - spinal cord extracts ( fig. 9c , d ) .
thus , the unfolded protein response ( upr ) seems to be activated in plekhg5 - deficient mice .
we also tested the expression levels of heat shock protein family members hsp70 and hsp90 and the er chaperone calreticulin by western blot analyses and found significantly decreased expression of all three chaperones ( fig. 9a , b ) .
together , these data suggest that plekhg5 deficiency results in er - stress without affecting the turnover of polyubiquitinated proteins. fig. 9 plekhg5 depletion in sod1 g93a motoneurons results in elevated er - stress .

full size images are presented in supplementary fig. 7 in order to investigate the relevance of impaired synaptic vesicle autophagy for motoneuron vulnerability in a well - characterized model of als we depleted plekhg5 in sod1 g93a motoneurons in vitro ( fig. 9e - g ) .
we analyzed the effect of plekhg5 knockdown with two independent sh - rna lentiviral constructs on embryonic sod1 g93a motoneurons and investigated er - stress as a pathogenic mechanism .
er - stress precedes disease onset in sod1 transgenic mice37 and modulation of the upr has been shown to modulate disease onset and progression in sod1 transgenic mice38 , 39 .
perk phosphorylation , bip expression and chop activation were enhanced in a supra - additive manner in sod g93a motoneurons with additional plekhg5 depletion ( fig. 9e , f ) .
upon knockdown of plekhg5 , sod1 g93a motoneurons also showed a decrease in survival ( fig. 9g ) .
interestingly , this effect was observed in embryonic motoneurons representing a developmental stage long before disease becomes apparent in vivo .
we did not observe any significant changes in the levels of endogenous and transgenic sod1 when plekhg5 is depleted ( fig. 9e , f ) .
therefore , plekhg5 is not involved in the degradation of the mutant sod1 protein .
these data indicate that both disease mechanisms have additive effects , cumulating in an elevated load of er - stress .
discussion in summary , our data show that plekhg5 functions as a gef for rab26 , and thus regulates autophagy of synaptic vesicles in axon terminal of motoneurons .
disruption of this process leads to enlarged synaptic vesicles and accumulation of synaptic proteins resulting in dysfunction of neuromuscular junctions and motoneuron disease .
our data suggest that plekhg5 associates with pip ( 3 ) on preautophagosomal membranes and regulates the activity of rab26 by exchanging gdp to gtp .
the observation that plekhg5 does not regulate rab5 , rab27b , or rab33b activity suggests relative specificity , but does not exclude the possibility that plekhg5 could also regulate the activity of other small gtpases .
however , the observation that constitutively active rab26 rescues the phenotype in plekhg5 - deficient motoneurons suggests that the gef activity for rab26 is central for altered autophagy of synaptic vesicles in motoneurons .
in its gtp - bound form rab26 recruits atg16l to synaptic vesicles for initiating the delivery of synaptic vesicles to autophagosomes .
two previously identified interaction partners of plekhg5 , synectin13 , and the 14 - 3 - 3gamma - protein40 , are involved in autophagy regulation41 , 42 .
both proteins have been described to interact with pi ( 3 ) p - kinase , resulting in the inhibition of autophagy biogenesis .
the 14 - 3 - 3gamma - protein acts as a scaffold that inhibits the activity of pi ( 3 ) p - kinase .
in the same manner , the 14 - 3 - 3gamma - protein inhibits the gef activity of plekhg5 .
furthermore , protein kinase d mediated phosphorylation of ser92 at the n - terminus of plekhg5 prevents the interaction between these proteins40 .
it is tempting to speculate that phosphorylation of plekhg5 is the upstream signal to release 14 - 3 - 3gamma protein from the complex with plekhg5 and probably also from pi ( 3 ) p - kinase .
this might result in initiation of autophagy and activation of rab26 .
deficiency of global autophagy in neurons results in an impairment of proteostasis characterized by accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in inclusion bodies8 , 9 .
our data suggest that plekhg5 deficiency does not impair global protein homeostasis indicating that the defect in plekhg5 - / - mice is restricted to synaptic vesicles and does not involve misfolding or aggregation of cytosolic proteins .
thus , plekhg5 - / - mice represent a model of motoneuron disease without polyubiquitinated protein inclusion in which defective autophagy of synaptic vesicles stands in the center of the pathophysiology .
such cases of motoneuron disease without polyubiquitinated inclusions have been described43 and they seem to correlate with forms of motoneuron disease with prolonged survival , or with unusual familial cases of progressive muscular atrophy43 .
nmjs might be particularly vulnerable to defects in synaptic vesicle turnover due to their large presynaptic size and large number of synaptic vesicles compared to other synapses44 .
this idea is supported by the lack of behavioral deficits in plekhg5 - deficient mice and by the relatively preserved morphology of synapses in hippocampus , cerebral cortex and cerebellum .
azzedine et al.19 had previously characterized plekhg5 - deficient mice until 12 months of age , and had not detected motoneuron loss at this stage .
in our model , symptoms of motoneuron disease did not start before 12 months ( fig. 1c , e - g ) .
furthermore , motoneuron loss was not detectable before 12 months of age , and it progresseed until 24 months ( fig. 1d ) .
therefore , it is possible that motoneuron loss would have become apparent in the model described by azzedine et al.19 in mice older than 12 months .
furthermore , different strategies for generation of the null - allele could contribute to the severity of disease .
the model described by azzedine et al.19 had been generated by insertion of loxp sites flanking exon 9 - 13 .
excision of this target region results in a truncated protein lacking the rhogef domain but still containing the ph domain .
in our model , the protein lacks both domains .
our findings add to previous reports that neuron - specific disruption of autophagy by depletion of atg5 or atg7 results in progressive degeneration of motoneurons8 , 9 and that missense mutations in the autophagy receptors p62 / sqstm1 and optineurin are causative for als45 , 46 .
both proteins are substrates of traf family member - associated nf - kappa - b activator ( tank ) - binding kinase 1 ( tbk1 ) .
upon phosphorylation , p62 / sqstm1 and optineurin are recruited to mitochondria during pten - induced putative kinase protein 1 ( pink1 )/ parkin - mediated mitophagy47 , a mechanism implicated in the pathogenesis of parkinson 's disease48 .
previous reports on tbk1 mutations in als49 , 50 and the recently identified interaction of the putative rab gtpase gef chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 ( c9orf72 ) with wd repeat - containing protein 41 ( wdr41 ) and smith - magenis syndrome chromosomal region candidate gene 8 protein ( smcr8 ) 51 support the idea that impaired autophagy could make major contributions to the pathophysiology of motoneuron disease .
our study provides a first mechanism to explain how autophagy of synaptic vesicles is regulated in axon terminals of motoneurons and adds further weight to the hypothesis that dysregulated autophagy constitutes a major pathogenic mechanism in motoneuron disease .

measurement of rapid kinetics nucleotide binding to rab gtpases was analyzed by stopped flow instrument ( sx - 20 mv , applied photophysics ) using mant - gppnhp ( jena bioscience gmbh ) .
an aliquot of 100 nm mant - gppnhp , either in the presence or absence of 10 microm plekhg5 , was rapidly mixed with 1 microm rab gtpase in 10 mm mgcl2 , 20 mm hepes , ph 7.4 , 150 mm nacl , 1 mm dtt and 5 % glycerol .
mant - gppnhp was excited at 366 nm and fluorescence emission was monitored using a passing cut - off filter ( kv395 , schott ) .
electrophysiological analyses for the electrophysiological tests six wild - type ( 3 female , 3 male ) and six knockout ( 2 female , 4 male ) animals were used .
electrophysiological experiments were carried out in accordance with the internationally accepted principles in the care and use of experimental animals , approved by the local institutional animal care and research advisory committee and permitted by the local government ( lower saxony , germany ; az 13 / 1070 ) .
mice were housed under controlled conditions in the central animal facility of hannover medical school for nearly one week before measurements .
animals were anaesthetized by isoflurane ( 1.5 - 2 % with pure oxygen ( 1 l / min ) ; baxter ag , unterschleibetaheim , germany ) .
prior to the electrophysiological measurements carprofen ( 0.01 ml / 100 g ; 5 mg / kg ; rimadyl , pfizer gmbh , karlsruhe , germany ) was given subcutaneously for analgesia , and dexpanthenol eye ointment ( bepanthen augen - und nasensalbe , bayer vital gmbh , leverkusen , germany ) was applied to the eyes to prevent corneal dehydration .
during measurements , body temperature of the animals , monitored and recorded rectally , was maintained between 33 and 37 degreesc by using a thermostat heating plate ( direct current ) .
portable emg equipment ( natus keypoint focus , natus europe gmbh , planegg , germany ) along with the keypoint.net ( version 2.32 ) computer program was used .
for nerve conduction studies , the sciatic nerve of ~ 24 - month - old animals was stimulated percutaneously by single pulses of 0.1 ms and 1 hz delivered through a pair of needle electrodes ( spes medica disposable monopolar needle electrode , 13 mm x 33 g , gvb gelimed kg , bad segeberg , germany ) placed proximally at the sciatic notch and distally at the popliteal fossa .
the distance between both stimulation electrodes was measured .
reference electrodes were inserted subcutaneously a few millimeters apart from the stimulation electrodes .
the maximal compound muscle action potential ( cmap ) was recorded using needle electrodes ( same as for stimulation ) at the gastrocnemius , anterior tibial or plantaris muscles .
the reference electrode for all three muscles was placed in the fourth toe .
the ground electrode was inserted subcutaneously rostral to the stimulation electrodes .
amplitude ( baseline - peak , mean proximal / distal ) and latency ( time from stimulus to the onset of first negative deflection , mean proximal / distal ) were measured .
nerve conduction velocity ( ncv ) was calculated via the latency differences of the proximal and distal stimulation and the stimulation distance ( mean ncv per muscle gastrocnemius / tibialis ) .
motor unit number estimation ( mune ) was performed subsequently to the nerve conduction study , based on the description in arnold et al.59 .
at least ten single motor unit potentials ( smups ; baseline - peak amplitude ) were obtained by incremental stimulation technique ( 1 hz , 0.1 ms , 0.02 ma increase ) .
only increases over 25 muv in the amplitude were recorded trying to minimize the influence of alternation .
the incremental values of the smups were averaged in order to determine the size of the mean smup .
in the end , the estimated number of motor units within the tibialis and gastrocnemius muscle was calculated by dividing the respective mean smup into the maximum cmap amplitude .
mechanical sensitivity to determine mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds , we used the von frey test based on the up - and - down - method of chaplan et al.60 .
experimental mice were placed on a wire mesh in individual acrylic - glas cages and the plantar surface of the hind paws was alternately touched with a calibrated von frey filament applying mild pressure leading to a slight bending of the filament ; the experiment was started at 0.69 g. upon hind paw withdrawal the next thinner von frey filament was used .
if the hind paw was not withdrawn , the next thicker von frey filament was used .
each hind paw was assessed three consecutive times and the 50 % withdrawal threshold ( i.e. force of the von frey hair to which an animal reacts in 50 % of the administrations ) was calculated .
heat sensitivity to determine paw withdrawal latencies upon heat stimulation we applied a standard algometer ( ugo basile , gemonio , italy ) based on the method of hargreaves et al.61 .
experimental mice were placed on a glass surface in individual plexiglas cages and a radiant heat source ( 25 ir ) was placed under one hind paw each .
time until paw withdrawal was recorded automatically .
heat application was limited to 16 s to avoid tissue damage .
each hind paw was tested three times consecutively .
behavior plekhg5 - deficient ( n = 10 ) and control mice ( n = 11 ) , at age of 12 - 14 months with no symptoms of motoneuron disease were used for behavioral analysis .
genders within genotypes were grouped , as differences between them were not statistically significant .
mice were housed individually under a 12 h light / dark cycle ( 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. ) with ad libitum access to food and water .
the cages ( tecniplast , 1264 c eurostandard typ ii , 267 x 207 x 140 mm ) were kept in a scantainer ( scanbur ltd .
denmark ) assuring stable conditions through a constant airflow and maintaining a temperature of about 21 degreesc and air humidity of about 55 % .
experimental procedures took place during the light phase of the cycle between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. mice were transported in their home cage to a separate room and allowed to calm down for half an hour .
then mice were taken individually in their home cages to the experimental room for experiments .
the experimenter was unaware of the genotype to keep experiments unbiased .
for the open field test , mice were placed in the middle of an open field arena ( 48 x 48 cm , height 50 cm , evenly illuminated to ~ 40 lux ) and filmed for 10 min with a webcam - based system ( logitech ) .
movements of the mice were tracked with videomot2 ( tse , germany ) and the following parameters were analyzed : time spent in center , number of entries into center .
the area was cleaned thoroughly with water after each trial .
the object recognition experiments took place in the open field arena .
for the object recognition task two kinds of objects were used : a cell culture flask and a tower of about the same size built of differently colored lego bricks .
the objects were placed in diagonally opposing corners of the arena with 12 cm distance to from both sides of the wall .
on day 1 half of the animals were presented with two cell culture flasks , the other half with two lego towers .
mice were placed in the middle of the arena and allowed to explore the arena and the objects for 10 min .
on day 2 one of the objects was replaced by a novel object ( either cell culture flask or lego tower ) at either position 1 or 2 in a pseudo - randomized manner to avoid position bias .
each mouse was therefore confronted with a familiar and a novel object and was allowed to explore freely for 10 min .
mice were automatically tracked ( see above ) .
we scored exploratory behavior toward objects manually whenever the mouse sniffed the object or touched the object while looking at it. after each trial , the arena and the objects were cleaned with water .
fear conditioning was performed in a fear conditioning apparatus ( mouse multi - conditioning system , 256060 series , tse , germany ) .
fear conditioning took place in context a , which consisted of a square arena with two blackened sides placed on a metal grid .
context b , a round arena , which was placed on a black plastic ground , served as new context .
to support context discrimination , mild olfactory cues were introduced into the arenas by wiping them with tissue paper moistened with 70 % ethanol for context a and 1 % acetic acid for context b. the conditioning consisted of two phases .
on day 1 ( fear acquisition ) , mice were exposed to context a for 180 s before a tone ( cs , 80 db , 5000 hz ) was presented for 10 s and co - terminated with an electric foot shock of 0.7 ma for 1 s ( us ) .
the cs and the us were presented three times with an inter - stimulus - interval ( isi ) of 20 s. after the last presentation , mice stayed in context a for 150 s before being returned to the home cage .
on day 2 , mice were placed in context b to test for context discrimination .
for fear retrieval , after 60 s of free exploration the cs was presented without the us for 12 times with an isi of 20 s. after another 60 s mice were returned to their home cage .
mice were video tracked and movement was recorded by a light beam system .
freezing behavior , defined as immobility except for respiration movements , was analyzed with a software - based system ( tse mcs fcs ) and a freezing threshold of 2 s. after each trial , the context was cleaned with 70 % ethanol or 1 % acetic acid , respectively .
to account for statistical differences between genotypes and conditions depending on the experiment , two - way anovas with post hoc sidak 's multiple comparison test or unpaired t - tests were performed .
analyses were performed with graphpad prism 6 and are represented as +/ - sem .
results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 .

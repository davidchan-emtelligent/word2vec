background paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration ( pcd ) is a classical tumor - associated , immune - mediated disease typically associated with gynecological malignancies , small - cell lung - cancer or lymphoma .
case presentation here we present the case of a 38 - year old male with an over 12 months rapidly progressive cerebellar syndrome .
extensive diagnostic workup revealed selective hypermetabolism of the right tonsil in whole - body pet .
histological examination after tonsillectomy demonstrated a lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the tonsil and the tongue base strongly suggesting a paraneoplastic cause of the cerebellar syndrome .
to the best of our knowledge this is the first case of an association of a lymphoepithelial carcinoma , a rare pharyngeal tumor , with pcd .
conclusions in cases of classical paraneoplastic syndromes an extensive search for neoplasms should be performed including whole - body pet to detect tumors early in the course of the disease .
lymphoepithelioma paraneoplastic syndrome pet subacute cerebellar degeneration tonsil background paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration ( pcd ) is a classical paraneoplastic syndrome ( pns ) of the cns [ 1 ] often associated with onconeural antibodies leading to a t - cell mediated destruction of purkinje cells in the cerebellum [ 2 ] .
typically , pcd occurs in patients with ovarian cancer , breast - cancer , small - cell lung - cancer ( sclc ) or hodgkin 's lymphoma [ 2 ] .
nonetheless , pcd can be associated with other malignancies and can occur up to 5 years before detection of the primary tumor .
here , we describe a patient who developed subacute cerebellar degeneration which was classified as a paraneoplastic syndrome upon histological diagnosis of a lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the tonsil and tongue base .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first published case of pcd associated with a lymphoepithelial carcinoma .
case presentation a 38 - year old , previously healthy man presented on his first admission with a 5 - day history of dizziness , slurring of speech and disturbance of gait and balance .
there was a family history of multiple sclerosis ( paternal grandfather and a paternal cousin ) but not of any other cerebellar disease .
the patient smoked 30 cigarettes per day for the last 25 years .
neurological examination revealed dysarthria , trunk and gait ataxia and exaggerated tendon reflexes of the upper and lower limbs .
spontaneous nystagmus was absent and pursuit eye movements were smooth .
routine hematology was normal but the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) showed elevated cell count ( 407 lymphocytes / mul ) and protein ( 1 g / l ) while glucose and lactate were normal .
csf cytology provided no evidence of malignant cells but oligoclonal igg bands were detected in the csf .
hsv - and vzv - pcrs were negative .
cerebellitis caused by an unknown infectious agent was suspected and a polyvalent intravenous therapy with aciclovir , ceftriaxone and ampicilline was initiated which halted disease progression .
cerebral mri was unremarkable .
during the next months he underwent two neurorehabilitation treatments without relevant efficacy on the residual symptoms , but 10 months after disease onset he rapidly deteriorated .
on admission this time he reported severe gait and trunk unsteadiness , difficulties in writing , massive slurring of speech and problems of swallowing .
on physical examination he showed a substantial weight loss of 15 kg over the last 12 months but no enlargement of lymph nodes .
neurological examination revealed a cerebellar syndrome with an exaggerated horizontal nystagmus during lateral gaze and a scanning dysarthria .
fixation suppression of the vestibulo - ocular reflex was abolished .
there was no muscle weakness or sensory loss and his limb reflexes were normal but plantar responses were bilaterally extensor .
he showed severe dysmetria of all four limbs and trunk and gait ataxia .
walking without aid was impossible .
routine biochemistry and hematology were again normal .
cranial mri now showed marked cerebellar atrophy .
the csf contained 18 leukocytes / mul , 0.85 g / l protein , oligoclonal igg bands , and normal glucose and lactate concentrations .
csf cytology was again normal .
infectiological screening of the csf ( hsv - 1 and - 2 , vzv , cmv , ebv , hiv , treponema pallidum , brucella , borrelia ) was negative .
further biochemical examination showed normal vitamins b12 and e and very - long - chain - fatty acids .
anti - gliadin - antibodies were negative .
squamous cell carcinoma - antigen ( scc ) was mildly elevated ( 2.7 u / l , reference < 1.5 ) while nse , psa , cyfra 21 - 1 , cea and electrophoresis were normal .
classical onconeural antibodies ( anti - hu , - tr , - yo , - ma , - ta , amphiphysin , cv2 / crmp5 ) were not detected via immunofluorescence test ( ift ) .
mri of the entire spinal axis did not show any metastases and search for a pulmonary or abdominal neoplasm in ct - scans of the chest and abdomen was also unremarkable .
a whole - body pet / ct - scan revealed a mild hypermetabolism of the left thyroid lobe and the right tonsil and neighboring tongue - base ( figure 1a,b ) .
sonological and histological examination of the thyroid did not detect any malignancy .
inspection of the tonsils revealed no signs of a neoplasm except for an asymmetry with a larger right tonsil .
histological examination after tonsillectomy revealed a lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the lower tonsil and tongue base with low - grade differentiation ( figure 1c,d ) .
the mitosis marker ki67 was present in 40 % of tumor cells .
immunohistochemical workup revealed numerous cd3 + t - and cd20 + b - lymphocytes with positivity for bcl2 .
staining was negative for cd23 , cd30 , cd34 , cd138 , and the macrophage marker kim1p .
additional resection of the neighboring tongue ground including neck dissection detected no further neoplastic tissue .
accordingly , the interdisciplinary tumor board did not recommend radio - or chemotherapy .
in the course of the next eighteen months the patient underwent further intensive neurorehabilitation treatment leading to a stable cerebellar dysfunction with only slight progression of dysarthria which was treated every three months with steroid pulses ( i.v. methylprednisolone 1 g / day for 5 consecutive days ) .

discussion and conclusions this is the first published case of a lymphoepithelial carcinoma associated with pcd .
classification as a classical paraneoplastic syndrome and detection of a malignant tumor within twelve months after the onset of cerebellar symptoms establishes the diagnosis of a definite pns [ 1 ] .
despite missing onconeural antibodies , the substantially slowed disease progression after tumor resection and the initial responsiveness to steroids largely exclude other differential diagnoses .
the pathogenesis in our case as in most other pcd cases [ 2 ] is most likely a t - cell mediated cytotoxic autoimmune response against purkinje cells [ 2 ] .
besides the typical tumor entities , i.e. ovarian cancer , breast cancer , lung cancer ( mostly sclc , but also adenocarcinomas ) [ 2 ] a wide range of other tumors have been reported in association with pcd in individual cases ( see table 1 , additional file 1 ) .

( for references given in table 1 , please see additional file 1 ) .
the data in table 1 reveal atypically localized malignancies in many different body regions belonging mostly to either the hematological / immunological system ( lymphomas , langerhans' cell histiocytosis , thymus carcinoma ) , the gastro - intestinal system ( esophagus , gastric , colon or pancreas carcinoma ) or the urogenital system ( kidney , bladder , testis or prostate cancer ) .
in our case histological examination demonstrated a lymphoepithelial carcinoma , which is a rare tumor entity , typically localized in the nasopharynx region .
due to the histological association with lymphoid tissue , tumor tissue can arise from all pharyngeal regions where lymphatic tissue is regularly located i.e. the tonsil , the hypopharynx , the tongue base and the paranasal sinuses [ 3 - 5 ] .
cases of lymphoepithelioma - like carcinomas of the salivary glands are also reported [ 6 ] .
lymphoepitheliomas are poorly differentiated tumors which contain tumor cells of epithelial origin in association with a diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes , plasma cells or eosinophils , which has led to coining to the term " lympho - epithelioma " .
in some cases , also squamous cell carcinoma cells can be detected .
the elevated tumor marker scc in our case raises the possibility of a potential squamous cell - portion .
no antibodies associated with lymphoma ( anti - tr ) or sclc ( anti - hu , - cv2 , - ri , - ma2 , - amphiphysin ) were detected so that the origin of the antigenic structure that resulted in pcd remains unclear .
we have not performed immunohistochemistry on rodent brain tissue sections with the patient 's csf to search for new reactivities , which can be considered a limitation of this report .
there are only very few reports about paraneoplastic syndromes in association with lymphoepithelioma - like carcinomas of various other organs ( polymyositis , nephrotic syndrome , erythema elevatum diutinum ) [ 7 - 9 ] but onconeural antibodies have not been described in these cases .
classical neurological pns have not yet been reported in association with this tumor entity so that this is the first case report of pcd associated with a lymphoepithelial carcinoma .
due to the localized state of the tumor in our patient complete surgical removal of the carcinoma was feasible without additional radio - or chemotherapy .
regarding the pathophysiological concept of pns the tumor resection is the most important part of the therapy to reduce the amount of antigenic tumor cells .
in addition , immunomodulatory treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins occasionally shows efficacy in early stages of the disease [ 10 ] .
our case report highlights the usefulness of an extended tumor search - including a whole - body pet / ct scan - when a paraneoplastic syndrome is suspected [ 11 ] .
a whole - body pet / ct scan provides superior sensitivity to detect small or atypically localized neoplasms , a precondition to initiate causal therapy by surgical removal .

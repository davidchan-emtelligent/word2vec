b cells are typically characterized as positive regulators of the immune response , primarily by producing antibodies .
however , recent studies indicate that various subsets of b cells can perform regulatory functions mainly through il - 10 secretion .
here we discovered that peritoneal b - 1 ( b - 1p ) cells produce high levels of il - 10 upon stimulation with several toll - like receptor ( tlr ) ligands .
high levels of il - 10 suppressed b - 1p cell proliferation and differentiation response to all tlr ligands studied in an autocrine manner in vitro and in vivo .
il - 10 that accumulated in cultures inhibited b - 1p cells at second and subsequent cell divisions mainly at the g1 / s interphase .
il - 10 inhibits tlr induced b - 1p cell activation by blocking the classical nf - kappab pathway .
co - stimulation with cd40 or baff abrogated the il - 10 inhibitory effect on b - 1p cells during tlr stimulation .
finally , b - 1p cells adoptively transferred from the peritoneal cavity of il - 10 - / - mice showed better clearance of borrelia hermsii than wild - type b - 1p cells .
this study described a novel autoregulatory property of b - 1p cells mediated by b - 1p cell derived il - 10 , which may affect the function of b - 1p cells in infection and autoimmunity .
introduction regulation of the immune response is as important as its activation to prevent harmful effects caused by effector cells .
both cell intrinsic ( central tolerance ) and cell extrinsic ( regulatory cells ) mechanisms prevent the development of autoimmunity as well as negatively control exaggerated immune responses [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
janeway and colleagues were the first to demonstrate a regulatory role for b cells by demonstrating that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ) is enhanced in a b cell deficient environment [ 3 ] .
b cells that negatively regulate different immune responses through il - 10 production were termed " regulatory b cells " by mizoguchi and bhan [ 4 ] .
recent studies have shown that il - 10 producing b - cell subsets with varying phenotypes can regulate different immune responses in numerous mouse models , such as inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , eae , type 1 diabetes , collagen - induced arthritis , contact hypersensitivity and during parasitic infection [ 5 ] .
despite the diversity of b cell subsets involved in the disease models , the regulatory mechanisms are uniformly dependent on il - 10 production .
one of the high il - 10 producing subsets is the cd1dhicd5 + b cell subset , termed " b10 cells " by yanaba and tedder [ 6 ] .
matsushita et al. showed that depletion of b cells with anti - cd20 antibodies before or during early stages of eae induction enhanced the disease [ 7 ] .
b cell depletion during the active disease period decreased the intensity of disease , presumably due to the antigen presenting cell function of b cells .
in a clinical trial of b cell depletion therapy for ulcerative colitis , b cell depletion exacerbated the disease [ 8 ] .
peritoneal b - 1 ( b - 1p ) cells were one of the first b cell subsets to be identified to have the ability to produce il - 10 .
the b - 1 cells were described almost two decades ago and have recently been shown to form a distinct b cell lineage [ 9 ] .
the b - 1 cell subset expresses the pan t cell marker cd5 and is present in the spleen as well as the peritoneal cavity .
it is further subdivided into b - 1a and b - 1b subsets based on differential expression of cd5 versus mac - 1 [ 10 ] .
the b - 1a subset is required for production of natural antibodies whereas the b - 1b subset is involved in adaptive immune responses to certain bacterial infections [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
b - 1p cells are the source of natural igm present in serum , mucosal iga [ 10 ] and play an important role in immunity against bloodborne pathogens [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
b - 1 cells express antibody specificities against conserved bacterial epitopes such as phosphorylcholine as well as self antigens such as ssdna , thy1 and red blood cells .
in humans , rheumatoid factor producing b cells are present predominantly in the b - 1 subset [ 16 ] .
also , b - 1 cells are elevated in several mouse models of lupus [ 10 ] .
b - 1 cells proliferate poorly in response to bcr crosslinking , presumably to protect against accidental activation by self antigens [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
this is in part due to negative regulation by cd5 and in part due to defects in generation of synergistic signals via b cell receptor ( bcr ) and cd19 [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] .
despite the ability of b - 1p cells to produce more il - 10 than b - 2 cells [ 21 ] , a regulatory role for them has been shown only in the ibd model [ 22 ] .
toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) are pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns , which trigger innate immunity leading to initiation of adaptive immunity .
several b cell subsets express tlrs and can be activated via tlr ligands which result in robust proliferation and antibody secretion , even in the absence of dendritic cell activation or aid from t cells [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] .
in addition to cd4 + t cell help , generation of t - dependent antigen specific antibody responses requires activation of tlrs in b cells [ 25 ] .
although this is a controversial finding , it appears to be dependent on the chemical modification of the antigen [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
tlr signals are also essential for t - independent pathogen - specific igm response [ 28 ] .
b - 1p cells require intact tlr signaling for the clearance of borrelia hermsii , which causes relapsing fever in both humans and mice [ 28 ] .
furthermore , tlr mediated signals synergize with self - antigen mediated bcr signals to stimulate activation of self - reactive b cells [ 29 ] .
in this study , we demonstrated for the first time that il - 10 plays an auto - regulatory role in b - 1p cells .
b - 1p cells produced much higher levels of il - 10 than all the splenic b cell subsets both constitutively and after stimulation with a variety of tlr ligands .
we also made the surprising observation that b - 1p cells responded to tlr ligands significantly less than splenic b - 2 cells ( b - 2s ) as measured by proliferation and antibody production .
high and rapid il - 10 production by b - 1p cells upon tlr stimulation inhibited their own proliferation by blocking the classical nf - kappab pathway .
co - stimulation with cd40 and baff ( b cell activating factor belonging to the tnf family ) , but not il - 5 , overcame the il - 10 mediated inhibition of b - 1 cells .
we showed that high il - 10 production by b - 1p cells hampered the clearance of b. hermsii in b - 1p transferred micromt mice .
results b - 1p cells are hyporesponsive to tlr ligands during the course of our studies to determine if tlr4 and b cell receptor signals synergize in b - 1p cells , we made the surprising observation that b - 1p cells are hyporesponsive to lps , a tlr4 ligand , mediated proliferation response when compared to b - 2s cells .
both b - 1p and b - 2s cells responded similarly to cd40 mediated signaling ( fig. 1a ) .
several previous studies did not emphasize such differences in the lps response of b - 1 and b - 2 cells , even though data in some reports supports our observation [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
the hyporesponsiveness of b - 1p cells was independent of the purity ( protein or dna free ) of the lps used ( fig. 1a ) .
on average , we found that the b - 1 cell response to lps is 17 +/ - 6 % of the b - 2 cell response ( n = 7 , p < 0.004 , with an average of 5 mice in each experiment ) .
interestingly , b - 1p cells remained highly viable even up to 6 days after stimulation , while viability of b - 2s cells decreased significantly after two days of stimulation , ruling out reduced viability as a cause of b - 1p cell hyporesponsiveness to lps .
in spite of this decrease in viability , the absolute number of cells recovered on day 6 was higher in b - 2s cells than b - 1p cells due to their increased proliferation ( supplementary fig. s1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0011445.g001 figure 1 b - 1p cells respond weakly to tlr stimulation compared to b - 2s cells .
( a ) b - 2s and b - 1p cells from c57bl / 6 mice were cultured with anti - igm f ( ab ') 2 , lps - 2880 ( phenol extracted ) , lps - 2663 ( gel purified ) , lps - 4005 ( tca precipitated ) or anti - cd40 for 48 hours and proliferation was measured by 3 [ h ] thymidine incorporation .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd from triplicate cultures and are representative of three independent experiments .
( b ) b - 1p and b - 2s cells were cultured with tlr2 , 3 and 7 ligands pam3csk4 , poly i : c , loxoribine , cpg respectively or anti - cd40 for 48 hours and proliferation was measured by 3 [ h ] thymidine incorporation .
similar results were obtained in two other experiments .
data points represent mean +/ - sd values from triplicate cultures .
in panels a and b , *** = p < 0.0005 when comparing responses of b - 1 and b - 2s cells ( c ) b - 1p and b - 2s cells were purified and rested for 30 minutes .
total rna was isolated , and mrna for various tlrs ( tlr - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 and 9 ) and gapdh were quantified by quantitative real - time pcr as described under " experimental procedures " .
amount of tlr mrna in b - 1p cells was expressed as a percentage of corresponding tlr mrna in b - 2s cells .
data are presented as mean +/ - sd values from triplicates and are representative of two independent experiments .
in all the panels 6 - 8 mice were used in each experiment .
b - 1p cell response to other tlr ligands was tested to determine if b - 1p hyporesponsiveness was restricted to tlr4 ligand .
b - 1p cells proliferate significantly less than b - 2s cells when stimulated with various tlr agonists , including pam3csk4 ( tlr - 1 / 2 ) , poly ( i : c ) ( tlr3 ) , loxoribine ( tlr7 ) and cpg ( tlr9 ) .
in parallel , both b - 1p and b - 2s cells proliferated equally well when stimulated via cd40 ( fig. 1b ) .
the tlr5 agonist , flagellin , failed to stimulate b - 1p and b - 2s cell proliferation .
real time rt - pcr analysis showed that tlr3 , tlr4 and tlr7 mrnas were expressed equally in both b - 1p and b - 2s subsets , while tlr2 and tlr5 genes were expressed less in b - 1p than in b - 2s cells .
interestingly , tlr9 expression was 3 fold higher in b - 1p cells than in b - 2s cells ( fig. 1c ) .
therefore , the hyporesponsivness of b - 1p cells to tlr3 , 4 , 7 and 9 ligands is unlikely to be due to decreased expression of tlr on b - 1p cells .
we chose lps and cpg for further studies since lps uses both trif and myd88 pathways while cpg uses only the myd88 pathway .
they also represent tlrs that differ in cellular expression .
hyporesponsiveness of b - 1p cells to tlr signaling is in part due to increased production of il - 10 an examination of the time kinetics revealed that b - 1p and b - 2s cell proliferation responses to lps and cpg were similar after 24 hours of stimulation .
however , b - 2s response peaked at 48 hours and remained significantly higher than b - 1p cells up to 72 hours ( fig. 2a ) .
this difference in kinetics , which is also dependent on cell densities , may be the reason why many previous studies [ 19 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] did not appreciate the difference in tlr response of b - 1 and b - 2 cells .
il - 10 inhibits in vitro proliferation of murine b - 2s cells and human activated leukemic cd5 + b cells [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
hence , we hypothesized that hyporesponsiveness of b - 1p cells to lps and cpg may be due to production of il - 10 by b - 1 cells and its inhibitory effects .
however , the kinetics of il - 10 production by b - 1p and b - 2s cells upon tlr stimulation has never been examined previously .
as shown in fig. 2b , b - 1p cells produced large amounts of il - 10 , with quantities detectable as early as 6 hours after lps or cpg stimulation , while b - 2s cells produced very low levels of il - 10 , which became detectable only after 12 hours of lps ( tlr4 ) or cpg ( tlr9 ) stimulation .
at 48 hours , b - 1p cells produced 10 fold more il - 10 upon lps stimulation and 25 fold more il - 10 upon cpg stimulation than b - 2s cells ( fig. 2b ) .
upon neutralization of il - 10 effects with anti - il - 10r antibody , there was a significant ( p < 0.0004 ) increase in lps and cpg induced proliferation of b - 1p cells at 48 , 72 and 96 hours , but not at 24 hours ( fig. 2c ) .
there was no significant difference ( p > 0.05 ) in b - 2s cell proliferation with anti - il - 10r antibody treatment ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
next , we examined if b - 1 cell derived il - 10 also plays a role in their differentiation responses .
neutralization of il - 10 increased antibody production by tlr4 or tlr9 stimulated b - 1p cells ( fig. 2d ) , but no significant difference was observed in the b - 2s group with the same treatment ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0011445.g002 figure 2 hyporesponsiveness of b - 1p cells to different tlrs is due to high il - 10 production .
( a ) b - 1p and b - 2s cells were stimulated with lps or cpg for 24 , 48 , 72 and 96 hours in the presence or absence of anti - il - 10r antibody .
the cultures were pulsed with 3 [ h ] thymidine during the final four hours of the culture period and the results are presented as mean +/ - sd of triplicate determinations .
( b ) culture supernatants of b - 2s and b - 1p cells were collected at 6 , 12 , 24 and 48 hours of stimulation with lps or cpg and assayed by elisa for il - 10 .
in panels a and b the p - values (* = p < 0.05 , ** = p < 0.005 , *** = p < 0.0005 ) denote the significance of differences between the responses of b - 1p and b - 2s cells .
results presented in panels a and b are representative of two independent experiments with 6 - 8 mice in each experiment .
( c ) b - 1p cells were cultured with lps or cpg in the presence or absence of anti - il - 10r antibody or isotype antibody and proliferation was measured by 3 [ h ] thymidine incorporation .
data ( mean +/ - sd , n = 10 mice per experiment ) are representative of three independent experiments .
the p - values (* = p < 0.05 , *** = p < 0.0005 ) signify the differences between proliferation responses with and without anti - il - 10 antibody .
( d ) b - 1p cells were cultured with lps or cpg for 5 days in the presence or absence of anti - il - 10r antibody .
at the end of 5 days , culture supernatants were collected and assayed by elisa for total igm .
results ( mean +/ - sd , n = 6 mice per experiment ) are representative of three experiments .
the p - value (*** = p < 0.0005 ) signify differences in antibody secretion with and without anti - il - 10 antibody .
agonists for tlr2 , 3 and 7 also behave like tlr4 and tlr9 agonists in inducing very high amounts of il - 10 secretion by b - 1p cells but not by b - 2s cells ( table 1 ) .
in terms of absolute magnitude , il - 10 induced by tlr ligands ranged from 4 to 12 ng / ml for b - 1p cells whereas it was 0.01 to 0.13 ng / ml for b - 2s cells .
it is also interesting to note that b - 1p cells produced high levels of il - 10 constitutively ( table 1 ) .
il - 10 appeared to have a role in the reduced b - 1 cell responses to all the tlr ligands studied , since there was a significant ( p < 0.006 ) increase in proliferation of b - 1p cells when stimulated with different tlr agonists in the presence of anti - il - 10r antibody in comparison to stimulation with tlr agonists alone ( table 1 ) .

il - 10 was quantified by elisa .
proliferation was measured after 48 hours either in the presence or absence of alpha - il - 10r ab ( 1 microg / ml ) .
the tritiated thymidine incorporation for b - 1p cells stimulated with pam3csk4 , poly i : c and loxoribine in the absence of alpha - il - 10r ab was 9830 , 6989 and 9677 , respectively .
b - 1a cells , among different b cell subsets , produce high amounts of il - 10 constitutively and upon tlr stimulation b - 1p cells can be further divided into b - 1a and b - 1b cells , both of which express mac - 1 and b220 , but only b - 1a cells express cd5 .
it has been shown that cd5 promotes il - 10 production in human b cells [ 10 ] .
furthermore , cd5 + b lymphoma cells produce increased levels of il - 10 relative to cd5 - lymphoma cells [ 35 ] .
we purified the three peritoneal b cell subsets , b - 1a ( b220 + mac - 1 + cd5 +) , b - 1b ( b220 + mac - 1 + cd5 - ) and b - 2p ( b220 + mac - 1 - cd5 - ) cells , by facs sorting ( fig. 3a ) .
among these highly pure subsets (> 98 %) , b - 1a cells produced constitutively higher amounts of il - 10 ( 161 pg / ml ) compared to b - 1b ( 32 pg / ml ) and b - 2p ( 3 pg / ml ) cells .
b - 1a cells also produced very high levels of il - 10 upon lps stimulation ; almost 12 fold more than b - 2p cells and 3.5 fold more than b - 1b cells ( fig. 3a , bottom panel ) .
the high amounts of il - 10 produced by b - 1a cells inhibited their own proliferation , while the amounts of il - 10 produced by b - 1b and b - 2p cells ( supplementary fig. s4 ) were not sufficient to inhibit their own proliferation .
we also facs - purified the different splenic b cell subsets , specifically the follicular and marginal zone b cells and tested for their ability to produce il - 10 constitutively and after lps stimulation .
as shown in table 2 , none of the splenic b cell subsets produced constitutively high levels of il - 10 .
similarly , none of the splenic b cell subsets or lymph node b cells produced high amounts of il - 10 upon lps stimulation in comparison to peritoneal b - 1a cells .
although marginal zone b cells produced as much il - 10 as b - 1b cells , like the b - 1b cells the amount of il - 10 produced was not sufficient to inhibit their own proliferation ( supplementary fig. s5 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0011445.g003 figure 3 b - 1a cells are the major il - 10 producing cells among peritoneal and splenic b cell populations .
( a ) macrophage depleted peritoneal cell populations were gated on b220 + cells and further separated into b - 1a ( mac1 + cd5 +) , b - 1b ( mac1 + cd5 - ) and b - 2 ( mac1 - cd5 - ) using a facs machine ( top panel ) .
sorted b - 1a , b - 1b and b - 2 cells were cultured with lps for 48 hours .
the culture supernatants were collected and assayed for il - 10 ( bottom panel ) .
data are shown as mean +/ - sd of triplicate cultures and are representative of two independent experiments with 15 mice each .
the p - values signify the differences in il - 10 production by b - 1a cells in comparison to b - 1b and b - 2p cells (*** = p < 0.0005 ) and between b - 1b and b - 2p cells (** = p < 0.005 ) .
( b ) b - 1p cells from c57bl / 6 and b - 1s cell from vh12 tg mice were cultured with lps or cpg for 48 hours ; culture supernatants were collected at 48 hours and assayed for il - 10 ( left panel ) .
b - 2s cells from vh12 wild type littermate ( wt ) mice and b - 1s cell from vh12 tg mice were cultured with lps or cpg for 48 hours and cell proliferation was assessed by 3 [ h ] thymidine incorporation ( right panel ) .
similar results were obtained in two other experiments ( mean +/ - sd with five mice per group ) .
the p - value (*** = p < 0.0005 ) signify the differences in response between b - 1p and b - 1s cells .

sorted b - 2s and b - 1s cells were cultured with lps for 48 hours , culture supernatants were collected and assayed for il - 10 ( bottom left panel ) , and for proliferation ( bottom right panel ) with or without anti - il - 10r antibody .
representative results from the one of two experiments are shown ( mean +/ - sd , n = 5 ) .

nd = non - detectable .
b - 1s cells behave more like b - 2s cells , rather than b - 1p cells , in terms of il - 10 production and proliferation even though the majority of b - 1 cells are in the peritoneum , substantial numbers of b - 1 cells are also located in the spleen .
b - 1p cells , unlike splenic b - 1 ( b - 1s ) cells , express a constitutively activated form of stat3 , a transcription factor , known to regulate il - 10 gene expression [ 30 ] .
b - 1s cells from vh12 transgenic mice ( vh12 tg ) ( most vh12 b cells in adult mice bind the common phospholipid phosphatidylcholine ( ptc ) and are b - 1 [ 36 ]) showed very low constitutive il - 10 production and upon lps or cpg stimulation in comparison to b - 1p cells ( fig. 3b , left panel ) .
furthermore , b - 1s cells from vh12 tg mice did not show any hyporesponsiveness to lps or cpg stimulation in comparison to b - 2s cells from vh12 wild type littermate ( vh12 wt ) ( fig. 3b , right panel ) .
we could not detect any il - 10 in unstimulated wild type b - 1s cells even after facs sorting ( fig. 3c , top panel ) , suggesting that both b - 2s and b - 1s cells lacked the ability to produce il - 10 constitutively .
upon lps stimulation , both b - 1s and b - 2s produced comparable amounts of il - 10 ( fig. 3cbottom left panel , ) , but the amount is significantly less than b - 1p cells ( fig. 2b & 3a ) .
as expected , the low levels of il - 10 produced by b - 1s and b - 2s cells did not have an inhibitory effect on their proliferation response to lps , as shown by a lack of increase in proliferation upon il - 10 neutralization ( fig. 3c , bottom right panel ) .
this data regarding il - 10 production by splenic b - 1a cells is in agreement with the identification of il - 10 producing b10 cells , characterized as cd1dhighcd5 + cells , by yanaba et al .
[ 6 ] .
however , it is unclear if the slpenic cd1dhighcd5 + b10 subset will produce as much il - 10 as the peritoneal b - 1a cells , since yanaba et al .
[ 6 ] used only intracellular staining to identify b - 10 cells .
il - 10 regulates b - 1p response : in vitro and in vivo since neutralization of il - 10 signaling via the anti - il - 10r antibody led to an increased response of b - 1p to tlr stimulation , we determined if the b - 1p cells from il - 10 - / - mice were also more responsive to tlr signaling .
b - 1p cells from young il - 10 - / - mice proliferated significantly more upon lps (> 5 fold ) and cpg (> 3 fold ) stimulation when compared to b - 1p cells from wild type mice ( fig. 4a ) .
wild - type and il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells proliferated equally upon cd40 stimulation .
the tlr responses of il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells were still susceptible to il - 10 inhibition , since exogenously added il - 10 inhibited their response to lps and cpg ( fig. 4a ) .
lps ( data not shown ) or cpg ( fig. 4b ) induced b - 1p ( wt and il - 10 - / - ) and b - 2s proliferation was inhibited similarly by exogenous il - 10 .

( e ) cfse labeled purified peritoneal b cells ( b220 +) from wild type or il - 10 - / - mice were injected intraperitoneally into rag - 1 - / - mice .
two hours later 25 microg of lps per mouse was injected intraperitoneally .
total b - 1p cells ( b220 +) ( left panel ) , b - 1a cells ( b220 + mac - 1hi ) ( middle panel ) and b - 1b cells ( b220 + mac - 1lo ) ( right panel ) from wild type or il - 10 - / - transferred mice were analyzed for cfse dilution after 60 hours of in vivo stimulation with pbs or lps .
(* = p < 0.005 , compared to pbs treated group , ** = p < 0.005 , compared to wt b - 1 transferred group with lps stimulation ) since there was no difference in proliferation response of b - 1 and b - 2 cells at 24 hours ( fig. 2a ) , nor was the 24 hour response enhanced by il - 10 neutralization in b - 1p cells ( fig. 2c ) , we hypothesized that the tlr induced il - 10 mediated inhibition does not affect the first or initial rounds of cell division , as it takes time to accumulate high levels of il - 10 .
cfse staining revealed that wild - type b - 1p cells have decreased number of cells in the second and subsequent rounds of cell division when compared to il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells upon lps or cpg stimulation ( fig. 4c ) , which supports our hypothesis .
a cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide ( pi ) staining showed that upon lps stimulation , fewer wild - type b - 1p cells were present in s / g2 / m phase when compared to wild - type b - 1p cells stimulated in the presence of anti - il - 10r antibody or in il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells ( fig. 4d ) .
no significant difference was observed in the b - 2s group with the same treatment ( supplementary fig. s6 ) .
thus , il - 10 appears to arrest b - 1 cell division at the g0 / g1 stage of the cell cycle .
we further analyzed the il - 10 auto - regulatory effect on b - 1p cells in vivo .
to demonstrate the autocrine and paracrine effects of b - 1 cell derived il - 10 , we transferred 3x106 cfse - labeled peritoneal b cells from wild type and il - 10 - / - mice into rag - 1 - / - mice intraperitoneally .
the recipients were challenged with 25 microg / ml lps .
the cfse - labeled b cells were then isolated from the peritoneal cavity and the cfse fluorescence of b - 1a and b - 1b b cells was analyzed .
as shown in fig. 4e total peritoneal b cells as well as b - 1a cells from il - 10 - / - mice exhibited greater proliferation than same subsets from the wild type mice suggesting that il - 10 produced by b - 1a cells can have autocrine inhibitory effects in an in vivo situation .
moreover , b - 1b cells from il - 10 - / - mice also exhibited increased proliferation suggesting that il - 10 from b - 1a cells ( and / or by themselves ) can have paracrine inhibitory effects .
alternate nf - kappab signaling , but not jak / stat signaling , can overcome inhibitory effects of il - 10 on b - 1p cells although cd40 stimulation induced il - 10 production ( 950 pg / ml ) by b - 1p cells , the levels were much lower in comparison to tlr4 stimulation ( 5380 pg / ml ) .
no noticeable differences were found in cd40 induced proliferation of b - 1p and b - 2s cells ( fig. 1a & fig. 1b ) .
moreover , neutralization of il - 10 signals with anti - il - 10r antibody did not change the proliferation response of either b - 1p or b - 2s cells to anti - cd40 ( fig. 5a ) .
hence , we examined if cd40 co - stimulation can overcome the il - 10 mediated inhibition of tlr responses in b - 1p cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0011445.g005 figure 5 cd40 and baff , but not il - 5 , overcome the inhibitory effects of il - 10 .
b - 2s and b - 1p cells were cultured with ( a ) alpha - cd40 ( b ) lps , anti - cd40 or both together ( c ) lps , baff or both together ( d ) lps , il - 5 ( 10 ng / ml ) or both together for 48 hours in the presence or absence of anti - il - 10r antibody .
cell proliferation was measured by 3 [ h ] thymidine incorporation .
results ( shown as mean +/ - sd responses of triplicate cultures ) are representative of three experiments with 8 mice per experiment .
the p - values (* = p < 0.05 , ** = p < 0.005 , *** = p < 0.0005 ) depict significance of difference in the proliferation response with and without anti - il - 10r antibody .
cd40 co - stimulation with lps resulted in a proliferation response that was more than additive , which was not further enhanced upon neutralization of il - 10 signals , but was reduced slightly ( fig. 5b ) .
cd40 signals via both alternate and classical nf - kappab pathways , whereas tlrs signal via the classical nf - kappab pathway [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
in monocytes , exogenous il - 10 inhibits tlr signaling by blocking classical nf - kappab pathways via inhibition of ikappab kinase ( ikk ) activity or p50 / p65 translocation to nucleus , or by selectively inducing nuclear translocation of p50 / p50 homodimer [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
hence , absence of inhibition of cd40 responses could be due to the activation of alternate nf - kappab pathway .
baff , which is critical for survival and maturation of b cells , also signals via the alternate nf - kappab pathway [ 38 ] .
therefore , we examined if baff co - stimulation can overcome the il - 10 mediated inhibition in b - 1 cells .
baff co - stimulation with lps leads to a synergistic proliferation response , which was not enhanced by il - 10 neutralization ( fig. 5c ) .
instead we found a slight decrease in proliferation response of b - 1p cells upon lps co - stimulation with anti - cd40 or baff in the presence of anti - il - 10r antibody .
it is conceivable that in the presence of cd40 and baff , two agents known to stimulate alternate nf - kappab signaling , il - 10 has a prosurvival effect on b cells .
b - 1 cells express the il - 5 receptor and il - 5 acts as a survival and proliferation factor for b - 1 cells by signaling via jak / stat pathway [ 42 ] .
il - 5 co - stimulation with lps resulted in an increase in proliferation response which was significantly enhanced when il - 10 signaling was blocked ( fig. 5d ) .
similar results were obtained with il - 2 and il - 4 ( data not shown ) .
thus , co - stimulation via alternate nf - kappab signaling ( cd40 , baff ) , but not jak / stat signaling ( il - 2 , il - 4 , il - 5 ) , can overcome the il - 10 mediated inhibition of b - 1p cells upon tlr stimulation .
il - 10 inhibits nf - kappab nuclear translocation by preventing lps - induced degradation of ikappabalpha since il - 10 inhibited lps ( known to activate nf - kappab by the classical pathway ) but not cd40 ( known to activate nf - kappab by both classical and non - classical pathways ) induced b - cell growth responses , we tested if il - 10 has differential effects on the two pathways of nf - kappab activation .
we used b - 2 cells for these studies because both b - 2 and b - 1 cells are similarly susceptible to il - 10 mediated inhibition when stimulated with tlrs ( fig. 4b ) .
b - 2s cells were stimulated with lps for indicated time points in the presence or absence of il - 10 ( as described in methods ) .
as shown in fig. 6a , lps stimulation resulted in a time - dependent degradation of ikappabalpha .
in contrast , pretreatment of il - 10 decreased ikappabalpha degradation .
to further elucidate if il - 10 induced blocking of ikappabalpha degradation inhibits rela ( p65 ) translocation into nucleus , we examined the accumulation of rela in the nuclear fraction of lps stimulated cells in the presence or absence of il - 10 .
lps stimulated cells showed increased nuclear translocation of rela compared to il - 10 pretreated cells ( fig. 6b ) .
there was up to a 9 fold increase in nuclear translocation of rela upon lps stimulation in the absence of il - 10 .
however , there was only a 2.5 fold increase in nuclear translocation of rela when cells were pre - incubated with il - 10 ( fig. 6b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0011445.g006 figure 6 effect of il - 10 on lps and cd40 induced nf - kappab activation in b - 2s cells .
lysates from b - 2 s cells at different time points were analyzed by western blot technique as described under " materials and methods . "
( a ) ikappabalpha protein expression in cytoplasmic fractions of lps - stimulated cells .
( b ) rela protein expression in nuclear fractions of lps - stimulated cells .
( c ) relb protein expression in nuclear fractions of cd40 - stimulated cells .
beta - actin and lamin a \ c were used as a control for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions , respectively .
fold difference in the protein expression are represented in line graphs after normalization with loading controls .
as noted above , cd40 signaling can activate nf - kappab by the alternate pathway , which involves translocation of relb into the nucleus .
we confirmed this by showing that relb is found in increased amounts in the nuclear lysates of cd40 - activated b cells ( fig. 6c ) .
treatment with il - 10 did not affect nuclear levels of relb in cd40 stimulated b cells at most time points examined .
at two time points ( 30 ' and 45 ') there was a small decrease in nuclear levels of relb in il - 10 treated cells which was not sustained at the 60 ' time point .
these results all together indicate that pretreatement with il - 10 blocks lps induced classical nf - kappab pathway , via ikappabalpha degradation and rela translocation to nucleus , but not the cd40 induced alternate nf - kappab pathway .
production of il - 10 by b - 1p cells limits clearance of b. hermsii from the blood b - 1p cells play a primary role in the clearance of b. hermsii [ 12 ] .
tlr2 plays a major role in the activation of b cells when they come in contact with b. hermsii lipoproteins and leads to b cell proliferation and differentiation to produce antibodies against b. hermsii lipoproteins [ 43 ] .
even though , tlr2 signaling plays a major role in the activation of b - 1 cells , it is not the only tlr required for response against b. hermsii , as myd88 knockout mice suffer from more severe episodes of bacteremia with b. hermsii than tlr2 knockout mice [ 28 ] .
accordingly , we found that b - 1p cells produce high levels of il - 10 when stimulated with b. hermsii ( fig. 7a ) , as we have shown previously with a synthetic tlr2 ligand ( table 1 ) .
we also found that b. hermsii induced greater proliferation of wild type b - 1p cells upon blocking of il - 10 signaling with alpha - il - 10r antibody ( fig. 7b , left panel ) .
similarly , b - 1p cells from the il - 10 - / - mice proliferated better than wild type mice , presumably via a b. hermsii associated tlr2 ( fig. 7b , right panel ) .
there is also an increase in antibody production by il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells compared to wt b - 1p cells upon b. hermsii stimulation ( fig. 7c ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0011445.g007 figure 7 role of il - 10 in b - 1p cell responses to b. hermsii in vitro and in vivo .
( a ) b - 1p cells from c57bl / 6 mice were cultured with different numbers of live b. hermsii or lps for 48 hours and culture supernatants were analyzed for il - 10 secretion by elisa .
( b ) wild type b - 1p cells in the presence or absence of alpha - il - 10r antibody ( left panel ) or b - 1p cells from c57bl / 6 and il - 10 - / - mice ( right panel ) were cultured with different numbers of live b. hermsii for 48 hours and proliferation was measured by 3 [ h ] thymidine incorporation .
representative results ( mean +/ - sd ) from the one of three experiments are shown ( seven mice per group in each experiment ) .
the statistical significance of difference in response with or without anti - il - 10r antibody or between wild type and il - 10 knockout b - 1p cells is shown by * = p < 0.05 .
( c ) b - 1p cells from c57bl / 6 and il - 10 - / - mice were cultured with different numbers of live b. hermsii for 5 days and total igm production was measured by elisa .
( d ) micromt mice transferred with 2x106 wild - type ( n = 4 ) or il - 10 - / - b - 1p ( n = 5 ) cells were infected with b. hermsii and bacterial numbers in the blood were quantified by dark field microscopy every 24 hours ( left panel ) .
mean values of b. hermsii numbers in each group during the first and second peak ( day - 10 ) of bacteremia are shown in the right panel .
results for the studies in panels b , c and d are from one of two experiments , both of which had similar outcome .
for panel c and d p - value (* = p < 0.05 ) depict significance of difference in response between wt and il - 10 knockout b - 1p cells .
therefore , the ability of b - 1 cells to produce antibody and clear the b. hermsii infection might become restricted due to high levels of il - 10 produced by b - 1 cells .
to test this hypothesis , we adoptively transferred purified b - 1p cells from wild - type or il - 10 - / - mice into cohorts of micromt mice ( b cell deficient mice ) .
the micromt mice cannot eliminate b. hermsii from their blood [ 44 ] .
the control untransferred micromt mice maintained 178x103 bacteria / microl of blood up to 10 days without any relapse .
the b - 1 cells provided by adoptive transfer were sufficient to control b. hermsii , as both groups of adoptively - transferred mice achieved peak bacteremia at day 2 and cleared bacteria by day 5 or 6 .
interestingly , levels of b. hermsii in the blood of mice which received wild - type b - 1p cells were significantly higher than in the mice that received il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells ( days 2 to 4 , fig. 7d ) .
the first bacteremic episode peaked at bacterial densities that were nearly twice as high in mice that received wild - type b - 1p than in mice that received il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells ( p < 0.0005 ; fig. 7d ) .
although there was some mouse to mouse variation , there were no significant differences in the persistence of the first bacteremia episode of either group .
the second bacteremia peak also trended toward higher bacterial densities in the wild - type b - 1 cell transferred group than in the il - 10 - / - b - 1 cell transferred group , but the differences were not statistically significant ( p < 0.11 ; fig.7d ) .
these results indicate that b - 1 cell derived il - 10 plays a significant role during b. hermsii infection and impairs the ability of b - 1 cells to clear b. hermsii from the blood .
discussion studies presented here identified the novel property of autoregulation in the b - 1 b cell subset , wherein il - 10 produced by b - 1 cells inhibits their own functional responses .
we have demonstrated that the tlr induced response of b - 1p cells is less than that of b - 2s cells due to rapid induction of il - 10 , which in turn suppresses the proliferation and differentiation of b - 1p cells .
we used both the anti - il - 10r antibody and il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of il - 10 on tlr responses of b - 1p cells .
the susceptibility to inhibition by il - 10 was not unique to the b - 1 subset , as similar effects were observed in all studied b cell subsets once adequate levels of il - 10 were present .
b - 1p cells were unique in that they produced very high levels of il - 10 leading to a feedback inhibition of their tlr responses and hence we call them " autoregulatory b cells " .
this autoregulatory property of b - 1p cells appears to have a physiological affect in moderating the b - 1 cell responses to bacterial infection .
the inhibitory effect of high doses of il - 10 on b cell proliferation is consistent with previously reported observations that high levels of exogenous il - 10 inhibit proliferation of human leukemic cd5 + b - cells [ 33 ] , superantigen induced t cells [ 45 ] and macrophage proliferation [ 46 ] .
the il - 10 mediated autoregulation is not restricted to tlr responses , since similar effects were also observed in b - 1p cell response to bcr cross - linking ( manuscript in preparation ) .
the rapid and high levels of il - 10 production were observed with all tlr ligands studied except flagellin , a tlr5 ligand , which did not induce a measurable proliferation response .
the b - 1 cell proliferation response to all the tlr ligands was less than that of the b - 2 cell response and in all cases could be enhanced by neutralization of the inhibitory effects of il - 10 .
thus , the il - 10 induction by tlr ligands was seen with both myd88 dependent and independent stimuli .
this may relate to the previously described constitutive expression of stat - 3 by b - 1 cells , a transcription factor required for il - 10 production [ 30 ] .
the transcription factors sp3 , c - maf , irf , creb and nf - kappab have a role in il - 10 transcription [ 47 ] .
moreover , il - 10 has also been shown to be regulated at the level of mrna stability and translation .
future studies will have to determine if any of these factors are also upregulated in the b - 1p cell subset to account for their high il - 10 phenotype .
preliminary studies suggest that activated p38mapkinase may have some role in this , since p38mapk inhibitors partially mimic the anti - il - 10r antibody treatment in enhancing b - 1p cell functional response ( sindhava et al. unpublished data ) .
the production of high levels of il - 10 both constitutively and after tlr signaling was uniquely associated with the b - 1a cell subset and to some extent with the b - 1b b cell subset in the peritoneum .
b - 1a cells showed constitutive il - 10 production , 53 fold higher than peritoneal b - 2 and 5 fold higher than peritoneal b - 1b cells .
upon lps stimulation , b - 1a cells showed the highest il - 10 production among the peritoneal b cell subsets .
this high il - 10 production by b - 1a cells also inhibits their own proliferation in an autocrine manner , whereas lower levels of il - 10 secretion by b - 1b cells is not enough to inhibit their own proliferation upon lps stimulation .
however , in vivo , the high levels of il - 10 produced by b - 1a cells in the peritoneal cavity are capable of suppressing the b - 1b b cell responses as demonstrated by our adoptive transfer experiment ( fig. 4e ) .
thus the il - 10 produced by b - 1a cells can have both autocrine and local paracrine effects .
initially , vh12 tg mice were used as a source of b - 1 cells from the spleen .
b - 1s cells from the mice produced 8 - fold less il - 10 in comparison to b - 1p cells .
sort - purified b - 1s ( b220 + cd5 +) cells from wild - type mice spleens also behaved like vh12 tg b - 1s cells .
accordingly , there was no significant difference in proliferation between vh12 tg b - 1s , wild type b - 1s and wild type littermate b - 2s cells upon lps stimulation .
additionally , the proliferation of b - 1s cells is not affected by the low levels of il - 10 secreted by these cells .
together these results demonstrate that b - 1s cells behave more like a b - 2s cell , rather than b - 1p cells , in terms of il - 10 production and proliferation .
these results do not contradict the identification of il - 10 producing b10 cells in spleen by yanaba et al .
[ 6 ] .
we do find il - 10 production by splenic b - 1 cells but quantitatively it is less than that induced by peritoneal b - 1a cells .
since the b - 1s cells from wild - type mice or vh12 tg mice do not exhibit high il - 10 secretion , it is likely that the peritoneal environment has a unique role in the ability of b - 1p cells to produce il - 10 .
previously , chumely et al. as well as stoermann et al. have described the existence of factors in the peritoneum that affect the special characteristics of b - 1p cells [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
the above described constitutive stat - 3 expression may also have a role in il - 10 production by b - 1p cells , although stat - 3 expression has been found to be an intrinsic but not an induced property of b - 1p cells [ 30 ] .
since b1p cells have a major role in mucosal iga production , it will be interesting to determine if b cells from the mucosal sites also share the property of high il - 10 production with b - 1p cells and how they escape the inhibitory effects of il - 10 to produce large quantities of iga .
among b cell subsets , marginal zone b cells and transitional 2 b cells , as well as the recently described splenic b10 cell subset , have all been reported to produce il - 10 [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
the b10 subset expresses cd5 and high levels of cd1d , but cd1d expression is not required for il - 10 production as b - 1p cells do not express cd1d [ 50 ] .
most of the previous studies used rt - pcr or intracytoplasmic staining , techniques which do not allow for accurate quantification of the secreted il - 10 and thus were unable to appreciate the significant differences between the levels of il - 10 produced by the various b cell subsets .
in a side by side comparison , our studies found that the peritoneal b - 1a subset produced more il - 10 than follicular b cells , marginal zone b cells and b - 1s cells .
not only do b - 1p cells produce high levels of il - 10 , but they also exhibit accelerated kinetics , which allows for rapid accumulation of il - 10 in cultures and leading to inhibition of the tlr response .
the effect of il - 10 is mainly on the activation of nf - kappab by the classical pathway , since il - 10 inhibited the nuclear translocation of lps - induced p65 but not of cd40 - induced p52 .
this explains why stimuli such as cd40 and baff that can signal via the alternate nf - kappab pathway are able to overcome the inhibitory effects of il - 10 on tlr responses .
future studies will determine if il - 10 inhibits the upstream nik , but not the mekk3 , that are pivotal points that distinguish classical and alternate pathways of nf - kappab activation .
several studies have demonstrated that il - 10 can decrease the antimicrobial activities of immune cells .
there are also reports that mice in which il - 10 affect has been neutralized show enhanced abilities to clear pathogens such as streptococcus , listeria and mycobacterium species , when compared to mice with functionally active il - 10 [ 51 ] .
in many of these studies , il - 10 has been shown to affect several cell types , including cd4 + t cells and macrophages .
clearance of the relapsing fever causing bacterium , b. hermsii , is dependent upon b - 1p cells : mice deficient in tlr1 , tlr2 , or the tlr adaptor protein myd88 generated anti - b. hermsii igm with delayed kinetics and suffered more severe episodes of bacteremia [ 28 ] .
the present study found that il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells proliferated to significantly higher levels than did wild - type b - 1p cells upon b. hermsii exposure in vitro , which is due to autoregulation by induced il - 10 production by wild type b - 1p cells .
lazarus et al. observed that il - 10 - / - mice are more effective at controlling b. burgdorferi , the lyme disease agent , which was attributed to a lack of il - 10 suppression of non - b - cells [ 52 ] .
here we showed that il - 10 - / - b - 1p cells were significantly better than wild - type b - 1p cells in controlling b. hermsii infection of micromt mice .
although the effects of il - 10 on myeloid cells may also be important , we also have to consider the direct impact of il - 10 on b cell production of antibodies .
in our adoptive transfer system , b - 1p cells were the only cells that differed in their ability to produce il - 10 as the non b cells in the host were competent to produce il - 10 .
b - 1b cells have been shown to be more important than b - 1a cells in antibody production against borrelia species [ 12 ] .
since we used unseparated b - 1 cells from wild - type and il - 10 deficient mice , it is conceivable that in vivo b - 1b cells also produce high levels of il - 10 .
alternatively , large quantities of il - 10 produced by peritoneal b - 1a cells inhibit anti - borrelia antibody production by the b - 1b cells , which are also present in the peritoneal cavity , as demonstrated by our rag - 1 - / - transfer experiment shown in fig. 4e .
we will have to evaluate this phenomenon in infections with other bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae where b - 1a cells produce the innate antibody response and the b - 1b cells produce the adoptive antibody response [ 11 ] .
b - 1 cells have been known to secrete antibodies to single stranded dna , red blood cell surface molecules and several other self antigens .
in the rheumatoid factor transgenic mouse model , marshak - rothstein and colleagues have shown that tlr9 signaling via dna from dying cells is a critical factor for activation of self - reactive b cells [ 29 ] .
also , baff and myd88 signaling has been shown to promote lupus like disease independent of t cells [ 53 ] .
here we showed that baff can overcome il - 10 induced down regulation of b - 1 cell responses .
excess tlr activation as seen in yaa mice with tlr7 duplication or tlr7 transgenic mice also leads to autoimmunity [ 54 ] .
conceivably , the autoregulatory properties of b - 1 cells described here may play a role in healthy individuals in preventing excessive activation of self - reactive b cells via tlr stimulation .

cells were fixed in 70 % ( v / v ) ethanol for at least 1 h at 4degreesc , after which the cells were incubated in a mixture of 1 microg / ml propidium iodine ( pi ) ( sigma - aldrich ) and 25 microg / ml rnase a ( sigma - aldrich ) at 37degreesc for at least 30 min .
the level of pi fluorescence was measured with a moflo flow cytometer .
cell populations at subg1 , g1 , s , g2 / m phase were calculated using the program modfit .
quantitative real - time pcr total rna was isolated from purified b - 1p and b - 2s cells ( 5x106 ) with the rna miniprep ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) .
rna was quantified at od260 using a beckman du 530 life science uv spectrophotometer ( beckman coulter inc , ca ) and 2 microg of total rna was subsequently used to make cdna using the superscript ii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen corp. , carlsbad , ca ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
rt - pcr was performed on an abi prism 7000 system ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) .
primers for murine tlrs were used as reported previously [ 57 ] .
the gapdh - specific primers were used for loading control ( idt technologies , corallevielle , ia ) .
peritoneal cell transfer and lps administration a total of 3x106 cfse - labeled wild type or il - 10 - \ - peritoneal b cells were intraperitoneally injected into rag - 1 - / - mice .
rag - 1 - / - mice transferred with wild type peritoneal b cells or il - 10 - \ - peritoneal b cells were intraperitoneally injected with either 250 microl of pbs ( n = 4 ) or 250 microl of lps ( 100 microg / ml ) ( n = 4 ) 2 hours after b cell - administration .
total peritoneal cells were recovered from each mouse after 60 hours of pbs or lps injection and subjected to flow cytometry .
western blot analysis b - 2s cells ( 10x106 ) , pre - incubated with or without il - 10 ( 5 ng / ml , 12 hours ) , were stimulated with lps ( 5 microg / ml ) or anti - cd40 ( 1:1000 ) ascites for the indicated time .
cell pellets were lysed in a nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent ( thermo scientific ) , proteins separated by sds - page and processed for western blotting .
the blots were developed with hyglo chemiluminescence substrate ( denville scientific ) , exposed to kodak x - omat films and analyzed by an eastman kodak image station 2000rt .
for re - probing , membranes were stripped using a solution containing 62.5 mm tris - hcl , 2 % sds , and 100 mm a - mercaptoethanol at 50degreesc for 30 min .
infection and quantification of b. hermsii in mice b. hermsii isolate dah was obtained from dr. tom schwan ( rocky mountain laboratories , nih , hamilton , mt , usa ) .
efficient experimental b. hermsii infection is best achieved using host - adapted spirochetes , i.e. bacteria taken directly from the blood of other infected mice [ 44 ] , [ 58 ] .
8 - 12 week old c57bl / 6 wild - type mice (" donors ") were infected by intraperitoneal injection with 5x105 b. hermsii dah from a mid - exponential phase culture .
at the peak of the first bacteremia , the donor mice were euthanized and exsanguinated .
donor mouse blood in citrate buffer was pooled and bacterial concentration determined by darkfield microscopy using a petroff - hausser counting chamber .
two cohorts of b cell - deficient ( micromt ) mice were adoptively transferred with b - 1p cells ( 2x106 cells / mouse ) purified from either wild - type or il - 10 - / - mice .
one week after transfer , the mice were infected by intraperitoneal injection of 3x105 b. hermsii harvested freshly from donor mice .
micromt mice that had not undergone adoptive transfer were likewise infected with b. hermsii , as a control .
densities of b. hermsii in infected mouse blood were quantified every 24 hours as described by alugupalli et al .
[ 12 ] .
statistical analysis paired student 's t - test was used to determine statistical significance of differences between various groups .
supporting information figure s1 b2s and b1p were plated at a cell density of 10e5 cells / well and stimulated with lps ( 5 microg / ml ) .

background pancreatic duct obstructions are common in patients with pancreaticoduodenectomy .
however , it is often neglected in follow up. this study was to review the outcomes of pancreatic duct obstruction and explore the prevention of pancreatic duct obstruction .
methods a retrospective analysis of 78 patients undergoing pancreaticojejunostomy without reccurence of disease within 24 months between 2004 and 2014 .
pancreatic duct obstruction and long - term pancreatic complications were analysed .
results twenty - five patients developed pancreatic duct obstruction following pancreaticojejunostomy , 13 of whom were found to have long - term pancreatic complications .
the presence of pancreatic duct obstruction and early pancreatic obstruction were associated with long - term pancreatic complications , respectively ( p = 0.002 , p = 0.002 ) .
there are 10 patients with pancreatic duct stent more than 24 months , the postoperative median pancreatic parenchymal thickness in these 10 patients ( 17.1 mm , range 8.0 to 24.7 mm ) was not significantly change than the median in them preoperative ( 16.4 mm , range 7.2 to 24.7 mm ; p = 0.747 ) .

z171100001017121 xiu dianrong issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background pancreaticoduodenectomy ( pd ) has been established as an indication for periampullary lesions .
recent progress in surgical techniques and postoperative management have improved morbidity and motality of patients treated with pd [ 1 ] .
on the contrary , long - term pancreatic complications such as endocrine and exocrine insufficiency have become important problems in the late postoperative period for patients with pd [ 2 - 4 ] .
in fact , little is known about the course of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency after resection of pancreatic tumors [ 5 , 6 ] , and the diagnosis of exocrine function is either complex or lack specificity [ 7 ] .
some studies of long - term results for patients with pd revealed that pancreatic endocrine and exocrine insufficiency may due to postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction , suggesting that the concern of postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction is essential [ 4 , 8 , 9 ] .
in addition to endocrine and exocrine insufficiency , postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction may also cause pain , pancreatic duct stone and acute pancreatitis [ 10 - 13 ] .
however , little has been investigated on early prediction and prevention of long - term pancreaticojejunostomy complications .
so we aim to report the incidence of postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction , analyze if early pancreatic duct obstruction predicts long - term pancreatic complications and explore whether sustained pancreatic stent tube prevent pancreatic duct obstruction in patients who underwent pd or segment resection of pancreas with end - to - end invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy .
methods study patients with approval of the clinical ethics committee of peking university third hospital , the patients' data were analyzed anonymously because written consent was not obtained from all participants .
pancreaticoduodenectomy or segment resection of pancrea with invaginated end - to - end panceaticojejunostomy was performed for pancreatic , periampullary , biliary , or duodenal diseases in 341 patients between january 2004 and december 2014 .
seventy - eight of them consisting of the following characteristics were enrolled in this study .
they all had no relapse within 24 months and received a continued pancreas protocol computed tomography ( ct ) at our institution .
all the ct data are store and analyzed in our picture archiving and communication system ( pacs ) .
similar procedures were performed by a single team of experienced pancreatic surgeons .
all patients underwent end - to - end invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy for reconstruction of the pancreatic stump by the same surgeon .
all pancreaticojejunostomy consisted of two - layer sutures , the inner layer anastomosis was performed in a capsule - to - full - thickness fashion and the outer layer anastomosis in a capsule - to - seromuscular fashion after the main pancreatic duct inserted by a matching pancreatic stent tube .
specially , in our centre , for patients with suspected pathology of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( pdac ) during operation , i125 radioactive seeds were implanted in the area surrounded superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) in 3 patients .
definition and treatment of long - term pancreatic complications assessment of long - term pancreatic function to assess new - onset pancreatic exocrine insufficiency , the presence of steatorrhea was asked in clinics .
clinical steatorrhea was defined by more than 3 times pasty or greasy stool per day after fatty meals or it is necessary to take pancreatic enzyme to solve their symptoms associated with dyspepsia .
patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency before the operation were excluded during the analysis for new - onset pancreatic exocrine insufficiency .
the endocrine function was defined by fasting blood glucose level and glycohemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) without administration of an oral hypoglycemic agent or insulin .
a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was made based on the criteria set by the 1985 world health organization study group on diabetes mellitus [ 11 ] .
patients with diabetes diagnosed before the operation were excluded during the analysis for new - onset diabetes .
assessment of pancreatic obstruction associated pain or pancreatitis recurrence of abdominal pain and pancreatitis ( episodic epigastric and back pain ; biochemical pancreatitis ) was defined as pancreatic obstruction associated pain or pancreatitis .
treatment of patients with long - term pancreatic complications patient with recurrent abdominal pain and pancreatitis underwent endoscopic treatment or long - acting octreotide .
patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency were given daily pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and new - onset diabetes given insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs .
morphological changes of the remnant pancreas and definition of pancreatic duct obstruction preoperative and postoperative pancreatic remnant changes were evaluated by computed tomography ( ct ) images at our institution pacs .
diameter of the main pancreatic duct ( mpd ) and thickness of the pancreas were measured on enhanced computed tomography images ( fig. 1 ) .
pancreatic duct obstruction was defined by the mpd >= 3 mm. the patients were divided into two groups based on the dilation of main pancreatic duct .
parenchymal thickness was calculated by substracting the pancreatic duct diameter from the total gland thickness. fig. 1 diameter of the main pancreatic duct ( mpd ) ( d ) and thickness of the pancreas ( t ) were measured on enhanced computed tomography images .
preoperatively , the values were measured along the line at the left edge of the superior mesenteric vein ( smv ) .
postoperatively , the parameters were measured at the same area in the remnant pancreas .
the degree of pancreatic atrophy was calculated by the results of t - d. note : dotted line indicates the thickness of the pancreas ; continuous line indicates diameter of the main pancreatic duct especially , early pancreatic duct obstruction is evaluated in patients with postoperative ct pancreatic remnant changes within 12 months after operation .
pancreatic atrophy is defined by obvious remnant parenchymal thickness decline ( thickness decline >= 1 / 2 ) .
statistical analysis we analyzed the perioperative factors in all 78 patients to identify the risk factors of long - term pancreatic complications after end - to - end invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy .
the pancreatic duct diameters were expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation or medians and ranges .
the independent two sample t test was used for continuous data .
categorical data were compared by a chi - square test or fisher 's test when necessary .
multivariate analysis was performed using multiple logistic regression models .
a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant , and odds ratios for multivariate analysis were reported with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals .
the statistical analyses were performed with version 21.0 spss software ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) .
results among the 78 patients with pancreaticojejunostomy , 73 patients underwent pd and 5 patients segment resection of pancreas , and 63 of them had ct data evaluating early pancreatic duct obstruction that was recorded in our pacs .
based on the criteria of mpd >= 3 mm , there are 32 patients with preoperative pancreatic duct obstruction and 7 patients with preoperative long - term pancreatic complications , the difference is significant between preoperative pancreatic duct obstruction and preoperative long - term pancreatic complications ( p = 0.038 ) .
demographics , postoperative long - term pancreatic complications occurrence , and predictors of postoperative long - term pancreatic complications the mean age of the 78 patients was 56 years ( range 14 to 78 years ) , and 47 of the 78 ( 60 %) patients were male .
seventy - three patients ( 94 %) underwent pd , compared with 5 ( 6 %) who underwent segment resection of pancreas with invaginated end - to - end panceaticojejunostomy for the distal pancreatic stump .
thirty - five ( 45 %) patients were benign disases .
long - term pancreatic complications occurred in 18 ( 23 %) patients , including 2 patients with preoperative exocrine insufficency , 5 patients with concomitant complications , consisting of 11 new on - set pancreatic exocrine insufficiency , 4 new on - set diabetes and 8 recurrent pain / pancreatitis ( table 1 ) .
among them , the median interval between the operation and the occurrence of postoperative complications are 24 months ( range 8 to 36 months ) .

there was no statistically significant relationship between all other variables and long - term pancreatic complications , including pathology , pancreatic fistula , type of operation ( pd or segment pancreatic resection ) , i125 radioactive seeds implantation and pancreatic duct stent retained > 2 years .
on multivariate analysis , postoperative pancreatic duct diameter >= 3 mm ( p = 0.002 ) and postoperative pancreatic parenchymal atrophy ( p = 0.001 ) were remained the significant predictor of long - term pancreatic complications ( table 2 ) .

among the 63 patients , there are 13 patients with postoperative long - term pancreatic complications in the follow up. further analysis demonstrated that the median pancreatic duct diameter in the 13 patients with long - term pancreatic complications ( 4.1 mm , range 1.3 to 7.0 mm ) was significantly higher than the median in those without ( 1.9 mm , range 1.0 to 10.0 mm ; p = 0.002 ) .
the early pancreatic duct obstruction correlated well with postoperative long - term pancreatic complications ( p = 0.002 ) .
patient demographics and perioperative variables for patients with and without postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction the 2 groups ( patients who had postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction vs those who did not ) were similar with respect to patient demographics and perioperative variables ( table 3 ) .
there was no significant difference in patient age or sex , preoperative pancreatic duct diameter , type of operation , i125 radioactive seeds implantation , pancreatic fistula , adjuvant therapy and pancreatic duct stent retained more than 2 years .
the only variable found to be statistically different between the 2 groups was postoperative pancreatic parenchymal thickness , 9.5 +/ - 4.1 mm compared with 14.1 +/ - 4.9 mm ( p < 0.001 ) .

treatment of patients with long - term pancreatic complications one patient with recurrent abdominal pain and pancreatitis underwent endoscopic treatment , pancreatic duct stricture was detected and an internal pancreatic stent tube was placed in the pancreatic duct , the symptom was relieved after that .
the other remaining 7 patients with symptom relieved after long - acting octreotide therapy or octreotide combined with other medicine .
eleven patients with pancreatic exocrine insufficiency were given daily pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and 4 patients with new - onset diabetes were given insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs .
the characteristics of 10 patients with pancreatic duct stent more than 24 months so far , there are 17 patients have sustained internal stent tube , with a median interval of 24 months ( range 12 to 120 months ) , while in the remaining 61 patients with internal stent tube fall off , when 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 months serve as the checklist reference , 28 patients have available fall off time interval during the previous checklist reference , and 24 of them lost their stent tube within 6 months .
considering that all 10 patients with pancreatic duct stent more than 24 months have no long - term pancreatic complications , though the difference was not significantly compared with the group with no pancreatic duct stent more than 24 months ( p = 0.068 ) .
a further analysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of sustained pancreatic duct stent in preventing long - term pancreatic complications .
the postoperative median pancreatic duct diameter in the 10 patients with pancreatic duct stent more than 24 months ( 2.0 mm , range 1.0 to 4.3 mm ) was lower than the median in them preoperative ( 2.2 mm , range 1.1 to 7.0 mm ) .
furthermore , the postoperative median pancreatic parenchymal thickness in the 10 patients with pancreatic duct stent more than 24 months ( 17.1 mm , range 8.0 to 24.7 mm ) was not significantly change than the median in them preoperative ( 16.4 mm , range 7.2 to 24.7 mm ; p = 0.747 ) .
discussion this work presents early postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction as a potentially simple tool by which the pancreatic surgeon may predict and ahead of time treat their patients following pancreaticojejunostomy with long - term pancreatic complications .
furthermore , presumes that sustained internal pancreatic duct stent may prevent the occurrence of pancreatic duct obstruction .
first , postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction is an indicator for postoperative long - term pancreatic complications .
our results demonstrate that the statistical difference is significant between pancreatic duct obstruction and long - term pancreatic complications , regardless preoperatively ( p = 0.038 ) or postoperatively ( p = 0.002 ) .
this result is in accordance with previous studies [ 4 , 8 , 9 ] , which speculated that pancreatic duct obstruction maybe a cause of long - term pancreatic complications including exocrine and endocrine insufficency .
although the overall exocrine pancreatic function is also influenced by the pancreatic stimulus , more attention has been paid on the pancreatic remnant reserve and pancreatic duct outflow [ 5 , 9 , 14 , 15 ] .
in our study cohort , there were 5 patients underwent segment resection of pancreas , the statistical difference is no significant compared with patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy in long - term pancreatic complications ( p = 0.326 ) .
but postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction and postoperative pancreatic remnant atrophy are statistically different in patients with or without long - term pancreatic complications ( p = 0.002 , p = 0.001 ) .
those results seem to support the importance of remnant reserve and pancreatic duct outflow in pancreatic function .
there is no definite evidence proves that pancreatic duct obstruction is a cause of remnant reserve .
our results exhibited that pancreatic duct obstruction associated with pancreatic atrophy ( p = 0.001 ) .
so , postoperative pancreatic duct obstruction may cause or at least partially postoperative long - term pancreatic complications .
second , considering most patients develop pancreatic duct obstruction within 12 month ( 9 / 14 ) , and only one pancreatic duct obstruction recovered in the follow up , so we infer that pancreatic duct obstruction occurred early after operation and the spontaneous obstruction relief is rare .
so , based on the previous results , we inferred that early pancreatic duct obstruction may predict long - term pancreatic complications after pancreaticojejunostomy .
in our 64 patients with postoperative ct pancreatic remnant changes within 12 months after operation , patients with early pancreatic duct obstruction tend to develop long - term pancreatic complications ( p = 0.001 ) .
throughout the past decade , several studies have explored the use of pancreatic duct obstruction to predict long - term pancreatic complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy [ 4 , 8 - 11 ] .
although methods differ between studies , and only one author has evaluated early pancreatic duct obstruction is a predictor for long - term pancreatic complications [ 4 ] , these results indicated that early pancreatic duct obstruction may serve as a simple tool in predicting postoperative long - term pancreatic obstruction .
third , duration of the internal pancreatic stent may protect the pancreatic duct obstruction .
as we have demonstrate that pancreatic duct obstruction may cause pancreatic remnant atrophy and following long - term pancreatic complications , so we presume that preventing pancreatic duct obstruction is likely to decrease the rate of long - term pancreatic complications .
in our study group , there are 10 patients with internal pancreatic stent more than 24 months , the postoperative pancreatic parenchymal thickness in these 10 patients was not significantly change than preoperative ( p = 0.747 ). and these patients have no long - term pancreatic complications , though the difference was not significantly compared with the group with no pancreatic duct stent more than 24 months ( p = 0.068 ) .
so , we assumed that the internal pancreatic stent for pancreatic duct might offer a potential deduction of pancreatic duct obstruction and following long - term pancreatic complications .
notwithstanding the data from murakami m demonstrated that [ 4 ] pancreatic duct tube seems to be ineffective for resolving anastomotic stricture , their studies did not present the duration of the pancreatic duct tube , and since 2015 we have taken nonabsorbable suture material in fixation of internal pancreatic duct stent tube in our center , further outcomes will confirm the feasibility of sustained internal pancreatic stent tube in preventing of long - term pancreatic complication .
there are some limitations to our study .
first , with 78 patients eligible for inclusion , the sample size is relatively small , more data will be needed to validate the results from this study .
second , due to the lack of objective method to evaluate long - term pancreatic complications , we take the relative subjective method to define long - term complications , although they were also taken by other studies [ 10 , 11 ] .
however , there were three different points between our study and previous studies .
first , the technical approach in anastomosis of pancreaticojejunostomy , we all took invaginated end - to - end pancreaticojejunostomy , excluding the bias in anastomosis of pancreatic remnant .
second , importantly the metric we investigated , main pancreatic duct thickness on pre - and postoperative ct scans , is readily available and easily translatable to current clinical practice making our results immediately applicable .
third , we assumed that the sustained internal pancreatic stent tube for pancreatic duct might offer a potential deduction of pancreatic duct obstruction and following long - term pancreatic complications .
conclusions in conclusion , the incidence of pancreatic duct obstruction after pd with end - to - end invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy is common .
this study serves as the first to date demonstrating the relationship between pancreatic duct obstruciton and long - term complications after pd with end - to - end invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy .
moreover , this study demonstrates that most pancreatic duct obstruction occurs within 12 months .
therefore , early pancreatic duct obstruction is a simple tool to screen high risk patients with the tendency to develop long - term pancreatic complications .
furthermore , sustained internal pancreatic duct stent may prevent the occurrence of pancreatic duct obstruction .
although the studies conducted so far have included low numbers of patients and have been unable to draw firm conclusions .

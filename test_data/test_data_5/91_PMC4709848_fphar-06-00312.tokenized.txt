taqman ( tm ) genotyping assays are widely used to genotype cyp2d6 , which encodes a major drug metabolizing enzyme .
assay design for cyp2d6 can be challenging owing to the presence of two pseudogenes , cyp2d7 and cyp2d8 , structural and copy number variation and numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) some of which reflect the wild - type sequence of the cyp2d7 pseudogene .
the aim of this study was to identify the mechanism causing false - positive cyp2d6 * 15 calls and remediate those by redesigning and validating alternative taqman genotype assays .
among 13,866 dna samples genotyped by the companiondx ( r ) lab on the openarray platform , 70 samples were identified as heterozygotes for 137tins , the key snp of cyp2d6 * 15 .
however , only 15 samples were confirmed when tested with the luminex xtag cyp2d6 kit and sequencing of cyp2d6 - specific long range ( xl ) - pcr products .
genotype and gene resequencing of cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 - specific xl - pcr products revealed a cc > gt dinucleotide snp in exon 1 of cyp2d7 that reverts the sequence to cyp2d6 and allows a taqman assay pcr primer to bind .
because cyp2d7 also carries a tins , a false - positive mutation signal is generated .
this cyp2d7 snp was also responsible for generating false - positive signals for rs769258 ( cyp2d6 * 35 ) which is also located in exon 1 .
although alternative cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 assays resolved the issue , we discovered a novel cyp2d6 * 15 subvariant in one sample that carries additional snps preventing detection with the alternate assay .
the frequency of cyp2d6 * 15 was 0.1 % in this ethnically diverse u.s. population sample .
in addition , we also discovered linkage between the cyp2d7 cc > gt dinucleotide snp and the 77g > a ( rs28371696 ) snp of cyp2d6 * 43 .
the frequency of this tentatively functional allele was 0.2 % .
taken together , these findings emphasize that regardless of how careful genotyping assays are designed and evaluated before being commercially marketed , rare or unknown snps underneath primer and / or probe regions can impact the performance of pcr - based genotype assays , including taqman .
regardless of the test platform used , it is prudent to confirm rare allele calls by an independent method .
cyp2d6 cyp2d7 taqman genotyping cyp2d6 * 15 cyp2d6 * 35 cyp2d6 * 43 introduction taqman genotyping assays are widely used within research and clinical testing laboratories .
due to the availability of pre - designed assays , genotyping using this technology is relatively straight forward , allows customization of individual assays into panels ( such as the openarray platform , thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma ) and is automatable ( mein et al. , 2000 ; ranade et al. , 2001 ; johnson et al. , 2012 ; fedick et al. , 2013 ) .
owing to these advantages , taqman technology is widely employed for cyp2d6 genotype analysis .
among all drug metabolizing enzymes , cyp2d6 is probably the most structurally and genotypically complex , and extensively studied gene ( zanger et al. , 2004 , 2008 ; ingelman - sundberg , 2005 ; ingelman - sundberg et al. , 2007 ; ingelman - sundberg and sim , 2010 ; teh and bertilsson , 2012 ; zanger and schwab , 2013 ) .
it metabolizes numerous clinically - used drugs , including many antidepressants , antipsychotics , and opioids ( zhou , 2009a,b ) .
pre - emptive cyp2d6 genotype testing is increasingly used to guide therapy ( dunnenberger et al. , 2015 ) , or used to explain adverse drug reactions or treatment failure after treatment initiation ( zhou et al. , 2015 ) .
assay design for cyp2d6 , however , is arduous due to the presence of two pseudogenes , cyp2d7 and cyp2d8 , within the gene locus , structural and copy number variation and the presence of numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and insertion / deletion variations ( collectively referred here as snps ; gaedigk , 2013 ) .
hence , it is challenging to identify genome - unique regions in the vicinity of target snps to design robust taqman genotyping assays .
snps located underneath a primer or taqman probe binding site can affect an assay 's performance .
as recently reported , snps within the amplicon can also impact assay performance ( gaedigk et al. , 2015a ) .
although most test panels include only the snps defining the most common cyp2d6 alleles , others routinely test for rare or extremely rare alleles , including cyp2d6 * 15 ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / gtr /) .
this allele is characterized by a nucleotide insertion in exon 1 ( 137tins ) that causes a frameshift and leads to premature translation termination. of note , per definition the cyp2d7 gene also carries two ts at the homologous position , which is a hallmark feature rendering this pseudogene nonfunctional .
cyp2d6 * 15 was first described in a german population ( sachse et al. , 1996 ) , but it has not been detected in other european populations .
although data for this allele are sparse , it has been reported in brazilians of european ancestry ( kohlrausch et al. , 2009 ) , lengua native americans of paraguay ( bailliet et al. , 2007 ) and a mexican population ( alcazar - gonzalez et al. , 2013 ) , but not in other world populations .
based on the available literature , this nonfunctional allele has an extremely low frequency of < 0.5 % .
a summary of allele frequencies can be found in clinical pharmacogenetics implementation consortium ( cpic ) guidelines ( hicks et al. , 2013 , 2015 ; crews et al. , 2014 ) or via the web at http :// www.pharmgkb.org / download.action ? filename = cyp2d6 _ frequency _ table _ and _ legend _ r3.pdf .
due to the rarity of certain alleles , it is therefore difficult to get hold of gdna reference material for assay development and quality control .
consequently , it is important to verify assay results to avoid reporting false - positive results that may cause wrongful genotype assignments and may lead to inaccurate predictions of a subject 's phenotype status .
in contrast to cyp2d6 * 15 , the cyp2d6 * 35 allele is more commonly observed .
the latter can be identified by a snp that is also located in exon 1 and represents a " key " allelic feature for identification ( 31g > a , rs769258 , v11m ) .
this snp was first reported in 1997 ( marez et al. , 1997 ) and is most commonly noted in europeans with an average frequency of 6 % .
its frequency is much lower or absent in other populations .
cyp2d6 * 35 is often not tested for because it is deemed fully functional .
in the absence of testing for this variant , a cyp2d6 * 1 or * 2 will be assigned by " default " depending on test design .
taqman assays were extensively validated by companiondx ( r ) using coriell dna and hundreds of dna samples which were confirmed by orthogonal methods such as the luminex xtag cyp2d6 platform and sanger sequencing .
no false - negative calls were detected during these validation efforts .
subsequently , however , we identified samples testing positive for the cyp2d6 * 15 allele ( 137tins ) in a large cohort of subjects residing in the u.s. verification of the results with alternative methods uncovered false - positive cyp2d6 * 15 calls .
the aim of this study was to identify the factors responsible for the false - positive genotype calls and to remediate those by redesigning and validating alternative taqman genotype assays .
materials and methods subjects and samples dna was isolated from buccal swab samples of a large , ethnically diverse u.s. population of 13,866 consecutive subjects ( n = 27 , 740 alleles ) .
samples from 20 subjects who gave written informed consent and had positive taqman cyp2d6 * 15 calls , were selected for follow - up studies ( table 1 ) .
due to limited amounts of gdna , whole genome amplification ( wga ) was performed using 15 ng of gdna and the genomiphi dna amplification kit ( ge healthcare life sciences , pittsburgh , pa usa ) as recommended by the supplier .
wga - dna was diluted 1:25 - fold for subsequent testing of taqman genotype assay performance .

na17128 was obtained from the coriell institute for medical research ( camden , nj ) .
two de - identified dna samples from a repository maintained at children 's mercy ( pgx - a and b ) served as controls .
the use of repository samples was approved by the institutional review board of children 's mercy kansas city .
taqman genotyping initial genotype analysis of the 13,866 samples was performed with commercially available taqman assays using the openarray platform on a quantstudio 12k flex instrument ( thermo fisher scientific ; formerly life technologies , grand island , ny ) .
the openarray included assays testing of the following snps : - 1584c > g ( rs1080985 ) , 100c > t ( rs1065852 ) , 124g > a ( rs5030862 ) , 137tins ( rs72549357 ) , 883g > c ( rs201377835 ) , 1023c > t ( rs28371706 ) , 1707t > del ( rs5030655 ) , 1758g > t / a ( rs5030865 ) , 1846g > a ( rs3892097 ) , 2549dela ( rs35742686 ) , 2613 _ 2615delaga ( rs5030656 ) , 2850c > t ( rs1694700 , 2935a > c ( rs5030867 ) , 2988g > a ( rs28371725 ) , and 4180g > c ( rs1135840 ) .
cyp2d6 * 15 ( 137tins ) was detected using taqman assay id c __ 32407245 _ 40 .
follow - up taqman genotyping for cyp2d6 * 15 ( 137tins ; assay id c __ 32407245 _ 40 ) and * 35 ( 31g > a , rs769258 ; assay id c _ 27102444 _ 80 ) was performed on a quantstudio 12k flex instrument using 96 - well plates and the taqman genotyping mastermix mix ( thermo fisher scientific - life technologies , grand island , ny ) as recommended by the manufacturer .
follow up studies were also conducted with alternative assays for cyp2d6 * 15 and cyp2d6 * 35 ( to be commercialized with assay ids c __ 32407245 _ 60 and c _ 27102444 _ f0 , respectively ) .
the pcr primers in these redesigned assays were moved to alternate binding sites flanking each mutation , which contained nucleotide differences between cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 sequences to drive cyp2d6 - specific amplification and avoid nonspecific amplification of cyp2d7 caused by primer overlap with the cyp2d7 rs386821512 snp in the original assays .
assay performance was tested on gdna , wga - dna and cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 xl - pcr templates using the 96 - well format as described below .
in addition , a custom taqman snp genotyping assay to detect 77g > a , which is part of the cyp2d6 * 43 and * 46 haplotypes , was run on cyp2d6 xl - pcr templates .
long - range ( xl ) - pcr was performed to specifically amplify the cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 genes in their entirety .
briefly , cyp2d6 - specific , 6.6 or 6.7 kb long fragments were generated with primers pairs forward 5 ' ggctccaagcatggcagctgc and reverse 5'cgactgagccctgggaggtaggtag and forward 5 ' tcacccccagcggacttatcaacc and reverse 5'cgactgagccctgggaggtaggtag , respectively , essentially as previously described ; this fragment is referred to as fragment a in previous reports ( gaedigk et al. , 2007 , 2015b ) .
the 6.6 kb - long fragment was used for sequence - based confirmation of cyp2d6 * 15 taqman assay results ; the 6.7 kb long fragment a , which amplifies more robustly , was generated for all other follow - up studies and evaluation of the alternate taqman genotyping assays .
the 4.4 kb long fragment for cyp2d7 was generated with primers 5 ' tccgaccaggcctttctaccac and 5 ' caccagaaagctgacgacacgaga .
an 8 mul reaction contained 15 ng gdna , 5 % dmso , 500 nm of each primer , and a 1x final concentration of kapa long range hotstart master mix ( kapa biosystems , wilmington , ma ) .
pcr cycling parameters included an initial denaturation for 3 min at 94degreesc , followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94degreesc for 20 s , annealing at 68degreesc for 30 s and extension at 68degreesc for 7 min .
to assure cyp2d6 or cyp2d7 amplicon generation , 2 mul aliquots were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis .
pcr fragments were diluted 2000 - fold with 10 mm tris ph 7 to serve as templates in taqman and high resolution melt ( hrm ) assays .
luminex genotyping to confirm cyp2d6 * 15 - positive results , genotyping was conducted on the fda - cleared luminex platform with the xtag cyp2d6 kit v3 ( luminex corporation , austin , tx ) following the provided protocol .
briefly , the assay incorporates multiple pcr reactions and allele - specific primer extension assays .
all assays were read on the luminex lx200 device using is 3.1.971 software and the data were analyzed by xtag cyp2d6 v3 data analysis software version 1.22 .
additional assay details including the alleles tested can be found at the company 's website .
this platform was chosen because it utilizes a different snp detection technology than taqman .
dna sequencing for confirmation , a 6.6 kb long fragment a was generated from 66 of the 70 samples that were found positive for cyp2d6 * 15 and partially sequenced over the exon 1 region harboring the 137tins .
cyp2d6 exon 1 was amplified using the predesigned primer pairs forward 5'atgtataaatgcccttctccaggaa and reverse 5'gcaggttcactcacagcagag ( hs00225801 _ ce , thermo fisher scientific ) .
pcr products were sequenced using the bigdye direct cycle sequencing kit ( life technologies ) and a 3730xl dna analyzer instrument ( life technologies ) .
the exon 1 region of a cyp2d7 - specific xl - pcr product from selected samples was also sequenced with bigdye chemistry on a 3730xl dna analyzer .
the cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 genes of na17128 were sequenced in their entirety .
dna sequences were aligned to m33388 and ay545216 ( reference sequences for cyp2d6 ) and to four unique cyp2d7 sequences : m33387 , ens00000205702 ( corresponding to ens00000612115 and nc _ 000022.11 of grch38.p2 ) , ens00000263181 and ens00000278088 .
there is no recognized reference sequence for cyp2d7 at this time ; ens00000205702 was set as a reference because this sequence represents cyp2d7 in grch38 .
high resolution melt ( hrm ) analysis to facilitate screening of cyp2d7 rs386821512 ( cc > gt ; positions - 1 and - 2 in respect to the atg start codon ; grch38 42144465:42144466 ) a hrm assay was developed .
briefly , a 164 bp amplicon was generated with primers forward 5 ' gtcacgcgctcggtgtgctgag and reverse 5 ' ccaccaggagcaggaagattgccac .
six mul reactions contained 400 nm of each primer , 2.5 mm mgcl2 , and 0.6 mul of 1:2000 - fold diluted xl - pcr amplicon .
the reaction was cycled at an initial denaturation of 95degreesc for 3 min , followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95degreesc for 5 s , annealing at 72degreesc for 10 s and extension at 72degreesc for 20 s. melt curve analysis was performed using the eco real - time pcr system ( illumina , san diego , ca ) .
note that the primers used for this assay are not cyp2d7 - specific and , therefore , this assay must be performed on a cyp2d7 xl - pcr template and not gdna .
na17128 served as positive control .
cyp2d6 nomenclature allele designations throughout the manuscript are according to those defined by the human cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) allele nomenclature database ( sim and ingelman - sundberg , 2013 ) at http :// www.cypalleles.ki.se / .
results among a large , diverse u.s. population of 13,866 samples , 70 samples ( 0.5 %) initially tested positive for cyp2d6 * 15 when genotyped on the openarray platform ( suppl table 1 ). of those , 19 self - identified as caucasian , 34 as african american , 7 as hispanic , 1 as asian and 9 were of unknown ethnicity .
to confirm the presence of this relatively rare nonfunctional allele , all 70 samples which returned positive results for cyp2d6 * 15 were genotyped with the luminex xtag system .
for 66 samples , the cyp2d6 - specific 6.6 kb long xl - pcr product was generated and the exon 1 region sequenced ; the remaining samples failed to produce the amplicon .
fifteen samples were confirmed cyp2d6 * 15 - positive ; among those were 11 caucasians , one asian and three of unknown ethnicity .
fifty - one samples were negative for cyp2d6 * 15 by sequencing and luminex assay ( table 1 and suppl table 1 ) .
a coriell sample ( na17128 ) was independently observed by one of the authors to be heterozygous for cyp2d6 * 15 when genotyped with taqman from gdna .
these observations led us to hypothesize that nonspecific amplification from the cyp2d7 pseudogene may cause these miscalls .
to explore this , 20 of the 70 samples and na17128 were selected for further analysis along with two samples , pgx - a and pgx - b , that were previously genotyped as negative for cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 ( table 1 ) .
sequence analysis of the cyp2d7 region of interest revealed cc > gt snps in exon 1 of cyp2d7 at positions - 1 and - 2 relative to the atg start codon in false - positives and na17128 ( figure 1a ) .
this sequence variation was also present in all other false - positive samples as subsequently determined by hrm analysis that was performed on a xl - pcr template encompassing the cyp2d7 gene ( figure 2 ) .
as illustrated in figure 1b , the cyp2d7 cc > gt snps revert the sequence to cyp2d6 and thereby allowed one of the cyp2d6 * 15 taqman genotyping assay pcr primers to bind and support the generation of an amplicon from cyp2d7 .
because cyp2d7 also carries an additional t in exon 1 ( the cyp2d6 137tins in fact corresponds to the cyp2d7 reference sequence ) , a mutation signal is generated , triggering the false - positive cyp2d6 * 15 calls .
figure 1 interference of cyp2d7 variation on cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 taqman genotype assay results .
( a ) shows the exon 1 region of cyp2d6 and the cyp2d7 pseudogene .
sequence differences at the - 1 and - 2 positions are highlighted in green and the atg translation start codon is underlined .
cyp2d7 carries a cc at positions - 1 and - 2 while cyp2d6 has gt. this difference was employed for primer design for the initial cyp2d6 * 15 taqman genotyping assay .
snps defining allelic variants are shown in red ; nucleotide positions are as indicated .
the primer location is provided by the arrow .
an " x " indicates that the primer does not generate pcr product .
( b ) details the mechanism by which false - positive assay results are generated .
the first example shows a correct cyp2d6 * 15 call ; the taqman primer only binds to cyp2d6 .
in the second example , one cyp2d7 allele carries gt allowing primer binding and pcr product amplification .
since the cyp2d7 derived amplicon has the t - insertion and 31a , the assay yields a false - positive results for cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 .
in the third example , cyp2d6 * 15 will also be false - positive .
regarding 31g > a , fluorescent signals will be generated from the variant cyp2d7 allele as well as the cyp2d6 * 35 allele which may lead to a shift in cluster position .
figure 2 high resolution melt ( hrm ) assay detecting variation on cyp2d7 - specific xl - pcr template .
blue indicates wt , green heterozygous and red variant .
interestingly , na17128 was also heterozygous for cyp2d6 * 35 ( 31g > a ) , but lacked other snps such as - 1584c > g ( rs1080985 ) , 2850c > t ( rs16947 ) , or 4180g > c ( rs1135840 ) known to be linked with 31g > a ( gaedigk et al. , 2003 ) .
we therefore suspected that the cyp2d7 cc > gt variation may also interfere with the cyp2d6 * 35 genotyping taqman assay , resulting in false - positive calls as well given that the cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 assays share a primer binding site that overlies the dinucleotide change .
indeed , all samples with a false - positive cyp2d6 * 15 call presented as false - positive for cyp2d6 * 35 when genotyped on gdna or wga - dna and were negative when genotyping was performed on cyp2d6 - specific xl - pcr amplicons suggesting that the cyp2d7 cc > gt dinucleotide snp is indeed the underlying cause for the false - positive results .
these conclusions were further corroborated by running both taqman genotyping assays on cyp2d7 - specific template .
as expected , those carrying cc > gt produced a " homozygous " signal ( only the variant cyp2d7 allele amplified , mimicking homozygosity ) while those not having cc > gt did not produce a fluorescence signal .
to address these false - positive calls , alternate cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 assays were designed and evaluated on cyp2d6 and cyp2d6 xl - pcr templates , gdna and wga - dna .
figure 3a shows a cluster plot of selected samples for the initial cyp2d6 * 15 assay .
as can be seen , the samples identified as false - positives , although on a slightly different trajectory , cluster with true heterozygotes .
since cyp2d6 * 15 is an extremely rare allele , there are typically no , or perhaps single , positive samples in a run besides a heterozygous control sample , making it impossible to distinguish true from false - positives .
as shown in figure 3b , the alternate assay was specific , i.e. , the samples that were initially false - positive ( shown boxed in figure 3a ) now clustered with wild - type control samples .
furthermore , the alternate assay did not produce any fluorescent signals when cyp2d7 xl - pcr was used as template , indicating amplification was not supported from cyp2d7 , including the variants that carry cc > gt ( data not shown ) .
similar results were obtained for the initial and alternate cyp2d6 * 35 assays , respectively ( figure 4 ) .
the false - positive samples , however , formed a more distinct cluster when run with the initial assay due to extra vic signal contributed by amplification of the cyp2d6 allele .
since cyp2d6 * 35 is a more common allele , false - positives may be easier to provisionally identify compared to cyp2d6 * 15 false - positives ; albeit in other experiments run with gdnas this pattern has been less obvious ( data not shown ) .
when run with the alternate assay , the false - positive samples cluster unequivocally with the wild - type controls .
genotyping and sequencing results for all 70 samples as well as na17128 and two control samples are summarized in table 1 and suppl table 1 .

sequencing of the cyp2d6 gene in na17128 revealed snps at 77g > a ( rs28371696 ; heterozygous ) , 310g > t ( rs28371699 , homozygous ) , 843t > g , ( heterozygous ) , and 1067t > g ( heterozygous ) , which is consistent with a cyp2d6 * 1var2 /* 43 genotype (* 1var2 is a * 1 subvariant we have recently observed in a trio and described elsewhere ( twist et al. , in press ) .
subsequent taqman genotyping of our study cohort revealed that 77g > a was present in 14 samples ( table 1 and suppl table 1 and suppl figure 1 ) .
xl - pcr sequence data also revealed the presence of 77g > a ( cyp2d6 * 43 ) in most subjects initially thought to have a cyp2d6 * 1 allele .
three of the four sequencing - confirmed samples were also correctly identified with the alternative cyp2d6 * 15 assay , while all false - negative samples returned wild - type calls .
sample # 13 , however , which was initially genotyped as cyp2d6 * 4 /* 15 ( table 1 and suppl table 1 ) and confirmed by luminex xtag genotyping , was not identified by the alternate cyp2d6 * 15 taqman assay to have the 137tins .
in addition to the cyp2d6 * 15 137tins xl - pcr sequencing of the exon 1 region also revealed heterozygosity for 77g > a , a snp that is part of the cyp2d6 * 43 allele definition , and two novel exon 1 snps , 102a > g and 108c > t. as shown in suppl figure 1 , 102a > g and 108c > t interfere with one of the alternate cyp2d6 * 15 taqman assay primers suggesting that these snps as well as 77g > a are on the same chromosome as 137tins forming a novel cyp2d6 * 15var haplotype .
we did not find any evidence that the use of wga - dna impacted assay results .
specifically , the redesigned cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 assays were performed on a subset of samples on both gdna and wga - dna .
furthermore , there were no inconsistent findings between wga - dna - derived taqman assay results and any other results obtained on gdna including genotype analysis on the luminex platform or genotyping or sequencing of xl - pcr products that would have indicated erroneous results using wga - dna .
lastly , sequence analysis of the cyp2d7 gene of na17128 and comparison to four unique cyp2d7 sequences ( suppl table 2 ) identified cc > gt snv at positions - 1 and - 2 ( in relation to the atg start codon ) , heterozygosity for seven snps that were not observed in any of the other cyp2d7 sequences , as well as a number of snps that are present in one or more of the cyp2d7 sequences it was compared to. discussion taqman assays are carefully designed and evaluated before commercial marketing .
however , rare or unknown snps located underneath primer and / or probe regions can impact the performance of many genotype assays , including taqman ( gaedigk et al. , 2015a,b ) .
we have previously also shown that a small cluster of snps found within the pcr amplicon , and not under the primer / probe regions , can negatively impact taqman genotype assay performance in certain instances ( gaedigk et al. , 2015a ) .
here we report for the first time that a snp in the highly similar cyp2d7 pseudogene interferes with a cyp2d6 taqman genotype assay .
in the cases presented , the underlying cause of the false - positive results did not reside within the interrogated gene , but it 's near identical cyp2d7 pseudogene .
the high degree of sequence identity between cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 makes it extremely difficult to find regions that are gene - specific that fulfill other taqman assay requirements including amplicon size .
the region immediately upstream of the atg start codon differs between the two genes by two consecutive nucleotides when available genomic sequences are compared ( cyp2d6 has gt and cyp2d7 has cc ) making this region a good target for primer design .
a rare dinucleotide snp on cyp2d7 , however , converted the sequence to cyp2d6 , allowing primer binding as outlined in figure 1 .
consequently , a pcr product was formed from the intended cyp2d6 target and from the variant cyp2d7 allele , generating pseudo - heterozygosity .
since cyp2d7 carries an additional t in exon 1 ( corresponding to the cyp2d6 * 15 variant sequence ) , a mutation signal will be generated by the taqman fluorogenic probe off the cyp2d7 amplification product ; as the fluorescent signal is produced from two cyp2d6 alleles and one cyp2d7 allele , such samples possess a slightly different trajectory and position in the cluster plot ( figure 3a for cyp2d6 * 15 and figure 4a for cyp2d6 * 35 ) .
similar observations are made when samples carry a gene duplication , e.g. , cyp2d6 * 1 /* 4x2 , in which signals are also derived from three loci .
currently , there are > 2000 variant annotations for the cyp2d7 pseudogene , many with unknown frequencies or minor allele frequencies ( maf ) < 0.1 % ( ensembl , accessed 8 - 8 - 2015 ) .
among those is the cc > gt variation which is inventoried by dbsnp under rs386821512 with no population or frequency data .
however , this dinucleotide variant appears to be represented in the ncbi dbsnp database as two recently characterized snps : a c > g snp at position - 1 ( rs556798398 ) and a c > t snp at position - 2 ( rs538594407 ) .
these snps were identified in the 1000 genomes ( 1000 g ) project ( abecasis et al. , 2012 ) at an overall population frequency of 0.42 % each ; a review of the 1000 g phase 3 , may 2013 data indicated that both snps are found in the same 21 individuals .
similarly , all five samples that were sequenced in our study contained cyp2d7 cc > gt and hrm patterns of the remaining samples were consistent with the samples carrying cc > gt. the numerous cyp2d7 sequence variations annotated in genbank and ensembl make it almost impossible to negotiate cyp2d7 variation when designing cyp2d6 genotyping assays .
moreover , gdna samples carrying rare alleles are often not available to validate assay performance , i.e. , validation that the assay not only detects the allele of interest in heterozygous and homozygous samples , but that no other variant ( s ) impact the assay 's performance .
it is therefore prudent to confirm the presence of rare snps with a reference method to validate assay performance and avoid reporting false - positive results .
taqman genotyping assays are extensively tested before being commercially available ; however , in situations such as the one described here and reported previously ( gaedigk et al. , 2015a,b ) , rare snps , or snps in certain genotype constellations , can cause false results that may potentially lead to incorrect phenotype prediction and impact clinical decision making for a patient .
the present work is also the first report establishing the presence of cyp2d6 * 15 on a large population cohort .
although this allele was among the first described and designated in cyp2d6 , there are sparse data regarding its population distribution and frequency ( http :// www.pharmgkb.org / download.action ? filename = cyp2d6 _ frequency _ table _ and _ legend _ r3.pdf ) .
in our diverse u.s. population , we identified only 15 cyp2d6 * 15 carriers , which corresponds to a prevalence of 0.1 % and an allele frequency of 0.05 % .
among those , 11 subjects self - identified as caucasians , one as asian and three were of unknown ethnicity .
among the 55 false - positive samples which were confirmed by luminex genotyping and xl - pcr sequencing , the majority were african american ( n = 34 ) , followed by caucasians ( n = 8 ) , hispanics ( n = 7 ) and those with unknown ethnicity ( n = 6 ) ; na17128 is also caucasian .
although there are no frequency data for rs386821512 ( cc > gt ) per the dbsnp database ( accessed 9 - 30 - 2015 ) , the maf data for the apparently linked rs556798398 ( c > g ) and rs538594407 ( c > t ) snps indicate that they are predominantly found in subjects with african and european ancestry ( 1 and 0.1 % , respectively ) , which is consistent with the ethnicity information of the subjects identified to carry cc > gt ( table 1 and suppl table 1 ) .
as demonstrated , rs386821512 did not only cause false - positive results for cyp2d6 * 15 , but also for cyp2d6 * 35 .
miscalls for this allele were initially not detected in the cohort because the latter was not part of the custom openarray panel employed for genotyping .
false - positive calls for cyp2d6 * 35 , however , are less consequential because this allele is currently assigned the same activity score value for phenotype prediction as cyp2d6 * 1 ( gaedigk et al. , 2008 ; hicks et al. , 2015 ) .
a false - positive result for 31g > a ( rs769258 ) may also be easier to detect than cyp2d6 * 15 false - positives , if 2850c > t ( rs16947 ) and 4180g > c ( rs1135840 ) are part of the test panel .
based on allele definitions , 2850c > t and 4180g > c are expected to be present if 31g > a is detected due to complete linkage of these three snps in cyp2d6 * 35 .
this was indeed the case for na17128 , which was negative for 2850c > t and 4180g > c , as well as for - 1584g ( rs1080985 ) , which is also part of the cyp2d6 * 35 haplotype and may aid in the identification of false - positives .
after identifying the underlying cause of the false - positive calls , both taqman genotype assays were carefully redesigned and validated on our sample set .
three of the four sequencing - confirmed , positives for cyp2d6 * 15 samples were correctly identified , while all false - negative samples returned wild - type calls .
the redesigned assays were also tested on cyp2d7 xl - pcr template to demonstrate that indeed no signal is produced from the cyp2d7 gt variant .
one sample carrying the 137 t - insertion , however , failed to be detected by the alternative cyp2d6 * 15 taqman assay due to the presence of two novel snps within exon 1 , which were only discovered during the course of our investigation .
due to the high sequence similarities between cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 , it appears impossible to steer clear of all variation when designing genotyping assays .
reliable detection of cyp2d6 * 15 can tentatively only be achieved by a combination of tests .
interestingly , we also revealed linkage between the cyp2d7 gt variant and cyp2d6 * 43 .
all samples interrogated for and shown to carry cc > gt , were initially false - positive for cyp2d6 * 15 , and were subsequently heterozygous for 77g > a ( suppl table 1 ) .
limited data for cyp2d6 * 43 suggest an allele frequency of about 0.5 % ( http :// www.pharmgkb.org / download.action ? filename = cyp2d6 _ frequency _ table _ and _ legend _ r3.pdf ) , which is similar to that reported for rs538594407 and found in our study cohort ( n = 55 including subject 13 ) which corresponds to an overall allele frequency of 0.2 % , further supporting linkage between cyp2d7 cc > gt and cyp2d6 * 43 .
six samples that were initially false - positive for cyp2d6 * 15 and also had a cyp2d6 * 1 allele , did not have 77g > a. because , these samples were not interrogated for cyp2d7 cc > gt , however , we can only speculate whether cyp2d7 cc > gt and 77g > a are in complete linkage .
one subject (# 13 , of unknown ethnicity ) was tentatively found to have a novel cyp2d6 * 15 subvariant that is characterized by the presence of two additional cyp2d6 snps , 102a > g and 108c > t , both of which correspond to the cyp2d7 reference sequence ( supplemental figure 1 ) .
although we were not able to unequivocally map the two novel snps onto the cyp2d6 * 15 allele , we infer this location because these snps appear to prevent primer binding of the alternate cyp2d6 * 15 assay , causing allele - drop out .
hence , the assay only detects the wild - type allele on the other chromosome .
we have only identified a single subject among 13,866 , making this allele extremely rare at ( 0.004 %) .
in summary , the discovery and systematic characterization of the underpinning cause of false - positive taqman genotyping assay calls led to the development of alternative cyp2d6 * 15 and * 35 assays to accurately detect these alleles with one caveat , i.e. , a novel , but rare , cyp2d6 * 15 subvariant eludes detection with the alternate assay .
given the sequence similarities between cyp2d6 and cyp2d7 , and polymorphisms each gene harbors in the region of interest that mimic each other , it is nearly impossible to design genotyping assays that are cyp2d6 - specific , steer clear of the cyp2d7 cc > gt variation and detect all cyp2d6 * 15 including the novel subvariant .
one solution may be to perform both the initial and alternate assays to identify true cyp2d6 * 15 alleles .
in addition , this study also adds valuable information regarding the frequency of cyp2d6 * 15 , produced a complete gene sequence of cyp2d6 * 43 , revealed linkage between cyp2d6 * 43 and cyp2d7 cc > gt and , lastly , but not least important , demonstrates that the presence and variability of a highly related pseudogene complicates genetic testing of cyp2d6 and can interfere and cause erroneous results .

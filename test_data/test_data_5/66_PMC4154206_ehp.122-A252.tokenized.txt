outdoor particulate matter exposure and lung cancer : a systematic review and meta - analysis outdoor air pollution is made up of particulate matter ( pm ) and hundreds of chemicals from natural sources and human - related activities.1,2 in october 2013 the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) reviewed more than 1,000 research articles and formally designated outdoor air pollution in general and pm in particular as human carcinogens.3 a new meta - analysis of epidemiological research in this issue of ehp now estimates the lung cancer risk associated with pm exposure.4 pm includes particles of varying sizes , with the coarse ( pm10 ) and fine ( pm2.5 ) fractions attracting the most research attention.4 pm2.5 is of special interest because its size allows delivery of genotoxic chemicals deep into the lung.3,5 worldwide , average outdoor air concentrations of pm vary from less than 10 mug / m3 to more than 100 mug / m3 , but most studies have been undertaken in north america and europe , which have relatively low pm levels ( 10 - 30 mug / m3 ) compared with those in developing countries.1,2 the authors of the new review conducted subgroup analyses to see if it mattered whether pm exposure estimates depended on fixed - site monitors versus modeling techniques .
it did n't ; estimated associations between exposure and lung cancer were relatively consistent regardless of the method used to estimate individual exposures .
( c ) jon bower / loop images / corbis the meta - analysis focused on 18 large epidemiological studies that estimated residential exposure to pm2.5 , pm10 , or both , along with differences in lung cancer incidence or mortality associated with increased exposure .
all studies controlled for age and sex , with adjustment for other confounders varying across studies .
the authors of the current review estimated that each 10 - mug / m3 increase in pm2.5 exposure was associated with a 9 % increase in lung cancer risk .
the estimated risk associated with a 10 - mug / m3 increase in pm10 exposure was similar ( 8 %) , but the estimate was less precise.4 " our review assumes that as exposure to pm increases , so does lung cancer risk ," says lead author ghassan hamra , now an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at drexel university , who conducted the work as a postdoctoral fellow at iarc .
" so , rapidly industrializing countries may see an increase in lung cancer incidence .
however , it is unclear at what levels of exposure to outdoor air pollution we could expect to see a leveling off of lung cancer risk. " subgroup analyses were conducted by continent , pm exposure assessment method ( fixed - site monitoring versus model - based estimation ) , and smoking status ( never , former , or current ) .
continent and assessment method did not alter the overall conclusion .
the estimated relative risk for lung cancer in association with pm2.5 differed according to smoking status , with current smokers having the weakest association , former smokers the strongest , and never smokers in between .
however , the subgroup - specific estimates were imprecise , and the differences were not statistically significant .
the authors could not perform a similar analysis for pm10 because of a lack of information on patterns of former smoking.4 " i think an important direction for future research will be attempting to evaluate the carcinogenicity of components of pm2.5 ," says hamra .
" some of these components may be harmful , while others may be innocuous .
further research could help us better understand if this is the case . "
" it 's a very straightforward paper , a very straightforward analysis , applying very well - known , standard techniques ," says michael brauer , a professor at the university of british columbia school of population and public health , who contributed to the iarc evaluation .
" the goal of the iarc evaluation is to provide a yes / no answer [ as to whether air pollution causes cancer ] ; it does n't provide any quantitative risk estimate .
the yes / no answer is helpful , but many people want to go beyond that ," he says .
according to iarc , 223,000 lung cancer deaths due to air pollution occurred worldwide in 2010.6 in terms of the global burden of all diseases attributable to air pollution , lung cancer accounts for less than 7 % of the 3.22 million estimated deaths.4 still , that risk may provide a strong impetus toward enacting policies and practices for protecting and improving air quality.3 " if we think about all the ways air pollution can cause death and disability , the cancer component is actually rather small ," brauer says .
but the idea that air can be carcinogenic is , he says , " very powerful. " references 1 brauer m exposure assessment for estimation of the global burden of disease attributable to outdoor air pollution .

published 16 , october 2017 the original version of figure 3 was based on a preliminary set of results that were inaccurate to the final set of results detailed in all other areas of the article .
we provide a revised graphic for figure 3 representing the final results , which is now consistent with the final results presented elsewhere in the article .
the final content was presented accurately in all other figures and also in supplement 1 which provides the numerical dataset used to generate figure 3 .
the caption for figure 3 has also been amended to reflect that the time - series shown is applicable for the years 2006 - 2014 rather than only the year 2014 .
all other content is accurate .
the article has been corrected accordingly .
corrected figure 3 is shown here : corrected figure caption : malaria - attributable fevers as a proportion of malaria - positive fevers ( children < 5 years of age ) .
the originally published figure 3 is also shown for reference : original figure caption : malaria - attributable fevers as a proportion of malaria - positive fevers ( children < 5 years of age , 2014 ) .

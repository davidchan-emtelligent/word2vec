we aimed to find the prevalence and some factors relating with unwanted pregnancy. methods .
it was a cross - sectional study on 400 randomly pregnant women , who were referring to different health centers in ahwaz city during 2010 .
data was conducted based on questionnaire , and all the analysis was performed using spss ( version 17 ) statistical analysis software. results .
the prevalence of unwanted pregnancy was 26 % .
the percentage of unwanted pregnancy in ages more than 35 years was approximately three times more than the intended pregnancy .
there were significant relationship between unwanted pregnancy and some variables such as age , number of pregnancy , number of childbirth , education status , economic status , husband 's occupation , and the relationship with the spouse and contraceptive methods ( p < 0.0001 ). conclusion .
the prevalence of unwanted pregnancy was high .
to prevent unwanted pregnancy using consultation services before planning to be pregnancy , it is necessary to identify the factors relating with unwanted pregnancy .
1. introduction attempts to confine reproduction refer to a distant time .
only those contraceptive methods are new in which synthetic steroid is used [ 1 ] .
regarding the current status of growth , the world population is doubled every 54 years ; however , in poor countries , population is doubled in less than 20 years .
to complete and preserve personal health during pregnancy , the optimal use of contraceptive methods is effective , and planning is necessary before pregnancy [ 2 ] .
the rate of pregnancy in women with a high potency for fertility who use no contraceptive method is 90 % during one year .
a proved view is that the prevention is less dangerous than the pregnancy itself [ 3 ] .
therefore , conscious and accurate decision making for pregnancy and precise care play an important role in decreasing the maternal mortality .
induced abortion that can be the important complication followed by unwanted pregnancy play a significant role in the incidence of infection , fever , risk of the next premature delivery , low birth weight , and infertility [ 1 , 4 ] .
pregnancy is a temporary crisis that creates deep mental , physical , and behavioral changes in a woman .
conscious and accurate decision making for pregnancy , continuation , and precise care play an important role in declining the maternal mortality .
according to the studies by world health organization , close to one - third of the pregnancies in the third world countries are unwanted [ 5 ] .
this kind of pregnancy increases the incidence chance of complication and maternal mortality [ 2 ] .
considering the fact that induced abortion may create some significant complications such as infection , septic shock , fever , risk of the next premature delivery , low birth weight , and infertility , it can also cause some anatomic complications resulting from the surgery such as uterus , bladder , and intestinal rupture [ 1 , 4 ] .
planning for pregnancy can help the safety of childbirth , and unplanned pregnancies increase the maternal mortality [ 2 ] .
despite the attempts by the authors in health centers , some unwanted pregnancies occur that can danger the women .
therefore , we decided to evaluate some factors related to unwanted pregnancy in women referred to health centers .
2. methods it was a cross - sectional study on 400 randomly pregnant women , who were referred to several clinics and health center in ahwaz city during 2010 .
data was collected through interview and filling up a designed questionnaire containing demographic characteristics , fertility , and so forth .
all the analysis was performed using spss ( version 17 ) software .
descriptive and chi - square test analysis had seen performed to this study .
3. results the prevalence rate of unwanted pregnancy was 26 % .
the mean age of women with unwanted pregnancy was 27.5 +/ - 5.7 years , and in women with intended pregnancy was 24.6 +/ - 4.5 years .
the percentage of the older women (>= 35 years ) in unwanted pregnancy was 3 times of intended pregnancy which was statistically significant .
most of pregnant women lived in urban area ( 70.1 %) , and the percentage of rural women who intended pregnancy was higher ( 35.6 %) .
the educational level in the subjects was 36 % in secondary school and 44 % in high school .
37 % of subjects with unwanted pregnancy were illiterate and primary school ( table 1 ) .
the findings have shown that most of pregnant women were housewives ( 82 %) , and their husbands had self - employment ( 40 %) , and 7.1 % of subjects with unwanted pregnancy had unemployed husband .
low economic status was higher in unwanted pregnancy .
half of the women with unwanted pregnancy had low economic status , while , in women with intended pregnancy , this rate was only 20 % .
according to the interviews , good relationship with the husband in women with unwanted pregnancy was lower ( 66 %) .
regarding fertility characteristics , the findings showed that more than half of the women with unwanted pregnancy were in the third trimester 54 % , ( figure 1 ) .
80 % of unwanted pregnancy had more than two times pregnancies , but the percentage in intended pregnancy was 38 % .
this study showed that more than half of the pregnant women had used one of the contraceptive methods before the recent pregnancy , and 30 % had used natural ( interrupted ) methods .
the most percentage of women with unwanted pregnancy used unreliable methods like interrupted method ( 59.1 %) .
the incidence of pregnancy followed by the consumption of contraceptive pills in women unwanted pregnancy was 16 % .
this study has shown that 26 % of women who wish to become pregnant had more knowledge and performance about pregnancy health 26 % , and the low levels of knowledge and performance were more observed in unwanted pregnancy .
4. discussion the incidence of unwanted pregnancy is different in the world , but it has the same undesired outcomes .
our study has shown that prevalence of unwanted pregnancy was 26 % , and similar conducted studies indicated that the incidence rate of unplanned pregnancy was 25 % , 30 % , 43 % , and 52 % [ 6 - 9 ] .
in this study , relative decrease in the incidence of unwanted pregnancy in our country in comparison with the other countries may be due to the hopeful success of health centers .
considering the point that intended pregnancy which results in a healthy childbirth from a healthy mother as an aim of midwifery science [ 10 , 11 ] , pregnancy must be occurred based on the accurate and conscious decision and according to the physical , mental , economic , social , and cultural status [ 2 , 3 ] .
alenova in a study after evaluating the activities of consultation clinics guiding women for that the prevention of pregnancy states that prevention of unwanted pregnancy is more necessary in aged women , and it becomes more vital with the increase of age [ 12 ] .
mohammadloo in his study declares that more than half of the unwanted pregnancies occur in women more than 30 years [ 13 ] .
one of the causes of not intending pregnancy is the age of more than 35 years that has been noted in other studies too [ 6 , 8 , 13 , 14 ] .
in the present study , low education has a close relationship with increased incidence of unwanted pregnancy , and , in a study by bennett et al. , this rate is doubled in low education [ 15 ] .
this indicates that individuals with low level of education need more consultation services .
most of the women have the ability to become pregnant for at least three decades in their life , but most of men are potentially fertile all over their life [ 13 ] .
in our study , the rate of unwanted pregnancy was higher in individuals with more number of children .
also , in similar studies , the increased prevalence of unwanted pregnancy is observed with an increase in the number of children , from 7.9 % in childless women to 92.8 % in women with 4 children or more [ 10 ] .
in our study , unwanted pregnancy was more observed in employee women , and some other studies have achieved this result too [ 6 ] .
low income , poverty , unemployed husband , and inappropriate job play significant role in the incidence of unplanned pregnancy [ 7 , 15 - 19 ] .
a study in zimbabwe has shown that women with unemployed husbands were more exposed to the unwanted pregnancy [ 20 ] .
some studies in africa [ 7 ] and new york [ 17 ] indicated that unwanted pregnancy more occurred in poor , low income , and homeless women , which necessitates more concern about the poor women .
other studies in thailand [ 21 ] and usa [ 22 ] have found that one of the related factors with unwanted pregnancy is the relationship with the spouse ; also they showed that good relationship with the spouse in women with unwanted pregnancy was less than intended cases .
a study from london has found that planned pregnancy was more observed in couple with more strengthened union in marriage [ 7 ] .
it seems that couples' relationship is an important and positive factor which affects the increase of their cooperation in regarding the fertility health [ 23 ] .
it was indicated in this study that , in 20 % of women with unwanted pregnancy , no contraceptive method was used , and more than half of them used unreliable methods of which failure was more observed in unwanted pregnancies .
a study in egypt states that 47 % of pregnant women with unplanned pregnancy do not use adequate prevention , and 28.8 % encounter with the failure of their contraceptive method [ 6 ] .
in a study in china , it has been indicated that the failure of the contraceptive method has been the main cause of unwanted pregnancy [ 24 ] .
it seems that of the most important educational needs and the most effective attempts to prevent unwanted pregnancy are creating motivations in families , providing necessary facilities , and helping them in selection and accurate use of different methods by holding educational classes in health centers .
therefore , introducing accurate information about the contraceptive methods acquires a profound understanding , and using this information is very important in planning for the pregnancy [ 25 ] .
considering the lack of safe methods , educational programs , introducing adequate contraceptive options , and consultation before pregnancy are effective strategies for decreasing unwanted pregnancy and its outcomes [ 24 ] .
76 % of world population live in developing countries , 85 % of births , 95 % of neonatal mortality , and 99 % of maternal mortality occur in these countries [ 25 ] .
so , regulating reproduction and adequate planning for pregnancy is significant in these countries .
in conclusion , more attempts must be taken to decrease complication of pregnancies such as unwanted cases .
in the recent years , it has been proved that , in addition , the population control and educational program for contraceptive methods are important and necessary in preventing unwanted pregnancy .
because in iran abortion is illegal consider in the muslim religious , unwanted pregnant women cannot do abortion except if physician has diagnosis that mother has complication to continue of her pregnancy or there is intrauterine growth retardation in the first trimester .

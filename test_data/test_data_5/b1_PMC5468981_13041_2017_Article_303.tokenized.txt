excitatory synaptic transmission in central synapses is modulated by serotonin ( 5 - ht ) .
the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) is an important cortical region for pain perception and emotion .
acc neurons receive innervation of projecting serotonergic nerve terminals from raphe nuclei , but the possible effect of 5 - ht on excitatory transmission in the acc has not been investigated .
in the present study , we investigated the role of 5 - ht on glutamate neurotransmission in the acc slices of adult mice .
bath application of 5 - ht produced dose - dependent inhibition of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents ( eepscs ) .
paired pulse ratio ( ppr ) was significantly increased , indicating possible presynaptic effects of 5 - ht. consistently , bath application of 5 - ht significantly decreased the frequency of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ( sepscs and mepscs ). by contrast , amplitudes of sepscs and mepscs were not significantly affected .
after postsynaptic application of g protein inhibitor gdp - beta - s , 5 - ht produced inhibition of eepscs was significantly reduced .
finally , nan - 190 , an antagonist of 5 - ht1a receptor , significantly reduced postsynaptic inhibition of 5 - ht and abolished presynaptic inhibition .
our results strongly suggest that presynaptic as well as postsynaptic 5 - ht receptor including 5 - ht1a subtype receptor may contribute to inhibitory modulation of glutamate release as well as postsynaptic responses in the acc .

it has been implicated in pain modulation [ 1 ] and emotional disorders [ 2 ] .
serotonergic projections to spinal or medullary dorsal horn areas are involved in nociceptive transmission through regulating descending inhibitory pathways [ 3 - 5 ] .
mice lacking serotoninergic neurons in the cns exhibited enhanced inflammation pain and reduced analgesia in response to opioids and antidepressants [ 6 ] .
the intrathecal administration of serotonergic agents induced anti - nociceptive actions in animal models [ 7 ] .
a recent study demonstrates that activation of a specific 5 - ht subtype receptor inhibited mechanical allodynia in nerve - injured animals by affecting hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - regulated ( hcn ) channels dendritic function in the anterior cingulate cortex ( acc ) [ 8 ] .
the acc is a critical cortical region , which plays a central role in the formation of pain perception and the unpleasantness of pain [ 1 , 9 , 10 ] .
neurons of the acc receive sensory inputs projecting from other subcortical areas ( such as the thalamus ) and then project to related sensory regions , including amygdala , midbrain areas , brainstem and spinal cord [ 11 , 12 ] .
injuries enhanced synaptic transmission in the acc and inhibition of the acc potentiation is analgesic in animal models of chronic pain [ 1 , 9 , 10 ] .
in the cns , serotoninergic neurons are mainly located in the raphe nuclei , and they send projecting terminals to different regions of the brain and spinal cord [ 13 ] .
at the synaptic level , 5 - ht has been reported to produce only inhibitory or biphasic modulation of sensory synaptic transmission .
for example , 5 - ht exerts a biphasic modulation of glutamate transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [ 14 , 15 ] .
5 - ht produces only inhibitory effects on excitatory or inhibitory transmission in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( bnst ) [ 16 ] and the periaqueductal grey ( pag ) [ 17 ] .
in forebrain areas including the acc , neurons are highly innervated by serotoninergic terminals [ 13 , 18 ] .
however , the possible effect of 5 - ht on excitatory synaptic transmission in the acc has not been investigated .
in the present study , we perform whole - cell patch - clamp recordings from acc pyramidal cells and investigate the modulatory effect of 5 - ht. we found that bath application of 5 - ht produced only inhibitory modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission .
furthermore , we show that 5 - ht may produce its inhibitory effects through both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms .
methods animals adult male c57bl / 6 mice ( 8 - 14 weeks ) were used in the experiments and they were purchased from charles river laboratories ( st. constant , quebec , canada ) .
the animals were housed in plastic boxes with food and water available ad libitum in a colony room with controlled temperature ( 24 +/ - 2 degreesc ) , humidity ( 50 - 60 %) , and a 12:12 h light - dark cycle .
experiments were performed under protocols approved by the animal care and use committee at the university of toronto .
chemicals 5 - ht and guanosine - 5 ' - o - ( 2 - thiodiphosphate ) ( gdp - beta - s ) were obtained from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
nan - 190 , picrotoxin and tetrodotoxin were purchased from tocris cookson ( bristol , uk ) .
drugs were prepared as stock solutions for frozen aliquots at - 20 degreesc .
all these drugs were diluted from the stock solution to the final desired concentration in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) before immediate use .
all of other chemicals and reagents used were commercially available and of standard biochemical quality .
brain slice preparation the general procedures for making the acc slices were similar to those described previously [ 19 , 20 ] .
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane in air and then decapitated .
brains were rapidly removed and placed for 2 - 3 min in an ice - cold and oxygenated acsf ( in mm ) : containing 124 nacl , 25 nahco3 , 2.5 kcl , 1 kh2po4 , 2 cacl2 , 2 mgso4 and 10 glucose , and continuously gassed with 95 % o2 / 5 % co2 .
coronal slices ( 300 mum ) containing the acc were prepared on a vibratome ( leica vt1200s ) in ice - cold acsf .
slices were then incubated in a room temperature - submerged recovery chamber with oxygenated ( 95 % o2 and 5 % co2 ) acsf for at least 1 h. whole - cell patch - clamp recording after recovery , slices were placed in a recording chamber on the stage of an olympus microscope with infrared digital interference contrast optics for visualization of whole - cell patch - clamp recordings .
recordings were performed at room temperature ( 21 - 23 degreesc ) with continuous perfusion of acsf at a rate of 2 ml / min .
for spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( sepscs ) recording , recording pipettes ( 3 - 5 momega ) were filled with solution containing 145 mm k - gluconate , 5 mm nacl , 1 mm mgcl2 , 0.2 mm egta , 10 mm hepes , 2 mm mg - atp , and 0.1 mm na3 - gtp , adjusted to ph 7.2 with koh ( 280 - 300 mosm ) .
sepscs were collected in the neurons clamped at - 60 mv in the acsf .
for the recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ( mepscs ) , the circulating acsf was additionally added 1 mum tetrodotoxin .
the evoked epscs ( eepscs ) were recorded from layer ii / iii neurons with an axon 200b amplifier ( molecular devices ) and stimulation was delivered by a bipolar tungsten - stimulating electrode placed in layer v / vi of the acc .
the internal solution containing gdp - beta - s was used when the experiment to detect the involvement of postsynaptic g proteins was performed .
for the recording of paired - pulse ratio ( ppr ) , a paired pulse paradigm was employed in which two stimuli were delivered at 50 ms inter - stimulus - interval .
picrotoxin ( 100 mum ) was always present to block gabaa receptor - mediated inhibitory synaptic currents in all experiments .
access resistance ( 15 - 30 momega ) was monitored throughout the experiment .
data were discarded if access resistance changed > 15 % during an experiment .
data analysis whole - cell patch - clamp data were collected and analyzed with clampex 10.2 and clampfit 10.2 software ( molecular devices ) .
for the evoked epscs , the amplitudes were normalized and expressed as the percentage of the baseline epsc amplitude .
miniature and spontaneous epscs were detected and analyzed using an event detection program ( mini analysis program ; synaptosoft , inc. , decatur , ga ) .
analysis of mepscs and sepscs was performed with cumulative probability plots .
for the ppr , the ratio of the slope of the second response to the slope of the first response was calculated and averaged .
for comparison between two groups , we used paired or unpaired student 's t test .
for comparison among three groups , we used one - way anova .
all data are presented as means +/ - sem .
in all cases , p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results effect of 5 - ht on excitatory transmission in the acc to explore the effect of 5 - ht on the glutamatergic neurotransmission in the acc , we performed whole - cell patch - clamp recordings from pyramidal neurons in layer ii / iii , where the stimulation electrodes were placed in layer v / vi ( fig. 1a ) .
to identify pyramidal neurons , depolarized currents were injected into neurons to induce action potentials .
the typical firing pattern of pyramidal neurons exhibited as significant firing frequency adaptation in response to the prolonged depolarizing - current injection [ 21 ] , whereas interneurons showed fast - spiking action potentials followed by pronounced hyperpolarization [ 19 ] ( fig. 1a ) .
in the presence of the gabaa receptor antagonist , picrotoxin ( 100 mum ) , epscs evoked by a single - pulse stimulation were recorded with the membrane potential holding at - 60 mv and the baseline amplitude of eepscs was adjusted at 50 - 100 pa. after obtaining stable baseline eepscs for at least 10 min , we bath applied 5 - ht ( 5 mum or 50 mum ) for 10 min and then washed the system with oxygenated acsf for another 10 min .
the amplitude of evoked epscs were significantly decreased after bath application of 5 - ht in a dose - dependent manner ( 5 mum : 67.3 +/ - 4.2 % of baseline , n = 9 neurons / 6 mice , p < 0.01 , see fig. 1c , d , e ; 50 mum : 50.6 +/ - 8.7 % of baseline , n = 6 / 4 , p < 0.01 , data not shown ) , indicating that glutamatergic transmission in the acc was inhibited by 5 - ht. washing out of 5 - ht with control acsf , it partially reversed the reduction of eepsc amplitude caused by 5 - ht ( 5 mum : 80.5 +/ - 7.4 % of baseline , n = 9 / 6 , p < 0.05 compared with the 5 - ht , fig. 1d and e ; 50 mum : 66.1 +/ - 6.3 % of baseline , n = 6 / 4 , data not shown ). fig. 1 bath application of 5 - ht reduced the amplitude of evoked epsc .

e summary of the effect of 5 - ht ( 5 mum ) and washout on the amplitude of eepsc .
bath application of 5 - ht significantly reduced eepscs amplitude and washing the system with fresh acsf partially but evidently reversed the decreased eepsc ( n = 9 neurons / 6 mice ) .
** p < 0.01 compared to baseline ; # p < 0.05 compared to the group of 5 - ht altered paired - pulse ratio by 5 - ht to investigate whether presynaptic or postsynaptic mechanisms mediate the effects of 5 - ht on excitatory synaptic transmission in the acc , we examined ppr in acc .
an alteration of ppr reflects the change in release probability from presynaptic terminals .
bath application of 5 - ht ( 5 mum ) significantly increased the ppr at a stimulus interval of 50 ms in most of recording acc pyramidal neurons ( baseline 1.53 +/ - 0.08 ; 5 - ht 1.79 +/ - 0.11 , n = 10 of 12 neurons from 7 mice , p < 0.05 ; fig. 2a and b ; the other two neurons : one had no remarkable change , the other decreased from 1.41 to 1.19 ) .
this finding indicates that the presynaptic mechanism is involved in 5 - ht - mediated inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission in the acc. fig. 2 bath application of 5 - ht increased paired - pulse ratio .
a paired - pulse ratio ( the ratio of epsc2 / epsc1 ) was recorded with a 50 ms interval .

5 - ht increased the ppr notably ( n = 10 neurons / 7 mice ) .
* p < 0.05 compared to baseline effect of 5 - ht on sepsc in the acc spontaneous events are thought to be the results of the presynaptic action potential evoked neurotransmitter vesicles release from the readily releasable pool [ 22 ] .
the effects of 5 - ht on sepsc in the pyramidal neurons of acc were examined .
as shown in fig. 3 , the frequency of sepsc was significantly decreased in most of the recorded neurons with the bath application of 5 - ht ( baseline 1.20 +/ - 0.10 hz ; 5 - ht , 0.73 +/ - 0.07 hz , n = 12 of 15 neurons / 7 mice , p < 0.01 ; fig. 3a , c , e ; the other 3 neurons did not change significantly ) .
a cumulative fraction plot showed an evident increase of inter - event - interval during 5 - ht application ( fig. 3c ) .
in those responded neurons , following washout with acsf , the decreased sepsc frequency could be reversed partly but not totally ( 5 - ht 0.73 +/ - 0.07 hz , washout 0.97 +/ - 0.06 hz , n = 12 / 7 , p < 0.01 ; fig. 3a , c , e ) .
the amplitude of sepsc was not affected by the application of 5 - ht or washout with control acsf ( baseline 12.9 +/ - 0.8 pa , 5 - ht 14.7 +/ - 0.6 pa , washout 13.7 +/ - 0.5 , n = 15 / 7 ; fig. 3a , b , d ). fig. 3 effect of 5 - ht on sepsc recorded in neurons of the acc .

** p < 0.01 compared to baseline ; # p < 0.05 compared to the phase of 5 - ht application effect of 5 - ht on mepsc miniature synaptic transmission is resulted from neurotransmitter release independent of action potential [ 23 ] , which occurs randomly in the absence of stimuli [ 24 ] .
we recorded mepscs in the acc pyramidal neurons in the presence of 1.0 mum tetrodotoxin to further determine the role of presynaptic mechanisms in the inhibitory effects of 5 - ht. we found that mepsc frequency in most of the recorded neurons were reduced after perfusing 5 - ht ( baseline 0.84 +/ - 0.10 hz ; 5 - ht , 0.52 +/ - 0.05 hz , n = 10 of 12 / 6 , p < 0.01 ; fig. 4a , c , e ; the other 2 neurons : one increased from 0.68 to 0.80 , one had no remarkable change ) .
a cumulative fraction plot showed an increase of inter - event - interval during 5 - ht application ( fig. 4c ) .
in those neurons that responded to 5 - ht application ( except the one increased ) , bath application of 5 - ht consistently reduced the frequency of mepscs to an average of 61.9 +/ - 6.0 % of baseline .
the inhibitory effect of 5 - ht on mepscs frequency was reversible and showed partially recovery following washout with control acsf ( 5 - ht : 0.52 +/ - 0.05 hz , washout 0.70 +/ - 0.07 hz , n = 10 / 6 , p < 0.05 ; fig. 4a , c , e ) .
as to the mepsc amplitude , we did not observe evident effect of 5 - ht in all recorded neurons ( baseline 9.6 +/ - 0.6 pa ; 5 - ht : 8.8 +/ - 0.7 pa , n = 12 / 6 , p > 0.05 ; fig. 4a , b , d ) .
these results showed that 5 - ht suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission via decreasing the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release in most neurons. fig. 4 effect of 5 - ht on mepsc recorded in neurons of the acc .

** p < 0.01 compared to baseline ; # p < 0.05 compared to the phase of 5 - ht application postsynaptic inhibition of g proteins attenuated the reduction of epsc caused by 5 - ht among 5 - ht receptors , only 5 - ht3 receptor is a ligand - gated ion channel and all other subtypes are members of g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcr ) [ 25 ] .
to investigate the role of postsynaptic 5 - ht receptors in 5 - ht - mediated inhibition of excitatory synaptic transmission , gdp - beta - s ( 1 mm ) , a nonhydrolysable analogue of gdp that competitively inhibited g - proteins , was added to the pipette internal solution .
5 - ht reduced the amplitude of evoked epsc to a mean of 86.4 +/ - 3.7 % of baseline in the presence of gdp - beta - s ( n = 9 / 5 , fig. 5 ) , which was significantly smaller compared to the recording without gdp - beta - s ( fig. 5 , p < 0.05 ) .
this result indicated that postsynaptic 5 - ht receptors were involved in the inhibitory effects of 5 - ht on excitatory synaptic transmission. fig. 5 5 - ht - mediated reduction of eepsc amplitude was inhibited by gdp - beta - s. a the averaged time course showing the change of eepsc amplitude after bath application of 5 - ht ( 5 mum ) in the recorded acc neurons with or without the internal solution containing gdp - beta - s ( 1 mm ) .

* p < 0.05 compared to baseline ; # p < 0.05 compared to the phase of 5 - ht application with gdp - beta - s in the internal solution of recording electrodes 5 - ht1a receptors involved in the inhibitory effect of 5 - ht 5 - ht receptor subtypes have been identified and cloned in the cns [ 26 ] .
previous studies report that some types of 5 - ht1 receptors were more often associated with an inhibitory effect on excitatory synaptic transmission in certain brain regions [ 16 , 27 ] .
however , the role of 5 - ht1a receptor in the acc has not been investigated .
we bath applied nan - 190 ( 5 mum ) , one antagonist of 5 - ht1a receptor , to examine its effects on serotonin - mediated inhibition .
we found the inhibitory effect of 5 - ht on eepsc was much smaller in the presence of nan - 190 , but nan - 190 did not block the inhibitory effects of 5 - ht on glutamatergic transmission ( 84.9 +/ - 4.1 % of baseline , n = 9 / 6 , paired t test , p < 0.05 ; fig. 6a , b , d ) .
pretreatment with nan - 190 blocked the increase of ppr caused by 5 - ht ( baseline 1.33 +/ - 0.11 , 5 - ht 1.39 +/ - 0.15 , n = 9 / 6 , paired t test , p > 0.05 ; fig. 6c , d ). fig. 6 5 - ht1a receptor was involved in the inhibiting effect of 5 - ht on synaptic transmission .

n = 9 neurons / 6 mice ; * p < 0.05 compared to baseline .
# p < 0.05 compared to the phase of 5 - ht application in the recording with nan - 190 prior adding to the system next , we examined the effects of 5 - ht on sepsc and mepsc in the presence of nan - 190 .
we found 5 - ht did not affect the frequency of sepsc ( baseline 1.24 +/ - 0.10 hz , 5 - ht 1.13 +/ - 0.16 hz , n = 7 / 5 , paired t test , p > 0.05 ; fig. 7 ) , as well as mepsc ( baseline 1.08 +/ - 0.10 hz , 5 - ht 1.04 +/ - 0.12 hz , n = 8 / 6 , paired t test , p > 0.05 ; fig. 8 ) in the presence of nan - 190 .
these results indicated that activation of 5 - ht1a receptor was likely to contribute to the inhibitory effect of 5 - ht on excitatory transmission in the acc .
however , the small residual effect of 5 - ht in the presence of nan - 190 suggested that other 5 - ht receptor subtype ( s ) may be involved. fig. 7 effect of 5 - ht on sepsc in the presence of nan - 190 .

in the presence of nan - 190 , one antagonist of 5 - ht1a receptor , both the frequency and amplitude did not change evidently after bath application of 5 - ht discussion in the present study , we tested the effects of 5 - ht on synaptic transmission in the acc .
we found that 5 - ht produced reversible inhibitory effects on the excitatory transmission in the acc .
5 - ht significantly decreased the frequency of sepsc and mepscs and increased the ppr of eepscs , suggesting that 5 - ht inhibited glutamate release from presynaptic terminals .
postsynaptic application of gdp - beta - s reduced the inhibitory effects of 5 - ht , indicating the involvement of postsynaptic 5 - ht receptors in 5 - ht produced inhibition .
application of 5 - ht1a receptors antagonist inhibited 5 - ht produced inhibition of eepsc amplitude and frequency , implying the involvement of presynaptic 5 - ht1a receptors in the inhibition of excitatory transmission .
5 - ht innervation in the acc in the mammalian brain , 5 - ht neurons can be divided into two major groups ( rostral group and caudal group ) based on cell body localization and their respective projections [ 28 ] .
the rostral group is located in the mesencephalic and rostral pons , projecting to the forebrain , and the caudal group is located in medulla oblongata , projecting to spinal cord and brain stem [ 28 ] .
the acc receives innervation from 5 - ht neurons located in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei , which belongs to rostral group [ 29 ] .
there are at least fourteen different subtype receptors for 5 - ht [ 26 ] .
most 5 - ht receptors belong to the gpcr superfamily with the exception of 5 - ht3 receptor , which is a ligand - gated ion channel mediating fast depolarization [ 25 ] .
in the acc , various 5 - ht receptors have been detected in mouse and rat brain , such as 5 - ht1a , 5 - ht1b , 5 - ht2a and 5 - ht7 [ 8 , 30 ] .
modulation of synaptic transmission by 5 - ht it is well known that 5 - ht regulates synaptic transmission by presynaptic and / or postsynaptic mechanisms .
for example , in the hippocampus , it has been reported that 5 - ht inhibited glutamatergic transmission via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms [ 31 ] .
in the ( bed nucleus of the stria terminalis , bnst ) , 5 - ht has been shown to suppress glutamatergic neurotransmission through activating presynaptic receptors [ 16 ] .
however , there is no report of the effects of 5 - ht on excitatory transmission in the acc .
in the present study , we found that 5 - ht inhibited the excitatory transmission in pyramidal neurons of the acc in a dose - dependent manner .
moreover , different experiments indicate that 5 - ht may produce such inhibition through both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms .
in contrast to the acc , in the spinal cord dorsal horn , a key sensory synapse for pain transmission and modulation , 5 - ht produced biphasic modulation of excitatory transmission between primary afferent fibers and spinal cord dorsal horn neurons [ 14 , 32 ] .
these findings suggest that 5 - ht modulation is different in various central synapses related to pain and / or emotion .
functional implications neurons in the acc are involved in pain perception [ 1 , 10 , 12 , 33 ] and emotional responses [ 12 , 34 ] .
long - term plastic changes in excitatory transmission in the acc modulate not only pain - related behaviors [ 35 ] but also the affective - emotional component of chronic pain [ 12 , 36 - 38 ] .
especially , presynaptic potentiation of excitatory transmission in the acc may be related pain - induced anxiety [ 12 , 36 ] .
serotonergic projections are known to be important for the regulation of different brain functions , including pain and emotion [ 39 ] .
clinical drugs used for the treatment of anxiety such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssris ) increase the level of synaptic 5 - ht. in the present study , we show that 5 - ht can significantly affect excitatory transmission in the acc .
it is possible that 5 - ht induced modulation in the acc may contribute to the physiological effects of ssris .
one of 5 - ht subtype receptors is 5 - ht1a .
5 - ht1a subtype receptors are highly expressed in the acc [ 25 , 40 ] .
it has been reported that 5 - ht1a receptors are involved in the development of neuronal circuits regulating anxiety , and 5 - ht1a receptor knockout mice shows enhanced anxiety levels [ 41 ] .
in our study , we found that 5 - ht1a mediate 5 - ht induced inhibition of excitatory transmission .
it is possible that changes in 5 - ht1a mediated modulation may contribute to chronic pain and anxiety .
future studies are clearly needed to investigate this possibility , and targeting 5 - ht receptors in the acc may provide new directions for future treatment of chronic pain and emotional disorders .

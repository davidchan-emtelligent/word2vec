background patients hoping to preserve their fertility receive conservative treatment with high - dose medroxyprogesterone acetate ( mpa ) for well - differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma ( ec ) or atypical endometrial hyperplasia ( aeh ) . such treatment generally involves frequent intrauterine operations , including dilation and curettage ( d & c ) and endometrial biopsy ( emb ) , which could result in endometritis , endometrial thinning , or intrauterine adhesion .
in turn , any of these outcomes could adversely affect implantation and pregnancy development .
the current study thus aimed to identify factors that might affect pregnancy following conservative treatment by mpa .
methods we compared a pregnancy group ( 45 patients ) with a non - pregnancy group ( 53 patients ) of mpa - treated patients to evaluate the factors affecting clinical pregnancy establishment .
we undertook a multivariate logistic regression analysis based on factors shown by univariate analysis to be significantly different between the groups .
univariate analysis identified number of d & c , endometrial thickness , duration of mpa administration , age of pregnancy permission ( the age at which a patient was first allowed to attempt pregnancy after disappearance of the lesion ) , period of disappearance of lesions , and recurrence as independent variables .
results the odds ratios ( 95 % confidence interval ) of multivariate analysis for disease recurrence , endometrial thickness during ovulation , and age of pregnancy permission were 0.283 ( 0.102 - 0.785 ) , 1.677 ( 1.251 - 2.248 ) , and 0.889 ( 0.792 - 0.998 ) , respectively .
there was no significant difference in the other independent variables between groups .
conclusions we identified three factors considered to affect pregnancy establishment following conservative treatment with mpa : recurrence , endometrial thickness during ovulation , and the age of the pregnancy permission .
introduction of infertility treatment including assisted reproductive technology ( art ) soon after achieving tumor disappearance by mpa would therefore be beneficial for patients with disease recurrence , thin endometrium , or a higher age of pregnancy permission .

atypical endometrial hyperplasia ( aeh ) is a precancerous lesion , but 29 % of such cases progress to ec within several years [ 4 ] .
the standard treatment of ec / aeh includes a total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy resulting in total loss of fertility [ 5 ] ; however , with the recent trend for delayed marriage , many women who have been diagnosed with ec / aeh do not accept the standard treatment .
instead , conservative treatment using medroxyprogesterone acetate ( mpa ) is increasingly used as an effective fertility - preserving therapy for early stage ec and aeh without myometrial invasion or extra - uterine spread .
mpa confers a progesterone receptor - mediated anti - tumor effect , inhibition against estrogen action [ 6 ] , and inhibition of angiogenesis not mediated via progesterone receptors [ 7 ] .
mpa may also reduce the number of glandular cells and decidualization of the stroma [ 6 , 8 ] .
a disadvantage of the conservative treatment with mpa is the need for frequent intrauterine operations including dilation and curettage ( d & c ) and endometrial biopsy ( emb ) that can cause endometritis , endometrial thinning , and intra - uterine adhesion .
these potential effects of mpa raise concerns about associated adverse effects on uterine implantation , as does the high tumor relapse rate associated with such conservative treatment .
therefore , patients treated by mpa are advised to try pregnancy establishment early after the treatment .
pregnancy is commonly reported following conservative treatment [ 9 - 13 ] ; however , there are no reports on the factors that contribute to pregnancy in such patients .
in the current study , we compared a pregnancy group with a non - pregnancy group to elucidate variables significant in establishing pregnancy after conservative treatment for ec / aeh .
methods the institutional review board of keio university school of medicine approved the current retrospective study ( approved number # 20110237 ) , which comprised patients diagnosed with ec stage ia ( g1 ) or aeh at the keio university hospital from january 1998 to december 2012 .
four patients diagnosed as ec stage ia ( g2 ) and who clearly understood the significant risks of disease recurrence and progression elected to receive conservative treatment .
after careful examination using transvaginal ultrasonography , magnetic resonance imaging , and hysteroscopy to rule out myometrial or cervical invasion , and , if needed , computed tomography to confirm that the patient had neither distant metastasis nor double cancer , endometrial curettage was performed to determine the initial pathological diagnosis and to remove lesions .
informed consent was obtained from all patients regarding the risk of disease progression , in undergoing conservative treatment with mpa ( 600 mg / day ) instead of the standard therapy of total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo - oophorectomy .
we almost performed conservative treatment according to the same protocol ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
an endometrial biopsy was performed once a month up to three months after initiating mpa administration , and d & c was performed at 4 months using a metallic curette .
in cases with residual lesions , mpa administration was continued , and d & c was performed every 2 months for up to 12 months to monitor any progression of the lesion .
in cases with no residual lesions , mpa was discontinued and an attempt of pregnancy was permitted , but emb was concurrently performed every 3 - 4 months .
patients who did not wish to conceive immediately underwent holmstrom therapy , whereby mpa ( 15 mg / day ) was administered orally for 12 days after 14 days from the start of withdrawal bleeding .
study end - points subjects were divided into a pregnancy group and a non - pregnancy group , and data were collected regarding number of d & c , duration of mpa administration , and endometrial thickness during ovulation .
we then analyzed the data to determine the pregnancy - affecting factors .
exclusion criteria all patients undergoing conservative treatment ( n = 174 ) did not necessarily wish to conceive immediately ; therefore , subjects were limited to those wishing to conceive following therapy .
we excluded women aged >= 42 years at the time of the initial treatment ( n = 11 ) , women without a partner ( n = 44 ) , and women with no fertile period or for whom detailed medical records could not be obtained immediately following conservative treatment ( n = 17 ) .
the remaining 98 women were divided into a pregnancy group ( n = 45 ) and a non - pregnancy group ( n = 53 ) .
definitions in the present study , pregnancy was defined as a serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin >= 25 miu / ml or observation of a gestational sac on a transvaginal ultrasound scan .
an abnormal menstrual cycle was defined as a menstrual cycle not lasting 25 - 38 days .
endometrial thickness is reported to reach its minimum on day 4 of the menstrual cycle , then increase by 1 mm / day to a plateau on day 9 [ 14 ] .
therefore , endometrial thickness during ovulation was measured in the sagittal plane by transvaginal ultrasound scan when the follicle diameter was observed to be >= 16 mm. the age of pregnancy permission was defined as the age at which the patient was first allowed to attempt pregnancy after disappearance of the lesion .
periods of disappearance of lesions were defined as from the start of the administration till diagnosis of the disappearance of lesions .
follow up was defined as the period from the start of mpa administration to the final medical examination .
possible intrauterine adhesion was investigated in 81 cases in which hysteroscopy was performed during mpa therapy and in which a detailed intrauterine examination was performed during treatment by transcervical resection .
a good - quality embryo was morphologically defined by a veeck classification >= grade 2 on day 2 / 3 [ 15 ] or a gardner classification >= 3bb on day 5 after oocyte pick up [ 16 ] .
statistical analysis shapiro - wilk tests for all data showed a non - normal distribution .
mann - whitney u tests were used for statistical analysis , while nominal scale comparisons were performed using the pearson chi - squared test ( see footnotes a and b in table 1 ) .
multicollinearity was examined using the spearman rank correlation coefficient to create a correlation matrix ; it was confirmed that no combination of the independent variables demonstrated a correlation coefficient with an absolute value >= 0.9 .
multivariate analysis was performed in the pregnancy and non - pregnancy groups using endometrial thickness , number of d & c , duration of mpa administration , age of pregnancy permission , and recurrence as independent variables , using a logistic regression to determine the likelihood ratio .
model chi - squared test results with p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant .
analyses were conducted using spss version 15.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
results patient characteristics patient characteristics of the pregnancy group ( n = 45 ) and the non - pregnancy group ( n = 53 ) are summarized in table 1 .
the average age of the first pregnancy was 34.8 +/ - 3.9 years .
there were no significant differences between the groups in age of initial treatment , nulliparity , histological type / grade , body mass index , pco on ultrasonography , irregular menstrual cycle , or use of ovarian stimulation .

thus , these five factors were used as independent variables for the multivariate logistic regression analysis ( table 4 ) , which identified recurrence ( odds ratio 0.283 ; 95 % ci 0.10 - 0.785 ) , endometrial thickness during ovulation ( 1.677 ; 1.251 - 2.248 ) , and age of pregnancy permission ( 0.889 ; 0.792 - 0.998 ) as significant factors affecting pregnancy outcomes .

in the current study , regression analysis of the correlation between ultrasonographically measured endometrial thickness during 365 ovulation cycles ( included the same person ) and the number of d & c procedures ( 1 - 10 ) for all the subjects yielded an absolute value of 0.4 , indicating a correlation ( fig. 1 ) .
in the regression analysis , the regression equation was significant ( p < 0.01 ) according to an analysis of variance ( anova ) table , as was the regression coefficient ( p < 0.01 ) .
curvilinear regression demonstrated that endometrial thickness during ovulation decreases as the number of d & c procedures increase. fig. 1 regression analysis of the correlation between ultrasonographically measured endometrial thickness during 365 ovulation cycles ( included the same person ) and the number of d & c procedures ( 1 - 10 ) for all the subjects yielded an absolute value of 0.4 , indicating a correlation .
the regression equation was significant ( p < 0.01 ) according to an analysis of variance ( anova ) table , as was the regression coefficient ( p < 0.01 ) .
curvilinear regression demonstrated that endometrial thickness during ovulation decreases as the number of d & c procedures increase discussion in the current retrospective study , the ec / aeh patients who had undergone conservative treatment with mpa were divided into pregnancy and non - pregnancy groups , which were compared to determine factors in conservative treatment contributing to pregnancy after achieving complete response .
based on the multivariate multiple regression analysis , disease recurrence , endometrial thickness during ovulation , and the age of pregnancy permission were significantly associated with pregnancy establishment .
although a significant difference in the age of pregnancy permission was observed , with an or of 0.889 , its effect on pregnancy was considered small .
thus , we concluded that recurrence and endometrial thickness , with ors of 0.283 and 1.677 , respectively , have an important effect on pregnancy establishment among the factors examined in the study .
in general , sufficient endometrial thickness is important for pregnancy establishment [ 18 - 25 ] , and when endometrial thickness is <= 7 mm , the functional layer is thin or absent , resulting in implantation of the embryo near the spinal artery .
high blood flow impedance of radial arteries impairs the growth of the glandular epithelium and results in decreased vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) levels in the endometrium .
low vegf and low blood flow lead to a " thin " endometrium , which is related to impaired endometrial receptivity [ 26 ] .
these previous data thus support the result of our multivariate multiple regression analysis that endometrial thickness is an important factor for pregnancy outcomes after conservative treatment for ec / aeh .
therefore , it is necessary to minimize damage to normal endometrium .
to this end , fujimoto et al .
[ 27 , 28 ] suggested that hysteroscopic resection of early stage ec combined with hormonal therapy might be more effective than endometrial curettage for eliminating lesions in such patients hoping to preserve their fertility .
such an approach would minimize a specimen , but does not increase the risk of peritoneal dissemination [ 29 ] .
we further studied if the number of d & c procedures is a potential confounder of thin endometrium .
endometrial thickness was measured in 365 cycles of ovulation following conservative treatment and regression analysis consequently showed that endometrial thickness during ovulation decreases as the number of d & c increases ( p < 0.01 ) .
furthermore , repeated d & c procedures might increase intrauterine adhesion [ 30 ] .
in the current study , the frequency of intrauterine adhesions after d & c in the pregnancy group was not significantly different from that in the non - pregnancy group by univariate analysis .
although nearly all of the intrauterine adhesions that we observed were mild , film - like adhesions not likely to affect pregnancy , a future extensive analysis of more cases is needed to accurately determine the number of d & c likely to significantly impair fertility .
on the other hand , mpa administration causes histological changes in the endometrium , including a decreased gland - to - stroma ratio , reduction in the number of glandular cells , decidualization of the stroma , and decreased mitosis [ 6 , 8 ] .
these effects may cause atrophy and thinning of the endometrium , and considerable time is likely needed for the tissue 's functional recovery after mpa termination .
randall et al .
[ 31 ] reported that a median duration of 9 months is required after progestin therapy for the lesions to improve , and herein , we showed that the period from mpa termination till the beginning of the final menstrual cycle before pregnancy was 314.0 +/ - 392.8 days .
accordingly , the duration of mpa administration also might be a potential confounder of endometrial thinning .
conservative treatment needs to provide a promising option for ec / aeh patients who wish to preserve fertility .
however , there is a considerable risk of lesion recurrence and disease progression with such therapies .
yamazawa et al .
[ 32 ] reported a recurrence rate of approximately 35 % , while ushijima and chiva et al .
[ 33 , 34 ] reported that tumors recur in 20 - 47.9 months .
furthermore , the current study found that 61 of 98 ( 62.2 %) patients experienced recurrence during the follow - up period ( 2189 +/ - 1346 days ) from the start of mpa administration to the final medical examination .
therefore , pregnancy should be promptly attempted following complete response to conservative treatment in ec / aeh patients .
furthermore , it is known that the infertility rate is higher among ec / aeh patients than among the general population , due to an increased prevalence of anovulatory cycles or polycystic ovaries .
based on these discussion points , infertility treatment is strongly recommended after achieving a complete response to conservative treatment , to enhance the chance of pregnancy .
all patients tried to conceive by natural conception after receiving mpa , and those who could not easily fall pregnant proceeded to iui or ivf .
the current study indeed demonstrated many cases of pregnancy occurring early after the cessation of treatment through natural methods ( no infertility treatment : 18 cases , timed sexual intercourse : 8 cases ) and the use of fertility agents for ovarian stimulation ( clomiphene citrate : 8 cases , hmg : 7 cases ) .
in addition , but importantly , ichinose et al .
[ 35 ] reported that the use of fertility drugs did not increase the recurrence of ec / aeh .
art has been reported as a useful alternative for ec / aeh patients after conservative treatment [ 36 ] ; however , in the current study , only 13 out of 52 pregnancies required the aid of art , and only 2 of the 15 patients who received art at our hospitals in the study were successful in achieving pregnancy ( additional file 2 : table s1 and 3 : table s2 ) .
these patients who became pregnant were aged 32 and 34 years , and did not have thin endometrium .
the other 13 non - pregnant patients were at least 37 years old , and 9 were older than 40 years .
since morphologically good embryos were transferred in the majority of cases based on the reproductive outcomes achieved in another clinic , we deduced that failed ivf was most likely attributable to an endometrial factor and not embryo quality .
at an advanced age , endometrial thinning resulted from mpa therapy and d & c , as well as maternal age , could contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes with art .
thus , this study could not provide any evidence on the effectiveness of art for ec / aeh patients after conservative treatment .
nonetheless , the age of pregnancy permission and recurrence were also shown by the multivariate regression analysis as a significant factor for pregnancy outcomes after conservative treatment .
a higher age of pregnancy permission and a prolonged period of medical treatment due to recurrence may be accompanied by ovarian aging and hypofunction .
considering the possibility of recurrence , early referral to an infertility treatment specialist and proactive recommendation of art should be advised for ec / aeh patients who have already experienced recurrence , have a long period till remission , or have a higher age of pregnancy permission and / or thin endometrium .
conclusions tumor recurrence , endometrial thickness during ovulation , and the age of pregnancy permission were found to affect pregnancy establishment following conservative treatment .
a prompt introduction of infertility treatment including art following conservative treatment should be advised for ec / aeh patients with thin endometrium , a higher age of pregnancy permission or recurrence , and a long period till remission .

our conservative treatment protocol .
we generally performed conservative treatment according to the same protocol .
an endometrial biopsy was performed once a month up to three months after initiating mpa administration and d & c was performed at 4 months .
in cases with residual lesions , mpa administration was continued , and d & c was performed every 2 months for up to 12 months .
in cases with no residual lesions , mpa was discontinued and an attempt at pregnancy was permitted , while emb was concurrently performed every 3 - 4 months .

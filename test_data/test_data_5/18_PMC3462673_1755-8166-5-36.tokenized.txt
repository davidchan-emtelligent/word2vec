background the so - called philadelphia ( ph ) chromosome is present in more than 90 % of chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) cases .
it results in juxtaposition of the 5 ' part of the bcr gene on chromosome 22 to the 3 ' part of the abl gene on chromosome 9 .
since the majority of cml cases are currently treated with imatinib , variant rearrangements in general have no specific prognostic significance , although the mechanisms involved in resistance to therapy have yet to be investigated .
the t315i mutation within the abl - gene is the most frequent one associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors .
results this study evaluated a ph chromosome positive cml case resistant to imatinib mesylate .
a dic ( 17 ; 18 ) , loss of tp53 gene , co - expression of b2a2 and b3a2 fusions transcript and a t315i mutation were found .
conclusions we reported here a novel case of a ph chromosome positive cml with a secondary abnormality [ dic ( 17 ; 18 )] , resulting to glivec resistance but good response to nilotinib .
the dic ( 17 ; 18 ) might be a marker for poor prognosis in cml .
our finding indicated for an aggressive progression of the disease .
the patient died under the treatment due to unknown reasons .
dic ( 17 ; 18 ) chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) tp53 gene t315i fluorescence in situ hybridization ( fish ) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) imatinib resistant background chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) is a clonal malignant disorder of a pluripotent hematopoetic stem cell characterized by the presence of the philadelphia ( ph ) chromosome in more than 90 % of patients .
the ph chromosome is a product of the reciprocal translocation t ( 9 ; 22 )( q34 ; q11 ) , which transposes the 3 ' portion of the abl oncogene from 9q34 to the 5 ' portion of the bcr gene on 22q11.2 .
the crucial pathogenetic consequence of this translocation is the creation of a chimeric bcr / abl gene on the derivative chromosome 22 [ 1 ] .
the expression of the bcr / abl chimeric protein with an increased tyrosine kinase activity plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of cml [ 2 ] .
the progression of cml from chronic phase ( cp ) to blast crisis ( bc ) is frequently associated with nonrandom secondary chromosomal aberrations such as + 8 , i ( 17q ) , + 19 and an extra ph chromosome [ 3 ] .
at the molecular level , mutation of the tumor suppressor gene tp53 located at 17p13 is detected in 25 - 30 % of cml - bc. however , no mutation of the remaining tp53 allele in cml cases with i ( 17q ) has been noted [ 4 ] .
knowledge of the biology of cml has enabled targeted therapies in preclinical and clinical oncology .
imatinib ( glivec , formerly sti571 ) was the first available bcr / abl targeted therapy and produced complete cytogenetic responses in 70 - 85 % of patients with cml in early cp [ 5 ] .
however , despite the stunning efficacy of this agent , resistance or intolerance to imatinib can be observed .
moreover , imatinib does not completely eradicate residual leukemic stem cells and progenitors [ 6,7 ] .
also , failure to respond to imatinib was in some cml patients result of mutations arising in the bcr - abl kinase domain ( kd ) , leading to shortened survivals of cml patients with these mutations [ 8 ] .
t315i is one of the most frequent mutations associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tki ) , not only to the 1st generation tki such as imatinib , but also to the newly approved 2nd generation tki such as nilotinib and dasatinib [ 9 ] .
here we reported a novel case of a ph chromosome positive cml with dic ( 17 ; 18 ) , loss of tp53 gene , co - expression of b2a2 and b3a2 fusions transcript and t315i mutation resulting in glivec resistance , while good response in nilotinib was observed ; i.e. the clone with the dicentric chromosome decreased under this treatment from 100 % to 80 % .
case report a 19 - year old woman was diagnosed with cml in chronic phase ( cp ) in august 2003 as she had higher white blood cell ( wbc ) counts and splenomegaly previously .
in march 2010 , the patient presented for the fifth time ( for further details see table 1 ) with a wbc of 2.2x109 / l consisting of 25 % neutrophils , 73 % lymphocytes , 1 % monocytes and 1 % eosinophiles .
the platelets count was 111x109 / l and the hemoglobin level was 9.5 g / dl. the patient was treated with nilotinib at 800 mg / day for overall 5 months .
in november 2010 , she passed away under the treatment due to unknown reasons .

t315i mutation 6 november 2010 the patient passed away under the treatment due to unknown reasons karyotyping was performed before and after of chemotherapy treatment .
the result after chemotherapy ( for further details see table 1 ) was 45,xx,t ( 9 ; 22 ),+ dic ( 17 ; 18 ) , - 17 , - 18 [ 16 ]/ 46,xx,t ( 9 ; 22 )[ 4 ] ( figure 1 ) and further specified by molecular cytogenetic studies ( figure 2 ) .
dual - color - fish using a probe specific for bcr and abl revealed that a typical ph chromosome with bcr / abl - translocation was present in all studied metaphases and nuclei ( figure 2a ) .
cep 17 and 18 probes showed a dicentric chromosome leading to deletions of parts of the short arms of the involved chromosomes ( figure 2b ) .
the locus - specific probe 17p13 ( p53 ) confirmed the absence of the 17p on the dicentric chromosome ( figure 2c ) .
finally , amcb using probes for the corresponding chromosomes was performed as previously reported [ 10 ] ; figure 2d ) .
thus , the following final karyotype was determined : 45,xx,t ( 9 ; 22 )( q34 ; q11 ),+ dic ( 17 ; 18 )( p13.1 ; q11.2 ) , - 17 , - 18 [ 16 ]/ 46,xx,t ( 9 ; 22 )( q34 ; q11 )[ 4 ] .
the rt - pcr demonstrated co - expression of b2a2 and b3a2 fusions transcripts as most often found in cml ( figure 3 ) .

discussion according to the literature , a dic ( 17 ; 18 ) is a recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) [ dic ( 17 ; 18 )( p12 ; p11 ) [ 11 ]] , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll ) [ dic ( 17 ; 18 )( p11.2 ; p11.2 ) [ 12 ]] and cml - bc [ dic ( 17 ; 18 )( p11 ; p11 ) [ 13 ]] .
to the best of our knowledge , the present case is the only ever seen case of ph chromosome - positive cml - cp with dic ( 17 ; 18 )( p13.1 ; q11.2 ) , loss of tp53 gene , co - expression of b2a2 and b3a2 fusions transcript and t315i mutation resulting in glivec resistance [ 14 ] .
during cml progression , isochromosome ( 17 )( q10 ) is one of the non - random changes .
this aberration is associated with loss of tp53 and mostly with poor prognosis [ 15 ] .
point mutation and / or deletion of the tp53 gene are regarded as potentially important steps in the development of various hematological malignances , low response to chemotherapy , and short survival [ 16,17 ] .
the dic ( 17 ; 18 ) led also to the loss of p53 gene .
most of the cml patients express b2a2 or b3a2 of bcr - abl mrna encoding for p210 bcr - abl tyrosine kinase [ 18 ] .
in this study we found co - expression of b2a2 and b3a2 .
co - expression of more than one type of fusion transcript in a patient may be caused by alternative splicing or phenotypic variation , with clinical courses different from classic cml [ 19 ] .
a point mutation in the abl part of the abl - bcr fusion protein resulting in a t315i change can be found in cml patients which are resistant to glivec .
it has been reported that 50 - 90 % of hematological relapse is associated with an abl point mutation in the atp binding site , and the catalytic domain or the activation loop of the abl kinase domain [ 20 ] .
molecularly , mutations have been frequently found involving the kinase domain of the bcr - abl gene .
particularly poor prognoses are associated with mutations in the atp loop [ 21 ] .
dasatinib is effective against most mutants of abl in vitro and in imatinib - resistant cml patients [ 22 ] .
most of the patients with bcr - abl mutations achieved a clinical response under dasatinib , even in mutations not explored in vitro .
however , despite high impact in vitro and even if all patients showed improvement of their clinical state , various levels of responses are seen in the patients [ 22 ] .
in the present case , five months after the start of treatment with nilotinib , gtg and fish showed absence of dic ( 17 ; 18 ) in 20 % of the cells but a remainder ph chromosome in 100 % of metaphases studied .
in conclusion , we reported here a novel case of a ph chromosome positive cml with dic ( 17 ; 18 ) , loss of tp53 gene , co - expression of b2a2 and b3a2 fusions transcript and t315i mutation resulting to glivec resistance but good response to nilotinib .
the dic ( 17 ; 18 ) might be a marker for poor prognosis in cml .

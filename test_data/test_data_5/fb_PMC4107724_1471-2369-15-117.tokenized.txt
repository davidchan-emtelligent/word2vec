background we evaluated accuracy of urinary liver type fatty acid - binding protein ( l - fabp ) for prediction of early allograft function and compared it to neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin ( ngal ) , diuresis and urinary creatinine excretion rate ( ucr ) .
methods urine samples from 71 consecutive patients were taken 4 , 10 , 24 and 48 h after transplantation .
we classified recipients into two groups : immediate graft function ( igf ) , with more than 70 % reduction of serum cr at 7th day post - transplant , and delayed graft function ( dgf )/ slow graft function ( sgf ) group ( dgf - the need for hemodialysis procedure in the first week , sgf - less than 70 % reduction of serum cr in the first week ) .
results thirty - one recipients had igf and 40 had dgf / sgf .
l - fabp was only useful 48 h post - transplant with roc auc of 0.85 ( 95 % c.i .
0.74 - 0.92 ) ; ngal 24 h post - transplant had roc auc of 0.82 ( 0.7 - 0.91 ) .
sensitivity , specificity , ppv and npv for prediction of dgf / sgf with l - fabp > 9.5 mg / mmol cr and ngal > 33.1 mug / mmol cr were : 86 , 80 , 83 and 83 % ( l - fabp ) , and 68 , 93 , 91 , and 73 % ( ngal ) .
the difference in urine output between the groups was largest 4 h post - transplant ( p = 0.001 ) , later on the difference diminished .
there were no significant differences in roc auc between l - fabp at 48 h , ngal at 24 h , urine output at 4 h and ucr excretion rate at 10 h post - transplant .
ucr < 0.56 mmol / h 10 h post - transplant predicted dgf / sgf with 94 % sensitivity , 84 % specificity , 89 % ppv and 91 % npv , roc auc was 0.9 .
classification tree with urine output 4 h and ucr 10 h post - transplant accurately predicted 89 % of outcomes .
when l - fabp or ngal were added , the prediction was accurate in 92 or 90 % , respectively .
conclusions l - fabp is comparable to ngal for prediction of first week allograft function , however ucr and diuresis were non - inferior .
biomarker kidney transplantation delayed graft function outcome background acute kidney injury ( aki ) that occurs at transplantation often progresses to delayed graft function ( dgf ) [ 1 ] .
dgf may be defined as an allograft injury that causes the use of dialysis in the first week after transplantation [ 2 ] .
it is associated with increased risk of graft loss , acute rejection and worse allograft function [ 3 ] .
while it is possible to predict the risk of dgf through the use of many donor - and recipient - associated factors [ 4 ] , the prediction is not perfect and markers with a better predictive value are warranted .
in the recent years , the urine biomarkers of aki have become available .
neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( ngal ) is a protein from lipocalin family and induced in the renal tissue in the conditions of ischemia - reperfusion injury , with tissue protective properties [ 5 ] .
in the studies examining its predictive capability for dgf area under the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curve was between 0.75 and 0.9 [ 6 - 8 ] , thus showing a good prognostic value for dgf .
similar were results for urine interleukin - 18 ( 6 , 7 ) .
another interesting marker of ischemia - reperfusion injury is liver type fatty acid binding protein ( l - fabp ) found in proximal tubular cells .
during ischemic injury l - fabp binds lipid peroxidation products and alleviates oxidative stress [ 9 ] .
it is useful for diagnosis of various forms of aki [ 10 ] and its urinary concentration showed an excellent correlation with ischemia time in living - related kidney transplantation [ 9 ] .
its possible role as a marker and predictor of allograft function in the clinical setting of deceased donor kidney transplantation ( ddkt ) has been examined [ 11 ] but no data on exact predictive value for early allograft function were reported so far .
when looking at studies of the predictive values of various urinary biomarkers for early allograft function there are several uncertainties left unanswered .
it is long known that the level of diuresis after kidney transplantation is useful and perhaps one of the most clinically used predictors of allograft function , however in many of the studies the predictive value of urinary biomarkers was not rigorously compared to the level of diuresis .
often , an arbitrary level of urine output of 1 liter on day 1 post transplant was used to compare the predictive value of diuresis to various urinary biomarkers [ 7,8 ] , however the predictive value of diuresis after transplant may vary with time and clinical protocols of fluid and diuretic management .
furthermore , urinary creatinine ( ucr ) concentration , another traditionally used predictor of kidney function recovery [ 12 ] , was often not reported in these studies .
currently therefore it is hard to answer what is the exact benefit of novel urinary biomarkers above and beyond the traditionally used ( and very cheap ) monitoring of diuresis and ucr .
finally , the normalization of urinary biomarker to ucr concentration was variable between studies and it is not clear if there is a consistent benefit of normalization to ucr concentration for increasing the predictive value of urine biomarkers .
we have designed this study with two main goals .
first , we wanted to examine the prognostic accuracy of urinary l - fabp for early allograft function in deceased donor kidney transplantation and to compare it to the well established urinary biomarker ngal .
we searched for the best timing of l - fabp sampling and analyzed the impact of normalization to ucr .
second , we used this data to compare the value of both novel urinary biomarkers to traditional predictors of allograft recovery - diuresis and ucr concentration .
the product of both quantities - ucr excretion rate - was also analyzed in this regard .
methods we conducted a single centre prospective observational cohort study of adult patients receiving a deceased - donor kidney transplant in the period from november 1st , 2010 till may 28th , 2012 .
we obtained informed consent from all participants and the research was approved by the national medical ethics committee .
all transplantations were conducted through eurotransplant program .
the recipients of ddkt were excluded from the study in case of early surgical complication known at time of biomarker sampling ( renal vein and arterial trombosis ) and transplantectomy .
induction immunosuppression routinely consisted of basiliximab , cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids [ 13 ] .
patient and donor data were obtained from interview , patient medical documentation and eurotransplant donor medical files before the transplant operation .
time of transplantation was defined at the time of surgical establishment of blood flow through the allograft in the recipient .
after this time point the urine samples were taken 4 , 10 , 24 and 48 h later ( urine samples 1,2,3 and 4 ) .
these samples were taken from the fresh urine obtained with bladder catheter in all cases .
a minimum of 20 ml of urine was sampled and immediately transported to laboratory for centrifugation and storage .
in a subset of patients with residual diuresis voided urine sample before transplantation was obtained ( urine sample 0 ) .
at the time of collection of post - transplant samples hourly diuresis was measured with the routine clinical urine collecting bag and measurement container to the nearest 5 ml. urine was centrifuged 10 minutes at 3000 rpm and supernatant was stored at - 30degreesc .
urine creatinine ( ucr ) concentration was measured spectrophotometrically with the use of standard kinetic jaffe 's reaction ( system dimensiona xpand , siemens ) .
serum creatinine ( scr ) concentrations were measured with the kinetically compensated jaffe 's method ( system advia 1800 , siemens , tarrytown , usa ) .
ucr excretion rate at the sampling time points in mmol / h was calculated by multiplying ucr concentration of the sample with the hourly diuresis in the last hour before the sampling .
ngal concentration was measured only in the sample 3 ( 24 h post - transplant ) .
turbidimetric immune assay ( bioporto diagnostics ) on the system olympus au 400 was used .
all samples were measured in the same analytic procedure , intra - assay variability was up to 6 % .
l - fabp concentration was measured in the samples 0 to 4 .
enzyme linked immunoassay was used ( hk404 human l - fabp set , hycult biotech ) .
all samples were measured in the same series with intra - assay variation of 9.5 % .
scr concentration was routinely measured 3 - 5 hours after transplant operation and at each post - operative day in the first week .
when the relative scr decrement was more than 70 % in the first post - transplant week , the recipients were designated as immediate graft function ( igf ) .
relative scr decrement was calculated as the difference between first scr value at 3 - 5 h on day 0 and the value on day 7 divided by scr at 3 - 5 h on day 0 .
recipients who had a relative scr decrement lower than 70 % were designated as slow graft function ( sgf ) and recipients with at least one haemodialysis procedure in the first post - transplant week were designated as delayed graft function ( dgf ) .
for the purpose of statistical analysis the recipients were divided into two groups : igf and others ( sgf and dgf combined ) .
all statistical tests were performed two - tailed with a significance level of 0.05 .
results are presented as mean +/ - sd for normally distributed parameters , median ( range ) for non - normally distributed ones and number of recipients ( percent ) for nominal variables .
differences between both groups were analyzed using t - test , mann - whitney 's u test and chi - squared test as appropriate .
we performed roc curves to test the discriminating value of markers for the first post - transplant week allograft function ( either igf or sgf / dgf ) .
roc curve is a graphical plot which illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied .
it is created by plotting sensitivity ( true positive rate ) against 1 - specificity ( false positive rate ) at various threshold settings .
youden 's index ( the point on roc curve with maximal value of sensitivity and specificity sum ) was used to define the optimal cut - off point for each marker .
we have made a determination of the sample size under the assumption of area under the roc curve of a putative biomarker of 0.8 , with alpha type mistake of 0.05 and beta of 0.1 .
under this assumptions the number of subjects needed to reach statistical significance for this auc was 28 in the positive and 28 in the negative category - 56 total .
classification tree method with binary algorithm was used to test the added predictive value of l - fabp or ngal when diuresis and creatinine excretion rate were also used .
in the next step testing of each constructed classification tree was performed with the " leave - one - out " method .
here , each time a single recipient is excluded from the classification tree construction and then the constructed tree is tested for correct prediction of the excluded recipient .
this way , the percentage of correct predictions can be calculated and compared with different markers used in the classification tree .
for statistical comparison of areas under roc curves medcalc application was used ( v.12.3. , medcalc software , usa ) ; for all other statistical analyses ibm spss statistics software was used ( ibm , usa ) .
results in the study period 74 ddkt recipients were included .
three recipients were excluded from the analysis due to complications in the first days known at time of urine sampling ( 3 renal vein thromboses ) .
mean age of 71 remaining recipients was 50 +/ - 12 years , 56 % were male .
median residual urine output was 400 ml per day ( 0 - 3000 ml ) , 27 recipients were anuric ( 100 ml urine daily or less ) .
there were 31 recipients ( 44 %) with igf , 20 ( 28 %) with sgf and 20 ( 28 %) with dgf .
sgf and dgf patients were combined in the single sgf / dgf group of 40 patients ( 56 %) .
clinical parameters influencing early graft function are shown in the table 1.we tested urine output , ucr excretion rate , ngal and l - fabp as predictive markers of early allograft function in the first post - transplant week .
urine output at 4 sampling time points after transplantation is shown in figure 1 .
the difference between igf and sgf / dgf groups was largest immediately after operation and decreased later on. therefore we used urine output 4 h after transplantation for analysis of diuresis as predictive marker .

l - fabp urinary concentrations with time for both groups of recipients are shown in figure 2 ( 2a for urinary concentrations and 2b for concentrations normalized to ucr ) .
significant difference between both groups for non - normalized l - fabp concentrations was only found at 48 hours after transplantation : urinary l - fabp was 55.1 ( range : 0.6 - 127 ) and 69.5 ( 13.1 - 125.2 ) mg / l in igf and sgf / dgf groups , respectively ( p = 0.018 ) .
area under roc curve ( roc auc ) for l - fabp concentration at 48 - hour was 0.65 ( 95 % c.i. 0.53 - 0.77 ) .
when normalization to ucr was made , the roc auc was significantly larger , both for l - fabp and ngal ( p = 0.005 and 0.001 , respectively ) .
urinary ngal concentrations were 91.8 ( 3.5 - 381.8 ) and 274.9 ( 3.5 - 2390 ) mug / l in igf and sgf / dgf groups respectively , p = 0.042 , and roc auc was 0.69 ( 0.56 - 0.8 ) .

ucr excretion rate at 10 hours post - transplant had the largest area under roc curve .
since recipients with residual urine output could excrete significant amount of creatinine through their native kidneys we divided recipients into two groups according to residual diuresis ( anuric recipients and others ) .
for both groups similar and consistent differences in ucr excretion rate were found between igf and sgf / dgf subgroups ( exact results are shown in additional file 1 ) .
the positive and negative predictive values for ucr excretion rate compared to other markers are shown in the table 3 .

added predictive value of l - fabp or ngal above that of urine output and ucr excretion rate was analyzed using the method of classification trees .
when using solely urine output and ucr excretion rate 89 % of outcomes ( 63 out of 71 ) could be correctly predicted ( the outcomes being igf or sgf / dgf ) .
when l - fabp normalized to ucr at 48 h post - transplant was added to classification tree , 92 % of outcomes were correctly predicted ( 65 out of 71 ) .
when ngal was used , 90 % ( 64 out of 71 ) outcomes were correctly predicted .
( the constructed classification trees are shown in additional file 2 ) .
after the first week there were two patients with early rejections diagnosed .
in a post - hoc analysis with these two patients excluded - a way to obtain a clearer patient sample with pure ischemia - reperfusion injury , the results were essentially unchanged ( exact results not shown ) .
discussion in the present study we measured urinary l - fabp , ngal , diuresis and ucr to find the best predictive marker for early allograft function in deceased donor kidney transplantation .
finding a reliable biomarker for early allograft function has two major implications .
first is the clinical use in cases of poor early allograft function .
when differential diagnostic possibilities of competing pre - renal and post - renal diagnoses are excluded , patients with dgf should be biopsied to discriminate between the presence of acute rejection and acute tubular necrosis .
the exact time point of the kidney biopsy is variable in this scenario .
however , when a reliable biomarker would suggest a good recovery of kidney function but this would not be the case , the clinician could pursue an earlier diagnostic evaluation and treatment intervention .
this was also the reason for dividing patients to the two outcome groups : patients with immediate graft function and others ( sgf and dgf patients ) .
a second important demand for pursue of optimal predictive biomarker in the early post - transplant period comes from the fact that several potential targets in ischemia - reperfusion mechanisms are already identified and new treatments for dgf are or will be tested to alleviate ischemia - reperfusion injury [ 1 ] .
having a good early biomarker of the ischemia - reperfusion injury would aid to identify the patients where an early intervention would be beneficial .
our results show that the predictive value of urinary l - fabp for dgf and sgf is comparable to ngal .
the optimal time to sample urine for l - fabp was 48 h post transplant and the area under roc curve was similar to that of ngal .
good positive and negative predictive value for dgf and sgf were found ( 83 % both ) .
we have only sampled ngal at 24 h post - transplant since this biomarker was extensively evaluated in previous studies [ 7,8 ] and this time point was found to be appropriate .
this is a slight comparative advantage for ngal since according to our data , best predictive value for l - fabp is only obtained 48 h post - transplant so ngal allows earlier prediction of allograft function .
so far , l - fabp has been studied in a living - donor kidney transplant cohort , where no value for prediction of early rejection could be found [ 14 ] .
przybylowski et al studied l - fabp in a cohort of heart and kidney allograft recipients and found that urinary l - fabp correlated with renal allograft function concluding that it could potentially serve as a marker for impaired kidney function [ 11 ] .
our study is to our knowledge the first report on the comparative value of l - fabp as a predictor of early allograft function in ddkt with comparison to a well established urinary marker ngal and ucr .
we consistently found improvement in predictive ability when urinary l - fabp concentrations were normalized to ucr concentration .
ucr excretion fluctuates in the conditions of unstable kidney function and this was shown to importantly influence urine biomarker to ucr ratio ( 12 ) .
specific to the case of early post - transplant period is the finding that lower ucr concentration in sgf / dgf patients will tend to inflate biomarker to ucr ratio and higher ucr in igf patients will lower this ratio .
therefore , as noted in a theoretical model , a poor renal allograft function may amplify a tubular injury biomarker signal ( expressed as biomarker to ucr ratio ) , thereby increasing its clinical utility [ 15 ] .
this was exactly the case with our results since we found significantly larger area under the roc curve when concentrations of l - fabp ( but also ngal ) were normalized to ucr .
interestingly , this improvement in roc auc was not found in previous study of ngal [ 7 ] , although the roc auc for ngal was actually below that found in one of the previous studies where normalization to ucr was done ( 0.82 [ 7 ] vs. 0.9 [ 6 ]). with such an important influence of ucr variation on the predictive ability of urinary biomarkers it is justified to inspect the predictive ability of ucr per se. in fact , we rigorously monitored diuresis and ucr concentration at predefined time periods after transplantation to examine the value of these traditional clinical parameters .
regarding diuresis , there was the largest difference between igf and sgf / dgf groups in the first hours after transplantation and the difference gradually disappeared after 10 h time point ( figure 1 ) .
our results clearly show that for diuresis the best predictive and discriminate values are found early after transplantation .
large urine output 4 h after transplantation had a very high positive predictive value for igf ( no patient developed sgf / dgf when urine output was above 328 ml / h 4 h post - transplant , see table 3 ) .
the main disadvantage of using diuresis was that such a good urine output early on was present in only a minority of patients ( 17 out of 71 patients ) and additional predictive markers are needed for the majority of patients with lower levels of diuresis .
to evaluate the ucr as predictor of allograft function we calculated ucr excretion rate , which is a product of urinary output and ucr concentration and as such may combine the predictive ability of both parameters .
excellent results were found .
ucr excretion rate 10 hours post - transplant had numerically the largest area under roc curve for discrimination between igf and sgf / dgf groups ( although not significantly different from l - fabp and ngal ) .
our results show that at approximate cut - off of 0.5 mmol of ucr / h either 10 or 24 h post - transplant there is a very high positive and negative predictive value for early allograft function ( 89 % positive and 91 % negative predictive value 10 h post - transplant , see table 3 ) .
furthermore , when both traditional parameters were combined in the method of classification trees , little space for further improvement was left since this combination of markers adequately predicted first week outcome in 89 % of cases .
further addition of l - fabp or ngal did not improve the prediction significantly .
according to our results , using diuresis and creatinine excretion rate is a cheap but accurate way to predict igf or sgf / dgf as early as 10 h post - transplant .
the drawback of our study is a relatively low number of included patients .
the number was however larger than in some of previous reports [ 6,16 ] .
on the other hand the strength of the study is a rigorous protocol with predefined times for urine sampling after establishment of allograft reperfusion therefore eliminating the variability in timing of urine sampling .
as this was a single centre study all patients were subjected to the same fluid management protocol and diuretic prescription practice eliminating the potential difference of these practices on postoperative diuresis .
conclusions in conclusion , urinary l - fabp as a single predictive parameter demonstrated equivalent predictive accuracy for first week renal transplantation outcome to urinary ngal .
we found significantly improved predictive ability of both biomarkers when their urinary concentration was normalized to ucr .
the results with l - fabp were best when sampled 48 h after establishment of allograft blood flow .
post - transplant diuresis is a valuable predictor of allograft function , but its ability to discriminate between igf and sgf / dgf patients diminishes 10 h post - transplant .
we have found that the predictive value of creatinine excretion rate ( which combines creatinine urinary concentration and diuresis ) was in fact numerically above all other tested biomarkers and statistically not inferior to other biomarkers , which is an original finding .
we are certain that this results can be of help to clinicians , especially nowadays , when financial constraints may often prevent a wide accession to modern , but more expensive , urinary biomarkers .
further studies of urinary biomarkers should rigorously compare novel biomarkers to ucr excretion rate , due to its potential high predictive value , simplicity of measurement and low cost .

some of the most successful pathogens of human , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb ) , hiv , and leishmania donovani not only establish chronic infections but also remain a grave global threat .
these pathogens have developed innovative strategies to evade immune responses such as antigenic shift and drift , interference with antigen processing / presentation , subversion of phagocytosis , induction of immune regulatory pathways , and manipulation of the costimulatory molecules .
costimulatory molecules expressed on the surface of various cells play a decisive role in the initiation and sustenance of immunity .
exploitation of the " code of conduct " of costimulation pathways provides evolutionary incentive to the pathogens and thereby abates the functioning of the immune system .
here we review how mtb , hiv , leishmania sp. , and other pathogens manipulate costimulatory molecules to establish chronic infection .
impairment by pathogens in the signaling events delivered by costimulatory molecules may be responsible for defective t - cell responses ; consequently organisms grow unhindered in the host cells .
this review summarizes the convergent devices that pathogens employ to tune and tame the immune system using costimulatory molecules .
studying host - pathogen interaction in context with costimulatory signals may unveil the molecular mechanism that will help in understanding the survival / death of the pathogens .
we emphasize that the very same pathways can potentially be exploited to develop immunotherapeutic strategies to eliminate intracellular pathogens .
introduction the immune system is highly evolved to combat and eliminate pathogens .
however , some pathogens can successfully subvert the host immune system to establish their intracellular survival via strategies such as the disguise or sequestration of antigens , molecular mimicry , immunosuppression , circumvention of complements and cytokines cascade , blockade of antigen presentation , escape from apoptosis and autophagy , and modulation of costimulatory signals [ 1 ] .
t cells and antigen - presenting cells ( apcs ) play crucial roles in eliminating intracellular pathogens .
the optimal activation of naive t cells is achieved by occupancy of t - cell receptor ( tcr ) by the peptide - mhc complex displayed on the surface of apcs , delivery of costimulatory signals , and the presence of proinflammatory cytokines [ 2 ] .
the expression of costimulatory molecules on apcs is critical in shaping the extent and nature of the immune response .
thus , an encounter of t cells with peptide - mhc can result in two discrete events : ( a ) t - cell proliferation and differentiation into effector cells ; ( b ) or anergy or apoptosis .
the question of which of these outcomes transpires is determined by the delivery of appropriate costimulatory signals [ 3 ] .
an array of costimulatory molecules is displayed on the surface of apcs ( cd80 / b7 - 1 , cd86 / b7 - 2 , cd83 , cd40 , pdl - 1 , dc - sign , 4 - 1bbl , etc. ) and t cells ( cd28 , ctla - 4 , cd40l , pd - 1 , ox40 , 4 - 1bb , etc ) .
the level of the expression of the costimulatory molecules may play an important role during the course of acute disease and its remission or relapse .
hence , modulation of these molecules by pathogens can help them to establish their existence in the host .
here we elaborate the mechanism by which pathogens such as mtb , hiv , and leishmania sp. , employ molecules viz .
cd28 , cd40 , cd40l , cd80 , cd86 , ctla - 4 , pd1 , pdl - 1 , etc. , to break the code of costimulation to establish chronic infection .
the organisms in consideration are representatives of successful pathogens from the class of bacteria , virus , and parasites .
it appears that these pathogens adopt a common evolutionarily convergent mechanism to evade host immune reaction .
this review provides insights into the mechanism by which pathogens suppress host immunity by modulating the expression of costimulatory molecules .
we also suggest avenues of therapeutic intervention by exploiting costimulatory pathways for treating infections .
the paradigm shift in the biology of costimulation the unilateral " help to t - cell " lymphocentric paradigm of costimulatory pathways has currently evolved into a bilateral signaling model that influences the activity of both t cells and apcs during their interaction ( figure 1 ) [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
costimulatory molecules of cd80 / cd28 , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf )/ tnfr , and tim superfamilies have unmasked the plethora of the possible ligand - receptor interactions that has expanded the understanding of regulation of the immune responses mediated by apcs and t cells .
for example , a positive regulator like cd40l ( on t cells ) when associated with cd40 ( on apcs ) , not only activates t cells but also results in the activation of dendritic cells ( dcs ) ; a process that is popularly called " t - cell licensing " [ 6 ] .
similarly , ligation of cd28 with cd80 and cd86 is known to induce the secretion of interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) and interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) by dcs and activation , proliferation , and differentiation of b cells [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
it is reported that 4 - 1bbl expressed on dcs , binds to 4 - 1bb on t cells , to bolster dcs help to t cells [ 9 ] .
many reports have highlighted the inhibitory roles of ctla - 4 ( cd152 ) and pd - 1 ( expressed on t cells ) with ligands cd80 / cd86 and pdl - 1 / pdl - 2 ( on apcs ) , respectively [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] .
it clearly suggests that costimulation not only amplifies the magnitude of the activation of t cells and apcs , but fine tunes the immune response as well , thereby controlling the hyperactivation .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1002676.g001 figure 1 immune response against intracellular pathogens .
( a ) prrs of apcs sense pathogens that result in the activation of apcs .
( b ) this leads to enhanced antigen presentation , upregulation of costimulatory molecules , and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that promote the activation of t cells .
the activated t cells help in elimination of the pathogens .
( c ) engagement of costimulatory molecules on apcs by t cells also results in " bidirectional signaling " that activates apcs to restrict the growth of pathogens .
modulation of costimulatory molecules by bacteria intracellular pathogens like mtb , mycobacteria avium , m. leprae , salmonella typhi ( s. typhi ) , helicobacter pylori ( h. pylori ) , etc. , infect both macrophages and dcs .
these cells recognize bacterial components known as pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) through their pathogen recognition receptors ( prrs ) .
this triggers innate immunity that initiates antimicrobial defense mechanisms involving autophagy , apoptosis , release of antimicrobial compounds like ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha , etc .
[ 12 ] .
it is followed by activation of adaptive immunity .
the adaptive immune response , personified by specificity and memory , involves the clonal selection of b cells and t cells that confer humoral immunity ( hi ) and cell - mediated immunity ( cmi ) to pathogens , respectively .
pathogen - specific th1 cells release cytokines , especially ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha , which plays an imperative role in activating infected macrophages and restraining the microbial growth [ 13 ] .
further , ligation of cd80 / cd86 with cd28 is essential for preventing apoptosis in t cells [ 7 ] , [ 14 ] .
moreover , cd40 / cd40l interaction results in efficient il - 12 production together with an upregulation of costimulatory molecules , in addition to enhanced antigen presentation by apcs thereby leading to a boosted t - cell response ( figure 1 ) [ 6 ] , [ 15 ] .
hence , interference in the down - modulation of any of these pathways by the pathogens would be detrimental to the host .
mtb is one of the most successful pathogens in the history of mankind .
there are numerous reports indicating the role of mycobacteria in downregulating the expression of cd80 , cd86 , and cd40 on apcs [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
a recent study showed , albeit for bcg , that mhc - ii , cd80 , cd86 , and cd40 are down - tuned during chronic phase of infection [ 16 ] .
in such studies , it is important to delineate the expression of these molecules on infected versus non - infected cells , as by - stander inflammation could interfere in the interpretation of results .
an elegant study demonstrated that the expression of costimulatory molecules and mhc are downregulated in macrophages infected with fluorescent reporter bacteria [ 16 ] , [ 18 ] .
in contrast , others suggested the augmentation of costimulatory molecules upon infection [ 19 ] .
this discrepancy may be primarily dependent on the strain , system , or time - point of the study .
downregulation of cd80 / cd86 or upregulation of ctla - 4 by bacteria on apcs may induce anergy / apoptosis of interacting t cells [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
defect in this signaling pathway is known to paralyze the release of il - 2 , which may compromise the generation of t - cell memory [ 22 ] .
impediment in cd28 signaling interferes in ifn - gamma production and hence promotes the survival of pathogens .
it has been reported that m. leprae obstructs cd28 / b7 signaling pathway for rendering antigen - specific t cell unresponsive in lepromatous leprosy patients [ 21 ] .
recently , the importance of cd80 / cd86 in controlling mycobacterial infection has been demonstrated in cd80 / cd86 double knockout mice [ 23 ] .
the down - modulation of cd80 / cd86 in chronic phase of the infection suggests that mycobacteria may actively exploit this pathway to anergize the t cells ( figure 2 ) .
protective cmi is always associated with the release of chemokines and migration of immune cells to the site of infection .
mtb impair chemokines secretion by interfering with the cd28 - b7 signaling pathway thereby obstructing the surveillance of immune cells and enhancing the propagation of the bacterium [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
it has been shown that the most abundant cell wall lipid trehalose 6 , 6 ' - dimycolate ( tdm ) of mtb and mtsa - 10 inhibit the expression of costimulatory molecules on the surface of the macrophages [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
similarly , cd40 - cd40l interaction is very important in mediating efficient protection against mycobacteria [ 28 ] .
indeed , it has been shown in vitro and in lepromatous patients that cd40 is downregulated by m. leprae [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
there is indirect evidence indicating the involvement of mtb manipulating cd40 / cd40l expression .
in humans , cd40l expression on th1 cells of tuberculosis ( tb ) patients has been correlated with the intensity of ifn - gamma secretion [ 31 ] .
however , cd40 but not cd40l knockout mice are susceptible to mtb infection [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
it is reported that the heat shock protein 70 ( hsp70 ) of mtb acts as an alternate ligand for cd40 .
corroboratively , over - expression of hsp70 interferes with long - time persistence of mtb and allows its clearance [ 34 ] .
interestingly , in chronic mycobacterial infections , cd40 is suppressed on infected cells [ 16 ] .
therefore , it is intriguing to speculate that in the chronic phase of infection , mycobacteria may hamper cd40 expression or manipulate cd40l signaling through binding with hsp70 instead of cd40l in order to evade host defense mechanisms .
10.1371 / journal.ppat.1002676.g002 figure 2 pathogens modulate the expression of costimulatory molecules for their survival .
sensing of pathogens through prrs triggers the activation of apcs .
( a ) costimulatory molecules , which act as the second signal for t - cell activation , are upregulated on infected cells .
persistence of intracellular pathogens modulates the expression of costimulatory molecules , such as downregulation of cd40 / cd80 / cd86 and upregulation of pdl - 1 on infected apcs .
similarly , retarding the exhibition of cd28 / cd40l augments pd - 1 / ctla - 4 on t cells .
( b ) interaction of t cells with the infected apcs impairs the function of t cells by inducing anergy , apoptosis , or exhaustion .
( c ) lack of t - cell help impedes the activity of apcs , eventually enhancing the survival of pathogens .
mycobacteria can upregulate the expression of pd - 1 and its ligands pdl - 1 / pdl - 2 [ 35 ] .
several studies have shown that t cells and natural killer ( nk ) cells from tb patients have increased pd - 1 expression [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
blockade of pd - 1 interaction with pdl - 1 / pdl - 2 enhances immune response .
these observations suggest that mycobacteria may exploit pd - 1 and pdl - 1 / pdl - 2 pathways to dampen the host immune responses .
in contrast , some studies have suggested that these pathways may be involved in controlling exuberant t - cell responses in tb and hence may be beneficial for both the host and the pathogen [ 36 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
mtb retards the development and maturation of monocyte - derived dcs to limit the immune response [ 40 ] .
these immature dcs have a tolerogenic effect in vivo that can result in the generation of regulatory t cells ( tregs ) .
tregs can restrain the proliferation of naive and memory t cells , thereby suppressing pre - existing t - cell immunity [ 41 ] , [ 42 ] .
besides mycobacteria , many other pathogens can exploit cd80 / cd86 - cd28 / ctla - 4 pathways for their persistence ( table 1 ). h. pylori causes chronic infection in the gut resulting in peptic ulcers .
further , it is known to induce the expression of ctla - 4 , resulting in the anergy of t cells and poor clearance of the bacteria [ 43 ] .
yersinia pseudotuberculosis decreases cd86 expression on b cells and impedes the function of both b cells and t cells [ 44 ]. s. typhi is known to suppress icam - 1 and as a consequence reduces the antigen uptake by apcs and inadequate t - cell response [ 45 ] , [ 46 ]. h. pylori diminishes the expression of cd40l on t cells and therefore employs cd40 / cd40l pathway for its survival .
furthermore , it upregulates pdl - 1 expression on gastric epithelial cells and inhibits the activation of t cells recruited to gastric mucosa [ 47 ] .
in addition , it has been reported that pdl - 1 upregulation not only blocks t - cell proliferation and il - 2 secretion , but also promotes the development of tregs [ 48 ] .
bordetella pertussis and b. bronchiseptica decrease the manifestation of cd40 and icam - 1 on dcs , and subsequently , render dcs tolerogenic and promote chiefly tregs but not th1 cells [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
hence , costimulatory molecules could serve as attractive targets for bacteria to modulate in order to prolong their own survival .

modulation of costimulatory molecules by viruses to counter viral infestation , the vertebrate immune system has evolved complex antiviral innate and adaptive immune mechanisms .
some of the spectacular examples to limit viral replication by the host cells are the production of interferons , nk cell - mediated lysis , and apoptosis of the infected cells [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
adaptive antiviral immunity relies greatly on the lysis of infected cells by cytotoxic cd8 + t cells and neutralizing antibodies secreted by b cells .
hiv is a retrovirus that is responsible for 1.9 million deaths annually [ 53 ] .
it predominantly infects cd4 + t cells .
further , it invades dcs , monocytes , and macrophages expressing cd4 and one of its coreceptors ccr5 or cxcr4 [ 54 ] .
additionally , hiv can bind to dc - sign and mannose receptors [ 55 ] .
however , the virus preferentially replicates in the activated hiv - specific cd4 + t cells [ 56 ] .
indeed , excessive loss of cd4 + t cells is the hallmark of hiv infection [ 57 ] .
like many other intracellular pathogens , hiv efficiently exploits the costimulatory molecules to override the immune responses .
its infection is associated with decreased expression of cd40l on cd4 + t cells [ 58 ] .
upon activation , cd4 + t cells from individuals with progressive disease show very little upregulation of cd40l , which corroborates with their inability to help apcs and failure to induce il - 12 in dcs [ 59 ] .
further , cd40 - cd40l interaction has been demonstrated to be important in engendering a robust hiv - specific cd8 + t - cell response .
furthermore , hiv interferes in the cd40 signaling pathway in b cells and hinders t cell help , thereby impairing the secretion of igg and iga antibodies [ 60 ] , [ 61 ] .
aids patients suffer from a defective humoral immunity , which may be due to loss of t - cell function , or b - cell intrinsic defects [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] .
hiv upregulates fas and fasl ( members of tnf superfamily ) on cd8 + t cells and apcs , respectively , which leads to the apoptosis of the interacting cd8 + t cells [ 64 ] , [ 65 ] .
thus , in hiv infections , the hunter becomes the hunted !
during viral infections , continual expression of cd80 / cd86 on dcs is decisive to maintain the effector function of cd8 + t cells [ 66 ] .
intriguingly , hiv downregulates the expression of cd80 / cd86 and their ligand cd28 on infected apcs and t cells , respectively [ 67 ] , [ 68 ] .
the expression of costimulatory molecules such as 4 - 1bbl , cd70 , ox40 , and ox40l is affected during hiv - 1 infection [ 9 ] , [ 69 ] .
measles , herpes , and hepatitis c viruses ( hcv ) retard the expression of cd80 , cd86 , cd25 , cd83 , and cd40 that leads to poor cd8 + t - cell priming [ 70 ] - [ 72 ] .
in addition , herpes virus suppresses icam - 1 on apcs , thereby obstructing immunological synapse with t cells [ 73 ] .
chronic viral infections are associated with loss of function in t cells , a phenomenon popularly known as t - cell exhaustion .
exhausted t cells highly express pd - 1 and have poor effector function [ 74 ] .
pd - 1 expression on hiv - specific t cells is associated with t - cell exhaustion and disease progression [ 75 ] .
pd - 1 is known to make cd8 + t cells more susceptible to fas - mediated lysis [ 76 ] .
signaling through pd - 1 can suppress il - 2 secretion by cd8 + t cells .
il - 2 is known to rescue t cells from anergy and boost the memory response [ 77 ] .
in addition , upregulation of pdl - 1 on apcs during hiv or hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infection supports the survival of pathogens ( table 1 ) [ 78 ] , [ 79 ] .
in essence , viruses can exploit costimulatory molecules in restraining the function of both t cells and apcs .
modulation of the expression of costimulatory molecules by intracellular protozoan parasites t cells play a significant role in controlling the protozoa - inflicted diseases like malaria , visceral leishmaniasis , and trypanosomiasis .
humoral responses play a less important role .
however , complement - mediated killing or opsonization is responsible for control of pathogen during the intermittent extracellular phase of its replication cycle within the vertebrate host [ 80 ] .
parasites like leishmania donovoni , l. chagasi , toxoplasma gonodii ( t. gonodii ) , t. cruzi , and plasmodium falciparum can manipulate the costimulatory molecules for evading immune system. l. donovani and l. chagasi infect macrophages and are reported to downregulate both cd80 and icam - 1 [ 21 ] , [ 81 ] .
such apcs fail to optimally activate t cells. t. gondii and t. cruzi , selectively dampen the exhibition of cd80 and cd28 , respectively to impair the function of t cells [ 82 ] .
cd40 - cd40l signaling is crucial for th1 immunity against l. major , because cd40l / cd40 knockout mice sparsely secrete il - 12 , favoring th2 - biased response [ 83 ] , [ 84 ] .
interestingly , l. major can differentially modulate the expression of cd40 and thus anergizes t cells and promotes tregs population [ 83 ] .
plasmodium interferes in the signaling mechanism of cd40 in dcs [ 85 ] .
cd40 deficient mice succumb to plasmodium infection .
this signifies that this pathway is detrimental in providing sterilizing immunity to parasites , as it activates apcs and protective th1 responses .
in conclusion , parasites can efficiently empower the immune system by dampening the expression of costimulatory molecules .
mechanism involved in immunomodulation of costimulatory molecules induction of the expression of costimulatory molecules on exposure to various inflammatory cytokines ( il - 6 , il - 12 , tnf - alpha , ifn - gamma ) or pamps / damps is regulated by transcription factors such as nf - kappab , irf - 3 , ap - 1 , nfat [ 86 ] , [ 87 ] .
activation of these transcription factors is tightly regulated by various kinases or phosphatases that include mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) , tnf receptor - associated factor proteins ( traf ) , il - 1 receptor - associated kinase 4 ( irak4 ) , phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) , and janus - kinase .
for example , triggering of tlr - 4 with lipopolysaccharides ( lps ) elicits pathways dependent on myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 ( myd88 ) and tir - domain - containing adapter - inducing interferon - beta ( trif ) .
both the molecules induce downstream signaling to activate mapks , nf - kappab , and irf family proteins , which are responsible for the enhanced expression of cd40 and cd86 [ 86 ] , [ 88 ] .
further , t - cell interaction with apc involving tcr and costimulatory molecules activates a plethora of downstream signaling molecules , leading to the induction of the expression of cd40l , pd - 1 , and cd28 [ 89 ] , [ 90 ] .
intracellular pathogens utilize an array of mechanisms to manipulate costimulatory molecules .
upon infection , pathogens trigger il - 10 secretion by inhibiting p38map kinases and promoting erk phosphorylation [ 91 ] .
il - 10 blocks the degradation of ikappab - alpha that inhibits the nf - kappab activation eventually inhibiting the expression of costimulatory molecules [ 92 ] .
interference in tlrs signaling by the intracellular pathogens is considered to be a foremost event in the suppression of costimulatory molecules .
mannosylated lipoarabinomannan ( manlam ) of mtb binds to dc - sign and compromises the lps - induced activation of dcs by interfering in the tlrs' signalling [ 93 ] .
binding of mtb early secreted antigenic target protein 6 ( esat - 6 ) to tlr - 2 activates akt and prevents interaction between the myd88 and irak4 , consequently abrogating nf - kappab activation that suppresses cd80 expression [ 94 ] .
similarly , hiv upregulates pdl - 1 on dcs and monocytes by attenuating the signaling of tlr - 7 and tlr - 8 [ 95 ] .
in addition , hiv - mediated pi3k activation upregulates pdl - 1 on apcs and thus suppresses the activation of hiv - specific cd8 + t cells [ 96 ] .
rapid endocytosis of costimulatory molecules upon infection is suggested as one of the mechanisms to interrupt the function of apcs .
for instance , nef protein of hiv modulates the actin - dependent trafficking mechanism to remove cd80 / cd86 from the monocytes surface , making them inefficient to activate t cells [ 97 ] .
tcr signaling is central for the optimum expression of costimulatory molecules and effector function of t cells .
therefore , it may serve as an important target for pathogens to paralyze t - cell activity [ 98 ] .
mtb glycolipids interfere with tcr signaling and block the activation of cd4 + t cells [ 99 ] .
hiv gp120 interacts with cd4 ( a coreceptor for tcr ) that inhibits intracellular signal transduction through tcr , leading to decreased hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositide ( pi ) , ca2 + influx , activation of protein kinase c ( pkc ) , and eventually failure of nfat translocation .
these events culminate in the inhibition of cd40l expression .
decline of cd40l on t cells abrogates the bidirectional signaling and reduces the exhibition of cd80 on apcs [ 100 ] .
in contrast , nef activates nfat and stimulates il - 2 release to overcome the exogenous requirement of il - 2 to promote t - cell proliferation , consequently disseminating the infection [ 101 ] .
however , nef retards cd28 and cd4 expression , thereby making t cells incapable of promoting cmi [ 98 ] .
corroborative with these observations , nef - mutated hiv is unable to cause persistent infection .
similarly , core protein of hcv inhibits tcr signaling and upregulates pd - 1 [ 102 ] .
the above - mentioned mechanisms imply that pathogens can effectively utilize various costimulatory pathways to subvert immune response to persist in the host .
therapeutic implications the noncompliance with the relatively high dose and extended therapeutic regime reduces the effectiveness of current drugs , leading to global emergence of mdr / xdr / tdr pathogenic strains .
interestingly , costimulatory molecules have been suggested for therapeutic intervention to treat lymphoma patients [ 4 ] , [ 103 ] .
to develop alternative or adjunct ( with drugs ) therapies , an intensive effort has been undertaken in last decade to understand how intracellular pathogens exploit costimulatory molecules , which are the tour de force of the immune system [ 27 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 68 ] , [ 78 ] .
the potent role of costimulatory molecules is aptly established in the optimum activation of t cells and apcs ; the cells that play a cardinal role in curbing the infections .
hence , immunotherapy involving costimulatory molecules can be a breakthrough strategy to treat various diseases , minimizing side effects inflicted by drug therapies and in restricting the emergence of drug resistance .

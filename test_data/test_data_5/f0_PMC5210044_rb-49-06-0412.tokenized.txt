dear editor , a 12 - year - old male patient presented with a delay in neuropsychomotor development that had been diagnosed in the first year of life .
two years prior ( at 10 years of age ) , he had undergone ventricular shunt placement because of hydrocephalus .
six months prior to the visit reported here , he had experienced episodes of seizures .
physical examination revealed multiple cutaneous nevi ( figure 1a ) .
cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an elevated level of protein ( 1359.7 mg / dl ; reference range : 15.0 - 45.0 mg / dl ) and revealed the presence of epithelioid cells .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain ( figures 1b , 1c , and 1d ) showed extensive , bilateral , asymmetric leptomeningeal thickening , mainly in the cortical sulci of the right cerebral hemisphere , with spontaneous t1 hyperintense signal ( presumably melanin ) and diffuse enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium contrast .
the mri scan also showed involvement of the brain parenchyma , characterized by spontaneous t1 hyperintense signal in the amygdaloid nuclei and in the cortex , probably due to melanin / melanocyte deposits .
although meningeal biopsy was not performed , a presumptive diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis ( ncm ) was considered .
figure 1 a : multiple cutaneous nevi seen on physical examination .
b,c : gadolinium - enhanced axial t1 - weighted mri sequence with fat suppression showing hyperintense signals along the cortical sulci of the cerebral hemispheres , presumably due to diffuse leptomeningeal lesion with melanin content , together with areas of high signal intensity in the amygdaloid nuclei ( arrows ) and in the cerebral cortex , which likely correspond to parenchymal involvement by melanin / melanocyte deposits in the context of ncm .
d : gadolinium - enhanced axial t1 - weighted mri sequence with fat suppression showing diffuse enhancement of the leptomeninges along the cortical sulci of both cerebral hemispheres , especially on the right side .
ncm is a rare sporadic neuroectodermal syndrome , first described by rokitansky in 1861 , and characterized by congenital cutaneous nevi ( one large nevus or multiple nevi ) associated with benign or malignant central nervous system ( cns ) proliferation of melanocytes ( 1 - 4 ) .
the diagnostic criteria , which were first described by fox and later revised by kadonaga and frieden ( 1 ) in 1991 , include the combination of all of the following : - a single giant congenital nevus ( measuring at its greatest diameter >= 20 cm in adults , or >= 9 cm on the head or >= 6 cm on the trunk in neonates and infants ) or multiple ( three or more ) congenital nevi , accompanied by meningeal melanosis or cns melanoma ; - the absence of cutaneous melanoma , except in patients with a meningeal lesion histologically proven to be benign ; - the absence of meningeal melanoma , except in patients with cutaneous lesions histologically proven to be benign .
approximately 60 % to 70 % of all individuals with ncm develop symptoms , which usually appear before five years of age ( 2 ) .
clinically , patients can experience seizures , hydrocephalus , developmental delays , psychiatric disorders , cranial nerve palsies , intracranial hemorrhage , and myelopathy ( 1,2,5 - 7 ) .
seizures are the most common initial neurological manifestation ( 2 ) .
involvement of the cns can include parenchymal or leptomeningeal lesions , such as melanosis ( aggregation of benign melanocytic cells ) or melanomas ( 5 ) .
in ncm , the mri findings can include hyperintense areas in the temporal lobes on t1 - weighted images , diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement of the brain and spine , and mass of malignant melanoma ( 4 ) .
parenchymal melanosis typically occurs in the temporal lobes ( amygdaloid nuclei ) , cerebellum , or pons ; and its lesions usually exhibit a high signal intensity on t1 - weighted images and do not commonly show enhancement after contrast administration ( 5,7,8 ) .
the leptomeningeal lesions usually present intermediate to high signal intensity on t1 - weighted images , low to intermediate signal intensity on t2 - weighted images , high signal intensity on fluid - attenuated inversion recovery ( flair ) sequence and diffuse enhancement after gadolinum administration .
mass effect , edema , hemorrhage , and necrosis favor the possibility of melanoma and make benign melanocytic lesion less likely ( 5 ) .
abnormalities in the spine , especially cystic malformations ( mainly arachnoid cysts ) , are relatively common in patients with ncm ( 2 ) .
the differential diagnoses that can be based on mri images of the brain include subarachnoid hemorrhage , meningitis , leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , other melanin - containing lesions , and non - melanocytic hemorrhagic tumors .
the clinical context and the imaging characteristics will aid in making that differentiation ( 4,9 ) .
regardless of the treatment instituted , the prognosis is usually poor , especially in cases with diffuse leptomeningeal involvement ( 2,5,6 ) .

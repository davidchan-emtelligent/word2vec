exosomes , which are packed with rna and proteins and are released in all biological fluids , are emerging as an important mediator of intercellular communication .
however , the function of exosomes remains poorly understood in cancer metastasis .
here , we demonstrate that exosomes isolated by size - exclusion chromatography from a highly metastatic human oral cancer cell line , hoc313 - lm , induced cell growth through the activation of erk and akt as well as promoted cell motility of the poorly metastatic cancer cell line hoc313 - p. microrna ( mirna ) array analysis identified two oncogenic mirnas , mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 , that were highly expressed in exosomes .
these mirnas were transferred to poorly metastatic cells by exosomes , which resulted in increased cell motility and invasive ability .
moreover , mir - 1246 increased cell motility by directly targeting denn / madd domain containing 2d ( dennd2d ) .
taken together , our findings support the metastatic role of exosomes and exosomal mirnas , which highlights their potential for applications in mirna - based therapeutics .
oral cancer is a subtype of head and neck cancer ( hnc ) that arises on the lip , tongue or floor of the mouth1 .
oral cancer is the sixth most common cancer diagnosed worldwide and was the cause of more than 145,000 deaths in 2012 , of which 77 % occurred in less developed regions2 .
ninety percent of oral cancers are squamous cell carcinomas , which display high rates of lymph node metastasis3 .
tobacco and alcohol are major risk factors for oral cancer in developing countries , and recent studies have implicated human papilloma virus ( hpv ) infection as another risk factor in developed countries1 .
although early stage hncs are associated with high cure rates through surgery and radiotherapy , up to 50 % of oral cancer patients present with advanced disease , secondary tumors and metastasis3 .
importantly , metastasis accounts for most deaths in oral cancer patients and poses a major challenge in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) 3 .
activating invasion and metastasis , which is one of the six hallmarks of cancer , is a complex multistep process in human tumor pathogenesis45 .
the molecular pathogenesis behind the development of such metastatic advances is an area of intense research , and recent study on the role of extracellular vesicles called exosomes has shown promise in explaining metastasis6 .
exosomes are 30 - 100 - nm - diameter vesicles of endosomal origin that are secreted in all biological fluids , including blood , urine , saliva , cerebrospinal fluid and in vitro cell culture medium678 .
these vesicles form part of an intercellular communication system , which makes them potentially useful for therapy as well as biomarkers of diseases , such as cancer69 .
recent reports have suggested that the rna signature of urinary exosomes can serve as a clinical diagnostic biomarker of prostate cancer risk in patients10 .
in another study , the authors found that exosomes from tumors drive the formation of the pre - metastatic niche and determine organotropic metastasis through the integrins of exosomes11 .
exosomes play such biological and pathological roles in intercellular communication through their cargo molecules , which includes protein and genetic material , such as microrna ( mirna ) 1213 .
micrornas are small non - coding rnas that mediate destabilization and / or translational repression of target messenger rna ( mrna ) molecules and thus reduce the final protein output .
an increasing amount of direct evidence has linked mirnas to cancer development and progression1415 .
micrornas upregulated in some cancers that promote oncogenesis by targeting tumor suppressor genes are known as " oncogenic mirnas ( oncomirs )" , whereas downregulated mirnas are known as " tumor suppressor mirnas ( ts - mirnas )" 16 .
micrornas can also be packaged into the multivesicular bodies and released as exosomes into the extracellular environment17 .
despite many studies on exosomes function , the exact molecular basis behind the biological and pathological function of exosomes is poorly understood .
we previously established the highly metastatic oral cancer subline hoc313 - lm from the hoc313 parent cell line ( hoc313 - p ) and we used these cell lines to study the function of exosomes in cancer progression18 .
our results revealed that exosomes containing mirna cargo derived from the highly metastatic hoc313 - lm cells are one of the factors that promote cell growth , migration and invasion of hoc313 - p cells , which can increase the malignant potential of the parental cell line .
results lm - exosomes can be isolated by size - exclusion chromatography we previously established a highly metastatic human oscc subline ( hoc313 - lm ) from hoc313 parental cells ( hoc313 - p ) 18 .
to investigate the significance of exosome in the metastatic capacity of hoc313 - lm cells , we isolated and characterized exosomes from the culture media of hoc313 - lm cells using size - exclusion chromatography and western blotting analysis .
size - exclusion chromatography can be used for exosomes isolation to acquire exosomes devoid of small plasma protein contaminants ( fig. 1a ) 19 .
to evaluate the efficiency of exosomes purification using this method , we characterized the exosomes by western blotting and transmission electron microscope ( tem ) analysis .
the most widely accepted tetraspanin markers of exosomes , cd9 , cd63 and cd81 , could be detected in consecutive fractions three through seven ( fig. 1b ) .
we combined the isolated fractions into three groups containing fractions 1 - 2 , fractions 3 - 7 and fractions 8 - 10 , and we found that fractions 3 - 7 showed the strongest expression of exosome markers , which suggests exosomes enrichment in fractions 3 - 7 .
tem analysis also demonstrated the presence of exosomes in fractions 3 - 7 ( fig. 1c ) .
therefore , we defined fractions 3 - 7 as hoc313 - lm - exosomes ( lm - exosomes ) .
to visualize the uptake of lm - exosomes by hoc313 - p cells , we labeled lm - exosomes with pkh26 , a red fluorescent dye , and added the lm - exosomes to hoc313 - p cells in culture .
pkh26 dye contains long aliphatic tails that are incorporated into the lipid membrane of exosomes20 .
after 14 hours of treatment with labeled lm - exosomes , we found that hoc313 - p cells acquired positive pkh26 signal compared with control cells ( fig. 1d , e ) .
these observations suggest that lm - exosomes isolated by size - exclusion chromatography could be effectively taken up by hoc313 - p cells .
lm - exosomes induce cell growth and increase the migration and invasion ability of hoc313 - p cells to determine the biological significance of secreted lm - exosomes , we performed a functional assay of lm - exosomes in hoc313 - p cells .
in vitro cell growth was assessed in hoc313 - p cells treated with lm - exosomes for seven consecutive days .
a cell growth assay showed that hoc313 - p cells treated with lm - exosomes proliferated rapidly compared to the control group ( fig. 2a ) .
in contrast , the cell growth rate of hoc313 - lm cells did not change upon treatment with lm - exosomes ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
to define the mechanism by which lm - exosomes promote cell growth in hoc313 - p cells , we examined the phosphorylation status of cell survival signaling proteins egfr , erk and akt .
notably , the phosphorylation status of these proteins was elevated in hoc313 - p cells upon treatment with lm - exosomes ( fig. 2b ) .
in addition , we observed that the phosphorylation levels of erk and akt in hoc313 - lm cells were higher than those of hoc313 - p cells ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
we next assessed the migration and invasion ability of hoc313 - p cells in the presence of lm - exosomes .
the number of cells that migrated and invaded increased upon lm - exosome treatment compared with the control group ( fig. 2c,d ) .
moreover , we found that the migration and invasion rates of hoc313 - lm cells were not changed upon treatment with lm - exosomes , which is consistent with the increased cell growth rate of these cells ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
collectively , these data suggest that lm - exosomes can promote the cell growth , migration and invasion ability of hoc313 - p cells .
lm - exosomes contain oncomirs mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 that are transferred to hoc313 - p cells for intercellular communication rna and proteins contained in exosomes contribute to exosome function21 .
to investigate the oncogenic functions of lm - exosomes through their mirna content , we first extracted rna from hoc313 - p and - lm cells and their respective exosomes .
bioanalyzer results showed that exosomes were highly enriched in small rna species compared with cellular rna ( supplementary fig. s1 ) .
we then performed mirna array analysis using whole rna from hoc313 - p and - lm cells and their respective exosomal rna ( fig. 3a ) .
when we analyzed the mirna array data for mirnas that are upregulated in hoc313 - lm cells , we found that 18 mirnas were highly expressed in hoc313 - lm cells compared with hoc313 - p cells .
interestingly , more mirnas ( 60 ) were expressed at higher levels in lm - exosomes when compared with hoc313 - p - derived exosomes .
the most salient finding was a set of 11 mirnas that are commonly upregulated in hoc313 - lm cells at the cellular and exosomal level ( table 1 ) .
based on these results , we focused on seven mirnas , mir - 17 , mir - 30a - 3p , mir - 30a - 5p , mir - 92a , mir - 181a , mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 , all of which have been reported as oncogenic mirnas ( oncomirs ) 22232425262728 .
using quantitative rt - pcr ( qrt - pcr ) , we could validate the differential expression of six of these mirnas ( all except mir - 92a ) in cells and exosomes ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
to evaluate whether these six mirnas could affect cell growth , we performed a cell growth assay and found that mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 did not inhibit cell growth ( fig. 3e , supplementary fig. s3 ) .
therefore , we focused on the functions of mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 .
these data suggest that a specific mirna population could be selectively sorted into the exosomes , of which mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 could act as oncomirs in oral squamous cell carcinoma .
exosomes mediate transfer of mirnas to adjacent or distant cells for intercellular communication to determine whether exosomes mediate intercellular transfer of mirnas , we incubated hoc313 - p cells with lm - exosomes .
after 72 hours of treatment with lm - exosomes , qrt - pcr analysis revealed that the levels of mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 in hoc313 - p cells were elevated compared with control cells ( fig. 3b ) .
in addition , to examine whether mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 transfer requires direct cell contact , we set up a transwell assay in which hoc313 - p cells or hoc313 - lm cells were separated from hoc313 - p cells by a porous 1 - mum upper membrane in a ratio of 4:1 .
under this condition , only acellular material , such as exosomes or other soluble factors , can migrate across these membranes13 .
seventy - two hours later , the hoc313 - p cells in the bottom chamber were analyzed .
consistent with the mirna transfer observed in lm - exosome - treated cells , the expression levels of mir - 342 and mir - 1246 increased when hoc313 - lm cells were in the upper chamber relative to when hoc313 - p cells were in the upper chamber ( fig. 3c ) .
therefore , lm - exosomes may selectively mediate transfer of their contents into the recipient cells at adjacent or distant sites and could induce an oncogenic outcome in the recipient cells .
exosomal mirnas mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 increase cell motility but not cell growth in hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells following the observation that lm - exosomes function in an oncogenic manner in hoc313 - p cells , we hypothesized that the mirna cargo of lm - exosomes was responsible for such biological functions .
to test the functions of mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 , we transiently transfected mir - 342 - 3p and / or mir - 1246 into hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells .
we confirmed the level of mirna expression by qrt - pcr analysis and found that these mirnas were overexpressed compared with control - transfected hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells ( fig. 3d , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
cell growth was not significantly affected by transient transfection with either mirna in hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells ( fig. 3e , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
these results suggest that the growth - promoting ability of lm - exosomes might not be dependent on these mirnas but rather on other cargo molecules of lm - exosomes .
we also examined the migration and invasion ability of hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells by overexpressing mir - 342 - 3p and / or mir - 1246 .
overexpression of mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 enhanced the migration and invasion ability in hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells ( fig. 3f , g , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
taken together , these data suggest that mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 delivered via lm - exosomes act as oncomirs by affecting the cell motility of the recipient cells .
exosomal mir - 1246 directly and functionally targets the dennd2d gene to gain insight into the mechanism through which exosomal mirnas promote the migration and invasion of hoc313 - p cells , we analyzed the genes that are downregulated by these mirnas .
to this end , we performed gene expression array analysis on hoc313 - lm cells and on mir - nc - , mir - 342 - 3p - or mir - 1246 - transfected hoc313 - p cells .
the array data showed that the gene expression pattern upon mir - 1246 transfection was similar to the hoc313 - lm cell gene expression pattern ( fig. 4a ) .
to identify target genes of mir - 1246 , we focused on 13 genes that were downregulated upon mir - 1246 transfection according to the array data ( table 2 ) .
we selected three candidate genes based on previously described roles as tumor suppressors and their identification through the targetscan program ( www.targetscan.org ) as predicted target genes of mir - 1246293031 .
among the candidate genes , we found that denn / madd domain containing 2d ( dennd2d ) was downregulated 6.2 - fold in mir - 1246 - transfected cells compared with control - transfected cells .
protein expression of dennd2d was reduced upon treatment with lm - exosomes and / or transfection of mir - 1246 in hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells ( fig. 4b , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
in addition , we performed a cell growth assay in mir - 1246 - overexpressing cells and observed that cell growth was not affected by mir - 1246 expression ( fig. 3e , 4b , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
to evaluate the functional consequences of dennd2d , we suppressed dennd2d expression in hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells using dennd2d - specific sirna and assessed the cell growth of these cells ( fig. 4c , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
cell growth was not affected by the suppression of dennd2d , which is consistent with our results analyzing cell growth upon mir - 1246 or dennd2d - specific sirna transfection ( fig. 4b,4c ) .
to determine whether dennd2d is a direct target of mir - 1246 binding to the mir - 1246 seed sequence in the 3'utr , we performed a luciferase assay in hoc313 - p cells using a reporter plasmid vector containing either a wild - type ( wt ) or mutant ( mut ) seed sequence within the 3'utr ( fig. 4d ) .
our results showed a 35 % reduction in luciferase activity for the wt vector compared with empty vector , whereas the luciferase activity was completely restored upon expression of the mutant vector , which contains an insertion mutation within the seed sequence ( fig. 4d ) .
these results suggest that mir - 1246 can downregulate the expression of dennd2d by direct binding to the 3'utr .
furthermore , knockdown of dennd2d resulted in an increase in hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells motility ( fig. 4e , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
in addition , when dennd2d was knocked down , cells showed increased invasion ability compared with the control group ( fig. 4f , supplementary fig. s4 , s5 ) .
collectively , these results suggest that dennd2d is regulated by mir - 1246 , and upon suppression , dennd2d promotes the migration and invasion of hoc313 - p , tsu as well as hela cells .
discussion since the initial studies showing that exosomes can mediate the intercellular transfer of rna and proteins , many studies have focused on the contents of exosomes involved in intercellular communication17 .
in the present study , we identified functional oncogenic mirnas that can be delivered from the highly metastatic oral cancer cell line hoc313 - lm to the poorly metastatic cell line hoc313 - p through exosomes .
notably , exosomal mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 induced a pro - metastatic phenotype , including increased cell motility and invasion , and mir - 1246 directly targets dennd2d expression by binding to its 3'utr .
the suppression of dennd2d promoted the migration and invasion ability of hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells , which is consistent with the role of lm - exosomes in promoting hoc313 - p cell migration and invasion .
however , an intriguing remaining question is which of the exosomal constituents is / are responsible for the increased cell growth induced by lm - exosomes .
despite progress in exosome research , no standard methods exist for providing exact quantitative and qualitative analysis of exosomes632 .
some methods have been developed for the isolation of exosomes , including ultracentrifugation , commercial - based kits and size - exclusion chromatography .
in the present study , we chose size - exclusion chromatography to isolate exosomes19 because we could purify the most rna from exosomes isolated using this method compared with other methods ( supplementary fig. s6 ) .
in addition , comparative studies showed that isolation of exosomes by size - exclusion chromatography retains the biophysical properties of exosomes , resulting in higher yield33 .
we found that exosomes isolated from hoc313 - lm cells could induce malignant features in hoc313 - p cells by increasing their cell growth and cell motility .
cell migration and invasion are key features of metastasis45 .
many studies have assessed the importance of exosomes in tumor metastasis ; for example , one study showed that exosomes isolated from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic potential of primary tumors by inducing bone marrow progenitor cells to acquire a pro - metastatic phenotype34 .
a more recent study reported that exosomal mir - 181c promoted the destruction of the blood - brain barrier by altering actin dynamics through the downregulation of 3 - phosphoinositide - dependent protein kinase - 1 ( pdpk1 ) and induced brain metastases in cancer patients35 .
thus , the exosomes play a role in the establishment of the metastatic niche by communication between cancer cells and normal cells34 .
moreover , our data indicate that exosomes secreted by highly metastatic cells contribute to the cancer progression of poorly metastatic cells , which is consistent with the idea that cancer cells interact with each other through exosomes .
the recent discovery of extracellular mirnas has made apparent their role in intercellular communication and metastatic potential of cancer cells36 .
in the present study , the mirna microarray analysis of exosomal and cellular rna showed that the secretion of mirnas in exosomes is selective and does not necessarily correlate with their abundance in the cell of origin .
thus , these results suggest the existence of a selective mechanism to enrich exosomes with mirnas that are not abundant in their cell of origin .
moreover , the oncomirs mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 were significantly enriched in exosomes compared with other intracellular compartments and were responsible for the promotion of the metastatic potential of hoc313 - p cells .
micrornas taken up by hoc313 - p cells showed almost no difference when comparing direct treatment of lm - exosomes and indirect transwell co - culture ( fig. 3b and c ) .
this observation underscores the potency of the exosomal delivery mechanism and suggests that uptake occurs at both local sites and distant sites to increase metastatic potential .
although migration and invasion abilities of hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells were increased upon overexpression of mir - 342 - 3p and / or mir - 1246 , we did not observe any significant effect on cell growth rates .
thus , we propose that the cell proliferation - inducing activity of exosomes is likely governed by mechanisms other than mirnas , such as cytokines or other exosomal components , that have yet to be discovered37 .
microrna 342 - 3p plays dual roles in tumor suppression and tumor promotion2538 .
a heatmap of the gene expression profiles of mir - 342 - 3p - , mir - 1246 - , and mir - nc - transfected hoc313 - p cells and the highly metastatic hoc313 - lm cell line revealed that transfection with mir - 342 - 3p is insufficient to induce a hoc313 - lm - like gene expression profile , in contrast to that of mir - 1246 ( fig. 4a ) .
therefore , we excluded mir - 342 - 3p from further investigation and continued exploring the functional mechanism of mir - 1246 .
recently , extracellular mir - 1246 has been reported to promote lung cancer proliferation and enhance radioresistance2728 .
importantly , in our study , we found that dennd2d is a direct target of mir - 1246 and demonstrated a gene expression pattern that resembled that of hoc313 - lm cells ( fig. 4a ) .
dennd2d is a tumor suppressor gene but is only known to be downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in gastric and hepatic cancers3139 .
our results show for the first time that dennd2d is also regulated by mirnas and can be directly targeted and downregulated by mir - 1246 .
we found that inhibition of dennd2d could induce cell migration and invasion in hoc313 - p , tsu and hela cells but not cell growth .
these findings are consistent with a recent report in which mir - 522 expression induce cell motility by targeting dennd2d in lung cancer40 .
hence , downregulation of dennd2d by mir - 1246 results in the acquisition of migratory and invasive abilities of poorly metastatic cancer cells in various types of cancer .
overall , our study demonstrates an important role for cancer cell - derived exosomes and exosomal mirnas in cancer progression .
interestingly , we show evidence that the abundance of oncogenic mir - 342 - 3p and mir - 1246 in cancer exosomes is significantly associated with malignancy .
one of the molecular mechanisms resulting in cancer progression involves the direct targeting of dennd2d by mir - 1246 .
in addition to important cellular functions , secreted exosomal mirnas could serve as therapeutic targets for novel cancer treatments as well as diagnostic biomarkers .
materials and methods cell culture the human oral cancer cell line hoc313 was generously donated by dr. t. amagasa ( tokyo medical and dental university , japan ) .

background metabolic abnormalities are more associated with central obesity than peripheral obesity , but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown .
the present study was to identify serum metabolic biomarkers which distinguish metabolically unhealthy centrally obese ( muco ) from metabolically healthy peripherally obese ( mhpo ) individuals .
methods a two - stage case - control study design was employed .
in the discovery stage , 20 individuals ( 10 mhpo and 10 muco ) were included and in the following validation stage , 79 individuals ( 20 normal weight ( nw ) , 30 mhpo , 29 muco ) were utilized .
study groups were matched for age , sex , physical activity and total dietary calorie intake with mhpo and muco additionally matched for bmi .
metabolic abnormality was defined as : 1 ) homa - ir > 4.27 ( 90th percentile ) , 2 ) high - density lipoprotein cholesterol < 1.03 mmol / l in men and < 1.30 mmol / l in women , 3 ) fasting blood glucose >= 5.6 mmol / l , and 4 ) waist circumference > 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women .
muco individuals had all of these abnormalities whereas mhpo and nw individuals had none of them .
a targeted metabolomics approach was performed on fasting serum samples , which can simultaneously identify and quantify 186 metabolites .
results in the discovery stage , serum leucine , isoleucine , tyrosine , valine , phenylalanine , alpha - aminoadipic acid , methioninesulfoxide and propionylcarnitine were found to be significantly higher in muco , compared with mhpo group after multiple testing adjustment .
significant changes of five metabolites ( leucine , isoleucine , valine , alpha - aminoadipic acid , propionylcarnitine ) were confirmed in the validation stage .
conclusions significantly higher levels of serum leucine , isoleucine , valine , alpha - aminoadipic acid , propionylcarnitine are characteristic of metabolically unhealthy centrally obese patients .
the finding provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic abnormalities in obesity .

obesity represents a major public health concern and is associated with increased risk of developing co - morbidities including metabolic syndrome ( ms ) , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2dm ) , cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) and at least a dozen types of cancer [ 2 - 5 ] .
numerous genetic , metabolic and environmental factors alone or more likely in combination lead to the excessive accumulation of body fat , which defines obesity .
however , the clinical manifestations of obesity are not homogeneous and accumulating evidence suggests that not all obese individuals necessarily develop metabolic disorders .
a sub group of obese people , reported as 6 - 40 % , are absent of metabolic abnormalities like dyslipidemia , insulin resistance ( ir ) , hypertension and inflammatory profile [ 6 - 12 ] , suggesting that a " metabolically healthy obese " phenotype exists .
although , the mechanisms responsible for the existence of metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese phenotypes are not yet clear , body fat distribution is currently the primary candidate due to its crucial role in metabolic health [ 10 , 12 ] .
visceral fat accumulation or central obesity ( apple - shaped individuals ) appears to be a more critical factor that linking obesity with the increased risk of developing ms and diabetes than the amount of total body fat or peripheral fat [ 6 , 10 - 12 ] .
at present , very little is known about the metabolic characteristics of metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity .
using a more comprehensive screening tool is essential to explore and understand the metabolic profiles of different obesity phenotypes .
metabolomics is defined as an " omics " technology characteristic of the high - throughput identification and quantification of small molecule (< 1500 da ) metabolites in cell , tissue , blood or organism [ 13 ] .
previously , metabolomics has been identified as a promising and effective technique to help elucidate the etiology of diseases , such as obesity [ 14 ] , diabetes [ 15 , 16 ] and cvds [ 17 ] , and assess the effects of natural health products on certain pathological issues [ 18 ] .
the currently evolving metabolomic techniques brings a wealth of opportunities to seek out , and hopefully develop new biomarkers that may become important tools for identifying diseases , predicting their progression , and determining the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions [ 19 ] .
to date , only three investigations have implemented metabolomics technology to differentiate the metabolically unhealthy and healthy obese individuals .
a study on overweight / obese women with and without ms in finland found that serum branched - chain amino acids ( bcaas ) , aromatic amino acids and orosomucoid were associated with all risk factors of ms , with the definition of ms by the presence of any three of the five criteria [ 20 ] .
another study in germany reported that changes of arachidonic acid , glutamine , histidine , spermidine and pc aa c32:3 in cultured human adipocytes distinguish metabolically healthy and unhealthy obese individuals [ 21 ] .
this study mainly focused on adipocytes and the criteria used to distinguish metabolically healthy from unhealthy obesity was ir alone .
a recent study in china found the levels of serum l - kynurenine , glycerophosphocholine , glycerol 1 - phosphate , glycolic acid , tagatose , methyl palmitate , and uric acid were significantly different between metabolic healthy ( mho ) and abnormal obesity ( mao ) [ 22 ] .
the mao was defined as having one or more abnormal metabolic indexes , including hyperglycemia , hypertension and dyslipidemia , while mho had none of them .
however , none of these studies systematically defined metabolically healthy or unhealthy obesity nor did they consider the critical importance of body fat distribution .
in the present study , we aimed to find important metabolites that distinguish metabolically healthy peripheral obese ( mhpo ) from metabolically unhealthy central obese ( muco ) individuals with a more stringent definition along with a significant emphasis placed upon body fat distribution .
a targeted metabolomics methodology was applied , which has broadly been used in the study of metabolic diseases [ 23 , 24 ] .
the potential metabolites discovered from this current investigation will more accurately represent the metabolic route discrepancy between " metabolically healthy obesity " and " metabolically unhealthy obesity " than any other studies to date .
moreover , these potential metabolites could lead to the discovery of a number of important biomarkers for central obesity related metabolic abnormalities .
methods ethics statement this study received ethical approval from health research ethics authority of the faculty of medicine of memorial university , st. john 's , newfoundland , canada , [ with project identification code # 10.33 ( latest date of approval : february 11 , 2016. )] .
written informed consent was obtained from all of the volunteers .
study population we used a two - stage case - control study design , namely , discovery and validation phases .
individuals for both phases were selected from the ongoing coding ( complex diseases in the newfoundland population : environment and genetics ) study [ 25 - 29 ] .
inclusion criteria for the coding study are : 1 ) at least a third generation newfoundlander , 2 ) between the ages of 20 and 79 years old , 3 ) not pregnant at the time of study .
the metabolic characteristics used for the classification of subjects being of metabolically unhealthy or healthy are as follows : metabolically unhealthy central obesity ( muco ) - 1 ) homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( homa - ir ) > 4.27 ( 90th percentile ) [ 9 , 11 ] , 2 ) high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) level < 1.03 mmol / l in men and < 1.30 mmol / l in women [ 9 , 11 ] , 3 ) fasting blood glucose >= 5.6 mmol / l [ 9 , 11 ] , and 4 ) waist circumference > 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women [ 9 , 11 ] ; metabolically healthy peripheral obesity ( mhpo ) - 1 ) homa - ir < 4.27 [ 9 , 11 ] , 2 ) hdl - c level >= 1.03 mmol / l in men and >= 1.30 mmol / l in women [ 9 , 11 ] , 3 ) fasting blood glucose < 5.6 mmol / l [ 9 , 11 ] , and 4 ) waist circumference <= 102 cm in men and <= 88 cm in women [ 9 , 11 ] .
in the discovery stage , two groups of obese individuals ( 10 muco and 10 mhpo ) were selected .
all study participants were classified as obese according to the world health organization ( who ) criteria for obesity ( body mass index , bmi >= 30 kg / m2 ) .
subjects of the two groups were matched for age , bmi , total dietary calorie intake , and physical activity level .
in the follow validation stage , a normal weight group ( nw , 20 subjects ) and two obese groups ( 29 subjects for muco group and 30 subjects for mhpo group ) were selected .
the metabolic characteristics used to distinguish the two obese groups were the same as during the discovery stage , except bmi was expanded to above 27.2 due to the difficulty in identifying samples meeting the stringent criteria of the studying groups .
the metabolic characteristics for nw group were same to mhpo group except with 18 < bmi < 25 .
subjects of the three groups were also matched for age , sex , total dietary calorie intake , and physical activity level , with muco and mhpo additionally matched for bmi .
anthropometric and body composition measurements all measurements were performed in the morning following a 12 - h fasting period .
subjects were weighed ( health o meter , bridgeview , il ) to the nearest 0.1 kg in standardized clothing ( hospital gown ) .
height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a fixed stadiometer .
bmi was calculated from weight and height in kilograms per square meter .
waist circumference was measured midway between the lowest rib and iliac crest and evaluated using a measuring tape to the nearest 0.1 cm. blood pressure ( bp ) was measured twice by manual oscillometric methods in the morning after sitting for 10 minutes after the subjects arrived at the laboratory .
whole body composition measurements including fat mass , lean body mass were measured using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) lunar prodigy ( ge medical systems , madison , wi ) equipped with encore software package ( ge medical systems ) version 12.3 [ 11 , 27 ] .
the total percent body fat ( bf %) , percent trunk fat ( tf %) , and percent android fat ( af %) were determined .
the lunar prodigy software system determines automatically the regions .
trunk fat region is from the top of the shoulders to the top of the iliac crest , while the android fat region is the top of the second lumbar vertebra to the top of the iliac crest .
visceral adipose tissue content was estimated by corescan [ 30 , 31 ] within the android region and percent visceral fat ( vf %) was determined .
dietary assessment dietary intake patterns of each participant were assessed using willett food frequency questionnaire ( ffq ) , a semi - quantitative method for the assessment of dietary intake patterns .
the willett ffq is the most widely used dietary intake questionnaire for the study of nutritional information at the population level [ 32 - 34 ] .
for each food item listed , participants had to indicate their average use of the specified amount per week over the last year .
based on the choice selected , the amount was converted to a mean daily intake value .
the daily intake for each food item consumed was entered into a meal plan using nutribase clinical nutrition manager ( version 8.2.0 ; cybersoft inc , arizona ) and the daily macronutrient , micronutrient and total calorie intakes were automatically computed by the nutribase software [ 35 ] .
physical activity physical activity levels were measured using the aric - baecke questionnaire , which consists of a work index , sports index , and leisure time activity index [ 36 ] .
all responses from this questionnaire were scored based on a five point scale with the exception of the name of the participant 's main occupation and the type of sports played .
three levels of physical activity ( low , medium and high ) were defined for occupation and sports .
physical activity was then measured via assessment of the number of hours spent doing the activity per week , the number of months spent doing the activity per year and the assigned exertion level .
the work , sports , and leisure time activity indices were added together to give an estimate of total physical activity .
serum lipids , glucose and insulin measurement venous blood samples were obtained from all volunteers in the morning after an overnight fast ( 12 h ) .
serum samples were isolated from blood and stored at - 80 degreesc for subsequent analysis .
concentrations of serum high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( hdl - c ) , triglycerides ( tg ) and glucose were analyzed using synchron reagents with an lx20 analyzer ( beckman coulter inc. , fremont , ca , usa ) .
additionally , the serum insulin level was measured using an immunoassay analyzer ( immulite ; dpc , los angeles , ca , usa ) [ 11 ] .
homa - ir [ 37 ] was calculated as follows : homa - ir = [( fasting insulin ( mu / l ) x fasting glucose ( mmol / l ))/ 22.5 ] serum metabolites measurement metabolic profiling was performed by using the waters xevo tq ms system ( waters limited , mississauga , ontario , canada ) coupled with the biocrates absoluteidq p180 kit ( innsbruck , austria ) , which can simultaneously identify and quantify 186 metabolites including 21 amino acids , 19 biogenic amines , 40 acylcarnitines ( including free carnitine ) , 15 sphingomyelins , 90 glycerophospholipids ( 14 lysophosphatidylcholines ( lysopc ) and 76 phosphatidylcholines ( pc )) and 1 hexose (> 90 % is glucose ) .
the assay procedures of the kit as well as the metabolite nomenclature have been described in detail previously [ 23 , 24 ] .
statistical analyses data of the general characteristics of the study participants are presented as means +/ - sds .
differences in anthropometry , dietary intakes and physical activity were assessed using student 's t - test .
the sex ratio was analyzed by chi - square tests .
spss software version 19.0 ( spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) was used for these analyses .
all tests were two - sided and a p - value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant .
in the discovery stage , the partial least squares discriminant analysis ( pls - da ) method was used to identify the characteristic metabolites with significant difference between the two groups , using simca - p 11.5 ( umetrics ab , umea , sweden ) software .
since there were vast differences in the absolute concentrations among different metabolites , all data were mean - centered and standardized before analyses .
in pls - da , the r2x , r2y and q2 ( cum ) parameters were used for the model evaluation , representing the explanation , fitness and prediction power respectively .
r2x is the percentage of all response variables explained by the model .
r2y describes the percentage of variation explained by the model .
q2 shows the predictive value of the model .
the importance of each metabolite in the pls - da was evaluated by variable importance in the projection ( vip ) score .
the vip score positively reflects the metabolite 's influence on the classification , and metabolites with vip > 1 were considered important in the study .
additionally , the kruskal - wallis test was executed using multi experiment view ( v.4.9 ) software to determine the significant metabolites .
the significance level was defined as p < 0.05 .
those with vip > 1 and p < 0.05 were recognized as the most important metabolites and bonferroni method ( pbonferroni = 1 - 0.951 / n ) was used to correct for multiple testing in different categories of metabolites .
a p - value <= pbonferroni was considered to be statistically significant ; hexose : <= 0.05 , amino acid : <= 0.005 , biogenic amines : <= 0.013 , acylcarnitines : <= 0.004 , glycerophospholipids : <= 0.006 .
in the following validation stage , the normal distributions of the 8 statistically significant metabolites survived from the discovery study were analyzed .
logarithmic transformation was used for the variables that did not show normal distribution .
one - way anova followed by tukey test was used to analyze significant difference between groups by spss software version 19.0 .
bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple testing .
a p - value <= 0.005 was considered to be statistically significant .
results demographic and metabolic characteristics of participants twenty obese subjects were included in the discovery stage .
the general characteristics of the subjects in the discovery stage are shown in table 1 .
there were no significant differences for age , bmi , sex ratio , bf % , tf % , af % , systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) , dietary food intake and physical activity between the two groups .
waist circumference , visceral fat mass , vf % , serum tg , glucose , insulin levels and homa - ir value in muco group were significantly higher than in mhpo group ( p < 0.05 ) .
hdl - c level was lower in muco group than in mhpo group ( p < 0.001 ) .

while , after multiple testing adjustment , hexose , leucine , isoleucine , tyrosine , valine , phenylalanine , alphaaaa , met - so and c3 were still statistically significantly different between the two groups .
however , glucose accounted for 90 % of the hexose in the metabolomics approach used , thus the elevation of hexose in the muco subjects is probably owing to the high level of fasting glucose .
therefore , all these metabolites except hexose were identified as the key metabolites distinguishing muco and mhpo groups and were further examined in the validation stage .
metabolomics profiles changes among groups in the validation stage the significant differences of 8 metabolites were further examined during the validation stage .
five metabolites were identified as statistically significant among the three groups .
as shown in table 4 , serum leucine , isoleucine , valine , alphaaaa , c3 levels were significant higher in muco group compared to nm or mhpo groups after multiple testing adjustment ( p < 0.001 ) .
there were no statistically significant differences on the concentration of the 5 metabolites between mhpo and nw groups .

we discovered significant increases in 5 serum metabolites ( leucine , isoleucine , valine , alphaaaa and c3 acylcarnitine ) that distinguished metabolically unhealthy centrally obese from metabolically healthy peripherally obese patients .
obesity is one of the primary risk factor for diabetes and other metabolic conditions [ 2 ] .
however , paradoxically a significant proportion of obese individuals in the general population can exhibit a phenotype free of metabolic abnormalities [ 6 , 9 , 10 ] .
consequently , recent studies have suggested that the differentiation of metabolic health status among obese individuals is partially due to different fat distribution [ 38 ] .
abdominal visceral fat accumulation or central obesity is currently known to be the key risk factor that links to metabolic abnormalities in obesity [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] .
essentially , centrally obese patients have significantly higher risk of one or more abnormalities related to lipids , insulin , glucose , blood pressure and inflammation than peripherally obese patients [ 4 , 5 , 8 ] .
however , the specific downstream metabolic characteristic and molecular mechanisms which distinguish the metabolically unhealthy obese phenotype from metabolically healthy obese phenotype remain poorly understood .
the criteria applied to define metabolically unhealthy and healthy obesity vary largely in the current literature [ 6 - 12 ] .
apparently , the stringency of criteria used in a study will affect the numbers and types metabolites that will be detected .
to date , three studies have been performed using metabolomics technology to address the metabolic profiles between metabolically unhealthy and healthy obese individuals [ 20 - 22 ] .
however , none of the studies considered the role of fat distribution and neither had normal weight control group .
in our current study , on top of defining different phenotypes of obesity with waist circumference , which is known as an effective predictor abdominal visceral fat accumulation [ 39 , 40 ] , stricter criteria were taken with both ms and ir been used when defining metabolically healthy and unhealthy obesity [ 9 , 11 ] .
moreover , visceral fat mass and visceral fat percentage were measured and found significantly higher in muco group .
furthermore , the aforementioned groups were matched for age , sex , total dietary calorie intake , physical activity and bmi to eliminate the confounding effects of these factors on metabolites .
age and sex are primarily important factors that affect metabolism and the metabolites studied [ 41 - 43 ] .
total calorie intake is a critical factor in maintaining energy balance and likely the levels of various metabolites : amino acids , lipids and carbohydrates [ 44 ] .
in addition , physical activity level is likely the most important non - dietary factor to influence the general metabolism of all the macro - and micro - nutrients [ 44 , 45 ] .
it is extremely important to properly control these factors in a study that analyzes and compares hundreds of metabolites .
moreover , a nw group was added as the control group in the validation stage to further emphasize differences in obesity associated risk factors related to metabolic health .
these stringency are important and indicate our findings are likely more specific and accurate .
in the validation stage , we successfully confirmed the elevation of 5 serum metabolites ( leucine , isoleucine , valine , alphaaaa , c3 acylcarnitine ) discovered in the first stage that are associated with metabolically unhealthy centrally obese patients .
no significant difference was found between mhpo and nw control group .
leucine , isolucine , and valine are bcaas .
bcaas comprise approximately 40 % of the free essential amino acids in blood .
they play important roles in maintenance and growth of skeletal muscle , are used as an energy source during exercise , and can serve as gluconeogenic precursors [ 46 ] .
in humans , serum bcaas cannot be created from other compounds and mainly come from dietary protein , amino acids and endogenous protein catabolism in muscle [ 47 ] .
the two groups of obese patients from our study had no significant difference in dietary intake of protein or amino acids ( shown in additional file 2 : table s2 and additional file 3 : table s3 ) .
these results suggest that the significantly higher level of bcaas in muco individuals may be due to the increased protein catabolism , likely secondary to insulin resistance [ 14 , 48 ] .
a recent theory suggested that increased circulating concentration of bcaas might be caused by a block of bcaas catabolism in the mitochondria of adipose tissue [ 48 - 51 ] , with visceral fat playing an important role in this regard [ 52 ] .
furthermore , accumulating evidence indicated that abnormal levels of circulating bcaas were involved in various diseases , including chronic liver disease [ 53 ] , obesity [ 54 ] , diabetes [ 55 ] , cardiovascular disease [ 56 ] and cancer [ 57 ] .
it has long been recognized that bcaas are elevated in the blood of patients with obesity , ir or diabetes [ 14 , 54 , 55 , 58 - 60 ] .
the finding from our present study provides the first link between increased serum bcaas levels with central obesity specifically , rather than with peripheral obesity .
the precise molecular mechanisms mediating the association between bcaas and metabolic abnormalities during obesity is unclear , but may be related to the activation of mtor - s6 k1 induced disruption of insulin signaling or the inhibition of gcn2 , atf4 and ampk mediated lipid , glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis disorder [ 14 , 57 , 61 ] .
acylcarnitines are formed intracellularly from carnitine during the metabolism of long - chain fatty acids and bcaas [ 62 , 63 ] .
in our study , we discovered that serum acylcarnitine c3 ( propionylcarnitine ) were significantly higher in muco individuals .
c3 is a product of bcaas mitochondrial catabolism , especially isoleucine and valine catabolism [ 14 ] .
elevation of serum c3 levels was also observed in patients with obesity or diabetes previously [ 14 , 64 - 66 ] , and the increased bcaa degradation in muscle tissue or liver associated with the increased serum bcaa levels was considered as a potential cause [ 14 ] .
biogenic amines are bioactive substances containing one or more amine groups .
they are basic nitrogenous compounds formed mainly by decarboxylation of amino acids or by amination and transamination of aldehydes and ketones .
among the biogenic amines measured in the current study , only serum alpha - aminoadipic acid ( alphaaaa ) was significantly different among the groups .
alphaaaa is a product of lysine degradation in mammals [ 67 , 68 ] , that has been identified as a biomarker for the development of t2dm and a potential modulator of glucose homeostasis in humans [ 69 , 70 ] .
reports on the changes of serum alphaaaa level in obesity are rare , while a study from korea described significantly higher serum alphaaaa levels in obese children [ 71 ] .
it is well known that obesity , especially central obesity is the primary risk factor for the development of ir and diabetes [ 6 , 10 - 12 ] .
however the factors that link obesity and diabetes are largely unknown .
the patients in the present study were well defined having central obesity .
our finding strongly suggests that alphaaaa is at least one important factor mediating central obesity and diabetes .
this study had a number of limitations to consider .
first , this is a cross - sectional case - control study .
sequential observations made in a prospective manner would provide more useful information .
secondly , although the targeted metabolomics approach explored 186 metabolites , we might have missed important metabolites which the panel does not have .
finally , although homa - ir is a widely accepted measure of ir , hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique is considered a more accurate method to measure ir [ 72 ] .
conclusions this is the first study using a targeted metabolomics approach and two - stage study design to identify serum metabolites differences between metabolically healthy peripheral obese and unhealthy central obese individuals .
we found significantly higher levels of serum branched - chain amino acids ( leucine , isoleucine , valine ) , propionylcarnitine ( c3 acylcarnitine ) and alphaaaa to distinguish metabolically unhealthy central obesity from metabolically healthy peripheral obesity .
the identified metabolites provide novel insights into the metabolic characteristic and pathogenesis of metabolic abnormalities in central obesity .
future studies are warranted to further verify the relevance of these novel metabolites associated with central obesity , and elucidate the underlying biochemical mechanisms .

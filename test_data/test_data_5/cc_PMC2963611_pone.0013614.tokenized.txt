members of the mir - 200 family of micro rnas ( mirnas ) have been shown to inhibit epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) .
emt of tubular epithelial cells is the mechanism by which renal fibroblasts are generated .
here we show that mir - 200 family members inhibit transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) - induced emt of tubular cells .
unilateral ureter obstruction ( uuo ) is a common model of emt of tubular cells and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis .
in order to examine the role of mir - 200 family members in tubulointerstitial fibrosis , their expression was investigated in the kidneys of uuo mice .
the expression of mir - 200 family mirnas was increased in a time - dependent manner , with induction of mir - 200b most pronounced .
to clarify the effect of mir - 200b on tubulointerstitial fibrosis , we injected mir - 200b precursor intravenously .
a single injection of 0.5 nm mir - 200b precursor was sufficient to inhibit the increase of collagen types i , iii and fibronectin in obstructed kidneys , and amelioration of fibrosis was confirmed by observation of the kidneys with azan staining .
mir - 200 family members have been previously shown to inhibit emt by reducing the expression of zeb - 1 and zeb - 2 which are known repressors of e - cadherin .
we demonstrated that expression of zeb - 1 and zeb - 2 was increased after ureter obstruction and that administration of the mir - 200b precursor reversed this effect .
in summary , these results indicate that mir - 200 family is up - regulated after ureter obstruction , mir - 200b being strongly induced , and that mir - 200b ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys .
we suggest that members of the mir - 200 family , and mir - 200b specifically , might constitute novel therapeutic targets in kidney disease .
introduction micro rnas are small non - coding rna molecules that can regulate gene expression by interacting with multiple mrnas and inducing either translational suppression or degradation of mrna .
recently , several mirnas have been implicated in regulating the initial step in epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) .
several reports have shown that members of the mir - 200 family ( mir - 200a,b,c , mir - 141 and mir - 429 ) inhibit emt through direct targeting of zeb1 and zeb2 , which encode transcriptional repressors of e - cadherin in kidney tubular cells [ 1 ] , breast cancer cells [ 2 ] , and mammary epithelial cells [ 3 ] .
recent reports have indicated that a double - negative feedback loop between zeb1 , zeb2 and mirna - 200 family members regulates emt in kidney tubular cells [ 4 ] .
in addition to being an early step in tumor metastasis , emt is known to be associated with many pathophysiological situations , such as formation of various tissues during embryonic development [ 5 ] , and of keratinocytes during wound healing [ 6 ] .
in the kidneys , emt of tubular epithelial cells is a mechanism by which renal fibroblasts are generated , and the importance of emt has been demonstrated in experimental models , where blockade of emt attenuates renal fibrosis .
renal fibrosis correlates with decline of renal function and is one of the causes of impaired renal function .
the inhibition of emt of tubular epithelial cells therefore represents a possible novel therapeutic approach to counteract the progression of renal disease [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
a common model of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis is the mouse model of unilateral ureter obstruction ( uuo ) [ 9 ] .
given their ability to inhibit emt , we investigated whether injection of mir - 200 mirna family precursors - chemically modified double strand of rna which form rna - induced silencing complex ( risc ) like complex and can be processed by endonuclease dicer into mature mir - 200 family in cells - could ameliorate tubulointerstitial fibrosis by inhibition of emt of tubular epithelial cells in uuo model mice .
materials and methods western blotting of e - cadherin and n - cadherin western blotting analysis of e - cadherin and n - cadherin was performed in hk - 2 cells stimulated with 10 ng / ml transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) for 24 , 48 and 72 hours .
to investigate the effect of micro rnas on emt , hk - 2 cells were transfected with 20 pmol / ml mir - 200 family precursors for 24 hours using lipofectamine rnaimax ( invitrogen ) , then stimulated with 10 ng / ml tgf - beta .
after 24 hours the expression of e - cadherin and n - cadherin was investigated with western blotting .
western blotting analysis was performed following .
ten micro gram of protein extracts were separated on 10 % sds - polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nylon membranes ( millipore corp. , bedford , ma ) using a semidry blotting system ( amersham pharmacia biotech , uppsala , sweden ) .

antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:300 .
the membranes were washed three times with the blocking buffer and then incubated with secondary antibodies , which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( amersham pharmacia biotech , buckinghamshire , united kingdom ) at a final dilution of 1:7,000 .
after final washes with 1x pbs , 0.2 % tween 20 , the signals were detected using ecl chemiluminescence reagents ( amersham pharmacia biotech ) .

the data are normalized to beta - actin mrna and shown as mean +/ - s.e. ( n = 8 ) .
we next investigated the role of mir - 200 family members in emt of tubular cells in uuo mice .
micro rna assays showed that expression of all members of the mir - 200 family tested were increased in a time - dependent manner after ureter obstruction ( fig. 1d ) ; the induction of mir - 200b was most pronounced .
since the most efficient in vitro inhibition of tgf - beta was mediated by the mir200 - b mirna ( fig. 1b and fig. 1c ) we next evaluated its effect in vivo by injecting mir - 200b precursor via the abdominal vein prior to occlusion of the left ureter .
a single injection of 0.5 nm mir - 200b precursor was sufficient to ameliorate tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the kidney 6 days after uuo ( fig. 1e ) , an observation confirmed by real time pcr analysis of type i collagen , type iii collagen and fibronectin and azan staining ( fig. 1e ) .

previous studies showed that inhibition of emt by mir - 200 family members was mediated by their inhibition of the expression of the e - cadherin repressors zeb1 and zeb2 through binding to the 3 ' - utr region of zeb1 and zeb2 mrnas [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] .
in order to confirm that mir - 200 family members target zeb1 and zeb2 3 ' - utrs , we co - transfected either zeb1 - 3'utr - luciferase or zeb2 - 3'utr - luciferase reporter vectors with mir - 200 family precursors in hk - 2 cells .
the luciferase activity of both reporters was significantly reduced in the presence of all mir - 200 family members tested ( fig. 3 ) .

real time pcr analysis confirmed that zeb1 and zeb2 were induced in a time - dependent manner after obstruction ( fig. 4a , b ) , an effect reversed by injection of mir - 200b precursor ( fig. 4c ) .
these results indicate that members of the mir - 200 family of mirnas are induced after ureter obstruction and that mir - 200b ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys .

discussion in this report , we show that members of the mir - 200 family of mirnas are induced after ureter obstruction and that mir - 200b ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys via inhibition of emt of tubular cells .
recent reports indicate that a cluster of key micrornas are highly expressed in kidneys [ 12 ] and that there are differences in the micro rna expression profile in renal cortex versus medulla [ 13 ] ; however , it was not until recently that specific roles of micro rnas in renal function were investigated .
these studies revealed that key micro rnas can play roles in tgf - beta1 actions [ 14 ] and diabetic kidney disease [ 15 ] and that podocyte - specific deletion of dicer , a key enzyme involved in micro rna biogenesis , led to progressive glomerular and tubular damage along with proteinuria and other podocyte defects in mice [ 16 ] .
kato et al. demonstrated that the expression mir - 192 is increased in renal glomeruli obtained from mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes relative to corresponding control mice [ 14 ] .
they also showed that the expression of mir - 192 was increased by tgf - beta in mouse mesangial cells ( mcs ) , whereas , conversely , the expression of its target , zeb2 , was decreased .
this also paralleled in increased collagen 1 - alpha 2 ( col 1a2 ) and tgf - beta expression .
these results suggested that the increase in tgf - beta in vivo in diabetic glomeruli and in vitro in mcs could induce mir - 192 expression , which could target and down - regulate zeb2 thereby to increase col 1a2 .
several articles have shown that the mir - 200 family targets zeb1 and zeb2 [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
we also observed that zeb1 and zeb2 was a target of mir - 200 family members that tended to be up - regulated by tgf - beta in kidney tubular cell lines .
thus , tgf - beta - induced increase in the expression of micrornas ( mir - 192 and mir - 200 family members ) might coordinately down - regulate e - box repressors zeb1 and zeb2 to inhibit emt and fibrosis of kidneys .
conversely , the down - regulation of zeb1 and zeb2 by tgf - beta via mir - 200 family and mir - 192 can affect upstream e - box regions [ 14 ] .
conversely , there are several reports that mir - 200 family members and mir - 192 can be down - regulated by tgf - beta , and this promotes emt in cancer and other cell lines via subsequent up - regulation of targets zeb1 and zeb2 to repress e - cadherin [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
thus the effects of renal micrornas may be cell type specific , and the microrna signaling networks that mediate the effects of tgf - beta on mcs and epithelial cells and on metastatic and fibrotic emt may not be identical .
tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a common pathological event in the kidney during progressive renal injury and previous reports have shown that inhibition of tubulointerstitial fibrosis has a beneficial effect on kidney function [ 17 ] - [ 19 ] .
we suggest that members of the mir - 200 family , and mir - 200b specifically , might constitute novel therapeutic targets in various kidney diseases .
previous studies have shown that , in addition to tgf - beta , renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis can be induced by toll like receptor [ 18 ] and connective tissue growth factor [ 20 ] and that this effect can be opposed angiotensin ii receptor blockers [ 21 ] , statins [ 22 ] , ppar gamma agonists [ 23 ] and vitamin d [ 24 ] .
we suggest that the therapeutic role of mir - 200 family members be investigated in other models of kidney disease , particularly in the context of these factors .
finally , an alternative therapeutic approach in kidney disease may be to identify compounds that increase the expression levels of members of the mir - 200 family of micrornas .
conclusion this study indicates that mir - 200 family is up - regulated after ureter obstruction , mir - 200b being strongly induced , and that mir - 200b ameliorates tubulointerstitial fibrosis in obstructed kidneys .

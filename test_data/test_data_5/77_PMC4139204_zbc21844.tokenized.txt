2014 author 's choice - - final version full access.creative commons attribution unported license applies to author choice articles background : the nurd complex controls gene expression through altering chromatin structure .
results : the mta1 - rbap48 structure shows how the rbap46 / p48 histone chaperones are recruited to nurd .
conclusion : the mta subunits act as scaffolds for nurd complex assembly .
significance : the mta / rbap48 interaction prevents binding of histone h4 , which is crucial for understanding the role of the rbap46 / p48 chaperones in the complex .
the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase ( nurd ) complex is a widely conserved transcriptional co - regulator that harbors both nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities .
it plays a critical role in the early stages of es cell differentiation and the reprogramming of somatic to induced pluripotent stem cells .
abnormalities in several nurd proteins are associated with cancer and aging .
we have investigated the architecture of nurd by determining the structure of a subcomplex comprising rbap48 and mta1 .
surprisingly , rbap48 recognizes mta1 using the same site that it uses to bind histone h4 , showing that assembly into nurd modulates rbap46 / 48 interactions with histones .
taken together with other results , our data show that the mta proteins act as scaffolds for nurd complex assembly .
we further show that the rbap48 - mta1 interaction is essential for the in vivo integration of rbap46 / 48 into the nurd complex .
chromatin chromatin structure gene regulation protein assembly protein structure mta1 nurd complex rbbp4 rbap48 national institutes of healthod010949 - 10 introduction in eukaryotes , chromatin structure is modulated by multiprotein enzymes such as the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase ( nurd ) complex.8 nurd can both activate and repress transcription ( 1 - 3 ) , and it is essential for embryonic development in complex organisms ( 4 ) .
it also plays a role in dna damage repair ( 5 ) , and the silencing of nurd components leads to changes in chromatin structure that mimic aging ( 6 ) .
in mammals , the nurd complex consists of ~ 10 proteins that are consistently observed during purification .
chd4 ( mi - 2beta ) is an atp - dependent helicase that can reposition nucleosomes ( 7 ) .
hdac1 and hdac2 remove acetyl groups from lysine residues and are associated with gene repression ( 8 ) .
gatad2a and gatad2b ( p66alpha / p66beta ) are potent transcriptional repressors ( 9 , 10 ) but are otherwise poorly characterized , whereas mbd2 and mbd3 , which appear to be mutually exclusive in nurd , contain methyl cpg binding domains ( 11 - 13 ) .
mbd3 has been shown to play a key role in suppressing pluripotency in early development ( 14 , 15 ) .
rbap46 and rbap48 ( rbbp7 / rbbp4 ) are ~ 50 - kda wd - repeat proteins ( 16 , 17 ) that were first recognized for their ability to bind the tumor suppressor rb ( 18 ) .
a role for rbap48 as a mediator of age - related memory loss has also recently been reported ( 19 ) .
rbap46 and rbap48 together with hdac1 and hdac2 have been proposed to form a core deacetylase complex ( 20 ) that is common to both the nurd and sin3 complexes .
rbap46 and rbap48 are also found in other gene regulatory complexes , such as nurf ( nucleosome remodeling factor ) ( 21 ) and prc2 ( polycomb repressive complex 2 ) ( 22 ) .
mta1 , mta2 , and mta3 are highly related proteins that contain several well conserved structured domains at their n termini ( fig. 1 ) .
their c - terminal regions are less conserved and are predicted to be largely disordered .
mta1 is one of the most up - regulated genes in human cancers and is particularly associated with metastatic and aggressive tumors and with poor prognosis ( 23 - 25 ) .

the kraarr motif is boxed in gray .
despite its central importance in development , very little is known about the architecture of the nurd complex , how it assembles , and which combinations of the components form stable complexes .
there are three - dimensional structures available for two intact subunits , namely rbap46 / 48 ( 16 , 17 ) and hdac2 / hdac1 ( 26 , 27 ) .
there are also structures of isolated domains , including the phd domains ( 28 ) and one chromodomain ( pdb code 2ee1 ) of chd4 , the methyl - dna binding domain of mbd2 ( 29 ) and the sant domain of mta3 ( pdb code 2crg ) .
although many intersubunit interactions have been reported ( 30 ) , these data are almost exclusively limited to gst pulldown and co - immunoprecipitation assays .
however , there are structures of the ~ 40 - residue coiled - coil formed between mbd2 and gatad2a ( 31 ) as well as , notably , of the elm2 - sant domain of mta1 bound to hdac1 ( 27 ) .
here we show that the mta proteins also recruit the histone chaperones rbap46 / 48 , suggesting that mta1 / 2 / 3 act as a scaffold in nurd .
moreover , our structure of the mta1 - rbap48 complex shows that the interaction of mta subunits with rbap46 / 48 modulates binding of histones h3 - h4 , a substrate of the complex .
experimental procedures plasmid construction flag - tagged human rbap48 ( uniprot : q09028 ) was constructed by pcr and cloned into pcdna3 .
mta1 constructs ( residues 1 - 250 , 230 - 550 , and 530 - 715 ) were generated by pcr amplification of the human gene ( uniprot : q13330 ) and cloned into pcdna3 .
mta1 constructs ( residues 530 - 635 , 625 - 715 , 643 - 695 , and 656 - 686 ) were created by pcr amplification from codon - optimized sequences for bacterial expression ( genscript ) and cloned into pgex - 6p with an n - terminal gst tag .
protein production for biochemical / structural analysis pcdna3 constructs were expressed in vitro in the presence of [ 35s ] methionine .
gst - mta1 constructs were expressed in the bl21 strain of escherichia coli and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1 - thio - beta - d - galactopyranoside .
the culture was incubated with shaking at 25 degreesc overnight , and the protein was subsequently purified by glutathione affinity chromatography .
gst - h4 - ( 1 - 48 ) was expressed and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography as described previously ( 16 ) .
recombinant rbap48 was expressed and purified from insect cells as described previously ( 17 ) .
peptide synthesis all mta1 peptides used here were synthesized and purified ( to 95 % purity ) by chinapeptides ( shanghai , china ) with acetyl - and amide - capping groups at the n - and c - terminal ends , respectively .
pulldown assays rbap48 and mta1 constructs were in vitro translated in the presence of 35s - labeled methionine using the tnt quick coupled transcription / translation kit ( promega ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
in vitro translated 35s - labeled flag - rbap48 ( 20 mul ) was immobilized onto agarose beads conjugated to anti - flag ( m2 ) antibodies ( sigma ) in binding buffer ( 50 mm tris , ph 7.5 , 300 mm nacl , 0.5 % triton x - 100 , complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet ( roche applied science ) , and 1 mm dtt ) .
the mixture was incubated with in vitro translated 35s - labeled - mta1 fragments ( 40 mul ) at 4 degreesc for 2 h. the beads were then washed five times with binding buffer .
anti - flag beads alone were used as a negative control .
complexes were resolved by sds - page and visualized by autoradiography .
gst pulldown assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of gst or gst - mta1 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione - sepharose beads ( amersham biosciences ) with in vitro translated 35s - labeled rbap48 .
the mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 degreesc and washed 5 times with binding buffer .
complexes were resolved by sds - page and visualized by autoradiography .
isothermal titration calorimetry ( itc ) itc measurements were carried out at 25 degreesc using a microcal itc200 titration calorimeter .
rbap48 and mta1 peptides were dialyzed separately overnight against a buffer containing 20 mm tris , ph 7.5 , and 150 mm nacl .
the mta1 peptide ( 250 mum ) was titrated into rbap48 ( 25 mum , 200 mul ) in a series of 20 ( 2 mul ) injections with a 2.5 - min interval between each injection .
the reference power was set to 2 mucal / s , and the cell was stirred continuously at 1000 rpm .
the evolved heats were integrated and normalized for protein concentration .
after base - line correction ( using data from the titration of the mta1 peptide into buffer ) , the data were fitted to a simple single - site binding model using the microcal origin 7.0 software package .
crystallization and structure determination mta1 peptides ( comprising residues 656 - 686 , 670 - 695 , and 670 - 711 ) were dissolved in 50 mm tris , ph 8.0 .
concentrated rbap48 protein ( 5 mg / ml ) was mixed with mta1 peptide at a molar ratio of 1:4 .
co - crystallization trials were set up in 96 - well plates as sitting drops using either an oryx6 protein crystallization robot ( douglas instruments ) or nanodrop mosquito robot and commercial crystallization screens ( morpheus ( gorrec 2009 ) and nextaldwblocks , qiagen ) .
crystals grew in 1 - 2 days at 18 degreesc in several conditions .
x - ray data were collected for the rbap48 - mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) complex from single crystals obtained in 10 % w / v polyethylene glycol ( peg ) 20,000 , 20 % v / v polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550 , 0.2 m 1,6 - hexanediol , 0.2 m 1 - butanol , 0.2 m ( rs ) - 1,2 - propanediol , 0.2 m 2 - propanol , 0.2 m 1,4 - butanediol , 0.2 m 1,3 - propanediol , and 0.1 m mes / imidazole , ph 6.5 .
for the rbap48 - mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) complex , data were collected from crystals obtained in 12.5 % w / v peg 1000 , 12.5 % w / v peg 3350 , 12.5 % v / v 2 - methyl - 2,4 - pentanediol , 0.2 m 1,6 - hexanediol , 0.2 m 1 - butanol , 0.2 m ( rs ) - 1,2 - propanediol , 0.2 m 2 - propanol , 0.2 m 1,4 - butanediol , 0.2 m 1,3 - propanediol , and 0.1 m mes / imidazole ph 6.5 .
crystals of rbap48 - mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) grew in 0.2 m calcium acetate and 20 % w / v peg 3350 .
crystals were harvested in mother liquor before cryogenic cooling in liquid nitrogen .
all crystals were cryo - protected with the addition of 25 % glycerol .
diffraction data were collected at the diamond light source beamline i04 ( for crystals of rbap48 - mta1 - ( 656 - 686 )/( 670 - 695 )) and using an in - house rotating copper anode generator ( for crystals of rbap48 - mta1 - ( 670 - 711 )) .
data were processed and scaled using mosflm ( 32 ) and scala ( 33 ) .
the structures were solved by molecular replacement with the program phaser ( 34 ) using rbap48 as the search model ( pdb code 2xu7 ) .
models were built with coot ( 35 ) and refined using refmac ( 36 ) .
molprobity ( 37 ) was used to validate each structure , and the ebi pisa server ( 38 ) was used for interface analysis .
the atomic coordinates and structure factors for the complexes of rbap48 bound to mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) , mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) and mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) have been deposited into the protein data bank ( pdb entries 4pby , 4pbz , and 4pc0 , respectively ) .
expression and affinity purification of protein a - and gfp - tagged complexes from drosophila melanogaster cells full - length nurf55 ( also known as p55 and caf1 ) is the d. melanogaster homolog of rbap46 / p48 .
it was pcr - amplified and cloned into the pdonr221 vector via the bp ( recombination and insertion of the att b sequence into the att p recombination site ) reaction using standard gateway technology ( invitrogen ) protocols .
five residues in this plasmid were mutated ( l35y , e361q , d362n , e364q , d365n ) to create pdonr - nurf55mut using the quikchange lightning site - directed mutagenesis kit ( agilent technologies ) .
the resulting wild - type and mutant clones were verified by sequencing .
primer sequences for the constructs are available on request .
the nurf55 genes were then transferred into destination vectors for the inducible expression of protein a - or gfp - tagged fusion proteins by the lr ( insertion of sequences containing att l sites into destination att r sites ) reaction according to the manufacturer 's instructions. d. melanogaster dmel - 2 cell lines stably expressing either tagged wild - type or mutant nurf55 ( containing the l35y , e361q , d362n , e364q , and d365n mutations ) were established .
affinity purification of protein a - and gfp - tagged bait and interacting proteins followed by mass spectrometry identification was carried out as previously reported ( 39 - 41 ) .
results a short motif at the c - terminal end of mta - 1 binds rbap48 to delineate the rbap48 binding region of mta1 , we generated a series of in vitro translated n - and c - terminal truncations of mta1 and carried out pulldown experiments using in vitro translated flag - rbap48 as bait .
n - terminal constructs encompassing the bah , elm2 , sant , and zf domains of mta1 did not interact with rbap48 ( figs. 2 , a and b ) , whereas the c - terminal portion of mta1 was robustly pulled down .
pulldown experiments using additional deletion constructs ( fig. 2c ) indicated that mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) was sufficient to bind rbap48 .
comparison of this sequence with those of other rbap48 / rbap46 - binding proteins revealed a short motif ( 678kraarr683 ) that resembles part of the rbap48 / rbap46 binding motif of histone h4 ( 16 , 42 ) .
in histone h4 , this motif adopts a helical conformation when bound to rbap46 .
as mta1 (~ 665 - 682 ) was also predicted to be helical , we wondered whether it might have a similar binding mode .

crystal structures of rbap48 bound to mta1 peptides the shortest fragment of mta1 capable of pulling down in vitro translated rbap48 was mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) ( fig. 2 ) , and so to understand the mode of binding we crystallized a complex of rbap48 bound to mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) ( fig. 3 ) .
diffraction data were collected to 2.50 a resolution and indexed in the space group p21 .
phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the structure of rbap48 ( pdb code 2xu7 ) as a search model ( 17 ) .
mta1 was clearly detectable in the histone h4 binding site on rbap48 in an mfo - dfc difference map .
the kraarr motif of the mta1 peptide was observed , but residues n - terminal to this sequence ( 656 - 672 ) did not give clear electron density , suggesting that they were not ordered .
we , therefore crystallized two further rbap48 - mta1 complexes , where the n terminus of each mta1 peptide was defined by the structurally resolved region in our initial complex ( residue 670 ) .
we extended the c terminus of each mta peptide ( either to residue 695 or 711 ) to explore the extent of the structured segment and collected diffraction data to 2.15 a and 2.50 a resolution , respectively .
two molecules of rbap48 and two molecules of mta1 were found in the asymmetric unit of crystals formed from the complexes of rbap48 and mta1 - ( 656 - 686 and 670 - 711 ) , whereas one molecule of each polypeptide was observed in the asymmetric unit of rbap48 - mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) .
rcryst and rfree for each of the final refined models were , respectively , 18.2 % and 22.5 % for rbap48 - mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) , 18.9 % and 23.1 % for rbap48 - mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) , and 20.6 % and 25.9 % for rbap48 - mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) .
the statistics for data collection and refinement are listed in table 1 .

rbap48 has the seven - bladed beta - propeller fold common to all wd40 - repeat proteins but also displays three non - canonical features : an extended loop ( the pp loop ; ref .
16 ) inserted into blade 6 , a long additional n - terminal alpha - helix that contacts blades 6 and 7 , and a single turn of c - terminal helix after blade 7 .
our structures reveal that the mta1 peptide binds in an amphipathic alpha - helical conformation in the groove on rbap48 formed by these three structural elements ( fig. 3 ) .
as predicted by its sequence similarity with histone h4 , the basic residues in the mta1 kraarr motif make very similar hydrogen bonding and salt bridge contacts with this acidic groove ( fig. 3c ) .
residues lys - 678 / arg - 682 and arg - 679 / arg - 683 of mta1 make analogous contacts to those formed with residues arg - 35 / arg - 39 and arg - 36 / arg - 40 of histone h4 , respectively ( fig. 4a ) .
the presence of electron density from the mta1 sequence kraarr in all three structures strongly suggests that this motif is critical for the interaction between rbap48 and mta1 .

d , overlay of rbap46 / 48 / nurf55 - mta1 / h4 / su ( z ) 12 / h3 / fog - 1 complex structures .
in all parts , rbap48 is shown as a gray surface .
mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) has a higher affinity for rbap48 than does mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) or mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) as expected , pulldown experiments with point mutants confirmed that the kraarr motif is essential for rbap48 recognition by mta1 ( data not shown ) .
we also confirmed the importance of this motif using isothermal titration calorimetry .
in all cases the data fitted well to a simple 1:1 binding isotherm , and dissociation constants from representative measurements were 2.3 +/ - 0.3 , 0.05 +/ - 0.007 , and 0.24 +/ - 0.16 mum for mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) , mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) , and mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) , respectively ( fig. 5 ; standard errors from single curve fits are given ) .
the structures provide a rationale for the higher affinity observed for the mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) and mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) peptides as compared with mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) .
as shown in fig. 3d , residues ile - 688 and leu - 690 form a hydrophobic cluster with leu - 672 .
this cluster , which cannot form in the mta1 - ( 656 - 686 ) peptide , interacts with the aromatic side chain of phe - 30 in rbap48 .
it is not clear at this stage , however , why the affinity of rbap48 for the mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) peptide is apparently lower than that for mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) ; the interactions made in both crystal structures are essentially identical .
our data show that the extreme c terminus of the protein ( leu - 696 - asp - 715 ) is not required for the interaction .

in all cases data were fitted to a one - site model with a stoichiometry of 1:1 .
titrations were carried out at 25 degreesc , and the data were fitted using origin 7.0 and a standard 1:1 binding model ( solid black line in the lower panel ) .
each titration was carried out in duplicate .
mta1 and histone h3 / fog1 bind independently to rbap48 the structural data provide clear evidence that histone h4 and mta1 bind mutually exclusively to rbap48 .
we previously solved the structure of a complex formed by rbap48 and a peptide ( residues 1 - 15 ) derived from the co - regulator fog1 ( 17 ) , demonstrating that the peptide binds in an extended conformation to a groove on one face of the rbap48 beta - propeller ( fig. 4c ) .
schmitges et al .
( 43 ) showed that the n - terminal tail of histone h3 binds to nurf55 in a very similar fashion to fog1 ( fig. 4c ) ( nurf55 , also known as p55 and caf1 , is the sole d. melanogaster homolog of rbap46 / rbap48 ; see fig. 6 ) .
competition - binding experiments were performed to assess whether full - length mta1 might inhibit the interaction of rbap48 with h3 or fog1 peptides and to confirm that h4 and mta1 bind mutually exclusively to rbap48 .
gst - h4 - ( 1 - 48 ) was expressed in bacteria , immobilized onto glutathione beads , and used to pull down rbap48 in the absence and presence of full - length mta1 ( fig. 7a ) .
in a complementary experiment ( fig. 7b ) , in vitro translated flag - rbap48 was immobilized on anti - flag beads and used to pull down mta1 in the absence and presence of histone h4 - ( 1 - 48 ) .
these data support the conclusion that histone h4 and mta1 compete for the same binding surface on rbap48 .
to examine whether mta1 can also inhibit interactions with either histone h3 or fog1 , a competition experiment was performed by adding increasing amounts of fog1 - ( 1 - 15 ) peptide to a complex comprising full - length mta1 and flag - rbap48 immobilized on anti - flag beads ( fig. 7 ) .
in this experiment the fog1 peptide was unable to interfere with the mta1 - rbap48 interaction .
the same result was observed using only a c - terminal mta1 fragment ( residues 530 - 715 ) that includes the kraarr motif identified above .
thus , it is likely that the interaction of mta1 with rbap48 does not affect the interactions with either histone h3 or fog1 .

the input ( i ) lane contains 10 % of the 35s - labeled rbap48 , full - length mta1 , and mta1 - ( 530 - 715 ) proteins used in pulldown assays .
the positive control (+ ve ) is 35s - labeled flag - rbap48 and mta1 without the fog1 - ( 1 - 15 ) peptide , and anti - flag beads plus mta1 alone was used as the negative control ( - ve ) .
the kraarr binding motif is required for the interaction of rbap48 with nurd in vivo next , we sought to determine whether rbap48 and mta1 interact in the same way in vivo , and , if so , whether the interaction of rbap48 with the nurd complex is affected when the rbap48 - mta1 interaction we have identified is abolished .
to this end , we studied the simpler d. melanogaster nurd in which each protein has only a single isoform .
all components bear a high degree of sequence similarity to their mammalian counterparts , rendering this a good model for the mammalian nurd complex .
nurf55 has previously been crystallized in complex with a peptide from histone h4 , and this structure is in close agreement with that of rbap46 bound to the same peptide ( 16 , 44 , 45 ) .
we designed a version of nurf55 in which residues lining the mta1 / histone h4 binding pocket were mutated .
cell lines stably expressing protein a - tagged fusion proteins of either wild - type nurf55 or the mutant ( nurf55mut ) were generated .
rbap46 shares > 90 and 85 % sequence identity with rbap48 and nurf55 , respectively .
we previously demonstrated that when rbap46 is mutated within its charged pp loop ( e356q , d357n , e359q , and d360n ) and within the hydrophobic surface of helix 1 ( l30y ) , these collective mutations abrogate its interaction with histone gst - tagged h4 ( residues 1 - 48 ; ref 16 ) .
we , therefore , made analogous changes to the nurf55 binding pocket ( e361q , d362n , e364q , d365n , and l35y ) to similarly disrupt the interaction of nurf55 with h4 / mta1 .
gfp - tagged versions of these proteins were used to confirm that they share the same subcellular localization as the endogenous protein ( data not shown ) .
we also confirmed that the nurf55 / nurf55mut fusion proteins were expressed at endogenous levels ( fig. 8 ) .
cellular proteins that interact with protein a - tagged nurf55 / nurf55mut were then isolated by affinity purification on igg beads and identified by mass spectrometry as described previously ( 39 , 40 ) .

western blot analysis to compare the expression levels of stably expressed protein a - tagged and endogenous nurf55 in d. melanogaster dmel - 2 cells using an anti - p55 / dcaf1 ( ab1766 ) antibody at 1:5000 dilution .
all of the known subunits of the d. melanogaster nurd complex ( mta - like , mbd - like , rpd3 ( dhdac ) , and mi - 2 ( dchd )) , were pulled down by nurf55 , whereas the equivalent interactions with nurf55mut were not observed ( see table 2 ) .
we also identified simjang and cg18292 as possible drosophila homologs of the mammalian gatad2a / 2b ( p66alpha / p66beta ) and cdk2ap ( doc1 ( 46 )) proteins , respectively .
to confirm these results we carried out a second experiment in which cellular proteins that interact with gfp - tagged nurf55 / nurf55mut were isolated by affinity purification on beads to which a recombinant anti - gfp nanobody had been covalently attached ( 41 ) .
this experiment allowed more efficient purification of the complex and thus better coverage of tryptic peptides from the mi - 2 , rpd3 , simjang , and cg18292 proteins with wild - type nurf55 .
however , once again the numbers of nurd complex peptides detected with the nurf55 mutant were reduced greatly ( see table 2 ) , confirming that disruption of the rbap48 - mta1 interface we identified abolishes the association of rbap48 with the nurd complex .
these data underscore the in vivo importance of the rbap48 - mta1 interaction we identified for the association of rbap48 with the nurd complex .

for the gfp affinity purification , each experiment was performed in triplicate , and the lowest numbers of unique peptides derived from nurd subunits are listed .
in the nurf55 mutant , the following nurf55 residues were mutated to prevent binding to either mta1 or h4 peptides : e361q , d362n , e364q , d365n , and l35y .

roche et al .
( 47 ) showed that the predicted gata - type zinc finger domain of mta1 ( residues 392 - 448 ) is sufficient to recognize rbap46 / 48 , and fu et al .
( 48 ) reported that rbap46 could interact with any of three non - overlapping constructs from the c - terminal portion of mta2 ; only one of these constructs , however , contained the predicted zinc finger .
our crystallographic and biochemical data reveal that a short motif near the c - terminal end of mta1 is able to bind independently to rbap48 .
specifically , residues 672 - 688 of mta1 adopt a conformation that includes a short amphipathic alpha - helix , binding in a distinct pocket formed by three helical elements of rbap48 .
although the apparent inconsistency between these different studies remains unresolved , it is worth noting that gst pulldown assays can give rise to false positive interactions if the domain fused to gst is not correctly folded ( 49 , 50 ) .
despite the apparent divergence of the c - terminal regions of the mta proteins ( e.g. there is 34 % sequence similarity for residues 431 - 715 of human mta1 / 2 compared with 74 % for residues 1 - 430 ) , inspection of the amino acid sequences of mta2 / mta3 and rbap46 indicates that these proteins should be able to substitute for mta1 and rbap48 , respectively , to form analogous interactions ( figs. 1 and 6 ) .
furthermore , a comparison of the sequences of related proteins from diverse organisms that are predicted to contain a nurd - like complex ( figs. 1 and 6 ) suggests that this interaction is broadly conserved .
therefore , it is likely that the interaction we have identified represents a core element of nurd architecture across all organisms .
the mta1 interaction is critical for rbap48 interactions with the nurd complex our mass spectrometry data probing nurd interactions in drosophila cells underscore the importance of the rbap48 - mta1 interaction on several levels .
first , the data show that the mta1 interaction is essential for proper assembly of rbap48 into nurd ( in the context of the full - length , endogenous versions of these proteins ) and is conserved across > 400 million years of evolution .
second , they corroborate the mta1 - binding site that we have identified and suggest that this binding surface is the major ( if not only ) site of contact between nurf55 and the nurd complex .
mta1 and histone h4 compete for the same binding site on rbap48 our data show clearly that mta1 and histone h4 bind to the same surface of rbap46 / 48 .
a comparison of the rbap48 - mta1 and rbap46 - h4 structures shows that essentially all of the intermolecular interactions made by histone h4 side chains are recapitulated in the rbap48 - mta1 complex ( fig. 4a ) .
our crystal structures suggest why the affinities of the longer mta1 peptides for rbap48 are substantially higher than those of histone h4 peptides for rbap46 ( kd of 0.05 mum for mta1 - ( 670 - 695 ) and 0.2 mum for mta1 - ( 670 - 711 ) versus 1 mum for h4 - ( 1 - 48 ) ( 16 )) .
a tyrosine at position 685 in mta1 is positioned in a narrow groove on the surface of rbap48 , forming van der waals contacts with residues that line the groove , but this residue is replaced with a glycine in histone h4 .
as noted above , the rbap46 / 48 proteins are found in a number of chromatin complexes , including sin3 ( 51 ) , prc2 ( 22 ) , nurf ( 21 ) , hat1 ( 42 ) , and caf1 ( 52 ) , and our results suggest that they may play very different roles in each setting .
within the nurd complex the results show that rbap46 / p48 - h3 - h4 interactions are destabilized in the presence of mta proteins , but that rbap46 / p48 can still interact with histones h3 - h4 through the n - terminal tail of histone h3 ( 43 ) .
in other words our results suggest that competition between mta1 and histone h4 inhibits the capacity of rbap46 / 48 ( in the context of nurd ) to interact with histones h3 - h4 as tightly as they would otherwise ( rbap48 binds the histone h3 - h4 complex with a kd of 0.6 nm ; ref. 53 ) .
interactions between rbap48 and histones h3 - h4 might be modulated in several chromatin complexes inspection of the structure of the rbap48 - mta1 peptide complex reveals that the binding surface on rbap48 occupied by the mta1 peptide and histone h4 is also shared with su ( z ) 12 , a component of prc2 ( 43 ) .
interestingly , however , whereas a 12 - residue peptide from su ( z ) 12 occupies the h4 / mta1 - binding site of nurf55 , it does not form an alpha - helix ( 43 ) .
the su ( z ) 12 backbone has instead an irregular conformation , which nevertheless places several residues into positions that mimic the interactions made by mta1 with rbap48 ( fig. 4b ) .
thus , su ( z ) 12r85 occupies the same pocket as mta1r682 , and su ( z ) 12l87 / y89 / f82 forms a hydrophobic cluster that interacts with nurf55f34 ( the equivalent of rbap48f30 ) .
similarly , as shown in fig. 4c ( 17 , 43 ) , fog1 and h3 make highly conserved specific interactions with rbap48 / nurf55 ( distinct from that of mta1 , histone h4 , and su ( z ) 12 ) .
the rbap46 / rbap48 / nurf55 proteins are , therefore , versatile interactors capable of contacting multiple partners via the same interaction sites .
the rbap46 / 48 proteins , which carry no known enzymatic activity or nucleic acid binding capacity , act as chaperones for histones h3 - h4 in the hat1 ( 42 ) and caf1 ( 52 ) complexes .
the finding that both mta1 ( this work ) and su ( z ) 12 ( 45 ) bind in the same site as histone h4 suggests that the very tight binding of the histone h3 - h4 complex by the rbap46 / 48 proteins may be also be modulated in prc2 as well as in nurd .
mta proteins act as a scaffold for nurd complex assembly and the interaction with chromatin through multiple interfaces when taken together with the structure of the mta1 - hdac1 complex ( 27 ) and recent studies of mta1 / chd4 interactions ( 54 ) , our work suggests that the mta proteins act as a scaffold for nurd complex assembly , bringing together multiple proteins that interact with histones , dna , and nucleosomes ( summarized in fig. 9 ) .
the dimeric mta1 recruits , via its elm2 - sant domains ( 27 ) , two molecules of hdac1 , which in turn can bind and deacetylate histone h3 ( 55 ) .
our results suggest that the association of nurd with histones h3 - h4 might be mediated ( in the absence of interactions with transcriptional co - regulators such as fog1 ) by binding of rbap46 / 48 to the n - terminal tail of histone h3 .
consistent with this conclusion , mta1 and mta2 have both been reported to bind the n - terminal tail of h3 in a manner that is inhibited by methylation of h3k4 ( 54 , 56 ) .
the bah domains of several transcriptional regulators , including orc1b ( 57 ) and cmt3 ( 58 ) , have also been demonstrated to act as histone recognition modules .
mta1 contains an n - terminal bah domain ( fig. 1 ) , and this too may be involved in nucleosome interactions .
the recruitment of chd4 through mta1 interactions also allows a number of additional contacts between nurd and chromatin .
the phd domains of chd4 ( and chd3 ) bind nucleosomes ( 28 , 59 - 61 ) , and the phd / chromodomains of chd4 also regulate the chd4 atpase - helicase and chromatin remodeling activity ( 62 , 63 ) .
it is , therefore , clear that the interactions of nurd with nucleosomes are mediated by multivalent interactions ( fig. 9 ) .
an understanding of the interplay of these numerous nurd - chromatin interactions will require structural studies of the intact nurd complex .

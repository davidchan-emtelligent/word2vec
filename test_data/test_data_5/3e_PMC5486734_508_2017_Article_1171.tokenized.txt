summary background after publishing promising results for the treatment of patients with human papilloma virus ( hpv ) positive oropharyngeal cancer with radiochemotherapy regarding 2 - year survival , we present an update of the disease - specific and disease - free survival after 5 years .
patients and methods a total of 29 patients of which 18 were hpv negative and 11 hpv positive with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx received radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) or immunotherapy ( cetuximab ) between 2007 and 2009 .
at time of the present analysis , six patients are still alive including four with hpv positive and two with hpv negative oropharyngeal carcinoma , while 15 out of 16 patients with hpv negative tumors died and 1 died of another cause with evidence of disease .
results since the 2 - year disease - specific survival of patients with hpv positive cancer of the oropharynx was published with 100 % versus 30.4 % in hpv negative tumors , we now present the 5 - year disease - specific survival after treatment , which was 85.7 % in hpv positive versus 11.1 % in hpv negative patients .
conclusion we present the results of patients receiving radiochemo ( immuno ) therapy for oropharyngeal cancer regarding the hpv status , which is still promising .

issue - copyright - statement ( c ) springer - verlag gmbh austria 2017 introduction the development of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck ( scchn ) is mainly caused by commonly known risk factors including alcohol and tobacco abuse .
in the last 15 years human papilloma virus ( hpv ) infections became recognized as a major risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer [ 1 - 3 ] .
the prevalence of scchn with over 500,000 new cases per year worldwide is high [ 4 ] , whereas the incidence of pharyngeal carcinoma is approximately 136,000 and oropharyngeal cancer is on the rise [ 5 ] .
in austria , the incidence of head and neck cancer increased from 567 newly diagnosed carcinomas in 1983 to 1085 head and neck cancer patients in 2012 , while 418 patients with head and neck carcinomas died related to the disease in 1983 and 493 patients in 2014 [ 6 ] .
a marked increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer has been observed in the last decade in austria [ 6 ] and other countries [ 7 , 8 ] .
at the same time hpv positivity increased 2.9 fold in the usa [ 7 ] and in europe [ 8 ] .
the incidence of oropharyngeal carcinoma predominantly increased in younger patients and in this patient collective especially in male patients , probably because of the higher prevalence of hpv in cervical than in penile tissue [ 9 , 10 ] , transmitted by orally performed sexual contact [ 10 ] .
recently , hpv detection in biopsies of head and neck cancer taken during routinely performed panendoscopy became routine practice .
on average , 23.5 % of oral cavity cancers , 24 % laryngeal , 36.5 % oropharyngeal and approximately 50 % of tonsil carcinomas are hpv positive [ 1 , 9 ] and we and others experienced that patients with hpv positive oropharyngeal cancer show a better outcome concerning response to treatment , overall and disease - free survival .
at present , no recommendations for modification of therapy exist , but there are de - escalation studies , e. g. replacing cisplatin by cetuximab in hpv positive patients [ 11 , 12 ] .
another study consists of an induction chemotherapy with docetaxel , cisplatin and 5 - fu. in the case of a response , a reduced dose of radiotherapy plus / minus chemotherapy is administered , in the case of stable or progressive disease standard radiochemotherapy is performed [ 13 , 14 ] .
in the present manuscript we present the current results of disease - specific overall survival and disease - free survival of hpv positive versus negative patients with cancer of the oropharynx treated with radiochemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy in the years 2007 - 2009 .
patients and methods the study presented in 2010 was performed as a retrospective analysis [ 9 ] .
all patients with oropharyngeal cancer who refused surgical treatment or where the tumors were locally unresectable ( t4b , non - resectable according to the uicc / ajcc classification [ 9 ]) were included in the study .
for this analysis , 88 patients with scchn were screened for hpv during routinely performed panendoscopy between 2007 and 2009 .
a hpv multiplex pcr ( polymerase chain reaction ) and an anti - hpv in situ hybridization as well as a routinely accomplished histological examination were carried out earlier [ 9 ]. of these 88 patients , 45 had their tumor localization in the oropharynx , of these 30 underwent conservative treatment comprising radiotherapy , radiochemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy .
this patient collective consisted of 18 hpv negative and 12 hpv positive patients .
one patient was excluded from the study due to a severe hiv infection .
the detection of hpv by pcr and in situ hybridization was previously published elsewhere [ 9 ] .
radiotherapy , chemotherapy and immunotherapy the regimen was published previously and therapy was decided in an interdisciplinary tumor board with respect to the patients request , performance status and comorbidities .
the radiation therapy was administered as a standard fractionation at 2 gy / fraction / day for 5 days per week to 70 gy / 35 fractions / 7 weeks or with accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost at 1.8 gy / fraction / day , 5 days / week and 1.5 gy / fraction / day to a boost field as a second daily treatment for the last 12 therapy days to 72 gy / 42 fractions / 6 weeks [ 9 ] .
in the case of radiochemotherapy , patients received cisplatin in a dosage of 100 mg / m2 every 3 weeks for the duration of radiotherapy to a cumulative dose of 300 mg / m2 .
patients who were not eligible for chemotherapy ( reduced performance status , elderly patients > 70 years , impaired renal function ) received immunotherapy consisting of cetuximab 400 mg / m2 initial dose 1 week prior to irradiation and a weekly dose of 250 mg / m2 for 7 weeks .
in three cases , patients received radiotherapy alone because of reduced performance status , age and impaired renal function .
one patient was not treated at all for cancer as treatment was refused and the patient died 3 months after the initial diagnosis [ 9 ] .
statistical analysis statistical evaluation was performed as previously described [ 9 ] but for convenience , the description will be reprinted .
kaplan - meier curves represent the survival data and differences between the curves are tested with log - rank test .
all deaths , independent of their cause , were considered as events for overall survival .
the disease - specific survival describes only deaths concerning the underlying disease and observations with deaths unrelated to disease were censored at the time of death .
for disease - free survival all recurrences of the carcinoma were considered as events [ 9 ] .
the disease - specific overall survival delineates the main outcome parameter , as second outcome parameter we considered disease - free overall survival .
all p - values are two - sided and p <= 0.05 was considered significant .
all calculations were performed with spss ( pasw statistics , new york , ny. version 21.0.0.0 ) .
results in this study 30 patients with oropharyngeal cancer including carcinomas of the tonsils and base of the tongue were treated with radiation , radiochemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy in the years 2007 - 2009 and were retrospectively evaluated .
one patient presenting with a t4 hpv positive carcinoma of the tonsils was excluded from evaluation because of a severe hiv infection and subsequent complete change of the therapeutic regimen .
the median age at time of therapy was 62 years ( range 46 - 89 years ) [ 9 ] .
the patient collective included 19 male and 10 female patients , of these 6 patients are still alive and 23 have died. of the patients who died 7 were hpv positive and 16 hpv negative [ 9 ] .
among the hpv positive patients , one patient died due to carcinoma , while six died of other causes including pneumonia , myocardial infarction , dilated cardiomyopathy and apoplectic stroke ( table 1 ). of the patients with hpv negative carcinoma of the oropharynx , 15 died of disease and 1 died because of a colon perforation while presenting evident oropharyngeal carcinoma formations .
table 1 .
causes of deaths in hpv positive versus negative patients hpv + hpv - mean age ( years , range ) 62 ( 49 - 89 ) 62 ( 46 - 82 ) male / female 9 / 2 10 / 8 cause of death apoplexy 1 - myocardial infarction 2 - general condition 1 - pneumonia 1 - cardiomyopathy 1 - colon perforation - 1 tumor - related death 1 15 alive and well 4 2 all patients received radiation in combination with immunotherapy ( cetuximab ) , chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) or radiation alone [ 9 ] .
regarding tumor stage of patients , 6 patients presented with t2 stage , 2 with t3 and 21 with t4 , while hpv positive patients collective comprised 6 with t2 , 1 with t3 and 4 with t4 and hpv negative included 1 with t3 and 17 with t4 tumors [ 9 ] .
after a period of 5 years the overall survival of all patients was not significantly enhanced in the hpv positive group ( p = 0.190 ) due to a high rate of non - disease - related deaths ( n = 6 ) ( fig. 1 ) .
after censoring the patients who died of other causes [ 9 ] , the disease - specific overall survival was calculated .
the disease - specific overall survival of patients with hpv positive oropharyngeal carcinoma was significantly better than in patients with hpv negative tumor ( p = 0.002 ) ( fig. 2 ). fig. 1 kaplan - meier curve of the overall survival ( os ) of all patients .
subsequently , the deaths not related to cancer were censored ( fig. 2 ) .

disease - specific survival of patients with hpv positive oropharyngeal cancer is significantly enhanced after 5 years ( p = 0.002 ) .
non - disease - related deaths were censored .
solid line survival of hpv positive patients , dashed line hpv negative the time to first event , recurrence of death of any cause was significantly improved in patients with hpv positive oropharyngeal cancer ( p = 0.042 ) .
after censoring non disease - related deaths of patients , the disease - free survival was highly significant ( p < 0.001 ) ( fig. 3 ). fig. 3 kaplan - meier curve of the disease - free survival ( dfs ) was highly significant in patients with hpv positive oropharyngeal carcinoma ( p < 0.001 ) .
blue line survival of hpv positive patients , green line hpv negative considering only patients with t4 tumors , they are subdivided into 4 patients with and 17 without hpv positivity .
significant differences could be observed for both disease - specific overall survival of t4 tumors ( p = 0.042 ) as well as disease - free survival ( p = 0.016 ) ( fig. 4 ). fig. 4 kaplan - meier curve of disease - free survival in patients presenting t4 tumor ( dfs in t4 ) .
dfs is enhanced in hpv positive patients ( p = 0.016 ) .
solid line survival of hpv positive patients , dashed line hpv negative the 5 - year disease - specific overall survival was 85.7 % in patients with hpv positive versus 11.1 % in hpv negative tumors .
discussion we intended to perform an update of the promising results from 2010 , 5 years after therapy of patients for hpv positive and negative oropharyngeal carcinomas .
in our manuscript presented in 2010 [ 9 ] we could describe a 1 - year disease - specific survival of hpv positive patients comprising 100 % versus hpv negative patients with 72.9 % , whereas the 2 - year overall survival was 100 % compared to 30.4 % .
both results were highly significant , at the time presenting a p - value of p = 0.015 .
the present evaluation was based on the same patient collective and a re - evaluation was performed 5 years after patients started radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy or immunotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer .
all patients were tested for hpv .
only the 29 patients evaluated in the first publication were updated at the present study , which surely limits the conclusion of our analysis as we present a small group of patients. of the patients evaluated , six patients are still alive , two of them are hpv negative and four hpv positive. of the patients 23 have died with 7 patients being hpv positive and 16 hpv negative .
the patients with hpv positive tumor died predominantly ( 6 out of 7 ) of other causes including apoplectic stroke , myocardial infarction , pneumonia and reduced performance status in a 87 - year - old woman as mentioned before and listed in table 1 .
the deaths were not documented as therapy - related deaths and none of these patients had evident disease .
only one patient with an hpv positive oropharyngeal carcinoma experienced a regional recurrence 10 months after therapy and died because of recurrence one month later .
on the other hand , 15 of 16 patients with hpv negative tumor died because of a progression of their cancer , including one patient who died of a colon ulceration but with an evident oropharyngeal local recurrence. of the patients with hpv negative tumor 9 showed progression of the disease even during therapy , 1 patient had a recurrence after 3 months , 4 after 9 months , 1 after 11 months and 3 patients had late recurrences after 21 , 37 and 67 months , respectively .
as the mean age was equivalent in both groups , the high rate of non - disease - related deaths cannot be ascribed to a higher age or more comorbidities in one group .
overall and disease - free survival were significantly better even matching t4 hpv positive and negative patients with the limitation that merely four patients with hpv positive cancer were included to the analysis .
these four patients had a t4a tumor with ( n2b - c ) and without ( n0 ) lymph node metastases .
in a recently implemented new staging system for hpv positive oropharyngeal cancer patients , they fulfil criteria for new stage iii , which is defined by t4a - b n0 - 3 [ 15 ] .
concerning the outcome , we could not find differences in patients receiving immunotherapy versus chemotherapy .
in the hpv positive patient group , seven patients received radioimmunotherapy , two patients each radiotherapy alone or radiochemotherapy .
the patients presenting with hpv negative tumors were treated with radioimmunotherapy in seven cases , radiochemotherapy in nine and radiotherapy in one case .
one remaining patient refused therapy at all .
interestingly , radiochemotherapy was administered more often in the hpv negative group in our patient collective .
nevertheless , it was a retrospective analysis and at the time of therapy no recommendations for de - escalation of therapy existed .
it has been sufficiently evidenced that patients presenting hpv positive oropharyngeal cancer show improved response to treatment and have a better disease - specific as well as disease - free survival [ 9 , 16 - 19 ] .
the 5 - year overall survival has been specified with 83 % in hpv positive versus 37 % [ 20 ] , which is comparable to our results , predominantly concerning the hpv positive patients .
as described , the 5 - year disease - specific survival was 85.7 % in hpv positive versus 11.1 % in hpv negative cancer patients in our study .
the 3 - year disease - free survival is similar with 85.7 % versus 22.2 % , respectively .
another paper observed that 90 % of their patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were hpv positive and could show a 3 - year os of 93 % and a 5 - year os of 89 % [ 21 ] .
not only the prediction of treatment response , but also the survival prognosis of patients with hpv positive oropharynx carcinoma is improved , which is additionally reflected in the minimized risk of second primaries , stated with 5.6 % in hpv positive versus 14.6 % in hpv negative cancer patients [ 22 ] .
consequentially , a reduction of therapeutic agents has to be discussed and this discussion has already started with a presentation at the american society of clinical oncology ( asco ) meeting in 2012 .
two studies with an overall reduced irradiation dose and replacement of cisplatin by cetuximab in patients with hpv positive oropharyngeal cancer have been presented [ 14 ] .
one study by mehrotra et al. reduced the dose of radiotherapy (+/ - chemotherapy ) to 66 gy in the case of complete or partial response to an induction chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel , cisplatin and 5 - floururacil .
in the group without response to treatment ( stable disease or progression ) patients received a standard radiochemotherapy [ 23 ] .
a second study ( ecog 1308 ) with induction chemotherapy ( paclitaxel , cisplatin , cetuximab ) was followed by radiation therapy with a dose of 54 gy and cetuximab only in the case of a complete response after three cycles of induction chemotherapy [ 13 ] .
patients with partial response or stable disease were conventionally treated with standard radiotherapy and cetuximab [ 13 ] .
these two studies are the first attempts to enhance patient quality of life in a distinct group of hpv positive oropharyngeal cancer patients .
as this group has customarily less common risk factors , such as tobacco and alcohol consumption , the prognosis is fairly good .
a reduced dose of radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents and an extended application of the monoclonal epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) antagonist cetuximab with a lower potential of adverse events might improve the quality of life of these cancer patients without the risk of an early recurrence .
the ecog 3311 is a phase ii trial de - escalating adjuvant radiotherapy ( 50 gy compared to 60 gy ) in the case of intermediate risk including patients with less than 1 mm extracapsular extension and 2 - 4 positive lymph node metastases or close margins [ 24 ] .
so far , there are no worldwide recommendations for reduction of therapy agents and we need to anticipate the results of the de - escalation trials to adjust the therapy for oropharyngeal cancer patients [ 26 ] .
in addition , the potential to prevent hpv related tumors , be it cervical or oropharyngeal cancer , is implicated by hpv vaccination , which is included in school vaccination programs at no charge in austria since february 2014 .
currently , a 9 - valent vaccination is applied and achieved in 60 % of girls and 40 % of boys in austria , leading to a predicted reduction of cervical cancer in 92 % , anal cancer by 83 % and should also impact on reduction of the occurrence of oropharyngeal cancer [ 25 ] .

striking disturbances have been reported in language and emotional prosody processing by patients diagnosed with schizophrenia .
in view of this and of research suggesting that schizotypal personality traits can also be expressed sub - clinically , the present study aimed to discover whether similar disturbances would be reflected in cognitive laterality patterns when symptoms of schizotypy are present yet at a non - clinical level .
a dichotic listening task was used to examine the sensitivity and speed with which 132 right - handed participants ( 85 females and 47 males , mean age = 32.44 , sd = 12.29 ) detected both words and emotional prosody , all of whom also completed the schizotypal personality questionnaire .
findings indicated that both high ( n = 64 ) and low ( n = 68 ) schizotypy groups demonstrated the typical right ear advantage for the detection of words and left ear advantage for the detection of emotional prosody .
individuals with higher schizotypal personality scores also demonstrated poorer sensitivity in detecting emotional prosody .
these results reveal that within the healthy population , higher levels of schizotypy are not associated with the atypical lateralisation of language and emotion .
nevertheless , the existence of these symptoms does signal the presence of shared characteristics with the clinical sphere , namely poorer emotion recognition performance .
keywords hemispheric laterality emotion recognition word detection schizotypal personality dichotic listening 1 introduction in healthy right - handed individuals , the left hemisphere tends to be better at processing fundamental aspects of language such as phonemes and syntax , whereas the right hemisphere specialises in the perception of emotional prosody ( bryden & macrae , 1988 ) .
however , patients suffering from psychiatric illnesses frequently demonstrate impaired performance on dichotic listening measures of hemispheric asymmetry ( sommer , ramsey , & kahn , 2001 ) .
specifically , a reduction in , or complete absence of the expected right ear advantage ( rea ) for linguistic stimuli has been observed in schizophrenia ( green , hugdahl , & mitchell , 1994 ) .
this decrease in rea has been found not to be associated with cognitive performance ( sakuma , hoff , & delisi , 1996 ) , but with positive clinical symptoms such as hallucinations ( bruder et al. , 1995 ) .
patients diagnosed with schizophrenia have also shown deficits in emotion recognition linked to reduced right hemisphere lateralisation ( ross et al. , 2001 ) .
these results have led previous researchers ( e.g. , edgar et al. , 2006 ) to maintain that atypical hemispheric asymmetries could reflect a general risk factor associated with psychiatric illness .
accumulating research has also documented the prevalence of schizotypal traits among non - clinical populations ( johns & van os , 2001 ; siever & davis , 2004 ) .
in schizotypy , for instance , which is a set of personality characteristics and experiences that indicate the degree of predisposition to schizophrenia , the role of the left hemisphere in language processing has been explored using a variety of cognitive tasks ( e.g. , overby , 1992 ; suzuki & usher , 2009 ) .
these studies have frequently revealed a left hemisphere dysfunction in high schizotypal participants similar to , but less severe than those recognised in schizophrenia .
specifically , reduced lateralisation of language , suggestive of an underactive left hemisphere , has been reported ( rawlings & borge , 1987 ; suzuki & usher , 2009 ) .
similarities with schizophrenia have also been observed in the way of a complete reversal of the expected lateralisation in favour of increased right hemisphere performance ( rawlings & claridge , 1984 ) .
schizotypal individuals have even demonstrated overactivation of the left hemisphere when processing linguistic information ( overby , 1992 ) .
whilst this slight over - activation produces superior performance , greater activation can lead to a dysfunctional state and impaired performance .
the disparity present in these findings may be attributed to the variety of stimuli utilized across the measures of lateralisation .
employing the divided visual field technique , which involves presentation of visual stimuli to either the left or right visual field , broks ( 1984 ) and suzuki and usher ( 2009 ) demonstrated reduced left hemisphere specialisation of language with consonant - vowel - consonant nonsense syllables .
operating within the same sensory modality , rawlings and claridge ( 1984 ) demonstrated a reversal of the expected left hemispheric dominance for language , in favour of superior right hemisphere performance .
this result of a right hemisphere specialisation may be due to the utilisation of letters as stimuli , which can be recognised using two strategies .
specifically , the authors suggest that two personality types might rely on different processing mechanisms , with the high schizotypy group possessing a visual processing skill ( implicating the right hemisphere ) , compared to the low schizotypy group who utilize the typical linguistic strategy ( implicating the left hemisphere ) .
despite these heterogeneous findings , it appears that commonalities exist between schizophrenia and the sub - clinical level of the schizotypal personality spectrum in the way of lateralisation for language .
these commonalities may be influenced by the number and severity of some of the symptoms experienced .
sommer and collaborators ( 2001 ) , for example , found that patients suffering from schizophrenia who had less severe hallucinatory symptoms , displayed an increased language lateralisation that pointed towards the typical laterality pattern of control subjects .
therefore , it remains to be elucidated whether the laterality patterns of non - clinical schizotypy individuals are in line with those observed in a healthy population , or those observed in patients with schizophrenia .
in an attempt to examine the contribution of both hemispheres to language processing within this population , nunn and peters ( 2001 ) employed a range of tasks that assess the linguistic abilities of both the left and right hemispheres .
findings revealed that right hemisphere dysfunction was the main predictor of high schizotypy within the non - clinical sample .
thus , it appears that in line with schizophrenia , dysfunctions of both hemispheres are present in schizotypy .
despite this right hemisphere deficit , lateralisation of emotion has seldom been studied within this population .
the paucity of research in this domain becomes even more surprising in view of numerous reports of emotion recognition impairments in schizotypy ( aguirre , sergi , & levy , 2008 ; phillips & seidman , 2008 ) .
these deficits in both facial and prosodic emotion recognition are analogous to those impairments observed in schizophrenia , which are believed to be a consequence of reduced right hemisphere lateralisation ( ross et al. , 2001 ) .
it is possible that healthy individuals experiencing schizotypy traits may also demonstrate dysfunctional emotional processing , comparable to those observed in schizophrenia ( edwards , jackson , & pattison , 2002 ) .
this is yet to be confirmed as , of those studies employing emotional recognition tasks ( e.g. , aguirre et al. , 2008 ; toomey & schuldberg , 1995 ) , the hemispheres' contribution to the processing of emotional prosody has not been examined in schizotypy .
in light of this research , it is evident that the current understanding of hemispheric responses to language and emotional prosody at the sub - clinical level of the schizotypal personality spectrum are inconclusive .
specifically , it remains unclear whether healthy individuals who may experience signs and symptoms present in schizotypal personality but do not qualify for clinical diagnosis , display the laterality patterns characteristic of healthy individuals , or resemble the atypical laterality observed within schizophrenia .
the current understanding of the left hemisphere 's role in language processing is ambiguous and findings indicate that symptomatology as well as symptom severity may influence laterality patterns ( bleich - cohen , hendler , kotler , & strous , 2009 ; sommer et al. , 2001 ) .
moreover , the right hemisphere 's role in emotional prosody processing within a non - clinical sample is still unknown .
nevertheless , findings of emotion recognition deficits in this population ( e.g. , phillips & seidman , 2008 ) , suggest that impaired emotion perception , akin to language deficits , appears to be related to unusual lateralisation .
considering the prominent contributions of each of the hemispheres to speech comprehension and in view of current findings in this area in the schizotypal personality spectrum , the need for further investigation at a sub - clinical level is warranted .
in order to re - examine language lateralisation at the sub - clinical level , while simultaneously investigating the lateralisation of emotional prosody processing , the current study employed the dichotic listening paradigm developed by bryden and macrae ( 1988 ) .
it was hypothesised that individuals who score low in schizotypal personality traits would demonstrate the expected rea for the perception of words and left ear advantage ( lea ) for the perception of emotional voice tones .
in view of the nature of schizotypal personality , combined with previous reports of atypical linguistic processing and emotional recognition deficits ; the present study aimed to determine whether the laterality patterns of high schizotypy participants reflect those characteristic of a healthy population , or those frequently reported within the clinical sphere .
2 method 2.1 participants a total of 132 healthy adults ( 47 males and 85 females ; mean age = 32.44 years , sd = 12.29 ) were recruited from nottingham trent university .
all participants reported to be native english speaking , right - handed , which was confirmed by the edinburgh inventory ( oldfield , 1971 ) , and had no hearing deficits .
additional item measures were taken to screen for and exclude any individuals that were currently suffering from , or reported any previous history of neurological conditions , psychiatric illnesses or impaired language ability .
the sample was divided into high ( n = 64 ) and low ( n = 68 ) schizotypal personality groups by the median of the total schizotypal personality questionnaire ( spq ) score ( median = 17 ; range , 1 - 46 ; see table 1 ) .
this approach allowed for the assessment of range - bound schizotypy effects and has previously been used elsewhere ( e.g. , hori , ozeki , terada , & kunugi , 2008 ; langdon & coltheart , 2004 ) .
no significant differences in demographic variables were found between the two groups , indicating equal dispersions of sex [ x2 ( 1 , n = 132 ) = 067 , p > . 05 ] and age [ t ( 119 ) = 1.48 , p > . 05 ] .
in addition , all participants were treated in accordance with the declaration of helsinki ( international committee of medical journal editors , 1991 ) .
2.2 materials 2.2.1 experimental task the auditory stimuli used within the present dichotic listening task consisted of four words (' dower ' , ' tower ' , ' power ' , and ' bower ') , each pronounced in four different emotional tones ( happy , sad , angry , and neutral ) , resulting in 16 separate word - emotion combinations .
these were spoken by an adult male and recorded using a digital recorder .
after the stimuli were obtained , they were edited to a common length of 560 ms and equalised in loudness .
originally four versions of each word - emotion combination were gathered , totalling 64 recordings .
after editing , these stimuli were presented to a group of 4 participants who were asked to report the word and emotional tone and to rate the intensity ( on a scale of 1 - 5 ) with which it was spoken. from this , the final stimuli were constructed by selecting the 16 word - emotion sound files that were most correctly identified .
to ensure that these 16 recordings were perceived accurately , an additional ten participants were asked to report each word and emotional tone .
the emotions were recognised with a minimum accuracy of 69 % ( m = 81.4 ) and words were identified with a minimum accuracy of 94 % ( m = 98.8 ) .
following confirmation of the stimuli , all potential pairings of word - emotion combinations were created , generating 144 stimulus pairs in total .
these stimuli were presented over headphones and the experiment was run on superlab software .
2.2.2 the edinburgh handedness inventory ( ehi ; oldfield , 1971 ) this 10 - item scale requires participants to specify their hand preference for 10 activities including writing , drawing , throwing , and striking a match .
participants are requested to indicate whether they predominantly use their right hand , left hand , or have no preference .
these answers are scored + 10 , - 10 , and 0 , respectively .
potential scores therefore range from - 100 ( indicating maximum left - handedness ) to + 100 ( indicating maximum right - handedness ) .
in the present study , all right - handed participants scored at least 60 or above .
2.2.3 schizotypal personality questionnaire ( spq ; raine , 1991 ) this 74 - item self - report scale with a " yes / no " response format measures schizotypy traits and features the dsm - iii - r ( american psychiatric association , 1987 ) criteria for a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder ( spd ) .
all items answered " yes " are scored 1 point .
according to raine ( 1991 ) , the spq has demonstrated high internal reliability ( cronbach 's alpha = 0.91 ) , test - retest reliability ( r = 0.82 ) , and criterion validity ( r = 0.68 between the spq and spd scores derived from diagnostic interviews ) .
2.3 procedure before hearing the dichotic pairs , participants listened to and familiarised themselves with both the verbal and emotional characteristics of the 16 word - emotion stimuli .
a practice session then allowed them to gain experience of the task while receiving feedback on whether responses made were correct or incorrect .
the dichotic listening experiment followed ( bryden & macrae , 1988 ) .
participants were presented with a target word or target emotion on screen at the start of a block of 144 trials and were instructed to monitor for that target .
the word targets were ' tower ' and ' dower ' and the emotion targets were ' happy ' and ' angry ' .
participants monitored each of these targets for one complete block , thus there were four blocks of 144 trials totalling 576 trials .
during each block the target was present on 50 % of the trials ; 25 % in the right ear and 25 % in the left ear .
during a trial , participants heard two sounds simultaneously ; one in the right ear and one in the left .
following this stimuli presentation , they indicated if they heard the target in either ear by pressing the green ( present ) or red ( absent ) keys of the computer 's response pad .
the hand that was used to respond and the target presentation order were both counterbalanced .
to allow a space between stimulus presentations , a pause of 700 ms was introduced after individuals responded and before the next sound appeared .
a reminder of the target was also presented on the computer screen after every 18 trials .
participants were informed that the aim was to respond as quickly and accurately as possible .
following completion of the experiment , the spq and ehi were administered .
2.4 statistical analysis the current study had a mixed design with two within - subject variables : task ( focus on word , focus on emotion ) and ear ( left ear , right ear ) in addition to one between - subjects variable : schizotypal personality group , spq ( high schizotypal personality , low schizotypal personality ) .
before conducting the statistical analyses , the average number of hits ( i.e. , correct detections ) , false alarms ( i.e. , identifying a target as present when it was absent ) , and reaction times for hits were computed for each condition .
hit and false alarm rates were employed to calculate d ' ; a signal detection measure of sensitivity that controls for participants' response bias .
following this , and after univariate assumption testing was complete , a main analysis of variance ( anova ) was conducted for each one of the two dependent variables ; sensitivity ( d ') and reaction time .
any significant effects were then followed up with post hoc t - tests where appropriate .
3 results 3.1 d ' analysis analysis of sensitivity data demonstrated a significant task x ear interaction [ f ( 1 , 130 ) = 249.16 , p < . 001 , etap2 = . 657 ] .
a partial eta squared ( etap2 ) of . 657 indicated that the strength of this relation was large based on cohen 's ( 1988 ) recommendation that small , medium , and large effects are reported as . 01 , . 06 , and . 14 , respectively .
the interaction itself showed that participants performed better when words were delivered to the right ear rather than to the left as depicted in fig. 1 and confirmed by post hoc tests [ t ( 132 ) = - 10.21 , p < . 001 , etap2 = . 443 ] .
t - tests also revealed that participants were more accurate in detecting emotions that were delivered to their left , rather than to their right ear [ t ( 132 ) = 8.07 , p < . 001 , etap2 = . 332 ] .
task x ear x spq did not approach significance , indicating that this typical pattern of laterality was observed across both schizotypy groups [ f ( 1 , 130 ) = . 08 , p > . 05 , etap2 = . 001 , see table 2 ] .
a significant main effect of spq [ f ( 1 , 130 ) = 8.05 , p = . 005 , etap2 = . 058 ] indicated that discrimination differences exist between the two groups .
the low schizotypy group demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting targets overall [ m = 2.15 , sd = . 631 ] compared to the high schizotypy group [ m = 1.93 , sd = . 615 ] .
thus , although the high schizotypal personality group displayed typical laterality patterns , its discrimination ability was reduced in relation to the low group .
a significant task x spq interaction [ f ( 1 , 130 ) = 4.19 , p = . 043 , etap2 = . 031 ] revealed that the low schizotypy group had better discrimination on the ' emotion ' task than the high schizotypy group [ t ( 130 ) = 2.85 , p = . 005 , etap2 = . 059 ] ( see fig. 2 ) .
the partial eta squared reinforces that the magnitude of the difference in mean scores between the groups was small to moderate .
in contrast , no significant differences were found between the groups in the ability to accurately detect word targets [ t ( 130 ) = 1.22 , p > . 05 , etap2 = . 011 ] .
the low schizotypal personality group also demonstrated more accurate discrimination for ' emotion ' targets than ' word ' targets [ t ( 67 ) = - 2.66 , p = . 010 , etap2 = . 095 ] , whereas the high schizotypy group showed no differences on the performance of these tasks [ t ( 63 ) = . 418 , p > . 05 , etap2 = . 002 ] .
3.2 reaction time analysis the analysis of mean reaction time mirrored the significant task x ear interaction and the large magnitude of effects [ f ( 1 , 130 ) = 62.38 , p < . 001 , etap2 = . 324 ] that were observed in the accuracy data ( see fig. 3 ) .
specifically , reaction times were faster for word targets presented to the right ear [ t ( 131 ) = 5.47 , p < . 001 , etap2 = . 186 ] , and for emotion targets presented to the left ear [ t ( 131 ) = - 4.58 , p < . 001 , etap2 = . 138 ] .
a significant main effect of task was also found [ f ( 1 , 130 ) = 101.90 , p < . 001 , etap2 = . 439 ] , signifying faster responses on the word recognition task ( m = 838.30 , sd = 153.67 ) than on the emotion task ( m = 965.67 , sd = 196.30 ) .
there were no main effects or interactions involving spq on reaction time data .
in line with the accuracy findings , this indicated that the typical laterality pattern was evident across both high and low schizotypy groups .
however , in contrast to the sensitivity data , no significant differences emerged in reaction time between the two groups when they were compared across tasks .
therefore , whereas the low schizotypy group was significantly more accurate at detecting emotions than the high schizotypy group , both groups performed similarly on the amount of time required to detect these targets .
4 discussion in light of mounting evidence suggesting commonalities between schizophrenia and schizotypy ( siever & davis , 2004 ) , the primary aim of the current study was to investigate the lateralisation of cerebral responses to words and emotional prosody at the sub - clinical level of the schizotypal personality spectrum .
as predicted , healthy individuals with low schizotypal personality scores demonstrated the typical pattern of hemispheric lateralisation on measures of sensitivity and reaction time .
this pattern , specifically a rea for the detection of words and a lea for the detection of emotional prosody , was also observed in individuals who reported higher levels of schizotypy traits .
therefore , atypical hemispheric asymmetry ; evident in both schizophrenia and spd , does not seem to be present at the sub - clinical level of the schizotypy spectrum when using the method and analytic approach used in this study .
despite findings of healthy lateralisation patterns across the sample , sensitivity data did reveal differences in performance between the two groups .
in comparison to low scorers , the high schizotypy group exhibited impaired detection of emotional prosody .
this suggests that whilst atypical laterality is not a dominant feature of this population , disturbances in emotion recognition do manifest at the high end of the sub - clinical level of the schizotypal personality spectrum .
the demonstration of a left hemisphere specialisation for word detection across measures of sensitivity and reaction time is consistent with , and replicates previous research that has also documented the linguistic proficiency of this hemisphere ( josse & tzourio - mazoyer , 2004 ) .
overall , the results did not indicate atypical lateralisation of language ; a pattern of hemispheric functioning frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia ( bleich - cohen , hendler , kotler , & strous , 2009 ) .
this is probably due to the severity of symptoms in the low and high spq groups .
sommer and collaborators ( 2001 ) , for example , demonstrated that symptom severity is crucial in determining the extent of anomalous laterality in schizophrenia , with patients who experience more severe symptoms , demonstrating a more atypical pattern of lateralisation .
as the present study examined schizotypy at the non - clinical level , it is likely that symptoms at this stage are not severe enough to produce dysfunctional left hemisphere activity .
however , previous studies that have also explored language processing at the non - clinical level of schizotypy have yielded mixed results .
many of which , contrary to the present study , have demonstrated atypical language lateralisation in high schizotypal participants , similar to , but less severe than those observed in schizophrenia ( broks , claridge , matheson , & hargreaves , 1984 ; overby , 1992 ; rawlings & borge , 1987 ) .
thus , differences in the level of symptoms may not be sufficient in explaining the differences in lateralisation patterns .
a more sophisticated explanation for the discrepancies in findings may be attributable to the specific types of symptoms experienced across the samples .
green and colleagues ( 1994 ) argued that in schizophrenia , hallucinations , as opposed to psychotic symptoms in general , are the specific trait that produce impaired performance on dichotic listening measures .
the authors propose that this is a result of the left hemisphere attending to inner speech and voices during auditory hallucinations .
further evidence of the significant role that positive symptoms such as hallucinations play in producing atypical laterality was demonstrated by conn and posey ( 2000 ) , who used the dichotic listening paradigm to compare the performance of healthy college students who report verbal hallucinations with college students who report no previous history of this .
the authors confirmed that only participants who had reported experiencing auditory hallucinations demonstrated impaired performance , specifically for the detection of words , and thus indicative of left hemisphere dysfunction .
the present study tested healthy individuals at the non - clinical level of the schizotypy spectrum who were unlikely to experience hallucinatory symptoms and thus did not demonstrate abnormal lateralisation .
in contrast to the collection of research examining language laterality , this was the first known study to explore hemispheric responses to emotional prosody in non - clinical schizotypy .
in line with previous emotion recognition research within this population ( aguirre et al. , 2008 ; phillips & seidman , 2008 ) , reduced sensitivity for the detection of emotional prosody was observed within the high schizotypal personality group .
as most examinations of emotion perception abilities in schizotypy and schizophrenia tend to focus predominantly on facial affect ( toomey & schuldberg , 1995 ) , this highlights the importance of investigating prosody , as it appears that impaired emotion recognition is not limited solely to facial affect .
most importantly , however , was the finding of typical right hemisphere specialisation for the detection of emotional tones across the sensitivity and reaction time data .
this indicates that poorer sensitivity for detecting emotional prosody in the high schizotypal personality group cannot be attributed to atypical performance of the right hemisphere .
the right hemisphere superiority was observed for both positively and negatively valenced words .
this better overall performance of the right hemisphere favours the so called ' right hemisphere hypothesis' ( borod et al. , 1998 ) over the rival ' valence hypothesis ' , which proposes that the right hemisphere is specialised solely for negative emotions and that positive emotions are processed in the left cerebral hemisphere ( reuter - lorenz & davidson , 1981 ) .
premkumar and collaborators ( 2011 ) go still further in the study of emotional processing by identifying activational differences between low and high schizotypy in the bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , right superior frontal gyrus , and left ventral prefrontal cortex when focusing on social rejection as a particular emotion .
however , the present study had a couple of potential limitations that should be noted in generalising from its findings .
first , the dichotic listening paradigm used to test hemispheric lateralisation is not nearly as reliable as the wada test ( woermann et al. , 2003 ) , which is taken to be the " gold standard " technique for language lateralisation .
however , the wada test ( intracarotid amobarbital hemispheric sedation ) has the disadvantage of its invasiveness and the possibility of clinical complications .
additionally , the spq range of the sample used in this study , although similar to previous studies ( e.g. , langdon & coltheart , 2004 ) , was relatively low compared to the maximum spq range indicated by raine ( 1991 ) .
this highlights the importance of conducting further research in a more representative community sample .
taken as a whole , the current findings provide support for the notion that schizotypal personality symptoms are distributed , to varying degrees , throughout the general population of healthy individuals .
it can be confirmed that , at a non - clinical level , the presence of these symptoms do not give rise to the atypical lateralisation of language and emotion that is frequently observed within spd and schizophrenia .
whilst atypical laterality is not a dominant feature of this population , disturbances in emotion recognition do manifest at the high end of the sub - clinical level of the schizotypal personality spectrum .
this denotes that overlapping characteristics with the clinical sphere do exist .
as the present study provided the first examination into the lateralisation of emotional prosody within this population , it may shed additional light on previous research by confirming that findings of impairments in emotion recognition abilities are unlikely to be a consequence of a right hemisphere abnormality .

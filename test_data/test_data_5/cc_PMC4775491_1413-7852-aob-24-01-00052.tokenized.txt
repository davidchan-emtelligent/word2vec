jan - feb 2016 24 1 52 54 19 8 2014 05 8 2015 this is an open - access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license abstract to evaluate the efficacy of viscosupplementation in patients with osteoarthritis of the ankle .
a systematic review to evaluate the evidence in the literature on the use of viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the ankle .
for this review , we considered blind randomized prospective studies involving the use of viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the ankle .
a total of 1,961 articles were identified in various databases .
after examining each of the articles , five articles were included in this review .
treatment with intraarticular hyaluronic acid is a safe treatment modality that significantly improves functional scores of patients , with no evidence of superiority in relation to other conservative treatments .
further clinical trials with larger numbers of patients are needed so that we can recommend its use and address unanswered questions .
systematic review of randomized clinical trials .

introduction osteoarthritis ( oa ) is the most prevalent rheumatic disease among people over 65 years of age .
1 the disease can have an impact on different aspects of patients' life including social activities , relationships , body self - image and emotional well - being .
2 , 3 according to the center for disease control and prevention of the united states , the current direct and indirect annual estimated cost for the treatment of oa is us $ 86.2 billion and in 2030 the disease will affect about 63 million americans .
4 several factors can influence the onset and progression of oa , such as age , changes in metabolism , genetic and hormone factors , biomechanical changes and articular inflammatory processes .
1 , 5 primary osteoarthritis of the ankle is rare , most commonly secondary to fracture or ligament chronic instability .
6 in recent years there has been , both in brazil and worldwide , increased incidence of post - traumatic and inflammatory osteoarthritis of the ankle .
7 when clinically evident , oa is characterized by joint pain , limitation of movement , crepitus , occasional effusion , and various degree of inflammation without systemic variables .
8 the traditional conservative treatment for ankle oa includes simple analgesics , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaid ) , intra - articular corticosteroid injections , physical therapy , physical activity and weight reduction .
1 , 9 new alternatives for surgical treatment have been developed , however , despite the improvement in ankle arthroplasty results , joint arthrodesis is still considered the gold standard for treatment in cases of failure of conservative treatment .
10 nevertheless , the burden on surrounding joints and the resulting sequelae , with consequent deterioration of the patient 's functional quality after tibiotarsal arthrodesis , support the search for alternative therapies .
11 the concept of viscosupplementation was developed in the 60s by bazals et al. , 12 but only by the end of the 80s it has been used for treatment of knee oa in italy and japan .
13 hyaluronic acid has both viscous and elastic properties .
the degree to which each feature predominates depends on load conditions .
this allows the synovial fluid the unique ability to function differently depending on the amount of shear force applied .
14 although widely used for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis , evidence for its usefulness in ankle osteoarthritis is limited .
15 the purpose of the present review was to assess whether there is data in the literature to support the indication of viscosupplementation for the conservative treatment of ankle osteoarthritis .
methods prospective randomized blind trials involving the use of viscosupplementation for ankle osteoarthritis were considered for this systematic review .
studies involving patients of all ages and both genders , with tibiotalar joint osteoarthritis ( radiologically and clinically defined ) were included and the outcomes pain and functional performance were evaluated .
the searches for articles were conducted in the following electronic databases : medline ( 1966 to may 20 , 2014 ) ; embase ( 1988 to may 20 , 2014 ) , cochrane database of systematic reviews ( 1988 to may 20 , 2014 ) .
the descriptors used were : " ankle " , " osteoarthritis " , " viscosupplementation " and " hyaluronic acid " .
the references of the selected studies were also analyzed in the search for papers that could have been lost in the electronic search .
to minimize errors and reduce the potential bias , the search was conducted independently by two researchers .
disagreements were resolved by group discussion between authors .
the selection was made through the title and abstract to identify potentially relevant articles for analysis .
when the title , keywords , and abstract proved insufficient information to determine their suitability for inclusion , analysis of full articles was carried out .
to evaluate the internal quality of the papers we used the criteria described by jadad et al .
16 such analysis considers randomization , blinding of participants and loss of follow - up or exclusions .
the maximum score is five points and a study is considered poor if it receives a score equal to or lower than three .
results a total of 1,961 articles in different databases were identified .
analysis of the title and abstracts allowed the exclusion of 1,940 articles for not being prospective , randomized and blinded studies .
another 13 papers were excluded due to duplication .
therefore , seven articles remained with appropriate methodology for inclusion in the systematic review .
however , a study from salk et al .
17 , 18 was published in two different journals and only one paper that presented a better description of the methodology was , then , included .
17 the analysis of the articles full text led to the exclusion of another article due to lack of groups randomization .
therefore , five articles were included in the review , with a total population of 170 patients .
( figure 1 ) figure 1 research flow chart. of the five articles evaluated , three of them compared the use of viscosupplementation with control using saline .
17 , 19 , 20 the fourth study compared four different viscosupplementation regimens ( single dose of 1 , 2 or 3ml of hyaluronic acid and a fourth group with a 1ml / week for three weeks ) .
the fifth study evaluated the use of hyaluronic acid with exercise therapy .
22 the characteristics of the selected studies are shown in chart 1 .

the technique employed to carry out the infiltration varied according to the literature .
the anteromedial approach was described by salk et al .
17 and witteveen et al. , 21 preceded by local subcutaneous anesthesia .
karatosun et al .
22 and cohen et al .
20 do not report whether the route used was anteromedial or lateral , while degroot et al .
19 reported using them both , without , however , defining the criteria used for choosing between the different techniques or whether there were different patient outcomes .
degroot 19 and cohen et al .
20 reported the use of fluoroscopy .
the results of the studies that used saline as control evaluated different clinical outcomes .
cohen et al .
20 chose as the primary outcome the ankle osteoarthritis score ( aos ) in four periods ( second and sixth weeks and three and six months ) .
improvement was reported in both groups , greater in all evaluations of patients undergoing viscosupplementation , but with statistically significant difference only in the third month .
degroot et al .
19 used the american orthopaedic foot and ankle score ( aofas ) with primary outcome and aos as secondary at the sixth and twelfth weeks .
in patients receiving viscosupplementation there was improvement on both scores compared to the pre - treatment period , but only aofas was statistically significant .
in the control group there was significant improvement only in the twelfth week , considering the aos score .
there was no significant difference between the groups in any of the evaluations .
salk et al .
17 used the analysis of aos score at three and six months as a primary endpoint .
in both groups there was an improvement compared to baseline , but with no significant difference between them .
karatosun et al .
22 compared the intra - articular hyaluronic acid with exercise - based therapy .
in both groups improvement in aofas ankle - hindfoot score was identified at 12 months of follow - up , but with no statistically significant difference between groups .
witteveen et al .
21 attempted to determine the best viscosupplementation scheme comparing the use of 1 , 2 or 3ml in one single dose or weekly doses of 1 ml for three weeks .
they concluded that there was an improvement in the four groups , with better results in the group submitted to three infiltrations .
all studies reported low complication rate , none of them was considered serious .
discussion the viscosupplementation with intra - articular hyaluronic acid was approved in the us in 1997 and the american college of rheumatology guidelines contemplate its use for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis since the year 2000 .
23 , 24 in 2008 the osteoarthritis research society international included articular hyaluronic acid therapy as a modality with extended benefits for the treatment of patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis .
25 despite over a decade of clinical use , the literature still reports few studies on its use in the ankle joint .
after extensive search we found only five articles with level 1 evidence , and four of these had low internal quality .
the low level of evidence of studies on viscosupplementation is also observed in publications about foot and ankle surgery on other topics ; there has not been over the past decade significant improvement in the studies' quality .
26 several techniques can be employed to increase the accuracy of infiltration such as ultrasound ( us ) , fluoroscopy , and computed tomography ( ct ) .
27 , 28 nevertheless , the relationship between greater effectiveness of the infiltration procedure and better clinical outcomes require further studies .
29 in the articles selected for this study , we observed that all authors have chosen the anterior approach and two of them used fluoroscopy .
we have not found evidence in the literature that fluoroscopy provides benefits to patients undergoing viscosupplementation in the ankle ; this issue remains to be addressed in the future .
the initial objective of the authors was to perform a meta - analysis of selected works .
but due to heterogeneity in study design it was not possible to perform statistical analysis .
current evidence suggests that viscosupplementation for ankle osteoarthritis treatment is a safe and effective method , but without proven clinical superiority compared to other conservative treatment measures .
moreover , there is no data indicating which groups of patients benefit from this therapy , which is the best treatment regimen , the best technique to perform the procedure and the role of imaging techniques ( us , ct , fluoroscopy ) .
final considerations treatment with intra - articular hyaluronic acid is a safe therapeutic modality , which promotes a significant improvement of patients' functional scores , with no evidence of superiority over other conservative treatment measures .
new clinical trials with larger number of patients are needed prior to its recommendation , in order to answer remaining open questions .

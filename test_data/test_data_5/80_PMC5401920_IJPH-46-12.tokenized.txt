background : the current study was conducted to estimate the integrated mean of quality of life ( qol ) of the general population of different countries around the world and to compare them on the grounds of the human development index ( hdi ) .
methods : well - known international databases such as medline , scopus , science direct , google scholar & google , and domestic databases including sid , iranmedex , irandoc & magiran were searched in 2015 .
the data were analyzed with the random effect model , using stata 11 software .
results : ninety - seven studies were selected for the final analysis .
the overall qol mean in the very high hdi subgroup was 74.26 ( ci = 72.40 - 76.12 ) , which was the highest value .
the lowest mean score was observed in the psychological domain ( m = 67.37 ; ci = 66.23 - 68.52 ) .
in the high hdi subgroup , the highest mean was observed in the social relationships domain ( m = 64.16 ; ci = 61.99 - 66.34 ) , and the lowest mean was observed in the environment domain ( m = 58.76 ; ci = 56.50 - 61.03 ) .
in the medium hdi subgroup , the highest mean was calculated for the overall qol score ( m = 62.62 ; ci = 56.35 - 68.92 ) , and the lowest mean was estimated for the environment domain ( m = 56.98 ; ci = 53.54 - 60.43 ) .
the highest mean in the low hdi subgroup was observed in the physical health domain ( m = 68.17 ; ci = 67.43 - 70.52 ) , and the lowest mean was calculated for the environment domain ( m = 53.14 ; ci = 51.57 - 54.72 ) .
there was considerable heterogeneity in all the subgroups and domains ; the values reported here are the weighted means of qol for different countries .
conclusion : overall , the highest means of various qol domains were observed in the very high hdi subgroup .
quality of life ( qol ) human development index ( hdi ) general population meta - analysis introduction nowadays , the measurement and assessment of quality of life among the general population have become one of the main activities of public health research .
the results of these studies are utilized in resource allocation decision - making relevant to health promotion and well - being ( 1 ) .
generally , quality of life has no definite and universal definition , although people instinctively understand its meaning , but the concept is not the same among them ( 2 ) .
most experts consider qol as a subjective and dynamic concept .
subjective means the individual 's own opinions must be obtained , and dynamic means changes with time ; therefore , it must be measured for a period .
on the other hand , subjective measurement is necessary , but not sufficient , and that each of the qol domains should have the ability to be measured both subjectively and objectively ( 2 ) .
according to the definition of world health organization ( who ) , quality of life is people 's concept of their positions in life from the perspective of the culture and evaluative system in which they live , and the goals , expectations , standards and priorities that they have .
the factors that affect individuals' concepts of qol are physical health , psychological status , level of independence , social relationships , personal beliefs and environmental characteristics ( 3 ) .
qol somewhat describes the status of the people living in a country or region , and is nowadays considered an acceptable theoretical framework for examining the living conditions of different societies .
in addition to economic issues , qol affects the statuses of a society 's individuals , taking into account exogenous factors such as infrastructures , social organizations , social relationships , environment etc .
( 4 ) .
information on qol of the general population of a given country can provide basic data for assessing interventions ( 5 ) .
the whoqol - bref questionnaire is a multicultural qol assessment tool that consists of four broad domains , physical health , psychological health , social relationships and environmental health , and another two questions that evaluate the overall qol and general health status ( 6 - 8 ) .
this questionnaire has been translated and validated into over 40 languages around the world ( 7 ) .
the human development index ( hdi ) was introduced in 1990 as a new index for measuring development in different communities .
this index is based on the basic idea that the prerequisite of achieving a better life , in addition to having a high income , is the flourishing and development of human talents and capacities ( 9 ) .
the hdi is a composite index for assessing the success achieved by a given country in three key dimensions of human development : a long and healthy life , access to knowledge , and a decent standard of living ( 10 ) .
hdi is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions , calculated using the following : life expectancy , expected years of schooling ( of children ) , mean years of schooling ( the average numbers of years of education received by the population aged >= 25 yr in a country - without the years repeated ) ; the gross national income per capita ( gni ) ( which is the average income of the citizens of a country - in dollars - and is calculated by dividing the entire income of a country - in dollars - by the population of that country ) ( 11 ) .
each year , the united nations development program ( undp ) publishes an annual report in which the hdi of all the countries have been calculated and ranked in comparison to the others in that given year ( 11 ) .
the calculated hdi is a number between zero and one. through this index , the undp classifies the countries around the world into four groups : countries with a very high hdi ( hdi >= 0.8 ) ; countries with a high hdi ( 0.8 > hdi >= 0.7 ) ; countries with a medium hdi ( 0.7 > hdi >= 5.5 ) ; and countries with a low hdi ( hdi <= 5.5 ) ( 11 , 12 ) .
there is no published study on the association between hdi and qol among general population of different countries .
the current study was conducted to explore the mentioned association for hypothesis generation materials and methods source of data this study was a systematic review conducted on qol of general populations of different countries around the world in the past 10 years , with an emphasis on hdi .
to collect the required data , articles and thesis , the following keywords were used : quality of life , who 's quality of life instrument , whoqol - bref , and a combination of these keywords .
international databases such as medline , scopus , science direct , pro - quest , google scholar & google , and domestic databases including sid , iranmedex , irandoc & magiran were searched .
in order to find additional relevant articles , we scanned the reference lists of all retrieved studies .
in addition , we contacted authors of retrieved studies for additional unpublished studies .
inclusion criteria all the articles and thesis published between the years 2004 & 2014 applied the whoqol - bref questionnaire to assess qol among the general population - irrespective of language of publication and we have 24 non - english publications .
studies not conducted on general populations , on the latter but not reported the mean qol , insufficient data , and whose inaccessible full texts were excluded .
thus , 4796 articles relevant to qol were found .
among these , 2265 articles were removed because of being duplicates , and 2378 articles because of their irrelevancy ( upon examining the topics and abstracts ) .
a hundred and fifty - three articles remained , out of 56 removed for having inadequate data ( upon reading the full - texts ) .
eventually , 97 articles of appropriate quality were systematically reviewed ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 : flowchart depicting the stages of entry of studies into the systematic review & meta - analysis the whoqol - bref questionnaire the whoqol - bref questionnaire is a multi - lingual , multicultural instrument designed to evaluate qol .
it consists of 26 items extracted from the whoqol - 100 questionnaire .
it has four domains , physical health ( 7 questions ) ; psychological health ( 6 questions ) ; social relationships ( 3 questions ) ; environmental health ( 8 questions ) ; and two more questions that assess the overall qol and health status ( 6 - 8 ) .
in this questionnaire , the physical health domain covers items such as activities of daily living , fatigue & energy , pain & sorrow , working capacity , sleep & rest , motor strength , dependence on drugs , and medical goals .
the psychological domain covers the individual 's image of his / her bodily appearance , negative feelings , positive feelings , self - confidence , thoughts , learning , memory , ability to concentrate , religion , beliefs , and sexual activity .
the environment domain examines items such as financial resources , freedom & physical safety , social & health care , the physical environment of the living place , existing opportunities for gaining new skills & information , leisure opportunities , physical environment ( noise pollution , air pollution , etc. ) and transport ( 5 ) .
after performing the necessary calculations for each domain , scores ranging from 4 - 20 result ; 20 indicating the best and 4 indicating the worst status of qol in the respective domain .
these scores can be converted into scores within a range of 0 - 100 .
this questionnaire has been translated and validated into over 40 languages worldwide , and is still in progress ( 7 ) .
this questionnaire has been translated and standardized in iran , too ; upon test - retest after two weeks an intraclass correlation of 0.75 - 0.84 was obtained for all the four domains , which indicates its reliability .
furthermore , cronbach 's alpha and indices relevant to construct validity indicate the desirable validity of the tool in the iranian population ( 13 ) .
assessing the quality of studies the quality of studies was assessed with the strobe checklist , which is a standard checklist .
using this checklist , we assessed the reporting of the following items : type ; time and setting the demographic characteristics of the individuals under study ; the inclusion and exclusion criteria ; method of measurement of variables ; the statistical methods applied ; standard deviations and confidence intervals of the estimates .
upon examining the aforementioned items , the studies were classified into three groups : slightly biased and of high quality ( 100 % adherence to the strobe criteria ) , moderately biased and of average quality ( adherence to at least 85 % of the strobe criteria ) , highly biased and of low quality ( adherence to at least 70 % of the strobe criteria ) .
data extraction the data of the articles included in the systematic review were extracted using a previously developed checklist .
most of the studies' data were extracted based on gender .
this checklist included the study title , publication date , study setting , first author 's name , sample size ( based on gender ) , the overall mean & standard deviation ( sd ) of qol , mean & sd of the physical health domain , mean & sd of the psychological health domain , mean & sd of the social relationships domain , and , mean & sd of the environmental health domain .
statistical analysis since the qol domains' means & standard errors had been reported with different scorings in different studies , they were transformed to the 0 - 100 scale using the transformation formula before the meta - analysis began .
we did not examine publication bias , because our objectives for this systematic review were descriptive in the descriptive studies the publication of the articles is not affected by the low or high prevalence ( 14 ) .
we examined the heterogeneity of the studies with the chi2 test and the i2 & t2 indices .
bearing in mind the considerable heterogeneity between studies , the random effect model has been used with caution in combining the study results .
here , we needed an integrated mean to compare the hdi subgroups , thus , the meta - analysis was conducted through a random approach .
however , the latter indicator was only considered as a weighted mean of the domain scores , and not in estimating qol in the countries of those subgroups ( 15 , 16 ) .
in this study , we used the data presented in the undp hdi report of 2014 .
accordingly , the countries included in the report have been classified into four subgroups : very high hdi ( hdi >= 0.8 ) ; high hdi ( 0.8 > hdi >= 0.7 ) ; medium hdi ( 0.7 > hdi >= 5.5 ) ; and low hdi ( hdi <= 5.5 )) 11 ) .
the data were analyzed with stata 11 software .
moreover , to prove the significance of the association between the mean qol scores and hdi , the p - value of the wald test was calculated using meta - regression in which the overall qol mean and its domains were entered as dependent variables , and the hdi was entered as the independent variable .
results the number of individuals participating in the studies was 100214 , with a mean age of 46.59 +/ - 3.68 yr. based on heterogeneity test results , the chi2 test was significant for all the subgroups .
the i2 index also indicated > 90 % heterogeneity in all the subgroups .
the qol weighted mean in each hdi subgroup was estimated through the random effect model ( table 1 ) .

based on the results of the subgroups' analysis in table 1 , the overall qol score had the highest integrated mean in the very high hdi subgroup ( m = 74.26 ) .
the means of the physical , environment and social domains ensued , and the lowest mean score was observed in the psychological domain ( m = 67.37 ) .
in the high hdi subgroup , the highest mean was observed in the social relationships domain ( m = 64.16 ) .
the next highest means were observed in the overall qol , physical and psychological domains .
the lowest mean was observed in the environment domain ( m = 58.76 ) .
in the medium hdi subgroup , the highest mean was calculated for the overall qol score ( m = 62.62 ) , followed by the means of the physical , social and psychological domains .
the lowest mean was estimated for the environment domain ( m = 56.98 ) .
the highest mean in the low hdi subgroup was observed in the physical health domain ( m = 68.17 ) , followed by the means of the psychological , social and overall qol .
the lowest mean was calculated for the environment domain ( m = 53.14 ) .
the highest mean for the overall qol - based on the hdi - was observed in the very high hdi subgroup ( m = 74.26 ) , followed by the low and high hdi subgroups .
the medium hdi subgroup had the lowest overall qol mean ( m = 62.62 ) .
hence , regardless of the low hdi in the other subgroups , a positive association was observed between the hdi and the overall qol , such that an increase in the hdi was associated with an increase in the overall qol score ( p < 0.001 ) .
in the physical health domain , countries with very high hdi gained the highest mean for the physical health domain ( m = 70.06 ) , and the countries with medium hdi garnered the lowest mean ( m = 62.26 ) .
in this domain too , apart from the low hdi subgroup , a direct association was observed between the physical health mean and hdi ; an increase in hdi was associated with an increase in the physical health mean ( p < 0.001 ) .
in the psychological domain , the highest qol mean ( m = 67.37 ) was observed in countries with very high hdi and the lowest mean ( m = 58.25 ) was observed in the countries with medium hdi .
in this domain too , apart from the low hdi subgroup , a direct association was observed between the psychological domain 's mean and hdi ; an increase in hdi was associated with an increase in the mean ( p < 0.001 ) .
in the social relationships domain , countries with very high hdi gained the highest qol mean ( m = 69.88 ) , followed by countries with low and high hdi .
the lowest mean ( m = 62.06 ) was observed in the medium hdi subgroup .
in this domain too , apart from the low hdi subgroup , a direct association was observed between the social relationships' mean and hdi ; an increase in hdi was associated with an increase in the mean ( p < 0.001 ) .
in the environment domain , unlike the other domains , a directly positive association was observed between the countries' qol and hdi .
the very high hdi subgroup had the highest qol mean in the environment domain ( m = 70.05 ) , followed by the high hdi and medium hdi subgroups .
the low hdi subgroup had the lowest environment mean ( m = 56.98 ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
discussion in the current study , despite the considerable heterogeneity , the random effect model was applied to combine the study results and to estimate the integrated mean for comparing the hdi subgroups .
here , we used the random effect model to estimate the integrated mean of qol and its hdi - based domains , and observed the highest integrated means to be in the very high hdi subgroup .
the overall qol was the highest ( m = 74.26 ; ci = 72.40 - 76.12 ) in the very high hdi subgroup , and the lowest integrated mean ( m = 67.37 ; ci = 66.23 - 68.52 ) was calculated for the psychological domain in the high hdi subgroup .
overall , our results indicate a positive association between qol and hdi .
the low hdi subgroup excluded , the mean scores directly increased with an increase in hdi in the remaining hdi subgroups in the physical health , psychological , social relationships and overall qol domains .
a direct positive association with the hdi subgroups was observed only in the environment domain .
the high overall qol mean observed in the low hdi subgroup may be attributed to the small number of articles in this subgroup , led to the insignificance of the heterogeneity test and resulted in the zero value of the i2 and t2 indices .
few studies have been conducted on the association between qol and hdi ( 17 ) .
totally , 11801 persons aged 12 - 97 yr from 23 countries studied , with the goal of investigating qol , educational status and hdi , using the whoqol - bref ( 17 ) .
eventually , 9404 persons from 13 countries were investigated because of the completeness of their data .
the results showed a good overall qol mean ; the social relationships and environment domains exhibited the highest and lowest means , respectively , findings that are consistent with ours .
furthermore , although the social qol was good in all the countries and no difference was observed between two hdi groups , developing countries and those with lower hdi ( the medium hdi subgroup ) exhibited lower qol in the physical , psychological and environment domains when compared to developed countries and those with higher hdi .
these findings too , are consistent with our results ( 17 ) .
once again , using the whoqol - bref , the association between human development and qol in brazil , on 182 individuals aged over 60 yr , from three different cities of the state of sao paulo ( city a - with the highest hdi , city b , & city c - with the lowest hdi ) .
the results of this study differed from ours , such that no significant difference was observed between the cities' overall qol mean scores .
however , significant associations were observed between the social and environment domains of qol and hdi .
in line with our findings , the best qol results of these two domains were found among the residents of cities a & b , which had the highest hdi , as opposed to city c - which had the lowest hdi ( 18 ) .
another study in brazil , on 48 individuals from belo horizonte ( with a high hdi = 0.828 ) and 29 individuals from montes claros ( with a medium hdi = 0.691 ) .
the participants had experienced the stroke in the last three years of their lives .
qol was assessed with the sf - 36 questionnaire .
in spite of the differences in hdi , no significant difference was observed between the qol of the cities , findings that do not conform to ours ( 19 ) .
one of the limitations of our study was the high and considerable heterogeneity observed among the studies , which made the combination of studies impossible even with the random effect model .
nonetheless , this method was applied in light of the goals of the study - which meant to utilize the results in health policy making .
thus , the random effect model was used to combine the studies and to compare them with each other to estimate the weighted qol means in different subgroups ( 20 ) .
another limitation was that these 97 studies were related to only 32 countries around the world ; the data relevant to the qol of other countries were not available .
the small number of studies in the low hdi subgroup is another limitation .
nevertheless , bearing in mind the type of indicator under study , although the number is small , we could imagine similar countries to have similar conditions , and therefore , use the results to predict the status of other countries as well .
conclusion we can present an overall estimate of qol and its domains among the general populations around the world to prove beneficial in health planning .
moreover , we may compare the qol of different hdi subgroups .
hdi can be used as a predictor of qol .
thus , efforts must be aimed at promoting the hdi determinants .
in this respect , the level of health should be promoted to increase life expectancy , improve educational status , and raise monthly incomes in various countries .

summary obligate acidophilic members of the thaumarchaeotal genus candidatus nitrosotalea play an important role in nitrification in acidic soils , but their evolutionary and physiological adaptations to acidic environments are still poorly understood , with only a single member of this genus ( ca. n. devanaterra ) having its genome sequenced .
in this study , we sequenced the genomes of two additional cultured ca. nitrosotalea strains , extracted an almost complete ca. nitrosotalea metagenome - assembled genome from an acidic fen , and performed comparative genomics of the four ca. nitrosotalea genomes with 19 other archaeal ammonia oxidiser genomes .
average nucleotide and amino acid identities revealed that the four ca. nitrosotalea strains represent separate species within the genus .
the four ca. nitrosotalea genomes contained a core set of 103 orthologous gene families absent from all other ammonia - oxidizing archaea and , for most of these gene families , expression could be demonstrated in laboratory culture or the environment via proteomic or metatranscriptomic analyses respectively .
phylogenetic analyses indicated that four of these core gene families were acquired by the ca. nitrosotalea common ancestor via horizontal gene transfer from acidophilic representatives of euryarchaeota .
we hypothesize that gene exchange with these acidophiles contributed to the competitive success of the ca. nitrosotalea lineage in acidic environments .

nitrification in soil is generally limited by the initial oxidation of ammonia to nitrite , in which archaeal ammonia oxidisers play a significant role ( e.g. , lu et al. , 2015 ; hink et al. , 2017 ) .
net rates of nitrification do not show a strong correlation with soil ph and some of the highest rates are found in acidic soils ( ph < 5 ) ( booth et al. , 2005 ) , which comprise approximately 30 % of all soils ( von uexkull and mutert , 1995 ) .
surveys of 16s rrna and ammonia monooxygenase subunit a ( amoa ) genes demonstrate that ammonia oxidising archaea ( aoa ) are distributed globally in soils , with ph being an important driver of both community composition and adaptation ( gubry - rangin et al. , 2011 ; gubry - rangin et al. , 2015 ; vico oton et al. , 2016 ) .
genome - wide prediction of the functional adaptation of ammonia oxidising thaumarchaeota to low ph has thus far been limited to the genome of the soil isolate candidatus nitrosotalea devanaterra ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) .
this genomic analysis identified potential mechanisms for substrate acquisition and ph homeostasis in acidic environments that present potential constraints for ammonia oxidisers .
the concentration of nh3 , the most likely substrate for bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenases , is significantly reduced at ph values below 7 , as the pk a for the nh4 + < - > nh3 equilibrium is 9.25 .
decreasing ph also moves the no2 - < - > hno2 equilibrium toward inhibitory nitrous acid , which is highly reactive , with breakdown products that can cause extensive cellular damage .
in addition , growth at low ph requires mechanisms for ph homeostasis , to maintain the transmembrane proton gradient required for atp production and normal function of cellular processes .
genome and cell membrane analyses indicated that such mechanisms might exist in ca. n. devanaterra , including cation uptake , cytoplasmic buffering and a cell membrane composition distinct from that of neutrophilic aoa ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) .
in addition , amt - type nh4 + transporters are predicted to be encoded by all sequenced aoa genomes ( including ca. n. devanaterra ) and are distinct from rh - type nh3 transporters found in some ammonia oxidising bacteria ( aob ) ( offre et al. , 2014 ; lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) .
ammonia or ammonium is required for both energy generation and nitrogen assimilation by ammonia oxidisers , and the preference of ca. n. devanaterra ( and other aoa ) for transporting nh4 + may contribute to its ability to grow in acidic environments containing limiting concentrations of nh3 .
in this context , it is interesting to note that the recently isolated acid - adapted ( growth in the range of ph 5 - 7.5 ) gammaproteobacterial aob ca. nitrosoglobus terrae does not encode known transporters for nh4 + or nh3 and might , thus , rely on passive diffusion of ammonia through its membrane for assimilation ( hayatsu et al. , 2017 ) .
while the genome of ca. n. devanaterra has allowed the generation of hypotheses regarding mechanisms facilitating its unique physiology , the absence of further acidophilic archaeal ammonia oxidiser genomes made it difficult to confirm these findings .
the aim of this study was to gain a greater understanding of the function and origin of the genes potentially involved in acidophilic adaptation in the ca. genus nitrosotalea through comparative genomics by including three newly determined genomes from this genus , and to learn whether these genes are expressed under natural and / or cultivation conditions .
specifically , this study aimed to reveal ( 1 ) the ( compositional ) similarity of genomes within ca. nitrosotalea and with those of other aoa ; ( 2 ) the size and predicted function of the ca. nitrosotalea core genome compared to that of other aoa genera ; ( 3 ) whether the ca. nitrosotalea core genome is expressed ; and ( 4 ) the evolutionary origin ( s ) of gene families that comprise the ca. nitrosotalea core genome .
results expanded genomic representation of candidatus nitrosotalea in this study , the genomes from two cultured strains of ca. nitrosotalea , strain nd2 ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2014 ) and strain cs ( jung et al. , 2014 ) , were sequenced .
in addition , a ca. nitrosotalea metagenome - assembled genome ( strain sbt1 ) was recovered from an acidic fen , anaerobic , stable isotope probing experiment ( pester et al. , 2012 ; hausmann et al. , 2016 ) ( supporting information 1 and fig. s1 ) .
molecular evidence for four candidatus nitrosotalea species the 16s ribosomal rna gene sequences of the four ca. nitrosotalea strains exceed 99 % nucleotide identity to one another and are thus not useful for elucidating precise taxonomic relationships among these strains ( yarza et al. , 2014 ) .
genomes of the four strains were therefore compared by determining average amino acid and nucleotide identities ( aai and ani ; fig. 1 ) .
aai between the four genomes were 79 % - 83 % with > 80 % of genes aligned , suggesting they represent different species of the same genus ( luo et al. , 2014 ) .
likewise , ani values between the four genomes were 78 % - 83 % , far below the proposed species delineation boundaries of 95 % - 97 % ( goris et al. , 2007 ; varghese et al. , 2015 ) .
therefore , we propose that each of the four analysed strains represents a separate species within the ca. nitrosotalea genus .
figure 1 heat maps showing pairwise ani and aai values inferred from the four ca. nitrosotalea genomes ( bold ) and other available thaumarchaeota genomes .
dendrograms were calculated by hierarchical clustering ( hclust , method = complete linkage ) in r with distances calculated as ( 100 % - % identity , that is , 100 % ani = 0 distance ) .
for ani and aai , values above 70 % and 60 % , respectively , are indicated on the heat map .
[ colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ] phylogenomic relationship of candidatus nitrosotalea with other aoa in single gene trees based on 16s rrna ( supporting information fig. s2a ) and amoa ( supporting information fig. s2b ) genes , the four ca. nitrosotalea species formed a monophyletic sister group to group 1.1a thaumarchaeota ( ca. nitrosopumilus , ca. nitrosoarchaeum and ca. nitrosotenuis ) , consistent with previous placements of this genus ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2011 ; pester et al. , 2012 ; vico oton et al. , 2016 ) .
for more refined analyses , two concatenated sets of marker genes ( a ' universal ' marker set consisting of 34 genes ( parks et al. , 2015 ) and a set of 198 single - copy genes that are phylogenetically congruent among all aoa , see supporting information table si.2.1 ) were also used to infer the phylogenetic relationship of the four ca. nitrosotalea species with other fully sequenced aoa genomes .
again , ca. nitrosotalea was consistently recovered as a monophyletic sister group to group 1.1a , distinct from 1.1b taxa ( nitrososphaera , ca. nitrosocosmicus ; bayesian p > 0.999 and bootstrap support = 1 ; fig. 2 and supporting information fig. s2c ) .
the only major disagreement between these two trees is in the branching order of lineages represented by ca. cenarchaeum symbiosum and ca. nitrosopelagicus brevis ( fig. 2 and supporting information fig. s2c ) .
as both lineages are currently represented by a single member , addition of sister taxa to these two relatively long - branch taxa may help resolve the disagreement .

[ colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ] thaumarchaeota and candidatus nitrosotalea core genomes the quality of the sampled genomes and the phylogenetic breadth of groups used for comparison strongly influence core genome analyses .
genome completeness , open reading frame predictions and aai - based grouping of genomes were therefore considered a priori in the description of core genomes .
genome completeness , assessed by two methods , was high (> 92 %) for all 23 aoa genomes ( table 1 ) but many contain pathway gaps , likely to be artefacts of different gene - calling approaches .
gene - calling was therefore repeated for all aoa genomes using prodigal ( hyatt et al. , 2010 ) and resulted in a much larger core genome shared by all 23 aoa ( 640 and 743 using gene calls from genbank and de novo gene calls made by prodigal respectively ) .
prodigal gene calls were thus used in subsequent analyses .
aai between genomes varied extensively within and between groups ( fig. 1 ) .
the range of proposed genus - level cut - offs for aai ( 60 % - 80 % ; luo et al. , 2014 ) is inconsistent with the currently used aoa taxonomy .
for instance , at 60 % aai ca. nitrosotenuis , ca. nitrosopumilus , ca. nitrosopelagicus and ca. nitrosoarchaeum would form a single genus , at 70 % aai , nitrososphaera would be split into two genera , while ca. nitrosopumilus and ca. nitrosoarchaeum would form a single genus .
at 80 % nitrososphaera , ca. nitrosopumilus and ca. nitrosotenuis would split into multiple genera .
this information was considered when comparing genus - specific core gene sets ( see below ) .

predicted genes from the 23 aoa genomes ( including the four ca. nitrosotalea genomes ) were clustered into 11,655 orthologous gene families using orthomcl ( li et al. , 2003 ) , of which 4,868 gene families were unique to single taxa and 743 were found in all genomes , forming a thaumarchaeotal core genome ( supporting information 1 and table si.2.1 ) .
as expected , this number is lower than the 860 core genome gene families of thaumarchaeota recently reported by kerou et al .
( 2016 ) reflecting our inclusion of more genomes and use of different cut - off values and algorithms. of the 743 gene families of the thaumarchaeotal core genome determined in this study , 697 were also retrieved by kerou et al .
( supporting information table si.2.2 ). ca. nitrosotalea genes were present in 2,902 gene families , almost half of which ( 1,363 ) were common to all four ca. nitrosotalea genomes .
the ca. nitrosotalea - specific core genome comprised 103 orthologous gene families restricted within the thaumarchaeota to ca. nitrosotalea ( supporting information 1 and table si.2.3 ) .
this was lower than the respective nitrososphaera - specific core genome , whether including ca. n. gargensis ( 331 gene families ) or excluding it ( 333 gene families ) due to low shared aai with other members of this genus .
their larger core genome likely reflects the greater genome size of genus nitrososphaera members .
the ca. nitrosotalea - specific core is , however , much larger than that of group 1.1a aoa ( supporting information table si.2.1 ) , contrasting with only 10 , 23 and 40 gene families for the ca. nitrosopumilus - specific core , the ca. nitrosoarchaeum - specific core and the combined ca. nitrosopumilus / ca. nitrosoarchaeum - specific core respectively .
to account for sampling bias in core - genome definitions , aai was used to select combinations of four dissimilar ca. nitrosopumilus / ca. nitrosoarchaeum genomes to mimic the diversity of ca. nitrosotalea .
this resulted in a maximum of 28 ca. nitrosopumilus / ca. nitrosoarchaeum - specific core gene families .
origin of gene families in the candidatus nitrosotalea - specific core genome the potential evolutionary origin of the 103 orthologous gene families ( comprising 420 genes ) identified as the ' ca. nitrosotalea - specific core ' was examined based on phylogenetic tree topology - based inference. of these 103 gene families , seven shared homology with gene families present in non - aoa microbes but not in other aoa ; 38 showed little or no homology (< 30 % amino acid identity ) to any other gene families in other aoa or to any other sequences in the ncbi genbank nr protein database ; 12 returned only one to three low scoring ( 30 % - 45 % amino acid identity ) hits in blast - based searches , preventing further phylogenetic analysis ; and 46 shared homology with other gene families in thaumarchaeota (> 30 % amino acid similarity between members of each gene family ) .
these 46 gene families were nevertheless inferred to be ca. nitrosotalea - specific in the orthomcl - based approach because the pairwise similarity and connectivity between the members of each gene family was insufficient to assign them confidently to common orthologous groups with other aoa ( table 2 ) .
in manually examined phylogenetic trees ( not shown ) , all but one of this subset of 46 ca. nitrosotalea - specific core gene families branch with other aoa .
phylogenetic reconstructions for eight gene families ( one with homology in other aoas and seven absent from other aoas ) , suggested hgt events involving a common ancestor of the ca. nitrosotalea ( table 2 and supporting information figs s3 - s10 ) .
five of these hgt events affected gene families of potential importance for the acidophilic lifestyle of these aoa by playing a putative role in metal transport , detoxification or protection from stress .
four of the gene families share a common ancestor with acidophilic archaea ( table 2 ) .

expression of the candidatus nitrosotalea core genome proteomics and metatranscriptomics were used to assess which ca. nitrosotalea - specific core genes are expressed .
proteomic analysis of ca. nitrosotalea strains nd2 and cs , cultivated at optimal ph , identified 65 % ( 1,227 proteins ) and 13 % ( 308 proteins ) of all predicted proteins respectively ( supporting information tables si.2.1 and si.2.4 ) .
this confirmed expression of 62 of the 103 ca. nitrosotalea core gene families , four of which were horizontally acquired by a common ancestor of ca. nitrosotalea ( table 2 and supporting information table si.2.1 ) .
metatranscriptomics data from the acidic fen , from which the ca. nitrosotalea strain sbt1 was assembled , confirmed transcription of 79 of the 103 ca. nitrosotalea - specific core gene families , including seven of the gene families that were acquired via hgt , four of which were also identified through proteomics ( table 2 and supporting information tables si.2.1 and si.2.5 ) .
discussion the four acidophilic thaumarchaeotal strains investigated in this study consistently form a monophyletic group branching as a sister clade to the group i.1a thaumarchaeota in phylogenetic trees based on amoa gene , 16s rrna gene and two concatenated gene sets ( fig. 2 and supporting information fig. s2c ) .
ani and aai values clearly illustrate that the four strains are separate species .
due to their phylogeny and their high aai values among each other , we assigned the four species to the ca. genus nitrosotalea and propose the following names for them : ca. nitrosotalea bavarica sbt1 , ca. nitrosotalea okcheonensis cs and ca. nitrosotalea sinensis nd2 .
as ca. nitrosotalea occupies a unique low - ph niche among cultivated thaumarchaeota , the genomes of the four ca. nitrosotalea species were mined for gene families that they share to the exclusion of all other thaumarchaeota , to identify candidate gene families that may be associated with their acidophilic lifestyle .
in total 103 gene families were assigned to this ' ca. nitrosotalea - specific core ' , almost half of which ( 50 ) are novel or too divergent for confident determination of function or origin .
another 46 families share homology with other thaumarchaeota genes , despite being assigned to the ca. nitrosotalea specific core group .
this is not surprising , given that a graph - based orthologue definition will separate genes with homology if they are sufficiently different from one other , but strongly connected internally .
it is possible that some of the gene families shared between all ca. nitrosotalea and other thaumarchaeotes facilitate life at low ph , with specific protein evolutionary adaptation , as previously observed for the ammonia monooxygenase protein ( macqueen and gubry - rangin , 2016 ) .
careful phylogenetic analysis of the ca. nitrosotalea - specific core gene families provided strong evidence that eight were affected by hgt events .
for six of these gene families , ca. nitrosotalea genes clustered with homologues from non - aoa archaeal phyla while two clustered with homologues from bacteria ( supporting information figs s3 - s10 ) .
interestingly , four hgt events ( ogs 2531 , 2888 , 2932 and 2933 ) occurred with members of the thermoplasmatales and in one case possibly also with acidophilic crenarchaeota .
the thermoplasmatales is an order within the euryarchaeota that comprises acidophiles growing preferentially below ph 2 and that also encompasses members of the genus picrophilus growing at around ph 0 , representing the most acidophilic microbes described ( huber and stetter , 2006 ) .
for seven of the eight horizontally exchanged gene families , expression in culture and / or in situ could be confirmed ( table 2 ) , suggesting their functional importance .
a previously published analysis of the ca. n. devanaterra nd1 genome identified 51 candidate genes of importance for its acidophilic lifestyle ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) .
the analyses presented here now shows that a surprisingly low number ( n = 10 ) of these genes are also present in all three newly determined ca. nitrosotalea genomes and absent in all other nonacidophilic aoa ( table 3 and supporting information table si.2.6 ) .
this is unlikely a result from lack of genome closure , as estimated genome completeness for all four ca. nitrosotalea was high ( 96.6 % - 100 %) .
therefore , the ca. nitrosotalea - specific core genome likely lacks some of the typical mechanisms of ph homeostasis described in acidophiles ( baker - austin and dopson , 2007 ) .
for example , the kdp potassium transporter ( ec 3.6.3.12 ) of n. devanaterra is found in only two of the four ca. nitrosotalea genomes .
this is unexpected as potassium is considered a critically important solute in extreme acidophiles , responsible for generating the reverse membrane potential and its absence implies that representatives of this genus either have a novel unrecognized mechanism for potassium uptake or use other cations to generate a reverse membrane potential .
in contrast to a previous hypothesis ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) , the carbonic anhydrase ( ec 4.2.1.1 ) of ca. n. devanaterra nd1 is not suitable for intracellular consumption of protons as it , like the respective homologues in other thaumarchaeota , has an n - terminal signal peptide , indicating an extracellular localization ( kerou et al. , 2016 ) .
these gamma - class carbonic anhydrase ( ca ) homologs likely facilitate carbon transfer into the cell by converting bicarbonate to co2 , which can subsequently diffuse through the cell membrane .
at an intracellular ph of 7 , co2 will be rehydrated to bicarbonate and used for carbon fixation .
as members of the ca. nitrosotalea thrive in very low ph soils containing much more co2 than bicarbonate , extracellular carbonic anhydrases are not necessary .

in total , 51 genes were identified by that procedure .
this table shows that only 10 of these genes are present in all four ca. nitrosotalea genomes and have no homologues in other non - acidophilic thaumarchaeotes .
in addition , four of the previously identified genes are present in all four ca. nitrosotalea genomes and in the aoa ca. nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 .
interestingly , a specific subset of gene families thought to play a role in adaptation to low ph in ca. n. devanaterra nd1 are exclusively shared among aoa between the four ca. nitrosotalea genomes and ca. nitrosocosmicus oleophilus my3 , an aoa that can grow between ph 5.5 and 8.5 ( jung et al. , 2014 ) ( table 3 ) .
for instance , all five genomes encode electroneutral cpa1 - type ( cation / proton antiporter ) na +/ h + antiporters ( tc 2.a.36 ) that were postulated to be involved in ph homeostasis in ca. nitrosotalea .
in contrast , all neutrophilic aoa , including ca. n. oleophilus my3 , possess electrogenic cpa2 - type na +/ h + exchangers ( tc 2.a.37 ) ( padan et al. , 2005 ) that are absent in genus ca. nitrosotalea ( og0030 , og0824 ) .
it has previously been demonstrated that cpa1 - type transporters export protons and are downregulated at alkaline ph ( calinescu et al. , 2014 ) , while cpa2 - type transporters are downregulated at acidic ph ( alkoby et al. , 2014 ) , although it is not clear whether this distinction applies to all cpa1 - and cpa2 - type exchangers .
likewise , subunits of the membrane - bound domain and central and peripheral stalks of the a - type atp synthase of ca. nitrosotalea and ca. n. oleophilus my3 ( ec 3.6.3.14 ) were dissimilar (< 30 % aa identity ) to other aoa .
the functional implications of this divergence are currently unknown .
in contrast , the cytoplasmic domain ( a1 ) ( atpab ) of the atp synthase is conserved in all aoa , including ca. nitrosotalea genomes .
the direction of proton transport by a - type atp synthase is reversible ( gruber et al. , 2014 ) , and , thus , the modified atp synthase may be involved in proton extrusion in the genus ca. nitrosotalea .
this would necessitate a dual role in atp synthesis and proton export since the a - type atp synthase is the only atp synthase encoded in the genomes of ca. nitrosotalea. ca. nitrosotalea core gene families acquired through horizontal gene transfer five of the ca. nitrosotalea - specific core gene families affected by hgt might play important roles in the acidophilic lifestyle of these thaumarchaeota ( table 2 ) , suggesting that horizontal gene acquisition was important for their adaptation to low ph environments .
first , one of the gene families exchanged with members of the thermoplasmatales is a na +/ solute symporter ( og2888 ) ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) and is present in many bacterial and archaeal acidophiles .
characterized members of the na +/ solute symporter family ( tc 2.a.21 ) take up a wide range of organic solutes , including amino acids , sugars and monocarboxylates and dicarboxylates ( jung , 2002 ; groeneveld et al. , 2010 ) .
amino acid alignment suggests that the na +/ solute symporters of ca. nitrosotalea lack the sodium binding site ( data not shown ) and the phylogenetic placement of the four ca. nitrosotalea species transporters with characterized homologues consistently recovers a robust relationship to mctp of r. leguminosarum , a proton - coupled monocarboxylic acid symporter ( supporting information fig. s11 ) ( hosie et al. , 2002 ; jung , 2002 ) .
this implies proton - rather than sodium - coupled symport .
uptake of organic compounds seems paradoxical because the three cultivated ca. nitrosotalea strains grow autotrophically in inorganic media .
however , there is evidence for stimulation of ca. nitrosotalea growth by some organic acids , for example , oxaloacetate ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2014 ) .
while we can only speculate on the function of this protein , its conservation in ca. nitrosotalea core genome , its consistent presence in other archaeal acidophiles , and its absence from all other aoa makes it a strong candidate for future characterization and determination of the substrate specificity together with its role in acidophily .
two more genes of the horizontally transferred ca. nitrosotalea - specific core encode metal transporters ( og2531 and og2924 ) .
while og2531 is a member of the zinc - iron permease ( zip ) family and can be annotated with high confidence as a zn2 + importer , og2924 is a member of the divalent cation transporter nramp ( tc 2.a.55 ) family found in many acidophiles for which substrate predictions are not possible without experiments .
the gene families og2531 and og2924 were horizontally exchanged with members of the thermoplasmatales and woesearchaeota respectively .
we postulate that these metal transporters provide adaptation for metal uptake under low ph conditions , where the bioavailability of metals is strongly increased ( violante et al. , 2010 ) and transporters with different properties ( e.g. , a lower affinity ) might be beneficial .
interestingly , all other genome - sequenced aoa also encode a zip transporter ( not closely related and likely replaced by the laterally acquired zip in ca. nitrosotalea , data not shown ) .
in most aoa , this transporter is located immediately adjacent to the multicopper oxidase 1 ( mco 1 ) , which has recently been hypothesized as an interesting candidate for thaumarchaeotal hydroxylamine oxidation ( kerou et al. , 2016 ) .
interestingly , however , mco 1 is absent from all four ca. nitrosotalea species .
a fourth gene that has been laterally exchanged between ca. nitrosotalea and other archaea , belonging to the methanosarcinales , is a fkbp - type peptidyl - prolyl cis - trans isomerase gene ( og2943 ) encoding a folding chaperone for proteins containing proline residues .
while classified within the ca. nitrosotalea - specific core , distantly related fkbp - type peptidyl - prolyl cis - trans isomerases are also found in neutrophilic aoa , indicating that not all folding chaperones are confined to aoa with an acidophilic lifestyle .
although homologues of og2943 have not been linked specifically to acidophily in other organisms , chaperones in general are prevalent in acidophilic genomes and upregulated during ph down - shift ( baker - austin and dopson , 2007 ) .
finally , a fmn - dependent nadh - azoreductase ( ec 1.7.1.6 ; og2912 ) that has been exchanged with members of the recently proposed bacterial candidate phylum ' dependentiae ' ( yeoh et al. , 2016 ) is present in all analysed ca. nitrosotalea species and may function in detoxification of reactive nitrogen compounds ( nakanishi et al. , 2001 ; ryan et al. , 2010 ) .
diazo compounds may be formed by reaction between amine side groups with reactive nitrogen ( e.g. , nitrous acid , hydroxylamine ) , which is particularly important at low ph , although they have been reported to occur rarely naturally ( nawrat and moody , 2011 ) .
species - specific features of individual ca. nitrosotalea genomes several unexpected species - specific genes were observed in the newly determined ca. nitrosotalea genomes .
for example , ca. nitrosotalea bavarica sbt1 harbours an archaeal ( type iii ) rubisco ( scthaumv1 _ 33063 ) implicated in co2 fixation , although other key calvin cycle genes ( e.g. , phosphoribulokinase ) are missing .
this gene may function in the amp salvage pathway as described for hot spring thaumarchaeota ( beam et al. , 2014 ) , particularly as another gene of the same pathway , encoding an amp phosphorylase ( scthaumv1 _ 33062 ) , is located adjacent to the rubisco - encoding gene .
in other archaea , for example , pyrococcus furiosus , excess amp can be generated through saccharolytic activity , but ca. n. bavarica sbt1 contains no adp - dependent phosphofructokinase homologue or other recognisable adp - dependent sugar kinases .
as proposed for thermococcus kodakaraensis ( sato et al. , 2007 ) , amp may be produced instead through degradation of 5 - phosphoribosyl 1 - pyrophosphate ( prpp ) by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase ( scthaum _ 10121 ) , which is also encoded in other thaumarchaeota .
prpp is produced in thaumarchaeota by ribose - phosphate pyrophosphokinase ( scthaum _ 90122 ) , as part of nucleotide biosynthesis and can also spontaneously break down into ribose - 1,5 - bp. this could then be converted into ribulose 1,5 - bisphosphate by ribose 1,5 - bisphosphate isomerase of ca. n. bavarica sbt1 ( scthaum _ 70401 ) , providing a substrate for the rubisco , as demonstrated in the methanogenic archaeon m. jannaschii ( finn and robert tabita , 2004 ) , linking the pentose phosphate pathway and gluconeogenesis .
although ca. n. bavarica sbt1 has the homologue of ribose - 1,5 - bisphosphate isomerase found in m. jannaschii ( mj0601 ) ( finn and robert tabita , 2004 ) , related proteins are also implicated in thiazole metabolism ( hwang et al. , 2014 ) , and the function of the protein and the existence of this pathway in ca. n. bavarica sbt1 needs to be verified experimentally , when a cultured member of this species becomes available .
ni - fe hydrogenase , gas vacuoles , genes for flagellar motility and chemotaxis and phosphate utilization genes are also encoded by some but not all genomes of ca. nitrosotalea ( supporting information table si.2.7 ) , providing testable hypotheses for adaptations of ca. nitrosotalea strains to factors other than ph. interestingly , the ca. n. okcheonensis cs genome has two amoa gene copies in contrast to all previously genome - sequenced aoa , which have a single amoa gene .
one copy ( ncs _ 11555 ) was found in the canonical arrangement amoaxcb , as in other ca. nitrosotalea genomes , and is transcribed during growth in batch culture ( supporting information 1 ) .
the second copy ( ncs _ 11033 ) , which is located > 400 kb upstream from the amoaxcb gene cluster , shares 95.5 % dna similarity with the first , but was not transcriptionally active under standard growth conditions ( supporting information fig. s12 ) .
the local genomic region surrounding each amoa gene was confirmed by pcr amplification using primers designed to hybridize to adjacent orfs .
multiple copies of the amocab operon can be found in aob , and additional isolated copies of amoc can be found in both aoa and aob ( spang et al. , 2012 ) .
in addition , two divergent copies of amob were recently reported in the marine aoa ca. n. piranensis d3c ( bayer et al. , 2016 ) .
the isolated amoc gene in nitrosomonas europaea is not transcribed during growth , but only during a poststarvation stress response ( berube and stahl , 2012 ) .
it is difficult to predict if , and under which conditions , the genomically isolated amoa gene of ca. n. okcheonensis cs is transcribed , but its existence has immediate implications for molecular studies of aoa in the environment .
the amoa gene is the most widely used marker for determining aoa and aob diversity and abundance in environmental samples and the existence of two nonidentical copies of this gene may lead to overestimation of aoa diversity and abundance , given the common assumption of one amoa gene per aoa genome ( trias et al. , 2012 ) .
in conclusion , comparative genomics of four ca. nitrosotalea species enabled identification of a core set of gene families for this genus encompassing 103 gene families .
expression of the majority of these genes families was confirmed by proteomics under laboratory conditions and metatranscriptomics in an incubation experiment with acidic peat soil .
although the four analysed ca. nitrosotalea species all thrive at low ph , their genomic core excluded many gene families that were previously proposed to represent adaptations of ca. n. devanaterra nd1 to acidic environments ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) .
interestingly , some of the core genes with an inferred function for acidophily were clearly acquired by ca. nitrosotalea via horizontal gene transfer from other microbial groups , including the acidophilic thermoplasmatales , demonstrating that adaptation of ca. nitrosotalea members to their low ph environment was facilitated by implementation of mechanisms having evolved in other microbes of these systems .
it will be interesting to explore whether similar mechanisms for ph adaptation are also used by other ( non - ca. nitrosotalea ) thaumarchaeotal lineages that are abundant in acidic soils ( gubry - rangin et al. , 2011 ) , but for which no genome sequences are yet available .
experimental procedures thaumarchaeotal genomes genomes of four members of the genus ca. nitrosotalea , abundant in acidic soils , were compared in this study .
three of the genomes originated from pure cultures or enrichments : ca. nitrosotalea devanaterra nd1 was isolated from a scottish agricultural soil ( ph 4.5 ) and its complete genome was recently sequenced ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2016 ) , ca. nitrosotalea sinensis nd2 was isolated from a chinese acidic paddy soil ( ph 4.7 ) ( lehtovirta - morley et al. , 2014 ) and ca. nitrosotalea okcheonensis cs was enriched from a korean soil ( ph 3.2 ) contaminated with acid mine drainage water ( jung et al. , 2014 ) .
details of the cultivation , dna extraction ( bramwell et al. , 1995 ) , genome sequencing and assembly are given in supporting information .
in contrast , the genome of ca. nitrosotalea bavarica strain sbt1 was assembled and binned ( albertsen et al. , 2013 ) from a metagenomic dataset of the minerotrophic fen schloppnerbrunnen ii ( 50degrees07'54.8 '' n , 11degrees52'51.8 '' e , 713 m above sea level , typical ph 4 - 5 ) , located in the fichtelgebirge mountains in north - eastern bavaria , germany ( herrmann et al. , 2012 ; pester et al. , 2012 ; hausmann et al. , 2016 ) .
for further details on this metagenomic experiment see supporting information 1 and hausmann et al .
( 2016 ) .
in addition to the four ca. nitrosotalea genomes , 19 other thaumarchaeotal genomes were compared ( table 1 ) .
for all 23 genomes , genome composition completeness was estimated using thaumarchaeotal - based arcog markers ( rinke et al. , 2014 ; supporting information table si.2.8 ) and checkm ( parks et al. , 2015 ) , while genus and species assignments were evaluated using ani and aai ( richter and rossello - mora , 2009 ; konstantinidis and tiedje , 2005 ) ( see details in supporting information 1 ) .
comparative genomics the core and flexible genomes of ca. nitrosotalea were identified using the microscope platform for annotation ( vallenet et al. , 2009 ) and orthomcl ( li et al. , 2003 ) , which uses a markov cluster algorithm to assign coding sequences to orthologous groups based on all - against - all blastp ( supporting information table si.2.9 ) .
the core genome for aoa was defined as all orthologue groups for which all aoa had at least one coding sequence .
accordingly , the core genome of specific genera of aoa ( e.g. , ca. nitrosotalea ) was defined as all orthologue groups for which all members had at least one coding sequence and no other aoa possessed a corresponding orthologue .
the flexible genome was defined as orthologue groups which contained coding sequences from multiple aoa , but not from all aoa .
theoretical core genome and pangenome sizes were estimated ( contreras - moreira & vinuesa , 2013 ; supporting information 1 ) , while genomic synteny was calculated between all ca. nitrosotalea genomes ( kurtz et al. , 2004 ; supporting information 1 and fig. s13 ) .
origin of individual gene families comprising the candidatus nitrosotalea core genome gene families that comprised the core genome of ca. nitrosotalea were examined to identify possible origin scenarios .
each gene was used as a query in a blastp search against the genbank nr protein database using default parameters , except returning up to 1,000 subjects for each query .
all hits that matched at least one query over 70 % of its length and with > 30 % identity were collected as ' database homologues' ( table 1 ). from this set of database homologues , usearch ( edgar , 2010 ) was used to cluster database entries at 95 % amino acid identity .
centroids were aligned using mafft ( katoh and standley , 2013 ) and preliminary trees were constructed using fasttree ( price et al. , 2009 ) .
gene families were classified as ' ca. nitrosotalea - specific ' if no database entries outside the known ca. nitrosotalea was identified with blastp .
gene families were classified as ' ca. nitrosotalea - specific with low aa - identity to non - aoa ' if there were only one to three database matches at low identity ( 30 % - 45 % amino acid identity ) .
the remainder of the gene families of the ca. nitrosotalea core genome were examined phylogenetically .
if a gene family formed a clade with other thaumarchaeota , it was assumed to be a divergent form of the homologue in other thaumarchaeota .
phylogenetic trees were recalculated using raxml ( stamatakis , 2015 ) for the remaining gene families , to verify the relationship of the ca. nitrosotalea gene family with its nearest phylogenetic neighbour ( s ) , which was inferred to be the donor lineage of that gene family to a ca. nitrosotalea common ancestor .
phylogenomic and phylogenetic approaches two independent phylogenomic approaches were implemented , maximum - likelihood ( stamatakis , 2015 ) on 198 phylogenetically congruent single - copy marker genes ( fig. 2 ) or bayesian - likelihood ( lartillot et al. , 2009 ) on 34 universal marker genes subset identified with checkm ( supporting information fig. s2c ) ( parks et al. , 2015 ) .
in addition , the 16s rrna ( supporting information fig. s2a ) and amoa ( supporting information fig. s2b ) gene bayesian phylogenies were performed as described in gubry - rangin et al .
( 2015 ) .
more details on these approaches can be found in supporting information 1 .
experimental validation of in silico predictions to confirm the presence of two amoa genes ( orf11033 and 11555 ) in ca. n. okcheonensis cs and generate qpcr standards for expression analysis , pcr primers were designed that hybridized at positions within adjacent predicted orfs ( 11032 / 11034 and 11554 / 11556 ) , with a further set of primers that hybridized within orf11033 and orf11555 to amplify mrna transcripts ( supporting information table si.2.10 ) .
total rna was extracted from cells harvested from 500 ml of an exponentially growing culture using the rneasy mini kit ( qiagen , germany ) and cdna synthesized using the superscript first strand synthesis system ( invitrogen , san diego , ca ) according to manufacturer 's instructions .
concentrations of rna and cdna were determined using an nd - 1000 spectrophotometer ( nanodrop technologies , wilmington , de ) .
quantitative real - time pcr experiments were carried out using a miniopticon real - time pcr detection system ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca ) and opticon monitor software version 3.1 ( bio - rad laboratories , hercules , ca ) .
thermal cycling parameters were 15 min at 95degreesc , followed by 40 cycles at 95degreesc for 20 s , 55degreesc for 20 s and 72degreesc for 20 s , with readings recorded after each cycle .
a control 16s rrna gene assay was also performed as described previously ( jung et al. , 2014 ) .
pcr efficiency was 87 % - 95 % with r 2 values >= 0.99 for all assays .
genomic in silico predictions in ca. nitrosotalea strains were validated by analysing the proteomic profiles of two of the three cultured thaumarchaeotal strains after growth under optimal conditions ( ph = 5.3 and 5.0 for ca. n. sinensis nd2 and ca. n. okcheonensis cs respectively ) .
cells from seven replicate cultures ( 1,000 ml and 500 ml each for strains nd2 and cs respectively ) were harvested individually by filtration and stored at - 80degreesc upon protein extraction with denaturing sds buffer and proteomic analysis by lc - ms ( see supporting information 1 ) .
genomic in silico predictions in ca. nitrosotalea strains were validated by metatranscriptomics analysis of samples from anoxic peat soil microcosms with or without amendments of several organic compounds ( see hausmann et al. , 2016 and supporting information 1 ) .

random sampling was performed 10 times and the exponential models described in tettelin et al .
( 2005 ) ( red ) and willenbrock et al .
( 2007 ) ( blue ) were used to predict the size of core genomes ( a and b ) and pangenomes ( c and d ) extrapolated to infinite genomes sampled .

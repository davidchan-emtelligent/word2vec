intention to lose weight , weight changes , and 18 - y mortality in overweight individuals without co - morbidities weight loss and mortality a study in this month 's plos medicine concludes that , " deliberate weight loss in overweight subjects , without known co - morbidities , may be hazardous in the long term. " stampfer questions whether the data really support such a conclusion .
randomized trials and observational studies have conclusively shown a marked improvement in several cardiovascular risk factors when obese individuals lose weight , including decreases in blood pressure , and improvements in the lipid profile and glucose metabolism .
these results are closely consistent with observational data linking weight gain to worsening of these cardiovascular risk factors , and to their natural sequelae , clinical cardiovascular events .
obesity is also strongly associated with increased risk of cancer at various sites. with such compelling evidence of the adverse effects of obesity and overweight [ 1 - 4 ] , why has there been a continuing controversy about its association with overall mortality ?
in their paper in this month 's plos medicine , jaakio kaprio and colleagues conclude that " deliberate weight loss in overweight subjects without known co - morbidities may be hazardous in the long term " [ 5 ] .
do the data really support such a conclusion ?
an examination of this paper illustrates several of the complexities in approaching this seemingly simple question .
evidence from epidemiological studies epidemiologic studies of the relation between overweight and mortality typically must address three principal concerns [ 6 ] .
first , in many populations , cigarette smokers tend to be leaner than nonsmokers .
because cigarette smoking is such a strong risk factor for mortality , failure to adjust for this adequately can lead to confounding , with the erroneous conclusion that leanness carries increased risk of death .
statistical adjustment for smoking is often insufficient to account for this difficulty .
smoking can lead to medical conditions , sometimes sub - clinical , that are associated with decreased body weight , such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
the presence of symptoms or diagnosed conditions may induce smokers to quit .
moreover , the intensity of smoking is related to both risk of death and body mass index .
for these reasons , the best way to assess the impact of overweight on risk of mortality is simply to exclude current and past smokers .
kaprio and colleagues' study differentiated only current smoker or nonsmoker .
thus , never - smokers were included in the same category as past smokers , regardless of how much the past smokers had smoked or their reasons for quitting .
a second difficulty in some epidemiologic studies is the inclusion of intermediary factors as co - variates .
weight loss improves hypertension and diabetes , so including these as co - variates would tend to attenuate the apparent benefit of weight loss .
in the present study , the authors appropriately excluded people with diabetes , and adjustment for hypertension appeared to have little impact .
the third and most difficult issue in studies of overweight and mortality is reverse causation , the impact of disease on body weight .
this can occur either through the biological impact of a condition ( diagnosed or preclinical ) or as an inducement to attempt to lose weight as a means to improve health .
the authors' keen recognition of this problem provides a significant strength to the present study .
the authors appropriately excluded individuals with a wide range of conditions to identify an apparently healthy cohort .
this critical step is often ignored .
sometimes , investigators also exclude deaths that occur in the first few years after follow - up , to reduce the impact of reverse causation .
such lagged analyses can be helpful , but some chronic conditions of long duration , such as depression , chronic lung disease , and heart failure ( conditions that often may not reach the level of clinical diagnosis ) can lead to lower body weight and higher mortality risk .
hence , that strategy ( not employed by kaprio and colleagues ) may not fully avoid the problem .
the difficulties of assessing the effects of intention to lose weight as a further step toward reducing the potential bias of the impact of disease on body weight , the authors identified individuals with intent to lose weight .
unintended weight loss is well known as an ominous clinical sign , usually signifying a serious illness .
just over a third of the overweight subjects in the kaprio cohort had expressed intent to lose weight at baseline in 1975 .
it is interesting to note that despite this intention , as a group , the median weight change in the ensuing six years was a gain of 0.33 kg / m2 , almost identical to the weight change in the group that had not expressed intent to lose weight ( gain of 0.31 kg / m2 ) .
thus , this study cannot fairly be characterized as an assessment of intentional weight loss and its subsequent effect on mortality .
because the changes in weight are so similar in these two groups , it is implausible to attribute the weight loss in the intent - to - lose group to that intention .
these findings render the results particularly difficult to interpret .
other important limitations include the very small number of endpoints - - only 268 total deaths in the cohort .
when further subdivided according to intention to lose weight , and categories of weight change , the numbers are far from sufficient for reliable estimates .
for example , the main conclusions are based on the subgroup of those with intent to lose weight who actually lost weight ; this group had only 42 deaths , of which ten were violent .
another related difficulty is that this cohort , though overweight , is not drastically obese .
the median body mass index ( bmi ) was 26.7 kg / m2 , and fewer than 10 % of people had a bmi greater than 30. with such a narrow range of bmi , coupled with the very small changes in weight during the six years of initial follow - up , even a very large study would not have sufficient power to detect plausible relative risks associated with weight change .
what advice should be given ?
given the well - known adverse metabolic consequences of overweight and obesity , the strong links with cardiovascular disease and several other serious illnesses , and the absence of any plausible adverse biologic consequences of maintaining normal weight ( bmi 19 to 25 ) , it seems prudent to continue advising adults to seek to maintain a weight within that range .
the results from kaprio et al , although they raise questions about the effects of weight loss , do not cast serious doubt on that advice .

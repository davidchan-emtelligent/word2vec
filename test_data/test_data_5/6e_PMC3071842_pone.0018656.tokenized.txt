background allograft vasculopathy ( av ) and native atherosclerosis ( na ) share the presence of a t - cell mediated inflammatory response , but differ in overall plaque morphology and growth rate .
we studied the distribution and frequency of regulatory - and cytotoxic t cells in the arterial intima lesions in both conditions .
methodology / principal findings the study is based on vessels of 15 explanted human renal allografts with av and 10 carotid artery plaques obtained at surgery .
distribution and frequency of cytotoxic - and regulatory t cells , as identified by the expression of granzyme b ( grb ) and foxp3 was established in na and av. furthermore , we compared the distribution of these cells in av with the perivascular , interstitial renal tissue using immunohistochemistry .
the total number of t cells was much higher in av than in na lesions ( 711 +/ - 135 and 37 +/ - 8 cd3 / mm2 respectively , p < 0.005 , mean , +/ - sem ) .
total numbers of foxp3 + regulatory cells were also significantly increased in av ( 36 +/ - 10 and 0.9 +/ - 0.3 foxp3 +/ mm2 p < 0.05 ) , but relative numbers , expressed as a percentage of the total number of cd3 + t cells (( foxp3 +/ cd3 +) x100 ) , were not significantly different ( 4.6 %+/ - 0.9 and 2.7 %+/ - 0.6 ) .
grb + cells were rare in na , but significantly increased numbers of grb + cells were found in av lesions ( 85 +/ - 24 and 0.2 +/ - 0.1 grb +/ mm2 , p < 0.05 ) .
perivascular tissues in the allografts showed a higher relative frequency of foxp3 + cells than adjacent intimal lesions ( 14.0 %+/ - 2.7 and 4.6 %+/ - 0.9 , respectively , p < 0.05 ) , but a lower frequency of grb + cytotoxic t cells ( 16.1 %+/ - 2.7 and 22.6 %+/ - 3.6 , p < 0.05 ) .
conclusions similar to na , av is characterized by a low frequency of intimal foxp3 + regulatory t cells .
moreover , significant spatial differences exist in the distribution of functional t cell subsets between the intra - and extravascular micro - environments of the graft .
introduction allograft vasculopathy ( av ) is a hallmark of chronic allograft dysfunction in heart and kidney transplantation [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
av differs from naturally occurring plaques in native arteries ( native atherosclerosis , na ) by its rapid onset and progression , and distinct morphologic features like concentric rather than eccentric distribution of plaques in the affected vessels [ 3 ] .
while na is basically a lipid related chronic inflammatory process in the vessel wall , av is generally considered to be an alloimmune process .
t cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of both na and av. by the secretion of inflammatory mediators and direct cell - cell interactions with other plaque cells , activated t cells are able to induce the proliferation or apoptosis of intimal cells , modulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix components and thus directly influence atherosclerotic plaque growth and stability [ 4 ] .
in na , th1 cells , secreting high levels of interferon ( ifn ) - gamma , are considered to be the most important t cell subset contributing to atherogenesis [ 4 ] .
th1 cells also participate in the pathogenesis of av , but in addition , there is evidence for cytotoxic responses as well , based on the presence of perforin and granzyme b ( grb ) positive t - cells in arteries of transplanted hearts and kidneys [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
regulatory t cells ( treg ) , including the cd4 + cd25highfoxpp3 + subset (' natural occurring treg ') play a central role in inducing and maintaining immunologic tolerance and the termination of immune responses [ 7 ] .
in experimental transplantation it has been shown that foxp3 + regulatory t cells play an important role preventing graft loss and inducing tolerance , and may prevent av [ 8 ] but their significance in human transplantation is still a matter of debate [ 9 ] .
it has been proposed that the intima of arteries represents a specialized immunological microenvironment due to the presence of specific immunocompetent cells ( e.g. endothelial cells , macrophages / foam cells , t - cells , mast cells ) and the typical distribution of extracellular matrix proteins [ 10 ] .
for that reason it could be that one and the same initiating inflammatory factor may lead to different types of immune responses in the intima , compared to the extravascular tissue .
the presence of grb + cytotoxic t cells and foxp3 + regulatory t cells has been studied in heart and kidney allografts [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , but there are no studies that systematically compared the presence of these cells in the intima of arteries and the adjacent perivascular tissue .
in this manuscript we report our quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of the in situ presence and distribution of foxp3 + t cells and grb + cytotoxic t cells in na and in av. methods ethics statement the medical ethical review board granted a waiver for informed consent because only leftover tissue of normal clinical procedures , no longer required for diagnosis or clinical management was used in this study .
all acquired data were analyzed anonymously .
ethics approval was obtained from the medical ethical review board of the academic medical centre , university of amsterdam .
specimens this study is based on 25 paraffin embedded tissue blocks of 15 patients that underwent nephrectomy for renal failure due to chronic allograft dysfunction .
tissue blocks were retrospectively retrieved from the archives of the pathology department of the academic medical centre .
details of the patients are summarized in table 1 .
h & e and pasd stainings were prepared for histopathological grading of plaque constituents , parameters of allograft vasculopathy and histological diagnoses according to the latest banff update ' 07 [ 13 ] .
small - and medium sized renal arteries ( interlobar - , arcuate and interlobular arteries ) were screened histomorphologically for concentric or eccentric distribution of intimal lesions and for the presence of the following plaque components : cellular intimal hyperplasia , sclerosing fibrosis , lipid core and inflammatory cells .
as reference materials we sampled native atherosclerotic plaques from carotid endarterectomy specimens of 10 patients operated for symptomatic carotid artery disease ( see table 1 ) .
na specimens were handled following the same procedures as for av lesions .
all plaques were advanced , lipid / fibrolipid plaques ( type iv , va and vb , according to the classification of the american heart association [ 14 ] .
plaques displaying major thrombotic events were not encountered in this series .
we used carotid artery plaques since surgical materials of renal arteries with significant atherosclerosis were not available .

immunohistochemistry immunohistochemical double stainings were performed on 5 microm thick , serial sections of all the tissue blocks .
for immunohistochemical analysis , the following antibodies were used : rabbit monoclonal anti - cd3 ( pan - t , clone sp7 , thermo scientific / labvision , fremont , ca , usa ) ; rabbit monoclonal anti - cd8 ( cytotoxic t cells , clone sp16 , thermo scientific / labvision ) ; mouse monoclonal anti - foxp3 ( treg , clone 236a / e7 ; abcam , cambridge , uk ) ; mouse monoclonal anti - granzyme b ( clone grb - 7 , monosan , sanbio , uden , the netherlands [ 15 ]) ; mouse monoclonal anti - cd57 ( nk cells , clone hnk - 1 , thermo scientific / labvision ) ; mouse monoclonal anti - cd68 ( macrophages , pg - m1 , dako , glostrup , denmark ) ; alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) - conjugated mouse anti - tryptase ( chemicon / millipore , temecula , ca , usa ) ; rabbit polyclonal anti c4d ( biomedica medizinproducte , vienna , austria ) and mouse monoclonal anti - polyoma ( bk ) virus ( clone dp02 , calbiochem / oncogene research products , cambridge , ma , usa ) .
as secondary step ( except for the tryptase staining , which antibody was already ap labelled ) we used alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti rabbit - and anti mouse - polymers ( immunologic , duiven the netherlands ) .
immunohistochemical sequential double alkaline phosphatase staining was performed as previously described [ 16 ] .
negative control experiments were performed with matched species or mouse isotype control reagents using similar immunoglobulin concentrations .
quantification digital images covering the complete pathological intima were obtained from the histological specimens using a leica dfc500 digital camera mounted on a leica dm5000b microscope .
t cells subsets ( cd3 +/ foxp3 - , cd3 +/ foxp3 + , cd8 + granzyme b - , cd8 +/ grb +) were counted in the intima of na and av specimens with image pro plus image analysis software ( media cybernatics , bethesda md , usa ) using the ' manual tag ' option .
image pro plus was also used for measuring the total intimal surface area of the na and av specimens .
only the surface area of fibrous tissue was measured ( the area occupied by atheroma was not included ) .
furthermore , in the nephrectomy specimens 3 microscope fields of ' inflammatory hotspots' ( areas with high density of infiltrates at scanning magnification , 20x objective ) were selected in the direct peri - adventitial area of the vessels , and the numbers of t cell subsets were counted in these areas also. of each tissue block , the total number of cd3 + t cells that were counted to determine the frequency of a specific t cell subset was in the range of 300 - 2500 .
the numbers of cells were expressed as mean number of cells / mm2 +/ - sem .
grb + and foxp3 + cells were also expressed as a percentage of the total number of cd8 + or cd3 + cells , respectively .
statistical analysis statistical differences between na and av were calculated using two tailed unpaired t - test .
differences between intra and extravascular t cells subsets in the nephrectomy specimens were analyzed using a two tailed paired t - test .
values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism version 4.0 ( graphpad software inc , lajolla , ca , usa ) .
results 1 .
histopathological findings all nas lesions contained a lipid core albeit with considerable variation in volume , surrounded by collagen and other extracellular matrix components as well as smooth muscle cells ( smc ) and variable degrees of inflammatory infiltrates composed of macrophages , foam cells and t lymphocytes .
the characteristics of the nephrectomy patients are summarized in table 1 , and representative histological - and immunohistochemical stainings are illustrated in figure 1 .
all patients showed chronic allograft vasculopathy superimposed to acute rejection ( for banff classification see table 1 ) .
none of the nephrectomies had signs of polyoma virus infections ( data not shown ) .
interlobar arteries and small parenchymatous arteries showed concentric intimal lesions composed of smc cells and prominent mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates , mainly macrophages and t lymphocytes .
the vast majority of arteries also contained cd68 + foam cells and multifocal extracellular lipid deposits .
inflammatory cells were frequently found in close proximity of the endothelial lining of the vessels and in many cases " lifting up " of the endothelial layer ( endothelialitis ) was observed .
renal veins showed similar pathologic findings as were observed in the arteries ( data not shown ) .

2. t cells and t cell - subsets in native atherosclerosis and transplantation arteriosclerosis numbers of t cells in na and av were assessed with the pan t cell marker cd3 .
the overall density of t cells in av appeared significantly higher than in na lesions ( 711 +/ - 135 vs. 36.8 +/ - 8.3 cd3 + t cells / mm2 , respectively , mean +/ - sem , see figure 2a ) .
similarly , the numbers of cd8 + cells / mm2 were also significantly higher in av compared to na ( 370 +/ - 77 vs.15.3 +/ - 2.7 , respectively , see figure 2b ) .

* : p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.005 .
foxp3 + t cells were relatively rare in na specimens , but significantly higher numbers were encountered in all av specimens ( 0.9 +/ - 0.3 vs. 36.2 +/ - 10.1 foxp3 +/ mm2 , see figure 1b - d , and 2c ) .
however , when the frequency of foxp3 + treg was expressed as a percentage of the total numbers of cd3 + cells that were present in the diseased intima , it appeared that the frequency of foxp3 + t cells in av were slightly ( but not statistically significant ) higher compared to na ( 2.7 %+/ - 0.6 and 4.6 %+/ - 0.9 , respectively , figure 2e ) .
cytotoxic , grb + t cells were rare in native atherosclerotic plaques ( 0.2 +/ - 0.1 cells / mm2 ) .
in 6 / 10 of the studied samples no grb + cells were encountered , while in the samples that did contain grb + cells their numbers were always very low (< 5 cells per section ) .
in sharp contrast , significantly increased numbers of grb + cells were encountered in all av affected arteries ( 85 +/ - 24 cells / mm2 , see fig. 2d , and a representative histological examples in figure 1e and f ) .
in addition , when expressed as a percentage of the total number of cd8 positive cells present in the pathological intima , the numbers of grb + cells were significantly higher in av when compared to na ( figure 2f ) although virtually all grb + cells co - expressed cd8 , sparse cd8 - grb + cells were observed in renal allograft specimens .
most of these cells were not encountered in the affected vessels , but in the renal interstitial tissue .
immunohistochemical double staining with anti cd57 identified these cells as nk cells ( see fig. 3a ) .
grb + mast cells and / or macrophages as has been described by others , were not encountered ( see figure 3b ) .

3 : intra - and extra vascular regulatory and cytotoxic t cells in chronic allograft vasculopathy finally , we also compared the intra - and extra vascular percentages of foxp3 + t cells and activated cytotoxic ( grb +) t cells in the tissue specimens with av. the frequency of foxp3 + cells , that were found in relative low numbers in the intima of vessels with av ( 4.6 %+/ - 0.9 ) , was significantly increased in the peri - adventitial tissue of the renal allograft specimens ( 14.6 %+/ - 2.0 , p < 0.05 , see figure 4a ) .
in contrast , the frequency of grb + t cells was significantly lower in the peri - adventitial tissue ( 14.6 %+/ - 2.0 ) when compared to the intima in av ( 22.6 +/ - 3.6 , p < 0.05 , figure 4b ) .

discussion in this study we investigated the presence and distribution of foxp3 + regulatory - and grb + cytotoxic t cells in native and transplant arteriosclerosis , and compared the intra - and extra vascular distribution of foxp3 + and grb + in renal allograft explants for chronic rejection .
quantitative analysis of t cells revealed that the density ( cells / mm2 ) of cd3 + and cd8 + t cells in the intima are more than 100 - fold higher in av compared to na. in native atherosclerotic plaques t cells are not equally distributed throughout the intima .
local ' hotspots' t cells can frequently be found in ' shoulder ' of the plaque , near the atheroma , and in the fibrous cap , and outside these areas t cells are usually sparsely present .
t cells in these hotspots are considered very important because activated t cells contribute to plaque destabilization and rupture , typically on these locations [ 4 ] , [ 17 ] .
in av on the other hand , t cells are more evenly distributed throughout the intima , and not as ' hotspots ' , as seen in na. we hypothesise that due to this diffuse localisation of t cells in av , these cells contribute to the accelerated and concentric growth pattern as seen in av .
foxp3 + t cells were more frequently encountered in av when compared to na , where these cells were relatively rare .
however , also in av relative numbers of foxp3 + cells were low when expressed as a percentage of the total number of t cells .
hagemeijer et al recently studied foxp3 + regulatory t cells in cardiac allograft explants [ 12 ] , and in that study he did not observe any foxp3 + tregs in cardiac av. our present results , obtained in the kidney are therefore , to some extent , in variance with his results because we did encounter these cells in specimens with av. still , both studies clearly show that the numbers of foxp3 + t cells are low in av , which especially becomes clear when the frequency of these cells is expressed as a percentage of the total number of t cells present in the plaques .
we have previously reported on the presence of foxp3 + t cells in native atherosclerosis , and observed that the numbers of treg in native atherosclerosis , when expressed as a percentage of the total number of cd3 + t cells , were significantly lower when compared to normal skin and inflammatory dermatoses ( psoriasis , spongiotic dermatitis , lichen planus and leishmaniasis ) [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
in normal as well as in inflammatory skin we found the frequency of treg to be in the range of 15 - 25 % , whereas in native atherosclerotic plaques their frequency was in the range of 1 - 5 % , depending of the type of lesion .
in the present study we found that the frequency of foxp3 + cells in av as low , and in the same range as observed in native atherosclerosis .
moreover , the frequency of foxp3 + cells outside the affected arteries was significantly higher , in levels almost comparable to those previously observed in normal skin as well as chronic inflammatory skin diseases [ 18 ] .
it thus appears that low frequency of foxp3 + cells is also a characteristic feature for av. in an experimental model of atherosclerosis , mor at al. have shown that oxidized lipids inhibit foxp3 expression and attenuate suppressive properties of treg [ 20 ] .
based on these findings , we hypothesized that the low frequency of treg , as observed in native atherosclerosis was a consequence of the presence of oxidized lipids in the lesions [ 19 ] .
av lesions may also contain lipids , as macrophage foam cells are frequently encountered in this type of lesions .
therefore , the decreased frequency of treg in av could also be the result of lipids , that are usually present in the intima .
this hypothesis is substantiated by our present observation that outside the arteries , in the interstitial renal parenchyma , the frequency of foxp3 + treg are significantly higher .
finally , further indirect support for this hypothesis is also provided by the observation that hypercholesterolemia is an independent risk factor for av [ 21 ] .
grb staining of ctl indicates activation of an important mechanism of cell mediated cytotoxicity carried out by lytic proteins that are present in the cytoplasmic cytotoxic granules of cells [ 15 ] .
besides cytotoxic effects on target cells , granzymes may also contribute to remodelling and weakening of the intimal extracellular matrix , by degrading extracellular matrix proteins such as proteoglycans [ 22 ] .
in na , grb + lymphocytes were very rare , implying that in this type of lesions these cells do not play a role in plaque remodelling or t - cell mediated cytotoxicity .
in contrast , large numbers of grb + t cells were present in arteries of the renal explants , showing that cytotoxic t cells responses play an important role in the pathogenesis of av. an interesting finding of this study was that the frequency of intravascular , activated cytotoxic cd8 + lymphocytes was significantly higher compared to the extra - vascular compartment .
we hypothesize that the increased numbers of intravascular grb + cells in av is a consequence of the relative low frequency of foxp3 + cells .
our present findings are , to some extent , in contrast with a study by choy et al , who also studied grb expression in native atherosclerosis and transplant vascular disease [ 23 ] .
in that study the authors showed extensive diffuse intracellular staining with grb in macrophages , smc ( also in the media ) and leukocytes in specimens with advanced native atherosclerosis and transplant arteriosclerosis .
in this study , cytotoxic t cells were very rare in native atherosclerotic specimens , which is also in agreement with results already reported by others [ 24 ] .
moreover , we always observed grb as clear intracellular granules in conjunction with cd8 + , and occasionally also with cd57 + cells ( figure 3 ) .
this staining pattern is exactly what one could expect , since granzymes are know to be present and stored in such cytotoxic granules .
the most plausible explanation for the observed difference between our study and that of choy is the primary antibody used .
choy and colleagues used an antibody for santa cruz , while we used the well characterized and frequently used grb7 clone .
although it is known that activated mast cells are able to express grb [ 25 ] , we did not observe tryptase + grb + cells in any of the sections , which suggests that activated mast cells do not play an important role in av. patients' immunosuppressive therapy was withdrawn ( in our study group at least 2 weeks for all patients ) before the surgical removal of dysfunctional allografts .
indeed , besides av , we also observed several signs of acute rejection in these specimens .
it has been shown that infiltration with grb + [ 25 ] and foxp3 + [ 26 ] cells is associated with episodes of acute rejection .
therefore , it is likely that the presence of a part of these cells we observed in the allografts were the result of such a response .
this could also have contributed to the observed difference in absolute numbers of functional t cell subsets between na and av specimens .
however , this also implicates that our present finding were not , or at least to lesser extent , biased by the immunosuppressive therapy .
in conclusion , in this study we have shown that the distribution of functional t cell subsets differs between the intra - and extravascular compartment in renal allografts with chronic allograft dysfunction .
the relative low numbers of foxp3 + cells , and relatively high numbers of cytotoxic cells suggest that impaired t cell suppression in the arterial intima contribute to chronic allograft vasculopathy .
therapeutic enrichment of intravascular regulatory t cells , as has been proposed for the treatment of native atherosclerosis [ 27 ] , may also be an interesting novel strategy to prevent chronic allograft vasculopathy .

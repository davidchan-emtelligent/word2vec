direct animal behavior can be inferred from the fossil record only in exceptional circumstances .
the exceptional mode of preservation of ammonoid shells in the posidonia shale ( lower jurassic , lower toarcian ) of dotternhausen in southern germany , with only the organic periostracum preserved , provides an excellent opportunity to observe the contents of the ammonoid body chamber because this periostracum is translucent .
here , we report upon three delicate lobsters preserved within a compressed ammonoid specimen of harpoceras falciferum .
we attempt to explain this gregarious behavior .
the three lobsters were studied using standard microscopy under low angle light .
the lobsters belong to the extinct family of the eryonidae ; further identification was not possible .
the organic material of the three small lobsters is preserved more than halfway into the ammonoid body chamber .
the lobsters are closely spaced and are positioned with their tails oriented toward each other .
the specimens are interpreted to represent corpses rather than molts .
the lobsters probably sought shelter in preparation for molting or against predators such as fish that were present in dotternhausen .
alternatively , the soft tissue of the ammonoid may have been a source of food that attracted the lobsters , or it may have served as a long - term residency for the lobsters ( inquilinism ) .
the lobsters represent the oldest known example of gregariousness amongst lobsters and decapods in the fossil record .
gregarious behavior in lobsters , also known for extant lobsters , thus developed earlier in earth 's history than previously known .
moreover , this is one of the oldest known examples of decapod crustaceans preserved within cephalopod shells .
introduction gregarious behavior of organisms is known to have numerous advantages such as resource exploitation , mating success , environmental modification , and reduction of the risk of predation ( see [ 1 ] and references therein ) .
this behavior is known for modern marine arthropods such as brachyurans ( e.g. [ 2 ]) , anomurans ( e.g. [ 3 ]) , and macrurans ( e.g. [ 4 ] , [ 1 ]) .
gregarious sheltering was reported for the palinurid scyllarides latus [ 5 ] and appears to be common for clawless lobsters ([ 6 ] and references therein ) .
gregarious behavior is also known from the fossil record ( e.g. [ 7 ] for trilobites and references therein ) .
examples of this behavior preserved within empty mollusk shells from the fossil record are extremely rare .
however , those examples known , show that mollusk shells were ( temporarily ) inhabited by numerous types of organisms .
in the paleozoic , trilobites inhabited cephalopod shells ( e.g. [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ]) .
for example , three examples with more than one individual of the same trilobite species within a cephalopod shell are known [ 8 ] .
these occurrences seem to support the idea that trilobites assembled in monospecific clusters for molting prior to en masse copulation .
nice examples from the late cretaceous of kansas ( usa ) are flocks of fish preserved within the shells of large inoceramid bivalves [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
at least five different fish genera occurring in groups of up to 104 specimens were preserved within the large valves of the platyceramus platinus [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
another example of fossilized in situ cave dwellers are small heteromorph ammonoids preserved within large pachidiscid ammonoid shells from the late cretaceous of japan [ 13 ] .
small ammonoids that used a larger shell as a shelter are also known [ 14 ] .
furthermore , triassic ophiuroids were reported to hide within a ceratite ammonoid , possibly for inquiline purposes and to brood [ 15 ] .
lastly , upper cretacous ( campanian ) echinoids sought shelter in an ammonoid found in northern germany [ 16 ] .
gregarious behavior of lobsters may be known from the fossil record .
tsujita [ 17 ] noted that four concretions of the upper cretaceous ( upper campanian - lower maastrichtian ) bearpaw formation in alberta ( canada ) contained two specimens each of the lobster palaeonephrops browni .
he interpreted these concretions to represent burrows .
if this interpretation is correct , these concretions could represent gregarious behavior of lobsters .
concretions of the same formation but from montana ( usa ) containing two lobster specimens were already known [ 18 ] .
the only other example of possible gregarious behavior in mesozoic lobsters known to us is from the lower jurassic ( toarcian ) of greenland [ 19 ] .
concretions containing specimens of glyphea rosenkrantzi were found in situ in burrows known as thalassinoides in the upper part of the ostreaelv formation ( upper toarcian ) [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
although none of the concretions was mentioned to contain two lobsters [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] , an illustration in [ 19 ] ( their fig. 6 ) suggests that several lobsters lived in the same burrow system .
gregarious behavior from the fossil record is also recorded for shrimp .
numerous papers report on two or more callianassid claws preserved in burrows ( e.g. [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] , [ 28 ]) .
the claws may represent more than one individual .
the oldest known examples are from the late cretaceous [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , [ 26 ] .
numerous callianassids present in one burrow system are also known from the present [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] .
we are unaware of gregarious behavior of non - lobster decapods prior to the cretaceous .
the aim of this paper is to report upon the oldest example of definite gregarious behavior of fossil lobsters and decapods .
geological setting the lower toarcian posidonia shale is famous for its excellent preservation of marine fossils and its high amount of organic matter .
both quality of preservation and accumulation of organic matter have been explained by permanent anoxic bottom waters known as the stagnant basin model [ 31 ] .
in dotternhausen near balingen , 70 km southwest of holzmaden in southwestern germany , the posidonia shale is quarried by the holcim ( suddeutschland ) gmbh for cement production ( figures 1 , 2 ) .

the specimen was collected near the inoceramenbank , at 400 cm depth .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0031893.g002 figure 2 impression of the posidonia shale in the quarry in dotternhausen .
high - resolution geochemical , sedimentological and paleoecological investigations of the exposed section in dotternhausen showed that oxygen availability was variable and ranged from short oxygenated periods to longer - term anoxia [ 32 ] .
indeed , benthic organisms such as bivalves , brachiopods , lobsters , and serpulids are known from the posidonia shale at dotternhausen [ 33 ] .
the variations in oxygen content were probably induced by a strong meridional atmospheric circulation system with pronounced seasonal changes of prevailing trade - and monsoon - wind systems [ 32 ] .
during the monsoon - influenced summer months , a stratified water column with anoxic conditions developed below the halocline .
during the winter months , a saline circulation system brought oxygen to the benthic environment , favoring temporary benthic colonization , especially during times of relative sea level highstand [ 32 ] .
the sediments at dotternhausen show very euxinic conditions during the early falciferum zone ( oil shale ) ; more aerated bottom waters established during the late falciferum zone ( bituminous mudstone ) [ 34 ] .
just below and above the ' inoceramenbank ' in the dotternhausen section ( see fig. 1 ) , long - term aerated bottom waters were proposed to exist [ 34 ] .
this is exactly that part of the stratigraphic column from which several ammonoids with contents in their body chambers have been found [ 35 ] .
the phragmocones of the ammonoids are compressed to a thickness of only 1 - 2 mm , because of the very rapid sedimentation rate at the time of deposition of the posidonia shale [ 32 ] .
the calcareous shell layers are dissolved , but the periostracum is preserved as a very thin , golden brown , translucent coating .
this allows for exploring the inside of the body chamber .
nearly 4 % of the relatively large body chambers of adult harpoceras falciferum macroconchs contain distinctive crop content , mostly pereiopods of small decapod crustaceans and small aptychi [ 35 ] .
the inquiline use of large body chambers of adult harpoceras falciferum macroconchs by several fish of the genus pholidophorus and the lobster palaeastacus sp. was previously noted [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
the example presented herein of early jurassic eryonid lobsters preserved in the ammonoid harpoceras falciferum macroconch was collected from the same stratigraphic level .
results location of the lobsters within the ammonoid the three lobsters are found within a body chamber of the toarcian ammonoid harpoceras falciferum from dotternhausen , germany .
the diameter of the ammonoid shell is 230 mm and the aptychi are missing .
because the ammonoid is two - dimensionally compressed with only the golden brown translucent periostracum preserved , it can be inferred that the lobsters are located inside the body chamber and not on top or below the ammonoid .
as for the ammonoid , only the organic remains of the lobsters are preserved .
the lobsters are located within the body chamber in the outermost whorl .
the central one of the three lobsters is approximately 170degrees from the aperture and about 90degrees from the last septum ( figure 3 ) .
the other two lobsters are very close to it ; approximately 10degrees from the central one , with their tails centrally and cephalothoraxes radially directed ( figure 4 ) .

the scale bar represents 10 mm. description of the lobsters the cephalothoraxes of the three lobsters are longer than wide ; the outline is subcircular to rectangular ( figure 5 ) .
none of the cephalothoraxes exhibits a branchiocardiac or cervical groove ; instead , longitudinal carinae ( small ridges ) are present .
the longitudinal carinae are present on the posterior part of cephalothorax of the lobster closest to the aperture ; on the anteriormost part it is accompanied by subparallel carinae on both sides that curve more laterally in the posteriormost part .
the central cephalothorax exhibits three longitudinal carinae on the posterior part .
the middle carina is located on the longitudinal axis ; the second and third carinae are oriented more laterally and parallel the middle carina .
these carinae are longer than the middle one , curve more laterally on the posteriormost parts , and do not connect to the posterior rim .
the innermost cephalothorax exhibits two longitudinal , long carinae on both posterolateral parts and two smaller , parallel carinae that originate on the posterior edge .
the outermost cephalothorax is more elongated than the other two cephalothoraxes ; it also shows a narrower front , possibly due to compression / degradation prior to burial .

' a ' represents the lobster that is closest to the aperture , ' b ' is the middle specimen , and ' c ' is the specimen closest to the phragmocone .
the scale bars are 10 mm. five abdominal segments can be observed for the outermost lobster ; six abdominal segments are visible in the central and innermost lobsters .
the tergum is rectangular .
the shape of the epimeres is not well visible .
the central and innermost lobsters exhibit isolated , faint traces of an abdominal keel .
only a part of the telson is visible in the outermost lobster ; the uropod is small .
the telson of the central lobster is triangular , about twice as long as wide with the apex pointed posteriorly .
the oval - shaped endopods are somewhat larger than the similar - shaped exopod ; both contain a longitudinal carina on their axes that extend the entire length of the endopod .
the endopod is nearly as long as the telson .
the outer part of the exopod is less curved than the inner part .
no diaeresis is present on the uropods .
the tailfan forms a convex shape as a whole .
the tailfan of the innermost lobster is identical to the central one .
the first pair of the pereiopods represents the longest pair and they are homochelous .
the propodus and dactylus are nearly parallel to the body axis .
in the outermost specimen , the anteriormost pereiopods are chelate and the dactylus is located on the outer side of the pereiopod .
the dactylus is slightly longer than the anterior part of propodus .
the tips of propodus and dactylus curve inward .
the anterior part of the propodus and the dactylus of the right first pereiopod are nearly equal in length .
the merus exhibits a nearly 55degrees angle with the propodus and is nearly transversely oriented to the longitudinal axis .
the first pairs of pereiopods of the central and innermost specimens resemble those of the outermost specimen .
the outermost lobster exibits two antennules and two antennae .
the orbits are not preserved in the three specimens .

taxonomic identity of the lobsters the overall outline and details on the cephalothoraxes and abdomina suggest that the lobster specimens belong to the eryonoidea .
three families were reported to belong to the eryonoidea [ 38 ] : the coleiidae , polychelidae , and eryonidae .
recently , two families were added to this superfamily [ 39 ] : the tetrachelidae and palaeopentachelidae .
karasawa et al .
[ 40 ] provided an emended diagnosis for the coleiidae .
this family exhibits a cervical and postcervical groove ; both are absent in our specimens .
medial and branchial carinae and an abdominal keel , albeit faint , are present in the studied specimens .
the exopod exhibits no diaeresis in our specimens , which differs from the coleiidae .
in conclusion , the specimens cannot be assigned to the coleiidae .
the specimens cannot be assigned to the polychelidae , tetrachelidae , or palaeopentachelidae either .
the polychelidae exhibit pronounced cervical grooves and a spinose lateral margin , which is not the case in the studied specimens ( see [ 38 ]) .
the tetrachelidae are different as well because they do exhibit a cervical and branchiocardiac groove , and their telson is rounded posteriorly instead of pointed .
the family palaeopentachelidae [ 41 ] exhibits a median - only cervical groove , which is absent in the specimens described here .
also , the occlusal margins of the propodus and dactylus do not exhibit spines , whereas members of the palaeopentachelidae exhibit these spines [ 41 ] .
the specimens fit the diagnosis of the eryonidae [ 38 ] .
a rectangular outline of the cephalothorax can be observed in the specimens .
the cervical groove and longitudinal keels are absent or short for this family .
in the specimens , the cervical groove is absent , while longitudinal keels are only observed in the posteriormost part of the cephalothoraxes .
as noted in the family diagnosis , the uropods do not exhibit a diaeresis .
the other characteristics ( well - developed eyes and first four pereiopods chelate ) could not be observed in our specimens due to the mode of preservation .
feldmann et al .
[ 42 ] ( p. 405 ) stated that ' the eryonidae have a narrow front and well - defined orbits , and if longitudinal carinae are present , they seem to be confined to the posterior part of the carapace . '
this is consistent with the specimens described herein .
the eryonidae currently consist of four genera [ 39 ] : eryon , cycleryon , rosenfeldia , and knebelia .
the uropods are rounded instead of pointed which would exclude eryon .
the mode of preservation , where the periostracum of the ammonoid encases the lobsters and obliterates details , does not allow further ascription to the genus and species level .
discussion decapods in cephalopods the presence of decapods in fossil cephalopod shells is known [ 16 ] , [ 36 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , [ 45 ] , [ 46 ] .
table 2 lists mesozoic and cenozoic decapods preserved in cephalopods with the exception of hermit crabs preserved in cephalopod shells [ 47 ] , [ 48 ] , [ 49 ] .
these shells in table 2 contain only one decapod , providing no evidence for gregarious behavior for decapods for these examples .
table 2 shows that the specimens described here are among the oldest decapod crustaceans preserved within cephalopod shells .

transportation and ingestion by the ammonoid the ammonoid must have died and sunk to the bottom upon which it became available for occupation by benthic organisms such as lobsters .
the lobsters from this study most likely used the ammonoid as some kind of shelter and were not washed in by bottom currents , nor were they part of the crop / stomach contents of the ammonoid .
although not all details are visible , the three lobsters appear to be complete or nearly so. a crop / stomach content interpretation is impossible because of this .
if the lobsters had been stomach content , smaller pieces of these lobsters would be expected .
this was previously observed in ' food balls' in harpoceras falciferum from the toarcian of dotternhausen containing parts of loose pereiopods , some abdomina and telsons from decapods , or aptychi from small ammonoids [ 35 ] .
not a single piece of carapace could be recognized within the dozens of reported food balls .
the completeness of the lobsters and the presence of more than one individual in virtually the same spot within the ammonoid , and their radial tail to tail preservation , seem to exclude the possibility of transportation into the body chamber by bottom currents .
moreover , cephalopod apertures tend to orient themselves down - current [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] .
mundlos [ 53 ] proposed a model for sediment infill of ceratite ammonoids .
in the early phases of infill , water enters the body chamber along the ventral side and exits the shell through the phragmocone and dorsal side of the body chamber .
in the central portion between the ventral and dorsal side , some flow exists from the ventral to the dorsal side .
the lobsters are located partly in the central portion / dorsal side , distal from the proposed inflow path , which makes transportation of the lobsters into the ammonoid shell unlikely .
additional evidence against transportation of the lobsters into the ammonoid shell comes from the fact that all the lobsters are visible in dorsal view , whereas more than one orientation would be expected in the case that the lobsters were washed into the shell .
moreover , transportation into the ammonoid shell would most likely result in breakage / disarticulation of the lobster specimens unlike the specimens presented here .
in conclusion , we rule out transportation into the ammonoid .
molts or corpses ?
instead , the lobsters may have sought shelter to molt .
lobster molts may split along the median line and show misalignment of the abdomen and carapace with the carapace preserved on its lateral side [ 54 ] referred to as the ' lobster open molt position ' [ 55 ] .
a similar mode of molting for lobsters was mentioned previously [ 38 ] , occurring as a result of lobsters molting on their side .
recently , it was shown that molted remains of erymid lobsters may also be preserved with the dorsal side up with or without a median split and with misalignment of the abdomen based on middle triassic lobsters from the netherlands [ 56 ] .
none of the abdomina and cephalothoraxes of the lobsters presented herein are misaligned and no median split can be observed , suggesting that the specimens are corpses rather than molts .
however , it was suggested that some lobster molts can be preserved articulated , especially those preserved in quiet water conditions [ 38 ] .
additionally , it was stated that some lobsters molt in an upright position and may leave the carapace behind in its normal position , thus resembling a corpse [ 55 ] .
given that the sediments in the posidonia shale were deposited under relatively quiet water conditions and given the enclosed area of the lobsters within the ammonoid shell , these three specimens may either be interpreted as molts or corpses from this perspective .
palinurids probably molted upright [ 55 ] .
although we favor another classification in which palinurids and eryonoids are classified within two different infraorders ( achelata and polychelida , respectively ) [ 57 ] , eryonoids have been proposed to be related to palinurids as they both were listed as part of the infraorder palinura [ 39 ] .
if the latter is correct , eryonoids may have molted in the same fashion as palinurids .
additionally , mertin [ 22 ] ( p. 249 ) stated about molted palinurids that ' both parts of palinurids [ abdomen and carapace ] have a skewed position relative to each other , both from the front and from the top [ dorsal view ]' .
thus , the specimens from this study might be interpreted as corpses because their abdomina and carapaces are not skewed .
the assumption in both cases is that eryonoids and palinurids molted in the same manner .
however , all eryonoids are extinct [ 57 ] , so no direct proof exists as to their mode of molting .
moreover , as mentioned above , palinurids and eryonoids were also classified within two different infraorders , an interpretation which we favor .
this implies that molting may have occurred sideways as well .
the lobster specimens are of similar length ( see table 1 ) , especially the central and innermost lobsters .
lobster length is known to increase significantly per molt cycle in recent lobsters .
the length of homarus americanus was reported to increase by 11 - 12 % in each molt cycle for a total length range of 140 - 223 mm [ 58 ] .
furthermore , a growth increment of 31.4 % was noted for h. americanus with a cephalothorax length of 4.5 mm decreasing to 8.7 % for a specimen with a carapace length of 128.5 mm [ 59 ] .
molt increments of 30 - 40 mm were noted for male specimens of palinurus mauritanicus with a total length of 250 - 270 mm [ 60 ] , which implies an increase of more than 10 % .
increments per molt for nephrops range from 3 - 12 % although smaller and larger increments have been reported [ 61 ] .
thus , variation exists in the percentage of incremental increase among lobsters , but it is more than 10 % in most cases .
hence , we infer that if the specimens represent three molts , then they must be from at least two individuals that molted in the same spot within the ammonoid , which we interpret to be very unlikely .
all three lobster specimens show a similar mode of preservation : their abdomina and cephalothoraxes are attached and the first pereiopods are nearly in the same place .
the corpses of other decapods , notably shrimp and stomatopods decay fast [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] .
the cephalothorax in shrimp split from the abdomen after one to two weeks and disarticulation of the exoskeleton occurred after six weeks [ 62 ] .
even though the cuticle of the stomatopod neogonodactylus was more robust than that of the shrimp [ see 62 ] , it still showed remarkably fast decay .
ruptures in the abdomen and / or in between the thorax and abdomen occurred after one week and disarticulation / fragmentation of the exoskeleton occurred after four weeks [ 63 ] .
the same processes may be expected to occur on similar time scales for decapod molts .
the results from these studies suggest that our lobster specimens may not be molts because that would imply that the animals molted at / around the same time in the same place , which is unlikely .
the results of the studies on decay [ 62 ] , [ 63 ] also suggest that the lobsters were most likely alive at the same time because of the very similar mode of preservation .
if the lobsters were not alive at the same time then the modes of preservation are expected to differ , which we did not observe in the specimens .
extant lobsters have been reported to eat their shedded exoskeleton to regain the lost calcium carbonate after molting when their mouth parts have hardened [ 64 ] .
the female molt is reported to be mostly eaten by a male specimen of homarus americanus after copulation during postmating cohabitation [ 65 ] .
assuming that specimens of the lobsters under study also ate the molt on a regular basis , the specimens cannot be molts .
in conclusion , we interpret the remains to be corpses rather than molts based on the completeness of the specimens in general , the preservation in dorsal position , the radial position of the lobsters within the body chamber with their tails close together , and a similar mode of preservation .
possible purposes of gregarious behavior because transportation of the lobsters inside the shell is unlikely ( see above ) , the lobsters themselves must have entered the ammonoid shell while it was lying on the bottom of the ocean .
this was possible because of the relatively small size of the lobsters in comparison to the aperture of the shell .
several scenarios might explain the presence of lobsters in the shell of harpoceras falciferum : a ) the ammonoid shell was an ideal spot to molt , b ) the shell provided protection against predators , c ) the decomposing soft body of the ammonoid provided a source of food , or d ) the shell was used for long - term residency ( inquilinism ) .
in this case , these are examples of gregarious use of shelters , which have been reported for extant palinurids ( e.g. [ 1 ] , [ 5 ]) .
interestingly , the formation of groups is enhanced by chemosensory cues [ 4 ] .
molting in a protected environment must have been beneficial to remaining protected for the time the new skeleton was not fully hardened .
molting of crustaceans in cephalopod shells has been suggested .
remains of a trilobite preserved in a late silurian nautiloid from the czech republic was interpreted to represent a molt [ 8 ] .
furthermore , the presence of a molted specimen of the lobster eryma dutertrei was noted in a perisphinctid ammonoid shell from the upper jurassic (" portlandian ") of the united kingdom [ 36 ] and some molts of triassic pseudopemphix were found in internal molds of the body chamber of the nautiloid germanonautilus [ 66 ] .
more recently , crab molts were found in nautiloid shells from the upper paleocene of spain [ 46 ] .
the specimens from this study may have sought shelter to molt , but had not yet molted ( see above ) .
as can be seen in figure 3 , the lobsters are located more than halfway within the body chamber toward the phragmocone and , thus , were out of direct sight of predators checking the aperture .
protection unrelated to molting could be another reason to seek shelter in an ammonoid shell .
the posidonia shale was not an environment in which many opportunities to shelter were available at the time of deposition .
the most abundant shelters on the muddy ocean floor were ammonoid shells , especially specimens of the large harpoceras falciferum .
other abundant ammonoids such as dactylioceras , hildoceras , and lytoceras are smaller on average , and thus may have been impossible to access depending on the relative size of the decapod and ammonoid .
moreover , these shells were lighter and possibly more affected by bottom currents , and , thus , would represent an unstable shelter .
to date , not a single decapod specimen has been found in shells of other ammonoid genera , whereas a few single decapod specimens have been found in harpoceras shells from dotternhausen ( pers. observation ) .
the decapods may have sought shelter to avoid predatory fish , as fish are known to be an important predator of extant lobsters ( e.g. [ 67 ]) , especially on small or juvenile lobsters [ 68 ] .
moreover , fishes may have influenced the evolution of crustaceans [ 69 ] .
the presence of fish in mollusk and cephalopod shells is often proposed to be for protective reasons for the fish themselves ( e.g. [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 70 ] , [ 71 ] , [ 72 ]) , but fish also may have been actively hunting for prey hidden inside shells .
there are numerous examples of predatory fish in ammonoid shells .
for example , the presence of a macrosemiid fish , most likely a predatory fish , in a late jurassic ( kimmeridgian ) ammonoid shell is known [ 72 ] and four early jurassic ammonoids from germany and england contained one predatory fish ( dapedium sp. and pholidophorus sp. ) each with their head directed toward the phragmocone [ 37 ] .
in one instance , the fish , dapedium sp. , apparently was stuck in a body chamber [ 37 ] ( their figs. 7 - 8 ) .
three of the four specimens were also collected in the posidonia shale of dotternhausen [ 37 ] .
predatory fish are known to prey on decapod crustaceans in the fossil record ( e.g. [ 73 ]) .
moreover , predatory fish were common in the waters of the posidonia shale [ 74 ] , and , thus , were an immediate threat for decapods in open waters .
we suggest that fish also may have been a threat for those decapods hiding in ammonoid shells .
given the small size of the lobsters presented in this study , they would be especially vulnerable to attacks by predatory fishes .
the lobsters may also have been searching for leftover tissue of the ammonoid inside the shell as the ammonoid specimen does not show any sign of the commonly found ' ventral bite mark ' inflicted by a predator in the water column in this area [ 75 ] , [ 76 ] .
this could explain why there are as many as three individuals within this body chamber .
the lobsters may have used chemoreceptive cues to discover the shell .
decapods might also use the shell for storing food ; the shell would , thus , have served for long - term residency [ 66 ] .
approximately 1 % of the macroconchs of harpoceras falciferum from dotternhausen contains bivalve debris [ 35 ] .
it was suggested that these bivalves were not the stomach remains from the ammonoid , but were probably ' kitchen ' remains of an animal , probably a decapod , living in the shell [ 35 ] .
no remains of possible leftover food from the lobsters were found in the body chamber of the ammonoid in our case , suggesting that storing food was probably not what happened here .
on the other hand , since these particular lobsters have not been found outside ammonoid body chambers , they may have spent an important part of their time inside the ammonoid ( see also below ) .
paleoecology and paleoenvironment these particular , small lobsters have only been found in ammonoid body chambers so far .
not a single specimen is known that was not associated with an ammonoid shell after fifty years of collecting in dotternhausen .
the question then rises whether these decapods were preferentially preserved or whether the ammonoid shell was the place where they spent most of their time .
a clue might come from other decapods from the posidonia shale .
a specimen of palaeastacus ?
sp. was found in a body chamber of harpoceras falciferum from dotternhausen [ 36 ] , but isolated chelae of uncina posidoniae , not associated with ammonoid body chambers , were found several meters stratigraphically below the other decapods [ 36 ] .
only one solitary large / adult eryma sp .
[ 74 ] has been found in the shales of dotternhausen during all those years .
other localities in the posidonia shale in germany also yielded decapods [ 77 ] , [ 78 ] , [ 79 ] , [ 80 ] , [ 81 ] : ? coleia theodorii , c. moorei , c. sinuata , ? eryma sp. , glyphea grandichela , proeryon giganteus , p. hartmanni ( = p. banzensis , p. longiceps , p. macrophthalmus ) , and p. laticaudatus ( = p. hauffi ) , unica posidoniae , and an undetermined specimen resembling an erymid [ 81 ] .
none of these species has been reported from ammonoid body chambers , which suggests that the specimens from this study may have preferred the ammonoid shell as a shelter , but , moreover , may not have been preferentially preserved as numerous decapods have been found outside ammonoids .
the muddy bottom was not suitable for burrowing .
decapod burrows have not been found at the stratigraphic level of the studied specimens .
the fact that the lobsters are present in the shell suggests that there was sufficient oxygen available above the sediment / water interface for at least some periods of time during deposition of the posidonia shale , despite the notion that these black shales would indicate oxygen depletion within this environment [ 31 ] .
this is supported by the presence of other benthic organisms such as bivalves , brachiopods , and serpulids from the posidonia shale at dotternhausen [ 33 ] .
materials and methods the specimen containing the ammonoid and the three lobsters is stored in oertijdmuseum de groene poort ( boxtel , the netherlands ) under museum number mab k3166 .
the ammonoid and the lobsters were studied using standard microscopy and under low angle light .
the latter appeared to be the best method to observe the details of the lobster specimens because the specimens were significantly flattened .
we thank manfred jager ( holcim ( sueddeutschland ) gmbh , germany ) for access to the quarry and for making the specimen available to us. many thanks also to rodney m. feldmann ( kent state university ) , who critically read and commented upon an earlier draft of this manuscript .
we are grateful to the two reviewers for their very useful comments .

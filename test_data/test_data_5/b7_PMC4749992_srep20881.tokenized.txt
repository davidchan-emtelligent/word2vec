based on microarray data from rice flag leaves during early senescence , we identified w - box and g - box cis - elements as positive regulators of senescence in the important rice variety minghui 63 .
both cis - elements were bound by leaf senescence - specific proteins in vitro and influenced senescence in vivo .
furthermore , combination of the two elements drove enhanced expression during leaf senescence , and copy numbers of the cis - elements significantly affected the levels of expression .
the w - box is the cognate cis - element for wrky proteins , while the g - box is the cognate cis - element for bzip , bhlh and nac proteins .
consistent with this , wrky , bzip , bhlh and nac family members were overrepresented among transcription factor genes up - regulated according during senescence .
crosstalk between aba , ctk , br , auxin , ga and ja during senescence was uncovered by comparing expression patterns of senescence up - regulated transcription factors .
together , our results indicate that hormone - mediated signaling could converge on leaf senescence at the transcriptional level through w - box and g - box elements .
considering that there are very few documented early senescence - related cis - elements , our results significantly contribute to understanding the regulation of flag leaf senescence and provide prioritized targets for stay - green trait improvement .
leaf senescence represents the final stage of leaf development and is a complicated process influenced by both external environmental factors and internal gene expression1 .
extensive genome - wide studies have revealed thousands of senescence - associated genes as well as their responses to various inducers of senescence234 .
the most prominent data was obtained using high - resolution time - course microarray analysis during the development of a single arabidopsis leaf over a 3 - week period to senescence .
the growth and biochemical changes during senescence were tracked , and transcription factors ( tfs ) that potentially function at critical time points to activate distinct pathways were identified5 .
a leaf senescence database ( lsd , http :// www.eplantsenescence.org /) was developed that contains 1145 senescence - associated genes ( sags ) from 21 species based on experimental evidence from the literature6 .
hundreds of tfs , including members of wrky , nac , myb , bhlh , and bzip families , are found in the lsd , suggesting that leaf senescence is highly coordinated by complicated regulatory networks .
to date , most of the progress in understanding senescence comes from the model dicot arabidopsis thaliana , while limited information is known about rice sags .
in rice , few sags have been established to take part in the cellular activities underlying the senescence process .
among these , non - yellow coloring 1 ( nyc1 ) , nyc1 - like ( nol ) and staygreen ( sgr ) activate chlorophyll degradation789 .
rice coronatine insensitive 1b ( oscoi1b ) encodes a homolog of the arabidopsis ja receptor coi1 .
the oscoi1b t - dna insertion mutant shows methyl jasmonate ( meja ) insensitivity as well as delayed senescence in both lab and field conditions10 .
in addition , overexpression of the sag oswrky42 in rice results in increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and an early leaf senescence phenotype .
oswrky42 activates leaf senescence by repressing osmt1d expression via binding to the w - box of its promoter11 .
furthermore , osnap ( also named ps1 ) acts as an important link between aba and leaf senescence in rice .
osnap transcripts are not induced by any hormone other than abscisic acid ( aba ) .
the gain - of - function mutant ps1 exhibits significantly premature senescence , in which expression of aba biosynthesis genes is obviously affected .
knockdown of osnap produces an obvious delay of senescence , and most importantly , slowed down the decrease in functional photosynthetic capacity and increased the seed - setting ratio and 1,000 - grain weight12. by contrast , expression of ostzf1 , a member of the ccch - type zinc finger gene family in rice , is induced by multiple factors including drought , high - salt stress , hydrogen peroxide ( h2o2 ) , aba , ja and salicylic acid ( sa ) .
consistent with these findings , rice plants in which overexpression of ostzf1 is driven by a maize ( zea mays ) ubiquitin promoter show pleiotropic phenotypes including delayed seed germination , growth retardation at the seedling stage , delayed leaf senescence , improved tolerance to high - salt and drought stresses , whereas ostzf1 knock - down plants exhibit much the opposite phenotypes13 .
thus , characterization of single sags has provided some insight into the complicated mechanism of leaf senescence .
however , the control of gene expression during rice senescence is still under investigation .
in particular , information regarding senescence - specific cis - elements is very limited .
rice is a major crop that feeds about half of the human population in the world .
flag leaves are postulated to play an especially vital role in transporting nutrients into young panicles .
during the grain - filling period , on one hand , photosynthesis supplies carbon components for the seeds , and on the other hand , the useful nutrition is recycled from the senescent leaves. from either perspective , the senescence of flag leaf serves as a determinant for grain yield14 .
a severe problem in facing rice breeders is premature senescence of leaves , which leads to poor grain quality and yield loss .
understanding the mechanism of flag leaf senescence and elucidating the regulatory network between the signaling pathways is essential for the improvement of grain yield .
minghui 63 is one of the most widely used restorer lines in rice production .
previous studies showed that minghui 63 exhibits not only good grain quality but also strong tolerance of several bacterial blight and blast diseases1516 .
here , we examined gene expression profiles in flag leaves of minghui 63 .
enrichment of transcriptional binding sites and corresponding tfs among differentially expressed genes was discovered and experimentally verified to be important for regulating leaf senescence .
the data set reported herein provides an important resource for elucidating the genetic interactions between senescence signaling and regulatory responses .
the identification of functional cis - elements may contribute to the improvement of the stay - green phenotype in plants .
results genes showing increased or decreased transcript abundance at the onset of flag leaf senescence first , we characterized flag leaf development to select the point of measurement for the transcriptome experiments .
during leaf senescence , chlorophyll complexes are degraded , resulting in the characteristic yellowing phenomenon .
hence , we used chlorophyll levels as a marker for the phase of leaf senescence .
we defined early senescence as the stage in which chlorophyll levels were 80 % - 90 % compared to that in fully expanded green leaves , described as the s1 stage in previous reports41718 .
the expression patterns of several senescence - associated genes is induced at the onset of leaf senescence , and we monitored those genes to examine the flag leaf senescence process at 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 and 25 daf ( days after forming 1 cm length ) .
osl85 , osl381 , osl139 , osh69 , and osl30 were used as examples of senescence - induced genes and cab as an example of a senescence - down regulated gene17 .
sampled leaves were fully expanded at 5 daf , but chlorophyll levels continued to increase until 10 daf and started to drop significantly at 20 daf ( fig. 1a ) .
the senescence marker genes were activated by 20 or 25 daf , whereas the relative transcript levels of cab fell steadily after 10 daf during senescence ( fig. 1b ) .
for example , osl85 and osl381 were first up - regulated , and then declined at late senescence .
osl39 , osh69 and osl30 showed a continued increase from 20 daf until later in senescence .
although these genes increased in expression at different time points , they showed a similar tendency of increased expression at the earlier time points of senescence .
accordingly , we retained all of these data for analysis .
in field conditions , the rice plants start to head around 10 daf .
based on these results , flag leaf samples were collected at two critical stages , 5 days before heading and 14 days after heading , for data mining of early senescence - associated factors .
affymetrix genechip arrays , which contain 57382 dna oligonucleotide probe sets representing about 30000 genes per chip , were used to assay changes in the rice transcriptome in response to flag leaf senescence19 .
overall , around 3000 genes showed up - regulation and 8000 genes showed down - regulation during senescence ( http :// crep.ncpgr.cn ) .
gene ontology ( go ) analysis was used to evaluate the functional categories of genes regulated during senescence ( supplementary fig. s1 and table s1 ) .
tfs were extracted from the data for further analysis .
w - box and the g - box are overrepresented in promoters of coexpressed genes increasing evidence indicates that genes with the similar expression patterns may contain the same regulatory elements in their promoters5 .
accordingly , we analyzed the promoters of the up - regulated genes to identify potential tf - binding motifs important for activating flag leaf senescence .
promoters corresponding to 1 kb upstream of the predicted transcription start site of genes were screened using a new method20 .
two known tf binding motifs , the w - box and the g - box , were found to be significantly enriched in promoters of up - regulated genes ( supplementary table s2 and table 1 ) .
we sought to confirm the potential functional role of these motifs in leaf early senescence .
thus , we initially performed a gel shift mobility assay that involved incubating a 24 - bp probe with nuclear extracts from green leaves and early senescent leaves .
as shown clearly in fig. 2a , the w - box was bound only by nuclear extracts from senescent leaves , while the g - box was bound to a greater degree by nuclear extracts of senescent leaves than by extracts of young leaves .
the gel shift assays thus provided evidence that w - box and g - box elements may function to mediate the early senescence - induced expression in rice flag leaves .
to further analyze the potential activity of these elements during senescence , we generated fusions of four cis - element copies to the camv35s minimal promoter to drive expression of the beta - glucuronidase ( gus ) reporter gene .
four copies of the elements were used to ensure that the expression would be strong enough to be detectable by gus staining .
we carried out gus activity assays during natural senescence of transgenic rice containing the fusions .
both elements showed little background activity in leaves , whereas gus activity of the w - box fusion was induced 10 - fold , and that of the g - box fusion 3 - fold , by leaf senescence ( fig. 2 ) .
these results suggest that w - box and g - box elements play important roles in the network regulating flag leaf senescence processes in vivo .
effect of element combination in leaf senescence we constructed a series of synthetic promoters with gus reporter in the backbone of pcambia 1301 .
the promoters carried 1 x g - box , 1 x w - box , 1 x w - box with 3 x g - box , 2 x w - box with 2 x g - box or 3 x w - box with 1 x g - box .
each promoter containing a camv35s minimal promoter was used to test the activities of these combinations .
empty vector carrying only the camv35s minimum promoter fused to gus was used as a control .
synthetic promoter - driven gus reporter gene activity was monitored in transgenic rice during natural senescence .
the plants carrying one single element gave low gus activity during natural senescence .
interestingly , three copies of the w - box enhanced promoter expression by 6.7 - and 5.6 - fold compared to one and two copies of the w - box , respectively , even though background expression was apparent ( fig. 3 ) .
these results indicate that more copies of the w - box led to greater promoter activity .
the highest induction of expression was obtained with 3 x w - box combined with 1 x g - box .
taken together , both w - box and g - box elements contribute to the overall expression of senescence - responsive genes and the w - box may play dominant role in response to natural senescence .
wrky , bzip , bhlh and nac families significantly overrepresented in flag leaf senescence data in general , signaling networks involve cis - elements working with their cognate tfs .
this raised the question of whether the tfs regulated during flag leaf senescence were consistent with the discovery of the early senescence - responsive cis - elements in our study .
to address this question , tf families were extracted from among the differentially expressed genes based on their conserved domains .
there were 258 up - regulated and 377 down - regulated genes encoding tfs including members of the wrky , bzip , nac , myb , and bhlh families ( supplementary table s3 and fig. 4 ) .
the largest group among the up - regulated tfs comprised 47 genes encoding wrky proteins , which are generally considered as w - box binding factors .
this group included oswrky42 , which positively activates leaf senescence .
among the down - regulated tf genes were 11 belonging to the wrky family .
thus , the wrky family genes were significantly overrepresented in the flag leaf senescence data set , an observation that is in agreement with our data demonstrating that the w - box plays important role in senescence response regulation .
the g - box serves as a binding site for bzip , bhlh and nac tfs21 .
genes for 33 nac , 11 bzip and 19 bhlh were enriched among the up - regulated gene pool , while those for 20 nac , 11 bzip and 28 bhlh were enriched in the down - regulated gene pool .
these three families of proteins composed the dominant group among overrepresented tfs .
this suggests that g - box functions as a critical site for regulation in leaf senescence .
analyses of wrky , bzip , bhlh and nac in hormone responses leaf senescence involves crosstalk with hormone signaling .
to investigate the potential relationship between flag leaf early senescence and hormone signaling , we surveyed the responses of tf genes to abscisic acid ( aba ) , brassinosteroid ( br ) , cytokinin ( ctk ) , auxin , ja and ga using data from ricexpro22 ( supplementary table s4 and fig. 5 ) .
among the tf families overrepresented in our set of differentially regulated genes , we focused on wrky , bzip , bhlh and nac families .
the resulting clustering showed that the four tf families were affected by various hormones to varying degrees .
the tf families could be divided into several groups according to their expression patterns : 4 groups of wrky genes , 3 groups for bzip , 4 groups for bhlh , and 2 groups for nac family members ( fig. 5 ) .
group 1 of the wrky family was highly induced by ga and ja , while wrky groups 2 and 3 were induced by aba , auxin and ja. group 4 of wrky was induced by br and ja. almost 90 % of wrky members were inhibited by ctk .
interestingly in the bzip , bhlh and nac families , members were induced by aba , and often also induced by ja. the expression data indicate that ga and ctk are not very strong effectors for these three families .
previously reported rice sags were also found in this study to be related to various hormone - regulated pathways .
for example , senescence positive regulator oswrky42 ( loc _ os02g26430 ) was markedly induced by aba and ja ( han et al. 2014 ) .
osnap ( loc _ os03g21060 ) was induced by aba , auxin and ja1223 .
our results demonstrate that aba , br and ctk - mediated signaling might converge on the same tfs .
discussion applying a novel bioinformatics algorithm , we here demonstrated on a genome - wide scale that w - box and g - box elements are significantly enriched in promoters of early senescence - inducible genes in rice flag leaf .
their related binding factors , wrky , bzip , bhlh and nac family members , were overrepresented among genes differentially expressed in response to senescence .
among the up - regulated genes during senescence were previously identified defense - activated genes in rice or homologs of those from other species , such as oswrky13 , oswrky42 , atwrky8 , and wrky5242526 ( see supplementary table s5 for known rice sags ) .
in most cases , wrky family tfs play a central role in the defense signaling hierarchy272829 .
w - boxes are profoundly enriched in plant defense and drought resistance signaling genes2530 .
there are also several examples in arabidopsis of wrky proteins related to senescence .
high expression of the wrky6 tf gene leads to leaf necrosis through activating a senescence - induced receptor kinase31 .
wrky53 - overexpressing plants exhibit premature senescence , whereas wrky53 mutants show delayed senescence32 .
it is plausible that w - box and wrky superfamily members might function in activating leaf senescence , given that they widely participate in plant abiotic and biotic stress responses .
leaf senescence and stress responses share a common characteristic of involving cell death .
it is possible that plant defense , salt stress , or drought stress activates cell death signaling .
another important cis - element , the g - box , has been described to participate in light - responsive processes3334 .
g - box elements are mainly present in promoters of light - responsive genes , whether positively or negatively regulated , such as rbcs , chs and cab35 .
g - box related binding factors are generally found to be members of bzip , bhlh and nac families34 .
although there is much evidence demonstrating a role of phytochromes in the regulation of leaf senescence , the light - dependent signaling pathway is poorly understood .
in arabidopsis and petroselinum crispum ( parsley ) , bzip proteins serve as regulators in uv and blue light - mediated photomorphogenesis3536 .
bzip16 and bzip68 can form heterodimers with gbf1 ( also a bzip member ) and generate light signaling outputs37 .
interestingly , the onset of leaf senescence is delayed in the arabidopsis gbf1 mutant , clearly indicating a regulatory function of gbf1 in leaf senescence38 .
several nac and bhlh family members have been reported to regulate senescence .
in arabidopsis , atnap39 , ore1 / onac09240 , and nac01641 promote leaf senescence .
the bhlh tfs phytochrome - interacting factors ( pifs ) 3 , 4 and 5 are early senescence genes and induce leaf senescence by activating ethylene and aba signaling4243 .
a recent study demonstrated that arabidopsis bhlh tfs myc2 , myc3 , and myc4 redundantly activate ja - induced leaf senescence via binding to g - box - like motifs ( aacgtg and cacgta ) in the sag29 promoter44 .
in rice , osnap1223 positively regulate leaf senescence by regulating hormone biosynthesis - related genes .
in soybean , photoexcited cryptochrome2 ( cry2a ) physically interacts with cib1 ( a bhlh tf ) , thereby repressing the binding activity of cib1 to the e - box ( canntg ) in the wrky53b promoter , and negatively regulating leaf senescence45 .
these studies are in accordance with our results that light and flag leaf senescence signaling might converge at the g - box , and suggest that bzip , bhlh and nac tfs might function as upstream regulators at the transcription level .
considering that natural senescence is a complex trait resulting from the synergy of leaf development and environmental factors , it is not surprising that light - responsive bzip , bhlh and nac members and the corresponding g - box binding sites were highly enriched among natural senescence - associated genes .
natural senescence is a highly - regulated process in which the activation of signaling pathways involves the stress - related plant hormone aba4647 .
in arabidopsis , aba levels in leaves significantly increase at the onset of leaf senescence , with a subsequent increase to a maximum at late senescence5 .
it has been shown that aba inhibits br effects in response to abiotic stress48 , whereas br and ctk have positive interactions to mediate plant defense49 .
w - box and g - box elements both showed higher binding intensity during senescence , as well as senescence inducibility in vivo and in vitro ( fig. 3 ) .
these findings suggest that w - box and g - box elements play important roles in the regulated pathway of activating leaf senescence .
their related tfs were highly induced by aba and ja , moderately induced by ctk and br ( fig. 5 ) .
moreover , ctk has been shown to activate drought resistance or delay leaf senescence in many plant species , although br has seldom been linked to senescence5051 .
in our study , up - regulated genes included a putative aba - response gene and a gene encoding a cytokinin oxidase , but no putative br - related genes ( supplementary table s1 ) .
furthermore , genes up - regulated during leaf senescence are often responsive to both ja and aba at the same time , indicating an interesting crosstalk between these two hormone - signaling pathways ( fig. 5 ) .
in addition , our results demonstrating crosstalk between ja responses and leaf senescence are consistent with recent studies in arabidopsis44 and rice23 .
together , our findings suggest that hormone mediation of flag leaf senescence might occur through w - box and g - box elements .
a large number of plant cis - elements were discovered in arabidopsis thaliana on the basis of gene expression patterns under multiple stresses .
the copy number , location and combinatorial relationships of cis - elements can significantly affect the transcription of salt - responsive genes52 .
in addition , positioning an element closer to the tata box can result in changes in promoter strength , although there is little effect on inducibility53 .
the best pathogen - inducible synthetic promoters reported consist of combinations of low copy numbers of defined cis - acting elements because they often combine good inducibility with low background53 .
however , the regulation of leaf senescence is quite complicated , and no data have been reported on the influence of cis - element combinations in the process until now .
as shown in fig. 4 , the promoter with three copies of the w - box was the most induced by natural senescence compared with those with other copy numbers of w - box or g - box elements .
in arabidopsis , w - boxes and a range of cis - element combinations were also activated in pathogen - and wound - induced signaling , suggesting that w - box - mediated signaling is largely conserved even in different stress responses53 .
here , we have provided direct evidence that w - box and g - box elements can combine to mediate senescence signaling .
combination of the two cis - elements enhanced the expression of the gus reporter gene .
it was previously reported that two copies of the w - box had the greatest pathogen - specific inducibility compared to one , four , and eight copies in transient assays , even though increasing the number of copies of w - box increased the strength of the promoter53 .
these results are different from our findings , but this is perhaps not surprising because even the same individual element can behave differently in different combinations in response to stress52 .
compared to native promoters containing cis - elements responsible for responsiveness to a broad range of stimuli , synthetic promoters are well defined and function more directly ; moreover , the corresponding binding factors are predictable .
our findings highlight that we still have room to improve combinations of cis - elements to increase the efficiency of synthetic promoters for use in multiple purposes .
this report represents a first genome - wide look at cis - elements in flag leaf senescence including their combinatorial relationships and crosstalk with hormone signaling .
w - box and g - box elements were discovered likely to be responsible for activating flag leaf senescence .
our results represent a significant step toward understanding the mechanism underlying plant flag leaf senescence and elucidate potential targets for enhancement of stay - green traits in crops .

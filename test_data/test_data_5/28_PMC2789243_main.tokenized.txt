2009 elsevier b.v.open access under cc by 3.0 license the enzyme myristoyl - coa : protein n - myristoyltransferase ( nmt ) catalyses the co - translational covalent attachment of the fatty acid myristate to the n - terminus of target proteins .
nmt is known to be essential for viability in trypanosoma brucei and leishmania major .
here we describe phenotypic analysis of t. brucei bloodstream form cells following knockdown of nmt expression by tetracycline - inducible rna interference .
cell death occurs from 72 h post - induction , with approximately 50 % of cells displaying a defect in endocytic uptake by this time .
the majority of these induced cells do not have an enlarged flagellar pocket typical of a block in endocytosis but vesicle accumulation around the flagellar pocket indicates a defect in vesicular progression following endocytic fusion .
induced parasites have a wild - type or slightly enlarged golgi apparatus , unlike the phenotype of cells with reduced expression of a major n - myristoylated protein , arl1 .
critically we show that following nmt knockdown , t. brucei bloodstream form cells are unable to establish an infection in a mouse model , therefore providing further validation of this enzyme as a target for drug development .

the enzyme catalysing this co - translational process is myristoyl - coa : protein n - myristoyltransferase ( nmt ) .
we previously reported that nmt is essential for viability in the protozoan parasites leishmania major ( by gene targeting via homologous recombination ) and trypanosoma brucei ( by rna interference , rnai ) [ 2 ] and is thus a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics [ 3 ] .
in a proof - of - principle study , two compounds with activity against fungal nmts were able to inhibit purified t. brucei nmt in vitro and severely compromise growth of the bloodstream form ( bsf ) of the parasite in culture [ 3 ] .
here , we present more extensive characterisation of the phenotype observed following knockdown of nmt expression in bsf t. brucei , both in vitro and in an in vivo infection model , providing further validation for tbnmt as a putative drug target .
rnai knockdown in bloodstream form t. brucei decreases nmt - specific transcripts to 57 % of the original level by 4 h post - induction , as measured by real time pcr ( data not shown ) .
no further reduction is seen by 24 h post - induction .
loss of nmt protein occurs by 72 h post - induction , at which time there is a decrease to 16 % of the original level .
this time correlates with the onset of cell death in both procyclic and bloodstream forms of the parasite [ 2 ] .
the data presented here reveal no dominant effects on progression through the cell cycle in rnai treated cells , with only a minor accumulation (< 5 %) of cells with abnormal kinetoplast : nucleus configurations by 96 h post - induction ( fig. 1a ) .
there is a marked increase in the number of round and tear - shaped cells , peaking at 84 h post - induction ( 14 % and 9 % , respectively ) .
however , the majority of cells show no gross morphological abnormalities during the time course studied ( fig. 1b ) .
the survival of bsf trypanosomes depends on the correct functioning of extremely rapid transport mechanisms , for which at least two n - myristoylated proteins , tbarl1 and tbarf1 , are known to be required [ 4,5 ] .
therefore , specific trafficking events have been analysed in detail in the nmt - depleted cells. t. brucei bsf are able to internalise the lectin concanavalin a ( cona ) at the flagellar pocket membrane via receptor - mediated endocytosis , trafficking the lectin through the endocytic system before it reaches the terminal lysosome .
following nmt knockdown , the proportion of cells defective in the uptake of cona increases steadily ( fig. 1c and d ) reaching approximately 50 % by 72 h post - induction .
in contrast , the glycoprotein p67 is clearly detectable in the lysosome , suggesting no gross defect in er - golgi - lysosome trafficking ( fig. 1d ) .
the transport of newly synthesised variant surface glycoprotein ( vsg ) from the er onto the plasma membrane , measured by its ability to be released in a soluble form by osmotic shock [ 6,7 ] , appears to be unaffected by nmt depletion ( fig. 1e ) .
however , the total incorporation of radioactivity into rnai - induced cells as measured by densitometry is 25 % of that seen for the control cells ( fig. 1e , data not shown ) , indicating a decrease in protein synthesis , which could in turn mask a defect in this transport pathway .
electron microscopy shows that rnai - induced parasites have a normal or slightly enlarged golgi apparatus ( 68 % normal size and 32 % enlarged , n = 50 cells where the golgi was visible ) ( fig. 1g - i ) compared to the parental cell line ( fig. 1f ) .
many cells also exhibited an accumulation of vesicles around the flagellar pocket ( fig. 1j and k ) .
four or more vesicles were found around the flagellar pocket of 72 % of induced cells , compared to less than 10 % of cells from the parental line ( n = 50 cells where the flagellar pocket was visible ) .
this observation suggests that cargo can be internalised but is not being appropriately transported from the flagellar pocket to the endocytic system .
therefore these data support the proposal that loss of nmt affects proteins required for vesicular progression rather than the endocytic fusion event .
bioinformatic analysis predicts the presence of approximately 60 putative n - myristoylated proteins encoded by the t. brucei genome [ 8 ] .
the depletion of nmt is therefore likely to have pleiotropic effects , influencing several divergent pathways and functions .
the phenotype presented here differs significantly from that seen following knockdown of the essential n - myristoylated small gtpases , tbarf1 and tbarl1 in bsf [ 4,5 ] .
loss of each of these causes the appearance of multinucleated cells prior to death , indicative of a defect in cytokinesis followed by unchecked cell cycle progression .
knockdown of tbarl1 in bsf cells results in disintegration of the golgi apparatus , accumulation of vesicles and multivesicular bodies in the cytosol and an apparent defect in the transport of vsg to the cell surface [ 4 ] .
although arf1 is a key component of the secretory system in other eukaryotes , rnai of the arf1 orthologue in t. brucei bsf results in the ' big eye ' phenotype .
this was first described in cells following knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain [ 9 ] , in which a block in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( but ongoing exocytosis ) correlated with the appearance of rounded cells displaying gross enlargement of the flagellar pocket .
the big eye phenotype is not evident in the majority of nmt - depleted cells , possibly because the defect in uptake in these cells occurs following endocytic fusion .
the effects of nmt depletion have also been tested in vivo in a rodent model .
due to the observed lack of virulence of our 90 - 13 cell lines , it was necessary to produce a new nmt rnai cell line derived from bsf lister 427 .
the in vitro growth kinetics of these new parasites post - induction ( fig. 2a ) are very similar to the original nmt rnai cell line [ 2 ] , with an initial decrease in growth rate compared to uninduced cells , followed by the onset of cell death by 72 h. following the induction of rnai for only 24 h , t. brucei bsf are severely compromised in their ability to establish an infection in balb / c mice ( fig. 2 ) .
no induced parasites can be detected in the sera of infected mice at any time during the 4 - day infection ( with the figures plotted in fig. 2b at the lower limit of detection for undiluted sera , corresponding to the maximum possible parasitaemia in these mice ) .
the molecular mechanism leading to this inability to establish in the mammalian host is unknown , but defects in vsg trafficking are likely to play a major role in this effect .
nmt has been shown to be an essential protein in many eukaryotic cells , including saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 10 ] , cryptococcus neoformans [ 11 ] , candida albicans [ 12 ] , caenorhabditis elegans , drosophila [ 13 ] and mammals [ 14,15 ] .
a gel shift assay was employed to demonstrate loss of n - myristoylation of the highly conserved gtpase arf1 in c. albicans following disruption of nmt function by treatment with inhibitory compounds [ 16 ] .
as arf1 is a vital component of the secretory pathway and n - myristoylation is crucial for the correct localisation of this molecule , this effect alone may be sufficient to cause lethality .
however , as approximately 0.5 % of eukaryotic proteins have a putative n - myristoylation motif [ 1 ] , the effects of nmt depletion are likely to be significantly more widespread .
null mutation of the single nmt gene in drosophila causes disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and ectopic apoptosis in embryos , possibly attributed to loss of function of myristoylated tyrosine kinases [ 13 ] , which are absent from the t. brucei proteome .
mammalian genomes encode two related but distinct nmt isoforms , nmt1 and nmt2 ( 77 % identity ) which are differentially regulated during development .
nmt1 is the dominant isoform expressed during early embryogenesis in mice and is essential for viability during this period [ 14 ] .
analysis of heterozygous knockout mice revealed that nmt1 is required for monocytic differentiation of bone marrow cells [ 17 ] .
knockdown of either of the two human nmt isoforms results in an increase in apoptosis due to altered regulation of the bcl2 family of proteins [ 15 ] .
in this current study , we have characterised the effects of nmt depletion on the unicellular trypanosome , demonstrating that loss of this protein results in a defect in endocytic uptake , generating parasites that are severely compromised in their ability to infect the mammalian host .
as n - myristoylation is a critical process in eukaryotes , the identification of highly specific inhibitors will be paramount to the successful development of new therapeutics targeted to the t. brucei nmt enzyme .

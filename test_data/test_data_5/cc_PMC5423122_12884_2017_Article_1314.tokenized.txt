background actions to prevent early onset disease in neonates are based on different strategies including administering antibiotic prophylaxis during labour in case of 1 ) maternal gbs colonisation ( screening strategy ) , 2 ) identified risk factors ( risk - based strategy ) or 3 ) a combination of these two conditions ( maternal gbs colonisation and identified risk factors : combination strategy and the dutch guideline ) .
low adherence to guidelines preventing eogbs has been reported .
each strategy has drawbacks and clinical outcomes are affected by care providers' and women 's adherence .
the actual impact of any preventive strategy is the product of efficacy of the strategy and the level of implementation .
in order to reduce neonatal death due to eogbs by developing the optimal guideline , we analysed barriers and facilitators of current used strategies .
methods focus group and personal interviews with care providers and women were performed .
impeding and enhancing factors in adherence to the preventive strategies were discussed and scored using the measurement instrument for determinants of innovations ( midi ) and analysed by two independent researchers .
results overall , care providers identified 3.6 times more factors that would impede ( n = 116 ) rather than facilitate ( n = 32 ) adherence to the preventive strategies .
28 % facilitative factors were reported in relation to the combination strategy and 86 % impeding factors in relation to the dutch guideline .
the most preferred strategy was the combination strategy by 74 % of the care providers and by 86 % of the women .
discussion we obtained a detailed understanding of factors that influence adherence to preventive strategies .
this insight can be used to develop implementation activities to improve the uptake of new strategies .
trial registration the trial is registered in the dutch trial register ntr3965 .

keywords determinant analysis early - onset group b streptococcus guidelines implementation prevention http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100001826zonmw200320008issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background although early - onset group b haemolytic streptococcus disease ( eogbs ) is rare ( incidence of 0.019 [ 1 ] - 0.0.043 [ 2 ]%) , it remains an important cause of perinatal mortality and long - term morbidity for the neonate and child [ 3 , 4 ] .
the main cause of neonatal infection in the first week of life is by vertical transmission of the group b haemolytic streptococcus ( gbs ) during delivery .
primary prevention of eogbs is achievable with intra - partum antibiotic prophylaxis ( iap ) for women who are gbs carriers [ 5 ] .
different preventive strategies are currently used based on identifying women at risk , either by screening for gbs colonisation and / or by identifying risk factors for eogbs .
risk factors include a previous child with eogbs and risk factors in the current pregnancy including group b streptococcal ( gbs ) bacteriuria , intra - partum fever ( temperature of or over 38.0 degreesc ) , preterm birth ( defined as before 37 weeks ) and / or pre - labour rupture of membranes ( more than 18 hours ) .
the four different preventive eogbs strategies are ( table 1 ) : the screening strategy , in which a vaginal rectal swab to detect gbs is taken at 35 - 37 weeks of gestation .
all gbs - colonised women or women with unknown gbs status receive iap .
this strategy is not used in the netherlands .
the risk - based strategy .
all women with one or more of the risk factors mentioned above receive iap .
the combination strategy , in which a vaginal rectal swab to detect gbs is taken at 35 - 37 weeks of gestation .
women with both conditions : gbs colonisation and one or more of the above mentioned risk factors are treated with iap , women with gbs colonisation without a risk factor are not treated with iap .
the dutch guideline , based on the risk - based strategy prescribes iap for women with a previous child with eogbs , group b streptococcal bacteriuria during current pregnancy ( only determined in symptomatic women ) or intra - partum fever [ 6 ] .
vaginal rectal swabs to detect gbs ( by culture ) are taken in case of preterm birth or pre - labour membrane rupture and iap is given if gbs colonisation is established .
if no test result is available during labour application of iap is predominantly based on clinical observation including fever .

strategies are not fully effective by themselves and have drawbacks which may result in non - adherence by both care providers and women .
for example : over 40 % of neonates who develop eogbs are born to mothers without a risk factor [ 8 , 9 ] ( risk - based strategy , combination strategy and dutch guideline ) , the sensitivity of the methods to detect gbs in pregnant women is low and accounts for a consistent proportion of eogbs cases [ 9 - 12 ] ( risk - based strategy , screening strategy and the dutch guideline ) , large numbers of women receiving antibiotics ( screening strategy ) with possible negative side - effects such as antibiotic resistance [ 9 ] ( based on the difference between application of antibiotics to all gbs colonized women or to a selection of gbs colonized women with a risk factor ) and premature cases are missed , because the current gbs screening starts from 35 weeks of gestation onward ( screening strategy and combination strategy ) .
another problem with low adherence to the preventive strategies is that a substantial proportion of women will not receive the intended care or even receive unnecessary care and this affects outcomes in women and their children [ 13 ]. from a socio - economic perspective the cost - effectiveness of the four preventive strategies was compared in a theoretical model in 2005 [ 14 ] assuming 100 % adherence by care providers and women .
the risk - based strategy and the combination strategy had the most favourable cost - effectiveness ratios ; the screening strategy was the most clinically effective , but the least cost - effective .
however , low adherence to guidelines preventing eogbs is reported elsewhere and there seems to be a need for strategies to improve adoption of eogbs guidelines [ 7 , 15 , 16 ] .
the actual impact of any preventive strategy is the product of efficacy of the strategy and the level of implementation .
the actual implementation of innovations , ( in this study the different preventive strategies perceived as new by the care providers and women ) is maximised if they are introduced systematically [ 17 - 20 ] .
determinants affecting the implementation of innovations can be broken down depending on their association with a. preventive strategy ( e.g. procedural clarity ) , b. the potential user of the preventive strategy ( e.g. knowledge ) , c. the organisational context of the user ( e.g. financial resources , staff turnover ) and d. the socio - political context ( e.g. legislation ) [ 18 , 21 ] .
a detailed understanding of these determinants can guide the process of designing implementation strategies that will have the potential to produce actual change [ 18 - 20 ] .
the aim of this study ( part of a larger study that examines the most cost - effective prevention strategy on the basis of efficacy and feasibility in daily practice ) is to assess the determinants that will influence the implementation of four preventive strategies for eogbs among care providers and women [ 22 ] .
methods setting the dutch maternity care system uses a stratified care model with different professional care providers at different risk levels .
midwives working in primary care are the main group of caregivers in low - risk pregnancies .
obstetricians and hospital based midwives take care of medium - or high risk pregnancies .
the agreements for collaboration between the professional groups have been specified in the obstetric manual [ 23 ] .
this document includes a list of obstetric indications for referral from primary to secondary care setting .
care path ways are organized in obstetric collaboration groups ( ocgs ) .
an ocg is organized around a hospital and consists of midwives , obstetricians and pediatricians .
the ocgs make agreements about the regional organization of maternity care and interdisciplinary collaboration .
participants and design determinants of the uptake of the strategies were studied in both care providers and women ( pregnant and postpartum ) .
in case of the dutch guideline these were perceived determinants , compared to anticipated determinants in the other strategies .
ocgs in the netherlands were asked to participate in a focus group interview .
microbiologists were interviewed in person on specific topics considering the logistics of culture sampling .
women were recruited in midwifery practices throughout the netherlands by their midwives and the dutch foundation parents of group b streptococcus patients ( ogbs ) was approached by one of the researchers .
semi - structured interviews were chosen to let the participants talk frankly .
the main topics for the care provider interviews were : a. screening for gbs colonization or identifying risk factors , b. treatment of the woman , c. treatment of the child and d. the most preferred strategy ( additional file 1 ) .
the key activities in all preventive strategies ( table 1 ) guided the content of the interviews , supported by a list of potentially relevant determinants ( associated with the preventive strategy , the care provider or woman , the organizational context and the socio - political context ) [ 18 , 21 ] .
the main topic for the interviews with women were : a. the most preferred strategy , b. preferences in taking a swab , c. information to be provided about gbs , d. impact of test results on anxiety , preferred place of birth and observation of the child ( additional file 2 ) .
prior to the interviews care providers and women received information on the different preventive strategies and the interview questions by letter or e - mail .
two moderators guided the group interviews .
the individual interviews were conducted by one moderator .
the interviews continued until no additional information was gathered during subsequent interviews .
all interviews were audio taped and summarized in a report which was depersonalized .
the report was sent to the participants to verify and add information .
analysis the transcribed interviews of the care providers and women were subjected to deductive analysis .
the first focus group interview with care providers generated a list of quotations of impeding and enhancing determinants .
this list was extended with new mentioned determinants in subsequent interviews .
all identified impeding or enhancing factors were scored according to 29 determinants described in the measurement instrument for determinants of innovations [ 21 ] and categorised in the four domains : the guideline , the intermediary user ( the care provider ) , the organisational context and socio - political context .
all interviews were independently analysed by two researchers .
inconsistencies were resolved by consensus and ( if necessary ) by consulting a third person .
the interviews with women were analysed alike and identified impeding and enhancing factors which could not be categorised in the four domains mentioned above .
a fifth domain was added : determinants related to the end - user ( the woman ) .
results participants five focus group interviews ( four with care providers and one with women ) and 12 personal interviews ( two with care providers and 10 with women ) were held in the period june until october 2011 .
twenty - seven care providers from different settings were interviewed in the focus group meetings which were held in four regions in the netherlands , the participating care providers and their settings can be seen in table 2 .
two microbiologists were interviewed in person .

seven women were of dutch origin .
the other countries of origin were hungary , bosnia , morocco , suriname and turkey .
the educational level of seven women was high , of five women medium / low and of two women unknown .
one woman was not pregnant , but mother of a child with long term eogbs complications .
the median week of gestation of the pregnant women was 34 ( range : 26 - 38 ) ; eight women were nulliparous and six multiparous of which one had an experience with gbs in a previous pregnancy .
seven women preferred a home birth , five preferred a hospital birth and of two this was unknown .
determinants mentioned by the care providers the determinants associated with screening for gbs colonization or identifying risk factors ( table 3 ) , treatment of the woman ( table 4 ) and treatment of the child ( table 5 ) show a wide variety between the four strategies .
looking at all three tables together , most determinants were reported for the combination strategy ( n = 53 ) and the screening strategy ( n = 49 ) , followed by the risk - based strategy ( n = 25 ) and the dutch guideline ( n = 21 ) .
the determinants were 3.6 times more often ( 116 times ) reported as impeding than they were reported as facilitating ( 32 times ) .
most determinants were associated with the user ( n = 71 ) , followed by the guideline itself ( n = 39 ) , the organisational context ( n = 34 ) and the socio - political context ( n = 4 ) .

2 the numbers in each row reflect how many issues related to the determinant were mentioned by the care providers because key activities were discussed in detail , it became apparent that some participants were not fully aware about the content of the dutch guideline and many recommendations in the current guideline lacked procedural clarity .
for example , the definition of a previous child with eogbs was unclear and there was no standard procedure for pre - labour rupture of membranes ( referral after 18 , 24 , or more than 24 hours ) .
it also became apparent that the guideline was not fully adhered to in many cases , due to other determinants as described in the tables 3 , 4 , and 5 .
looking closely at the determinants mentioned for screening or identifying risk factors ( table 3 ) , it becomes clear that care providers acknowledged the limitations of a swab taken during delivery .
they did not anticipate logistic problems taking a swab in pregnancy although they expected it to be time - consuming , specifically because of anticipated anxiety by women .
care providers expected that although women might prefer the assurance of a swab taken they would dislike it because of discomfort. with respect to treatment of the woman , table 4 shows that routine antibiotics in case of carrier status was expected to result in overtreatment , negative side effects such as an increase in antibiotic resistance , medicalization of birth and a decrease of the choices of women to opt for home birth .
as for the treatment of the child ( table 5 ) care providers differed in their opinion on the duration of and preferred place for observation of a child after a risk factor or gbs carrier status of the mother .
after having discussed the four strategies in detail , 74 % ( 20 of 27 ) of the care providers felt that the combination strategy would be the most preferred strategy to be introduced .
according to the care providers this strategy has the optimum in numbers needed to treat and is the most cost - effective one .
the screening strategy was seen as most effective in preventing eogbs .
however , it was the least favorite because of the expected negative side effects , overtreatment and increase in antibiotic resistance ( highest numbers needed to treat ) .
most of the interviewed care providers ( 89 % , 24 of 27 ) advised negatively on the implementation of this strategy .
determinants mentioned by the women asked for the strategy the women preferred most , 12 ( 12 of 14 , 86 %) women said the combination strategy ; one woman ( 1 of 14 , 7 %) preferred the dutch guideline and one ( 7 %) the screening strategy .
three women ( 3 of 14 , 21 %) who preferred the combination strategy considered the dutch guideline second best .
four women ( 4 of 14 , 29 %) spontaneously mentioned not to participate in the screening strategy .
the main reasons for choosing or declining a strategy were : risk of over treatment ( n = 13 of 14 , 93 %) , negative effects for the woman or the child ( n = 3 , 21 %) , ability of early treatment in case of gbs positive woman ( n = 1 , 7 %) and costs ( n = 1 , 7 %) .
the vast majority of women ( n = 13 , 93 %) had no objection at all to taking a swab and were even prepared to pay for the test themselves , if necessary .
a swab taken by the professional was the primary choice of most women ( n = 12 of 14 , 86 %) , because of the expected better outcomes and physical difficulties if performed by themselves .
regarding the information to be provided about gbs , most women ( n = 13 , 93 %) wanted to receive general information about gbs in the first half of the pregnancy , preferably through a leaflet or on a website .
being personally informed was not deemed necessary .
however , positive test results should be communicated in person ( n = 14 , 100 %) .
five women ( 5 of 14 , 36 %) anticipated anxiety after a positive test result .
eight women ( 8 of 14 , 57 %) did not anticipate anxiety because treatment is possible and the risk of a sick child was estimated to be low .
the women expected their preferred place of birth not to change because of a gbs carrier status .
five women ( 36 %) expressed explicitly that the choice for place of birth should always be the woman 's decision .
the preferred place for observing the child in case of gbs carrier status without a risk factor was in almost all cases equal to their preferred place of birth .
women expressed faith in their care providers to guide them adequately .
women who preferred their child to be observed at home also expressed that they were capable to do so and could take responsibility .
discussion the present study shows that many determinants are anticipated to influence the implementation of preventive strategies for eogbs .
overall respondents identified more factors that would impede rather than facilitate their introduction .
care providers and women did basically not differ with respect to the most or less preferred strategy , but they unanimously felt the screening strategy should not be introduced because of the expected negative side effects , i.e. overtreatment and increase in antibiotic resistance .
in the netherlands , there is a restrictive policy regarding application of antibiotics .
application of the screening strategy increases the exposure to antibiotics .
however , care providers and women have a different view on some determinants .
care providers anticipated non - cooperation from women in taking a swab because women will dislike this , while nearly all women reported to have no problem at all with taking a swab .
furthermore , care providers assume the test results will increase anxiety in women .
this is certainly not applicable for all the interviewed women .
also , impeding determinants were reported in adherence to the dutch guideline .
it is noteworthy that care providers deviated from the key recommendations in many cases either because they were not familiar with them , or because they interpreted the recommendations in their own way in case of procedural unclarity .
this means that the uptake of the current guideline could benefit from new implementation activities .
if knowledge on the specifics of the guidelines ( different strategies ) is low and no uniformity in the utilization of the guidelines is achieved prevention of eogbs will not increase .
our study is limited in some respects .
the numbers of care providers and women we interviewed are relatively small .
yet , data saturation was reached during the last interviews suggesting these numbers are sufficient .
this does not rule out that the respondents may not have been representative of all care providers or women .
our research gives insight in the determinants that affect the uptake of the preventive strategies , in 48 % associated with the user ( e.g. knowledge ) and in 26 % with the guideline itself ( e.g. procedural clarity ) .
since the study is part of a larger study with the aim to examine the most cost - effective prevention strategy on the basis of both efficacy and feasibility in daily practice [ 22 ] , the next step is to accommodate these determinants into implementation strategies .
looking at the determinants that are associated with the preventive strategies , we must first clarify some recommendations and provide answers to assumed incorrectness of other recommendations .
furthermore , we will fine - tune the patient brochures that we used in the present study for providing information about the preventive strategies .
determinants related to the care provider will be addressed in a training that is ' obliged ' for all care providers in the pilot regions .
this training will focus on the knowledge and skills needed to be able to perform the allocated preventive strategy .
in general , determinants related to the organisational or socio - political context are more difficult to change .
looking at the determinants mentioned in the present study , some can be solved by redesigning the logistics of the care process in the hospital .
others can be solved by making clear agreements in the ocg between all care providers , such as on timely data exchange .
determinants like reimbursement or available time are difficult to address within the project , but will be part of the cost - effectiveness study .
conclusion in summary , this study gives a detailed understanding of the determinants that influence adherence to the dutch guideline and the anticipated determinants if the screening strategy , risk - based strategy or the combination strategy are introduced .
as both the care providers and women advised negatively , the screening strategy is not likely to be introduced .
the preventive strategies will be introduced and studied in three pilot regions ; we will adapt the implementation activities for the introduction of the strategies according to the specific determinants found in the present study .

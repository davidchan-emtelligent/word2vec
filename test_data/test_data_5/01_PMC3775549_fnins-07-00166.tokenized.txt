the existence of the teneurin c - terminal associated peptides ( tcap ) was reported in 2004 after screening a rainbow trout hypothalamic cdna for corticotropin - releasing factor ( crf ) - related homologs .
in vertebrates , there are four tcap paralogs , where each peptide is associated with a teneurin transmembrane protein .
the tcaps are 40 or 41 amino acids in length and possess less than 20 % residue identity with the crf family of paralogs .
orthologs of tcap are found in all metazoans with the possible exception of poriferans and cnidarians .
recent evidence indicates that tcap and the teneurins may have been introduced into the metazoa via horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes into a basal protistan .
thus , the origin of the tcaps likely predated that of the crf family .
in the mammalian brain , tcap - 1 is transcribed independently from teneurin - 1 .
moreover , tcap - 1 acts on neurons by a crf - receptor independent signal transduction pathway to regulate cellular cytoskeletal function to stimulate cell activity .
administration of synthetic tcap - 1 to rodents inhibits a number of crf - and stress - associated behaviors via a hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis - independent mechanism .
stress hpa axis glucocorticoids dystroglycan erk1 / 2 cytoskeleton peptide evolution introduction corticotropin - releasing factor ( crf ) is part of an evolutionary conserved peptide family integral to the regulation of stress - associated behavior and physiology in metazoans .
the long period of time during which crf - like peptides have persisted suggests that the crf response has been evolutionarily advantageous .
early - evolving gene systems integral to the survival of an organism are evolutionarily selected for , and because of this , may give rise to additional paralogous lineages via gene , genomic , and chromosomal duplication events .
in addition , such early evolving systems will likely become associated with newer evolving molecular and physiological systems .
thus , because of the evolutionary age of the crf system , it is likely that it is modulated , in turn , by even earlier evolving systems .
one such candidate for an early evolving crf - modulatory system may be represented by tcap - 1 , a member of the teneurin c - terminal - associated peptides family .
highly conserved in all metazoans , tcap - 1 is active in the regulation of metabolism , stress , and reproduction and significantly inhibits a number of crf - induced stress responses .
although tcap was originally identified in a rainbow trout cdna library screen for potential crf homologs and share a number of structural similarities with the crf family of peptides , they have less than 20 % sequence similarity to the crf family ( qian et al. , 2004 ; lovejoy et al. , 2006 ) .
in situ experiments in sprague - dawley rats show that tcap is highly expressed in all hippocampal subregions , central amygdala ( cea ) , basolateral amygdala ( bla ) , and various hypothalamic nuclei regions that are known to express crf receptors ( wang et al. , 2005 ) .
the tcap - 1 peptide also blocks both crf - induced stress behaviors and c - fos activation within brain areas known to modulate behavioral responses to stress in wistar rats ( tan et al. , 2009 ) .
recent studies show that tcap exerts its neuromodulatory role on crf elements independent of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis , harboring the idea that several accessory pathways may have evolved alongside the hpa axis - mediated signaling pathway .
crf evolution and physiology in vertebrates ( mammalia , amphibia , actinoptergyii , and chondrichthyes ) , the crf family consists of four paralogous peptides that are the result of two rounds of genome duplications in early evolution and has been previously described in detail ( lovejoy and balment , 1999 ; lovejoy and jahan , 2006 ) ( figure 1 ) .
orthologs of crf in invertebrates occur as the diuretic hormones in arthropods , and diuretic hormone - like peptide in tunicates .
these findings indicate that only a single crf peptide was present in the genome of an ancestral protochordate .
the first of the genome duplications led to the formation of two crf - related peptides .
after subsequent selection , both lineages were retained but modified during the accrual of mutations leading to a modified amino acid sequence .
one peptide shares sequence similarities to both crf and urotensin - 1 ( urocortin in mammals ; vaughan et al. , 1995 ; donaldson et al. , 1996 ) , whereas the second peptide possesses both urocortin 2 and 3 characteristics ( lovejoy and jahan , 2006 ) .
the second genome duplication led to the formation of the four peptides that are found in extant vertebrates ( lewis et al. , 2001 ; reyes et al. , 2001 ) .
however , the presence of crf orthologs in arthropods indicates that the earliest crf - like peptides existed before the bifurcation of deuterostome and protostome animals ( lovejoy and balment , 1999 ; lovejoy and jahan , 2006 ) .
research in the last few decades has provided a basis for understanding the regulation of stress and metabolism by crf .
currently , it is understood that in vertebrates , crf activates the stress response through the hpa axis .
it is also through this pathway that crf is regulated by modulatory components of the central nervous system .
figure 1 comparison of the crf peptides family in chordates by genome duplication .
two rounds of genome duplications early in chordate ancestry gave rise to the four paralogous crf related peptides .
abbreviations : dh , diuretic hormone ; dh / crf , diuretic hormone / corticotrophin releasing factor like peptide ; crf , corticotrophin releasing factor ; ucn , urocortin ; ucn2 , urocortin 2 ; ucn3 urocortin 3 ; gd , genome duplication event .
the ancient evolution of crf and crf - like peptides indicates that there is functional necessity of the actions of crf on regulatory mechanisms in physiology .
in many species , humans included , crf induces behaviors and physiological adaptations that endeavor to cope with environmental stressors .
stressors that are associated with new environments , for example , generally bring about behaviors of increased arousal and decreased food intake .
changes in behaviors and physiology that are induced by crf are mediated by interactions of crf / ucn with both the crf1 and crf2 receptors .
urocortin - 2 and - 3 mediate their functions through a separate crf2 receptor ( hauger et al. , 2006 ) .
in numerous vertebrates including osteichthyes , amphibia , reptilia , avia , and mammalia species , exposure to stress leads to activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical ( hpa ) axis ( barsyte et al. , 1999 ; lovejoy and balment , 1999 ; lovejoy and jahan , 2006 ; denver , 2009 ; lovejoy , 2009 ) .
the hpa axis is a neuroendocrine feedback system that is activated when afferents from the sensory system and brainstem signal to the paraventricular nucleus ( pvn ) to secrete crf and arginine vasopressin ( avp ) hormones into the hypophyseal portal system ( tsigos and chrousos , 2002 ; ulrich - lai and herman , 2009 ) .
upon reaching the anterior pituitary , crf stimulates the corticotropes to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone ( acth ) into the systemic circulation ( tsigos and chrousos , 2002 ; denver , 2009 ) .
this hormone in turn acts on the inner adrenal cortex to synthesize and release glucocorticoids , such as cortisol ( denver , 2009 ; ulrich - lai and herman , 2009 ) .
circulating glucocorticoids induce a multitude of different responses which all act to promote energy mobilization ; these include gluconeogenesis in the liver , liberation of amino acids , inhibition of glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue , increased lipolysis and suppression of immune and reproductive functions ( ulrich - lai and herman , 2009 ) .
regulation of the system occurs through negative feedback of glucocorticoids at the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary , inhibiting the release of crf and acth respectively ; in addition , the action of glucocorticoids on neuronal inputs to the pvn restricts activation of the hpa axis ( tsigos and chrousos , 2002 ; denver , 2009 ) .
however , the hpa system , as it is understood in vertebrates , does not appear to be present in non - vertebrates ( lovejoy , 2009 ) .
thus , given the evolutionary age of crf - like peptides , it has become well ensconced in numerous physiological processes predating the hpa axis .
however , crf itself has a number of non - hpa associated functions including feeding , diuresis , metamorphosis , locomotion , and vocalization ( lovejoy and balment , 1999 ) .
these regulatory actions may have evolved to accompany stress regulation .
given the widespread actions of the crf family of peptides , evolutionarily older physiological systems may be working alongside the crf lineage or interacting with elements of the crf lineage in a neuromodulatory manner in complex organisms .
teneurin and the teneurin c - terminal associated peptides ( tcap ) the teneurins are a family of four type - ii transmembrane proteins that are critical for morphogenesis and pattern formation in metazoans ( wang et al. , 2005 ; lovejoy et al. , 2006 , 2009 ; tucker et al. , 2007 ; young and leamey , 2009 ) .
originally discovered in drosophila , teneurins were later discovered in vertebrates to have four paralogs ( teneurin - 1 to - 4 ) ( kenzelmann et al. , 2007 ) .
vertebrate teneurins are predominately expressed in the nervous system and have been implicated in neural development and maintenance ( lovejoy et al. , 2006 ; kenzelmann et al. , 2007 ) .
they are typically about 2800 amino acids long with a structure that is highly conserved ( tucker et al. , 2007 ) .
at the end of the c - terminus of teneurin - 1 to - 4 is a cleavable bioactive peptide termed the teneurin c - terminal - associated peptide ( tcap ) - 1 to - 4 .
recent studies , however , indicate that tcap - 1 is independently transcribed from teneurin - 1 , thus providing evidence for the independence of tcaps from teneurins ( chand et al. , 2012a ) .
initial attempts to identify paralogous genes to the crf family led to the discovery of this tcap family ( qian et al. , 2004 ) .
it was first discovered in a screening of the hypothalamic cdna library of rainbow trout using a hamster urocortin probe ( barsyte et al. , 1999 ; qian et al. , 2004 ) .
sequence analyses revealed a putative peptide sequence on the 3 ' region of teneurin - 3 in trout and this peptide sequence was termed tcap - 3 , by virtue of its association with teneurin - 3 ( qian et al. , 2004 ) .
further analyses led to the discovery of the 3 other tcap peptides on teneurins - 1 , - 2 , and - 4 ( wang et al. , 2005 ) .
the tcap family is ubiquitously expressed among all metazoan species ( lovejoy et al. , 2006 ; tucker et al. , 2012 ) .
the four vertebrate tcap paralogs show about 80 % identity with each other amongst metazoan species ( lovejoy et al. , 2006 , 2009 ) .
this high level of conservation indicates that this family of peptides evolved before the protostome - deuterostome divergence and that its role implicates a functional necessity for organisms .
the teneurin - tcap system likely evolved by horizontal gene transfer from a prokaryote gene to a choanoflagellate ( zhang et al. , 2012 ) , where subsequently this gene integrated within the choanoflagellate genome and was passed into subsequent metazoan speciation ( tucker et al. , 2012 ; chand et al. , 2013 ; tucker , 2013 ) .
moreover , there is 13 - 30 % similarity with various peptides and the crf family of peptides ( wang et al. , 2005 ; lovejoy et al. , 2006 ) ( figure 2 ) .
this level of sequence similarity , along with the peptide and mrna size suggests that there may be a common origin in evolutionary history with the crf peptides , although the evolutionary relationship between the lineages is not understood ( chand et al. , 2013 ; de lannoy and lovejoy , in press ) .
figure 2 comparison of the primary structure between the tcap and crf families of peptides .
amino acid identity among crf paralogs are shown as dark gray , and continued among tcap peptides where they match .
conservative homologous substitutions are shown in light gray .
note that the identity among tcap peptides is much greater than that of crf peptides .
the tcap family of peptides all have characteristics of a cleavable bioactive peptide ; a cleavage motif on the n - terminus and an amidation motif on the c - terminus .
the tcap - 1 , - 2 , and - 4 peptides are 41 - amino residues in length and tcap - 3 is 40 amino residues in length ( lovejoy et al. , 2006 ). of the four , mouse tcap - 1 is the only peptide in the family confirmed to be expressed as a separate transcript from the teneurin gene in adults , although this may be the case for mouse tcap - 3 as well .
thus , in our model of tcap release , we assume that tcap - 2 and - 4 are released by ectodomain cleavage , whereas tcaps - 1 and - 3 may be released by ectodomain cleavage and by independent transcription , translation , and subsequent release via cytosolic processes .
studies in zebrafish , chick , and rodents indicate that although expressed throughout the brain , tcap - 1 is particularly concentrated in the limbic regions including the hippocampus , hypothalamus , and amygdala ( wang et al. , 2005 ; tan et al. , 2009 , 2011 ) .
it is in the rat hippocampus and amygdala that tcap - 1 has been shown to exert its neuromodulatory effects on behavior and stress .
neuromodulation of crf - induced behavior by tcap - 1 gene expression studies on mouse brain revealed that tcap - 1 ( as part of the teneurin - 1 gene ) was expressed mainly in the limbic system , hypothalamus and cerebellum ( wang et al. , 2005 ) , suggesting these areas as focal points of tcap - 1 action .
however , like other neuromodulatory peptide systems , behavioral studies in rodents indicate that tcap - 1 has differential effects on anxiety depending upon the test , the treatment regimen , and perhaps even the baseline anxiety level of rats ( rotzinger et al. , 2010 ) .
acute administration of synthetic tcap - 1 into the bla significantly increases the acoustic startle response in low - anxiety rats and decreases the response in high - anxiety rats ( wang et al. , 2005 ) .
repeated administration of tcap - 1 at picomole concentrations into the lateral ventricles decreased acoustic startle in all rats .
a 50 % decrease in the acoustic startle response was apparent 15 days after the last tcap - 1 treatment ( wang et al. , 2005 ) .
moreover , using the same regimen , tcap - 1 treatment completely ablated the crf - induced increase in the acoustic startle response ( tan et al. , 2008 ) .
in contrast , the same pre - treatment potentiated the effects of a crf icv challenge in the elevated plus maze and open field tests , where , upon crf challenge , rats showed decreased open arm entries in the elevated plus maze , and decreased locomotion , as well as time , entries and distance traveled in the center zone of the open field ( tan et al. , 2008 ) .
however , iv injections of tcap - 1 resulted in differential behaviors in response to an iv or icv crf challenge ( al chawaf et al. , 2007b ) .
overall , rats treated with repeated iv doses of tcap - 1 , followed by an acute icv crf challenge were less anxious than rats given an injection of crf via the iv route ( al chawaf et al. , 2007b ) .
again , these behavioral effects only occurred upon co - administration with crf ; tcap alone had little effect on behavior , further indicating that this peptide plays a neuromodulatory role .
this stress - mediated action of tcap - 1 is further reflected by studies using a cocaine reinstatement model ( kupferschmidt et al. , 2010 ) .
using the number of active lever responses as tests for reinstatement of cocaine seeking , prior tcap - 1 treatment in rodents resulted in fewer lever responses after a crf injection .
however , tcap - 1 pre - treatment did not modulate reinstatement by footshock stress , or cocaine - induced reinstatement .
the difference in effects of tcap - 1 on iv - vs. icv - injected crf in rats also suggests that tcap - 1 may be involved in the feedback of glucocorticoids to the brain .
a previous study in mice ( martins et al. , 1996 ) found that icv - administered crf induces its effects by targeting sites in the cns as well as peripheral sites along the hpa axis .
however , iv - administered crf does not cross the blood - brain barrier and thus will only activate the hpa axis at the level of the pituitary and adrenal gland ( martins et al. , 1996 ) .
thus , the difference in tcap - 1 effects on icv - and iv - administered crf may be due to a modulatory effect of the glucocorticoid receptors or signaling in limbic regions by tcap - 1 .
in particular , tcap - 1 may be acting on the hippocampus and amygdala to change the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid feedback on the pvn crf secretion .
further studies indicated the action of tcap - 1 occurs at a pre - transcription and cellular activation level .
tcap - 1 attenuates expression of crf - induced c - fos in the amygdala ( tan et al. , 2009 ) .
rats pre - treated with tcap - 1 showed lower c - fos immunoreactivity in the amygdala , medial prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and the dorsal raphe nucleus upon icv crf injections .
activation of crf promotes c - fos synthesis and expression through a pka / camp / camkii pathway that leads to creb phosphorylation .
phosphorylated creb then regulates c - fos gene transcription by binding to response elements cre and ap - 1 ( kovacs , 1998 ) .
similarly to crf , tcap - 1 leads to camp accumulation in vitro ( wang et al. , 2005 ) .
studies on gn11 mouse immortalized cell lines show that tcap - 1 has a biphasic effect on camp such that low concentrations of tcap - 1 increased camp , and high concentrations decreased camp levels ( wang et al. , 2005 ) .
moreover , a crf1 receptor antagonist addition failed to block the tcap - 1 - induced increase in camp suggesting the presence of independent signaling pathways .
administration of tcap alone had a minor effect on c - fos activation in vivo in rats .
however , tcap administration after concomitant crf administration produced significant behavioral changes ( tan et al. , 2009 ) .
this strongly suggests that tcap plays a neuromodulatory role on elements of crf signaling systems .
evidence shows that glucocorticoids inhibit ap - 1 and cre responses ( kovacs , 1998 ) .
thus , tcap could regulate elements of crf signaling through modulation of cre and ap - 1 activity .
in addition , tcap could inhibit crf - induced c - fos through inhibition of crf expression itself , as the promoter of the crf gene contains a cre ( hauger et al. , 2006 ) .
using luciferase reporter assays , we found that tcap administration decreases ap - 1 reporter activity in an immortalized n3 hypothalamic cell line ( nock et al. , unpublished observations ) .
thus , tcap 's ability to attenuate crf induced c - fos activation in vivo may be , in part , through interactions with the ap - 1 response element .
however , ap - 1 is regulated by numerous elements , and tcap - 1 may regulate ap - 1 activity by a crf - independent mechanism .
in vitro , tcap - 1 administration did not alter crf - induced camp increases in the hypothalamic cell line gn11 ( wang et al. , 2005 ) , nor crf - induced cre activation in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with crf1 and crf2 receptors .
in vitro , tcap - 1 does not modulate cellular distribution or total protein of crf1 , or the gc receptors gr and mr in mouse embryonic hippocampal e14 cells .
administration of tcap - 1 also did not modulate the phosphorylation of a crf1 downstream transcription factor creb .
repeated daily tcap - 1 administration in mice did not affect basal non - stressed hpa activity based on serum cortisol and acth levels. from these studies , it is apparent that under basal non - stressed conditions , tcap - 1 does not interact directly with hpa regulatory pathways involving crf or gc receptors ( de almeida et al. , unpublished studies ) .
the lack of direct interaction of tcap - 1 on crf signal transduction systems led us to investigate alternative explanations for its mechanism .
the similarity of the tcap - 1 primary structure to crf and related peptides had led us to postulate that the peptide activated a g - protein coupled receptor ( gpcr ) similar to the family of gpcrs related to the crf receptors .
however,in vitro screening of most of the receptors in this family did not show any significant binding or activation ( lovejoy , unpublished studies ) .
however , gene microarray profiling indicated a similarity to neurotrophic factor activation and a relationship with the dystroglycan complex ( chand et al. , 2012b ) .
subsequent studies confirmed this relationship , thus tcap - 1 may be the first identified soluble ligand for the dystroglycan complex .
the dystroglycan complex is hypothesized to be integral to the intracellular signaling of extracellular tcap - 1 due to a strong co - localization of tcap - 1 with beta - dystroglycan , the plasma membrane bound subunit of the dystroglycan complex ( chand et al. , 2012b ) .
in essence , tcap - 1 mediates cytoskeletal re - organization in e14 cells by binding to the dystroglycan complex which then signals through a mek - erk1 / 2 - dependent phosphorylation of stathmin and filamin a. this leads to f - actin polymerization , increased tubulin immunoreactivity , and increased filopodia development ( chand et al. , 2012b ) .
the erk1 / 2 pathway is the proposed mechanism through which tcap - 1 modulates neurite and dendrite morphology in immortalized mouse hypothalamic cell lines , primary hippocampal cultures ( al chawaf et al. , 2007a ) , and golgi - stained rat brains ( tan et al. , 2011 ) .
within multiple areas of the mouse brain , crf induces stress - related cytoskeletal changes .
crf1 activation in the ca3 mediates dendritic retraction by inducing destabilization of f - actin and the cell adhesion molecule nectin - 3 ( chen et al. , 2008 ; wang et al. , 2011 ) .
activation of crf1 in the locus coeruleus ( lc ) also mediates outgrowth of neuronal processes through the rho gtpase rac1 ( swinny and valentino , 2006 ) .
in the hippocampus , this rac1 - dependent outgrowth of neuronal processes is counteracted by rhoa inhibition on dendritic spine formation and branching .
thus , tcap - 1 may exert its crf modulating effects through countering crf1 mediated changes in cytoskeletal re - organization - like synaptic plasticity within stress modulating brain areas that express both crf1 and tcap - 1 .
conclusion current data suggests that tcap - 1 acts as a separate and distinct peptide modulating system , which is involved in cytoskeletal - associated synaptic plasticity. from an evolutionary perspective , it is perhaps not surprising that tcap - 1 acts independently of crf signaling .
the teneurins and tcap evolved early in metazoan history , whereas the crf family of peptides and their role in integrating energy metabolism and the perception of stressors evolved later after evolution of vertebrates ( lovejoy and jahan , 2006 ; lovejoy , 2009 ) .
moreover , the later evolution of the hpa axis in stress signaling and the independence of tcap - 1 neurmodulatory actions from the hpa axis further support a possible parallel evolution .
the tcap - 1 peptide acts on the dystroglycan complex in order to signal intracellularly .
this signaling may be downstream of other effectors from the crf signaling pathway downstream of the crf1 receptor .
the observed tcap - 1 modulatory effects on crf behaviors may then be mediated through tcap - 1 specific signaling that oppose crf mediated effects on cellular cytoskeletal organization within brain areas that co - express tcap - 1 and crf .
this in turn manifests into modulation of crf - mediated stress behaviors in brain regions that co - express crf and tcap - 1 .

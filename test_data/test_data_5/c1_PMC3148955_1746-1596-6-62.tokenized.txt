background primary tumours of the middle ear are much less commonly encountered in clinical practice than non neoplastic lesions .
middle ear adenocarcinoma is a very rare , locally invasive neoplasm assumed to arise from the middle ear mucosa .
because the natural course and clinical behavior of this neoplasm are far from established , the sporadic reports of such cases continue to provide basis for better understanding .
case description a case of low grade adenocarcinoma of the middle ear is described in details with regard to its clinical presentation , radiological findings , histopathological , immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings .
the tumour recurred four times .
adenocarcinoma aggressive middle ear introduction as a consequence of their rarity , middle ear neoplasms may be difficult to classify , for both clinicians and pathologists ( devaney etal.2003 ) [ 1 ] .
middle ear adenocarcinoma is a very rare , locally invasive neoplasm assumed to arise from the middle ear mucosa .
although endolymphatic sac tumor ( aggressive papillary middle ear tumor ) and jugulotympanic paraganglioma may show brain invasion , intracranial extension of histologically confirmed middle ear adenocarcinoma has not been previously reported ( paulus etal 199 ) [ 2 ] .
case report a male patient presented at age 24 with a mass in the right middle ear extending to the external auditory meatus .
he underwent surgery and the mass was diagnosed as a simple polyp .
one year later he presented with a recurrent bleeding mass .
the mass was re - excised and the surgeon informed him that it was adherent to the facial nerve and the patient ended up with a facial paralysis .
the mass was diagnosed as a middle ear adenoma .
the patient was free of symptoms for 5 years when he presented with a recurrent reddish mass in the previous mastoid cavity filling it completely and peeping through the eustachian tube .
the mass was completely excised in september 2000 and the biopsy revealed a middle ear adenoma .
the patient was followed up and was free until 2003 when routine mri showed a huge mass extending behind the mastoid cavity into the posterior cranial fossa .
the previous mastoid cavity was free of recurrence .
a posterior fossa craniotomy was performed and the mass partially excised as it was extremely bloody and adherent to the cerebellum and brainstem .
the biopsy revealed it to be a middle ear adenocarcinoma .
the patient received post - operative radiotherapy on the remnant and repeat follow - up mri revealed it to be stable .
in 2005 a follow - up mri was ordered for recurrent headaches and revealed a large mass in the middle cranial fossa above the tegmen .
the previous middle ear and mastoid cavities were still free of recurrence .
the mass was excised by a middle fossa craniotomy and the last biopsy revealed an adenocarcinoma as well .
the patient has no family history of similar condition histologically the tumour cells are arranged in islands , cords or form glandular spaces .
the latter contain brightly eosinophilic secretory material .
tumour cells are cuboidal or oval with finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally placed cytologically bland nuclei .
( figure 1 ) figure 1 a photomicrograph of the tumor .
it is made up of epithelial cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm , arranged in trabeculae and glandular spaces containing eosinphilic material .
( h & e stain ) immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumour cells are positive for keratin ( figure 2 ) , vimentin ( figure 3 ) , and s100 protein but negative for chromogranin .
electron microscopy revealed evidence of exocrine differentiation in the form of apical membrane bound vesicles and electron dense granules .
surface microvilli have also been found ( figure 4 ) .
the proliferation index was assessed by ki 67 immunostaining and it was about 1 % .

discussion as epithelial tumors as a group are rarities in the middle ear , epithelial tumours of the middle ear of variable degrees of aggressiveness have been considered together in several reports [ 3 - 5 ] .
moreover an entity designated aggressive papillary middle ear tumour has been recognized ; this term describes a middle ear tumour which may , in contrast to middle ear adenoma , act in a particularly aggressive fashion with intracranial extension [ 6,7 ] .
clearly , for the term middle ear adenoma to have any meaning in isolation , it must refer to a tumor which does not exhibit either light microscopic or clinical / radiologic evidence of aggressive or malignant behavior [ 1 ] .
in this case report the light microscopic , immunohistochemical and electron microscopic findings were similar to those of middle ear adenoma .
this tumor is considered to be low grade based on histology and low proliferation index but malignant based on aggressively invasive behavior , as it recurred four times and it was invasive to the petrous bone , posterior cranial fossa and middle cranial fossa .
the differential diagnosis of this tumour include papillary adenocarcinoma ( aggressive papillary tumor ) of the middle ear which has a papillary - to - glandular appearance and may produce a colloid - like substance and resemble papillary carcinomas of the thyroid .
it has been suggested that this may be the same tumor as low grade adenocarcinoma of endolymphatic sac origin , which has locally extended into the middle ear .
these tumors are immunohistochemically positive for cytokeratin , epithelial membrane antigen , and s100 protein .
in the present case the tumour showed no papillae , and it remains to be verified whether similar tumours can originate from the middle ear .
paulus etal .
1999 [ 2 ] described a 53 - year - old man who suffered from otalgia and tinnitus for more than 10 years and from neurological deficits for 1 year due to a large temporal bone tumor that invaded the temporal lobe .
a combined neurosurgical and otolaryngological resection was performed .
pathological analysis revealed a low - grade adenocarcinoma of a mixed epithelial - - neuroendocrine phenotype , which showed a close histological similarity to , and topographical relationship with , middle ear epithelium .
the authors conclude that middle ear adenocarcinoma belongs to the spectrum of extracranial tumors that have possible local extension to the brain .
conclusion every individual case of middle ear adenomatous tumor requires a detailed clinical and radiological workup .
all cases should be managed aggressively with an attempt at tumor removal .
regular follow - up with sequential radiology is essential .
consent written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images .
a copy of written consent is available for review by the editor - in - chief of this journal .

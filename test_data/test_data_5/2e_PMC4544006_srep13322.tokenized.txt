a fantastic and extraordinary phenomenon was observed during the evaporation of a water droplet doped with manganese chloride .
as observed from the evolution of this type of droplet , a thin film was formed on the surface with an exothermic phase transition , resulting in self - suppressed evaporation .
the mncl2 - doped water droplets were maintained in a relative humidity ( rh ) of 50 % at 40 degreesc for more than a week and for longer than two months at a temperature of 25 degreesc .
in contrast , a pure water droplet can only be sustained for a few minutes .
the self - suppressed evaporation of doped water may be due to the special hydration of the accumulated manganese and chloride ions at the surface , decreasing the surface tension .
the evaporation of sessile droplets is important in a large number of areas including heat - transfer applications , printing , washing , coating , and foliar fertilizer delivery .
the transport properties of a liquid , especially the evaporation rate , are of great interest in the assessment of hazards due to volatile chemicals and the release of volatile active species , such as perfumes and flavours , in water and soil conservation .
however , very few studies have been reported on the evaporation of water .
the evaporation rate of a water droplet depends on various factors including the temperature , relative humidity , substrates and additives , such as surfactants and electrolytes12 .
during the past few decades , the study of the structures and behaviours of ions at water surfaces has received considerable interest3456 .
in addition to the previously mentioned practical reasons , the complexity of the structures of water and the many ion hydration types provides its own motivation for researchers .
the distribution of soluble ions at the air / water interface is important for understanding the kinetics and dynamics of the evaporation process and interfacial reactions .
the traditional thermodynamic model suggests that the ions in water should be repelled from the air / water interface .
in contrast , recent molecular dynamics simulations predicted that some simple ions ( e.g. , i - and br - ) might accumulate at the water surface78 .
recently , due to the development of phase - sensitive nonlinear optical techniques , such as second harmonic generation91011 , vibrational sum - frequency generation121314 and photoelectron spectroscopy in liquid jets151617 , researchers have discovered that aqueous surfaces are not as passive as classical theory predicted , which suggested that aqueous surfaces would be essentially ion free and similar to the surface of neat water .
small hard ions , such as alkali metal cations or fluorine ions , are repelled from the surface .
however , other inorganic ions , such as soft anions ( heavier halides ) , hydronium , ammonium and nitrate , exhibit a relative propensity for the surface .
the anionic size , solvent polarizability , and hydrogen bonding pattern may be possible driving forces1318192021 .
however , the driving forces are a controversial issue , and some experimental results have contradicted the predictions from md simulations22 .
surprisingly , two different types of evaporation were observed for aqueous electrolyte droplets , which have not been previously reported .
in room temperature with 50 +/ - 5 % rh , a 20 - mul pure water sessile droplet could only exist for approximately 30 minutes .
however , a droplet of the same size of 0.5 m sodium chloride was maintained for a slightly longer period of time , and the sodium chloride precipitated during the evaporation process .
however , a droplet of the same size of 0.5 m manganese chloride was stable for more than two months , and a thin film was formed on the surface of the droplet , which suppressed the evaporation of the droplet .
these phenomena not only provide remarkable insight into moisturizing and saving water but also have significant potential in studies of the hydration and distribution of ions in water .
results and discussion the evaporation of a droplet is a very complicated process that is affected by various factors , such as the ambient temperature , rh , vapour diffusion , and the contact angle of the sessile droplet .
the additive should be the most important factor .
to avoid interferences from other factors , the conditions in the parallel experiments were the same except this mentioned one .
the cleaned glass slides modified with n - decyltrimethoxysilane via chemical vapour deposition were used as the substrates , and the contact angle of pure water on this substrate was 90 +/ - 3degrees .
the rh was maintained at 50 +/ - 5 % in all of the experiments .
the entire evaporation process was recorded using a homemade horizontal optical system and a commercial ccd .
when the substrate temperature was maintained at 40 degreesc , a 20 - mul droplet dries up in approximately 30 minutes , which is a common phenomenon .
a water droplet with the same volume containing 0.5 m sodium chloride was sustained slightly longer for approximately 40 minutes , which was predicted based on classical raoult 's law reported in 1882 .
surprisingly , the droplet existed for more than one week when it contained 0.5 m manganese chloride .
in addition , the droplet could be maintained for more than two months when stored at room temperature ( 25 degreesc ) .
however , a pure water droplet and a sodium chloride droplet dry up in two hours under the same conditions .
as shown in fig. 1 , the manganese chloride droplet ( 20 mul ) shrank on the substrate in the initial stage , and the shape of the droplet did not change after approximately 30 minutes .
to validate the observed phenomena , thermogravimetric analysis ( tga ) was used to determine the thermal stability and evaporation process of the three types of droplets .
all of the measurements were performed in air to simulate the situations that occur in the natural environment. with the temperature maintained at 40 degreesc , the proportion of retained weight was recorded as a function of increasing time .
as shown in fig. 2a , the droplet of pure water volatilized in approximately 30 minutes , and for the volatilization of the droplet with 0.5 m sodium chloride , only sodium chloride remained after approximately 40 minutes .
however , the droplet containing 0.5 m manganese chloride continuously shrank in the beginning but did not exhibit obvious changes after approximately 38 minutes , and approximately 22 % of its weight remained , which is much greater than the weight of the manganese chloride contained in the droplets .
these results indicated that a significant volume of water was still present .
scanning differential calorimetry was also performed to study the evaporation process .
the inset in fig. 2a shows the change in the temperature as the time increased for the evaporation process of the manganese chloride droplet .
two exothermic peaks were observed at 18 minutes and 38 minutes , which are most likely due to exothermic phase transitions .
this phenomenon was not observed during the evaporation process of the other two types of droplets .
there are an obvious turning points on the tga curve of the manganese chloride droplets at 38 minutes when the phase transition finished .
we found that the phase transition time decreases as the temperature increases ( fig. 2b ) .
although the droplet are finally dried up , there are still an obvious turning points on the tga curves when temperature was maintain at 50 degreesc and 60 degreesc .
while the phase transition time is a little longer when the concentration of the manganese chloride raised , which could be due to the hydration of ions and their redistribution at the surface .
inspired by the study of newton 's ring and interference fringes formed with curved thin sheets2324 , a creative homemade light apparatus was designed to monitor the surface evolution of the droplet with manganese chloride .
as shown in fig. 3a , a 20 - mul droplet was dropped onto a modified glass slide mounted on a heating system with the temperature was maintained at 40 degreesc .
a 633 nm laser beam with a diameter of approximately 1 mm vertically penetrated through the centre of the droplet and then was reflected on a vertical screen with a reflector .
the patterns of the laser on the screen were recorded by a commercial ccd ( fig. 3a ) .
after several minutes of evaporation , some interesting patterns began to appear , as shown in fig. 3b .
the interference patterns were easily identified at approximately 15 minutes .
the irregular patterns evolved as the evaporation progressed , which may be due to some small thin film fragments being formed and fluctuating on the surface of the droplet .
after approximately 20 minutes , the film fragments joined together , and the distance of the interference fringes began to decrease .
therefore , the thickness of the film continued to increase .
the interference fringes became obscure and finally disappeared after approximately 35 minutes , which indicated that the thickness was too large to produce interference or there was no clean - cut difference between the film and the bulk of the droplet .
a simple simulation was performed with comsol multiphysics to confirm the diffraction phenomena due to the curved thin film .
the model , which was based on the wave optics module , was scaled down by 50 times compared to the actual situation due to computational complexity .
the film thickness was 1 mum , and its index of refraction was 1.4 .
in addition , the diffraction patterns are shown in fig. 4. afm was also used to confirm the formation of the thin film on the droplet , as shown in fig. 5. the droplet was pre - heated at 40 degreesc for approximately 35 minutes .
then , the afm probe was pierced 2 mum into the droplet from the top and then slowly drawn out .
the relationship between the drawing force and the vertical displacement was recorded .
based on the results for the pure water droplet , the force became more negative in the initial stage due to the adhesion force between the water and the tip , and then , the force suddenly returned to zero , which indicates that the water was detached from the tip surface .
in contrast , there were two sudden changes observed in the plot for the manganese chloride droplet .
the first change corresponded to the liquid beneath the film detaching from the tip , and the second one corresponded to the film detaching from the tips .
therefore , based on these results , the film thickness is approximately 1 mum , which is approximately equal to the width between the two steps .
the electrolyte typically precipitates at the bottom of the solution during evaporation , which is the same as that observed for the aqueous solution of sodium chloride .
therefore , the film that formed on the surface of the droplet in the evaporation process of the manganese chloride droplet and the self - suppressed evaporation are interesting phenomena .
a modified setup was developed to monitor the variation in the surface tension as the time increased .
a standard platinum plate was mounted on a highly sensitive balance system and immersed in a beaker with approximately 20 ml of a solution .
the force was recorded and converted to surface tension with software by considering the geometrical dimensions of the platinum plate .
the details of the surface tension are shown in fig. 6 the surface tension of water was 71.6 mn / m and exhibited no obvious change with time .
the surface tension of the sodium chloride aqueous solution increased during the initial 20 minutes and then remained stable .
the increase in the surface tension of sodium chloride aqueous solution compared to that of pure water is consistent with previous studies25 .
surprisingly , the surface tension of the manganese chloride solution is much smaller than the surface tension of water and exhibited a continuous decrease for approximately three hours prior to becoming stable .
these phenomena may be due to the formation of a thin film on the surface of the manganese chloride solution .
the manganese chloride tended to accumulate on the surface due to its ability to decrease the surface tension .
the sodium chloride increased the surface tension , which resulted in its depletion from the surface and precipitation in the bottom of the droplet .
the manganese chloride exhibits a stronger interaction with water molecules .
therefore , the aggregated manganese chloride formed a film with water to self - suppress the evaporation of the droplet .
the film was metastable and exhibited no crystal structure because no x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) peaks were observed in the xrd experiment ( panalytical x'pert pro ) .
there was a large variation in the time required for the stabilization of the surface tension .
for example , the surface tension of the sodium chloride aqueous solution stabilized in approximately 20 minutes , and the manganese chloride aqueous solution required approximately three hours .
this result inspired a direct approach for determining the reorientation time of the water molecules , which typically requires complicated technology262728 .
to determine the influence of ions on the hydration water , especially the hydrogen bond , far infrared spectra were adapted to investigate the binding .
because the molar absorptivity of water is too high to examine the solutions by common transmission spectroscopy , the application of an attenuated total reflection ( atr ) unit was employed for the experiments .
atr affects the peak of the absorption spectra due to anomalous dispersion , resulting in decreased wavenumbers in the atr spectrum compared to the absorption spectrum2930 .
as shown in fig. 7 , the hydrogen bond stretching ( 181 cm - 1 ) shifted by approximately 2 cm - 1 and 27 cm - 1 when sodium chloride and manganese chloride were added , respectively .
the hydrogen bonds in the aqueous sodium chloride droplets are slightly stronger than those in pure water .
due to the more robust interaction between the water molecules in the sodium chloride droplets , the sodium chloride droplets were maintained for a slightly longer period of time than the pure water droplets .
manganese chloride caused a larger increase in the hydrogen bonds than sodium chloride , which indicates that the water molecules are held more strongly in the solution .
in the evaporation process of the droplets with manganese chloride , the accumulating ions at the surface coordinate with water molecules , which interrupts the hydrogen bonds between the non - coordinated water31 .
thus , the energy releases as shown in the inset of fig. 2a , resulting in a decrease in the surface tension .
manganese bromide exhibited phenomena similar to those of manganese chloride due to the presence of the same cations , and the br - anions were even more prone to accumulating at the surface of the water than the cl - anions2532 .
methods the rh was controlled by the central air conditioning with an ultrasonic humidifier ( air - o - swiss aos 7135 ) and recorded by a hygrometer ( oregon scientific , thg 312 ) in all of the experiments .
the tga was performed using a tga q5000 with an airflow rate of 25.0 ml / min .
the evolutions of the surface tensions of the three types of liquids were recorded by a highly sensitive microelectromechanical balance system ( kuess k100sf ) .
the relationship between the force and the vertical displacement that is shown in fig. 5 was acquired using afm .
an afm ( mfp - 3d ) with probes ( hq : csc38 / al bs ) with a spring constant ( k ) of 0.3 nm - 1 and a tip radius of 8 nm was used under ambient conditions .
the xrd patterns were recorded on a pw1830 ( philips , cukalpha radiation lambda = 1.541874 a ) .
the far ft - ir spectra were recorded on a bruker vertex 70 spectrometer with a pike gladi atr unit equipped with a diamond at 45degrees as the internal reflecting element .
the entire system was sealed and purged with nitrogen for 12 hours to prevent interference from the water molecules in the air .

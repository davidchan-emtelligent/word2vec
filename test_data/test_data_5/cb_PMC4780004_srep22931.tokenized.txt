we included 2119 ethnic bai , 2202 ethnic yi and 2183 ethnic han adults aged 50 years or older in the study .
ocular dimensions including axial length ( al ) , anterior chamber depth ( acd ) , vitreous chamber depth ( vcd ) and lens thickness ( lt ) were measured using a - scan ultrasonography .
bai chinese had longer als ( p < 0.001 ) , deeper acds ( p < 0.001 ) but shallower vcds ( p < 0.001 ) compared with the other two ethnic groups .
there were no ethnic variations in lts .
diabetes was associated with shallower acds and this association was stronger in bai chinese compared with yi or han chinese ( p for interaction = 0.02 ) .
thicker lenses were associated with younger age ( p = 0.04 ) , male gender ( p < 0.001 ) , smoking history ( p = 0.01 ) , alcohol intake ( p = 0.03 ) , the presence of cataract ( p < 0.001 ) , and the presence of diabetes ( p < 0.001 ) .
there were significant differences in ocular dimensions among different ethnic groups with small differences in genetics but large variations in cultures and lifestyles .
numerous studies have tried to elucidate the etiologies of age - related eye disorders including refractive errors , age - related macular degeneration , age - related cataract and glaucoma , which are the major causes of visual impairment and blindness in older people1 .
potential ethnic variations in the risk of these age - related eye disorders have been reported .
for example , myopia seems to be more prevalent in east asians including chinese , japanese or koreans23 .
the prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma is higher in africans while the prevalence of primary angle closure glaucoma is higher in asians compared with europeans4 .
anatomically , these age - related eye disorders have been linked with ocular dimensions such as axial length ( al ) 5 .
therefore , an in - depth knowledge of the potential ethic variations in ocular dimensions provides further insights into the etiologies of these eye disorders .
up till now , population - based studies have reported a wide range of normative data on ocular dimensions among various ethnic groups in different areas of the world67891011 .
however , inter - study comparisons of these estimates are difficult considering the methodological disparities among different studies including sampling strategies , age ranges of the study subjects , and measurements of ocular dimensions .
the singapore epidemiology of eye diseases ( seed ) study provided initial evidence on a possible ethnic difference in the ocular dimensions measured by iol master among the three major ethnic groups including chinese , malays and indians in this city state by collecting data using the same study protocols12 .
it is interesting to understand whether ethnic differences exist in multiethnic population with relatively smaller variations in genetics .
in addition , iol master does not provide important ocular dimension data of lens thickness ( lt ) or vitreous chamber depth ( vcd ) and whether there are ethnic differences in these ocular dimensions remains unclear .
china is the world 's most populous country with a multiethnic population including han ethnicity and another 55 ethnic minorities .
han ethnicity is the major ethnic group which accounts for about 90 % of the entire national population .
the yi and bai ethnicities are the major ethnic minorities in china .
these ethnic groups have different cultures , languages and lifestyles , yet relatively similar genetic ancestry13 .
in this study , we describe the ethnic variations in the distributions and determinants of ocular dimensions measured by an echoscan among the three ethnic groups ( bai , yi and han ethnicities ) in rural china .
methods study cohort the yunnan minority eye studies ( ymes ) are population - based studies conducted among different ethnic groups including the han ethnicity ( the major ethnic group ) and other ethnic minorities in southwestern china using the same study protocols for data collection .
the ymes were conducted from 2011 to 2014 .
in a previous report , we have described the detailed methodology of ymes and some major findings in a single ethnic group , that is , the bai ethnicity14151617 .
now , we have finished the data collection for the other two ethnic groups : yi and han ethnicities , which allowed for multiethnic comparisons .
briefly , random cluster sampling strategies were adopted to select ethnic bai , yi and han adults aged 50 years or older living in a rural community .
these three ethnic groups resided in separate towns within a rural community in yunnan province .
information regarding ethnicity was collected from the study participants' identity cards .
different ethnic groups were not living in the same villages and there were few inter - marriages among different ethnic groups .
each village in the study site with a population of approximately 1000 was considered as a cluster during the sampling procedure .
villages with a population of less than 750 were combined and those of more than 1500 were divided and regrouped .
subsequently , 10 % of the total clusters were randomly selected using a computer - assisted program .
in the end of the study , 2133 ( 77.8 %) ethnic bai , 2208 ( 82.0 %) ethnic yi and 2205 ( 80.5 %) ethnic han adults participated in this study , respectively .
there were no age or gender differences between study participants and non - participants among all ethnic groups ( all p > 0.05 ) .
the same research team collected data from all three ethnic groups using the same equipment .
all studies were approved by the kunming medical university institutional review board and the conduct of the studies adhered to the declaration of helsinki .
the study methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines .
informed consent was obtained from all study participants .
clinical examinations ocular dimensions including al , anterior chamber depth ( acd ) , vcd and lt were measured using an echoscan ( us - 800 ; nidek co. , ltd , tokyo , japan ) and the mean of the 5 readings was used for data analysis .
non - cycloplegic autorefraction was performed using an autorefractor ( rm - 8000 ; topcon corp. , tokyo , japan ) and refraction was subjectively refined until the best visual acuity was obtained .
information regarding participants' educational level , socioeconomic status , lifestyle - related factors ( e.g. , smoking , alcohol intake ) , disease history , and medication intake was collected using a detailed questionnaire by a trained research assistant .
height was measured in centimeters using a wall - mounted measuring tape after removing shoes while weight was measured in kilograms after taking off heavy clothing .
systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate for all participants were recorded using a standardized mercuric - column sphygmomanometer , and one of four cuff sizes ( pediatric , regular adult , large , or thigh ) was selected based on the circumference of the participant 's arm .
hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmhg , diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmhg , or a physician diagnosis .
diabetes mellitus was defined as non - fasting glucose levels higher than 200 mg / dl ( 11.1 mmol / l ) or previous physician diagnosis of diabetes or use of anti - diabetic medications based on the american diabetes association guidelines18 .
slit - lamp examination ( model sl - 1e ; topcon ) was performed by trained study ophthalmologists and included a clinical grading of cataract according to the lens opacities classification system ( locs ) iii19 .
statistical analyses data analyses were performed using stata version 11.0 ( statacorp , college station , tex. , usa ) .
since ocular dimensions for both eyes were highly correlated ( pearson correlation coefficient for al = 0.96 , p < 0.001 ; acd = 0.91 , p < 0.001 ; vcd = 0.95 , p < 0.001 ; lt = 0.90 , p < 0.001 ) and the results of analysis for both eyes were similar , results were presented for right eyes only .
mean ocular dimension parameters were compared across each age group using the analysis of variance ( anova ) test .
age - sex - adjusted mean values were calculated using a covariance model .
associations between factors of interest and ocular dimension parameters were initially assessed using univariate regression analyses .
besides age , sex and ethnicity , factors with a p value of less than 0.10 in univariate models were retained in the multivariate models .
to determine whether ethnicity modified associations between factors of interest and a specific ocular dimension parameter , a linear regression model was established with interaction terms between ethnicity and each potential risk factor , and a likelihood ratio test was performed on the interaction terms .
if the interaction term was statistically significant ( p < 0.05 ) , stratified analysis were performed subsequently .
results table 1 compares the demographic and systematic parameters among the three ethnic groups .
in brief , adults of bai ethnicity were youngest , best educated , heaviest , had the highest blood pressure and were least likely to smoke or take alcohol drinks .
adults of yi ethnicity were shortest , lightest , and were most likely take alcohol drinks .
adults of han ethnicity had the lowest blood pressures. of the total 6546 study participants , 63 who had missing data in the right eye were excluded , leaving 6483 ( 99 %) for further analysis .
als , acds , and vcds were not normally distributed in any ethnic groups ( all p for k - s test < 0.05 ) .
lts followed a normal distribution in all ethnic groups ( all p for k - s test > 0.05 ) .
the mean age - and sex - adjusted al were 23.15 +/ - 1.23 mm ( 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] 23.11 , 23.20 ) , 23.04 +/ - 1.03 mm ( 95 % ci 23.00 , 23.08 ) and 22.95 +/ - 1.21 mm ( 95 % ci 22.86 , 22.95 ) in ethnic bai , yi and han adults , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) .
these figures were 3.42 +/ - 0.54 mm ( 95 % ci 3.38 , 3.46 ) , 2.98 mm +/ - 0.38 ( 95 % ci 2.94 , 3.02 ) and 2.86 +/ - 0.40 mm ( 95 % ci 2.81 , 2.90 ) for acd ( p < 0.001 ) , 15.35 +/ - 1.35 mm ( 95 % ci 15.31 , 15.40 ) , 15.73 +/ - 1.02 mm ( 95 % ci 15.69 , 15.77 ) and 15.70 +/ - 1.26 mm ( 95 % ci 15.66 , 15.74 ) for vcd ( p < 0.001 ) , and 4.35 +/ - 0.62 mm ( 95 % ci 4.30 , 4.39 ) , 4.48 mm +/ - 0.43 ( 95 % ci 4.44 , 4.52 ) and 4.47 mm +/ - 0.48 ( 95 % ci 4.45 , 4.52 ) for lt ( p = 0.01 ) .
after adjusting for the effect of height , the magnitude of differences in the mean values of ocular dimensions did not change significantly ( table 2 ) .
the age - specific mean ocular biometric data are shown in figs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
in univariate regression analyses , longer als were associated with older age ( p < 0.001 ) , male sex ( p < 0.001 ) , bai ( p < 0.001 ) ethnicity , formal education ( p = 0.005 ) , taller stature ( p < 0.001 ) , greater weight ( p < 0.001 ) , the presence of hypertension ( p = 0.01 ) , and the absence of smoking history ( p < 0.001 ) .
deeper anterior chambers were associated with male sex ( p < 0.001 ) , bai ( p < 0.001 ) or yi ( p < 0.001 ) ethnicity , taller stature ( p < 0.001 ) , formal education ( p = 0.01 ) , and the absence of diabetes ( p < 0.001 ) .
deeper vitreous chambers were associated with older age ( p < 0.001 ) , male sex ( p < 0.001 ) , han ethnicity ( p < 0.001 ) , formal education ( p < 0.001 ) , taller stature ( p < 0.001 ) , greater weight ( p < 0.001 ) , and the presence of hypertension ( p < 0.001 ) .
thicker lenses were associated with younger age ( p < 0.001 ) , male sex ( p < 0.001 ) , formal education ( p < 0.001 ) , taller stature ( p < 0.001 ) , greater weight ( p < 0.001 ) , and the presence of smoking history ( p < 0.001 ) , alcohol intake ( p = 0.001 ) , the presence of cataract ( p < 0.001 ) , and the presence of diabetes ( p = 0.004 ) .
in multivariate linear regression models adjusting for age , sex , ethnicity and factors with a p value of less than 0.10 in univariate models , longer als were associated with older age , male sex , bai or yi ethnicity , formal education , taller stature , greater weight , and the absence of smoking history .
deeper anterior chambers were associated with male sex , bai or yi ethnicity , and the absence of diabetes .
deeper vitreous chambers were associated with older age , male sex , han ethnicity , formal education , taller stature , and greater weight .
thicker lenses were associated with younger age , male sex , the presence of smoking history , alcohol intake , the presence of cataract , and the presence of diabetes ( table 3 ) .
a significant joint effect of diabetes with ethnicity on acd ( p for interaction = 0.02 ) was detected using a likelihood ratio test .
further ethnicity - stratified analysis indicated the association of diabetes with acd ( regression coefficient = - 0.039 mm for bai ethnicity ; regression coefficient = - 0.025 mm for yi ethnicity ; regression coefficient = - 0.017 mm for han ethnicity ) was stronger in adults of bai ethnicity compared with those of yi or han ethnicities in multivariate analyses .
discussion in this multiethnic population of adults aged 50 years or older , we found significant differences in ocular dimensions such as als , acds and vcds but not lts among various ethnic groups with small genetic differences .
adults of bai ethnicity had the deepest anterior but shallowest vitreous chambers among the three ethnic groups .
further well - designed cohort studies are warranted to assess whether the observed ethnic variations in ocular dimensions are related to different risks of age - related eye disorders in this population .
the take - home message of our study was that people of different ethnicities with small genetic differences may also have large differences in ocular dimensions .
previous multiethnic studies have shown a significant ethnic variation in ocular dimensions among different ethnic groups , which was considered to be attributed to the variations in genetics among different ethnic groups .
although previous data indicated that genetic differences in ethnic groups in southwestern china are relatively smaller13 , it needs to be recognized that statements about commonality are based on the overall genome , and a close global relationship does not preclude very specific differentiation between populations .
thus , based on the data in this study , we could not conclude that interplay and effects of cultures , lifestyles , or socioeconomic status in early life might affect the growth of eyeball , resulting in different ocular dimensions in adulthood .
we observed that ethnic bai people had the longest als after adjusting for height among the three ethnic groups .
al is known to be composed of acd , vcd and lt and the longest als observed in bai people were mainly explained by that they had the deepest acds .
the explanation for this interesting finding was unclear .
it is likely that bai people were inherently born with a deeper acd and a shallower vcd compared with other ethnic groups in this study .
further studies are warranted to examine whether the differences in ocular biometry observed in this study had functional implications .
for example , shallower acds are associated with a higher risk of angle closure glaucoma .
therefore , whether bai people are more susceptible to angle closure glaucoma compared with the other two groups needs to be investigated .
another interesting finding of this study was that patients with diabetes were more likely to have shallower anterior chambers and this association was modified by ethnicity .
a recent meta - analysis of 47 individual studies indicated that diabetes is an independent risk factor for glaucoma20 .
some individual studies have also reported that diabetes could increase the risk of open angle glaucoma2122 .
considering that the magnitude of difference was small , we cannot conclude that diabetes is a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma .
further well - designed cohort studies are warranted to confirm this finding and basic research is needed to elucidate the biological mechanism behind this association .
we observed a slightly increasing trend of al and vcd with age in this study .
vcd is a major part of al. this age - related pattern of al was different from other studies in asians living in urban areas , which revealed an inverse relationship between older age and increasing al6723 .
considering that al is a major determinant for refractive status , the namely " cohort effect " on myopia prevalence found in many other population - based studies122425262728 was not observed in this study .
the possible explanation for this result is that the study area is an inland rural town located in the southwest part of china and has not experienced a dramatic change in social and environmental factors during the past few decades as compared with many metropolises in china and other countries in east asia .
there were few studies exploring the ethnic variations in lts and their associated factors .
we found that ethnic variations in lts were not significant after adjusting for the effects of a wide range of confounders .
the major determinants for lts are lifestyle - related factors ( e.g. smoking , alcohol intake ) or metabolic disorders such as cataract or diabetes , suggesting that metabolism plays a major role in crystalline lens growth .
smoking is a well - established risk factor for cataract29 .
heavy alcohol drinking was found to be associated with cataract in a recently published meta - analysis30 .
there is a need to identify the specific metabolic biomarkers which are linked with the growth of crystalline lens .
in addition , it is a surprising to find that lts decreased slightly with increasing age , which contradicted previous view that lts decrease with increasing age .
however , the aged effect on lt was very small and the p value was marginally significant in this study ( p = 0.04 ) .
this observation may be explained by the increases in height and biometry which overshadow the effects of longitudinal change .
it was also likely to be a chance finding .
the study 's strengths included a large sample size , multiethnic study participants , reasonable response rates , standardized clinical measurements for ocular dimensions and the usage of the same study protocols for data collection across different ethnic groups .
there were also some limitations for this study , which should be acknowledged .
first , a - scan ultrasonography may not be precise in measuring some of the ocular dimensions such as lt , especially when cataract is present .
second , we were unable to identify the full set of explanatory factors for the observed ethnic differences in al , acd and vcd .
third , ethnicity was identified by official records in this study .
genetic measures of ancestry may be more accurate for ethnicity identification but was not performed in this study due to limited resources .
finally , the cross - sectional design limited the ability to assess causal relationship when analyzing risk factors .
in conclusion , this study of multiethnic participants living in the same geographic location in rural china found significant ethnic variations in ocular dimensions including als , acds and vcds but not lts , with bai chinese having deeper anterior but shallower vitreous chambers as compared with the other two ethnic groups .
our study also provided the normative data for ocular dimensions in ethnic minorities in china , which are important to guide future clinical practice ( e.g. , cataract or refractive surgery ) or research ( e.g. , designing multi - ethnic clinical trials on al or acd - related conditions such as retinal disorders and glaucoma ) .

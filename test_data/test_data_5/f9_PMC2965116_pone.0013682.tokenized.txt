interpretation of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen ( delta13c and delta15n ) is generally based on the assumption that with each trophic level there is a constant enrichment in the heavier isotope , leading to diet - tissue discrimination factors of 3.4 / 1000 for 15n ( deltan ) and ~ 0.5 / 1000 for 13c ( deltac ) .
diet - tissue discrimination factors determined from paired tissue and gut samples taken from 152 individuals from 26 fish species at ningaloo reef , western australia demonstrate a large amount of variability around constant values .
while caution is necessary in using gut contents to represent diet due to the potential for high temporal variability , there were significant effects of trophic position and season that may also lead to variability in deltan under natural conditions .
nitrogen enrichment increased significantly at higher trophic levels ( higher tissue delta15n ) , with significantly higher deltan in carnivorous species .
changes in diet led to significant changes in deltan , but not tissue delta15n , between seasons for several species : acanthurus triostegus , chromis viridis , parupeneus signatus and pomacentrus moluccensis .
these results confirm that the use of meta - analysis averages for deltan is likely to be inappropriate for accurately determining diets and trophic relationships using tissue stable isotope ratios .
where feasible , discrimination factors should be directly quantified for each species and trophic link in question , acknowledging the potential for significant variation away from meta - analysis averages and , perhaps , controlled laboratory diets and conditions .
introduction the analysis of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen ( delta13c and delta15n ) to determine an organism 's diet and to reconstruct food webs is widespread , and delta13c and delta15n are increasingly being used in the study of coral reef trophodynamics .
interpretation of stable isotope ratios is generally based on the assumption that with each trophic level there is a constant enrichment in the heavier isotope , leading to diet - tissue discrimination factors of 3.4 / 1000 for 15n ( deltan ) and ~ 0.5 / 1000 for 13c ( deltac ) [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
post [ 3 ] noted that , in his meta - analysis , discrimination did not vary significantly with organism body size , between species , functional groups or even habitats , but stressed that average discrimination factors can only be applied to entire food webs , with many multiple trophic pathways and species .
in fact , it is increasingly being recognised that trophic discrimination has a high degree of variability around meta - analysis averages when examined for species or groups , e.g. [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] .
indeed , as vander zanden and rasmussen [ 1 ] note , minagawa and wada 's [ 2 ] value of 3.4 / 1000 for deltan was itself variable , being determined from the mean discrimination in only 16 individual estimates and with a standard deviation of 1.1 / 1000 .
similarly , post 's [ 3 ] value from 56 individual estimates had a standard deviation of 0.98 / 1000 .
despite this variability , many studies using isotope ratios must rely on assumed discrimination constants , often from different tissues or species , to make conclusions about diet or trophic position [ 6 ] .
many recent isotope studies of coral reef fishes apply meta - analysis average discrimination factors to the analysis of a single species or trophic group , e.g. [ 8 ] - [ 12 ] .
while the mechanisms of diet - tissue discrimination are still not completely understood , tissue isotopes are generally accepted to be the result of a dynamic equilibrium between isotopic discrimination during assimilation and excretion [ 13 ] - [ 15 ] .
variability in discrimination is thus not surprising given the range of factors known to influence assimilatory and excretory processes within an organism .
tissue type , age or body size , diet quality , nutritional stress , feeding rate and excretory mechanisms are all known to influence discrimination [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] , [ 15 ] - [ 19 ] , and there can be substantial differences between organisms as a result [ 4 ] .
the fact that feeding on mixed diets [ 20 ] and sample preparation [ 4 ] , [ 7 ] can also significantly influence discrimination factors further argues against applying meta - analysis averages to focused field studies .
using incorrect discrimination constants , even though the error may be small , has the potential to lead to large errors in the estimation of food sources or trophic position [ 4 ] , especially for deltan and studies focused on few species or groups [ 3 ] .
consequently , for accurate estimates of diet or trophic position it is essential that discrimination factors be quantified , whether directly or by modelling e.g. [ 15 ] , and variability accounted for in analyses ( such as through bayesian modelling , e.g. [ 21 ] , [ 22 ]) .
despite the apparent variability and potential consequences , the extent to which changes in the many factors mentioned above can lead to differences in trophic discrimination within and between species in the field is not well quantified .
in this study , discrimination factors are measured for variety of coral reef fishes at ningaloo reef , western australia and examined in the context of spatial and temporal factors that may lead to variation , and hence error in diet or trophic position estimates .
materials and methods site description & experimental overview the study site at sandy bay , ningaloo reef , western australia is a typical fringing reef habitat .
the site , including the prevailing hydrodynamics , is described in detail in wyatt et al .
[ 23 ] .
during may 2007 and may and nov 2008 a total of 152 individual fish specimens were collected with line or spear under the approval of the department of environment and conservation ( permit numbers sf006335 , ce001989 and sw012041 ) .
reef - based fishes were collected from one of seven sites that traverse the reef , from reef slope to lagoon ( figure 1a ) , while pelagic species were caught by trolling along the reef slope in the vicinity of stations 6 and 7 .
upon collection specimens were immediately placed on ice and transported to shore for dissection ( maximum time between collection and dissection was 3 hrs ) .

panels show ( a ) sampling stations 1 to 7 across the reef ( see wyatt et al .
[ 23 ] for more details on the location and hydrodynamics ) ; ( b ) reef zonation and bathymetry between locations derived from hyperspectral imagery ; and ( c ) representative images of the benthic habitat demonstrate the shift from the tabulate hard coral dominated reef flat ( station 1 ) , to patch reef ( 3 ) and sandy lagoon ( 5 ) .
sampling and analysis procedures paired tissue and gut samples were taken from each specimen for isotopic analysis .
tissue samples were dissected from white muscle near the base of the tail , while gut samples were collected , where possible , from the anterior alimentary canal ( very small specimens often precluded separating fore and hind gut contents ) and placed onto whatman gf / f filters .
samples were stored frozen ( - 20degreesc ) until analysis within three months .
tissue samples were dried at 60degreesc for 48 hrs before being ground to a powder using a retsch ( r ) ball mill ( haan , germany ) .
gut samples on gf / f filters were dried for 24 hrs and then acidified dropwise using 1 n hcl to remove carbonaceous material , before being re - dried for 24 hrs .
this method of acidifying filters ( direct , no rinsing ) has been found to be the most effective method of removing the influence of carbonate on delta13c without significantly altering delta15n ( a.s.j.w. , unpublished data ) .
samples were combusted to n2 and co2 in tin capsules ( 12x5 mm , sercon , cheshire , uk ) using an elemental analyser ( anca - gsl , europa scientific ltd. , crewe , uk ) .
the n2 and co2 were purified by gas chromatography and the nitrogen and carbon elemental composition and isotope ratios determined by continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry ( 20 - 20 irms , europa scientific ltd. , crewe , uk ) .
reference materials of known elemental composition and isotopic ratios were interspaced with the samples for calibration ( usgs40 , delta15n = - 4.52 / 1000 , delta13c = - 26.39 / 1000 ; usgs41 , delta15n = 47.57 / 1000 , delta13c = 37.63 / 1000 ) .
raw nitrogen and carbon elemental composition and isotope ratio data were corrected for instrument drift and blank contribution using anca - nt software ( europa scientific ltd. , crewe , united kingdom ) .
nitrogen isotope ratios ( delta15n ) are reported in parts per thousand ( per mil , / 1000 ) relative to n2 in air and carbon isotope ratios ( delta13c ) relative to pee dee belemnite ( v - pdb ) according to the following formula : where x is 15n or 13c and r is the ratio of heavy to light isotope ( 15n : 14n or 13c : 12c ) .
repeatability for delta15n was +/ - 0.17 / 1000 and delta13c +/ - 0.12 / 1000 .
diet - tissue discrimination factors were determined by subtracting the gut isotope value from the tissue value for each specimen : where x is 15n or 13c for tissue ( t ) and gut ( g ) .
statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed in spss v17.0 .
a general linear model analysis of variance ( anova ) was used to check for significant differences between groups after confirming homogeneity of variance using levene 's test .
post - hoc differences were examined with fisher 's lsd .
results nitrogen discrimination factors ( deltan ) were obtained for 126 of the 152 individuals sampled , covering 24 species and four trophic groups ( table 1 ) .
due to instrument overloading , carbon discrimination factors ( deltac ) were only obtained for 111 individuals from 22 species .
amongst these individuals there was evidence of marked deviation in both deltan and deltac away from published constants .
few species displayed average deltan close to 3.4 / 1000 [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , with a study average of 2.4 / 1000 and a wide individual range , - 1.1 to 5.6 / 1000 ( table 1 ) .
carbon discrimination was also widely variable , deltac ranging from - 5.3 to 11 , with a study average of 1.1 / 1000 .
there was a significant relationship between the isotope ratios of an individual 's tissue and its gut contents at the time of sampling , for both delta15n and delta13c ( r2 = 0.138 , p < 0.001 and r2 = 0.583 , p < 0.001 , respectively ; figure 2 ) .

deltan a proportion ( 23 %) of the variation in nitrogen discrimination across the study can be explained by variation in tissue delta15n , with deltan increasing significantly with increasing trophic level ( as indicated by tissue delta15n , r2 = 0.226 ; f [ 1,124 ] = 36.23 , p < 0.001 , figure 3a ) .

there was no relationship for carbon ( r2 = 0.005 ; f [ 1,109 ] = 0.0569 , p = 0.452 ) .
trophic groups had significantly different deltan ( f [ 1,117 ] = 4.192 , p < 0.01 , figure 4a ) .
despite some qualitative evidence of seasonal differences within the trophic groups , there were no significant seasonal differences , or interaction , in the seasonxtrophic group anova model ( but see seasonal difference for individual species below ) .
averaged across seasons , carnivores had higher deltan than other groups and detritivores lower , with herbivores and planktivores not significantly different to each other .

seasonal and spatial aspects of intra - species variation in discrimination are difficult to comprehensively address .
this experiment was designed in a balanced way , so that the same fish species would be sampled in each season at a number of locations .
unfortunately , due to the fact that many coral reef species are associated with different zones , it was not always possible to find the same target species at different sites .
further , the loss of data due to instrument overloading decreased the number of replicate samples .
as such , season and location as factors in changes in trophic discrimination can only be examined for a selected number of species for which data could be obtained in different seasons and / or locations .
there was preliminary evidence of significant seasonal differences in nitrogen discrimination for four species ( 67 % of species with seasonally replicated samples ) .
nitrogen discrimination was significantly lower in may 2008 compared to nov 2008 for pomacentrus moluccensis ( f [ 1,6 ] = 26.08 , p < 0.01 , figure 5a ) , acanthurus triostegus ( f [ 1,7 ] = 7.404 , p < 0.05 , figure 5b ) and parupeneus signatus ( f [ 1,2 ] = 21.66 , p < 0.05 , figure 5c ) and .
in contrast , chromis viridis sampled had significantly higher discrimination in may 2008 ( f [ 1,4 ] = 12.10 , p < 0.05 , figure 5d ) .
increased deltan in nov was accompanied by lower gut delta15n in p. moluccensis ( f [ 1,6 ] = 15.99 , p < 0.01 , figure 5a ) , a. triostegus ( f [ 1,7 ] = 7.418 , p < 0.05 , figure 5b ) and p. signatus ( f [ 1,2 ] = 33.98 , p < 0.05 , figure 5c ) .
in contrast , c. viridis had significantly higher gut delta15n in nov ( f [ 1,4 ] = 15.12 , p < 0.05 , figure 5d ) .
there was no evidence of any significant location effects on deltan , or seasonxlocation interactions , for any of the eleven species sampled at multiple locations and seasons .

deltac in contrast to deltan , there was little evidence of significant inter - and intra - species variation in deltac .
there was no significant relationship between delta13c and deltac ( figure 3b ) , no significant trophic group or seasonal differences , or interactions ( figure 4b ) , and no significant changes in deltac for any of the eleven species sampled at multiple locations and seasons .
there was also no significant relationship between discrimination factors ( deltan or deltac ) and either tissue or gut c : n ratios .
variations in c : n ratios only explained a very small proportion (< 5 %) of the variation in discrimination factors .
discussion this study is the first to attempt to quantify isotope discrimination factors in situ for a variety of fish species across multiple trophic levels .
although the large amount of variability in discrimination factors documented in the study is in part a consequence of conducting the study under inherently variable field conditions and using gut contents as a dietary proxy , the results indicate that caution is necessary in applying discrimination factors to isotope data gathered from natural populations .
there is the potential for significant variation in discrimination factors away from meta - analysis averages or those determined under controlled laboratory conditions .
discrimination in the gut and between tissues a significant potential source of variability in diet - tissue discrimination factors measured in this study was the use of gut contents to represent an individual 's diet .
while tissue samples represent integration over time with respect to nutrient input ( e.g. weeks to months [ 24 ]) , gut samples represent a ' snap shot ' of diet [ 25 ] , containing only material that the specimen ingested immediately before collection ( e.g. hours ) .
thus , in addition to containing material that will be excreted rather than incorporated into the fish 's tissue , the gut may also contain an atypical diet at the time of sampling or significant amounts of non - dietary material , i.e. ingestion does not imply assimilation into tissue .
this kind of variation in gut contents almost certainly contributed in part to the large variation in discrimination factors measured .
differential assimilation of different components of the diet can also mean that tissues reflect the isotopic composition of particular nutrient components from which they are synthesised , rather than the bulk diet [ 20 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] .
there was however a significant relationship between the isotope ratios of an individual 's tissue and its gut contents at the time of sampling , for both delta15n and delta13c , suggesting that , in general , the gut samples were a reasonable representation of the temporally averaged diet assimilated into tissues .
future work should consider investigating the role of differential assimilation of dietary components in driving discrimination factor variation , such as though the use of compound - specific isotope analysis .
there is also the potential for gut contents to be isotopically different to diet due to alteration during ingestion and digestion .
few studies have examined diet - gut isotope differences in fishes , which requires that fishes are fed a controlled diet of known isotopic composition under laboratory conditions .
one of the few studies examining isotopic alteration of gut contents relative to diet during both ingestion and digestion by guelinckx et al .
[ 14 ] suggested that alteration is likely to be small compared to the total discrimination between diet and tissue , especially where fore - gut contents are analysed .
changes in the delta15n of diet in the fore gut of pomatoschistus minutus were small relative to overall discrimination ( diet to tissue ) and negligble for delta13c .
diet to fore gut discrimination ( i.e. largely undigested material ) led to enrichment in delta15n by 1.31 / 1000 ( approximately 20 % of the total deltan of 6.6 / 1000 ) , with no signficant difference in delta13c .
discrimination during digestion ( i.e. diet compared to hindgut / faecal material ) , has been investigated in more detail but without consensus .
results have ranged from depletion [ 28 ] , to no change [ 29 ] to enrichment [ 14 ] , [ 30 ] .
guelinckx et al .
[ 14 ] found that digestive alteration of gut contents , together with the additon of excretory products , represented approximately 9 % and 12 % , respectively , of the total diet to tissue discrimination observed in p. minutus ( 6.6 / 1000 for deltan and 6.66 / 1000 for deltac ) .
while efforts were made in the current study to sample fore gut contents from each specimen , it was very difficult to exclude hind gut contents especially for very small species .
inclusion of mixed gut contents is likely to alter the discrimination measured , since hind gut contents are generally composed increasingly of excretory material that is significantly different isotopically to the diet [ 14 ] .
although it is not possible to definitively determine diet to gut content isotope changes in the field , since the diet is not known , our data tend to support a minimal amount of discrimination between the diet and gut .
as an example , the average gut delta15n of 5.99 / 1000 (+/ - 0.13 , s.e. ) for abudefduf sexfasciatus was very similar to the of delta15n of their assumed zooplankton prey at around 6 / 1000 ( 6.19 / 1000 (+/ - 0.01 ) for the > 500 microm fraction , 6.09 / 1000 (+/ - 0.00 ) for > 300 microm and 6.26 / 1000 (+/ - 0.20 ) for > 105 microm , a.s.j. wyatt , unpublished data ) .
thus any discrimination between diet and gut contents would appear to be negligible compared to the total discrimination between diet / gut and tissue ( deltan of 3.22 (+/ - 0.2 ) for abudefduf sexfasciatus , table 1 ) .
this would appear to support guelinckx et al. ' s [ 14 ] suggestion that the timing of sampling after feeding time , and hence the degree of digestion , is relatively unimportant and does not confound isotopic values for diet determined from gut contents .
although gut content analysis is very difficult for small amounts of gut contents subject to differing degrees of digestion , future more focused studies should consider gut content analysis as a means of directly quantifying dietary components and the role of discrimination during digestion .
variations in tissue composition may also lead to observations of variable discrimination factors .
isotopic composition is known to vary significantly between different tissue types , which in turn vary in composition over different temporal scales [ 19 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
in this study only white muscle tissue was examined for tissue isotope analysis and should therefore represent similar metabolic processes and rates between samples .
however , the carbon isotope composition of fish tissue is known to change depending on lipid content because lipids are 13c - depleted relative to proteins [ 33 ] - [ 35 ] .
lipid extraction significantly alters delta15n , e.g. [ 34 ] but see [ 36 ] , and was not considered suitable in this study where delta15n and delta13c were obtained from a single sample .
further , a meta - analysis by caut et al .
[ 6 ] did not reveal a significant effect of lipid extraction on discrimination factors .
regardless , any potential effect of variation in lipid content between samples would be confined to our estimates of deltac , which showed no significant differences between sample groups .
inter - species differences in discrimination factors the limitations of gut contents for representing diet aside , there are a number of additional factors that could explain the wide variations in discrimination factors within and between species .
differences in discrimination factors between species are expected due to differences in diet and / or metabolic processes .
for instance , mill et al .
[ 16 ] suggested that herbivorous fishes often have markedly higher deltan than the meta - analysis averages of 3.4 / 1000 .
this could be due to differences in the diet quality ( c : n ratio ) of herbivorous relative to carnivorous species ( the latter displaying much more consistent nitrogen discrimination [ 16 ]) and / or metabolic differences ( such as herbivorous fish having greater excretion rates [ 16 ]) .
in contrast , other studies have found that carnivorous species have significantly higher deltan , attributed to a high protein diet [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] .
in the current study , fish species were sampled across a range of trophic levels , with delta15n ranging from 7.4 to 14 / 1000 ( table 1 ) .
the species sampled therefore represent a range of trophic groups expected to have widely different diets , including herbivores , planktivores ( e.g. zooplankton ) , carnivores ( e.g. benthic invertebrates and other fishes ) , and detritivores .
indeed , a proportion ( 23 %) of the variation in nitrogen discrimination across the study was explained by variation in tissue delta15n , with deltan increasing significantly with increasing trophic level .
there were also significant differences in deltan between the trophic groups .
thus , in contrast to the findings of mill et al [ 16 ] , herbivores did not display significantly higher deltan as would be expected a priori based on differences in diet quality ( figure 4a ) .
in fact , diet quality appeared to have little influence on discrimination factors for any trophic groups in this study , with no significant relationships between discrimination factors and either tissue or gut c : n , suggesting that factors other than diet quality led to differences in discrimination between trophic groups .
intra - species differences in discrimination factors variation in diet - tissue discrimination could also be expected at the intra - species level due to differences in diet , feeding rate and assimilatory and excretory mechanisms between individuals .
such differences could reflect the life history stage of the individual , as well as having spatial ( e.g. habitat ) and seasonal components .
ontogenetic changes in diet , as well as metabolism , have previously been demonstrated in coral reef fishes , leading to differences in tissue isotope composition for differently aged organisms of the same species , e.g. [ 37 ] .
thus it could be expected that the degree of discrimination between tissue and diet would also change with size as diet and metabolism changes .
no attempt was made in this study to examine changes in discrimination with fish size , however samples of a single species were targeted so that they were all of a similar size and within the adult size range for that species .
thus , ontogenetic changes in diet and trophic discrimination are unlikely to explain the intra - species variability observed .
two other factors are possible in driving the intra - species seasonal changes in deltan observed : changes in metabolism driven by reproductive cycles or environmental change , or changes in diet .
ningaloo reef is influenced by distinctly seasonal oceanographic conditions that alter both physical conditions on the reef and the biogeochemical environment [ 23 ] .
there is the possibility that reproductive cycles or metabolic changes , for instance due to significantly cooler water temperatures in november than may ( average 24degreesc compared to 28degreesc , a.s.j. wyatt et al. , unpublished data ) , led to seasonal changes in deltan , e.g. [ 5 ] .
however , despite a lack of evidence for significant seasonal change in diet from tissue delta15n , gut delta15n suggests that a change in diet may have been the principal factor in the altered discrimination factors between seasons for all species with sufficient replication for temporal analysis ( although the small sample numbers mean these data should still be viewed as preliminary ) .
the significant increases or decreases in delta15n of gut samples for each species mirrored the direction of change in deltan and were of similar magnitude ( figure 5 ) .
increased deltan in nov appeared to be driven by lower gut delta15n in p. moluccensis , p. signatus and a. triostegus .
interestingly c. viridis , also a planktivore and therefore expected to have a similar diet to p. moluccensis , had significantly higher gut delta15n in nov .
indeed , tissue delta15n suggests these species have similar diets over time , averaging 10.1 and 10.3 / 1000 for c. viridis and p. moluccensis , respectively , so the differences in seasonal change is puzzling and may warrant more detailed investigation .
the seasonally changing diets appeared to alter gut isotope composition but not tissue composition .
there are several potential explanations for this .
firstly , the changes may simply be a reflection of the lag time between the isotope compositions of the diet and tissues changing .
the isotopic composition of a tissue changes in response to diet through two mechanisms : dilution - the formation of new tissue with the new dietary composition , and metabolic turnover - the replacement of old tissue with new during tissue repair [ 19 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 38 ] .
thus , even with significant dietary change , a significant change in tissue delta15n may not be detected if there has not been sufficient time for marked dilution or turnover .
the consistency of measurements within periods , which represent sampling over 3 - 6 weeks , and the time between the two periods ( approximately six months ) suggests that there should have been sufficient time for tissue composition to reflect the diet change .
secondly , the seasonal change in discrimination could be due to the composition of the diet .
there was no evidence of a significant change in diet quality ( c : n ratio of gut contents ) for any of the species that could explain altered discrimination .
feeding on a similar composition prey at a different trophic level could also be expected to alter discrimination .
the gut isotopes of p. moluccensis , p. signatus and a. triostegus , suggest that they were feeding almost a trophic level lower ( average gut delta15n decreased ~ 1.5 - 2.5 / 1000 ) when discrimination was higher , and conversely for c. viridis when discrimination decreased .
this is however contrary to the general increase in discrimination with increasing trophic level ( figure 3a ) , and requires further investigation .
in contrast to apparently strong seasonal effects on discrimination , there was little evidence of any changes with location .
the lack of location effects may be partially due to the fact that many species are mobile and move between feeding sites , thereby integrating any factors likely to affect discrimination .
for instance , there was no significant difference in abudefduf sexfasciatus deltan between stations 1 and 6 , but it is likely that there is exchange of fish at these two nearby stations , with large populations congregating and feeding between the reef slope and forward reef flat .
however , stegastes fasciolatus ( a more site specific species ) also showed no location changes in deltan , even though it was sampled across the reef ( stations and numbers as per table 1 ) , in vastly different habitats ranging from reef slope ( 20 m water depth ) to the shallow reef flat ( 2 m ) , and displayed some evidence of changing diet ( a.s.j.w. , unpublished data ) .
the presumption must therefore be that no diet or metabolic factors changed sufficiently to alter discrimination for s. fasciolatus across this range .
implications of discrimination factor variation the variations in deltan presented above , ranging from trophic group to intra - species level differences , confirm that meta - analysis averages for deltan are likely to be unsuitable for examining diets in a small number of species or a limited number of trophic links under field conditions [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] .
for instance , the application of meta - analysis average diet - tissue discrimination factors to tissue delta15n would mask the apparent species - specific seasonal dietary shifts observed through quantification of deltan in the four species above .
while habitat seemed to have little influence on deltan , seasonality in deltan variation was highly species - specific and requires further examination in future studies if isotope values are to be accurately interpreted .
in contrast , deltac , although variable , did not appear to be significantly influenced by trophic level or group , by season , or by location .
thus , meta - analysis averages may indeed be more applicable in the case of deltac [ 3 ] .
the direct quantification of discrimination factors may be especially important with the increasing use of bayesian mixing models that allow uncertainty in discrimination factors to propagate through the analysis , returning a true probability distribution of estimated dietary proportions , e.g. [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] .
such analysis is dependent on measuring and understanding discrimination factor variation .
furthermore , small differences in discrimination factors also contain important information on the feeding rate and metabolic state of individuals [ 15 ] , and thus may warrant investigation independent of their influence on food web and trophic position analyses .
conclusions although the use of gut contents to represent diet requires some caution , the results of this study confirm that , where feasible , discrimination factors should be directly quantified for each species and trophic link in question , acknowledging the potential for significant variation away from meta - analysis and controlled laboratory averages under variable field conditions .
future studies examining the trophic ecology of fishes at the species level would be greatly enhanced by detailed data on the variability in discrimination factors , ideally obtained from a large number of individuals over space and time .
the addition of tissue and dietary - component specific analysis , such as through compound - specific isotope analysis , is likely to greatly enhance our understanding of the processes influencing discrimination factor variation , and thereby the applicability of stable isotope analyses to trophic ecology .

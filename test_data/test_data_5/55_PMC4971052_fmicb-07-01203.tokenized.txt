the deepwater horizon accident has brought oil contamination of deep - sea environments to worldwide attention .
the risk for new deep - sea spills is not expected to decrease in the future , as political pressure mounts to access deep - water fossil reserves , and poorly tested technologies are used to access oil .
this also applies to the response to oil - contamination events , with bioremediation the only ( bio ) technology presently available to combat deep - sea spills .
many questions about the fate of petroleum - hydrocarbons within deep - sea environments remain unanswered , as well as the main constraints limiting bioremediation under increased hydrostatic pressures and low temperatures .
the microbial pathways fueling oil bioassimilation are unclear , and the mild upregulation observed for beta - oxidation - related genes in both water and sediments contrasts with the high amount of alkanes present in the spilled oil .
the fate of solid alkanes ( tar ) , hydrocarbon degradation rates and the reason why the most predominant hydrocarbonoclastic genera were not enriched at deep - sea despite being present at hydrocarbon seeps at the gulf of mexico have been largely overlooked .
this mini - review aims at highlighting the missing information in the field , proposing a holistic approach where in situ and ex situ studies are integrated to reveal the principal mechanisms accounting for deep - sea oil bioremediation .
marine snow dispersants beta - oxidation hmw pah alcanivorax thalassolituus burn residue seventh framework programme10.13039 / 501100004963312139 deep - sea oil contamination contamination of deep - sea environments with petroleum following accidental spills represents a relatively emerging topic , which received worldwide attention after the deepwater horizon ( dwh ) accident at the gulf of mexico in april 2010 ( joint analysis group [ jag ] , 2010 ) when more than 500'000 tons of crude oil (+ 24 % including gas ; reddy et al. , 2012 ) were discharged at ~ 1500 m below surface level ( bsl ; u.s. geological survey , 2010 ) .
as political reasons will keep pushing for deep - sea oil extraction , use of poorly tested technologies is not expected to decrease the risk of future accidents ( jernelov , 2010 ; thibodeaux et al. , 2011 ) .
spilled oil reaches the deep sea through numerous ways .
surface - water spills form thin layers which partially dissolve , emulsify and diffuse through the water column ( tkalich et al. , 2003 ) , or sink due to the formation of heavier particles ( tar ) ( parinos et al. , 2013 ) .
dispersants enhance oil solubility in water .
extensive injections of the dispersant corexit at deep sea ( about 3 x 106 l ) during the dwh contributed to the formation of a large oil plume at 1000 - 1300 m bsl ( camilli et al. , 2010 ) preventing petroleum - hydrocarbons from reaching the surface ( kujawinski et al. , 2011 ) .
direct contact of the plume with the continental slope was partially responsible for contamination of deep - sea sediments ( romero et al. , 2015 ) .
another vector for sinking oil is the " so - called " marine snow .
oil contamination enhances phytoplankton production of exopolysaccharides ( epss , patton et al. , 1981 ) , whose amphiphilic nature favors hydrophobic - hydrophobic interactions with oil to form particles including microbial biomass that sink downward ( passow et al. , 2012 ) .
this phenomenon represented the main cause for oil transfer to the seafloor during the dwh ( federal interagency solution group , 2010 ; ziervogel et al. , 2014 ; romero et al. , 2015 ) .
in situ oil burning , one of the most widely applied strategies for oil - pollution control , is known to cause seafloor contamination ( wang et al. , 1999 ; federal interagency solution group , 2010 ) .
following mechanical oil recovery through skimming , the unrecoverable oil fraction on the surface is gathered within small areas for controlled burning , which generates denser mixtures of the less volatile fraction of the oil ( resins , asphaltenes ; buist et al. , 1997 ; jezequel et al. , 2014 ) .
finally , geochemical data on the increased heavy - molecular - weight polyaromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) fraction in dwh deep - sea sediments indicated that diesel exhaust from the 6000 vessels conducting safety operations cannot be excluded as contamination factor ( romero et al. , 2015 ; figure 1 ) .
figure 1 the many ways through which accidentally - spilled petroleum - hydrocarbons reach the seafloor and deep - sea .
hmw pah , high molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
there has been little to no effort in assessing the magnitude of deep - sea oil contamination worldwide. between 3200 and 8000 km2 of deep seafloor were impacted with up to 14 % of the dwh spilled - oil ( chanton et al. , 2014 ) , although ~ 22 % could not be traced ( ramseur , 2010 ) .
the impact on deep - sea life was striking .
deep - sea sediments were classified as low to moderately polluted ( romero et al. , 2015 ) ; pore - water from 1000 to 1400 m bsl exerted high toxicity levels and dna mutagenesis ( paul et al. , 2013 ) ; primary production and carbon export to the deep - sea was reduced ( prouty et al. , 2016 ) ; in sea - food , concentration of certain petroleum - hydrocarbons was 1000 times above the threshold for human consumption ( sammarco et al. , 2013 ) .
hydrocarbons enter deep - sea areas also through several geochemical routes ( oil seeps , hydrothermal vents , gas hydrates , asphalt volcanoes ; jorgensen and boetius , 2007 ) .
several microorganisms proficiently use oil as an energy / carbon source preventing its accumulation into marine environments ( head et al. , 2006 ) .
natural niches characterized by fossil hydrocarbons determine microbial community structures featured by unique biochemical equilibria , which form over a time - span of centuries ( jorgensen and boetius , 2007 ) .
conversely , anthropogenically oil - affected sites are non - adapted environments where overabundant carbon loads are discharged within weeks / months .
the enrichment of oil - degrading taxa jump - starting bioremediation coincides with a net loss of biodiversity ( kleindienst et al. , 2015 ) , which can hardly be recovered until excess oil has been depleted .
the oligotrophic nature of marine environments ( garrison , 2015 ) limits oil bioassimilation , which is further impaired at the deep sea by low temperatures , o2 availability , and hydrostatic pressure ( hp ) .
review objective lack of efficient oil recovery technologies at deep sea implies that bioremediation represents the only mean to combat contamination ( lu et al. , 2012 ) .
the dwh spill was investigated through in situ studies employing next - generation sequencing techniques , which were partially backed - up by ex situ experiments .
despite supplying unprecedented information , both approaches failed to describe the exact metabolic routes and constraints in deep - sea bioremediation .
in situ studies using molecular techniques could only provide information on potential activities while , with no exception , ex situ studies neglected the impact of one of the major drivers for biodiversity in marine environments , i.e. , hp ( ghiglione et al. , 2012 ) .
while previous overviews focused on microbial succession ( kimes et al. , 2014 ) , marine snow formation ( joye et al. , 2014 ) and hydrocarbon fate ( king et al. , 2015 ) following the dwh , this mini - review aims at highlighting the open questions concerning the physiology of oil bioremediation at deep - sea hp conditions .
in situ molecular studies : deep - sea plume upon injection , dwh spilled - oil was composed of 74 , 16 , and 10 % saturated , aromatic and polar hydrocarbons , respectively ; gas represented 24 % of the spill , while oil comprised 76 % ( alkanes being 32 % of the total ; table 1 ) .
fractionation due to physicochemical factors ( and dispersants application ; kujawinski et al. , 2011 ) resulted into different petroleum mixtures affecting water and sediment .
the oil plume was mainly composed of gaseous and monoaromatic compounds ( table 1 ) .
a hydrocarbon - dependent microbial community restructuring was proposed for the plume .
following a first enrichment in oceanospirillales and pseudomonas ( may 2010 ) , the relative increase in aromatic hydrocarbons as compared to aliphatic and cycloalkanes following partial cap closure ( june 4 , 2010 ) coincided with a general shift in dominance to colwellia , cycloclasticus , pseudoalteromonas and methylotrophs lasting until mid - august 2010 ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; valentine et al. , 2010 ; kessler et al. , 2011 ; lu et al. , 2012 ; mason et al. , 2012 ; dubinsky et al. , 2013 ; rivers et al. , 2013 ; kleindienst et al. , 2015 ) .
before partial closure of the well , metagenomic ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; lu et al. , 2012 ; mason et al. , 2012 ) and metatranscriptomic ( mason et al. , 2012 ; rivers et al. , 2013 ) analyses evidenced an upregulation of genes related to hydrocarbon degradation , although a consensus could not be reached .
upregulation of genes or pathways related to monoaromatics or pah degradation was observed in all studies to different extents ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; lu et al. , 2012 ; mason et al. , 2012 ; rivers et al. , 2013 ) .
mason et al .
( 2012 ) found a higher level of gene and transcript reads related to the degradation of n - alkanes rather than aromatics , contrary to hazen et al .
( 2010 ) .
the latter would be in contrast with data from the same group indicating that n - alkane and cycloalkane concentrations correlated with the enriched communities before partial closure ( dubinsky et al. , 2013 ) .
similarly , the upregulation of the cyclohexanone degradation pathway as detected in mason et al .
( 2012 ) was negligible in hazen et al .
( 2010 ) .
upregulation of alkane - 1 mono - oxygenases responsible for n - alkane activation was detected in all studies ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; lu et al. , 2012 ; mason et al. , 2012 ; rivers et al. , 2013 ) .
following activation , n - alkanes should enter beta - oxidation ( rojo , 2009 ) , but genes related to this pathway were only partially upregulated in mason et al .
( 2012 ) and rivers et al .
( 2013 ) .
upregulation of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation genes ( lu et al. , 2012 ) was consistent with that for nitrate reduction ( rivers et al. , 2013 ) , although o2 levels were marginally affected at that time ( camilli et al. , 2010 ; hazen et al. , 2010 ) .
as 16s rrna gene signatures persisted long after the plume had dissipated ( joye et al. , 2014 ) , such controversies concerning structure - function relationships highlight the need for more data integration ( widder et al. , 2016 ) .

lack of significant o2 respiration in the plume early in the spill contrasts with the enhanced cell number ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; mason et al. , 2012 ; kleindienst et al. , 2015 ) .
sustained aerobic biodegradation would be expected to result in increased co2 production and decreased ph , but none of these phenomena were reported .
the ease of hydrocarbon degradation would suggest the plume to be enriched in n - alkane degraders as proposed for gaseous compounds ( valentine et al. , 2010 ) and the oceanospirillales group found by hazen et al .
( 2010 ) , but the preferential molecular response to aromatics brings this hypothesis into question .
the fate of n - alkanes (> c6 ) and the lack of a strong beta - oxidation upregulation in the plume remain unexplained .
persistent o2 anomalies were observed following well closure ( july 15 , 2010 ) .
their strong intensity was used to track the oil plume moving southwestward ( du and kessler , 2012 ) and associated with heterotrophic degradation of high - molecular - weight organics rather than oil ( dubinsky et al. , 2013 ) - possibly due to marine snow formation after the spill ( ziervogel et al. , 2014 ) - or with aerobic degradation of gaseous hydrocarbons ( kessler et al. , 2011 ) .
the latter would be consistent with enriched methylotrophs at that time ( kessler et al. , 2011 ; redmond and valentine , 2012 ; dubinsky et al. , 2013 ; kleindienst et al. , 2015 ) .
however , actual ch4 respiration rates were inconsistent throughout the spill ( crespo - medina et al. , 2014 ) and ch4 mono - oxygenase upregulation before may - june 2010 is still under debate ( joye et al. , 2014 ; kimes et al. , 2014 ; king et al. , 2015 ) .
joye et al .
( 2014 ) suggest that some presently unknown factor hampered ch4 respiration after mid - june .
as it stands , venting to the atmosphere could not be excluded ( rivers et al. , 2013 ) .
in situ molecular studies : deep - sea sediments deepwater horizon sediments were investigated through metagenomic analysis of seafloor ( mason et al. , 2014 ) and sub - seafloor ( kimes et al. , 2013 ) samples in september - october 2010 .
superficial samples ( 0 - 1 cm ) within 5 km of the wellhead were the most impacted , and were enriched in uncultured gammaproteobacteria and colwellia - related organisms similar to the ones in the plume , and in uncultured rhodobacteraceae ( mason et al. , 2014 ) .
highly impacted sediments showed increased levels of monoaromatic degradation genes , no relation with pah and o2 respiration , thus partly resembling results obtained for plume samples in may - june ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; lu et al. , 2012 ; rivers et al. , 2013 ) .
sub - seafloor samples ( 1 - 3 cm deep ) close to the wellhead ( 0.5 and 6 km , kimes et al. , 2013 ) were enriched in several deltaproteobacteria , although alpha - and gammaproteobacteria remained predominant ( kimes et al. , 2013 ) .
enhanced expression of the bssa gene was consistent with increased benzylsuccinate levels formed via the fumarate pathway .
conversely , no alkylsuccinate or alkylmalonate metabolites related to alkane degradation were found despite the corresponding assa gene being upregulated and alkanes up to n - docosane being detected ( kimes et al. , 2013 ) , reflecting the uncertain fate of n - alkanes (> c6 ) in the plume .
consistently , genes related to fatty acids metabolism were poorly expressed in seafloor sediments close to the wellhead ( kimes et al. , 2013 ) and expression levels were comparable to pre - spill samples ( kimes et al. , 2013 ) .
one year later , n - alkanes ( c8 - c38 ) were 10 - 1000 times more concentrated than pah in the sediments ( liu et al. , 2012 ) , suggesting that the degradation of pah was faster than that of n - alkanes ( yergeau et al. , 2015 ; table 1 ) .
as for the plume , ch4 respiration rates in sediments are uncertain .
after 1 year , the upper ( 0 - 2 cm ) sediments located 2 - 6 km from the wellhead were populated by actinobacteria , firmicutes , chloroflexi and several type i methylotrophs ( liu and liu , 2013 ) .
provided that ch4 levels in the plume were low in october 2010 ( kessler et al. , 2011 ; crespo - medina et al. , 2014 ) , it appears unlikely that plume - related ch4 could persist in sediments until may 2011 .
ch4 accumulation may result from long - term anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation ( widdel and rabus , 2001 ) , which would be in agreement with the presence of desulfobacterium ( liu and liu , 2013 ) .
alternatively , acetotrophic methanogens may have been stimulated by an increase in acetate produced by acetogenic hydrocarbon - degrading so4 - reducing bacteria ( srb ) .
together with the upregulated nitrification in september - august 2010 ( mason et al. , 2014 ) , the available data suggest that persistent oil - contamination affects o2 seafloor levels indefinitely , supporting anaerobic benthic microbial activity .
ex situ microbiology and lab - scale hp experiments none of the ex situ experiments on dwh deep - sea samples applied hp ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; valentine et al. , 2010 ; baelum et al. , 2012 ; redmond and valentine , 2012 ; gutierrez et al. , 2013b ; mckay et al. , 2013 ; mason et al. , 2014 ; yergeau et al. , 2015 ; dombrowski et al. , 2016 ) .
despite the persistence of n - alkanes and mild beta - oxidation upregulation , ex situ14c - experiments reported high n - alkane degradation in sediment ( mason et al. , 2014 ) and water samples ( yergeau et al. , 2015 ) .
oiled beach sands were enriched in gammaproteobacteria ( alcanivorax , marinobacter ) and alphaproteobacteria ( rhodobacteraceae ; kostka et al. , 2011 ) .
while some rhodobacteraceae were found in deep - sea waters ( dubinsky et al. , 2013 ) and sediments ( mason et al. , 2014 ) , neither marinobacter nor alcanivorax were enriched , contrary to other alteromonadales and oceanospirillales ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; dubinsky et al. , 2013 ; yang et al. , 2014 ) .
other hydrocarbonoclastic oceanospirillales as thalassolituus , oleiphilus , neptunomonas , or oleispira were only reported because they consist of species closely related to the oceanospirillales group identified in the plume ( 97 % , oleispira antarctica and t. oleivorans ; hazen et al. , 2010 ) .
these isolates degrade long - chain hydrocarbons ( joye et al. , 2014 ) , which were not particularly enriched in the plume ( table 1 ) .
low temperature was proposed to account for this ( redmond and valentine , 2012 ) , although species as o. antarctica are psychrophilic ( yakimov et al. , 2003 ) and many of these genera populate hydrocarbon - seeps in the gulf of mexico ( king et al. , 2013 ) .
the reason why these predominant hydrocarbonoclastic genera were not enriched at deep - sea is currently unknown .
a moderately piezophilic marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus strain could grow on c16 at 35 mpa (~ 3 times higher than dwh plume hp ; grossi et al. , 2010 ) .
as alcanivorax abundance in bathypelagic water ( gutierrez et al. , 2013b ) and sediments was low ( kimes et al. , 2013 ) and unrelated to hydrocarbons ( kimes et al. , 2013 ) its contribution to deep - sea bioremediation was considered negligible ( gutierrez et al. , 2013b ) .
alcanivorax isolates were obtained from decompressed water samples ( gutierrez et al. , 2013b ) resembling results and hp conditions for oil mousses ( liu and liu , 2013 ) and beach sands ( kostka et al. , 2011 ) .
alcanivorax species isolated from 2682 to 5000 m bsl ( up to 50 mpa , liu and shao , 2005 ; lai et al. , 2011 ) could not grow below 10degreesc , i.e. , at much higher temperature values than those registered for these depths (< 4degreesc ) .
another alcanivorax strain was isolated from 668 m bsl (~ 6.7 mpa , lai et al. , 2013 ) .
however , the isolation protocols employed in these studies did not apply hp. the first hp experiments on alcanivorax were reported by the present group ( scoma and boon , 2016 ; scoma et al. , 2016a,b ) .
a mild increase to 5 mpa (~ 500 m bsl ) was sufficient to impair cell replication in alcanivorax dieselolei and a. jadensis .
increase to 10 mpa in a. dieselolei ( approximately the oil plume hp ) further impaired growth , in concomitance with a general downregulation of its genome expression .
the few upregulated pathways related to protein translation , energy production and na + transporters ( scoma et al. , 2016a,b ) .
similarly , in the type strain alcanivorax borkumensis sk2 the increased cell damage at 10 mpa was consistent with the intracellular accumulation of the piezolyte ectoine , and further studies on hypo - and hyper - osmotic stimulation highlighted that enhanced cell metabolism or integrity did not improve growth at 10 mpa ( scoma and boon , 2016 ) .
hydrostatic pressure affects enzyme folding ( oger and jebbar , 2010 ) , cellular components ( bartlett et al. , 1995 ) and functions , which may be gradually downregulated , triggered ( clouston and wills , 1970 ; kalchayanand et al. , 2002 ; ishii et al. , 2004 ) or non - linearly induced ( pagan and mackey , 2000 ) .
sphingobium yanoikuyae growth was suddenly impaired at > 8.8 mpa when supplying naphthalene ( or glucose , schedler et al. , 2014 ). a. borkumensis cultures growing on c12 were inactivated at 5 mpa but could grow at 10 mpa ( scoma et al. , 2016b ) .
both growth and c16 degradation rates were reduced at 15 mpa in rhodococcus qingshengii ( schedler et al. , 2014 ) .
hp impact on oil biodegradation rates has been critically overlooked .
hazen et al .
( 2010 ) proposed half - lives of 6 days for plume - related n - alkanes supported by ex situ ambient pressure experiments , while in situ measurements indicated 1 month half - lives for water - soluble petroleum - hydrocarbons ( reddy et al. , 2012 ) .
the main constraints to deep - sea oil bioremediation are yet to be elucidated .
injection of 3 x 106 liters of corexit dispersant at deep sea implies that bioavailability was considered a major issue .
the negligible degradation rates of its key components and its unknown effect on deep - sea environments ( kujawinski et al. , 2011 ) challenge this assumption .
understanding whether biosurfactant production or microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons is limited by hp and / or temperature may already assist policymakers in establishing efficient protocols for deep - sea bioremediation .
future perspectives the limited literature on lab - scale oil degradation under hp ( schwarz et al. , 1974 , 1975 ; grossi et al. , 2010 ; schedler et al. , 2014 ; scoma and boon , 2016 ; scoma et al. , 2016a,b ) does not explain how microbes cooperate / compete for petroleum - hydrocarbons , extracellular metabolites , o2 or nutrients .
the main structure - function mechanisms shaping microbial communities following deep - sea spills are unclear .
cell growth in the plume was proposed as a main response to oil release ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; mason et al. , 2012 ; kleindienst et al. , 2015 ) .
however , metadata also indicated an enhanced response to stress ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; rivers et al. , 2013 ) including starvation ( lu et al. , 2012 ; rivers et al. , 2013 ) , carbon storage ( rivers et al. , 2013 ) , and resistance to metals ( hazen et al. , 2010 ; lu et al. , 2012 ) .
similar results were obtained with sediments ( kimes et al. , 2013 ; mason et al. , 2014 ; yergeau et al. , 2015 ) .
the m. hydrocarbonoclasticus tested at 35 mpa by grossi et al .
( 2010 ) used c16 to feed both growth and the accumulation of intracellular wax esters .
however , microbial dynamics may respond to compounds not typically analyzed in field samples as polar compounds ( reddy et al. , 2012 ) .
state - of - the - art technology can already be used to face the problem of deep - sea oil bioremediation by integrating molecular , physiological , and biochemical tools in a fully controlled environment .
in situ hydrocarbon degradation rates must be confirmed by ex situ hp experiments in vivo and in vitro .
recent reports on methanotroph enrichments stressed the importance of cultivation techniques ( dedysh et al. , 2012 ) , supporting the use of synthetic communities to highlight the contribution of different individual genera to biodegradation activities .
some microbial representatives produce eps to increase oil bioavailability for the benefit of the whole community ( gutierrez et al. , 2013a ) .
enriched communities may be composed of opportunistic microbes which do not contribute to oil remediation .
defining the exact role of primary oil degraders with respect to other genera is key to addressing the specific requirements of each representative , and may explain how deep - sea areas are evolving following oil spills .
continuously operated hp systems may prevent accumulation of toxic compounds and provide more accurate data on microbial kinetics ( zhang et al. , 2010 , 2011 ) .
isotopic experiments under hp should clarify whether oil fuels cell division , production of secondary metabolites or other unexpected activities .
improved biodegradation rates through the supply of critical nutrients should be compared with the impact of dispersants .
the fate of tar components should be characterized , together with the role of srb in long - term exposed sediments .
these considerations must extend to temperature , as warmer seas may possess a different microbial potential ( e.g. , the warm bathypelagic mediterranean sea ) .
deep - sea hp and low temperature impact the physicochemical state of the oil ( reddy et al. , 2012 ) affecting its bioavailability .
low temperature is expected to slow microbial kinetics and select for psychrophiles ( atlas and bartha , 1972 ) .
provided that deep - sea oil bioremediation is affected by the interplay between several biological and physical factors , laboratory experiments must consider hp and temperature simultaneously to mimic deep - sea conditions .

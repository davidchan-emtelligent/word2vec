global regulator satb1 recruits beta - catenin and regulates th2 differentiation in wnt - dependent manner for microbial invaders to establish an infection , they must overcome the defenses mounted by one of the body 's staunchest defenders , the t cell .
t cells come in several different flavors , each with a specific role to play .
cytotoxic t cells battle intracellular pathogens , while helper t cells ( th cells ) direct antibody production and orchestrate the overall immune response by secreting intercellular messaging proteins known as cytokines .
th cells can differentiate further into two major types ( known as th1 or th2 cells ) , which can be distinguished from one another based on which cytokines they secrete .
in order to mount an effective immune response , t cells of all kinds must be able to recognize foreign invaders while also ignoring body - derived materials .
therefore , before they differentiate into cytotoxic t cells or th cells , immature t cells ( known as thymocytes because they are found in the thymus ) go through a series of checkpoints to ensure they fulfill these requirements .
during this lengthy checking process , thymocytes require external signals to help support their growth .
one of these support signals is provided by wingless ( wnt ) proteins .
first characterized in flies as a mutation that impairs thoracic segment development , wnt signaling works similarly in all organisms ; when soluble wnt proteins bind to their receptors on cells , they initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in the accumulation of the protein beta - catenin in the cells' nucleus .
there , beta - catenin binds to and activates other proteins ( known as transcription factors ) that control the expression of genes needed for cell growth .
in this issue of plos biology , dimple notani , sanjeev galande , and colleagues provide novel insights into how the transcription factor special at - rich binding protein 1 ( satb1 ) , known to be required for t cell development , affects the outcome of beta - catenin signaling at the transcription level .
they show how beta - catenin and satb1 interact in t cells to affect th cell growth and differentiation .
satb1 is expressed primarily in thymocytes and in th2 cells .
it is known to bind to dna , tethering dna to the protein scaffolding that lines the nucleus .
this helps organize dna into tidy loops for better control of gene expression .
satb1 also serves as a molecular adaptor for several other proteins that work to pack dna into an inactive state .
in this way , satb1 is thought to repress the activity of genes found nearby its dna binding sites .
however , some of the genes satb1 represses are known to be upregulated by wnt signals - a fact that led notani and colleagues to explore whether ( and how ) satb1 and wnt signaling might interact in t cells .
when the authors examined the nuclei of wnt - stimulated thymocytes under a microscope , they found that satb1 and beta - catenin ( the major nuclear component of wnt signaling ) are present in the same parts of the nucleus , suggesting these two proteins might directly interact .
subsequent experiments showed that satb1 and beta - catenin are not just in proximity to each other , but actually bind directly to one another : the first half of satb1 protein binds to beta - catenin , while the last part of beta - catenin binds to satb1 .
the finding that satb1 and beta - catenin bind to one another led the researchers to examine whether wnt signaling might cause satb1 to recruit beta - catenin to genes .
they found that wnt signaling causes an increase in satb1 dna binding by promoting the deacetylation of satb1 - - a modification that is known to increase satb1 's affinity for dna .
what 's more , this increased satb1 binding to genes is mirrored by increased levels of beta - catenin on those same genes .
collectively , these data suggest that wnt signaling increases satb1 binding to dna , and that satb1 then recruits beta - catenin to dna .
once beta - catenin is bound to satb1 , beta - catenin can recruit additional partners to help stimulate gene expression , thereby indirectly converting satb1 from a repressor to an activator of gene expression .
the authors' findings add an important new detail to our understanding of the role played by both satb1 and wnt in thymocytes .
but , because satb1 is specifically expressed in th2 cells , notani and colleagues also wanted to explore what contributions satb1 ( and wnt signaling ) might make to th2 cell differentiation .
they found that th cells of all kinds make wnt proteins and so can stimulate themselves with wnt signals .
however , th2 cells experience higher levels of wnt signaling than do th1 cells .
therefore , in th2 cells , satb1 and beta - catenin can cooperate to promote the expression of gata3 , another transcription factor that is known to control the differentiation and development of th2 cells , thereby promoting the production of th2 - characteristic cytokines .
these new insights will allow researchers to better understand how t cell development is controlled by chromatin organizing factors in collaboration with various signaling processes , how this process can go awry , and the diseases that can result from t cell - related immune disorders ( including autoimmunity or immune deficiencies ) .

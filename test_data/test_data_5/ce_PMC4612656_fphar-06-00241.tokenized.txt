the scaffold protein syntenin abounds during fetal life where it is important for developmental movements .
in human adulthood , syntenin gain - of - function is increasingly associated with various cancers and poor prognosis .
depending on the cancer model analyzed , syntenin affects various signaling pathways .
we previously have shown that syntenin allows syndecan heparan sulfate proteoglycans to escape degradation .
this indicates that syntenin has the potential to support sustained signaling of a plethora of growth factors and adhesion molecules .
here , we aim to clarify the impact of syntenin loss - of - function on cancer cell migration , growth , and proliferation , using cells from various cancer types and syntenin shrna and sirna silencing approaches .
we observed decreased migration , growth , and proliferation of the mouse melanoma cell line b16f10 , the human colon cancer cell line ht29 and the human breast cancer cell line mcf7 .
we further documented that syntenin controls the presence of active beta1 integrin at the cell membrane and g1 / s cell cycle transition as well as the expression levels of cdk4 , cyclin d2 , and retinoblastoma proteins .
these data confirm that syntenin supports the migration and growth of tumor cells , independently of their origin , and further highlight the attractiveness of syntenin as potential therapeutic target .

loss - of - function studies in xenopus and zebrafish indicated that syntenin plays an important role in early developmental movements by controlling the non - canonical wnt - signaling pathway ( luyten et al. , 2008 ; lambaerts et al. , 2012 ) , among others .
loss of syntenin function in mice has comparatively little effects .
indeed , tamura et al .
( 2015 ) recently reported a mild phenotype in intestinal homeostasis .
syntenin is detectable in adult human tissues , but an increasing number of independent studies indicate that syntenin is overexpressed in various patient tumor samples .
syntenin gain - of - function was first described in metastatic melanoma ( helmke et al. , 2004 ) , and more recently in breast cancer ( qian et al. , 2013 ; yang et al. , 2013 ) and in multiple neuroepithelial tumors ( kegelman et al. , 2014 ) suggesting that syntenin could be a tumor marker .
for example , in breast cancer patients , the correlation between syntenin expression , tumor size , lymph node status , and recurrence appears statistically significant ( yang et al. , 2013 ) .
in cellular models , by in vitro but also in vivo approaches with xenografts , several studies have shown that elevated syntenin expression is particularly relevant for invasion and metastasis ( koo et al. , 2002 ; boukerche et al. , 2005 ; das et al. , 2013 ; liu et al. , 2014 ) .
depending on the cellular context , syntenin has been associated with the activation of various signaling pathways , including src / p38mapk / nfkb in human melanoma ( boukerche et al. , 2005 , 2007 , 2008 , 2010 ) , in human glioblastoma multiform ( gbm ) ( kegelman et al. , 2014 ) , and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma angiogenesis ( oyesanya et al. , 2014 ) , integrin beta1 / erk1 / 2 in human breast cancer cells ( yang et al. , 2013 ) , egfr / akt / pi3k in urothelial cell carcinoma ( dasgupta et al. , 2013 ) , hif - 1alpha / igfbp - 2 in human melanoma angiogenesis ( das et al. , 2013 ) , and stat3 / pi3k / ctnnb1 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma angiogenesis ( oyesanya et al. , 2014 ) .
syntenin is a scaffold protein containing two post synaptic density - 95 , disc - large tumor suppressor and zonula occludens - 1 ( pdz ) domains that we originally identified as an intracellular adaptor for the syndecan family of heparan sulfate ( hs ) proteoglycans ( grootjans et al. , 1997 ) .
hs proteoglycans are highly abundant in adherent cells and their hs chains have numerous ligands , including various morphogens , adhesion molecules , and growth factors , such as wnts , fibronectin and fgfs , whose deregulated signaling is involved in cancer development and progression ( fuster and esko , 2005 ) .
hs plays an important role in the docking of these factors to cognate signaling receptors and can connect and regulate many signaling systems in a cell - type and cell - context dependent manner .
besides interacting with syndecans , the pdz domains of syntenin can also directly interact with various membrane proteins and receptors ( beekman and coffer , 2008 ) , including frizzled wnt receptors that can rely on syndecans for their functions ( luyten et al. , 2008 ) .
in structure - function studies , we demonstrated that syntenin allows syndecans and associated molecules to escape degradation by promoting their recycling to the plasma membrane ( zimmermann et al. , 2005 ) or their secretion as exosomal cargo ( baietti et al. , 2012 ; ghossoub et al. , 2014 ; friand et al. , 2015 ; roucourt et al. , 2015 ) .
these studies are entirely consistent with the observation that syntenin can boost various signaling pathways when overexpressed in cancer cells .
the functional versatility of syndecans also explains that syntenin gain - of - function can support various signaling pathways and that specific effects can be cell - type dependent .
as a starting point to evaluate the potential benefit of anti - syntenin drugs , we here aimed to document and compare the impact of syntenin loss - of - function on the migration , invasion , growth , and proliferation of various model cancer cell lines .

results generation and validation of various cancer cell lines depleted in syntenin to evaluate the impact of syntenin loss - of - function in cancer cells , we selected three different models : mouse melanoma b16f10 ( mixture of spindle - shaped and epithelial - like cells , mutated for p53 , ras wild - type , highly metastatic and invasive ) , human colorectal adenocarcinoma ht29 ( epithelial cells , mutated for p53 , ras wild - type , highly metastatic , and invasive ) and human breast adenocarcinoma mcf7 ( epithelial cells , er - positive , p53 , and ras wild - type , non - metastatic , poorly invasive ) .
b16f10 and ht29 cells , express higher levels of syntenin in comparison to mcf7 cells ( figure 1a ) .
to generate cell populations stably depleted for syntenin , we used retroviral - mediated gene transduction of small hairpin rnas ( shrna ) .
one shrna molecule ( shrna ) and two different shrna molecules ( shrna2 and 3 ) were used to efficiently knockdown syntenin expression in mouse and human cells , respectively ( figure 1b ) .
after selection , the levels of syntenin were assessed by western blot .
the control shrna , used as control , did not significantly affect syntenin expression when compared to empty vector transduced cells .
shrna targeting syntenin induced a significant decrease in syntenin expression in b16f10 cells ( down by 80 % compared to control levels ) , in ht29 cells ( down by 70 and 75 % compared to control levels for the two different shrna , respectively ) and in mcf7 cells ( down by 60 and 65 % compared to control levels for the two different shrna , respectively ) ( figure 1c ) .

syntenin loss - of - function impairs cell migration we then evaluated the effect of syntenin silencing on the migratory potential of the various cell lines .
we measured cellular migration in wound healing ( figure 2a and supplementary figure 1a ) and transwell migration assays ( figure 2b and supplementary figure 1b ) .
to exclude any influence of cell proliferation on cell migration , we performed our experiments in the presence of 1 ng / ml of mitomycin to block cell division ( dow et al. , 2007 ) .
control shrna , used as control , did not affect syntenin migration significantly when compared to empty vector transduced cells .
shrna targeting syntenin induced a significant decrease in cellular migration by wound healing assay in b16f10 cells ( down by 44 % compared to control levels ) , in ht29 cells ( down by 35 and 37 % compared to control levels for the two different shrna , respectively ) and in mcf7 cells ( down by 28 and 35 % compared to control levels for the two different shrna , respectively ) ( figure 2a ) .
shrna targeting syntenin also induced a significant decrease in cellular migration in transwell migration assays in b16f10 cells ( down by 38 % compared to control levels ) , in ht29 cells ( down by 28 and 30 % compared to control levels for the two different shrna , respectively ) and in mcf7 cells ( down by 35 and 36 % compared to control levels for the two different shrna , respectively ) ( figure 2b ) .
in an attempt to identify mechanisms that could explain perturbed migration , we compared the tubulin cytoskeleton pattern , as well as the membrane distribution of active integrin beta1 in control and syntenin - depleted cells in regular 2d cultures .
while tubulin cytoskeleton did not display drastic differences ( data not shown ) , the plasma membrane / cell borders staining of the active form of integrin beta1 was clearly less marked in syntenin - depleted cells than in controls ( shown for b16f10 cells ) ( figure 2c ) .
altogether , these results indicate that syntenin expression supports b16f10 , ht29 and mcf7 cancer cell migration .

syntenin loss - of - function impairs anchorage - independent cell growth and cellular proliferation the role of syntenin in cell growth was investigated using in vitro plate colony formation assays ( figures 3a,b ) and soft agar colony formation assays ( figures 3c,d ) .
the number of colonies was significantly decreased in syntenin - depleted b16f10 , ht29 , and mcf7 cells compared to control cells , i.e. , cells expressing empty vectors .
in mcf7 cells , two different shrna induced a drastic reduction of plate colony formation , decreasing , respectively , by 85 and 88 % compared to control .
in b16f10 and ht29 cells , the reduction of colony numbers was less drastic but still significant , with a decrease by 30 % in b16f10 and by 36 or 38 % in ht29 cells depending on the shrna ( figures 3a,b ) .
we also performed soft agar colony formation assays to test cellular abilities to form colonies in three dimensions because this assay is considered as the most stringent test for the detection of anchorage - independent tumor cell growth ( horibata et al. , 2015 ) .
shrna targeting syntenin induced a 49 % decrease in the growth of b16f10 cells , a 20 or 33 % decrease in the growth of ht29 cells and a 44 or 46 % decrease in the growth of mcf7 cells ( respective values for the two different shrna ) ( figures 3c,d ) .
control shrna , used as control , did not significantly affect colony formation , neither in plate nor in soft agar assays , when compared to empty vector transduced b16f10 and ht29 cells .
surprisingly , control shrna significantly affected colony formation of mcf7 cells in both assays .
the reason for this specific effect in mcf7 cells is unknown .
while a priori this observation does not change the conclusion that syntenin depletion affects the growth of mcf7 cells , it indicates that from a quantitative point of view , data should be interpreted with caution .

we also tested the effect of syntenin depletion by transiently downregulating syntenin expression , using small interfering rna ( sirna ) .
effective syntenin knockdown by mouse and human syntenin sirnas over a period of 4 days was validated by western blot analysis ( figure 4a ) .
in these experiments , syntenin expression was downregulated by 90 - 95 % compared to controls .
we tested the proliferation of b16f10 , ht29 , and mcf7 cells transiently transfected with non - targeting control sirna ( si ctrl ) and syntenin sirna ( si syntenin ) by counting the number of viable cells every day over a period of 5 days ( figure 4b ) .
control b16f10 and ht29 cells ( si ctrl ) showed a 30 - fold increase in cell number after 5 days , while control mcf7 cells showed a 20 - fold increase .
syntenin - depleted b16f10 and ht29 cells ( sisyntenin ) showed a 15 - fold increase in cell number after 5 days , while syntenin - depleted mcf7 cells showed a 10 - fold increase .
a significant difference between controls and syntenin - depleted cells was observed in all models at day 2 and later times ( figure 4b ) .
an effect of syntenin depletion on cell death could be ruled out because we observed in controls and syntenin depleted cells a similar extremely low number of trypan blue ( supplementary figure 2 ) and annexin - v positive cells ( supplementary figure 3 ) .
to further validate syntenin effects on cellular proliferation , we also performed rescue experiments with mcf7 cells .
cells were treated with control ( si ctrl ) and syntenin sirnas ( si syntenin ) for 24 h and then transiently transfected with an expression vector for wild - type syntenin mutated for the sirna targeting sequence ( syntenin oe ) or the empty vector as a control .
total cell lysates analyzed by western blot indicated rescue of syntenin expression above the control levels in mcf7 cells at 48h ( figure 4c ) , but these levels were still in the physiological range commonly observed in cell cultures .
rescued mcf7 cells showed a significant improvement of proliferation at day 2 and later , and 30 - fold increase in cell number after 5 days of culture ( figure 4d ) .
we assume that this increase in proliferation ( by a factor 1.5 at day 5 when compared to control cells - si ctrl in figure 4b ) , might result from the slight gain of syntenin expression in rescued cells .
altogether , the above data indicate that syntenin supports the capacity of single cells to form colonies , anchorage - independent cell growth , and proliferation in b16f10 , ht29 , and mcf7 cells and that cellular proliferation might be directly correlated to syntenin expression levels .

syntenin loss of function impairs g1 / s cell cycle transition to better understand the effect of syntenin loss - of - function on cell growth and proliferation , we tested whether cells were arrested in a particular phase of the cell cycle .
syntenin - depleted ( si syntenin ) and control ( si ctrl ) mcf7 cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 24 h. cells were then serum - stimulated for 24 h and analyzed for different cell cycle phases by flow cytometry .
syntenin - depleted cells showed a significant increase in g1 phase and a significant decrease in s and g2 / m phases when compared to control cells ( figure 5a ) .
the effects of serum - stimulation on the different phases of the cell cycle were also analyzed at different time points over a period of 2 days in two independent experiments ; see figure 5b for one illustration .
at early time points ( from 0 to 12 h ) , control and syntenin - depleted cells did not show drastic differences in g1 phase ( on average 73 % in controls and 71 % in depleted cells ) but the percentage of s phase in control cells was twice more important compared to syntenin - depleted cells ( on average 5.5 % in controls and 2.5 % in depleted cells ) .
starting from 18 h , s phase was increased to reach 19 % at 48 h in control cells , while in syntenin - depleted cells , s phase poorly increased over time to reach at maximum 6 % after 48h of serum stimulation .
moreover , the ratio of cells in g1 , s , and g2 / m stayed quite constant all along the experiment in syntenin depletion conditions on the contrary to what we observed in controls ( figure 5b ) .
taken together , these data suggest that syntenin depletion induces a defect in g1 / s cell cycle transition. of prime importance in this process is cyclin d2 , which binds and activates cyclin - dependent kinases 4 ( cdk4 ) , thereby phosphorylating retinoblastoma protein ( rb ) and promoting progression from mid to late g1 ( sherr , 1994 ) .
we therefore tested for the expression levels of these three cell cycle regulators of g1 / s transition by western blot and observed that they are all significantly downregulated in syntenin - depleted cells compared to control cells ( figures 5c,d ) .
altogether , our data indicate that syntenin might control cell growth by acting on g1 / s cell cycle transition .

discussion distinct assays and different cancer cell types ( melanoma , colon and breast ) from various origins ( mouse and human ) were used in this study to investigate the effects of syntenin knockdown .
all assays showed that syntenin depletion significantly decreases tumor cell migration , growth , and proliferation .
our results with the commonly used b16f10 cells corroborate previously reported studies with other mouse melanoma models showing that syntenin overexpression promotes melanoma invasion , motility and anchorage - independent growth ( boukerche et al. , 2005 ) .
additionally , our experiments in human colon ht29 cells , show that depletion of syntenin reduces cellular migration , growth and proliferation .
this is consistent with a study from lee et al .
( 2011 ) showing that syntenin gain of function stimulates the migration of ht29 cells , and other colon cancer cells in transwell assays , while syntenin knockdown by sirnas have the opposite effects ( lee et al. , 2011 ) .
although not directly tested in ht29 , the same study also illustrated a role for syndecan - 2 - syntenin interaction in the migratory potential of colon cancer cells , an observation directly in favor of our hypothesis that syntenin effects in cancer cells are primarily due to its effects on syndecan metabolism .
our results with the mcf7 breast cancer cells corroborate pioneer data from koo et al .
( 2002 ) and more recent data by yang et al .
( 2013 ) .
indeed , koo et al .
( 2002 ) identified syntenin by differential gene expression profile as a metastasis - related gene in breast cancer cells .
they showed that gain of syntenin expression in mcf7 cells stimulates their migration and invasion in transwell assays .
moreover they identified syntenin pdz2 domain , the syndecan high - affinity interacting domain of syntenin ( grootjans et al. , 1997 , 2000 ) , to be responsible for the migratory stimulating effect. by studying a larger panel of breast cancer cells , yang et al .
( 2013 ) found that syntenin expression levels correlate with the metastatic potential of these cells .
using the mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cell model , they revealed the impact of syntenin gain - and loss - of - function on the migratory and invasive behavior of these cells .
finally , using xenografts , they showed that syntenin overexpression promotes tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo ( yang et al. , 2013 ) .
consistent with the low migratory rate , the data presented here show that syntenin - depleted cells present a defect in the plasma membrane localization of active beta1 - integrin .
this observation is totally in line with previous data showing that , by allowing syndecan recycling , syntenin might support hs - dependent signaling molecules to be present and active at the plasma membrane ( zimmermann et al. , 2005 ) and that , integrin trafficking is required for cellular adhesion and migration ( humphries et al. , 2015 ) .
integrin related or not , we observed a decrease in the percentage of cells in the most proliferative s and g2 / m phases and a defect in the cell cycle g1 / s transition phase in syntenin - depleted cells .
we also documented that the growth regulatory molecules and g1 / s key regulators , cyclin d2 and cdk4 ( sherr , 1994 ) are downregulated upon syntenin inhibition .
alltogether , these observations are in line with a role for syntenin in tumor progression .
moreover , cyclin d1 and cdk4 downregulation through syntenin depletion was previously reported in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( oyesanya et al. , 2014 ) .
cyclins d are synthesized as long as growth factor stimulation persists .
their destruction , in response to growth factors deprivation for example , results in the failure of cells to enter s phase .
a potential explanation for the effects of syntenin depletion on cyclins d and cdk4 would be that syndecan associated growth factor receptor systems such as fgf - 2 - fgfr1 , are directed toward degradation instead of being recycled to the plasma membrane ( zimmermann et al. , 2005 ) .
in this manner , syntenin - depleted cells would be less able to respond to serum stimulation and thus less able to stimulate cyclins d synthesis and entry into the s phase .
yet , there is also a possible more direct explanation .
indeed , cyclin d1 and cyclin d2 present a class ii pdz - binding motif ( pdzbm ) at their c - terminal domain ( dvdi and didl , respectively ) .
a direct interaction between syntenin pdz domains and cyclins d pdzbm could also control g1 / s transition as syntenin has also been detected in the nucleus ( zimmermann et al. , 2001 ) .
in agreement with our results in mcf7 cells , a study from qian et al .
( 2013 ) showed that syntenin promotes mda - mb - 231 breast cancer cells g1 / s transition phase ( qian et al. , 2013 ) .
interestingly , the authors also propose that syntenin levels in breast cancer cells is inversely correlated to estrogen receptor levels and propose that syntenin maintains the growth of breast cancer cells when estrogen - signaling pathway is not available .
although we similarly observed the negative correlation between syntenin levels and estrogen - receptor status ( data not shown ) , this would not fit our hypothesis that syntenin effects in cancer are supported by its effect on syndecan trafficking .
more importantly , our results with estrogen receptor - positive mcf7 cells demonstrate that even low levels of syntenin are sufficient to modulate cancer cell behavior .
conclusion exploration of syntenin as a pharmacological target to inhibit cancer progression is probably a valuable objective with potential broad impact .

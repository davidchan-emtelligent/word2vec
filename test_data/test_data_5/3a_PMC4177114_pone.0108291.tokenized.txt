background in conventional approaches to plastid and mitochondrial genome sequencing , the sequencing steps are performed separately ; thus , plastid dna ( ptdna ) and mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) should be prepared independently .
however , it is difficult to extract pure ptdna and mtdna from plant tissue .
following the development of high - throughput sequencing technology , many researchers have attempted to obtain plastid genomes or mitochondrial genomes using high - throughput sequencing data from total dna .
unfortunately , the huge datasets generated consume massive computing and storage resources and cost a great deal , and even more importantly , excessive pollution reads affect the accuracy of the assembly .
therefore , it is necessary to develop an effective method that can generate base sequences from plant tissue and that is suitable for all plant species .
here , we describe a highly effective , low - cost method for obtaining plastid and mitochondrial genomes simultaneously .
results first , we obtained high - quality dna employing partial concentration extraction .
second , we evaluated the purity of the dna sample and determined the sequencing dataset size employing vector control quantitative analysis .
third , paired - end reads were obtained using a high - throughput sequencing platform .
fourth , we obtained scaffolds employing two - step assembly .
finally , we filled in gaps using specific methods and obtained complete plastid and mitochondrial genomes .
to ensure the accuracy of plastid and mitochondrial genomes , we validated the assembly using pcr and sanger sequencing .
using this method,we obtained complete plastid and mitochondrial genomes with lengths of 153,533 nt and 223,412 nt separately .
conclusion a simple method for extracting , evaluating , sequencing and assembling plastid and mitochondrial genomes was developed .
this method has many advantages : it is timesaving , inexpensive and reproducible and produces high - quality sequence .
furthermore , this method can produce plastid and mitochondrial genomes simultaneously and be used for other plant species .

introduction the majority of plant progenies inherit their plastid and mitochondrial dna from the maternal parent , and in recent decades , plastid and mitochondrial genomes have been used widely in studies on diversity and evolution .
moreover , plastids and mitochondria are important energy and metabolism organelles in plant cells .
many anabolic and catabolic processes occur in these two organelles , such as photosynthesis , respiration , and fatty acid synthesis .
thus , plastid and mitochondrial dna have recent particular attention in plant research , highlighting the need to obtain plastid and mitochondrial genomic sequences .
conventional approaches to generating plastid and mitochondrial genome sequences use separate processes .
thus , plastid dna ( ptdna ) and mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) are prepared independently .
typically , researchers purify ptdna and mtdna from green leaves and etiolated seedlings separately employing density - gradient ultracentrifugation ( cscl , sucrose , or percol ) [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
this demanding protocol is unsuitable for wide use for plant plastid and mitochondrial genome sequencing .
an additional method uses long - pcr to amplify ptdna or mtdna prior to sequencing .
in recent years , high - throughput sequencing platforms have been used to capture sequence data from many individual pcr amplifications that cover the entire plastid or mitochondrial genome [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
because this method requires a reference sequence , it can be used only for a few species ; moreover , it is time consuming .
thus , many researchers attempted to obtain plastid genomes or mitochondrial genomes using high - throughput sequencing data from total dna .
unfortunately , the huge datasets generated consume massive computing and storage resources and cost a great deal , and even more importantly , excessive false - positive reads affect the accuracy of the assembly .
here , we report a simple method that extracts , evaluates , sequences and assembles plastid and mitochondrial genomes simultaneously .
using this method , first , crude plastids and mitochondria were isolated together employing differential centrifugation .
subsequently , ptdna and mtdna were extracted from this crude preparation of plastids and mitochondria .
following their evaluation , eligible dna samples were used for high - throughput sequencing .
finally , the complete plastid and mitochondria genome sequences were obtained employing de novo assembly .
this method is economical and timesaving and can be used for all species .
materials and methods plant material brassica napus l. line dh366 , a fertile rapeseed line possessing polima cytoplasm , was used for this study .
rapeseed seeds were surface sterilized using 70 % ethanol for 2 min , treated with 10 % sodium hypochlorite for 15 min , and subsequently washed 4 - 5 times using sterile water .
the sterile seeds were inoculated in 150 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 1 / 2 ms media and incubated in the dark at 22degreesc and 70 % relative humidity .
four - week - old etiolated seedlings were collected for dna extraction .
dna extraction reagents and solutions homogenization medium : 0.4 m mannitol , 1 mm edta , 25 mm mops - koh , 10 mm tricine , 8 mm cysteine , 0.1 % bsa and 0.1 % pvp - 40 , ph 7.8 .
extraction medium : 50 mm tris - hcl , 10 mm edta , 2 % sarkosyl and 0.012 % proteinase k , ph 8.0 .
te : 10 mm tris - hcl and 1 mm edta , ph 8.0 .
protocols step one to five were conducted at 0degreesc , and all equipment , consumables and reagents were cooled to 0degreesc .
etiolated seedlings ( 5 g , fresh weight ) were chopped up using a pair of scissors in 50 ml of pre - cooled homogenization medium .
the chopped tissue was then transferred into a dounce tissue grinder and ground 80 times in an ice bath .
the homogenate was poured into a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g to remove nucleus and cell fragments .
the supernatant was transferred into a new 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 g to remove residual contamination .
the supernatant was transferred into a new 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 g to precipitate the plastids and mitochondria .
the supernatant was discarded , and the pellet was composed of crude plastids and mitochondria .
extraction medium ( 1.5 ml ) was added to the crude pellets and mixed using pipette tips , and the mixture was then transferred into two 2 ml centrifuge tubes .
the tubes were capped and the suspensions incubated at 37degreesc for 1 hour to disrupt the organelles .
the tubes were cooled at room temperature for 5 min , and 85 microl of 2 m sodium acetate solution was then added to each tube .
equilibrated phenol ( 850 microl ) was added to each tube , and the solutions mixed well and then centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 10 min .
the upper aqueous phase was transferred into new 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes , an equivalent volume of chloroform : isoamylalcohol ( 24:1 , v / v ) was added to each tube , and the solutions were mixed well and then centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 10 min .
the upper aqueous phase was transferred to new 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes , 2 - fold volume of 100 % ethanol was added , and the contents were mixed well and then incubated at - 20degreesc for 30 min to dissociate the dna .
the tube was centrifuged for 5 min at 13,200 rpm , and the supernatant was removed .
the precipitated dna was washed twice with 70 % ethanol .
the dna was dried at room temperature and re - dissolved in 50 microl te buffer .
dna evaluation in this study , a new method , vector control quantitative analysis ( vcqa ) , was used for dna evaluation .
first , three genes - rpob , ccmb and beta - actin - were cloned from the rapeseed plastid , mitochondrial and nuclear genomes separately .
second , three genes were joined into one fragment using overlap extension pcr .
third , the synthetic fragment was cloned into the pmd - 18 vector to obtain the control vector pmd18 - t - vcqa ( figure 1 ) .
fourth , the copy folds of rpob / beta - actin and ccmb / beta - actin were determined employing qpcr .
finally , we used rpob , ccmb and beta - actin to represent ptdna , mtdna and ncdna separately .
thus , the copy fold of organelle dna to ncdna in each dna sample could be computed using the following equation : 10.1371 / journal.pone.0108291.g001 figure 1 the control pmd18 - t - vcqa vector .
where e = efficiency of amplification and ct = number of cycles .
the detailed derivations of these equations are described in file s1 .
dna sequencing approximately 3 microg of purified dna was used to prepare sequence libraries .
a 500 bp dna library was prepared following the manufacturer 's instructions ( illumina sample preparation protocol for paired - end sequencing ) .
this dna library was sequenced over 100x2 cycles on an illumina hiseq2000 sequencing platform ( http :// www.illumina.com ) .
base calling was performed using illumina pipeline 1.8 ( illumina , san diego , ca , us ) .
we then discarded read pairs in which the reads contained adaptor sequences , more than 10 % unknown bases ( n ) or more than 50 % low - quality (< 5 ) bases .
all of this work was performed by novagene ( beijing , china ) .
de novo assembly in this study , assembly was conducted using the two - step assembly ( tsa ) method .
a detailed description of tsa follows .
during the first step , the plastid genome was assembled .
the detailed pipeline is shown below ( figure 2a ) .
1 ) de novo assembly : de novo assembly was performed using soapdenovo2 software [ 7 ] using high kmer size and kmer frequency to eliminate the effects of plastid reads and nuclear reads .
2 ) scaffold mapping : we mapped all the scaffolds to the reference plastid genome using blat software [ 8 ] .
the mapped scaffolds were filtered and used to construct the draft genome .
4 ) constructing the draft genome : all mapped scaffolds were ordered manually based on their position in the reference genome and were connected into a draft genome using overlapping information with gaps filled using n .
5 ) gap closure : we filled gaps with all the reads employing the gapcloser software in soapdenovo2 .
6 ) assembly validation : we validated the order of the scaffolds and accuracy of the sequence employing pcr amplification and sanger sequencing .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0108291.g002 figure 2 flowchart showing the major steps of de novo assembly employing tsa .
a ) first step : assembly of the plastid genome ; b ) second step : assembly of the mitochondrial genome .
for the second step , we conducted de novo assembly of the mitochondrial genome .
the detailed pipeline is shown below ( figure 2b ) .
1 ) filtering plastid reads : we mapped the total clean reads to the plastid genome obtained above using soap2 software ( http :// soap.genomics.org.cn / soapaligner.html ) with no mismatch .
only unmapped pair - end reads were used for the next step .
2 ) de novo assembly : the de novo assembly was performed using soapdenovo2 software .
3 ) scaffold mapping : we mapped all the scaffolds to the reference mitochondrial genome using blat software .
the mapped scaffolds were filtered and used to construct the draft genome .
4 ) constructing the draft genome : all the mapped scaffolds were ordered manually and connected into a draft genome based on their position in the reference genome using overlap information with gaps filled with n .
5 ) gap closure : because plastid reads were pre - removed prior to mitochondrial assembly , theoretically , any region similar to the plastid genome in a mitochondrial genome could create a gap .
to ensure accuracy , we filled gaps employing a strict method .
first , all reads were mapped to the draft genome .
then , paired - end reads , of which at least one end mapped to the draft genome exactly , were filtered .
finally , filtered reads were used to fill gaps employing gapcloser software .
read mapping , read filtering and gap filling continued until all gaps no longer extended .
the remaining gaps were filled in using pcr amplification and sanger sequencing .
6 ) assembly validation : we validated the order of the scaffolds and accuracy of the sequence employing pcr amplification and sanger sequencing .
gene annotation and variation analyses when we obtained the complete plastid genome and mitochondrial genome , genes were annotated using dogma ( http :// dogma.ccbb.utexas.edu /) [ 9 ] .
using their respective reference genomes , plastid and mitochondrial genomes were compared for variations using crossmatch in phrap ( http :// www.phrap.org /) .
all the variations were then annotated using snpeff software [ 10 ] .
results and discussion dna extraction using pce the conventional approach used to prepare ptdna or mtdna samples for sequencing is quite complex .
the method requires density gradient ultracentrifugation and large amounts of green leaves or etiolated seedlings [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
in recent years , alternative methods have been developed , such as differential centrifugation combining dnase i digestion [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 11 ] - [ 19 ] , long - pcr [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , multiply - primed rolling circle amplification ( rca ) [ 20 ] and a probe enrichment strategy [ 21 ] .
all of these methods have deficiencies , such as their complexity , instability or lack of suitability for wide use .
most importantly , no method can extract ptdna and mtdna together except when total dna is used .
in this study , we developed a method that can enrich ptdna and mtdna simultaneously .
because the method can only increase the proportion of ptdna and mtdna in a dna sample , we named it partial concentration extraction ( pce ) .
using pce , first , crude plastids and mitochondria were isolated employing differential centrifugation from etiolated seedlings .
then , ptdna and mtdna were extracted using phenol - chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation .
the ptdna and mtdna were enriched in the resulting dna .
the details of the dna extraction are described in the materials and methods .
finally , a total of 7.17 microg dna was obtained from 5 g of etiolated seedlings .
the results in table 1 show the dna quality examined using a nanodrop 1000 .
the quality of the dna was further tested using electrophoresis of the dna on a 1 % agarose gel .
as shown in figure 3 , no degradation of the dna fragment extracted using pce was observed .
all the results indicate that we obtained a high - quality dna sample suitable for sequencing .

compared with the relatively simple method using differential centrifugation [ 17 ] , this method saves time and requires less tissue ( table 2 ) .
however , to obtain sufficient and intact plastids and mitochondria , an essential precondition is the use of a dounce tissue grinder and suitable homogenization medium .
the etiolated seedlings can decrease the friction drag and facilitate tissue grinding .
the simplicity of this method provides it with a higher success rate than others methods .
moreover , this method can be widely used in most laboratories and all plant species .
more importantly , when combined with our assembly method , this method easily obtains plastid and mitochondrial genomes simultaneously at little cost .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0108291.t002 table 2 comparison between partial concentration extraction and differential centrifugation .
method partial concentration extraction differential centrifugation [ 17 ] ptdna mtdna tissue type etiolated seedlings leaves total tissue 5 g 5 g 10 - 15 g total time ~ 4 h > 4 h ~ 2.5 h purity evaluation using vcqa many studies indicate that sequence homology exists between the plastid , mitochondrial and nuclear genome .
thus , when de novo assembly is performed , the plastid genome should influence the mitochondrial genome and vice versa , and both the plastid and mitochondrial genomes should be affected by the nuclear genome .
in the past , many studies used pcr or restriction digestion to perform qualitative analysis of ncdna in pure ptdna and mtdna preparations ; however , no method can perform quantitative analysis [ 12 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
vcqa , a method based on qpcr , can perform quantitative analysis of dna types in a dna sample .
for this method , we used a control vector , in which three genes - rpob , ccmb and beta - actin - belong to plastid , mitochondrial and nuclear genomes , respectively , and represent ptdna , mtdna and ncdna separately .
thus , the copy folds of ptdna / ncdna and mtdna / ncdna in the dna sample can be easily identified employing quantitative analysis of the three genes .
we evaluated the purity of the dna sample using vcqa and predicted the sequencing data size for a given sequencing depth .
the detailed results are listed in table 3 .
in our dna sample , the copy fold of mtdna / ncdna is 72 , whereas the copy fold of ptdna / ncdna is , astonishingly , 1922 .
thus , when the sequencing data cover the entire genome ( approximately 1.2 gb ) one layer , the mitochondrial genome is 72 layers and the plastid genome is 1922 layers .
in theory , an ideal de novo assembly can be obtained when the sequencing depth is greater than 50 layers .
thus , if the sequencing dataset size reaches 1.2 gb , it is sufficient for de novo assembly of mitochondrial and plastid genomes in our dna sample .
these data suggest that our method produces high - purity dna samples for sequencing plastid mitochondrial genomes .

because the method can be used for quantitative analysis , it can be used to compare the dna of plastids and mitochondria from different materials when performing correlation analyses of ptdna / mtdna content and phenotypes .
genome sequencing and sequencing depth statistics in this study , a whole - genome shotgun strategy and hiseq2000 sequencing platform were employed .
paired - end sequencing libraries with insert sizes of approximately 500 bp were constructed using 3 microg dna samples .
sequencing reads containing adaptor sequences were cleaned , and the sequence data were filtered for low - quality reads .
this process resulted in a total of 5,778,987 high - quality paired - end reads containing 1,155,797,400 bases with an average read size of 100 nt. to obtain satisfactory assemblies , we computed the accurate sequencing depths of the mitochondrial and plastid genomes using the mitochondrial genome ( accession number fr715249 ) of 2h2a and the plastid genome ( accession number gq861354 ) of zy036 as references .
first , we mapped the high - quality reads to the reference genome .
then we computed the sequencing depths of target genes ( rpob and ccmb ) and unique regions excluding similar regions of plastid and mitochondrial genomes .
the detailed results are listed in table 4 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0108291.t004 table 4 summary of sequence alignments and sequencing depths .

the sequencing depths of unique regions of the plastid and mitochondrial genomes are similar to the sequencing depths obtained for rpob and ccmb separately , with differences of less than 10 % observed .
the sequencing data were nearly 1.2 gb and covered the nuclear genome to approximately one layer .
thus , the sequencing depth of the plastid and mitochondrial genomes can be expected to be equivalent to the copy folds of ptdna / ncdna and mtdna / ncdna separately .
indeed , the sequencing depths of unique regions and target genes ( rpob and ccmb ) are consistent with the copy folds , suggesting that this method of dna evaluation is highly reliable .
we compared the sequencing depth of our dna sequencing data and total dna sequencing data .
one sample was part of the whole genome sequencing data of total rapeseed dna ( unpublished ) .
the additional two samples were from previous studies [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
when the nuclear genome was covered one layer , the sequencing depth of the plastid genome in our sample was 15 - 35 - fold that of the three total dna samples , and the sequencing depth of the mitochondrial genome in our sample was approximately 4 - 9 - fold that of the three total dna samples ( table 5 ) .
these data suggest that our dna extraction method yielded a highly pure dna sample for sequencing the plastid and mitochondrial genomes .

in some cases , plastid reads were initially separated from total reads employing the published plastid genomes [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] and then used for de novo assembly of plastid genomes .
however , the sequence differences between different materials , in particular , the large insertions and deletions , affect the efficiency of the assembly and lead to more gaps .
when assembling mitochondrial genomes , plastid reads were removed from total reads employing the existing plastid genomes [ 23 ] .
sequence differences in plastid genomes between different materials prevent the removal of partial plastid reads and lead to false assembly .
in some studies [ 26 ] , the contigs were filtered employing the different sequencing depths of plastids , mitochondria and nucleus .
however , this approach cannot avoid false de novo assembly of contigs .
to avoid false assembly , we developed a new assembly method , tsa , that is used with the pce dna extraction method in combination .
in our sequencing data , the sequencing depth of the nuclear genome is approximately one layer , which is far lower than the sequencing depths of plastid and mitochondrial genomes .
thus , the effect of nuclear reads can be ignored when performing de novo assembly of plastid and mitochondrial genomes .
despite the sequencing depth of the mitochondrial genome reaching almost 100 layers , it remains very low when compared with the 2000 layers obtained for the plastid genome .
thus , we can easily eliminate the effects of mitochondrial reads by employing the large kmer and kmer frequency when performing de novo assembly of the plastid genome .
based on the depth evaluated above , de novo assembly was performed using a series of different parameters .
finally , we obtained an optimal result .
only six scaffolds (> 1 kb ) were assembled , and three scaffolds were aligned to the reference plastid genome ( accession number gq861354 ; table 6 ) .
three aligned scaffolds were then ordered manually and connected into a draft sequence based on positions in the reference genome using overlap information with gaps filled with n. to obtain the finished sequence , all the reads was used to fill gaps employing gapcloser .
finally , we obtained a complete plastid genome with a length of 153,533 nt ( table 6 ) including a pair of inverted repeats ( irs ) of 26,186 nt separated by one small and one large single - copy region ( ssc and lsc ) of 17,780 and 83,381 nt , respectively .

the mitochondrial genome assembly was more complicated than that of the plastid genome .
the sequencing depth of the plastid genome was far greater than for the mitochondrial genome , and we cannot eliminate effects of plastid reads employing sequencing depth .
to reduce the effects of the plastid reads , we must remove the plastid reads from the total reads .
we used the plastid genome obtained above as a reference to avoid sequence differences between the different materials .
when at least one end mapped exactly to the plastid genome , we considered the paired - end read as a plastid read and removed it. finally , 4,165,859 paired - end reads , accounting for 72 % of the total reads , remained and were used for the de novo assembly of the mitochondrial genome .
after several attempts , we assembled the filtered reads using the following optimal parameters : kmer size 41 , kmer frequency 20 and edge coverage 20 .
finally , 44 scaffolds greater than 1 kb were obtained and mapped to the reference mitochondrial genome ( accession number fr715249 ) , resulting in four mapped scaffolds ( table 6 ) .
the mapped scaffolds were ordered manually and connected into a draft genome based on their positions in the reference genome using overlap information with gaps filled with n. to ensure the accuracy of the sequence , we filled gaps employing a rigorous method .
in the first cycle , we mapped the total reads to the draft genome , and 496,252 paired - end reads with at least one end were mapped and filtered .
the filtered reads were used to fill gaps , and one gap was filled .
during the second cycle , we mapped the total reads to the sequence obtained after the first cycle .
consequently , 594,260 paired - end reads were mapped and were used to fill the remaining gaps .
after two cycles of read mapping , read filtering and gap filling , all gaps were filled .
ultimately , we obtained the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of 223,412 nt in length ( table 6 ) .
we used pcr and sanger sequencing to confirm the sequence accuracy of this novel method , which has been used for the first time to assemble plastid and mitochondrial genomes .
we designed ten pairs of primers to amplify the sequence fragment , which contained several junction regions of two scaffolds ( table 7 ) .
following pcr , we identified the sequence of the twelve pcr products using sanger sequencing .
the sequences obtained were compared with the complete genome .
no false results were obtained in ten regions adding up to 8,071 bp ( table 7 ) .
these data indicate the high quality of the de novo assembly and the high accuracy of the order of scaffolds and gap filling .

a mnp : multiple nucleotide polymorphisms ; b cv : complex variations .
for the first time , we report on the mitochondrial genome of a fertile rapeseed line that possesses a polima cytoplasm .
we compared it with the mitochondrial genome of a polima cytoplasmic male - sterile line shaan 2a [ 14 ] .
surprisingly , the mitochondrial genome of dh366 exhibited the same length as shaan 2a .
only four snps were noted , of which only two were located in coding regions of two genes and only one snp changed the amino acid sequence of orf257 ( table 8 ). with respect to the exiguous variations , the mitochondrial genome of dh366 possesses the same gene number as shaan 2a , including 34 protein encoding genes , three ribosomal rna genes , 18 transfer rna genes and 40 putative open reading frames ( orfs ) .
similar to the plastid genome , enormous variations were observed in the mitochondrial genome when the nap cytoplasm and polima cytoplasm were compared [ 14 ] .
the numerous genome variations suggest different origins of the nap cytoplasm and polima cytoplasm .
surprisingly , only four snps were noted when comparing the mitochondrial genomes of dh366 and shaan 2a .
this high congruency indicates the high quality of the mitochondrial genome obtained .
for the far great sequencing depth of the plastid genome than the mitochondrial genome , we believe the plastid genome sequence have a high quality too .
conclusion in this study , we developed a method to obtain plastid and mitochondrial genomes from plant tissue .
this method comprises dna extraction , dna evaluation , dna sequencing and de novo assembly .
this method has many advantages , such as simple management , high efficiency , low cost , high accuracy and general applicability ; however , the most important benefit is that plastid and mitochondrial genomes can be obtained simultaneously .
using this method , we obtained a high yield of high - quality cytoplasmic dna , and the method provides reliable purity .
the dna can be used for sequencing on high - throughput sequencing platforms .
finally , the sequencing data can be assembled into complete plastid and mitochondrial genomes .
indeed , we obtained complete plastid and mitochondrial genomes from two additional rapeseed cultivars employing this method ( unpublished data ) .
for the simply procedure , we believe this method will promote research on plant cytoplasmic genome and related investigations .

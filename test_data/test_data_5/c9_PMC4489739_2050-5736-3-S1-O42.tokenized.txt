4th international symposiumwashington , d.c , usa background / introduction thermal therapy has tremendous potential to augment the benefits of immunotherapy .
the ability of heat to stimulate both general and tumor specific responses , in part through heat shock protein mediated mechanisms has been known for over two decades .
significant challenges persist however in translating these effects into predictable and meaningful clinical responses .
more recently the association of radiation with immune stimulation and in some cases specific anti - tumor immune response has been defined .
methods coupled with the introduction of new immunotherapuetics including check point inhibitors which have demonstrated clinical survival benefit , the combination of heat , radiation , and immunotherapy to combat cancer is a timely area for investigation .
the potential of focused ultrasound to augment immunotherapy including targeted heat and drug delivery will be discussed including the opportunity to enhance immune effects arising from the heated but non - ablated rim present with tumor ablation .

background in adults , impaired myocardial repolarization and increased risk of arrhythmia are known consequences of open heart surgery .
little is known , however , about post - operative consequences of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in children .
the aim of this study was to assess ventricular repolarization and coronary perfusion after bypass surgery for atrial septal defect ( asd ) repair in children .
methods twelve patients with asd were assessed one day before and 5 - 6 days after asd repair .
myocardial repolarization ( corrected qt interval , qtc , qt dispersion , qtd , and pq interval ) was determined on 12 - lead electrocardiograms .
coronary flow in proximal left anterior descending artery ( peak flow velocity in diastole , pfvd ) was assessed by transthoracic doppler echocardiography .
results ten of the 12 ( 83 %) children had normal myocardial repolarization before and after surgery .
after surgery , qtc increased 1 - 9 % in 5 ( 42 %) patients , decreased 2 - 11 % in 5 ( 42 %) patients and did not change in 2 ( 16 %) patients .
post - op qtc positively correlated with bypass time ( r = 0.686 , p = 0.014 ) and changes in pfvd ( r = 0.741 , p = 0.006 ) .
after surgery , qtd increased 33 - 67 % in 4 ( 33 %) patients , decreased 25 - 50 % in 6 patients ( 50 %) and did not change in 2 ( 16 %) patients .
after surgery , pq interval increased 5 - 30 % in 4 ( 33 %) patients , decreased 4 - 29 % in 6 ( 50 %) patients and did not change in 1 ( 8 %) patient .
post - op pq positively correlated with bypass time ( r = 0.636 , p = 0.027 ) .
as previously reported , pfvd significantly increased after surgery ( p < 0.001 ) .
conclusions changes in qtc , pq and pfvd are common in young children undergoing surgery for asd repair .
post - op qtc significantly correlates with bypass time , suggesting prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass may impair ventricular repolarization .
post - op qtc significantly correlates with pfvd changes , suggesting increased coronary flow may also impair ventricular repolarization .
the clinical significance and reversibility of these alternations require further investigations .
ecg asd repolarization heart surgery background cardiopulmonary bypass remains the main approach to surgical repair of most congenital heart diseases .
little , however , is known about potential hemodynamic and electrophysiological consequences of this procedure , especially in young children .
myocardial function and output are usually impaired in congenital heart disease , but may become more so after surgery .
coronary flow increases after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery [ 1,2 ] .
in adults , impaired myocardial repolarization and increased risk of arrhythmia are well known consequences of open heart surgery [ 3 ] .
early postoperative arrhythmia occurs in about 14 % children [ 4 ] .
qtd ( the difference between maximal and minimal qt intervals on a standard ecg ) is a risk factor for post - operative ventricular arrhythmia in patients with tetralogy of fallot [ 5,6 ] .
qtc and qtd increase in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction [ 7 ] .
prolonged qrs duration , on the other hand , may result from right or left ventricular dilatation , predicting malignant ventricular arrhythmias [ 8 ] .
pq interval increases in diastolic dysfunction , independent of the severity or cause .
moreover , p wave dispersion correlates with left ventricular ejection fraction and is significantly higher in dilated cardiomyopathy and mitral stenosis [ 9 ]. of note , the pattern of ventricular repolarization in male and female infants and children is the same [ 10,11 ] .
we recently reported that cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in children leads to increased coronary flow in the first week of surgery [ 1 ] .
profound adverse effects ( e.g. , atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmia ) on myocardial repolarization in the same period are also reported in adults [ 12 ] .
the primary aim of this study was to compare myocardial repolarization ( qtc , qtd , and pq intervals ) and coronary flow ( pfvd ) measurements before and within the first week after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for asd repair in children .
the secondary aim was to correlate the ecg and pfvd changes with bypass and aortic cross - clamp times .
methods study population twelve children who had open heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass for asd repair were included in this study .
the mean age was 3.5 +/ - 1.9 years ( range , 1 - 7 ) .
the study was approved by the ethics committee for human research at the lund university .
written consent was obtained from the guardians / parents of patients enrolled in the study .
the study protocol conformed to the principles outlined in the declaration of helsinki [ 13 ] .
the exclusion criteria were clinical signs of an infectious illness , c - reactive protein > 0.8 mg / l before surgery , heart failure , and preoperative therapy with vasoactive drugs .
the cardio pulmonary bypass surgeries were performed under a body temperature of 28 - 32degreesc ; cold (+ 4degreesc ) hyperkalemic blood cardioplegic solution was used .
all patients had the same protocol for cardioplegia and anterograde perfusion of the coronary arteries with retrograde filling through the coronary sinus every 20 min .
the post - operative intensive care stay was uneventful with no observed arrhythmias .
patients were not taking beta - blockers , angiotensin 1 - converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin 1 - converting enzyme receptor blockers , lanoxine , phenylepherine or other vasoactive drugs ( including nitrate or dopamine ) .
patients received intravenous ketobemidone hydrochloride for pain during the first 2 - 3 days .
oral oxicodon , with a half - life of 4.5 hours , was then given on postoperative days 3 and 4 .
these medications were stopped at least one day before postoperative evaluations ( echocardiography and ecg ) on day 5 or 6 , which were performed when patients were ready for discharge .
ecg measurements surface ( 12 - lead ) electrocardiograms ( ecg machine - ge marquette , 12 lead ecg system ) were done one day before and 5 or 6 days after surgery .
pq interval and indexes of myocardial repolarization ( qtc and qtd ) were measured by one investigator .
qt was measured manually in leads ii , v4 , and v5 .
qtc was calculated using the bazett 's formula [ 14 ] .
three consecutive ecg cycles ( whenever possible ) in each of the three leads were measured and the mean interval was used .
the precedent rr interval to the measured qt was used to calculate the heart rate for qtc interval in milliseconds ( ms ) .
qtd was set as the difference between the maximum and minimum qtc , using lead v1 [ 5 ] .
transthoracic doppler echocardiography echocardiographic examinations were made with sequoia ( tm ) c512 ( acuson mountain view , ca , usa ) machine with pulsed wave doppler frequency of 7 / 10 mhz .
standard m - and b - modes and 2d transthoracic doppler echocardiography ( ttde ) for cardiac output , left ventricular function and left anterior descending ( lad ) coronary artery flow measurements were done one day before and 5 or 6 days after surgery .
the diameter of the aortic ring was measured in a long axis view by m - mode in accordance to the recommendations of the american society of echocardiography [ 15 ] .
left ventricular fractional shortening was computed according to the standard formula [ 16 ] .
the flow velocity measurements across aortic valve were averaged over three consequent cardiac cycles .
adjustments in the ultrasound machine for measuring diastolic peak flow velocity ( pfvd ) in the lad coronary artery were as previously described [ 1 ] .
statistics the data were expressed as mean and standard deviation (+/ - sd ) .
analyses ( standard crosstabs , pearson correlation coefficients , and linear regression ) were performed using spss version 20.0 ( spss incorporated , chicago , illinois ) .
p - values < 0.05 were considered significant .
normality of pfvd , qtc , qtd and pq changes was confirmed by the shapiro - wilk test .
thus , the paired t - test was used to compare pre - and post - operative changes in the measured parameters .
adequacy of the sample size ( n = 12 ) for detecting true changes , if any , between the pre - and post - operative values of pfvd , qtc , qtd and pq by paired t - test was assessed .
for this purpose , true standard deviations of differences were assumed to be close to the observed standard deviations .
smallest mean differences ( pre - vs. post - operative ) for detecting with a power of 90 % and 5 % significance were computed .
the smallest mean difference for pfvd was 13.28 cm.s - 1 ( assumed standard deviation = 13.0 cm.s - 1 ) , for qtc was 20.59 ms ( assumed standard deviation = 20.0 ms ) , qtd 15.44 ms ( assumed standard deviation = 15.0 ms ) , and for pq was 25.74 ms ( assumed standard deviation = 25.0 ms ) .
results all children , except patients 11 and 12 , had normal myocardial repolarization ( qtc and qtd intervals ) before and after surgery .
patient 11 had the longest aortic cross - clamp duration ( 67 min ) , bypass time ( 106 min ) , pre - operative pq interval ( 200 ms ) and pre - operative qtc ( 444 ms ) ; pq and qtc decreased after surgery by 6 % and 3 % , respectively ( table 1 ) .

discussion the study describes early changes in ventricular repolarization ( qtc , qtd ) , pq interval and coronary flow ( pfvd ) shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass for asd repair in children .
this surgical procedure was associated with significant changes in these parameters in most patients .
some changes were partially related to the bypass and aortic cross - clamp times ( figure 1 ) .
thus , prolonged intra - operative procedure may have an adverse impact on myocardial repolarization , imposing some risk of arrhythmia after surgery .
this possibility needs further investigation , especially with extended time following surgery .
the cross clamp duration shown here is comparable with that reported for asd repair ( 35 +/ - 17 vs. 24 +/ - 16 min ) [ 17 ] .
three of our 12 patients had associated congenital heart defects , such as partial anomalous pulmonary venous return .
for these children , the cardiopulmonary bypass time was > 100 min .
otherwise , the bypass time for the remaining 8 children was 61 +/ - 12 min , which is comparable with published report ( 42 +/ - 16 min ) [ 17 ] .
asd causes right atrial dilatation and right ventricular volume overload .
these alterations along with incision made through the right atrium and bypass time during surgery likely impact the myocardial repolarization .
the overall effects are variable and their clinical significance remains uncertain .
further studies are needed to address reversibility and significance of these changes .
impaired myocardial repolarization ( and its associated risk of arrhythmia ) in the immediate post - operative period perhaps could be deduced from the significant correlations between duration of bypass and post - op qtc or pq intervals ( figure 1 ) .
a recent study of various congenital heart diseases showed persistently prolonged qtc > 3 days after surgery in about one - third of the patients [ 18 ] .
a transient prolongation of qtc is also reported in adults during myocardial infarction and balloon coronary angioplasty [ 19,20 ] .
the post - operative increase of coronary artery flow could have a mechanistic link to ventricular repolarization , accounting ( at least partially ) for the significant correlation between pfvd changes and post - op qtc ( figure 1b ) .
this finding is in line with the animal study by zhang et al. , where increased coronary flow was associated with prolonged duration of transmural ventricular repolarization [ 21 ] .
the underlying mechanism of flow - induced lengthening of ventricular repolarization is unclear , but synthesis and release of nitric oxide from the coronary endothelium may play a role [ 22 ] .
the right ventricular volume and pressure are increased in asd , raising the demand for oxygen .
the coronary flow , thus , is expected to increase in these patients .
these findings become more prominent after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery [ 23 ] .
patients with limited coronary flow reserve ( e.g. , prolonged aortic cross - clamping duration and enhanced microcirculatory changes ) , however , may fail to execute adequate oxygen supply to the myocardium .
such patients may have complicated post - op course , particularly with sepsis .
therefore , assessing coronary flow is important in critically - ill children .
conclusions changes in myocardial repolarization ( qtc ) , pq interval and coronary perfusion ( pfvd ) are common in young children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for asd repair .
post - op qtc significantly correlates with bypass time , suggesting prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass may impair ventricular repolarization .
post - op qtc also significantly correlates with pfvd changes , suggesting the post - op increase in coronary flow may impair ventricular repolarization .
the clinical significance and reversibility of these alternations require further investigations .
limitations of the study the study was conducted in a small cohort .
to avoid stress on child and parents , the coronary flow reserve was not done .

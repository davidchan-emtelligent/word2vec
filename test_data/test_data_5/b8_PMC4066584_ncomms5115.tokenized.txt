the nitrogen regulation stress response is an adaptive mechanism used by nitrogen - starved escherichia coli to scavenge for alternative nitrogen sources and requires the global transcriptional regulator ntrc .
in addition , nitrogen - starved e. coli cells synthesize a signal molecule , guanosine tetraphosphate ( ppgpp ) , which serves as an effector molecule of many processes including transcription to initiate global physiological changes , collectively termed the stringent response .
the regulatory mechanisms leading to elevated ppgpp levels during nutritional stresses remain elusive .
here , we show that transcription of rela , a key gene responsible for the synthesis of ppgpp , is activated by ntrc during nitrogen starvation .
the results reveal that ntrc couples these two major bacterial stress responses to manage conditions of nitrogen limitation , and provide novel mechanistic insights into how a specific nutritional stress leads to elevating ppgpp levels in bacteria .
the nitrogen regulation stress response and the stringent response are two major regulatory pathways in bacteria , but their mutual coordination is unclear .
here , the authors show that ntrc , the main regulatory protein from the first pathway , activates expression of rela , a key gene from the second pathway .
nitrogen ( n ) is an essential element of most macromolecules in a bacterial cell , including proteins , nucleic acids and cell wall components .
bacteria can assimilate a variety of n sources and ammonia typically supports the fastest growth , serving as the preferred n source for many bacteria including e. coli1 .
during n - limited growth ammonia is converted by glutamine synthetase into glutamine , the primary amine donor for key amino acid and nucleotide biosynthetic pathways. e. coli cells respond to n starvation by activating the nitrogen regulation ( ntr ) stress response , resulting in the expression of ~ 100 genes to facilitate n scavenging from alternative sources of combined n ( ref. 2 ) .
in enterobacteria , the master transcription regulator of the ntr stress response is ntrc of the ntrbc two - component system3 .
n limitation results in the phosphorylation of the response regulator ntrc ( product of glng ) by its cognate sensor kinase ntrb ( product of glnl ) .
n - starved e. coli cells rapidly synthesize ppgpp , the effector alarmone of the bacterial stringent response4 .
two enzymes modulate the levels of ppgpp in e. coli : the ppgpp synthetase rela and ppgpp synthetase / hydrolase spot5 .
rela and spot contribute to stress adaptation , antibiotic tolerance , expression of virulence traits and the acquisition of persistent phenotype in pathogenic bacteria6789 .
the regulation of rela / spot enzyme activities has been extensively studied10111213 , but the regulatory mechanisms that govern transcription of their genes and thereby lead to elevated ppgpp levels during nutritional stresses remain elusive .
here , we address the links between the ntr stress response and the ppgpp alarmone .
to gain insight into ntrc - dependent gene networks , we map the genome - wide binding targets of ntrc and rna polymerase ( rnap ) during n starvation in e. coli , using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high - throughput sequencing ( chip - seq ) .
our results reveal that nitrogen stress response and stringent response are coupled in e. coli .
results tooling up to study genome - wide binding of ntrc and rnap to identify genome regions preferentially associated with ntrc , we introduced an in - frame fusion encoding three repeats of the flag epitope at the 3 ' end of glng in e. coli strain ncm3722 , a prototrophic e. coli k - 12 strain .
to establish n - starved conditions , we grew batch cultures of the wild - type ncm3722 strain in gutnick minimal medium supplemented with a limiting amount ( 3 mm ) of nh4cl as the sole n source and monitored bacterial growth as a function of ammonium consumption .
in fig. 1a , the time when wild - type ncm3722 stops growing ( t = nro ) coincides with the ammonium run out ([ ammonium ]< 0.000625 , mm ) in the growth medium .
to establish that the flag epitope had not compromised the activity of ntrc , we measured the doubling times of wild - type ncm3722 , ncm3722 : glng - flag and ncm3722 : deltaglng strains under our growth conditions .
the doubling time of the ncm3722 : glng - flag strain is close to that of the wild - type ncm3722 strain ; however , as expected , the doubling time of the ncm3722 : deltaglng strain is longer than that of the wild - type ncm3722 strain ( fig. 1b ) .
further , the expression levels of glnk mrna , an ntr stress response gene directly activated by ntrc , at t = n - ( that is , the time - point 20 min after n runs out ) are similar in the wild - type ncm3722 and ncm3722 : glng - flag strains , and as expected is not readily detected in the ncm3722 : deltaglng strain ( fig. 1c ) .
complementation of the ncm3722 : deltaglng strain with inducible plasmid - borne glng restored both the doubling time and glnk mrna expression ( fig. 1b,c ) .
in summary , we conclude that ( i ) flag - tag has not adversely affected biological activity of ntrc and ( ii ) under our experimental conditions t = n - is representative of the time when the e. coli cells are starved for n. ntrc binds upstream of rela in n - starved e. coli to identify the genomic loci bound by ntrc in e. coli during n starvation , we sampled cells for chip - seq analysis at t = n - and ntrc - bound dna was precipitated with anti - flag antibodies .
to identify transcriptionally active promoters in e. coli during n starvation , we treated the e. coli cells at t = n - with rifampicin for 15 min ( rifampicin inhibits transcription elongation and thus transcription - initiated rnap molecules will become trapped at any functional promoter1415 ) and rnap bound dna was precipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the beta - subunit of the rnap .
the chip - seq data revealed that ntrc bound upstream of at least 21 transcription units at t = n - . rnap binding ( in the presence and absence of rif treatment ) to promoter regions of all 21 transcription units and differential gene expression analysis ( t = n - versus t = n +) indicate that all 21 transcription units are upregulated at t = n - ( table 1 , supplementary figs 1 - 3 ) .
fourteen of the 21 transcription units are known members of the ntrc regulon ( table 1 ) 2 .
however , none of the seven remaining transcription units ( flgmn , dicc , flic , rela , ssrs , soxr and yjcz - prop ) have been previously demonstrated to require ntrc for their transcriptional regulation .
therefore , we tested ntrc binding to these regions by electrophoretic mobility shift assays ( emsa ) with purified e. coli ntrc and dna probe sequences ( designed following chip - seq analysis ) upstream of flgmn , dicc , flic , rela , ssrs , soxr and yjcz - prop ( referred to as flgn , dicc , flic , rela , ssrs , soxr and yjcz probes ) .
as a positive control , the region upstream of the glnalg the operon ( referred to as the glna probe ) was used .
the in situ phosphorylated ntrc ( ntrc - p ) bound to the rela and positive control glna probes ( fig. 2a ) but not the other probes ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
chip - seq data indicate that the ntrc binding site is located between positions - 838 and - 649 upstream from the translational start of rela .
since complex formation between ntrc - p and flgn , dicc , flic , ssrs , soxr and yjcz probes is not detectable even at a higher concentration of ntrc - p ( supplementary fig. 2 ) and the dna regions are poorly enriched by ntrc binding in the chip - seq data ( table 1 ) , we consider that flgn , dicc , flic , ssrs , soxr and yjcz are unlikely to be solely dependent on ntrc .
we do not exclude the possibility that the upstream regions of flgn , dicc , flic , ssrs , soxr and yjcz transcription units contain intrinsically poor ntrc binding sites , which function in co - dependence with other transcription factors ( supplementary fig. 2 ) .
ntrc activates rela transcription in n - starved e. coli to unambiguously establish that rela transcription is activated by ntrc during n starvation , we measured rela mrna levels in wild - type ncm3722 and ncm3722 : deltaglng strains at t = n - relative to t = n + .
in the wild - type ncm3722 strain , the level of rela mrna expression is ~ 2.2 +/ - 0.4 - fold at t = n - relative to t = n + , and no detectable increase in the rela mrna expression is seen in the ncm3722 : deltaglng at t = n - relative to t = n + ( fig. 2b ) .
the complementation of the ncm3722 : deltaglng strain with inducible plasmid - borne glng restored rela mrna expression in the ncm3722 : deltaglng : glngind strain to levels comparable to that of the wild - type ncm3722 strain in the presence of the inducer isopropyl beta - d - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( iptg ) ( fig. 2b ) .
to determine whether synthesis of the rela protein correlates with ntrc - dependent activation of rela transcription , we probed whole - cell extracts of the wild - type ncm3722 , ncm3722 : deltaglng and ncm3722 : deltaglng : : glngind strains sampled at t = n - with a monoclonal antibody to e. coli rela .
as expected , rela protein was not detected in whole - cell extract prepared from the ncm3722 : deltaglng strain and ncm3722 : deltaglng : : glngind strain in the absence of iptg ( fig. 2c , lanes 3 and 4 ) ; however , rela protein was detected in whole - cell extracts prepared from the ncm3722 : deltaglng : : glngind strain in the presence of iptg ( fig. 2c , lane 5 ) .
these results support our chip - seq data and demonstrate that accumulation of rela in e. coli is ntrc dependent during n starvation .
further the growth of ncm3722 : deltaglng and ncm3722 : deltarela strains under n - limiting conditions is similar ( fig. 2d ) , thus indicating that ntrc - dependent activation of rela is important for the tolerance of n stress .
a novel sigma54 - dependent promoter drives transcription of rela ntrc exclusively activates transcription from promoters used by rnap containing the major variant bacterial sigma factor , sigma54 ( ref. 16 ) .
at such promoters , hexamers of phosphorylated ntrc bind to enhancer - like sequences located ~ 100 - 150 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site and in a reaction hydrolysing adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) , convert a transcriptionally inactive initial sigma54 - rnap - promoter complex to a transcriptionally active one17 .
a previous study revealed that two promoters , p1 and p2 , which are utilized by the housekeeping sigma70 - rnap , drive the transcription of rela18 .
the p1 promoter is constitutively active , but , on entry into stationary phase , rela transcription is driven by p2 and it is thought that transcription from p2 is influenced by the global transcriptional regulator camp receptor protein ( crp ) .
to identify sigma54 - rnap - dependent promoter ( s ) responsible for driving ntrc - dependent transcription of rela , we carried out 5 ' - race analysis of rela mrna isolated from n - starved wild - type ncm3722 and ncm3722 : deltaglng e. coli cells and mapped the transcription start sites ( tss ) .
results shown in supplementary fig. 4a indicate that ( i ) in n - starved e. coli , rela is transcribed from three different promoters , the constitutive sigma70 - rnap - dependent p1 promoter and two new promoters , which we refer to as p3 and p4 and ( ii ) transcription from p3 and p4 is dependent on ntrc .
transcription from the sigma70 - rnap dependent p2 promoter was only detected in the ncm3722 : deltaglng cells , indicating that sigma54 - rnap binding to the p4 promoter ( which is located immediately adjacent to the p2 promoter and overlaps the crp binding site ; supplementary fig. 4b ) is likely to antagonize efficient transcription initiation from p2 under n starvation ( supplementary fig. 4a ) .
inspection of the dna region immediately upstream of the tss of the p3 and p4 transcripts revealed two conserved sequences typical of a sigma54 - rnap - dependent promoter19 ( supplementary fig. 4b ) .
since the chip - seq data indicate that the dna region from - 811 to - 607 ( with respect to the translation start site of rela ) is enriched for rnap binding and spans the p4 promoter ( fig. 2a and supplementary fig. 4b ) , we suggest that ntrc preferentially activates transcription from the p4 promoter in n - starved e. coli rather than from the p3 promoter .
to demonstrate in vitro that p4 represents a bona fide ntrc and sigma54 - rnap - dependent promoter , we conducted a small primed rna ( sprna ) synthesis assay20 using purified e. coli ntrc , sigma54 and rnap and using purified e. coli ntrc , sigma54 and rnap and a promoter dna fragment ( encompassing sequences - 261 to + 75 with respect to p4 tss ) and thus containing the ntrc binding site and p4 promoter region .
since the sequence of the template strand at p4 is gacc ( position - 1 to + 3 ) , we used the sprna assay to monitor the accumulation of the 32p labelled and dinucleotide cpu - primed rna product ( cpupgpg ) in the presence alpha32p - gtp .
the cpupgpg rna product is only synthesized under conditions when ntrc is phosphorylated in situ with carbamyl phosphate and sigma54 - rnap is present ( supplementary fig. 4c , lanes 4 and 5 ) .
notably , an alignment of the rela regulatory sequences from several representatives of the enterobacteriaceae family indicates that the regulatory mechanism involving ntrc and the sigma54 - rnap that governs the transcription of rela under n starvation is conserved ( supplementary fig. 5 ) .
ntrc couples the ntr and stringent responses in e. coli zimmer et al.2 previously concluded that the ntr stress response represents a scavenging response since many of the ntrc - activated genes encode transport systems of n - containing compounds .
the new results provided in this study reveal that during n starvation e. coli uses ntrc to integrate the need to scavenge for n with stringent - response - mediated changes that enable cells to adapt to low n availability. by directly activating the expression of rela and so elevating the intracellular concentration of ppgpp , the effector molecule of stringent response , cells are expected to further reprogramme gene expression .
in support of this view , a small increase in rela expression has been shown to profoundly increase intracellular ppgpp levels12 .
since transcription initiation is a major regulatory target of ppgpp , which binds to the rnap and either positively or negatively affects its ability to form transcriptionally proficient complexes with the promoter892122 , we examined the binding profiles of rnap under n + and n - growth conditions at 60 ppgpp responsive promoters listed on the ecocyc database23 .
the results reveal the expected rnap binding profiles at 35 of the 60 ppgpp responsive promoters , thereby clearly demonstrating that ntrc stimulates the stringent response in n - starved e. coli ( fig. 3 and supplementary fig. 6 ) .
rnap binding is positively affected at promoters of genes involved in transcriptional reprogramming ( for example , rpos , rpoh and rpoe ) , amino - acid biosynthesis ( for example , hislgdcbhafi ) and stress adaptation ( for example , bola , releb and grxb ) .
rnap binding is negatively affected at promoters of genes involved in translation ( for example , rpsa , rpmh , rnpa , rrsc ) , nucleotide metabolism ( for example , apt ) and ppgpp degradation ( spot ) .
however , rnap binding at 22 of the 60 ppgpp responsive promoters is unaffected in n - starved e. coli and 3 display altered binding that is not expected ( supplementary fig. 6 ) .
results from differential gene expression analysis ( t = n - versus t = n +) are consistent with the chip - seq data to a large extent and reveal that 37 out of 60 promoters display the expected transcriptional activity at t = n - ( supplementary table 1 ) .
in e. coli and several other bacteria , ppgpp is also the major regulator of bacterial persistence , a phenomenon characterized by slow growth and tolerance to antibiotics and other environmental stresses ; a family of genes known as toxin - antitoxin ( ta ) pairs play a pivotal role in the acquisition of the persistence phenotype6 .
we note that rnap binds to promoters of 9 of the 12 ta genes found in e. coli under n - but not n + conditions , thus implying that n starvation could cause a shift towards a persistent phenotype ( supplementary fig. 7 ) .
discussion the principal finding of this study is that ntrc , the master regulator of the ntr stress response , activates the transcription of rela from a sigma54 - dependent promoter in n - starved e. coli and other members of the enterobacteriaceae family .
a physiological theme for sigma54 - dependent gene regulation has yet to emerge , as the sigma54 - dependent genes described to date control a diverse set of cellular processes2425 .
the finding that transcription of rela in n - starved e. coli exclusively depends on the rnap containing the sigma54 promoter specificity factor further underscores the fundamental importance of sigma54 to bacterial physiology .
previous studies demonstrated that the ntr stress response is amplified through the transcriptional activation of the global transcription factor nitrogen assimilation control protein ( nac ) by ntrc226 .
our results reveal a far wider ranging control of genes occurs through a direct interface of the master ntr stress response transcription activator ntrc with the bacterial stringent response system .
the results predict that ntrc - mediated activation of rela expression will lead to elevated intracellular levels of ppgpp , which , although consistent with multiple independent observations from gene expression and chip - seq data , requires to be directly confirmed in future studies .
nevertheless , the discovery that the regulation of rela expression , which synthesizes one of the major effectors of stringent response , ppgpp , is integrated into the ntr stress response in n - starved e. coli and possibly in other enteric bacteria provides a paradigmatic example of the dynamic complexity of bacterial transcription regulatory networks .
such behaviour allows bacteria to efficiently adapt to nutritional adversity and demonstrates how bacteria may acquire new metabolic states in response to stress .

figure 3 ntrc couples the ntr stress response and stringent response in n - starved e. coli .
the cartoon in the middle of the figure represents the model by which n starvation is sensed and leads to the ntrc - mediated activation of transcription of rela , which subsequently leads to the production of ppgpp .
around this cartoon , we show screenshots of integrative genome viewer32 with tracks showing the binding profiles ( tag density ) as measured by chip - seq of rnap binding in n - non - starved ( denoted as n +) and n - starved ( denoted as n - ) e. coli aligned against the upstream regions of a representative set of known ppgpp responsive promoters grouped into key cellular processes .
a track with the input dna control tag density ( denoted as input ) is shown for comparison .
the screenshots in the green and red boxes denote promoters at which rnap binding is positively and negatively , respectively , affected by ppgpp .

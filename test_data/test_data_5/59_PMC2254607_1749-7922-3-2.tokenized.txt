introduction a continuous process of trauma centre evaluation is essential to ensure the development and progression of trauma care at regional , national and international levels .
evaluation may be by comparison between pooled datasets or by direct benchmarking between centres .
this study attempts to benchmark mortality at two trauma centres standardising this for multiple case - mix factors , which includes the prevalence of individual background pre - existing diseases within the study population .
methods trauma patients with an injury severity score ( iss ) > 15 admitted to the two centres in 2001 and 2002 were included in the study with the exception of those who died in the emergency department .
patient characteristics were analysed in terms of 18 case - mix factors including glasgow coma scale on arrival , injury severity score and the presence or absence of 9 co - morbidity types , and patient outcome was compared based on in - hospital mortality before and after standardisation .
results crude mortality was greater at uhns ( 18.2 vs 14.5 %) with a non - significant odds ratio of 1.31 prior to adjusting for case - mix ( p = 0.171 ) .
adjustment for case mix using logistic regression analysis altered the odds ratio to 1.64 , which was not significant ( p = 0.069 ) .
discussion this study did not demonstrate any significant difference in the outcome of patients treated at either hospital during the study period .
more importantly it has raised several important methodological issues pertinent to researchers undertaking registry based benchmarking studies .
data at the two registries was collected by personnel with differing backgrounds , in formats that were not completely compatible and was collected for patients that met different admissions criteria .
the inclusion of a meaningful analysis of pre - existing disease was limited by the availability of robust data and sample size .
we suggest greater communication between trauma research coordinators to ensure equivalent data collection and facilitate future benchmarking studies .
introduction the outcome of trauma patients managed by individual centres is influenced by multiple factors including investment in the trauma service infrastructure , the facilities , technology and experience available at each centre , the type of injuries sustained and the background demographics of the patients managed .
the performance of trauma centres has been evaluated by comparing outcomes with norms derived from pooled datasets , as in triss analysis and its modifications , and by benchmarking studies [ 1 - 3 ] .
the logistic regression used in triss analysis uses few case - mix factors : age , injury severity score , glasgow coma score , systolic blood pressure and respiratory rate .
data collected by trauma centre registries are however generally more detailed than those submitted to pooled national databases and provide a richer set of case mix factors to allow a more discerning comparison .
a previous benchmarking study of trauma centre outcome compared the university hospital of north staffordshire ( uhns ) with oregon health sciences university ( ohsu ) in the united states [ 4 ] .
the crude mortality analysis demonstrated a highly significant odds - ratio of 1.64 in favour of ohsu that was rendered non - significant after adjusting for case mix , which included twenty - three factors with equivalent definitions .
the presence or absence of a significant past medical history was included as a binary variable ( yes / no ) , providing this as the only indicator of co - morbidity with no qualification of severity or type .
adjusting case - mix for this binary indicator of co - morbidity does not accurately allow discrimination between the outcomes of two centres treating patients with a differing prevalence of significant pre - existing diseases , each of which can detrimentally effect the outcome of major trauma to a differing extent , as was demonstrated in a case control study by morris et al [ 5 ] .
in this study comparing two major trauma centres , one in the united kingdom and one in australia , we have attempted to account for the influence of pre - existing disease on mortality by including the prevalence of individual co - morbid factors within the case - mix adjustment .
the university hospital of north staffordshire , stoke - on - trent , united kingdom the university hospital of north staffordshire ( uhns ) is a large acute hospital with over 1000 beds .
it has a local catchment population of 0.5 million and accepts tertiary referrals ( except major burns ) from a total of 1.7 million .
the trauma research department collects data on all injured patients who stay longer than 72 hours in hospital , are admitted to the intensive care unit , die or are transferred from other hospitals .
co - morbidity data are routinely collected , but in non - mandatory fields .
the royal melbourne hospital , melbourne , australia the royal melbourne hospital ( rmh ) provides one of two adult major trauma services accepting tertiary referrals from the state of victoria .
it shares a total catchment population of over three million with the alfred hospital , melbourne ( ah ) .
all surgical specialties ( except for a burns service ) are available on - site .
its trauma research department collects data for all patients who are admitted for longer than 24 hours or who die .
patient co - morbidity data are collected in a structured way , using the pre - defined conditions from the american college of surgeons' trauma dataset [ 6 ] .
methods all patients admitted to the two centres between 1st january 2001 and 31st december 2002 with an injury severity score ( iss ) over 15 were identified , including those transferred from other hospitals .
patients who were dead on arrival or who died in the emergency department were excluded .
data relating to eighteen case mix factors ( excluding the nine co - morbidity factors ) were extracted from both trauma registries after agreement that equivalent definitions were being used ( table 1 ) .
data for the co - morbidity factors were extracted directly from the trauma registry at rmh .
at uhns the original complete hospital clinical records were obtained and patients' co - morbidity was then classified retrospectively according to the forty six disease types routinely recorded by the rmh .
a standardised form was used to record the presence or absence of each condition for every patient .

twenty - seven factors were studied , with automatic variable selection procedures ( stepwise forward and backward algorithms ) to suggest the best fitting logistic model .
a 5 % level of statistical significance was used to test statistical hypothesis and construct confidence intervals .
results the rmh admitted 420 patients with an iss > 15 between 1st january 2000 and 1st january 2003 , while during this period uhns admitted 329 patients .
tables 2 to 4 show the frequency of individual factors .

adjustment for case mix altered the odds ratio to 1.64 , but this was not statistically significant ( p = 0.069 ) ( table 5 ) .

pre - existing disease in trauma patients is an independent risk factor for mortality , though some studies have indicated that it is less important than the mechanism of injury , the severity and site of injuries , and patient age [ 7 - 9 ] .
the crude mortality rate was higher for stoke than melbourne ( 18.2 % vs 14.5 %) but while the odds ratio increased from 1.31 to 1.64 after standardisation for case - mix , including co - morbidity , this did not reach statistical significance .
the mean number of co - morbidity factors per patient was higher at rmh ( 1.04 versus 0.75 ) , which may relate to differences in patient health behaviour , medical practice or simply by the completeness of co - morbidity recording in the two trauma registries .
the incidence of the nine specific co - morbidities was similar with the exception of hypertension and chronic drug abuse , both of which were higher in the rmh population .
a previous study looking at the presence of pre - existing conditions and mortality in older patients has shown hypertension to have a protective effect on outcome , possibly relating to the prescription of beta - blockers [ 7 ] .
less than 8 % of major trauma ( iss > 15 ) was penetrating in both centres , with rmh having double the incidence of uhns .
the lower rate of injuries in the ' external ' region may reflect the presence of a nearby specialist burns unit in melbourne , reducing the likelihood of primary transfer to rmh .
similarly , the slightly higher mean age at rmh may be due to the presence of a regional paediatric major trauma service operated from melbourne royal children 's hospital .
victoria state ( 227,620 sq. km ) is more than seventy - five times larger than the north west midlands in the uk ( 2,997 sq. km ) .
it would be surprising if the contrasting geographical features of the australian catchment area did not have an influence on outcome .
the proportion of major trauma patients transferred into rmh from primary hospitals was more than twice that transferred into uhns , however in the analysis whether the patient was transferred or not was not a significant discriminator .
this study attempts to standardise mortality taking into account pre - existing disease but has several important limitations that merit discussion .
the categorisation of co - morbidity was limited to a binary system relating to the presence or absence of individual co - morbidity and information regarding disease severity was not included due to the difficulty in quantifying this retrospectively .
in addition , due to the size of the study populations only the 9 most prevalent disease types ( of the 46 types recorded ) could be included in analysis , excluding conditions such as cancer , renal failure and hepatic disease that have previously been shown to increase significantly the risk of death in elderly trauma patients [ 10 ] .
patient outcome is influenced by the nature and expediency of pre - hospital care , which we could not include within the case - mix standardisation because of the limited compatibility of available pre - hospital data recorded within the registries , and limited power due to population size .
for inclusion of the above case - mix factors in a benchmarking study the sample size would have to be significantly larger if it were to prove a statistically significant difference in outcome .
this would only be possible if individual trauma registries collected data for equivalent patients groups in a standardised format , and this was undertaken by staff with similar experience and training submitting information to the national registry .
while this study has several methodological limitations it has highlighted the need for greater cooperation between trauma registry programme coordinators to ensure that data , including that relating to co - morbidity , is classified in a standardised format pertinent to future benchmarking studies necessary to drive global improvements in trauma care .
as trauma systems have improved , unexpected death rates have fallen making mortality a less discerning indicator of performance .
disability and morbidity are being heralded as better discriminators of outcome , although the validity of the current disability measures remains uncertain .
as our ability to quantify outcome in this way improves , the importance of a robust analysis of co - morbidity becomes obvious .

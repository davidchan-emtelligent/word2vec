a great number of basic and clinical studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the development and progression of chronic heart failure ( chf ) .
however , there is limited information about the role of novel cytokine interleukin - 37 ( il - 37 ) in heart failure .
we measured plasma il - 37 levels by enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) in 158 patients with chronic heart failure and 30 control subjects .
our results showed that plasma il - 37 levels were significantly elevated in patients with chf compared with healthy controls ( 143.73 +/ - 26.83 pg / ml versus 45.2 +/ - 11.56 pg / ml , p < 0.001 ) .
furthermore , plasma il - 37 levels were positively correlated with hs - crp , hs - tnt , and nt - probnp and negatively correlated with left ventricular ejection function ( lvef ) .
11 patients died of cardiovascular cause , and 27 hf patients were rehospitalized for worsening hf within 12 months .
multivariate cox regression analysis showed that plasma il - 37 is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events ( mace ) .
furthermore , chf patients with > 99 pg / ml plasma il - 37 had significantly higher incidences of mace within 12 months .
our data suggest that plasma il - 37 may play a role in the pathogenesis of chf and may be a novel predictor of poor prognosis in hf patients .
1. introduction chronic heart failure ( chf ) is defined as impaired cardiac structure and / or function in ventricular filling or ejection that result in a complex set of clinical syndromes [ 1 ]. with the development of immunohistochemistry and molecular cell biology , the basic mechanism of heart failure has been proven to be due to cardiac remodeling characterized by necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and progressive expansion of the ventricular cavity [ 2 , 3 ] .
a large number of studies have shown a close association between inflammation and cardiac remodeling .
inflammatory mediators , especially tumor necrosis factor - ( tnf - ) alpha , interleukin - ( il - ) 6 , il - 1beta , and il - 18 , impair cardiac function by promoting cardiomyocyte apoptosis , cardiac hypertrophy , inflammatory response , and matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( mmp - 9 ) activity ; their plasma levels are increased in heart failure in association with disease severity [ 3 - 5 ] .
many groups therefore proposed inhibiting inflammation as a potent therapeutic target in heart failure [ 3 , 5 ] .
however , chf is a more complicated process and there remain many unknowns regarding the relationship between inflammation and heart failure .
interleukin - 37 belongs to the il - 1 ligand family and is a newly identified anti - inflammatory cytokine [ 6 ] .
il - 37 inhibits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as il - 1beta , il - 6 , and tnf - alpha in peripheral blood monocytes , macrophages , dendritic cells , and epithelial cells , playing a critical role in innate immunity and adaptive immunity [ 7 ] .
a great number of studies demonstrated that il - 37 is involved in the occurrence and development of chronic inflammation and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and diabetes [ 8 - 11 ] .
in addition , evidence from clinical and animal studies has confirmed that il - 37 not only participates in atherosclerotic disease but also has a close relationship with impaired heart function [ 12 - 14 ] .
however , the level of plasma il - 37 in heart failure has yet been investigated .
the goal of our study was to examine the plasma il - 37 level in patients with chf and assess its relation to clinical parameters and biochemical laboratory data .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
study population a total of 158 patients were enrolled in this study .
the diagnosis of chf was based on typical symptoms and signs of heart failure and evidence of left ventricular enlargement and systolic functional impairment on echocardiography , according to the american college of cardiology / american heart association guidelines [ 1 ] .
exclusion include patients with chf secondary to specific aetiologies ( e.g. , malignant disease , chronic inflammatory disease , and / or infiltrative or congenital heart disease ) and with end - stage renal failure ( defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 15 ml / min.m2 ) .
thirty healthy individuals were selected as control subjects who matched with chf patients in age , gender , and body mass index ( bmi ) .
every participant provided written informed consent , and the study was approved by the hospital ethical review board ( shaanxi province people 's hospital and center for cardiovascular diseases , china ) .
all study procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards outlined in the declaration of helsinki of 1975 , as revised in 1983 .
2.2 .
study procedures once recruited , baseline assessments involve standardized history taking , physical examination , a resting 12 - lead electrocardiogram , chest x - ray , blood sampling , and comprehensive transthoracic doppler echocardiography using standardized equipment ( vivid ultrasound systems , general electric , milwaukee , wi , usa ) complying with recommendations from the american society of echocardiography ( 2009 ) .
coronary angiography was performed to define ischemic heart disease ( ihd ) and non - ihd as needed .
all patients were followed up to 12 months from discharge to evaluate major adverse cardiac events ( mace ) , which was defined as first rehospitalization for chf or death due to cardiovascular cause .
2.3 .
elisa detection of the levels of plasma il - 37 the level of plasma il - 37 ( adipogen ag , liestal , switzerland ) was measured by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) , following the manufacturer 's instructions .
the minimal detectable concentration of il - 37 by this assay is 10 pg / ml for il - 37 .
the elisa intra - assay and inter - assay coefficients of variation are < 5 % and < 10 % , respectively .
all of the samples were measured in duplicate .
2.4 .
statistical analysis the spss 17.0 software package ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) was employed for statistical processing .
measurement data were presented as mean +/ - sd or median .
numeration data were presented as a constituent ratio .
all continuous variables were tested for normal distribution and homogeneity for variance .
comparisons of chf patients versus control subjects and the subgroup of chf patients were performed using the two - tailed student t - test .
coefficients of correlation ( r ) were calculated using pearson 's correlation coefficient .
hazard ratios ( hr ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) were calculated for each factor with cox proportional hazards analysis .
to identify independent predictors of major adverse cardiac events , all baseline variables with p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate model .
in addition , differences in event - free survival by median of plasma il - 37 ( il - 37 <= 99 pg / ml and il - 37 > 99 pg / ml ) were examined using the kaplan - meier method and compared using a log - rank test .
differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 .
3. results 3.1 .
clinical characteristics in patients with chf the baseline clinical characteristics of patients with chf are summarized in table 1 .
the mean age of patients was 65.25 +/ - 9.63 years , and 67.72 % were male .
the mean bmi of patients was 23.33 +/ - 2.09 kg / m2 .
the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease ( ihd ) , hypertension ( hp ) , and diabetes mellitus ( dm ) was 56.33 % , 46.20 % , and 18.35 % , respectively .
the distribution of patients among the new york heart association ( nyha ) cardiac function class included 62.03 % from class ii / iii and 37.97 % from class iv. the proportion of patients who were taking drugs was 88.61 % of an angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( acei )/ angiotensin ii receptor blocker ( arb ) , 83.54 % of beta - blocker , 74.68 % of loop diuretic , 44.30 % of aldosterone antagonist , and 28.48 % of digoxin .
the mean left ventricular ejection function ( lvef ) of chf patients was 37.82 +/ - 4.90 % .
the concentration of plasma biomarkers hs - tnt , hs - crp , and nt - probnp was 37.82 +/ - 4.90 pg / ml , 3.62 +/ - 1.08 ng / ml , and 2043.59 +/ - 1094.89 pg / ml , respectively .
in this study , the median length of follow - up was 109 days ( range 35 to 365 days ) .
no patient was lost to the follow - up .
3.2 .
plasma il - 37 elevated in chf patients the mean plasma il - 37 level in patients with chf was significantly elevated ( 143.73 +/ - 26.83 pg / ml ) compared with that in control subjects ( 45.2 +/ - 11.56 pg / ml ) ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ( a )) .
in subgroup analyses of chf patients , there was no significant difference between patients with ihd and without ihd , as well as patients with hypertension ( hp ) and with normal blood pressure ( non - hp ) ( all p > 0.05 ) ( figures 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c )) .
however , plasma il - 37 level in chf patients with dm was significantly higher compared to that in patients without diabetes ( p < 0.01 ) ( figure 1 ( d )) .
3.3 .
correlation of plasma il - 37 with lvef and biomarkers next , we examined the correlation between plasma il - 37 and biomarkers of cardiac events , disease , and function and lvef .
as shown in figure 2 , plasma il - 37 positively correlated with hs - tnt ( figure 2 ( a )) , hs - crp ( figure 2 ( b )) , and nt - probnp ( figure 2 ( c )) ( all p < 0.001 ) .
however , plasma il - 37 negatively correlated with lvef ( figure 2 ( d )) ( p < 0.001 ) .
3.4 .
higher plasma il - 37 is an independent predictor for mace within 12 months in chf patients in this study , 38 major adverse cardiac events of 158 chf patients were recorded within 12 months from discharge , including 11 patient deaths and 27 patient rehospitalizations for worsening hf. in the univariate cox regression model , bmi , dm , lvef , hs - tnt , hs - crp , nt - probnp , and il - 37 were associated with mace in chf patients ( table 2 ) .
when we performed cox stepwise multivariate analysis including all variables with p < 0.05 on a univariate analysis , plasma il - 37 and nt - probnp were significant predictors of mace within 12 months of follow - up. to determine the predictive value of the concentration of il - 37 on mace , we divided chf patients into a subgroup with il - 37 <= 99 pg / ml and > 99 pg / ml by median levels of plasma il - 37 .
kaplan - meier curves and log - rank testing revealed that chf patients with a higher concentration of plasma il - 37 (> 99 pg / ml ) had significantly higher mace within 12 months from discharge ( figure 3 ) ( p < 0.001 ) .
4. discussion in the present study , our results showed that plasma il - 37 levels were significantly elevated in patients with chf compared with healthy controls ( 143.73 +/ - 26.83 pg / ml versus 45.2 +/ - 11.56 pg / ml , p < 0.001 ) .
furthermore , plasma il - 37 levels positively correlated with hs - crp , hs - tnt , and nt - probnp and negatively correlated with lvef .
11 patients died of cardiovascular cause , and 27 patients were rehospitalized for worsening hf within 12 months .
multivariate cox regression analysis showed that plasma il - 37 is an independent predictor of mace in patients with chf .
furthermore , chf patients with > 99 pg / ml plasma il - 37 had significantly higher incidences of mace within 12 months .
our data suggest that plasma il - 37 might be involved in the pathogenesis of chf and may be a novel predictor of poor prognosis in hf patients .
il - 37 is a novel homolog of the il - 1 cytokine family discovered by computational cloning and was originally designated as il - 1h4 in 2000 [ 15 ] .
il - 37 is synthesized as a precursor molecule that needs to be cleaved by caspase - 1 to generate mature il - 37 [ 16 ] .
the production of il - 37 occurs at low levels in a physiological state and can be effectively induced in an inflammatory environment .
studies have shown that inflammatory stimulants such as ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , and lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) promote the expression of il - 37 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells , dendritic cells , and epidermal cells .
recent studies confirmed that activated t lymphocytes also secrete il - 37 in an inducible manner [ 17 ] .
both endogenous and exogenous il - 37 have been shown to ameliorate inflammation and regulate immune disorder via inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators including ifn - gamma , tnf - alpha , il - 6 , and il - 18 [ 6 , 7 ] .
accumulating evidence shows that il - 37 plays a critical role in cardiovascular disease [ 7 , 12 - 14 ] .
boraschi et al. first found high expression of il - 37 in atherosclerotic coronary and carotid artery plaques [ 7 ] .
ji et al. observed that circulating il - 37 levels are significantly increased and correlated with inflammatory markers and impaired left ventricular function in patients with acute coronary syndrome [ 12 ]. by using a myocardial ischemia / reperfusion injury model , wu et al. found that exogenous il - 37 reduced infarct size , decreased cardiac troponin t levels , and improved cardiac function via suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the infiltration of leukocyte [ 13 ] .
another study showed that il - 37 treatment can improve cardiac function through inhibiting the activation of nf - kappab signaling pathway in a myocardial infarction model [ 14 ] .
coronary artery disease / myocardial infarction is one of the important causes of heart failure .
in the present study , we are the first to demonstrate that plasma il - 37 becomes elevated in chronic heart failure patients , indicating a potential role of il - 37 in the development of heart failure .
cardiac remodeling is the fundamental pathological process of heart failure .
it is defined as structural and functional changes in the myocardium that result in left ventricular dilatation leading to heart failure [ 18 ] .
in this study , we found that baseline il - 37 levels in patients with heart failure negatively correlate with lvef while positively correlating with nt - probnp and hs - tnt , the two most extensively studied biomarkers in evaluating the severity of cardiac function .
these results are partly consistent with previous research that showed plasma il - 37 levels correlate with inflammatory markers and impaired left ventricular function in patients with acute coronary syndrome [ 12 ] .
however , it is noted that our results found no significant differences in plasma il - 37 levels between the ihd and non - ihd subgroups .
this observation seems contradictory with previous findings of elevated plasma il - 37 levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome .
because numerous research studies have confirmed the role of inflammation in acute coronary syndrome , the possible explanation for this contradiction is that il - 37 levels in plasma may correlate with the grade of inflammation rather than the disease status .
this notion is further solidified by our results that plasma il - 37 levels positively correlate with hs - crp , a well - known biomarker of inflammation [ 19 ] .
also , we did not observe significant differences in plasma il - 37 levels in the hp and non - hp subgroups .
interestingly , our study shows significantly increased il - 37 levels in the dm subgroup compared to that in the non - dm subgroup .
although ballak et al. found that elevated il - 37 levels positively correlate with insulin sensitivity and a lower inflammatory status in human adipose tissue and that il - 37 ameliorates obesity - induced inflammation and insulin resistance in transgenic mice , the reasonable possibility for this discrepancy is that the dm status more closely correlates with the poor cardiac function in chf patients [ 10 , 20 ] .
finally , in this study , we demonstrated for the first time that plasma il - 37 is an independent predictor for mace within 12 months .
there are numerous reports that nt - probnp and lvef are predictors of poor outcomes in heart failure patients [ 21 , 22 ] .
impaired lvef is a hallmark of heart failure and reflects a fundamental weakness of the pump .
it is no doubt that the lower the lvef , the worse the prognosis of patients with heart failure .
in this study , we showed that the higher concentration of plasma il - 37 (> 99 pg / ml ) is a significant predictor of recurrent hospitalizations for worsening hf and deaths due to a cardiovascular cause , independent of other clinical and laboratory variables .
we believe that the increase in plasma il - 37 is associated with inflammation , cardiac remodeling , and acute cardiovascular events in heart failure patients .
however , a direct causal relationship between an increase in plasma il - 37 and inflammation was not found in the study .
in conclusion , our study is the first to investigate the association between plasma il - 37 levels and chronic heart failure .
we found that plasma il - 37 levels are significantly increased in patients with chf and that the increase in plasma il - 37 levels is an unfavorable prognosis for patients with heart failure .
however , there are some limitations in the present study .
when performing the prognostic analysis , a sample population of 158 subjects is too small and a 12 - month follow - up is too short , although statistical significance has been found .
therefore , a prospective trial consisting of a larger number of patients with heart failure and longer period of follow - up needs to be performed to clarify the significance of circulating il - 37 levels in heart failure .
furthermore , to fully assess the role of plasma il - 37 on cardiac inflammation and left ventricular remodeling , future studies are required to examine the underlying mechanism responsible for the increase of plasma il - 37 in patients with chronic heart failure .

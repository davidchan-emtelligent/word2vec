we previously demonstrated that hiv - specific antibodies from elite controllers ( ecs ) robustly recruit nk cells to mediate antibody dependent cellular viral inhibition ( adcvi ) compared to antibodies from chronic progressors .
to gain further insights into the biophysical properties of ec antibodies that enable them to recruit fc - effector functions so robustly , we performed at 24 dimensional analysis ( including specificity , isotype , fc - receptor affinity , and function ) of the antibody profiles mounted in ecs and hiv - progressors to define the humoral signature ( s ) associated with most robust innate immune recruiting activity .
methods a total of thirty donors were included in this study ( 10 untreated chronics , 10 treated chronics , 10 ecs ) .
anti - gp120 , p24 , gp41 and gp140 antibody binding titers were quantified by elisa and a customized - multiplex hiv binding assay against hiv recombinant gp120 , p24 , gp41 and gp140 .
fc - receptor affinity was analyzed by biacore .
adcvi , adcc , and adcp were quantified as previously described .
results while no differences were observed in the antibody binding titer between ecs and chronic progressors against gp120 or gp41 , we showed that ecs exhibited a higher level of p24 - specific antibodies , associated with robust adcvi activity .
moreover , humoral responses in ecs were skewed toward igg1 and igg3 responses , compared to chronic progressors , that strongly predicted enhanced adcvi activity .
similar skewing of antibody responses were observed in rv144 vaccinees , strongly suggesting that specific cues elicited within this vaccine trial may have resulting in the induction of highly potent innate immune recruiting antibodies similar to those found in ecs .
conclusion overall , ecs elicit a skewed humoral immune response marked by the preferential selection of hiv specific igg1 and igg3 antibody subclasses , that parallels the humoral immune responses observed in rv144 vaccinees .
therefore , characterizing these unique antiviral capacities may provide critical information on humoral responses that could potentiate vaccine - induced responses .

http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 abstract rationale : mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver is one type of rare liver tumor .
patient concerns : mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver ( mhl ) is rarely reported in the left lobe of the liver in children who are more than 2 years old .
it is difficult to distinguish it from liver lesions such as hepatoblastoma in children , and hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia in adults .
in addition , it is hard to correctly diagnose it without pathological examination .
diagnoses : mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver .
interventions : this patient underwent an operation assisted by the da vinci surgical system and the tumor was completely resected .
outcomes : no tumor recurrence or metastasis was observed 14 months after operation .
lessons : mhl is a benign tumor that is difficult to diagnose due to the lack of specific clinical symptoms and signs .
the management of mhl remains controversial .
to achieve a good long - term outcome , complete resection of mhl is recommended .
keywords 4 years old boy mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver surgery twins open - accesstrue 1 introduction mesenchymal hamartomas of the liver ( mhl ) was first reported in 1903 by maresch. [ 1 ] up to 2003 , the number of all mhl cases reported in english was less than 200. [ 2 ] it is the second most common benign tumor in children within 2 years old. [ 3,4 ] however , the tumor is rare in children more than 2 years old and adults .
only 46 adult cases have been reported up to now. [ 5 ] about 75 % of mhl was found in the right lobe of the liver. [ 4 ] the clinical manifestations and radiological examinations of mhl are typically nonspecific .
it is often misdiagnosed as other diseases , such as hepatoblastoma ( hb ) of children , hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) of adults , or focal nodular hyperplasia ( fnh ).[ 6 ] here , we report a male child ( 4 and a half years old ) with mhl in the left lateral lobe of the liver .
the tumor size was 14 cm x 13 cm x 7 cm and was removed by an operation through the da vinci surgical system ( dvss ) .
interestingly , the patient had an identical twin who was admitted to our hospital to take a magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) test of his liver .
the result showed no positive findings .
we reviewed and analyzed the literature to provide useful information for doctors to distinguish the disease .
2 methods and results a 4 and a half years old male child presented to our hospital for abdominal swelling .
the child occasionally felt stomach ache that was relieved for no reason .
the child showed no obvious tenderness and rebound .
he was born as a premature baby in the 32nd week of his mother 's pregnancy .
his medical history included inguinal hernia on 2 sides , but he had only received an operation for the left inguinal hernia .
no family or genetic history was found .
physical examination of this child showed that the abdomen was obviously bulging .
the mass could be touched below umbilicus about 3 fingers .
there were no other positive signs .
the results of laboratory tests were almost normal , including alpha - fetoprotein ( afp ) level .
the child - pugh score was less than 5 .
abdominal ultrasonography showed an uneven lesion in the liver and a diagnosis of hb was considered .
enhancement computed tomography ( ct ) scanning showed a large mass in the left upper abdomen and left lobe of the liver with an irregular edge .
the size of the mass was 12.3 x 10.2 x 7.2 cm ( fig. 1 ) .
there was an uneven nodular shadow and the edge was obvious when the mass was enhanced .
calcification and an expanded bile duct were not observed .
the left branch of the portal was pressed and the distant part was shown to be unclear .
abnormal was not observed in the right branch .
according to the medical history , the diagnosis of hb was considered .
we did not recommend a biopsy to the patient because it might cause bleeding and tumor diffusion .
an operation was necessary .
figure 1 preoperative abdominal ct scanning .
( a ) arterial phase shows the edge of mhl is enhanced .
( b ) arterial phase shows uneven nodular enhancement .
( c ) portal vein phase shows left branch of the portal was pressed and distant part is not clear .
( d ) portal vein phase shows uneven enhancement and the edge is clear .
the patient underwent dvss surgery with sufficient preparation .
exploration showed an extrahepatic 12 x 10 cm mass in the left lobe of the liver ( fig. 2 ) .
after the operation , the sample was split .
the edge of the tumor was clear but no envelope .
tremelloid mesenchyme was seen on the section ( fig. 2c ) .
the pathological examination showed that the sample was grey red and 14 x 13 x 7 cm in size .
the color of the section was grey red and grey white .
mhl was diagnosed ( fig. 3 ) .
immunohistochemistry results ( fig. 4 ) were the following : mesenchymal cd34 (+) , d2 - 40 (+) , s - 100 ( - ) , sma (+) , cd7 ( - ) , epithelium ck19 (+) , afp ( - ) , hcg ( - ) .
after 9 days of recovery , the patient returned home without complications .
a follow - up examination , which included blood routine , liver renal function , coagulation routine , and ultrasound scan at 30 days , did not show any abnormality .
no adverse or unanticipated event was presented .

3 discussion mhl was first reported in 1903 by maresch. [ 1 ] it also has other names such as cavernous lymph adenomatoid tumor , bile cell fibroadenoma , or benign mesenchymoma .
edmondson [ 7 ] provided the first definite description of mhl .
the incidence of mhl is 0.7 per million population per year. [ 8 ] the precise pathogenesis of mhl is uncertain .
aberrant mesenchymal development in the portal tract , likely related to the bile ducts , is the most accepted theory. [ 9,10 ] some reports suggest that mhl has the potential to become embryonal sarcoma or angiosarcoma , though there have been no reported cases .
some researches have shown that the c19mc gene on chromosome band 19q13.4 has some bugs .
a cluster of 46 micrornas is encoded by the gene .
those micrornas are normally only expressed from the paternal allele and in the placenta. [ 11 ] in 2010 , for a 2 years old female child with mhl , sugito et al [ 12 ] reported a chromosome test that showed t ( 11 ; 19 )( q13 ; q13.4 ) .
mhl often occurs in children within 2 years old , with an average age of 15 months old .
a slight male predominance ( 3:2 male : female ratio )[ 13 ] is observed for mhl .
here , some literature related to mhl is discussed ( table 1 ).[ 14 - 28 ] approximately 80 % ( 14 / 18 ) of patients were less than 2 years old .
all patients had neither brothers nor sisters .
approximately 80 % ( 14 / 18 ) came to hospital for mass or abdominal distention .
only 23 % ( 4 / 17 ) of patients had mass in the left lobe of the liver .
only 2 patients had a high level of afp .
only 28 % ( 5 / 18 ) of patients got correct diagnosis before operation .
almost all patients had no special medical history .
typical clinical manifestations included painless and progressive bloating and abdominal mass .
however , they usually do not become emaciated , in contrast to hb. a small number of patients had a high level of alpha - fetoprotein .
the size of mhl varied from a few millimeters to more than 15 cm , or even 30 cm. [ 13 ] seventy - five percent of cases occurred in the right lobe of the liver .
ultrasound scans often showed uneven lesions , maybe for reasons of unique cystic mass .
there was no rich blood flow sign because of a lack of vessels .
clear blood flow could not be seen at the end of portal or hepatic vein , perhaps because of repression .
mhl showed no specific characteristic under unenhanced ct , whereas it showed multiple small cystic lesions in a solid mass in enhanced ct scan. [ 14 ] the mr image of mhl is also diverse , that the characteristic of mr image depends on cysts , protein content in the fluid , and stromal composition of the mass. [ 14 ] because of liver fibrosis , solid areas of mhl may show hypointense both on t1 and t2 - weighted images. [ 14 ] no doctor used the nuclear medicine method to confirm this .
the pathological features are the following : the surface of tumor is smooth and soft , and cysts were found on the section .
those cysts contain mucus .
hematoxylin and eosin ( he ) staining shows various kinds of mesenchymal components such as expand lymphatic , vessel , irregular bile duct , myxoid matrix , and collagen .
some liver cells scatter but some cluster together .
the tumor never becomes malignant and relapses after an operation .
an immunohistochemical study showed spindle cells positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin and negative for cd31 , cd34 , and s100 proteins , while the ducts stain positive for ck7 and negative for ck20. [ 29,30 ] table 1 literature review of reported mhl cases .
the characteristic of this case was that , this patient was more than 2 years old , in contrast to most reported cases .
moreover , this patient had an identical twin , while all cases of mhl in the literature did not involve any twins .
the tumor was in the left lobe of the liver , while for most cases ( 13 / 17 ) they were in the right lobe .
he had no high - level afp , which suggested that hb was not likely .
the enhancement ct showed some characteristic of mhl .
an uneven nodular shadow and edge was obvious when the mass was enhanced .
the feature of enhanced ct images matched with swiss cheese appearance .
it pointed to the way to mhl .
a limitation of the study is that we did not take mhl as a possible preoperative diagnosis because we lack experience .
we propose the diagram for diagnosis of tumor in the liver of children ( fig. 5 ) .
if we find a mass in the liver of a child , we firstly consider it to be hb because this is the most common and harmful malignant liver tumor in children .
the management of mhl remains controversial .
mhl has the potential involute spontaneously , especially those with a component of prominent .
percutaneous aspiration may be helpful for large cysts that threaten life and give a chance to take an operation .
till now , complete resection is still the recommended way to treat with mhl .
the method includes liver lobectomy and trisegmentectomy .
the method should be determined by the location of the tumor and the technical skills of doctors in liver resection .
for very large mhl , a large - scale liver resection may cause liver failure , and liver transplantation may be a good alternative .
it is the same to the unresectable tumors. [ 28,31 ] figure 5 diagram for diagnosis of tumor in the liver of children .
hb is the most common malignant liver disease in children .
it often occurs in children within 3 years old , and it composed 50 % to 62 % of malignant liver lesions in children .
hb patient often becomes emaciated , anemic , and anorexic .
liver function is usually not affected .
afp is often positive and the hepatitis b virus surface antigen is negative ( fig. 5 ) .
afp increases or decreases with tumor growth or subsides in about one - third of patients ( table 2 ) .
to treat hb , surgical intervention is usually the first choice .
chemotherapy after surgical treatment should be because hb cells are usually sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment .
table 2 imaging differential diagnosis between mhl and other types of liver mass .
hcc is the most common malignant liver disease for adults , but we also found a female infant ( 6 months old ) in our hospital with hcc .
about 90 % of patients have a background of hbv ( fig. 5 ) .
the process is rapid .
afp is positive for about 70 % of patients .
the general condition is bad for most patients ( table 2 ) .
in mhl , lack of typical clinical manifestations and characteristic image appearances make doctors difficult of diagnose it. some patients may show portal hypertension for the pressure of large mhl tumors .
we summarized a distinguish table , which may help us to recognize it. the misdiagnosis of mhl usually shows a negative influence on patient 's management .
most patients went to hospital for clinical manifestations induced by large tumors .
operations are necessary for such patients .
if mhl patient was not able to or not willing to undergo liver resection , those clinical manifestations will be still or even worse .
the tumor never becomes malignant .
it does not relapse when it is removed totally .
4 conclusion this case suggests that surgeons should consider mhl as a possible diagnosis , although it is rare in more than 2 years old children , especially for those whose afp is negative .
mhl is a benign tumor that is hard to diagnose due to nonspecific clinical manifestations or examinations .
the management of mhl remains controversial .
complete resection is recommended to treat mhl for good long - term outcomes .
it is also suggested that parents take their children to hospital for examinations at least once a year .

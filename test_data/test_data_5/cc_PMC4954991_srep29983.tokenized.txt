this is perhaps not surprising since components of the circadian clockwork are tightly coupled to metabolic processes across the body .
in the current study , we assessed the impact of obesity on the circadian system in mice at a behavioural and molecular level , and determined whether pharmacological targeting of casein kinase 1delta and epsilon ( ck1delta / epsilon ) , key regulators of the circadian clock , can confer metabolic benefit .
we demonstrate that although behavioural rhythmicity was maintained in diet - induced obesity ( dio ) , gene expression profiling revealed tissue - specific alteration to the phase and amplitude of the molecular clockwork .
clock function was most significantly attenuated in visceral white adipose tissue ( wat ) of dio mice , and was coincident with elevated tissue inflammation , and dysregulation of clock - coupled metabolic regulators pparalpha / gamma .
further , we show that daily administration of a ck1delta / epsilon inhibitor ( pf - 5006739 ) improved glucose tolerance in both dio and genetic ( ob / ob ) models of obesity .
these data further implicate circadian clock disruption in obesity and associated metabolic disturbance , and suggest that targeting of the clock represents a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of metabolic disorders .
daily 24 hour rhythms are evident in virtually all aspects of our physiology including sleep / wake cycles , feeding behaviour , metabolism , and immune response1 .
in mammals , these rhythms are orchestrated by a master circadian clock housed within the suprachiasmatic nuclei ( scn ) of the hypothalamus , and a coordinated network of semi - autonomous clocks operating throughout the brain and peripheral tissues of the body .
the influence of these local tissue clocks extends well beyond circadian timing per se , having a profound impact on global patterns of gene expression , as well as overall tissue function234 .
the importance of the circadian system and specific components of the clock to human health has also become clear , with compelling evidence linking circadian disruption to many pathological conditions , including type 2 diabetes5 .
for example , conditions that undermine the clock , such as chronic sleep disturbance and forced desynchrony , disrupt glucose homeostasis and impair insulin sensitivity , while chronic shift - work is associated with an increased incidence of obesity and diabetes6789 .
the circadian clock is tightly and reciprocally coupled to energy metabolism at both a cellular and organism level .
transcriptional and proteomic profiling studies in mice and humans consistently show metabolic processes to be highly rhythmic and under clock control101112131415 .
moreover , the circadian clock itself is responsive to energy status , with the activity or expression of many clock constituents being influenced by major metabolic regulators , such as amp - dependent kinase , sirtuins , and peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors alpha / gamma ( pparalpha / gamma ) 11617181920 .
the reciprocal nature of this coupling allows both circadian and metabolic processes to adapt to natural feeding and fasting cycles , as well as shifts in the timing of food availability .
for example , pparalpha and ppargamma directly influence transcription of bmal1 and reverbalpha1920212223 , and pparalpha driven rev - erbalpha expression is critical for realignment of the circadian clockwork to restricted feeding schedules in mice24. of course , the close interconnection of clock and metabolic processes also implies that the circadian system may be compromised during metabolic dysfunction , such as during severe obesity , and thereby contribute to obesity - related pathology .
the impact of high fat diet ( hfd ) feeding on circadian rhythms in behaviour , as well as clock gene expression in central and peripheral tissues has been examined in a number of studies ( e.g.52526272829303132 ) .
however , the extent of hfd - induced disruption to the circadian system varies between reports , with minimal effects on clock gene expression reported in some cases252728 and significant damping of circadian rhythms reported in others2932 .
it also remains unclear whether altered clock function in dio contributes to obesity - related metabolic dysfunction , such as insulin resistance .
here , we sought to clarify the impact of both acute and long - term hfd - feeding on the circadian system in mice .
to this end , we undertook a broad analysis of behavioural and molecular rhythms in hfd - fed c57bl / 6j mice .
additionally , we examined whether targeting the clock via casein kinase 1delta / epsilon ( ck1delta / epsilon ) inhibition can confer metabolic benefit in obese mice .
we have previously shown pharmacological targeting of ck1delta / epsilon to be effective in increasing scn clock rhythms , and behavioural entrainment in otherwise arrhythmic mice33 .
our current studies highlight a highly tissue - and gene - specific impact of hfd - feeding on the molecular clockwork , and show that pharmacological targeting of ck1delta / epsilon improves glucose tolerance in diet - induced and genetic models of obesity .
methods animals experimental procedures were licensed under the 1986 home office animal procedures act ( uk ) , and approved by the university of manchester animal welfare committee guidelines .
all experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the above licensing and guidelines .
male c57bl / 6j and ob / ob mice were purchased from charles river ( uk ) and harlan ( uk ) respectively .
mper2 : : luc transgenic mice34 were kindly provided by joe takahashi ( university of texas southwestern ) and subsequently bred locally .
all animals were maintained in 12 h : 12 h light : dark ( ld ) with an ambient temperature of 20 - 22 degreesc , with food and water supplied ad libitum .
diet - induced obesity and assessment of physiological rhythms for dio studies , 8 - 10 week old mice were provided ad libitum access to high fat diet ( hfd ; 60 % energy from fat ; dio rodent purified diet , ips ltd ) or normal chow ( nc ) for 2 , 8 , or 16 weeks .
prior to tissue collection , mice were placed in constant darkness ( dd ) and tissues collected every 4 h ( n = 5 - 10 / time - point / diet condition ) .
in selected experiments , body temperature ( tb ) and locomotor activity were recorded using radiotelemetry ( data sciences international ) , and metabolic gas exchange measured by indirect calorimetry using the clams system ( columbus instruments ) 35 .
food intake was monitored using the labmaster metabolism research platform ( tse systems ) , with meal size and feeding events ( see supplementary fig. s1 ) recorded over 6 days .
for ob / ob studies , mice were maintained on nc throughout , and locomotor activity was recorded in home cages using infrared beam - break sensors .
drug administration and glucose tolerance testing ( gtt ) dio mice ( 16 weeks of hfd ) and matched nc - fed controls were injected daily with vehicle ( 20 % 2 - hydroxypropyl beta - cyclodextrin ; sigma ) or the selective inhibitor of ck1delta / epsilon , pf - 5006739 ( 10 mg / kg / day , s.c. ) at zt10 .
this dose of pf - 5006739 and timing of administration was based on previous work , and selected to achieve a cns target occupancy above 50 % for ck1delta / epsilon36 ( supplementary table s1 ) .
after 3 weeks of drug treatment , mice were fasted for 6 h before administration of glucose ( 1 g / kg i.p. , n = 7 - 10 / group ) .
blood glucose was monitored with an accu - chek aviva glucose meter ( roche ) , and serum samples collected at 0 and 30 min post - glucose administration .
mice were then maintained on pf - 5006739 / vehicle dosing for a further 14d prior to tissue collection .
for ob / ob studies , mutant and control mice ( 8 weeks of age ) were dosed pf - 5006739 as described above for 14d , following which a gtt was performed ( 20 h fast followed by 1 g / kg glucose i.p ) .
serum insulin and adiponectin levels were determined by elisa ( millipore and r & d systems , respectively ) .
in situ hybridisation in situ hybridisation was performed as previously described37 .
briefly , brains were rapidly dissected and frozen .
coronal sections ( 12 mum ) were collected using a cryostat freezing microtome , and stored at - 80 degreesc until processing .
the per1 probe was kindly provided by prof. urs albrecht ( university of fribourg ) .
bmal1 and rev - erbalpha probes ( primers listed in supplementary table s2 ) were cloned into pgem - t easy .
all probes were synthesized in the presence of 33p - uridine triphosphate ( mp biomedicals ) .
hybridization was visualized by film autoradiography ( kodak biomax mr film ) , and od determined using 3 - 4 sections per mouse , and 5 mice per time - point / group .
quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) and western blot analysis peripheral tissues were rapidly dissected , snap frozen , and stored at - 80 degreesc until use .
hypothalamic blocks were micro - dissected from 300 mum coronal brain slices .
rna extraction and qpcr was performed as previously described38 ( qpcr primers listed in supplementary table s2 ) .
for protein extraction , frozen tissues were homogenised in tissue - protein extraction reagent ( peirce ) containing protease inhibitor cocktail ( roche ) and 1 mm pmsf .
protein levels were determined by sds - page and western blot analysis using anti - ppargamma ( c26h12 , cell signalling , 1:500 ) and anti - gapdh ( fl - 335 , santa cruz biotechnology , 1:1000 ) antibodies .
bioluminescence recording for ex vivo analyses of circadian rhythms , 8 week old male mper2 : luc mice were fed hfd or nc for 16 weeks .
mper2 - dependent bioluminescence was recorded from gwat samples maintained at 37 degreesc using a lumicycle ( actimetrics ) as described previously33 .
amplitude and phase of the second peak post - culture was determined for each animal ( n = 4 mice / condition ; 16 samples / mouse ) .
to determine the effect of pf - 5006739 on mper2 : : luc expression , cultured gwat were treated with vehicle ( water ) or pf - 5006739 ( 0.08 - 50 mum ) , 5d post - culture .
amplitude was measured at the first peak post - treatment using lumicycle recording , or bioluminescence pre - and 12 hr post - treatment using a glomax - multi luminometer ( promega ) .
statistical analysis data are presented as mean +/ - standard error ( sem ) .
students' t - test was used when two groups were tested , one - way anova with dunnett 's multiple comparisons or two - way anova followed by sidak post - hoc analyses were used when more than two groups and / or factors were analysed .
statistical determination of acrophase was performed by linear harmonic regression using circwave v1.4 software39 .
results behavioural rhythmicity in obese mice to assess the impact of diet - induced obesity ( dio ) on behavioural and physiological rhythms , adult male c57bl / 6j mice were maintained on nc or hfd ( 60 % energy from fat ) for 16wk , leading to pronounced weight gain and wat accumulation ( supplementary fig. s1 ) .
diurnal rhythms in locomotor activity and body temperature ( tb ) were maintained in hfd - fed and control mice throughout the 16wk study ( fig. 1a - c ) .
however , a reduction in the amplitude of activity and tb between light - dark periods was observed in the obese mice , due principally to a reduction in night - time activity and increased day - time tb. assessment of metabolic gas exchange at the end of the study period ( 16wk hfd ) showed a significant reduction in overall rates of oxygen consumption ( vo2 , l / kg / h ) and increased rates of energy consumption ( kcal / h ) in dio mice ( fig. 1d ) .
in line with activity and tb measures , diurnal rhythmicity in metabolic gas exchange was maintained , but with a significant reduction in diurnal amplitude .
increased daytime feeding is commonly reported in hfd - fed mice , and we therefore assessed diurnal feeding structure in mice fed nc or hfd .
the proportion of calories consumed during the light phase of the cycle was increased upon hfd feeding ( supplementary fig. s1 ) .
however , this reflected a decrease in food intake during the dark phase , in terms of overall consumption and meal frequency , rather than increased feeding in the day ( fig. 1e,f ) .
notably , altered nocturnal feeding was observed within days of the mice being placed on hfd ( supplementary fig. s1 ) , likely reflecting a homeostatic response to the increased calorific and fat content of the diet , rather than an obesity - dependent modulation of circadian feeding rhythms .
although these studies demonstrate that diet - induced obesity did not overtly disrupt diurnal rhythmicity in the mice or their ability to entrain to the ld cycle , the relative amplitudes of physiological measures were reduced in hfd - fed mice when compared to nc - fed controls .
disruption of the molecular clockwork in response to obesity we next assessed the impact of obesity on clock gene rhythms in a panel of central and peripheral tissues collected from mice fed hfd or nc for 16 weeks .
gene expression analyses of micro - dissected hypothalamic blocks did not reveal any significant alteration in expression of the core clock genes bmal1 , clock , per1 , per2 , cry1 , rev - erbalpha and rev - erbbeta ( fig. 2a ) .
as these blocks contain a number of oscillatory sites aside from the scn ( e.g. arcuate and dorsomedial nuclei ) , we employed in situ hybridisation to assess clock gene rhythms in the scn .
in situ hybridization analyses revealed a significant damping of bmal1 expression in the scn of dio mice when compared to matched nc - fed controls ( fig. 2b ) .
scn expression of bmal1 remained rhythmic in the dio mice , yet exhibited a reduced level of expression relative to nc - fed mice at all time - points and reduced amplitude overall .
despite the damping of bmal1 expression , per1 and rev - erbalpha expression within the scn was similar between dio and control mice , although both genes exhibited a small advance in acrophase within the dio mice ( fig. 2a , supplementary fig. s2 ) .
in peripheral tissues , analysis of circadian clock gene expression in hfd - and nc - fed mice revealed that robust rhythms were maintained in most tissues examined ( fig. 3 , supplementary fig. s2 ) .
however , a pronounced alteration of clock gene expression was observed in perigonadal wat ( gwat ) .
interestingly , clock gene expression was relatively unaffected in scwat of obese mice , suggesting that reduced amplitude in gwat was not due simply to increased expansion and triglyceride storage within the adipose tissues .
the differential impact of obesity on clock gene expression in the gonadal and subcutaneous adipose depots was most pronounced in rev - erbalpha , per1 and per2 gene expression profiles .
the damping of gwat rhythms in response to chronic hfd - feeding was maintained ex vivo , in tissue explants derived from 16wk hfd - fed mper2 : : luciferase reporter mice , when compared to tissue derived from nc - fed matched controls ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
in addition to damping of gwat clock gene expression , evidence of altered phase alignment between tissue clocks was also observed in hfd - fed mice .
specifically , a phase advance of transcriptional rhythms was observed in the liver and adrenal gland of hfd - fed mice (~ 2.0 h phase advance in hfd relative to nc - fed , based on acrophase of the 8 clock genes profiled ; supplementary table s3 ) , but not other tissues such as skeletal muscle and bat , indicating reduced synchrony among tissue oscillators .
throughout the peripheral tissue panel , the most profoundly and consistently affected transcript was rev - erbalpha , which showed no significant time of day difference in expression across the circadian cycle in gwat of hfd - fed mice ( fig. 3 ) .
interestingly , we did not observe a similar effect in the related gene , rev - erbbeta , which was largely unaffected by hfd feeding across the eight peripheral tissues examined in this study ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
this highlights the differential regulation of the two related nuclear hormone receptors .
overall , these studies demonstrate a pronounced effect of chronic hfd feeding on expression and synchrony of the molecular clockwork , and highlight the gene - and tissue - specificity of these effects .
gwat clock damping associated with reprograming of clock - metabolic regulators to further assess the impact of hfd - feeding on clock gene expression , mice were maintained on nc or hfd for 2 , 8 , or 16 wk ( fig. 4a - c , supplementary fig. s3 ) .
importantly , damping of bmal1 and rev - erbalpha expression in gwat was not observed following 2wk of hfd - feeding , and was most pronounced in mice that had been maintained on hfd for 16wk ( fig. 4a ) .
therefore , damping of clock gene rhythms in gwat of obese mice was not due to an acute effect of the diet .
in animals and humans , obesity - related insulin resistance has been linked to increased immune cell infiltration and pro - inflammatory cytokine production within hypertrophic wat40 .
we therefore profiled pro - inflammatory markers in the tissues of nc and hfd - fed mice .
a profound elevation of gwat inflammation was observed in 16wk hfd - fed mice compared with matched mice fed nc , and those fed hfd for 2wk or 8wk ( fig. 4b ) .
at 16wk of hfd - feeding , expressions of the pro - inflammatory cytokines ccl2 and tnfalpha , as well as the macrophage marker f4 / 80 were most profoundly elevated in gwat ( supplementary fig. s3 ) , suggesting that clock gene damping within this tissue may be linked to the development of obesity - related inflammation .
components of the circadian clock are also closely and reciprocally linked with the metabolic regulators , pparalpha and ppargamma51941 .
we therefore examined tissue - specific and temporal dynamics of pparalpha / gamma expression in mice maintained on hfd ( fig. 4c - f ) .
similar to the attenuation of clock gene rhythms , a significant reduction in pparalpha / gamma expressions were observed in gwat of mice maintained on hfd for 16wk ( but not 2wk or 8wk ; fig. 4c ) .
obesity - related changes in pparalpha and ppargamma expression were highly tissue specific , with the expressions of both receptors significantly increased in the liver , yet profoundly attenuated in gwat of obese mice when compared with matched nc - fed controls ( fig. 4d ) .
in contrast to gwat , pparalpha and ppargamma expressions were not reduced in scwat ( fig. 4d ) .
tissue - specific changes in ppargamma mrna expression in liver and gwat were mirrored in ppargamma protein expression ( fig. 4e,f ) , as well as in ppargamma target genes including adipoq and fabp4 ( fig. 4c , supplementary fig. s3 ) , and genes involved in lipid metabolism known to be under circadian control ( supplementary fig. s3 ) .
these studies reveal a pronounced tissue - specific nature of obesity - related clock dysfunction , with gwat being particularly affected .
however , our findings also highlight the fact that damping of the clock in gwat is accompanied ( in terms of duration of hfd - feeding and tissue - specificity ) by elevated tissue inflammation and altered pparalpha / gamma expression .
targeting of the clock by ck1delta / epsilon inhibition we have previously shown that daily administration of ck1delta / epsilon inhibitors can be effective at increasing the amplitude of disrupted and weak oscillators33 .
we therefore assessed whether this approach would be effective in dio mice using a novel ck1delta / epsilon inhibitor ( pf - 5006739 ) , which exhibits improved target selectivity over previous compounds36 .
the impact of ck1delta / epsilon inhibition on damped rhythms was first examined using gwat tissue cultures derived from mper2 : luc mice which had been maintained on nc or hfd for 16wk ( fig. 5a,b ) .
wat tissue explants were maintained in culture for 5 days , and then treated with vehicle or pf - 5006739 ( 0.4 - 50 um ) .
in gwat tissue derived from either nc or hfd - fed mice , pf - 5006739 administration caused a rapid and dose - dependent induction of mper2 : : luc bioluminescence ( fig. 5a,b ) .
we next tested whether pharmacological targeting of ck1delta / epsilon could provide a metabolic benefit in vivo in models of obesity .
dio mice ( 16wk hfd - feeding ) were treated once daily at zt10 with pf - 5006739 ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
dose and timing of administration were based on prior characterisation of the compound36 .
following 3 weeks of treatment , no significant impact of pf - 5006739 was observed in nc or hfd - fed mice ( relative to vehicle - treated mice for the same diet group ) with respect to body weight , food intake , day / night feeding behaviour , or diurnal activity profile ( fig. 5c , supplementary fig. s4 ) .
however , daily administration of the ck1delta / epsilon inhibitor did lead to a significant improvement in glucose tolerance in response to bolus glucose challenge ( glucose tolerance test ; gtt ) ( n = 7 / group ; fig. 5c ) .
damping of circadian gene rhythms in peripheral tissues has been reported in leptin - deficient ob / ob mice30 , a genetic model of obesity .
we therefore tested the ability of pf - 5006739 administration to improve glucose tolerance in this model .
similar to studies in dio mice , pf - 5006739 treatment ( 10 mg / kg / day , zt10 ) did not affect body weight , feeding behaviour , or activity profiles in ob / ob mice , relative to vehicle - treated ob / ob mice ( fig. 5d , supplementary fig. s4 ) .
yet once again , daily administration of pf - 5006739 significantly improved blood glucose profiles during gtt ( fig. 5d ) .
no difference in glucose clearance was observed in lean ( nc - fed ) c57bl / 6j mice treated with pf - 5006739 relative to vehicle - treated mice ( supplementary fig. s4 ) .
taken together these studies highlight the potential benefits of targeting ck1delta / epsilon to improve glucose homeostasis in obesity .
discussion the studies detailed here contribute to the growing evidence that the molecular clockwork is compromised during obesity .
our studies highlight obesity - related desynchrony and a pronounced disruption of the circadian clockwork in visceral wat .
attenuated clock gene rhythms in gwat were not due to altered nutritional input ( i.e. acute consumption of hfd ) , but were associated with chronic hfd - feeding and dysregulation of pparalpha / gamma .
further , we show that pharmacological targeting of ck1delta / epsilon , potent modulators of the molecular clock , was effective in improving glucose tolerance in both diet - induced and genetic models of obesity .
the impact of hfd feeding on circadian rhythms in behaviour , as well as clock gene expression in central and peripheral tissues has been examined in a number of studies ( e.g.52526272829303132 ) .
however , the extent to which hfd - feeding impacts the circadian system varies between these reports .
these discrepancies are perhaps not unexpected , as we have shown here that the duration of hfd feeding has a significant impact , and that alterations to the phase and amplitude of peripheral clock gene expression are tissue and gene specific .
here , across two large independent studies , we reveal clear evidence of both damped rhythms ( most notably in gwat , and bmal1 expression in the scn ) , and tissue desynchrony ( i.e. advanced rhythms in liver and adrenal gland , but not in muscle , bat and scwat ) which appear in response to long - term hfd - feeding in dio mice .
our studies also highlight the damping of numerous physiological rhythms ( tb , calorie intake , locomotor activity , vo2 ) across the diurnal cycle in the hfd - fed mice , as well as a significantly damping of circadian expression of bmal1 within the scn .
we have not established whether damped bmal1 expression in the scn contributes directly to the damping of physiological rhythms , but it does demonstrate a clear impact of hfd - feeding on the master circadian clock .
moreover , timing of food intake , temperature , and activity are well - established and potent entrainment cues for peripheral tissue clocks ; thus , the reduced amplitude of physiological rhythms ( tb , activity ) and hfd - induced shift in calorie intake towards the inactive phase of the cycle represents a pronounced damping of these internal zeitgebers in the obese animals .
advancement of hepatic clock gene rhythms has been reported previously in hfd - fed mice , in response to acute changes in diet composition3142 , suggesting desynchrony may not be due to obesity per se but rather in response to altered dietary intake .
an interesting difference in the susceptibility of visceral and scwat clocks to obesity - related dysfunction was observed in our studies .
this has been suggested in a previous study , although no data was provided32 .
adipose depot specific differences in the response of the circadian clock to obesity has also been reflected in human studies4344 .
in line with previous work293145 , the expressions of pparalpha and ppargamma were significantly altered in the mice by high fat diet feeding .
our studies highlight the association ( in terms of timing and tissue - specificity ) of obesity - related clock gene disruption with altered pparalpha and ppargamma expression and local tissue inflammation .
expression of pparalpha and ppargamma are influenced by the clock , but both receptors also regulate directly the expression of clock components ; most notably , rev - erbalpha is a well established target of ppargamma12122 .
here , wat depot - specific differences in pparalpha and ppargamma expression in response to dio exhibit a similar profile to rev - erbalpha expression in those tissues , suggesting that alterations in ppar and clock gene expression observed in the obese mice may be directly linked .
interestingly , inducible deletion of ppargamma in adult mice46 leads to a significant damping of per1 and rev - erbalpha , but not per2 or cry1 within adipose tissue ; a gene specificity similar to that observed in the gwat of the obese mice in our studies .
the significant role of pparalpha and ppargamma in circadian and metabolic adaption of the liver transcriptome in response to altered diet and timing of food intake has been clearly demonstrated243147 .
for example , hfd - feeding induced expression of ppargamma in the liver orchestrates a dramatic reorganisation of rhythmic expression of metabolic genes31 .
therefore , the pronounced tissue - specific ( e.g. liver vs gwat ) change in pparalpha and ppargamma expression observed here in the dio mice suggests an alteration of transcriptional rhythmicity across metabolic tissues , which reflect a more profound temporal desynchrony than indicated by the clock gene expression .
the detrimental impact of clock disruption on energy homeostasis and insulin signalling is evident in both animal and human studies348 .
for example , increased susceptibility to diet - induced obesity , altered insulin signalling , hyperglycemia and / or glucose intolerance have been reported in a number of clock gene mutant or knockout mouse lines ( e.g.54149 ) .
in humans , desynchrony studies demonstrate that misalignment of internal clock rhythms from behavioural routine leads to disrupted glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity6950 .
these studies implicate a role for circadian disruption and desynchrony in the metabolic disturbances associated with obesity , and suggest that strengthening of the clock can confer benefit .
indeed , pharmacological targeting of rev - erb has been shown to reduce adiposity and improve glucose tolerance in obese mice51 .
here , we demonstrate that daily administration of pf - 5006739 similarly improves glucose tolerance .
although we did not profile circadian clock gene expression across the cycle in drug - treated mice in the current study , we have previously shown that ck1delta / epsilon inhibition can increase the amplitude of disrupted scn rhythms in vitro and establish consolidated behavioural activity rhythms in otherwise arrhythmic mice33 .
similarly , in the current study , pf - 5006739 enhanced mper2 : : luc bioluminescence in damped adipose tissue explants .
further , altered glucose profiles were not observed in nc - fed mice treated with pf - 5006739 , and gtt studies were conducted well beyond the in vivo clearance time of the drug36 .
this suggests that it is a chronic effect of daily pf - 5006739 administration ( for example via enhanced clock entrainment ) , rather than a direct effect of ck1delta / epsilon inhibition per se that led to improved glucose tolerance in the obese mice .
we suggest that daily targeting of the clock via ck1delta / epsilon inhibition in the obese mice underlies the improved glucose tolerance in the animals .
nevertheless , ck1delta and epsilon are known to regulate a variety of cellular processes outside of the circadian clock52 , and therefore involvement of non - circadian pathways in mediating pf - 5006739 improved glucose tolerance must also be considered .
for example , previous work has implicated ck1delta in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis via pgc - 1alpha phosphorylation53 , and glucose uptake into cultured adipocytes54 .
in summary , this work highlights the tissue - and gene - specific clock disruption that accompanies diet - induced obesity .
importantly , daily administration of a highly selective ck1epsilon / delta inhibitor , which was effective at enhancing clock gene expression , led to an improved glucose tolerance in dio and ob / ob mice .
these studies provide further evidence of the widespread effects of high fat diet on the molecular clockwork , and reinforce the circadian clock as a novel avenue to achieve benefit in metabolic diseases , including obesity and type 2 diabetes .

figure 1 behavioural rhythmicity in diet - induced obese mice .
( a - c ) robust diurnal rhythms of locomotor activity ( a,b ) and body temperature ( tb ; a,c were maintained in nc and hfd - fed mice throughout the study ( n = 7 / group ) ; although a reduction in night - time activity was observed in the hfd - fed mice ( b ) .
( d ) indirect calorimetry revealed an obesity - related decrease in oxygen consumption ( vo2 , relative to body weight ) and increase in energy consumption ( kcal / hr / mouse ) .
a significant reduction in day - night amplitude was evident in vo2 profiles of hfd - fed mice .
( e,f ) analysis of feeding behaviour revealed a significant reduction in food intake ( e ) and feeding events ( f ) in hfd - fed mice specifically during the dark phase of the cycle .
individual meal size was unaffected by hfd feeding .
data reflect mean +/ - sem ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 ; ( b,c,f ) two - way anova with sidak post hoc test , ( e ) repeated - measures two - way anova and ( d ) student 's t - test .
figure 2 impact of diet induced obesity on hypothalamic clock gene expression .
( a ) analyses of gene expression in microdissected hypothalamic tissue revealed that rhythmic expression of clock genes was largely unaffected by long term hfd feeding ( n = 5 / diet / time - point ) .
( b ) however , analyses of the scn by in situ hybridisation revealed a significant damping of bmal1 expression in dio mice ( n = 5mice / diet / time - point with 3 - 4 scn sections / mouse ; representative autoradiograph images shown ) .
per1 and rev - erbalpha rhythms in the scn of dio mice were advanced in phase relative to nc - fed mice , but showed no evidence of damped expression .
* indicates a significant difference between nc and hfd profiles ( p < 0.01 , two - way anova with sidak post hoc test ) at one or more time - points .
data reflect mean +/ - sem .
samples were collected under dd , and therefore the grey bar on the x - axes represents subjective day .
figure 3 tissue - specific disruption of the molecular clock in obese mice in peripheral tissues .
clock gene expression profiles in peripheral tissues were compared between mice fed nc or hfd for 16wk ( n = 5 / diet / time - point ) .
differences in gene expression were observed at a number of individual time - points .
for clarity , * indicates a significant difference between nc and hfd profiles ( p < 0.01 , two - way anova with sidak post hoc test ) at one or more time - points within a specific tissue profile .
the amplitude of clock gene expression was largely unaffected by long term hfd feeding in all tissues except for gwat , where a significant attenuation of bmal1 , per2 , cry1 , rev - erbalpha and dbp expression was observed .
advanced gene rhythms were observed in the liver and adrenal gland .
additional gene profiles and acrophase analyses are shown in supplementary fig. s2 and table s3 .
data reflect mean +/ - sem .
samples were collected under dd , and grey bar on the x - axes represents subjective day .
figure 4 chronic hfd feeding is associated with adipose tissue inflammation and alteration in ppar expression .
( a ) damping of clock gene expression in gwat was associated with long - term hfd - feeding ( 16wk ) , rather than an acute response to 2wk or 8wk of hfd ( n = 5 - 6 / group ) .
( b ) assessment of inflammatory gene expression following 2 , 8 and 16wk of hfd - feeding revealed that development of inflammation in gwat was most pronounced following 16wk hfd feeding .
( c ) similarly , attenuated expressions of the metabolic regulators ppargamma , pparalpha , and the ppargamma - regulated gene adipoq was observed following 16 weeks on hfd , but not after 2 or 8 weeks .
( d ) at 16wk , obesity - related alteration in ppargamma and pparalpha expression was highly tissue specific .
both receptors exhibited increased expression in the liver , yet profoundly attenuated expression in gwat of hfd - fed mice compared to matched wt mice ( n = 5 / diet / time - point ) .
( e ) similarly , ppargamma protein expression exhibited a dramatic and tissue - specific response to long - term hfd feeding ( liver n = 3 / group , gwat n = 6 / group ) .
data expressed as mean +/ - sem ; ( a - c,e ) two way anova with sidak post hoc test ; * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 ; ( d ) * indicates a significant difference between diets at one or more time - points ; p < 0.01 , two - way anova with sidak post hoc .
figure 5 pharmacological targeting of the clock via pf - 5006739 improves glucose tolerance .
( a ) representative recordings of mper2 : : luc driven bioluminescence from gwat explants , where treatment of tissue with pf - 5006739 ( 0.4 mum , arrow ) caused a rapid and robust induction of bioluminescence .
( b ) the induction of gwat mper2 : : luc bioluminescence by pf - 5006739 was dose - dependent and effective in tissues derived from nc and hfd - fed mice .
data reflects the change in mper2 : : luc bioluminescence from time of treatment to 12 hr post - pf - 5006739 application ( n = 4 / diet / dose ) .
( c,d ) daily dosing with pf - 5006739 ( 10 mg / kg / day , at zt10 ) was performed in dio mice ( c , n = 13 / group ) and ob / ob mice ( d , n = 10 / group ) .
treatment with vehicle ( vc ) or pf - 5006739 ( pf ) did not alter body weight or food intake in the mice .
however , a significant improvement in glucose tolerance was observed in both dio and ob / ob mice treated with pf - 5006739 when compared with vehicle treated mice ( gtt , n = 7 / group ) .
data reflect mean +/ - sem ; ( b ) * p < 0.05 vs nc 0 mum , # p < 0.05 vs hfd 0 mum ; two - way anova with dunnett 's multiple comparisons vs 0 mum .
( c,d ) * p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , repeated measures one - way anova ( gtt profile ) and student 's t - test ( area under the curve ; auc ) .

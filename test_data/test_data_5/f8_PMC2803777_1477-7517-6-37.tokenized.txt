background injections of mixtures prepared from crushed tablets contain insoluble particles which can cause embolisms and other complications .
although many particles can be removed by filtration , many injecting drug users do not filter due to availability , cost or performance of filters , and also due to concerns that some of the dose will be lost .
methods injection solutions were prepared from slow - release morphine tablets ( ms contin ( r )) replicating methods used by injecting drug users .
contaminating particles were counted by microscopy and morphine content analysed by liquid chromatography before and after filtration .
results unfiltered tablet extracts contained tens of millions of particles with a range in sizes from < 5 mum to > 400 mum .
cigarette filters removed most of the larger particles (> 50 mum ) but the smaller particles remained .
commercial syringe filters ( 0.45 and 0.22 mum ) produced a dramatic reduction in particles but tended to block unless used after a cigarette filter .
morphine was retained by all filters but could be recovered by following the filtration with one or two 1 ml washes .
the combined use of a cigarette filter then 0.22 mum filter , with rinses , enabled recovery of 90 % of the extracted morphine in a solution which was essentially free of tablet - derived particles .
conclusions apart from overdose and addiction itself , the harmful consequences of injecting morphine tablets come from the insoluble particles from the tablets and microbial contamination .
these harmful components can be substantially reduced by passing the injection through a sterilizing ( 0.22 mum ) filter .
to prevent the filter from blocking , a preliminary coarse filter ( such as a cigarette filter ) should be used first .
the filters retain some of the dose , but this can be recovered by following filtration with one or two rinses with 1 ml water .
although filtration can reduce the non - pharmacological harmful consequences of injecting tablets , this remains an unsafe practice due to skin and environmental contamination by particles and microorganisms , and the risks of blood - borne infections from sharing injecting equipment .
background it is common for many injecting drug users to prepare injections from tablets that are designed for oral administration [ 1,2 ] .
tablets contain therapeutically inactive ingredients to facilitate the lubrication , disintegration and dissolution of the dosage form [ 3 ] .
these ingredients include talc , cornstarch , cellulose , magnesium stearate and waxes , which are not water soluble and their injection can cause complications .
after injection into any blood vessel , particles will move downstream until they encounter a vessel too small to pass , where they lodge forming an embolism .
blockage of a vessel causes ischemic damage through a reduction in blood supply to the tissue downstream and can result in necrosis of the distal tissue .
for example , injection of particles into a peripheral vein can lead to pulmonary granulomas , pulmonary oedema , emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension [ 4,5 ] .
smaller particles (< 3 - 4 mum ) can pass through capillaries and remain in the circulation until sequestered by the mononuclear phagocytic system , mainly in the liver and spleen [ 6 ] .
intra - arterial injection , whether deliberate or accidental , can impair blood supply to a limb and cause severe tissue ischemia and necrosis , leading to amputation [ 7 ] .
adverse reactions to illicit drug injections are commonly aggravated by infections due to the non - sterile methods of preparation and injection procedures .
this is seen with local skin and soft tissue infections , which are the most common cause of hospital admissions of injecting drug users [ 8 ] .
filterable contaminants in drug injections contribute to many other cardiovascular and infectious complications [ 9,10 ] .
although appropriate syringe filters can remove particles from solutions for injection , their use has not become routine amongst injecting drug users .
while there are many factors contributing to this , including cost , availability and performance of syringe filters , one substantial reason is the concern of many drug users that some of the drug would be lost in filtration .
the current study was designed to replicate preparation and filtration methods used by injecting drug users for injection of slow - release oral morphine tablets ( ms contin ( r ) , also known as mst continus ( r ) in some other countries ) .
this was selected as injection of morphine tablets was reported as the last drug injected by 15 % of the 2270 injecting drug users interviewed in the national 2008 australian needle and syringe program study [ 11 ] and as injected in the past six months by 47 % of the 909 frequent injecting drug users interviewed nationally in the 2008 illicit drug reporting system study [ 12 ] .
ms contin is the morphine tablet most commonly injected [ 12 ] .
the current study aimed to compare the effectiveness of different types of commonly used filters on their ability to reduce particle content , and also their effect on amount of morphine remaining in the filtered solution .
methods procedures used by injecting drug users a survey of injecting drug users in the hobart area ( tasmania , australia ) presenting to needle and syringe distribution outlets ( n = 260 ) was conducted to determine the filtering methods they applied on their last occasion of morphine injection [ 13,14 ] .
one - third ( 29 %) had not used any filter ; 41 % used cigarette filters ( 34 % hand - rolling cigarette filters ) ; 21 % used 0.22 mum syringe filters accessed through needle and syringe outlets .
minorities reported use of 0.45 mum syringe filters ( 2 %) , cotton balls ( 3 %) , combinations of cigarette and syringe filters ( 3 %) or other makeshift filters ( such as tampons , 1 %) .
injecting drug users in the hobart area ( n = 11 ) subsequently participated in detailed interviews to describe how they prepared injections from tablets and their filtration procedures .
the methods used in this laboratory study are based on these methods .
extraction of morphine from tablets one sustained - release 60 mg tablet of morphine sulfate ( ms contin ( r ) , mundipharma , uk ) was wiped with a sterile swab containing 70 % isopropyl alcohol ( briemarpak , briemar nominees , australia ) to remove the orange coating ( replicating the process used by injecting drug users ) , then placed on a glass petri dish to dry .
the tablet was then extracted using either cold or hot water for injection bp ( pfizer , australia ) .
in the cold method , the tablet was thoroughly crushed using a glass mortar and pestle , and mixed with 3.0 ml water .
the mixture was then stood for 5 min with occasional stirring .
injecting drug users employ a variety of improvised methods , such as crushing the tablet between two spoons .
however , it was considered preferable to use a single , reproducible method in this study , although it is probably more efficient than the improvised methods and may result in fewer large particles .
the resulting drug extract was either kept for filtration , examined for particle content by light microscopy or analysed for morphine content by high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) .
the mixture was transferred into a 5 ml plastic specimen tube for particle counting or a 50 ml volumetric flask for morphine analysis .
the effect of different methods of filtration on the particle and morphine content of the extracts were also examined .
control solutions were prepared in an identical manner except that the tablet was omitted .
in the hot method of morphine extraction , the tablet was crushed by a porcelain pestle in a small ( 3 cm diameter , 4 cm high ) , round nickel crucible and the remnants adhering to the pestle were scraped into the crucible .
then 3.0 ml water were added and the crucible placed on a hot plate and gently boiled , with mixing , for 30 - 45 s by which time the mixture appeared to be clear and melted wax could be seen floating on top .
the mixture was then stood on the bench until it felt cold to touch ( about 5 min ) before further treatment as described for the cold preparations .
it is important to note that cold extraction methods are recommended by australian intravenous drug consumer groups ( network against prohibition http :// www.napnt.org / health / filtering _ pills.htm ; safer injecting net http :// www.saferinjecting.net / injecting - ms - contin.htm ) due to a perception of loss of active dose following hot extraction techniques .
filtration cigarette type filter a filter used for hand - rolled cigarettes ( ranch slims , stuart alexander & co. , australia ) was cut down the side and the encircling paper removed .
following precisely the methods reported by injecting drug consumers , the filter was placed in the drug extraction mixture and moved around with the tip of a 5 ml syringe ( luer - lok , sterile , bd medical , melbourne , australia ) until it became saturated with the liquid .
the tip of the syringe was gently pressed against the side of the filter and the mixture slowly drawn up. this was repeated at two other sites on the filter , and the filter usually became blocked before all of the liquid was drawn up. a second filter was added to enable the filtration to continue until there was no mixture left .
as described for the unfiltered extract , the filtrate was kept for further filtration , particle counting or morphine analysis .
two successive 1 ml rinses of water were added to the mortar or crucible and , after moving the filter around in the liquid , taken up into the syringe and added to the first filtrate. with the hot preparation method , each rinse volume was briefly boiled then cooled before filtration .
all containers were tared and weighed again at different stages to estimate the volumes collected .
despite the presence of tablet constituents , it was assumed that the specific gravity of all the mixtures was that of water to enable the volumes to be calculated .
aliquots of each rinse were taken for morphine analysis .
cotton ball filter a cotton ball ( home brand cotton balls , australia ) was cut into four equal parts which were rolled into smaller balls .
one small ball was placed in the drug extraction mixture and gently moved around with the tip of a 5 ml syringe to absorb the liquid .
the mixture was taken up into the syringe and treated as described for the cigarette type filter .
syringe filter ( 0.45 or 0.22 mum ) the mixture was taken up into a 5 ml syringe fitted with a 19g needle .
the needle was removed and replaced by a 0.45 or 0.22 mum sterile syringe filter ( 33 mm diameter , millex , millipore , ireland ) and the syringe contents were slowly pushed through the filter .
in some experiments the filter was flushed with a 1 ml rinse volume of water .
combined filters after initial filtration through a cigarette type filter , followed by two 1 ml rinses , the combined filtrates were taken up into a 5 ml syringe and then the needle was replaced with a 0.45 or 0.22 mum syringe filter and the syringe contents gently expelled into a container .
the filter was flushed with another 1 ml water .
analysis of particle content glass microscope slides and coverslips were cleaned in laboratory detergent ( decon 90 , decon lab. , sussex , uk ) , rinsed in tap water , distilled water and methanol , then dried in air .
in some experiments an overnight acid wash ( conc. nitric acid ) was included before the water rinses .
a 20 mul aliquot of each sample was pipetted on to a slide and covered with a 22 x 22 mm coverslip .
this volume filled the area under the coverslip .
the slides were viewed under a light microscope ( gillet and sibert , london , uk ) in transmission mode .
the eyepieces ( leitz wetzlar , germany ) had reticules which enabled particles of different sizes to be counted .
one eyepiece showed a rectangular area ( 360 x 250 mum with 20x objective ) and the other a linear scale ( 0 - 10 by 0.1 unit ) whose length was 400 mum with 20x objective .
the rectangle and scale were calibrated using the ruled lines of a neubauer blood cell counting chamber ( hawksley , london , uk ) .
thus the smallest particle that could be measured with the 20x objective was 4 mum ( 0.1 on the scale ) although smaller particles could be seen and counted .
for each sample , five fields were chosen for counting , at the four corners and centre of the coverslip , selected by moving the microscope stage without looking through the eyepiece .
particles were counted if they were inside the rectangle , or overlapped the bottom or right side , but not if they overlapped the top or left side .
particles were counted in size groups , using the scale and a factor based on the magnification of the objective to estimate size .
for example , particles 50 - 99 mum were counted with the 5x objective , and corresponded to scale readings 0.3 - 0.5 .
particles 20 - 49.9 mum were counted with the 20x objective and corresponded to scale readings 0.5 - 1.24 .
clearly this level of precision was not possible , and borderline particles could have been assigned to either of two adjacent groups .
total particles in each size group were estimated from the average count per field multiplied by the ratio of field area / coverslip area (= number of particles in 20 mul ) , then by the ratio of the volume of the injection ( ml )/ 0.02 ml to give the number of particles in the injection mixture .
counts are given as mean +/ - sd of three replicate preparations .
photomicrographs of slides were taken with an olympus bx50 microscope fitted with an olympus dp50 digital camera .
analysis of morphine content the tablet extract or its filtrate was made to volume ( 50 ml ) with 0.5 % acetic acid .
about 5 ml was filtered through a syringe filter consisting of a nylon prefilter and 0.45 mum filter ( chromacol , uk ) .
this step was required to remove particles before hplc analysis .
the relatively large volume and acidic ph was expected to maximise the dissolution of any morphine that remained in the particles , and to minimise any retention by the filter .
an aliquot of this filtrate was diluted ten - fold and analysed , in duplicate , by hplc using a varian 9010 instrument ( varian , australia ) , a c18 reversed - phase column and uv detection at 286 nm. the mobile phase was 90 % phosphate buffer ( 50 mm , ph 3 ) and 10 % methanol , and flow rate 0.7 ml / min .
injections were made using a 20 mul loop .
standard solutions were prepared from morphine sulfate bp ( british drug houses , london , uk ) and there was no internal standard .
the retention time of morphine was 4.2 min .
calibration curves from 2.5 - 200 mug / ml were prepared each day and linearity was excellent ( r2 > 0.99 ) .
as the morphine content of the tablets is given in mg morphine sulfate , we have done the same with the morphine recovered from the tablets .
results cold extraction , unfiltered the outer coating was readily removed with an alcohol swab and the tablet crushed easily although continued grinding did not result in an ever - finer powder since the waxy nature of the powder resulted in some re - compaction .
the crushed tablet suspended in cold water gave an opaque suspension with a milky appearance ( figure 1 ) .
macroscopic particles were evident on the wall of the tube .
the mean morphine content ( as morphine sulfate ) was 56 +/ - 2 mg from 60 mg tablets ( table 1 ) .
microscopic examination showed many particles ranging in size from > 400 mum to < 5 mum ( figure 2a ) .
particles were not uniformly distributed across the coverslip area .
most of the fields counted were crowded and heterogeneous , making it difficult to count every particle , and the fields were usually dissimilar .
the larger particles (> 50 mum ) tended to be amorphous in shape and to some extent appeared to be agglomerations of smaller particles ( figure 2b ) .
in counting the particles , the size group was taken to be that of the agglomeration , regardless of how friable it appeared .
thus the assignment of particles to size categories was based on a subjective judgement of whether they appeared to be separate or joined .
small particles (< 5 - 10 mum ) sometimes drifted across the field , and had to be counted quickly while they remained in view .
however , some particles would have been missed .
the smallest particles (< 5 mum ) were generally too numerous to count accurately , and their counts represent a minimum number .

* this figure provides a comparison of the amount of morphine recovered through use of the target filter to that recovered through use of a cigarette filter .
comparisons were made by mann - whitney u test ( a non - parametric analogue of the t - test ) , 2 - tailed .
results are consistent with parametric analysis with games - howell post - hoc tests with the exception of + 0.45 mum filters ( p < 0.05 ) .
p values greater than 0.05 suggest that it is unlikely that there is any real difference between the amount of morphine recovered in the two compared techniques .
in some preparations regular crystalline shapes were seen , with sizes ranging from rectangles of 10 mum x 25 mum , to rods of 1 - 2 mum x 5 - 10 mum ( figure 2c and 2d ) .
treatment with weak acid ( 0.5 % acetic acid ) dissolved the crystals .
this , together with their shape , and the absence of other likely candidates in the tablet formulation , suggested that the crystals were morphine hydrate , which precipitated because of the alkalinity of the glass .
this was confirmed by examining an extract which gave abundant crystals on the standard glass slides .
the same extract gave no crystals on either glass slides which had been soaked overnight in nitric acid , or plastic slides .
because their formation was considered to be artifactual , the crystals were not included in the particle count .
all slides were examined when freshly - prepared as crystal formation increased with time on the slide .
a solution of morphine sulfate 60 mg in 3 ml water for injection had a ph of 4.6 .
an aliquot ( 50 mul ) was mixed with an equal volume of 50 mm naoh , resulting in the formation of masses of small rods of the same appearance as those found in the tablet extracts .
the cold unfiltered tablet mixture had a ph of 6.4 , which was unchanged after filtration through the cigarette filter or 0.45 mum or 0.22 mum filters .
figure 3 shows the number of particles sized 5 mum and larger in the total injection volume for three preparations : control ( no tablet ) , cold extraction and hot extraction .
figure 4 shows the additional particles in the smallest size group (< 5 mum ) of the same preparations , plotted separately because their counts were an order of magnitude greater than for the larger particles .
the upper panel of figure 3 shows the particle counts in unfiltered preparations .
even in the absence of a crushed tablet , some small ( up to 20 mum ) particles were found ( control : unfiltered ) , reflecting contamination from the local environment .
the unfiltered cold tablet extract produced a much larger number of particles of all sizes , with the numbers tending to increase as the size became smaller ( figure 3 , cold : unfiltered ) .
although not apparent in figure 3 , there were also significant numbers of particles in the largest size group (> 400 mum ) , 12,000 +/ - 14,000 in the 3 ml injection volume .
the large sd shows the inherent variability of the particle counts .

the unfiltered extracts were passed successively through a cigarette filter then a syringe filter ( 0.45 mum or 0.22 mum ) .
values are mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
cold extraction , filtered two cigarette filters were required to enable the mixture to be taken into a syringe without the filter being blocked .
the filtrate was milky , like the unfiltered mixture , but it was also more translucent and there were fewer particles on the wall of the tube ( figure 1 ) .
only about half ( 1.7 ml ) of the 3 ml water used to prepare the mixture could be recovered , with the remaining liquid remaining in the wet filters ( table 1 ) .
the mean morphine content of the filtrate was 32 mg , which is the amount expected to be in this fraction ( 1.7 / 3.0 ) of the total volume of extract .
this indicates that the morphine was not binding to the filter , but was being retained because some of the solution was held up in the filter .
two successive 1 ml rinses with water recovered most of the remaining morphine ( table 1 ) .
some large particles escaped this filtration ( figure 5a ) , and there were large numbers of smaller particles and crystals ( figure 5b ) .
the cigarette filter produced a large reduction ( 60 - 80 %) in numbers of particles > 50 mum , a smaller reduction ( 10 - 20 %) in particles sized 10 - 50 mum , and an increase ( 20 - 40 %) in the number of smaller particles (< 10 mum ; figures 3 and 4 ) .
figure 5 particles in cigarette filtrate ( cold extraction ) .
photomicrographs of particles from a single preparation .
the cotton ball filter gave a similar result to the cigarette filter : a milky filtrate with limited removal of particles ( data not shown ) .
however , the recovery of morphine may have been slightly lower ( table 1 ) .
also , it was difficult to consistently reproduce the size and density of the filters .
the 0.45 mum syringe filter gave a clear solution ( figure 1 ) , but the filter tended to block and it required considerable pressure to deliver the last of the filtrate .
additionally , the volume of filtrate was low ( 1.9 ml ) , containing only 34 mg morphine .
however , this was the amount expected for the fraction of mixture which was filtered .
the filtrate was relatively particle - free , and this will be described under the combination filtration procedure .
hot extraction , unfiltered the tablet could only be coarsely crushed in the crucible , but everything melted or went into solution when the water was boiled .
care was taken to minimise evaporative water loss , since this tended to increase crystal formation .
on cooling , the mixture became turbid and some large waxy solids separated .
the largest masses were not taken up into the syringe and were therefore not included in the particle count .
the aspirated mixture had a milky appearance , similar to that produced by cold extraction .
the morphine extraction ( 59 +/ - 1 mg , table 2 ) was virtually complete .
microscopic examination showed that , compared to cold extraction , there were fewer particles sized 10 mum or larger , and more sized less than 10 mum ( figures 3 and 4 ) .
however , the injection still contained an average 50,000 particles in each of the size groups 50 - 99 mum and > 100 mum .
figure 6a shows a field with one very large particle (> 400 mum ) and many smaller particles , and panel b shows what appear to be solidified droplets of melted wax .
the microscopic appearance of hot extractions was characterised by droplets , particles , and crystals ( figure 6a and 6d ) .
the larger droplets had inclusions , either particles or other droplets .
the formation of many small droplets contributed to the large number of small particles present .

hot extraction , filtered aspiration through a cigarette filter removed all of the largest particles (> 100 mum ) but only 10 - 50 % of the smaller particles ( figures 3 and 4 ) .
in preliminary experiments it was found that , if the mixture was still warm , many more of the wax droplets passed through the filter .
as with the cold preparation , nearly all of the dose could be recovered after 2 x 1 ml rinses with water ( table 2 ) .
filtration through cotton wool balls gave no better recovery of morphine ( table 2 ) and , because of the variability in forming these filters , was not further considered .
the 0.45 mum syringe filter again gave a clear solution with recovery of 41 mg morphine , which increased to 52 mg after a 1 ml rinse ( table 1 ) .
the particle count is described after combination filtration .
combination filtration fresh extracts were prepared using cold and hot water and passed sequentially through a cigarette filter then syringe filter ( 0.45 mum or 0.22 mum ) , with rinses .
after both cold and hot extraction with cigarette filtration , the subsequent syringe filtration step did not significantly reduce the recovery of morphine ( tables 1 and 2 ) .
both syringe filters greatly reduced the particle count , to levels at or below the control counts ( figures 7 and 4 ) .
in some samples ( e.g. 0.45 mum filtrate after hot extraction ) there appeared to be large numbers of small (< 5 mum ) particles or droplets .
however , this will require confirmation by re - investigation using cleaner conditions .

discussion morphine in the ms contin ( r ) slow - release tablet is embedded in a complex dual matrix of hydroxyethyl cellulose and cetostearyl alcohol , designed to release the drug over 12 h [ 15 ] .
crushing the tablet disrupts this matrix , allowing the rapid extraction of morphine .
the amount of morphine in prolonged - release tablets is permitted to vary by 5 % [ 16 ] so a 60 mg tablet could contain from 57 to 63 mg morphine sulfate .
the extraction of morphine by cold water ( 56 mg ) and hot water ( 59 mg ) was therefore essentially complete .
none of the filters bound morphine , and their retention of morphine was due to the volume of liquid which remained .
consequently , rinsing the filters increased the recovery of morphine .
repeated rinses brought diminishing recoveries of morphine , and increased the volume to be injected , and therefore the number of rinses used in the combined filtration method was a minimized but nevertheless gave a good recovery ( 84 - 93 %) of the extracted morphine .
overall , the extraction of morphine and its recovery after filtration was similar after cold and hot extraction .
the ms contin ( r ) tablet contains a number of constituents with low or no water solubility which are liable to produce particles in the extract [ 17 ] .
these include cetostearyl alcohol , which is a mixture of two waxes : cetyl alcohol ( 1 - hexadecanol , mp 49degreesc ) and stearyl alcohol ( 1 - octadecanol , mp 61degreesc ) ; magnesium stearate ( mp 88degreesc ) ; talc , a hydrated magnesium silicate ; and hydroxyethylcellulose ( a gelling agent which is insoluble in water ) .
the coating contains other insolubles such as iron oxide , but this was usually removed in preparing the extracts .
there are advantages and disadvantages in counting particles by microscopy rather than an instrumental method , such as the coulter multisizer which has been used to study the effectiveness of filters for heroin injections [ 18 ] .
in this latter study , the instrument required considerable dilution of the sample ( 50 mul to 75 ml ) with the possibility of dissolution of some particles which would have been present in the smaller volume to be injected .
the dilution was made with an electrolyte ( saline ) which may also have affected particle solubility or aggregation .
microscopy avoided dilution and enabled examination of the appearance of particles , which gave insights into their origin ( such as crushed solids , condensed wax droplets , and crystallised morphine ) which in turn can indicate how they could be removed .
however , microscopy necessarily examines only a small part of the total sample , adding to errors as discussed below .
counting particles , especially in the unfiltered preparations , was inherently variable due to the large amount of insoluble material and its complex physical form .
this variability also affected instrumental counting , and scott [ 18 ] considered that variability in the particle counts made the exact values meaningless although useful for comparison of filters .
in our study counts are presented as the number of particles in an injection volume in order to relate the data to health impacts .
this required a large multiplier factor .
for example a count of one 100 mum particle in 5 fields using the 5x objective would give an estimated 8,897 particles in the 3 ml dose volume , and one 10 mum particle ( 20x objective ) would give 161,333 particles in 3 ml. if there were no similar particles in the other two replicate mixtures , then the mean particle counts would be 2966 for the 100 mum particle and 53778 for the 10 mum particle .
the particle counts are therefore reported in thousands to avoid implying a level of precision which would be misleading .
the counts are indicative estimates rather than precise determinations , but are nevertheless able to show that filtering can greatly reduce the number of particles injected .
the working area for preparing the injections was neither sterile nor particle - free , since the aim was to reproduce the typical conditions used for illicit preparations by injecting drug users .
consequently , a significant number of particles and fibres were found when control injections were prepared , showing that particles are ubiquitous unless removed by specific cleaning procedures .
fibres , however , were not counted as particles since they were present on control slides and were not considered to be tablet - derived .
environmental particles will vary widely according to local conditions but will add to the total particle burden in the injection .
not using a clean workplace became a limitation in counting particles in the cigarette plus 0.22 mum filtrate , in which virtually all tablet - derived particles had been removed .
the form of the waxes was evidently altered after melting and re - solidifying , with the formation of wax droplets of various sizes .
hot extraction resulted in a shift in particle size distribution , with the formation of more small particles (< 5 mum ) and fewer larger particles .
however , the remaining particle burden in unfiltered preparations was still too large for this to be considered other than harmful to inject .
pharmaceutical standards require that , measured by microscopy , injections of less than 100 ml must have , in total , no more than 3000 particles > 10 mum and no more than 300 particles > 25 mum [ 16 ] .
the hot unfiltered morphine tablet preparations had , in the total volume of 3 ml , an average 1.1 million particles > 10 mum and 368,000 particles > 20 mum .
for the cold preparations , the numbers of particles were 7.2 million > 10 mum , and 4.0 million > 20 mum .
the aqueous solubility of morphine is critically dependent on its ionization and therefore the ph , as the ionized form is freely soluble and the free base has a low water solubility ( 0.25 mg / ml at 35degreesc ) [ 19 ] .
these authors found that , at 35degreesc , the solubility of morphine in water was 13.39 mg / ml at ph 6.35 and 5.75 mg / ml at ph 6.69 .
this change in solubility with ph could be explained by the change in ionization and the low free base solubility .
a 60 mg tablet of morphine sulfate ( mw = 758.9 ) contains 45.1 mg morphine ( mw = 285.3 ) , or 15.0 mg / ml in the 3 ml extract .
using the amount of morphine sulfate recovered in cold extracts , this concentration would be 14.0 mg / ml. in either case , the concentration of morphine in the 3 ml extract will be critically close to , or exceed , its solubility , especially as the ph is slightly higher ( 6.4 ) and the temperature was considerably lower ( about 20degreesc ). from the pka of morphine ( 8.08 ) and the buffer equation , ph = pka + log10 ([ base form ]/[ acid form ]) , it can be calculated that morphine is 1.8 % unionized at ph 6.35 and 2.1 % unionized at ph 6.40 .
it was considered that morphine crystal formation was an artifact due to alkalinity in the glass microscope slide or cover , since they did not form on acid - washed glass or plastic slides .
however , there is a significant risk of formation of morphine crystals in the tablet extracts , , and conditions of preparation could reduce this problem by decreasing ph or , preferably , increasing the volume of water .
although morphine will eventually dissolve in blood this will take some time , and any crystals which remain undissolved during the brief transit time from injection site to capillary bed are liable to cause embolisms .
the unfiltered tablet extracts must be considered extremely harmful as they contained many particles of all sizes .
after intravenous injection , particles will flow through ever - widening vessels back to the heart and then they will enter the pulmonary circulation , where the smaller arteries which are 300 - 400 mum diameter [ 20 ] could be occluded by the largest particles found in unfiltered mixtures .
arterioles ( 9 - 40 mum diameter ) and capillaries ( 7 - 9 mum diameter ) could be blocked by the smaller particles .
even particles too small to embolize may cause vascular injury .
small airborne particles (< 2.5 mum ) have been implicated in cardiac and vascular damage , including endothelial dysfunction and promotion of atherosclerotic lesions [ 21 ] .
large numbers of particles of this size were present in the unfiltered mixtures .
the cigarette filter reduced the number of particles , especially the larger particles .
this filter was more effective when used after hot extraction , but the remaining particle burden remained too high for injection. of course , cigarette filters are not designed for liquids .
the morphine recovery from the cigarette filters was nearly complete ( 90 %) after two rinses .
the unfiltered mixtures caused a block of the syringe filters , but the cigarette filtrate passed through them , as did the rinse volumes .
scott [ 18 ] found that both 0.22 mum and 0.45 mum syringe filters blocked with heroin injections , and abandoned them in favour of 5 mum filters .
however , these blockages can be prevented by the use of a preliminary , coarse filter , such as the cigarette filter applied here .
the combination of cigarette filter then syringe filter mostly gave a good recovery of the extracted morphine .
the 0.22 mum filter is considered to be sterilizing because , unlike the 0.45 mum filter , it will remove bacteria .
in a trial with injecting drug users [ 22 ] , it was found that 0.22 mum syringe filters were effective in removing bacteria from 3 out of 4 injections , while larger pore filters ( 15 - 20 mum ) were completely inadequate .
conclusions when a tablet of slow - release morphine ( ms contin ( r )) is crushed and mixed with water , the resulting mixture contains millions of particles , of sizes from less than 5 mum to greater than 400 mum .
these particles will cause great harm if injected into the bloodstream .
the number of particles can be greatly reduced by filtration .
a low - porosity syringe filter ( 0.45 or 0.22 mum ) is most effective , but is likely to block unless a coarser filter is used first .
little of the morphine is lost in filtration if the filters are rinsed .
hot extraction does not significantly increase extraction of morphine , and carries the risk of filtering a warm mixture which allows wax to pass through the filter , producing particles when it cools and solidifies .
in practice , it is uncommon for solutions to be left for long before filtration and injection , producing the potential for a substantially greater level of filtrate contamination with wax than identified in the current study .
it is not possible to prepare an injection of pharmaceutical standard without clean facilities , as some particles will remain even after filtration through a syringe filter , and the injection will not be sterile .
also , the manufacturer cautions against using millex ( r ) sterile filters for suspensions or emulsions , because they are not designed for this purpose ( millipore millex user guide , 2008 ) .
however , filtration with a 0.45 mum or 0.22 mum filter can remove virtually all of the tablet - derived particles and should be a standard method of harm reduction for injecting drug users ( a plain language summary of this study is provided in additional file 1 in order to facilitate health interventions ) .
the 0.22 mum filter is to be preferred , as it can remove the organisms ( e.g. staphylococcus aureus , candida ) which commonly produce cutaneous and systemic infections in injecting drug users [ 7,8,10 ] .
although it cannot remove the much smaller virus particles , including hepatitis c [ 23 ] , viral infections are mostly due to blood contamination from shared equipment and are avoided by not sharing .
in one canadian hospital , the two most common reasons for admission of injecting drug users were pneumonia and soft - tissue infections [ 24 ] , both potentially preventable by effective skin swabbing and filtration of injections .
the average daily cost of hospitalization was $ can610 ($ usd420 at the time of the study ) , which makes the use of alcohol swabs ( currently <$ usd0.02 in australia ) and filters (<$ usd0.90 ) extremely cost - effective .

peptide and protein identification remains challenging in organisms with poorly annotated or rapidly evolving genomes , as are commonly encountered in environmental or biofuels research .
such limitations render tandem mass spectrometry ( ms / ms ) database search algorithms ineffective as they lack corresponding sequences required for peptide - spectrum matching .
we address this challenge with the spectral networks approach to ( 1 ) match spectra of orthologous peptides across multiple related species and then ( 2 ) propagate peptide annotations from identified to unidentified spectra .
we here present algorithms to assess the statistical significance of spectral alignments ( align - gf ) , reduce the impurity in spectral networks , and accurately estimate the error rate in propagated identifications .
analyzing three related cyanothece species , a model organism for biohydrogen production , spectral networks identified peptides from highly divergent sequences from networks with dozens of variant peptides , including thousands of peptides in species lacking a sequenced genome .
our analysis further detected the presence of many novel putative peptides even in genomically characterized species , thus suggesting the possibility of gaps in our understanding of their proteomic and genomic expression .
a web - based pipeline for spectral networks analysis is available at http :// proteomics.ucsd.edu / software .

genomics studies have increased the number of sequenced bioenergy - related microbial genomes and revealed the possible biological reactions involved in bioenergy production ( 3 ) .
studies of photosynthetic microorganisms , for example , have yielded insights into how they harvest solar energy and use it to produce bioenergy products ( 4 ) .
despite this importance of microorganisms , the characterization of diverse microbial phenotypes by proteomics tandem mass spectrometry ( ms / ms ) has been limited .
the dominant approaches for ms / ms analysis heavily rely on the availability of completely annotated genomes ( i.e. accurate protein databases ) ( 5 - 7 ) , yet most microorganisms populating the planet have unsequenced or poorly annotated genomes .
thus it remains challenging to identify proteins from environmental and unculturable organisms .
one solution to protein identification in a species with no sequenced genome is to use the genomes of closely related species ( 8 ) .
this requires matching ms / ms data to slightly different peptides in amino acid sequences ( polymorphic , orthologous peptides ) ; but matching shifted masses of peptides and their fragment ions is computationally expensive and challenging .
moreover , different species - specific post - translational modifications ( ptms ) 1 can make the cross - species identification more complex .
the common computational approach is tolerantly matching de novo sequences derived from ms / ms data to the database while allowing for amino acid mutations and modifications ( 9 - 11 ) .
however , this approach critically depends on good de novo interpretations , which are nearly always partially incorrect and yield high - quality subsequences only for a small fraction of all spectra .
the blind database search approach , developed to identify peptides with unexpected modifications , can also be used to directly match ms / ms data from unknown species to a database of closely related species , but its utilization is limited because of its exceptionally large search space ( 12 - 18 ) .
these spectrum - database matching approaches to cross - species identification pose significant challenges in its speed and sensitivity with a huge database , which leads to a much longer search time and more false positive identifications ( 19 , 20 ) .
as a complementary approach to spectrum - database matching , spectral library searching is an emerging and promising approach ( 21 ) .
a spectral library is a large collection of identified ms / ms spectra , and an unknown query spectrum can then be identified by direct spectral matching to the library .
the great advantage of this approach is the reduction of search space and the use of fragmentation patterns of peptides .
the spectral networks approach expands this concept to the identification of modified peptides in ms / ms data sets ( 22 , 23 ) .
spectral networks do not directly search a database , but groups ms / ms spectra by computing the pairwise similarity between ms / ms spectra of peptide variants and then constructs networks where each spectrum defines a node and each significant spectral pair , highly correlated in the fragmentation pattern , defines an edge ( fig. 1 ) .
in spectral networks , identification of spectra belonging to the same subnetwork should be related and thus the peptide sequence for an identified spectrum can be propagated to neighboring unidentified spectra .
we recently reported that a vast number of polymorphic , orthologous peptides across species are present in ms / ms data sets ( 24 ) .
we propose a new approach in cross - species proteomics research that aggregates ms / ms of multiple related species followed by spectral networks analysis of the pooled data to capitalize on pairs of spectra from orthologous peptides , as shown in fig. 1. this approach does not require advance knowledge of the genomes for all species , and enables the identification of novel , polymorphic peptides across species via interspecies propagation .
compared with previous approaches , cross - species spectral network analysis has two major advantages .
first , by matching spectra to spectra instead of spectra to database sequences , spectral networks only consider the sequence variability of peptides present in the samples instead of considering all possible variability across the whole database of related species ; thus the performance of spectral networks is independent of database size .
second , the analysis of the set of highly related spectra increases the reliability in identifying polymorphic peptides in that multiple different spectra can support the same novel identification .
the utility of spectral networks can be also expanded to the proteomic analysis of microbial communities that often contain hundreds of distinct organisms ( 25 , 26 ) .
but despite the success of spectral networks in low complexity data sets ( 22 , 23 ) , the analysis of large multi - species proteomics data requires significantly higher reliability in spectral similarity scores because the number of pairwise spectral comparisons grows quadratically with the number of spectra .
in this work , we present algorithmic and statistical advances to spectral networks to improve its utility with large and diverse spectral data sets .
to statistically assess the significance of spectral alignments in pairing millions of spectra , we propose align - gf ( generating function for spectral alignment ) to compute rigorous p values of a spectral pair based on the complete score histogram of all possible alignments between two spectra .
we show that align - gf successfully addressed the reliability challenge in a large data set analysis and demonstrated its utility by leading to a 4 - fold increase in the sensitivity of spectral pairs .
even with this dramatically improved accuracy , a very small number of incorrect pairs in a network can still complicate propagation of annotations .
to further progress toward the ideal scenario where each subnetwork consists of only spectra from a single peptide family , we introduce new procedures to split mixed networks from different peptide families and show that these effectively eliminate many false spectral pairs .
finally , we propose the first approach to calculation of false discovery rate ( fdr ) for spectral networks propagation of identifications from unmodified to progressively more modified peptides .
the proposed fdr estimation was conservative and was more rigorous for highly modified peptides , and thus now makes propagation results comparable to other peptide identification approaches .
the cross - species spectral networks techniques proposed here enabled the proteomic analysis of three different cyanothece species , including a strain where the genome sequence is not known .
cyanobacteria are one of the most diverse and widely distributed microorganisms and have received significant consideration as satisfying various demands required in bioenergy generation ( 27 ) .
we show that spectral networks can improve peptide identification by up to 38 % compared with mainstream approaches , including many polymorphic and modified peptides .
spectral networks could identify peptides with highly divergent sequences ( with 7 amino acid mutations ) by leveraging networks of variant peptides , and one example subnetwork of species - specific variants of phycobilisome proteins reflects the diversity of photosynthetic light - harvesting strategies ( 28 ) .
our approach thus demonstrates the potential gains in multi - species proteomics and sets the stage for related developments in higher - complexity metaproteomics samples .
finally , spectral networks revealed many unidentified subnetworks containing only unidentified spectra , thus strongly suggesting the presence of novel peptides that are missing from current protein databases .
although we illustrate the potential of our approach on a specific set of bioenergy - related species , we note that the proposed approach is generic and should be applicable to any other set of related species .
the diversity of biologically important protein families could be studied by comparing closely and more remotely related species .
experimental procedures ms / ms data set ms / ms data from cyanothece sp. atcc 51142 was previously described ( 29 , 30 ) , and ms / ms data for cyanothece sp. pcc 8801 and cyanothece sp. atcc 51472 were prepared in a similar manner .
briefly , proteins from cyanothece sp .
51142 , cyanothece sp .
8801 , and 51472 were treated identically , using 8 m urea and 5 mm tributylphosphine ( sigma - aldrich , saint louis , mo ) at 37 degreesc for 60 min , except for the addition of 1 % chaps for 45 min prior to digestion in the insoluble protein fraction of 51142 .
samples were not alkylated prior to lc - ms / ms analysis .
the trypsin - digested samples were separated using strong cation exchange chromatography ( scx ) with a polysulfoethyl a , 200 mm x 2.1 mm , 5 mum , 300 - a column and a 10 mm x 2.1 mm guard column ( polylc , inc. , columbia , md ) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml / min .
the fractions were subjected to the lc - ms / ms analysis that coupled a constant pressure ( 5000 psi ) reversed phase capillary liquid chromatography system ( 150 mum i.d. x 360 mum o.d. x 65 cm capillary ; polymicro technologies inc. , phoenix , az ) with a ltq orbitrap mass spectrometer ( thermo , san jose , ca ) .
ms1 scans were acquired at 100,000 resolution in the orbitrap .
ms / ms analysis of the ten most abundant precursors was performed at low resolution in the cid ion trap .
all raw files were converted to mzxml using proteowizard ( ver .
3.0.5655 ; http :// proteowizard.sourceforge.net ) which is a set of open - source , cross - platform tools and software libraries that convert various vendor formats to readable standard formats and facilitate proteomics data analysis .
all data files and results including annotated mass spectra were deposited on massive ( http :// massive.ucsd.edu ) , with the accession msv000079552 .
ms - clustering typically , ms / ms data sets contain substantial amounts of redundancy , with multiple spectra coming from the same peptide .
we used ms - cluster ( ver. 2.0 ) ( 31 ) to group spectra of the same peptides and compute cluster consensus spectra prior to spectral networks analysis .
in brief , ms - cluster retains peaks in a cluster consensus spectrum based on peak occurrences in the clustered spectra .
ms - cluster reduced the ms / ms data set to a smaller set of spectra , consequently improving the speed of spectral networks by reducing the number of spectra that undergo pairwise comparisons .
originally , the data consisted of 275,756 ms / ms spectra for cyanothece sp .
8801 , 481,411 spectra for cyanothece sp .
51142 and 257,442 spectra for cyanothece sp .
51472. ms - cluster was applied to each species with the precursor window size of 0.1 da and the fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.4 da ( ms - cluster does not support ppm tolerance ) .
ms - cluster yielded 141,140 cluster - consensus spectra for cyanothece sp .
8801 , 171,430 cluster - consensus spectra for cyanothece sp .
51142 and 126,148 cluster - consensus spectra for cyanothece sp .
51472. the clustered spectra were used for all subsequent data analysis .
seed identification and gold - standard spectral pairs the clustered spectra were searched using ms - gf + ( ver .
9881 ) ( 32 ) to identify seed peptides for propagation in our constructed spectral networks .
spectra were searched with the following parameters : enzyme = trypsin , the number of enzymatic termini = 1 / 2 , the number of missed cleavages = any , precursor mass tolerance = +/ - 20 ppm , variable modifications = oxidation ( met ) and pyro - glu ( n - terminal gln ) , the number of modifications / peptide = up to 1 .
the database consisted of 4,335 and 5,239 protein sequences of cyanothece sp .
8801 and 51142 , respectively , downloaded from ncbi ( august 2014 ) and was appended with their reversed sequences for target - decoy fdr estimation ( 33 ) .
finally , the identifications were filtered using a spectrum probability of 1 e - 10 ( which corresponded to 0.03 % spectrum level fdr ) , resulting in 61,799 peptide - spectrum matches ( psms ) .
these identifications were also used as the gold standard to evaluate the correctness of spectral pairs : a spectral pair is i ) true if two peptides are identical , one peptide is a prefix / suffix of the other , or one peptide is a singly modified form of the other , ii ) ambiguous if two peptides share 12 or more consecutive amino acids or the overlap of theoretical fragment ions of the two peptides is more than 60 % iii ) false for other cases .
ambiguous pairs were not counted when evaluating spectral pairs ( i.e. these were neither true nor false ) .
spectral networks analyses spectral networks analyses were performed against the clustered spectra from each data set with +/ - 0.4 da mass tolerance for fragment ions ; mass tolerance for precursor masses was not required as the mass difference between the precursor masses of aligned spectra was assigned to the mass of modification .
the maximum possible mass of considered modifications was +/ - 375 da. typically samples digested with trypsin include many partially tryptic peptides ( where only one end corresponds to a tryptic cleavage ) and peptides containing tryptic cleavages ( i.e. missed cleavages ) .
besides amino acid mutations and modifications , spectral networks can detect those truncated / extended peptides from exact tryptic peptides .
the mass range of 375 da would allow the amino acid deletion / extension up to two trp residues .
initial spectral pairs were accepted if align - gf p value was less than 5 e - 9 ( see generation of align - gf score histogram section ) , and then were filtered out to restrict the number of precursor masses ( 100 in our work ) contained in a subnetwork ( see splitting mixed subnetworks section below ) .
when seed identifications were loaded into spectral networks for propagation , the edge fdr and align - gf p value threshold could be calculated based on the annotated spectral pairs .
finally , spectral pairs were filtered out to bring the edge fdr to the specified value .
generation of align - gf score histogram align - gf computes the score histogram of all possible alignments against a spectrum using the generating function approach , and computes rigorous p values of spectral pairs matched to the spectrum based on the score histogram .
each ms / ms spectrum was converted into a prefix - residue mass ( prm ) spectrum ( scored version of spectrum ) using pepnovo ( 34 ) , where ms / ms peak intensities were converted into log - likelihood scores by considering complementary ions ( b / y ) , multiply charged ions , neutral losses ( - h2o and - nh3 ) , and 13c isotopes for each peak .
in prm spectra , peaks at masses corresponding to fragmentation of peptide bonds tend to have high scores whereas peaks at other masses tend to have very low scores ( or are removed if the resulting likelihood scores are negative ) , thus improving the signal - to - noise ratio .
align - gf score histograms were computed on converted prm spectra .
a possible alignment against a spectrum s is defined as a subset of peaks in s , and all possible alignments against s can be represented as all possible subsets of peaks in s ( i.e. 2n possible alignments , where n is the number of peaks in s ) .
the score of an alignment is calculated as the sum of peak scores in the corresponding subset of s , and its probability is calculated as thetam ( 1 - theta ) n - m , where m is the number of peaks in the subset , and theta is the probability of randomly matching a peak in a spectrum , modeled as an independent bernoulli event ( we use theta = 0.05 as estimated by matching randomly generated theoretical peak lists to identified spectra in our data set using fragment mass tolerance of 0.4 da ) .
calculated scores and probabilities for all possible subsets of s define the align - gf score histogram as the probability density function for all possible alignments against s. supplemental fig. s1 shows an example of generating the align - gf score histogram and illustrates the difference between the score histogram generated by align - gf and the previously used gaussian empirical approximation ( 22 , 23 ) .
the calculation of align - gf histograms can be done rapidly by dynamic programming .
let a variable d [ i , t ] be the overall probability of alignments that have score t up to the i - th peak in s. the variable d [ i , t ] can be calculated using the following recursion : where theta is the probability of randomly matching a peak and score ( i ) is the score of i - th peak .
the first term in the sum updates the distribution when i - th peak is matched , and the second term updates the distribution when i - th peak is not matched .
d [ 0,0 ] is initialized to 1 and elsewhere to zero .
then , if an alignment in s has score t , the probability that the alignment randomly obtained a score of at least t is calculated as follows , where e is the last peak index : splitting mixed subnetworks in spectral networks , the ideal scenario is that each subnetwork consists of only spectra from a single " peptide family " ( where the subnetwork remains connected if using only correct edges ) , whereas a mixed subnetwork contains spectra from different peptide families .
mixed subnetworks can be caused by incorrect spectral pairs because just one incorrect spectral pair with spectra from distinct peptide families is sufficient to combine the two peptide families into a single subnetwork .
mixed subnetworks can also be caused by co - fragmented , multiplexed ms / ms spectra .
for example , if there is a multiplexed spectrum s ( a , b ) including fragment ions from both peptides a and b , the multiplexed spectrum could possibly be paired with s ( a ) and s ( b ) , and as a result , a subnetwork of peptide a would be connected with that of peptide b by s ( a , b ) .
co - fragmentation is commonly observed with 5 ~ 10 % of ms / ms spectra often coming from cofragmented precursors ( 35 ) .
although most multiplexed spectra s ( a , b ) have suboptimal align - gf p values against s ( a ) or s ( a ) , frequent cofragmentation could still lead to mixed subnetworks consisting of up to tens of thousands of spectra , which can substantially complicate propagation of annotations .
an intuitive way of splitting mixed subnetworks into single peptide family subnetworks is to remove all incorrect pairs or pairs including multiplexed spectra .
but because this information is not available , we limited the potential impact of this issue by restricting the number of unique precursor masses in a single subnetwork to less than a certain predefined value .
this was implemented as follows : starting with the best - scoring spectral pair , spectral pairs were introduced into spectral networks by the order of increasing align - gf p values .
when two subnetworks would be connected by a newly considered spectral pair , the spectral pair was skipped if the resulting number of unique precursor ion masses in the mixed subnetwork exceeded the predefined value .
this process stops when all edges are considered .
the rationale is that combining two different subnetworks into a subnetwork larger than a certain size should require highly significant spectral pairs .
the p values of incorrect pairs are relatively high , and the p values of multiplexed spectra would be also high because when the multiplexed spectrum is aligned to spectra of its isolated component peptides , fragment ions from the other peptide would remain unmatched .
this approach significantly improved the quality of the spectral network and supplemental fig. s2 shows the gains in performance .
fdr from propagation the errors in both seed identification and spectral pairs are involved in the overall error of propagation of identifications in spectral networks .
a propagated identification would be correct only if i ) the seed identification is correct and ii ) all propagation steps are correct .
thus , propagation fdr can be estimated as the probability that , given a seed and all propagation steps , at least one of these is incorrect .
supplemental fig. s3 illustrates the propagation fdr calculation .
fdr is calculated for every propagation step and fdrn after the n - th propagation to the current node is calculated as follows : where a is the fdr in seed identification , and r is the fdr in spectral pairs .
note that a is known because seeds are given ( we used a = 0.0003 ) , and r can be estimated using spectral pairs annotated by the seeds ( we used r = 0.005 ) .
this formula implements the intuition that identifications via more steps of propagations would include a greater error because of accumulated edge errors .
the aggregate fdr for overall identification up to current step was calculated as follows where idk is the number of identifications added at k - th propagation the propagation procedure is stopped when the aggregate fdr reaches a prespecified fdr threshold .
modification localization once a peptide sequence from an identified spectrum is propagated to an unidentified spectrum , new identification to the unidentified spectrum can be determined .
a putative modification mass is calculated as a precursor mass difference between the two spectra , and then the position of the modification in the propagated peptide is assigned as follows .
every amino acid in the peptide is assumed as a possible modification site .
a modification to each amino acid would generate a theoretical spectrum , where the masses of fragment ions are shifted according to the modification mass and location .
all theoretical spectra are scored against the unidentified spectrum , and then the modification site with the highest score is determined .
this new identification would be also propagated to other unidentified spectra .
supplemental fig. s4 illustrates the procedure .
ms - gf + and moda searches for the performance comparison with established tools , two searches were conducted .
one was a standard database search , ms - gf + ( ver. 9881 ) ( 32 ) , and the other was an unrestrictive blind modification search , moda ( ver. 1.23 ) ( 18 ) .
ms - gf + search parameters were as follows : enzyme = trypsin , the number of enzymatic termini = 1 / 2 , the number of missed cleavages = any , precursor mass tolerance = +/ - 20 ppm , c13 errors in precursor mass = up to 2 , variable modifications = oxidation ( met ) and pyro - glu ( n - terminal gln ) , the number of modifications / peptide = up to 2 .
moda search parameters were as follows : enzyme = trypsin , the number of enzymatic termini = 1 / 2 , the number of missed cleavages = any , precursor mass tolerance = auto correction , fragment mass tolerance = +/ - 0.4 da , modification mass size = +/ - 200 , the number of modifications / peptide = any .
the database consisted of 4,335 and 5,239 protein sequences of cyanothece sp .
8801 and 51142 downloaded from ncbi ( august 2014 ) and was appended with their reversed sequences .
finally , peptide identifications were obtained at fdr 1 % using target - decoy fdr estimation ( 33 ) .
software implementation algorithms and software for spectral networks analysis were integrated to a pipeline ( supplemental fig. s5 ) , which is available at http :// proteomics.ucsd.edu / software .
the spectral networks pipeline supports various ms / ms spectral types : ( 1 ) mzml , mzxml , mgf , and pkl as file formats ; ( 2 ) cid , hcd , and etd as fragmentation methods ; ( 3 ) high - resolution ms / ms instruments such as q - tof and q - exactive .
the results page provides a tabular list view for peptide / protein report , which can be filtered and arranged by various criteria , and a graphical view for the annotation of ms / ms spectra .
results biohydrogen is an emerging renewable and green energy source , and several microalgae and bacterial species are studied as model organisms for photobiological hydrogen production .
cyanothece sp .
51142 , a unicellular , diazotrophic cyanobacterium , is capable of performing oxygenic photosynthesis during the day and nitrogen fixation at night , resulting in remarkably high rates of hydrogen production under aerobic condition ( 36 ) .
studying related cyanothece species is of great interest to identify variants with potentially improved biofuel production mechanisms .
however , as is generally the case with organisms with poorly annotated genomes , proteomics analysis for various environmental isolates is challenging because of the lack of accurate and complete proteomes .
here we show how this proteomics challenge can be addressed for cyanothece 51472 ( which lacks a sequenced genome ) by using spectral networks of ms / ms data of related species ( cyanothece 8801 and cyanothece 51142 ) ( see fig. 1 ). fig. 1. overview of multi - species spectral networks .
nodes represent individual spectra and edges between nodes represent significant pairwise alignment between spectra ; edges are labeled with amino acid mutations ( dotted edges ) or parent mass differences ( solid edges ) .
in spectral networks , a peptide and its related variants are ideally grouped into a single subnetwork .
if at least one spectrum in a subnetwork is annotated ( filled node ) , all the neighboring spectra ( unfilled nodes ) can potentially become identified by propagating the annotation over network edges .
for example , all spectra in the subnetwork of " peptide a " ( top left , blue network ) can be annotated via up to three iterative propagations , first from a to { a1 , a2 , a3 } , second from { a2 , a3 } to { a4 , a5 } , and third from { a4 , a5 } to a6 .
this paradigm can be equally applied to cross - species data analysis , as " peptide l " identified in species 1 ( top middle , olive - colored network ) is propagated to a node unidentified in species 2 , identifying its orthologous " peptide l " , with a serine to alanine polymorphism .
thus , spectral networks enable the detection of orthologous peptide pairs between different species .
analogous to the pairwise alignment of sequence reads in genome assembly , the fundamental operation in spectral networks is pairwise alignment of spectra to spectra .
starting with over 1 million spectra from all three cyanothece species , the search space contains ~ 500 billion spectrum / spectrum pairs where > 99.9 % are expected to be incorrect .
to address this challenge we first used ms - cluster ( 31 ) to condense redundant spectra into 438,718 representative consensus spectra and then scored pairwise alignments between consensus spectra using our new align - gf approach to compute rigorous p values of spectral alignments ( see fig. 2a and supplemental fig. s1 ; details under experimental procedures ) .
align - gf successfully detected a very high fraction of all true spectral pairs from many billions of false positive pairs , resulting in a 393 % increase in sensitivity at 99 % precision in comparison with the previous method ( see fig. 2b and supplemental fig. s1d ) .
in particular it should be noted that align - gf detected pairs of variant peptides ( e.g. mutated , modified or truncated ) equally well as pairs of identical peptides ( dotted curve in fig. 2b ) .
generally , pairing the spectra of slightly different peptides is more valuable because they capture post - translational modifications and sequence divergence between species , but it is more difficult than pairing spectra of identical peptides. fig. 2. align - gf algorithm overview .
a , matching a spectral pair .
two ms / ms spectra are aligned allowing up to one modification , matching red peaks in s1 with blue peaks in s2 .
the total score t1 of red peaks indicates how well s1 is explained by this alignment , and the same for blue peaks in s2 and t2 .
align - gf assesses each score , ti , based on the histogram of all possible alignments against the corresponding spectrum , si , and computes its p value - the probability of randomly matching a spectrum with a score at least as high as t ( e.g. the probability that t1 is the result of a random match to s1 ) .
more details are provided under experimental procedures .
if both p values of t1 and t2 are less than the predefined cutoff , the two spectra are accepted as a spectral pair .
edges in spectral networks are thus defined by spectral alignments between spectra si and sj. b , align - gf performance .
the correctness of spectral pairs was evaluated using ms - gf + annotations .
the blue curve represents the performance of align - gf , whereas the red curve represents the previous method .
the previous method assumed that alignment scores between unrelated spectra conform to a gaussian distribution ( 22 , 23 ) .
the dotted curve shows the performance in detecting variant pairs , in which one peptide is a prefix / suffix or a singly modified / mutated form of the other .
as pairs are aggregated into networks , ideal subnetworks should consist of only spectra from related variants of one peptide , a kind of " peptide family. " however , incorrect spectral pairs connect otherwise correctly disjoint subnetworks .
even at align - gf 's 99.99 % specificity and 99 % precision , the remaining high - scoring incorrect spectral pairs can create large mixed networks .
two issues generally lead to mixed subnetworks : false positive spectral pairs and co - fragmented peptides in ms / ms spectra ( 37 ) .
we addressed this issue using a network - splitting procedure to separate mixed networks by limiting the number of distinct precursor masses per subnetwork ( experimental procedures and supplemental fig. s2 ) .
network splitting removed 37 % of incorrect spectral pairs from the spectral network and resulted in ~ 5000 more properly disjoint subnetworks while removing only 0.2 % of correct pairs .
in contrast , a corresponding adjustment of the align - gf threshold eliminates only ~ 2 % of incorrect pairs (~ 18x less ) with the same sensitivity loss .
the final spectral network covered 242,341 spectra from the three cyanothece species ( 55 % of the input consensus spectra ) combined into 33,188 subnetworks with 99.5 % precision of spectral pairs .
spectral networks yield additional peptide identifications via propagation across spectral pairs and retain final identifications at fdr 1 % ( see experimental procedures for details ) .
prior to propagation 16,932 annotated subnetworks ( covering 180,236 spectra ) contained at least one identified spectrum ( out of 61,799 psms used as seed annotations ) .
the remaining 16,256 unidentified subnetworks ( 62,105 spectra ) did not contain any identified spectra .
spectral networks across species to evaluate the effectiveness of spectral networks across species , we separated the 16,932 annotated subnetworks into 7 groups ( see fig. 3 ) .
this readily revealed that species 8801 and 51472 were closely related in that subnetworks across the two species were most frequently found ( covering > 95 % of all networked spectra from species 8801 and 51472 ) , whereas species 51142 was comparatively distant from the other species in that intraspecies subnetworks were more frequently observed ( 33 % of all networked spectra from species 51142 ). fig. 3. annotated spectral networks .
this venn diagram classifies 16,932 annotated subnetworks into seven groups by combinations of species based upon the origin of the spectra in each subnetwork ; blue represents cyanothece sp .
8801 , red cyanothece sp .
51142 , and green cyanothece sp .
51472. there are 2,378 subnetworks that include spectra from all species ; 97 % of all networked spectra from cyanothece 51472 ( with unknown genome ) were contained in multi - species subnetworks .
for each group , two properties are shown : 1 ) # spectra from species is the number of spectra in the group from species 8801 at the first column , 51142 at the second , and 51472 at the third , respectively ; 2 ) # networks with variants is the number of subnetworks that include variant pairs - spectral pairs in which the parent mass difference between the two spectra is larger than 5 da. in the right bottom , the delta mass histogram is shown for variant pairs in the group that includes spectra from species 51142 and 51472 ( dotted rectangle ) , where the gray distribution was calculated from interspecies pairs .
we next focused on subnetworks containing variant pairs - spectral pairs where the parent mass difference between the spectra in the pair is larger than 5 da ( to avoid ambiguities because of precursor mass errors ) .
it should be noted that subnetworks consisting of spectra from multi - species are more likely to contain peptide variants because orthologous peptides are commonly observed in proteomics data from different species .
for example , ~ 90 % of the 2,378 subnetworks consisting of spectra from all three species contained variant pairs , compared with 36 % for those including only spectra from species 51142 .
in fig. 3 , the presence of orthologous peptides is also supported by a strong peak at 14 da ( corresponding to 8 different amino acid mutations : asp / glu , gly / ala , ser / thr , asn / gln , asn / lys , thr / asp , val / leu , and val / ile ) in the delta mass histogram from interspecies pairs .
moreover , subnetworks across all three species contain a majority of spectra and the spectral count from each species is evenly abundant , indicating that abundantly observed peptides in one species have their orthologous ones that are also abundantly observed in different species .
one example of a multi - species spectral network with species - specific mutations is shown in fig. 4. twenty - three polymorphic peptides from allophycocyanin proteins , two from species 8801 ( blue series ) and two from species 51142 ( red series ) , constructed a single subnetwork .
paired peptides differed by one and two amino acid mutations , oxidation or truncation events .
these chromophore containing phycobilisome proteins are key components of light harvesting complexes , found within specialized thylakoid membranes , and which facilitate the capture and transfer of light energy into the cellular reaction centers .
polymorphisms in these proteins have significant implications on energy harvesting and transfer , photosynthetic efficiency , and hence production of downstream bioenergy related molecules .
as such , they are of high interest for optimizing synthetic bioenergy production .
this subnetwork is highlighted to show that two peptides with seven amino acid mutations were connected via intermediate mutated and truncated peptides , showing how spectral networks can detect distantly related peptide variants. fig. 4. multi - species spectral network with species - specific mutations .
twenty - three different peptides from four versions of " allophycocyanin subunit beta " protein constructed a single subnetwork .
pairwise spectral alignments that pass the align - gf cutoff are shown as edges connecting the peptide sequences .
the blue series of peptides were from species 8801 ( uniprot : b7k5q5 _ cyap8 in dark blue and b7jyl9 _ cyap8 in light blue ) , and red series from 51142 ( uniprot : b1wv60 _ cyaa5 in dark red and , b1x0k5 _ cyaa5 in light red ). through this dense network , we are able to connect highly divergent peptides , e.g. peptides 1 and 4 differ by seven amino acids .
peptide identification via propagation propagating annotations is a unique feature in spectral networks , and can lead to significant increases in the number of identified spectra , including multiply modified peptides .
the accuracy of propagation relies on both the accuracy of seed identifications and the reliability of spectral pairs .
for example , if seed identifications were obtained at fdr 1 % , all identifications propagated from the 1 % false - positives must be also incorrect .
additionally , because spectral networks contain a small fraction of incorrect edges , errors also accumulate with more steps of propagation .
after a systematic analysis of the errors in propagation , we propose a new approach to estimate the fdr of peptide identifications in spectral networks so that we can control the propagation procedure and make the identification results comparable to other search tools ( experimental procedures and supplemental fig. s3 ) .
in the spectral networks of three cyanothece , we started propagation with 61,799 seed identifications from ms - gf + ( 32 ) .
nonannotated nodes received their annotation from the incoming edge with the lowest align - gf p value ( supplemental fig. s6 ) .
spectral networks identified 121,204 additional spectra at fdr 1 % , leading to the identification of 95 % of spectra in annotated subnetworks. fig. 5a shows the numbers and directions of propagations across species .
the intraspecies propagations ( shown as the circled arrows ) mainly identify modified peptides , whereas interspecies propagations identify orthologous peptides .
we note that propagation through spectral networks increases the confidence and sensitivity in the assignment of modified / mutated peptides , as spectral pairs provide additional evidence that the corresponding spectra contained highly correlated peptide fragmentation patterns .
this strength is maximized in multi - species analysis , where grouping multiple variants of a peptide across species increases the chance of reliably identifying novel peptides through alignment with multiple related peptides .
as illustrated in fig. 5b , the novel peptide identification in sp .
51472 is supported by high correlation with both seed identifications from sp .
8801 and 51142. fig. 5. propagation over multi - species spectral networks .
a , the numbers of intraspecies ( circled arrows ) and interspecies ( arrows between colored triangles ) propagations are shown .
b , propagation into unknown species 51472 identified novel , orthologous peptides .
the fragment ion alignment is shown between a spectrum of a novel peptide ( middle ) identified by propagation from two seed peptides from different species in the same subnetwork .
the two seeds were identified from dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase in each species .
multistep propagation allows spectral networks to be extremely flexible in the identification of highly modified peptides and supplemental fig. s7 shows an example of identifying a triply modified peptide .
propagation via the network avoids the large search space of blind searches ( which allows one modification of any mass anywhere in the database ) by allowing for any number of modifications but only as derived from seed sequences .
this is a great advantage in that the performance of blind database searches tends to degrade rapidly with increasing numbers of modifications and sites per peptide , in both the accuracy of peptide identifications and the speed of the searches ( 19 , 20 ) .
competence in identifications to contrast the identification performance of spectral networks with mainstream approaches , the results were compared with the standard database search tool ms - gf + ( 32 ) , and the blind search tool moda ( 18 ) ( see experimental procedures ) .
spectral networks initially used the subset of ms - gf + psms as seeds for propagation ( at fdr 0.03 %) and increased the number of identifications in networked spectra by ~ 180 % at fdr 1 % .
consequently , spectral networks resulted in a total of 38 % more psms than ms - gf + ( fig. 6a ) .
further examination of the 31,321 psms identified only by ms - gf + revealed that most psms had low spectral probabilities ( in fig. 6a ) , and are thus most likely derived from less informative spectra. fig. 6. identification performance .
all of the identifications were obtained at fdr 1 % .
a , comparison with ms - gf + .
ms - gf + score distributions show the difference between psms that spectral networks also identified ( black ) and psms that spectral networks lost ( gray ) .
b , identification on networked spectra .
nonnetworked spectra in seeds of spectral networks were excluded from the comparison .
spectral networks take advantage of spectral pairs and emphasize the improvement of identification performance on networked spectra .
in fig. 6b , spectral networks show the significant improvement on networked spectra , resulting in 80 and 45 % more psms than ms - gf + and moda , respectively .
the loss of sensitivity in spectral networks mainly occurred at nonnetworked spectra , which have poor psm scores ( fig. 6a ) .
this identification inconsistency for poor quality spectra between search tools is common in ms / ms data analyses ( 38 ) .
discussion microorganisms are very diverse and their proteomics analyses have been limited because of the lack of sequenced genomes .
multi - species spectral networks provide a new way to identify microbial peptides and proteins .
the spectral networks analysis of three related cyanothece confirmed that orthologous peptides were commonly observed in multi - species ms / ms data sets , and identified many polymorphic peptides across species , leading to more identifications than other approaches , even for organisms without a sequenced genome .
the algorithmic and statistical advances in spectral networks successfully addressed reliability challenges in large - scale analysis of multiple species data sets .
align - gf rigorously assessed the statistical significance of each spectral alignment using the score distribution of all possible alignments , and thus provided excellent separation between correct and incorrect spectral pairs .
align - gf detected spectral pairs of variant peptides equally well as those of identical peptides , resulting in a 4 - fold increase in sensitivity .
this core improvement significantly expands the utility of spectral networks .
we also , for the first time , proposed the fdr estimation of propagating annotations through a spectral network .
although some approaches have proposed the identification of modified peptides by propagating annotations ( 39 - 41 ) , none has fully addressed fdr estimation .
our approach ensures a conservative estimate of the fdr and is increasingly rigorous for higher - modified peptides .
most importantly , the fdr estimation also makes spectral networks results comparable with other methods and reveals that the resulting spectrum identification rates can be nearly complete ( currently at 95 %) as soon as there is at least one seed in a subnetwork .
spectral networks emphasize the importance of analyzing spectra as a group , which significantly increases both the number of identified spectra and their confidence .
nevertheless , we acknowledge that spectra that do not group into spectral networks or subnetworks which lack a seed annotation are currently not suitable for spectral networks analysis .
missing seeds may be because of database or search tool limitations , and using several tools ( including spectral networks de novo sequencing approaches ( 42 )) or expanded databases may help address the problem .
however , in our multi - species analysis , we note that a significant portion of unidentified subnetworks consisted of spectra from multi - species and contained variant pairs ( supplemental fig. s8 ) , strongly suggesting that these unidentified subnetworks contain novel peptides that are still missing from the database .
the properties of unidentified subnetworks are similar to those of annotated subnetworks .
recent developments in high mass accuracy tandem mass spectrometry ( e.g. hcd ) have significantly improved spectrum identification performance by reducing the chance of randomly matching fragment ion peaks ( 43 ) .
our approach also supports the analysis of various types of high mass accuracy ms / ms data ( see software implementation under experimental procedures ) , and users can specify low tolerances for fragment ion masses according to the instrument accuracy .
although the data analyzed here was not obtained using high mass accuracy ms / ms , previous spectral networks approaches have been applied to such types of data and similar gains ( 44 ) are expected when applying the current approach to high mass accuracy ms / ms. although current approach was based on the similarity in fragmentation pattern between ms / ms spectra within the specified mass difference , the utilization of additional information could further improve the performance of spectral alignment .
for example , although we allowed any mass of modifications to search for all known and even possibly unknown types of modifications at once , more targeted analysis could be performed by allowing only user - defined modifications or all modification types known in unimod database ( http :// www.unimod.org ) .
this could filter out many incorrect spectral alignments whereas possibly increasing the confidence of modified peptide identifications .
retention time differences ( 39 , 45 ) could also be used to potentially reduce incorrect spectral alignments .
finally , the impact of multiplexed spectra causing incorrect grouping of spectra into mixed networks could also be potentially improved by investing and thresholding precursor ion fraction ( 37 ) , defined as the fraction of the targeted precursor ion in the ms / ms isolation window .

we have characterized the dissolution state of microcrystalline cellulose ( mcc ) in aqueous tetrabutylammonium hydroxide , tbah ( aq ) , at different concentrations of tbah , by means of turbidity and small - angle x - ray scattering .
the solubility of cellulose increases with increasing tbah concentration , which is consistent with solubilization driven by neutralization .
when comparing the two polymorphs , the solubility of cellulose i is higher than that of cellulose ii. this has the consequence that the dissolution of mcc ( cellulose i ) may create a supersaturated solution with respect to cellulose ii. as for the dissolution state of cellulose , we identify three different regimes .
( i ) in the stable regime , corresponding to concentrations below the solubility of cellulose ii , cellulose is molecularly dissolved and the solutions are thermodynamically stable .
( ii ) in the metastable regime , corresponding to lower supersaturations with respect to cellulose ii , a minor aggregation of cellulose occurs and the solutions are kinetically stable .
( iii ) in the unstable regime , corresponding to larger supersaturations , there is macroscopic precipitation of cellulose ii from solution .
finally , we also discuss strong alkali solvents in general and compare tbah ( aq ) with the classical naoh ( aq ) solvent .

introduction cellulose is the main structuring component in the cell wall of plants and the most abundant biopolymer in the world [ 1 ] .
it is a linear polymer formed by the repetition of d - glucose building blocks , and the crystal structure of the native cellulose ( cellulose i ) has been described by a monoclinic unit cell containing two cellulose chains in a parallel orientation [ 2 ] .
cellulose may occur also in other polymorphs [ 3 ] , of which cellulose ii is the most thermodynamically stable , and can be obtained via regeneration from solution .
associated with numerous applications , e.g. in papermaking and biofuel industries and even as a textile fibre , the usage of this vastly available polysaccharide instead of traditional resources may lead to lower dependencies on fossil fuels and water supplies and thus a lower impact on the environment .
however , to be able to successfully make use of the many benefits of the cellulose polymer , the latter must first be dissolved in a suitable solvent , a problem that has been fraught with many difficulties due to tedious dissolution mechanisms and environmentally hazardous solvents .
despite its polar structure , cellulose is well known to have an extremely low solubility in water , due to the presence of an extended network of hydrogen bonds and , as recent studies underlined , hydrophobic interactions [ 4 - 7 ] .
such solubility can be enhanced by decreasing or increasing the ph [ 8,9 ] .
for instance , it has latterly been established that basic solvents containing hydroxide ions may increase the dissolution strength thanks to the strong proton acceptor properties of the hydroxide anion [ 10 ] , but the exact mechanism of the dissolution is as yet not clearly known .
a common solvent for cellulose dissolution has up to now been sodium hydroxide ; however , the conditions for dissolution must be stringently controlled [ 11 ] .
recent studies have highlighted ionic liquids ( i.e. salts that are liquid at room temperature ) for the dissolution process [ 12 ] , and among them tetrabutylammonium hydroxide ( tbah ) [ 13 - 16 ] , a highly basic , low - viscous ionic liquid , commercially available solvated in different weight percentages of water , tbah ( aq ) .
at temperatures above 27degreesc , this mixture adopts a purely liquid phase , but at lower temperatures the water molecules form clathrate cages , leading to crystallization [ 17,18 ] .
the peculiarities yet strengths of tbah as a solvent [ 13 ] make it a good candidate for the dissolution of cellulose in , for example , the fibre wet spinning process .
moreover , as water is commonly used as a coagulation bath in the said process , the study of the phase boundaries of the cellulose / tbah / water system becomes crucial for the understanding of the fibre formation process .
the aim of this work is to investigate the stability and metastability of solutions containing cellulose in tbah ( aq ) using turbidity and small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) , which give information on the solution stability and the structure at nanometre length scale , respectively .
the samples studied in this work range between 0.01 and 0.10 g cm - 3 microcrystalline cellulose ( mcc ) in 15 - 55 wt % aqueous solutions of tbah .
furthermore , wide - angle x - ray scattering ( waxs ) was used to characterize the regenerated cellulose , including fibres obtained by extrusion using a step - motor - driven syringe pump .
this work was thought to extend the study on the stability of mcc in tbah ( aq ) .
in our previous research [ 14,15 ] , mcc was dissolved in a wide concentration range ( 0.001 - 0.10 g cm - 3 ) in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) , and two different concentration regimes were highlighted , where molecularly dissolved cellulose chains and aggregates were detected at low and high concentrations , respectively .
in the present paper , we have extended our studies to a higher tbah concentration , as well as characterizing solution structure and stability when diluting with water , identifying stable , metastable and unstable solution regimes .
2. material and methods 2.1 .
materials mcc ( c. lofgren 2015 , personal communication ) was purchased from sigma ( avicel ph - 101 , dp = 260 , particle size 50 microm ) and tbah ( aq ) , originally 40 and 55 wt % in water , was obtained from sigma - aldrich .
2.2 .
sample preparation different concentrations of mcc in 40 and 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) were prepared by weighing the proper amount of tbah ( aq ) , transferring it to a glass vial , and adding the cellulose as a last step to avoid sedimentation and clumping at the bottom of the vial .
the solvent bottle was prewarmed at 40degreesc for approximately 1 min prior to weighing to prevent clathrate formation .
after the addition of cellulose , the vial was immediately put on vigorous stirring , yielding solutions of various viscosities depending on cellulose concentration .
the dissolution time also varied depending on cellulose concentration , on average from approximately 3 - 5 min ( 0.01 - 0.07 g cm - 3 ) to 1 - 2 h ( 0.07 - 0.10 g cm - 3 ) .
lower concentrations of tbah were prepared by diluting the 40 wt % tbah aqueous solution with milli - q water before the addition of cellulose .
the samples containing 0.01 - 0.06 g cm - 3 regenerated cellulose were prepared by the dilution of a 0.06 g cm - 3 regenerated cellulose solution with tbah ( aq ) .
2.3 .
regeneration of cellulose cellulose was regenerated from a solution of 0.02 g cm - 3 mcc in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
one hundred ml of solution was prepared as described above in the sample preparation section , and washed with milli - q water and consequently centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm and 20degreesc for 5 times .
the system was subsequently freeze - dried to give 1.62 g of cellulose powder , with a yield of 82 % .
the obtained cellulose was identified as cellulose ii via waxs ( see results and discussion section ) .
2.4 .
turbidity data were collected using a cary winuv spectrophotometer , at 30 +/ - 1degreesc with lambda = 632.8 nm. measurements of the transmittance were zeroed for the solvent and taken every 15 s for 60 min .
plastic cuvettes with a path length of 1 cm were used .
samples containing 0.02 g cm - 3 cellulose in tbah ( aq ) concentrations ranging from 15 to 40 wt % were prepared by adding milli - q water to readily prepared solutions of mcc in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) until the required concentrations were obtained and the measurements started within 1 min and lasted for 60 min .
samples of regenerated cellulose ( cellulose ii ) in the concentration range 0.01 - 0.06 g cm - 3 in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) were measured within 24 h after preparation .
cellulose showed no absorption at said wavelength , hence the measured transmittance t was considered due only to scattering , and gives the turbidity tau as 2.1 tau = - ln tl , where l is the path length .
2.5 .
small - and wide - angle x - ray scattering saxs and waxs measurements were performed using a laboratory - based ganesha instrument ( saxslab a / s ) .
the instrument was arranged with a two - pinhole set - up using scatterless slits and the x - rays were generated in a micro - focus source with lambda = 1.54 a. the scattered light was detected on a two - dimensional pilatus detector .
all liquid samples were measured at 30degreesc in quartz capillaries to avoid the formation of tbah ( aq ) clathrates , and all experiments were performed in vacuo .
the saxs data were collected using two different configurations of the instrument , allowing the scattering spectrum to be collected over a broad q - range , 0.003 - 0.6 a - 1 .
the waxs experiments were performed using a third configuration , with a q - range over 0.3 - 3 a - 1 , on mcc and regenerated cellulose powder and on the regenerated cellulose filaments .
the scattering vector q is defined as 2.2 q = 4pilambdasin ( theta2 ) , with theta being the scattering angle .
for dilute solutions , the saxs intensity can be written as 2.3 i ( q )= cdeltarho2mwrhoc2nap ( q ) s ( q ) .
here , c denotes the cellulose concentration ( g cm - 3 ) , deltarho = 4.0 x 1010 cm - 2 is the scattering length density difference between cellulose and the solvent , mw is the weight average cellulose molecular weight , rhoc the cellulose density and na the avogadro number .
p ( q ) is the form factor and s ( q ) the structure factor .
2.6 .
fibre extrusion the fibre extrusion set - up consisted of a custom - built step - motor - driven syringe pump system with two independently controlled motors ( figure 1 ) .
the pump set - up was originally designed for microfluidic experiments by silva et al .
[ 19 ] .
one pump was used in the conventional way , driving the solution out of a syringe ( 500 microl , hamilton gastight ) into a needle ( gauge 21 , 0.5 mm in diameter ) via a flexible tube ( tygon formulation s - 54 - hl , 1 mm diameter ) with a controllable flow rate q. the needle was fixed to a metal arm in a way that the needle tip was submerged in a water bath .
the other end of the metal arm was attached to the pushing block of the other pump .
this allowed for a controlled motion of the needle tip within the translational motion range of the pump pushing block ( 50 mm ) .
for the extrusion of cellulose fibre , the needle tip was repetitively moved back and forth , while the cellulose solution was pumped through the needle tip .
this produced a cellulose solution bundle of connected strands in the water bath that precipitated after a few minutes , forming a ( wet ) fibre bundle .
this fibre bundle was left in the water bath for approximately 30 min to wash out the solvent .
afterwards , it was taken out of the water bath and dried at room conditions for several hours .
the dried fibre bundle was then stored in an eppendorf vial before performing scattering experiments .
in the no stretching case , the velocity of the moving pushing block vpb was equal to the average fluid velocity in the needle , vfluid = q / a , where a is the cross - sectional area of the needle .
for stretching with a factor f , vpb = f vfluid .
the flow rate q in all experiments reported here was 10 microl min - 1 .

the motion of the pushing blocks during the experiments is indicated by the red arrows .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
cellulose in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) we have , in two recent publications [ 14,15 ] , characterized not only the dissolution state of mcc , but also dissolving pulp in 40 wt % tbah .
the main conclusions from these papers can be summarized as follows .
( i ) mcc is molecularly soluble below approximately 0.04 g cm - 3 , as seen by saxs .
( ii ) for higher concentrations , up to 0.10 g cm - 3 , saxs data showed increasing amounts of aggregation .
assuming that cellulose i ( mcc ) has a higher solubility than cellulose ii , it was proposed that the dissolution of mcc may create a supersaturated state with respect to cellulose ii resulting in aggregation .
interestingly , the aggregates in this concentration regime appear to be kinetically stable .
no coarsening was observed within days .
the onset of aggregation at approximately 0.04 g cm - 3 was ascribed to the solubility of cellulose ii .
3.2 .
cellulose in 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) saxs experiments were performed on 0.01 - 0.10 g cm - 3 mcc in 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
the absolute scaled saxs patterns , normalized by the cellulose concentration , are shown in figure 2a .
figure 2 .
( a ) saxs patterns for 0.01 - 0.10 g cm - 3 mcc solutions in 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
the data are on absolute scale , normalized by cellulose concentration .
solid black lines are model calculations ( see text ) .
( b ) seff ( 0 ) versus cellulose concentration for 40 and 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) solutions .
seff ( 0 ) values from the 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) system ( filled circles ) are obtained from the saxs data analysis ( see text ) .
data from the 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) system ( open circles ) are taken from [ 9 ] .
the solid line represents a rgt model prediction ( see text ) .
in the whole range of concentration , the curves exhibit a characteristic feature centred at 0.35 a - 1 , as already reported for 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) [ 14 ] .
as the concentration of cellulose is increased , a progressive downturn at low q - value is observed , with the normalized intensity decreased by approximately one order of magnitude for the analysed concentration range. from such downturn , it is possible to infer the presence of effectively repulsive interactions in the system , which were observed for the 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) system only below a cellulose concentration of approximately 0.04 g cm - 3 [ 14 ] .
only at 0.10 g cm - 3 , a slight upturn of the intensity at low q - values is notable , indicating the onset of aggregation .
we identify this concentration as the solubility of cellulose ii. when the concentration of tbah is increased from 40 to 55 wt % , the solubility of cellulose is increased .
as for the 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) solutions [ 14,15 ] , the scattering patterns were modelled using the form factor of a semi - flexible chain with excluded volume interactions , combined with that of a stiff rod within the persistence length .
such model was implemented considering a core - - shell cross section of the latter to describe the feature at 0.35 a - 1 , which was interpreted as due to a first solvation shell around the cellulose chain enriched in tbah compared to the bulk solvent .
to describe the repulsive interactions among the polymer chains in solution , a structure factor s ( q ) that considers random phase approximation [ 20,21 ] was taken into account : 3.1 s ( q )=( 1 + nup ( q )) - 1 , with nu being the interaction parameter .
the model parameters used to calculate the scattering intensity were contour length l = 1.81 x 103 a , persistence length lambdap = 20 a and nu ranging from 1.6 to 20 for the different cellulose concentrations .
the calculated seff ( 0 )=( 1 + nu ) - 1 values are reported as a function of cellulose concentration in figure 2b .
in the thermodynamic limit at q = 0 , the structure factor is proportional to the osmotic compressibility and is a measure of the effective interchain interactions .
for semi - diluted polymer solutions , the dependence of seff ( 0 ) as a function of polymer concentration has been calculated by ohta et al. using renormalization group theory ( rgt ) [ 22,23 ] : 3.2 seff ( 0 ) - 1 = 1 + 18 ( 9x - 2 + 2ln ( 1 + x ) x ) exp ( 14 [ 1x +( 1 - 1x2 ) ln ( 1 + x ) ]) , where x , for polydisperse polymers , is given by 3.3 x = b2cmw9 / 16 - ( ln ( mw / mn )/ 8 ) , where c is the cellulose concentration , mw and mn are weight and number averaged cellulose molecular weights , respectively , and b2 is the second virial coefficient .
for excluded volume interactions [ 24 ] , the latter can be written as 3.4 b2 = 4pi3 / 2narg3mw2psi , where rg is the radius of gyration and psi is the degree of chain interpenetration , which depends on interactions and can hence be estimated .
psi equals 0 for theta - conditions , while it approaches the value 0.24 for good solvents [ 25 ]. from the modelling of the seff ( 0 ) trend as a function of concentration using the rgt , we estimated a psi of approximately 0.17 and b2 of 1.2 x 10 - 3 cm3 g - 2 , with b2 > 0 being an indication of repulsive cellulose - cellulose interactions in solution .
figure 2b compares the so obtained values with the ones calculated elsewhere [ 15 ] for 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
the overall trend of the previously studied system showed a change in the type of interactions in solution , highlighting the presence of two regimes ( repulsive interactions below a concentration of 0.02 g cm - 3 , attractive interactions above 0.04 g cm - 3 ) .
for the higher concentration of tbah , the whole studied cellulose concentration range lies in the same regime , and a neat improvement of the solvent quality is observed when going from the low cellulose concentrations in 40 wt % ( estimated as psi = 0.04 and b2 = 6.7 x 10 - 4 cm3 g - 2 ) [ 8 ] to 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
3.3 .
the solubility of cellulose in tbah ( aq ) assessing the solubility of cellulose in a solvent is non - trivial .
first , we need to distinguish between the different cellulose crystalline polymorphs , mainly cellulose i and cellulose ii [ 14,15 ] .
then there is the general problem that the cellulose source is typically highly polydisperse .
nevertheless , having a number for the cellulose solubility is useful , but it is necessary to take a pragmatic approach and accept that the numbers quoted are essentially estimates .
to determine the solubility of mcc ( cellulose i ) , mcc was gradually added to a tbah ( aq ) solution until no more mcc was able to dissolve and the solution remained turbid with undissolved material .
the results are presented as an effective solubility curve in figure 3 .
the solubility increases with increasing tbah concentration .
for less than or equal to 20 wt % tbah , the mcc solubility is practically zero .
at 30 wt % tbah , it is approximately 0.002 g cm - 3 and increases to 0.01 g cm - 3 in 35 wt % tbah .
then in 40 and 55 wt % tbah , the solubility appears to be larger than 0.10 g cm - 3 .

the blue dashed line is the estimated effective solubility of cellulose i ( mcc ) .
the solid black curve represents the estimated solubility curve of cellulose ii. in the same way , we also determined the solubility of cellulose ii. such solubility was estimated to be 0.02 g cm - 3 in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) , and 0.10 g cm - 3 in 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
to further prove the findings obtained by saxs , the solubility of cellulose ii in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) was inferred by using light microscopy ( see electronic supplementary material , figure s1 ) and turbidity measurements ( figure 4 ) .

turbidity values averaged over 10 min for 0.005 - 0.05 g cm - 3 regenerated cellulose ( cellulose ii ) solution in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) .

3.4 .
coagulation in water cellulose can be coagulated from tbah ( aq ) solutions by diluting with water .
samples of different cellulose concentrations in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) were gradually diluted with water until the sample turned highly turbid and a macroscopic precipitation of cellulose was observed .
the sample compositions marking the onset of macroscopic precipitation are presented in figure 3 .
typically , macroscopic precipitation occurs when the tbah concentration decreases below approximately 23 wt % .
we refer to the region where macroscopic precipitation occurs as the unstable region ( u ) .
the stability of cellulose solutions at different tbah concentrations ( 15 - 40 wt %) was also investigated by turbidity experiments at a constant cellulose concentration of 0.02 g cm - 3 .
samples of different concentrations of cellulose in 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) were diluted with water until a cellulose concentration of 0.02 g cm - 3 was reached .
the turbidity values of the diluted samples were recorded for a period of 1 h. in figure 5a , we have plotted the average turbidity , recorded during the 1 h time period as a function of the tbah concentration .
the change in contrast , due to changes in the solvent composition , is corrected for by normalizing the turbidity values with the square of the refractive index increment , ( dn / dc ) 2 .
the individual turbidity traces are shown in the inset of figure 5a .

( a ) turbidity values averaged over 60 min normalized for the increment of the refractive index for solutions of 2 wt % mcc in 15 - 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
the dashed line is a guide for the eye .
inset : turbidity time trends over 60 min for the same samples .
( b ) saxs data on absolute scale obtained for 0.020 g cm - 3 mcc solutions in 20 - 40 wt % tbah ( aq ). from 40 down to 25 wt % tbah , there is a significant , but relatively minor increase of the normalized turbidity , indicating gradual aggregation of cellulose .
the aggregation was confirmed by saxs .
in figure 5b , we present saxs data of samples varying the tbah concentration between 20 and 40 wt % .
the increase in the scattering intensity at lower q - values is a clear demonstration of cellulose aggregation .
decreasing the tbah concentration below 24 wt % , a steeper increase in turbidity is observed , and is consistent with an increased aggregation and a transition to unstable solutions .
at 40 wt % tbah , the 0.02 g cm - 3 cellulose is below the solubility of cellulose ii and the solution is stable .
lowering the tbah concentration , we reduce the cellulose ii solubility below 0.02 g cm - 3 , and this results in aggregation .
however , macroscopic precipitation does not occur .
as seen in the inset of figure 5a , the turbidity has after dilution quickly reached a stable value that does not vary during the 1 h experiment .
we identify the aggregated samples in this region as metastable ( m ) or kinetically stable .
at 15 wt % tbah , however , we observe a variation of turbidity in time .
first , the turbidity increases indicating continued aggregation or coarsening .
then , at longer times , the turbidity decreases , possibly due to the sedimentation in the sample .
we discuss in more detail below the significance of stable , metastable and unstable solutions .
3.5 .
regeneration of cellulose and fibre extrusion the increase of water content in the solutions leads to the precipitation of cellulose , also referred to as regeneration in the fibre spinning process .
waxs was used to characterize such precipitates , and the waxs pattern of precipitated cellulose is reported in figure 6a , together with that of the starting material , mcc .
peaks centred at different q - values are observed for the two patterns , highlighting different packings of the cellulose chains in the crystalline structures .
comparing the peak positions with the one given by the literature [ 26 - 28 ] , it is possible to infer that the starting material has , as expected , the fingerprint of cellulose i , with the characteristic peak centred at 1.05 a - 1 , while the process of regeneration facilitates the formation of cellulose ii. figure 6 .

( b ) two - dimensional waxs patterns of direct precipitate , non - stretched fibre and stretched fibre ( left to right ) .
the fibres were aligned in the vertical direction ( y ) .
regeneration is of importance for the production of cellulose fibres .
in this process , the cellulose solution is injected through a mesh into a coagulation bath in a controlled way .
subsequent pulling on the other end leads to elongated precipitates that after drying constitute the cellulose fibres .
the experimental set - up described in the material and methods section is a means of mimicking this process on a smaller scale with the advantage of a lower amount of required sample .
to show its feasibility fibres with two different stretch factors , f = 1 ( no stretching ) and f = 3.5 ( stretching ) , have been produced .
in figure 6a,b , the one - dimensional and two - dimensional waxs scattering patterns for both fibres are depicted , respectively .
as expected , both patterns are more or less identical in shape and coincide with the one of cellulose ii precipitate described in the previous section .
it is notable that narrower signals are obtained for the fibres in comparison with the precipitated cellulose , and this is an indication of the higher crystallinity of the fibres .
in summary , we have shown that this new technique is suitable for producing fibres with a significant content of cellulose ii. therefore , this technique seems to provide an easy and quick way to check on the precipitation of cellulose into fibres , in a more controlled way than the injection with a syringe of the spin dope by hand in the coagulation bath .
3.6 .
stable , metastable and unstable cellulose solutions figure 3 represents a stability map that summarizes the conclusions from our study on the dissolution state of cellulose ( mcc ) at various tbah ( aq ) concentrations .
an important basis for our understanding of this system is the relative stability of the two polymorphs cellulose i ( native cellulose ) and cellulose ii , generally formed when cellulose is regenerated , i.e. recrystallized from solution .
cellulose i is less stable compared to cellulose ii , and hence has a higher molecular solubility .
this has the consequence that cellulose i , i.e. mcc , may dissolve while creating a supersaturated solution with respect to cellulose ii , if the concentration is above the solubility of cellulose ii. in such a supersaturated solution , cellulose aggregates as cellulose ii. estimated solubility curves for cellulose i and cellulose ii are shown in figure 3 .
we can define three different regimes , corresponding to stable ( s ) , metastable ( m ) and unstable ( u ) cellulose solutions .
in the stable regime , corresponding to cellulose concentrations below the solubility of cellulose ii , cellulose is molecularly dissolved and the solutions are thermodynamically stable .
for concentrations above the solubility of cellulose ii , there is a metastable regime .
here , there is aggregation of cellulose , but no complete precipitation .
in fact , we observe a steady state where the aggregation is finite and the solutions are kinetically stable .
we ascribe this steady state to the very complex process of polymer crystallization [ 29,30 ] .
our observations are consistent with the suggestion that polymer crystallization , in contrast with the crystallization of small molecules , involves multiple free energy barriers and hence multiple metastable states [ 29,30 ] .
finally , for lower tbah concentrations , there is an unstable regime where there is a massive aggregation and macroscopic precipitation of cellulose .
solutions of different concentrations of cellulose in 40 wt % tbah were gradually diluted with water .
at a certain point of dilution , macroscopic precipitation of cellulose was observed , marking the onset of instability .
here , the supersaturation is sufficiently large so that the system cannot be trapped in a metastable state .
3.7 .
on cellulose solubility in strong alkali finally , we briefly discuss cellulose solubility in strong alkali , and why tbah ( aq ) appears to be a much better cellulose solvent compared to , for example , naoh ( aq ) .
owing to its stable crystalline state , cellulose is insoluble in water and other common solvents , from polar to non - polar , and there are only a limited number of solvents / solutions known to solubilize cellulose .
being insoluble in , for example , water means that the free energy of dissolution , deltagd > 0 .
in order for cellulose to go into solutions thus requires an additional process having a sufficiently negative free energy change .
for aqueous systems , it has been known for more than a century that strong alkali is able to dissolve cellulose , and is an important component in the viscose process .
strong alkali may dissolve cellulose , because it offers a neutralization step with a negative free energy change , deltagn < 0 .
the pka of glucose and similar sugars is approximately 12.5 - 13.5 [ 31 ] , and we expect similar values for cellulose although we need to take into account polyacid effects .
the titration of cellobiose was recently demonstrated by electrophoretic nmr [ 10 ] .
titrating cellulose results in a negatively charged polyelectrolyte where the electrostatic potential increases slightly the pka .
hence , cellulose - oh groups display a range of pka values , not only because of the different sites along the polymer but also because of the polyacid effect .
nevertheless , if the ph is sufficiently high , higher than typical pka values , there is sufficient neutralization and corresponding negative deltagn to compensate for deltagd > 0 , so that for the combined process , deltag = deltagd + deltagn < 0 .
this view implies that cellulose solubility increases with increasing ph , which is consistent with our findings that cellulose is more soluble in 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) compared to 40 wt % tbah ( aq ) .
concentrated naoh ( aq ) is a classical cellulose solvent .
however , cellulose can only be solubilized within a narrow concentration interval of naoh .
typically , cellulose can be solubilized in 2 m naoh ( aq ) but not in 1 m and not in 3 m. this narrow solubility window can be understood as follows .
at lower naoh concentrations , deltagn is not sufficiently negative and the solution is unstable with respect to cellulose i that cannot dissolve .
at higher naoh concentrations , on the other hand , cellulose precipitates in the form of polyelectrolyte sodium salts [ 5 ] .
here , we have to consider the solubility product ks = [ cellulose ][ na +] n , where n is the effective valency of the cellulose ion .
as n is typically a high number , this implies that the solubility of the sodium salt decreases strongly with increasing naoh concentration .
as a consequence , solubilizing cellulose is only possible within a narrow window of naoh concentrations .
replacing the small na + ions with the bulky tba + has the important consequence of destabilizing the cellulose salt crystal .
tba + is too bulky to fit properly into a crystalline lattice , which is also why many tba + salts , in fact , are ionic liquids .
4. conclusion mcc solutions in tbah ( aq ) at various concentrations of cellulose and tbah were studied by means of turbidity and saxs techniques .
as a first result , 55 wt % tbah ( aq ) was found to solubilize cellulose in larger amounts than the more diluted solvent , 40 wt % .
moreover , a stability map of the cellulose / tbah / water system was developed .
stable solutions of cellulose were obtained for cellulose concentrations below the solubility of cellulose ii , the most stable crystalline polymorph .
microscopic precipitate , i.e. aggregates , which indicates the metastability of the system , was detected as soon as the solubility curve of cellulose ii was crossed .
instability , i.e. the massive crystalliztion of cellulose , led to the presence of macroscopic precipitate , and occurred with a further decrease in the cellulose concentration .
such regenerated cellulose was characterized by waxs , and the analysis was led further using a custom - built step - motor - driven syringe pump system to mimic the wet spinning process on a small scale , as a first example of a laboratory - scale method for scanning the properties of spinning dopes in fibre formation processes and an easy way to check the properties of regenerated fibres .
the question of the reason for the solubility of cellulose in tbah ( aq ) was also addressed , and the combination of high ph , which favours the deprotonation of the cellulose chains , and the bulkiness of the tba + cation , which hinders precipitation and crystallization , seems to be the key point for the effectiveness of tbah ( aq ) in solubilizing cellulose .

introduction bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) thereby acting as an angiogenesis inhibitor .
as a result , supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues is impaired and tumour cell growth is reduced .
reported side effects due to bevacizumab are hypertension and increased risk of bleeding .
bowel perforation has also been reported .
periodontal disease in patients on bevacizumab therapy has not been reported before .
case presentation we report a case of a forty - three year old woman who developed periodontitis whilst receiving bevacizumab for lung cancer .
the periodontal disease remained stable on discontinuation of the drug .
conclusion further investigations are needed to determine the mechanism for bevacizumab - induced periodontal disease .
introduction bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) thereby acting as an angiogenesis inhibitor and preventing the formation of new blood vessels , including those that surround and supply cancer cells .
as a result , supply of oxygen and nutrients to tissues is impaired and tumour cell growth is reduced .
cancerous tumours may become slower growing or even smaller .
it is this property that has found non - oncological uses for bevacizumab as its anti - angiogenesis effect has been useful in the treatment of proliferative ( neovascular ) eye diseases , particularly age - related macular degeneration [ 1 - 4 ] .
reported side effects due to bevacizumab are hypertension and increased risk of bleeding .
bowel perforation has also been reported [ 5 - 8 ] .
periodontal diseases range from simple gum inflammation to serious disease that results in major damage to the soft tissue and bone that support the teeth .
risk factors for the development of periodontal disease are smoking , hormonal changes in women , poor nutrition resulting in deficiencies in calcium and certain vitamins ( especially vitamins b and c ) , diabetes , gingivitis , stress , immunosuppressive illnesses , genetic susceptibility and certain medications ( including chemotherapy drugs and those that reduce the production of saliva such as antidepressants , antihistamines , antiepileptics , and calcium channel blockers ) .
[ 9,10 ] .
previous studies have shown increased levels of vegf in gingival and gingival crevicular fluid in patients with periodontitis , in keeping with an inflammatory process induced by periodontopathogens , with neovascularisation causing swelling and oedema [ 11,12 ] .
it is possible that vegf levels are high in an attempt to stimulate angiogenesis and facilitate healing .
regeneration of periodontal structures lost during periodontal disease is regulated by , among other things , interactions between cells and growth factors .
case presentation a 43 year old lady presented in 2005 with wheeze , shortness of breath and pain in the right back .
she had no other symptoms of note and was an ex - smoker .
the patient had had an ovarian cystectomy in 2004 which was complicated by fistula formation requiring several laparotomies .
at bronchoscopy , obstruction by a large right middle lobe tumour was noted and biopsy confirmed an adenocarcinoma .
subsequent pet - ct scanning revealed extensive soft tissue abnormalities in the right paravertebral region posteriorly and lymphadenopathy in the subcarinal , contralateral and pretracheal regions .
the final staging was t2n3m0 ( iiib ) .
the patient was enrolled in the avail trial ( avastin in lung cancer - trial no .
bo17704 ) - a study in which the primary objective is to evaluate safety and efficacy of two doses of bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin and determine the optimal dose of bevacizumab .
the trial is a randomised , double - blind , multicentre , 2 - stage , phase iii study of bevacizumab and gemcitabine / cisplatin versus placebo and gemcitabine / cisplatin in patients with advanced or recurrent non - small cell lung carcinoma who have not received prior chemotherapy .
the patient was randomised to receive gemcitabine / cisplatin and bevacizumab on the maintenance arm .
five cycles of treatment ( carboplatin was substituted for cisplatin at cycle 3 due to toxicity ) were completed in march 2006 with partial response .
at cycle 6 ( eighteen weeks into treatment ) , marked gum recession was noted ( fig 1 ) .
the patient was then unblinded and found to be on the continuation arm of bevacizumab .
treatment was continued with no interventions and the patient remained entirely asymptomatic .
figure 1 periodontal disease noted at cycle 6 of bevacizumab ( 18 weeks into treatment ) .
in september 2006 ( ten months after commencing treatment ) , the patient was noted to have worsening periodontal disease ( fig 2 ) .
she had completed 18 cycles of bevacizumab at this stage .
the patient completed treatment in december 2006 and the periodontal disease has since remained stable .
figure 2 worsening periodontal disease at cycle 18 of bevacizumab ( 10 months into treatment ) .
this case is , to the best of our knowledge , the first reported of a patient developing periodontal disease whilst receiving bevacizumab .
although it would be difficult to exclude all other risk factors in this patient , the onset of periodontal disease on commencement of bevacizumab and the fact that the disease remained stable on discontinuation of the drug points to this as the cause .
conclusion in this case , one might expect low plasma levels of vegf with the use of bevacizumab .
it is possible that , as an angiogenesis inhibitor , bevacizumab prevents the formation of new blood vessels , resulting in a lack of supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues .
this may result in ischaemia and necrosis ( consequently inhibiting reversal of the process and impairing wound healing ) .
further investigations are therefore needed to determine the mechanism for bevacizumab - induced periodontal disease .

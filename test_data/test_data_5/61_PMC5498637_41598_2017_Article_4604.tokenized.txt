the presence of acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) confers a poor prognosis in atrial fibrillation ( af ) , associated with increased mortality dramatically .
this study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores for ami in patients with af. this retrospective study enrolled 5140 consecutive nonvalvular af patients , 300 patients with ami and 4840 patients without ami .
we identified the optimal cut - off values of the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores each based on receiver operating characteristic curves to predict the risk of ami .
both chads2 score and cha2ds2 - vasc score were associated with an increased odds ratio of the prevalence of ami in patients with af , after adjustment for hyperlipidaemia , hyperuricemia , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and obstructive sleep apnea .
the present results showed that the area under the curve ( auc ) for chads2 score was 0.787 with a similar accuracy of the cha2ds2 - vasc score ( auc 0.750 ) in predicting " high - risk " af patients who developed ami .
however , the predictive accuracy of the two clinical - based risk scores was fair .
the cha2ds2 - vasc score has fair predictive value for identifying high - risk patients with af and is not significantly superior to chads2 in predicting patients who develop ami .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction atrial fibrillation ( af ) is a common cardiac rhythm disturbance with an age - related increase in both women and men .
the arrhythmia is also a major cardiac cause of stroke1 .
given that af has become a major cardiovascular challenge in the last two decades , it is crucial to have an updated picture of its medical , social and economic impact of af to plan appropriate interventions2 .
the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scoring systems have been proved efficacy to stratify stroke and thromboembolism risk in patients with non - valvular af ( nvaf ) .
according to recent large clinical trials , patients identified as high - risk category using the chads2 score comprise many af patients at risk of fatal and devastating strokes .
thus , the cha2ds2 - vasc score is recommended by current major guidelines to identify the " truly low - risk patients " with af3 .
except for preventing stroke in af patients , the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores have been reported recently to predict cardiovascular4 and cerebrovascular events5 .
coronary artery disease ( cad ) and af have close relationship and interact with each other .
cad is considered a risk factor for af as well as a disease for which the adverse outcome is modulated by af. reports from several clinical trials have proved that af is associated with an increased risk of incident mi6 - 8 .
furthermore , the coexistence of the two diseases increases the risk of future cardiovascular events and stroke dramatically9 .
subsequently , the number and complexity of therapies increase and the potential for significant adverse interactions grow .
in addition , cad and stroke share a number of common cardiovascular risk factors , including sex , age , obesity , hypertension , diabetes mellitus ( dm ) , and congestive heart failure ( chf ) .
identification of high - risk af patients is a needed first step to develop cost - effective approaches for prevention of cad .
for example , ankle - brachial index ( abi ) is a non - invasive tool in evaluating cardiovascular risk , useful in predicting mi in nvaf patients10 .
the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores include similar risk factors for the development of cad .
therefore , unsurprisingly , there have been recent reports about the two stroke risk scoring systems used to predict severity or even outcome of cad11 .
most previous studies mainly focused on af after cad and demonstrated af adversely influences the outcomes in patients with cad .
however , studies concerned with the cardiovascular risk stratification and identification af patients at higher risk to experience acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) using the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores are relatively sparse .
the objective of our study was to investigate the predictive value of chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores for ami risk in af , and subsequently compare the accuracy of the chads2 score with cha2ds2 - vasc score in predicting the ami incidence .
subjects and methods this was a retrospective study based on electronic hospital databases of our hospital .
this study enrolled 5140 consecutive patients with nvaf who presented to our department of cardiology from november 2013 to october 2016 .
the definition of nvaf was in accordance with 2014 aha / acc / hrs guideline for the management of patients with af1 .
patients were excluded if they had rheumatic mitral stenosis , a mechanical or bioprosthetic heart valve , or mitral valve repair , and death in hospital .
to be eligible for our study , ami was comprised of st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) and non - stemi within the previous 30 days .
the following information was collected from the database : age , gender , history of cad , chf , hypertension , dm , stroke or transient ischemic attack ( tia ) , thromboembolism , vascular disease ( including prior myocardial infarction , peripheral artery disease , or complex aortic plaque ) , hyperlipidaemia , hyperuricemia , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and obstructive sleep apnea ( osa ). from the baseline clinical characteristics of each patient , the pre - ami chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores were calculated according to the esc guidelines for the management of af12 .
the study was approved by the research ethics committee of xuzhou central hospital and all patients provided their written informed consent .
all methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations .
statistical analysis quantitative variables are expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation for parametric variables and were analyzed using the independent - samples t test .
in addition , nonparametric variables are presented as median with interquartile ranges .
categorical variables are expressed as numbers and percentages , and were compared using the chi - square test .
the relationships between chads2 score and ami rate as well as the relationships between cha2ds2 - vasc score and ami rate were examined by kruskal - wallis non - parametric h test .
the multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of the baseline clinical characteristics , chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores with the prevalence of ami , respectively .
we identified the optimal cut - off values of the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores each based on receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves to predict the risk of ami .
the area under the curve ( auc ) is a rough guide for quantifying the discriminatory capacity of a diagnostic test ranked as : excellent ( 0.9 - 1 ) , good ( 0.8 - 0.89 ) , fair ( 0.7 - 0.79 ) , poor ( 0.6 - 0.69 ) , or fail / no discriminatory capacity ( 0.5 - 0.59 ) 13 .
the differences between the areas under the two roc curves were assessed by a univariate z - score test .
the agreement on identification of ami risk determined by the two scores was tested by the cohen 's kappa coefficient ( kappa ) and mcnemar test was used to compare the differences in risk .
the agreement of kappa 0.81 - 1.00 is interpreted as almost perfect agreement , 0.61 - 0.80 as substantial agreement , 0.41 - 0.60 as moderate agreement , 0.21 - 0.40 as fair agreement , and <= 0.20 as slight agreement14 .
assessing value of chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores in ami prediction using net reclassification improvement ( nri ) and integrated discrimination improvement ( idi ) 15. whether nri and idi were statistically significant was analyzed using the z - test .
the analyses were performed using the spss 21.0 and rockit 0.9beta statistical software , and a two - sided p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results a total of 5140 af patients were enrolled in this study .
these patients were divided into two groups : 300 in the ami group and 4840 in the non - ami group .
patient demographics , cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors of the two groups are shown in table 1. of the 300 ami patients , 87 ( 29.0 %) were female , with a mean age of 67.4 +/ - 10.9 years .
but in the non - ami group , 1867 ( 38.6 %) were female , with a mean age of 59.9 +/ - 12.4 years .
in comparison with the non - ami group , the ami group had a higher prevalence of hypertension , dm , chf , cad , prior mi , stroke / tia , thromboembolism , vascular disease and hyperlipidaemia .
ami rate positively correlated with the chads2 score and the cha2ds2 - vasc score .

multivariable models of the difference between baseline clinical characteristics and prevalence of ami in patients with af are shown in table 2 .
multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age , male , and history of hypertension , dm , hyperlipidaemia , stroke / tia and prior mi were independent risk factors for ami ( p < 0.05 ) .
the associations of chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores with the prevalence of ami were assessed by multivariable logistic regression in different models ( table 3 ) .
the unadjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that both chads2 score ( odds ratio 2.166 , 95 % ci 1.987 - 2.362 , p < 0.001 ) and cha2ds2 - vasc score ( odds ratio 1.673 , 95 % ci 1.566 - 1.789 , p < 0.001 ) were associated with an increased odds ratio of the prevalence of ami in patients with af. furthermore , the adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that both chads2 score ( odds ratio 2.120 , 95 % ci 1.942 - 2.315 , p < 0.001 ) and cha2ds2 - vasc score ( odds ratio 1.639 , 95 % ci 1.532 - 1.753 , p < 0.001 ) were associated with an increased odds ratio of the prevalence of ami in patients with af , after adjustment for hyperlipidaemia , hyperuricemia , hyperthyroidism , hypothyroidism and osa .

roc analysis indicated that the auc for chads2 score predicting ami was 0.787 ( 0.763 - 0.812 ) , p < 0.001 ( fig. 1 ) .
the optimal cutoff value was chads2 >= 2 , with a sensitivity of 75.3 % and a specificity of 71.1 % .
the auc for cha2ds2 - vasc score predicting ami was 0.750 ( 0.722 - 0.777 ) , p < 0.001 .
the optimal cutoff value for cha2ds2 - vasc score displaying the best predictive value was >= 3 , with a sensitivity of 75.0 % and a specificity of 64.1 % .
the difference between the two areas under the curves was not significant ( z = 1.947 , p > 0.05 ) .
to follow up on this reclassification , we calculated category - based nri and absolute idi .
the cha2ds2 - vasc score was chosen as reference .
the chads2 score resulted in a nri of 0.069 ( p = 0.002 ) and an idi of 0.074 ( p > 0.05 ) .
figure 1 receiver operating characteristic curves ( roc ) for chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores for prediction of acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) in patients with atrial fibrillation ( af ) .
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( auc ) for chads2 score predicting ami is 0.787 ( 0.763 - 0.812 ) , p < 0.001 .
the sensitivity and specificity for a chads2 score >= 2 are 75.3 % and 71.1 % , respectively .
the auc for cha2ds2 - vasc score is 0.750 ( 0.722 - 0.777 ) , p < 0.001 .
the sensitivity and specificity for a cha2ds2 - vasc score >= 3 are 75.0 % and 64.1 % , respectively .
the difference between the two areas under the curves is not significant ( p > 0.05 ) .
the risk estimates of ami were stratified by the cut - offs of chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores , using the baseline characteristics of 5140 af patients , respectively .
chads2 score rated 1624 patients ( 31.6 %) as having high risk of ami , versus 1941 ( 37.8 %) who were considered high risk by cha2ds2 - vasc score .
both chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores indicated that 1418 ( 27.6 %) patients were at high risk of ami and 2993 ( 58.2 %) patients were at low risk of ami .
cha2ds2 - vasc score rated 523 patients ( 10.2 %) as having high risk of ami , who were considered low risk by the chads2 score .
on the contrary , chads2 score rated 206 ( 4.0 %) patients at high risk of ami , but considered low risk by the cha2ds2 - vasc score .
the kappa coefficient showed substantial concordance between the two tests ( kappa = 0.688 , p < 0.001 ) and the consistency rate between the two scores was 85.8 % .
the differences in risk discrimination of high risk ami patients between the two scores were significant ( mcnemar test , p < 0.001 ) .
the ami rate was significantly higher in patients with chads2 >= 2 compared with those with chads2 < 2 ( 13.9 % [ 226 / 1624 ] versus 2.1 % [ 74 / 3516 ] , p < 0.001 ) .
in addition , patients with cha2ds2 - vasc >= 3 had a significantly higher ami compared with patients with cha2ds2 - vasc < 3 ( 11.6 % [ 225 / 1941 ] versus 2.3 % [ 75 / 3199 ] , p < 0.001 ) .
discussion the major findings of this study are as follows : ( i ) ami rate positively correlates with the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores ; ( ii ) chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores are independent predictors of ami in af patients ; ( iii ) accuracy of chads2 score in predicting high - risk af patients who developed ami is similar to cha2ds2 - vasc score ; ( iv ) the predictive accuracy of the two scores is fair ; ( v ) the best cutoff value to predict ami is chads2 >= 2 or cha2ds2 - vasc >= 3 .
the study suggests that chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores may be useful as ami risk indices for patients with af , although the statistical impact is fair .
af and cad are closely associated .
data from recent studies in different patient populations have shown that af and cad coexist in a large percentage of patients ( 18 - 34 %) 16 .
cad can promote af due to its setting of consequential physiopathological changes , including inflammation , fibrosis , hypertrophy and atrial ischemia1 .
af population with a history of cad has been reported to be associated with recurrent af episodes , heart failure and increased short - term and long - term mortality17 .
furthermore , the morbidity and mortality of mi - associated stroke is often high , and the risk of post - mi stroke may be highest over the first 3 months18 .
stable cad was common in chinese af patients who were more likely to be older and to have more co - morbidities .
additionally , stable cad was strongly associated with a higher risk of 1 - year all - cause mortality19 .
a previous clinical trial proved that coronary artery calcium was independently associated with an increased risk of af20 .
but whether cad is the underlying pathophysiologic link between coronary artery calcium and af is still controversial21 .
af patients with cad have more risk factors and comorbidities than patients without cad .
increased risk of stroke and other thrombo - embolic events , left ventricular dysfunction , aggravation of heart failure and hospitalizations related to af complicating mi result in significant reduced exercise capacity , degraded quality of life and long - term death .
for instance , the development of af during index hospitalisation for mi was associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death22 .
coexistence of atherosclerotic risk factors , systemic inflammation and platelet activation can promote a pro - thrombotic state and eventually mi in af. in af patients , impaired artery dilatation predisposes to atherosclerotic complications is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events23 .
there are other mechanisms for the increased mi risk in patients with af. for example , episodes of poorly controlled af with high ventricular rates may result in type 2 mi24 .
shibata et al. reported that af was the most frequent cause of coronary artery embolism which was recognized as an important nonatherosclerotic cause of ami25 .
the data from our study demonstrates that , the prevalence of hypertension , dm , chf , cad , prior mi , stroke / tia , thromboembolism , vascular disease and hyperlipidaemia among 300 af patients with ami were higher than the patients without ami .
the present data also indicated that advanced age , male , and history of hypertension , dm , hyperlipidaemia , stroke / tia and prior mi were independent risk factors for ami in af patients .
much earlier prevention of the mi might reduce the burden of af to protect the patients , not only from the progression of af from an easily treated condition to an utterly refractory problem , but also from the risk of bleeding with triple therapy ( vitamin k antagonist , aspirin , and clopidogrel ) .
it is an enormous challenge to the management of af patients at risk or with previous mi , because of the complexity of antithrombotic treatment to prevent both thromboembolic and cardiac events .
previous studies showed that oral anticoagulants alone were not enough to lower the risk of mi in af26. of note , recent studies have demonstrated that combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is independently associated with significantly increased risk for bleeding compared with anticoagulant therapy alone in af patients27 .
moreover , the antithrombotic treatment of af may complicate coronary revascularization and related antiplatelet treatment11 .
therefore , the attention must be directed towards preventing cad at an early stage in order to improve the treatment and prognosis of af , with more focus on the ami risk stratification .
our data illustrated that ami rate positively correlated with the chads2 score and the cha2ds2 - vasc score .
furthermore , both chads2 score and cha2ds2 - vasc score were independently associated with an increased prevalence of ami .
except for preventing stroke in af patients , several studies recently have reported that the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores can also predict severity and outcomes of stroke and thromboembolic events28 in patients with af and those without af29 , 30 .
compared with hf with concomitant af , the risk of thromboembolism was higher among hf patients without af at high cha2ds2 - vasc scores31 .
in eight cohort studies ( 7 prospective and 1 retrospective ) of 31,509 patients with cad , chads2 score was associated with increased mortality and stroke / tia incidence in patients without af. but no significant association was found between chads2 score and stroke / tia incidence in patients with af32 .
furthermore , cha2ds2 - vasc score was strongly predictive of stroke and embolic events in a retrospective cohort of 465 patients with cardiac myxomas following surgical treatment33 .
hoshino t et al. found that chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores were useful in predicting functional status after stroke in cad patients34 .
both the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores were used to predict contrast - induced nephropathy ( cin ) in patients with cad who underwent urgent percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) 35 .
chou rh et al. enrolled 539 stable cad patients who underwent elective pci and reported that chads2 score independently increased the risk of cin .
moreover , the predictive accuracy of chads2 score was not inferior to either r2chads2 score or mehran 's risk score36 .
in addition , subjects who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery with higher chads2 scores had significantly higher all - cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality37 .
the present results showed that the auc for chads2 score was 0.787 with a similar accuracy of the cha2ds2 - vasc score ( auc 0.750 ) in predicting " high - risk " af patients who developed ami .
adding extra points for mi ( e.g. age >= 75 , prior myocardial infarction , etc. ) did not improve the predictive accuracy of cha2ds2 - vasc .
however , the predictive accuracy of the two clinical - based risk scores was fair ( auc 0.7 - 0.79 ) .
although the cha2ds2 - vasc score might be more inclined to classify af patients as high - risk ami than the chads2 score did .
the discriminative and reclassification power of chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores was assessed using nri and idi .
when chads2 score >= 2 and cha2ds2 - vasc score >= 3 were chosen as the best predictive cutoff values , chads2 score significantly improved risk classification for ami by assessment of nri .
however , insignificant idi for chads2 score was showed .
now that the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores have proved useful not only to assess the stroke , but also to assess the ami risk , and to drive therapeutic choices , our future clinical trials are going to examine the usefulness of addition of antiplatelet drugs to oral anticoagulants in reducing the risk of both mi and stroke in af patients .
study limitations the main limitation of this study is related to its retrospective nature .
the history of ami was ascertained at the time of admission .
chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores were calculated retrospectively after the ami had occurred .
precise information about the pre - ami status was unavailable .
it should also be noted that , because this was a hospital - based observational study , the characteristics of the patients with af admitted to the department of cardiology , xuzhou central hospital might differ from those of the general population .
additionally , these data derived from a single medical center survey might exist selection bias .
although we adjusted for several variables , residual and unmeasured confounding might not be fully reflected .
treatment related to the incidence of ami was not studied , especially for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy .
thus , we could not exclude the possibility that treatment influenced predictive value of the two scores .
finally , since all patients in our study were asians , the results were not directly translatable to other ethnicities .
as a result , further prospective multicenter and larger - scale studies are needed to clarify our conclusions .
conclusions focusing specifically on risk stratification of ami by the chads2 and cha2ds2 - vasc scores as well as means for optimizing outcomes in the treatment of af is the significance of our study .
even if the accumulated evidence has shown that cha2ds2 - vasc is better at identifying ' truly low - risk ' patients with af who develop stroke and thromboembolism , our data demonstrate that cha2ds2 - vasc is not significantly superior to chads2 for predicting ami in af patients .

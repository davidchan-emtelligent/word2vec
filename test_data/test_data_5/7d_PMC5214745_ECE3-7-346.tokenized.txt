abstract a growing body of knowledge on the diversity and evolution of intertidal isopods across different regions worldwide has enhanced our understanding on biological diversification at the poorly studied , yet vast , sea - land interface .
high genetic divergences among numerous allopatric lineages have been identified within presumed single broadly distributed species .
excirolana mayana is an intertidal isopod that is commonly found in sandy beaches throughout the gulf of california .
its distribution in the pacific extends from this basin to colombia and in the atlantic from florida to venezuela .
despite its broad distribution and ecological importance , its evolutionary history has been largely neglected .
herein , we examined phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana in the gulf of california and the caribbean , based on maximum - likelihood and bayesian phylogenetic analyses of dna sequences from four mitochondrial genes ( 16s rdna , 12s rdna , cytochrome oxidase i gene , and cytochrome b gene ) .
we compared the phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana with those of the coastal isopods ligia and excirolana braziliensis ( gulf of california and caribbean ) and tylos ( gulf of california ) .
we found highly divergent lineages in both , the gulf of california and caribbean , suggesting the presence of multiple species .
we identified two instances of atlantic - pacific divergences .
some geographical structuring among the major clades found in the caribbean is observed .
haplotypes from the gulf of california form a monophyletic group sister to a lineage found in venezuela .
phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana in the gulf of california differ from those observed in ligia and tylos in this region .
nonetheless , several clades of e. mayana have similar distributions to clades of these two other isopod taxa .
the high levels of cryptic diversity detected in e. mayana also pose challenges for the conservation of this isopod and its fragile environment , the sandy shores .

( 2017 ) , phylogeographic patterns of a lower intertidal isopod in the gulf of california and the caribbean and comparison with other intertidal isopods . ecology and evolution , 7 : 346 - 357 . doi : 10.1002 / ece3.2599 1 introduction the phenomenon of cryptic diversity , where a single valid species contains two or more lineages whose divergences may amount to interspecific levels , is particularly pervasive in several marine groups ( appeltans et al. , 2012 ; hubert et al. , 2012 ; knowlton , weight , solorzano , mills , & bermingham , 1993 ; mathews , 2006 ; moura , harris , cunha , & rogers , 2008 ; teske et al. , 2011 ) .
among marine animal taxa , isopods inhabiting the intertidal zone are prominent for possessing " dispersal - limiting " traits ( e.g. , direct development and habitat specificity ) that are expected to lead to high levels of allopatric diversification .
indeed , recent regional studies of intertidal isopods have revealed high genetic divergence among numerous allopatric lineages within what were otherwise regarded as single broadly distributed species ( hurtado , lee , & mateos , 2013 ; hurtado , mateos , & santamaria , 2010 ; hurtado et al. , 2016 ; santamaria , mateos , dewitt , & hurtado , 2016 ; santamaria , mateos , & hurtado , 2014 ; santamaria , mateos , taiti , dewitt , & hurtado , 2013 ) .
this phenomenon has been reported for different intertidal isopod genera and families and in different parts of the world , implying that additional morphologically cryptic diversity is yet to be discovered in other intertidal isopod taxa and / or regions .
furthermore , the growing body of phylogeographic knowledge allows for comparison of patterns of diversification within and among basins and taxa , which will enhance our understanding on biological diversification at the poorly studied , yet vast , sea - land interface .
an abundant and common isopod taxon inhabiting intertidal and subtidal regions worldwide is the family cirolanidae dana , 1852 ( poore & bruce , 2012 ) .
recent detailed morphological studies of members of shallow - water cirolanidae have recognized and formally described new species ( bruce , 2004 ) .
molecular studies of cirolanids , however , are very sparse .
nonetheless , the single named species that has been examined with some detail ( i.e. , excirolana braziliensis richardson , 1912 ) is suggested to comprise a complex of morphologically cryptic species ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ; sponer & lessios , 2009 ; varela & haye , 2012 ) .
this isopod has a broad distribution along pacific and atlantic sandy beach coasts of the american continent .
consistent with its low dispersal potential , gene flow among geographically nearby ( e.g. , few kilometers ) populations of e. braziliensis in panama is highly restricted ( lessios & weinberg , 1993 ) , and populations separated by only 10s of kilometers are genetically divergent ( sponer & lessios , 2009 ) .
the phylogeographic patterns of e. braziliensis reveal multiple highly divergent lineages , and multiple instances of atlantic - pacific divergences , some of which appear to predate the closure of the isthmus of panama ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ). whether such patterns are observed in excirolana mayana ( ives , 1891 ) , a poorly studied close relative of e. braziliensis that has similar distribution , biological characteristics , and morphology , is unknown .
excirolana mayana ( figure 1 ) is a littoral to shallow - water subtidal species ( maximum known depth = 16 m ) reported in the pacific from the gulf of california to colombia and in the atlantic from florida to venezuela ( brusca , wetzer , & france , 1995 ) .
the gulf of california , where e. mayana is highly abundant , is a megadiverse semi - enclosed basin that is home to > 4,900 named species of marine macro - invertebrates (~ 16 % are endemic ; brusca & hendrickx , 2010 ; ledesma - vasquez & carreno , 2010 ) .
nonetheless , actual diversity may be more than double , stemming from the paucity of formal species descriptions and the presence of poorly studied groups ( brusca et al. , 2005 ) .
indeed , recent genetic studies of intertidal isopods in the gulf of california suggest that ligia occidentalis ( dana , 1853 ) and tylos punctatus ( holmes & gay , 1909 ) correspond to cryptic species complexes comprised of many divergent lineages ( hurtado et al. , 2010 , 2013 ) .
in addition , two genetically divergent lineages of e. braziliensis occur allopatrically in a relatively small region of the gulf 's baja peninsula coast ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ) .
thus , it is likely that e. mayana in this basin also harbors hidden diversity .
furthermore , comparison of the phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana in this region with those of ligia and tylos will shed light on the evolution of nonvagile intertidal organisms in this basin .
figure 1 photograph of a specimen of excirolana mayana from dzilam de bravo ( type locality ) , mexico ( photo by k. conway ) the gulf of california region has a long and complex geological history that extends back to the miocene ( helenes , carreno , & carrillo , 2009 ) , aspects of which appear to be reflected in the evolutionary histories of these organisms ( hurtado et al. , 2010 , 2013 ) .
compared to tylos and ligia , e. mayana has notable differences in habitat use and dispersal potential .
tylos and ligia are mainly constrained to the supralittoral , actively avoid entering the sea , and have limited swimming and / or underwater gas exchange abilities ( brown & odendaal , 1994 ; hurtado et al. , 2010 ; kensley , 1974 ; schultz , 1970 ; taylor & carefoot , 1990 ) .
in contrast , e. mayana is an agile swimmer that spends part of its life underwater in the intertidal and subtidal zones ( brusca et al. , 1995 ) , and can feed on fish carcasses ( l.a. hurtado , pers. obs. ) that might be transported by currents .
therefore , e. mayana appears to have the highest probability of experiencing eventual long - distance overwater dispersal .
nonetheless , phylogeographic and biogeographic patterns of tylos and ligia in other parts of the world indicate the occurrence of past long - distance overwater dispersal events ( hurtado , lee , mateos , & taiti , 2014 ; santamaria et al. , 2013 , 2014 ) .
in the gulf of california and adjacent areas , tylos and ligia exhibit somewhat conflicting phylogeographic patterns ( hurtado et al. , 2010 , 2013 ) , which may be accounted for by differences in the extension and connectivity of the habitats occupied by tylos ( sandy supralittoral ) and ligia ( rocky supralittoral ) ( hurtado et al. , 2013 ) .
characterization of phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana in the caribbean will allow comparison with those reported for other intertidal isopods in this region .
the caribbean represents another region with exceptional marine diversity ( miloslavich et al. , 2010 ) and a long and complex geological history ( iturralde - vinent & macphee , 1999 ; rosen , 1975 ) .
in this region , ligia also harbors high levels of hidden diversity and a phylogeographic structure suggestive of a complex evolutionary history that probably has involved multiple events of long - distance overwater dispersal ( santamaria et al. , 2014 ) .
the phylogeographic patterns of ligia in the caribbean , however , neither correspond with predicted biogeographic patterns based on population connectivity of marine organisms with larval dispersal ( cowen , paris , & srinivasan , 2006 ) nor reflect a southeast to northwest colonization pattern proposed for the colonization of the caribbean by some terrestrial animals ( hedges , 1996 ) .
herein , we examined phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana across most of its distribution using four mitochondrial markers .
we conducted a thorough sampling across the gulf of california , which enables a better understanding on the diversity and evolutionary history of this isopod in this megadiverse basin .
we also examined specimens of e. mayana from the caribbean , which albeit scattered , represent different regions across this basin , thereby providing insights into the diversity and evolution of e. mayana in this basin as well .
given its biology , and what has been observed in other intertidal isopods , we expected to uncover high levels of genetic diversity in both regions .
we compared the phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana with those of ligia and e. braziliensis ( gulf of california and caribbean ) and tylos ( gulf of california ) .
the results add to the growing body of knowledge on the diversity and evolution of intertidal isopods across different regions worldwide .
2 methods 2.1 samples we collected individuals with diagnostic morphology of e. mayana from 23 localities across the gulf of california ( figure 2 ) .
although the locality carrizalillo ( crz ) is not within the gulf of california in the strict sense , we hereafter treat it as such for practical purposes .
we also included individuals with diagnostic morphology of e. mayana from dzilam de bravo ( type locality ) , venezuela , aruba , puerto rico , trinidad , jamaica , bahamas , panama , and costa rica ( figure 2 ) .
as out - groups , we added samples of e. braziliensis from across the americas , excirolana hirsuticauda ( menzies , 1962 ) from chile and excirolana chiltoni ( richardson , 1905 ) from korea and oregon ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ) .

version 10.3 redlands , ca : esri , 2014 2.2 molecular methods genomic dna was extracted from leg tissue with the dneasy kit ( qiagen , inc. , valencia , ca , usa ) .
four mitochondrial gene fragments were amplified : 16s ribosomal ( r ) dna ; 12s rdna ; cytochrome b gene ( cytb ) ; and cytochrome oxidase i gene ( coi ) .
the 16s rdna and 12s rdna primers ( podsiadlowski & bartolomaeus , 2005 ) amplify fragments of 439 and 480 bp , respectively .
the primers for the coi gene fragment ( 710 - bp ) were modified from the coi primers in the study of folmer , black , hoeh , lutz , and vrijenhoek ( 1994 ) by addition of an m13 tail ( table s4 ) .
the cytb primers ( merritt et al. , 1998 ) amplify a fragment of approximately 430 bp. we used exonuclease and shrimp alkaline phosphatase to clean pcr - amplified products , which were subsequently sequenced at the university of arizona genetics core .
we used sequencher 4.8 ( gene codes , ann arbor , mi , usa ) to edit sequences and remove primers .
to examine genetic variation within localities , we obtained cytb sequences from three to five individuals per locality for most localities .
as most localities exhibited little variation among individuals ( see section 3 ) , only one individual was further characterized for the additional genes .
for the few localities in which divergent cytb haplotypes were obtained , we further characterized one representative per divergent haplotype .
2.3 sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses sequence alignments were performed with the online version of mafft v.6.0 ( katoh & toh , 2008 ) .
because there was little difference between l - ins - i strategy and q - ins - i strategy , we chose the former one .
macclade v.4.06 ( maddison & maddison , 2005 ) was used to check for premature stop codons in protein - coding genes .
we used the online version of gblocks v.0.91b ( castresana , 2000 ) to identify positions that should be excluded due to questionable homology .
the following parameters were assumed : " allowed gap positions " = half ; " minimum length of a block " = 0.5 or 10 ; and " maximum number of contiguous nonconserved positions " = 4 or 8 for removing uncertain homology sequence blocks .
datasets of each separate gene were analyzed so as to assess genetic diversity within localities ( i.e. , cytb ; dataset s2 ) and select individuals to be sequenced for additional genes , measure genetic distances by gene , and conduct phylogenetic analyses without missing data - - the 12s rdna dataset ( dataset s1 ) allowed the inclusion of the specimen from the type locality ( dzi ) and the e. mayana sequence from pacific panama ( per ) reported by sponer and lessios ( 2009 ) ; the 16s rdna dataset ( dataset s3 ) also allowed inclusion of the dzi specimen ( i.e. , we were unable to obtain the coi and cytb sequences for this specimen ) .
the four mitochondrial genes were concatenated into a dataset that included one e. mayana representative per locality ( or more when the cytb results suggested more than one divergent haplotype occurred at a locality ; i.e. , lpz and caj ) , as well as all out - groups ( i.e. , e. braziliensis , e. hirsuticauda , and e. chiltoni ) .
we used the program jmodeltest v0.1.1 ( posada , 2008 ) to select the most appropriate dna substitution model among 88 candidate models computed from a fixed bionj - jc tree .
we used the following three criteria : the akaike information criterion ( aic ) , corrected aic ( c ) , and bayesian information criterion ( bic ; table s2 ) .
we conducted maximum - likelihood ( ml ) and bayesian analyses .
ml analyses were performed in raxml v .
8.0.7 , which implements the rapid bootstrap followed by ml search ( stamatakis , 2014 ) .
we also used garli v.2.0 ( zwickl , 2006 ) with bootstrap searches , which uses genetic algorithms for the ml search .
bootstrap trees were summarized ( 50 % majority - rule consensus ) with the sumtrees script of dendropy v.3.10.1 ( sukumaran & holder , 2010 ) .
bayesian analyses were performed within mrbayes v.3.2.1 ( huelsenbeck & ronquist , 2001 ; ronquist & huelsenbeck , 2003 ; ronquist et al. , 2012 ) and phycas v.1.2.0 ( lewis , holder , & swofford , 2010 ) , implementing the polytomy prior ( lewis , holder , & holsinger , 2005 ) in the latter .
the polytomy prior is one of the proposed ways to address problems arising from the " star - tree paradox " ( lewis et al. , 2005 ) .
for the mrbayes analyses , we used 10 billion generations , and collected a tree every 1,000 generations .
in both , ml and bayesian analyses , we used the closest more complex model available if the best models identified by jmodeltest could not be implemented ( tables s2 and s3 ) .
otherwise , when the combination of a proportion of invariable sites ( i ) and a gamma distribution of rates among sites ( g ) was selected as the best model , the parameter ( i ) was removed to avoid the potential problems related to dependency between two parameters ( see raxml manual and yang , 2006 ) .
in addition to the single - partition analyses described above , we conducted a multiple partition mrbayes analysis , implementing the best partitioning scheme identified by partitionfinder v.1.0 ( lanfear , calcott , ho , & guindon , 2012 ) .
for noncoding genes , each gene was set as one partition , whereas for coding genes , each gene and codon was set as a separate partition .
the following parameters were used in partitionfinder : branch lengths = linked ; models = all ; model selection = bic ; search = greedy .
the selected partitioning schemes are shown in table s3 .
convergence and adequate sampling of the posterior distribution were assessed by the following : ( 1 ) stable posterior probability values converged in more than 200 samples in tracer v.1.5 ( rambaut & drummond , 2007 ) ; ( 2 ) a high correlation between the split frequencies of independent runs as implemented in awty ( nylander , wilgenbusch , warren , & swofford , 2008 ) ; ( 3 ) small and stable average standard deviation of the split frequencies of independent runs ; ( 4 ) potential scale reduction factor close to 1 .
samples prior to reaching a stationary posterior distribution were eliminated as burn - in ( table s3 ) .
pairwise genetic distances were estimated for the coi gene and 12s rdna gene separately with the kimura - 2 - parameter ( k2p ) correction implemented in mega v.5 ( tamura et al. , 2011 ) .
for the 12s rdna gene , pairwise genetic distances were estimated on the dataset that excluded positions of questionable homology , and using pairwise deletion for missing data .
3 results all new sequences from this study have been deposited in genbank under accession numbers kx530937 , kx530941 , and kt122410 - kt122766 .
the dataset comprised of the concatenated fragments from four mitochondrial genes ( 12s rdna , 16s rdna , cytb , and coi ) and all out - groups included 57 taxa and 1,512 characters , of which 604 were parsimony informative ( table s2 ; dataset s4 ) .
based on this dataset , individuals with the diagnostic morphology of e. mayana formed a well - supported clade ( 100 bs ; 100 pp ; clades i - iv + a - g ) to the exclusion of e. braziliensis ( figure 3 ; tree was rooted with e. hirsuticauda and e. chiltoni ; not shown ) .
in addition , based on the 12s rdna dataset alone , a previously published sequence from the pacific coast of panama morphologically assigned to e. mayana appeared as a divergent ( 15.5 % - 19.1 % k2p ; table 1 ) sister to the remaining e. mayana sequences in this study ( overlaid with a dashed branch ; lineage v ; figure 3 ) , with clade support of 66 % - 88 % .
within the clade comprised of the remaining e. mayana lineages , a basal trichotomy was recovered : clade i + ii ; clade iii ; and lineage iv + a clade with the samples from the gulf of california ( a - g ) .
clade i + ii ( 97 - 99 bs ; 100 pp ) was comprised of the western caribbean islands of jamaica and bahamas ( clade ii ) , and its sister ( clade i ) , comprised of northern puerto rico , northern yucatan peninsula ( i.e. , the type locality dzilam de bravo ) , and the caribbean side of panama and costa rica .
coi k2p divergences between clade i and clade ii were 11.4 % - 15.9 % ( table 1 ) .
clade iii was comprised of samples from three eastern caribbean islands : trinidad ; aruba ; and southeastern puerto rico .
the coi k2p genetic divergence between clade iii ( western caribbean ) and clade i + ii was 19.4 % - 22.2 % ( table 1 ) .
the monophyly of the gulf of california clade was highly supported ( 94 - 99 bs and 100 pp ; figure 3 ) , and the sample from venezuela ( iv in figure 3 ) appeared as its closest relative ( 78 - 79 bs and 97 - 99 pp ) .
the coi k2p genetic divergence between the gulf of california and the lineage from venezuela was 17.5 % - 20.6 % and between venezuela + gulf of california versus clades i - iii was 14.6 % - 28.5 % .

john wiley & sons , ltd the gulf of california clade was split into three clades effectively joined at a basal trichotomy .
the first one , clade a ( 100 bs and pp ) , was restricted to mainland mexico from the southern gulf of california ( mazatlan ) to southern mexico ( playa crz ; figure 2 ) .
clade a was 13.6 % - 21.0 % divergent ( coi k2p ; table 2 ) from the remaining gulf of california lineages .
the maximum coi k2p divergence within clade a was 13.1 % ( table 2 ) .
the second basal lineage ( clade bc ; 73 - 79 bp ; 100 pp ) was comprised of the sister clades b and c. clade b ( 100 bs and pp ) was found mainly in bahia la paz ( i.e. , la paz , el cajete , and espiritu santo ) , in the baja cape region , in one peninsular locality further north in the central peninsula ( i.e. , armenta , bahia concepcion ) , and in the gulf mainland locality of topolobampo .
clade c ( 100 bs and pp ) was restricted to the cape region , and its distribution overlaps with that of clade b in the area of bahia la paz .
the coi k2p divergence of clade b versus c was 13.4 - 19.6 % ( table 2 ) .
clade b was divided into three lineages ( caj - lpz , bar , and esp - top - lpz ; maximum coi k2p divergence among them was 9.7 %) , two of which had representatives in la paz .
the samples from topolobampo ( mainland locality ) were identical to samples from espiritu santo based on cytb ( fig. s1 ) and 12s rdna sequences ( not shown ) .
clade c was also divided into three lineages ( caj , lpz , and arc - cbp - brr ; maximum coi k2p divergence among them was 10.5 %) ; two occurred in bahia de la paz and one south of this bay ( i.e. , puerta del arco , los barriles , and cabo pulmo ) .

within this clade , clade d ( 100 bs and pp ) was found in two southern baja localities ( loreto and la paz ) , whereas its sister , clade efg (<= 99 bs and pp ) , was the only e. mayana lineage found in the northern half of the gulf , along both the mainland and baja peninsula coasts .
divergence between clades d and efg was 14.0 % - 16.9 % ( coi k2p ; table 2 ) .
within clade efg , a basal trichotomy was recovered .
clade e ( 84 - 94 bs and 90 - 100 pp ) was found in the eastern central part of the gulf ( i.e. , guaymas , isla datil , and isla tiburon ) .
maximum coi k2p divergence within clade e was 3.2 % .
clade f ( 100 bs and pp ) was found at the northernmost part of the gulf ( i.e. , puerto penasco , san felipe , and puertecitos ) .
maximum coi k2p divergence within clade f was 2.8 % .
clade g received relatively low support ( 52 - 56 bs ; 73 - 79 pp ) and was found in the mid - gulf on the western mid - riff islands and the baja peninsula .
within this clade , the samples from santa rosalia and san bruno formed a monophyletic group (> 93 bs and pp ) .
maximum divergence within clade g was 3.8 % ( coi k2p ) .
3.1 mitochondrial diversity within localities except for the localities in which more than one divergent lineage occurred ( e.g. , la paz , el cajete ) , relatively low cytb diversity was found within localities ( fig. s1 ) .
in addition , sharing of identical or highly similar cytb haplotypes within clade and between localities was observed in several instances , for example , mazatlan , playa crz , and isla coral ( clade a ) ; la paz and el cajete ( clade b ) ; topolobampo , la paz , and espiritu santo ( clade b ) ; santa rosalia and san bruno ( clade e - h ) .
4 discussion despite its broad distribution and abundance , e. mayana has received little attention .
our study is the first to examine genetic diversity and the evolutionary history of this isopod .
as expected from its biological characteristics , high levels of hidden genetic differentiation were detected within e. mayana sampled from the gulf of california and the caribbean ( i.e. , the highest k2p divergence at coi was ~ 28.5 %) .
similar patterns of previously unknown diversity have also been reported in its close relative e. braziliensis ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ) , and the coastal isopods ligia and tylos , in these and other regions ( eberl , mateos , grosberg , santamaria , & hurtado , 2013 ; hurtado et al. , 2010 , 2013 , 2014 ; santamaria et al. , 2013 , 2014 ) .
4.1 atlantic - pacific divergences and phylogeographic patterns in the caribbean evidence for two atlantic - pacific divergences is detected within the phylogeny of e. mayana , but lack of reliable calibration points ( fossils or vicariant events ) precludes formal inference of meaningful divergence times .
based on branching patterns and inferred genetic distances , the first atlantic - pacific break is indicated by the deep basal divergence ( 15.5 % - 19.1 % k2p for 12s rdna ) between the e. mayana sequence from pacific panama reported by sponer and lessios ( 2009 ) and the clade grouping all of our samples .
the second more recent atlantic - pacific divergence is represented by the split between the lineages from venezuela and the gulf of california ( 6.6 % - 9.1 % k2p for 12s rdna ; 17.5 % - 20.6 % k2p for coi ) .
three atlantic - pacific divergences were detected in its congener e. braziliensis , likely occurring at different times , some of which appear to predate the closure of the panama isthmus ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ) .
two atlantic - pacific divergences are also observed in the phylogeographic patterns of ligia ( santamaria et al. , 2014 ) .
a complex miocene - pliocene geological history associated with the emergence of the isthmus of panama appears to have provided multiple opportunities for atlantic - pacific vicariance of marine organisms ( bacon et al. , 2015 ) .
the sister relationship between e. mayana from the gulf of california clade and one of the caribbean lineages ( venezuela ) , to the exclusion of other pacific ( panama isthmus ) and caribbean lineages , is somewhat analogous to the pattern observed in the supralittoral isopod tylos ( hurtado et al. , 2014 ) .
in contrast , in e. braziliensis , the gulf of california clade forms a monophyletic group with a lineage inhabiting the pacific coast of costa rica , which in turn groups with pacific lineages from panama and chile ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ) .
gulf of california - caribbean sister relationships , such as those detected in e. mayana and tylos , are not surprising .
most fauna - rich fossil sediments found in the northern gulf of california show affinities with caribbean fauna ( escalona - alcazar , delgado - argote , lopez - martinez , & rendon - marquez , 2001 ) , and marine fossils with caribbean affinities in the gulf of california date back to miocene times ( smith , 1991 ) .
highly divergent lineages of e. mayana occur in the caribbean , implying a long and complex evolutionary history within this basin , likely involving instances of overwater dispersal .
despite sparse sampling and unresolved basal relationships , several preliminary inferences can be made .
evidence of some geographical structuring among three major clades is observed , with one subclade within clade i found in the western caribbean , clade ii found in the north - central part , and clade iii occupying the eastern part .
in addition , the island of puerto rico harbors members of two divergent clades ; a pattern also observed in ligia ( santamaria et al. , 2014 ) .
the occurrence of two highly divergent lineages in a single large caribbean island was also observed in tylos from cuba ( hurtado et al. , 2014 ) .
in both , e. mayana and ligia ( santamaria et al. , 2014 ) , despite the geographic proximity of trinidad to the venezuelan coast , the lineages sampled from these two localities are highly divergent .
the venezuelan lineage of both e. mayana and ligia is also highly divergent from the remaining caribbean lineages , suggesting an independent history of this region from the rest of the caribbean for these isopods .
comprehensive sampling of the caribbean basin and the pacific coast south of the gulf of california to colombia ( the southern limit of e. mayana ) is needed to better assess the phylogeographic patterns described above and whether e. mayana harbors further hidden genetic diversity .
4.2 phylogeographic patterns in the gulf of california the large divergences among some lineages within the gulf of california clade , as well as between this clade and the caribbean lineages , suggest a long history of e. mayana in this basin .
the occurrence of monophyletic gulf of california clades containing highly divergent lineages has also been reported in ligia ( hurtado et al. , 2010 ) and tylos ( hurtado et al. , 2013 ) .
the overall phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana in the gulf of california , however , differ from those observed in the supralittoral isopods ligia and tylos in this region .
nonetheless , several clades of e. mayana have similar distributions to clades of these two other isopod taxa .
each of the three isopod taxa ( i.e. , ligia , tylos , and e. mayana ) contains a distinct clade that includes populations from the mainland southern gulf to the south , in the central pacific coast of mexico .
in e. mayana , clade a was found on the mainland from mazatlan , sinaloa ( southern part of the gulf of california ) , to playa crz , michoacan ( central pacific mexico ) .
in tylos , one highly divergent clade has a similar distribution , spanning the region between mazatlan and zihuatanejo ( guerrero ) , which includes playa crz [ i.e. , " clade b " in hurtado et al. ( 2013 )] .
similarly , a clade of ligia is distributed between topolobampo and ixtapa [ just south of zihuatanejo ; i.e. , localities s17 - s25 in hurtado et al. ( 2010 )] .
another highly divergent lineage of ligia was found in this region , in the localities of puerto vallarta and careyes [ i.e. , " clade f " in hurtado et al. ( 2010 )] .
a further phylogeographic similarity among e. mayana , ligia ( hurtado et al. , 2010 ) , and tylos ( hurtado et al. , 2013 ) is the presence of multiple divergent lineages restricted to the cape region of the baja peninsula .
sister clades b and c of e. mayana are mainly comprised of lineages found in the cape region of the baja peninsula , with the following two exceptions : ( 1 ) the clade b sample from armenta ( bar ; bahia concepcion ) , also in the southern peninsula but further north ; and ( 2 ) the clade b sample from topolobampo ( top ) in the gulf mainland .
divergence between the lineage from armenta and the other lineages in clade b ( 8.4 % - 9.2 % coi k2p ) suggests a relatively old split .
a similar divergence ( 7.3 % coi k2p ) between these two regions is observed in clade d , comprised of a lineage from la paz ( lpz ; cape region ) and a lineage from loreto ( lor ) , just south of bahia concepcion .
sequences of individuals from topolobampo are highly similar or identical to several individuals from bahia de la paz that grouped within clade b ( from espiritu santo island and la paz ) , suggesting a recent peninsula to mainland dispersal event .
phylogeographic patterns indicate the baja cape region has been an important center of diversity and endemism for the three isopod taxa , with six highly genetically differentiated and endemic lineages within e. mayana ( i.e. , clade d lpz , clade b lpz - caj , clade d esp - lpz , clade c caj , clade c lpz , and clade c arc - cbp - brr ; figure 3 ) , five within ligia ( hurtado et al. , 2010 ) , and three within tylos ( hurtado et al. , 2013 ) .
divergent lineages confined to the cape region have also been observed in other terrestrial organisms ( riddle , hafner , alexander , & jaeger , 2000 ) .
excirolana mayana is to our knowledge the first swimming organism for which divergences at the baja cape region are reported .
past isolation and a long independent history of the baja cape region may have promoted diversification and endemism in this region .
temporal seaways separating the cape region from the rest of the peninsula have been proposed ( grismer , 1994 ; murphy , 1983 ) .
in addition , it is hypothesized that the cape region was the last part of the baja peninsula to separate from mainland , 4 - 6 ma ( carreno & helenes , 2002 ; helenes & carreno , 1999 ; helenes & tellez - duarte , 2002 ; larson , menard , & smith , 1968 ; ledesma - vasquez & carreno , 2010 ) .
similar to ligia and tylos , e. mayana shows a highly divergent clade ( clade efg ) that is restricted to the northern gulf , where it is widely distributed .
in ligia , one of the two most basal lineages found in the gulf was comprised solely of northern gulf localities , whereas the other occupies the southern part of this basin ( hurtado et al. , 2010 ) .
tylos has three divergent lineages exclusive to the northern gulf [ i.e. , two in clade g and one in clade e in hurtado et al. ( 2013 )] .
distribution of the subgroupings within e. mayana clade efg is highly concordant with geography : clade e in the mainland guaymas - kino region ; clade f in the northernmost gulf ; and clade g in the bahia de los angeles area and the central peninsula around santa rosalia .
clades e , f , and g have similarities and differences with the lineages of ligia and tylos distributed in these areas ( hurtado et al. , 2010 , 2013 ) .
populations of e. mayana and ligia occupying the upper gulf show very shallow divergences , suggesting recent colonization that may have been facilitated by low sea levels ( hurtado et al. , 2010 ) .
in contrast , populations of tylos in this area can be highly divergent and belong to different clades , potentially reflecting a recent colonization by lineages that diverged elsewhere .
the bahia of los angeles area ( including the nearby islands ) appears to be a biodiversity hot spot for the three isopod genera , because it harbors multiple and highly divergent lineages of each .
isolation and differentiation of populations within islands probably contributed to this diversity .
finally , samples of e. mayana from guaymas are highly similar to the nearby insular localities of isla tiburon ( i.e. , el tordillo ) and isla datil , whereas the ligia samples from guaymas are similar to those of the nearby mainland localities of san carlos ( a bay adjacent to guaymas ) and kino , but highly divergent from those in isla tiburon and isla datil , which are in a different clade .
in tylos , samples from san carlos and isla tiburon are highly divergent from each other .
despite similarities in the distribution of several regional lineages , the general phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana , ligia , and tylos exhibit marked differences .
one contrasting phylogeographic pattern among the three intertidal isopods concerns the distribution of the most divergent lineages in the gulf .
in the case of ligia , one of the two most basal lineages is distributed in the northern gulf , whereas the other is distributed in the southern gulf ( hurtado et al. , 2010 ) .
such a pattern is not observed in e. mayana or tylos .
deeply divergent lineages restricted to either the northern or southern gulf , however , are observed in e. mayana and tylos ( hurtado et al. , 2013 ) .
another major discrepancy observed between ligia and tylos is the phylogeographic affinity of the cape region endemic lineages .
in the case of ligia , the closest relatives of the cape region lineages are in a clade distributed on the mainland between the southern gulf and central pacific mexico , and their divergence is congruent with geological hypotheses that suggest the baja cape region was the last portion of the peninsula to separate from the mainland ( hurtado et al. , 2010 ) .
in the case of tylos , however , the cape region lineages are more closely related to clades found further north in the gulf ( hurtado et al. , 2013 ) .
in tylos , the clade distributed on the mainland between the southern gulf and central pacific mexico is sister to a clade containing all remaining lineages from the gulf .
in the case of e. mayana , the clade distributed between the southern gulf and central pacific mexico ( clade a ) forms a basal polytomy with clade bc and clade defg .
a sister relationship between clade bc and clade defg would resemble the pattern of tylos , whereas a sister relationship of clade a and clade bc would resemble the pattern of ligia .
nevertheless , if the alternative relationship ( i.e. , a + defg ) was true , the phylogeographic pattern of e. mayana would differ from both ligia and tylos .
the incongruent phylogeographic patterns of e. mayana , ligia , and tylos in the gulf of california suggest different vicariance or dispersal histories .
due to its more aquatic nature , e. mayana is expected to have a higher dispersal potential than tylos or ligia .
notwithstanding their dispersal limitations , colonization of remote volcanic islands ( e.g. , hawaiian archipelago , galapagos , azores ) by members of the genera ligia and / or tylos ( hurtado et al. , 2014 ; santamaria et al. , 2013 ) must have required long - distance dispersal events .
unfortunately , the geological history of the gulf of california is far from resolved ( helenes et al. , 2009 ; ledesma - vasquez , 2002 ) .
therefore , it is not possible to discern which phylogeographic patterns resulted from vicariance and which from dispersal , except for those instances in which identical or very similar haplotypes are shared by specimens from geographically distant locations , implying recent long - distance overwater dispersal .
in e. mayana , we detected evidence for a recent long - distance (~ 190 km ) dispersal event across the gulf of california , from bahia de la paz , on the peninsula , to topolobampo , on the mainland .
hurricanes , which often affect this region , and vessel traffic ( e.g. , through ballast water ) may have facilitated dispersal .
la paz and topolobampo are major ports with daily exchange large vessels .
in its congener e. braziliensis , recent exchange of individuals between localities > 1,400 km apart ( i.e. , yucatan peninsula and caribbean panama ) has been reported ( hurtado et al. , 2016 ) .
thus , albeit apparently rare , long - distance dispersal appears to have occurred in these cirolanid isopods .
long - distance human - mediated dispersal , possibly via water ballast , appears to have occurred in other cirolanids ( bowman , bruce , & standing , 1981 ) , although this has not been confirmed with molecular data .
4.3 taxonomy excirolana mayana was originally described from the " port of silam " ( presumably dzilam de bravo ) in the yucatan peninsula ( ives , 1891 ) .
according to our results , the individual examined from dizlam de bravo ( dzi ; i.e. , topotype ) is most closely related to lineages found in the caribbean coast of panama and costa rica .
our discovery of high levels of apparently cryptic diversity further complicates a historically challenging taxonomy plagued by missing type material ( i.e. , the description fails to indicate where it was deposited ) , lack of adequate illustrations , conflicting description of characters , and ambiguity in reported locality names ( brusca et al. , 1995 ) .
for example , richardson ( 1905 ) reported e. mayana in " san francisco bay , lower california ," which is presumably " bahia san francisquito , baja california " ( brusca et al. , 1995 ) , a locality within the gulf that is close to isla salsipuedes ( ssp in figure 2 ) .
this has led to misidentifications between e. mayana and e. braziliensis , which have largely overlapping distributions in the east pacific and caribbean coasts ( brusca et al. , 1995 ) .
the most recent revision by brusca et al .
( 1995 ) indicates that e. mayana is widely distributed throughout the gulf of california and that it is one of the most abundant animals in the bays of this basin , occurring in vast numbers at sandy beaches .
our surveys of excirolana in the gulf confirm that e. mayana is indeed widespread and common .
in the pacific , brusca et al .
( 1995 ) also report e. mayana from one locality in the outer baja peninsula coast ( i.e. , sebastian vizcaino bay ) , as well as in costa rica , panama , and colombia .
in the caribbean , the identification of e. mayana has also been confusing .
menzies and glynn ( 1968 ) reported this isopod in puerto rico and indicate this species is probably a pantropical cosmopolitan .
however , bruce ( 1981 ) and kensley ( 1984 ) indicate the samples from puerto rico were erroneously identified .
dexter ( 1972 ) listed cirolana mayana as the most abundant organism on the two panamanian beaches she examined ( one pacific and one atlantic ) , but glynn , dexter , and bowman ( 1975 ) indicated it was a misidentification of e. braziliensis .
bruce ( 1986 ) listed e. mayana as a possible indo - west pacific species .
potential for misidentification may also happen with excirolana chamensis brusca & weinberg , 1987 ; the third excirolana species formally recognized in the tropical / subtropical east pacific .
brusca and weinberg ( 1987 ) described this species from one locality on the pacific coast of panama .
they suggest this species has a highly restricted distribution ( only two pacific localities in panama ) , indicating they did not find it among the thousands of excirolana specimens examined from more than 100 locations in the eastern pacific ( from the gulf of california , mexico , to chile ) , plus numerous samples from the caribbean and brazil .
recently , however , e. chamensis was reported from bahia la paz on the basis of morphology ( torres & lowry , 2011 ) .
despite our extensive surveys within this bay , including several localities and visits during different years , we only found individuals with e. mayana morphology , not e. chamensis .
given the problems associated with the identification of the east pacific excirolana species , the record of e. chamensis in bahia la paz awaits corroboration .
examination of dna sequences from e. chamensis specimens , which are not available , is necessary to establish whether it constitutes an independent lineage from the e. mayana and e. braziliensis clades , and to assess its geographic range .
as e. mayana appears to constitute a complex of cryptic species , its taxonomy needs revision .
we conducted a preliminary examination to identify morphological differences among members of the gulf of california clade and found subtle differences in the shape and setae of the telson of several lineages .
in clade a , the pleonites are subequal in width and length , and the tip has a semicircular shape with short setae ( fig. s2e ) .
in clade b , the width of the pleonites is 1.5 - 2 times their length , and the tip has a rounded triangular shape with short setae ( fig. s2f ) .
in clade c , the pleonites are subequal in width and length , the tip is blunt and rounded with very short setae that are barely visible , and the posterior border is slightly serrated ( fig. s2g ) .
in clade d , the pleonites are subequal in width and length , the tip is rounded and triangular with very short setae , and the posterior border is smooth ( fig. s2h ) .
the shape and setae of the telson were similar among clades e , f , and g ( fig. s2i and j ) .
the width of the pleonites is 1.5 times their length , and the tip has an oval to triangular shape with short setae .
the above preliminary observations on potential differences among lineages need to be examined in further detail .
morphometrics has allowed some discrimination among otherwise morphologically cryptic lineages of e. braziliensis ( lessios & weinberg , 1994 ) , but body shape landmark - based morphometrics failed to discriminate among highly divergent cryptic lineages of ligia ( santamaria et al. , 2016 ) .
4.4 conservation considerations excirolana mayana is an abundant member of sandy beach communities in the gulf of california and caribbean , where it plays an important ecosystem function as a scavenger .
this isopod represents another member of sandy beach communities from these regions for which phylogeographic studies have revealed the presence of numerous divergent lineages with very restricted distributions , which constitute multiple evolutionary significant units , some of which may merit species - level recognition .
therefore , their extirpation from a locality may result in the extinction of unique biodiversity .
direct - developing invertebrates ( expected to have a limited dispersal potential ) constitute a large percentage (> 50 % in some regions ) of the intertidal species found on sandy beaches ( grantham , eckert , & shanks , 2003 ) ; thus , many more members of sandy beach communities are expected to show high levels of highly restricted unique diversity .
unfortunately , sandy beach communities are largely overlooked for conservation efforts , yet they are very susceptible to human and natural factors that cause disturbances in this habitat ( defeo et al. , 2009 ) .
given the highly restricted distribution of differentiated lineages , local efforts to preserve sandy beaches are needed .
it is also important to confer these differentiated lineages a conservation status , because the current taxonomy erroneously implies that these are widely distributed species and , thus , not of conservation concern .
protection of the unique diversity identified in the isopods e. mayana , e. braziliensis , tylos , and ligia , for which high levels of endemism are known in the gulf of california and caribbean , may benefit other poorly known intertidal invertebrates associated with sandy shores .

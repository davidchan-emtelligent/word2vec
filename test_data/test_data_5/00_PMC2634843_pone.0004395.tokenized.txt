dna - dependent protein kinase ( dna - pk ) plays a critical role in dna damage repair , especially in non - homologous end - joining repair of double - strand breaks such as those formed by ionizing radiation ( ir ) in the course of radiation therapy .
regulation of dna - pk involves multisite phosphorylation but this is incompletely understood and little is known about protein phosphatases relative to dna - pk. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that dna - pk interacts with the protein phosphatase - 6 ( pp6 ) saps subunit pp6r1 .
pp6 is a heterotrimeric enzyme that consists of a catalytic subunit , plus one of three pp6 saps regulatory subunits and one of three ankyrin repeat subunits .
endogenous pp6r1 co - immunoprecipitated dna - pk , and ir enhanced the amount of complex and promoted its import into the nucleus .
in addition , sirna knockdown of either pp6r1 or pp6 significantly decreased ir activation of dna - pk , suggesting that pp6 activates dna - pk by association and dephosphorylation .
knockdown of other phosphatases pp5 or pp1gamma1 and subunits pp6r3 or ars - a did not reduce ir activation of dna - pk , demonstrating specificity for pp6r1 .
finally , sirna knockdown of pp6r1 or pp6 but not other phosphatases increased the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to radiation - induced cell death to a level similar to dna - pk deficient cells .
our data demonstrate that pp6 associates with and activates dna - pk in response to ionizing radiation .
therefore , the pp6 / pp6r1 phosphatase is a potential molecular target for radiation sensitization by chemical inhibition .
introduction dna double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) arise from normal cellular processes such as v - d - j recombination and free radicals , as well as from exogenous sources , such as ionizing radiation or other forms of genotoxic stress .
homologous recombination ( hr ) and non - homologous end - joining ( nhej ) are the two major pathways for repair of dna dsbs .
nhej , which does not require the presence of a homologous template , is the predominant repair pathway for dsbs produced by ionizing radiation ( ir ) .
the dna - dependent protein kinase ( dna - pk ) plays a central role in regulating nhej , as evidenced by the hypersensitivity of dna - pkcs ( dna - pk catalytic subunit ) - / - mice to ir and the high levels of unrepaired dsbs observed in dna - pkcs - / - mice after exposure to other forms of genotoxic agents [ 1 ] .
dna - pk has been classified on the basis of sequence analysis as a member of the phosphatidylinositol - 3 - kinase ( pi - 3 - k ) - related kinase ( pikk ) super family [ 2 ] , which includes the human ataxia telangiectasia mutated ( atm ) and atm - rad3 related ( atr ) proteins .
these protein kinases regulate diverse processes , including genome surveillance and responses to cellular stress [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
dna - pk is composed of a catalytic subunit ( dna - pkcs ) and two ku heterodimers , which act as regulatory subunits [ 5 ] .
dna - pkcs contains a dna binding domain , a catalytic domain , and a ku binding domain .
nhej is initiated when two ku heterodimers recognize and stably bind to broken dna ends , where they serve to recruit two dna - pkcs molecules to the damaged site [ 6 ] .
once bound to dna , the kinase function of dna - pkcs is activated .
the two separate dna - pk complexes interact with each other to bridge the two dna ends through the n - terminal heat repeats of dna - pkcs [ 7 ] .
this interaction facilitates alignment of the two dna ends for repair [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
numerous studies have shown that dna - pkcs undergoes a series of phosphorylations in response to dsbs at the clusters of abcde ( six sites between thr2609 and thr2647 ) and pqr ( five sites between residues 2023 and 2056 ) [ 10 ] , as well as at additional conserved sites , including thr3950 [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
functional assays have revealed that phosphorylation at sites in these two clusters regulates dna end - access to dna end - processing factors and to other dna repair pathways .
alanine substitution at all six sites of the abcde cluster virtually abolishes the ability of dna - pk to function in nhej .
however , mutating all five sites of pqr to alanine resulted in only a modest defect in nhej .
the phosphorylation of abcde promotes end - processing , whereas the phosphorylation of pqr inhibits end - processing [ 6 ] .
thus , the abcde and pqr sites function reciprocally to regulate dna end - access [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] .
phosphorylation of the thr3950 site is thought to be inhibitory , since mutants mimicking phosphorylation at this site lack kinase activity without a reduction in the affinity of the catalytic subunit for dna - bound ku. moreover , impairing the kinase activity of dna - pkcs or mutating the clusters of major phosphorylation sites does not block localization of dna - pkcs to dsb sites , but lowers the rate of exchange between dna - bound and free dna - pkcs [ 12 ] - [ 17 ] .
these observations suggest that autophosphorylation is required to destabilize the initial protein - dna complex that , in turn , facilitates additional repair steps [ 8 ] .
ser / thr phosphatases , such as pp5 and pp1gamma1 , are reported to be involved in the regulation of dna - pk [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] .
the overexpression of pp5 decreased dna - pkcs thr2609 phosphorylation in hela cells , while purified pp1gamma1 recovered the dna - pk activity from autophosphorylated dna - pkcs in an in vitro assay .
however , little is known about which ser / thr phosphatases regulate dna - pk activity through dephosphorylation of various sites in dna - pkcs .
protein phosphatase 6 ( pp6 ) is a ser / thr protein phosphatase classified as a type 2a phosphatase family member based on its sequence homology to the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2a ( pp2a ) [ 20 ] and its sensitivity to active site inhibitors such as okadaic acid , microcystin and calyculin a [ 21 ] .
pp6 is functionally distinct from other type 2a phosphatases and conserved in evolution , because human pp6 rescues mutations of the homologous sit4 in yeast [ 22 ] .
pp6 plays a role in the regulation of nfkappab signaling [ 23 ] .
the holoenzyme of pp6 is proposed to be a heterotrimer that consists of a catalytic subunit ( pp6c ) , a saps ( sit4 - associated protein ) subunit plus an ankyrin repeat subunit ( ars ) .
the human saps , named as pp6r1 , pp6r2 and pp6r3 , are more divergent in sequence than pp6 and are widely distributed in multiple tissues [ 23 ] .
recent studies show that sirna knockdown of pp6r1 , but not pp6r3 , enhances degradation of endogenous ikappabepsilon in response to tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) [ 24 ] .
these results suggest that one function of the saps - like subunit pp6r1 is to target pp6 to specific substrates such as ikappabepsilon .
in this study , we show that dna - pkcs associates with pp6r1 , that this binding increases after ir , and that depletion of pp6 / pp6r1 reduces ir activation of dna - pkcs and increases the radiosensitivity of glioblastoma cells .
these observations suggest that pp6 with a pp6r1 subunit is an important regulator of dna - pk activity and function in cells .
materials and methods cell lines and reagents dna - pkcs - proficient ( m059k ) and dna - pkcs - deficient ( m059j ) glioblastoma cells were maintained in dmem / f12 media ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs , invitrogen ) , 0.05 mm non - essential amino acids ( invitrogen ) and 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate ( invitrogen ) .

raw data images were converted to 8 - bit tiff images in openlab .
cellular fractionation cells were collected in ice - cold pbs .
the cell pellets were resuspended for 5 minutes in a permeabilization buffer consisting of 10 mm hepes ph 7.4 , 10 mm potassium acetate , 50 microg / ml digitonin , 1 mm pmsf , 1 mm na3vo3 , and 1 microg / ml protease inhibitors ( aprotinin , leupeptin and pepstatin ) .

dna - pk activity was analyzed using a dna - pk activity assay kit ( roche ) [ 13 ] , [ 25 ] according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
clonogenic assay the method of the clonogenic assay was adapted from franken , et al [ 26 ] .
briefly , the treated and untreated control cells were harvested and re - seeded in a 100 mm dish at an appropriate density to obtain approximately 50 - 100 colonies .
following 10 - 14 days incubation , cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet , and colonies containing at least 50 cells were scored .
pulse - field gel electrophoresis sirna - transfected cells were sham - treated or irradiated with 10 gy ir on ice .
after irradiation , cells were harvested immediately or following a 3 hour recovery at 37degreesc .
harvested cells were embedded in incert agarose ( bma , rockville , md ) plugs and lysed in 0.5m edta , ( ph 8 ) , 2 % sarcosyl , 1mg / ml proteinase k solution for 48 hours at 50degreesc .
pfge was carried out using a chef mapper system ( bio - rad , hercules , ca ) for 74 hours in 0.8 % agarose , 1x tbe buffer at 14degreesc , with 35 minute pulse time at the field strength of 2 v / cm and 106 degree included angle. s. cerevisiae and s. pombe chromosomes ( bio - rad ) were included as dna size markers .
following electrophoresis , gels were stained with ethidium bromide , photographed and analyzed with image j software ( nih , bethesda , md ) .
the fraction activity released ( far ) was calculated as an amount of dna entering the gel divided by the amount of dna remaining in the well , and normalized to sham - irradiated control .
results endogenous dna - pkcs associates with pp6 and pp6r1 and responds to radiation to investigate potential functions of pp6 , we generated a stable 293 cell line expressing low levels of flag - tagged pp6r1 and analyzed immunoprecipitates by mass spectroscopy to identify interacting proteins [ 27 ] .
this approach yielded multiple peptides from a total of > 45 pp6r1 interacting proteins , which included pp6c , ankyrin - repeat pp6 subunits and dna - pkcs .
to follow - up on this observation , we prepared extracts from the glioblastoma cell lines m059k and m059j , which do or do not express dna - pkcs , respectively , and immunoprecipitated with specific anti - dna - pkcs antibodies .
immunoblotting showed endogenous pp6r1 and pp6c co - immunoprecipitated with endogenous dna - pkcs from the proficient m059k cells using specific anti - dna - pk antibodies , but not with non - immune igg used as a negative control ( figure 1 , lanes 1 , 2 ) .
using extracts from m059j cells neither pp6 nor pp6r1 were immunoprecipitated and , as expected , no dna - pk was recovered ( figure 1 , lane 3 ) .
these results establish that endogenous dna - pkcs , pp6 and pp6r1 are associated in a complex that can be recovered by immunoprecipitation .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004395.g001 figure 1 pp6r1 associates with dna - pk in human cancer cells. a. cell extracts from irradiated dna - pk proficient ( m059k ) , and deficient glioblastoma cells ( m059j ) were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal alpha - dna - pkcs antibody .
following sds - page , dna - pkcs , pp6r1 and pp6c proteins were detected by immunostaining using specific antibodies or pre - immune serum. b. m059k cells were irradiated with 5 or 10 gy , or sham - treated ( 0 gy ) .
one hour after radiation , the cells were lysed and cytoplasmic and nuclei were prepared .
nuclei were subjected to immunoprecipitation with dna - pkcs antisera. c. immunoblots of the nuclear fractions were quantified by densitometry .
standard error bars represent the mean of three independent experiments (+/ - sd ) .
the statistical significance of the differences between the amount of pp6c or pp6r1 in the nuclear fraction from irradiated cells , and in the nuclear fraction from non - irradiated control cells was (*** , p < 0.001 ) by student t test .
we tested whether the interaction of dna - pkcs with pp6r1 / pp6 was affected by ir. endogenous dna - pkcs was immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of m059k cells following various doses of radiation ( 0 , 5 , 10 gy ) .
immunoblotting showed identical recovery of dna - pkcs in each sample , but increased amounts of co - immunoprecipitated pp6r1 and pp6c from irradiated vs. non - irradiated cells ( figure 1b ) .
multiple independent experiments showed a statistically significant ( 1.6 to 2.6 - fold ) increase in co - precipitation of pp6r1 and pp6c following 5 gy of ir ( figure 1c ) .
there was little further increase in association with dna - pkcs at 10 gy compared to 5 gy , and the relative - fold increase in amount of pp6r1 compared to pp6c when normalized to non - irradiated samples was slightly different , but the analyses involved immunoblotting with different antibodies for each subunit .
these results showed that following ir there was a significant increase in the association of endogenous dna - pkcs with pp6r1 and pp6c .
dna - pkcs is required for radiation - induced pp6r1 nuclear localization dna - pkcs is a central component of nhej that occurs in the nucleus .
therefore we asked if the ir - induced increase in the association of pp6r1with dna - pkcs would affect the intracellular localization of endogenous pp6r1 .
we irradiated or mock - treated m059k and m059j glioblastoma cells , then prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions that were analyzed by western blotting ( figure 2a ) .
after ir of either 5 or 10 gy the levels of dna - pkcs and pp6r1 were higher in the nucleus of m059k cells compared with non - irradiated ( 0 gy ) m059k cells .
there was a corresponding decrease in the amount of dna - pkcs and pp6r1 in the cytoplasmic fractions of irradiated vs. non - irradiated cells .
the ir - induced increase in nuclear dna - pkcs and pp6r1 was statistically significant at 5 gy ( figure 2b ) and the translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus was especially apparent ( 2.4 - fold ) with cells treated with 10 gy compared to non - irradiated controls .
ku86 and tubulin were used as loading controls for the total amount of protein in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions , respectively ( figure 2a ) .
as expected , dna - pkcs was not detected by immunoblotting in the cytoplasm or nucleus of deficient m059j cells .
the nuclear vs. cytoplasmic distribution of pp6r1 in dna - pkcs deficient m059j cells was not affected by ir. these results showed that ir induced translocation of dna - pkcs along with pp6r1 from the cytosol to the nucleus of glioblastoma cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004395.g002 figure 2 ir - induced nuclear localization of pp6r1 is dna - pk dependent. a. m059k and m059j cells were left untreated or irradiated with 5 or 10 gy. one hour after irradiation , cells were lysed and fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions .
the protein levels of dna - pkcs and pp6r1 in these fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis .
beta - tubulin and ku86 are markers for cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions , respectively. b. immunoblots of the nuclear fractions were quantified by densitometry .
the standard error bars represent means of three independent experiments (+/ - sd ) .
the statistical significance of the differences between the amount of dna - pkcs or pp6r1 in the nuclear fraction from irradiated cells , compared with the nuclear fraction of non - irradiated control cells , was (*** , p < 0.001 ) by student t test. c. m059k and m059j cells grown on chamber slides were irradiated with 5 gy , or sham - irradiated .
one hour post - irradiation , cells were fixed and immunostained with pp6r1 and dna - pkcs antibodies .
upper row : orange pp6r1 staining , lower row : green phosphorylated dna - pkcs thr2609 stain .
immunofluorescent microscopy was employed to visualize the intracellular localization of pp6r1 in response to ir. endogenous pp6r1 was distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of m059k and m059j cells ( figure 2c , top row ) .
following ir there was increased staining of pp6r1 in the nucleus of m059k cells , but no similar increase in m059j cells .
these results confirmed the cell fractionation analysis that showed ir - induced pp6r1 accumulation in the nucleus .
we also observed an increase in staining for dna - pkcs in the nucleus of irradiated m059k cells ( data not shown ) , however , there was apparent cross - reactivity of the dna - pkcs antibodies with other proteins that gave immunofluorescent staining of the cytoplasm of both m059k and m059j cells .
phosphosite - specific antibodies showed phosphorylation of thr2609 in the nucleus of dna - pkcs in irradiated but not control m059k cells .
this staining was not seen following ir of m059j cells that are deficient in dna - pkcs ( figure 2c ) .
taken together our results indicated that following ir there is an increased association of dna - pkcs with pp6r1 / pp6c and accumulation of the complex in the nucleus .
the ir - induced nuclear localization of pp6r1 was seen in cells replete with dna - pkcs ( m059k ) , but not cells deficient in dna - pkcs ( m059j ) , suggesting that the kinase was required for relocalization of the phosphatase .
knockdown of dna - pk abrogates radiation - induced pp6r1 nuclear localization we tested the hypothesis that ir - induced nuclear localization of pp6r1 is dependent on dna - pkcs .
m059k cells were transfected with a pool of multiple sirna to knockdown levels of dna - pkcs or control sirna .
these cells were then irradiated or mock treated and compared for the distribution of endogenous pp6r1 by immunofluorescence microscopy ( figure 3a ) .
in non - irradiated ( - ir ) cells transfected with control sirna or specific sirna the pp6r1 appeared predominantly in the cytoplasm compared to the nucleus , although we noted somewhat enhanced perinuclear staining and less nuclear staining for pp6r1 in the dna - pk knockdown cells .
whereas m059k cells transfected with control sirna showed greatly enhanced immunostaining for pp6r1 in the nucleus following ir , there was no ir - induced change in the distribution of pp6r1 in m059k cells knocked down for dna - pk. as controls and for confirmation , nuclear extracts from parallel cultures were analyzed by immunoblotting ( figure 3b ) .
the specific sirna pool successfully depleted 90 % of dna - pk from the nuclei of m059k cells .
the ir - induced accumulation of pp6r1 into the nucleus was evident in cells transfected with control sirna , and there also was an ir - induced increase in nuclear dna - pk , especially when normalized to ku86 as loading control .
knockdown of dna - pk (+ lanes ) essentially eliminated any accumulation of pp6r1 in the nucleus , in both irradiated and non - irradiated cells .
one might speculate from this that dna - pk is required for transport of the pp6 phosphatase complex into the nucleus , even in the absence of dna damage .
ku86 was used as a loading control for the total amount of nuclear extract protein .
immunoblotting showed that the total amount of pp6r1 in these cells was unchanged by either sirna transfection or ir , eliminating the possibility that increases or decreases in whole cell levels of endogenous pp6r1 accounted for the observed changes in distribution of the protein .
thus , there was cytoplasmic to nuclear redistribution of pp6r1 in response to ir that was dependent on expression of dna - pkcs , supporting the observations made comparing m059k and m059j cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004395.g003 figure 3 sirna knockdown of dna - pkcs abrogates ir - induced pp6r1 nuclear localization. a. m059k cells were transfected with control sirna or anti - dna - pkcs sirna , and 48 hours later subjected to 5 gy. one hour post - irradiation , the cells were fixed and immunostained with anti - dna - pkcs and pp6r1 antibodies .
upper row : orange pp6r1 and lower row : merged dapi , dna - pk and pp6r1. b. m059k cells were transfected with control sirna or anti - dna - pkcs sirna and subjected to irradiation 48 hours post - transfection .
one hour post - irradiation the cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions .
the protein levels of dna - pkcs , pp6r1 , and ku were detected by immunoblotting .
knockdown of pp6r1 or pp6c reduces activation of dna - pk in response to ir dna - pkcs contains multiple ser / thr phosphorylation sites , which are known to regulate dna - pk catalytic and nhej activities .
does the association of pp6r1 / pp6 with dna - pk have a functional consequence , in terms of kinase activation in response to ir ?
to address this question m059k cells were transfected with pools of specific sirna to knockdown individual phosphatases including pp6c , pp5 and pp1gamma1 , or the pp6 subunits pp6r1 or pp6r3 .
the activity of dna - pkcs was analyzed in nuclear extracts using an in vitro kinase assay with a specific peptide substrate ( figure 4a ) .
in this assay , dna - pk activity in m059k cells transfected with control sirna was increased about 6 - fold in response to ir ( black vs. grey bars ) .
as a control to validate the assay , there was no detectable kinase activity in dna - pk deficient m059j cells , either with or without ir. knockdown of either pp6r1 or pp6c resulted in strong , almost complete , suppression of dna - pk activity .
there was residual ir - induced increase in dna - pk in cells knocked down for pp6c or pp6r1 , but this level of ir stimulated activity in the knockdown cells was about the same as for non - irradiated control cells ( grey bars ) .
the effects were highly selective for pp6 compared to other protein ser / thr phosphatases , even those with reported roles in control of dna - pk .
m059k cells knocked down for pp5 showed slightly elevated dna - pk activity in response to ir , while knockdown of pp1gamma1 allowed > 4 - fold kinase activation by ir , and a level of kinase slightly lower than control .
these other ser / thr phosphatases , such as pp5 and pp1gamma1 , may be involved in the regulation of dna - pk - mediated dna repair , but did not directly regulate dna - pkcs activity in this assay .
knockdown of another saps subunit for pp6 called pp6r3 did not significantly reduce ir - induced dna - pk activity , attesting to the specificity for pp6 / pp6r1 .
pp6r3 has a saps domain and like pp6r1 exclusively binds pp6 vs. other type - 2a phosphatases .
these data suggest that ir activation of dna - pk requires the non - redundant action of a pp6 holoenzyme containing a pp6r1 subunit .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004395.g004 figure 4 sirna knockdown of pp6r1 significantly decreases dna - pk kinase activity .
m059k cells were transfected with control , non - targeting sirna or specific sirnas targeted to pp5 , pp1gamma1 , pp6c , pp6r3 and pp6r1. a. forty - eight hours after transfection , the m059k cells were irradiated with 5 gy or sham - irradiated .
thirty minutes after irradiation , cells were harvested and fractionated .
dna - pkcs was immunoprecipitated from nuclear fractions , and the activity of dna - pkcs was measured by incorporation of 32p into a dna - pkcs - specific p53 - derived peptide substrate .
dna - pkcs - deficient m059j cells were used as a negative control .
the numbers were normalized to non - irradiated m059k cells and the data show the mean of counts per minute per microg protein in the eluted solution +/ - sd ( n = 3 ). b. m059k cells transfected with anti - pp6c or anti - pp6r1 sirna as described in panel a were treated with 1 microm cpt for 4 hours .
rpa2 was detected in whole cell lysates by western blot .
.
the slower migrating band represents the phosphorylated form of rpa2 .
m059j cells were used as a negative control .
in addition , we tested whether pp6r1 / pp6 was required for activation of dna - pkcs in live cells , using the endogenous substrate replication protein a2 ( rpa2 , figure 4b ) .
rpa2 is differentially phosphorylated by three pi3ks ( atm , atr , dna - pk ) in response to different dna damaging agents .
however , dna - pk is the primary kinase responsible for phosphorylating rpa2 in response to camptothecin ( cpt ) treatment [ 28 ] - [ 30 ] .
phosphorylation of rpa2 is seen in immunoblotting , by appearance of a band of reduced mobility relative to the rpa2 band .
camptothecin treatment induced phosphorylation of rpa2 in m059k cells , but not m059j cells .
knockdown of either pp6r1 or pp6 attenuated phosphorylation of the endogenous rpa2 in response to camptothecin , consistent with a pp6 requirement for activation of dna - pk. we concluded that pp6 / pp6r1 are required for activation of dna - pk in response to two different dna damaging agents ( ir and cpt ) .
dsb repair and glioblastoma survival after ir depend on pp6r1 / pp6c dna - pk is central to nhej of dsb and because pp6r1 / pp6 is required for ir - induced activation of dna - pk , we wondered if dsb repair also was dependent on pp6r1 and pp6 .
we used pulse - field gel electrophoresis ( pgfe ) to measure dsb and repair .
glioblastoma m059k and m059j cells transfected with control sirna were compared along with m059k cells transfected with sirna pools targeted to pp6r1 or pp6c .
cells were irradiated with 10 gy ir , and subjected to pfge immediately , or 3 hr following radiation to allow for initial repair .
in response to ir about the same level of dsb was detected in all four samples ( black bars , figure 5a ) .
in the control m059k cells approximately 80 % of dsb were repaired within 3 hr after radiation ( grey bar ) , but this response was incomplete in pp6r1 or pp6c - depleted m059k cells , which show persistent dsb , as in the dna - pk - deficient m059j cells .
thus , knockdown of either pp6r1 or pp6 mimics the deficiency in dsb repair seen in cells lacking dna - pk itself , consistent with an impaired activation of dna - pk kinase in response to ir .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0004395.g005 figure 5 sirna knockdown of pp6r1 or pp6c decreases repair of dna double - strand breaks and sensitizes glioblastoma cells to radiation. a. two days after transfection with sirna cells were irradiated with 10 gy and either harvested immediately ( 10 gy ) or allowed to repair dna damage for 3 hours ( 10 gy + 3 hours ) prior to harvesting cells .
harvested cells were embedded in agarose plugs and subjected to pfge as described .
the bars represent the fraction of dna released from agarose plugs during pfge , normalized to sham - irradiated control (+/ - sem ) .
the data are from two independent experiments .
m059j cells were used as a negative control. b. m059k cells were transfected with control sirna or specific sirnas targeted to dna - pkcs , pp6r1 , pp6c , pp6r3 , or ars - a. two days after transfection , the m059k cells were irradiated with 0 , 2.5 , 5 gy , replated , cultured for two weeks and scored for surviving colonies .
the data points show the mean of surviving fraction +/ - sd ( n = 3 ) .
m059j cells were used as a negative control. c. representative western blot for sirna knockdown efficiency .
the blot shows the level of the proteins of interest after transfection with sirna .
ku86 is a marker for the nuclear fraction and was used as a loading control .
clonogenic survival is the ultimate in vitro assay for cellular responses to dna damage .
cells are subjected to different doses of ir , then plated at limiting dilution and the number of individual colonies consisting of greater than 50 cells that grow out after a 10 - 14 days are scored and plotted as logarithm of the fraction of initial cells vs. radiation dose .
m059k cells transfected with control sirna and the dna - pk deficient m059j cells were assayed to establish the range of response in the assay , with fewest colonies of m059j cells ( lower line ) and the most colonies of m059k cells ( upper line ) ( figure 5b ) .
we transfected m059k cells with sirna targeting dna - pkcs , or pp6c , or the pp6 subunits pp6r1 , pp6r3 , ars - a. cells knocked down for pp6r1 or pp6c exhibited a survival rate similar to that of dna - pkcs knockdown cells , separated above the line for m059j cells ( figure 5b ) .
this response indicates a higher sensitivity to ionizing radiation .
on the other hand , cells knocked down for the pp6 subunits pp6r3 or ars - a were nearly the same as m059k cells transfected with control sirna , showing no change in response to ir. thus , there was a clear distinction in responses even between different subunits of pp6 .
cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting for the level of the proteins of interest after sirna transfection ( figure 5c ) .
these results demonstrate the selectivity and effectiveness of the sirna for the various targets , so different responses can be attributed to depletion of individual proteins .
ku86 was used as the loading control .
we concluded that knock - down of pp6r1 / pp6c enhanced radiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to nearly the same extent as a deficiency of dna - pk itself .
discussion although the importance of dna - pk in dna repair is well established and has been studied extensively [ 1 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] , the mechanism by which dna - pk is regulated in response to ir remains unknown .
the current model is that the abcde and pqr clusters in dna - pkcs function reciprocally to regulate dna end - access [ 3 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 15 ] .
phosphorylation of abcde promotes end - processing by increasing accessibility , whereas phosphorylation of pqr inhibits end - processing by decreasing accessibility .
phosphorylation - induced reduction of the protein kinase activity of dna - pk is restored in vitro by the addition of the purified catalytic subunit of either pp1gamma1 or pp2a and this reactivation is blocked by the potent protein phosphatase inhibitor microcystin [ 19 ] .
moreover , the wabl group [ 18 ] reported that pp5 interacts with dna - pk and that overexpression of pp5 changes the phosphorylation dynamics of two functional sites : thr2609 and ser2056 .
another study [ 15 ] demonstrated that mutation to glu to mimic phosphorylation at the conserved thr3950 site gave an inactive the kinase , even though this mutation did not reduce the affinity of the catalytic subunit for dna - bound ku. these observations suggest that the phosphorylation status of dna - pkcs could both positively and negatively modulate the dna repair activity of dna - pk. our data show that pp6r1 / pp6 forms a complex with and activates dna - pk in response to dna damage .
knock - down of either pp6r1 or pp6c by sirna significantly reduced the activity of dna - pk in cells responding to ir. thus , dephosphorylation by pp6 , targeted by its pp6r1 subunit , offers a mechanism for the activation of dna - pk protein kinase as part of the cellular damage response .
which sites in dna - pkcs are the target of pp6 activity remain to be determined .
among the possibilities , phosphorylation of thr2609 and ser2056 was not affected by depletion of either pp6r1 or pp6c , using reagents available ( data not shown ) .
an inviting alternative is thr3950 , located in the kinase loop of dna - pkcs as an inhibitory modification , however , phosphorylation of this site increased in response to ir [ 15 ] .
pp6 may dephosphorylate sites in dna - pkcs to reduce binding with heterodimer ku proteins , because dna - pk activation completely depends on ku - mediated complex formation with dna .
our data show that endogenous dna - pk and pp6r1 bind together , and radiation enhances their association and induces pp6r1 translocation into , or at least accumulation in , the nucleus .
it is unclear what signal or modification , such as phosphorylation , triggers formation of the complex .
pp6r1 does not have an obvious nuclear localization sequence .
the association of pp6r1 with dna - pk increases pp6r1 localization in the nucleus , possibly due to the nuclear import of the dna - pk. knock - down of dna - pk prevents nuclear localization of pp6r1 and pp6 , supporting the idea of a transport complex .
alternatively , nuclear dna - pk could serve as an ir - activated anchor for localization of pp6r1 / pp6 in the nucleus. that idea begs the question of how pp6 heterotrimers of mr > 450 kda [ 27 ] enter the nucleus .
increased levels of the pp6r1 / pp6 / dna - pk complex in the nucleus likely facilitate dna repair and pp6 may have substrates other than dna - pkcs .
interestingly , epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) was reported to interact with dna - pkcs and to be over - expressed in tumors of epithelial origin [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
ir induces egfr import into the nucleus , and inhibition of radiation - induced egfr nuclear import by c225 ( cetuximab ) suppressed dna - pk activity [ 35 ] .
thus , egfr may be involved in dna pkcs activation , perhaps involving its kinase activity .
the subunit structure of pp6 has been described to include the catalytic subunit bound to a saps domain present in three different proteins , named pp6r1 , pp6r2 , pp6r3 [ 24 ] .
the saps domain can alone bind pp6 , and the saps domains in pp6r1 , r2 and r3 closely resemble one another .
it is possible more than one of the saps subunit might associate with dna - pk , and this could in part account for the unequal co - precipitation of pp6r1 and pp6c with dna - pk seen in figure 1 .
however , sirna knockdown of pp6r3 had little effect on dna - pk activation or cell survival compared to pp6r1 or pp6c .
the lack of antibodies for pp6r2 limits experiments to test these ideas .
more recent evidence shows pp6 forms heterotrimers with the saps subunits , binding one of three different ars [ 27 ] .
this does not involve or require the saps domain but instead involves a c terminal region of these pp6 subunits .
in this model the saps subunit act as a bridge or scaffold to simultaneously bind to separate domains the pp6c and the ars subunit .
it is proposed that the ankyrin repeats in the ars are used to interact with substrates or may be involved in localization .
antibody reagents are only available for ars - a , not the other proteins and knockdown of ars - a by sirna did not significantly affect clonogenic survival following ir. therefore , ars - a seems not required for pp6 effects on dna - pk , and we imagine one of the other newly discovered ars is involved in the complex with dna - pk. our discovery that pp6 and pp6r1 associate with dna - pk and are required for effective kinase activation in response to ir identify these proteins are possible drug targets for radiation sensitization .
small molecule selective inhibitors of pp6 are possible based on differences between pp6 and pp2a [ 21 ] .
alternatively , small molecule disruptors of pp6 - pp6r1 or pp6r1 - dna - pk interaction are predicted to be selective in reduction of the repair response to ir and may be useful in radiotherapy .

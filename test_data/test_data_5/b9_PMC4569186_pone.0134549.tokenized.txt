the sense of touch provides fundamental information about the surrounding world , and feedback about our own actions .
although touch is very important during the earliest stages of life , to date no study has investigated infants' abilities to process visual stimuli implying touch .
this study explores the developmental origins of the ability to visually recognize touching gestures involving others .
looking times and orienting responses were measured in a visual preference task , in which participants were simultaneously presented with two videos depicting a touching and a no - touching gesture involving human body parts ( face , hand ) and / or an object ( spoon ) .
in experiment 1 , 2 - day - old newborns and 3 - month - old infants viewed two videos : in one video a moving hand touched a static face , in the other the moving hand stopped before touching it. results showed that only 3 - month - olds , but not newborns , differentiated the touching from the no - touching gesture , displaying a preference for the former over the latter .
to test whether newborns could manifest a preferential visual response when the touched body part is different from the face , in experiment 2 newborns were presented with touching / no - touching gestures in which a hand or an inanimate object - - i.e. , a spoon - moved towards a static hand .
newborns were able to discriminate a hand - to - hand touching gesture , but they did not manifest any preference for the object - to - hand touch .
the present findings speak in favour of an early ability to visually recognize touching gestures involving the interaction between human body parts .

introduction in our daily interactions with the animate and the inanimate world , we observe touch in many situations and we attribute to it communicative and affective meanings .
among other sensory modalities , touch is the first to develop in utero and represents a primary means of learning and exploring the environment from fetal life throughout infancy [ 1 ] .
although it is commonly recognized that touch is very important early in life [ 2 , 3 ] , we know very little about how infants visually perceive others being touched .
to our knowledge , so far no study has investigated infants' ability to visually distinguish between touching and no - touching gestures .
conversely , visual processing of touch has been extensively investigated in adults [ 4 - 17 ] .
recent neuroimaging studies have shown that , when adults witness another person or even an object being touched by a human agent , neural circuitries normally recruited during the self - experience of touch are activated [ 4 , 7 - 12 ] .
activation of the somatosensory cortices during touch observation is further supported by brain stimulation [ 5 , 6 , 13 ] and lesion studies [ 14 ] , the first showing the selectivity of the human somatosensory cortex for the visual processing of contact between human body - parts [ 13 ] .
this evidence is in line with the view that adult humans are equipped with a " tactile mirror system " , which matches observed touch with the sense of one 's own touch [ 15 ] .
this system has been proposed to play a key role in social perception and empathy [ 5 , 6 , 13 , 15 - 17 ] .
already during prenatal life , infants acquire extensive somatosensory - motor experience .
in the womb fetuses perform different hand movements directed towards the environment , like the uterine wall , the umbilical cord or their own body , in particular the face [ 18 , 19 ] .
these movements appear to be well organized and coordinated [ 20 , 21 , 22 ] .
at 24 weeks of gestation , half of the fetal arm movements result in hands touching the mouth [ 21 ] , with the frequency of touch for lower and perioral regions of the face increasing significantly with gestational age .
hand - to - face gestures represent one of the most frequent activities during fetal life , and they remain a prominent behavior during the earlier stages of postnatal life [ 23 ] .
in fact , neonates often touch their face , and especially their mouth , during their waking hours [ 24 , 25 ] .
possibly due to prenatal somatosensory experiences , neonates seem to have some knowledge about their body immediately after birth [ 26 , 27 , 28 ] .
for example , they are able to discriminate between external touch and self - stimulation , displaying rooting responses when their cheek is touched by the finger of somebody else , but not by their own finger [ 27 ] .
likewise , newborns imitate observed facial and hand movements [ 29 , 30 ]. with respect to the visual processing of tactile bodily signals , zmyj and colleagues [ 31 ] have shown that 7 - and 10 - month - old infants are sensitive to intersensory visual - tactile contingency .
when presented with two videos displaying a lifelike - baby doll whose legs are touched by a hand , infants look longer at the video in which the touch is contingent with a tactile stimulation on their own leg than at a non - contingent touch. by contrast , when presented with a video showing oblong wooden blocks rather than doll legs , infant do not show any visual preference , even in the case of contingent tactile stimulation .
a recent study by filippetti et al .
( 2013 ) further showed that 1 - to - 4 - day old newborns look longer towards a video displaying a paintbrush stroking an infant 's cheek in synchrony with a tactile stimulation on their own cheek , than towards a video in which the stroke was asynchronous .
newborns show such a preference only when the observed face is depicted in its canonical upright orientation , but not when it is inverted [ 26 ] .
the ability to detect intersensory synchrony is seen as crucial in the development of an early sense of one 's own body .
in fact , the early ability to match the rhythm of a corporeal sensory event to a non - corporeal one provides infants with critical information fundamental to perceive their own body as a differentiated object among other objects in the world [ 32 ] .
unlike cross - modal visual - tactile capabilities , so far infants' ability to recognize tactile stimulations on others' body solely based on visual information has not been investigated .
rather , research has focused on infants' visual perception of goal - directed movements [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ] showing that from the earliest stages of postnatal life newborns are able to discriminate between visual cues indicating goal - directed and non - goal - directed actions , and prefer the former to the latter [ 37 ] .
although it is clear that young infants detect goal - directed hand gestures , it is still unknown whether and at which stage of development they can visually recognize hand gestures depicting touch. by touching their own face during prenatal life infants gain a great deal of somatosensory - motor experience , which might bootstrap visual discrimination between touching and no - touching gestures from the earliest stages of postnatal life .
we have addressed this issue in two experiments using a visual preference task in which two dynamic images depicting a touching gesture and a no - touching gesture involving a face , a hand or an object were presented ; looking times and orienting responses were measured .
in experiment 1 , 2 - day - old ( i.e. , newborn ) and 3 - month - old infants were shown gestures involving a moving hand approaching a static face .
in experiment 2 , 2 - day - old infants were assigned to two conditions , different with respect to the agent performing the gesture : in one condition newborn infants were presented with gestures involving a hand approaching another hand , while in the other condition the agent that performed the gesture was an object .
experiment 1 here we explored the ability of newborns and 3 - month - old infants to discriminate between dynamic hand - to - face touching and no - touching gestures .
participants were tested with an infant - control visual preference paradigm , in which they were simultaneously presented with two dynamic images depicting a hand moving towards a static face .
in one video , the hand movement ended up with a hand - to - face contact ( i.e. , touching gesture ) , in the other video the hand movement terminated before the hand - to - face contact occurred ( i.e. , no - touching gesture ) .
if prenatal experience is sufficient for developing the ability to discriminate between gestures with or without a tactile component , newborns would discriminate between the two hand gestures .
discrimination would be implied by a significant preference for either the touching gesture , which might be associated with sensorimotor experiences and rewards ( i.e. affective touch ) , or the no - touching gesture , which might be perceived as an unfamiliar , unexpected event .
method participants the final sample included 18 healthy full - term newborns ( 10 girls ; mean age : 48 h , range : 26 - 85 , mean birth weight : 3177g , apgar score : at least 8 after 5 minutes ) and 18 3 - month - old infants ( 10 girls ; mean age : 94 days , range : 82 - 103 days ) .
only one 3 - month - old and none of the newborns reported to have a twin .
newborns were recruited at the maternity unit of the san gerardo hospital in monza while 3 - month - old infants were recruited via a database of parents who had agreed to participate in the study .
five additional newborns and six 3 - month - olds were tested but excluded from the final sample due to fussiness ( n = 3 newborns ; n = 4 3 - month - olds ) or position bias ( i.e. , looking more that 85 % of the time in one direction , n = 2 newborns , n = 2 3 - month - olds ) .
all newborns and infants were tested when they were awake and in an alert state .
the protocol was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of the declaration of helsinki ( bmj 1991 ; 302 : 1194 ) and approved by the ethics committees of the san gerardo hospital and the university of milan - bicocca .
written informed consent was obtained from parents before the beginning of the study .
stimuli stimuli were two greyscale videos showing a hand moving towards a static young woman face on a black background .
one video showed the hand reaching for the face and touching it on the cheek ( touching gesture ) , while the other video showed the hand stopping at a distance of about 2.5 cm from the face ( no - touching gesture ) .
each video comprised of seven frames .
all frames depicted the face in the same frontal pose and central position within the image , whereas the hand changed position across the frames .
the first two frames were the same for the touching and no - touching stimuli : frame 1 depicted the hand in the lower corner of the image with the palm facing the observer ; as the hand made a 90degrees rotation on the vertical axis , frame 2 presented a sideway hand with the thumb in front and the other fingers aligned vertically .
the following 5 frames showed the hand moving diagonally towards the static face , with an angle of 44degrees in the touching gesture and of 65degrees in the no - touching gesture ( fig 1 ) .
the amount of movement performed by the hand was the same on the vertical axis in the touching and no - touching stimuli , and differed between the stimuli on the horizontal axis ( i.e. , 0.5 cm ) .
both stimuli were presented simultaneously on the screen , and had the same duration ( video a in s1 file ) : each of the seven frames lasted 571 ms , for a total duration of 4 s. luminance , contrast , and hue , as well as saturation , were kept constant between frames and stimuli .
the videos of touching and no - touching gestures were presented bilaterally and played continuously , in a loop .
the dimension of the hand at a distance of 40 cm from the screen ranged between 6.4degrees and 7.9degrees of visual angle in width , and between 14.2degrees and 24.7degrees of visual angle in height .
the face was 14degrees wide and 21degrees high , and the distance between the faces depicted in the bilaterally presented videos was 39.2degrees .
the , external contour of the eyes subtended a visual angle of 3.7degrees x 2degrees , and the eyes iris was 1 cm in diameter .
the face stimulus was taken from our own database [ 38 ] .

* = p < . 05 procedure newborns were tested in a dedicated room at the hospital , whereas 3 - month - olds were tested in a testing room at the university of milan - bicocca .
an undergraduate student , blind to the aim of the study , sat with the newborn on the lap in front of the stimulus presentation monitor ( 27 " screen size , 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution , 60 hz ) at a distance of about 30 - 40 cm. a video camera recording the newborns' gaze direction was positioned above the monitor ; the video camera sent a visual input to a laptop controlled by a second experimenter , who coded online newborns' gaze and ran the experiment , which was designed with e - prime 2 ( psychology software tools ) .
three - month - olds sat in an infant seat in front of the stimulus presentation monitor ( 24 " screen size , 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution , 60 hz ) , at a distance of about 40 - 50 cm. both groups were tested using a preferential looking paradigm with an infant - control procedure .
stimulus presentation began as soon as the infant looked at a red flickering circle appearing in the center of the screen ; after its disappearance , the two experimental trials were presented .
in each trial , touch and no - touch stimuli were shown simultaneously and bilaterally on the screen .
the left / right position of the stimuli in the first trial was counterbalanced across participants , and reversed between the first and the second trial. between the two trials , the central circle re - appeared to attract the infants' gaze .
each trial ended when the infant watched each stimulus at least once , and shifted their gaze away for more than 10 s. on average , newborns watched 16 ( sd = 5.29 ) video sequences in the first trial and 15 ( sd = 4.04 ) in the second trial , while 3 - month - olds watched 13 ( sd = 4.23 ) video sequences in the first trial and 16 ( sd = 7.49 ) in the second one .
gaze direction and fixation times were coded online by the experimenter , who was blind to the left / right position of the stimuli on the screen ; the number of orienting responses and total fixation times ( i.e. , sum of all fixations ) on the stimuli were recorded as dependent variables [ 39 ] .
the experimenter used right and left buttons of the mouse to code the corresponding newborns' gaze direction ( right , left or none ) ; the duration of infants' fixations corresponded to the duration of button pressing by the experimenter .
video - recordings of eye movements were coded offline for 50 % of the infants by an observer , blind to the hypotheses of the study and the stimuli shown .
inter - coder agreement ( pearson correlation ) was . 91 for total fixation time and . 82 for number of orientations for the newborns , and . 97 and . 99 , respectively , for the 3 - month - olds .
the intra - class correlation ( icc ) coefficient was . 94 for total fixation time and . 87 for number of orientations for the newborns , and . 98 and . 99 , respectively , for the 3 - month - olds .
results to determine whether newborns and 3 - month - old infants were able to discriminate between touching and no - touching gestures , two separate repeated - measures analyses of variance ( rmanovas ) were performed on total fixation times and number of orienting responses , with trial ( first vs. second ) and gesture ( touching vs. no - touching ) as within - subjects factors , and age ( newborns vs. 3 - month - olds ) as the between - subjects factor .
the rmanova on total fixation times showed a significant trial x gesture x age interaction , f 1,34 = 9.12 , p = . 005 , eta 2 = . 093 , as well as a trial x age interaction , f 1,34 = 5.20 , p = . 03 , eta 2 = . 182 .
the 3 - way interaction was explored through separate 2 - way anovas , one for each age group , with trial and gesture as within - subjects factors .
for newborns , the analysis showed no significant main effects or interaction ( all ps > . 1 ) ( fig 1 ) .
for 3 - month - olds , the analysis revealed a main effect of trial , f 1,17 = 5.37 , p = . 033 , eta 2 = . 046 , gesture , f 1,17 = 5.03 , p = . 038 , eta 2 = . 053 , and a significant trial x gesture interaction , f 1,17 = 6.62 , p = . 020 , eta 2 = . 160 .
the main effect of gesture showed that , overall , infants looked longer at the touching ( m = 66.61 , sd = 29.78 ) than at the no - touching gesture ( m = 50.44 , sd = 19.48 ) .
the preference for the touching gesture was apparent during the second trial , as revealed by the significant trial x gesture interaction .
in fact , multiple post - hoc comparisons ( by means of the newman - keuls test ) showed that , during the second trial , infants looked longer at the touching gesture ( m = 44.10 , sd = 27.45 ) than at the no - touching gesture ( m = 22.02 , sd = 9.61 ) , ( p = . 047 , cohen 's d = . 78 ) , whereas in the first trial they looked equally long at the touching ( m = 22.51 , sd = 12.65 ) and the no - touching gesture ( m = 28.42 , sd = 18.77 ) ( p = . 45 , cohen 's d = . 22 ) ( fig 1 ) .
looking times to the touching gesture were also significantly longer in the second trial ( m = 44.10 , sd = 27.45 ) than in the first trial ( m = 22.51 , sd = 12.65 ) , ( p = . 031 , cohen 's d = . 70 ) .
all the others comparisons failed to reach significance ( all ps > . 05 ) .
the analyses on orienting responses confirmed and extended the results obtained for looking times .
the 3 - way rmanova revealed a significant trial x gesture x age interaction , f 1,34 = 4.15 , p = . 049 , eta 2 = . 005 .
separate anovas , with trial and gesture as within - subjects factors , were then performed for each age group .
for newborns , the analysis did not reveal significant main effects or interactions ( all ps > . 2 ) , whereas for 3 - month - olds there was a main effect of gesture , f 1,17 = 6.44 , p = . 021 , eta 2 = . 031 , as well as a significant trial x gesture interaction , f 1,17 = 5.94 , p = . 026 , eta 2 = . 056 .
the main effect of gesture showed that infants oriented their gaze more frequently towards the touching gesture ( m = 21.61 , sd = 16.23 ) as compared to the no - touching gesture ( m = 19.61 , sd = 14.43 ) .
however , multiple post - hoc comparisons ( newman - keuls test ) for the trial x gesture interaction showed that it was during the second trial that infants oriented their gaze more often to the touching gesture ( m = 12.28 , sd = 7.46 ) , compared to the no - touching gesture ( m = 9.94 , sd = 6.65 ) , ( p = . 008 , cohen 's d = . 67 ). by contrast , in the first trial they oriented equally towards the touching ( m = 9.33 , sd = 9.52 ) and no - touching gesture ( m = 9.66 , sd = 8.39 ) ( p = . 67 , cohen 's d = . 16 ) ( fig 1 ) .
orienting responses in the second trial were also more frequently directed towards the touching gesture ( m = 12.27 , sd = 7.46 ) as compared to both the touching ( m = 9.33 , sd = 9.52 ) ( p = . 007 , cohen 's d = . 55 ) and the no - touching gesture ( m = 9.66 , sd = 8.39 ) ( p = . 01 , cohen 's d = . 61 ) of the first trial .
all the others comparisons failed to reach significance ( all ps > . 6 ) .
discussion three - month - olds , but not newborns , were able to differentiate between the two stimuli , as shown by longer looking times and more frequent orientations towards the touching than the no - touching hand - to - face gesture .
a possible interpretation of the lack of discrimination in newborns may refer to the saliency of the face stimulus , which may trigger newborns' attention , preventing them to differentiate the touching vs. no - touching gesture .
indeed , since the first hours of postnatal life faces are highly salient to infants , capturing their attention under a variety of conditions [ 40 , 41 , 42 ] .
an alternative interpretation of the null result could be that the differences between the two gestures are not marked enough in our stimuli to be detected by newborns' immature visual system .
the differences between the two gestures became more evident during the last frames of the videos and , thus , newborns may not have had enough time to detect them. with the aim of disentangling between these different interpretations , in experiment 2 we investigated newborns' ability to discriminate between touching / no - touching gestures when the tactile events are directed towards a body part other than the face .
experiment 2 experiment 2 aims at exploring whether newborns are able to discriminate touching from no - touching gestures when presented with hand gestures directed towards a non - face body part , such as the hand .
a further aim of experiment 2 is to examine whether the social nature of the agent performing the gesture is critical in triggering newborns' visual sensitivity to touch .
in order to address this issue , experiment 2 introduced a new condition : a second group of newborns was presented with two dynamic images depicting an inanimate object approaching or touching a static hand .
method participants the final sample included 34 healthy full - term newborns ( 13 girls ; mean age : 46 h , range : 24 - 101 , mean birth weight : 3410g , apgar score : at least 8 after 5 minutes ) , recruited from the maternity unit of the san gerardo hospital in monza .
none of the newborns was reported to have a twin .
newborns were assigned to two different experimental conditions : 17 newborns belonged to the social condition , 17 to the non - social condition .
eight additional newborns were tested but excluded from the final sample due to fussiness ( n = 4 ) or position bias ( i.e. , looking more that 85 % of the time in one direction ) ( n = 4 ) .
all newborns were tested when they were awake and in an alert state .
the protocol was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of the declaration of helsinki ( bmj 1991 ; 302 : 1194 ) and approved by the ethics committees of the san gerardo hospital and the university of milan - bicocca .
written informed consent was obtained from parents before the beginning of the study .
stimuli the technical features of the stimuli , as well as the experimental approach , were the same as in experiment 1 .
half of the newborns were presented with touching / no - touching gestures in which a hand moved towards a static hand ( social condition ) while the other half was presented with a spoon approaching a static hand ( non - social condition ) ( fig 2 ) .
touching and no - touching stimuli were presented simultaneously on the screen ( videos b and c in s1 file ) .
the dimension of the moving hand at a distance of 40 cm from the screen was the same as in experiment 1 , while the dimension of the spoon ranged between 4.3degrees and 9.3degrees of visual angle in width and between 14degrees and 24.7degrees of visual angle in height .
the static hand was positioned with the palm facing the observer and was 7.9degrees wide and 17.8degrees high .
the distance between the static hands depicted in the bilaterally presented videos was 39.2degrees .
the moving spoon and the moving hand were positioned in each frame at the same distance from the static hand .

* = p < . 05 procedure the procedure was the same as in experiment 1 .
newborns watched an average of 14 ( sd = 5.72 ) video sequences in the first trial and 14 ( sd = 7.73 ) sequences in the second trial .
the intercoder agreement ( pearson correlation ) on 50 % of the participants was . 82 for total fixation time and . 86 for number of orientations .
the icc coefficient was . 99 for both total fixation time and number of orientations .
results the rmanova on total fixation times with trial ( first vs. second ) and gesture ( touching vs. no - touching ) as within - subjects factors , and condition ( social vs. non - social ) as the between subject - factor showed a significant main effect of condition , f 1,32 = 5.78 , p = . 022 , eta 2 = . 055 , and a significant trial x gesture x condition interaction , f 1,32 = 7.42 , p = . 010 , eta 2 = . 08 .
the 3 - way interaction was explored through separate 2 - way anova , with trial and gesture as within - subjects factors .
for the non - social condition , the analysis showed no significant main effects or interaction ( all ps > . 1 ) ( fig 2 ) .
for the social condition , the analysis revealed a significant trial x gesture interaction , f 1,16 = 6.71 , p = . 020 , eta 2 = . 120 .
based on the results obtained in experiment 1 , we explored this interaction with a set of planned comparisons , by means of t - test with the bonferroni correction .
during the first trial newborns looked equally longer at the touching ( m = 36.68 , sd = 19.83 ) and the no - touching gesture ( m = 28.68 , sd = 16.08 ) , t 16 = 1.299 , p = . 424 , cohen 's d = . 315 ( two - tailed ) , whereas in the second trial they looked significantly longer to the no - touching ( m = 45.87 , sd = 23.43 ) compared to the touching gesture ( m = 26.64 , sd = 15.41 ) , t 16 = 2.977 , p = . 018 , cohen 's d = . 722 ( two - tailed ) ( fig 2 ) .
the 3 - way rmanova performed on orienting responses revealed a significant main effect of condition , f 1,32 = 4.32 , p = . 046 , eta 2 = . 068 , of trial , f 1,32 = 17.58 , p = . 0002 , eta 2 = . 088 , and a significant trial x gesture x condition interaction , f 1,32 = 6.54 , p = . 015 , eta 2 = . 014 .
separate anovas for each condition ( social , non - social ) with trial and gesture as within - subjects factors were then performed .
for the non - social condition , the analysis revealed only a significant main effect of trial , f 1,16 = 12.83 , p = . 002 , eta 2 = . 215 .
newborns oriented more frequently in the second trial ( m = 18.65 , sd = 8.35 ) than in the first one ( m = 13.18 , sd = 3.36 ) , independently of the type of gesture .
differently , for the social condition there was a significant main effect of trial , f 1,16 = 7.46 , p = . 015 , eta 2 = . 204 , as well as a significant trial x gesture interaction , f 1,16 = 12.95 , p = . 002 , eta 2 = . 075 .
planned paired t - test ( with bonferroni correction ) showed that in the first trial newborns oriented their gaze more frequently towards the touching ( m = 10.41 , sd = 4.40 ) than the no - touching gesture ( m = 7.47 , sd = 3.61 ) , t 16 = 3.178 , p = . 012 , cohen 's d = . 77 ( two - tailed ) , whereas in the second trial they oriented their gaze almost equally towards the touching gesture ( m = 11.76 , sd = 6.13 ) and the no - touching gesture ( m = 13 , sd = 7.63 ) , t 16 = 1.182 , p = . 508 , cohen 's d = . 28 ( two - tailed ) ( fig 2 ) .
overall , these findings indicate that newborns are actually able to visually distinguish between touching and no - touching gestures involving two hands .
crucially , newborns do not manifest any preference when presented with a non - social touch , such as that provided by an inanimate object like a spoon .
general discussion this study explored the developmental origins of the ability to visually recognize touching gestures involving human body parts ( face , hand ) and / or an object ( spoon ) .
in experiment 1 , only 3 - month - olds , but not newborns , manifested a visual preference for a human hand - to - face touching gesture over a no - touching gesture .
this indicates that 3 - month - olds differentiated between a hand - to - face gesture that led to touch and a comparable gesture in which touch did not occur .
three - month - olds' discrimination between the hand - to - face touching and no - touching gesture was accompanied by a visual preference towards the touching gesture , which was evident for both fixation times and orienting responses .
in experiment 2 we removed the potential interference effect generated by newborns' sensitivity to faces by comparing newborns' gaze and looking behavior while watching touching and no - touching gestures directed towards a different human body part , namely a hand .
under this condition , 2 - days - old newborns were able to differentiate between touching and no - touching gestures .
specifically , during the first trial newborns' attention was attracted by the touching gesture , as shown by newborns' orienting responses .
then , in the second trial their attention was held for longer time by the no - touching hand - to - hand gesture , as testified by their total looking times .
crucially , newborns' preference vanished when the agent of the gesture was an inanimate object , namely the spoon .
a possible interpretation of 3 - month - olds' spontaneous preference for the touching hand - to - face gesture is that gestures that comprise a tactile event are those that infants commonly experience during their daily interactions with others , and that provide them with both somatosensory and affective / communicative information .
when observing a hand approaching a face , infants might expect the moving hand to fulfill its communicative and affective goal through touch , consequently making the hand - to - face touching gesture particularly salient and attractive for infants .
three - month - olds' preference for the touching gesture was apparent in the second trial .
this might be due to the saliency of face , which may have captured infants' attention , to the point of masking the difference between the two hand - to - face gestures .
accordingly , infants appreciated the differences between the two hand gestures only during the second trial , when they shifted their attention from the face to the gesture .
future studies might confirm this interpretation by using an eye - tracker procedure to record infants' scanning pattern on the stimuli .
interestingly , newborns were able to distinguish touching from no - touching gestures when two hands were involved .
newborns' ability to discriminate between these two gestures likely relies on the somatosensory - motor experience accumulated in the womb and in the first hours after birth .
such an experience might drive newborns' expectation that , when a hand is moving towards another hand , the approaching gesture will lead to contact , i.e. a touching event .
in this vein , the switch in the direction of newborns' preference between the first and the second trial would imply a switch from a familiarity preference ( i.e. , for the familiar touching event ) to a novelty preference ( i.e. , for the unexpected no - touching event ) .
irrespective of the factor driving the change in the direction of newborns' preference across trials , the crucial finding here is that newborns can discriminate touching versus no - touching hand gestures .
it is noteworthy that , in infant research , looking time is typically considered as a more sensitive measure of infants' visual processing , than number of gaze orientations [ 43 ] .
the direction of visual preference expressed by looking times in the current study was different for newborns and 3 - month - olds infants , as the preference was towards the no - touching gesture for newborns in experiment 2 and towards the touching gesture for 3 - month - olds in experiment 1 .
unlike 3 - month - olds , newborns have limited experience with interpersonal bodily interactions involving tactile contact and , thus , they might have also limited ability to decode the affective and communicative implications of touch .
during prenatal life , fetuses' tactile contacts are mainly related to the exploration of their own body and of the surrounding womb environment ; within 3 - months of postnatal life tactile experiences acquire an affective valence .
the affective / communicative relevance that touch acquires through early interpersonal bodily experiences might explain the different visual behavior of newborns and 3 - month - olds .
on the other hand , there are indications that already during prenatal life fetuses have a natural predisposition to social interactions : when fetuses have to share the uterine environment with their co - twin , they touch and explore their twins' body and these social contacts increase during the second semester of gestation [ 44 ] .
this raises the question of the effect of such prenatal interpersonal contacts on newborns' visual processing of touching / no touching gestures .
if newborns successfully discriminate between touching / no - touching body - related , potentially social , gestures thanks to their early somatosensory - motor experiences , their failure to show a preference in the presence of touches when the agent of the touch is an inanimate object may be attributed to their limited experience with gestures involving objects .
however , it is important to note that the absence of a preference for either touching or no - touching object - to - hand gestures does not necessarily imply that newborns cannot discriminate them .
they just might not have any expectation about the possible outcomes of a gesture that involves an object .
the difference in newborns' visual behavior between the hand - to - hand and the object - to - hand condition of experiment 2 supports the view that , shortly after birth , infants are tuned to human social gestures involving body - parts contact .
taken together , the present evidence suggests that somatosensory - motor associations accumulated in the womb and in the first hours after birth may be sufficient to allow newborns to link executed with observed touching gestures .
moreover , infants' spontaneous preferential responses to touching or no - touching gestures seem to be modulated by somatosensory - motor , visual and affective / communicative experiences .
finally , the fact that newborns' early sensitivity to touch is specific to gestures with an higher social component , here a human body - to - body contact , suggests that the social nature of the gesture plays a key role in triggering newborns' visual attention from the very early stages of postnatal life .
in this regard , it is also noteworthy the evidence in human adults indicating that the human tactile mirror system , in particular some of its cortical regions , may be best tuned to represent human body - part interactions , than the contact between inanimate objects , or between human body - parts and objects [ 4 , 13 , 15 ] , and it differentially responds to the sight of an intentional touch as compared to an accidental touch [ 9 ] .
the sight of a touching , body - related , gesture provides infants with important information about the social world from very early in life , since touch implies a nonverbal communication of intentions and affect .
given fetuses' organized and coordinated movements [ 22 ] and newborns' early ability to detect synchrony between an observed and a felt body - related touch [ 26 ] , we expected that from the earliest stages of postnatal life infants could visually discriminate between touching and no - touching gestures .
our results support this prediction , highlighting the importance of pre - and post - natal experience in the visual processing of touching gestures involving others' body .

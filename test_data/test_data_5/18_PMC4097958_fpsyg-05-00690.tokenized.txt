this paper investigates the production and perception of different articulation techniques on the saxophone .
in a production experiment , two melodies were recorded that required different effectors to play the tones ( tongue - only actions , finger - only actions , combined tongue and finger actions ) at three different tempi .
a sensor saxophone reed was developed to monitor tongue - reed interactions during performance .
in the slow tempo condition , combined tongue - finger actions showed improved timing , compared to the timing of the tongue alone .
this observation supports the multiple timer hypothesis where the tongue 's timekeeper benefits from a coupling to the timekeeper of the fingers .
in the fast tempo condition , finger - only actions were less precise than tongue - only actions and timing precision of combined tongue - finger actions showed the higher timing variability , close to the level of finger - only actions .
this suggests that the finger actions have a dominant influence on the overall timing of saxophone performance .
in a listening experiment we investigated whether motor expertise in music performance influences the perception of articulation techniques in saxophone performance .
participants with different backgrounds in music making ( saxophonists , musicians not playing the saxophone , and non - musicians ) attended an ab - x listening test .
they had to discriminate between saxophone phrases played with different articulation techniques ( legato , portato , staccato ) .
participants across all three groups discriminated the sound of staccato articulation well from the sound of portato articulation and legato articulation .
errors occurred across all groups of listeners when legato articulation ( no tonguing ) and portato articulation ( soft tonguing ) had to be discriminated .
saxophonists' results were superior compared to the results of the other two groups , suggesting that expertise in saxophone playing facilitated the discrimination task .
saxophone articulation music performance timing sensors acoustics 1 .
introduction producing expressive sound on single - reed woodwind instruments is a highly sophisticated motor task , requiring coordination between the fingers , aural cavity , and respiration ( scavone et al. , 2008 ; chen et al. , 2011 ; almeida et al. , 2013 ) .
on the saxophone , a single reed of cane ( or synthetic material ) , thinned on one end , is attached to the bottom side of a beak - shaped mouthpiece ( nederveen , 1998 ; pinard et al. , 2003 ) .
the player encloses the tip of the mouthpiece with his lips and blows into the tip opening .
during sound production , the player 's air stream excites the reed so that it oscillates related to the frequency of the impedance peak inside the instrument body ( fletcher , 1979 ; dalmont et al. , 2003 ; almeida et al. , 2010 ) .
to perform expressively on woodwind instruments , the player may use a range of parameters to shape longer sequences of tones such as onset timing and tempo or the loudness of individual tones .
an important dimension in woodwind performance is tongued articulation , thus referring to the way the tongue controls the shape of tone onsets , tone offsets , and the connections between tones ( see krautgartner , 1982 ; bengtsson and gabrielsson , 1983 ; liebman , 2006 ) .
goolsby ( 1997 ) reported that more than 21 % of professional band rehearsal time is spend on instructions of articulation .
articulation techniques on saxophone can be grouped in two main types : tongued articulation techniques and articulation without tonguing .
legato articulation does not involve tonguing and its sounding result is the smoothest note transition .
herby , only changes of the fingerings determine the timing and precision of note transitions .
professional fingering technique is required to produce smooth and clean legato tone - transitions on wind instruments ( almeida et al. , 2009 ) .
for tongued note transitions , the intensity and duration of the tongue stroke defines the sounding result .
portato articulation is produced by soft tongue strokes to the vibrating reed , while the player blows constantly .
the sound of consecutive portato tones has been described to be close to that of legato ; the subdivision of tones is very subtle .
liebman ( 2006 ) gives instructions to the technique of tonguing on saxophone as follows : " it is the front portion of the tongue containing muscle tissue which flaps upward stroking the reed. " the resulting effect is that " the reed 's motion and sound are momentarily stopped .
the actual sounding of the articulation comes with the release of the reed " ( p. 28 ) .
in contrast to the soft sound of portato separated tones , staccato tones are sharp and short .
these are produced by placing the tongue immediately back on the reed after the initial articulation .
a consequence of these two different techniques of articulation ( tongued , non - tongued ) , the timing of the performance is controlled either by tonguing or by the fingers .
timing precision in the execution of complex movement patterns is essential for musicians to produce rhythm in a sequences of tones .
palmer et al .
( 2009 ) investigated the influence of finger trajectories on temporal accuracy in clarinet performance , but restricted their focus on legato articulation .
they reported a positive relationship between peak accelerations of finger movements and temporal accuracy of the performance , and concluded that tactile information available to the fingers supports timing control , similar to observations made with piano players ( goebl and palmer , 2008 ) .
in woodwind performance , the fingers have to be coordinated with tongue movements to produce expressive sound .
studies based on isochronous tapping tasks showed that a coupling of synchronous movements operated by multiple effectors improved temporal stability .
experiments by ivry et al .
( 2002 ) showed that synchronous tapping with both hands improved temporal stability , compared to tapping with only one hand .
additional foot tapping enabled further temporal improvements .
in the case of saxophone performance , when tongue and finger actions have to be coordinated , the multiple effector advantage may also be the case .
in line with these findings , we hypothesize that there is a positive influence of combined tongue - finger actions on the temporal stability in saxophone performance .
in this study we will investigate how different articulation techniques in single - reed woodwind performance affect performance timing .
perception and action in human motor control are strongly connected .
the motor theory of speech perception argues that human understanding of speech - based auditory stimuli is based on the ability to recognize related vocal tract movements required to produce equivalent sounds ( liberman and mattingly , 1985 ; galantucci et al. , 2006 ) .
neuroimaging studies have shown that brain areas active in speech production are also active for speech listening ( fitch et al. , 1997 ; fadiga et al. , 2002 ; d'ausilio et al. , 2009 ) .
similar observations have been made for the production and perception of music ( see manto et al. 2012 for an overview ) .
overlap in the neural regions active when professional pianists listen to familiar pieces and the regions active when they perform these pieces has been observed ( haueisen and knosche , 2001 ) .
the link between production and perception of music has been further discussed in the theory of auditory - motor interaction for music making ( zatorre et al. , 2007 ) .
recent research has shown that musicians are superior in judging asynchrony between sound and body movements for performances on the instruments they master than for performances on other instruments ( bishop and goebl , under review ) .
taking into account that professional saxophone players practice over a decade to acquire the skill level to produce fast tone sequences with fluent articulation , we hypothesize that this motor expertise may also improve the ability to perceive articulation in saxophone performance .
in this paper , we investigate articulation techniques in saxophone performances in two experiments .
in a production experiment , we examine timing measures in relation to effector combinations ( tongue , finger , and both ) , finger movement directions ( pressing for tone onsets vs. releasing for tone onsets ) , and different articulation techniques ( legato , portato , staccato ) .
in a second experiment , we test whether motor expertise in a particular field ( i.e. , saxophone performance ) influences the perception of different articulation techniques in recorded saxophone sounds .
2. experiment 1 : production task 2.1 .
methods 2.1.1 .
participants seven female and twelve male graduate saxophone students from the university of music and performing arts vienna ( n = 19 , mean age = 23 years , range = 18 - 33 years ) participated in this study .
on average , the participants played their instrument for 10.7 years ( range = 4.5 - 20 years ) and practiced 1.9 h per day ( sd = 0.97 ) .
eleven saxophonists reported they play classical music only , while the remaining eight participants perform usually as members of jazz ensembles .
2.1.2 .
experimental design two isochronous 24 - tone melodies were designed for the experiment .
both melodies consisted of the same elements ( figure 1 ) : the first part ( note number 1 - 8 ) is a tone repetition , produced by only tongue actions with no change of fingerings .
the following notes ( 9 - 24 ) require a sequential depression ( melody 1 ) or release ( melody 2 ) of keys by left - hand fingers .
both melodies were given as a score for alto - saxophone ( sounding a major sixth lower than notated ) , with additional portato , staccato , and legato articulation instructions .
in legato articulation tone repetitions are not possible to play , thus note numbers 1 - 8 were omitted in the score .
figure 1 stimuli used for the production experiment .
two 24 - tone melodies in e - flat notation .
note numbers 1 - 8 require tonguing only .
in melody one ( top ) , note numbers 9 - 24 require sequential key - depression by left - hand fingers .
in melody two ( bottom ) a sequential finger lifting is required to open the tone - holes of the instrument .
2.1.3 .
equipment the experimental set up consisted of a sensor - equipped alto - saxophone , a microphone , a digital metronome , and a multi - channel recording device .
strain gauge sensors ( 2 mm , 120 ohms ) attached to synthetic saxophone reeds ( by legere reeds , ltd. ) were used to capture the bending of the reed during performance ( figure 2 ) .
the strain gauge was part of a wheatstone quarter bridge circuit with 5 v ( dc ) power supply ( hofmann et al. , 2013a ) .
the sensor reed , the microphone ( c414 , by akg acoustics ) and the digital metronome ( kdm - 1 , by korg inc. ) were connected via bnc cables to a multichannel analog - digital converter ( daq labview 2011 , by national instruments corp. ) to capture the signals simultaneously .
all signals were recorded onto computer hard disk ( a / d conversion with sampling rate 11.025 khz , 16 bit resolution ) .

2.1.4 .
procedure the experiment was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki : participants gave written consent prior to the experiment , played under normal performance conditions , and received a nominal fee at the end of the experiment .
in the beginning of the experiment , each player had to choose a synthetic saxophone reed out of four different reed - strengths ( legere : 2.0 , 2.25 , 2.5 , 2.75 ) .
all saxophonists were allowed to use their own mouthpiece but played on the same alto - saxophone ( 77 - sa , by stagg ) .
the metronome provided the synchronization signal on each quarter - note beat .
the introduced tempi were 120 beats per minute ( slow , ioi for eighth notes = 250 ms ) , 168 bpm ( medium , ioi = 178.6 ms ) , and 208 bpm ( fast , ioi = 144.2 ms ) .
all participants got a 5 min warm - up , to practice the melody with the metronome at a slow tempo .
for the experiment , each participant played both melodies in legato , portato , and staccato articulation .
they synchronized with the metronome for two repetitions and continued playing when the metronome was muted , until the melody had been played 6 times in total .
we recorded two trials per tempo condition , ordered from the slowest to the fastest .
the experiment lasted for approximately 1 h per participant .
in total 4644 tones were recorded per player ( 2 melodies x 2 trials x 3 tempi x 3 articulations ; containing 145 tones for portato and staccato and 97 tones for legato ) .
after their performances , the participants filled in a questionnaire about their musical background and the experiences with the sensor saxophone .
2.1.5 .
data analysis sensor equipped saxophone reeds were used to capture the bending of the vibrating reed during human performance .
figure 3 shows typical sensor reed signals in relation to the radiated sound under three different articulation techniques .
in legato articulation ( figure 3a ) no tongue stroke was performed , contrary to portato articulation ( figure 3b ) , and staccato articulation ( figure 3c ) .
the tongue strokes to the vibrating reed are visible in the captured signals , because the tongue presses the reed toward the mouthpiece lay and thereby damps the reed vibrations .
we define two characteristic landmarks : first , a tongue - reed contact ( trc ) , when the tongue touches the reed , second , a tongue - reed release ( trr ) , when the tongue releases the reed and initiates the succeeding tone .
figure 3 alto - saxophone sensor reed signals and radiated sound recorded in an anechoic chamber , showing a note transition ( d2 - e2 - d2 ) under a tempo instruction of 250 ms inter - onset interval ( audio sampling rate 44.1 khz ) .
examples are taken from the pool of stimuli for the perception experiment in section 3 .
( a ) reed signal for legato articulation without tonguing ( red ) and radiated sound ( black ) ; ( b ) reed signal ( blue ) for portato articulation with tongued note onsets ( tongue reed release , trr ) and note offsets ( tongue reed contact , trc ) and radiated sound ( black ) ; ( c ) reed signal ( green ) for staccato articulation , with extended tongue - reed contact duration and radiated sound ( black ) .
the data captured during the experiment contained more than 88,000 played tones , which makes a manual transcription impossible .
a multiresolution analysis ( mra ) based on wavelet methods has been used successfully for the analysis of various time critical signals , ranging from medical data ( i.e. , ecg time series , percival and walden , 2006 ) to transcriptions of drum patterns in audio recordings ( kronland - martinet et al. , 1987 ; tzanetakis et al. , 2001 ; paradzinets et al. , 2006 ) .
the following section discusses a landmark detection function ( ldf ) based on a wavelet decomposition of the sensor reed signal , where the external libraries ( wmtsa , msprocess ) were used in the r - statistics software package ( r core team , 2013 ) .
the reed signal was decomposed using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform ( modwt ) of level j0 = 11 .
a daubechies least asymmetric 8 - tap filter la ( 8 ) allows direct reference from the modwt details to actual times in the reed signal .
figure 4 shows the algorithm of the ldf , working in two main steps .
first , extrema in detail d ~ 11 ( time resolution : ^ t = 92.88 ms ) were labeled .
these extrema represent reed displacements caused by the tongue .
hereby , maxima of d ~ 11 were labeled as trr , because the following signal decrease is an indicator that the player released the tongue .
minima were labeled as trc because a contact with the reed must have happened before releasing the reed .
second , landmarks were shifted to the extrema in details with a higher time resolution ( d ~ 10 , d ~ 9 , and d ~ 8 : tau8 ^ t = 11.61 ms ) .
a special treatment of the legato recordings was required to locate tone transitions without tongue actions .
to ensure comparable detection results , the same modwt analysis was applied to the legato recordings , but with an adapted ldf which worked on details d ~ 10 , d ~ 9 , and d ~ 8 only .
one participant 's data had to be omitted completely from the analysis , as the sensor data indicated that no tonguing was used in any of the playing conditions .
figure 4 maximal overlap discret wavelet transform of a sensor reed signal containing tongued articulation : the figure shows the input signal ( top ) including detected landmarks ( trc : red circle , trr : green circle ) and the details of the wavelet decompositon d ~ 11 - 5 ( below ) .
the landmark detection function labeled maxima ( green ) and minima ( red ) in detail d ~ 11 .
these positions were refined to extrema of d ~ 10 , d ~ 9 , and d ~ 8 .
to evaluate the quality of the ldf , it was tested on a small data set which contained 2020 manually annotated landmarks .
starting from the annotated ground truth , the existence and number of detected landmarks around the annotated events was checked .
the standard measures precision , recall , and f - measure were used .
recall describes the completeness of the search and precision gives status about the quality of the search results .
f - measure combines the two previous measures .
overall , the wavelet - based analysis gave satisfactory results of the detection tasks with f - measure > 94 % ( see hofmann et al .
2013b for details on the analysis of the sensor reed signals ) .
to check possible influences of the ldf to the regularity of the extracted landmarks , we calculated the time differences of all detected landmarks to the manually annotated landmarks of the ground truth data set .
a mean deviation of 0.42 ms ( sd = 6.84 ) showed that the detected landmarks were close to the annotated landmarks .
2.2 .
results and discussion 2.2.1 .
timing of performed melodies to examine timing of the produced sequences , we calculated inter - onset intervals ( ioi , in ms ) , as the time interval between two subsequent trr ( onset ) landmarks ( ioix = tx + 1 - tx ). from these iois we calculated the timing error ( accuracy ) and the coefficient of variation ( cv , precision ) .
the timing error ( ioiobs - ioiexp )/ ioiexp describes the relative deviation from the given tempo .
a negative value corresponds to a sequence played too fast ; a positive value to a sequence played too slow .
the temporal precision of the played melody was calculated ( cv = sdioi / meanioi ) to examine the regularity of the tone - events .
cv values close to zero correspond to high regularity in the sequence , while larger values indicate higher variability in the onset distribution .
the average signed timing error of all performances during the synchronization phase was close to zero ( m = 0.0077 , sd = 0.032 ) .
figure 5a ( solid line ) shows that all participants were able to play the melodies together with the metronome click in all three tempi .
a two - way repeated measures analysis of variance ( anova ) on timing error by tempo condition ( metronome ioi = 250 ms , 178.6 ms , 144.2 ms ) and synchronization condition ( with metronome = synchronization , without metronome = continuation ) indicated a significant main effect of tempo [ f ( 2 , 34 ) = 13.23 , p < 0.001 ] as well as a significant interaction between tempo and synchronization f ( 2 , 34 ) = 35.77 , p < 0.001 .
without metronome click , participants increased the playing speed in the slow tempo condition and reduced fast tempi to a more comfortable playing speed ( figure 5a , dashed line ) .
similar observations have been reported for performances on other instruments ( e.g. , piano performance , goebl and palmer 2013 ) .
the overall temporal precision of the played sequences cv = ( sdioi / meanioi ) was high ( mean cv = 0.11 ) .
the same two - way anova was calculated for the cv and revealed a significant main effect of synchronization condition [ f ( 1 , 17 ) = 19.61 , p < 0.001 ] and a significant interaction between tempo and synchronization f ( 2 , 34 ) = 6.92 , p < 0.01 .
figure 5b ( dashed line ) shows the reduction of timing precision even for moderate playing speeds when the metronome click was removed .

2.2.2 .
timing with multiple effectors the melodies ( figure 1 ) were designed to consist of three distinct parts which had to be played with the fingers only ( legato ) , the tongue only ( portato note repetition ) , and with tongue and fingers in a coordinated fashion ( descending and ascending note sequence in portato articulation ) .
for this analysis we restricted our data set to legato and portato recordings , because the onset detection for staccato melodies was less robust .
we grouped parts of the melodies according to the effectors required for playing and compared onset timing between these parts .
a two - way repeated measures anova on timing error by effector combination and tempo , indicated a significant main effect of the executing effector [ f ( 2 , 34 ) = 25.05 , p < 0.001 ] , as well a significant interaction between effector and tempo [ f ( 4 , 68 ) = 28.39 , p < 0.001 ; figure 6a ] .
a post - hoc pairwise t - test verified a significant influence of each effector condition on the timing error ( bonferoni : p < 0.001 ) .
playing with only finger actions led to faster performances than the metronome in all three tempo conditions ( mean timing error = - 0.017 ) .
tongue - only actions led to slower performances compared to the metronome ( mean timing error = 0.026 ) , especially in the medium and the fast playing conditions ( m = 0.045 ) .
using both effectors in a coordinated fashion ( tongue + fingers ) stabilized the timing error ( m = 0.013 ) , but showed a significant tempo reduction in the fast tempo condition ( m = 0.058 ) .
we observed a learning effect in the recording of the second trial for the same task [ f ( 1 , 17 ) = 6.55 , p < 0.05 ; see table 1 ] .
the timing error for combined tongue - finger actions at medium and fast tempi was significantly reduced in the second trial .
this indicates that professional players already improved their tongue - finger coordination after the first 6 repetitions and were able to perform the second trial with reduced timing error .

error bars show the standard error of the mean .

a two - way repeated measures anova on temporal precision ( cv ) by effector combination and tempo , showed a significant effect of tempo [ f ( 2 , 34 ) = 5.76 , p < 0.01 ] , and an interaction between tempo and the used effectors [ f ( 4 , 68 ) = 6.57 , p < 0.001 ; figure 6b ] .
looking at the cv values plotted in figure 6b ( dotted line ) , we see that timing precision for the finger - only condition was lower in the slow tempo condition than in the fast tempo condition .
a similar pattern appeared for the tongue - finger condition .
contrary , tones played only by tonguing ( solid line ) showed almost a constant irregularity over all three tempo conditions .
this was confirmed by three separate one - way repeated measures anovas on the cv by tempo condition .
the results showed a significant main effect of tempo for both conditions where fingers were involved [ fingers only : f ( 2 , 34 ) = 13.25 , p < 0.001 ; tongue + fingers : f ( 2 , 34 ) = 5.51 , p < 0.001 ] , but no significant effect of tempo under the condition of playing with the tongue alone .
separate post - hoc pairwise t - tests , three for each tempo condition , showed that at the slowest and fastest tempo the tongue - only condition was significantly different from the other two conditions ( bonferoni : p < 0.05 ) , except from combined tongue - finger actions in fast tempo ( p = 0.211 ) .
there was no significant difference between the finger - only condition and the combined tongue - finger condition across all tempi .
these findings suggest that at slow tempi timing improves with combined tongue - finger actions .
the observed effect can be explained by the multiple - timer model ( ivry et al. , 2002 ) , where the timer responsible for the tongue movements is coupled to the timer of the fingers .
such a coupling of multiple effectors has been shown to improve timing precision .
we found the opposite effect for the fast tempo condition : tongue timing deteriorated , when combined with finger movements .
this fast tempo condition ( ioi = 144 ms ) examined performances close to the synchronization threshold of professional musicians ( 100 - 120 ms , repp , 2005 ) .
the measured cv values were about the same level as tones played with only fingerings .
it is interesting that professional saxophonists were able to produce coordinated movements under this extreme tempo condition , but did not benefit from the coupling of the tongue to the fingers .
hence , saxophonists' tongue movements were coupled to the finger movements , even if the precision of the finger movements was worse than the precision of the tongue alone .
this indicates that in saxophone playing , the timing precision of the fingers dominates the precision of the overall performance , thus overruling the timing effects of the tongue .
2.2.3 .
timing and the direction of finger motion to play descending tone sequences on the saxophone , keys have to be pressed , while ascending sequences require fingers to open tone holes .
to see if the direction of finger movements ( pressing down vs. lifting up ) influences the timing of the performance , we contrasted ( legato ) sequences with a focus on key depression ( melody 1 ) to those focussed on lifting the keys ( melody 2 ) .
a two - way repeated measures anova on timing error showed no significant effect of the direction of finger motion nor any interactions with tempo .
the same anova on timing precision showed no significant effects .
similar observations have been reported for clarinet performances by palmer et al .
( 2009 ) .
2.2.4 .
characteristics of articulation techniques we recorded reed signals of melodies with legato , portato , and staccato articulation ( figure 3 ) .
whereas for legato articulation , no tongue actions were required , portato and staccato note transitions required precise tonguing .
each of these articulation techniques allows variation within itself based on the onset and offset timing .
bengtsson and gabrielsson ( 1983 ) discussed the resultant concepts of duration and emphasized the importance of controlling onset and offset parameters for the motion character of the rhythm .
we investigated the tongue - reed contact duration ( trdur ) for portato and staccato tone transitions by subtracting the trc times ( offset of previous tone ) from trr times ( onset of subsequent tone , figure 3 ) .
the average contact duration for portato articulation for all participants was 25.5 ms ( sd = 4.1 ms , see figure 7 ) .
a one - way repeated measures anova on trdur by tempo condition showed no significant effect of tempo [ f ( 2 , 34 ) = 1.3 , p = 0.295 ] .
on the contrary , the same anova on staccato articulation showed a highly significant influence of tempo condition on the tongue - reed contact duration [ f ( 2 , 34 ) = 25.2 , p < 0.001 ] .
in staccato articulation , the contact duration ( gap between tones ) varies with the tempo .
we calculated the relative gap duration for each note transition by trdur / ioiexp and calculated a one - way repeated measures anova on relative gap duration by tempo condition .
the results showed no effect of tempo [ f ( 2 , 34 ) = 1.7 , p = 0.198 ] .
the relative gap duration was in the range of 25 - 29 % for all three tempo conditions ( slow tempo : 0.29 ; medium tempo : 0.27 ; fast tempo : 0.25 ) .
this suggests that in portato articulation the tongue - reed contact duration remains constant , independent of the playing speed , while in staccato articulation , the relative gap duration is constant .

error bars show the standard error of the mean .
2.2.5 .
influences of the measurement setup to the performances in the questionnaire , we asked how comfortable the participants felt while playing the sensor - equipped saxophone reed .
the reed quality had to be rated between 1 ( very good ) and 7 ( very bad ) .
results showed that the reed quality was evaluated as medium quality ( m = 3 , sd = 1.5 ) .
participants also had to indicate whether they felt comfortable when playing the sensor instrument or not .
we tested timing accuracy and timing precision for this group effect by separate between - subjects anovas .
we found no significant effect between the two groups , thus , the sensor instrument did not affect the recorded performances .
we also tested for effects of self - reported handedness and skill level ( years of playing the instrument ) , but found no significant effects .
3. experiment 2 : listening test we were interested in the abilities of listeners with different expertise in music performance to discriminate between common articulation techniques in the sound of the saxophone .
furthermore , we were interested whether motor expertise in saxophone performance would facilitate the perception of saxophone articulation .
3.1 .
methods 3.1.1 .
participants nineteen female and twelve male ( n = 31 , mean age = 24 years , range = 19 - 32 years ) students from vienna music conservatories and vienna universities participated in the listening study .
the group consisted of 10 saxophone players , 10 musicians that play an instrument other than the saxophone and 11 non - musicians .
the saxophone players had a mean of 10.5 years ( range = 5 - 15 years , sd = 3.06 ) of experience in playing their instrument : eight of them also participated in the production experiment described above ( section 2 ) .
the group of musicians , who did not play a wind instrument , had a mean of 15.3 years ( range = 8 - 22 years , sd = 3.83 ) of experience in musical practice of various instruments .
the group of non - musicians were students of other fields , but 8 subjects had musical training in their early childhood , with a mean of 4.5 years .
only one of the non - musicians had experience with playing a wind instrument ( the recorder ) .
3.1.2 .
experimental design in a 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 ( 3 articulations x 3 intervals x 2 registers x 2 players x 2 listening blocks ) design , we tested which articulation techniques our participants were able to discriminate .
we recorded note transitions of three different pitch intervals ( major second , major sixth , major sixth including register change ) , with legato , portato , and staccato articulation , within two registers by two different players ( one of them also participated in the production experiment , the other is the first author of this paper ) on the same alto - saxophone ( yas 32 , by yamaha corp. ) , using their mouthpieces ( al3 , by vandoren ; original 7 * 3 , by claude lakey ) .
recordings were made in an anechoic chamber using a microphone ( c414 , by akg acoustics ) and labview hardware and software ( daq labview 2011 , by national instruments corp. ) for recording the stimuli ( 44.1 khz sampling rate , 16 bit resolution ) .
both players used synthetic sensor equipped saxophone reeds ( section 2.1.3 ) , to ensure tongue - reed contact in the portato and the staccato playing conditions .
during the recordings , both players heard a metronome click on headphones ( 108 bpm for larger intervals , 120 bpm for small intervals ) , to produce consistent timing in the stimuli .
we recorded three eighth - notes ( two note transitions , see figure 3 ) for each audio file .
the beginning and the ending of the audio file was edited with a volume fade - in and fade out , to limit the sound of articulatory actions to only the two note - transitions .
in total , 36 different audio files were comprised in the pool of stimuli .
stimuli were presented to the participants in the form of an abx listening test on a laptop computer .
a java - based software program enabled the participants to click on one of 3 buttons ( a - button , b - button , x - button ) to play back one stimulus .
buttons a and b contained two note transitions played with different articulation techniques .
button x contained a third recording that matched the articulation used in either a or b. the question our participants had to answer was : " does x sound like a or b ?" listeners had to decide whether x was more similar to a or b. responses and reaction time were recorded by the software .
3.1.3 .
procedure the experimental procedure complied with the declaration of helsinki : participants gave written consent prior to the experiment .
all participants worked on the same laptop computer ( by asustek computer inc. ) in a quiet environment and used the same studio headphones ( k121 , by akg acoustics ) .
the could adjust the playback volume to a comfortable level .
each participant had 5 practice trials to learn how to navigate the abx listening test software .
a pop - up on the screen indicated when the actual experiment began .
the experiment was grouped into two blocks , each containing all 36 stimuli in four different listening orders .
participants were allowed to play back the stimuli as often as required to make an assured judgment .
after the first block was done the participants filled in a questionnaire about their musical background .
afterwards the participants made another set of judgements .
the entire experiment lasted for about 30 min per participant .
3.2 .
results and discussion overall , participants from all three groups were able to accomplish the listening test with over 87 % of correct answers .
a chi - squared test revealed no significant difference on correct answers between the two repeated listening blocks [ chi2 ( 1 ) = 2.59 , p = 0.11 ] .
no effects of listening order [ chi2 ( 3 ) = 5.01 , p = 0.17 ] or recording saxophonist [ chi2 ( 1 ) = 0.05 , p = 0.82 ] were found either .
due to a labeling mistake in the playback list of stimuli , one stimulus pair had to be excluded from the results1 .
to convert dichotomous response data to an interval - scale level , we computed the percentage of wrong answers per participant collapsing across listening blocks and players .
a two - way anova on percentage of wrong answers , with articulation ( type of articulation to discriminate ) as within - subjects and listeners expertise as between - subjects revealed a significant effect of the articulation [ f ( 2 , 56 ) = 187.825 , p < 0.001 ] and a significant effect of the listeners expertise [ f ( 2 , 28 ) = 4.167 , p < 0.05 ] , as well as a significant interaction [ f ( 4 , 56 ) = 5.847 , p < 0.001 ; see figure 8a ] .
a two - way anova on the response duration with articulation as within - subjects and listeners expertise as between - subjects factor revealed a significant effect of articulation [ f ( 2 , 56 ) = 67.897 , p < 0.001 ] , but no significant effect of expertise or interactions ( see figure 8b ) .
figure 8 results of listening experiment : ( a ) percentage of mistakes for discrimination task ; ( b ) response time to accomplish the task ; participants were grouped by their expertise in music making .
error bars show the standard error of the mean .
focussing on articulation , post - hoc pairwise t - tests showed that results from the legato - portato listening task differed significantly from the results of the other two tasks ( p < 0.001 ) .
errors occurred most often when participants had to discriminate between legato articulation and portato articulation ( 25 % wrong answers , compared to < 1 % wrong answers for remaining articulation types ) .
additionally , figure 8b shows the highest response durations for the legato - portato condition .
concering the listeners expertise , figure 8 shows that non - musicians gave more wrong answers ( 32 %) and required more time than the other two groups to respond ( duration to answer per question m = 19.35 s , sd = 19.5 ) , followed by non - wind - instrument players ( 23 % wrong answers ; m = 15.79 s , sd = 13.8 ) and saxophonists ( 18 % wrong answers ; m = 11.13 s , sd = 8.7 ) .
the results from our listening test suggest that musical expertise alters the ability to discriminate subtle sound differences , like between legato and portato tone transitions .
the distinct sound of staccato tone transitions was well discriminated from the other two articulation techniques , by all three groups of listeners .
4. general discussion this study investigated the production and the perception of articulation on the saxophone with two experiments .
for the production experiment we built a sensor equipped saxophone reed to monitor tongue - reed interaction in alto - saxophone performance , while participants performed melodies at three tempi with different articulation techniques .
the captured sensor - reed signals showed that for portato articulation , the tongue - reed contact duration was independent from the given tempo , whereas for staccato articulation the gap between the tones was relative to the given tempo .
in legato articulation , no tongue stroke occurred , and tone transitions were initiated by a change of the fingerings .
such coordination tasks occur with all wind instruments , where different effectors ( tongue and fingers ) are required to produce one tone ( e.g. , flute , clarinet , trumpet ) .
it is also the case for string instruments that the player has to coordinate different effectors to produce one tone .
bowing movements with the right arm have to be coordinated with left hand fingerings .
baader et al .
( 2005 ) looked at bow - finger coordination in violin playing and recorded tone sequences where subjects had to play a sequence of tones , in which each tone was initiated with a bow stroke and a finger change .
the focus of their study was primarily on bow - finger synchronization , which was shown to be far from perfect simultaneity ( 50 ms ) , but did not lead to audible interruptions .
to play larger intervals on woodwind instruments the player has to close or open multiple tone holes at the same time .
this requires simultaneous finger movements , also called safe finger transitions .
almeida et al .
( 2009 ) showed that for flute performance unsafe finger transitions with approximately 21 ms already lead to audible changes in the radiated sound .
taking these studies into account , it seems that wind instrumentalists need even more precise finger movements , which additionally have to be coordinated with the movements of tongue .
in our study we looked into temporal effects of saxophone performances under different tempi , which were produced by different effectors ( fingers only , tongue only , combined tongue - finger actions ) .
we found that at the slow tempo , tone onsets produced by tongue - only actions were significantly less precise than tone onsets produced by fingerings only .
highest precision was archived for combined tongue - finger actions .
this corresponds to our hypothesis that timing precision improves for combined tongue - finger actions .
however , we did not expect to see that in the fast tempo condition , tonguing alone was more precise than finger - only actions and combined tongue - finger actions showed a high timing variability , at approximately the same level as finger - only actions .
this finding suggests that fingers play a dominant role in the overall timing of saxophone performances .
in woodwind performance finger actions usually do not receive the same attention as with piano playing , where the finger movements directly produce the sound .
our observation that there is a strong influence of finger timing on the overall timing in woodwind performance may put a new focus on further investigations of finger movements , finger trajectories , and finger forces in this domain. with the help of sensor - equipped wind instruments and the development of new customized sensors , useful advice for music education may be gained in future research .
in the listening experiment , we observed that the articulatory sound modifications ( legato , portato , staccato ) were mostly perceivable for non - musicians , musicians ( not playing saxophone ) and professional saxophonists .
only the sound of portato tongue - reed strokes was difficult to discriminate from that of non - tongued legato tone - transitions .
there are two possible reasons for this .
first , a brief damping of the reed vibrations does not immediately stop the standing wave in the resonator and thus only slightly modifies the radiated sound .
not all listeners notice that the reed has been stopped .
second , unsafe finger transitions in legato playing may also cause small gaps in the sound , which non - experts may confound with portato tonguing ( almeida et al. , 2009 ) .
nevertheless , the group of professional saxophonists was superior in discriminating legato from portato sounds .
an interesting observation was that the one participant , who did not use any tonguing during the production experiment and was therefore excluded from analysis there , also showed the worst results in the listening experiment ( in the group of professional saxophone players ) .
this strengthens our assumption that expertise in the underlying motor - actions to modify sound , facilitates perceptional discrimination of such sound modifications .
this conclusion is in line with the motor theory of speech perception ( galantucci et al. , 2006 ) : the link between perception and production of speech may also apply for the perception of articulation in saxophone music performance .
as a consequence , learning to play a musical instrument enhances the ability to perceive more details of musical performance on that instrument .

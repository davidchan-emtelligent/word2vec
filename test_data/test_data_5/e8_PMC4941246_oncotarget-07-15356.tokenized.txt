myeloid - derived suppressor cells ( mdsc ) have been described in inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) , but their role in the disease remains controversial .
we sought to define the effect of granulocytic mdsc - derived exosomes ( g - mdsc exo ) in dextran sulphate sodium ( dss ) - induced murine colitis .
g - mdsc exo - treated mice showed greater resistance to colitis , as reflected by lower disease activity index , decreased inflammatory cell infiltration damage .
there was a decrease in the proportion of th1 cells and an increase in the proportion of regulatory t cells ( tregs ) in mesenteric lymph nodes ( mlns ) from g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice .
moreover , lower serum levels of interferon ( ifn ) - gamma and tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha were detected in g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice .
interestingly , inhibition of arginase ( arg ) - 1 activity in g - mdsc exo partially abrogated the spontaneous improvement of colitis .
in addition , g - mdsc exo could suppress cd4 + t cell proliferation and ifn - gamma secretion in vitro and inhibit the delayed - type hypersensitivity ( dth ) response , and these abilities were associated with arg - 1 activity .
moreover , g - mdsc exo promoted the expansion of tregs in vitro .
taken together , these results suggest that g - mdsc exo attenuate dss - induced colitis through inhibiting th1 cells proliferation and promoting tregs expansion .
inflammatory bowel disease exosomes myeloid - derived suppressor cells inflammation immunology and microbiology section immune response immunity introduction inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) is a non - specific , inflammatory , autoimmune disorder with abdominal pain , diarrhea , and bloody stools that may lead to the development of cancer [ 1 ] .
in humans , ibd includes ulcerative colitis ( uc ) and crohn 's disease ( cd ) and is caused by the body 's immune response to the normal flora which should normally be tolerable and other factors of host [ 2 ] .
studies have shown that th1 cells and secreted inflammatory factors promoted the development of ibd [ 3 ] .
hofseth and colleagues showed that resveratrol protected against dss induced colitis mouse through up - regulating the silent mating type information regulation - 1 ( sirt - 1 ) of immune cells in the colon [ 4 ] .
however , regulatory t cells ( tregs ) play positive roles in maintaining intestinal immune balance [ 5 ] .
tregs are decreased in patients with ibd [ 6 ] , resulting in an imbalance between pro - inflammatory th1 cells and anti - inflammatory tregs .
the incidence of ibd is on the rise globally .
currently , ibd patients are treated symptomatically [ 7 ] , and there is an urgent need for effective and curative medical treatments .
mdsc are broadly considered as a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that dampen the immune response and accumulate in pathological cases of tumor , inflammation and pathogen infection [ 8 ] .
mdsc in mice are widely identified as gr - 1 ( consisting of ly6g and ly6c markers ) and cd11b double - positive cells .
the two major populations of mdsc can be differentiated by morphologic characteristics and the expression of gr - 1 molecule ; cd11b + ly6g + ly6clow cells with granulocyte - like morphology are defined as granulocytic mdsc ( g - mdsc ) , and cd11b + ly6g - ly6chigh cells with monocyte - like morphology are defined as monocytic mdsc ( m - mdsc ) [ 9 ] .
both types expand greatly in different tumor models , and the number of g - mdsc is significantly higher than that of m - mdsc .
moreover , the immunosuppressive mechanism of g - mdsc is different from that of m - mdsc [ 10 ] .
g - mdsc suppress innate and adaptive immune responses through mechanisms involving l - arginine metabolism and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production [ 11 , 12 ] .
these immunosuppressive roles of g - mdsc imply that they can be used to treat autoimmune diseases [ 13 ] .
in fact , mdsc have been employed to treat collagen - induced arthritis ( cia ) and showed a certain effect on reducing severity [ 14 ] .
ioannou and colleagues demonstrated that g - mdsc ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis through inhibition of encephalitogenic th1 and th17 immune responses [ 15 ] .
another study showed that the increased elimination of g - mdsc was due to the extracellular trap ( et ) formation driven by the inflammatory milieu of lupus and demonstrate the role of cytokines such as ifn - alpha , ifn - gamma and il - 6 in the induction of et released by g - mdsc correlated with the production of ros [ 16 ] .
however , the exact role of mdsc in ibd pathogenesis is unclear , and there are controversies regarding their immunosuppressive functions in this context [ 17 , 18 ] .
exosomes ( exo ) are 30 - 150 - nm phospholipid bilayer - enclosed vesicles that are either released from the parental cell into the extracellular space when multivesicular bodies fuse with the plasma membrane or released directly from the plasma membrane [ 19 ] .
one study demonstrated that almost all living cells can secrete exo , which are widely present in various biological fluids [ 20 ] .
it is becoming increasingly clear that exo have specialized functions and play key roles in intercellular signaling , coagulation , and waste management [ 21 ] .
exo are also reportedly involved in immune response , apoptosis , angiogenesis , inflammation , and tumor development [ 22 ] .
consequently , there is growing interest in their clinical applications for therapy , prognosis , and disease and health biomarkers. from the perspective of disease prevention , exo exhibit more advantages than parental cells [ 23 ] .
firstly , exo storage and transport are simple , and they can be used with less cytotoxicity and biohazard .
secondly , the complex molecules on the surface of exo offer potential mechanisms of homing to specific tissues and microenvironments .
lastly , the therapeutic proteins and nucleic acids carried by exo are not easily degraded .
studies have demonstrated that immature dendritic cell - derived exo are a promising subcellular vaccine for autoimmunity , and exo released from idcs secreting transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - beta1 prevented the development of autoimmune diseases [ 24 ] .
in this study , g - mdsc were sorted from the spleens of tumor - bearing mice , then g - mdsc exo were isolated from the culture supernatant of g - mdsc by serial centrifugation and purification with an isolation kit .
we found that g - mdsc exo could attenuate dss - induced colitis and restore intestinal immune balance .
subsequently , we confirmed that g - mdsc exo suppress cd4 + t cell proliferation and the delayed - type hypersensitivity ( dth ) response , and these roles were partially related to arginase ( arg ) - 1 activity .
moreover , g - mdsc exo could promote tregs expansion in vitro .
collectively , these data indicate that g - mdsc exo have a strong ability to reduce the severity of dss - induced colitis .
our findings provide a potential immunotherapy for ibd and other autoimmune diseases .
results extraction and identification of g - mdsc exo g - mdsc were isolated from the spleen of tumor - bearing mice and analyzed by fcm ; cell purity was > 95 % ( figure 1a ) .
we could acquire 1 x 107 g - mdsc from one tumor - bearing mouse .
g - mdsc were cultured in vitro , and culture supernatants were collected after 20 h. exosomes in the supernatants were purified by the method of differential centrifugation followed by use of exosomes extraction kits .
g - mdsc exo were observed by transmission electron microscopy , which revealed that most of the exosomes displayed closed round vesicles with diameters of 30 - 150 nm ( figure 1b and 1c ) .
further characterization indicated that g - mdsc exo had a similar level of exo - associated cd63 ( figure 1d ) .
in contrast , calnexin was not detected in the purified g - mdsc exo preparations ( figure 1d ) , indicating that g - mdsc exo were free from contamination with non - exo membrane proteins .
we could acquire 3 - 5 mug g - mdsc exo from 1 x 106 g - mdsc .

arg - 1 is one of the most important molecules that plays a critical role in the immunosuppressive function of g - mdsc .
to determine whether g - mdsc exo contain arg - 1 activity , the arg - 1 activity of g - mdsc exo was detected with an assay kit according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the results showed arg - 1 activity in g - mdsc exo ( figure 1e ) .
additionally , the specific arginase inhibitor nomega - hydroxy - nor - arginine ( nor - noha , also nn ) was added to the g - mdsc culture system , and this type of exo was isolated and termed ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo ; they showed significant decrease of arg - 1 activity ( figure 1e ) .
g - mdsc exo attenuate dss - induced experimental colitis in mice to test whether g - mdsc exo can ameliorate colitis , c57bl / 6 mice were injected i.p with g - mdsc exo ( 30 mug / mouse / injection ) on days 2 , 4 , and 6 after colitis induction .
multiple observations collectively indicated that g - mdsc exo - treated mice were considerably less susceptible to dss - induced colitis compared to other groups .
firstly , the dai of g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice was lower than in colitis mice or ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated colitis mice on day 4 after the initiation of dss treatment .
moreover , this difference gradually increased over time ( figure 2a ) .
secondly , dss treatment caused severe bloody stools that persisted until the sacrifice of colitis mice or ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated colitis mice .
this change was not observed in g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice ( figure 2b ) .
thirdly , we measured the length of colon from mice in different groups .
results showed that the length of colon in colitis mice or ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated colitis mice is shorter than g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice ( figure 2c ) .
finally , histologic examination of colonic sections revealed complete disruption of the colonic architecture in colitis mice , whereas g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice retained intact colonic architecture , and the severity of disease in ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated colitis mice was greater than g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice ( figure 2d ) .
consistent with histologic observations , the histologic scoring of g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice was significantly lower than colitis mice , g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice or ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated colitis mice ( figure 2e ) .
taken together , these results strongly support the hypothesis that g - mdsc exo could attenuate dss - induced murine experimental colitis and suggest that arg - 1 plays an important role in this process .
figure 2 g - mdsc exo attenuate the severity of dss - induced colitis murine experimental colitis was induced in c57bl / 6 mice ( n = 10 / group ) by providing 2.5 % dss solution in their drinking water for 10 days .
mice received i.p. injections with exosomes ( 30 mug / mouse / injection ) on days 2 , 4 , and 6 .
( a ) disease activity was determined daily as described in the methods .
mice were sacrificed on day 8 by eye bloodletting followed by cervical dislocation .
colon sections obtained from mice were analyzed for their outward appearance ( b ) , length ( c ) , degree of inflammation ( d ) and h & e histologic scoring .
( e ) all data are presented as the mean +/ - sem from one of three independent experiments .

the mice of the control group had no dss treatment .
the mice of the colitis group had dss treatment , while no exo treatment .
all other experimental groups had dss and different exos treatment .
g - mdsc exo prevent th1 cell development and promote tregs expansion in murine experimental colitis th1 cells and ifn - gamma are crucial for the pathogenesis of ibd , and tnf - alpha also participates in ibd pathogenesis [ 25 ] .
however , tregs could maintain the intestinal immune balance and play a protective role in ibd [ 5 ] .
to understand the mechanisms underlying the action of g - mdsc exo against colitis , the percentages of tregs and th1 cells in mlns were analyzed by fcm , and the serum levels of ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha were determined by elisa .
as shown in figure 3a , following treatment with g - mdsc exo , the percentage of th1 cells was significantly lower than that in colitis , neu exo - , or ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated colitis mice .
however , the percentage of tregs in g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice was significantly higher than that in colitis or neu exo - treated colitis mice ( figure 3b ) .
moreover , markedly lower levels of ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha were detected in the serum of g - mdsc exo - treated colitis mice compared with that in other groups of colitis mice ( figure 3c ) .
hence , our data indicate that treatment with g - mdsc exo inhibits th1 cell responses but enhances tregs , which contributes to the inhibition of colitis .
figure 3 g - mdsc exo prevent the th1 cell response and expand tregs in murine experimental colitis mice were sacrificed , and lymphocytes from the mlns of different groups of dss - induced colitis mice were isolated on day 8 .
( a ) for th1 cell detection , lymphocytes were stimulated for 5 h with 1 mug / ml ionomycin and 50 ng / ml phorbol myristate acetate in the presence of 2 mg / ml monensin at 37degreesc and stained with anti - mouse cd4 and ifn - gamma mabs according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
the percentage of th1 cells was analyzed by fcm ( left ) , and the statistical analysis results are shown ( right ) .

g - mdsc exo suppress cd4 + t cell proliferation and ifn - gamma secretion in vitro based on the immunosuppressive effect of g - mdsc exo on th1 cells in dss - induced murine colitis , we examined the role of g - mdsc exo in cd4 + t cell proliferation and ifn - gamma secretion from cd4 + t cells in vitro .
moreover , we observed the role of arg - 1 activity in the immunosuppression of g - mdsc exo .
in the presence of anti - cd3 and anti - cd28 mabs , cd4 + t cells isolated from the spleen of male wild - type c57bl / 6 mice were cultivated in the presence of varying concentrations of g - mdsc exo or equimolar concentrations of neu exo for 3 days .
the cpm values in g - mdsc exo - treated groups were lower than in the untreated or neu exo - treated groups , and the degree of cpm value reduction in g - mdsc exo - treated groups correlated with the amount of g - mdsc exo ( figure 4a ) .
however , the cpm values in medium and high concentrations ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated groups were significantly lower than those of g - mdsc exo - treated groups ( figure 4b ) .
notably , the changes of ifn - gamma levels in culture supernatants were consistent with the changes of cd4 + t cell proliferation in different groups ( figure 4c and 4d ) .
these results confirmed that g - mdsc exo suppressed cd4 + t cell proliferation and ifn - gamma secretion in a dose - dependent manner , and this inhibitory effect correlated with arg - 1 activity .
figure 4 g - mdsc exo suppress cd4 + t cell proliferation and ifn - gamma secretion correlating with arg - 1 activity in vitro ( a and b ) .
g - mdsc exo suppress cd4 + t cell proliferation through arg - 1 activity .
cd4 + t cells were treated with g - mdsc exo ( a ) or / and ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo ( b ) at different concentrations for 72 h. the cultivation system was stimulated with anti - cd3 mab ( 2 mug / ml ) and anti - cd28 mab ( 2 mug / ml ) .

the levels of ifn - gamma in culture supernatants from the cd4 + t cell proliferation system were detected using sandwich elisas .

* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , analyzed by anova and q test .
g - mdsc exo suppress dth response the dth reaction mainly correlated with th1 cells .
to further confirm the role of g - mdsc exo in suppressing the response of cd4 + t cells in vivo , we investigated the role of g - mdsc exo in dth .
the dth model involved an ova challenge in mouse footpads , and footpad swelling was measured at a given time after the challenge .
the dth response was significantly suppressed in mice treated with g - mdsc exo before the ova challenge ( figure 5 ) .
moreover , this effect was weakened in ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo - treated mice ( figure 5 ) .
figure 5 g - mdsc exo suppress the dth reaction in an arg - 1 - dependent manner ova - sensitized mice were challenged with ova in the footpads , and paw edema was measured at 24 , 48 , and 72 h after the challenge .
footpad swelling was calculated according to the formula described in the methods .
data are shown as the mean +/ - sem of each group ( n = 6 ) pooled from three independent experiments .

g - mdsc exo promote tgf - beta - induced tregs generation from cd4 + t cells in vitro given the effect of g - mdsc exo on tregs expansion in murine ibd and previous reports indicated that mdsc promoted tregs expansion [ 26 , 27 ] .
we assumed that g - mdsc exo might promote the generation of tregs from cd4 + t cells .
to test this hypothesis , we evaluated the influence of g - mdsc exo on the expansion of tregs from cd4 + t cells .
cd4 + t cells isolated from c57bl / 6 mice splenocytes were cultured for 72 h in the presence or absence of exo isolated from g - mdsc or neutrophils .
tregs percentages were determined by fcm .
as shown in figure 6a and 6b , a significant dose - dependent increase in tregs percentage was observed in the presence of g - mdsc exo .
figure 6 g - mdsc exo promote tgf - beta induced tregs generation from cd4 + t cells 1.5 x 106 / ml cd4 + t cells were isolated from the spleen of c57bl / 6 mice and cultured for 72 h with anti - cd3 ( 2 mug / ml ) , anti - cd28 ( 2 mug / ml ) ab , and tgf - beta ( 5 ng / ml ) in the presence or absence of exo isolated from g - mdsc or neutrophils .

discussion exosomes are highly abundant in biologic fluids where they transfer information between cells .
a report showed that mdsc isolated from balb / c mice carrying 4t1 mammary carcinomas shed exosomes that contain multiple bioactive components derived from many subcellular compartments and are associated with diverse functions [ 22 ] .
in this study , we found g - mdsc exo were bilayered vesicles as having diameters in the 30 - 150 - nm range by transmission electron micrographs , which is consistent with previously described exosomes [ 28 ] .
it is noteworthy that g - mdsc exo possess arg - 1 activity , which plays a critical role in the immunosuppressive function of g - mdsc .
overall , these results indicate that g - mdsc exo share some biological functions with their parental cells .
although studies have attempted to utilize mdsc to suppress the autoimmune response and limit tissue injury in the context of eae [ 15 , 29 ] and cia [ 14 , 30 ] , and get beneficial results .
however , the roles of mdsc in ibd pathogenesis remain unclear , and the reports of immunosuppressive functions of mdsc in ibd are fairly controversial [ 17 , 18 ] .
haile et al. showed that mdsc frequency dramatically increased during intestinal inflammation in a cd8 + t - cell - mediated mouse model of ibd and suppressed ifn - gamma secretion from t cells , and transferred mdsc decreased intestinal inflammation [ 31 ] .
recruited myeloid cells may acquire antigen - presenting functions after undergoing a series of phenotypic and functional changes and stimulate cytokine production by effector th1 / th17 cells in chronic colitis [ 32 ] .
moreover , inflammatory monocytes recruited in the lamina propria of colon may differentiate into proinflammatory dendritic cells [ 33 ] .
however , these cells express inducible nitric oxide synthase and arg - 1 , suggesting a more activated state resulting in an inability to suppress activated / effector th1 / th17 cells [ 34 ] .
considering the exact role of mdsc in ibd pathogenesis is unclear , and the clear immunosuppression and rich content of g - mdsc in tumor - bearing mice , we used g - mdsc exo to inhibit the development of dss - induced colitis .
the application of g - mdsc exo attenuated dss - induced colitis , which was accompanied by a decrease in the number of th1 cells and an increase in the number of tregs from mlns .
moreover , g - mdsc exo reduced the serum levels of ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha in dss - induced colitis mice .
inhibition of arg - 1 activity with nor - noha partly attenuated the improvement of dss - induced colitis by g - mdsc exo .
g - mdsc play the role of immune suppression by the production of ros , arg - 1 and generation of no [ 10 ] .
peroxynitrite which formed by the cooperative activity of ros with no is another factor that inhibits effector t cells [ 35 ] .
peroxynitrite leads to the nitration of tyrosines in the t - cell receptor ( tcr ) .
this reaction damages the conformational flexibility of tcr complex , and inhibits its binding with peptide - loaded mhc and leads to the unresponsiveness of t cells to antigen - specific stimulation [ 8 , 15 , 36 , 37 ] .
the suppressive activity of arg - 1 is based on its role in the hepatic urea cycle , metabolizing l - arginine to l - ornithine .
expression of arg - 1 has been reported to decrease cd3xi - chain biosynthesis and down - regulate tcr on cell surface and leads to the unresponsiveness of t cells without mhc ii restriction and in an antigen - non - specific manner [ 38 ] .
in our study , g - mdsc exo mediate their suppressive activity on autoimmune ibd mice through preventing th1 cell reaction which depended on arg - 1 activity .
these regulation on t effector immune responses without mhc ii restriction and in an antigen - non - specific manner .
collectively , these results showed that g - mdsc exo can inhibit dss - induced colitis , and this was associated with arg - 1 activity - mediated suppression of th1 cells and tregs expansion .
to demonstrate the immunosuppressive effect of g - mdsc exo , we observed the roles of g - mdsc exo on cd4 + t cell proliferation and tregs expansion in vitro .
we found that g - mdsc exo could inhibit cd4 + t cell proliferation and ifn - gamma secretion , and these effects correlated with arg - 1 activity .
moreover , these effects were further confirmed by our observation that g - mdsc exo alleviated the dth reaction in vivo .
in addition , we found g - mdsc exo promoted tregs expansion from cd4 + t cells in the presence of tgf - beta , although the exact reasons need further study .
one certainty is that mdsc promote tregs expansion [ 26 , 27 , 39 ] .
this is consistent with the theory that exosomes have some properties in common with their parent cells .
these experimental results suggested g - mdsc exo have strong immunosuppressive activity in vitro and are consistent with the roles of g - mdsc exo in dss - induced colitis .
in conclusion , we successfully isolated and identified g - mdsc exo , providing an experimental basis for further studies .
our findings suggest that g - mdsc exo attenuate dss - induced murine colitis by suppressing pathogenic th1 cells and inducing tregs differentiation and the protective effect correlated with arginase activity in mdsc exo .
moreover , these immunosuppressive effects of g - mdsc exo were confirmed in vitro .
in conclusion , our work provides a new way in the development of an effective intervention of ibd and other autoimmune diseases .

the experimental protocols were approved by the jiangsu university animal ethics and experimentation committee .
g - mdsc isolation tumor - bearing mice were established with the lewis lung adenocarcinoma cell line according to a method previously used in our laboratory [ 9 , 40 ] .
when tumors were greater than 2 cm in diameter , g - mdsc were harvested from the spleen with g - mdsc isolation kits according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and their purity was assessed by measuring the expression of ly - 6g and cd11b with flow cytometry ( fcm ) .
g - mdsc exo purification to make preparations for large - scale exosomes purification , isolated g - mdsc were cultivated in an incubator at 37degreesc and 5 % co2 for 20 h in g - mdsc - conditioned medium ( r1640 with 10 % fetal bovine serum that had been ultracentrifuged at 100,000 g for 16 h at 4degreesc ) .
the culture supernatant of g - mdsc was harvested after 20 h. exosomes were purified from the supernatant by differential centrifugation and ultrafiltration membrane technology followed by the use of an exosomes extraction kit .
in brief , cells and cellular debris were removed by sequential centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min , 1000 g for 30 min , and 10000 g for 30 min .
the concentrated supernatant was acquired by an ultrafiltration membrane with a molecular weight cut - off ranging from 2 to 100 kda .
the supernatant was passed through a 0.22 - mum microcentrifuge filter .
the filtrate was mixed with exosomes isolation reagent ( v / v = 5:1 ) and incubated for 16 h at 4degreesc .
finally , the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 g for 30 min , and the precipitate was g - mdsc exo .
exosomes were dissolved in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) and stored at - 80degreesc .
the protein contents of g - mdsc exo were quantified using a microbca protein assay kit .
in this study , we also prepared neutrophil - derived exo ( neu exo ) , which served as control for g - mdsc exo .
in the purification process of ( g - mdsc + nn ) exo in which the arg - 1 activity is inhibited , g - mdsc used to extract exosomes were cultured in the presence of 200 mum nor - noha , which is a potent inhibitor of arginase .
because nor - noha is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) , we prepared ( g - mdsc + dmso ) exo as solvent to control for the influence of dmso on the experiment .
g - mdsc exo transmission microscopic examination purified g - mdsc exo suspended in 2 % glutaraldehyde in pbs were loaded on a formvar - coated grid and negatively stained with 3 % ( w / v ) aqueous phosphotungstic acid for 1 min .
electron micrographs were observed by transmission electron microscopy ( tecnai - 12 ; philips , amsterdam , netherlands ) .
western blot analysis g - mdsc and g - mdsc exo were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation ( ripa ) buffer , and lysates were separated by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) and subsequently electrotransferred onto immobilon polyvinylidene membranes ( bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) , and probed with mouse mabs against cd63 or calnexin , and hrp conjugated anti - mouse igg followed by chemiluminescent detection ( champion chemical , whittier , ca , usa ) .
detection of arginase activity arg - 1 activity contents in the lysates from exosomes or g - mdsc were measured by arg - 1 activity assay according to the manufacturer 's protocols .
briefly , 2 x 106 g - mdsc or exosomes isolated from 2 x 106 g - mdsc or neutrophil were lysed in 50 mul ripa buffer , collected the lysate by centrifugation at 14000 g for 10 min at 4degreesc , and added ddh2o to 100 mul .
arginase activity was detected with the quantichrom argianse assay kit ( bioassay systems , hayward , ca ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
dss - induced experimental colitis in mice dss - induced murine experimental colitis was established as described previously with minor modification [ 41 ] .
briefly , male c57bl / 6 mice were treated with 2.5 % dss in drinking water for 10 days to induce colon injury and colitis , and these mice were treated with pbs or exosomes ( 30 mug / mouse / i.p ) on days 2 , 4 , and 6 after dss drinking .
normal control mice were given normal drinking water and were treated with pbs .
weight loss , rectal bleeding and diarrhea were monitored daily for 10 days and graded separately on scales of 0 - 4 .
the average of the three values constitutes the disease activity index ( dai ) .
mice were sacrificed on day 8 by eye bloodletting followed by cervical dislocation .
colons were mechanically isolated , cleaned , and measured in length .
after removing caecum and adipose tissue , the colons were fixed in 10 % formalin solution , paraffin - embedded , sections , stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) , and examined under a light microscope .
histological scoring was done as described previously [ 42 ] .
fcm analysis on day 8 , mice were sacrificed by eye bloodletting followed by cervical dislocation .
mlns were isolated and grinded in 2 ml pbs .
the cell suspensions were filtered through 70 mum cell strainers .
the lymphocytes were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min at 4degreesc .
for tregs detection , lymphocytes were stained with anti - mouse cd4 and cd25 and foxp3 mabs , and defined the proportion of cd25 + foxp3 + lymphocytes gated in cd4 + lymphocytes as described previously [ 43 ] .
for the detection of th1 cells , single - cell suspensions were stimulated with 50 ng / ml phorbol myristate acetate , 1 mug / ml ionomycin , and 2 mug / ml monensin .
after 5 h , cells were stained with anti - cd3 and anti - cd4 mabs , fixed , permeabilized , and stained with anti - ifn - gamma mab according to the intracellular staining kit ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) instructions .
defined the proportion of cd4 + ifn - gamma + lymphocytes gated in cd3 + lymphocytes .
elisa on day 8 , mice were sacrificed by eye bloodletting followed by cervical dislocation .
the eyeball blood was collected into 1.5 ml ep tubes without anticoagulant and the serum was isolated by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm .
ifn - gamma and tnf - alpha contents in the serum from different groups of mice were detected with the mouse ifn - gamma or tnf - alpha sunnyelisa assay kit ( multi sciences , hangzhou , china ) following the manufacturer 's instructions .
t - cell proliferation assay for in vitro experiments , cd4 + t cells were isolated from the splenocytes of wild - type c57bl / 6 mice with a cd4 + t cell isolation kit as previously described [ 44 ] .
briefly , 1 x 106 / ml cells were stimulated with anti - cd3 ( 5 mug / ml ) and anti - cd28 ( 1 mug / ml ) mabs in triplicate in round - bottom 96 wells .
different doses of each type of exosomes were added into the wells .
cells were cultured in a humidified 5 % co2 atmosphere at 37degreesc for 72 h , and [ 3h ] - thymidine ( 1 muci / well ; pharmacia , uppsala , sweden ) was added for the last 16 h. the counts per minute ( cpm ) values of various wells were detected with an ls6500 multi - purpose scintillation counter ( beckman coulter , brea , ca , usa ) .
induction of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs cd4 + t cells isolated from c57bl / 6 mice splenocytes were cultured with anti - cd3 and anti - cd28 mabs in the presence or absence of 5 ng / ml tgf - beta in a 24 - well plate for 72 h in complete rpmi medium ( 1.5 x 106 cells / well ) with or without exo isolated from g - mdsc or neutrophils .
the percentages of cd25 + foxp3 + cells in cd4 + t cells were determined by fcm after 72 h. induction of dth dth was induced in mice by challenging the footpad of previously sensitized mice with ova as described previously [ 45 ] .
in brief , c57bl / 6 mice were sensitized by intradermal injections of 1 mg / ml cfa - emulsified ova peptide ( grade v ) in a final volume of 200 mul at the tail base and back .
seven days after sensitization , each mouse was challenged by footpad injection of 20 mg / ml pbs - dissolved ova peptide ( grade ii ) in a final volume of 30 mul .
another rear paw was injected with a comparable volume of pbs as a control .
footpad thickness was measured using a vernier caliper ( mitutoyo corp , tokyo , japan ) at a given time after the challenge .
the magnitude of the dth response was determined as follows : dth units =( footpad thickness of ova injection [ mm ]) - ( footpad thickness of pbs injection [ mm ]) .
for dth treatment , mice were intraperitoneally ( i.p. ) injected with different exosomes ( 30 mug / mouse / injection ) on days 2 , 4 , and 6 after sensitization .
statistical analysis the statistical significance of differences between groups was analyzed by anova and q test using the spss version 16.0 for windows ( spss inc , chicago , il , usa ) .
the data are presented as the mean +/ - sem from at least three independent experiments .
a p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically as significant .

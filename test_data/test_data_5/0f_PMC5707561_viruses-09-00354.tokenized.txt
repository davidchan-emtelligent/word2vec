next - generation sequencing and metagenomics have revolutionized the discovery of novel viruses .
in recent years , three novel protoparvoviruses have been discovered in fecal samples of humans : bufavirus ( buv ) in 2012 , tusavirus ( tuv ) in 2014 , and cutavirus ( cuv ) in 2016 .
buv has since been studied the most , disclosing three genotypes that also represent serotypes .
besides one nasal sample , buv dna has been found exclusively in diarrheal feces , but not in non - diarrheal feces , suggesting a causal relationship .
according to both geno - and seroprevalences , buv appears to be the most common of the three novel protoparvoviruses , whereas tuv dna has been found in only a single fecal sample , with antibody detection being equally rare .
moreover , the tuv sequence is closer to those of non - human protoparvoviruses , and so the evidence of tuv being a human virus is thus far insufficient .
interestingly , besides in feces , cuv has also been detected in skin biopsies of patients with cutaneous t - cell lymphoma and a patient with melanoma , while all other skin samples have tested pcr negative .
even if preliminary disease associations exist , the full etiological roles of these viruses in human disease are yet to be resolved .
human protoparvovirus bufavirus tusavirus cutavirus discovery epidemiology gastroenteritis cutaneous t - cell lymphoma emerging viruses 1 .
introduction parvoviruses are small ssdna viruses that infect a diverse group of animals ; both vertebrates ( subfamily parvovirinae ) and invertebrates ( subfamily densovirinae ) .
their non - enveloped capsid structure makes these viruses stable and very resistant to inactivation .
human parvoviruses are generally not easy to grow in standard cell culture systems , limiting the discovery of novel human parvoviruses in the past .
however , in recent years great progress has been made in genetic sciences , where virion enrichment , host dna depletion , sequence - independent amplification , next generation sequencing ( ngs ) , and metagenomic analysis with diverse bioinformatic pipelines have revolutionized the discovery of novel viruses , including human parvoviruses .
for 30 years , human parvovirus b19 of the erythroparvovirus genus was the only known indisputably human - pathogenic parvovirus , causing erythema infectiosum , arthropathies , anemias , and fetal death , while the highly prevalent adeno - associated viruses ( aav ) of the dependoparvovirus genus are apathogenic [ 1,2 ] .
in 2005 , two novel parvoviruses were discovered in humans : parvovirus 4 ( parv4 ) of the tetraparvovirus genus in blood , and human bocavirus 1 ( hbov1 ) of the bocaparvovirus genus in pediatric respiratory samples [ 3,4 ] .
parv4 is mainly detected in injecting drug users and hemophiliacs in the western world , but has not been associated with any specific symptoms , whereas hbov1 causes mild to life - threatening respiratory tract infections in children [ 2 ] .
three more bocaviruses ( hbov2 - 4 ) have been discovered in stool , without clear clinical associations [ 5,6,7 ] .
during the past six years , three novel parvoviruses have been described in humans , all belonging to the protoparvovirus genus : bufavirus ( buv ) , tusavirus ( tuv ) , and cutavirus ( cuv ) [ 8,9,10 ] .
although buv has been associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and cuv is under study for its possible role in skin cancers , the etiological roles of these viruses in human disease are yet to be resolved .
here we review what is known about these new protoparvoviruses .
2. bufavirus 2.1 .
discovery and taxonomy bufavirus was identified in 2012 in viral metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from diarrheic children in burkina faso [ 8 ] .
the obtained sequence reads from one sample showed significant similarities to parvovirus sequences , and after filling the gaps between the ngs reads by pcr , a nearly full - length sequence of 4921 bp ( genbank # jq918261 ) was constructed showing < 39 % and < 31 % identity of the ns1 ( non - structural protein 1 ) and vp1 protein ( viral capsid protein 1 ) , respectively , to previously known protoparvoviruses .
a unique middle open reading frame ( orf ) of 130 amino acids was also identified that did not show similarity with any other parvovirus sequences ( figure 1a ) .
further pcr analysis of 98 rotavirus antigen - negative diarrheal fecal samples from burkina faso showed the presence of buv dna in 4 / 98 ( 4.1 %) samples [ 8 ] .
the complete protein - coding regions were determined for all buv dna isolates .
within the vp2 ( viral capsid protein 2 ) region , one of the four isolates shared less than 73 % amino - acid identity with the other isolates , whereas the non - structural ns1 regions were nearly identical .
subsequently , a second buv genotype , bufavirus 2 ( buv2 ) , was identified ( genbank # jx027297 ) .
the authors further studied 100 fecal samples from chilean children with diarrhea and 63 samples from tunisian children with non - polio acute flaccid paralysis , but only one buv sequence was found among the latter [ 8 ] .
two years later , a third buv genotype , buv3 ( genbank # ab847987 - 9 ) , was discovered in the diarrheal feces of 3 / 393 bhutanese children [ 11 ] .
all three current buv genotypes contain an atp - or gtp - binding walker loop , phospholipase a2 ( pla2 ) , two conserved replication initiator motifs , a glycine - rich sequence , and the same splice sites .
among the two major orfs , the three genotypes are more divergent within the capsid proteins , sharing only 71 - 78 % amino - acid identity within vp1 and 65 - 73 % within vp2 [ 12 ] .
in contrast , the ns1 regions of the three buvs are nearly identical ( 94 - 96 % amino acid identity ) .
according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ( ictv ) , parvoviruses in a single species encode ns1 proteins of > 85 % amino acid sequence identity [ 13 ] .
therefore , all three buv genotypes can be phylogenetically classified into one species : primate protoparvovirus 1 , within the protoparvovirus genus ( figure 1b ) .
2.2 .
pcr - based epidemiology buv dna has been mainly searched for in feces , the sample type that the virus was originally identified in. buv dna has been detected in the diarrheal samples of children in burkina faso , tunisia , bhutan , thailand , turkey , china , and finland , and of adults in finland , the netherlands , thailand , and china ( table 1 ) [ 8,11,16,17,18,19,20,21,22 ] .
in all studies , the buv dna prevalence in feces has been low , ranging from 0.3 % to 4.1 % ( table 1 ) , and when reported , the viral titre was always low [ 16,22 ] .
recently , a partial sequence matching buv3 was found by ngs in diarrheal feces from peru in south america , expanding the geographic locations where buv dna has been detected ( table 1 ) [ 23 ] .
prevalence variation may occur even within one country ; in china , the buv dna prevalence was 1.7 % ( 9 / 520 ) among samples from the general hospital of beijing , whereas all samples ( n = 1357 ) from the children 's hospital of chongqing were buv dna - negative [ 20 ] .
so far , all buv - dna findings have been of genotypes 1 or 3 , except the one original buv2 - dna sequence from the single child in burkina faso [ 8,11,16,17,18,19,20,21,23 ] , showing that buv1 and 3 are geographically widespread .
in six studies , temporal clustering of buv dna detection to cold weather was observed as all or nearly all buv dna - positive samples were collected during september - april [ 11,18,19,20,21,22 ] .
in four studies , negative controls were included ; all fecal samples from non - diarrheic patients or healthy individuals ( total n = 1855 ) were buv dna - negative ( table 1 ) [ 18,19,20,22 ] .
however , in only two studies the non - diarrheal fecal samples were collected during the same time period as the buv dna - positive diarrheal samples [ 19,22 ] .
this is of importance as in most studies buv dna was not detected throughout the year , and very often not at all during certain years .
besides in feces , buv dna has been studied in nasal swabs of children and in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) samples of adults and children [ 22,24 ] .
nasal swabs ( n = 955 ) were collected in finland from children with acute gastroenteritis ( age , n = 172 ) , acute respiratory tract infection ( arti , n = 545 ) , or both ( n = 238 ) , and buv dna was detected at low copy number in the nasal swab of one child with both age and arti ( table 1 ) [ 22 ] .
however , the corresponding fecal sample of this child was buv dna - negative .
in a study of central nervous system infections in turkey , the csf samples were collected from patients with a febrile disease and / or central nervous system infection with presumed viral etiology [ 24 ] .
however , no buv dna sequences were detected by nested pcr in the csf from these 93 turkish children and 33 adults ( table 1 ) .
2.3 .
antibody - based epidemiology a buv enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) has been developed to elucidate the prevalence of buv1 - 3 igg antibodies in various populations [ 22 ] .
humans have been shown to induce buv igg towards each of the three genotypes ( table 2 ) .
the buv igg prevalence was low in both finnish - born adults ( 3.1 %) and children ( 3.1 %) .
interestingly , among asian - born university or hospital staff members working in finland , buv igg was present in 5 / 12 of the tested subjects , suggesting that buv is more prevalent in asia [ 22 ] .
the study moreover highlighted that the three buv genotypes also represent serotypes , as no antibody cross - reactivity in eia was observed .
further studies with larger cohorts from different parts of the world are ongoing to reveal the global buv igg prevalences in healthy populations and in different patient cohorts .
in addition , no patients with serologically confirmed acute buv infections have yet been reported .
such cases would be essential in order to broaden the knowledge of possible symptoms and diseases that buv might cause .
2.4 .
bufavirus - like animal viruses since the discovery of human buv , several animal species have been shown to have their own buv - like viruses .
the viruses phylogenetically closest to human buvs have been detected in captive rhesus monkeys in the usa with a nucleotide identity of 77 % in the vp1 gene , and in wild baboons in zambia ( figure 1 ) [ 25,26 ] .
in both primate species , buv - like viruses were detected either in the blood or in the spleen of the animal , indicating that these buv - like viruses can cause systemic infections .
besides in primates , buv - like viruses have so far also been identified in shrews , bats , rats , swine , and fur seals [ 12,26,27,28,29,30 ] .
3. tusavirus tusavirus , the name corresponding to tunisian stool - associated parvovirus , was identified in 2014 using ngs and metagenomics in the fecal sample of an 18 - month - old child with unexplained diarrhea in tunisia [ 10 ] .
only one pool showed a single read of a parvovirus - like sequence , which was most similar to the ns1 sequence of a rat protoparvovirus .
a near - complete genome sequence of 4424 bp was obtained ( genbank # kj495710 ) , including the two major orfs , ns1 and vp1 , typical of parvoviruses .
two conserved replication initiator sites and the walker loop were also identified within ns1 , as well as the pla2 motif and an unusual serine - rich sequence near the vp1 n - terminus .
tuv was shown to be quite distant from other protoparvoviruses : ns1 and vp1 showing the closest identities of 44 % and 39 % , respectively , to the kilham rat parvovirus ( figure 1 ) .
tuv was thus proposed to be the prototype member for a new species , primate protoparvovirus 2 , in the protoparvovirus genus [ 10 ] .
however , the final classification is still pending due to the scarcity of this virus .
no other tuv sequences were found in these tunisian fecal samples by a nested pcr targeting the ns1 gene , and thus the tuv dna was present in only 1 / 180 ( 0.56 %) diarrheal fecal samples .
however , no other human - pathogenic viruses were detected in this sample .
no other studies of tuv dna prevalence in any sample type have been reported , and only one other metagenomics study has disclosed sequences showing resemblance to tuv : a study of fur seals in brazil described partial sequences ranging from 344 to 1519 nt in length , of both ns1 and vp regions with 39 - 82 % similarity to tuv at the amino acid level [ 30 ] .
besides dna , one serological study of tuv igg in humans has been published , in which one child in finland was shown by eia to be barely positive for tuv igg ( 1 / 228 , 0.44 %) [ 22 ] .
4. cutavirus in 2016 , yet another protoparvovirus , cutavirus , was detected by viral metagenomics in 2 / 245 diarrheal fecal samples from brazilian children [ 9 ] .
the near full - length 4456 bp sequence ( genbank # kt868811 ) of the cuv genome showed the typical major orfs for ns1 and vp1 with 76 % and 82 % amino acid identity , respectively , to those of buv2 , the phylogenetically closest parvovirus , suggesting that cuv may be a distinct protoparvovirus species ( figure 1 ) .
the cuv ns1 gene was , however , shorter than that of buv ; the alignment revealing an 11 amino - acid deletion near the c - terminus .
the cuv genome was shown to contain the typical ns1 helicase motif with ntp - binding domains , as well as the vp1 pla2 motif and glycine - rich regions .
in addition , the sequence included a buv - like middle orf of unknown function , 20 amino acids shorter than that of buv , with a 45 % identity ( figure 1 ). by cuv vp - specific nested pcr , three more cuv sequences were detected , 2 more in brazilian fecal samples and one in one hundred fecal samples from botswana .
in all , the cuv dna fecal prevalence was 4 / 245 , 1.6 % , in brazilian and 1 / 100 , 1.0 % , in botswanan diarrheic children [ 9 ] .
these cuv genomes were only partly sequenced .
to search for other pathogens in the five cuv dna - positive samples , ngs was performed on the individual samples .
in one of the brazilian samples , no other human viruses were detected [ 9 ] .
in the other three brazilian samples , one contained rotavirus a and aav , one astrovirus and adenovirus , and one rotavirus a and anellovirus .
the botswanan sample harbored both picobirna - and anellovirus .
interestingly , by further in silico screening of existing ngs libraries , cuv dna was retrospectively detected in two skin biopsies of french cutaneous t - cell lymphoma ( ctcl ) patients , thereby resulting in the virus name [ 9 ]. by cuv - nested pcr , 15 additional ctcl skin samples were screened , of which two more ( 2 / 15 , 13.3 %) were found to be cuv dna - positive .
skin samples of other cancers ( n = 10 ) and non - malignant skin biopsies ( n = 19 ) were all cuv pcr - negative ( table 3 ) .
later on , cuv dna was detected with ngs in the malignant skin lesions of one melanoma patient in denmark [ 31 ] , while 9 additional melanoma samples were cuv dna - negative when using both ngs and pcr .
the cuv nt sequence from denmark was 96.5 - 93.7 % identical to the previously published three sequences covering the entire ns1 and vp coding regions ( table 4 , data calculated for this review , and figure 1 ) .
when comparing all known cuv nt sequences ( of 3980 nt in length ) , the br - 283 sequence from brazilian feces was closer to the danish and french sequences from skin than to the other brazilian sequences ( table 4 ) .
these data indicate that the sequences of cuv strains found in skin and feces are similar .
5. discussion three protoparvoviruses , buv , tuv and cuv , are the newest parvoviruses identified among humans [ 8,9,10 ] .
all three were originally discovered in diarrheal feces of children by using virion enrichment and nuclease treatment prior to ngs , suggesting that the discovered viral dna in the samples might have been protected by a capsid structure .
no cell culture experiments have been done .
the subsequent studies have instead focused on finding the dnas of these viruses , or antibodies towards them , in human samples .
as parvoviruses generally infect host - specifically and human parvoviruses grow poorly in cell cultures , dna and antibody detection are the most feasible ways to establish these viruses as human viruses .
studies and findings on tuv dna or antibodies are , however , scarce ; only one dna isolate exists and only one child has been barely tuv igg - positive [ 10,22 ]. whether tuv truly is a human parvovirus and not of , e.g. , dietary origin , requires further investigation. of these three protoparvoviruses , buv was discovered first and has been studied the most .
the fact that buv dna is found near - exclusively in the feces of patients with diarrhea , often without other pathogen coinfections , whereas non - diarrheal fecal samples all have been buv dna - negative , suggests that buv might be causative for gastroenteritis .
however , the low viral loads and infrequent detection of buv dna point to a less prominent role in the overall burden of gastroenteritis. whether buv is involved in other clinical manifestations is not yet known , as acute primary buv infections have not yet been serologically identified .
the presence of igg in humans , however , indicates that buv is a true , capsid - covered infectious virus .
the remarkable difference in buv seroprevalence between finland and asia is interesting and under ongoing investigation .
the reasons for such diversity might be cultural , genetic , or demo - geographic .
the newest member of the human protoparvoviruses is cuv , the dna of which has been detected both in the diarrheal feces of children and in 4 / 17 skin samples of patients with ctcl ( mycosis fungoides ) , whereas all 31 non - ctcl skin biopsies were pcr negative [ 9 ] .
in addition , one danish melanoma skin biopsy was found to be cuv dna - positive. that the virus has been detected both in feces and skin suggests that cuv is a human virus and may cause systemic infection .
further pcr and sero - epidemiological studies are ongoing to assess the cancer association and the global distribution of this novel human virus .
in conclusion , according to dna and antibody data , buv and cuv are indeed human viruses , whereas for tuv the evidence is inconclusive .
further dna studies of diverse sample materials combined with serological analyses are needed to establish the pathogenicity , or the absence of it , regarding , in particular , gastrointestinal and neoplastic illnesses .

( a ) schematic illustration of buv , tuv , cuv , and mvmp genomic structures .
the hairpin regions are unknown for buv , tuv , and cuv , and the hairpins of mvmp are represented as straight lines for this simplified scheme .
species , strain , genbank no. , and the length of genome are indicated ; phylogenetic analyses of ( b ) ns1 sequences ; ( c ) vp2 sequences ; ( d ) short middle orf sequences ( not available from tuv ) .
the phylogenetic analysis was based on nucleic acid sequences .
sequences were aligned with clustalx ( version 2.1 ) [ 14 ] using a protospacer adjacent motif ( pam ) with a gap open penalty of 10 and gap extension penalty of 0.1 .
the neighbor - joining phylogenetic tree was generated with bootstrap values determined by 1000 replicates in the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis ( mega )( version 7.0 ) [ 15 ] .
the evolutionary distances were calculated by the p - distance method .
bootstrap values are shown if > 80 % .

background eimeria is a common genus of apicomplexan parasites that infect diverse vertebrates , most notably poultry , causing serious disease and economic losses .
eimeria species have complex life - cycles consisting of three developmental stages .
however , the molecular basis of the eimeria reproductive mode switch remains an enigma .
methods total rna extracted from second - ( mz - 2 ) and third - generation merozoites ( mz - 3 ) of eimeria necatrix was subjected to transcriptome analysis using rna sequencing ( rna - seq ) followed by qrt - pcr validation .
results a total of 6977 and 6901 unigenes were obtained from mz - 2 and mz - 3 , respectively .
approximately 2053 genes were differentially expressed genes ( degs ) between mz - 2 and mz - 3 .
compared with mz - 2 , 837 genes were upregulated and 1216 genes were downregulated in mz - 3 .
approximately 95 genes in mz - 2 and 48 genes in mz - 3 were further identified to have stage - specific expression .
gene ontology category and kegg analysis suggested that 216 upregulated genes in mz - 2 were annotated by 70 go assignments , 242 upregulated genes were associated with 188 signal pathways , while 321 upregulated genes in mz - 3 were annotated by 56 go assignments , 322 upregulated genes were associated with 168 signal pathways .
the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 2 were mainly enriched for protein degradation and amino acid metabolism .
the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 3 were mainly enriched for transcriptional activity , cell proliferation and cell differentiation .
conclusions to the best of our knowledge , this is the first rna - seq data study of the mz - 2 and mz - 3 stages of e. necatrix ; it demonstrates a high number of differentially expressed genes between the mz - 2 and mz - 3 of e. necatrix .
this study forms a basis for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the shift from the second to third generation schizogony in eimeria .
it also provides valuable resources for future studies on eimeria , and provides insight into the understanding of reproductive mode plasticity in different eimeria species .

clinical coccidiosis causes a reduction in weight gain , ineffective feed - conversion , and high levels of mortality .
although coccidiosis is a well - known disease , it still remains one of the most economically important parasitic diseases of the poultry industry throughout the world .
it has been estimated that the total annual cost for avian coccidiosis control is approximately $ 30 - 60 million in china [ 1 ] , and the global cost is likely greater than $ 800 million annually [ 2 ]. with the development of drug resistance in eimeria species threatening the continued use of prophylactic anticoccidials , vaccination remains a desirable long - term strategy for combatting this disease [ 3 ] .
the life - cycle of eimeria spp. is the most straight - forward of any apicomplexan parasite and includes merogony , gametogony and sporogony .
parasites are transmitted via sporulated oocysts .
once ingested , sporozoites are released from the oocysts into intestinal epithelial cells .
several asexual cycles result in the growth of merozoites , which differentiate into the sexual stages .
female macrogametes are fertilized by male microgametes to produce oocysts , which are shed in the feces of infected hosts .
after sporulation in the external environment , oocysts can infect other animals once consumed .
at different developmental stages , the genes expressed , as well as the levels of gene expression , vary .
although the second - and third - generation meronts and merozoites belong to the asexual reproduction stage , the mature second - and third - generation e. tenella merozoites and meronts can be differentiated by periodic acid schiff 's ( pas ) staining , concluded by klimes et al .
[ 4 ] .
cornelissen et al .
[ 5 , 6 ] also found that the two generation merozoites of e. tenella could be differentiated by feulgen - pararosaniline staining .
these reports indicated that the second - and third - generation merozoites had already been sexually differentiated .
the differentiation and development of different biological stages are dependent on the regulation of gene transcription .
a few stage - specific genes have been identified in oocysts , sporozoites and second - generation merozoites of e. tenella , e. maxima and e. acervulina [ 7 - 9 ] in tachyzoites , sporozoites and oocysts of toxoplasma gondii [ 10 - 13 ] and in human and mosquito stages [ 14 ] and gametocyte stages of plasmodium falciparum [ 15 ] , based on profiling quantitative changes in gene transcription .
to date , a global analysis of gene transcription has not yet to be performed for every stage of the coccidian life - cycle , due in part to difficulties in producing sufficient quantities of parasitic material for conventional transcriptional analysis .
eimeria necatrix is a highly pathogenic coccidium that can cause high mortality in susceptible birds .
coccidiosis caused by e. necatrix mainly occurs in chickens older than 8 weeks when raised on a litter floor [ 16 , 17 ] .
compared with other species of avian coccidia , the life - cycle of e. necatrix is somewhat distinct .
its first - and second - generation meronts are primarily located in the mid - intestinal area of host chickens , and its third - generation meronts , and later oocyst development , occur only in the cecum [ 18 ] .
therefore , it is relatively easy to obtain sufficient quantities of the second - and third - generation merozoites through isolation from the mid - intestine and cecum , respectively , of chickens .
to the best of our knowledge , there are no reports to date concerning analysis of the transcriptome of the second - and third - generation merozoites of e. necatrix , nor of its stage - specific genes .
the process of mz - 2 conversion to mz - 3 is confusing , and an issue on whether sex development and differentiation has happened in mz - 3 is also not clear .
in the present study , therefore , we conducted rna sequencing using a next - generation sequencer to identify differentially expressed gene ( deg ) profiling from the second - and third - generation merozoites of e. necatrix .
to gain an understanding of the biology of the differentiation and development of e. necatrix , we determined the expressed mrnas at these stages and the relevant metabolic pathways based on information from other species in the genbank database .
the putative roles of selected degs and significantly enriched signal pathways are potentially involved in the switching from the second to the third generation schizogony and the sex differentiation and development .
this study provides the most comprehensive dataset to date for gene expression in different development stages of e. necatrix , which could facilitate our understanding of molecular mechanisms in reproductive mode switch of eimeria .
methods parasite materials one - day - old chicks ( suqiu yellow chickens ; the poultry institute of china agricultural academy , yangzhou , jiangsu , china ) were reared in a coccidia - free isolation facility and allowed unlimited access to water and food that did not contain any anti - coccidial drugs or antibiotics .
to confirm chickens as free of infection prior to experimental inoculation , feces were analyzed by salt - flotation and light microscopy to ensure the absence of oocysts [ 19 ] .
chickens at 4 weeks of age were orally infected with 2.0 x 104 sporulated oocysts of e. necatrix .
the yangzhou strain of e. necatrix , originally isolated from chickens that died from e. necatrix infection by the key laboratory for avian preventive medicine at yangzhou university , was used in this study .
all animal care and procedures were conducted according to the guidelines for animal use in toxicology .
the study protocol was approved by the animal care and use committee of the college of veterinary medicine , yangzhou university .
preparation of merozoites second - generation merozoites ( mz - 2 ) at 136 h post - infection ( hpi ) , chickens were sacrificed , and their intestines were removed and cut open to clean out the intestinal contents by rinsing in cold pbs .
the mucosa was scraped using a glass slide .
all the collected scrapings were ground down and incubated for 60 min at 37 degreesc in digestion liquid ( 120 mm nacl , 10 mm cacl2 , 3 mm k2hpo4 , 20 mm tris - hcl , 0.1 % bsa , 0.1 % hyaluronidase ) .
large intestinal debris was then removed by filtering through gauze , and smaller debris removed by sequential filtration through 17 mum and 10 mum polymon mesh ( sefar filtration solution co. ltd. , suzhou , china ) .
the merozoites were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min , the supernatant was discarded , and the merozoite pellet was re - suspended in pbs .
after the centrifugation and washing steps were repeated two times , the merozoite pellet was re - suspended in red blood cell lysis buffer ( solarbio , beijing , china ) and allowed to sit at 4 degreesc for 10 min .
the merozoites were then washed with cold pbs three times .
the resulting merozoites were purified by density - gradient centrifugation using the method described by mo et al .
[ 20 ] .
approximately l010 merozoites were recovered from each chicken ( additional file 1 : figure s1a ) .
purified merozoites were stored at - 80 degreesc for further use .
third - generation merozoites ( mz - 3 ) at 144 hpi , chickens were sacrificed , and their ceca were removed and cut open for cleaning of the cecal contents by rinsing in cold pbs .
the mucosa in the distal region of the ceca , approximately 3 cm from the ileo - cecal junction , was scraped using a glass slide .
all the collected scrapings were processed for merozoite isolation as described above .
the resulting merozoites were passed through a deae - 52 cellulose chromatographic column as described by chapman et al .
[ 21 ] .
approximately l07 merozoites were recovered from each chicken ( additional file 1 : figure s1b ) .
purified merozoites were stored at - 80 degreesc for further use .
rna extraction and purification total rna was extracted using rnaiso plus total rna extraction reagent ( takara dalian,china ) , according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the quality of the rna was measured using a nanodrop nd - 2000 , and the integrity was evaluated with an agilent bioanalyzer 2100 ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca , usa ) .
only samples with rna integrity numbers ( rin ) from 7 to 10 were used for further study .
qualified total rna was further purified with an rneasy micro kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) and an rnase - free dnase set ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) and then re - assessed on a bioanalyzer 2100 ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca , usa ) .
cdna library construction and rna - seq illumina sequencing libraries were constructed using a truseq ( tm ) rna sample pre kit ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) .
in brief , 1 - 3 mug of purified total rna was used for isolation of coding rna and non - coding rna using a ribo - zero kit for rrna depletion , and isolated rna samples were simultaneously eluted and fragmented in elute , prime , fragment mix at 94 degreesc for 8 min to obtain 120 - 200 bp inserts .
first - strand cdna was synthesized with superscript ii reverse transcriptase ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) in the presence of random hexamer primers .
second - strand cdna synthesis was carried out at 16 degreesc for 1 h. after polyadenylation of the 3 ' end , the dna fragments were ligated with truseq adapters , and agencourt ( r ) ampure xp beads ( beckman , brea , usa ) were used to isolate the double - strand ( ds ) cdna synthesized by the second strand master mix .
the samples were amplified with truseq pcr primers .
dna size and purity of the cdna library were checked using a high - sensitivity dna 1000 kit on a bioanalyzer 2100 system ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca , usa ) .
the quantification of the cdna libraries was performed with a qubit ( tm ) dsdna hs assay kit on a qubit ( r ) 2.0 fluorometer ( life technologies , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
cluster generation was performed on a paired - end flow cell using a cbot clonal amplification system with a hiseq pe cluster kit v4 ( illumina , san diego , ca , usa ) , and sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform using the sbs 36 - cycle sequencing kit ( v5 ) at shanghai biotechnology corporation ( shanghai , china ) according to manufacturer - recommended cycling parameters .
according to the manufacturer 's instructions , paired reads were sequenced using the double - read multiplex program on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform at shanghai biotechnology corporation .
each library was run on two lanes in a flow cell in order to maximize the total number of rna - seq reads .
sequence data analysis raw reads in fastq format were filtered , and the adaptor sequences and low quality reads were removed .
stringent filtering criteria were used to minimize the effects of sequencing errors during the assembly .
briefly , bases with a 3 terminal quality score lower than 10 and a read - length shorter than 20 bp were discarded .
genome mapping was performed based on the recently published e. necatrix houghton strain reference genome sequence ( gca _ 000499385.1 ) using tophat ( version 2.0.9 ) with a spliced - mapping algorithm .
after genome mapping , reads with less than two - base mismatches and multi hits <= 2 were retained .
identification of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) the mapped fragments were normalized for rna length according to the fragment per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads ( fpkm ) for each gene [ 22 ] , which facilitated the comparison of transcript levels between samples .
differentially expressed genes ( degs ) between the two samples were selected using the following filter criteria : fdr ( false discovery rate ) <= 0.05 and the fold - change >= 2 or log2 ( fpkm ratio of two samples ) >= 1 .
furthermore , the enrichment analysis of degs was conducted with the go database ( http :// www.geneontology.org /) , and the gene number for each go term was calculated .
the main pathways of biochemical and signal transduction significantly associated with degs were determined via kegg pathway analysis .

the mrna was treated with a primescript ( tm ) rt reagent kit with gdna eraser ( perfect real time ) ( takara , dalian , china ) to digest genomic dna and synthesize cdna according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
the primers used for qrt - pcr were designed according to the rna - seq data with primer premier 5.0 software ( premier biosoft international , palo alto , ca , usa ) .
glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) was used as an endogenous marker to normalize the reactions to the same amplification progression. by employing faststart universal sybr green master ( roche , shanghai , china ) , qrt - pcr was performed following the manufacturer 's protocols .
each 20 mul qrt - pcr reaction mixture comprised a 2 mul dilution of cdna , 10 mul 2 x sybr green master and 4 mul ( 10 mum ) of each primer .
pcr amplification was performed with the following cycling parameters : 95 degreesc for 5 min , followed by 45 cycles of 94 degreesc for 10 s , 60 degreesc for 10 s , and 72 degreesc for 15 s. melting curve analysis was performed at the end of the pcr amplification over the range of 60 - 95 degreesc , increasing the temperature stepwise by 0.5 degreesc every 10 s. after amplification , the relative fold change of the differentially expressed genes was calculated through the 2 - deltadeltact method [ 23 ] .
all quantitative pcr analyses for each gene used three biological replicates , with three technical replicates per experiment to guarantee the reproducibility of the amplification .
the rna samples for qrt - pcr were the same as those for illumina sequencing .
differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 .

[ 27 ] identified expression of 76 % of predicted e. tenella genes ( 6700 ) across four developmental life - stages ( unsporulated oocyst , sporulated oocyst , sporozoite and merozoite ) .
the differential expression analysis of rna - seq data in mz - 2 and mz - 3 revealed that 1216 genes were upregulated in mz - 2 and 837 genes were upregulated in mz - 3. of 2053 degs , 95 and 48 genes were specifically expressed in mz - 2 and mz - 3 , respectively .
these genes included , for example , apiap2 dna - binding proteins , eimeria - specific surface antigens ( sags ) , cmgc kinase , dead / deah box helicase domain - containing protein and proliferation - associated protein 2g4 ( pa2g4 ) ( additional file 6 : table s5 ) .
the analysis of stage - specific expression genes revealed that 73 were hypothetical protein - coding genes of the 95 mz - 2 - specific expression genes , and 35 were hypothetical protein - coding genes of the 48 mz - 3 - specific expression genes .
since hypothetical proteins are not annotated in the database and not validated in other reports , we will not discuss them in this article .
there are 8 structural protein - coding genes among the 15 mz - 3 - specific expression genes that were mainly associated with cell morphology , mechanical support , defense , protection and repair .
compared to mz - 3 , of the 22 mz - 2 - specific expression genes , 15 were functional protein - coding genes , which were related to the biological functions such as metabolic , single - organism and cellular processes , and the catalytic activity , binding functions , and meanwhile , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and metabolic pathways were also involved .
these results revealed the functional differences from the specific expression genes between mz - 2 and mz - 3 .
the apicomplexan ap2 ( apiap2 ) family of dna binding proteins was identified as a major class of transcriptional regulators that are found across all apicomplexa that modulate key regulatory decisions at all stages of parasite development and stress - regulated gene expression in plants [ 28 - 30 ] .
ap2 domain proteins play an important role in the transition from asexual to sexual replication in plasmodium [ 31 ] , cryptosporidium parvum [ 32 ] , toxoplasma gondii [ 33 ] and theileria annulata [ 34 ] .
in eimeria , the number of genes containing apiap2 domains was found to vary from 44 to 54 , including 21 eimeria - specific apiap2 groups , 22 additional groups shared by eimeria and other coccidia , and five pan - apicomplexan clusters [ 27 ] .
in our study , we detected 14 genes containing apiap2 domains , of which 12 were upregulated in mz - 2 and 2 were upregulated in mz - 3 .
this difference in expression profiles for apiap2 domain - encoding genes could be associated with the developmental fates of mz - 2 and mz - 3 .
previous work on the merogony of t. annulata in an in vitro system found that the probability of merogony occurring could be increased by inhibition of dna synthesis , while the inhibition of protein synthesis reduced the potential to reach commitment [ 35 ] .
the principal surface antigen gene family in e. tenella is sag , which encodes single domain , membrane - bound proteins tethered by glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( gpi ) anchors to the surface of invasive sporozoites and merozoites [ 36 ] .
the total number of sag genes varies greatly among the seven avian eimeria species , from 19 sags ( e. praecox ) to 172 sags ( e. mitis ) .
eimeria tenella has 89 sags that are further divided into three subfamilies , including saga , sagb and sagc .
the expression profiles for the saga and sagb subfamilies varied in different developmental stages of e. tenella ; a small number of saga genes peaked in expression at each stage , while sagb genes all peaked in expression in second - generation merozoites [ 27 ] .
there are 119 sag genes and 102 pseudogene fragments in the e. necatrix genome [ 27 ] .
in this study , a total of 99 sags ( 88 sags in mz - 2 , 98 sags in mz - 3 ) were detected. of 87 sags expressed in both mz - 2 and mz - 3 , 64 sags displayed upregulation that only occurred in mz - 3. of 64 sags , two sags were specifically expressed in mz - 3 .
this difference in expression profiles for sag genes could be associated with the developmental fates of mz - 2 and mz - 3 .
in the life - cycle of e. necatrix , mz - 2 liberated from the second - generation meronts pass to the cecum , where they penetrate the epithelial cells and develop into third - generation meronts .
thus , the reduced expression of some sags in mz - 2 may be beneficial for parasites to escape from host immune responses .
in contrast to mz - 2 , mz - 3 liberated from the third - generation meronts immediately enters into other cecal epithelial cells near the cecal tonsil , which contains numerous lymphocytes , and become macrogametes or microgamonts .
the increased expression of some sags in mz - 3 may help parasites to attach to the host cells prior to parasite invasion .
cmgc proteins participate in several signaling pathways critical for development processes and cell homeostasis , and dead / deah box proteins play crucial roles in almost all aspects of rna metabolism , including transcription , splicing , translation and decay [ 37 - 39 ] .
it has been proposed that cmgc kinase has evolved independently within the apicomplexa to provide specialized functions related to life - cycle transitions [ 40 ] .
compared to mz - 3 , 4 genes coding for cmgc kinase and 4 genes coding for dead / deah box helicase domain - containing protein were detected in mz - 2 .
proliferation - associated protein 2g4 ( pa2g4 ) , also known as erbb3 - binding protein 1 ( ebp1 ) , is implicated in cell growth , differentiation and apoptosis .
recent reports have shown that ebp1 participates in the regulation of intestinal inflammation via mediating the akt signaling pathway , and the downregulation of ebp1 could accelerate intestinal inflammation [ 41 ] .
in this study , we found that ebp1 was upregulated in mz - 2 .
the upregulation of ebp1 in mz - 2 suggested that parasites could escape immune responses by attenuating inflammatory damage .
go enrichment analysis showed that the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 2 and mz - 3 were different .
the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 2 were mainly enriched in proteasomal degradation , which is essential for many cellular processes , including the cell cycle , the regulation of gene expression , and responses to oxidative stress .
the proteasome plays a straightforward but critical role in the function of the adaptive immune system .
the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 3 were mainly enriched in transcription , cell division , cell differentiation and rna splicing via the spliceosome .
the kegg enrichment analysis also revealed that the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 2 and mz - 3 were different .
the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 2 were mainly enriched for protein degradation and amino acid metabolism .
the molecular functions of upregulated genes in mz - 3 were mainly enriched for transcriptional activity , cell proliferation and cell differentiation .
conclusions the present study represents the first report on a large - scale analysis of differentially expressed genes between mz - 2 and mz - 3 of e. necatrix using rna - seq .
our study adds a number of genes to the list of candidate genes involved in the reproductive mode plasticity of eimeria .
thus , these results provide a comprehensive gene expression profile among asexual reproduction stages of e. necatrix , and will extend our knowledge of the putative regulation of sex differentiation and development in eimeria .
further studies on the candidate genes will help to unfold the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from mz - 2 to mz - 3 of the e. necatrix as well as to develop novel strategies for coccidiosis control .

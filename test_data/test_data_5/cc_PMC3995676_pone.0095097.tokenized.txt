forster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) technology relies on the close proximity of two compatible fluorophores for energy transfer .
tagged ( cy3 and cy5 ) complementary dna strands forming a stable duplex and a doubly - tagged single strand were shown to demonstrate fret outside of a cellular environment .
fret was also observed after transfecting these dna strands into fixed and live cells using methods such as microinjection and electroporation , but not when using lipid based transfection reagents , unless in the presence of the endosomal acidification inhibitor bafilomycin .
avoiding the endocytosis pathway is essential for efficient delivery of intact dna probes into cells .

introduction dna and its derivatives have the potential to detect , monitor and control the expression levels of specific genes in living cells in real time [ 1 ] , which has led to interest in various therapeutic developments based on nucleic acids such as antisense treatments [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] and gene screening [ 4 ] .
the benefits of using dna include its high selectivity and non - toxicity as well the relative ease with which various functional tags can be introduced for monitoring in a cellular environment .
however there are several issues that need to be considered when using this approach , centred around firstly the most effective method for delivery and secondly the fate of the dna once it is introduced into the cell .
as far as the latter is concerned , several strategies [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] have been employed to mitigate factors such as susceptibility to degradation by nucleases [ 8 ] , non - specific binding to proteins and unwanted migration to the nucleus if the interaction with non - nuclear targets is required [ 9 ] .
the most popular technique for effecting non - viral delivery of dna into cells ( i.e. transfection as opposed to transduction ) is to use chemical reagents that facilitate the passage of polyanionic dna through the membrane bilayer [ 10 ] .
dna modification has also been shown to enhance cell delivery , with attached peptides facilitating chemical transfection [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] and locked nucleic acids ( lna ) shown to have been taken up without the use of transfection reagents [ 13 ] .
another uptake methodology is microinjection , which has been used in a study comparing the cell stability of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] .
a common alternative to microinjection is electroporation , which uses a rapid and high - voltage electric pulse that causes pore formation in the membrane [ 16 ] .
nevertheless there is a sparsity of literature that compares different transfection methodologies and their possible effect on intracellular dna stability .
we decided to address this by embarking on a controlled fundamental study to compare the various techniques for transfection of dna into cells , including invasive methods such as microinjection and electroporation , and non - invasive methods such as chemical transfection .
fluorescence microscopy was chosen as the method for monitoring cell transfection through the use of fluorophore - tagged dna strands [ 17 ] , which is by far the most common way of tracking cellular processes in vitro .
doubly tagged single strands or duplexes were chosen to allow transfection to be monitored by forster resonance energy transfer ( fret ) .
fret is the physical process that occurs when the excited - state energy of a donor fluorophore is transferred nonradiatively to an acceptor in the ground state [ 18 ] , which results in quenching of the donor fluorophore and excitation of the acceptor .
the efficiency of energy transfer depends on the spectral overlap of the emission and absorption spectra of the donor and acceptor respectively , as well as their respective distance and orientation .
the distance dependence of fret can monitor differences over the range of 10 - 100 a , which is ideal for macromolecules such as nucleic acids [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
fret can be used to detect and quantify sequences extracted from biological samples [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] including real - time pcr assays [ 24 ] - [ 26 ] .
it has also been widely used to detect hybridisation of donor - and acceptor - labelled complementary nucleic acid strands [ 27 ] - [ 30 ] .
this in turn can allow the integrity of a duplex to be monitored upon entry into the cell , which is relevant to this study .
as for the choice of fret pair , fluorophores cy3 ( donor ) and cy5 ( acceptor ) are commonly used in nucleic acid experiments due to their easy attachment to dna , high fret efficiency , relatively low photobleaching and long emission wavelengths away from the autofluorescence region of cells [ 31 ] .
as described below , having confirmed that cy3 - cy5 - tagged dna displays fret in a cuvette in its single stranded and duplex form , a comparison of the effectiveness of delivery of intact dna to cells using fret is then described , via various techniques that include chemical transfection , microinjection and electroporation .
the work demonstrates how the choice of technique is crucial for optimising the stability of dna strands and duplexes in a cellular environment .

results synthesis and characterisation of dna probes table 1 shows the main oligonucleotides synthesised for this study ( for non - complementary oligonucleotides see table s1 in file s1 ) .
tagged dna strands were prepared by automated solid phase synthesis using conventional phosphoramidite chemistry , as reported previously [ 32 ] .
complementary strands s1 and s2 containing respectively a cy3 and a cy5 fluorophore at the 5 ' terminus were prepared for duplex studies , in addition to a strand containing the fluorophores at each end ( s3 ) .
each strand was purified by reversed phase hplc ( table s2 , figures s1 - s5 in file s1 ) and characterised by mass spectrometry ( table s3 in file s1 ) , with uv - vis melting studies confirming that the s1 : s2 duplex was stable at both room temperature and at 37degreesc in salt conditions appropriate for cell studies ( 10 mm nacl ) ( table s4 in file s1 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0095097.t001 table 1 tagged oligonucleotides synthesized .
oligonucleotide name sequence ( 5 ' to 3 ') cy3 strand ( s1 ) cy3 - tggactctctcaatg cy5 strand ( s2 ) cy5 - cattgagagagtcca cy3 and cy5 strand ( s3 ) cy5 - tggactctctcaatg - cy3 cuvette fluorescence spectroscopy for both strand s3 and the s1 : s2 duplex , the cy3 - cy5 fluorophore pair was expected to be in close enough proximity to display fret ( figure 1 ) .
fret was indeed evidenced by fluorescence spectroscopy studies in a cuvette ( 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer , 100 mm nacl , ph 7.0 , 1 microm each dna strand ) in which the emission intensity from the cy3 and cy5 tags was monitored over the range 500 - 800 nm , when exciting only the cy3 chromophore directly .
in particular a titration study involving the addition of s2 to s1 indicated that the cy3 signal at 570 nm decreased , while the signal for cy5 at 670 nm increased , with no further increases observed after the addition of one molar equivalent of the target , consistent with 1:1 duplex formation ( figure 2 ) .
control studies indicated little or no emission at 670 nm when s2 was irradiated alone in the absence of s1 at 554 nm under the same conditions .
similar results and trends were obtained for the doubly - tagged strand s3 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0095097.g001 figure 1 schematic of cy3 and cy5 tagged dna .
a ) complementary dna strands are individually tagged with cy3 and cy5 fluorophores ( s1 and s2 respectively ) .
when in close enough proximity the cy3 can donate energy to cy5 through fret .
in this case , fret can only occur when the two complementary strands form a duplex .
b ) single strand dna can be tagged at either end with cy3 and cy5 ( s3 ) .
fret can occur as long as the single strand remains intact .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0095097.g002 figure 2 emission spectra of cy3 and cy5 dna .
titration of cy5 tagged dna ( s2 ) into cy3 tagged dna ( s1 ) , showing resulting cy5 - cy3 fret upon duplex formation ( excitation wavelength = 554 nm ) .
the emission intensities centred at 570 nm and 670 nm correspond to emission from cy3 and cy5 respectively ( conditions : 1 microm dna , 100 mm nacl , and ph 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer ) .
the spectra are subtracted for the spectrum of s2 alone , excited at 554 nm , which gave a small signal caused by direct excitation of the cy5 chromophore .
the fret signal from the s1 : s2 duplex and s3 were then studied in cho cell lysate at 37degreesc in the absence and presence of dnase ( figures s6 - s7 in file s1 ) .
in cell lysate alone , over a period of 2 hours , only small changes in the emission spectra were observed .
however as expected , the addition of nuclease brought about a rapid decrease in the fret signal for both systems , indicating backbone cleavage of the dna in either its single - stranded or duplex form [ 30 ] .
fixed cell fluorescence microscopy having observed the desired fret effect under cuvette conditions , the same strands were then exposed to cho cells that had previously been fixed using methanol , to allow the strands to readily permeate into the cell , which was otherwise not possible with live cells .
the successful transfection of s1 : s2 as an intact duplex was evidenced by fret ( figure 3 ) at room temperature using scanning laser confocal microscopy .
the key result was the observation of a signal in image b ( cy5 channel ) upon excitation at the cy3 absorption wavelength , with a control study indicating no emission observed under these conditions when fixed cells were transfected with s2 alone ( figure s8 in file s1 ) .
quantitative data extracted from the intensities of the cell images in figure 3 also showed significant fret based on the ratio between the cy5 intensity and cy3 intensity upon excitation at the cy3 absorption wavelength only ( figure 3 , first two bars on chart ) .
the in situ formation of a duplex was also indicated by fret when the strands were added sequentially ( s1 followed by s2 ) in order to replicate the cuvette experiment and show that the sequences were able to find each other in a cell environment ( figure s9 in file s1 ) .
a similar fret signal was also seen on the addition of s3 to fixed cells but as expected , non - complementary cy3 and cy5 - tagged dna strands , added either together or sequentially , were shown not to display fret ( figures s10 - s11 in file s1 ) .
to enable a closer comparison with the cuvette studies , emission spectra were also recorded in fixed cell samples using spectral imaging inverted confocal microscopy ( figure s12 in file s1 ) , and these gave broadly similar profiles , confirming the presence of fret in fixed cells within both the s1 : s2 duplex and the s3 strand .

live cell fluorescence microscopy whereas fixed cells could be readily transfected by simple exposure to a pbs solution of the modified dna strands in their single stranded or duplex forms , as expected , established transfection methodologies were required to transfect live cells , as described below .
1. chemical transfection the preformed s1 : s2 duplex in pbs was treated with the chemical transfection agent lipofectamine .
fret was still observed for the complex between dna and lipofectamine ( figure s13 in file s1 ) prior to incubation with cho cells and visualisation by confocal microscopy as before .
once again , excitation of the cy3 and cy5 fluorophores at their respective excitation wavelengths indicated that they were both present within cells and co - localised .
however this time when only the cy3 laser was turned on , no cy5 signal was observed , and hence no fret was occurring ( image c , figure 4 ) .
quantitative data in figure 4 clearly shows negligible cy5 signal compared to cy3 signal upon excitation at the cy3 absorption wavelength only ( figure 4 , first two bars on chart ) .
similar results were observed for the chemical transfection of s3 ( figure s14 in file s1 ) , which meant that the absence of fret being ascribed to dissociation of the duplex in the cellular environment could be essentially ruled out .
emission spectra were also measured for chemically transfected cell samples using spectral imaging inverted confocal microscopy ( figure s15 in file s1 ) , which confirmed the absence of a fret signal under these conditions .

images a / e represents the cy3 channel ; b / f the nuclear stain channel ; c / g the cy5 channel and d / h an overlay of all the channels .
images a - d are excited with a 543 nm laser only .
images e - h are excited with both the 543 and 633 nm lasers .
right : intracellular fluorescence intensity from images a / c and e / g. data are expressed as mean +/ - s.e.m from at least ten cells ( p < 0.001 ) .
it was observed that the cy3 and cy5 fluorescence was to some extent co - localised in a punctate pattern rather than being evenly distributed .
these results were consistent with the tagged dna being unable to be released from endosomes once within the cell and subsequently digested by nucleases [ 12 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
it is hypothesised that the tagged oligonucleotides , whether in their single strand or duplex forms , are being degraded within vesicles on entry to the cell via endocytosis .
when strands s1 and s2 were transfected into cells individually under these conditions , there was shown to be no crosstalk between the cy3 and cy5 channels , since upon excitation , only signals from their respective channels were observed ( figure s16 in file s1 ) .
as expected , non - complementary cy3 and cy5 oligonucleotides added together via chemical transfection were also shown not to display fret ( figure s17 in file s1 ) .
2. microinjection cy3 and cy5 oligonucleotides s1 and s2 were then added to cells via microinjection as a preformed duplex .
under these conditions and in contrast to the chemical transfection study , this time when only the cy3 chromophore was excited using a 543 nm laser , a signal was observed in the cy5 channel , confirming the occurrence of fret ( image b , figure 5 ) .
quantitative data in figure 5 clearly shows significant cy5 signal compared to cy3 signal upon excitation at the cy3 absorption wavelength only ( figure 5 , first two bars on chart ) .
once again the control study involving the microinjection of the cy5 strand s2 only and excitation at 543 nm gave a negligible signal , which confirmed that the fret signal was genuine ( figure s18 in file s1 ) .
other control studies , which included the microinjection of the doubly - tagged s3 strand and that of a non - complementary strand pair , gave the expected results , with fret only occurring for the s3 system ( figures s19 - s21 in file s1 ) .

right : intracellular fluorescence intensity from images a / b and e / f. data are expressed as mean +/ - s.e.m from at least ten cells ( p < 0.001 ) .
3. electroporation cy3 and cy5 oligonucleotides ( s1 and s2 ) were next added to cells via electroporation .
the results were similar to the microinjection studies in that when the cy3 tag in the s1 : s2 duplex was excited using a 543 nm laser , a signal present in the cy5 channel was observed ( image b , figure 6 ) to indicate fret , which was again supported by control studies including s2 alone ( figures s22 - s23 in file s1 ) .
quantitative analysis of the cell images in figure 6 confirmed the fret signal , although the ratio of the cy5 signal to cy3 signal was smaller than for microinjection ( figure 6 , first two bars on chart ) .
sequential studies involving the addition of s1 and s2 were less conclusive , possibly due at least in part to the damaging effect of physically perturbing the live cell environment more than once .
once again , the controls of adding s3 and non - complementary strands gave the expected results , with fret signal observed for the s3 system only ( figures s24 - s25 in file s1 ) .
compared to microinjection , the fluorescence was seen to be not as evenly distributed throughout each cell .
this would suggest that the dna strands show a tendency to accumulate in distinct areas .

discussion the results from the cuvette studies clearly indicate that energy transfer via fret can occur both intramolecularly in the case of s3 and intermolecularly upon formation of the s1 : s2 duplex .
melting studies confirmed the stability of the duplexes under cell conditions .
furthermore cell lysate studies demonstrate that these systems can in principle remain intact over a period of a few hours if they are not exposed to degrading nucleases .
however our results on these systems in cells clearly indicate that the type of technique employed and the status of the cell ( fixed or live ) have a strong bearing on the degree to which fret imaging can be successfully observed .
cells are commonly fixed and permeabilised with alcohols or formaldehyde .
however this is incompatible with live cell imaging and the effect of fixation on dna in cells is uncertain .
nevertheless , these studies clearly indicate that dna can easily enter fixed / permeabilised cells , as evidenced by the observation of a strong fret signal when tagged dna is added either as a duplex or sequentially. that dna duplexes of this length can remain intact from either simultaneous or sequential addition to fixed cells is clearly shown from these studies , with no fret observed when using non - complementary strands under the same conditions .
the transfection of live cells with dna was certainly found to be more challenging , with generally less material entering compared to fixed cells .
despite these strands being relatively small in size , the hydrophilicity and negative charge of the dna backbone prevents it from crossing biological membranes of live cells unaided .
although chemical transfection has been reported as being relatively inefficient (< 80 %) [ 33 ] , [ 35 ] and slow ( delivery times ~ 4 hours ) , it is well established that lipid - based chemical transfection reagents help to mask the negative charge , which allows binding to the cell membrane , uptake by receptor - mediated endocytosis and deposition into endosomes [ 36 ] .
our studies indicate that this technique does indeed facilitate cell transfection of singly or double stranded dna .
however in each case , no fret signal was observed , even though the respective fluorophores were shown to be co - localised .
furthermore the bright spots of fluorescence from both fluorophores suggest that the dna is not released from the endocytotic vesicles that are formed , which is consistent with nuclease degradation and supports similar findings in previous studies [ 12 ] , [ 33 ] , [ 37 ] .
this interpretation was supported by repeating the transfection experiments on the s1 : s2 duplex and s3 in the presence of bafilomycin , which is known to block degradation by preventing the acidification of the endosomal vesicles [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] .
it was interesting to note that under these conditions , dna was found to be still internalised into vesicles but no longer degraded , with a fret signal now observed ( images b / d , figure s26 in file s1 ) .
in contrast to chemical transfection , degradation of dna in cells does not appear to be a major issue when microinjection or electroporation is used as the transfection technique .
in each case , when the dna was added , the s1 : s2 duplex and the s3 single strand were less degraded , as evidenced by the observation of a fret signal .
in the case of microinjection , the fluorescence signal was generally evenly distributed throughout the cell .
microinjection can precisely add a controlled dose of material to a single cell , either to the nucleus or cytoplasm [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
however as found here , despite the high transfection efficiency , microinjection typically only treats a small proportion of cultured cells and also can lead to physical stress [ 42 ]. by comparing the quantitative data in figures 5 and 6 , it can be seen that the fret efficiency , defined here as the ratio between the cy5 intensity and cy3 intensity upon excitation at the cy3 absorption wavelength only , is approximately halved for electroporation compared to microinjection .
despite this , electroporation is a less cumbersome technique , although under the conditions used here , the cell fluorescence distribution was less uniform than in the case of microinjection , which indicates a possible accumulation of the dna in vesicles .
however , although fret was not widely observed across a large number of cells , it appears that any vesicles that may form are less primed to degrade the dna than those formed via the endocytotic pathway .
in conclusion , this work represents a relatively rare example of a controlled study that compares a range of different dna transfection techniques using both fixed and live cells .
the work underlines the issues that surround the stability and viability of dna delivered into live cells by lipid - based transfection , whether the dna is single or double stranded .
in the field of nucleic acid chemistry , it appears that this technique is a more viable option when using other types of nucleic acid ( e.g. sirna ) that are capable of entering the cell intact via endocytotic pathways [ 43 ] .
otherwise suitable inhibitors have to be used ( e.g. bafilomycin ) or chemical modifications to the nucleic acid structure have to be made to mitigate nuclease degradation [ 44 ] - [ 46 ] .
on the other hand , our studies indicate that the techniques of microinjection and electroporation are both viable as alternative methods for transfecting cells with single - stranded or duplex dna .
this work provides a further example of the power of fret in probing the fate of dna duplexes in cells and as such is relevant to related hybridisation studies in living cells [ 47 ] - [ 49 ] .
continued work in this area using different nucleic acids , targets , fluorophores , delivery techniques and conditions will only increase our understanding of how dna and its derivatives may be delivered into cells efficiently and effectively .

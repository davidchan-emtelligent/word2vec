although melanin plays and important role in skin protection , excessive melanin production or hyperpigmentation may lead to skin cancer .
recently , the inhibition of melanogenesis has been considered as a valid therapeutic target for the management of advanced melanotic melanomas [ 2 ] which increases the need for melanogenesis inhibitors that are of plant origin and are not cytotoxic to mammalian cells .
the biosynthesis of the pigment melanin is catalyzed by the melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase , tyrosinase related protein 1 and the dopachrome tautomerase , the transcriptional regulation of which is being regulated by the microphthalmia associated transcription factor ( mitf ) [ 3 ] .
previously , we have reported that hirsein b ( hb ) or 5beta - hydroxyresiniferonol - 6alpha,7alpha - epoxy - 12beta - coumaroyloxy - 9,13,14 - ortho - decanoate from thymelaea hirsuta [ 4 ] has antimelanogenesis effect ( without cytotoxicity ) on b16 murine melanoma cells by downregulating the expressions of the mitf gene and the melanogenic enzymes' genes [ 5 ] .
the exact mechanism by which hirsein b inhibited the mitf gene expression , however , has not yet been determined .
in melanogenesis , the mitf gene expression can be regulated through the camp pathway or the wnt signaling pathway .
this study aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of hb on mitf gene in b16 murine melanoma cells .
materials and methods total rna was isolated from b16 murine melanoma cells ( riken cell bank , tsukuba , japan ) and used for dna microarray analysis , using chips of 528 spots loaded with 265 genes prepared by genopal ( tm ) ( mitsubishi rayon co. , ltd , tokyo , japan ) , to determine the expressions of genes for melanogenesis , membrane - bound receptors , tyrosine kinase regulation , melanosome transport , and other cell signal regulation - related genes ( including the housekeeping and negative control genes ) .
to validate the results , real - time pcr , using taqman fast 7500 ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) and specific taqman primers ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) for the differentially - expressed genes , was performed .
results results showed that the expressions of the mitf gene and the melanogenic enzymes' genes were downregulated , verifying our previous report [ 5 ] .
in addition , the expression of the gene for melanocortin 1 receptor ( mc1r ) of the camp pathway was downregulated while most of the genes that were upregulated are those involved in the wnt signaling pathway ( table 1 ) .

conclusions the results obtained suggest that the significant antimelanogenesis effect of hirsein b is through the inhibition of the expression of the mc1r gene of the camp pathway .
hb may therefore be used as a treatment for hyperpigmentation due to its significant melanogenesis downregulation effects in b16 cells or as a pretreatment for melanotic melanomas .

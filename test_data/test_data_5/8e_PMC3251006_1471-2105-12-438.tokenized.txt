background to utilize the large volume of gene expression information generated from different microarray experiments , several meta - analysis techniques have been developed .
despite these efforts , there remain significant challenges to effectively increasing the statistical power and decreasing the type i error rate while pooling the heterogeneous datasets from public resources .
the objective of this study is to develop a novel meta - analysis approach , consistent differential expression pattern ( cdep ) , to identify genes with common differential expression patterns across different datasets .
results we combined false discovery rate ( fdr ) estimation and the non - parametric rankprod approach to estimate the type i error rate in each microarray dataset of the meta - analysis .
these type i error rates from all datasets were then used to identify genes with common differential expression patterns .
our simulation study showed that cdep achieved higher statistical power and maintained low type i error rate when compared with two recently proposed meta - analysis approaches .
we applied cdep to analyze microarray data from different laboratories that compared transcription profiles between metastatic and primary cancer of different types .
many genes identified as differentially expressed consistently across different cancer types are in pathways related to metastatic behavior , such as ecm - receptor interaction , focal adhesion , and blood vessel development .
we also identified novel genes such as amigo2 , gem , and cxcl11 that have not been shown to associate with , but may play roles in , metastasis .
conclusions cdep is a flexible approach that borrows information from each dataset in a meta - analysis in order to identify genes being differentially expressed consistently .
we have shown that cdep can gain higher statistical power than other existing approaches under a variety of settings considered in the simulation study , suggesting its robustness and insensitivity to data variation commonly associated with microarray experiments .
availability : cdep is implemented in r and freely available at : http :// genomebioinfo.musc.edu / cdep / contact : zhengw @ musc.edu background investigating transcription profile by microarray technology has been one of the most promising genomic approaches in the last decade .
thousands of microarray experiments were performed for this purpose and their data made available through databases such as gene expression omnibus , arrayexpress and stanford microarray database [ 1 - 3 ] .
to utilize this massive amount of information , investigators have developed different meta - analysis techniques - - parametric approaches such as t - statistic [ 4,5 ] ; fisher 's inverse chi - square approach [ 6 ] ; bayesian [ 7 - 9 ] , and non - parametric approaches [ 10,11 ] .
however , these approaches still face many challenges in combining data from different sources [ 12,13 ] .
for example , parametric bayesian models used in meta - analysis [ 7,8 ] are not appropriate due to the small sample size for many datasets , as suggested by kong et al .
[ 11 ] .
on the other hand , non - parametric methods such as rankprod - based meta - analysis approach ( meta - rankprod ) [ 14,15 ] can be significantly influenced by the size of the dataset and hence biased toward genes that are only differentially expressed in a dataset with a large number of samples - - an undesirable outcome for studies where the objective is to find genes with differentially expressed patterns common across the datasets .
the method of rhodes et al .
[ 16 ] , which we refer to as meta - profile , combines a parametric and non - parametric approach and gives equal weight to each dataset when counting the number of times a gene is identified as differentially expressed in all datasets .
however , this is a significant simplification because the resulting power to identify differentially expressed genes and type i error rate ( i.e. false positive rate ) vary by dataset according to sample size and proportion of genes truly differentially expressed [ 17 ] .
the challenges faced by these methods are particularly evident when identifying genes differentially expressed across different cancer types by pooling datasets from various sources .
these datasets typically have small sample sizes [ 18 ] and the analyses are influenced by cancer - type and / or cancer - subtype specific effects [ 16,19,20 ] .
in addition , some methods such as meta - rankprod do not handle varying numbers of differentially expressed genes from different datasets - - an issue that needs to be addressed for a meta - analysis approach to be robust .
the objective of this study is to develop a robust meta - analysis approach to identify genes with consistent differential expression patterns across different datasets .
in our study , we combined fdr and the non - parametric rankprod approach to estimate the type i error rate in each dataset .
the estimated rates from all datasets were combined using a bernoulli likelihood to identify genes with common expression pattern .
the robustness of this approach in obtaining high statistical power was shown by simulation studies .
we then applied the method to analyze different microarray data that compared gene expressions between metastatic and primary cancers and identified a core gene set that is critical to cancer metastasis across different cancer types .
our analysis identified many genes annotated in pathways that are related to metastasis , as well as novel genes that have not been shown to associate with , but may play roles in , metastasis .
further sensitivity analysis indicates that the method is robust and can be applied to other datasets for similar analyses .
results consistent differential expression pattern ( cdep ) the key components of cdep are the application of : 1 ) consistent fdr across datasets to identify significant genes [ 16,21 ] ; and 2 ) non - parametric rank product ( rankprod ) approach to identify differentially expressed genes from microarray experiments [ 10 ]. by first using a consistent fdr to estimate the type i error rates in each dataset , cdep avoids overemphasizing datasets with large sample sizes - - a drawback of a previous rankprod - based meta - analysis approach ( meta - rankprod ) [ 14 ] .
cdep then uses the error rates from all datasets to identify genes with consistent differential expression patterns .
figure 1 shows the workflow of cdep .
figure 1 the workflow of cdep .
each " plate " in the figure represents an instance of gene ( g = 1,2 ,... g ) , dataset ( i = 1,2 ,... d ) , or dataset local fdr threshold ( l in ( 0,1 )) .
this workflow diagram only illustrates how to identify consistently up - regulated genes , but the same procedure was applied to identify consistently down - regulated genes .
specifically , let dataset i , i = 1 , 2 , ... , d , consist of gene expression levels for mi and ni samples in each of two conditions , respectively ( e.g. mi cases and ni controls ) .
for dataset i , the geometric mean rank of gene g = 1 , 2 , ... , g was computed across all mini = hi pairwise comparisons for up - regulation : ( 1a ) gamma giup = producth = 1higammagihup1 / hi and down - regulation : ( 1b ) gamma gidown = producth = 1higammagihdown1 / hi where gammagih is the rank of fold change for gene g in the hth comparison of dataset i , h = 1 , 2 , ... , hi. genes with the smallest rankprod values ( gamma gi ) are more likely to be the differentially expressed genes .
we then computed the rankprod p - values and fdrs for up - and down - regulations for each gene in every dataset [ 10 ] .
briefly , we used permutation of the sample labels ( e.g. case / control ) to estimate false positives and the p - value by counting the number of times we observed the permutations' rankprod values smaller or equal to the experiment 's rankprod value .
the fdr of a gene was then estimated by dividing the p - value by the rank of the rankprod value [ 10 ] .
each gene in every dataset was thus associated with an fdr , fgiup ( fgidown ) , for being up ( down ) - regulated .
for genes not present in the platform of a dataset , the median fdr value computed for that dataset was assigned .
this computation in cdep was performed using the bioconductor [ 22 ] package rankprod [ 15 ] , as hong and breitling [ 14 ] indicated that rankprod is more reliable than other existing approaches ( see also additional file 1 , figure s1 ) .
the fdr threshold ( l ) is defined as the proportion of false positives among the genes declared to be positives for each dataset .
given an fdr threshold ( l ) , we counted the number of genes identified to be up - regulated : ( 2a ) dilup = sumgi ( fgiup < l ) and down - regulated : ( 2b ) dildown = sumgi ( fgidown < l ) therefore , the number of false positives in a dataset could be estimated as filup =~ l * dupil ( fildown =~ l * ddownil ) .
to estimate the proportion of genes that are up - regulated , non - differentially expressed , and down - regulated , we used a beta mixture to model the genes' p - values for over ( under ) - expression in each dataset ( see details of the beta mixture model in methods ) .
we adopted the beta mixture model because the p - values calculated from our non - parametric approach do not have a uniform distribution for non - differentially expressed genes ( figure 2 ) , in contrast to a previous mixture model based on this assumption [ 23 ] .
the beta mixture model and the estimation of the proportion of differentially expressed genes used the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique implemented in the bugs program [ 24 ] .
our implementation uses winbugs [ 25 ] on the windows platform , but openbugs [ 26 ] can be used on linux or mac platforms ( with wine ) .
figure 2 the distributions of p - values computed by t - test and rankprod test .
we compared the parametric t - test and the non - parametric rank product approaches to test which of these p - value ( computed from one - sided test ) calculation is robust for identifying truly differentially expressed genes ( p = q = 0.05 ; | delta | = 0.5 ) .
for each dataset , the false positive rate is defined as the probability of a non - up - regulated ( non - down - regulated ) gene being falsely called as over - expressed ( under - expressed ) : r ^ upil =~ filup / mup i ( r ^ downil =~ fildown / mdown i ) , where mup i ( mdown i ) are the number of genes that are not up ( down ) - regulated in dataset i respectively , estimated by the beta mixture model .
based on this rate and using independent bernoulli distributions , we calculated the likelihood of a gene to be falsely identified as over or under - expressed among the datasets for each fdr threshold l , that is , the likelihood for false positives among the significant genes identified as up - regulated : ( 3a ) l ( rglup | data )= producti = 1drilup ( deltagilup )( 1 - rilup )( 1 - deltagilup ) and down - regulated : ( 3b ) l ( rgldown | data )= producti = 1drildown ( deltagildown )( 1 - rildown )( 1 - deltagildown ) where the binary variable deltagilup ( or deltagildown ) indicates whether gene g is identified to be up ( or down ) - regulated in dataset i for threshold l. to prevent underflow during computation , we worked with the minus log likelihood , q , e.g. for up - regulation qupgl = - ln [ l ( rglup | data )] .
we took into consideration of multiple fdr thresholds l by specifying a probability density function ( pdf ) for l , p ( l ) , lin ( 0 , 1 ) and using the expected value of q ( l ) to assess whether the gene is consistently over - expressed among the datasets .
in this assessment , low l values were emphasized because low fdr represents a higher proportion of true positives , and we used the linear decreasing function : p ( l ) = - 2l + 2 .
the expected log likelihood across the fdr threshold is : elupg = integral 01qglupp ( l ) dl , which was approximated by discretizing the range of fdr value ( l ) into one hundred bins with equal width and using the rectangular rule .
the same procedure was also performed for down - regulation .
the procedure was evaluated by estimating the false discovery rate ( fdrg ) of observing the above expected log likelihood .
here , the fdrg is the proportion of false positives among the genes identified to be consistently differentially expressed .
the " null log likelihood " was computed by permuting the fgiup and fgidown values relative to the genes within each dataset and performing the same above procedures to calculate the expected value of the " null log likelihood " in each permutation b for every gene ( elbg ) .
in b permutations , the fdrg of a gene could be determined as : ( 4 ) fdrg =( 1 / b ) sumbsumg'i ( elg <= elbg ') sumg'i ( elg <= elg ') the robustness of cdep in distinguishing different gene expression patterns is shown in figure 3 where the minus log likelihood value q was plotted against l. genes that are not differentially expressed in all datasets ( gn ) have the lowest q values , while genes that are differentially expressed only in some datasets ( gc ) have higher q values , and genes that are differentially expressed in all the datasets ( gm ) have the highest q values .
for gn , the q values increase slightly with l. this is because when l increases , the likelihood value decreases as more gn are falsely called differentially expressed .
moreover , even at high l many gn are not declared differentially expressed .
on the other hand , the q values of both gc and gm decrease when l increases .
as l increases , r and the likelihood ( l ) increase , giving rise to a decreasing q. note that the q values for all 3 types of genes go to zero when l = 1 .
this is because , in this situation , all genes in the array would be declared as differentially expressed and both r and l have values of one .
figure 4 shows the expected minus log likelihood ( el ) for the three types of genes , indicating cdep is robust in identifying genes that show common differential expression pattern across different datasets .
these genes have higher el values than the other two types of genes .

the three lines show the mean , and the vertical bars show the standard deviation of the q values for the three types of genes at the given fdr .
for clarity , only the upper bars are shown .

the width of the boxplot is drawn proportional to the square - root of the number of observations .
p = q = 0.1 , | delta | = 1 .
comparisons with other approaches we compared cdep with meta - profile and meta - rankprod in a simulation study .
briefly , meta - profile is based on the number of times a gene is declared differentially expressed among the datasets , and meta - rankprod uses the rank product among all datasets .
both approaches use permutation to estimate the false discovery rate for the genes as being differentially expressed consistently among the datasets .
simulation scenarios were determined by three key parameters : the proportion of differentially expressed genes that are dataset - specific ( p ) , the proportion of genes that are consistently differently expressed ( q ) , and the mean difference between the expression values in the two conditions being compared ( delta ) ( see " simulation of microarray data " in methods and simulation section in additional file 1 for details ) .
table 1 reports the statistical power and type i error rate of the three meta - analysis approaches , where statistical power is defined as the sensitivity of detecting genes that have consistent differential expression patterns across datasets .
the results show that raising fdr increases the statistical power and type i error rate for all three approaches .
increasing the mean difference (| delta |) between the two conditions ( e.g. case vs. control ) of the differentially expressed genes also improves sensitivity .
in addition , the impact of the proportion of gm on cdep and meta - rankprod is obvious : the higher the proportion of gm ( i.e. , q ) , the lower the statistical power and type i error rate .
the reason is that obtaining fdr for these two approaches requires permutation and recalculation of elgb and rpgb .
after permutation , original gm genes would act as gc in cdep and gn in meta - rankprod .
as a result , when there is a higher proportion of gm from the datasets , including these genes to estimate fdr would potentially lead to over - estimation because the variance of these genes is different from the non - differentially expressed genes [ 27 ] .
therefore , under the same fdr , the statistical power and the type i error would be lower for higher q in cdep and meta - rankprod , especially when comparing q = 0.1 with q = 0.2 .
in contrast , meta - profile takes a relatively conservative approach , and is insensitive to genes that do not have consistent differential expression patterns .
however , the tradeoff is the loss in statistical power .
as shown in table 1 , even though the type i error rate is amongst the lowest of the three approaches , the meta - profile method has the lowest statistical power .
overall , cdep emerges as a robust meta - analysis method that obtains comparably high statistical power while maintaining low type i error rate under different simulated conditions ( see additional file 1 , section 3 : comparison between different approaches for genes appearing in different numbers of datasets .
more simulation results can be found in additional file 2 ) .

using cdep to identify a core gene set that is differentially expressed in metastatic cancer we used cdep to investigate the hypothesis that there exists a core gene set differentially expressed consistently in different types of metastatic cancer cells .
six different types of cancer were investigated for this purpose ( table 2 ) [ 28 - 34 ] .
totally there are 220 samples , of which 126 are from primary and 84 from metastatic cancer , respectively .
the diversity of these datasets ( i.e. a wide variety of labs , different numbers of samples and probesets for different experiments , etc. ) make them ideal for assessing the robustness of cdep and exploring our hypothesis .
we used rma [ 35 ] to pre - process the raw data for each dataset , and the median expression value of the probesets matching to the same entrez gene id was used as the expression level for the gene .

* oscc = oral squamous cell carcinoma ; # rcc = renal cell carcinoma at fdr <= 0.05 , cdep identified 239 genes that are differentially expressed consistently between the primary and metastatic cancer conditions across different cancer types .
out of these 239 genes , 141 were up - regulated and 98 down - regulated ( additional file 3 ) .
table 3 shows the 5 most significantly up - and down - regulated genes identified .
using the same fdr criterion , we also performed meta - analysis by meta - profile and meta - rankprod .
both cdep and meta - rankprod recovered the same two significant genes ( bsg and slc25a1 ) identified by meta - profile , and 180 genes were identified by both cdep and meta - rankprod ( meta - rankprod identified 2,967 significant genes. see additional file 1 , figure s7 for details ) .
a list of these genes identified by the three methods can be found in additional file 4 .
these results further support using cdep for meta - analysis to select candidate genes : meta - profile has insufficient statistical power , and meta - rankprod tends to have high false positive rates .
on the other hand , cdep has the advantages of maintaining statistical power and keeping low false positive rates for identifying genes that are differentially expressed consistently .
table 3 five most significant genes identified by cdep as related to common metastatic mechanism across different cancer types by using fdr < 0.05 as threshold up - regulated genes down - regulated genes glycoprotein ( transmembrane ) nmb ( gpnmb ) serpin peptidase inhibitor , clade b ( ovalbumin ) , member 5 ( serpinb5 ) secreted phosphoprotein 1 ( spp1 ) proteasome ( prosome , macropain ) subunit , beta type , 9 ( psmb9 ) transforming growth factor , beta - induced ( tgfbi ) myxovirus ( influenza virus ) resistance 1 , interferon - inducible protein p78 ( mx1 ) heat shock 27kda protein 1 ( hspb1 ) interferon - induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 ( ifit1 ) mesoderm specific transcript homolog ( mest ) ubiquitin d ( ubd ) the functional annotation of the 239 genes identified by cdep is consistent with previous findings that many of them are involved in cancer metastasis .
for instance , gpnmb overexpresses in a breast cancer cell line that could aggressively metastasize to bone [ 36 ] , and spp1 's expression level ( also called osteopontin ) is elevated in a variety of metastatic cancers [ 37 ] , including colon cancer [ 38 ] , hepatocellular carcinoma [ 39 ] , and gastric cancer [ 40 ] .
among the down - regulated genes , the expression level of serpinb5 is negatively associated with the depth of invasion , metastasis , and tnm stage in gastric cancer [ 41 ] .
interestingly , serpinb5 also inhibits invasion and metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer , which suggests its down - regulation could promote metastasis [ 42 ] .
mx1 was also predicted to have an inhibitory effect on tumor cell motility and invasion , an essential attribute for metastatic behavior .
while most of these previous findings are specific to different cancer types , analysis from cdep indicates that these genes could play important roles in metastatic mechanism common to all types of cancers .
the function of these 239 genes were further investigated by david [ 43 ] through gene set enrichment analysis , using all genes present in the microarray platform as background .
the results indicate that the up - regulated genes in metastatic cancer cells are enriched in extracellular matrix ( ecm ) receptor interaction , focal adhesion , and angiogenesis , while down - regulated genes are enriched in genes functioning in immune and inflammatory response ( table 4 ) , and these include laminin , fibronectin , collagen , multimerin , caveolin , etc. .
figure 5 shows the cdep identified genes mapped to the ecm receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways .
it is widely recognized that these pathways contribute to the aggressiveness and the metastatic behavior of cancer cells [ 44 ] .

figure 5 cdep identified differentially expressed genes map to biological pathways relevant to cancer metastasis .
a ) ecm - receptor interaction pathway .
b ) focal adhesion pathway .
up - regulated genes are annotated with red color , and down - regulated genes are in green .
not only had cdep identified genes known to be involved in cancer metastasis , but also it discovered novel genes that have not been implicated in metastatic mechanism .
for example , amigo2 , a gene identified as differentially expressed by only cdep out of the three meta - analysis approaches , is involved in anti - apoptosis [ 45 ] and cell adhesion [ 46 ] , and cdep shows that this gene is up - regulated under metastases conditions .
gem is also differentially expressed consistently in metastatic cancer cells , even though no current literature indicates its role in metastasis .
however , the gene interacts with microtubule network [ 47 ] and regulates actin dynamics [ 48 ] .
such activities are highly related to the migratory and invasive properties of cancer metastasis [ 49 ] .
another gene , cxcl11 , was shown to be consistently down - regulated by cdep analysis .
given that this gene has angiostatic property [ 50 ] , our results suggest that its down - regulation in metastatic cancer might interrupt the angiostasis process and promote angiogenesis - - an important aspect of cancer metastasis .
discussion meta - analysis provides a cost - efficient way to approach biological problems .
however , the heterogeneous nature of the data is always a significant challenge .
cdep aims to overcome this hurdle to identify genes that have a common differential expression pattern across different datasets .
we illustrated that cdep can : ( i ) obtain higher statistical power than existing meta - analysis approaches while maintaining low type i error rate in the simulation study , and ( ii ) identify genes that are potentially involved in common metastatic behaviors and relevant biological pathways .
cdep borrows information from each dataset to identify genes differentially expressed consistently - - a flexible approach that can be generalized to problems other than metastasis .
the high statistical power under diverse sets of parameters considered in the simulation study also suggests robustness of cdep to the diversity of data sources .
in cdep , the minus log likelihood q for different fdr values ( l ) was used because cdep does not intend to " filter out " genes in each dataset before performing meta - analysis .
this is in contrast to meta - profile where genes that only met the threshold ( l ) in each dataset were used for the meta - analysis .
in cdep , we emphasized low l values to calculate el and thus employed a linearly decreasing pdf for the log likelihood to : 1 ) balance the " filtering " behavior that would result from a convex decreasing pdf ; and 2 ) emphasize small l. the pdf used in cdep outperformed meta - profile and meta - rankprod in obtaining high statistical power and lowering type i error rate .
cdep , meta - profile , and meta - rankprod use different permutation approaches to estimate fdrg .
meta - rankprod permutes gene expression values relative to the gene id for each array while meta - profile and cdep permute fdr relative to gene id for each dataset examined .
the null distribution produced by meta - rankprod permutation would lead to rpg representing genes that are non - differentially expressed in any dataset , while meta - profile and cdep would simply increase the proportion of genes that are differentially expressed in only a single dataset after permutation .
therefore , meta - rankprod tends to under - estimate fdrg , as it ignores genes that are only differentially expressed in a single dataset .
on the other hand , meta - profile and cdep would over - estimate fdrg because they have a higher proportion of gc genes in the null distribution compared to meta - rankprod .
even though inaccurate estimation of fdrg is inevitable due to the lack of prior knowledge about the proportion of genes only differentially expressed in one versus multiple datasets , both cdep and meta - profile employed a more conserved approach than meta - rankprod to obtain high precision .
conclusion cdep is a flexible meta - analysis approach that borrows information from each dataset in order to identify genes that are consistently differentially expressed .
cdep obtains higher statistical power than two existing approaches under a variety of scenarios considered in the simulation study , suggesting its robustness and insensitivity to data variation. by application to metastatic cancer datasets as a case study , cdep allows identification of genes differentially expressed consistently in different types of metastatic cancer cells .
these identified genes could be further developed into universal biomarkers for cancer staging and diagnosis .
methods microarray data we searched the published microarray datasets comparing primary and metastatic cancer samples from the ncbi gene expression omnibus ( geo ) database ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / gds /) .
to ensure high quality , the included datasets and the associated publications needed to have clear descriptions about primary and metastatic cancer samples , and only single channel oligonucleotide array from affymetrix was considered .
in addition , we selected only datasets that provide raw data so we could apply the same pre - processing method for consistency .
since the goal of this study was to identify common genes across different cancer types , only one dataset from each cancer type was used to avoid biases .
if a cancer type had multiple datasets that met our criteria , the dataset with the most precise and detailed description of the samples was included .
simulation of microarray data we used simulation to evaluate the performance of cdep .
simulated data were generated to mimic the real experimental datasets retrieved .
specifically , the retrieved raw datasets listed in table 2 were pre - processed using the robust multichip average ( rma ) algorithm [ 35 ] to generate the summarized probe readings of the probesets in logarithmic values .
the resulting probesets were then matched to the corresponding ncbi entrez gene id using the annotations from affymetrix [ 51 ] .
because each gene will be matched to multiple probesets , the median expression value of these matched probesets was used for each gene .
overall , for each of the six different cancer types we selected , we generated a simulated dataset for meta - analysis .
each simulated dataset represented comparison of metastatic and primary cancer cells for the corresponding cancer type .
the simulation was done using a modified version of a model described in stevens and doerge [ 52 ] : ( 5 ) ygijk = mu + li + ggi + alphagi ( tgjk )( 1 )+ betagij ( mgijk )+ epsilongijk ( 2 )( 3 ) where ygijk is the expression value of gene g in experiment k conducted by laboratory i in cancer condition j ( j = 1 for metastatic ; j = 0 for primary ) , mu is the universal background reading , and li and ggi are the effects of laboratory i and gene g from laboratory i , respectively .
we also incorporated binary variables alphagj and betagij to distinguish genes that have common differential expression pattern from genes that are differentially expressed pertinent only to a specific dataset : differentially expression of gene g owing to the cancer - type specific effect is indicated by alphagj = 1 , and owing to the mechanism of the common metastatic behavior across different cancer types is indicated by betagij = 1 .
these indicators are used in the model to determine the contributions of cancer type specific and metastatic effects ( tgik and mgijk , respectively ) to the gene expression value .
the detail for the simulation model is as followed : mu = a1li ~ n ( 0,b2 ) ggi ~ n ( 0,b3i ) alphag1 ~ bern ( p ) betagi1 ~ bern ( q ) tgjk ~ n ( delta,psi ) , where delta != 0mgijk ~ n ( delta,psi ) , where delta != 0epsilongijk ~ n ( 0,ei ) in the simulation , we assumed that different datasets have different numbers of probesets and experiments .
in each dataset , genes selected to be involved in cancer - specific effect ( i.e. alphag1 = 1 ) were randomly assigned as up - or down - regulated to make such behavior dependent on dataset ( cancer type ) .
genes selected to be involved in the metastatic behavior common to all cancer type were also randomly assigned as up - or down - regulated genes to make it independent of dataset ( cancer type ) .
however , a gene could only be in at most one of these two categories , i.e. we required that alphag1 + betagi1 is contained in the set { 0 , 1 } .
the above simulation parameters were estimated from microarray datasets comparing primary versus metastatic cancer cells ( table 2 ) .
during simulation , we used different values for the proportion of cancer - type specific ( p ) and metastatic related differentially expressed genes ( q ) .
we also examined different cancer - specific and metastatic - related effects delta .
we then applied cdep to identify genes involved in metastatic behavior in this simulation study .
bayesian mixture model for p - value we used a mixture of beta distributions to model the p - values arising from the rankprod method .
because the p - values correspond to genes that are up - regulated , non - differentially expressed , or down - regulated , we used a 3 - component mixture model .
the p - value for gene g , yg , is represented as yg = sumk = 13tgkpk,where tg = ( tg1 , tg2 , tg3 ) ~ multinomial ( theta , 1 ) so that exactly one element of tg is one and the remaining elements are zero .
the value pk arises from the kth component of the mixture : pk ~ beta ( ak , bk ) , k = 1 , 2 , 3 .
we used a dirichlet prior for theta , theta ~ dir ( 1 , 18 , 1 ) and further assigned prior distributions as a1 = b3 = 1 ; a2 ~ gamma ( 4 , 2 ) ; a3 , b1 ~ gamma ( 400 , 20 ) , and b2 ~ gamma ( 1 , 1 ) , where the gamma ( alpha , beta ) is parameterized so that the mean is alpha / beta .
comparison with other approaches to assess the robustness of cdep , we compared it with meta - profile and meta - rankprod [ 14 - 16,21 ] .
meta - profile is one of the pioneering methods to investigate common cancer signatures at large scale .
this approach first identifies a dataset - specific " differential expression signature " - - a list of differentially expressed genes for each dataset determined by the pre - defined threshold of fdr ( l ) [ 5 ] .
the number of signatures each gene appeared in is then counted and permutation is performed to estimate the false positives of this count .
the meta - rankprod approach is a relatively recent approach that uses the rank product to identify genes differentially expressed between two conditions from multiple datasets .
in this method , the rank fold change , gammagih , is computed as the ranking of gene g in the hth comparison in the ith study , and the rank product for gene g was calculated as the geometric mean across all comparisons .
the null rank product was obtained by permuting expression values within each single array .
this method was shown to outperform both the parametric t - based modeling approach [ 53 ] and the fisher 's inverse chi - square approach [ 6 ] in terms of sensitivity and specificity .
cdep , meta - profile and meta - rankprod were applied to analyze the simulated datasets to evaluate their performances in terms of : i ) the statistical power to identify genes with common differential expression pattern across datasets ; and ii ) type i error rate of falsely identifying genes without common differential expression .
in this analysis , we tested the effect of different proportions of differentially expressed genes attributed to cancer - type specific ( p ) and metastatic - related ( q ) .
we also examined the effects of the detectable difference ( delta ) of differential expression .
for rankprod and cdep , genes absent from a dataset were assigned the median rank value of that dataset .

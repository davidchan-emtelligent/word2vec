background medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mtecs ) are characterized by ectopic expression of self - antigens during the establishment of central tolerance .
the autoimmune regulator ( aire ) , which is specifically expressed in mtecs , is responsible for the expression of a large repertoire of tissue - restricted antigens ( tras ) and plays a role in the development of mtecs .
however , aire - deficient mtecs still express tras .
moreover , a subset of mtecs , which are considered to be at a stage of terminal differentiation , exists in the aire - deficient thymus .
the phenotype of a specific cell type in a multicellular organism is governed by the epigenetic regulation system .
dna methylation modification is an important component of this system .
every cell or tissue type displays a dna methylation profile , consisting of tissue - dependent and differentially methylated regions ( t - dmrs ) , and this profile is involved in cell - type - specific genome usage .
the aim of this study was to examine the dna methylation profile of mtecs by using aire - deficient mtecs as a model .
results we identified the t - dmrs of mtecs ( mtec - t - dmrs ) via genome - wide dna methylation analysis of aire - / - mtecs by comparison with the liver , brain , thymus , and embryonic stem cells .
the hypomethylated mtec - t - dmrs in aire - / - mtecs were associated with mtec - specific genes , including aire , cd80 , and trp63 , as well as other genes involved in the rank signaling pathway .
while these mtec - t - dmrs were also hypomethylated in aire +/+ mtecs , they were hypermethylated in control thymic stromal cells .
we compared the pattern of dna methylation levels at a total of 55 mtec - t - dmrs and adjacent regions and found that the dna methylation status was similar for aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs but distinct from that of athymic cells and tissues .
conclusions these results indicate a unique dna methylation profile that is independent of aire in mtecs .
this profile is distinct from other cell types in the thymic microenvironment and is indicated to be involved in the differentiation of the mtec lineage .
medullary thymic epithelial cells aire t - dmr background medullary thymic epithelial cells ( mtecs ) are highly involved in the establishment of central tolerance by ectopically expressing a variety of tissue - restricted antigens ( tras ) [ 1 ] .
deficiency of the autoimmune regulator , aire - - which regulates a large pool of genes in mtecs - - results in autoimmune polyglandular syndrome in humans and autoimmunity in mice [ 2 ] .
there are estimated to be hundreds to over one thousand tras that are activated by aire in mtecs , based on microarray data from the transcriptomes of wild - type and aire - deficient mtecs [ 3,4 ] .
however , numerous tras are expressed in mature mtecs in an aire - independent pattern [ 3,4 ] .
moreover , single - cell pcr analysis with sorted mtecs demonstrated that approximately 70 % [ 5 ] , or even fewer [ 6 ] , of mature mtecs express aire , and tras are expressed in aire - negative mtecs [ 5 ] .
these findings indicate that aire is necessary , but not sufficient , for the expression of tras in mtecs .
the role of aire in the maturation of mtecs has been indicated by using aire - deficient mice , which exhibit contracted compartments in the thymic medulla and an increased number of medullary cells positive for p63 , whose expression is diminished in aire - positive mtecs [ 6 - 9 ] .
the role of aire in the differentiation of mtecs has been reviewed by matsumoto [ 10 ] .
however , the existence of the medullary compartment and the increased number of a small subset of k5 - k8 + cells - - considered to represent end - stage and terminally differentiated mtecs - - in the aire - deficient thymus indicate a limited role of aire in the lineage determination of mtecs , in which the rank signaling pathway is involved [ 11,12 ] .
thus , aire - deficient mtecs may represent a suitable model to study not only aire - independent tra expression but also the fundamental regulation system that governs cell lineage determination of mtecs .
genome - wide analysis of dna methylation has indicated that a specific dna methylation profile exists for every cell or tissue type .
this profile consists of numerous tissue - dependent and differentially methylated regions ( t - dmrs ) at cytosine residues in cpg dinucleotides ( cpgs ) , which are differentially methylated among distinct cells and tissues [ 13 ] .
dna methylation profiles change during cell differentiation , reflect developmental similarity among cell lineages [ 14,15 ] , and illuminate cell - or tissue - specific gene expression profiles [ 16 - 18 ] .
these findings suggest that dna methylation profiles are involved in the establishment and maintenance of the regulatory system for cell - or tissue - type - specific genome use , and could therefore be used to identify types of cells and tissues .
the dna methylation profile responsible for the phenotype of mtecs is still largely unknown , although a limited number of genes , including aire and 2 aire - independent tra genes , csn2 ( csnb ) and gad1 ( gad67 ) , are unmethylated in their promoter regions [ 19 - 21 ] .
to explore the genome - wide dna methylation of mtecs , we applied a microarray - based screening system , t - dmr profiling with restriction - tag - mediated amplification ( d - ream ) [ 16 ] , to uea1 + cd45 - mtecs that were isolated from aire - deficient ( aire - / - ) mice [ 22 ] .
we identified t - dmrs in mtecs ( mtec - t - dmrs ) and compared the dna methylation status at mtec - t - dmrs in aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs , uea1 - cd45 - thymic stromal cells , and athymic cell and tissues .
results and discussion mtec - t - dmrs identified in aire - / - mtecs are associated with mtec - specific genes thymic stromal cells from aire - / - mice and their aire +/+ littermates were fractioned into 2 populations : uea1 + cd45 - ( mtecs ) and uea1 - cd45 - ( control thymic stromal cells ) .
in this study , we use the term " stromal " to refer to uea1 - cd45 - cells , which are a mixture of keratin - expressing epithelial cells , including cortical tecs ( ctecs ) , and keratin - negative mesenchymal cells such as fibroblasts , connective tissue cells , and endothelial cells [ 23 ] .
predominant expression of aire , cd80 , krt5 , krt8 , krt14 , and foxn1 in the uea1 + cd45 - population ( detected by rt - pcr ) indicated enrichment of mtecs in this fraction ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
to elucidate the characteristics of genome - wide dna methylation in mtecs , we compared aire - / - mtecs with the liver , brain , thymus , and embryonic stem ( es ) cells by d - ream .
mtec - t - dmrs , which were differentially methylated as compared with the other cells and tissue types , were screened as genomic fragments that exhibited significantly different microarray scores after digestion by the methylation - sensitive restriction enzyme , hpych4iv ( additional file 2 : figure s2 ) .
among the mtechypo - t - dmrs , which were hypomethylated in aire - / - mtecs , we designated those that exhibited scores higher than all or any 2 of the reference cells and tissues as mtec - unique t - dmrs ( mtecu - t - dmrs ) or mtecany2 - t - dmrs , respectively ( figure 1a , additional file 3 : table s1 ) .
figure 1 mtecany2 - t - dmrs correlate with gene expression in mtecs and associate with marker genes of mtecs. a. hierarchical clustering of d - ream scores corresponding to mtecany2 - t - dmrs identified by comparison of aire - / - mtecs with the brain , thymus , liver , and es cells by pearson 's correlations .
among mtecany2 - t - dmrs , those hypomethylated in aire - / - mtecs in comparison with all of the reference cells and tissues were defined as mtecu - t - dmrs ( indicated by asterisk ) .

the arrowhead indicates the position of the mtecu - t - dmr .
the regions upstream ( - 674 to - 191 bp ) and downstream (+ 1672 to + 2082 bp ) of the tss were analyzed independently using bisulfite sequencing .
open and closed circles represent unmethylated and methylated cpgs , respectively .
positions of cpgs are shown as vertical bars above the genomic structure ( shown at the bottom of the panel ) , and the boxes indicate exons. d. cobra analysis of mtecu - t - dmrs associated with cd80 and trp63 .

hypomethylated fragments were resistant to hpych4iv digestion (+) .
the levels of dna methylation (%) are shown under each lane of the electropherograms .
the mtecany2 - t - dmrs mapped to within 8.5 - kb regions around the transcription start sites ( tsss ) of 3081 ensts ( ensembl transcripts ; mm9 ) ( additional file 3 : table s1 ) .
the distribution of mtecany2 - t - dmrs exhibited a similar pattern to that observed in previous analyses of somatic tissues and es cells [ 16,17 ] , displaying a peak of t - dmrs at the 3 ' - downstream regions of tsss ( additional file 4 : figure s3 ) .
hypomethylated signals in these regions are often associated with cell - and tissue - specific highly expressed genes [ 16,17 ] .
we analyzed the expression of ensts associated with mtecany2 - t - dmrs in mtecs using the gene expression profile of cdr1intb7 - 1hi cd45 - mtecs from the gene expression omnibus ( geo ) database , and compared with those of mouse liver , and cd4 + cd8 + thymocytes as a representative of the thymic cells ( additional file 5 : table s2 ) .
the differences in expression levels of genes associated with mtecany2 - t - dmrs were relatively small between aire - / - and aire +/+ mtecs as compared with those between mtecs and the liver or thymocytes , indicating that the expression patterns of genes associated with mtecany2 - t - dmrs in mtecs are not affected by functional aire ( additional file 6 : figure s4 ) .
high gene expression in mtecs was more prominent for genes associated with mtecany2 - t - dmrs in the - 1.5 kb upstream and + 2.5 kb downstream ( proximal ) regions of tsss .
among these genes , those associated with proximal mtecu - t - dmrs showed significantly higher expression in mtecs compared with both the liver and thymocytes ( figure 1b ) .
these data indicate that mtec - specific genes are likely to be associated with mtecu - t - dmrs , and methylation may be responsible for gene silencing in aire non - expressing tissues and cells .
indeed , we found that among the mtecu - t - dmr - associated genes , some had been previously reported as mtec - specific genes , of which the majority showed aire - independent expression in mtecs ( additional file 7 : table s3 ) .
moreover , marker genes of mtecs , including aire , cd80 , and trp63 , were found to be associated with proximal mtecu - t - dmrs .
we analyzed the dna methylation status around the mtecu - t - dmr of aire which is located downstream of its tss , and the upstream region by using bisulfite sequencing ( figure 1c ) .
in the - 624 to - 218 bp upstream region , the liver , which represents an aire non - expressing tissue , showed a methylated status comparable with aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs as well as with es cells , which express aire [ 24 ] .
the promoter regions of human aire ( - 295 to + 65 bp ) and mouse aire ( - 287 to + 133 bp ) are both associated with a cpg island (> 50 % cpg content ) and are unmethylated in mtecs [ 19,20 ] .
since aire - negative ctecs and several extrathymic tissues were also found to be unmethylated at this region [ 20 ] , hypomethylation of the promoter is considered to be necessary , but not sufficient , for expression .
in contrast , aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs , but not es cells , exhibited a hypomethylated status at the 9 cpgs in the region between + 2082 and + 1672 bp from the tss , including the cpg corresponding to the mtecu - t - dmr .
among the tissue - specific genes carrying cpg islands within 1 kb of their tsss , hypomethylated t - dmrs tend to be located downstream of tsss [ 16,17 ] .
thus , the mtec - tdmr for aire located 3 ' - downstream of the aire tss could serve as an epigenetic marker to distinguish mtecs from aire - expressing es cells , in which the expression level of aire was significantly less than that in the thymus and mtecs ( additional file 1 : figure s1 ) .
the mtecu - t - dmrs associated with cd80 and p63 ( trp63 ) were analyzed with combined bisulfite restriction analysis ( cobra ) .
both aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs exhibited a hypomethylated status compared with the liver , thymus , and es cells ( figure 1d ) .
notably , the mtecu - t - dmr of p63 was found to be associated with deltanp63 , the short isoform of p63 , which is essential for maintenance of the progenitor status of thymic epithelial cells [ 25 ] and not expressed in aire - positive mtecs [ 7 - 9 ] .
hypomethylation at this t - dmr in aire +/+ mtecs suggests that dna methylation does not determine the repression of p63 in aire +/+ mtec cells .
mtecany2 - t - dmrs are specific to mtecs , as compared with the other thymic stromal cells we compared the dna methylation levels of 15 selected genes - - which were shown to be associated with mtecany2 - t - dmrs - - between the mtecs and stromal cells from aire +/+ and aire - / - mice by cobra ( figure 2 ) .
in contrast to the hypomethylated status in mtecs , aire , cd80 , and trp63 were hypermethylated in stromal cells .
some genes that associated with mtecany2 - t - dmrs were found to be involved in the rank / rankl signaling pathway , which stimulates the downstream nf - kappab pathway and is required for the development of mtecs [ 11,12,26 ] ( additional file 8 : figure s5 ) .
for example , tnfrsf11a ( rank ) was hypomethylated in mtecs but hypermethylated in stromal cells .
traf2 , the gene downstream of rank , was hypomethylated not only in mtecs but also in the stroma , while its downstream genes , tank , birc2 , and edaradd demonstrated similar methylation patterns to tnfrsf11a .
we also found that h2 - dma ( h2 - dm ) , which exhibited 2 mtecu - t - dmrs surrounding its second exon - - a region essential for antigen presentation by mhcii [ 27 ] - - was hypomethylated in mtecs and hypermethylated in the remaining stromal cells .
in addition to these genes , similar methylation patterns were observed at mtecany2 - t - dmrs associated with genes exhibiting tissue - specific expression patterns , such as aplp2 ( adipose tissue and brain ) , arg1 ( liver ) , ctla4 ( treg ) , ehhadh ( kidney and liver ) , mtap7 ( lens ) , and slc36a3 ( testis ) .
importantly , these methylation patterns were observed in both aire - / - and aire +/+ mtecs , demonstrating that a dna methylation pattern distinct from other thymic stromal cells is maintained in aire +/+ mtecs .

the levels of dna methylation at cpgs within the hpych4iv site are indicated by the vertical axis .
for aire and cd80 genes - - containing 2 hpych4iv sites inside the investigated region - - the dna methylation rate was calculated when any 1 of the cpgs was methylated .
for the remaining genes , the levels represent dna methylation levels at a single cpg .
bar graphs indicate means +/ - standard errors of the data from at least 3 independent bisulfite pcrs using independently isolated cells from 3 aire +/+ mice and 3 aire - / - mice .
aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs show similar dna methylation levels at mtec - t - dmrs to further compare the dna methylation status between aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs , we used cobra to analyze 55 loci , including mtec - t - dmrs and hpych4iv sites in the vicinity and some previously identified t - dmrs of other cell and tissue types [ 16,17 ] ( figure 3 , additional file 9 : table s4 ) .
hierarchical clustering of dna methylation levels at these mtec - t - dmrs showed that aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs display the most similar pattern ( less than 20 % difference in dna methylation ) compared with the liver , thymus , and es cells .
dna methylation levels at mtechypo - t - dmrs in both mtecs showed a unique or common hypomethylated status compared with the reference cell and tissues ( figure 3 , upper panel ) , as revealed by d - ream analysis ( figure 1a ) .
genes associated with t - dmrs characteristic of other cell and tissues were hypermethylated in mtecs ( figure 3. lower panel ) .
these data indicate that the presence of aire does not greatly change dna methylation levels in mtecs .
figure 3 aire +/+ andaire - / - mtecs show similar dna methylation profiles .

dna methylation levels from 0 % to 100 % are represented as the continuous gradation from white to black .
each row represents a different gene associated with t - dmrs .
among the analyzed genes , fgg ( fibrinogen gamma chain ) , which is a liver - specific gene that is expressed in mtecs in an aire - dependent pattern [ 3,4 ] , was hypermethylated in both aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs , similar to its status in es cells and the thymus .
the gene expression of tras in mtecs occurs in specific subpopulations and in a stochastic manner [ 1,2 ] ; therefore , dna methylation changes may occur at specific loci in an aire - dependent manner in subpopulations of mtecs that express a specific tra .
during thymic organogenesis , aire is expressed at e16.5 [ 28 ] , while the stromal cells of the medulla and cortex are separated at embryonic day 13 ( e13 ) [ 29 ] .
in the absence of aire , mtecs survive aire - induced apoptosis , reach a terminally differentiated stage [ 10 ] , and maintain the ability to express tras [ 3,4 ] .
thus , the similar dna methylation status at t - dmrs in aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs suggests the existence of an aire - independent dna methylation profile that serves as an intrinsic system to determine the phenotype of mtecs .
conclusions in this study , we demonstrated the dna methylation profile for aire - / - mtecs by genome - wide identification of t - dmrs .
the dna methylation status at dozens of mtec - t - dmrs in aire +/+ mtecs was similar to that in aire - / - mtecs , while distinct from athymic cells and tissues as well as the other thymic stromal cells , indicating that the aire - independent dna methylation profile is involved in differentiation of the mtec lineage and other thymic stroma cells that form the thymic microenvironment .
methods mice aire +/ - mice ( b6.129s2 - airetm1.1doi / j ) were obtained from the jackson laboratory [ 22 ] and backcrossed onto c57bl / 6j ( b6 ) mice ( oriental yeast , japan ) .
aire - / - mice and their aire +/+ littermates were used for isolation of mtecs .
the mice were housed and bred under specific pathogen - free conditions .
all experiments using mice were carried out according to the institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals ( graduate school of agricultural and life sciences , the university of tokyo ) .
isolation of mtecs the isolation of mtecs was conducted by modifying previously described methods [ 16,30 ] .
briefly , thymi were collected from 6 - to 7 - week - old male mice , finely minced , washed in rpmi 1640 medium , and sequentially digested twice with 0.2 mg / ml collagenase d for 15 min at 37degreesc .
the pellets were incubated with 0.2 mg / ml collagenase d and 0.2 mg / ml dispase i ( roche applied science ) with 25 mug / ml dnase i ( takara ) , and the reaction was stopped with 5 mm edta .
subsequently , after centrifugation at 1350 x g on a percoll gradient , supernatants between rho = 1.06 g / ml and rho = 1.0 g / ml were incubated with mouse bd fc block ( 2.4g2 ) , pe rat anti - mouse cd45 ( 30 - f11 ) ( bd pharmingen ) , and fitc - conjugated uea - 1 ( sigma ) and sorted using an epics altra flow cytometer ( beckman - coulter ) .
the fractionation of cells was monitored by rt - pcr ( additional file 10 ) .
d - ream analysis in d - ream analysis , differential methylation status at hpych4iv loci is indicated by differential scores corresponding to fragments generated by this methylation - sensitive restriction enzyme between 2 samples [ 16 ; additional file 2 : figure s2 ] .
in the present study , we performed microarray experiments using mtecs from aire - / - mice and the thymus from c57bl / 6j mice .
briefly , after digestion of genomic dna with hpych4iv ( new england biolabs ) , 50 ng of dna was ligated with an adaptor , followed by taqi digestion and ligation with a second adaptor .
the fragments were amplified by ligation - mediated pcr to allow selective amplification of unmethylated fragments generated by hpych4iv digestion and then hybridized using the genechip mouse promoter 1.0r array ( affymetrix ) , which comprises probes that map to the regions ( - 6 to + 2.5 kb ) around the tsss of approximately 50,000 transcripts ( enst ids ; mm9 ) obtained from the ucsc genome browser .
hybridization signals were processed with mat [ 31 ] and can be found at array express ( http :// www.ebi.ac.uk / arrayexpress / ; accession number : e - mtab - 1113 ) .
the data from aire - / - mtecs and the thymus were compared with d - ream data from the liver , brain , and es cells [ 17 ] to identify fragments that exhibited a difference in microarray scores , thereby indicating the dna methylation status at corresponding hpych4iv sites .
we set the cut - off value at 0.5 % of fdr ( false detecting rates ) for t - dmrs .
the galaxy genome browser ( https :// main.g2.bx.psu.edu /) [ 32 ] and " r " ( http :// www.r - project.org ) [ 33 ] were used for genomic fragment analysis .
to analyze the gene expression of aire +/+ and aire - / - mtecs , we obtained their gene expression profiles from the geo database ( http :// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / geo /) [ 34 ] and compared with those of the liver and cd4 + cd8 + thymocytes on the same microarray platform ( additional file 5 : table s2 ) .
the array data were normalized using the gcrma package [ 35 ] .
the enst ids were converted into affymetrix ids by using biomart software ( http :// www.biomart.org ) [ 36 ] .
dna methylation analysis with bisulfite - converted genomic dna mtec cells and gdnas from the thymus , liver , and es cells were subjected to bisulfite treatment using the ez dna methylation - direct kit ( zymo research cooperation ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
unmethylated cytosine residues are converted into thymine residues by the sodium bisulfite reaction , while methylated cytosine residues remain unchanged .
pcr was carried out using the bisulfite - converted genomic dna with the primers listed in additional file 11 : table s5 .
to evaluate the dna methylation status at specific cpgs , cobra was performed .
the pcr products were evenly divided and incubated with or without hpych4iv for 5 h at 37degreesc and then analyzed with a microchip electrophoresis system ( multina , shimadzu biotech ) .
dna methylation levels were calculated as the percentage of digested fragment compared with the sum of digested and undigested fragments .
to evaluate the dna methylation status at cpgs within hundreds of base pairs , the pcr fragments were cloned into the pgem - t easy vector ( promega ) , and more than 10 clones were sequenced using an abi 3130 sequencer with a bigdye terminator kit ( applied biosystems ) .

d - ream was developed via integration of a methylation - sensitive restriction enzyme ( hpych4iv ) , ligation - mediated pcr ( lm - pcr ) , and dna tiling microarrays [ 3,4 ] .
briefly , for a certain genomic locus that contains a hpych4iv recognizing site ( acgt ) , in sample a , the acgt containing 5 ' - methylcytosine cannot be digested by hpych4iv and the corresponding fragment is not amplified by lm - pcr , thus does not detected by microarray .
in contrast , in sample b , the acgt with unmethylated cytocine is digested and the corresponding fragment is efficiently amplified , leading to microarray signal , reflected by d - ream score .
comparing the two samples using the d - ream score , the locus is defined as a t - dmr and hypomethylated in sample b .

tnfrsf11a ( rank ) and its down - stream genes traf2 and lyn were associated with mtecany2 - t - dmrs and traf5 was associated with mtecu - t - dmr .
tank ( tank ) , ciap2 ( birc2 ) and crinkled ( edaradd ) , which were recruited by traf2 to activate the downstream nf - kappab [ 9 - 11 ] .
stimulation by rank leads to activation of stat1 which in turn up - regulates ifn - stimulated gene expression in mtecs [ 12 ] .
stat1 and jak1 were found to be associated with mtecu - t - dmr and mtecany2 - t - dmr , respectively .

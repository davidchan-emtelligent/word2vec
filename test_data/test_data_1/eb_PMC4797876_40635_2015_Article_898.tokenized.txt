evidence suggests that changes in the serum sodium level on admission to the intensive care unit ( icu ) , may lead to a poor outcome .
objectives the objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of apache ii and serum sodium levels to predict mortality of surgical critically ill patients .
methods one hundred and ninety - five surgical patients ( 62 % males and 38 % females ; mean age of 51.8 +/ - 17.3 years ) admitted to the icu in the post - operative phase were retrospectively studied .
the patients were divided into survivors ( n = 152 ) and nonsurvivors ( n = 43 ) .
apache ii , and serum sodium levels at admission , 48 - h and discharge were recorded .
the capability of each index ( apache ii , sodium - admission , sodium 48 - h and sodium - discharge ) to predict mortality of surgical patients was analysed by receiver - operator characteristic curves ( roc ) .
odds ratios ( or ) and 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) for hyponatremia ( na < 136 mmol / l ) and hypernatremia ( na > 144 mmol / l ) were calculated .
results comparison of data between survivors and nonsurvivors is summarized in table 1 .
the mean apache ii was 16.3 +/ - 8.3 ( 13.6 +/ - 6.1 for survivors and 25.5 +/ - 8.5 nonsurvivors ) .
the area under the roc curve for apache ii was 0.841 ( 0.782 - 0.889 ) and 0.721 ( 0.653 - 0.783 ) , 0.754 ( 0.687 - 0.812 ) , 0.720 ( 0.651 - 0.782 ) for serum sodium level at admission , 48 - h and discharge , respectively. or for hyponatremia and hypernatremia were 5.33 ( 1.77 - 16.08 ) and 0.25 ( 0.1 - 0.65 ) .
the comparisons of roc curves for these indexes are depicted in figure 1 .

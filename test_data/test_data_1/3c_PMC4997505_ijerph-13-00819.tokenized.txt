background : this study aimed to identify the association between occupational stress and depression - well - being by proposing a comprehensive and flexible job burden - capital model with its corresponding hypotheses .
methods : for this research , 1618 valid samples were gathered from the electronic manufacturing service industry in hunan province , china ; self - rated questionnaires were administered to participants for data collection after obtaining their written consent .
the proposed model was fitted and tested through structural equation model analysis .
results : single - factor correlation analysis results indicated that coefficients between all items and dimensions had statistical significance .
the final model demonstrated satisfactory global goodness of fit ( cmin / df = 5.37 , agfi = 0.915 , nnfi = 0.945 , ifi = 0.952 , rmsea = 0.052 ) .
both the measurement and structural models showed acceptable path loadings .
job burden and capital were directly associated with depression and well - being or indirectly related to them through personality .
multi - group structural equation model analyses indicated general applicability of the proposed model to basic features of such a population .
gender , marriage and education led to differences in the relation between occupational stress and health outcomes .
conclusions : the job burden - capital model of occupational stress - depression and well - being was found to be more systematic and comprehensive than previous models .
occupational stress job burden - - capital model structural equation model depression well - being 1 .
introduction with further industrialization and modernization , increasing occupational psychological problems have gained attention from all social sectors .
indeed , occupational stress can lead to negative conditions such as exhaustion [ 1 ] and depression [ 2 ] and might seriously damage the occupational population 's work ability , social function and status of well - being [ 3,4 ] .
meanwhile , depression has become one of the most common psychological disorders worldwide .
the world health organization ( who ) ranked it as the fourth cause of disability , but predicted it to increase to second place by 2020 .
in china , depression has been ranked as the second highest burden of medical expenses [ 5 ] .
now , the occupational population is the basis of social and economic development , and maintaining their safety and health is an important factor for social progress [ 6 ] .
depression affects people 's ability to work , possibly leading to low production efficiency and even disability .
in contrast , well - being is another important guarantee for their safe and efficient work .
thus , discovering the role of occupational stress in maintaining well - being and development of depression has been the focus in occupational health studies .
some studies have shown that occupational stress influences depression and well - being through various working conditions , i.e. , effort - reward imbalance is closely associated with depression ; job demands ( e.g. , high work pressure , emotional needs , role ambiguity ) might lead to sleep disorders [ 7 ] , anhedonia [ 8 ] , and so on , which serve as the main component of depression .
well - being and protective factors , specifically , social support [ 9 ] , self - esteem [ 10 ] and autonomy [ 11 ] might alleviate occupational factors' negative effects through increasing employee learning opportunities [ 12,13 ] and improving a sense of integration in the work [ 14 ] .
at present , most research on this topic has been conducted on health hazards and thereby achieved great success [ 11,12,13 ] .
however , to predict and evaluate occupational stress and its outcomes , most studies are based on occupational stressors , or , in recent years [ 12,15,16,17 ] , they have used two internationally recognized models , i.e. , the job demands - control ( jdc ) model [ 15 ] and the effort - reward imbalance ( eri ) model [ 16 ] .
these two models' simple structure and content have become the greatest advantage for their application , and they have been widely used in the study of occupational stress for the past 30 years .
however , this simplicity also results in prediction or evaluation bias for occupational stress and its outcomes .
the models focus on two important parts of occupational stress that have been respectively taken as the theoretical basis of its prediction and evaluation .
however , in the face of the occupational population 's growing complexity and occupational characteristics , these evaluation results might , to some extent , not reflect the current occupational population 's panorama of occupational stress [ 12 ] , leading to uncertain correlations with health outcomes .
in other words , stress evaluation by jdc or eri models alone might miss certain populations' stressed status .
for example , the eri questionnaire cannot accurately assess psychological demands on visual display terminal operators , thus potentially drawing biassed conclusions on occupational stresses' prevalence .
many works based on the two models have shown many inconsistent results , and job complexity leads , possibly , to producing one - sided evaluation results through application of the two single models [ 18,19 ] .
also , many studies have questioned how systematic the two models actually are [ 20 ] .
for deeper understanding of the jdc and eri , many studies have conducted research on occupational stress by using the jdc and eri simultaneously to solve occupational stress problems under more comprehensive and systematic conditions .
obviously , however , one issue cannot be avoided even by using these two models simultaneously : their evaluation systems are independent .
in addition , they were initially designed to evaluate occupational stress from independent angles , and confounding their dimensions or items without a theoretical basis is inadvisable .
although simultaneous jdc and eri usage can measure stress factors from different perspectives , it is difficult to explain them according to one comprehensive index in a common framework , especially for laypeople .
thus , simultaneous usage maintains just the role of simultaneousness .
to compensate for this drawback and for extensive research on occupational stress , we require development of a theoretical platform .
in fact , some scholars have already noticed the issue and made efforts to resolve it. in 2003 , bakker et al .
[ 20 ] proposed the " job demand - resource model " .
this model attempted reforms in the working condition of job demands and introduced " job resource " as the dimension interactive with " job demand " .
subsequent literature has shown this model 's practicability and applicability [ 12 ] .
as a model recently gaining more and more attention , the job demand - resource model also indicates that measurement of psychological working conditions needs to be comprehensive .
otherwise , it might lead to biassed assessment .
however , after reviewing the literature regarding the demand - resource model , we have found that only some of the model 's scales / items are selected from occupational stress - related measurement tools , while items' specificity to stress measurement remains to be discussed .
at the same time , we found that various studies have selected different scales for establishing the demand - resource model 's framework , scales not even familiar in the study of occupational stress .
in an article on the relationship between the job demand - resource model and burnout , bakker himself also indicated that the model 's scales have been selected from heterogeneous scales without the assessment of their reliability and validity .
therefore , we believe that the demand - resource model might have disadvantages in the specificity of measuring occupational stress. by considering these issues , and for developing a model that fits the chinese social and cultural background , we propose the " job burden - capital model " on the basis of the widely used jdc and eri in china for predicting and evaluating the occupational population 's health outcomes ( depression and well - being ) .
the model 's basic theory supposes that when the job burden - capital does not match , since the occupational population 's job burden goes beyond the capital owned , risk of depression increases .
additionally , regulation of personal characteristics affects the extent and speed of depression 's development .
" job burden " mainly refers to those psychological , physical , organizational , social and personal job factors that require enhanced or transitory physical and / or psychological diathesis or capability and lead to daily costs physiologically and / or psychologically .
for example , the work environment , task intensity , psychological burden , skill requirements and so on probably increase risk of depression .
when the occupational staff 's available work capital is certain , high job burden might directly increase risk for and development of depression [ 21 ] .
it might also reduce their well - being and work efficiency [ 22 ] .
" capital " refers to those psychological , physical , organizational , social and personal factors that can function to address the requirement of job burden , fulfil job tasks , alleviate depressed feelings [ 12 ] , increase sense of accomplishment and improve individuals' ability .
examples are high personal job skills , job autonomy , fair treatment , future development , work stability , work identity , sense of respect , income and social support .
enough capital is an important guarantee of occupational groups fulfilling occupational tasks ; capital is directly related to their well - being [ 23 ] .
in addition , employees' depression and well - being might also be regulated by differences in individual personality [ 24 ] , especially by the trait of inability to withdraw from obligations at work [ 25,26,27 ] .
for example , people who are too concerned about work might be more sensitive to the reaction of depression than others .
job burden and capital should be matched in professional life to ensure the staff 's completion of assignments and their well - being and satisfaction .
the present study explores a more comprehensive and systematic association between occupational stress and depression or well - being by proposing the innovative model of job burden - capital .
three hypotheses are to be confirmed : ( 1 ) job burden and capital directly relate to employees' depression and well - being ; ( 2 ) personality can mediate the relationship between job burden - capital and related health outcomes ; ( 3 ) for occupational groups , the theoretical model has general applicability among populations with different characteristics , and this buffers effects on the model 's association of variables .
2. experimental section 2.1 .
population and investigation process this cross - sectional study recruited staff of the electronic manufacturing service industry in hunan province , china , as participants .
before the field survey , the chinese center for disease control and prevention organized the study group , united with the provincial prevention and treatment center of occupational disease , communicated with companies to be surveyed , and informed them of the investigation 's purpose and significance .
upon consent of the local unit , we conducted on - site mobilization .
formal investigation was officially conducted from june 2015 to july 2015 .
investigators with unified training conducted the field survey , and participants completed the questionnaire on the spot , with recovery after the audit .
inclusion criteria for investigation participants were as follows : ( 1 ) participants had worked continuously for 6 months or more in the position ; ( 2 ) there was no history of mental illness and no history of psychotropic drug use for one week before the investigation ; ( 3 ) there was no long - term sick - leave history ; ( 4 ) participants completed on - site mobilization and voluntarily participated in the survey upon informed consent .
the medical ethics committee of the institute of occupational health and poison control of the chinese center for disease control and prevention approved this study .
a total of 1800 questionnaires were issued , 1618 questionnaires were recovered - - an effective recovery rate of 89.9 % .
participants were 835 males ( 51.6 %) and 783 females ( 48.4 %) ; their average age was 28.84 +/ - 6.37 years , and the distribution was uniform .
proportions of the 25 - year - old age group , the 26 - 30 age group and the group aged above 30 were 34.7 % , 31.7 % and 33.6 % , respectively .
as for marital status , 981 people ( 60.6 %) were married .
the level of education was relatively low as a whole ; 441 ( 27.3 %) people had a junior high school education degree , and 809 ( 50.0 %) had a high school / secondary school education degree .
working on an assembly line were 768 people ( 47.5 %) , 479 were not on an assembly line ( 29.6 %) , and 371 worked in logistical and administrative posts ( 22.9 %) .
2.2 .
hypotheses and construction of job burden - capital matching model 2.2.1 .
measurement method of each model dimension the core hypothesis of job burden - capital is that the occupational population 's occupational characteristics , the operational environment and organization and management factors jointly influence occurrence and development of occupational stress , which can be attributed to two working conditions , job burden and capital .
job burden was specifically divided into workload and psychological demands .
capital covers six dimensions : job autonomy ( e.g. , decision autonomy , independent arrangement ) , job skills ( e.g. , skills learning , skills improvement ) , social support ( e.g. , peer support , supervisor support ) , work feedback ( e.g. , sense of respect , fair treatment , identity , income ) , work stability and development prospects .
in addition , personal characteristics might regulate the degree of occupational stress , so the dimension of individual personality was regarded as a mediating dimension .
the model diagram can be seen in figure 1 .
measurement of all factor items was based on chinese versions of the job content questionnaire [ 28 ] and the effort - reward imbalance questionnaire [ 29 ] ; the most representative items consistent with the model 's hypothesis and china 's social background were selected .
assessment scales of two chinese versions of occupational stress developed and optimized by li jian in 2004 have wide application in the study of occupational stress in china [ 30 ] .
except for some items , such as sense of monotony , which are not in line with the current chinese economic situation and the model 's hypothesis , or which are redundant , the main dimensions remain to be assessed .
moreover , qualitative interviews and pre - surveys have been conducted before the development of measuring items , and items that were not adapted to the cultural context have been modified .
thus , the language context is more in line with speaking habits and the traditional thinking mode of the chinese .
all items adopt five levels of likert ratings ( 1 = completely disagree to 5 = completely agree ) ; this unified rating strategy made ratings more consistent and thus ensures data 's consistency and meaningfulness .
2.2.2 .
job burden workload : workload is based on effort dimensions of effort - reward imbalance model that covers six items , and the measurement and evaluation involves time urgency , work disruption , work responsibility , work overtime , physical demands and increasing job requirements , such as " due to the heavy work load , i always feel that i do n't have enough time " .
psychological demand : the psychological demand is based on the emotional job demand dimension of the job content questionnaire [ 31 ] that covers four items : sense of responsibility , sense of making efforts , sense of urgency and so on , for instance , " i feel it was very fast - paced , and i am unable to stop for a rest " .
2.2.3 .
capital autonomy : two items were measured , namely , degree of autonomy as in " what to do " and " how to do it " .
they are " i have the freedom to decide how to work " and " i have the freedom to decide what work to do " , respectively .
skills : three aspects were measured , the level of work skills , skills improvement and learning or creativity , for instance , " i can integrate my creativity into my work " .
social support : the most representative questions on family support , support of colleagues or leadership in the social support dimension in the jcq scale were selected , for example , " i obtain support from my colleagues at work " and " i get along well with my supervisor " .
feedback : the items of the " reward " dimension in the eri scale were selected , including respect , fairness , recognition , income and so on ; six items were measured , for instance , " my income and my effort or performance does not match " .
work stability : two items for measurement were selected : " my work stability is poor " and " there are unnecessary changes to my work " .
work prospect : two items for measurement were selected : " my promotion prospects are not promising " and " my work prospects are not consistent with my efforts " .
2.2.4 .
personality the measurement of personality is based on " over - commitment " in the effort - reward imbalance scale , which is described as a " personality trait mainly characterized by the inability to withdraw from work obligations " [ 32 ] .
the dimension covers three items on work - related content of personality : easily overwhelmed by time pressure , work still in mind before going to sleep ( trouble being " laid - back ") , and postponing working demands .
a specific question includes " i begin to think about work as soon as i get up in the morning " .
2.2.5 .
depression the patient health questionnaire ( phq ) is a self - administered version of the diagnostic instrument for common mental disorders .
the phq - 9 [ 33 ] which is the 9 - item depression module from the full phq is used for evaluation of depression among the study population .
the phq - 9 score ranges from 0 to 27 , since each of the nine items can be scored from 0 ( not at all ) to 3 ( nearly every day ) .
the scale has been confirmed to have high reliability and validity [ 33 ] .
2.2.6 .
well - being the study population 's well - being is assessed by who - five well - being scale ( who - 5 ) .
five statements presented ( i have felt cheerful and in good spirits ; i have felt calm and relaxed ; i have felt active and vigorous ; i have felt fresh and rested ; my daily life has been filled with things that interest me ) were assessed on a six - point scale ( from never to always ) , with the possible total score varying from 0 to 25 .
higher scores indicate better well - being [ 34 ] .
2.2.7 .
statistical processing first , we introduced cronbach 's alpha to test the internal consistency reliability of the selected items , in order to explore the suitability of including the research variables in the model .
second , pearson 's test of correlation analysis was conducted to explore relationships between working conditions and health outcomes ; for inspection of the model of job burden - capital and health outcome , the structural equation model was adopted to conduct confirmatory factor analysis to test the theoretical framework within the data collected .
for goodness - of - fit , the adjustment fitting goodness indicator ( agfi ) , non - normalised fit index ( nnfi ) , incremental fit indicator ( ifi ) and root mean square error of approximation ( rmsea ) were employed .
references show that the model fit coefficient is > 0.9 , and rmsea < 0.08 [ 35 ] , which can be accepted as good fit .
according to the figure 1 model diagram , this study divided working conditions into two latent variables as a whole , namely , job burden and capital , and evaluated the two measured variables of work load and psychological demands after centralization ; individual personality was included in the model as an internal adjustment variable .
to explore association effects of personality characteristics in the relationship between working conditions and health outcomes ( depression and well - being ) , we conducted an analysis of the mediating effect of the structural equation model [ 36 ] .
the bootstrap statistical method was used , and the sampling number was set as 5000 , according to hayes [ 37 ] , taking the bias correction interval as the confidence interval of mediating effect [ 37 ] .
epidata 3.1 (" the epidata association " , odense , denmark ) was used for data entry , and spss statistics 19.0 and spss amos 21.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) were used for statistical analysis ; alpha takes 0.05 with two tails .
2.3 .
ethics review and approval the study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of the national institute of occupational health and poison control ( code no. 201502 ) .
all participants signed written informed consents .
3. results 3.1 .
analysis of correlation and internal consistency single - factor correlation analysis shows that the correlation coefficients of the three dimensions of job burden , capital and personality are of statistical significance , - 0.495 , 0.513 or - 0.415 , respectively .
coefficients of job burden , capital or personality and depression are 0.366 , - 0.506 or 0.325 respectively with statistical significance , and the coefficients of the three aspects above and well - being are also statistically significant ( - 0.451 , 0.516 and - 0.419 , respectively ) .
the correlation between depression and well - being is - 0.450 ( p < 0.05 ) .
each of the three dimensions significantly correlated with their sub - items .
for example , the relevant coefficients of job burden and workload , and psychological demands are 0.874 and 0.867 , respectively .
correlations of sub - items of the three dimensions of job burden , capital and personality also have statistical significance ( see table 1 for details ) .
in addition , results of the internal consistency test shows that cronbach 's alpha is between 0.750 and 0.943 .
among these , the capital dimension has the highest reliability ( 0.943 ) , the sub - item of job prospects ( 0.750 ) and the sub - entry of work stability have the lowest ( 0.754 ) , and the internal consistency of remaining dimensions or sub - items are all above 0.8 , thus reaching a high level ( see table 1 for details ) .
3.2 .
goodness of model fit after verifying that the selected items and dimensions have correlation and internal item consistency meets the requirements of model fit , we used the structural equation model to conduct data fitting and optimization for model hypotheses ; and finally , we verified whether the hypotheses have been established .
first , we conducted analysis of the structural equation model to the two basic dimensions of job burden - capital model .
results show that the goodness - of - fit of the modified model is acceptable , compared with the original model ( cmin / df = 5.18 , agfi = 0.971 , nnfi = 0.984 , ifi = 0.992 , rmsea = 0.051 ) , which all reach standards of goodness - of - fit indices .
after adding the personality dimension into m2 , the model also achieves high global goodness - of - fit .
on the basis of m2 , we added the latent variable of depression as the common outcome variable of three dimensions , and the interactive path among three dimensions was not added .
the shows the model 's goodness - of - fit is poor even after modification ( cmin / df = 14.16 , agfi = 0.836 , nnfi = 0.849 , ifi = 0.871 , rmsea = 0.090 ) .
similarly , when three dimensions are added to the one - way path of well - being , the goodness - of - fit is unacceptable .
then , we added corresponding paths between three dimensions on the basis of m3 , and the result shows that the goodness - of - fit reaches a higher level ( cmin / df = 6.37 , agfi = 0.919 , nnfi = 0.938 , ifi = 0.948 , rmsea = 0.058 ) .
m6 showed similar results .
in m7 , we combined m5 and m6 , i.e. , depression and well - being were included into the model simultaneously with the corresponding paths between the three dimensions at the same time .
then the modified model 's goodness - of - fit reaches a high degree ( cmin / df = 5.72 , agfi = 0.910 , nnfi = 0.940 , ifi = 0.948 , rmsea = 0.054 ) .
in the final m8 model , we further added the correlation path of depression and well - being , so the final model has the most satisfactory goodness - of - fit ( cmin / df = 5.37 , agfi = 0.915 , nnfi = 0.945 , ifi = 0.952 , rmsea = 0.052 ) , and the coefficients of each path are each statistically significant ( see table 2 for details ) .
3.3 .
path coefficient of structural equation model the final fitted model shows a high degree of goodness of fit to the occupational population of the electronic manufacturing industry .
the paths of measurement model has acceptable loadings , among which the standardized regression weight of suicide ideation to depression is 0.48 at minimum , and the loadings of other measurement paths are all above 0.50 .
the correlation coefficient between the latent variable job burden and capital is - 0.68 .
the standardized regression weights from latent variable burden to depression and well - being are 0.19 and - 0.18 , respectively ; i.e. , once job burden increases by a unit , depression increases by 0.19 units , and well - being decreases by 0.17 units .
similarly , the standardized path loadings between capital and the two aspects are - 0.34 and 0.31 , respectively. with increase of capital , depression decreased gradually , and well - being increased gradually .
in the personality characteristics , the susceptibility of job stress , ergasiomania and the characteristics of thinking of work all the time increase occupational pressure and reduce overall work satisfaction .
the relationship between depression and well - being is negative , and the standardized covariance is - 0.29 ( see figure 1 ) .
3.4 .
multi - group structural equation model analyses to explore different structural associations of individual characteristics , we used the hierarchical method of structural equation modelling .
we adopted the method of nested model comparisons to discuss influences of different characteristics on the model 's goodness of fit ; then we analysed the model 's path coefficients according to different characteristics .
we constrained the path between the three latent variables and depression and well - being .
results of nested model comparisons show that gender , age , education level and marital status have no significant influence on model fit .
the position variable , as test results of the hierarchical model , show that the model difference is of statistical significance ( p = 0.033 ) , but changes in agfi , nnfi , ifi , rmsea , and other parameters are slight , significantly less than 0.05 .
in general , results are quite comparable with those for the total sample .
however , there are some differences regarding factor loadings of specific working conditions and personality on latent factors for each group .
for example , for the variable of gender , the female group has significant loading ( 0.27 ) from burden to depression , while the male group shows significant loading ( 0.14 ) from personality to depression .
additionally , variables of marriage and education show different associations in burden to depression and well - being .
position buffers the personality 's effects ( see table 3 ) .
3.5 .
the structural model 's direct and indirect effects to further confirm study hypotheses 1 and 2 and to explore the relationship between jbc and health outcomes , we conducted mediating effect analysis of the structural equation model .
results show that the direct effect of job burden on depression and well - being are 0.19 ( 0.09 - 0.29 ) and - 0.18 ( - 0.29 - - 0.09 ) , respectively , and the indirect effects were 0.06 ( 0.02 - 0.10 ) and - 0.11 ( - 0.16 - - 0.07 ) through personality .
similarly , direct effect of capital to depression and well - being are - 0.34 ( - 0.42 - - 0.26 ) and 0.31 ( 0.23 - 0.38 ) , respectively .
the indirect effect through the individual personality is - 0.02 ( - 0.03 - - 0.01 ) and 0.03 ( 0.01 - 0.06 ) respectively .
at the same time , the personality also directly affects depression and well - being .
it can mediate the relationship between the two dimensions of job burden and capital and health outcomes ( see table 4 ) .
4. discussion generally speaking , the job burden - capital model is the reform of mainstream models .
it avoids some of limitations of the jdc model or the eri model .
the jdc or the eri model focuses on limited aspects of work - related stressors , and this might initially lead to ignorance of the impact on the occupational population 's health by other working conditions [ 20 ] .
however , the burden - capital model , in terms of job burden , integrates occupational psychological demands and workload , making the assessment of extrinsic risking conditions more comprehensive than the " job demands " of the jdc model. that is , the working condition of job burden can be reflected more comprehensively in terms of stressors during work , thus expanding the scope of application to the occupational population .
similarly , in respect to the extrinsic stress protective factor - - job capital , sense of control at work ( e.g. , job skills , autonomy ) , social support and social exchange ( e.g. , respect , fairness , identity , income ) are included .
in turn , this reflects , under a particular job burden level , the impact on occupational stress and even health damage 's occurrence or development by job capital .
notably also , compared with the job demand - resource model , the job burden - capital model has identified that the occupational population 's individual personalities are also an important intrinsic factor in occupational stress 's occurrence or development .
the role of personality in the relationships of psychological working conditions and health outcomes ( depression or well - being ) has been simultaneously verified. by reviewing theoretical models of occupational stress ( e.g. , job demand - control - social support model , effort - reward imbalance model ) , job burden - capital - personality model of occupational stress summarizes specific working conditions as follows : the dimension of job burden that increases risk of depression and reduces well - being , and the dimension of capital that reduces risk of depression and improves well - being .
individual characteristics play an intermediary role in the relationship between working conditions and health outcomes .
the latent variable of job burden is mainly measured based on the following : workload and psychological demands , such as over tasking , time pressure and complex operations , which might directly or indirectly increase risk of occupational stress' occurrence and development ; capital , which mainly includes job autonomy , skills , social support , feedback , job stability and job prospects , such as personal job skills , job autonomy , fair treatment , future development , work stability , sense of identity , respect sense , income and social support ; dimension of personality that mainly involves the three typical characteristics of overwhelmed , laid - back , and postponing .
analysis of sub - items' internal consistency reliability show that selected variables or dimensions have good internal consistency .
hypothesis 1 proposed that job burden and capital can be directly associated with depression and well - being .
correlation and sem analyses show that job burden positively correlates to depression , in other words , a higher burden is directly associated with greater depression and lower well - being .
similarly , increased capital significantly relates to risk of depression and increased well - being , which has negatively correlates with job burden [ 31 ] .
moreover , job burden and capital could also indirectly affect depression and well - being through personality .
indirect effects alter in different variables , of which job burden has stronger indirect effects than job capital .
in other words , job burden influences personal characteristics more to affect occupational outcomes indirectly .
hypothesis 2 proposed that the individual personality might mediate the relationship between job burden - capital and depression - well - being .
tarufeldt 's work indicates that participants with low over - commitment as a certain personal characteristic with a set of attitudes reflecting excessive striving combined with a strong desire for approval [ 38 ] tend to score higher in well - being [ 39 ] .
individual personality , such as exaggerating their efforts beyond levels or exposing high demands at work too often , might reduce potential to recover from job demands and increase susceptibility to frustration [ 40 ] .
in addition to direct influences on occupational outcomes , results show that individual personality could also mediate effects between job burden - capital and outcome of working status .
analysis of multi - group sem shows that the model has good applicability to different genders , ages , education levels , marital statuses and positions .
according to good applicability , we can detect these variables differentiated effects .
results show that gender , marriage and education load significantly different coefficients of the path from job burden to depression , indicating that such variables act as adjusting roles for the association between these two aspects .
in other words , single male employees with a low educational level might weaken health effects of depression caused by a job burden .
similarly , we found that the male gender is also a risk factor for depression by personality , and a single employee shows fewer preventive effects with decreasing burden .
the next deduction might be obtained through comparison of job burden and capital 's direct effect on outcome. that is , capital has a more obvious effect on depression and well - being ; this result is similar to some existing research .
in both the jdc model and the demand - resource model , job demands' impacts on job strain could be buffered by job control / resources [ 12,41 ] .
additionally , the jdc neglected control 's role in affecting occupational outcomes until bakker indicated that job resources are not only essential for dealing with job demands , but they have influencing effects in their own right as well [ 12 ] .
in other words , job capitals either play an intrinsic motivational role because they promote employees' growth , learning and development or play an extrinsic motivational role because they are helpful in achieving work goals [ 12,42 ] .
this indicates that employees with adequate capitals for work tasks will probably be obtained and completed [ 43 ] , consistent with either previous stress theory or our model. that is to say , job burden , a major source of tension , might play a role in depression and well - being , while capital is necessary to adjust health outcomes , work efficiency or motivation .
furthermore , the correlation coefficient indicates interactive effects between them in development of occupational outcomes [ 43 ] .
in the job burden - capital model , psychological working conditions in different dimensions are now comparable ; that is , workload versus psychological demand , effort versus control or social support can be compared and explained within a unified index under a common framework .
results of the measurement model by structural equation analysis have also tested this conclusion : the loading of each measurement dimension in the job burden - capital model is greater than 0.50 , i.e. , the contribution of corresponding stress factors to psychological working conditions is quite even , and thus comparable .
this provides a reliable research platform for further exploring psychological working conditions' impact on health .
based on this platform , this article has measured the extrinsic stress factor - - job burden - - and the extrinsic protection factor - - job capital .
thus , it clarified the relationship between burden / capital and depression / health. that is , an increase in either psychological needs or working task requirements of job burden might directly damage health , while increase in capital might have protective effects on health. from another point of view , the result reflects the model 's flexibility in use .
more specifically in the present study , different dimensions of stress have different roles in depression and health status , helping healthcare workers or enterprise managers identify populations at high risk of depression ; for example , single male employees with low educational levels might weaken the health effects of depression caused by job burden .
the application of the jbc model in stress study might deepen our understanding of depression 's health damage and help distinguish different stress characteristics among different occupational populations .
in the future , this model can be used to investigate occupational stress and its health impacts on a broader occupational scope and to explore its reliability and validity in different occupational groups .
at the same time , it will be meaningful to improve the model 's measurement indicator system continuously and to ameliorate the theoretical framework for comprehensive reflection of work - related stress among occupational populations .
moreover , the model is helpful in detecting modifiable conditions such as skill , social support or even personality related to work , which employers could promote through professional training and culture construction .
thus , practical evidence for health intervention under the job burden - capital model must be illustrated in future studies , and the model 's reliability and validity remain to be further investigated before application in other language contexts .
5. limitations the jbc model emphasizes working conditions ( i.e. , job burden and capitals in evaluating depression and well - being ) .
measurement of these dimensions is mainly based on existing scales or targeted self - rated questions .
thus , which measurement could be consistent with the theory 's hypotheses is limited .
however , these findings are clearly in line with previous studies and theories , and the related analyses have also shown high reliability of items .
this study 's second limitation is its basis on self - report questionnaires , which might lead to subjective bias in the data .
nevertheless , our findings' consistency with the theory , together with the acceptable sample size , suggests that common - method bias is not a major drawback of our study .
moreover , because of study samples' limited availability , we collected information only from employees of the electronic manufacturing service industry in hunan province , possibly restricting our results' generalizability .
lastly , the causal relationship between study variables ( psychological working conditions and depression or well - being ) cannot be evaluated with a cross - sectional design .
therefore , the theoretical model should be gradually revised , and psychological working conditions' causal effects on health outcomes should be verified by future confirmatory studies .
6. conclusions this study focuses on development of a more systematic and comprehensive occupational stress - health outcomes model. through analysis of structural equation model , mediation effects analysis and other statistical procedures , the following hypotheses have been tested : 1 .
job burden and capital are directly associated with depression and well - being ; 2 .
personality can mediate the relationship among job burden , capital , depression and well - being ; 3 .
for occupational groups , the theoretical model has general applicability among populations with different characteristics .
gender , marriage and education influence the association of model variables .
thus , the model provides more comprehensive insight into the relationship between occupational stress and its corresponding health outcomes .

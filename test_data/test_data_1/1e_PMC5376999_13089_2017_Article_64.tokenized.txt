background ultrasound - guided peripheral intravenous access may present an alternative to central or intraosseous access in patients with difficult peripheral veins .
using venepuncture of a phantom model as a proxy , we investigated whether novice ultrasound users should adopt a cross - sectional or longitudinal approach when learning to access peripheral veins under ultrasound guidance .
this result would inform the development of a structured training method for this procedure .
methods we conducted a randomised controlled trial of 30 medical students .
subjects received 35 min of training , then attempted to aspirate 1 ml of synthetic blood from a deep vein in a training model under ultrasound guidance .
subjects attempted both the cross - sectional and longitudinal approaches .
group 1 used cross - sectional first , followed by longitudinal .
group 2 used longitudinal first , then cross - sectional .
we measured the time from first puncture of the model 's skin to aspiration of fluid , and the number of attempts required .
subjects also reported difficulty ratings for each approach .
paired sample t - tests were used for statistical analysis .
results the mean number of attempts was 1.13 using the cross - sectional approach , compared with 1.30 using the longitudinal approach ( p = 0.17 ) .
mean time to aspiration of fluid was 45.1 s using the cross - sectional approach and 52.8 s using the longitudinal approach ( p = 0.43 ) .
the mean difficulty score out of 10 was 3.97 for the cross - sectional approach and 3.93 for the longitudinal approach ( p = 0.95 ) .
conclusions we found no significant difference in effectiveness between the cross - sectional and longitudinal approaches to ultrasound - guided venepuncture when performed on a model .
we believe that both approaches should be included when teaching ultrasound - guided peripheral vascular access .
to confirm which approach would be best in clinical practice , we advocate future testing of both approaches on patients .

keywords ultrasound ultrasound education venepuncture emergency medicine emergency ultrasound ultrasound guided issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background achieving intravenous ( iv ) access is one of the most common , and most important , clinical skills used in hospital medicine .
in the majority of patients , such vascular access is provided by a peripheral intravenous ( piv ) cannula .
traditionally , piv access is achieved by a landmark - and - palpation approach ; however , locating a suitable vein by this method is not always straightforward .
finding and accessing a peripheral vessel in patients with a history of iv drug abuse , severe obesity or chronic medical problems can be impossible using the landmark - and - palpation approach alone .
failure rates for this skill range from 9 to 56 % [ 1 ] .
the alternative in such cases is commonly a central line insertion .
while effective , central venous access is not without risks and is often inappropriate for patients requiring only a short duration of iv treatment .
catheter - related sepsis , arterial puncture , pneumothorax and arrhythmias are all recognised complications of central venous access , and can cause significant morbidity and mortality for these patients [ 2 ] .
the increasing portability of ultrasound machines has led to a surge in the availability of point - of - care ultrasound ( pocus ) in the hospital environment .
ultrasound - guided central venous access is now considered the standard of care , improving both success rates and reducing complications such as arterial puncture [ 3 ] .
it has been suggested that the use of ultrasound to guide the cannulation of the deep brachial or basilic veins in patients with difficult peripheral access may improve success rates and , ultimately , patient outcomes [ 4 , 5 ] .
ultrasound - guided peripheral vascular access is a safe alternative to central line placement and could be used instead in up to 85 % of patients classified as having difficult iv access [ 6 ] .
training students and staff to locate and access deep peripheral veins under ultrasound guidance may therefore lead to fewer central line placements and , consequently , a reduced incidence of central line - related complications .
there are two commonly used approaches for ultrasound - guided piv access : the cross - sectional approach ( short - axis or out - of - plane approach ) and the longitudinal approach ( long - axis or in - plane approach ) .
previous studies have shown that it is possible to teach this skill to novice ultrasound users effectively , using a single 30 - min didactic training session [ 7 , 8 ] .
it is unclear as to whether novices find it easier to learn and effectively perform the cross - sectional approach or the longitudinal approach , and there is no consensus which approach should be taught .
we devised this trial to identify which approach ( or approaches ) ought to be taught to novices and to help inform the development of a structured learning package .
we chose to conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial using medical students in order to answer this question .
it has been demonstrated that previously ultrasound - naive medical students are able to use ultrasound to guide peripheral vascular access on real patients after a single training session [ 9 ] .
it has also been demonstrated that simulation - based training using a dedicated ultrasound phantom can lead to improved levels of skill when applied to real clinical practice [ 10 ] .
however , we appreciate that we did not follow up phantom training with testing on patients .
as such , we advocate testing with patients in future .
as we were testing the efficacy of novices , we used phantom models to simulate patients .
due to the construction of these phantom models , cannula lines tended to kink when inserted ; thus , failure reflected the model limitations rather than the skill of the novice .
to overcome this , we instead aimed for venepuncture , with the students required to aspirate 1 ml of fluid .
this gave the benefit of requiring the students to correctly identify , locate and puncture the vein , while removing any failure bias due to the firm material of the model .
we feel that as the main purpose of ultrasound guidance is to aid in locating and puncturing the vein , venepuncture acted as an adequate proxy for peripheral venous access .
methods study design we conducted a prospective randomised controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of the cross - sectional and longitudinal approaches to ultrasound - guided peripheral venepuncture when employed by novice ultrasound users .
the study was reviewed and approved by the cambridge psychology research ethics committee .
all subjects gave written , informed consent before taking part in the study .
study setting and population we recruited a convenience sample of 30 senior medical students at cambridge university .
six sessions were held over the course of 2 weeks .
there were five places available per session , and students were free to choose which session they attended .
none of the students had used ultrasound to guide vascular access or venepuncture prior to this study .
nine of the 30 students reported having previously handled an ultrasound machine .
all 30 of the students reported having at least some ultrasound teaching in the past .
study protocol each subject was randomly assigned to either the ' cross - sectional first ' group ( n = 14 ) or the ' longitudinal first ' group ( n = 16 ) prior to attending a session .
this randomisation was performed according to the table generated by ' research randomizer ' , an online random assignment programme [ 11 ] .
at each session , the group of five students was given a 30 - min structured didactic teaching session in the form of an oral presentation .
all teaching sessions were delivered by the same individual and covered : the value of ultrasound guidance in patients with difficult peripheral access ; the basic physics behind ultrasound ; operation of the portable ultrasound machine ; interpretation of the image ; a tutorial on how to use ultrasound to guide peripheral venepuncture .
both the cross - sectional and longitudinal approaches were covered during this teaching session , and each approach was given equal coverage .
a video walkthrough at the end of the presentation covered both approaches to the technique .
after the teaching presentation , all subjects were given an opportunity to practise using a toshiba viamo portable ultrasound machine to scan the blood vessels in the upper limbs of a human model .
subjects were taught how to operate the machine , and how to discriminate arteries from veins .
each subject was allowed 5 min practice with the machine and was asked to practise visualising vessels in both cross - sectional and longitudinal planes .
subjects were allowed to observe one another during this practice opportunity .
subjects then underwent the study alone with the study coordinator .
they were asked to use a 21 - gauge needle and syringe to aspirate 1 ml of synthetic blood from a blue phantom ( kirkland , wa , usa ) ultrasound training model under ultrasound guidance ( additional file 1 ) .
subjects randomised to the ' cross - sectional first ' group were required to use only the cross - sectional approach at this stage ( additional file 2 ) .
likewise , the subjects randomised to the ' longitudinal first ' group were required to use only the longitudinal approach for this task ( additional file 3 ) .
after succeeding , each subject was given a new needle and required to aspirate another 1 ml of synthetic blood from the model , this time using the approach that they had not tried previously .
this crossover study design was employed to control for the effect of practice on performance .
measures the time that elapsed from first puncture of the model 's skin to successful aspiration of 1 ml of synthetic blood into the syringe was measured .
also recorded was the number of attempts required successful aspiration i.e. the total number of times the needle passed through the model 's skin before aspiration of fluid .
after attempting both approaches , subjects were asked to rate the difficulty of each approach using a pair of 11 - point visual analogue scales ( figs. 1 and 2 ). fig. 1 11 - point visual analogue scale to assess and quantify how difficult subjects found the task of aspirating 1 ml of synthetic blood using the cross - sectional approach fig. 2 11 - point visual analogue scale to assess and quantify how difficult subjects found the task of aspirating 1 ml of synthetic blood using the longitudinal approach data analysis paired sample t - tests with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % ci ) were used for the statistical analysis .
data were analysed using ibm spss statistics 21 ( ibm corp. , armonk , ny , usa ) [ 12 ] .
three separate paired sample t - tests were used to compare the cross - sectional and longitudinal approaches in terms of mean time required ; mean number of attempts required ; mean difficulty rating .
students were said to have ' failed ' if more than three minutes had elapsed between first pass of the needle and aspiration of the fluid , or if three or more attempts were required .
students exceeding three needle passes were assigned the maximum value of three attempts , and students exceeding 3 min were assigned the maximum value of 180 s. this was decided on in advance , and was done for the purpose of statistical analysis in order to prevent excessive skewing of results by outliers .
results the data for all 30 subjects were analysed .
no student was excluded from the data analysis .
the mean time from first puncture of the model 's skin to successful aspiration using the cross - sectional approach was 45.1 s ( 95 % ci 29.4 to 0.9 s ) .
the mean time required using the longitudinal approach was 52.8 s ( 95 % ci 36.7 to 69.0 ) .
performing a paired samples t test , we found that the difference of 7.7 s ( 95 % ci - 12.1 to 27.4 ) was not statistically significant ( p = 0.43 ) .
the mean number of skin punctures required using the cross - sectional approach was 1.13 ( 95 % ci 0.94 to 1.32 ) .
the mean number of skin punctures required with the longitudinal approach was 1.30 ( 95 % ci 1.08 to 1.52 ) .
paired sample t - tests demonstrated that this difference of 0.17 skin punctures ( 95 % ci - 0.08 to 0.41 ) was not statistically significant ( p = 0.17 ) .
the mean perceived difficulty score reported for the cross - sectional approach was 3.97 out of 10 ( 95 % ci 3.10 to 4.83 ) .
the mean perceived difficulty for the longitudinal approach was 3.93 out of 10 ( 95 % ci 3.21 to 4.65 ) .
the difference in mean perceived difficulty of 0.04 out of 10 ( 95 % ci - 0.95 to 1.01 ) was not statistically significant ( p = 0.95 ) .
all the results are summarised in table 1 .

error bars represent the 95 % confidence limits of the means discussion since the first emergency department observational study of the use of ultrasound to establish peripheral vascular access in 1999 , [ 5 ] the availability of both ultrasound equipment and the ultrasound expertise of emergency physicians has expanded considerably .
in many emergency departments , ultrasound is being increasingly utilised to obtain piv access in patients where attempts using the traditional landmark - and - palpation technique have failed [ 2 ] .
ultrasound - guided piv cannulation is also being utilised in other settings such as intensive care units [ 13 ] .
use of ultrasound provides a very real alternative to more invasive approaches such as central venous access , [ 6 , 13 ] external jugular vein , [ 14 ] venous cutdown or intraosseous access .
in addition , ultrasound - guided piv cannulation has been shown not to pose a significant infection risk [ 15 ]. with regard to the efficacy of ultrasound - guided piv cannulation over a traditional landmark - and - palpation technique , the literature is conflicting .
whist constantino found that ultrasound was more successful than traditional techniques [ 16 ] , not all the literature is positive .
several studies have failed to show any advantage of ultrasound - guided peripheral vascular access over a traditional technique [ 17 , 18 ] .
a study in children under 10 years also failed to show any statistical advantage of ultrasound over a traditional approach [ 19 ] .
although ultrasound - guided piv cannulation has not been shown to be better than traditional techniques in all patients , there is evidence to support its use in difficult patients or where traditional techniques have failed .
the international evidence - based recommendations on ultrasound - guided vascular access from 2013 recommended that , " use of ultrasound should be taken into consideration for any kind of peripheral intravenous line when difficult access is anticipated " [ 20 ] .
they also recommend the use of the longitudinal approach but accept that it is more challenging than the cross - sectional approach .
the longitudinal approach may be safer by allowing better needle tip visualization and thereby minimising posterior wall puncture [ 8 ]. with ultrasound - guided central venous access , it can be difficult to distinguish between the vein and the artery in longitudinal view , with a greater risk of arterial puncture with the longitudinal approach .
the cross - sectional approach allows identification of not just the vessel to be punctured ( the vein ) but also the vessel to be avoided ( the artery ) .
this visualisation of both vessels is lost with a longitudinal approach .
there is currently no consensus as to whether a longitudinal or a cross - sectional approach is superior .
in a single study mahler showed that the cross - sectional approach was slightly faster , but failed to demonstrate any further benefit over the longitudinal approach [ 21 ] .
how to teach ultrasound - guided piv cannulation is less well covered in the literature .
after a short training package , perceived difficulty of obtaining peripheral vascular access was reduced in a cohort of emergency nurses [ 4 ] .
a study involving utilisation of ultrasound to aid piv access learning by medical students using just the short - axis approach showed no difference in terms of obtaining piv access , but the ultrasound group did perceive the experience as easier and felt they had gained more knowledge of the mechanics of placing an iv cannula [ 9 ] .
there has been some focus on how best to teach this skill and also which approach is best ( cross - sectional versus longitudinal ) .
blaivas et al .
[ 7 ] found a clear superiority of the cross - sectional approach over the longitudinal approach in terms of time taken from placing the ultrasound probe and needle to successful vascular access .
interestingly , our study generated some quite different results , and failed to show a difference despite our sample size being almost twice that used by blaivas and colleagues .
( 30 subjects , compared to 17 subjects ) .
our study has a number of limitations that should be acknowledged .
firstly , our subjects were required to access simulated vessels in an ultrasound phantom , as opposed to the real vessels in a living human patient .
the task of aspirating fluid from a model under ultrasound guidance is undoubtedly easier than taking real blood from a patient , as our subjects did not have to attend to the model 's concerns or discomfort during the procedure .
additionally , the deep peripheral veins in real patients are unlikely to be as straight as the vessels in our inanimate phantom .
acquiring and maintaining an adequate longitudinal view of a tortuous vein in a real patient is likely to be considerably more difficult than obtaining a good longitudinal view in our model .
as such it is difficult to extrapolate our findings to clinical practice , and this study does not provide evidence of benefit of one approach over the other in clinical practice .
the findings are limited to the training of novices using a phantom model .
it should also be noted that our study measured only whether our subjects could achieve venepuncture , while in reality the insertion of a piv cannula requires an additional step in which the catheter is inserted into the vessel following venepuncture .
we appreciate that venepuncture does not include all the difficulties of cannulation , for example , confirmation of patency and the increased risk of puncturing of the posterior wall .
however , as the purpose of ultrasound is to guide the user in locating the vessel rather than the technique of cannulation , we considered it an adequate proxy .
this study has demonstrated that , in novice ultrasound users , neither the longitudinal nor transverse approach showed a clear superiority when ultrasound - guided venepuncture was attempted in a model .
more research is needed to definitively answer the question of whether the cross - sectional or longitudinal approach is more effective when teaching this skill to novice ultrasound users .
future researchers may wish to have subjects attempt the technique on human subjects to produce results that translate clearly to real clinical practice .
however , considering the clear benefits of peripheral venous access ( as demonstrated in other studies ) , the most pertinent point may be to increase teaching of ultrasound - guided peripheral venous access in general , regardless of approach [ 2 , 3 ] .
until such times as this question is resolved , we believe that both the longitudinal and cross - sectional approaches have value , and that both techniques should be included when developing a training programme to teach this useful clinical skill .

cavernous hemangiomas of the gastrointestinal tract are quite rare and , until now , have been difficult to diagnose preoperatively due their nonspecific presentations and imaging features , as well as a lack of histologic description pertaining to small superficial biopsies such as those obtained endoscopically .
we report a unique case of a 4 cm transmural cavernous hemangioma in the terminal ileum with literature review and describe a new histologic finding - - the " endothelialized muscularis mucosae ," which was discovered upon review of the endoscopic biopsy and could potentially facilitate preoperative diagnosis of these lesions from endoscopic biopsies in the future .
these lesions have classically required surgical resection in order to make a definitive diagnosis and rule out malignancy , with which they share many historical and radiographic features .
due to their potential to cause bowel obstruction , intussusception , perforation , and hemorrhage , these lesions may ultimately require surgical resection to relieve symptoms or prevent or treat complications - - however , surgical planning and patient counseling could be greatly improved by a preoperative diagnosis .
therefore , gastroenterologists , pathologists , and surgeons should be aware of the " endothelialized muscularis mucosae " which can be very helpful in diagnosing gi cavernous hemangiomas from endoscopic biopsies .
1. introduction cavernous hemangiomas of the gastrointestinal tract are quite rare and , until now , difficult to diagnose preoperatively [ 1 ] due to a dearth of specific histologic description pertaining to small superficial biopsies such as those obtained endoscopically [ 2 , 3 ] .
we report a unique case of a 4 cm transmural cavernous hemangioma in the terminal ileum with literature review and describe a new histologic finding - - the " endothelialized muscularis mucosae ," which was discovered upon review of the endoscopic biopsy and could potentially facilitate preoperative diagnosis of these lesions from endoscopic biopsies in the future .
2. case description the patient was a 20 - year - old female who presented to the emergency department with a progressive 2 - week history of diffuse intermittent abdominal pain , which was aching at rest and sharp upon movement .
it was accompanied by nausea for the past two days , with one episode of vomiting .
she denied recent changes in her stool but reported passing stool only once per week for the past few years .
the patient also reported a 2 - year history of vasovagal syncope , with an increase in presyncopal episodes during the 2 - week course of her abdominal pain .
these episodes were sometimes associated with heart palpitations , shortness of breath , and chest pain , which had previously been diagnosed as anxiety and gastroesophageal reflux disease .
the history was otherwise noncontributory .
the patient 's vital signs were unremarkable and she was afebrile .
there were no masses or tenderness upon abdominal palpation .
initial labs were within normal limits , and screening tests were negative for pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections .
a computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast was notable for a 4.7 cm mass involving the wall of the terminal ileum , with speckled calcifications , adjacent lymphadenopathy , and a small amount of dense fluid in the pelvis ( figure 1 ) .
no hepatic abnormalities were visualized .
colonoscopy demonstrated a 4 - 5 cm friable mass in the terminal ileum ( figure 2 ) , and multiple biopsies of this area were taken .
the biopsies were originally described as unremarkable small bowel mucosa with preserved villous architecture .
the patient subsequently underwent laparoscopic evaluation and resection of the mass .
upon entry into the abdomen , a small amount of blood was noted to be pooled in dependent locations within the abdomen and pelvis .
at the terminal ileum , a soft , maroon , cystic , friable mass associated with scant bleeding and a tortuous , dilated blood supply was noted ( figure 3 ) .
a laparoscopic ileocecectomy was completed without any perioperative complications .
the resected specimen was composed of an 11 cm segment of terminal ileum and 4 cm portion of cecum ( figure 4 ) .
gross examination revealed a 4 x 3.5 x 3 cm dark red , spongy mass at the terminal ileum that involved all layers of the small bowel and extended into the attached adipose tissue .
upon opening the bowel , a large amount of blood was noted within the lumen of the terminal ileum .
the corresponding mucosal surface of the lesion was seeping fluid blood into the lumen .
histologic examination showed dilated vascular spaces , filled with blood and lined by a layer of flat , benign - appearing endothelial cells .
the walls of the vascular channels were composed of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue ( figure 5 ) .
calcifications and calcified phleboliths were observed in the wall and lumen of the vascular lesion .
the diagnosis of a cavernous hemangioma was rendered .
review of the original biopsy revealed a second layer of fibromuscular tissue apposed to the muscularis mucosae of the small bowel mucosa .
on the antiluminal side of the intestinal lumen , this second layer of fibromuscular tissue was lined by a layer of flat endothelial cells ( figure 6 ) .
immunohistochemical studies with the endothelial markers cd31 and cd34 highlighted the layer of endothelial cells lining one side of the second fibromuscular layer ( figure 7 ) .
3. discussion intestinal hemangiomas are very rare , with multiple histologic variations accounting for a combined incidence of only 0.05 % of all gastrointestinal tract ( gi ) tumors [ 3 ] .
they are more likely to be found in the jejunum [ 4 ] , in contrast with most other gi tumors , only 3 - 6 % of which reside in the small bowel [ 1 ] .
a literature search for cavernous hemangiomas of the terminal ileum revealed only one prior case , which described a 5 cm cavernous hemangioma that was associated with perforation located near the origin of an ileocecal intussusception [ 3 ] .
small bowel tumors pose several diagnostic challenges , beginning with their nonspecific symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and distension , which could be more easily explained by many prevalent physiologic gi issues .
additionally , many are asymptomatic until later stages .
therefore they are often discovered either incidentally , or after a wide - ranging work - up and a significant delay since the onset of symptoms [ 1 ] .
late stage small bowel tumors may present suddenly , with acute intestinal obstruction or frank gi bleeding [ 1 , 5 - 7 ] , or insidiously , with subacute partial obstruction or chronic anemia secondary to occult gi bleeding [ 1 , 8 , 9 ] .
lesions involving the terminal ileum , such as in our case , may be more likely to present with obstructive symptoms , due to their impediment of this region 's intestinal wall motility which is crucial to propulsion of contents through the ileocecal valve [ 10 ] .
our patient 's dilated terminal ileum and pattern of passing stool only once per week suggest chronic subacute obstruction , likely due to impaired peristalsis at the terminal ileum .
her presenting symptoms of abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting indicate progression towards a more acute obstruction .
compared to other small bowel tumors , cavernous hemangiomas are more often symptomatic and more likely to present with anemia or bleeding , rarely even causing massive hemorrhaging [ 4 , 6 , 11 ]. with transmural lesions such as in our case , bleeding may occur not only intraluminally but also intra - abdominally [ 6 ] .
in our patient , the blood noted in the abdominal cavity had likely been causing her sharp abdominal pain secondary to peritoneal irritation .
intestinal hemangiomas have also been associated with complications such as intussusception and perforation [ 3 , 11 ] , or platelet sequestration leading to thrombocytopenia [ 4 ] .
in some cases , these complications can be life threatening .
nonspecific features on imaging and limitations in visualization pose additional challenges to preoperative diagnosis of small bowel tumors .
patients who present with abdominal pain or obstructive symptoms are often evaluated by computed tomography ( ct ) , which has a poor detection rate for small bowel tumors and is unlikely to visualize most cavernous hemangiomas [ 1 , 12 ] .
for lesions large enough to visualize , a ct scan can help determine the presence , size , and extension into nearby structures [ 7 ] but is usually unhelpful at differentiating the type of lesion [ 1 ] .
a large cavernous hemangioma may be seen on ct scan as intestinal wall thickening which is persistently enhancing with iv contrast , or which may infiltrate nearby structures such as mesentery or abdominal wall .
these features can be misleading and may cause a cavernous hemangioma to be mistaken for a more common tumor such as lymphoma [ 8 ] .
ct scans can also demonstrate calcifications such as phleboliths , which occur due to vascular thrombosis within the tumor 's dilated varicosities [ 4 , 11 , 12 ] .
patients who present with recurrent anemia or gi bleeding due to these lesions are often evaluated by traditional endoscopy , which is unable to reach most of the small bowel , or by capsule endoscopy [ 1 ] .
when they are visualized on endoscopy , features of a cavernous hemangioma may include a purple or blue color , a nodular gross appearance , and hypervascularity , possibly with friability or visible bleeding [ 7 , 8 , 12 ] .
adjacent features may include mucosal congestion and submucosal dilated varicosities [ 3 , 12 ] .
other diagnostic modalities , such as radionucleotide imaging or angiography showing hypervascularity , or barium studies demonstrating a nodular luminal defect which is compressible upon air insufflation , may help localize the lesion but cannot render a specific diagnosis [ 11 , 12 ] .
little has been written in the literature on the histologic findings in biopsies of cavernous hemangiomas of the gastrointestinal tract .
accordingly , even lesions accessible for biopsy have evaded diagnosis due to inconclusive findings [ 2 ] , and cavernous hemangiomas have almost exclusively required surgical resection for a definitive diagnosis [ 1 , 12 ] .
however , upon review of the original endoscopic biopsy in this case , we observed a second layer of fibromuscular tissue which was tightly apposed to the muscularis mucosae of the small bowel mucosa , with a layer of flat endothelial cells lining the antiluminal side of the second fibromuscular layer .
since duplication of the muscularis mucosae can occur in chronic diseases of the gi tract , immunohistochemical studies with the endothelial markers cd31 and cd34 were particularly helpful in highlighting the flat endothelial cells on the antiluminal side of the second fibromuscular layer .
we therefore coined the term " endothelialized muscularis mucosae " to describe this phenomenon .
in the future , this histologic sign could potentially aid preoperative diagnosis of gi tract cavernous hemangiomas by serving as a useful diagnostic clue for interpreting small biopsies such as those obtained during endoscopy .
preoperative histologic diagnosis would be helpful in counseling patients on the indications , risks , and benefits of surgery , as well as in planning the operation and the extent of the resection .
while cavernous hemangiomas are benign , they can be locally destructive by way of invading , exerting pressure , or disrupting the physiology of surrounding structures .
due to these factors and the prevalence of complications such as bleeding or bowel obstruction , cavernous hemangiomas require surgical resection more often than other intestinal hemangiomas [ 4 ] .
surgery is indicated for a variety of reasons , including to treat or prevent such complications , to relieve symptoms such as abdominal pain , or to rule out malignancy and acquire a diagnosis when the work - up has been nondiagnostic [ 4 , 12 ] .
in this case , all of these factors contributed to the decision for surgical resection , but we believe that surgical planning would have been greatly facilitated by a preoperative knowledge of the diagnosis .
due to the nonspecific presentation , many patients with gi cavernous hemangiomas will be evaluated with endoscopy at some point , if not early on in their work - up [ 1 ] .
when these lesions are accessible by traditional endoscopy , they present a problem for the patient and the provider , if the lesion is detected endoscopically but is unable to be diagnosed histologically .
the first issue is that an unknown lesion may or may not require resection depending on its histologic diagnosis , but resection is necessary to acquire the histologic diagnosis in the first place .
furthermore , a surgeon in this position must debate whether to perform an excisional biopsy only , subjecting the patient to another abdominal surgery if the histologic diagnosis is malignant , or whether to initially resect a larger portion of the bowel and mesentery , in hopes that the patient will require only one operation to cover the anticipated histologic diagnostic possibilities .
at this point in the work - up , either operation may be unnecessary to manage the lesion , depending on the patient 's symptoms and the likelihood of complications .
for these reasons , we believe our new histologic observation of the " endothelialized muscularis mucosae " has an important role in identifying these cavernous hemangiomas when they are found on endoscopy : establishing the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma before an operation could save future patients from having a surgical intervention that may be unnecessary or larger than that required for this diagnosis .
additionally , by publishing this histologic finding , we hope that further studies will determine if this clue could be generalized to aid in diagnosis of cavernous hemangiomas from small biopsies in other organs or systems .
4. conclusion small bowel cavernous hemangiomas are extremely rare vascular lesions which present with nonspecific gi symptoms such as abdominal pain and nausea , anemia , and gi bleeding .
complications include bowel obstruction , intussusception , perforation , and hemorrhage .
their size and propensity for bleeding may be affected by comorbid patient conditions which impair venous flow .
diagnostic challenges include nonspecific presentation and features on imaging , inconclusiveness of biopsy , or inaccessibility by endoscopy .
pathologists should be aware of the " endothelialized muscularis mucosae " which can be very helpful in diagnosing gi cavernous hemangiomas , particularly in small biopsies .
the ability to acquire a histologic diagnosis preoperatively has important implications in patient counseling and surgical planning .
a conservative surgical resection , which may be successfully performed laparoscopically , is recommended in order to relieve symptoms or prevent complications and provide definitive diagnosis when necessary .

the particles significantly inhibited occlusive arterial thrombi .
the particles also manifested binding providing magnetic resonance contrast highlighting thrombi .
background acute thrombosis is currently addressed with a cocktail of anticoagulants , antiplatelet agents , and thrombolytics .
optimization of antithrombotics for clinical use remains a significant research challenge .
thrombin inhibitors represent a promising class of anticoagulant .
imaging contrast agents specific to thrombi would represent a boon to clinical intervention , enabling monitoring of thrombosis .
in recent work , a thrombin - inhibiting perfluorocarbon nanoparticle ( pfc np ) , functionalized by the direct thrombin inhibitor , ppack ( phe ( d ) - pro - arg - chloromethylketone ) , was presented as a prototype for novel class of targeted antithrombotic .
here , an np functionalized with bivalirudin ( bvr ) , was compared to bvr and the ppack np. both particles were examined as agents for inhibition and imaging of acute thrombosis .
methods ppack or bvr were covalently attached to pfc nps .
optical assay verified that ppack and bvr selectivity and activity against thrombin was not diminished on the nps .
in vivo activity was assessed for ppack nps , ppack , bvr , bvr nps , heparin , non - functionalized nps , or saline in c57bl6 mice subjected to laser injury of the carotid artery .
time to thrombotic occlusion of the injured artery was assessed via doppler flow measurement .
selected arteries were excised to assess np retention via 19f mr at 12t .
the laser injury arterial thrombosis model was applied in cholesterol - fed rabbits to demonstrate 3t mri of thrombosis following administration of ppack nps .
19f mri of the arterial segment at 12t enabled mapping of the thrombus .
results ppack nps exceeded ppack 's activity against thrombin .
bvr activity on nps was insignificantly diminished versus free bvr .
previously , ppack nps outperformed both heparin ( p =. 001 ) and ppack ( p =. 0006 ) in delaying occlusion of the carotid artery .
ppack or non - functionalized nps failed to delay occlusion of the carotid artery .
bvr nps significantly delayed occlusion ( p =. 02 ) whereas an equivalent dose of free bvr ( 120 mg / kg ) did not ( figure 1a ) .
19f mr captured specific pfc np retention in occluded arteries ( figure 1b ) , with 19f mri demonstrating colocalization of particles with the arterial thrombus and quantitative 19f spectroscopy demonstrating specificity of bvr or ppack np binding .
ultrasound imaging showed development of thrombi in rabbits ( figure 2a ) .
mra detected the formed thrombus ( figure 2b ) .
19f mri mapped the thrombus via retention of ppack nps .
figure 1 figure 2 conclusions anticoagulant pfc nps were designed as new antithrombotics with intrinsic magnetic resonance contrast , concentrated therapeutic impact conferred by a thrombin - specific particle surface , and well - defined pharmacokinetics controlled by the particle itself .
as potent agents that can enhance the therapeutic performance of different thrombin inhibitors , these nps are promising agents .
further clinical potential is conferred on the thrombin - inhibiting pfc np by its ability to guide further intervention by specifically localizing magnetic resonance contrast to sites of thrombosis .

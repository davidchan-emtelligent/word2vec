previously we presented swarm v1 , a novel and open source amplicon clustering program that produced fine - scale molecular operational taxonomic units ( otus ) , free of arbitrary global clustering thresholds and input - order dependency .
swarm v1 worked with an initial phase that used iterative single - linkage with a local clustering threshold ( d ) , followed by a phase that used the internal abundance structures of clusters to break chained otus .
here we present swarm v2 , which has two important novel features : ( 1 ) a new algorithm for d = 1 that allows the computation time of the program to scale linearly with increasing amounts of data ; and ( 2 ) the new fastidious option that reduces under - grouping by grafting low abundant otus ( e.g. , singletons and doubletons ) onto larger ones .
swarm v2 also directly integrates the clustering and breaking phases , dereplicates sequencing reads with d = 0 , outputs otu representatives in fasta format , and plots individual otus as two - dimensional networks .

introduction traditional de novo amplicon clustering methods that can handle large high - throughput sequencing datasets ( e.g. , edgar , 2010 ; ghodsi , liu & pop , 2011 ; fu et al. , 2012 ) suffer from two fundamental problems .
first , they rely on an arbitrary fixed global clustering threshold to group amplicons into molecular operational taxonomic units ( otus ) .
global clustering thresholds have rarely been justified and are not applicable to all taxa and marker lengths ( e.g. , caron et al. , 2009 ; nebel et al. , 2011 ; dunthorn et al. , 2012 ; brown et al. , 2015 ) .
second , there is variability in the clustering results due to amplicon input order ( koeppel & wu , 2013 ; mahe et al. , 2014 ) .
to solve these problems , we previously introduced the open source swarm v1 program that implemented an initial clustering phase written in c + + , then a breaking phase written in python ( mahe et al. , 2014 ) .
swarm 's clustering phase ( fig. 1a ) was novel in its approach to single linkage clustering in that , instead of using a global clustering ( e.g. , hartmann et al. , 2012 ; huse et al. , 2010 ) , amplicons were iteratively added together using a small local clustering threshold ( d ) until no more amplicons could be added .
using d = 1 produced the highest resolution otus .
swarm 's breaking phase ( fig. 1b ) was novel in that it used the abundance of amplicons to reveal the internal structure of potentially chained otus ( i.e. , a low abundant link between high abundant amplicons ) .
these chained otus were then refined by splitting them .
10.7717 / peerj.1420 / fig - 1 figure 1 schematic view of swarm 's clustering and refinement approach .
( a ) swarm clusters amplicons iteratively by using a small user - chosen local threshold , d , allowing otus to grow to their natural limits , where no other amplicons can be added .
( b ) swarm takes into account the abundance of each amplicon to produce higher resolution clusters , by not allowing the formation of amplicon chains .
the darker the red , the higher the abundance .
( c ) the fastidious option avoids under - grouping ( e.g. , the production of small otus such as singletons and doubletons ) by postulating the existence of virtual linking amplicons to graft smaller otus onto larger ones .
since its introduction , swarm v1 has been used in a variety of datasets ( de vargas et al. , 2015 ; filker et al. , 2015 ; lima - mendez et al. , 2015 ; mahe et al. , 2015 ; oikonomou et al. , 2015 ) .
however , since the breaking phase was written in python , it lacked scalability and was cumbersome to use .
kopylova et al .
( pers. comm. , 2015 ) also found that in comparison to other clustering methods , swarm v1 tended to produce relatively more low abundant otus ; e.g. , singletons and doubletons. and most importantly , swarm v1 and other current de novo algorithms could not cluster today 's largest high - throughout sequencing datasets within a reasonable amount of time ( rideout et al. , 2014 ) .
here we introduce swarm v2 to help solve these problems , as well as to introduce new and useful features .
material and methods linear complexity de novo clustering approach today 's largest amplicon datasets contain hundreds of millions of amplicons and pose a computational challenge to de novo clustering methods .
because of this scalability problem , rideout et al .
( 2014 ) proposed using a mixed clustering approach with an initial closed - reference clustering that compares the amplicons to what is known in taxonomic reference databases to capture most of the data , followed by a de novo clustering with the remaining amplicons .
we feel that using only de novo clustering is the most powerful approach when working with amplicons from unexplored environments that lack sufficient taxonomic reference databases , or with rare taxa that were previously missed in already - sampled environments .
we therefore worked to improve swarm 's scalability .
like other current de novo clustering approaches , swarm v1 presented an apparent quadratic behavior in that it needs to perform a number of comparisons that grows as the square of the number of amplicons .
in swarm v2 , we first reduced computational time by improving the multithreading and making a better usage of multi - core cpus .
we further reduced computational time by using a novel algorithmic approach .
this linear complexity approach only applies for d = 1 , which is swarm 's default and preferred parameter as it produces the highest resolution clusters .
as background to this linear approach , let us consider a nucleic sequence s made of as , cs , gs and ts. a " microvariant " is a sequence with one difference ( d = 1 ) to the original sequence s. how many distinct microvariants can derive from s ?
in a sequence s of length l , each position can be substituted with 3 different bases , so there are 3l possible microvariants due to substitutions .
each position in s can be deleted once , so there are l possible microvariants due to deletions .
insertions are more complicated .
an insertion can happen before or after each position in the sequence s , and four different nucleotides can be inserted resulting in 4 ( l + 1 ) microvariants .
however , some insertions will result in the same microvariant : for example , inserting a " g " before or after a " g " will result in the same sequence " gg. " as that situation arises for all positions in s but one , the maximum number of distinct insertions is not 4 ( l + 1 ) , but 3 ( l + 1 ) + 1 = 3l + 4 .
in total , the maximum number of microvariants that can be obtained from a given sequence s of length l is 3l + l + 3l + 4 = 7l + 4 .
as stated above , different sequence modifications can produce the same microvariant .
the final number of distinct microvariants depends on the number of homopolymer stretches in the sequence .
in the extreme situation where the sequence is entirely made of one type of nucleotide , the number of microvariants due to deletions drops from l to 1 .
for example , if s is entirely made of " g ," all possible deletions yield the same microvariant .
the total number of distinct microvariants then drops to its minimum value : 3l + 1 + 3 ( l + 1 ) + 1 = 6l + 5 .
the number of distinct microvariants that can be obtained from a sequence s of length l then varies from 6l + 5 to 7l + 4 .
in practice , it means that a typical high - throughput sequencing 16s rrna sequence of 130 nucleotides will yield at least 785 microvariants and at most 914 , and that the number of microvariants will increase linearly with the sequence length. with current sequencing technologies read length increases at a slower rate than read number , and is safe to assume it will continue to do so in the foreseeable future .
based on these characteristics of microvariants , we switched from an approximate - string comparison approach to an exact - string comparison approach. that is , for a given amplicon , instead of doing an exact pairwise alignment comparison against all available amplicons in the pool that have yet to be subsumed into an otu , swarm v2 generates all possible microvariants of the amplicon and checks whether or not they are present in the amplicon pool using a hash table .
this exact - string search approach is extremely fast , and does not depend on the number of available amplicons in the pool .
therefore , the apparent computational complexity changes from n2 to n x l , where l is the average amplicon length .
reducing under - grouping as observed by kopylova et al .
( pers. comm. , 2015 ) , swarm v1 tended to produce relatively more low abundant otus ; e.g. , singletons and doubletons .
this problem is due to swarm 's approach that depends on the existence of a continuous path of linked amplicons .
linking amplicons can be missing , especially when sequencing is shallow .
when this occurs , there can be under - grouping of closely related amplicons leading to small otus surrounding a larger otu .
to address this problem in swarm v2 , we introduced a new step - - called the fastidious option - - to graft low abundant otus onto more abundant ones by postulating a linking amplicon ( fig. 1c ) .
a low abundant otu is defined as an otu with a total abundance lower than 3 , i.e. , an abundance of one ( singletons ) or two ( doubletons ). that default threshold value can be modified by users with the option - b. in practice , microvariants ( independent of the microvariants produced in the clustering phase ) are produced for all the amplicons belonging to low abundant otus and stored in a bloom filter ( a probabilistic dictionary ) .
microvariants are then produced for high - abundant amplicons and cross - checked against the bloom filter .
the fastidious option can consume a large amount of memory , but is apparently linear in terms of computation time ( see results ) .
the user does have control over memory usage and can exchange memory space for computation time .
as of now , the fastidious option can only be used with d = 1 , which is swarm 's default and recommended d value. with higher d values , the time and space complexity of our fastidious algorithm grows too fast to be practical .
the fastidious option can be viewed as a way to reduce data loss , as many researchers conservatively consider low abundant otus as spurious errors and remove them from downstream analyses ( behnke et al. , 2011 ; kunin et al. , 2010 ). with the fastidious option , though , one can retain many of these amplicons by attaching them to more abundant otus .
in contrast with an increase of d , the fastidious option does not slow down computation and does not degrade the clustering resolution ; i.e. , it reduces the under - grouping of amplicons without inducing much over - grouping ( see section " statistics on mock - communities " in file s1 ) .
other new and useful features in swarm v2 we introduce a number of options improving both speed and usability .
first , there is a simpler user command line interface .
for example , the breaking phase is now written in c + + and is performed directly during the growth phase , which further significantly reduces computation time .
we chose to implement a strict , simple , non - parametric breaking model that prevents any increase in abundance along a continuous amplicon path ( fig. 1b ) .
breaking of linked chains can be deactivated .
second , swarm v2 extends the notion of clustering by allowing the option d = 0 .
users can now dereplicate their sequencing reads into strictly identical amplicons ( sensu mahe et al. , 2015 ; i.e. , reads that have exactly the same sequences with no substitutions , insertions , or deletions ) .
this fast dereplication approach uses the same algorithm as in vsearch ( https :// github.com / torognes / vsearch ) .
third , swarm v2 can output otu representative amplicons in fasta format .
a representative is the most abundant amplicon of an otu , and its abundance is updated to reflect the total otu abundance .
otu representatives are normally used for downstream community - comparative , novel - diversity , and ecosystem - functioning questions .
fourth , swarm v2 offers the possibility to visualize the internal structure of otus , which allows the user to gain further knowledge of its underlying genetic and ecological diversity ( figs. 2 and 3 ) .
these plots are in the form of a network projected in two - dimensions .
edges in these networks only represent the parameter d used ; the length of the edges carries no information .
the nodes in the networks represent amplicons .
the abundance information of these amplicons is represented in three ways : the size of the node , the color of the node , and text when its abundance value is 10 or more .
analyses to demonstrate the apparent linear complexity of swarm v2 , we analyzed 16s rrna reads from the earth microbiome project ( gilbert , jansson & knight , 2014 ) , which is the largest amplicon dataset currently available .
the following swarm commands were used : swarm - d 1 in.fasta , and swarm - d 1 - f in.fasta .
to illustrate over - and under - grouping of amplicons , the importance of the breaking phase , high - resolution clustering , and swarm 's ability to visualize otus' internal structures , we used 18s rrna amplicon data from the biomarks consortium ( logares et al. , 2014 ) that sampled european near - shore marine sites .
the pr2 v203 reference database was used for taxonomic assignment ( guillou et al. , 2013 ) .
the full methods can be found online in html format ( file s1 ) .
results and discussion time and space benchmarks for d = 1 , swarm 's default parameter , using the full - and sub - datasets of the earth microbiome project we were able to evaluate swarm v2 's clustering time and memory usage .
these timing experiments were obtained with swarm v2.1.1 on a machine with 1,024 gb of ram running red hat centos v6.6 and linux kernel v3.9.1 on four intel xeon e5 - 4620 processors ( 2.2 ghz ) having a total of 32 physical cores .
swarm was run with 8 threads ( option " - t 8 ") , breaking activated ( default behaviour ) , and memory limited to 240 gb (" - c 245760 ") .
the times indicated below are the averages of four runs. with the sub - dataset of 154,896,650 strictly identical amplicons ( representing 1,277,640,415 reads ) , swarm without the fastidious option took 1 h and 45 min +/ - 1 min. with the full - dataset of 314,871,149 strictly identical amplicons ( representing 2,254,207,945 reads ) , swarm without the fastidious option took 3 h and 41 min +/ - 1 min .
doubling of dataset size approximately doubles the run time , confirming the apparent linear time complexity .
therefore , if the size of the earth microbiome project were to increase ten times , it should take about ten times longer to cluster it ( less than two days ) .
these fast times of swarm v2 contrast with the estimated computational time of uclust v6.1 as inferred by rideout et al .
( 2014 ) .
using a smaller partial - dataset of the earth microbiome project consisting of only 660,000,000 reads ( that dereplicate into a unspecified number of strictly identical amplicons ) , rideout et al .
( 2014 ) estimated uclust 's runtime to 150 days on a 8 - core computer. with the sub - dataset representing 24 gb of input data , the memory usage of swarm v2 with d = 1 was 41 gb. with the full - dataset representing 49 gb of input data , the memory usage was 86 gb. memory requirements can therefore be estimated to be approximately equal to the size of the input dataset plus 2 / 3 .
when clustering at d = 1 and using the fastidious option , the total computational time of the sub - dataset was 4 h and 59 min +/ - 1 min , which resulted in 40.0 % fewer otus in total .
the total computational time of the full - dataset took 11 h and 28 min +/ - 5 min , which resulted in 38.3 % fewer otus in total .
this considerable reduction in the number of singletons and doubletons in both datasets helps solve the problem found by kopylova et al .
( pers. comm. , 2015 ) .
the computation time is about three times longer when using the fastidious option than without it. the total memory usage of d = 1 with the fastidious option for the sub - dataset was 114 gb , while it was 239 gb ( capped ) for the full - dataset .
this amount of memory might not be available to all users .
therefore we have implemented two options to control and cap memory usage of the fastidious option : by defining the maximum memory footprint , and by adjusting the size of the bloom filter entries .
both of these options allow users to trade computational time for memory space .
otu visualizations we provide examples of swarm v2 's graphical representation of the internal structure of its high - resolution otus by using v4 and v9 18s rrna amplicons .
in both cases the breaking phase and fastidious option were turned off. with the v9 data ( about 129 bp in length ) , the graph shows two high abundant otus linked by one lower abundant amplicon ( fig. 2 ) .
the number of nucleotide differences between these two linked otus is only two , or about 98.4 % similarity .
if the breaking phase and fastidious option were applied to these v9 amplicons , nine separate otus would have been formed : two high abundant , and seven low abundant .
these two high abundant otus are taxonomically assigned to different genera of collodaria ( radiolaria ) .
on the same v9 amplicons , uclust v6 ( as well as v7 and v8 ) using a global clustering threshold of 97 % similarity produced 37 otus ( one high abundant , and 36 low abundant ) .
the one high abundant otu from uclust lumped the two collodaria genera , thus masking meaningful biological data .

nodes represent amplicons .
node size , color and text annotations represent the abundance of each amplicon .
edges represent one difference ( substitution , deletion or insertion ) ; the length of the edges carries no information .
the red - colored edge indicates where swarm 's breaking phase cuts when it is not deactivated , resulting into two high abundant otus , each being assigned to a different genus of collodaria ( radiolaria ). with the v4 amplicons ( about 380 bp in length ) , the graph shows three high abundant otus linked by one to three low abundant amplicons ( fig. 3 ) .
the number of nucleotide differences between these three linked otus is only two and four , or about at least 98.9 % similarity .
if the breaking phase and fastidious option were applied to these v4 amplicons , seven separate otus would have been formed : three high abundant , and four low abundant .
these three high abundant otus are assigned to different taxa of cnidaria .
on the same v4 amplicons , uclust v6 ( as well as v7 and v8 ) produced only one otu with the widely used global clustering threshold of 97 % similarity , again masking meaningful biological data .
these amplicon data show that , compared to uclust , swarm v2 can distinguish higher - resolution clusters and reduces both over - grouping and under - grouping on a range of marker lengths .
in both of these amplicon examples , swarm v2 is able to distinguish different taxa , while uclust conceals them .

nodes represent amplicons .
node size , color and text annotations represent the abundance of each amplicon .
edges represent one difference ( substitution , deletion or insertion ) ; the length of the edges carries no information .
the red - colored edges indicate where swarm 's breaking phase cuts when it is not deactivated , resulting into three high abundant otus , each being assigned to a different taxa of cnidaria ( metazoa ) .
outlook we are currently working on a number of fronts to continue making swarm harder , better , faster , stronger .
for example , preliminary experiments indicate that with a novel multithreading approach for d >= 2 a ten - fold increase in speed could be obtained ( although d >= 2 will still be quadratic in behavior ) .
internally encoding nucleotides on two bits instead of eight bits may help reduce both memory consumption and computational time .
additional computation time can be saved by merging the fastidious option with the initial clustering phase .
to facilitate its usage , swarm v2 can be included in qiime ( caporaso et al. , 2010 ) , which already offers swarm v1.2 , and in galaxy ( goecks , nekrutenko & taylor , 2010 ) .
in summary , swarm v2 is a highly - scalable approach that uses a local clustering threshold to produce high - resolution de novo otus and reduces low abundant otus .
swarm v2 is an optimized c + + program able to handle many hundreds of millions of amplicons .

background polypharmacy is common among older adults .
however , little is known about the composition of polypharmacy : which are the most frequently used drugs , and how much do these drugs contribute to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy .
methods a total of 822,619 swedes aged >= 75 years was identified from the total population register. through record - linkage with the swedish prescribed drug register and the social services register we could analyze concurrent drug use in the entire population ( both individuals living in the community and institution ) on the 31 december 2013 .
results the prevalence of polypharmacy (>= 5 drugs ) was 45 % .
the most frequently used drugs were cardiovascular drugs , analgesics , and psychotropics. by excluding the ten most frequently used drug classes or compounds , the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69 % and 51 % respectively .
the majority of the users of either one of the 10 most frequently used drugs concurrently used at least 4 other drug classes ( 66 % - 85 %) .
conclusion almost half of the individuals aged >= 75 years are exposed to polypharmacy in sweden .
a handful of drugs make a large contribution to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy and the majority of drugs prescribed to persons aged >= 75 years are used in combination with other drugs .
this highlights the high use of drugs , and the need to consider other concurrent drug treatments when prescribing for older adults .

introduction the prevalence of polypharmacy ( commonly defined as the use of >= 5 drugs ) is increasing among older adults in high income countries [ 1 - 3 ] .
in sweden , the prevalence of polypharmacy was 39 % among people aged >= 65 years living in the community and 76 % among people living in institutions in 2009 [ 4 ] .
polypharmacy increases the risk of drug - drug interactions and adverse drug reactions [ 1,5,6 ] .
it has also been linked to a number of negative health outcomes , such as falls and hospitalization , but these results are less conclusive [ 7 ] .
physiological changes in the aging body , multimorbidity and the use of multiple medications complicates prescribing to older adults [ 8 ] .
for similar reasons , older adults are rarely included in clinical drug trials [ 9 - 11 ] .
however , in the real - world setting older adults are the main users of prescribed drugs and many are both frail and use multiple drugs concomitantly [ 12 ] .
few studies have investigated to what magnitude the drugs prescribed to older adults are intended to be used as a part of a polypharmacy regimen .
the drug use among older adults , with or without polypharmacy , tends to be concentrated around a limited number of frequently used drugs classes , specifically cardiovascular drugs , analgesics and psychotropic drugs [ 1,13 - 16 ] .
although some notable differences in prescribing patterns has been reported for people residing in the community compared to persons living in institutions [ 4,13,17 ] .
to our knowledge , however , no efforts have previously been made to estimate how the most frequently prescribed drugs contribute to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy .
more evidence regarding which drugs that frequently contribute to polypharmacy might inform the interventions aimed at reducing polypharmacy in older adults [ 18 - 22 ] .
to this end , we aim to investigate : 1 ) the 10 most frequently used drug compounds and drug classes used by swedes aged >= 75 years with polypharmacy , with excessive polypharmacy , or living in a nursing home ; 2 ) the reduction in the prevalence of polypharmacy when excluding the top - 1 through top - 10 most frequently used drug classes and drug compounds ; and 3 ) the number of other drugs used concomitantly with the 10 most frequently used drug compounds and drug classes .
methods all persons aged >= 75 years in sweden were included in the study population ( n = 822,619 ) , based on the register of the total population ( alive 31 december 2013 ). through record - linkage , we were able to obtain information about living arrangement ( community - living vs. institution ) from the swedish social services register ( sssr ) and drug use from the swedish prescribed drug register ( spdr ) .
individual - level linkage of registers is made possible through the personal identity numbers used in sweden [ 23 ] .
this study was approved by the regional ethical review board in stockholm ( dnr 2013 / 1941 - 31 / 3 and 2015 / 1319 - 32 ) .
all procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and / or national research committee and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards .
for this type of register study formal consent is not required .
the spdr is one of the largest pharmacoepidemiological databases in the world and includes all prescribed dispensed drugs in sweden. from the spdr , we obtained data about dispensed drugs ( dispensing date , the amount of drug dispensed , and the prescribed dosage ) from 1 october to 31 december 2013 .
based on this three - month period we construct a list of concurrently used drugs on the arbitrarily chosen date of 31 december 2013 ( 1 - day point prevalence ) .
if the same drug was prescribed twice , or at different doses , it was treated as one prescription .
for a more detailed description of the methodology , please see wastesson et al [ 13 ] .
the drugs were classified according to the anatomical therapeutic chemical ( atc ) classification system as recommended by the who [ 24 ] .
information about living arrangement ( community - living vs. institution ) was derived from the swedish social services register ( sssr ) .
this register holds detailed information on publically funded social care for persons aged >= 65 years in sweden [ 25 ] .
other actors than the municipalities finance a negligible proportion of the social care in sweden .
living arrangement was assessed at the same date as the drug use , i.e. 31 december 2013 .
measures the number of used drugs was defined as the number of used original drug compounds ( 5th level atc code : chemical substance ) .
the number of used drugs was classified as ' no polypharmacy ' 0 - 4 drugs , ' polypharmacy ' >= 5 drugs , and ' excessive polypharmacy ' >= 10 drugs .
living arrangement was classified as living in the community or living in an institution .
in sweden , a needs - assessor decides if a person is eligible for institutional care .
hence , people living in institutions are generally a frail sub - population with high care needs .
it has been estimated that two - thirds of them have functional disability , and three out of four have cognitive impairment [ 26 ] .
therefore , institutionalization in the swedish context may be used as a proxy for frailty .
the ten most frequently used drug classes ( 3rd level atc code : pharmacological subgroup ) and drug compounds ( 5th level atc code : chemical substance ) were calculated for people with polypharmacy , excessive polypharmacy and people living in institutions .
statistical analyses the prevalence of polypharmacy was calculated for the total study population and for people living in institutions .
the ten most frequently used drug classes and drug compounds were calculated for people with polypharmacy , excessive polypharmacy and people living in institutions , respectively .
we also calculated the most frequently used drug classes for the population aged 65 - 74 years ( n = 1,051,115 ) to investigate age differences in commonly used drugs ( presented in the supporting material , s1 table ) .
this population was extracted from the same registers , using the same methodology , as for the population aged >= 75 years .
we calculated the reduction in the prevalence of polypharmacy , together with changes in the mean and median number of used drugs , when excluding the most frequently used drugs ( fig 1 ) .
last , the number of other drugs used concurrently with the ten most frequently used drug classes and drug compounds by the patient was calculated ( fig 2 ) .
stata 14 ( stata corp lp , college station , tx ) was used for the analyses and data preparation was done using a customized drug data software ( monitior ) .

cardiovascular drugs , analgesics , and psychotropic drugs dominated the lists in all three groups ( i.e. people with polypharmacy , excessive polypharmacy and institutionalized ) .
drug classes such as antithrombotic drugs ( atc code b01a ) and minor analgesics ( n02b ) were among the five most commonly used drug classes in all three groups , and consequently acetylsalicylic acid ( b01ac06 ) and paracetamol ( n02be01 ) were the two most frequently used drug compounds .
lipid modifying drugs ( c10a )/ simvastatin ( c10aa01 ) , and ace inhibitors ( c09a )/ enalapril ( c09aa02 ) were among the 10 most frequently used drug classes / compounds among people with polypharmacy , but not in the institutionalized population .
antidepressants ( n06a )/ citalopram ( n06ab04 ) , anxiolytics ( n05b )/ oxazepam ( n05ba04 ) were more frequently used among institutionalized than community - dwelling older people .

the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced from 45 % to 36 % when excluding the three most frequently used drug compounds ; to 31 % when excluding the top 5 drug compounds and to 22 % when excluding all the top 10 drug compounds ( panel a ) .
in total , this represents a 51 % reduction of the prevalence of polypharmacy .
for the drug classes ( panel b ) , the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced from 45 % to 31 % when excluding the three most frequently used drug classes , to 25 % when excluding the top 5 drug classes and to 14 % when excluding all the top 10 drug classes .
in total , the prevalence of polypharmacy was reduced by 69 % when removing the ten most frequently used drug classes .
in fig 2 , the 10 most frequently used drug classes ( panel a ) and drug compounds ( panel b ) are presented according to the concurrent number of other drugs used .
only 1 % to 3 % of the users of one of the 10 most frequently drug classes used that drug class as monotherapy and the corresponding proportion for drug compounds was also 1 % to 3 % in the total study population ( n = 822,619 ) .
the majority of the users of either one of the 10 most frequent drugs used at least four other drugs classes ( 68 % - 85 %) or drug compounds ( 66 % - 85 %) in combination with that specific drug .
discussion in this large unselected nationwide study of swedes aged 75 years and older , the prevalence of polypharmacy (>= 5 drugs ) was 45 % and the prevalence of excessive polypharmacy (>= 10 drugs ) was 8 % .
the use of drugs was centered on cardiovascular drugs , analgesics and psychotropic drugs among people with polypharmacy , excessive polypharmacy and people residing in an institution respectively .
a handful of drugs make a large contribution to the overall prevalence of polypharmacy .
the prevalence of polypharmacy would be halved by excluding the ten most frequently used drug compounds .
the most frequently used drugs among people aged 75 years with polypharmacy , excessive polypharmacy , and institutionalized were fairly similar and mainly included cardiovascular drugs , analgesics and psychotropic drugs ( the most frequent drugs was also similar among persons aged >= 65 years with polypharmacy ) .
this is in line with previous studies investigating drug use among very old adults [ 4,13,14 ] .
institutionalized individuals used some cardiovascular drug classes less frequently , such as lipid modifying agents and ace inhibitors .
this may reflect that people in institutions are on average older , and these drug have been reported to be used at lower rates among very old people [ 13 ] .
however , this might also reflect that there are different prescribing patterns in institutions relative to the community setting [ 4,17 ] .
people residing in institutions in sweden are frail and often have cognitive impairment and limited remaining life expectancy [ 26,27 ] .
this could contribute to the lower use of preventive treatments ( e.g. , lipid lowering drugs ) in these settings [ 28 ] .
contrary , antidepressants and anxiolytics were more common in institutions than among community - dwellers [ 4,13 ] .
in this study , 42 % of the institutionalized individuals used an antidepressant .
the use of drugs was concentrated around some frequently prescribed drugs .
the prevalence of polypharmacy would be halved , from 45 % to 23 % if the six most frequently used drug classes were removed .
this suggests that drug use among older adults is concentrated around a limited number of drug classes .
several attempts to reduce polypharmacy in clinical settings have been made [ 18 - 22 ] .
eliminating the ten most frequently used drugs is unrealistic because many of them are essential drug treatments with well - known safety profiles .
however , these drugs represent the drugs for which the largest gains in lowering the prevalence of polypharmacy could be accomplished if eliminated .
our results points to that reducing polypharmacy at the population level would be a large undertaking because even in the simplistic example of excluding the 10 most used drug compounds , the prevalence would only be halved .
if polypharmacy per se should be targeted , our findings highlight that providing person - centered and effective deprescribing for the large group of older adults with polypharmacy will indeed be a challenge .
the majority of individuals using one of the 10 most frequently used drugs were concurrently using at least four other drugs used drugs ( 66 - 85 %) .
this highlights that real - life drug use among older adults is indeed different from the typical clinical drug trial that tests one drug for one disease at the time [ 9 - 11 ] .
strength and limitations the main strength of this study is the large and unselected nationwide study population .
we provide nationally representative figures on the concurrent use of drugs with detailed data on all the prescribed and dispensed drugs .
furthermore , the registers also hold information on the persons' current living arrangement ( community vs. institution ) .
it has earlier been shown that living arrangement is an essential factor in drug utilization studies of older people [ 4 ] .
there are also some limitations to this study .
the spdr does not include over - the - counter drugs , drugs used in hospitals and drugs provided from nursing home supply rooms .
thus , we will most likely underestimate the prevalence of polypharmacy .
in addition , we only count combined products ( including more than one active ingredient ) as one drug , this will also lead to an underestimation of the number of active ingredients used .
moreover , we only know that the prescriptions have been filled at the pharmacy , but we do not know to what extent the patient adheres to the treatment .
this will most likely lead to an overestimation of the prevalence of polypharmacy .
furthermore , the analysis of how the prevalence of polypharmacy changes when excluding the ten most commonly used drugs is a simulation test that is unrealistic in the clinical setting .
however , with this , rather than suggesting that the most frequently used drugs should be removed , we wished to shed a light on to what extent polypharmacy is concentrated around the use of certain drugs .
in sum , almost half of the population aged >= 75 years used five or more drugs concurrently ( polypharmacy ) .
the majority of the most common drugs are used concurrently with at least four other drugs .
this highlights the complexity of older peoples' drug therapy .
we also show that , in sweden , removing as much as the ten most commonly used drug compounds would only reduce the prevalence of polypharmacy by half .
this suggests that reducing the prevalence of polypharmacy on a population level will indeed be a challenge because providing person - centered and safe deprescribing for almost half of the population is a major undertaking .

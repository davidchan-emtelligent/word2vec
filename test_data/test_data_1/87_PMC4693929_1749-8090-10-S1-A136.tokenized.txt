although cardiac surgery is considered gold standard in many cases of complex cardiac disease , it is associated with significant complications including mortality .
aims / objectives to assess patient expectations prior to cardiac surgery , including awareness of complications .
method consecutive cases were interviewed over a two week period within a regional cardiothoracic centre in scotland .
thirty patients were interviewed by the lead author 24 hours prior to procedure to ensure consistency .
results there were 28 elective and 2 emergency cases .
all patients had read the pre - cardiac surgery information booklet and signed the centre 's standardised consent form detailing both major and minor complications .
2 patients ( 7 %) gave the wrong name of procedure and 5 ( 17 %) patients were unable to state procedure indication .
when invited to list complications , 5 patients ( 17 %) mentioned stroke , however , 22 ( 73 %) were unaware of this potential risk when asked directly .
9 patients ( 30 %) were able to list 3 or more complications .
most frequently recalled were mortality , bleeding and need for repeat operation .
23 ( 77 %) correctly quoted percentage mortality risk .
interestingly , 5 ( 17 %) patients ' did not want to know ' and 2 ( 7 %) patients were unable to recall any complications .
when considering duration of hospital stay , 3 ( 10 %) patients expected 3 - 5 days post operatively .
22 ( 73 %) expected a 5 - 7 day stay whilst 5 ( 17 %) anticipated greater than 7 days .
when asked ' how well informed do you feel ?' , the mean score was 8.5 / 10 .
discussion / conclusion this project offered valuable insight into patient expectations and knowledge of complications prior to cardiac surgery .
the results show that the majority of patients were unable to recall more than 3 complications. of note , some patients stated that they did not want to know nor discuss complications , which may reflect pre - operative mentality rather than disregard for risk .
important reflective points include emphasis on the dynamic nature of the consent process and ensuring patient understanding throughout .
recommendations have included patient information booklets being readily available at the bedside and encouraging patients and families to seek clarification , even after the consent form has been signed at pre - assessment clinic

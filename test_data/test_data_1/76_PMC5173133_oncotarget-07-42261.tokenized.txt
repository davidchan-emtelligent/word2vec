estrogen receptor - alpha ( eralpha ) is a clinically important therapeutic target for breast cancer .
however , tumors that lose eralpha are less responsive to anti - estrogens such as tamoxifen .
micrornas ( mirnas ) are small rnas that regulate expression of their target gene and dysregulations of mirna has been identified in many diseases including human cancer .
however , only a few mirnas associated with tamoxifen resistance has been reported .
in this study , we found that lymphocyte antigen 6 complex ( ly6k ) , which is a member of the ly - 6 / mupar superfamily and related to breast cancer progression and metastasis , is inversely correlated with eralpha expression .
we , for the first time , found mirnas involved in the regulatory molecular mechanism between eralpha and ly6k and related to tamoxifen susceptibility in breast cancer .
mir - 192 - 5p , induced by ly6k , downregulates eralpha directly and induced tamoxifen resistance in eralpha - positive breast cancer cells .
in addition , re - expression of eralpha in eralpha - negative breast cancer cells increased mir - 500a - 3p expression and directly inhibits ly6k expression .
ectopic expression of mir - 500a - 3p sensitized eralpha - negative cells to tamoxifen by increasing apoptosis .
finally , we observed an inverse correlation between ly6k and eralpha in primary breast cancer samples .
we found that patients with recurrence showed high expression of mir - 192 - 5p after tamoxifen treatments .
in addition , expression of mir - 500a - 3p was significantly correlated to survival outcome .
as mirnas involved in the regulatory mechanism between ly6k and eralpha can affect tamoxifen resistance , downregulating mir - 192 - 5p or re - expressing mir - 500a - 3p could be a potential therapeutic approach for treating tamoxifen resistant patients .
breast cancer tamoxifen susceptibility ly6k eralpha mirna introduction breast cancer is the common malignant tumor world - wide in women .
classically , breast cancer is classified into several subgroups according to the expression of the following receptors : estrogen receptor ( er ) , progesterone receptor ( pr ) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) [ 1 ] .
approximately 70 % of breast cancer patients are dependent on estrogen receptor alpha ( eralpha ) [ 2 ] , so diverse treatment options have been developed targeting eralpha [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
tamoxifen is broadly used in adjuvant treatment for er - positive breast cancer patients .
in addition , tamoxifen was clinically associated with growth arrest and apoptosis by interrupting estrogen binding to the er in eralpha - positive breast cancer .
however , tumors that undergo loss of er or negative expression of er have less responsiveness to er - targeted drugs in breast cancer [ 5 ] .
lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus k ( ly6k ) is a member of the ly - 6 / urokinase - type plasminogen activator receptor ( upar ) superfamily [ 6 ] .
recently , ly6k was reported to be a molecular biomarker in breast cancer [ 7 ] , bladder cancer [ 8 ] and esophageal squamous cell carcinomas [ 9 ] .
in addition , ly6k expression is regulated by the ap - 1 transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation , invasive and metastatic abilities in breast cancer cells [ 10 ] .
nonetheless , there are few studies to supporting the effect of ly6k on various type of breast cancer .
a variety of cellular activities are regulated by micrornas ( mirnas ) such as apoptosis , metabolism and proliferation in many cancer types [ 11 , 12 ] .
recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of mirnas is related to pathologic features in breast cancer [ 13 ] .
mir - 221 / 222 [ 14 , 15 ] and mir - 181 [ 16 ] contribute to the development of tamoxifen resistance by degrading genes involved in the regulation of breast cancer therapies .
furthermore , re - expression of mir - 320a [ 17 ] , mir - 375 [ 18 ] , and mir - 342 [ 19 ] could restore tamoxifen sensitivity by inhibiting their targets .
in this study , we found an inverse correlation between the expression of eralpha and ly6k in breast cancer. by investigating the molecular mechanism behind the functions of mir - 192 - 5p and mir - 500a - 3p in the regulation of eralpha and ly6k , how mir - 192 - 5p , induced by ly6k , causes tamoxifen resistance by inhibiting eralpha expression in eralpha - positive breast cancer .
in addition , we elucidated the mechanism mir - 500a - 3p is induced by eralpha and downregulates ly6k expression and re - expression of mir - 500a - 3p sensitizes tamoxifen responsivity .
our findings provides a rationale for downregulating mir - 192 - 5p or re - expressing mir - 500a - 3p as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating tamoxifen resistant patients .
results ly6k and eralpha is negatively expressed in breast cancer cells to investigate ly6k is involved in the regulation of eralpha expression , we evaluated both the mrna and protein levels in the breast cancer cell lines .
we confirmed that the eralpha - positive breast cancer cell lines , mcf7 and t47d , did not express ly6k mrna and protein , whereas the eralpha - negative breast cancer cell lines , mcf7 - adr and mda - mb - 468 , expressed ly6k mrna and protein ( figure 1a and 1b ) .
to confirm the inverse correlation between eralpha and ly6k , we observed eralpha expression by overexpressing ly6k in eralpha - positive breast cancer cell lines .
both eralpha mrna and protein were downregulated by ly6k ( figure 1c and 1d ) .
in addition , we observed that the expression of ly6k was reduced by ectopic expression of eralpha in mcf7 - adr and mda - mb - 468 , well known as eralpha - negative breast cancer cells .
ectopic expression of eralpha led to the reduction of both ly6k mrna and protein expression in eralpha - negative breast cancer cells ( figure 1e and 1f ) .
figure 1 the expression of eralpha is negatively correlated with ly6k ( a and b ) expression of ly6k and eralpha mrna and protein was observed by qrt - pcr using specific primers and western blotting .
h18s rrna and beta - actin were used for endogenous control .
( c and d ) ectopic expression of ly6k in mcf7 and t47d downregulated eralpha transcriptional activity and protein expression .

ly6k and eralpha expression is regulated in mirna - dependent manner to identify the molecular events involved in the inverse correlation between ly6k and eralpha , we hypothesized that the upregulation of mirna by ly6k and eralpha might mediate the expression of target genes .
to verify this hypothesis , we confirmed the level of eralpha expression level through simultaneously the overexpression of ly6k and knock - down of argonate 2 ( ago2 ) , which participates in mature mirna processing as a member of the rna - induced silencing ( risc ) complex protein .
as a result , the mrna and protein expression level for eralpha reduced by ectopic expression of ly6k , whereas knock - down of ago2 restored the expression of eralpha ( figure 2a and 2b ) .
furthermore , ectopic expression of eralpha led to the reduction of ly6k expression but ago2 knockdown did not further reduce ly6k expression in mcf7 - adr , mda - mb - 468 ( figure 2c and 2d ) .
collectively , these results indicated that the regulation mechanism for ly6k and eralpha is dependent on mirnas .
figure 2 the regulation of eralpha and ly6k expression in a mirna - dependent manner ( a and b ) gene expression level was determined on both mrna and protein levels after treatment with ago2 sirna combined with overexpression of ly6k for 48 hr. the expression of mrna and protein was analyzed by qrt - pcr and western blotting .

ly6k and eralpha affect mirna expression in breast cancer cells on the basis of these observations , we further investigate to identify mirnas affected by the overexpression of ly6k or eralpha .
we first carried out mirna microarray analysis in t47d , eralpha - positive cells , compared with t47d / ly6k ( supplementary figure s1a ) .
another mirna microarray analysis was performed in comparison with mcf7 - adr , eralpha - negative cells , mcf7 - adr / eralpha , transiently overexpress eralpha .
( supplementary figure s1b ) .
as a result , we found several mirna which were affected and upregulated by ly6k or eralpha .
to search for mirnas which directly target to eralpha and ly6k 3 ' untranslated region ( 3'utr ) , we used miranda ( http :// www.microrna.org ) computational tools and identified candidate mirnas .
to validate the mirna microarray analysis , we explored the possibility that selected mirnas were activated by transient overexpression of ly6k or eralpha in each breast cancer cell .
we first confirmed that all three primary - mirna ( pri - mirna ) , activated by rna polymerase ii binding to the relevant dna sequence during mirna biogenesis , were significantly increased ( figure 3a ) and mature mirna expression also increased ( figure 3b and 3c ) .
these results revealed that selected mirnas were transcriptionally activated by ly6k or eralpha .

each primary mirna produces mature mirnas ( pri - mir - 29a / b1 : mir - 29b , pri - mir29b2 / c : mir - 29b and mir - 29c , pri - mir - 194 - 2 / 192 : mir - 192 - 5p and mir - 194 , pri - mir - 194 - 1 : mir - 194 , pri - mir - 34a : mir - 34a , pri - mir - 500a : mir - 500a - 5p or - 3p ) .

mir - 192 - 5p induced by ly6k suppresses eralpha expression to determine whether the reduced expression of eralpha was due to direct targeting among mir - 29b - 3p , mir - 29c - 5p and mir - 192 - 5p , we cloned luciferase reporter construct esr1 3 ' - utr containing the predicted binding site for each mirna ( figure 4a and supplementary figure s2a ) .
among the selected mirnas , only mir - 192 - 5p altered luciferase activity in wild type constructs when compared with the mutant type construct .
likewise , luciferase activity was reduced by the transfection of ly6k ( figure 4b ) .
in the case of mir - 29b - 3p and mir - 29c - 5p , luciferase activity was no different between the wild type reporter construct and in the mutant with regard to the predicted binding site following the transfection of each mirna ( supplementary figure s2b ) .
in conclusion , the results of the dual luciferase assay confirmed that mir - 192 - 5p directly targets esr1 .

to assess a possible role for the downregulation of eralpha in mcf7 and t47d , we transfected either a mir - 192 - 5p mimic ( mimic ) or a negative control mimic ( nc ) .
we confirmed the mir - 192 expression using qrt - pcr after treating mimic ( supplementary figure s3a ) .
the mrna and protein of eralpha were significantly reduced by the overexpression of mir - 192 - 5p in both mcf7 and t47d ( figure 4c ) .
in addition , to observe whether the inhibition of mir - 192 - 5p expression restored the mrna expression of eralpha , we generated a t47d stable cell line over - expressing human ly6k genes ( t47d / ly6k ) using g418 selection .
it was confirmed that this stable cell line expressed plenty of ly6k mrna and protein by qrt - pcr and western blot , respectively ( figure 4d ). by using t47d / ly6k cells , we repressed the expression of mir - 192 - 5p and confirmed the level of mir - 192 - 5p by qrt - pcr ( supplementary figure s3b ) .
consequently , inhibition of mir - 192 - 5p restored eralpha mrna expression .
likewise , the protein expression of eralpha was upregulated by inhibiting mir - 192 - 5p expression in t47d / ly6k stable cells ( figure 4e ) .
taken together , mir - 192 - 5p , induced by ly6k , repressed the level of eralpha expression .
mir - 500a - 3p , induced by eralpha , targets and inhibits human ly6k expression in the same context , to determine whether the reduced expression of ly6k was due to direct targeting among three selected mirnas , we searched the 3'utr region of the ly6k gene for the mirna binding motif using mirnada program .
we generated luciferase reporter constructs with human ly6k 3'utr containing each mirna ( figure 5a and supplementary figure s4a ) .
among these mirna , only mir - 500a - 3p overexpression led to a decrease in luciferase activity .
luciferase activity was also reduced by ectopic expression of eralpha .
this response was abrogated by the mutation of two mir - 500a - 3p targeted seed sequences ( figure 5b ) .
the luciferase activity was no different between the wild type reporter construct and the mutant construct of the predicted binding site following the transfection mir - 34a and mir - 194 - 5p ( supplementary figure s4b ) .

we further identified the possible role of ly6k downregulation by the overexpression of a mir - 500a - 3p mimic .
we transfected the mir - 500a - 3p mimic ( mimic ) and the negative control mimic ( nc ) .
we confirmed that the transfection efficiency of the mir - 500a - 3p mimic using qrt - pcr ( supplementary figure s3c ) .
ly6k mrna and protein expression was significantly reduced by ectopic mir - 500a - 3p in both mcf7 - adr and mda - mb - 468 ( figure 5c ) .
these results suggested that mir - 500a - 3p , induced by eralpha , directly repressed ly6k expression .
inhibition of mir - 192 - 5p sensitizes resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer cells having demonstrated the mirna - dependent reciprocal regulation of ly6k and eralpha expression , we further studied whether mir - 192 - 5p and mir - 500a - 3p are functionally involved in tamoxifen responsiveness in breast cancer .
this is because tamoxifen is a selective estrogen antagonist and a well - known drug for breast cancer .
to identify whether t47d / ly6k cells had tamoxifen resistance , we evaluated the cell viability after treating t47d and t47d / ly6k cell with tamoxifen .
the cell viability was significantly reduced in t47d cells after treatment with tamoxifen whereas , the cell viability was barely reduced in t47d / ly6k because eralpha expression was suppressed ( supplementary figure s5a ) .
moreover , compared to the negative mirna inhibitor ( nc ) , inhibition of the mir - 192 - 5p expression made t47d / ly6k cells more susceptible to tamoxifen ( figure 6a ) .

tamoxifen was also reported to induce apoptosis and to inhibit cell proliferation in breast cancer cells [ 20 ] .
after treating t47d and t47d / ly6k cells with tamoxifen , caspase - 3 activation was significantly increased in t47d cells but was relatively low in t47d / ly6k ( supplementary figure s4b ) .
since the inhibition of mir - 192 - 5p in t47d / ly6k affected cell viability , we further investigated the effect of tamoxifen - induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of mir - 192 - 5p .
caspase - 3 activity was increased by treatment with the mir - 192 - 5p inhibitor in comparison with the negative mirna inhibitor ( nc ) after incubating t47d / ly6k cells with tamoxifen ( figure 6b ) .
in addition , to confirm whether mir - 192 - 5p enhancement induced tamoxifen resistance , we investigated that sub g1 phase of cell cycle after treatment of 4 - oht with mir - 192 - 5p .
the apoptotic cells was reduced by ectopic mir - 192 - 5p in t47d cells ( figure 6c ) , suggesting that the mir - 192 - 5p suppressed tamoxifen - induced apoptosis. from these results , mir - 192 - 5p appears to regulate resistance to tamoxifen through cell viability along with cell apoptosis .
mir - 500a - 3p enhances tamoxifen sensitivity by promoting apoptosis in breast cancer cells we have shown that mir - 500a - 3p downregulates ly6k expression by directly targeting its 3'utr .
in this study , we investigated mir - 500a - 3p enforced tamoxifen sensitivity through the activation of apoptosis in eralpha - negative cancer cells .
this is because tamoxifen is effective in eralpha - positive breast cancer patients but only 10 ~ 15 % of eralpha - negative patients respond to tamoxifen .
we assessed cell viability by treatment with tamoxifen to transiently mir - 500a - 3p overexpression in mcf7 - adr .
the cell viability was significantly reduced by ectopic expression of mir - 500a - 3p in mcf7 - adr ( figure 6d ) .
in addition , we examined the effect of mir - 500a - 3p re - expression on enhancing tamoxifen sensitivity through apoptosis .
mir - 500a - 3p significantly affected caspase - 3 activation after treatment with tamoxifen ( 10 mum ) compared to negative control ( nc ) ( figure 6e ) .
similar results were also found cells analysis in the sub - g1 phase of the cell cycle after treatment of tamoxifen using flow cytometry .
ectopic expression of mir - 500a - 3p was found to promote tamoxifen - induced apoptosis in mcf7 - adr ( figure 6f ) .
the results together indicate that mir - 500a - 3p , induced by eralpha , regulates tamoxifen sensitivity by targeting ly6k in eralpha - negative breast cancer cells .
mirnas involved in the mechanism of ly6k and eralpha are related to tamoxifen susceptibility in breast cancer patients we have shown that ly6k and eralpha have an inverse correlation in breast cancer and that mirnas involved in this mechanism affect tamoxifen resistance .
to further ascertain whether mirnas involved in the mechanism for ly6k and eralpha are correlated with clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients , we first investigated the inverse correlation between ly6k and eralpha expression in breast primary tumor samples obtained from oncomine ( tm ) .
er positive tumors had relatively low ly6k expression while er negative tumors showed high ly6k expression ( figure 7a ) .
in addition , we observed mir - 192 - 5p and mir - 500a - 3p expression in primary breast tumors treated with tamoxifen .
patients with recurrence showed increased mir - 192 - 5p expression ( figure 7b ) .
these results suggested that increasing expression of mir - 192 - 5p could lead to recurrence in eralpha - positive breast cancer patients because reduced expression of eralpha is one of the causes of tamoxifen resistance .
although mir - 500a - 3p expression was not significantly different in recurrence ( figure 7c ) , expression of mir - 500a - 3p was significantly correlated with survival outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen ( figure 7d ) .
figure 7 mir - 192 - 5p and mir - 500a - 3p involved in ly6k and eralpha are related to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer patients ( a ) the relative ly6k expression depending on er status in kao - breast cancer from oncomine ( tm ) .

the mechanism for mir - 192 - 5p and mir - 500a - 3p effects on tamoxifen susceptibility through the regulation of target genes in breast cancer .
* p < 0.05 ; ns , non - significant .
in conclusion , the expression of mir - 192 - 5p is up - regulated because of increased ly6k in eralpha - positive and ly6k - negative breast cancer .
the expression of mir - 500a - 3p is also up - regulated by eralpha overexpression in ly6k - positive and eralpha - negative breast cancer .
increased expression of mir - 192 - 5p leads to decreased eralpha expression , which is one of the problems that lead to tamoxifen resistance in eralpha - positive cancer .
in addition , upregulated mir - 500a - 3p expression , instead of eralpha restoration , can affect tamoxifen susceptibility by targeting ly6k in eralpha - negative breast cancer ( figure 7e ) .
discussion in our data , we clearly found that the expression of ly6k and eralpha is negatively correlated in breast cancer cells .
we observed the down - regulation of eralpha expression when overexpressing the human ly6k gene in eralpha - positive cells ( figure 1c and 1d ) .
among the different causes of resistance to hormonal therapies , the loss of eralpha expression is an important factor in breast cancer [ 21 ] .
this reduced expression of eralpha brought by ly6k may provide a clue for patients that develop resistance to hormonal therapies .
in addition , ly6k expression is downregulated by ectopic expression of eralpha ( figure 1e and 1f ) .
it was reported that highly upregulated ly6k is related to cell proliferation and metastatic abilities in breast cancer [ 10 ] .
these findings suggested that eralpha could be involved in attenuating metastatic and proliferative capacities and may enhance drug sensitivities in eralpha - negative breast cancer .
it is widely known that mirna is important as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene depending on the subtypes of a particular cancer [ 22 ] .
here , we showed that mir - 192 - 5p , induced by ly6k , and mir - 500a - 3 , induced by eralpha , were selected through microrna microarray ( figure 3 and supplementary figure s1 ) .
elevated ly6k activated matrix metalloproteinase proteins mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 [ 23 ] .
the expression of mir - 192 - 5p is transcriptionally activated by tgf - beta , which well known as growth factor stimulated by mmps [ 24 , 25 ] .
although ly6k is not known as a transcriptional factor , transcription of mir - 192 - 5p might be indirectly promoted by ectopic expression of ly6k .
recently , mir - 192 - 5p was also identified as a potential target for esophageal cancer cells in a study profiling the development of chemotherapy resistance [ 26 ] .
we observed that mir - 192 - 5p was related to tamoxifen resistance through cell viability and apoptosis in breast cancer cells ( figure 6 ) .
in addition , mir - 192 - 5p expression was increased in primary tumor samples treated with tamoxifen ( figure 7 ) , so inhibition of mir - 192 - 5p could be a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of tamoxifen resistant breast cancer .
furthermore , we determined that elevated eralpha stimulates mir - 500a - 3p and suppress ly6k expression in eralpha - negative breast cancer cells ( figure 3 and figure 5 ) .
many studies have attempted to restore eralpha expression in order to increase tamoxifen sensitivity in eralpha - negative breast cancer .
hdac inhibitors can induce re - expression of eralpha transcriptional activity and improve endocrine therapy when combined with dna - damaging agents [ 27 ] .
cpg methylation of the er promoter by inhibition of dmnt activity can reactivate er because of transcriptional silencing in eralpha - negative breast cancer cells [ 28 , 29 ] .
similarly , our results suggested a novel mechanism involving the downregulation of ly6k via the mir - 500a - 3p axis , induced by eralpha , and may be involved in attenuating metastatic and proliferate capacities in eralpha - negative breast cancer .
in this respect , upregulation mir - 500a - 3p may increase tamoxifen susceptibility because restoration of eralpha leads to increase mir - 500a - 3p expression about 2 ~ 3 times ( figure 3c and supplementary figure 1 ) .
although there are no significant differences in tamoxifen resistant tumor samples ( figure 7c ) , these results were not clearly in accord with the environment that mir - 500a - 3p activities are increased by overexpression of eralpha .
also , low expression of mir - 500a - 3p is correlated to poor survival outcome in breast cancer patients who receiving tamoxifen mono therapy ( figure 7d ) .
thus , mir - 500a - 3p may help to increase tamoxifen susceptibility in breast cancer .
in conclusion , we showed for the first time that the involvement of mir - 192 - 5p and mir - 500a - 3p regulates the mechanism for the interaction between eralpha and ly6k and is related to tamoxifen responsiveness in breast cancer .
these findings describe not only the loss of eralpha correlated with mir - 192 - 5p , induced by ly6k , in eralpha - positive breast cancer but also how upregulation of mir - 500a - 3p affects tamoxifen - induced cell death in eralpha - negative breast cancer .
these results provide clues that not only the molecular mechanism of ly6k and eralpha in breast cancer but also the inhibition of mir - 192 - 5p in eralpha - positive breast cancer and the overexpression of mir - 500a - 3p in eralpha - negative breast cancer could be effective therapeutic agents .

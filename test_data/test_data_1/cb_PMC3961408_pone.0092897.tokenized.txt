boreal forests are characterized by spatially heterogeneous soils with low n availability .
the decomposition of coniferous litter in these systems is primarily performed by basidiomycete fungi , which often form large mycelia with a well - developed capacity to reallocate resources spatially - an advantageous trait in heterogeneous environments .
in axenic microcosm systems we tested whether fungi increase their biomass production by reallocating n between pinus sylvestris ( scots pine ) needles at different stages of decomposition .
we estimated fungal biomass production by analysing the accumulation of the fungal cell wall compound chitin .
monospecific systems were compared with systems with interspecific interactions .
we found that the fungi reallocated assimilated n and mycelial growth away from well - degraded litter towards fresh litter components .
this redistribution was accompanied by reduced decomposition of older litter .
interconnection of substrates increased over - all fungal c use efficiency ( i.e. the allocation of assimilated c to biomass rather than respiration ) , presumably by enabling fungal translocation of growth - limiting n to litter with higher c quality .
fungal connection between different substrates also restricted n - mineralization and production of dissolved organic n , suggesting that litter saprotrophs in boreal forest ecosystems primarily act to redistribute rather than release n. this spatial integration of different resource qualities was hindered by interspecific interactions , in which litters of contrasting quality were colonised by two different basidiomycete species .
the experiments provide a detailed picture of how resource reallocation in two decomposer fungi leads to a more efficient utilisation of spatially separated resources under n - limitation. from an ecosystem point of view , such economic fungal behaviour could potentially contribute to organic matter accumulation in the litter layers of boreal forests .

introduction in boreal forests , which cover a major part of the terrestrial northern hemisphere , saprotrophic fungi play an important ecological role as litter decomposers .
the organic litter layers of boreal forests are characterized by a high degree of stratification , where c : n ratios decrease with increasing litter age and depth [ 1 ] .
as litter components are used sequentially in order of decreasing accessibility [ 2 ] , the usability of the residual litter as a resource for fungal growth ( hereafter referred to as " quality ") also decreases .
the filamentous growth form and the well - developed capacity of many litter fungi to translocate carbohydrates and nutrients within their mycelia enable efficient exploitation of such spatially separated substrates [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
thus , fungal translocation may mediate interaction between interconnected substrates of different quality with subsequent implications for overall turnover of c and n in boreal forests .
in boreal forests , mineral nutrients , particularly n , are usually scarcely available and primary production is generally n limited [ 5 ] .
due to the low n content of coniferous litter , decomposition of recently shed litter also appears to be n limited [ 6 ] , and low levels of exogenous n addition have been observed to increase colonization and decomposition by fungi in laboratory studies [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
during the first years of decomposition , the n content of the litter frequently increases , not only in relative concentrations but also in absolute amounts [ 2 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
this increase has been attributed to fungal n import [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] in order to overcome n limitation of growth and activity in newly shed litter [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] .
in the same way as fungal translocation of n could support colonization of fresh , high c : n ratio litter , fungal c translocation could also enable more effective utilization of low c : n ratio substrates .
in low c : n ratio substrates , n is conventionally assumed to be mineralized as a result of c - limitation of the decomposer microorganisms .
n - containing organic compounds are then used as a c source rather than an n source , and excess nh4 is released to the environment .
however , in microcosm studies , boberg et al .
[ 9 ] showed that litter decomposing fungi may be able to overcome local c limitation by reallocating c from fresh needle litter , preventing n - mineralization .
not only the plant derived substrates , but also the fungal communities are spatially heterogeneous and display vertical zonation [ 1 ] , [ 18 ] .
interspecific interactions , generally involving antagonism and combative behaviour , constantly take place in natural communities , as different individuals and species compete for space and resources [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
interspecific interactions may restrict the potential for resource reallocation between substrates of different quality and thereby have major consequences for decomposition and nutrient mineralization .
here we aim to test the following specific hypotheses ; ( i ) that n would be reallocated from well decomposed needles to fresh litter , with concomitant increases in fungal growth and needle decomposition in the fresh litter , ( ii ) that c would be reallocated from fresh litter to well degraded litter , increasing fungal growth and needle decomposition as well as reducing n losses ( n - mineralization ) , and ( iii ) that interactions between different fungal species would prevent c and n translocation between litter components .
in order to test these hypotheses , we used a microcosm approach to obtain a detailed , integrated picture of resource dynamics and redistribution between natural substrates under controlled conditions .
axenic laboratory microcosms were prepared with scots pine ( pinus sylvestris ) needle litter inoculated with the litter decomposing basidiomycetes gymnopus androsaceus or mycena epipterygia ( fig. 1 ) .
species belonging to these genera occur abundantly in decomposer communities in forest litter [ 1 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] and are efficient decomposers of both cellulose and lignin [ 23 ] .
the systems were constructed so that portions of litter at different stages of decomposition were colonized by common fungal mycelia , allowing translocation of resources .
patterns of resource reallocation were compared between single - species systems and two - species systems involving antagonistic interactions between different fungal individuals .
as ascomycetes in the order helotiales are common components of litter colonising communities [ 1 ] , interaction with a helotialean species was also included .

material and methods fungal species , substrates and experimental design three species of litter fungi were used in the experiment ; gymnopus androsaceus ( l. ) j.l. mata & r.h. petersen ( earlier marasmius androsaceus ( l. : fr. ) fr. ) isolate jb14 , mycena epipterygia ( pears. ) kuhn. , isolate jb13 , and an unknown species within the order helotiales ( isolate bdi ) .
the different species of fungi will hereafter be referred to as gymnopus , mycena and helotiales , respectively .
all isolates are deposited at the department of forest mycology and plant pathology , slu , sweden .
the strains and their decomposition capacity were previously described in boberg et al .
[ 23 ] , and its sequences are deposited at ncbi ( gu234007 , gu234008 and gu393951 ) .
brown , abscised scots pine needles were obtained from the yearly collection of needles at jadraas experimental forest , central sweden ( 60degrees49'n , 16degrees30'e ) [ 24 ] with permission from the swedish university of agricultural sciences .
the needles were collected on sheets in plot ih0 , which consists of a 25 - year - old pine stand .
after collection , the needles were air dried and stored at - 27degreesc .
the needles contained 0.4 % n , had a c / n - ratio of 135 , and a lignin concentration of approximately 25 % [ 25 ] .
microcosms were constructed , in which sand , litter and fungi were spatially organised to represent the vertical zonation of boreal forest litter layers ( fig. 1 ) .
in order to keep litter cohorts at different stages of decomposition separated , portions of 0.6 g dw of needles were placed in polyester mesh bags ( 5x5 cm ; 0.6 mm mesh , sintab produkt ab , oxie , sweden ) .
a small bundle ( o 1 cm ) of glass wool was placed within each bag next to the needles .
the pure fungal mycelium growing into the glass wool was used to determine ratios of chitin to fungal c and n. the filled litter bags were dried at 80degreesc for 72 h , weighed , and thereafter autoclaved at 121degreesc for 15 min .
the sterilised needle - filled bags were placed on 85 g acid washed and autoclaved sand ( baskarpsand b55 , askania , gothenburg , sweden ) in 77 mmx77 mmx97 mm plastic containers ( magenta corporation , chicago , us ; fig. 1 ) .
the systems were inoculated by placing a pair of pinus sylvestris needles , pre - inoculated on water agar , under the needle filled bag .
some systems were inoculated with gymnopus ( n = 47 ) and the rest with mycena ( n = 47 ) .
a subset of the systems was supplemented with 18 ml of 7 mm nh4cl solution labelled with 1 atom % 15n excess of 15nh4cl ( cambridge isotope laboratories , andover , usa ) added to the sand .
to the remaining systems , 18 ml of 7 mm nacl were added to ensure equal osmotic and cl - concentrations .
the vessels were closed with lids , sealed with parafilm and incubated at 20degreesc in darkness for 146 days .
the vessels were ventilated every 30 days in a sterile environment .
after the first incubation period , the litter bags were moved to a new set of vessels prepared with 85 g of acid washed and autoclaved sand wetted with 18 ml of 7 mm nacl solution .
the new vessels were then treated as follows ( fig 2 ) : for each of the four treatments ( two fungi , with or without added n ) , some systems were supplemented with a second un - inoculated needle - filled litter bag , added on top of the first one ( connected systems ) .
other systems received no second litter bag ( isolated systems ) .
in order to investigate effects of interspecific interactions , some systems ( with 15n added during period one ) were supplemented with a second needle bag that had been pre - inoculated ( 30 days on water agar ) with either gymnopus , mycena or helotiales .
in addition , isolated systems were prepared for only one incubation period .
all vessels were sealed and incubated at 20degreesc in darkness for another 151 days ( second incubation period ) , after which they were harvested .
the needle bags were carefully removed and washed in 10 ml of ultra - pure water ( milli - q , merck millipore ) , in order to remove all exudates .
the 10 ml of washing solution was poured into the sand and the boxes were stored at - 27degreesc .
the needle bags were dried at 80degreesc for 72 h , weighed , and ground in a ball mill .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0092897.g002 figure 2 experimental design .
illustration of the experimental design showing the time line and a description of the sequential treatments .
at start , litter bags filled with pinus sylvestris needles inoculated with either gymnopus androsaceus or mycena epipterygia were placed directly on sand receiving 15nh4cl (+ n ) or nacl ( - n ) .
after 5 months the old litter ( white ) was moved to new vessels with sand receiving nacl and a second layer of new litter ( grey ) , uninoculated ( connected litter ) , inoculated with the same species ( single - species interaction ) , inoculated with the other species , g. androsaceus or m. epipterygia , ( two - species basidiomycete ) or a helotiales sp .
( two - species ascomycete ) , was placed on top of the old litter .
in some systems , the old litter was incubated without addition of a second litter layer ( isolated systems ) .
after an additional 5 months , the experiment was terminated .
control systems with litter bags were incubated in isolation for 5 month only , were also prepared .
number of replicates for each treatment is indicated in brackets .
analyses fungal biomass in the needles was determined by chitin analysis using a method described by ekblad and nasholm [ 26 ] .
fungal mycelium that had grown into the glass wool bundles ( pooled within each treatment ) was used to establish conversion factors between fungal chitin , c and n , which were subsequently used to calculate actual needle decomposition ( after subtraction of accumulated fungal mass ) and fungal c use efficiency .
both needles and glass wool bundles were ground in a ball mill and the contents of c , n and 15n were analysed on a cn analyzer ( model euroea3024 , eurovector , milan , italy ) coupled to an isoprime isotope - ratio mass spectrometer ( gv instruments , manchester , uk ) .
the amount of mycelium attached to the mesh bags after removing the needles was estimated gravimetrically .
losses of c and n to the sand were determined as total dissolved organic carbon ( doc ) and nitrogen ( don ) , and n mineralization was estimated as nh4 produced in the sand solution .
the sand from each vessel was extracted with 43 - 50 ml of ultra - pure water by shaking for 2 h. sand solution was filtered through glass fibre filters ( type a / c pall life sciences ) and analysed for nh4 content on a flow injection analyser ( fiastar , foss tecator , hoganas , sweden ) .
doc and don were determined using a cn analyser ( shimadzu toc - vcph coupled to a tnm - 1 , japan ) .
the 15n content of the don pool was determined in pooled and evaporated samples of treatments receiving n addition .
calculations and statistical analysis the chitin content of the needles was corrected for pre - experimental amounts and subsequently converted to fungal c using conversion factors , which were obtained by linear regression of data from glass wool bundles .
needle decomposition was then calculated as the sum of needle mass loss and fungal biomass production .
total n in needles and mycelium was calculated as the sum of n in needles with associated mycelium and n in mycelium attached to the litter bags .
total 15n in needles and mycelium was calculated in the same way and converted to 15n excess by subtracting natural 15n abundances .
fungal biomass is expressed as mycelial c and was calculated as the total amount of c in mycelium in needles ( as estimated by chitin analysis ) and on the litter bag ( estimated gravimetrically assuming a c content of 50 %) .
decomposition , total n in needles and mycelium , and fungal biomass are all expressed per amount needles at start .
c - use efficiency was calculated as the ratio of total mycelial c to total c decomposed for whole systems at harvest .
doc and don were expressed in relation to the amounts of needle c degraded during the second period , since the amounts of doc and don lost during the first incubation period were not determined .
the contribution of needle n and fungal n to don was calculated from the 15n content of the don , un - colonized needles and fungal mycelium in the glass wool bundles , using a mixing model [ 27 ] .
data on fungal biomass , nh4 , doc , don and c - use efficiency were log - transformed before statistical analysis , to meet the assumption of normality and homogeneity of variance .
effects of species , addition of n and litter bag connections , as well as single - species and two - species interactions , on decomposition , fungal biomass production , total n content , doc , don and nh4 production were tested using anova .
effects of species , n addition and litter bag connections on c - use efficiency were also tested using anova .
in cases where significant explanatory variables in the anova had more than two categories or when interaction terms were significant , tukey 's or fisher 's lsd post - hoc tests were used at the 0.05 significance level .
results n - reallocation , mycelial growth and litter decomposition anova indicated that addition of nh4cl to the sand during the first incubation period increased the average n content of the litter bags by 10 % ( p = 0.003 ; isolated bags only ) , leading to 18 % higher mycelial production ( p = 0.02 ) and 6 % higher decomposition rates ( p = 0.03 ; table s1 ) .
at the end of the experiment , 20 % of the added 15n was recovered in the isolated litter bags .
connected systems had taken up 22 - 27 % of the added 15n , of which approximately one third had been reallocated to the upper , new litter ( fig. 3 ) .
overall , litter inoculated with gymnopus was more decomposed than litter inoculated with mycena , and gymnopus also produced more fungal mycelium ( fig. 4 ) .

in diagrams showing total n in needles and mycelium , the horizontal dashed line represents initial needle n content .
in diagrams showing fungal biomass , the horizontal dashed line represents fungal biomass produced during the first 5 months of incubation .
anova indicated that when litters of different stages of decomposition were incubated together , the total amount of n in the upper , new litter , increased compared to litter incubated in isolation , but a significant connection x species interaction term followed by a fisher 's lsd test indicated that the difference was significant only for systems with gymnopus ( p < 0.0001 ) .
correspondingly , the amount of n in the lower , well decomposed litter decreased ( p = 0.04 ; added n only due to missing data ; fig. 4a ) .
in connected systems , higher fungal biomass was found in the new litter ( p < 0.0001 ) but lower biomass in the old litter ( anova followed by fisher 's lsd test : gymnopus p < 0.004 ; mycena p < 0.0001 ) .
in fact , in connected systems , fungal biomass in the old litter did not increase further during the second incubation period , whereas in isolated systems the fungi continued to grow also in the old litter ( fig. 4 ) .
in parallel , decomposition of the old litter decreased in response to litter addition ( anova followed by fisher 's lsd test : gymnopus p < 0.0001 ; mycena p = 0.04 ) , whereas there was no significant effect on decomposition of the new litter ( fig. 4 ) .
effects of interspecific interactions according to visual inspection of the systems at harvest , interspecific interactions ( two - species ) between the two basidiomycetes ended in deadlock , i.e. neither of the strains was able to enter the territory colonized by the other .
in two - species basidiomycete interaction systems , only small amounts of added 15n were recovered from the new litter ( fig. 3 ) , whereas in systems where the new litter was pre - inoculated with the same strain as the old litter ( single - species ) , 15n reallocation to new litter was even greater than when non - inoculated litter was colonised from below .
in most respects , single - species systems with old and new litter behaved as systems where non - inoculated , new litter was colonised from below , whereas two - species basidiomycete interaction systems behaved as litters incubated in isolation ( table 1 ) .
anova indicated that the amounts of n ( p = 0.0008 ) and fungal biomass ( p = 0.001 ) in the new litter were higher in single - species systems compared to two - species systems .
in contrast , the amounts of n ( p = 0.03 ) , fungal biomass ( significant only for systems with mycena ; fisher 's lsd p = 0.0005 ) and decomposition ( p = 0.0002 ) in the old litter were lower in single - species systems compared to two - species systems .
mycena increased decomposition of new litter in two - species systems ( p = 0.02 ; table 1 ) .
in all measured aspects , the bags pre - colonized by the helotialean strain behaved like bags where the basidiomycetes grew up into uncolonized new litter ( c.f. table 1 and table s1 ) .

losses of c and n to sand solution approximately 6 % and 2 % of the total n pool at harvest was recovered as don in the sand solution of isolated litter bag systems inoculated with gymnopus and mycena , respectively .
anova indicated that there was a general negative effect of addition of new litter ( p < 0.001 ) on the amount of doc and don produced per g decomposed needle c ( fig. 5 ) .
in systems without added n , addition of new litter even decreased the absolute amounts of doc and don produced by the system , in spite of the larger amount of decomposed organic material ( data not shown ) .
n - addition during the first incubation period also had a negative effect on mg doc and don produced ( significantly so in isolated litter bag systems only ; fisher 's lsd p < 0.001 ) .
mixing model calculations based on the 15n content of the sand solution indicated that 60 % and 33 % of the don originated from the fungi in systems inoculated with gymnopus and mycena , respectively .
don correlated significantly with doc , with c : n ratios of 92 and 129 for the dissolved organic matter ( dom ) produced in systems inoculated with gymnopus and mycena , respectively .

c - use efficiency the average c - use efficiency ( i.e. proportion of assimilated c allocated to biomass production ) of gymnopus across all systems was 25 % , whereas the corresponding figure for mycena was 16 % .
gymnopus colonizing old and new litter had a higher c - use efficiency than the fungus colonizing old and new litter separately ( fig. 7 ) .
for mycena , the c - use efficiency in isolated old litter was significantly lower than in connected litter .
n addition had no significant effect on c - use efficiency ( data not shown ) .
the estimated c - use efficiencies should be regarded as a lower bound approximation , since mycelium in the sand was not accounted for .

bars sharing the same letters are not significantly different ( p > 0.05 ) .
establishment of c , n and chitin ratios the amounts of chitin extracted from colonised glass wool bundles were linearly correlated to both the c and n content ( fig. 8 ) .
the intercepts of the c and n axes were interpreted as representing background levels of c and n. the relationships between chitin and fungal c in the glass wool bundles were consistent between treatments but differed between the two - species .
the regression equations yielded a chitin to c conversion factor of 15.1 ( r2 = 0.91 ) and a chitin to n conversion factor of 0.5 ( r2 = 0.89 ) for gymnopus .
the chitin to c and chitin to n conversion factors for mycena were estimated to 7.5 ( r2 = 0.39 ) and 0.23 ( r2 = 0.68 ) , respectively .
consequently the c : n ratios of the fungal mycelium were estimated to 30 and 32 for gymnopus and mycena , respectively .
anova found no significant effects on the c : n ratio of the mycelium due to addition of n ( p = 0.2 ) or incubation time ( p = 0.9 ) .
assuming a fungal c content of 50 % , the fungal mycelium ( dw ) chitin contents were estimated to 3.3 % for gymnopus and 6.7 % for mycena .

discussion c and n dynamics and interaction between old and new litter the results from the experiments supported our original hypothesis ( i ) that n would be reallocated from well decomposed needles to fresh litter ( although the net increase in new litter was significant only for gymnopus ) and that increased n availability would stimulate fungal growth in the new litter .
the observed stimulation of decomposer fungi by n addition ( table s1 ) is consistent with earlier observations of a stimulatory effect of n amendments on fungal growth and decomposition rates in laboratory studies [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] and supports that fungal growth and activity in coniferous litter is n limited at early stages of decomposition .
rapidly growing mycelium in recently deposited litter is likely to be a relatively strong sink for n that causes withdrawal of n from the older litter , suggesting internal competition for n between different parts of the mycelium [ 4 ] .
the limited amount of 15n found in new litter of the interspecific interaction systems ending in deadlock indicates that the n redistribution was due to active mycelial transport rather than passive diffusion .
these results support earlier findings of fungal n import into decomposing litter [ 13 ] , [ 15 ] , which may substantially contribute to the net increases in n that are frequently detected in decomposing litter during early stages of decay [ 2 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 28 ] .
during the second or third year of decomposition , the total n pool generally decreases [ 11 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , something that has often been interpreted as release of n to the soil solution .
instead , this decrease may be accounted for by reallocation of n from the old litter to support mycelial colonization of new substrates , in concordance with the lower n pool of old litter in our connected systems ( fig. 4 ) .
however , we found no support for increased decomposition of the new litter in response to this redistribution of n. this indicates that the increased fungal growth stemmed from more efficient c utilization ( fig. 7 ) rather than increased c acquisition , further highlighting the n - limitation of the fungi .
we further hypothesised ( ii ) that c would be reallocated from fresh litter to well degraded litter , increasing fungal growth and needle decomposition in the old litter .
we did not determine c translocation explicitly , but stagnating fungal growth in the old litter after addition of new litter , indirectly refutes our hypothesis .
in fact , biomass in the old litter even appeared to decrease , most likely due to autolysis and enzymatic self - degradation in order to recycle n [ 31 ] .
thus , rather than supporting mycelial growth in old litter , addition of new litter led to redistribution of fungal biomass and n ( fig. 4 ) and reduced decomposition of the old litter .
similarly , decay rates of wood blocks by wood decomposing fungi have been found to decrease in response to colonization of fresh substrates [ 32 ] .
this redistribution of fungal growth most likely occurred in response to the higher relative quality of the new litter .
old litter colonized by gymnopus approached 35 % loss of needle c after 5 months of incubation in the laboratory , which corresponds to mass loss observed after approximately 1.3 years in the field [ 2 ] .
nevertheless , isolated litter bags could support additional fungal growth during the second incubation period .
thus , the fungi were still capable of utilizing the old litter , but reallocated their growth and activity to newly added litter when this was available .
the observation that n - limited decomposer fungi may leave residual but potentially usable c has important implications for our understanding of c sequestration in forest ecosystems and may contribute to the discussion why not all c is degraded in soils [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] .
the concept of absolute recalcitrance of organic matter , i.e. that c accumulates in ecosystems because it is resistant to decomposition , has recently been challenged by schmidt et al .
[ 35 ] , who instead emphasise environmental and biological control of organic matter accumulation .
accumulation of old c when more attractive c - sources are available could be described in terms of a ' negative priming effect ' [ 36 ] and could potentially contribute to organic matter accumulation in the litter layers of boreal forests .
we found that the c - use efficiency of gymnopus increased due to addition of new litter ( fig. 7 ) , but this was not directly related to the better quality of the new litter , since the efficiency did not differ significantly between isolated litter - bags incubated for one or two periods .
rather , the higher c - use efficiency may be attributed to resource reallocation .
if degradation is driven by n demand , import of additional n into fresh litter could stimulate fungal growth without a concomitant increase in degradation , as here observed .
without extra n , c is available in excess of demand and is removed by respiration , leading to lower c - use efficiency [ 7 ] .
thus , redistribution of n may lead to better balanced c and n availability and a more efficient use of mobilised c. in fact , in systems inoculated with gymnopus , mycelial connection reduced overall needle decomposition by 6 % but increased fungal biomass by up to 19 % .
this highlights the fact that decomposer fungi have not evolved to maximize decomposition rates .
rather , maximizing growth and the potential to explore new substrates and ultimately produce fruit bodies may be the primary capability that promotes evolutionary success .
losses of dissolved n the observation that small amounts of n were lost to the sand solution in the studied systems , with a major fraction lost as high c : n ratio dissolved organic matter and only minute amounts as nh4 , is in agreement with the patterns of high n immobilisation rates generally observed in ecosystems of low productivity [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] .
the pool of total dissolved n in the sand could , however , not account for total n losses from the needle - mycelium complex .
presumably , some additional n may be attributed to fungal growth and particulate matter in the sand .
additions of n during the first incubation period decreased the relative losses of soluble organic matter per unit degraded c during the second period ( fig. 5 ) .
in fact , the absolute amounts of don released during the second incubation period were lower in systems that had received n during the first period .
addition of new litter also had a negative effect on soluble losses , suggesting that stimulation of fungal growth restricted n losses and lead to more efficient resource utilization .
in gymnopus , relatively high n - mineralization rates were found in isolated litter bag systems and in the basidiomycete species interaction systems compared to connected systems and single - species interaction systems .
thus , in un - connected systems where n could not be translocated away from old litter , c - limitation resulted in n - mineralization , but in connected systems , mineralization was minimal in agreement with our original hypothesis ( ii ) .
using agar cultures , we have previously showed that c translocation between spatially separated substrates may drastically reduce n - mineralization in mycelium growing on low c : n ratio medium [ 9 ] , [ 39 ] .
here , we corroborate that mycelial translocation may restrict n - mineralization also in more realistic systems with natural substrates of different qualities .
in undisturbed boreal forest ecosystems , coniferous litter decomposes over a long time period , maintaining a continuing supply of c. consequently , boreal litter decomposing fungi are not likely to release large amounts of inorganic nutrients for plant uptake [ 38 ] , [ 40 ] , contradicting the normally perceived role of saprotrophic microorganisms in n cycling .
instead , litter fungi appear to retain assimilated n in order to maximize biomass production in the upper litter layer .
mycelial n is also continuously lost to grazing soil fauna [ 41 ] .
residual n that the litter decomposers fail to reallocate presumably enters the humus pool in the form of fungal cell wall compounds stabilized in complex organic forms [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] .
n mobilisation from well degraded organic matter then has to rely on mycorrhizal fungi to support plant production from organic sources without previous mineralization [ 40 ] , [ 45 ] .
effects of interspecific interactions in the present study , interaction between the two basidiomycetes seemed to have prevented colonization of new litter by the fungus from the old litter ( fig. 3 , table 1 ) .
these systems , thereby , served as a ' non - translocation control ' with similar responses as in isolated litter bags , confirming our original hypothesis ( iii ) .
territorial behaviour and strong antagonism has been well described for wood decomposing fungi [ 19 ] .
indirect evidence of antagonism between litter degrading fungi has previously been presented by newell , [ 46 ] , who found that mycena galopus expanded its spatial niche upwards when the more surficial gymnopus was suppressed by selective grazing .
here we confirm that strong antagonism may take place between interacting litter basidiomycetes , with major negative effects on connectivity between resources .
however , dead - lock may not be a general outcome of interactions ; with other interacting species or a different balance in relative resource availability , interactions may likely result in over - growth of one species by another [ 19 ] , [ 47 ] , with a different outcome in terms of nutrient reallocation .
the presence of the ascomycete in new litter did not alter the behaviour of the basidiomycetes in any way ( table 1 ) , and it appeared to have a low competitive strength .
similar to many other litter colonising ascomycetes , the helotiales strain has previously showed limited degradation of cellulose and lignin [ 23 ] .
the ecological strategies by which helotialean ascomycetes co - exist in needles with highly territorial and more efficient basidiomycetes remain unclear .
high small scale diversity in fungal communities and the resulting multitude of interactions may act to alter nutrient reallocation , and when extrapolating to the field situation , the results of this laboratory study have to be considered in the context of fungal succession and community dynamics [ 18 ] , [ 48 ] .
c and n content of fungal mycelium the chitin to c conversion factors of 15.1 and 7.5 ( fig. 8 ) and fungal mycelial chitin contents of 3.3 and 6.7 % for gymnopus and mycena , respectively , fall within the same range as earlier estimates [ 49 ] , [ 50 ] .
the estimated c : n ratios of 30 and 32 for the mycelium of gymnopus and mycena , respectively , are much higher than the ratio of 10 - 15 generally stated for soil fungi [ 51 ] .
nevertheless , boddy & watkinson [ 52 ] report a c : n ratio of 35 for a typical wood decomposing fungus , and the c : n ratio of mycorrhizal fungi has been estimated to be 20 [ 53 ] .
in addition , the n - content of fungal mycelium may show a high degree of plasticity depending on environmental conditions [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] .
in the glass wool bundles , the correlations between chitin and both c and n in mycelium of gymnopus were strong ( fig. 7 ; r2 = 0.91 and r2 = 0.89 ) .
estimated using the chitin to n factor , fungal biomass n constituted between 32 % of the total n pool in isolated bags without n after 5 months incubation and 55 % in old litter of connected systems after 10 months incubation .
together with the high proportion of don in the sand solution derived from mycelium ( 60 %) , these data indicate that a large fraction of the n in the needles had been assimilated by the fungus at the end of the experiment , again highlighting the n - limitation of the fungi .
the c - use efficiencies estimated for gymnopus and mycena in these microcosm systems were 25 % and 16 % , respectively .
these estimates depend heavily on the chitin to c conversion factors and should , thus , be regarded as rough estimates .
the estimated c - use efficiencies are comparable to the efficiency rates of 28 - 34 % found in mycena galopus decomposing deciduous litter [ 50 ] .
conclusions we here show that the capacity of litter decomposing fungi to translocate resources can have a major influence on storage and release of c and n in interacting litters .
when different litter c pools interacted through fungal connections , older more decomposed litter was left behind due to a relative difference in quality rather than due to absolute recalcitrance .
such preferential decomposition of high quality c may take place when decomposer fungi experience over - all n - limitation. from an ecosystem point of view , this phenomenon could potentially contribute to organic matter accumulation in the litter layers of boreal forests .
n mineralization and don release was minimized in the presence of fresh litter , suggesting that fungal litter degraders primarily act to redistribute rather than release n in boreal forests .
this reductionistic laboratory study highlights properties of decomposer systems dominated by translocating fungi that , if properly represented , may improve the predictive power of quantitative ecosystem models .
our results raise new hypotheses that call for further exploration under more realistic field conditions .

test the therapeutic efficacy of sapylin in resolving persistent congenital chylothorax ( cc ) in four infants who failed to respond to conservative medical therapy including erythromycin and / or octreotide management .
all cases were cured and have no adverse reactions during follow - up. the result shows sapylin is effective in reducing chylous production .
key words chylothorax chemical pleurodes infant sapylin introduction congenital chylothorax ( cc ) is a rare disease and a cause of respiratory distress with major nutritional and immunological consequences .
therefore , it is critical to decrease pleural effusion promptly .
management of cc necessitates a multidisciplinary approach .
conservative management prior to surgical approach in the treatment of chylothorax cases .
the common conservative treatment for persistent cc is often futile .
recently , octreotide and chemical pleurodesis were used to treat the persistent cc. however , the systematic study in literature for octreotide therapy is limited and the efficacy of octreotide treatment is vary .
in addition , octreotide has many side effects .
chemical pleurodesis is a method to treat cc through injecting the chemical agent into chest , which could induce the chemical pleural inflammation and adhesions , prompt the pleural cavity closure and prevent the chyle leakage .
the analogs of sapylin , ok - 432 was used for malignant pleural effusion and lymphatic tumor treatment in the past.1,2 here , we report the therapeutic effect of intrapleural instillation of sapylin on persistent cc in four cases .
case report the 2nd affiliated hospital & yuying children 's hospital of wenzhou medical university institutional review board approved this investigation and informed consents were obtained from the parents of all the infants in this study .
all procedures performed in the study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and / or national research committee and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards .
a retrospective review was performed , examining the medical records of all kids who had received sapylin ( group a streptococcus preparation , 1ke , shandong lukang pharmaceutical group luya co. ltd , china ) intrapleural injection for the treatment of persistent cc over a 43 - month period between 2011 and 2014 .
diagnosis of chylous effusion in infants was based on findings of fluid with a milk - like appearance , a concentration of triglycerides in pleural effusion > 1.1 mmol / l , and a total cell count > 1000 cells / microl , with a lymphocyte fraction > 80 % .
the bacterial culture of effusion was sterile .
baseline patient characteristics and the treatment data in four infants are listed in table - i. sapylin treatment was identified in patients who met our inclusion criteria , which was resistant to mainly conservative treatment including erythromycin and / or octreotide therapies in three weeks .
the drainage tube was closed for 6 - 8 hour after sapylin dissolved in 10ml of 10 % glucose solution was injected into thoracic cavity .
clinical cure was defined as a decrease in chylothorax drainage < 5ml / kg / day and resolution of the chylothorax .
there was no mortality and all patients survived .

diagnosis and treatment of this patient was as follows : after the admission diagnosis of cc , we carried out the thoracic drainage and total parenteral nutrition , but the chest drainage was not reduced .
injection of erythromycin into thoracic cavity was still invalid and we performed thoracotomy and ligation of thoracic duct after about 4 weeks of admission .
we added a drainage tube after operation because of wrapped effusion , but the amount of fluid did not reduce .
we injected sapylin into pleural cavity in the postoperative day of 7 , 8 and the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) occurred after 3 days .
the spo2 maintains through the way of endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation , and raise up to 90 %(>) after plus peep and inhaling nitric oxide .
after one week , the ards was alleviated and the chest drainage was significantly reduced .
the patient finally cured after 1 month .
fig.1 the clinical course of treatment with sapylin manifestating on cxr ( a ~ i ) in a sample responder ( patient 4 ). a. admission ; b. after three weeks of conservative treatment ; c. after ligation of thoracic duct ; d. another chest tube was placed , e. ards after sapylin was given ; f. ards was relieved after 1 week ; g. after weaning from the ventilator and taking off the chest tube ; h. a month after discharge ; i .
1 year after discharge .
the emergence of ards due to using sapylin for two consecutive days in patient no 1 .
fortunately , the patient was out of danger after treatment .
it also provides clinical experience for future treatment .
in patient no 2 ~ 4 , sapylin was used twice but within intervals of three days .
the dosage was always 0.1 - 0.2ke / kg / day .
the result shows no side effect was observed in these cases .
after discharge , four patients were traced for follow - up from 6 months to two years without recurrence , and all of them achieved age appropriate developmental milestones .
discussion the treatment of persistent cc is still a challenge in clinic.3 there is no standard choice between conservative treatment and surgery .
early surgical interventions or conservative treatment is still worth discussing .
surgery may lead to a high number of thoracotomies and conservative treatment certainly increase hospitalization time.4,5 recently , there are few studies about octreotide treatment in cc , but the effects were reported inconsistently .
many case reports have shown octreotide is safe without side effect.6 however , maayan - metzger et al.7 reported that somatostatin treatment of cc may induce transient hypothyroidism in newborns .
no practice recommendation could be made based on current limited studies .
in our study , three patients treated with octreotide did not achieve the expected effect in 1 - 2 weeks , although it may be related to the cases we selected .
nevertheless , it indicated the effectiveness of octreotide is not as high as it has been reported .
chemical pleurodes is an efficient way to treat cc. under conditions of the persistent and refractory cases , even post - operation , pleurodesis might be the only method , like riquet et al.8 reported .
deurloo et al.9 even evaluated the effect of prenatal therapeutic interventions on perinatal outcome in pregnancies complicated by isolated fetal hydrothorax with hydrops , and found pleurodesis is worth to be recommended .
sapylin , the new medicine , may facilitate pleurodesis by activation of natural killer cells and t cell - inducing cytokine production , stimulating fibrin adhesion , and producing a strong inflammatory response .
four patients who failed to respond to traditional conservative medical therapy were treated with sapylin , and all cases were cure .
the result shows sapylin was more effectively than erythromycin and / or octreotide .
this treatment may reduce the need for surgery significantly , and may be an effective remedy in those cases who have surgical contraindications .
however , sapylin is not side effect free .
we suggest the dosage of sapylin should be 0.1 - 0.2ke / kg / day and intervals should be over three days .
it takes at least three days or longer for sapylin intraperitoneal injection to show the side effect .
saplin is also contraindicated for those patients who are allergic to penicillin , immunocompromised , with heart or kidney disease , rheumatism .
a prospective multicenter randomized controlled study is also required to assess the safety and efficacy .
in recent years , the prognosis of cc has been improved since the development of medical technology and the nutrition interventions .
ergaz et al.10 evaluated the post - discharge clinical and developmental course of 11 neonates with cc , and concluded the recovery from chylothorax and future prognosis were dependent on the underlying etiology .
our patients were followed up from 6 months to two years and this progress will be continue .

purpose the pathophysiological role of human chitinases and chitinase - like proteins ( clps ) is not fully understood .
we aimed to determine the levels of neutrophil - derived chitotriosidase ( chit1 ) , acidic mammalian chitinase ( amcase ) and chitinase 3 - like protein 1 ( ykl - 40 ) in patients with type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) and verify their association with metabolic and clinical conditions of these patients .
methods neutrophils were obtained from the whole blood by gradient density centrifugation from 94 t2d patients and 40 control subjects .
the activities of chit1 and amcase as well as leukocyte elastase ( le ) were measured fluorometrically and concentration of ykl - 40 immunoenzymatically .
also , routine laboratory parameters in serum / plasma were determined by standard methods .
results the levels of all three examined proteins were about 2 - times higher in diabetic patients in comparison to control subjects .
they were significantly correlated with the activity of le and increased progressively across tertiles of le activity .
moreover , the activities of chit1 and amcase were significantly correlated with each other .
metabolic compensation of diabetes did not influence the levels of these proteins .
in the subgroup of patients with inflammatory evidence only ykl - 40 concentration was significantly higher compared to those without inflammation .
the highest levels of all three proteins were observed in patients with macroangiopathies .
insulin therapy was associated with lower levels of examined proteins .
conclusions we revealed that neutrophils may be an important source of the increased levels of chitinases and clps in t2d , and these proteins may participate in inflammatory mechanisms in the course of the disease and consequent development of diabetic angiopathies .

introduction the evolutionarily conserved glycosyl hydrolase 18 family ( gh18 ) contains a few chitinases and chitinase - like proteins ( clps ) that are expressed in mammals .
intriguingly , although endogenous chitin has not been identified in humans , two enzymatically active chitinases , chitotriosidase ( chit1 ) and acidic mammalian chitinase ( amcase ) , as well as at least three proteins with chitin - binding ability , but without chitinase activity , such as chitinase 3 - like protein 1 ( termed as ykl - 40 or human cartilage glycoprotein - 39 ) , have been found in different human cells [ 1 ] .
chitotriosidase is produced mainly by monocyte - derived macrophages and is an established marker of macrophage accumulation in lysosomal storage diseases ( especially in gaucher disease ) [ 2 ] .
it may also be synthesized by neutrophils and released from the specific granules upon stimulation [ 3 ] .
acidic mammalian chitinase is produced mainly by macrophages and lung epithelial cells at sites of th2 - mediated inflammation , associated with eosinophil recruitment [ 4 ] .
presence of this enzyme in neutrophils has not yet been described .
ykl - 40 is known to be expressed in macrophages ( but not in monocytes ) , as well as in neutrophils , chondrocytes , and tumor cells .
it has been considered as a macrophage differentiation marker , which may contribute to the cellular response induced by proinflammatory cytokines , such as interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) and the migration factor for vascular smooth muscle cells [ 5 ] .
moreover , ykl - 40 stimulates the proliferation of human connective tissue cells ( such as fibroblasts ) [ 6,7 ] .
currently , the exact physiological role of proteins from gh18 in humans is not fully understood .
one hypothesis assumes that active chitinases are induced at sites of infection as part of an innate defense against chitin - containing pathogens , while chitinase - like proteins are involved in signaling pathways during cell proliferation and differentiation [ 1,8 ] .
an increasing number of investigations have provided evidence that the levels of these proteins are increased in a variety of diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling .
for example , it was revealed that increased plasma levels of chit1 and ykl - 40 , derived from macrophages , are associated with atherosclerotic plaque formation [ 9 - 11 ] .
diabetes mellitus type 2 ( t2d ) is a metabolic disease associated with obesity and consequent insulin resistance , which induce the inflammatory signaling cascade leading further to progression of metabolic disturbances and development of vascular late complications [ 12,13 ] .
macrophages are the primary cell type in the inflammatory response in t2d , although engagement of neutrophils ( also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes , pmns ) is also important .
neutrophils are recruited to adipose tissue and endothelium , where they release enzymes and various pro - inflammatory mediators , which are important factors in vascular damage in diabetes [ 14 ] .
there are many reports about functional impairment of neutrophils under prolonged hyperglycemia conditions [ 15 ] .
however , data about the enzymatic profile of diabetic neutrophils are still ambiguous .
a recent study showed involvement of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance via the proteolytic action of leukocyte elastase ( le ) [ 16 ] .
in our previous work we also observed increased activity of various neutrophilic enzymes , including le , in patients with t2d [ 17 ] .
presence or activity of proteins from gh18 derived from neutrophils of diabetic patients has not yet been examined .
the aim of this study was to evaluate levels of selected chitinases and clps from polymorphonuclear leukocytes , both in healthy individuals and in patients with type 2 diabetes , as well as to evaluate whether the level of these proteins may be associated with insufficient diabetes control and vascular complications .
materials and methods study population ninety - four patients with type 2 diabetes , treated in the clinic of angiology , hypertension and diabetology of wroclaw medical university , and forty adults with no abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism and no inflammatory states , as determined by a routine medical check - up , were recruited to the study .
control group subjects were matched for age , sex and bmi values with t2d patients .
diabetic patients had routine biochemical parameters , such as glucose , glycated hemoglobin ( hba1c ) , total cholesterol and its fraction , triglycerides ( tg ) , total white blood cell ( wbc ) count and c - reactive protein concentration ( crp ) measured upon admission to the hospital .
all participants gave written informed consents to participate in the study .
cell purification venous blood was collected after an overnight fast in standard vacuum tubes with heparin ( sarstedt ag & co , germany ) .
neutrophils were isolated immediately using gradisol g ( aquamed , poland ) , according to the procedure described previously [ 18 ] .
the isolated cells were suspended in 1 ml pbs , counted under a microscope using a burker chamber and stored at - 80degreesc until assayed .
the high purity ( 93 %) of the obtained neutrophil suspension was confirmed by histochemical staining .
the local bioethics committee of wroclaw medical university specifically approved this entire study .
protein assay and genotyping before the quantitative measurements of proteins from the gh18 family , neutrophils were disrupted by a triple freezing - thawing cycle to release the intracellular content and then centrifuged ( 250 g for 10 min at 4degreesc ) .
in the obtained supernatant enzymatic activity of chit1 and amcase as well as concentration of ykl - 40 were estimated .
chit1 and amcase activities were measured using fluorogenic substrates 4 - methylumbelliferyl - beta - n - n ' - n " - triacetylchitotriose and 4 - methylumbelliferyl - beta - n - n ' - diacetylchitobiose ( sigma chemical co , usa ) in citrate - phosphate buffers with different ph and ionic strength according to methods described previously by hollak [ 19 ] and boot [ 20 ] and modified according to our own kinetic studies ( data not shown ) .
briefly , to measure chitinolytic activity derived mainly from chit1 , 5 mul of samples were incubated with 100 mul of 0.022 mm substrate solutions in 100 mm citric acid and 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 5.5 ) .
similarly , to measure chitinolytic activity derived mainly from amcase , 5 mul of samples were incubated with 100 mul 0.022 mm substrate solutions in 200 mm sodium citrate , 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer ( ph 4.3 ) .
after 15 min incubation at 37degreesc , both reactions were stopped with the addition of 2 ml glycine - naoh buffer ( ph 10.6 ) .
fluorescence of liberated products was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 365 nm and 445 nm , respectively ( perkin elmer ls 50b , usa ) .
the enzyme activities were calculated using standard calibration curves , which were constructed by plotting the fluorescence readings against different concentrations of 4 - methylumbelliferone ( sigma chemical co , usa ) in the appropriate reaction buffers and expressed as nanomoles of converted substrate per 1 hour at the reaction conditions per 1x106 neutrophils within the sample .
moreover , activity of le was measured using the fluorogenic substrate meosuc - ala - ala - pro - val - nmec according to barrett [ 21 ] as described previously [ 17 ] and expressed as nanomoles of converted substrate per 1 minute at the reaction conditions per 1x106 neutrophils within the sample .
all measurements were performed in duplicate or triplicate .
tertiles of le activity ( t1 - t3 ) were calculated and patients were divided into three subgroups according to values of increasing le activity : tertile 1 ( t1 ) included values of le activity <= 62.01 nmol / min / 106 cells , tertile 2 ( t2 ) > 62.01 and <= 133.14 nmol / min / 106 cells , and tertile 3 ( t3 ) > 133.14 nmol / min / 106 cells .
concentration of ykl - 40 was measured using the microvue immunoenzymatic test ( quidel , usa ) and expressed in ng / 106 cells .
the genetic deficiency of chit1 , reflected by zero activity of this enzyme , was confirmed by detection of 24 - bp duplication in exon 10 of the chit1 gene as described by boot et al .
[ 22 ] in genomic dna extracted from neutrophils ( genematrix tissue dna purification kit , eurx , poland ) .
criteria of patients'assignment to subgroups achievement of treatment targets , recommended by current clinical practice guidelines for management of diabetes in poland , was the basis to assign patients to subgroups : a ) patients with good and poor glycemic control ( according to level of glycated hemoglobin , hba1c ) , b ) patients with good and poor lipid control ( according to concentration of total cholesterol , low - and high - density lipoprotein fractions and triglycerides ) , c ) patients with good and poor blood pressure control ( according to values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure ) [ 23 ] .
additionally , patients were assigned to subgroups based on : d ) concentration of c - reactive protein ( into patients with and without inflammatory states ) , e ) presence of diabetic angiopathies ( into patients with microangiopathies , macroangiopathies and both micro - and macroangiopathies ) and f ) received hypoglycemic treatment ( into patients treated with insulin alone , treated only with oral antidiabetic agents ( oad ) , mainly metformin , and treated with insulin and oad ) .
statistical analysis the statistical analysis was performed using statistica pl for windows ( version 10.0 ) .
data are expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation .
a nonparametric mann - whitney u test was used for comparison between patients and control subjects .
spearman rank correlations were used to test the mutual relationships of examined parameters .
differences between examined parameters in subgroups of patients divided according to various criteria were evaluated by the mann - whitney u test or analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by the multiple comparison post - hoc fisher test .
a p value below 0.05 was considered as statistically significant .
results after laboratory measurements 13 subjects were excluded from further analysis as they showed activity of chit1 and / or amcase at zero level .
finally , the examined population consisted of 85 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 36 control subjects .
levels of chitotriosidase , acidic mammalian chitinase and ykl - 40 in neutrophils of patients and control subjects are presented in fig 1 .
all examined proteins were about 2 - times higher in diabetic subjects than in the control group and all differences between these groups were statistically significant .
moreover , activity of le in diabetic subjects was about 6 - times higher in comparison to controls ( 131.54 vs. 21.95 nmol / min / 106 cells ) .
spearman correlation analysis revealed that examined gh18 proteins derived from diabetic neutrophils were significantly correlated with activity of le and the strongest relationship was showed by chit1 .
moreover , chit1 activity was closely associated with amcase activity , but not with ykl - 40 ( table 1 ) .

metabolic compensation of diabetes ( estimated by glycemic , lipid and blood pressure control ) did not significantly influence the levels of these proteins in neutrophils , but we observed slightly higher values of them in subgroups of poorly controlled patients .
enzymatic activities of chit1 and amcase were also only slightly increased in patients with inflammatory states in comparison to those without inflammation .
instead , ykl - 40 concentration was significantly , 1.7 - times higher in patients with increased crp concentration .
levels of examined proteins were also generally higher in patients with macroangiopathies when compared to those with microangiopathies , being the most differentiative for chit1 ( p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , patients treated with insulin alone had a lower level of chit1 , amcase and ykl - 40 in neutrophils than those treated with oad .
however , significant differences between all subgroups were observed only for chit1 activity .

discussion recently there has been increasing interest in studying the pathophysiological role of gh18 members in humans .
potential involvement of these proteins in diabetes type 2 and pathological conditions associated with the disease have been partially described in single studies .
serum chit1 activity is reported to predict endothelial dysfunction in patients with newly diagnosed , untreated and uncomplicated t2d , while plasma ykl - 40 is related with insulin resistance [ 24,25 ] .
our latest study confirmed increased plasma levels of chit1 and ykl - 40 also in patients with long - lasting t2d [ 26 ] .
however , it has not been determined whether polymorphonuclear neutrophils may be a source of these proteins in diabetes .
it was previously indicated that both chit1 and ykl - 40 are stored in specific granules of neutrophils in healthy individuals , but there is no information about amcase , and it is not known how metabolic conditions of diabetes may influence content of these proteins in neutrophilic granules [ 3,27 ] .
in the present study we observed the simultaneous , about twofold increase of all three proteins from gh18 , that is chit1 , amcase and ykl - 40 , in pmns of diabetic patients , when compared to healthy individuals .
our observations complement the insufficiency of knowledge about sources of gh18 proteins in diabetes type 2 and participation of these neutrophil - derived gh18 proteins in pathological conditions of the disease .
the increased chitinolytic activity revealed in our research , deriving mostly from chit1 and to a lesser degree from amcase , is quite inexplicable in view of the lack of natural substrates for chitinases in humans .
it is mentioned that these enzymes may be involved in inflammatory pathways and linked processes , but their role in diabetes remains unexplained [ 1,28,29 ] .
some authors have reported an association of increased chit1 activity with impaired glucose tolerance or insulin resistance , but without molecular insight [ 30,31 ] .
a study by lee et al [ 32 ] demonstrated that chit1 enhances transforming growth factor - beta ( tgf - beta ) in an animal model of fibrosis , raising the possibility of interactions between chit1 and tgf - beta also in other diseases , including diabetes .
the tgf - beta - dependent signaling pathway is for example responsible for podocyte damage in diabetic kidneys [ 33 ] .
zhu et al .
[ 34 ] showed that amcase induces the production of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( mcp - 1 ) and eotaxin - 1 in a murine model of asthma , suggesting pro - inflammatory action of this protein .
however , it was also demonstrated that amcase shows an anti - apoptotic effect towards airway epithelial cells and interestingly this action is independent from its chitinolytic activity [ 35 ] .
these observations indicate that chit1 and amcase are players in cell signaling upon inflammation .
in the present study we revealed a positive correlation of amcase with chit1 , which may testify that these chitinases cooperate with each other during the inflammatory response .
in studies about regulation of amcase and chit1 during macrophages maturation and differentiation , di rosa et al .
[ 36 ] indicated that amcase , unlike chit1 , showed increased expression both in classically activated macrophages ( inflammatory subtype ) and alternatively activated macrophages ( anti - inflammatory subtype ) .
it is very likely that expression of these proteins in neutrophils is also regulated by a different mechanism , which should be verified in further studies .
the significant increase of examined proteins in neutrophils of t2d patients , revealed in the present study , suggests that hyperglycemia or other diabetic conditions may promote synthesis of chitinases / clps in these cells .
it is known that chronic hyperglycemia disturbed some neutrophil functions , but it also exerts a " priming " effect , which is manifested by increased release of various pro - inflammatory cytokines , leading to a constitutively active state and subsequent recruitment of neutrophils and other immune cells .
in this way neutrophils participate in the activation and recruitment of macrophages ( the main source of gh18 proteins ) at the site of inflammation and their further differentiation into proinflammatory or anti - inflammatory subtype [ 14 , 37,38 ] .
in this aspect , content of neutrophilic granules , as well as " excretive " potential of neutrophils , creates an important issue in analyzing participation of these cells in the pathomechanism of type 2 diabetes and its complications .
the tendency to increase of gh18 proteins levels in diabetic neutrophils , revealed in the present study , is consistent with our previous investigations in plasma [ 26,39 ] .
in the present study we considered whether increased values of hba1c , lipid parameters or blood pressure may result in higher values of gh18 proteins .
most of the patients examined by us , although they received pharmacological treatment , did not achieve the treatment goals set by the polish diabetes association .
however , the performed analysis did not reveal any significant differences in the level of examined proteins between subgroups of patients with good and poor metabolic control .
it seems that levels of neutrophil - derived chit1 , amcase and ykl - 40 are independent of achievement of metabolic compensation of diabetes and their increase may be related to other biochemical pathways occurring in diabetes .
moreover , prevalence of chit1 mutations did not differ among the different subgroups .
however , before concluding that the chit1 genotype does not influence the disease severity , studies with more participants should be performed .
we also evaluated whether type of received hypoglycemic treatment may influence changes in the levels of gh18 proteins in neutrophils , and we revealed that patients treated with insulin had lower levels of these proteins .
however , it is not known if insulin has an in - vivo impact on neutrophil - enzyme expression or degranulation , and the mechanism by which insulin may decrease the level of gh18 proteins remains unknown .
we are planning to investigate the influence of insulin on synthesis of these proteins in neutrophils .
we also found that levels of chit1 , amcase and ykl - 40 were positively correlated with le and increased progressively with increasing activity of le. since le is considered as a marker of neutrophil activation , our results confirm that activated neutrophils are a source of these proteins in diabetes [ 40 ] .
furthermore , increased activity of le in diabetic neutrophils , as well as its association with poor short - term glycemic control and development of diabetic angiopathies , was previously revealed by us [ 17 ] .
in fact , le is able to degrade most components of the extracellular matrix , leading to destruction of the integrity of endothelial cells and damage of the vascular basement membrane .
in this light , the relationship we observed of all examined gh18 proteins with le may indicate their connection with progression of late vascular complications .
it is known that diabetic microangiopathies develop as a result of hyperglycemia - induced endothelial dysfunction , which leads to local metabolic and structural disturbances within small vessels and ultimately to vascular damage [ 41 ] .
we recently demonstrated that increased plasma chit1 and ykl - 40 are associated with diabetic nephropathy and may participate in the progression of vascular damage within glomeruli in diabetic patients [ 26 ] .
here , we revealed that the level of all three examined proteins was the highest in neutrophils of patients with macrovascular complications ( being the most significant for chit1 ) .
as it is known that macroangiopathies in t2d manifest as non - specific atherosclerosis , we suggest that increased levels of gh18 proteins , derived from neutrophils , are connected with inflammatory events triggering development of diabetic vascular complications , especially with an atherosclerotic background .
however , it should be mentioned that although levels of all examined proteins were higher in patients with inflammatory evidence , only the concentration of ykl - 40 differed significantly between patients differentiated according to crp concentration .
moreover , despite simultaneous increase of chit1 and ykl - 40 in diabetic pmns , we did not reveal any significant correlation between these proteins , which means that their increase was independent , suggesting distinct roles of these two proteins .
currently it is unknown whether differences in enzymatic activity of gh18 proteins can determine their physiological functions .
however , chitinolytic potential of chit1 and amcase leads to the assumptions that , apart from chitin , some still unrevealed targets may exist for human chitinases .
only recently , larsen et al .
[ 42 ] showed that n,n ' - diacetyllactosamine - terminated saccharides are hydrolyzed by chit1 .
so far , such structures have not been shown in diabetes , but constantly expanding panel of potential substrates for chitinases suggest that other unexpected targets cannot be excluded .
for example , it was assumed that glcnac containing glycomolecules , such as glycosaminoglycans that are structurally similar with chitin , may be hydrolyzed by chitinases [ 1 ] .
negatively charged glycosaminoglycans are present on the endothelial cells surface and their reduced content , observed in diabetic patients , is postulated to be a pathogenic factor for endothelial injury .
these could provide an interesting link between neutrophils - endothelial cells interactions and vascular inflammation .
however , currently it is not known , if chitinases may be responsible for changes in glycosaminoglycans level and this hypothesis needs to be supported by appropriate research .
in summary , our investigations of " chitinolytic " profile of diabetic pmns indicate that neutrophil - derived chitinases and chitinase - like proteins represent a novel group of molecules , which may participate in metabolic disturbances and inflammatory pathways in the course of type 2 diabetes , especially connected with development of vascular complications .
however , further studies in this area are needed to elucidate molecular cause - and - effect mechanisms of gh18 proteins .
primarily , a potential association of these proteins with markers of endothelial dysfunction should be examined .
we also designed ex vivo experiments , in which isolated neutrophils will be subjected to various stimulating factors , and we hope that the results of these investigations will help in finding an answer about the exact molecular pathway responsible for increased levels of gh18 proteins in type 2 diabetes .

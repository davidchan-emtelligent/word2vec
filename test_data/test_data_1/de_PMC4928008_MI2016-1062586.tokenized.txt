human fibroblast - like synoviocytes play a vital role in joint synovial inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) .
proinflammatory cytokines induce fibroblast - like synoviocyte activation and dysfunction .
the inflammatory mediator kruppel - like factor 4 is upregulated during inflammation and plays an important role in endothelial and macrophage activation during inflammation .
however , the role of kruppel - like factor 4 in fibroblast - like synoviocyte activation and ra inflammation remains to be defined .
in this study , we identify the notion that kruppel - like factor 4 is higher expressed in synovial tissues and fibroblast - like synoviocytes from ra patients than those from osteoarthritis patients .
in vitro , the expression of kruppel - like factor 4 in ra fibroblast - like synoviocytes is induced by proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor - alpha .
overexpression of kruppel - like factor 4 in ra fibroblast - like synoviocytes robustly induced interleukin - 6 production in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor - alpha .
conversely , knockdown of kruppel - like factor 4 markedly attenuated interleukin - 6 production in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor - alpha .
kruppel - like factor 4 not only can bind to and activate the interleukin - 6 promoter , but also may interact directly with nuclear factor - kappa b. these results suggest that kruppel - like factor 4 may act as a transcription factor mediating the activation of fibroblast - like synoviocytes in ra by inducing interleukin - 6 expression in response to tumor necrosis factor - alpha .
1. introduction the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is characterized by persistent synovial inflammation and progressive joint destruction .
several cell types have been implicated in its pathogenesis , including lymphocytes , monocytes , and fibroblast - like synoviocytes ( flss ) [ 1 - 3 ] .
flss , resident mesenchymal cells in the joint synovium , respond to proinflammatory stimuli including tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - alpha ) and interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and exhibit features of inflammatory cells contributing to the pathogenesis of ra [ 1 , 4 ] .
once activated , ra flss produce several types of cytokines and chemokines , including interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) , interleukin - 8 ( il - 8 ) , and macrophage inflammatory protein - 1 ( mip - 1 ) [ 5 - 7 ]. of these proinflammatory mediators , il - 6 is an acute - phase inflammatory cytokine that plays a crucial role in joint inflammation and augments bone erosion in ra [ 8 ] .
blockade of il - 6 signal transduction represents a potentially useful therapeutic strategy to ameliorate ra inflammation [ 9 , 10 ] .
given the importance of il - 6 in ra inflammation , identification of the molecular mechanisms regulating its expressions is of considerable importance .
induction of il - 6 by proinflammatory stimuli has been characterized and appears to occur mainly at the level of transcription .
several transcription factors have been implicated in this process [ 11 ] .
the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf - kappab ) is activated in response to proinflammatory stimuli in ra flss and induces il - 6 gene expression [ 12 ] .
kruppel - like factors ( klfs ) are a subclass of transcription factors that share homology with the drosophila gene kruppel [ 13 ] .
these proteins contain zinc finger domains , located at the c - terminus , which bind to either caccc elements or gc - boxes .
the n terminus of these proteins mediates activation or repression of transcription and other protein - protein interactions [ 14 ] .
kruppel - like factor 4 ( klf4 ) is a member of the klf family which was first found in the epithelial lining of the gut and skin and is involved in terminal differentiation and growth of epithelial cells [ 15 , 16 ] .
klf4 has also been found to regulate stem cell function , cell survival , proliferation , and differentiation [ 17 , 18 ] .
klf4 was recently implicated in the inflammation mediated by macrophages and endothelial cells [ 14 , 19 , 20 ] and is reported to be induced by several inflammatory stimuli and to play an important role in the production of inflammatory mediators .
for example , in macrophages , klf4 expression is upregulated in response to interferon - gamma ( ifn - gamma ) , lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) , and tnf - alpha and interacts with the nf - kappab family member p65 to cooperatively activate the promoter of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) [ 14 ] .
high - mobility group box 1 ( hmgb1 ) , an important late inflammatory cytokine during inflammation , participates in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammation and local inflammations , including sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis [ 21 , 22 ] .
it has been demonstrated that hmgb1 interacts with toll - like receptor - 2 ( tlr - 2 ) and toll - like receptor - 4 ( tlr - 4 ) to promote the activation of nf - kappab and mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapk ) , leading to production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophage and endothelial cells [ 23 - 25 ] .
recently , klf4 binds to the promoter of hmgb1 and promotes its expression , translocation , and release in raw 264.7 macrophages in response to lps stimulation [ 26 ] .
however , klf4 may also perform anti - inflammatory functions .
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) , klf4 induced anti - inflammatory and antithrombotic factors , including endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( enos ) and thrombomodulin ( tm ) , and inhibited expression of tnf - alpha - induced vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( vcam1 ) and tissue factor ( tf ) [ 19 ] .
therefore , the role of klf4 in inflammation appears to be pleiotropic and its proinflammatory or anti - inflammatory functions are cell - type dependent .
however , the role of klf4 in fls activation and ra inflammation remains to be defined .
in this study , we examined whether klf4 is expressed in synovial tissue and in flss isolated from ra patients and whether the proinflammatory cytokine tnf - alpha can induce expression of klf4 .
we also assessed the effect of klf4 on expression of the proinflammatory cytokine il - 6 in ra flss and the mechanism by which klf4 regulates il - 6 gene expression .
2. methods 2.1 .
tissue preparation and cell culture human synovial tissue samples were obtained from ra patients and osteoarthritis ( oa ) patients at joint replacement surgery .

3. results 3.1 .
klf4 expression in the human synovial tissues of ra patients we used real - time pcr and western blotting to investigate whether klf4 is expressed in the synovial tissues from patients with ra and oa .
klf4 expression was found in the synovial tissues from patients with both ra and oa , and klf4 expression was higher in ra than in oa ( figures 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b )) .
immunohistochemistry revealed that klf4 - positive cells in the synovial tissues from ra patients were found predominantly in the synovial lining ( figure 1 ( c )) .
to investigate whether this pattern of klf4 expression is reflected in cultured primary flss isolated from the synovial tissues from patients with ra and oa , we harvested total mrna and protein from these cells .
rt - pcr and western blotting verified that klf4 is expressed in cultured flss from patients with both ra and oa , and klf4 expression was higher in ra than in oa ( figures 1 ( d ) and 1 ( e )) .
immunofluorescence revealed that klf4 was localized in the nuclei of ra flss ( figure 1 ( f )) .
3.2 .
tnf - alpha induces klf4 and il - 6 gene expression in ra flss previous studies have demonstrated that klf4 is induced by proinflammatory stimuli in several cell types including macrophages and endothelial cells [ 14 , 19 ] .
however , the influence of proinflammatory stimuli on its expression in ra flss remains unclear .
to determine whether klf4 can be induced in human ra flss under inflammatory conditions , cells were treated with different doses of tnf - alpha for various periods of time .
we found that the level of klf4 mrna and protein rapidly increased in ra flss incubated with tnf - alpha ( 20 ng / ml ) within 24 h ( figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b )) .
the expression of klf4 mrna and protein was peaked after 3 h and 16 h incubation with tnf - alpha , respectively .
tnf - alpha elevated expression of both klf4 mrna and protein in a concentration - dependent manner .
maximal expression was observed in cells incubated with 20 to 40 ng / ml tnf - alpha ( figures 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d )) .
fls activation and inflammation in ra are associated with upregulation of several proinflammatory cytokines .
il - 6 is reported to be the key proinflammatory cytokine produced by flss in the ra synovium [ 33 ] .
thus , we analyzed the influence of tnf - alpha on il - 6 expression in flss .
as shown in figure 2 ( e ) , il - 6 mrna levels in flss were significantly increased after incubation with tnf - alpha for 1 to 6 h and peaked at 3 h. similarly , levels of il - 6 protein also increased significantly after incubation with tnf - alpha for 3 to 24 h and peaked at 24 h ( figure 2 ( f )) .
the increase in the level of il - 6 corresponded well to the increase in the level of klf4 in ra flss induced by tnf - alpha , suggesting a relationship between these two proteins .
3.3 .
overexpression of klf4 increases il - 6 expression in ra flss because klf4 is induced by tnf - alpha and tnf - alpha - induced klf4 expression corresponded to tnf - alpha - induced il - 6 expression in ra flss , we considered the possibility that klf4 may regulate il - 6 expression .
in order to investigate the effect of klf4 on expression of il - 6 , ra flss were transfected with a pcdna3.1 - klf4 construct .
overexpression of klf4 induced significant increases in cellular content of both il - 6 mrna and protein in the absence of tnf - alpha ( figure 3 ) .
this effect was potently enhanced after tnf - alpha stimulation .
these data indicate that klf4 overexpression enhances expression of il - 6 in ra flss .
3.4 .
knockdown of klf4 decreases expression of il - 6 in ra flss to further assess the role of klf4 in regulating il - 6 expression , sirna was used to knock down klf4 expression in ra flss .
the level of il - 6 mrna and protein was significantly lower in sirna - transfected cells than in scrna - transfected cells , both in the presence and in the absence of tnf - alpha ( p < 0.05 ; figure 4 ) .
taken together , these results suggest that klf4 can regulate il - 6 expression in ra flss .
3.5 .
klf4 regulates il - 6 promoter activity in ra flss to understand the mechanism by which klf4 regulates il - 6 gene expression in ra flss , we investigated activation of the il - 6 promoter using a luciferase assay .
as shown in figure 5 ( a ) , klf4 transactivated the il - 6 promoter in ra flss .
il - 6 promoter activity was significantly higher in cells transfected with the klf4 expression plasmid than in cells transfected with empty vector , both in the presence and in the absence of tnf - alpha stimulation ( p < 0.05 ) .
to determine whether klf4 can bind the potential klf4 binding element on the il - 6 promoter , emsa experiments were performed using a biotinylated il - 6 probe for two segments of the il - 6 promoter ( - 109 to - 90 bp and - 132 to - 102 bp ) , which are hypothesized to be important for klf4 binding to the il - 6 promoter [ 32 ] .
as shown in figures 5 ( b ) and 5 ( c ) , klf4 binds to these two elements , and the addition of antibody against klf4 led to a supershift of the band .
the specificity of klf4 for the probe sequence was confirmed using mutant oligonucleotides and cold probes .
dna - protein binding was significantly increased after tnf - alpha stimulation for 1 or 2 h ( figures 5 ( d ) and 5 ( e )) .
taken together , these results indicate that klf4 interacts directly with the il - 6 promoter to regulate il - 6 expression .
3.6 .
klf4 potentially interacts with nf - kappab to induce the il - 6 promoter in response to inflammatory stimuli , the transcription factor nf - kappab has been demonstrated to induce il - 6 in ra flss [ 11 ] .
the klf4 binding sites on the il - 6 promoter are located in close proximity to the nf - kappab binding site .
therefore , we hypothesized that klf4 and nf - kappab may interact directly .
first , we investigated whether klf4 could enhance induction of il - 6 expression by nf - kappab - p65 .
we found that klf4 overexpression augmented the induction of the il - 6 promoter by nf - kappab ( figure 6 ( a )) .
next , we assessed whether klf4 mediates its effects via regulation of either nf - kappab expression or nuclear translocation .
klf4 overexpression did not increase expression of p65 or its nuclear accumulation in response to tnf - alpha ( figure 6 ( b )) .
finally , we used coimmunoprecipitation studies to investigate whether klf4 and nf - kappab directly interact .
nuclear extracts were probed with antibodies directed towards nf - kappab - p65 or klf4 , and we found that klf4 was present in the complexes immunoprecipitated by the anti - nf - kappab - p65 antibody ( figure 6 ( c )) .
conversely , nf - kappab - p65 was present in complexes precipitated by the anti - klf4 antibody .
taken together , our findings suggest that klf4 interacts physically with nf - kappab to cooperatively induce the il - 6 promoter .
4. discussion flss play a crucial role in joint inflammation and destruction in ra , mainly through production of proinflammatory cytokines .
several signaling pathways and transcription factors have been implicated in fls activation and inflammation associated with ra [ 11 , 34 ] .
recently , klf4 , a zinc finger - containing transcription factor , was reported to be involved in endothelial and macrophage - mediated inflammation [ 14 , 19 ] .
klf4 was initially found in the epithelial lining of the gut and skin and was considered to be an epithelium - specific transcription factor that is involved in normal development of epithelia and carcinogenesis [ 35 ] .
klf4 was also recently reported to be expressed in the monocyte / macrophage lineage [ 14 ] .
klf4 regulates not only monocyte commitment and differentiation [ 36 , 37 ] , but also macrophage activation .
klf4 overexpression in j774a macrophages induced the macrophage activation marker inos and reduced expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor - 1 [ 14 ] .
conversely , klf4 knockdown inhibited inos induction by ifn - gamma and / or lps , whereas it led to enhanced responsiveness to tgf - beta1 and smad3 signaling [ 14 ] .
in the raw246.7 macrophage cell line , klf4 has been shown to induce expression , translocation , and release of the late proinflammatory cytokine hmgb1 in response to lps [ 26 ] .
klf4 expression has been demonstrated in microglial cells , the resident macrophages of the central nervous system , and it is significantly induced by lps [ 30 ] .
klf4 knockdown in microglial cells reduced expression of tnf - alpha , mcp - 1 , il - 6 , inos , and cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) after induction by lps [ 30 ] .
similar to mouse cells , klf4 is markedly induced by proinflammatory cytokines including ifn - gamma , lps , or tnf - alpha and mediates proinflammatory signaling in human macrophages [ 14 ] .
several in vitro and in vivo studies [ 19 , 20 ] demonstrated that human and mouse endothelial cells from arterial and venous blood vessels also expressed klf4 , and klf4 was markedly induced by shear stress and inflammatory cytokines including tnf - alpha , il - ibeta , and interferon - gamma .
klf4 has been found to suppress inflammation by downregulating mcp - 1 , vcam , and tm and upregulating enos and tf in endothelial cells [ 19 ] .
recent studies showed that klf4 was highly expressed in thymocytes and mature t cells , and klf4 directly binds to the promoter of il - 17 and positively regulates its expression [ 38 ] .
the wide influence of klf4 on inflammatory cells spurred our interest in exploring the relationship between klf4 and ra. in this study , we established that klf4 was expressed in synovial tissue and cultured flss isolated from both ra patients and oa patients , and klf4 expression was higher in synovial tissue from ra patients than those from oa patients .
we also found that the proinflammatory cytokine tnf - alpha induced klf4 expression in ra flss in a time - and dose - dependent manner .
immunostaining revealed that klf4 is mainly localized to the nucleus , in accordance with previous reports that found klfs to be associated with specific regions of the nucleus , potentially with nucleoli [ 30 , 39 ] .
this data suggests that klf4 is a transcription factor localized in nuclear regions of active transcription and regulates target gene expression in ra flss .
our results suggest a possible role for klf4 in tnf - alpha - mediated inflammation in ra flss .
while our studies have demonstrated that klf4 expression was induced by tnf - alpha in ra flss in a dose - dependent manner , the relation between klf4 expression in flss and tnf - alpha level in vivo has not been elucidated .
further investigations will also be needed to determine whether medications , including dmargd or tnf inhibitors , affect klf4 expression in ra flss .
several cytokines and chemokines contribute to the progression and maintenance of inflammation in ra. of these , fls - derived il - 6 is considered to be crucially important and is therefore a target of ra drug development [ 12 , 40 ] .
il - 6 is a pleiotropic cytokine with a variety of biological activities including b - and t - cell activation , induction of autoantibody and peripheral blood platelet production , and release of acute - phase proteins [ 33 ] .
in fact , increased levels of il - 6 have been found in the serum and synovial fluid of ra patients , and il - 6 levels were closely associated with disease activity [ 41 - 44 ] .
il - 6 may both amplify the effects of tnf - alpha and il - 1 and stimulate the production of rheumatoid factors , acute - phase reactants , tissue - degrading enzymes , and other proinflammatory mediators [ 45 , 46 ] .
il - 6 has been well documented to play an indispensable role in ra inflammation , as blocking the il - 6 receptor can alleviate symptoms of ra [ 9 , 10 , 47 ] .
in addition to macrophages and dendritic cells , human flss produce il - 6 and are considered to be a main source of il - 6 in the ra synovium [ 33 ] .
il - 6 is spontaneously produced by cultured flss , and its expression is markedly upregulated by tnf - alpha [ 4 ] .
although tnf - alpha is a potent inducer of il - 6 production in human flss , the mechanism by which tnf - alpha induces il - 6 expression in flss remains unclear .
transcription factor nf - kappab was also reported to participate in regulation of il - 6 expression .
binding sites for nf - kappab have been identified in the promoter region of the il - 6 gene , and , under certain conditions , nf - kappab has been reported to activate transcription of the il - 6 gene and expression of il - 6 in ra flss [ 11 , 12 , 34 ] .
recently , the transcription factor klf4 was reported to be essential for the regulation of inflammatory mediator gene expression in the primordial mesenchymal cell lineage , thus controlling generation of lymphocytes [ 18 , 38 ] , macrophages [ 14 , 26 , 35 ] , and endothelial cells [ 19 , 20 ] .
using bioinformatics analysis , we found that the il - 6 promoter contains klf4 binding sites ( caccc ) .
importantly , we found that tnf - alpha - induced expression of klf4 corresponded to il - 6 expression in ra flss .
therefore , we hypothesized that klf4 might regulate il - 6 expression in ra flss .
in this study , we demonstrated that klf4 is essential for il - 6 production in ra flss. by experimentally overexpressing klf4 or using klf4 sirna to downregulate klf4 expression in ra flss , we found that expression of both il - 6 mrna and protein was significantly upregulated after klf4 overexpression and downregulated after klf4 knockdown in the presence or absence of tnf - alpha .
our results indicate that klf4 can promote il - 6 expression in ra flss , even under inflammatory conditions , suggesting that it may play a vital role in ra inflammation .
consistent with these proinflammatory effects , it has been reported that klf4 can induce expression of il - 6 in microglia and dendritic cells [ 32 ] .
however , in endothelial cells , klf4 has been reported to suppress expression of il - 6 [ 19 ] .
these observations indicate that the effect of klf4 on the regulation of il - 6 expression varies with cell type ; however , our findings indicate that , in flss , klf4 regulates il - 6 expression , and this activity is likely relevant to the induction of il - 6 observed in ra .
klf4 has previously been demonstrated to bind klf4 dna binding sites in the promoters of inos , tnf - alpha , il - 10 , mcp - 1 , hmgb1 , and il - 6 and to regulate expression of these inflammatory mediators [ 14 , 26 , 32 , 35 ] .
klf4 has been reported to activate the inos promoter in macrophages by binding klf4 binding sites at positions - 95 and - 212 bp [ 14 ] .
klf4 regulates hmgb1 expression in raw264.7 macrophages by binding the klf4 binding element in the hmgb1 promoter [ 26 ] .
in dendritic cell lines , klf4 activates expression of il - 6 primarily through binding to a proximal caccc site in the il - 6 promoter [ 32 ] .
in this study , we also demonstrated that klf4 regulates transcription of il - 6 in ra flss by binding to two klf4 binding elements in regions - 109 to approximately - 90 bp and - 132 to approximately - 102 bp from the transcriptional start site of the il - 6 promoter , and binding activity was enhanced after tnf - alpha stimulation .
these results suggest that klf4 regulates expression of il - 6 in ra flss by directly binding the il - 6 promoter .
the role of nf - kappab in the regulation of tnf - alpha - induced il - 6 expression in flss is well established .
interestingly , the klf4 binding sites in the il - 6 promoter are close to nf - kappab binding site [ 32 ] .
kaushik et al. previously demonstrated that klf4 interacts with pnf - kappab to cooperatively induce transcription of the inos and cox - 2 genes in microglial cells [ 30 ] .
we hypothesized that klf4 might exert its effects through direct interaction with other proteins such as nf - kappab in ra flss .
our results demonstrate that klf4 interacts directly with nf - kappab to induce the il - 6 promoter in ra flss .
we also considered the possibility that klf4 exerts its effects through promoting expression or nuclear translocation of nf - kappab .
however , we found that klf4 overexpression did not affect either the expression or the nuclear accumulation of nf - kappab in either the presence or the absence of tnf - alpha .
in addition , we did not find evidence that klf4 expression and klf4 - nf - kappab binding in ra flss were altered by increased nf - kappab expression ( data not shown ) .
therefore , our data suggest that klf4 is a binding partner of nf - kappab and coregulates il - 6 expression in flss from ra patients. of interest , contrary to our studies , klf4 inhibited tnf - alpha - induced expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule - 1 ( vcam1 ) through blocking the binding of nf - kappab to vcam1 promoter in cultured endothelial cells [ 48 ] .
these differences may lie in the different types of cells used for the experiments .
in addition , whether interaction of klf4 with additional factors influences the regulation of il - 6 expression in ra flss needs further investigation .
it has been shown that the interaction of hmgb1 and tlr4 leads to the activation of nf - kappab [ 23 , 24 ] .
it is possible that the hmgb1 - tlr4 pathway induces klf4 expression , which may subsequently result in enhanced activation of nf - kappab in flss .
5. conclusions in summary , we established klf4 to be a tnf - alpha - induced transcription factor that regulates expression of the key proinflammatory cytokine il - 6 in ra flss through both direct promoter activation and interaction with nf - kappab .
these results indicate that klf4 , which is induced by proinflammatory stimuli , can regulate flss activation and ra - associated inflammation .
studies on other target inflammatory mediator genes regulated by klf4 are currently underway .

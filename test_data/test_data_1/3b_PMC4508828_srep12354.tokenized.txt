conceptually similar to endofullerenes , host - guest carbon dots were designed and prepared with red / near - ir dyes encapsulated as guest in the carbon nanoparticle core .
beyond the desired enhancement in optical properties , the host - guest configuration may significantly broaden the field of carbon dots .
carbon dots ( also called carbon quantum dots in some literature reports despite the absence of classically defined quantum confinement ) have emerged as a new class of photoactive nanomaterials1234 , with their fluorescence properties resembling those typically found in conventional semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots ( qds ) 5 .
the structure of a carbon dot is relatively simple , generally a small carbon nanoparticle with various forms of surface passivation , among which the more effective has been the chemical functionalization with organic or polymeric species ( fig. 1 ) for carbon dots of bright fluorescence emissions4 .
in the green over the spectral region covered by green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) , for example , the performance of existing carbon dots in terms of fluorescence quantum yields in solution or the image brightness at the individual dot level on a substrate has been found to be competitive to that of the presently dominating cdse / zns qds6 .
according to available experimental results , carbon dots are nontoxic2347 , certainly without the toxicity concerns associated with the heavy metal - containing semiconductor qds .
therefore , there has been a growing interest in potential applications of carbon dots for fluorescence bioimaging in vitro and in vivo234789101112 .
however , despite the extensive effort in the relevant research community , the development of carbon dots of high fluorescence quantum yields in the biologically more significant near - ir spectral region has found only limited success .
this , combined with the generally lower absorptivity of carbon nanoparticles in the red / near - ir , suggests that new strategies are necessary in order to use the carbon dots platform for fluorescence probes of the desired red / near - ir performance .
in the work reported here we " borrowed " the concept from the field of endofullerenes13 by considering the core carbon nanoparticle in a carbon dot as a " solid - state pool " ( versus the cavity in a fullerene ) to trap or encapsulate chromophoric species of strong red / near - ir absorption and emissions .
this host - guest configuration takes advantage of the small carbon nanoparticle as host being optically largely transparent in the corresponding spectral regions , which has actually been identified above as a shortcoming of currently available carbon dots in their serving as red / near - ir probes .
the resulting host - guest carbon dots , denoted as g @ cdots ( fig. 1 ) , exhibited the desired absorption and fluorescence properties , as designed and expected .
results and discussion the thermal carbonization of organic precursors has been a popular approach for the synthesis of carbon dots234 , in which a portion of the precursor organic species is converted into carbon nanoparticles and the remaining serves the function of surface passivation agents .
among various thermal processing options is the use of microwave irradiation1415161718192021 , which in principle creates carbonized seeds for their preferential absorption of the subsequent microwave energy towards the formation of the targeted carbon dot structure of a carbon nanoparticle with organic species on the surface for passivation .
the microwave processing was adopted in this work for the " one - pot " synthesis of the g @ cdots , with g denoting the selected fluorescent dyes of cresyl violet ( cv ) , nile blue ( nb ) , and zinc phthalocyanine ( znpc ) .
experimentally for the synthesis of cv @ cdots , cv ( 20 mg ) in an ethanol solution was mixed well with oligomeric polyethylene glycol of molecular weight ~ 900 ( peg900 , 2 g ) , followed by the removal of ethanol via purging with nitrogen gas .
the resulting mixture was placed in a commercial microwave oven and irradiated at 300 w for 20 min .
then , water was added to the reaction mixture with sonication to obtain a dark colored aqueous solution .
the solution was centrifuged at 20,000 g , from which only a negligible amount of precipitate was observed and discarded .
the supernatant was dialyzed in a membrane tubing ( cutoff molecular weight ~ 1,000 ) against fresh water to remove unreacted starting materials and other small molecular species , yielding cv @ cdots in an aqueous solution .
the same processing protocol was applied to the preparation of nb @ cdots and znpc @ cdots , except that for the latter a 1:1 mixture of peg900 and oligomeric polypropionylethyleneimine instead of neat peg900 was in the mixture with znpc for microwave irradiation .
the sample solutions were used for optical spectroscopy measurements and microscopy characterization .
for all three host - guest carbon dots , the absorption spectra in aqueous solutions exhibited contributions from carbon nanoparticles ( more significantly in the blue / green spectral region , comparable with the absorption of carbon dots from the carbonization of peg900 without the dye encapsulation , fig. 2 ) and the guest dye molecules ( figs 2 and 3 ) .
however , the absorption bands of the encapsulated dyes are somewhat different from those of their corresponding free molecules , likely reflecting effects of the different environment in the hosting carbon nanoparticles .
for example , the absorption of the cv in cv @ cdots is much broader in comparison with that of the free dye molecules , both in aqueous solutions ( fig. 2 ) .
similar encapsulation effects were observed in fluorescence spectra of the host - guest carbon dots .
the spectra were found to be excitation wavelength dependent , as shown in fig. 2 for example , which might be as expected considering the solid - like environment around the guest dye molecules in the hosting carbon nanoparticles ( namely the molecules are each in a slightly different surrounding in a " solid - state solution " , a classical case for excitation wavelength dependent fluorescence emissions ) .
similarly for znpc @ cdots in aqueous solution excited at its absorption peak , the fluorescence band is broader and red - shifted from that of the free znpc molecules ( fig. 3 ) .
the aqueous solutions of the host - guest carbon dots were diluted for the preparation of specimens on mica substrate for atomic force microscopy ( afm ) characterization .
shown in fig. 4 are the results for cv @ cdots , nb @ cdots , and znpc @ cdots .
according to image height analyses , these host - guest carbon dots synthesized from thermal carbonization reactions are not as uniform in size as those from the surface chemical functionalization of pre - processed carbon nanoparticles reported previously622 , though still relatively narrowly distributed .
most of these host - guest carbon dots are small , with their overall size profiles on the order of 10 nm or less ( fig. 4 ) .
the carbon nanoparticle cores in the host - guest carbon dots are likely somewhat smaller than the overall dot profiles estimated from the height analysis of afm images , as the latter may also include contributions of the organic species on carbon particle surface that survived the thermal carbonization processing .
the expected significant contrast between the carbon core and surface organic species was exploited in the probing of the carbon nanoparticles by using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) .
for nb @ cdots as an example , the tem specimen was prepared such that a few drops of a dilute sample solution were deposited onto a silicon oxide - coated copper grid , followed by careful evaporation of the solvent .
the imaging experiments were performed on a high - resolution tem instrument ( hitachi h - 9500 ) .
the results shown in fig. 5 suggest that the nb - encapsulated carbon dots with residual peg molecules as surface passivation moieties ( confirmed by the significant peg carbon peaks in 13c nmr analyses ) are well - dispersed and that the carbon nanoparticle cores are size - wise small and relatively narrowly distributed .
for the host - guest carbon dots in aqueous solutions , the fluorescence quantum yields of the encapsulated dyes were evaluated against those of their free counterparts .
mechanistically , the observed fluorescence emissions from the guest dyes were due to their intrinsic electronic transition properties , not induced by the host carbon dots .
however , the carbon pool environment in the hosting carbon dots could have meaningful effects on the fluorescence properties of the guest dyes .
among the three selected dyes , cv is soluble in water23 , nb less so and only weakly fluorescent in an aqueous environment24 , and znpc soluble in organic solvents23 .
generally the results suggested that the fluorescence quantum yields of cv and nb as guests in the host - guest carbon dots were similar to those of free cv and nb molecules , respectively , all in aqueous solutions .
more specifically for cv , it is known in the literature that its fluorescence quantum yields in aqueous solutions are somewhat concentration dependent , higher in a more dilute solution , yet overall about 40 % lower than the yields in methanol25 .
the observed similar fluorescence quantum yields between the encapsulated and free cv molecules might be due to the opposing effects of a relatively higher cv concentration and more non - aqueous environment in cv @ cdots , which decreases and enhances the quantum yields , respectively .
however , for nb @ cdots in an aqueous solution , the estimated fluorescence quantum yields of the guest nb were higher than that of free nb molecules in water ( on the order of 0.01 ) 24 but still significantly lower than that in ethanol ( around 0.27 ) 23 , probably suggesting that the environment for the encapsulated nb is not entirely free from water .
similarly , the fluorescence quantum yields of znpc as guest in the host - guest carbon dots in an aqueous solution were also significantly lower than those of free znpc molecules in organic solvents , likely also due to the exposure of the encapsulated znpc to water ( because the znpc fluorescence in a polar organic solvent is apparently quenched efficiently by the addition of water ) .
therefore , in further investigations the fluorescence properties of these water - sensitive dyes may be used to study the local environment in the core carbon nanoparticles in the host - guest carbon dots .
experimentally , more effort is needed to correct the light scattering effect in aqueous solutions of the host - guest carbon dots for a more accurate determination of the fluorescence quantum yields of the encapsulated dyes .
conceptually similar to endofullerenes that have expanded the horizons of the fullerene field13 , the host - guest carbon dots represent a new qd - like nanoarchitecture for materials properties and functions beyond those achieved with the original carbon dots .
the extension of absorption and fluorescence coverage of carbon dots into the red / near - ir spectral regions with the relevant dyes as guest in this work serves as a representative example for the potential and versatile nature of the host - guest carbon dots platform .
such a new platform is expected to significantly broaden the reach of the already rapidly advancing carbon dots research and development .

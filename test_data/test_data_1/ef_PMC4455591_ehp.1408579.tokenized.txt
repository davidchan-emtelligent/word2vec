background trihalomethanes ( thms ) and haloacetic acids ( haas ) are regulated disinfection by - products ( dbps ) ; their joint reproductive toxicity in drinking water is unknown .
objective we aimed to evaluate a drinking water mixture of the four regulated thms and five regulated haas in a multigenerational reproductive toxicity bioassay .
methods sprague - dawley rats were exposed ( parental , f1 , and f2 generations ) from gestation day 0 of the parental generation to postnatal day ( pnd ) 6 of the f2 generation to a realistically proportioned mixture of thms and haas at 0 , 500x , 1,000x , or 2,000x of the u.s. environmental protection agency 's maximum contaminant levels ( mcls ) .
results maternal water consumption was reduced at >= 1,000x ; body weights were reduced at 2,000x .
prenatal and postnatal survival were unaffected .
f1 pup weights were unaffected at birth but reduced at 2,000x on pnd6 and at >= 1,000x on pnd21 .
postweaning f1 body weights were reduced at 2,000x , and water consumption was reduced at >= 500x .
males at 2,000x had a small but significantly increased incidence of retained nipples and compromised sperm motility .
onset of puberty was delayed at 1,000x and 2,000x .
f1 estrous cycles and fertility were unaffected , and f2 litters showed no effects on pup weight or survival .
histologically , p0 ( parental ) dams had nephropathy and adrenal cortical pathology at 2,000x .
conclusions a mixture of regulated dbps at up to 2,000x the mcls had no adverse effects on fertility , pregnancy maintenance , prenatal survival , postnatal survival , or birth weights .
delayed puberty at >= 1,000x may have been secondary to reduced water consumption .
male nipple retention and compromised sperm motility at 2,000x may have been secondary to reduced body weights .

2015. reproductive toxicity of a mixture of regulated drinking - water disinfection by - products in a multigenerational rat bioassay .
environ health perspect 123:564 - 570 ; http :// dx.doi.org / 10.1289 / ehp.1408579 introduction disinfection of drinking water is important in controlling microbial contamination in tap water and has proven to be a major advancement in public health .
however , oxidizing disinfectants react with organic materials in the water , forming complex mixtures of disinfection by - products ( dbps ) .
although > 600 unique dbps ( halogenated and nonhalogenated ) have been identified , approximately 50 % of the mass of the halogenated dbps remain unidentified .
epidemiological and animal toxicity studies have suggested that chlorination by - products may increase risk of adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes such as low birth weight , birth defects , spontaneous abortion , and stillbirth ( grazuleviciene et al. 2013 ; levallois et al. 2012 ; nieuwenhuijsen et al. 2009 ) .
however , inconsistent findings among epidemiological studies have yielded uncertainty regarding these associations ( hrudey 2009 ) .
the most prevalent dbps in chlorinated water are trihalomethanes ( thms ) and haloacetic acids ( haas ) ( krasner et al. 2006 ; weinberg et al. 2002 ) .
four of the thms ( chloroform , bromodichloromethane , chlorodibromomethane , and bromoform ) are regulated by the u.s. environmental protection agency ( epa ) in drinking water as a group ( i.e. , the concentrations of the individual dbps are summed ) at 80 mug / l , whereas five of the haas ( chloroacetic , dichloroacetic , trichloroacetic , bromoacetic , and dibromoacetic ) are regulated as a group at 60 mug / l ( u.s. epa 2006 ) .
these maximum contaminant levels ( mcls ) are based on cancer data .
both classes of chemicals are regulated as a rolling annual average , that is , average levels over the previous four quarters are calculated each quarter .
although thms and haas have been evaluated individually for adverse reproductive and developmental effects , there are very limited examples of reproductive toxicity assessment of any mixtures involving these regulated dbps ( narotsky et al. 2011 ) .
to our knowledge , these dbps have never been evaluated for reproductive toxicity in the way they are regulated - - as defined mixtures of the four regulated thms and the five regulated haas in drinking water .
thus , using chemical proportions seen following water treatment by chlorination , we sought to assess the combined reproductive toxicity of the nine regulated chlorination dbps in a multigenerational study in rats .
materials and methods chemicals .
chloroform ( lot no. 094k3725 , purity >= 99 %) was obtained from sigma , bromodichloromethane ( batch no .
30832 , purity >= 98 %) was obtained from supelco , and dibromoacetic acid ( lot no. 1126501 , purity 99.1 %) was obtained from fluka .
chloroacetic acid ( lot no. 05715pc , purity 99 %) , chlorodibromomethane ( lot no. 03113bc , purity 98 %) , and bromoform ( lot no. 13411hc , purity >= 99 %) were obtained from aldrich .
dichloroacetic acid ( lot no. 13421hc , purity >= 99 %) , trichloroacetic acid ( lot no .
015k0601 , purity 99.9 %) , and bromoacetic acid ( lot no .
07216lc , purity >= 99 %) were obtained from sigma - aldrich .
the vehicle was 0.25 % alkamuls ( r ) el - 620 ( lot no. sp1f090390 ; rhodia inc. ) in reverse - osmosis purified deionized water .
concentrations of each component dbp are listed in table 1 .
chemical proportions were based on those reported at the water utility that provided water for our whole - mixture toxicity studies ( narotsky et al .
2012 , 2013 ) ; these proportions were held constant across dose levels ( 0 , 500x , 1,000x , or 2,000x of the mcls ) .
overall dose levels were selected based on results of a preliminary dose - range - finding study with pregnant and lactating rats .

mixtures were prepared twice weekly .
prior to addition of thms to the dosing solutions , ph was adjusted to values of 6 - 7 using sodium hydroxide .
dosing formulations not immediately placed on cages were stored at 4degreesc in light - protected polyethylene carboys .
animals and husbandry .
timed - pregnant sprague - dawley rats ( charles river laboratories , raleigh , nc ) were obtained on gestation day ( gd ) 0 .
gd 0 was defined as the day that evidence of mating ( copulatory plug or vaginal sperm ) was detected .
the dams , weighing 165 - 245 g and 10 - 14 weeks of age , were housed individually in polycarbonate cages .
at weaning , male progeny were housed two per cage and females were housed three per cage .
dams and weanlings were uniquely identified with eartags and provided heat - treated pine shavings for bedding .
animal rooms were maintained on a 12 / 12 - hr light / dark cycle ( lights on at 0600 hours ) .
room temperature and relative humidity were maintained at 22.2 +/ - 1.1degreesc and 50 +/ - 10 % , respectively .
feed ( formulab diet 5008 ; pmi ( r ) labdiet ( r )) and drinking water were provided ad libitum .
water was provided in amber glass bottles with teflon ( r ) - lined caps and stainless steel sipper tubes equipped with stainless steel ball bearings .
animals used in this study were treated humanely and with regard for the alleviation of suffering .
procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee , and animals were maintained in a facility certified by the american association for the accreditation of laboratory animal care .
experimental design .
twenty - five parental ( p0 ) animals were assigned to each treatment group using a nonbiased randomization procedure that assured a homogeneous distribution of body weight ( narotsky et al. 1997 ) .
the designated dbp mixture was the sole source of drinking water for the animals in each treatment group .
control animals received vehicle .
the dams were exposed to their designated water through the weaning of their litters .
the progeny ( f1 generation ) continued their exposure past puberty and breeding , through gestation of the f1 females , and up to postnatal day ( pnd ) 6 of the f2 litters ( see supplemental material , figure s1 ). procedures .
body weights and water consumption .
body weights were recorded at least twice per week throughout the experiment .
water consumption for each cage was also recorded at least twice per week. parturition .
beginning on gd20 , dams were observed periodically to determine the time of parturition .
the stage of parturition ( completed , in progress , first pup delivered ) was also recorded .
litter examinations .
f1 litters were examined on pnds 0 ( day of birth ) , 6 , 13 , 21 , and 26 .
f2 litters were examined on pnds 0 and 6 .
on pnd0 , pups were examined for evidence of nursing ( i.e. , abdominal milk bands ) and were sexed , counted , and weighed .
in addition , 15 f1 litters each from the control group and the high - dose group ( 2,000x ) were selected randomly , and the anogenital distance ( agd ) of each pup was measured as described previously ( narotsky et al. 2013 ) .
on pnd6 , pups were again sexed , counted , and weighed .
f1 litter sizes were reduced on pnd6 to a maximum of 10 pups ( 5 males and 5 females when possible ) .
on pnd13 , each f1 pup was examined for eye opening and nipple retention , as described previously ( narotsky et al. 2013 ) .
on pnd21 , f1 pups were sexed and weighed .
because of low pup weights in the high - dose group , weaning of all pups was delayed until pnd26 ; at this time pups were sexed , weighed , and weaned .
selection of weanlings .
f1 weanlings were randomly selected for different roles as the experiment continued ( see supplemental material , table s1 ). from each litter , one male and one female ( designated as " a " animals ) were selected for breeding to produce f2 litters .
an additional male and female (" b " animals ) were selected for examination of serum hormones at puberty ; the males were killed on pnd55 , whereas the females were killed on the day of vaginal opening ( vo ) .
a third female (" c ") was killed on the day of estrus for examination of serum hormones .
for 10 randomly selected litters per group , one male (" c ") was selected to provide epididymal sperm for in utero insemination , and another male (" d ") was bred to two untreated females .
pubertal examinations .
f1 animals were examined daily for onset of puberty .
females were examined for vo starting on pnd27 and were scored as closed , partially open , or fully open .
on the day of vo ( i.e. , when fully open ) , each female was weighed ; b - females were killed by decapitation and sera were collected for assay of progesterone , estradiol , and leptin .
males were examined for preputial separation ( pps ) starting on pnd34 .
males were weighed on the day of pps and daily on pnds 41 - 47 .
pps was scored as none , minimal , at least 50 % , or complete .
on pnd55 , b - males were weighed and killed , sera were collected for measurement of testosterone , and testes and epididymides were weighed and fixed ( narotsky et al. 2013 ) .
estrous cycles .
for 19 days beginning on pnd46 or pnd47 , daily vaginal smears of a - females were examined microscopically for vaginal cytology .
estrous cycles were classified as regular ( 4 or 5 days ) , extended , or abnormal ( goldman et al. 2007 ) .
during the third week of this period , pnds 57 - 65 , c - females were killed on the day of estrus and evaluated for serum levels of estradiol and progesterone .
selected c - females , 10 - 11 / group , were also evaluated for the number of released oocytes ; oviducts were excised and oocytes were flushed and counted as previously described ( perreault and mattson 1993 ). breeding .
following estrous cycle monitoring , each a - female was transferred to the cage of a randomly selected nonsibling a - male of the same treatment group for up to 14 days .
when evidence of mating ( copulatory plug or vaginal sperm ) was observed ( gd0 ) , the female was weighed and singly housed .
similarly , d - males were cohabited with two untreated females for up to 7 days .
these females were necropsied on gds 9 - 14 to evaluate pregnancy status .
uteri were examined for the numbers of live and resorbed implantation sites , and ovaries were examined for the number of corpora lutea .
in utero insemination .
c - males , 10 / group , were bred to untreated receptive females using artificial insemination as previously described ( narotsky et al. 2013 ) .
briefly , within 15 min of sperm diffusion from the proximal cauda epididymis , each uterine horn of the anesthetized recipient female was injected with a volume containing 5 x 106 sperm , a value that results in approximately 75 % fertility of control males .
a single female was inseminated per male .
nine days later , inseminated females were killed , and corpora lutea ( reflecting the number of ovulations ) and uterine implantation sites were counted .
the fertility of each male was expressed as implants divided by corpora lutea .
sperm measures .
cauda epididymal sperm motility and morphology were evaluated as described previously ( klinefelter et al. 2002 ) in adult ( pnds 89 - 93 ) males .
in males assessed for fertility by artificial insemination ( pnds 96 - 100 ) , sp22 , a sperm membrane protein and biomarker of fertility ( klinefelter 2008 ) , was quantified using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ). necropsies .
full necropsies were conducted on p0 females at 26 days postpartum ( upon weaning of their litters ) , on f1 a - males at pnds 89 - 93 , and on f1 a - females at pnds 96 - 104 ( after pnd6 examinations of the f2 litters ) .
animals were weighed and killed by decapitation ; trunk blood was collected and sera were prepared .
sera were frozen at - 80degreesc for hormone analysis .
cranial , thoracic , abdominal , and pelvic viscera were examined grossly .
organ weights were recorded for the brain , kidneys , spleen , ovaries , testes , thymus , liver , lung , adrenal glands , pituitary gland , uterus with oviducts and cervix , epididymides , prostate , and seminal vesicles with coagulating glands ( and fluids ) .
uterine implantation sites were counted .
uteri from nonparous females were stained with 2 % ammonium sulfide to detect cases of full - litter resorption ( narotsky et al. 1997 ) .
tissues from liver , lungs , kidneys , adrenals , thymus , spleen , stomach , duodenum , ileum , cecum , colon ( proximal , middle , distal ) , mesenteric lymph nodes , trachea , esophagus , thyroid , pituitary gland , urinary bladder , prostate , seminal vesicle and coagulating gland , vagina , and ovaries , were fixed in buffered formalin .
for males , the left testis and epididymis were fixed in bouin 's fluid , and the right cauda epididymis was sampled for assessment of sperm motility and morphology. histology .
for p0 females , f1 a - males , and a - females , fixed tissues from 10 randomly selected rats from the control and high - dose groups were embedded in paraffin blocks , sectioned , stained with hematoxylin and eosin , and examined microscopically .
if results from this initial examination suggested a treatment effect , the specified tissue of the remaining rats were also processed and examined .
for 10 - 11 f1 males and females per group , three colon segments were stained with new methylene blue for analysis of aberrant crypt foci ( deangelo et al. 2002 ) .
for p0 and f1 a - females , the ovaries were examined quantitatively for primordial and primary follicles by examining 20 cross sections ( 5 mum thick ) per ovary .
routine histopathological examination of the ovaries was conducted in conjunction with the enumeration of follicles .
hormone measurements .
estradiol , progesterone , and testosterone were analyzed by antibody - coated tube radioimmunoassay using coat - a - count ( r ) kits ( diagnostic products ) .
intra - assay coefficients of variation for quality control samples were 9.1 , 5.4 , 1.5 , and 2.1 for estradiol , progesterone , leptin , and testosterone , respectively .
all testosterone samples were quantified in a single assay .
for estradiol , progesterone , and leptin , the interassay coefficients of variation were 7.2 , 1.7 , and 2.6 , respectively. statistics .
inferential statistical tests used a significance level of 0.05 ; adjustments were not made for multiple end points .
for all developmental and reproductive data , the litter was considered the experimental unit ; for example , litter means and frequencies per litter were used as the experimental units for analyzing pup weights and pup examination data .
prenatal loss ( the number of implants minus the number of viable pups at pnd0 ) , neonatal loss ( the number of pups viable on pnd0 but not on pnd6 ) , and perinatal loss ( the number of implants minus the number of live pups on pnd6 ) were analyzed as percentages of the number of implants ( prenatal and perinatal loss ) or the number of live pups at pnd0 ( neonatal loss ) .
continuous data , counts per litter , and proportions per litter were evaluated by analysis of variance ( anova ) using the general linear models ( glm ) procedure in sas , release 9.1 ( sas institute inc. ) .
proportions per litter ( e.g. , prenatal loss ) underwent arcsine square root transformation prior to glm analysis .
end points pertaining to survival were analyzed using one - tailed tests .
gestation lengths were analyzed using the kruskall - wallis test .
pup weight analysis used the number of live pnd0 pups as a covariate .
similarly , analyses of the numbers of live pups used the number of implants as a covariate .
incidences per group ( e.g. , estrous cycles ) were analyzed with fisher 's exact test to compare each group with controls .
agd was analyzed by analysis of covariance with pup weight as a covariate and litter as a random effect using proc mixed ( sas ) .
because of the potential bias inherent in the use of birth - based age for assessment of onset of puberty ( narotsky 2011 ) , pubertal data were analyzed using both conception - based age and day - of - birth - based age .
birth - based age was defined as the number of days since birth that pps or vo were observed , whereas conception - based age was defined as the number of days since gd22 that these landmarks were observed , regardless of the actual day of parturition .
results p0 dams .
maternal body weights ( figure 1b ) and water consumption ( figure 1a ) of p0 females were significantly reduced compared with controls throughout gestation and lactation in the group receiving 2,000x water .
at 1,000x , body weights were comparable with those of controls but water consumption was significantly reduced intermittently during gestation and consistently throughout lactation .
at 500x , body weights and water consumption were comparable to those of controls .
pregnancy rates were >= 96 % in all groups , and all dams successfully maintained their pregnancies to term ( see supplemental material , table s2 ) .
gestation lengths were comparable for all groups ; all dams delivered on gd21 or gd22 , and no abnormalities in parturition were noted .

f1 litters .
no pup malformations were observed at any of the f1 litter examinations , and no treatment effects on viability were evident .
the numbers of uterine implantation sites were comparable across all groups , as were the numbers of pups at each postnatal examination ( see supplemental material , table s2 ) .
attrition rates ( i.e. , prenatal loss , postnatal loss ) were unaffected by treatment ( figure 2a ; see also supplemental material , table s2 ) .
although pup weights ( figure 2b ) were comparable between groups at pnd0 , at all subsequent litter examinations pup weights were significantly reduced in the 2,000x group ( figure 2 ; see also supplemental material , table s2 ) .
in the 1,000x group , pup weight reductions were significant in males at pnd26 ( weaning ) and in females at pnds 21 and 26 ( see supplemental material , table s2 ) .
pup weights at 500x were unaffected at all litter examinations .
figure 2 f1 pup mortality and pup weight .
( a ) prenatal loss ( implantation to birth ) , neonatal loss ( birth to pnd6 ) , and postnatal loss from pnds 6 - 26 showed no adverse effects of treatment .
( b ) f1 pup weights were unaffected at birth , but reduced pup weights were seen beginning on pnd6 .
bars represent mean +/ - se per litter ( 24 - 25 litters / group ) .
for complete numeric data , see supplemental material , table s2 .
* p < 0.05 , and *** p < 0.001 , compared with controls .
all pups in 15 litters from the control and high - dose groups were each examined for agd at the pnd - 0 examination .
values were comparable between the groups for both male and female progeny ( see supplemental material , table s2 ) .
on pnd13 , f1 pups were examined for eye opening and nipple retention ( see supplemental material , table s3 ) .
the incidences of pups with both eyes open , or both eyes closed , were comparable for all groups .
males that still had nipples were observed only in the treated groups .
the mean +/ - se percents affected per litter were 3.2 +/ - 1.9 , 1.0 +/ - 1.0 , and 6.0 +/ - 2.3 at 500x , 1,000x , and 2,000x , respectively .
the incidence at 2,000x was significantly different from controls .
for females , less - than - prominent nipples were observed only at 2,000x , but this incidence did not reach significance .
f1 animals postweaning .
body weights and water consumption ( figure 1 ) of f1 males and females postweaning were significantly reduced at 2,000x .
at lower concentrations , female body weights ( figure 1d ) were comparable to controls , whereas male body weights ( figure 1f ) at 1,000x were significantly reduced only 1 week postweaning .
water consumption , however , was significantly reduced for both males ( figure 1c ) and females ( figure 1e ) at 1,000x .
at 500x , female water consumption was reduced compared with controls at most intervals , but male consumption was significantly reduced only during the pnd 55 - 58 interval .
onset of male puberty , indicated by the day of pps , was significantly delayed at 1,000x and 2,000x , whereas a nonsignificant delay ( p = 0.0588 ) was noted at 500x ( figure 3a ; see also supplemental material , table s4 ) .
compared with controls , pps was delayed 1.2 , 2.8 , and 5.7 days at 500x , 1,000x , and 2,000x , respectively .
body weights on the day of pps were reduced only at 2,000x ( figure 3b ; see also supplemental material , table s4 ) .
hormone measurements from males necropsied on pnd55 ( when most males have reached puberty ) revealed comparable serum testosterone levels across groups ; however , significantly reduced concentrations of testosterone (< 50 % of control ) were observed in the testicular interstitial fluid at 2,000x ( see supplemental material , table s4 ) .
figure 3 pubertal data .
( a ) vaginal opening , a marker for the onset of puberty , was significantly delayed in high - dose females .
the age of preputial separation , a marker for onset of puberty in males , was significantly increased in the middle - and high - dose groups .
( b ) body weight ( bw ) on the day of puberty was significantly reduced in high - dose males .
bars represent mean +/ - se per litter ( 24 - 25 litters / group ) .
for complete numeric data , see supplemental material , table s4 .
ages are expressed as days after gd22 .
* p < 0.05 , and *** p < 0.001 , compared with controls .
for the females , onset of puberty , as indicated by the day of vo , was significantly delayed at 1,000x and 2,000x ( figure 3a ; see also supplemental material , table s4 ) .
compared with controls , vo delays were 0.9 , 1.4 , and 5.8 days at 500x , 1,000x , and 2,000x , respectively .
body weights on the day of vo were comparable across groups ( figure 3b ; see also supplemental material , table s4 ) .
serum samples obtained on the day of vo revealed comparable levels of leptin and estradiol across groups , but progesterone levels were significantly reduced (~ 50 % of control values ) at 1,000x and 2,000x compared with controls ( see supplemental material , table s4 ) .
leptin , an adipose hormone important in regulating food intake and metabolism and with a permissive role in the onset of puberty ( sanchez - garrido and tena - sempere 2013 ) , was significantly correlated with body weight at 1,000x ( r2 = 0.236 , p < 0.05 ) and 2,000x ( r2 = 0.457 , p < 0.001 ) .
examination of vaginal cytology of two f1 females per litter for 19 days revealed regular 4 - or 5 - day cycles for all females except for females from one , two , four , and five litters at 0 , 500x , 1,000x , and 2,000x , respectively .
among animals with irregular cycles , extended / abnormal diestrus was observed in two control littermates , two females ( non - littermates ) at 500x , five females ( four litters ) at 1,000x , and three females ( three litters ) at 2,000x .
extended estrus was observed in two females ( two litters ) at 2,000x .
all incidences were comparable across groups .
for those females exhibiting regular estrous cycles , serum concentrations of progesterone and estradiol on the day of estrus were comparable across groups , as were the numbers of oocytes obtained from flushed oviducts ( data not shown ) .
breeding of f1 animals .
during the 14 - day breeding period , f1 breeding pairs showed no effects of treatment .
one pair at 1,000x failed to mate , whereas all remaining pairs mated , most within the first 4 days of cohabitation ( see supplemental material , table s5 ) .
pregnancy rates were comparable in all groups ; all females were pregnant except for two controls and two females at 1,000x .
all f1 dams delivered on gd21 or gd22 , and gestation lengths were comparable across groups .
no abnormalities in parturition were noted for the f1 dams .
f2 litters .
examination of f2 litters on pnds 0 and 6 showed no treatment effects .
the numbers of implantation sites and live pups at each examination were comparable between controls and treated litters ( see supplemental material , table s5 ) .
except for one control litter , all litters survived to pnd6 .
attrition rates per litter ( prenatal loss , neonatal loss ) ( figure 4a ; see also supplemental material , table s5 ) and pup weights ( figure 4b ; see also supplemental material , table s5 ) were comparable between groups .
agd , examined in the control and 2,000x groups on pnd0 , showed no differences between groups for either males or females .
except for filamentous tail observed in one control male , no malformations were observed in any of the f2 pups .
figure 4 f2 pup mortality and pup weight .
( a ) prenatal ( implantation to birth ) and neonatal ( birth to pnd6 ) loss showed no adverse effects of treatment .
( b ) f2 pup weights were unaffected at birth and pnd6 .
bars represent mean +/ - se per litter ( 22 - 24 litters / group ) .
for complete numeric data , see supplemental material , table s5 .
natural breeding of treated males to untreated females .
ten f1 males from each group were each cohabited with two untreated females for up to 7 days .
all males mated with at least one female .
the incidences of males mating , impregnating females , and siring live litters were comparable in all groups ( see supplemental material , table s6 ) .
midgestation examination of the females revealed comparable numbers of corpora lutea , implantation sites , live embryos , and resorption sites for all groups , as well as comparable attrition rates both pre - and postimplantation .
in utero insemination .
ten f1 males from each group provided cauda epididymal sperm samples to inseminate untreated females in utero .
there were nonsignificant increases in preimplantation loss and the incidence of infertile males ( see supplemental material , table s7 ) with increasing dose .
sperm from these males showed nonsignificant ( p <= 0.0567 ) reductions in sp22 , a sperm protein biomarker of fertility , at 500x and 1,000x , whereas values at 2,000x were comparable to controls .
necropsies and histology .
full necropsies were conducted on the p0 dams as well as on the f1 males and females that were used for breeding .
no gross necropsy findings were attributed to treatment .
for f1 males , absolute - - but not relative - - organ weights for brain , pituitary , liver , kidneys , adrenals , thymus , and spleen were reduced at 2,000x , and for thymus at 500x ( see supplemental material , table s8 ) .
for f1 females , absolute adrenal and liver weights were reduced in the high - dose group and relative kidney weights were increased at 1,000x and 2,000x .
histological examinations of tissues from 10 randomly selected p0 rats from the control and 2,000x groups prompted follow - up examinations of adrenals and kidneys of all p0 females .
incidences of nephropathy and , in the adrenal cortex , hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa and atrophy of the zona reticularis were significantly increased at 2,000x compared with controls ( see supplemental material , table s9 ) , with severity increasing with dose for the adrenal observations .
for f1 animals , histological examinations of 10 randomly selected males and females of the control and 2,000x groups revealed no findings attributed to treatment .
for 10 - 11 f1 animals per sex per group , colon samples ( proximal , medial , and distal ) were examined histologically for aberrant crypt foci ; none were observed .
histological examination of ovaries of 10 females each in the control and 2,000x groups of p0 and f1 dams revealed comparable numbers of primordial and primary follicles across groups ( data not shown ) .
sperm motility .
evaluations of sperm motion in adult f1 males indicated no effect on the percentage of motile sperm ( figure 5a ) ; however , compromised forward motion at 2,000x was observed , including a significant increase in beat cross frequency ( rate of crossing the average path trajectory ) and decreases in straightness ( linearity of the spatial average path ) and linearity ( linearity of the curvilinear trajectory ) ( figure 5b ) .
figure 5 cauda epididymal sperm motion parameters .
( a ) percentages of motile and progressively motile sperm were unaffected .
( b ) in the 2,000x group , beat cross frequency ( bcf ) was significantly increased , and straightness ( str ) and linearity ( lin ) were significantly decreased .
str = straight line velocity / average path velocity x 100 ; lin = straight line velocity / curvilinear velocity x 100 ; bcf = number of oscillations across mean trajectory .
values represent mean +/ - se ( 23 - 25 males / group ) .
** p < 0.01 , compared with controls .
discussion exposure to a mixture of regulated chlorination dbps at 500x the mcls had no adverse effects on any reproductive end points examined .
furthermore , exposure at up to 2,000x did not affect pregnancy maintenance , gestation length , prenatal survival , postnatal survival , or birth weights .
in view of epidemiological associations reported for low birth weight and spontaneous abortion in humans exposed to chlorinated water ( levallois et al. 2012 ; niewenhuijsen et al .
2009 ) , the lack of effects of this subset of dbps on birth weight and prenatal loss is noteworthy .
although birth weights were unaffected , reduced maternal water consumption during lactation may have contributed to reduced pup weights as lactation progressed .
in the 2,000x group , reduced weights were evident at pnd6 and persisted to adulthood , whereas in the 1,000x group , reduced weights reached significance only between pnd21 and pnd33 .
poor palatability of the dbp mixture at the higher dose levels may have contributed to reduced maternal water consumption , and in turn to the renal and adrenal pathology noted in the p0 dams and stunted growth in the progeny .
furthermore , it is possible that reproductive findings at the higher dose levels may also be secondary to decreased water consumption and body weights .
although agd was unaffected , endocrine - related effects in f1 animals included a subtle increase in retained nipples in males at 2,000x , delayed onset of puberty in both males and females at 1,000x and 2,000x , and altered sperm motility parameters at 2,000x .
f1 estrous cycles , breeding , fertility , and sp22 ( a sperm protein biomarker of fertility ) were unaffected , and f2 litters showed no effects on pup weight or viability .
in toxicity tests with individual chemicals , two regulated dbps ( dibromoacetic acid at 400 mg / l , bromodichloromethane at 150 mg / l ) have been shown to delay puberty in rats ( christian et al. 2002a , 2002b ; klinefelter et al .
2004 ) and may have contributed to the effects seen here .
dibromoacetic acid has also been shown to reduce sperm quality in rats at 40 mg / l ( klinefelter et al. 2004 ) or 2 mg / kg by gavage ( kaydos et al. 2004 ; klinefelter et al .
2004 ) and rabbits at 1 mg / kg in drinking water ( veeramachaneni et al. 2007 ) .
the lack of an effect on fertility in the present study was unsurprising because sperm quality in rats , unlike humans , must be substantially reduced to affect fertility ( klinefelter et al. 1994 ) .
however , in utero insemination with artificially reduced sperm numbers also showed no clear effect on fertility .
in vitro , dibromoacetic acid has been shown to decrease progesterone secretion in newly matured ovarian follicles ( goldman and murr 2002 ) and may have contributed to the reduced pubertal progesterone levels observed here .
in conjunction with the present study , we have also conducted a similar multigenerational study examining the effects of an environmental " whole " mixture concentrate of dbps ( i.e. , containing unidentified and identified dbps ) ( narotsky et al. 2013 ) .
consistent with the current study , the whole mixture significantly delayed puberty in females and had reduced sperm counts in males .
together , these studies provide valuable insight toward understanding the potential health risks of dbps in tap water .
conclusions a mixture of the regulated thms and haas at concentrations 500x greater than regulatory mcls had no adverse effects ; furthermore , 2,000x , the highest concentration evaluated , did not affect the animals' ability to reproduce .
the lack of effects on prenatal survival and birth weight in this study contrast with associations reported in some epidemiological studies ( levallois et al. 2012 ; nieuwenhuijsen et al. 2009 ) .
although reproduction per se was unaffected , retained nipples and sperm motility effects in males at 2,000x and pubertal delays in both sexes at >= 1,000x the regulatory mcls indicate that a mixture of these regulated dbps can influence endocrine physiology ; however , these findings may have been secondary to reduced water consumption and body weight .

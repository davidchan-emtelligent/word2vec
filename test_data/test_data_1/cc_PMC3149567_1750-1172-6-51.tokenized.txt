objectives to assess associations between subcutaneous neurofibromas ( sc - nfs ) and internal neurofibromas in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 ( nf - 1 ) and to determine whether the association between sc - nfs and peripheral neuropathy was ascribable to internal neurofibromas .
patients and methods prospective multicentre case - control study. between 2005 and 2008 , 110 nf - 1 adults having two or more sc - nfs were individually matched for age , sex and hospital with 110 controls who had no sc - nf. patients underwent standardized mri of the spinal cord , nerve roots and sciatic nerves and an electrophysiological study .
analyses used adjusted multinomial logistic regression ( ora ) to estimate the risk of the presence of internal neurofibromas or peripheral neuropathies associated with patients presented 2 to 9 sc - nfs , at least 10 sc - nfs as compared to patients without any ( referential category ) .
results cases had a mean age of 41 (+/ - 13 ) years ; 85 ( 80 %) had two to nine sc - nfs and 21 ( 19 %) at least ten sc - nfs .
sc - nfs were more strongly associated with internal neurofibromas in patients with ten or more sc - nfs than in patients with fewer nf - scs ( e.g. , sciatic nerve , aor = 29.1 [ 8.5 to 100 ] vs. 4.3 [ 2.1 to 9.0 ]) .
the association with sc - nfs was stronger for diffuse , intradural , and > 3 cm internal neurofibromas than with other internal neurofibromas .
axonal neuropathy with slowed conduction velocities ( scv ) was more strongly associated with having at least ten sc - nfs ( aor = 29.9 , 5.5 to 162.3 ) than with having fewer sc - nfs ( aor = 4.4 , 0.9 to 22.0 ) .
bivariate analyses showed that the association between axonal neuropathy with scv and sciatic neurofibromas was mediated by the association between sc - nfs and sciatic neurofibromas .
conclusion the at - risk phenotype of nf - 1 patients ( i.e. nf - 1 patients with sc - nfs ) is ascribable to associations linking sc - nfs to internal neurofibromas at risk for malignant transformation and to axonal neuropathies with slowed conduction velocities .
axonal neuropathies with scv are particularly common in patients with at least ten sc - nfs .
registration details orpha86301 introduction neurofibromatosis type 1 ( nf - 1 [ mim 162200 ]) is a common autosomal dominant disorder associated with increased morbidity and mortality [ 1 ] .
neurofibromas are the hallmark of nf1 .
they are benign tumors that arise from connective tissue of nerve sheaths , especially the endoneurium .
we used the classification proposed by riccardi which defines four categories of neurofibromas [ 2 ] : ( i ) cutaneous neurofibromas , presenting as an exophytoc tumor moving with the skin on examination , ( ii ) subcutaneous neurofibromas that lie deeper in the skin , do not move with it , are firm to palpation and may be tender ( iii ) internal or deep neurofibromas may involve any nerve anywhere along its length and are not palpated .
they are therefore identified later in their course of growth ( iv ) plexiform neurofibromas may involve multiple fascicles and branches , and extend into surrounding structures .
clinical investigation identifies thickened hypertrophic skin , hyperpigmentation of tissue and subcutaneous tumor [ 2,3 ] .
subcutaneous neurofibromas ( sc - nfs ) were independently associated with mortality among adults with nf - 1 in two independent populations from france [ 4 ] and north america [ 5 ] .
the main causes of death were spinal cord compression by internal neurofibromas and malignant peripheral nerve - sheath tumours ( mpnsts ) developed from pre - existing internal neurofibromas [ 4,5 ] .
a recent study demonstrated that having at least two sc - nfs was independently associated with having internal neurofibromas [ 6 ] .
however , this association needs to be characterised in detail .
furthermore , a strong association between peripheral neuropathy and sc - nfs has been reported [ 7 ] .
we hypothesized that this association was related to an association between sc - nfs and internal neurofibromas located along the nerve roots .
the primary objective of this prospective matched case - control study was to characterise the association between sc - nfs and internal neurofibromas in patients routinely investigated with magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , the most sensitive method for detecting internal neurofibromas and assessing their features ( e.g. , type , distribution , location , and size ) .
the secondary objective was to determine whether peripheral neuropathy was associated with having internal neurofibromas along the nerve roots .
peripheral neuropathy was detected using a routine electrophysiological study .
patients and methods study design this case - control study was conducted prospectively from february 2005 to december 2008 in three hospital centres in france .
for a type 1 error of 0.05 , 100 cases and 100 controls provided 90 % power for detecting odds ratios ( ors ) greater than 3 for factors having a 20 % prevalence in the general population of adults with nf - 1 .
we decided to select 110 cases and 110 controls to allow for some patients being excluded secondarily ( e.g. , because of contraindications to mri ) .
controls were matched individually to cases on age (+/ - 3 years ) , sex , and hospital .
the study was approved by the ile - de - france ix ( paris , france ) ethics committee , and all cases and controls gave their informed consent .
cases the cases were identified among adults with nf - 1 in our nf - network database .
they met diagnostic criteria for nf - 1 established at the national institutes of health consensus development conference ( n = 1 099 ) [ 8 ] .
among patients aged 17 years or older ( n = 748 ) , we included probands and patients with sporadic disease ( n = 515 ) who had at least two sc - nfs ( n = 192 ) , defined as palpable nodules along peripheral nerves under the skin .
we did not include patients having less than two sc - nfs ( n = 259 ) , pregnant women , and patients with contraindications to mri ( e.g. , cardiac pacemaker , ferromagnetic or electronically operated stapedial implant , haemostatic clip , or metallic splinters ) ( n = 64 ) .
among these 192 potential cases , 110 cases were selected at random for study inclusion .
controls for each case , we looked for a control individually matched on age , sex , and centre in the nf - network database .
potential controls were probands or sporadic nf - 1 patients who were at least 17 years old and had no sc - nfs and no contraindications to mri .
when we found several controls appropriate for the same case , we selected one at random .
thus , 110 controls were selected .
data collection data , including demographic information ( age , sex and body mass index ) and clinical features were collected during routine clinical assessments at the neurofibromatosis clinics by one dermatologist at each centre ( sf , pc , sb ) ( table 1 ) .
the skin lesions were described in detail : number of cafe - au - lait spots , cutaneous neurofibromas ( 0 , 1 , 2 - 9 , 10 - 99 , >= 100 ) , and sc - nfs ( 0 , 2 - 9 , 10 - 99 , >= 100 ) ; and count and location of plexiform neurofibromas defined as benign peripheral nerve - sheath tumours involving multiple nerve fascicles or branches of major peripheral nerves .
most of the plexiform neurofibromas were cutaneous or subcutaneous and were identified clinically .
other items were coded as present or absent .
orthopaedic complications ( scoliosis ) , neurological abnormalities ( headache , epilepsy , learning disabilities ) , and endocrinological disorders ( hypertension ) were also recorded .

mri was performed using a field strength of 1.5 - t .
t1 - and t2 - weighted nonenhanced sequences ( coronal plane ) including short - tau inversion - recovery ( stir ) sequences were acquired using a slice thickness of 4 mm with no gap .
the image matrix was 512 / 256 .
three coronal images ( cervico - thoracic spine , thoraco - lumbo - sacral spine , and pelvis / thighs ) were acquired to characterize the internal neurofibromas .
mri data were reviewed by a senior radiologist ( pb ) who was unaware of the clinical features .
we recorded the presence of internal neurofibromas , their type ( along the spinal cord or sciatic nerve roots ) , their distribution ( focal or diffuse ) , their size (< 3 cm or >= 3 cm ) , and their location ( intradural or extradural ) .
electrophysiological study all cases and controls underwent a standardized electrophysiological study to look for peripheral neuropathy .
the investigation included sensory / motor nerve conduction study for the superficial / deep peroneal nerves and the sural / tibial nerves at both lower limbs and for the median and ulnar nerves at one upper limb .
the electrophysiological data were reviewed by a senior physiologist ( jpl ) who was unaware of the clinical features .
patients were classified as having either no neuropathy ( normal nerve conduction study ) or an axonal distal , sensory - predominant polyneuropathy ( characterized by a bilateral and symmetric reduction of sensory nerve action potential amplitude at the lower limbs with less marked abnormalities regarding motor nerve conduction parameters and upper limb results ) .
among axonal neuropathies , we differentiated those with and without slowed conduction velocities ( scvs ) .
neuropathies with and without scvs shared the same presentation in terms of action potential amplitude reduction , but neuropathies with scvs additionally showed moderate but diffuse decrease of motor nerve conductions , very homogeneously , without any increased temporal dispersion or conduction block .
therefore , we assumed that neuropathies with scvs were primarily axonal because they did not present any relevant criteria in favour of a demyelinating process [ 9 ] .
we also determined the presence of proximal / nerve root involvement (" radiculopathy ") according to a selective alteration ( absence or prolonged latency ) of the f - waves and h - reflexes at the lower limbs .
statistical analysis data were double - keyboarded and analysed using stata software version 11 ( stata corporation , college station , tx , usa ) .
all tests were two - tailed and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
quantitative variables are reported as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) and qualitative variables as number (%) .
first , we compared cases and controls using univariate analysis ( chi - square test or fisher exact test as appropriate ) .
then , logistic regression models were used to estimate ors adjusted for matching variables ( aors ) with their 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % cis ) for each characteristic of internal neurofibromas ( spinal cord or sciatic nerve root , intra or extradural , diffuse or focal , size , and size category < 3 cm or >= 3 cm ) .
similarly , we estimated aors with their 95 % cis separately for each type of peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathy .
then , to test our hypothesis that the association between sc - nfs and peripheral neuropathy was related to internal neurofibromas along the nerve roots , bivariate analyses including peripheral neuropathies and internal neurofibromas were performed .
finally , to assess whether the number of sc - nfs was associated with internal neurofibromas and / or peripheral neuropathy , cases were classified into two groups based on whether they had two to nine sc - nfs or at least ten sc - nfs .
the , risk associated with each of these categories versus the controls ( no sc - nfs ) was estimated using adjusted multinomial logistic regression ( aor ) .
control patients were the referential category .
results between 2005 and 2008 , 110 cases were matched for age , sex , and hospital to 110 nf - 1 controls .
four cases and eight controls were excluded secondarily because their mri scans were not interpretable .
table 1 reports the characteristics of the 106 cases and 102 controls .
the cases had a mean age of 41 (+/ - 13 ) years ; 59 % were females , 85 ( 80 %) had two to nine sc - nfs and 21 ( 19 %) at least ten sc - nfs .
there were no significant differences between cases and controls for age and sex ( matching variables ) or clinical features ( e.g. , dermatological characteristics , orthopaedic complications , and neurological abnormalities ) except the cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas .
significantly greater proportions of cases than controls had no cutaneous neurofibromas ( p = 0.03 ) and at least one plexiform neurofibroma ( p = 0.04 ) .
cases had fewer large cafe - au - lait spots compared to controls but the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.07 ) .
table 2 summarises the results of the univariate analysis .
the presence of sc - nfs was strongly associated with having paraspinal neurofibromas ( aor , 4.3 ; 95 % ci , 2.2 to 8.2 ) and sciatic neurofibromas ( aor , 6.1 ; 95 % ci , 2.9 to 13 ) .
the associations tended to be stronger for diffuse vs. focal paraspinal neurofibromas , intradural vs. extradural neurofibromas , and internal neurofibromas measuring at least 3 cm vs. less than 3 cm. similarly , for sciatic neurofibromas , diffuse distribution and tumour size of at least 3 cm showed trends toward stronger associations with sc - nfs than focal distribution and size smaller than 3 cm , respectively .
finally , the presence of axonal neuropathy with scvs was significantly associated with having sc - nfs ( aor , 7.7 ; 95 % ci , 1.6 to 36.6 ) ( table 3 ) .

the joint analysis identified no interactions between variables associated with the presence of sc - nfs .
a strong association was found between the presence of sciatic neurofibromas and that of axonal neuropathy with scvs ( aor = 22.1 ; 95 % ci , 4.2 to 115.3 ) .
in the bivariate analysis including axonal neuropathy with scvs and sciatic neurofibromas , axonal neuropathy with scvs was no longer associated with sc - nfs ( aor , 3.0 ; 95 % ci , 0.6 to 15.1 ; p = 0.18 ) .
the association between axonal neuropathy with scvs and sc - nfs persisted only in the subgroup with sciatic neurofibromas ( aor , 2.00 ; 95 % ci , 1.01 to 4.12 ; vs. aor , 0.69 ; 95 % ci , 0.24 to 4.12 in the subgroup without sciatic neurofibromas ) .
thus , the association between sc - nf and axonal neuropathy with scvs was due to the presence of internal sciatic neurofibromas .
in the multinomial logistic regression analysis , patients with at least ten sc - nfs had a significantly higher risk of paraspinal neurofibromas ( aor , 82 ; 95 % ci , 10.4 to 647.9 ) compared to patients with two to nine sc - nfs ( aor , 2.7 ; 95 % ci , 1.4 to 5.3 ) ( figure 1 ) .
this dose - effect relationship was observed for distribution , location , and size ( figure 1 , table 4 ) .
similar dose - effect relationships were found for sciatic neurofibromas , particularly regarding distribution , location , size ( figure 1 , table 4 ) .
finally , axonal neuropathies with scvs were more common in patients with at least ten sc - nfs ( aor , 29.9 ; 95 % ci , 5.5 to 162.3 ) than in patients with two to nine sc - nfs ( aor , 4.4 ; 95 % ci , 0.9 to 22.0 ) ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 odds ratios ( ors ) with their 95 % confidence intervals for several types of internal neurofibromas and peripheral neuropathies in patients with two to nine subcutaneous neurofibromas ( sc - nfs ) or at least ten sc - nfs .
the ors associated with each type of internal neurofibroma and peripheral neuropathy were estimated using multinomial logistic regression adjusted for the matching variables ( age , sex , and centre ) , using the control group of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and no sc - nfs ( n = 102 ) as the reference category .
ors were log - transformed .

*** slowed conduction velocities discussion this study shows that sub - cutaneous neurofibromas were significantly associated with having paraspinal and sciatic neurofibromas detected by routine mri .
the strength of the association tended to be higher when the paraspinal and sciatic neurofibromas were diffuse , intradural , and at least 3 cm in diameter .
moreover , paraspinal and sciatic neurofibromas were significantly more common in patients having at least ten sc - nfs than in patients having two to nine sc - nfs .
a dose - effect relationship was also found for distribution , location , and size of the internal neurofibromas .
finally , our data indicate that the strong association between sc - nfs and axonal neuropathy with scvs is due to the association between sc - nfs and internal neurofibromas .
neurofibromatosis - 1 ( nf1 ) is a common disease with an increased propensity for developing both benign and malignant tumors [ 10 ] .
nf1 has been reported to be associated with a 15 - year decrease in life expectancy [ 1 ] .
one of the aims of the reseau nf - france was to identify clinical predictive factors for mortality , in order to better adjust the follow up and propose new treatments for eligible patients .
we previously demonstrated in two different nf1 populations , from france [ 4 ] and north america [ 5 ] , that the presence of at least 2 subcutaneous neurofibromas was associated with a higher risk of death .
the main causes of death were compression of neighboring organs due to internal neurofibromas , and malignant peripheral nerve - sheath tumours developing from preexisting internal neurofibromas .
the main concern in the long - term clinical management of adults with nf - 1 is the identification of patients at high risk for mpnsts developed from pre - existing internal neurofibromas .
at present , no effective treatment is available for mpnst untreatable by surgery .
new treatments are usually approved based on proof of efficacy in a controlled trial .
when conducting controlled trials , an important consideration is patient selection based on severity of illness .
controlled trials in adults with nf - 1 should target patients who have a high - risk phenotype defined by the presence of sc - nf. patients with a high risk of internal neurofibromas must be therefore identified as potential new therapies are being developed .
for instance , there are at least seven phase ii / iii trials in which the internal neurofibromas are being treated by targeted therapy such as ranibizumab , niltotinib ...
( clinicaltrials.gov ) .
in addition , we believe that targeted therapy will be of greater efficacy on non - transformed internal neurofibromas .
at present time , an annual careful clinical examination is recommended for all patients with nf1 in order to detect clinical symptoms associated with mpnsts such as pain , neurological deficit and enlargement of a pre - existing peripheral nerve sheath tumour [ 11 ] .
routine mri screening , which is highly reliable for detecting internal neurofibromas , is not recommended in patients without the alarming clinical signs mentioned above [ 12 ] .
it is therefore critical to precisely clinically identify the patients with the maximum likelihood of having internal neurofibromas and to closely follow them by it iterating mri .
the first step is to assess recognizable clinical features as potential predictors of morbidity and mortality in order to further improve the clinical management of nf1 .
we recently developed a clinical score for predicting the presence of internal neurofibromas in adults with nf1 .
the nf1score , computed via a linear combination of four variables ( age <= 30 years , fewer than six cafe - au - lait spots , no cutaneous neurofibromas , and two or more sc - nfs ) , can be used to accurately predict the presence of internal neurofibromas in nf - 1 patients and help target patients for now emerging clinical trial [ 6 ] .
the high point scoring of the nf1score is the presence of sc - nfs .
sc - nfs were highly associated with having internal neurofibromas ( or , 4.7 ; 95 % ci , 2.1 - 10.5 ) [ 6 ] .
the second step , our present work , was to confirm and explain a detailed and unbiased characterisation of the links between internal neurofibromas and sc - nfs .
to our knowledge , this was the first controlled study involving a detailed characterization of the relationship between sc - nfs , internal neurofibromas , and peripheral neuropathies in adults with nf - 1 .
the internal validity of this study depends on many factors , including the unbiased recruitment of cases and controls and the accuracy of the information obtained about the presence of internal neurofibromas .
mri , an extremely reliable method for detecting internal neurofibromas , was performed routinely in all our cases and controls .
assessment bias was minimized by having the mri data reviewed by senior radiologist ( pb ) who was unaware of the clinical data .
assessment bias was minimized by having the electrophysiological data reviewed by senior physiologist ( jpl ) who was unaware of the mri data .
clinical information regarding the neuropathy was not available .
however , according to our experience the diffuse symmetric peripheral neuropathies related to nf - 1 are asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic with minor sensory manifestations [ 7 ] .
as with all hospital - based case - control studies , selection bias cannot be excluded .
however , the prevalence of the various clinical features in the cases were similar to those in the controls ( except for the number of cutaneous neurofibromas ) and to those reported previously in nf - 1 patients , indicating that our study population was representative of nf - 1 patients [ 13 ] .
regarding the number of cutaneous neurofibromas , the association linking the absence of cutaneous neurofibromas to the presence of sc - nf is in agreement with a previous study showing higher mortality among nf - 1 patients who had no cutaneous neurofibromas [ 4 ] .
in summary , this study shows a strong association between the presence of internal neurofibromas and the presence of sc - nf. the increased risk in nf - 1 patients with subcutaneous neurofibromas ( high risk phenotype ) can be ascribed in part to the associations between sc - nfs and internal neurofibromas ( prone to transformation to mpnsts ) and the presence of a neuropathy with scvs .
the prevalence of neuropathy with scvs is particularly high in patients with at least ten sc - nfs .
to better understand the patho - physiological processes in the high risk phenotype of nf - 1 patients , the next step would be to perform genotype - phenotype correlation studies .
a more severe clinical phenotype has been reported in nf1 patients carrying genomic microdeletions involving nf1 and surrounding gene compare to patients with mutations restricted to the nf1 genes .
a recent study confirmed in a large cohort that nf1 microdeletion patients have a significantly higher incidence of learning disabilities and facial dysmorphism than patients with intragenic nf1 mutation [ 14 ] .
however no association were found between sc - nfs and mpnsts and nf1 microdeletion patients .
further studies are therefore needed to find others genes beside nf1 implied in the internal nf development .
one of the major aims of such studies would be to identify key targets for novel drugs' development .

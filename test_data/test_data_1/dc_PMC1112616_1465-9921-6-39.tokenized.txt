background the effects of pulmonary arterial hypertension on brain function are not understood , despite patients' frequent complaints of cognitive difficulties .
using clinical instruments normally administered during standard in - person assessment of neurocognitive function in adults , we assembled a battery of tests designed for administration over the telephone .
the purpose was to improve patient participation , facilitate repeated test administration , and reduce the cost of research on the neuropsychological consequences of acute and chronic cardiorespiratory diseases .
we undertook this study to validate telephone administration of the tests .
methods 23 adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension underwent neurocognitive assessment using both standard in - person and telephone test administration , and the results of the two methods compared using interclass correlations .
results for most of the tests in the battery , scores from the telephone assessment correlated strongly with those obtained by in - person administration of the same tests .
interclass correlations between 0.5 and 0.8 were observed for tests that assessed attention , memory , concentration / working memory , reasoning , and language / crystallized intelligence ( p <= 0.05 for each ) .
interclass correlations for the hayling sentence completion test of executive function approached significance ( p = 0.09 ) .
all telephone tests were completed within one hour .
conclusion administration of this neurocognitive test battery by telephone should facilitate assessment of neuropsychological deficits among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension living across broad geographical areas , and may be useful for monitoring changes in neurocognitive function in response to pah - specific therapy or disease progression .
introduction pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive shortness of breath and the eventual development of life - threatening heart failure [ 1 - 4 ] .
while its effects on cardiovascular function have been well documented , little is known about effects of this disease on other organ systems , notably the brain .
patients frequently complain of changes in memory , concentration and judgment in association with the development of cardiopulmonary symptoms [ 5 ] .
objective assessments of cognitive function , however , have not been performed .
the " gold standard " for comprehensive assessment of neurocognitive function is a comprehensive battery of individually validated tests that are administered in - person by an experienced interviewer .
comprehensive , standard testing often takes four hours or longer and may require two or more separately scheduled sessions .
the experience can be stressful and fatiguing , particularly for chronically ill or physically disabled patients .
the stress of additional travel to a testing site adds to the burden .
consequently , many patients decline to participate in clinical research that uses formal in - person neurocognitive testing , especially if the protocol includes repeated testing over time [ 6,7 ] .
to address these concerns , we developed a focused battery of neurocognitive tests for administration over the telephone .
the battery is comprised of individually validated neurocognitive test instruments appropriate for administration to adults with cardiopulmonary disease who are fluent in english and capable of communicating verbally .
telephone administration of the test battery has been evaluated for feasibility and validity in survivors of the acute respiratory distress syndrome [ 8 ] .
the present study establishes the validity of telephone administration of the test battery by comparing the results of telephone testing against " gold standard " in - person administration in adult ambulatory patients with moderately to severely symptomatic pah .
methods study population consecutive patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension according to standard criteria [ 2,9 ] were prospectively recruited for neurocognitive testing from the pulmonary hypertension clinic at lds hospital .
written informed consent was obtained from the patients for both the in - person and telephone neuropsychological testing .
inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older and the ability to give informed consent .
exclusion criteria included non - fluency in english , a history of major psychiatric illness ( e.g. schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder , psychoses requiring medication and / or hospitalization , and major depression requiring hospitalization ) , known learning disability , prior traumatic brain injury , diagnosis of dementia , cerebral vascular accident , neurologic disorder ( e.g. multiple sclerosis , huntington 's disease , etc. ) , prior cardiac surgery , or current alcohol or drug abuse .
patients were recruited for neurocognitive assessment from a group who had consented to in - person testing .
sixty - seven patients were screened .
seventeen patients declined , two were excluded due to non - fluency in english , and two were medically unstable at the time of evaluation and died during the recruitment period. of the 46 patients who consented to in - person neurocognitive testing , 25 consented to additional testing by telephone .
patient demographic , medical and laboratory data were collected for all enrolled patients .
this study was approved by the university of pennsylvania and lds hospital institutional review boards and conformed to institutional and federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects .
neurocognitive assessment an interdisciplinary team of neuropsychology , traumatic brain injury , rehabilitation medicine , and pulmonary disease specialists selected a battery of standardized neurocognitive tests amenable to both in - person and telephone administration .
tests were also chosen on the basis of established sensitivity in detecting impairment in patients with cardiopulmonary disorders and concomitant hypoxemia [ 10 - 13 ] .
the cognitive domains assessed and the tests included in the battery are listed in table 1 .
all neurocognitive tests included in the battery have been empirically validated and standardized [ 14 - 17 ] with established reliability , internal and external validity [ 12,14,16,18,19 ] .
the neurocognitive tests were administered in a random sequence to minimize order effects .
however , as a delay is required between the wechsler memory scale - iii logical memory i and ii tests , logical memory i ( immediate recall ) was the first and logical memory ii ( delay recall ) the last test administered in each session .

the identical tests were administered subsequently by telephone at a prearranged time when patients were at home and free from distraction .
to minimize potential learning effects , telephone testing was performed at least 2.5 months following in - person assessment , except with one patient who was tested 57 days after in - person evaluation .
a ph.d. neuropsychologist ( roh ) administered the in - person tests and a neuropsychology doctoral student administered the telephone tests with no knowledge of the results of the previous in - person testing .
during both the in - person and telephone tests , patients were instructed not to write down information and to answer questions without assistance .
the in - person and telephone assessments were both conducted in single sessions , and each took 35 to 45 minutes to complete .
all neuropsychological tests were scored according to the published guidelines .
each test yields a raw score that was converted into a scaled score ( mean = 10 ; sd = 3 ) , which was used for statistical analyses , except for logical memory where the raw scores are used .
statistical analysis descriptive statistics were carried out for demographic and medical data .
the neuropsychological test scores from the in - person administration were compared to telephone test scores using interclass correlations .
to facilitate interpretation of significant correlations ( p <= 0.05 ) and because traditional significance levels for correlations coefficients are influenced by factors such as group size , range of scores , and multiple comparisons , we used the following conservative classification : fair correlation with coefficients between 0.21 and 0.40 ; moderate correlation 0.41 to 0.60 ; substantial correlation 0.61 to 0.80 ; and almost perfect correlation 0.81 to 1.00 [ 20 ] .
to assess potential learning effects , systematic differences between first and second administrations for each of the tests were assessed using paired sample t - tests .
the differences between the in - person and telephone test results are expressed as standardized effects sizes ( t2 - t1 differences divided by t1 standard deviation ) [ 21 ] .
results twenty - five patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension were enrolled for neurocognitive evaluation using both in - person and telephone testing .
all 25 patients completed in - person testing .
telephone testing could not be completed on one subject due to a non - functioning telephone line , and one subject died of progressive right heart failure .
all of the remaining 23 subjects completed both the in - person and telephone assessments and were included in the validation group .
eighty - three percent ( n = 19 ) of these subjects were women .
the mean +/ - sd age was 49.7 +/ - 13.9 years ( range 20 to 60 years ) and the mean education level was 13.6 +/ - 3.0 years ( range 6 to 20 years ) .
the mean number of days between in - person and telephone testing was 121.6 ( range 57 to 200 days ) .
the etiology of pah was : idiopathic (" primary ") pah in ten patients ( 43 %) , associated with anorexigen use in six ( 26 %) , collagen vascular disease in four ( 17 %) , congenital heart disease in two ( 9 %) and one with portopulmonary hypertension ( 4 %) .
the mean (+/ - sd ) right atrial pressure was 5.1 +/ - 1.8 mmhg , mean pulmonary artery pressure 52.1 +/ - 16.9 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 12.1 +/ - 6.2 .
the mean cardiac output was 5.1 +/ - 1.8 l / min .

the correlation coefficients for the comparison between in - person and telephone testing are presented in table 4 .
interclass correlation coefficients of at least 0.54 ( p < 0.05 to < 0.0001 ) were found for the agreement of telephone and in - person scores on tests assessing the cognitive domains of attention , memory , concentration / working memory , reasoning , and language / crystallized intelligence .
an almost perfect correlation was observed in the assessment of reasoning ( similarities ) .
substantial correlations were found for the digit span , similarities , and vocabulary tests (. 61 to . 80 ) and moderate correlations (. 41 to . 60 ) were found for each logical memory immediate and delay recall .
a moderate correlation ( 0.56 ) was seen with the in - person and telephone administration of the digit - span - backward ( concentration / working memory ) .
only a fair correlation ( 0.28 ; p = 0.09 ) was found between the in - person and telephone administration of the hayling sentence completion test of executive function .
for letter - number sequence test ( concentration / working memory ) scores were not correlated for the in - person and telephone tests .

logical memory and number - letter sequencing are from the wms - iii ; digit span , similarities and vocabulary are from the wais - r. stability over time was greatest for the similarities and vocabulary tests .
the effects of learning showed that test scores tended to increase between the in - person and telephone tests , with the most improvement for verbal memory ( e.g. logical memory immediate and delayed recall ) .
discussion we found the battery of well - established neurocognitive tests to be amenable to administration by telephone and valid for the identification of neurocognitive deficits in patients with pah .
testing was readily completed in a single , 30 - 60 minute session , and required neither specialized testing facilities nor travel by physically debilitated patients spread across a broad geographic area .
our study was designed to validate the administration by telephone of a battery of neurocognitive tests against the in - person (" gold standard ") performance of these same assessments .
each of the tests in the battery has been previously validated for the identification of neurocognitive deficits in various populations , including those with cardiopulmonary disease - . as such , our subjects' scores during in - person testing served as matched controls for comparison with the results obtained upon application of these same tests over the telephone .
the scores from telephone and in - person assessments correlated strongly for the majority of tests .
overall , the strengths of the correlations with in - person testing found here are comparable to those that we reported previously for the same test battery applied to ards survivors [ 8 ] and the correlations reported for other telephone neurocognitive test batteries [ 21 - 25 ] .
two items in the test battery did not correlate as well as the others .
the interclass correlations for the hayling sentence completion test only approached significance ( p = 0.09 ) .
the in - person and telephone administrations of the letter - number - sequencing component of the wms iii ( a test of concentration / working memory ) did not correlate well .
some subjects appeared to have difficulty discriminating phonetically similar sounds ( e.g. the letters ' m ' and ' n ') when presented during telephone sessions ; visual cues may have alleviated such issues at in - person sessions .
in contrast , another component of the wms iii ( digits backward ) evaluating the same cognitive domain ( concentration / working memory ) had substantial correlations .
although the correlations we found between in - person testing and subsequent telephone administration of the same test battery were moderate or higher , they were not perfect .
the effects of learning or practice suggest that test scores increase between the in - person and telephone tests , with the most improvement in verbal memory .
thus , the improvement in test scores on the telephone administration of the test likely reflects practice effects .
an alternative explanation for the tendency of subjects to perform better on the telephone test battery may be environmental factors .
for example subjects scored higher on certain tasks when assessed at home as compared to similar tasks performed in a clinic setting [ 26 ] .
improved orientation to time and place have been found when patients were tested in their own residence [ 22 ] .
further , patients report less anxiety and prefer telephone testing compared to in - person evaluation [ 27 ] .
in addition to the pragmatic advantages , telephone testing may provide a better assessment of patients' cognitive function in their normal environment .
finally , it is possible that neurocognitive function improved during the interval between the two test sessions ( mean 122 days ) .
the reason for a potential improvement in neurocognitive performance will be important in future studies that use repeated test administration to determine the effect of drugs for pah or other interventions on neurocognitive function .
an important limitation of our study was our inability to reverse the order of administration ( in - person and telephone ) [ 28 ] .
our subjects were enrolled in another ongoing study , which required in - person assessments prior to enrollment in this study of telephone testing [ 29 ] .
an alternative would be to repeat in - person and telephone assessments in random order following the initial interview .
such additional testing , however , might have increased the potential for learning or practice affects , and the further time and travel commitments for patients likely impacting study participation .
future studies should counterbalance the order of in - person and telephone administration .
due to pragmatic limitations the time interval between in - person and telephone testing was somewhat longer than the minimum time necessary to minimize recall and learning effects .
telephone testing has been used successfully in the assessment of neruocognitive impairment in other patient populations .
further , the ease in application and relative low cost of telephone testing have enabled assessments in several large clinical studies of cognitive function : screening of 4,932 elderly patients for alzheimer 's disease using the modified mini - mental state examination for telephone administration [ 30 ] ; cognitive function in 4,023 patients with cardiovascular risk factors [ 31 ] ; 466 patients with coronary artery bypass graft surgery [ 32 ] , and in a self - referred ards patient group [ 8 ] .
in addition to neurocognitive testing , telephone - based assessments have provided accurate determinations of quality of life , medication usage , 24 - hour physical activity and dietary recall [ 33 - 35 ] .
cognitive function has not been studied in pulmonary arterial hypertension , despite the frequent reports of problems with memory and concentration [ 5 ] .
cognitive impairments are important complications of other chronic and life - threatening illnesses , and are associated with a significantly worse prognosis [ 36 - 38 ] .
cognitive impairments can also profoundly reduce quality of life [ 39 - 42 ] .
therapies that improve physical function in pah may have important ( but as yet unknown ) effects on neurocognitive function , positive or negative .
for these reasons , research on neurocognitive function is warranted .
the brief neurocognitive telephone test battery is valid for assessment of cognitive function in this population and provides the means to pursue further , larger studies to assess the frequency and risk factors of cognitive sequelae in patients with pah .
conclusion this study has demonstrated that scores on a battery of neurocognitive tests obtained by telephone administration correlated well with in - person testing in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension .
the strong correlations observed are comparable to previous studies that assessed in - person and telephone versions of neurocognitive tests. with minor modification , the telephone neuropsychological test battery described here provides an economical and reliable method for assessing cognitive function in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension .

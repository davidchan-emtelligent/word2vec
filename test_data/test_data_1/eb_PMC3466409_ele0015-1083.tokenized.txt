infectious disease ecology has recently raised its public profile beyond the scientific community due to the major threats that wildlife infections pose to biological conservation , animal welfare , human health and food security .
as we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious diseases , there is an urgent need to facilitate multidisciplinary research in this area .
even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component , cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists .
building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area , we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling , fieldwork and laboratory work .
modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field - based research programme , from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis .
we illustrate our model - guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases : plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in american and african bats .
these demonstrate that mechanistic models , if properly integrated in research programmes , can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems .
field ecology infectious diseases mathematical models statistical models study design wildlife epidemiology introduction concluding a report on the controversy surrounding ross and waite 's pioneering mathematical models for malaria transmission , the british medical journal pointed out , in 1911 , ' the paradox that quantitative work based on false postulates may , by stimulating biologists and field workers to a closer scrutiny of the facts , sometimes lead more certainly to the discovery of the truth , than non - quantitative investigations resting on impeccable foundations ' .
a hundred years later , and despite the ubiquity of mathematical models in all fields of life sciences , the statement retains remarkable pertinence. by describing mathematically the unobserved mechanisms hypothesised to be causing biological phenomena ( e.g. the boom - and - bust nature of epidemics or the cyclical fluctuations of animal populations ) in a newtonian fashion , ross and other early modellers finally brought life sciences on a par with physical sciences .
mechanistic models have come to form the backbone of modern teaching and research in ecology .
the mainstream use of mathematical models in ecology , sometimes referred to as strategic modelling ( gurney & nisbet 1998 ) , aims to formulate simple descriptions of universal drivers of population dynamics .
over the last century , this approach has provided useful insight into general principles of ecology and has helped ecologists generate testable hypotheses .
however , it is not always clear to scientists working on a particular system what added value such generic models can bring .
this stems from the conceptual , technical and , at times , cultural difficulties faced when trying to match models with empirical information , as experienced by anyone working at the interface of theoretical and empirical research .
in principle , mathematical models can be embedded in broader frameworks for scientific investigation based on hypothesis generation and experimental falsification or validation .
it is almost 50 years since platt ( 1964 ) laid out the principles of strong inference and advocated an iterative process of formulating multiple alternative hypotheses , generating testable predictions , gathering experimental evidence and then revisiting the hypotheses in view of the evidence .
along the same lines , mechanistic models should evolve with the experimental evidence generated through the scientific process .
various textbooks , such as hilborn & mangel 's ( 1997 ) ecological detective , have greatly contributed to promoting model integration in population ecology .
this iterative process has been put into practice in ecology in various contexts , notably experimental planktonic prey - predator systems , where the systematic use of mathematical models has helped ascertain and quantify the respective roles of diverse factors , including resource availability ( fussmann et al. 2000 ) and genetic composition ( becks et al. 2010 ) , in the generation of complex trophic dynamics .
extending such approaches to natural populations poses many challenges , but there are examples of iterative implementation of observations , theory and experiments in field settings .
many of these have aimed to determine the drivers of population cycles , following a tradition set by volterra ( 1926 ) , and have encompassed a broad range of ecological factors and interactions : from the iconic canadian lynx - hare predator - prey system ( krebs et al .
2001 ) to the soay sheep population of st kilda island ( coulson et al .
2001 ) , and from the british red grouse and its parasites ( hudson et al .
1998 ) to the california red scale ( a pest of citrus trees ) and its parasitoid ( murdoch et al. 2006 ) .
however , the common thread to all these examples is that only after long time series ( several years if not decades ) of data had been collected did theoretical questions appear , leading ultimately to a cycle of mathematical models and experimental validation .
ecologists have generally failed to harness the power of mechanistic models for study design and data integration during early phases of field studies , which can limit the power of data analysis and inference at later stages .
what can we learn from retrospective studies to improve the flow of exchange between empirical and theoretical methods at the onset of a new programme of field - based research ?
this question is particularly topical in infectious disease ecology .
indeed , beyond the academic motivation of integrating pathogens into ecological frameworks ( lafferty et al .
2008 ) , wildlife infections have recently received a surge of attention in broader scientific and political communities because of the various threats they pose at the global level ( daszak et al .
2000 ) : to the conservation of the species affected ( blaustein & kiesecker 2002 ; haydon et al. 2006 ; frick et al .
2010 ) ; to ecosystem stability ( rizzo & garbelotto 2003 ) ; to the viability and trade of livestock infected from wildlife reservoirs ( siembieda et al .
2011 ) and to public health in human populations affected by zoonotic diseases ( kuiken et al. 2005 ). from a scientific point of view , infectious diseases in wildlife are particularly challenging ecological systems because their dynamics are determined by processes operating at multiple scales ( table 1 ) , and because of practical difficulties with data collection in populations that are often difficult to observe or sample .
understanding these key processes requires input from many disciplines , using multiple methodologies and analysing diverse datasets to triangulate the causal drivers of disease dynamics ( plowright et al. 2008 ) .

( 2008 ) in this study , we emphasise the benefits of integrating mathematical and statistical models with empirical and experimental approaches at all stages of a research project , with the first iteration preceding data collection .
this not only improves hypothesis generation and study design but also increases the quantity and quality of information gained from empirical studies .
to this aim , we present a practical framework called model - guided fieldwork ( mgf ) , which demands a rational dialogue between researchers from multiple disciplines through a series of iterative steps , ultimately leading to improved causal inference and predictive power .
while the vast majority of ecologists are aware of the usefulness of mathematical models , a lack of interdisciplinary expertise within research teams all too often prevents models from being used to their full potential .
we aim to provide guidelines for ' good practice ' in multidisciplinary ecological research , largely inspired by our own experience in wildlife disease ecology .
in the mgf framework , biologists and modellers collaborate at all stages of the study , from initial model formulation and field study design , to data collection and analysis .
the mgf approach recognises that there is often uncertainty in system structure and drivers , and utilises a priori mechanistic models to ensure field efforts can address this uncertainty .
a key strength of the mgf approach is the planned iterative refinement of fieldwork , laboratory experiments and modelling throughout the project , ensuring empirical studies are more focused and models are data driven and appropriate to the specific system .
compared to after - the - fact modelling approaches , mgf helps to focus field studies on the most important structures and drivers of dynamics .
furthermore , the necessary continuous dialogue between collaborators throughout the project lifespan fosters a multidisciplinary , multidirectional flow of information ( fig. 1 ) .
it is important to underline that we envisage the framework shown in fig. 1 as a strategic master plan that may unfold over several years , and which would be broken down into a number of smaller studies .
however , it would be misleading to consider the large multidirectional framework as the mere juxtaposition of separate unidirectional studies .
in the mgf programme , modellers and biologists are involved in all steps , creating feedback loops that are missing from too many studies .

numbers refer to the five key steps described in the text ; however , it is possible to initiate the collaborative cycle at any stage .
dark grey boxes represent tasks led by modellers , light grey rounded boxes tasks led by biologists and a gradient indicates shared responsibility ( online version in colour : blue for modellers' tasks , green for biologists' tasks ) .
below we describe the mgf framework in detail , emphasising the practical contributions that modellers can make to the conception , design , implementation and analysis of field studies .
as illustrated in fig. 1 , the five key stages presented here should not be seen as a linear process , but as steps on a cycle of interactions that can be initiated from any point and reiterated multiple times .
we then present two case studies illustrating different components of the mgf framework .
finally , the discussion summarises the scientific benefits of the approach and casts light on the inner workings and the challenges faced when breaking barriers between traditional disciplines .
the level of involvement required from all parties goes against the high level of specialisation prevalent in science ; we provide some suggestions about planning and organisation in a multidisciplinary context , with insight from social sciences .
description of the mgf framework ecological model generation : from the conceptual to the mathematical mechanistic models are a formalisation of the hypothesised processes that drive the observed dynamics of a biological system .
some of these processes may be measured in real time in the field ( e.g. births ) , others may be measured in controlled conditions ( e.g. duration of infectious period ) , while others may not be observable ( e.g. transmission of infection from individual to individual ) .
the first step of mgf is to integrate the evidence - based , qualitative and quantitative descriptions of these processes into a formal mathematical model that attempts to describe the dynamics of observed variables - - in disease ecology , typically numbers of individuals in different categories ( e.g. age , sex , infectious or immunological status ) .
particularly when limited information is available about the nature of a process , one should consider multiple hypotheses in a strong inference approach ( platt 1964 ) : instead of trying to falsify a single hypothesis , it is often more informative to formulate a comprehensive set of biologically plausible , alternative hypotheses and assess their relative merits to explain available data .
for example , the relative importance of multiple routes of transmission ( webb et al. 2006 ; rohani et al .
2009 ) or multiple drivers of epidemic cycles ( wearing & rohani 2006 ) can be assessed using mechanistic modelling approaches once data have been collected .
although more heuristic methods for hypothesis generation can be used , mgf forces researchers to be extremely specific in detailing their questions of interest and underlying assumptions .
this specificity helps to ensure that the data collected will be appropriate for the analyses planned later ( fig. 1 ) .
once a conceptual mechanistic model of the system has been proposed and formalised in diagrams and verbal description , theoreticians translate it into a mechanistic mathematical model , checking the appropriateness of every assumption with the interdisciplinary team .
where existing modelling frameworks do not appear suitable , novel , tailor - made model structures can be designed , or a combination of models may be used for different parts of the system .
designing model structures ( i.e. equations describing the temporal or spatiotemporal changes in biological variables ) will highlight essential parameters and appropriate methods of estimation : either direct measurement or indirect inference by fitting models to the data .
identification of the parameters in itself guides the experimental and field study design ( fig. 1 ) .
modellers must ensure that the parameters are correctly interpreted .
for quantities that can be measured in the field , it is important to check that the mathematical parameters have the same dimension as the measurements .
conversely , when the model includes parameters that cannot be measured directly , the team should try to find practical ways in which the estimates of those parameters , once fitted , can be validated indirectly .
for example , in a model for epidemics , the transmission rate in itself is typically of little practical use , but it can be combined with other parameters to form the basic reproductive rate of the epidemic , which has an intuitive interpretation and practical implications .
because the correct interpretation of a parameter depends on the way it is included mathematically in the equations , it is also important to discuss the choice of alternative functions describing key processes in the ecological system considered .
partially specified models ( wood 2001 ) can also be considered when there is uncertainty in the choice of mathematical functions .
in some cases , the choice of model structure may not be straightforward .
for example , most models for the population dynamics of infectious diseases assume that individuals will go through a small number of discrete states during the process of infection , typically : susceptible ( uninfected ) , latent ( infected but not infectious ) , infectious and recovered ( often with lifelong protective immunity ) .
even if the studied infection follows this general progression , individuals may not be unambiguously assigned to a single status ( mcclintock et al .
2010 ) ; for example , it is often impossible to know from a measured antibody titre whether the animal is currently infected or whether it is immune against future infection .
complementary experimental data are often needed to provide this kind of information , and further model refinement may be required to incorporate this biological richness ( charleston et al. 2011 ) .
the most relevant level of aggregation of individuals into discrete categories must be discussed carefully , taking into account the accuracy of the measurements available , the complexity of the model and the corresponding statistical methods .
if not considered properly , these issues can lead to an ill - posed question , i.e. a situation where the results are of no practical use , as reviewed by loehle ( 2011 ) .
model exploration once a draft model is constructed , its dynamics must be explored over a wide range of parameter values and alternative assumptions using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations ( e.g. plowright et al. 2011 ) .
patterns that the model can generate , and qualitative features expected in the data ( duke - sylvester et al .
2010 ) can be identified , such as the existence and stability of equilibrium states , steady or waning oscillations ( hampson et al .
2007 ) or extinction of either the host or the infectious agent ( lloyd - smith et al. 2005 ) .
as described in the next section , this initial analysis will inform the design of the field study ( e.g. how many observations or samples are required to detect hypothesised changes in disease dynamics ?) , and can highlight flaws in the model ( e.g. if it fails to replicate known dynamics , such as oscillations , or predicts an unrealistic prevalence of infection ) .
this ' feasibility assessment ' stage ( fig. 1 ) helps the scientific team identify aspects of the system that are poorly understood and need further empirical study or updates to the model structure .
sensitivity analysis is another essential process that helps focus data collection effort on the most important parameters , by determining how changes in parameters affect model output ( blower & dowlatabadi 1994 ; cariboni et al. 2007 ) .
highly sensitive parameters may require more measurement effort because the model output is more dependent on these parameters. from a mathematical viewpoint , sensitivity analysis should explore most of the parameter space .
the biological range of some parameters can be quite wide , especially when considering a variety of environmental conditions .
in many cases , however , the most relevant biological information results from a more local sensitivity analysis in the parameter space , which can be loosely determined from previous knowledge .
local sensitivity analysis is useful because there is often interdependence in parameter values and sensitivities , and this informed process can help to reduce data collection effort by focusing on the most relevant region of the parameter space .
determining interactions between parameters can also help pre - empt issues with identifiability that may appear at a later stage , by suggesting simplifications in the model .
a typical example would be a pair of parameters governing reproduction and mortality in perfectly symmetric ways , which could result in population dynamics affected by the ratio ( or the difference ) of the two parameters rather than their absolute values : the pair of parameters can then be replaced with a single aggregate parameter .
study design the design of ecological studies should aim to maximise the information that can be obtained from the data within the practical constraints imposed by the system .
although sample size calculations have become a standard practice in life sciences , mechanistic models are rarely used at this stage of empirical research .
once a priori models have been developed , as outlined in the previous section , they can help suggest how field data should be collected to optimise integration with other data sources .
for example , de jong & bouma ( 2001 ) described a practical experimental framework for the measurement of vaccine - induced herd immunity in animal populations , based on a generic mathematical model for disease transmission .
using mechanistic models ahead of field studies can improve the reliability of data collection .
craft et al .
( 2009 ) built a network model based on data describing the social interactions among serengeti lions , and used it to run simulations of disease outbreaks .
they quantified the impact of several properties of the empirically derived network on the outcome of the simulations , and highlighted potential biases caused by the way data had been collected .
although this analysis was conducted on a post hoc basis , such advice can help with the design of future field studies .
furthermore , modelling exercises can suggest additional measurements that had been overlooked .
rohani et al .
( 2009 ) demonstrated theoretically that environmental transmission could play a more significant role than previously acknowledged during outbreaks of avian influenza , which should encourage measurements for the presence of influenza viruses in the environment .
in another example , plowright et al .
( 2011 ) developed a metapopulation model to simulate the dynamics of hendra virus within fruit bat populations , thus providing a mechanistic explanation of increasing spillover from fruit bats into domestic horses in australia .
the inclusion of waning maternal immunity in the model improved the temporal match of simulated outbreaks to the observed ones .
although the presence of maternally derived antibody ( mda ) has been reported , measurement of waning immunity itself in wild animals may not be feasible ; instead experimental studies on captive bats could be carried out to test the hypothesis that mda is protective and to derive empirical estimates of the rate of mda decline .
model fitting a crucial step of mgf comes when the model has been designed and the data have been collected : matching the two together with the help of statistical modelling .
the first objective is usually to estimate the value of model parameters that were not known at the time of model construction .
in the case where alternative hypotheses have been incorporated into different models , an additional objective is to assess which hypothesis provides the ' best fit ' of the model to the data .
what is meant by ' best fit ' is an essential question that needs to be addressed by all the parties involved , biologists , modellers and statisticians , even before the data have been collected .
although a number of methods for curve fitting , such as smoothing , least squares or non - linear forecasting , have been traditionally employed for ecological time series ( kendall et al .
1999 ) , they tend to consider the sources of error and variability as black boxes .
in contrast , likelihood - based models can incorporate specific error - generating mechanisms ( e.g. demographic stochasticity , sampling methods , imperfect assays ) , and therefore generate more reliable predictions ( clark & bjornstad 2004 ) .
combined with information criteria ( such as akaike 's information criterion ) , they also allow multiple model comparison and weighting ( burnham & anderson 2001 ) .
likelihood - based methods allow the computation of confidence intervals on parameter estimates , providing evidence to compare the relative importance of the mechanisms considered .
the last two decades have seen considerable advancement in the statistical methods available to fit dynamic models to empirical data , especially in the field of infectious diseases ( becker & britton 1999 ) .
an increasingly popular approach is to use a bayesian framework , which offers several advantages .
first , all model parameters follow probability distributions rather than being treated as fixed quantities .
this enables measures of parameter uncertainty to be generated .
second , the bayesian framework allows prior information ( e.g. parameter ranges obtained from available data sources , such as published papers ) to be incorporated into the model structure .
this is somewhat controversial as poor choices of priors can unduly influence the final estimates .
however , where reliable information is available , a careful use of priors can help to ensure that the parameter estimates obtained are realistic .
indeed , certain combinations of parameter values that fall outside of meaningful biological ranges might happen to produce a perfect fit to the data by virtue of the mathematical properties of the model , but the use of prior information can help maintain parameters within biologically appropriate ranges .
third , in the bayesian framework , any missing information in the data ( e.g. due to incomplete observations or long time intervals between repeated measurements ) can be treated as extra parameters in the model , and estimated as part of the model fitting process ( o'neill & roberts 1999 ; clark & bjornstad 2004 ) .
recent methods have also been developed to deal with missing information within a frequentist framework ( ionides et al. 2006 ) .
other new techniques , such as approximate bayesian computation , provide a natural framework to estimate parameters in stochastic ecological models ( hartig et al .
2011 ) , which are particularly relevant for infectious disease dynamics. whether using bayesian or frequentist statistical models , a constant dialogue must be maintained between all parties involved .
indeed , the fitting process must be informed by the biologists to ensure the data are correctly interpreted and meaningfully analysed .
it is not uncommon that data collection differs in various degrees from the initial plans because of logistical issues or unexpected field conditions .
this may require a reassessment of the fitting procedures to account for missing data .
it also is essential to submit every output from data analysis to a reality check by the field biologists : for example , unrealistic parameter estimates might reveal flaws in models , guiding the selection of alternative models or the revision of unsuitable assumptions .
as a result , it is not unusual for the process of fitting models to data to take several months to complete .
the numerical algorithms involved are often very complex , with risk of human error , and can take several days to run , even on modern computers .
model validation the first step of validation is the assessment of the ' goodness of fit ' of the model ( s ) .
even though model fitting procedures aim to minimise the difference between observations and model prediction and to select the best - supported model , substantial discrepancies may remain .
statistical tests can be used to assess whether the remaining differences ( or residuals ) between the fitted model and the actual data may be attributed to random noise .
however , such tests must be interpreted with caution : statistical support does not guarantee that the model assumptions are correct ; conversely , a statistically significant discrepancy should not necessarily lead to a rejection of the mechanistic model as a whole .
the value of any model lies in its ability to improve our understanding of specific processes , which does not necessarily require a perfect match to all the mechanisms of the real system .
therefore , a subjective assessment of model dynamics , informed by biological knowledge , remains important - - this is another ' reality check ' at the core of the mgf process ( fig. 1 ) .
predictions from a fitted model should always be discussed critically in the context of both the model structure and the data collected .
the second step of validation confronts predictions of the model with an independent set of data , i.e. data not used in the fitting procedure .
for example , if the same variables have been measured in two different locations that differ in known characteristics , once the model has been fitted to the data from one site , it can be used to predict the observations in the other location by modifying certain parameter values accordingly .
alternatively , where several variables have been measured in a single study , it is possible to fit the model to a subset of variables and then use the model to predict the dynamics of the remaining variables .
if successful , this step is strong evidence that some fundamentally important aspects of the system have been captured by the mechanistic model .
this allows the researchers to draw conclusions about the causes of observed patterns .
thus , once a valid model is produced , it will help assess the original set of hypotheses .
if the model fails this step of validation , it is worth reconsidering alternative models that may have been proposed in the early stages and discarded on the basis of the original fitting procedure .
however , as in the previous step of validation , some discrepancies should be expected when confronting model predictions to independent data : again , this should not trigger an automatic rejection of the model , but rather encourage a critical assessment of its assumptions through discussion between modellers and empirical biologists .
in particular , the magnitude of the discrepancies that can be accepted should be informed by the biology of the system , by potential uncertainties introduced by data collection procedures , and by the type of model - generated predictions sought .
this step of validation can result in modifications of the model as well as additional experiments ; these iterative improvements are at the core of the mgf philosophy .
lastly , a third component of model validation is an assessment of the relative importance of the model parameters .
there are two relatively common approaches for this .
the first one uses an information criterion framework that penalises the explanatory power of models by their complexity ( number of parameters ) , as described in step 4 above for model selection .
once the best model has been identified , it may still be possible to simplify it further , e.g. by setting the values of some parameters to zero and assessing the effect on the information criterion .
the second approach is to use sensitivity analysis on a single validated model to determine the relative importance of different processes incorporated in that single model .
in this approach , parameters are associated with particular processes of interest ( e.g. transmission pathways ) .
parameters that strongly affect the behaviour of models ( i.e. which have high sensitivity ) are associated with relatively important processes. by submitting fitted models to detailed scrutiny , the scientific team should aim to identify any remaining discrepancies and issues , leading to further iterations of model improvement and data collection .
components of the models that failed the validation tests can be more informative than those that passed , which echoes the 1911 quote cited in the opening of this study .
indeed , a key aspect of mgf is that the model is not an end point .
as in a strong inference perspective ( platt 1964 ) , the inference drawn from the model should generate new questions and hypotheses that can be investigated through another cycle of mgf ( fig. 1 ) .
case studies the mgf framework represents a flexible and modular set of guidelines for ambitious , long - term research programmes in ecology .
in most cases , such programmes will progress through a series of specific research objectives corresponding to subsets of the whole framework .
appreciating from the onset how mathematical models can contribute to those different steps is not an obvious task , but one that requires patience and commitment from all parties involved .
as mentioned in the introduction , the mgf framework is not meant as a rigid , one - size - fits - all set of rules , but as a guideline for multidisciplinary integration .
to demonstrate how mgf research can be implemented from different premises , we present detailed accounts of this process using two case studies from our own research .
whereas the first case study ( plague transmission in prairie dogs , fig. 2 ) followed steps 1 - 5 quite naturally , the second one ( lyssaviruses in bats , figs 3 and 4 ) combines two initially independent projects which started at different points along the cycle until it was realised they could complement each other within an mgf approach .
figure 2 application of mgf to plague ( yersinia pestis ) in prairie dogs ( cynomys ludovicianus ) .
the aim was to assess the relative importance of different routes of transmission of y. pestis in causing observed extinctions of prairie dog towns .
figure 3 application of mgf to bat rabies virus in big brown bats ( eptesicus fuscus ) .
this study aimed at assessing the role of seasonal hibernation and birth pulses in the persistence of rabies virus in bat populations .
here , most data were collected before a formal mathematical model was developed .
figure 4 application of mgf to lagos bat virus ( lbv ) in straw - coloured fruit bats ( eidolon helvum ) .
this ongoing research programme is investigating the interactions between bat life history ( age structure , migrations , seasonal birth pulses ) and the circulation of lbv .
the modelling framework is being developed in conjunction with data collection and with input from the project on rabies virus in big brown bats .
plague transmission in prairie dogs black - tailed prairie dogs ( cynomys ludovicianus ) are extremely susceptible to plague and exhibit epizootic die - offs resulting in the apparent extinction of prairie dog towns .
researchers wished to determine the mechanisms underlying these spectacular die - offs to better understand how they occur and might be managed .
according to the dominant paradigm in the literature , yersinia pestis , the aetiological agent of plague , forms a biofilm that blocks the proventriculus of fleas feeding on mammals ; transmission occurs when infectious bacteria from the blockage are regurgitated .
models that assumed blocked flea transmission as the only process predicted flea loads that were inconsistent with those observed in the field ( lorange et al. 2005 ; webb et al. 2006 ). from these results and other observations , field researchers questioned the relevance of the dominant assumption to the prairie dog system , especially because the paradigm was based on transmission in a peridomestic system that differs in several important features from plague outbreaks in wildlife populations ( gage & kosoy 2005 ) .
plague has a rich and long scientific literature including many older studies with valuable information from detailed laboratory and field observations for different species of rodent hosts and flea vectors .
under closer scrutiny by empirical researchers and modellers , the literature revealed an array of proposed transmission mechanisms that could broadly be classified into three types : blocked flea transmission , pneumonic transmission and transmission from a short - term reservoir .
this led to the development of a mechanistic model that incorporated those three alternative transmission pathways ( webb et al. 2006 ) .
most model parameters were taken from literature on prairie dogs or closely related species , although field data were used to estimate three remaining parameters using multiple methods including fitting procedures to the proposed model and estimation separate from the model .
a stochastic version of the model was used to predict the probability of extinction of prairie dogs and fleas and the time to extinction .
these predictions were validated using an independent 20 - year data set of observed outbreaks .
the model achieved a reasonable match to the observed data , and sensitivity analysis revealed that transmission from a short - term reservoir was the only route consistent with the observed data .
this led to specific recommendations for data collection , initiating a new cycle of mgf ( fig. 2 ) .
in particular , multiple hypotheses were consistent with the short - term reservoir scenario and constraints on the infectious period of the short - term reservoir predicted by the model , including early - phase transmission before blockage occurred , transmission from carcasses and transmission from alternative infected hosts .
based on the model , a series of experiments established that early - phase transmission was feasible in a laboratory setting ( eisen et al. 2006 ; wilder et al .
2008 ) , and measured the decay of infectiousness from carcasses .
in parallel , data were also collected on infection rates in alternative hosts ( stapp & salkeld 2009 ) .
this field and laboratory work corresponds to phase 3 in mgf ( fig. 2 ) .
finally , the new data were incorporated into more specific models that accounted for the newly proposed transmission mechanisms and which were then validated ( salkeld et al. 2010 ; buhnerkempe et al .
2011 ) , corresponding to steps 4 and 5 in mgf ( fig. 2 ) .
the two different models that were developed need to be reconciled , but overall it appears likely that early - phase transmission drives the initial spread of epizootics with secondary roles for other transmission routes once host limitation occurs ( buhnerkempe et al. 2011 ) .
seasonal dynamics of lyssaviruses in bats the role of bats as reservoirs of zoonotic viral infections is increasingly recognised ( calisher et al. 2006 ) .
rabies virus and related lyssaviruses are important pathogens of bat origin ( badrane & tordo 2001 ) ; however , mechanisms of persistence of lyssaviruses in populations of bats and the drivers thereof have not been well described .
we have recently led two projects investigating the effects of two different seasonal behaviours on bat lyssavirus infection dynamics : hibernation in a temperate bat species and migration in a tropical bat species .
in contrast to the previous case study which was a direct illustration of the mgf guidelines , this one shows the synergy that can be gained by combining several threads of research into the mgf framework .
hibernation and rabies virus infection in big brown bats the first part of our case study focused on rabies virus persistence in a big brown bat ( eptesicus fuscus ) population roosting in buildings in fort collins , colorado .
in this study , modellers relied on a post hoc synthesis of field and laboratory data to develop a population - level model for the seasonal dynamics of rabies virus , which was then validated with independent data ( george et al. 2011 ) .
thus , this project effectively implemented steps 3 , 4 and 5 of the mgf framework ( fig. 3 ) .
the project was initiated by field and laboratory scientists aiming to estimate host demographic parameters that were previously unavailable. from the onset of the 5 - year field phase of the project , empirical estimates of bat demographic and infection - related parameters were obtained ( step 3 ) .
field work included radio - tracking of bats and permanently tagging ( wimsatt et al .
2005 ) several thousand individual bats at multiple colonies , which provided estimates of survival rates ( o'shea et al. 2011b ) .
reproductive rates were quantified by assessing the breeding status of captured females ( o'shea et al. 2010 ) .
the project also considered epidemiological parameters of the bat population , including determination of rabies seroprevalence and assessment of infection prevalence .
interpretation of serology data was helped by exposure experiments on captive big brown bats ( shankar et al. 2004 ; davis et al. 2007 ; turmelle et al .
2010 ) and a statistical model for estimating the rate of exposure based on seroprevalence and seroconversion data from marked bats ( george et al. 2011 ) .
the mathematical model consisted of three submodels that described the hibernation period ( when no transmission occurs ) , pre - transmission period in early spring and the main transmission period ( when transmission was assumed to follow a classical seir framework ) .
other structures representing alternative hypotheses were considered for the pre - transmission period where less was known .
combined results of demographic and serological sampling in the field , results of experimental exposure studies and information from the literature allowed modellers to estimate or bound model parameters .
the model was validated with independent data from the study population , including population size ( o'shea et al. 2011a ) , size of the infectious class ( george et al .
2011 ) and the timing of the peak number of rabies cases in different age classes ( o'shea et al. 2011a ) .
the model suggests that rabies virus is maintained in the population because the system is essentially in stasis during the hibernation period , which allows persistence of infection until the spring birth pulse ( george et al. 2011 ) .
although this project did not begin with the design of a mathematical model , the field and experimental biologists had an unusually clear conceptual model initially and worked closely with modellers as data collection was ending .
although , in hindsight , this project could have benefitted from an earlier involvement of the modellers , it has demonstrated how empirical researchers and modellers effectively iterated several steps of mgf post hoc ( fig. 3 ) .
the resultant model would not have been possible or compelling without the field and laboratory data generated at different stages of the project ; the modelling allowed integration of empirical information to ensure that new insights were made with regards to rabies maintenance in the host population and tested alternative hypotheses regarding the pre - transmission season .
in addition , this provided us with a starting point to develop a model for our next study .
migration and lbv in straw - coloured fruit bats the second part of our case study on bat - lyssavirus systems concerns lagos bat virus ( lbv ) , a lyssavirus that has been isolated from the african frugivorous bat eidolon helvum ( boulger & porterfield 1958 ) .
this project exemplifies how emerging infectious disease research can be undertaken when little prior knowledge exists .
a high prevalence of antibodies against lbv had been detected in this migratory species ( hayman et al. 2008 ; kuzmin et al .
2008 ) , which led us to formulate three overarching questions .
given that most lyssaviruses were thought to have high lethality rates in any mammalian host they infect , could lbv remain endemic in e. helvum ?
how would the spatiotemporal structure of bat populations at the continental scale affect viral persistence ?
could e. helvum act as a reservoir for zoonotic spillover into human and livestock populations ?
eidolon helvum often roosts in enormous colonies reaching several million bats ( sorensen & halberg 2001 ) , which have been documented to form and disperse seasonally across sub - saharan africa , in both urban and rural environments .
based on this prior knowledge , we set out to address our three questions , with an initial focus on the capital of ghana , accra , home to a large colony of e. helvum in close contact with city - dwellers .
we have concentrated our attention on two main factors : heterogeneity in host populations ( e.g. variations in prevalence with location or age ) and potential seasonal forcing of transmission caused by the seasonal migratory and reproductive behaviours of e. helvum .
we have been addressing these issues following the mgf framework ( fig. 4 ) and using to our advantage the knowledge acquired through the big brown bat study .
using the limited knowledge available on the life cycle of e. helvum ( mutere 1967 ) and the dynamics of other bat lyssaviruses ( mondul et al. 2003 ; harris et al .
2006 ) , we initiated the project with a simple ecological model ( fig. 4 , step 1 ) , based on the hypotheses that lbv infection in e. helvum can be transmitted horizontally within bat populations and results in protective immunity , given the high seroprevalence detected .
given the lack of empirical information on those two hypotheses , the model - design process generated a large number of more specific questions concerning , in particular , the existence of protective maternal antibodies , the duration of immunity and the lethality of infection .
the absence of quantitative information on the ecology and demography of the bats meant that demographic studies were also necessary .
thus , over a few years , we iteratively accrued data and parameter estimates through diverse field studies of the host , the pathogen and their environment , combined with a series of demographic and epidemiological mathematical models ( fig. 4 , repeated loops between steps 2 and 3 ) .
we have been conducting in parallel field - based studies of wild populations , surveys of captive bats maintained in semi - natural conditions and laboratory - based development of immunological and virological assays ( hayman et al .
2011 ) , all guided by and feeding back into the modelling framework .
the large colony sizes of e. helvum roosts largely exceed the number of bats that can be studied using a traditional capture - recapture marking survey .
simulations based on expected survival rates suggested that radio - telemetry as a method of redetection of around 100 tagged bats in the colony over a whole season would give reliable estimates of survival ( hayman et al. 2012b ) .
other approaches , such as the estimation of ages using tooth - cementum ring analyses , have enabled us to estimate age - specific seroprevalence , and hence infection rates ( hayman et al. 2012a ) .
to address the unresolved issue of protective acquired immunity in bats , a captive , wild - caught colony is now being studied. by sampling these bats regularly , we are seeking to determine whether serological parameters vary over time , whether all individuals are born susceptible and whether seropositive bats may be persistently infected .
alongside this ongoing empirical work , we are now adapting the seasonal model developed by george et al .
( 2011 ) for rabies virus in big brown bats , to lbv in e. helvum .
once data collection from captive bats is complete , we will be ready to move to step 4 and fit our updated transmission model to empirical data .
discussion we have presented a detailed framework for mgf and described , through case studies , different methods of implementation .
key differences between mgf and more commonly applied approaches to modelling ecological dynamics are the early - stage input from both modellers and biologists into study design , incorporation of multiple hypotheses and uncertainty about structure in the determination of the data required and the iterative approach between models and measurement .
post hoc modelling studies have an important role to play to complement traditional data analysis and generate new predictions .
however , such studies tend to be limited in their scope and power if the modellers were not involved in study design .
a lack of mutual understanding or communication between the modellers and the scientists who collected the data can cause lengthy adjustments of the model , can result in parts of the data being unusable due to their inadequate collection or reporting and may bring into question the reliability of the predictions generated .
when undertaken properly , mgf allows the assessment of multiple system - specific hypotheses that relate to unobserved mechanisms , by combining information from different organisational levels ( individual hosts , populations and landscapes ) .
this information often comes from diverse sources , such as field surveys , laboratory experiments and surveillance , that can be integrated into the modelling framework .
while we put fieldwork at the core of mgf as the fundamental source of data and observations on wildlife ecology , our framework can incorporate complementary data sources , such as experiments involving captive animals .
as a result of this broader integration , the data gathered will be exploited to their full potential and will thus lead to richer and more reliable conclusions and predictions .
beyond the technical aspects that we have described in detail , mgf provides a framework for adaptively managing the human dimension of interdisciplinary research collaborations .
indeed , the iterative process allows input from all disciplines at multiple points , helping to resolve or avoid altogether counter - productive situations where modellers are asked to develop a model without sufficient data or where field biologists are handed a model with inappropriate assumptions .
however , even within this framework , there are critical capabilities that must be developed within the research group as a whole to ensure an efficient and durable collaboration .
first , the group must define common goals and questions ( gorman et al .
2012 ) , which is not as easy to achieve as it may sound .
too often in research , interdisciplinary collaborators draw targets around their current personal research interests rather than defining superordinate goals and then agreeing on the means to achieve them .
the mgf approach essentially forces participants to develop shared questions and goals before the research is undertaken .
second , members of the collaboration need to develop ' moral imagination ' which involves seeing the problems from the perspective of other stakeholders ( gorman et al. 2012 ) .
often researchers from different fields will have fundamentally different perspectives on how to tackle a problem , aptly described by gorman et al .
( 2001 ) who stated that ' most scholars like to share frameworks about as much as they like to share toothbrushes ' .
hence , the third capability , developing ' trading zones' ( galison 1997 ) , is necessary for exchanging ideas or sharing data and resources .
all three of these capabilities can be facilitated by ' interactional experts' - - individuals who understand enough of the disciplinary cultures and languages to facilitate a common language , common goals , shared mental models , exchange of knowledge and a shared framework for investigation ( gorman 2010 ) .
such expertise has traditionally been gained over long periods of personal collaborations , but more opportunities are now available for early - career training through formal courses and workshops .
for example , in mgf , interactional experts would include veterinarians with post - graduate training in mathematical modelling , immunologists with training in ecology or mathematicians with a training in epidemiology .
both offer and demand for such interdisciplinary training need to be encouraged .
now is an exciting time to implement mgf approaches .
there is increasing emphasis on the need for multi - or interdisciplinary studies of many systems , particularly regarding the emergence of infectious disease threats to biodiversity and public health ( wolfe et al. 2007 ; jones et al. 2008 ) .
many national and international funding bodies have started to support actively the integration of empirical research with modelling , or model - guided predictions , not only in their core programmes but also increasingly in direct response to emerging epizootics ( e.g. white nose syndrome in north american bats ) or zoonoses ( e.g. pandemic swine influenza ) .
one area where real progress can be made at low additional cost through mgf approaches is pathogen or disease surveillance - - a point apparently overlooked by kuiken et al .
( 2005 ) in their call to arms to tackle emerging zoonotic infections .
such approaches to surveillance would potentially increase the return on investment by addressing traditional surveillance questions as well as more mechanistic ones .
although we have focused our attention on wildlife infections , the mgf framework would be equally useful in other areas of applied ecological research where mechanistic models could help devise quantitative predictions for intervention , as indicated by retrospective reviews , e.g. on pest management ( murdoch et al. 2006 ) .
potential applications include the management of invasive species , conservation of biodiversity in the face of climate change or the sustainability of human exploitation of natural resources .
advice to policy makers in these fields all too often relies on ' expert opinion ' , a euphemism for the subjective synthesis of vast amounts of scientific evidence and personal experience. by providing a rigorous framework for the construction of such syntheses , the mgf approach has the potential to become a standard for evidence - based environmental policies .
explicit embedding of mgf approaches into policy directed programmes can be achieved using frameworks such as participatory impact pathways analysis ( alvarez et al. 2010 ) .
a clearly defined pathway towards a successful outcome can provide incentives for all scientists to engage in what for many could be an unfamiliar and uncomfortable , albeit hugely exciting , process .

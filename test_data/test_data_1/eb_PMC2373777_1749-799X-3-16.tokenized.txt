background the purpose of the study is to retrospectively review the clinical outcome of our study population of middle - aged ra patients who had suffered extensor - tendon rupture .
we reported the outcome of autogenous palmaris tendon grafting of multiple extensor tendons at wrist level in 14 middle - aged rheumatoid patients .
methods between feb .
2000 to feb .
2004 , thirty - six ruptured wrist level extensor tendons were reconstructed in fourteen rheumatoid patients ( 11 women and three men ) using autogenous palmaris longus tendon as a free interposition graft .
in each case , the evaluation was based on both subjective and objective criteria , including the range of mcp joint flexion after surgery , the extension lag at the metacarpophalangeal joint before and after surgery , and the ability of the patient to work .
results and discussion the average of follow - up was 54.1 months ( range , 40 to 72 months ) .
the average range of mcp joint flexion after reconstruction was 66degrees .
the extension lag at the metacarpophalangeal joint significantly improved from a preoperative mean of 38degrees ( range , 25degrees - 60degrees ) to a postoperative mean of 16degrees ( range , 0degrees - 30degrees ) .
subjectively all patients were satisfied with the clinical results , and achieved a return to their level of ability before tendon rupture .
we found good functional results in our series of interposition grafting using palmaris longus to reconstruct extensor tendon defects in the rheumatoid patients .
conclusion reconstruction for multiple tendon ruptures is a salvage procedure that is often associated with extensor lag and impairment of overall function .
early aggressive treatment of extensor tendon reconstruction using autogenous palmaris longus tendon as a free interposition graft in the rheumatoid wrist is another viable option to achieve good clinical functional result .
background wrist involvement is common for patients afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , wrist level tendon rupture commonly occurring in the extensor tendons of the ring and small fingers .
once a tendon rupture at wrist level has occurred , surgical techniques such as traditional end - to - side tendon transfer ( suturing the distal portion of the ruptured tendon to an intact neighbouring tendon ) or tendon repair with end - to - end interposition grafting can provide acceptable restoration of finger extensor function subsequent to such procedures .
the purpose of the study is to retrospectively review the clinical outcome of our study population of 14 middle - aged ra patients who had suffered extensor - tendon rupture , and undergone tendon reconstruction incorporating autogenous palmaris tendon grafting of the multiple extensor tendon ( s ) at wrist level .
patients and methods thirty - six ruptured extensor tendons derived from fourteen ra patients ( 11 women and three men ) were reconstructed during the period feb .
2000 to feb .
2004 inclusively .
( table 1 ) the mean age of study participants at time of surgery was 47.3 years ( range , 32 - 66 years ) and their mean of time lag between tendon rupture and surgery was 9.4 weeks .
( range , 2 to 24 weeks ) all of the involved patients have received some level of medical treatment for their arthritic condition .
no patient had undergone any previous surgical treatment to their hand .
larsen 's x - ray classification [ 1 ] was used to assess the relative severity of the rheumatoid arthritis from which each study participant suffered .
in each case , we reconstructed extensor tendons using a section of autogenous palmaris longus tendon as a free interpositional tendon graft .
the presence of this tendon was determined before grafting procedure at our outpatient department .
fourteen consecutive patients were operated on by one surgeon ( j.t. shih ) .

for the next step , the extensor retinaculum divided between the 5th and the 6th compartments , and reflected radially .
following this , the extensor tendons were exposed , and the synovium over the free ends of the tendons removed using a synovial rongeur .
a dorsal synovectomy of the wrist was then completed , and the dorsal bony surfaces inspected for any bone spicules or abrasive irregularities that may have been present , all of which were subsequently removed .
next , the ruptured extensor tendons were identified , and mobilized as was deemed to be necessary , and the tendon ends were debrided and the defect in the length of the extensor tendon was estimated .
palmaris longus tendon was isolated by a transverse incision at wrist joint and then harvested using a tendon stripper or harvested through a number of small separate flexor incisions .
appropriate lengths of palmaris longus tendon were then used as free grafts to reconstitute the ruptured extensor tendons .
the distal end of the damaged tendon was then secured by a series of six - strand sutures method with 4 - 0 prolene which was placed through the tendon graft and each of the ruptured tendon ends .
( fig. 1 ) tensioning of the sutures was appropriately adjusted so that the graft was snug with the wrist in a position of 40degrees extension and with the metacarpophalangeal ( mcp ) joints in a 15degrees of flexion .
following this weaving of the proximal tendon stump was conducted using a pulvertaft weave [ 2 ] secured with six - strand suture per anastomosis , and the reconstructed tendons were passed under the retinaculum .
the repair was made in a position of 30degrees of wrist extension with the expectation that the repair wound stretch slightly as the wrist was exercised .
following this , the surgical wound was then closed .
figure 1 the extensor digitorum ( ed ) was reconstructed using free tendon grafting by means of a pulvertaft technique .
at the time of tendon reconstruction , synovectomy of the distal radio - ulnar joint was also completed using a darrach procedure for two cases in which the distal ulna was placed in a position of dorsal subluxation .
arthrodesis of the druj ( sauve - kapandji procedure ) was conducted for one patient 's wrist .
post - operative management postoperatively , the hand was immobilized in a splint , with the wrist in 30 degrees of extension position in order to relieve stress at the repair site , and to maintain the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints in a neutral position .
passive interphalangeal - joint exercises were initiated 24 - 48 hours postoperatively and light active mobilization of the metacarpophalangeal and the involved wrist joint was commenced at two weeks post - surgery .
the use of dynamic extensor tendon splintage for early mobilization of four weeks .
patients were weaned from the splint over a period of three days .
on removal of the splint , active range of motion and tendon gliding exercises were started .
the average of follow - up was 54.1 months ( range , 40 to 72 months ) .
the latest evaluation was based on both subjective and objective criteria , including the range of mcp joint flexion after surgery , the extension lag at the metacarpophalangeal joint before and after surgery , and the ability of the patient to work .
the active range of motion of all the study - participants' metacarpophalangeal joints flexion were measured subsequent to surgery .
in each case , the extension lag , as determined at the metacarpophalangeal joint , was assessed both prior to and following tendon - repair surgery with a goniometer .
pearson 's correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between the two quantitative variables .
the ability to work was evaluated on the basis of whether the patient had returned to his or her original occupation and was able to work full - time ( 100 percent ) or part - time ( 25 , 50 , or 75 percent of the normal time ) .
results clinical outcome fourteen rheumatoid - arthritis patients ( 36 tendon reconstructions ) were reviewed at an average of 54.1 months post surgery ( range , 40 - 72 ) .
the average range of mcp - joint flexion subsequent to reconstruction was 66degrees .
following surgery , the extension lag at the metacarpophalangeal joint had been significantly improved from a preoperative mean of 38degrees ( range , 25degrees - 60degrees ) to a postoperative mean of 16degrees ( range , 0degrees - 30degrees ) ( p < 0.05 ) .
( table 2 ) ( fig. 2 ) we found good functional improvements for the patients participating in our study , following interpositional grafting using palmaris longus tendon in order to reconstruct extensor tendon defects for the study - participating rheumatoid - arthritis patients .

discussion the extensor tendons and soft - tissue envelope are frequently compromised for ra patients .
for patients suffering wrist level extensor tendon rupture associated with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , primary tendon repair is generally not feasible .
this relates to the diffuse nature of the tendon damage that typically occurs in such patients , combined with fibrosis , atrophy , and retraction of the muscle , events that usually preclude effective tendon repair .
several different methods have been previously used to repair finger extensor - tendon ruptures at wrist level for the rheumatoid - arthritis patient [ 3 - 8 ] .
primary repair involves the end - to - end suture of the two ends of the damaged tendon , and , as best we are aware , is generally not feasible for rheumatoid patients , as a significant length of tendon is typically damaged by the mechanical attrition and inflammatory process that occurs following tendon rupture .
when multiple tendons are ruptured , the results of such surgical repair by any of these techniques are often unsatisfactory .
the diffuse nature of the tendon damage , combined with fibrosis , atrophy , and retraction of the muscle , usually precludes repair .
when rupture is diagnosed early , tendon grafting may be successful [ 9 ] .
some authors think that tendon grafting resulted in good correction of extension lag , but patients were dissatisfied with accompanying loss of digital flexion because of the long standing nature of the disease and decreased musculotendinous unit excursion , leading to loss of flexion following grafting [ 10 ] .
good results have been reported for tendon grafts , provided that the time from tendon rupture to surgery is short and muscle contracture is not allowed to become severe [ 9,11,12 ] .
interpositional grafting is able to be used as a surgical - repair technique for ruptured extensor tendons in order to overcome the problem of defects in the extensor mechanism where a portion of the relevant tendon has irreparably damaged and effectively lost .
the tendon graft can be placed directly in between the ruptured extensor - tendon ends , or alternatively , re - routed subcutaneously in order to avoid the diseased tendon bed [ 5 ] .
interpositional tendon grafting using palmaris longus to repair extensor - tendon defects has previously been described as constituting a technique that can be effectively used for the repair of ruptured finger - extensor tendons [ 13 ] .
the palmaris longus is the tendon of choice because it fulfils the requirements of length , diameter , and availability without producing a deformity .
this choice of technique for tendon grafting features the advantage of the source of donor tendon being readily accessible in the same forearm .
the presence of this tendon should be determined before any grafting procedure .
the tendon is reported to be present in one arm in 85 % of people and in both arms in 70 % .
if the pl tendon absence occurred in our patients who need autogenous tendon graft to reconstruction , long extensors of toes were our second choice .
the extensor of the third toe is probably easiest to remove and use .
the method is to make multiple short transverse incisions over the tendon and remove it by elevating the skin proximal to each incision and dissecting to a more proximal level ; then make another incision at this point and repeat the procedure .
extract the divided end of the tendon through each successive incision and remove it through the proximal incision .
on the basis of the results of the study , good functional outcomes can be achieved with end - to - end tendon - grafting technique using autogenous palmaris longus tendon graft .
the mean extension lag of the metacarpophalangeal joint following tendon grafting for our study participants was 16.4degrees , a figure which was somewhat better than the 30degrees figure reported in 1987 by bora et al .
[ 9 ] .
further , we observed that metacarpophalangeal - joint flexion was improved for all patients subsequent to surgery .
promoting tendon healing and avoiding joint adhesion are critical parts of the postoperative management of tendon reconstruction following tendon rupture .
in our study , the pulvertaft technique of weaving two tendons together was used , it provides a very - strong connection between the two grafted tendon ends , and a surgical repair technique that can then be loaded more quickly .
the feature of this technique makes the " early active " type of rehabilitative protocol ( we allowed the wrists active flexion within one month postoperatively in our series ) feasible for patients having undergone such a surgical - repair technique .
dynamic splinting following extensor tendon repair is becoming increasingly popular .
the use of dynamic outrigger splints which allow active flexion and extension of the interphalangeal ( ip ) joints and active flexion but only passive extension of the mp joints .
the dynamic splint combined with the tendon mobilization program provided the gliding necessary and was easy for the patient to comply with and understand [ 14 ] .
some studies relating to " early active " motion post surgical repair of ruptured extensor tendons have shown that patients who undergo early controlled , dynamic motion experienced improved damaged - hand function more rapidly than was the case for those more - immobilized patients , this shortening the overall total rehabilitation time required post such injury , and making dynamic motion treatment highly cost effective [ 15 ] .
reconstruction for multiple tendon ruptures is a salvage procedure that is often associated with extensor lag and impairment of overall hand function .
for our study , the mean age at surgery for study participants was 47.3 ( range , 32 - 66 ) years , the functional requirements of the injured hands of the patients participating in our study being highly " in demand " prospectively as regards these individuals' working lives .
the average range of mcp - joint flexion and the extension lag at the metacarpophalangeal joint for our study participants was shown to be improved significantly following reconstruction using autogenous palmaris longus tendon grafting .
conclusion in conclusion , multiple extensor - tendons reconstruction using autogenous palmaris longus tendon grafting for highly demand middle - aged rheumatoid arthritis patients is another viable option in order to achieve good clinical functional results post - operatively .

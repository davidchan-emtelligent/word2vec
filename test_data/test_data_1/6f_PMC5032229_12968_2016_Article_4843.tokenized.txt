unfortunately , diseased tissue adjacent to vasculature often remains hidden since there is poor contrast between hyperenhanced tissue and bright blood - pool .
conventional black - blood double - ir methods are not a solution ; these were not designed to function after contrast administration since they rely on the long native t1 of blood (~ 2s at 3t ) and adequate blood flow within this time period .
we introduce a novel flow - independent dark - blood delayed enhancement technique ( fiddle ) that allows visualization of tissue contrast - enhancement while suppressing blood - pool signal .
we validate fiddle in an animal model of myocardial infarction ( mi ) and demonstrate feasibility in patients .
methods a canine model with variable coronary occlusion times was employed to create a range of mi size / transmurality .
following cmr , hearts were stained with ttc to provide a histopathology reference standard .
the main components of fiddle are ( 1 ) a prep pulse that differentially saturates tissue compared with blood ( eg. mt - prep ) ; ( 2 ) phase - sensitive ir ; and ( 3 ) inversion time selection under condition : blood mz < tissue mz. cmr was performed acutely or chronically at 3t .
fiddle and delayed - enhancement cmr ( de - cmr ) were acquired using matched settings ( slice thickness , 7 mm ; inplane resolution , 1.2 x 1.0 mm ; etc ) ~ 15 minutes after contrast ( 0.2 mmol / kg ) .
we enrolled patients with enyzmatically confirmed mi and identifiable infarct - related - artery by x - ray angiography , as well as controls with framingham risk score = 0 .
the patient cmr protocol was similar to that in canines .
fiddle & de - cmr analysis were performed separately and masked to identity and pathology ( canines ) or angiography results ( patients ) .
results in all canines ( n = 22 ) and patients ( mi : n = 20 , controls : n = 11 ) , black - blood images were successfully acquired using fiddle ( fig 1a ) .
slow - flow artifacts were not observed on short / long - axis images .
table 1 shows the performance of fiddle compared to de - cmr for the diagnosis of mi in canines ( on a slice basis ) .
fiddle provided improved sensitivity and accuracy for the detection of mi , particularly in the setting of small , subendocardial infarcts .
an example of subendocardial mi detected by fiddle but missed by de - cmr is shown in fig 1b with pathology reference .
the diagnostic performance of fiddle was similar in acute and chronic mi. patient findings were similar in that fiddle provided higher accuracy in detecting mi ( 100 % vs 84 % for de - mri , p = 0.03 , on a patient basis ) .
figure 1 table 1 diagnostic performance in canines sensitivity specificity accuracy overall fiddle 97 % ( 95 / 98 ) 92 % ( 35 / 38 ) 96 % ( 130 / 136 ) de - cmr 81 % ( 79 / 98 ) 95 % ( 36 / 38 ) 85 % ( 115 / 136 ) p - value < 0.001 0.65 0.001 subendocardial mi ( transmurality < 25 %) fiddle 98 % ( 44 / 45 ) 92 % ( 35 / 38 ) 95 % ( 79 / 83 ) de - cmr 71 % ( 32 / 45 ) 95 % ( 36 / 38 ) 82 % ( 68 / 83 ) p - value < 0.001 0.65 0.008 conclusions we demonstrate that fiddle is more sensitive and accurate than standard de - cmr for the diagnosis of mi. although validation and feasibility is demonstrated for diagnosis of mi , the technique is easily transferable beyond cardiac imaging and additional applications are expected in other settings ( such as vascular wall imaging ) where there is need to distinguish abnormal tissue enhancement from blood - pool .

keywords malaria plasmodium falciparum blood - stage vaccine in vitro assays challenge models clinical trial national institute of allergy and infectious diseases10.13039 / 100000060the intramural program of the national institutes there have been significant decreases in malaria mortality and morbidity in the last 10 - 15 years , and who estimated a 47 % reduction in mortality between 2000 and 2013 [ 1 ] .
many malaria control measures , such as insecticide - treated bed nets ( itns ) , indoor residual spraying ( irs ) , and treatment with artemisinin - based combination therapy ( act ) , have contributed to this great achievement .
in africa , where the most virulent human malaria parasites , plasmodium falciparum , still killed ~ 530,000 people ( mainly children under 5 years old ) in 2013 , it is estimated that scale - up usage of itns made the biggest contribution to the reduction ( 68 %) , followed by act ( 19 %) and irs ( 13 %) [ 2 ] .
however , the emergence of mosquitoes and parasites resistant to existing control strategies has increased apprehension about future directions [ 2,3 ] .
in july 2015 , the most advanced malaria vaccine , rts,s made by glaxosmithkline ( gsk ) , received a positive opinion from european regulators for the first time [ 4 ] .
the rts,s vaccine is a pre - erythrocytic stage vaccine which is designed to prevent malaria infection and contains part of the circumsporozoite protein ( csp ) .
the 3 - year phase iii efficacy study , which involved 8922 children ( 5 - 17 months old at enrollment ) and 6537 infants ( 6 - 12 weeks ) , has shown 36.3 % ( 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 31.8 - 40.5 %) vaccine efficacy in children against clinical malaria and 25.9 % ( 95 % ci : 19.9 - 31.5 %) in infants [ 5 ] .
this major milestone in malaria vaccine development history has proved that an efficacious malaria vaccine is achievable .
however , a more efficacious second - generation vaccine is needed and the duration of efficacy of the current rts,s vaccine is concerning [ 6 ] .
the feasibility of blood - stage vaccines has been supported by many epidemiological studies ; people living in malaria endemic areas can acquire immunity against severe malaria initially , then clinical malaria [ 7 ] .
two passive igg transfer studies in humans directly established that the immunity is at least in part mediated by antibodies .
in the first passive transfer study conducted in the gambia , children with acute malaria received purified iggs from gambian malaria - immune adults [ 8 ] .
the parasite density dropped significantly from 10,000 - 230,000 parasites / mul to zero in 8 out of 12 children ( the maximum of 80 / mul in one child ) by day 9 , while transfusion of non - igg fraction of the sera or igg from malaria naive uk people had no effect .
in the second study , igg from african adults was inoculated to thai patients with 4200 - 9000 parasites / mul [ 9 ] .
the parasitemia went down to 8 - 90 parasites / mul between 33 and 113 h after the initial inoculation .
the thai study has shown that igg from a different geographical location has the capacity to kill parasites in vivo .
the mechanism of parasite killing by the antibodies has not yet been resolved , but if a blood - stage vaccine can elicit such effective antibodies in humans , the vaccine is likely to prevent clinical malaria .
the malaria vaccine technology roadmap updated in november 2013 targets two strategic goals by 2030 [ 10 ] : ( 1 ) vaccines with > 75 % efficacy against clinical malaria and ( 2 ) vaccines that reduce transmission of the parasite and thereby substantially reduce malaria infection .
a new blood - stage vaccine or a combination of vaccines against the blood - stage and pre - erythrocytic stages of malaria is needed to achieve the 75 % goal .
if the vaccine has a strong enough efficacy , it can also reduce transmission by significantly lessening the gametocyte numbers in humans .
the first part of this review summarizes the pros and cons of various assays and models which have been and will be used to predict efficacy of blood - stage vaccines .
in the second part , blood - stage vaccine candidates which showed some efficacy in human clinical trials or controlled human malaria infection ( chmi ) models are discussed .
then other candidates under clinical investigation are described in the third part , and novel candidates and strategies , which are not mentioned in the first three , are reviewed in the last part .
this manuscript does not cover vaccines against pregnancy malaria or plasmodium vivax vaccines since they are discussed elsewhere [ 11,12 ] .
how to evaluate vaccine candidates it is well acknowledged that developing a successful vaccine takes a long time and a great deal of money .
in case of rts,s , gsk initiated the development of this vaccine in the late 1980s , and gsk and the bill and melinda gates foundation have invested approximately $ 610 million to date [ 13 ] .
therefore , it is very important to establish a surrogate assay ( s ) and / or model ( s ) , by which we can down - select or terminate an unsuccessful vaccine as soon as possible. by doing that we can focus on more promising novel vaccines .
however , since none of the blood - stage vaccines have shown a strong efficacy in the field ( i.e. either in phase ii or iii clinical trials ) , no assay / model can be established as a surrogate .
many assays and models have been utilized during the rts,s preclinical and clinical studies , but recent data indicate that anti - circumsporozoite antibody titers are the best surrogate of protection based on the phase iii study results [ 6 ] .
at this moment , only a phase ii trial is the best ' surrogate ' assay for testing the efficacy of blood - stage vaccines , but we cannot reach a phase ii trial without evaluating the vaccine candidates by some assays / models .
therefore , the following sections discuss pros and cons of each assay which has been ( or will be ) used for blood - stage vaccine development .
enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) , western blot , and immunofluorescence assay ( ifa ) as described before , two human passive transfer studies clearly showed that antibodies are the principal contributors to anti - blood - stage parasite immunity in the field ( either directly , in combination with other cells , or both ) .
therefore , many longitudinal ( prospective ) immuno - epidemiology studies have been conducted to find novel vaccine candidates or to add rational support for further development of existing candidates .
total igg responses , igg subclasses , and avidity of antibodies ( e.g. using ammonium thiocyanate ) were also assessed in many studies .
elisa is easy to perform in many laboratories and relatively easy to standardize compared to other biological assays which are described later .
previously only one or a few proteins were examined in a study , but protein microarrays ( which can test more than 1000 proteins simultaneously ) began to be applied to longitudinal studies [ 14 ] .
in preclinical and clinical trials , elisa is almost always performed to determine the immunogenicity of the test vaccines .
however , there are several issues that need to be considered .
first of all , the elisa results depend on the quality of the recombinant proteins ( or extracted proteins from parasites ) used for elisa .
indeed , there were two phase i trials conducted with pfcp2.9 , which is a recombinant fusion protein of merozoite surface protein 1 ( msp1 ) and apical membrane antigen 1 ( ama1 ) .
the vaccine did induce antibody responses in vaccinees measured by elisa with the vaccine protein , but the antibodies did not recognize parasites by ifa in one study [ 15 ] and did not show any activity in a biological assay , the growth inhibition assay ( gia ) [ 15,16 ] ; in contrast , many human trials have shown msp1 - and ama1 - based vaccines can induce functional antibodies as judged by gia .
in this sense , ifa or western blot using native proteins are better than elisa with recombinant proteins , but it is not assured that ifa / western positive antibodies can recognize antigen expressed in live parasites , and ifa and western blot assays are not as quantitative as elisa .
the correlations between immune responses measured by elisa and clinical protection measured in longitudinal studies vary significantly depending on the study sites [ 17 ] .
the differences could be caused by many factors : protein used for elisa , elisa methodology , endemicity , and parasite strains in the particular field site .
similarly the correlations between gia results and clinical protection are controversial [ 18 ] .
therefore , unless an assay has been performed by multiple investigators in multiple field sites , it is questionable whether we can generalize the findings from one longitudinal study .
another point that must be considered to interpret the data from cohort studies is correlation and causality .
when an igg response ( or combination of responses measured by any assay ) significantly associates with a reduction of clinical malaria risk in a longitudinal study , the data cannot prove causality , only correlation .
for example , several studies have shown breadth of responses and combination of iggs responses are associated with the risk of clinical malaria [ 19,20 ] .
the breadth and combination of responses might be a better indicator of malaria exposure ( therefore such people may have higher titers against ' protective ' antigens ) ; it does not necessarily mean such antibodies cause this protection .
there is no argument that longitudinal studies are extremely valuable to search for a novel potential candidate and a novel functional assay , which could eventually be a surrogate of vaccine - induced clinical protection .
however , because of those limitations , i only discuss results from epidemiological studies in the following sections when it is critical .
gia / iia the gia or invasion inhibition assay ( iia ) is one of the most widely used functional assays in blood - stage vaccine development .
in general , parasites are co - cultured with either control or test antibodies , and % inhibition in parasite numbers ( parasitemia ) after the incubation is calculated .
when parasitemia is measured just after merozoite invasion ( usually within 20 h of invasion ) , the assay is called iia , while when parasitemia is evaluated at a later time point ( 40 - 72 h after starting the culture ) , it is designated as gia .
if the mechanism of action of test antibody is only to prevent invasion of merozoites into uninfected erythrocytes , iia and gia should give the same % inhibition results .
on the other hand , gia can also measure the inhibitory effect on intraerythrocytic parasite development , and such a phenomenon was reported in the case of anti - msp1 antibody [ 21 ] .
while inhibitions in invasion , in growth , or both represent differences in parasite biology , in vaccine development as an actual ' iia ' is often called ' gia ' in many publications .
in addition , antibodies which are known to block only parasite invasion are tested by gia , instead of iia .
therefore , for simplicity , i will use the terminology of ' gia ' in the following manuscript .
there are many minor variations in gia .
for example , researchers usually use infected erythrocytes with late trophozoite or schizont stage parasites to initiate the assay , but purified merozoites are also used in some studies ; determination of the final parasitemia may be done microscopically , by a flow cytometer , or by a parasite - specific enzymatic activity ; parasites may be incubated with antibody less than one cycle ( 20 - 40 h ) or two cycles (~ 72 h ) .
a study reported that the final results could differ slightly depending on the methods and types of test antibodies [ 22 ] .
gia has been routinely performed in many different laboratories in the world , and it is easy to use different strains of parasites to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms in the target antigens .
therefore , these assays have been utilized not only in many animal immunization studies but also in many phase ia trials , such as ama1 [ 23 - 25 ] , msp1 [ 26 ] , and erythrocyte binding antigen ( eba ) - 175 [ 27 ] .
the important point is that the vaccines developed by different investigators and tested in different platforms can induce gia - positive antibodies when the human antibodies were tested at the same or lower concentrations than those seen in their blood .
despite the wide usage of gia , there are two key questions remaining for gia in vaccine development ; one is whether gia is suitable for trials in malaria - exposed populations .
the second , more serious question is whether gia is a useful assay to predict efficacy in the field .
in terms of the first question , it is reported that gia results could change depending on the population immunized .
one example was that ama1 - c1 ( a mixture of ama1 - fvo and ama1 - 3d7 recombinant proteins ) adsorbed on alhydrogel could induce gia - positive antibodies in us adults [ 23 ] , but not in malian adults [ 28 ] , while elevations of anti - ama1 antibody titers measured by elisa were observed in both populations .
another example was fmp2.1 ( ama1 - 3d7 protein ) formulated with as02a adjuvant .
similar to the ama1 - c1 / alhydrogel vaccine , the fmp2.1 / as02a vaccine increased anti - ama1 titers regardless of vaccinees , but increases in gia activity were only observed in malaria - naive adults [ 24 ] , but not in malaria - immune adults [ 29 ] .
another phase ib study revealed that the ama1 - c1 / alhydrogel vaccine could increase % inhibition in gia in malian children , but only in those who had no gia activity before immunization ( like a malaria - naive population ) [ 30 ] .
in addition , children with higher anti - ama1 titers at baseline have more ' interfering ' antibodies , which could block gia activity of affinity - purified human anti - ama1 antibodies [ 31 ] , and such ' interfering ' antibodies were also observed in malian adults [ 32 ] .
the ' interfering ' antibodies were malaria - specific iggs , but the target antigen ( s ) has not been identified .
further investigation is required to determine whether the ' interfering ' antibodies actually diminish the vaccine efficacy in the field , or are just an artificial observation with in vitro gia .
in either case , interpretation of gia results from vaccine trials in malaria - experienced individuals is complicated .
the second question for gia is more important .
as discussed above , ultimate proof or disproof cannot be done until a blood - stage vaccine shows a measurable efficacy in a phase ii ( or iii ) trial .
however , many vaccine formulations , which can induce measurable gia - active antibodies in humans , have not shown significant efficacy in either phase ii trials or chmi models .
in one chmi study , there was a significant inverse correlation between parasite multiplication rate ( pmr ; fold - increase of parasitemia per 48 - h cycle ) and gia activity in ama1 vaccinees ( p = 0.02 , n = 6 ) [ 33 ] .
however , the significant correlation disappeared when two control volunteers were included in the analysis ( p = 0.15 , n = 8 ) .
one possible explanation is that gia is not a surrogate assay , and the other is that the levels of gia activity reached in human vaccinees were too low to show any efficacy .
the latter possibility is partially supported by monkey challenge studies .
when aotus monkeys were immunized with ama1 - based vaccines and then challenged with p. falciparum parasites , all monkeys who were protected against the challenge showed > 70 % inhibition in gia before parasite challenge [ 34 ] .
another aotus monkey challenge study with a msp1 - based vaccine showed that all protected monkeys had > 80 % inhibition in gia [ 35 ] .
since the gia conditions in those two studies were different , it is difficult to compare the % inhibition values directly , but both studies suggested that higher gia activities might be required to show protection at least in the monkey challenge models .
if it is also true in humans , a much stronger vaccine formulation needs to be developed .
recently , boyle et al published that some ( but not all ) iggs from kenyan and papua new guinea sera showed higher invasion inhibition in the presence of complement [ 36 ] .
on the other hand , when malian adults iggs ( n = 19 ) were tested with or without complement , none of the iggs showed different % inhibition ( unpublished data ) .
the difference might be explained by the methods utilized ; boyle 's iia was done with purified merozoites , and our gia with infected erythrocytes .
the same group previously published that purified merozoite iia showed higher % inhibitions compared to the regular infected erythrocyte iia when the same anti - ama1 mabs were tested [ 37 ] .
in any case , the effect of complement in gia / iia needs to be investigated further .
adci antibody - dependent cellular inhibition ( adci ) assay is an assay to determine parasite - killing effects of soluble factors ( including tnf - alpha ) released from human monocytes which are activated by a test antibody [ 38 ] .
the african adults' igg used in the second passive transfer study showed a positive response in adci , but not in gia [ 39 ] .
therefore , adci is considered as one of the potential surrogate assays .
since test antibodies may directly block the parasite invasion or growth ( which can be measured by gia ) and monocytes may release killing factors without antibody stimulation , adci results are usually expressed as a specific growth inhibition ( sgi ) index , which is intended to exclude the inhibitory effect of monocyte alone and antibody alone .
msp2 [ 40 ] , msp3 [ 41 ] , and glutamate - rich protein ( glurp ) [ 42 ] vaccines induced adci - active antibodies in humans , and affinity purified human anti - serine repeat antigen 5 ( sera - 5 ) antibodies showed positive adci [ 43 ] .
interestingly , all of those antigens have not been reported to induce gia - active antibodies .
while adci assay is potentially a valuable assay for vaccine development , this assay is not easy to perform and it has been very difficult for many laboratories to execute this assay .
the barrier in implementing adci assay could be partially explained by the heterogeneity of the human monocytes used .
depending on the subset of monocytes characterized by a series of surface markers , such as cd16 , cd14 , and ccr2 , adci activities vary significantly [ 44 ] .
even when monocytes were collected from the same individual from different days , the sgi changed from 12.2 % to 56.5 % [ 45 ] .
while there is a report attempting increase in the throughput of assay [ 46 ] , so far adci with a monocyte cell line has not been successful despite efforts in many laboratories .
to utilize this assay more widely , further definition and optimization are required .
phagocytosis / opsonization assay opsonization and phagocytosis assays have not been widely utilized for antibody samples from clinical trials as yet , but several immuno - epidemiology studies have shown a correlation between phagocytosis activities and reduction in clinical malaria [ 47,48 ] .
the phagocytosis assays loosely fall into four categories based on the parasites and phagocytic cells : whether the assay is performed with purified merozoites [ 47,48 ] or with infected erythrocytes [ 49,50 ] and whether thp - 1 human monocyte cell line [ 47,49,50 ] or primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells [ 48,51 ] are used .
the expression pattern of the target antigen determines the parasite source ( either merozoites or infected erythrocytes ) for a phagocytosis assay .
the assay with thp - 1 cells is considered to provide more reproducible results .
however , the assay cannot cover the diversity of mononuclear cells in individuals and thp - 1 cells do not express fcgammariii receptors [ 52 ] .
since it takes only 30 - 120 s for merozoites from egress to invasion [ 53 ] and merozoites lose their infectivity very rapidly at 37degreesc [ 54 ] , whether phagocytosis of infectious live merozoites mediated by vaccine - induced anti - merozoite antibodies has a significant impact in vivo is debatable .
on the other hand , parasite - derived antigens expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes are exposed to human effector mechanisms for a much longer time .
however , such antigens which are exposed to the human immune system are known to be highly variable and are called variant surface antigens ( vsas ) .
therefore , developing a cross - reactive vsa - based vaccine is extremely challenging [ 55 ] .
even in recent animal immunization studies , vsa - based ( more specifically p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 , pfemp1 - based ) vaccines only showed cross - reactivity to similar types of pfemp1 , but not for other types of pfemp1 [ 56 - 58 ] .
therefore , it has been suggested that a combination of pfemp1 antigen ( s ) and non - pfemp1 antigen ( s ) is likely to be required to develop an effective vaccine [ 59 ] , except in the case of var2csa - based vaccines against pregnancy malaria ( which are not covered in this review ) .
other antibody - based assays since eba - 175 region ii is a binding region of the eba - 175 molecule to the erythrocyte , the blocking activity of human antibodies induced by a eba - 175 region ii vaccine was tested using recombinant protein and erythrocytes , in addition to the regular gia in a phase i trial [ 27 ] .
when other ebas and reticulocyte binding - like homologue ( rh ) antigens reach to the clinical development stage , the erythrocyte binding assay might be used more frequently in human trials .
however , whether the binding assay provides any additional information beyond that obtained from gia , in terms of predicting vaccine efficacy , needs to be explored .
in case of adci assay , monocytes are utilized as the effector cells .
on the other hand , the antibody - dependent respiratory burst assay utilizes polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( pmn ) , and production of reactive oxygen species by the pmn is measured , rather than parasite killing [ 60 ] .
the assay has not been utilized for any human trials , and similar to the adci , significant donor - to - donor variations of pmn sources are reported [ 61 ] .
in case of anti - pfemp1 antibodies , three more antibody - based assays have been utilized in animal immunization studies : an agglutination assay ( i.e. whether a vaccine - induced antibody blocks agglutination of infected erythrocytes ) [ 62 ] , a rosette disruption ( inhibition ) assay [ 49,58 ] , and a binding ( or adhesion ) inhibition assay [ 56,63 - 65 ] .
extensive studies have sought to identify the specific receptor ( s ) of each pfemp1 antigen ( domain ) [ 59 ] ; for example , a domain cassette 4 - type of pfemp1 mediates binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( icam - 1 ) , and a var2csa - type to chondroitin sulfate a ( csa ) .
therefore , in pfemp1 - based vaccine development , if a target molecule is known to mediate agglutination , rosetting , and / or binding either to a specific receptor ( e.g. icam - 1 , csa ) or a specific cell type ( e.g. endothelial cells ) , an inhibition assay using a vaccine - induced antibody can be applicable .
however , since there is no common receptor or a common phenotype ( agglutination or rosetting ) for all pfemp1 molecules , the assay should be tailored for each pfemp1 - based vaccine .
furthermore , a conserved epitope ( s ) , which covers all diversity in pfemp1 molecules , has not been identified .
those assays have been beneficial to understand the natural immunity in the field .
however , considering the diversity of pfemp1 , it is arguable whether the assays are useful for development of a blood - stage vaccine that can actually reduce clinical malaria ( or a specific type of clinical malaria , e.g. severe malaria ) in the field .
since no pfemp1 - based vaccine ( other than those based on var2csa for placental malaria ) has reached ( or soon will reach ) clinical development , it will take longer to evaluate the importance of those assays for vaccine development .
t cell - based assays vaccine - induced t cell responses have been measured in multiple phase i trials with many different target antigens .
the t cell - based assays include a proliferation assay ( measuring proliferation of t cells against ex vivo immunogen stimulation ) and measurements of immunogen - induced cytokine / chemokine ( ifn - gamma , il - 2 , tnf - alpha , etc. ) production by various methods ( e.g. elispot , intracellular cytokine staining , and elisa ) [ 66 - 70 ] .
the accumulated data clearly show that blood - stage vaccines can induce t cell responses in humans .
however , there is no strong evidence in humans that such t cell immunities induced by the blood - stage vaccinations work as an independent effector mechanism of protection ( i.e. t cells by themselves or cytokine / chemokine released from the t cells directly kill blood - stage malaria ) rather than to support antibody production and maintenance .
if there is no independent mechanism , it is natural to assume that an antibody - based assay has a higher likelihood to be a surrogate than a t cell - based assay .
in one human immunization study , four volunteers were inoculated with a low dose of p. falciparum - infected erythrocytes and drug cured three times , then challenged again with the same p. falciparum - infected erythrocytes [ 71 ] .
since the investigators did not find anti - malarial antibodies in the volunteers , the results from this immunization study suggested that t cell immunity worked independently .
however , a later study revealed that the level of residual drug was unexpectedly high at the time of the last parasite challenge [ 72 ] .
the results from the latter study made the interpretation of results from the former study difficult .
monkey challenge model the monkey p. falciparum challenge model has been a useful tool to evaluate many different vaccine formulations and also has been used to find novel candidates [ 34,73 - 77 ] .
many monkey studies were conducted with freund 's adjuvant to induce maximum immune responses , but freund 's adjuvant cannot be injected into humans because of its toxicity .
to make this model more valuable , several studies were conducted with human - applicable adjuvants or vaccine formulations , and showed protective effects in some studies [ 34,75,77 ] .
monkey challenge studies can be done with non - gmp grade vaccines , and in contrast to the human challenge model ( described next ) , investigators can follow the animals for a longer time until the monkeys develop high parasitemia or anemia .
therefore , the monkey challenge model might be a better model to evaluate the immunity against clinical disease , more than anti - infection immunity .
for the negative side , because of the restriction in animal numbers which can be used for vaccine development and growing ethical concerns for using non - human primates , it has been becoming difficult to perform the monkey challenge studies in many countries .
another limitation is that since aotus or saimiri monkeys are not natural hosts of p. falciparum parasites , only a handful of strains ( e.g. fvo , fch / 4 , fup - sp ) which are adapted to the monkeys can be used for the challenge .
extensive discussions of the monkey challenge model have been published elsewhere [ 78,79 ] .
controlled human malaria infection the sporozoite challenge model has been broadly used for pre - erythrocytic vaccines .
since a pre - erythrocytic vaccine is designed to kill parasites before merozoite - stage parasites enter the blood stream , the sporozoite challenge model is an excellent model to evaluate efficacy .
the same model has been applied to the combination of blood - stage and pre - erythrocytic stage vaccines [ 80 - 84 ] , and also for pure blood - stage vaccines [ 68,85 ] .
other blood - stage vaccine trials involved blood - stage parasite challenges , instead of sporozoite challenges [ 33,86 ] .
several reviews have already described the difference between sporozoite challenge and blood - stage challenge [ 87 - 89 ] , and the blood - stage challenge is considered to be a more suitable model for blood - stage vaccines .
in both challenge models , participants need to be treated when the level of parasitemia becomes microscopically detectable ( or earlier if a volunteer shows any symptoms ) .
therefore , in addition to the time to detectable parasitemia by smear , pmr ( or parasite growth rate ) are calculated in many trials to evaluate the vaccine effect more comprehensively [ 33,68,83,86 ] .
there was a significant difference in median pmr between gambian ( 2.4 - fold / 48 h ) and uk ( 8.0 - fold / 48 h ) adults , which indicates that if a vaccine can induce immunity such as seen in african adults , it may show significant reduction in pmr .
one obvious limitation of this model is that the test vaccine needs to be safe and clear all regulatory and ethical standards before performing the challenge study , that is , we cannot use the model in preclinical trials .
another drawback was that only nf54 or 3d7 strains of parasites have been sufficiently standardized for inoculation into humans .
to overcome this limitation , several groups have been working to expand the diversity of parasite challenges [ 90,91 ] .
to date the human challenge model is considered to be the closest to a phase ii trial , but several questions need to be resolved in the future : ( 1 ) whether we should make a go or no - go decision for a phase ii trial based on the chmi results and ( 2 ) how much reduction in pmr is required to show efficacy in the field .
humanized mouse model since only limited laboratories can perform monkey or human challenge studies , and both of them are very expensive , testing the efficacy of blood - stage vaccines in a humanized mouse is one of the attractive alternatives if applicable .
while significant progress has been made in the last 5 - 10 years [ 92 ] , still a majority of the humanized mouse models require daily injection of human erythrocytes [ 93 ] .
a study with a new humanized model where the mice were infused with human hematopoietic stem cells , instead of mature human erythrocytes , has been published [ 94 ] .
while the mice could maintain human erythrocytes in their peripheral blood up to 4 months without daily injection , the level of human erythrocytes was < 1 % of total rbc ( i.e. > 99 % of rbc were mouse erythrocytes ) and the parasitemia in the total blood was only 3 - 5 parasites / mul .
since the humanized mice are basically immunodeficient mice , the mouse model could be used only for passive transfer experiments until recently .
huang et al. have reported very recently that they successfully reconstituted human cd4 + t and b cell responses in transgenic mice , in which a pf - csp vaccine could elicit protective immunity against a challenge with chimeric sporozoites ( rodent parasites expressing pf - csp ) [ 95 ] .
however , further improvements are required to completely reproduce immune responses to a vaccine in humans .
as more improvements in the humanized mouse model occur , this model will be used more broadly for future blood - stage vaccine development .
vaccine candidates that showed efficacy in humans in this section , blood - stage vaccines that were reported to show some efficacy in human clinical trials or chmi models are discussed , and the summary of those trials are presented in table 1 .
all of the antigens described in this section are merozoite surface antigens or antigens secreted from merozoite , and they are considered to have critical roles during merozoite attachment and / or invasion of erythrocytes .

bthere were other vaccine groups in the trial , but only one group which showed a significant effect is shown .
combination b combination b vaccine contained msp1 ( k1 allele ) , msp2 ( 3d7 allele ) , and resa ( fcq - 27 / png allele ) antigens and was formulated with montanide isa720 adjuvant in a phase ii trial with 120 children ( 5 - 9 years old ) [ 96 ] .
the 120 individuals were first divided into two groups ; children were given either sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine ( sp ) or a placebo 1 week before immunization .
in each group ( sp or non - sp ) , half of the children received the combination b vaccine and the other half got placebo vaccine ( adjuvant alone ) ; then parasite density and clinical malaria were monitored .
among the sp group , there was no effect on parasite density .
in contrast within the non - sp group , the vaccine significantly reduced parasite density ( p = 0.024 ) .
while there was a ' mathematically ' significant reduction in parasitemia in the sp group , the vaccine did not show a ' biologically ' significant effect in both groups , viz .
no efficacy against clinical malaria .
when both sp and non - sp groups were combined , children who received combination b vaccine had less chance to be infected with parasites with the 3d7 form of msp2 : 78 out of 359 ( 22 %) pcr samples collected from placebo group , and 30 out of 360 ( 8 %) from vaccine groups ( p = 0.04 ) .
the number of participants in each group was small ( n = 30 each ) .
this is the first blood - stage vaccine showing an allele - specific effect in malaria - exposed children .
while the safety and immunogenicity results of a phase i study with msp2 - c1 ( combination of 3d7 and fc27 allelic forms of msp2 ) was reported in 2011 [ 40 ] , according to the who malaria rainbow table [ 100 ] and clinicaltrials.gov [ 101 ] , no human trials with combination b vaccine or other msp2 - based or resa - based vaccines are planned in the near future .
ama1 while many phase i trials have been conducted with ama1 vaccines , only two phase ii trials have been completed so far .
one of the studies involved ama1 - 3d7 protein adjuvanted with as02a ( fmp2.1 / as02a ) and was tested in 1 - 6 year malian children [ 97 ] .
a total of 383 children were followed completely for 240 days .
similar to the phase ii trial with combination b vaccine , there was no significant impact on clinical malaria .
however , when only children who were infected with ama1 - 3d7 type parasites ( determined by cluster 1 loop of domain i sequences , the most polymorphic region in ama1 molecule ) were analyzed ( 22 episodes out of 271 episodes observed in the trial ) , there was a significant effect by the ama1 vaccine : out of the 22 clinical episodes , 16 occurred in the control group and 6 in the vaccine group ( p = 0.03 ) .
the follow - up study showed no strain - specific protection in the next year [ 102 ] .
another phase ii trial with a mixture of ama1 - 3d7 and ama1 - fvo formulated on alhydrogel in 2 - to 3 - year - old children ( 279 children were followed completely for 154 days ) showed no impact on clinical malaria [ 103 ] or strain - specific protection [ 104 ] .
in two human homologous sporozoite challenge trials , small , but significant , effects were observed in terms of cumulative parasitemia [ 68 ] or pmr [ 83 ] .
however , neither study showed significant delay in treatment time ( i.e. time to reach a level of parasitemia detected by light microscopy ) .
ama1 is a highly polymorphic protein , and the phase ii trial with fmp2.1 / as02a showed allele - specific protection .
the gia result from a phase i study indicated that a mixture of ama1 - 3d7 and ama1 - fvo is unlikely to cover the variations in the field [ 105 ] .
therefore , many investigators have been trying to overcome the polymorphic issues for future ama1 - based vaccines .
in animal immunization models , mixtures of 4 or 5 ama1 proteins [ 106 - 108 ] could induce strain - transcending antibodies as judged by gia .
a rabbit study indicated the possibility that a modification of immunization strategy may further improve the cross - reactivity ( i.e. , immunize different ama1 proteins sequentially , rather than inject the mixture of proteins every time ) [ 109 ] .
another unique approach is to generate chimeric ama1 proteins ( dico ) which could cover the majority of polymorphisms in the field by combining 3 dico proteins .
the results of a non - human primate study were promising [ 110 ] , and a phase i trial is underway ( clinicaltrial.gov identifier nct02014727 ) .
one more unique approach is to mutate major polymorphic residues to alanine , glycine , or serine [ 111 ] .
while the chimeric ama1 induced more cross - reactive antibodies judged by gia , the levels of inhibition were lower compared to the antibodies raised with non - chimeric ama1 for the same strains of parasites .
researchers also have been attempting to generate more potent ama1 - based vaccines .
ama1 and rhoptry neck protein ( ron ) 2 , 4 , and 5 form a complex during merozoite invasion [ 112 ] .
a recent animal immunization study suggests co - injection of ama1 and ron2 may improve the efficacy of responses to homologous parasites [ 113 ] .
further study is required to determine whether the enhancement occurs in humans and whether the strategy works with ama1 - mixtures or dico vaccines .
msp3 and gmz2 msp3 - based vaccines could induce protective immunity in a monkey challenge model [ 114 ] .
in addition , vaccine - induced human anti - msp3 antibodies showed adci activity in vitro and killed p. falciparum parasites injected to humanized scid mice in the presence of human monocytes [ 41,115 ] .
while the efficacy was not tested in a phase ii trial , efficacy was reported from a phase ib trial in 1 - to 2 - year - old children conducted in burkina faso [ 98 ] .
in the trial , groups of 15 children received either 15 mug of msp3 long synthetic peptide ( msp3 - lsp ) , 30 mug of msp3 - lsp , or control hepatitis b vaccine .
the incident rates of clinical malaria in the msp3 groups were significantly lower than that in control group ( 1.2 cases per 100 days for 15 mug msp3 , 1.9 for 30 mug msp3 , and 5.3 for control , p = 0.01 ) .
another vaccine , gmz2 , which contains msp3 and glurp is also under investigation [ 116 - 119 ] .
the glurp itself induced adci active antibodies in humans [ 42 ] .
according to the who malaria rainbow table [ 100 ] , both msp3 and gmz2 are the only two blood - stage candidates under phase iib evaluation ( no information in clinicaltrials.gov [ 101 ]) .
se36 se36 vaccine contains a part of sera - 5 , results from one phase ia trial [ 120 ] and from one phase ib trial in uganda [ 99 ] have been reported .
in a part of phase ib trial , 66 individuals ( 6 - 20 years old ) received se36 vaccine and were followed for clinical malaria episodes between 130 and 365 days post - second vaccination .
in addition to the 16 individuals who were enrolled from the beginning and received saline ( instead of se36 ) , the investigators newly enrolled 50 individuals before the clinical follow - up as the control group ( n = 66 total ) to increase the power of the study .
after adjustment for age and gender , the risk of parasitemia >= 5000 parasites / mul plus fever was significantly lower in the se36 group compared to the control group ( hazard ratio = 0.26 ( 95 % ci , 0.10 - 0.61 ) ; p < 0.01 ) .
while there is no plan for a phase ii trial ( according to who malaria rainbow table [ 100 ] and clinicaltrials.gov [ 101 ]) , the efficacy of se36 ought to be confirmed by a phase ii trial .
msp1 multiple monkey challenge models showed msp1 - based vaccines could induce protective immunity in monkeys [ 35,121,122 ] , and msp1 is one of the components of combination b vaccine as discussed above [ 96 ] .
only one phase ii trial with pure msp1 - based vaccine has been conducted until today .
the phase ii trial conducted with msp142 - 3d7 vaccine adjuvanted using as02 in kenyan children showed no significant effect on clinical malaria [ 123 ] .
the significant effect of a msp1 vaccine was only observed in one phase iia trial where adults were immunized with chimpanzee adenovirus 63 ( chad63 ) followed by modified vaccinia virus ankara ( mva ) [ 85 ] .
while the number of vaccinees was very small ( n = 3 in the vaccine group , and n = 6 in control ) , there was a significant delay to the time to diagnosis by microscopy ( p = 0.035 ) after sporozoite challenge .
however , when the same chad63 / mva vaccine was tested in another phase iia trial ( n = 9 for a vaccine group and n = 6 in control ) , the msp1 vaccine showed no significant effect ( p = 0.13 ) [ 85 ] .
it is likely that a stronger adjuvant and a new immunization strategy are required to make an efficacious msp1 - based vaccine .
vaccines against multistage parasite antigens nyvac - pf7 is an attenuated vaccinia virus containing genes encoding candidates from multiple stages : pre - erythrocytic ( csp , ssp , and lsa1 ) , blood - stage ( msp1 , ama1 , and sera ) , and mosquito - stage ( pfs25 ) antigens .
when the volunteers were challenged with sporozoites ( n = 35 in two doses of vaccine groups and n = 8 in the control group ) , there was a significant delay in prepatent period [ 81 ] .
pmr was not measure in the trial .
a significant effect by another multistage vaccine was also reported .
pev3a vaccine included peptides from csp ( pre - erythrocytic ) and ama1 ( blood - stage ) [ 83 ] .
while there was no significant difference in prepatent period , pmr in pev3a vaccinated group ( n = 5 , 5.7 parasites per ml per cycle ) was significantly lower than that in the control ( n = 5 , 8.7 parasites per ml per cycle ) .
however , since vaccines which contained only pre - erythrocytic antigens or blood - stage antigens were not tested in both studies , it is practically impossible to estimate how much ( or any ) protective effects were elicited by the blood - stage antigens .
other vaccine candidates under clinical development eba175 a cysteine - rich second region of eba - 175 ( eba - 175 - rii ) vaccine has been tested in a phase ia trial , and the vaccine induced gia - active antibodies .
in a recent rabbit study , antibodies against more conserved regions of eba - 175 ( regions iii - v ) showed stronger and more strain - transcending activities judged by gia [ 124 ] , while the functional activity of regions iii - v is unknown .
further investigation is required to reveal whether the region iii - v vaccine is better than the rii vaccine in humans .
since different field parasites show different protein expression levels of eba and rh proteins ( eba - 140 , eba - 175 , eba - 181 , rh1 , and rh2 were tested in the study ) [ 125 ] , all of which are involved in redundant merozoite invasion pathways , a combination with other antigen ( s ) is likely to be required to show efficacy in the field .
p27a p27a is a part of trophozoite exported protein 1 ( tex1 , previously called hypothetical protein pff0165c ) .
the tex1 antigen was found by a unique approach , that is , based on the alpha - helical coiled coil structure of the molecule [ 126 ] .
in contrast to other blood - stage candidates , tex1 is not a merozoite protein , and locates at maurer 's clefts in infected erythrocytes [ 127 ] .
human affinity - purified p27a - specific antibody and rabbit anti - p27a antibody showed adci activities [ 126,128 ] , and the first phase ia and ib trial with alhydrogel or gla - se adjuvants was completed in july 2015 ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct01949909 ) .
several other antigens tested in the structure - based screening study showed adci activities [ 126 ] , and they are also interesting candidates for further investigation .
rh5 rh5 is one of the reticulocyte binding - like homologue ( rh ) proteins , and an rh5 vaccine could induce strain - transcending antibodies in animals judged by gia [ 129 ] .
in addition , while the antibody levels in malaria - exposed individuals are low compared to other merozoite antigens [ 129,130 ] , affinity - purified human anti - rh5 iggs also showed gia activity [ 130,131 ] .
the low immunogenicity in humans may explain the reason why there are very limited polymorphisms in the molecule [ 132 ] .
in an aotus monkey study where the monkeys were immunized with the 3d7 sequence of rh5 using human - compatible vaccine formulations ( chad63 vaccination followed by either mva boost , or recombinant rh5 protein - abisco - 100 adjuvant boost ) , the vaccine induced a protective effect against heterologous fvo parasite challenge [ 133 ] .
a phase ia trial with chad63 - mva vaccines is ongoing ( clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct02181088 ) .
in addition to studies with rh5 as a stand - alone vaccine candidate , many animal immunization studies have been conducted using mixtures of vaccines including rh5 .
for example , p. falciparum rh5 interacting protein ( pfripr ) [ 134 ] and cysteine - rich protective antigen [ 135 ] , both of which make a complex with rh5 during the merozoite invasion , can induce gia - active antibodies by themselves and in combination with rh5 .
furthermore , other merozoite antigens , such as eba - 175 , rh1 , rh2 , rh4 , aarp ( apical asparagine - rich protein ) and pf38 , have also been evaluated with rh5 [ 131,134 - 137 ] , and the vaccines induced cross - reactive functional antibodies judged by gia. of interest , some combinations of iggs showed synergistic invasion inhibition in gia [ 135 - 137 ] .
at this moment , it is not clear whether such synergistic protective effects can be observed in vivo .
other vaccine candidates in addition to the candidate antigens described above , many more potential candidates have been proposed from longitudinal cohort studies [ 14,138,139 ]. p. falciparum schizont egress antigen - 1 ( pfsea - 1 ) is one of the novel candidates found from cohort studies [ 140 ] .
similar to the p27a ( tex1 ) , pfsea - 1 is not a merozoite antigen and localizes at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane , maurer 's clefts , and the inner leaflet of the erythrocyte membrane .
the anti - pfsea - 1 antibody prevents parasite egress rather than merozoite invasion .
anti - pf332 antibody is likely to work with a similar mechanism [ 141 ] , while a recent study suggested it might also block parasite growth through a different mechanism [ 142 ] .
the data from p27a , pfsea , and pf332 studies indicate that not only merozoite proteins or vsas but also antigens expressed within infected erythrocytes could be targets of blood - stage vaccines .
many other candidates , which are not described in this review , are also known to induce gia - active antibodies at least in animal immunization studies , such as msp4 [ 143 ] , eba140 [ 144 ] , ron3 [ 144 ] , gama ( glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored micronemal antigen ) [ 145 ] , ebl - 1 ( erythrocyte - binding ligand - 1 ) [ 146 ] , mspdbl1 and 2 ( merozoite surface protein duffy binding - like protein ) [ 147,148 ] , and ralp1 ( leucine zipper - like protein 1 ) [ 149 ] .
several clinical trials have already been conducted with a mixture of multiple antigens ( multiple stages ) in different platforms , for example , ama1 + msp1 [ 85,150 ] , msp1 + eba175 [ 151 ] , csp + ama1 [ 82,84,152 ] , and csp + msp2 [ 80 ] .
results from other multistage vaccines in animal immunization studies are also promising [ 153 - 155 ] .
more multistage or multi - antigen vaccines are likely to be explored in the future .
however , caution should be taken in such vaccines because antigenic competition has been observed in non - human primates and humans with ama1 + msp1 vaccines [ 74,85 ] ; that is , the mixture vaccine induced lower titers compared to the single antigen vaccine tested in the same study .
while it has not reached to the clinical trial stage , a group of researchers are investigating the possibility of using chemically attenuated blood - stage parasites as a vaccine [ 156 ] , as a promising protective effect was observed by intravenous inoculation of attenuated sporozoites in humans in the case of a pre - erythrocytic vaccine [ 157 ] .
expert commentary there are several considerations to accelerate future blood - stage vaccine development .
as mentioned above , none of the assays / models has been proven as a surrogate of protection and no blood - stage vaccines have shown strong efficacy in a large phase ii ( or iii ) trial .
therefore , novel antigen discovery should be continued with any approach available ( e.g. identify immune - correlates with clinical malaria in a longitudinal cohort study , structure / sequence - based predictions ) .
however , since resources are limited , the functional activity of antibody ( and cellular immunity if applicable ) against the novel antigen should be evaluated promptly using an assay / model with live human parasites ( or transgenic parasites expressing the human antigen ) .
if the novel antigen induces only a weaker activity than an existing candidate ( s ) , the novel candidate may have a lesser chance to be a successful vaccine , unless it can induce a synergistic effect with other candidates .
if no robust functional activity of the novel vaccine - induced antibody is detected by an in vitro assay , the investigators should consider the risk that vaccine development with the target molecule will be extremely challenging ; viz .
one needs to down - select vaccine formulations / adjuvants etc .
without a reliable decision - making tool in the preclinical development stage and phase i trials. with new candidates which can induce functional antibodies and / or protection in a challenge model , a molecule that is known to be polymorphic and / or functionally redundant should be graded lower than a molecule which is non ( or less ) - polymorphic and / or functionally nonredundant , except when there is a methodology to overcome the issue .
based on the published human trial data , the level of antigen - specific antibody which can be elicited by a vaccine in humans is expected to be somewhere between ~ 50 and several hundred mug / ml at the peak ( i.e. 2 - 4 weeks after the final immunization ) , regardless of population immunized ( malaria naive or immune , children or adults ) , antigen ( e.g. ama1 , msp1 , rts,s ) , adjuvant ( e.g. as01 , as02 , cpg ) , or vaccine platform ( e.g. recombinant protein , chad63 / mvi ) [ 26,68,70,102,105,123,150,158 - 160 ] .
without a major breakthrough in vaccinology ( e.g. a completely new strategy , a new class of adjuvant ) , one of the crucial aspects in vaccine development is to use the several hundred mug / ml of antibody efficiently .
therefore , i feel a polymorphic and / or functionally redundant molecule has a lesser chance to be a successful vaccine unless the novel candidate can induce a strong parasite killing effect at very low concentrations of antibody .
in line with this consideration , novel vaccines that only contain critical epitopes ought to be investigated further .
using functional monoclonal antibodies , chimeric antigens and other methodologies , researchers have tried to identify critical epitopes in several existing candidate molecules [ 43,106,108,161 - 163 ] .
since the highest limit of antigen - specific antibody concentration is likely to be set , that is , a few hundred mug / ml ( unless there will be a major break - through ) , it is also important to determine vaccine - induced antibody level in a mug / ml - scale , rather than ' antibody titer ' or ' antibody units ' , in a human trial. by doing that , the investigator could estimate whether there is any room to improve the immunogenicity ( e.g. change immunization schedule and / or adjuvant to reach the few hundred mug / ml level ) or consider switching to a new candidate / strategy .
one of the other important keys for the vaccine development is to increase capacity for performing phase iib ( and iia ) trials and test a promising candidate in humans as soon as possible .
many blood - stage candidates have been shown to induce functional antibodies in animals , and human affinity purified iggs also have shown functional activities judged by gia , adci assay , or other assays .
in addition , some vaccines can induce protective immunity in monkey challenge models .
however , significant efficacies of blood - stage vaccines have been observed only in small phase i or iia clinical trials ( or in small subsets of phase iib trials ) .
therefore , we should prove or disprove the vaccine efficacy in a phase iia or iib trial as quickly as possible rather than spending a great deal of time and effort in animal and preclinical studies once a promising candidate ( or a combination of candidates ) is identified .
the results from phase ii trials provide strong feedback for further vaccine development , that is , for go and no - go decisions , which assay ( s ) should be used , and what level of ( functional ) activity needs to be reached .
not only the peak immune response , the longevity of responses is likely to determine the vaccine efficacy in the field .
however , at this moment , there is no universally accepted strategy which maintains ' vaccine - induced immunity ' for a long time , and which ' vaccine - induced immunity ' should be measured as the surrogate of ' protection ' .
a further complication is that there is no consensus on the best indicator of ' protection ' in a phase iia and iib trials with a blood - stage vaccine .
in epidemiology studies , different ( or multiple ) measurements have been reported ( e.g. time to first malaria episode , risk of clinical cases per time per person ) .
the selection of the ' clinical protection ' readout ( s ) needs to be determined based on a target product profile of a vaccine , but if we aim to make ' vaccines with > 75 % efficacy against clinical malaria ( the malaria vaccine technology roadmap [ 10 ])' , the vaccine should show a significant effect in any measurements .
five - year view i expect results from ama1 - dico , gmz2 , se36 , msp3 , p27a , and rh5 clinical trials will be available in the near future , and the data will guide further blood - stage vaccine development .
several other novel candidates described above may reach phase i or iia trials in the next 5 years .
in addition , it is likely that more development efforts will be focused on multi - antigen and multistage vaccines .
not only such ' broader ' approach but also a ' deeper ' approach ( i.e. epitope specific approach ) for each target antigen is also anticipated .
for the host side , whole transcriptional analysis to identify biomarkers of protection is being applied to a pre - erythrocytic vaccine [ 164 ] .
once a blood - stage vaccine shows clear efficacy in a phase iia ( or iib ) trial , transcriptional analysis in the hosts will be explored further .
in addition , further studies with human and humanized monoclonal antibodies ( e.g. a passive transfer study with these antibodies in a chmi model ) will be conducted to explore the interaction with the parasites in the human host .
key issues no in vitro assays or challenge models have been shown to be a surrogate of protection in the field for any blood - stage vaccines .
however , gia / iia and adci assays are used as function assays in many preclinical and clinical studies .
monkey parasite challenge model has been a useful tool to evaluate blood - stage vaccines in preclinical stages .
parasite challenge model , especially blood - stage challenge , in phase iia trials is valuable and is becoming more widely used .
only combination b , ama1 , msp3 , and se36 vaccines were reported to show detectable levels of efficacy against either total or allele - specific parasites in humans .
however , the size of the clinical trials ( or subsets of the population analyzed in the clinical trials ) was less than 70 per arm .
a larger trial is necessary to confirm these findings .
many potential novel candidates have been identified in the last 5 - 10 years , and several novel vaccines ( p27a , rh5 , etc. ) are under clinical investigation .
multi - allele , multi - antigen , and / or multistage vaccines need to be investigated further .

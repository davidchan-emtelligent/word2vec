background annually in the us , there are over 300,000 hospital admissions due to hip fractures in geriatric patients .
consequently , there have been several large observational studies , which continue to provide new insights into differences in outcomes among hip fracture patients .
however , few hip fracture studies have specifically examined the relationship between hip fracture patterns , sex , and short - term outcomes including hospital length of stay and discharge disposition in geriatric trauma patients .
methods we performed a retrospective study of hip fractures in geriatric trauma patients .
hip fracture patterns were based on icd - 9 cm diagnostic codes for hip fractures ( 820.00 - 820.9 ) .
patient variables were patient demographics , mechanism of injury , injury severity score , hospital and icu length of stay , co - morbidities , injury location , discharge disposition , and in - patient mortality .
results a total of 325 patient records met the inclusion criteria .
the mean age of the patients was 82.2 years , and the majority of the patients were white ( 94 %) and female ( 70 %) .
hip fractures patterns were categorized as two fracture classes and three fracture types .
we observed a difference in the proportion of males to females within each fracture class ( femoral neck fractures z - score = - 8.86 , p < 0.001 , trochanteric fractures z - score = - 5.63 , p < 0.001 ) .
hip fractures were fixed based on fracture pattern and patient characteristics .
hip fracture class or fracture type did not predict short - term outcomes such as in - hospital or icu length of stay , death , or patient discharge disposition .
the majority of patients ( 73 %) were injured at home .
however , 84 % of the patients were discharged to skilled nursing facility , rehabilitation , or long - term care while only 16 % were discharged home .
there was no evidence of significant association between fracture pattern , injury severity score , diabetes mellitus , hypertension or dementia .
conclusions hip fracture patterns differ between geriatric male and female trauma patients .
however , there was no significant association between fracture patterns and short - term patient outcomes .
further studies are planned to investigate the effect of fracture pattern and long - term outcomes including 90 - day mortality , return to previous levels of activity , and other quality of life measures .
keywords femoral neck fractures hip fractures length of stay hip fracture patterns geriatric g - 60 issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2014 introduction geriatric trauma in the us is on the rise and at our level - i trauma center we have seen a dramatic increase in our " g - 60 " geriatric trauma mechanism of injury .
there has also been a shift from motor vehicle collision to falls as the new number one mechanism of injury in geriatric trauma .
annually in the us , there are over 300,000 hospital admissions due to hip fractures in geriatric patients .
[ 1 ] patients who sustain hip fractures are exposed to significant morbidity [ 1 ] and high mortality [ 2 ] at a treatment cost between 10.3 to 15.2 billion dollars per year in the us [ 3 , 4 ] .
these observations illustrate that hip fractures , especially in the elderly , represent significant health and economic challenges in need of focused attention .
thus , trauma centers across the country are trying to develop ways to improve the quality of care given to elderly trauma patients , which includes a better understanding of hip fracture patterns .
the national hip fracture database ( nhfd ) the largest uk - based national hip fracture audit with 180 contributing hospitals in england , wales and northern ireland has reported differences in outcomes among patients with hip fractures [ 5 ] .
similar large observational studies from the us [ 6 ] have recently been published which underscore the importance of anesthesia technique on mortality and length of stay among patients who underwent surgery for hip fractures .
the term " hip fracture " most commonly refers to fractures of the proximal femur and are generally categorized as ( a ) femoral neck fractures and ( b ) trochanteric fractures including intertrochanteric fractures , greater trochanteric fractures and subtrochanteric fractures , and combined inter - and subtrochanteric fractures .
most epidemiologic studies consider only 2 categories , femoral neck and intertrochanteric .
although there are reports showing some decline in the incidence of femur fractures among patients who stopped smoking and drinking alcohol or have been treated for osteoporosis with vitamin d [ 7 - 9 ] , mortality and morbidity due to hip fracture remains rather high [ 7 , 9 , 10 ] .
thus , models have been developed to predict hip fracture mortality [ 11 , 12 ] .
however , it remains unclear whether there is a difference in femur fracture pattern distribution ( femoral neck vs. trochanteric ) in geriatric trauma patients .
it is also unknown if there is any association between geriatric g60 trauma patients' fracture pattern and outcomes .
the purpose of this study was to determine if there is a difference in patient characteristics or patient outcomes as a function of fracture patterns in geriatric trauma patients age 60 years and older .
methods this retrospective study was reviewed and approved by western institutional review board .
patients were identified by query of the institutional trauma registry at our american college of surgeons ( acs ) verified level - i trauma center for all hip fractures by icd 9 cm code 820 - 820.9 .
patients with no femur fracture , those with acetabular fracture , or penetrating injuries were excluded .
the study period was from august 2012 to february 2014 .
data were collected both from the trauma registry and the electronic medical record .
data recorded included patient variables : age , gender , race / ethnicity , mechanism of injury , hospital and icu length of stay , discharge disposition and mortality .
data captured were entered into excel spreadsheets and an access database .
a trauma surgeon reviewed x - ray reports for each femur fracture , and if any ambiguity remained , a radiologist reviewed them .
all fractures were described according to fracture class : ( a ) femoral neck and ( b ) trochanteric fractures ( figure 1a ) .
these classes were further categorized into following fracture types : ( a ) femoral neck , ( b ) intertrochanteric , ( c ) subtrochanteric , ( d ) greater trochanter , and ( e ) combined inter & subtrochanteric ( figure 1b ) .
trochanteric fracture class was a combination of intertrochanteric , trochanteric , and subtrochanteric fractures .
patient outcomes variables reviewed included : ( a ) hospital length of stay ( hlos ) days , ( b ) icu days ( icu los ) , and ( c ) discharge disposition including in - patient mortality .
we examined the data for evidence of association between femur fracture type or fracture class and specific outcomes of interest .
covariates were age , gender , ethnicity / race , and injury severity score .

for purposes of statistical analysis , patients with fractures corresponding to figures ( c ) , ( d ) , and ( e ) were grouped as " other " .
however , such grouping may not represent homogenous clinical category .
statistical analysis continuous variables were reported as means +/ - sd and categorical variables as percentages .
comparisons between groups were performed using analysis of variance ( anova ) or student 's t - test for continuous variables .
pearson 's chi - square test , fisher 's exact test , or two - proportion z - test was used for categorical variables .
two - sided p - values were used and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results demographics there were 325 patients , who met all of the study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria .
the mean age ( years ) was 82.2 +/ - 9.3 with range of 60 to 101 years .
there were 70.2 % ( n = 228 ) female and 29.8 % ( n = 97 ) male patients .
falls accounted for 95 % of mechanism of injury for these patients .
females were older ( 83.3 +/ - 8.8 years ) than males ( 79.5 +/ - 9.8 years ) on average ( p = 0.001 ) .
the majority of subjects ( 94.2 % , n = 306 ) were white , and all other ethnic groups composed the remaining 5.8 % ( n = 19 ) of the patient population .
in reviewing patients' co - morbidities , 191 ( 58.8 %) patients had hypertension , 65 ( 20 %) patients had diabetes mellitus , 51 ( 16 %) patients had dementia , 49 ( 15 %) patients had respiratory disease , 20 ( 6.2 %) patients had chronic heart failure , and 20 ( 6.2 %) patients were current smokers .
we also studied the fall locations and discharge dispositions of the patients .
there were 239 patients ( 73.5 %) who fell at home , 18 patients ( 5.5 %) who fell at nursing home , and 68 patients ( 21 %) who fell at other locations .
there were 40 patients ( 12.4 %) who were discharged to home , 265 ( 81.4 %) patients who were discharged to snf , rehabilitation centers , or acute care centers , and 20 patients ( 6.2 %) who either died or were discharged to hospice .
the majority of patients fell from home , but the majority of patients were discharged to snf , rehabilitation center , or acute care facility as it is shown in table 1 .

this table represents demographic description of the patients' discharge disposition in relation to their injury locations .
there was no statistical analysis performed on this data due to low numbers in some of the sub - groups .
fracture class ( femoral neck and trochanteric fractures ) among elderly g - 60 patients among our study subjects , 51.4 % ( n = 167 ) had femoral neck fractures , and 48.6 % ( n = 158 ) had trochanteric fractures .
the mean ( sd ) age of patients with femoral neck fracture was 82.7 +/ - 8.5 years , and the average age of patients with trochanteric fractures was 82.5 +/ - 9.6 years ( p = 0.84 ) .
the difference in age was not statistically significant , ( 251df ) = - 0.149 , p = 0.881 .
patients' mean ( sd ) injury severity scores ( iss ) for femoral neck and trochanteric fractures were 9.4 +/ - 2.0 and 9.8 +/ - 3.1 , respectively ( p = 0.20 ) .
we also determined the distribution of femoral neck and trochanteric fractures among the patients based on their gender , and the proportion of males and females with trochanteric fractures and femoral neck fractures showed significantl differences as shown in figure 2 .
the hlos and icu los for each fracture class were also examined .
the patients with femoral neck fractures stayed on average ( sd ) 5.1 +/ - 2.6 days in hospital , and the patients with trochanteric femur fractures stayed on average 5.4 +/ - 2.7 days ( p = 0.341 ) .
the icu los for patients with femoral neck and trochanteric fractures were on average ( sd ) 3.7 +/ - 3.6 and 3.3 +/ - 2.2 days ( p = 0.662 ) , respectively .
the fall locations and the discharge dispositions were also studied and compared between two fracture classes , and the distribution of each fracture class was similar in various locations .

pearson 's chi - square ( 2 df ) = 1.14 , p = 0.566 for discharge disposition .
femoral fracture types in elderly g - 60 patients when the patients' fracture types were compared , there were 167 patients ( 51.4 %) with femoral neck fractures , and 129 patients ( 39.7 %) with intertrochanteric fractures .
the remaining 29 patients ( 8.9 %) had subtrochanteric , greater trochanter only , or combined inter - and subtrochanteric fractures , and were considered as " other " for the purpose of meaningful statistical analysis .
the fracture types for females , males , and both sexes were explored , and are shown in table 3 .
there were higher proportions of femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures in females compared to males .
the average age was the highest in patients with intertrochanteric fractures ( 83.1 +/ - 9.4 years ) .
the average age of patients who had femoral neck fracture was 82.1 +/ - 8.7 years , and other fracture was 78.5 +/ - 10.9 years ( p = 0.044 ) .
the hlos for each fracture type was analyzed using one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) , and the average hlos were similar across the fracture types as shown in figure 3 .
there were total of 35 icu admissions among the patient population .
some of the patients with hip fracture were admitted to icu due to following reasons including , but not limited to : patients with or on anticoagulation ( e.g. coumadin ) , significant cardiac history ( e.g. pace - makers ) , hemodynamic instability , arrhythmia , confusion , concussion , mechanical ventilation , or renal dialysis .
the average icu days for patients with femoral neck fractures were 3.7 +/ - 3.6 days ( n = 15 ) , intertrochanteric fractures were 2.8 +/ - 1.9 days ( n = 16 ) , and other fractures were 5.5 +/ - 2.4 days ( n = 4 ) .

figure 3 box plot of hlos and femur fracture patterns : femoral neck , intertrochanteric , and other .
results show variations in hospital length of stay among different types of fracture patterns .
using a one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) , there was not a significant effect of fracture patterns on hospital length of stay among the three fracture patterns ( femoral neck , intertrochanteric , and other ) .
f ( 2 , 321 ) = 0.841 , p = 0.432 .
discharge disposition we completed analysis of the effect of femur fracture class on discharge disposition as shown in table 2 .
there were no significant associations between fracture class and discharge disposition , ( 2 df ) = 1.14 , p = 0.566 .
the effect of age on fracture type we examined the relationship between patient age in deciles and femoral fracture type in males ( figure 4a ) and females ( figure 4b ) .
males had the highest number of patients with femoral neck fracture in " 90 and above " age group and the highest number of patients with intertrochanteric fractures in " 80 - 89 " age group .
on the other hand , females had the highest number of patients with both femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures in " 80 - 89 " age group .
there were significant differences between the patient age in deciles and femoral fracture type in males ( p < 0.0001 ) and females ( p = 0.023 ) .
we also performed an analysis of variance ( anova ) using patient age as continuous variables .
the result showed that hip fracture types used as categorical variables were not associated with patient age as a continuous variable , f ( 4 , 248 ) = 0.600 , p = 0.66 .

surgical treatment hip fractures were fixed by orthopedic surgeons based on standard of care .
among the 325 patients with hip fractures 25 had total hip replacement , 80 had partial hip replacement , 9 had internal fixation without reduction , 207 had open reduction with internal fixation and 2 patients had closed reduction of dislocation of the hip .
discussion the primary findings of this study described femur fracture patterns in a group of elderly trauma patients with hip fractures .
the study group was predominantly white ( 94 %) , female ( 70 %) and in their 8th decade of life .
as reported in previous studies [ 13 ] and confirmed in this study , about half ( 51.4 %) of the study subjects were diagnosed with femoral neck fractures , whereas 48.6 % had trochanteric fractures .
patients in the two fracture groups did not differ in age or injury severity scores .
the prevalence of femoral neck fractures was higher in females than in males .
similarly , the prevalence of trochanteric fractures was higher in females than in males .
the ratio of male to female in femoral neck fracture was 1:3 and the ratio of male to female in intertrochanteric fracture was 1:2 .
this is confirmatory of previous study done by brunner et al .
[ 14 ] , although gender alone was not a significant predictive factor for femoral neck or trochanteric fractures ( p = 0.097 ) .
the observed higher prevalence of femoral neck fractures in females was not explained by the older age of females .
we concluded from our observations that the higher prevalence of femoral neck fractures may be a characteristic of white geriatric females in our service area .
the key question we raised in the introduction to this study was whether there were any connections between hip fracture pattern ( class or type ) and short - term inpatient outcomes .
as reported in the results section , femoral neck or trochanter fractures classes had no effect on hlos ( p = 0.706 ) , icu - los ( p = 0 . 712 ) , or patient discharge disposition including the number of inpatient deaths ( pearson chi - square ( 2df ) = 0.313 , p = 0.855 ) .
similarly , fracture types had no effect on hlos ( p = 0.814 ) .
in regards to the classification scheme , certainly ao / ota classification provides more detail .
however , use of this scheme would produce many subgroups , which would need to be grouped as we did for the purpose of analysis .
therefore , for the purpose of this study , we classified the fracture patterns in groups consistent with icd - 9 cm codes .
this is also well described in other publications [ 7 , 15 , 16 ] as a method of categorizing the different types of hip fractures .
there are several factors that influence hlos and complications such as surgical technique and whether arthroplasty was cemented or uncemented .
the majority of hip fracture patients in our study ( 207 / 325 ) or 64 % underwent open reduction with internal fixation .
the influence of this group relative to patients who underwent total hip replacement ( 7.7 %) internal fixation without reduction ( 2.7 %) , closed reduction of dislocation of hip ( 0.6 %) on outcomes , and partial hip replacement ( 24.8 %) needs to be taken into account when interpreting outcomes .
we also suspect a higher proportion of patients with hip fractures were admitted to the icu at our level - i trauma center than would be the case in uk and europe .
study limitations this was a retrospective chart review limited to a single level - i trauma center .
conclusion our examination of fracture pattern in geriatric trauma patients showed no association between fracture patterns and outcomes including hospital length of stay , icu length of stay , and discharge disposition .
males and females did differ in fracture patterns , but these differences were not associated with different outcomes .
further studies should include greater diversity in demographics , and linkage of fracture patterns to outcomes such as pain scores , infection rate , hospital readmission and patient experience .
as elderly population continues to rise and trauma centers are seeing more elderly patients with fall and associated hip fractures , we must continue to explore ways to decrease mortality and morbidity related to hip fractures .

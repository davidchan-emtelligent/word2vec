we have previously shown [ 2 ] that the low - pass filtering in dendrites [ 3 ] leads to a frequency dependent spatial spread of the lfp .
these previous results were obtained by simulating a large population of morphologically reconstructed neurons .
the cells were placed homogeneously within a disc of radius r = 1mm ( figure 1a ) .
we defined the reach of the lfp as a radius r < r such that the cells located beyond that radius contributed no more than 5 % of the total amplitude at the center of the population .
we showed that the reach depends , among other factors , on the input correlation and the frequency .
figure 1 a. model setup , r ( reach ) and r defined in the text. b. the reach r at the soma level as a function of lfp frequency and input correlation for a population of layer 5 pyramidal neurons stimulated basally , symbols - full simulation , lines - simplified model .
the input correlation is defined as a an average fraction of synaptic currents shared by each pair of neurons .
here we employ a simplified model of the population to identify the two main effects behin the frequency dependence of the reach : 1 ) frequency dependence of the ' transition distance ' , that is , the distance beyond which a single cell can be approximated as a dipole , 2 ) frequency dependence of the mean pairwise correlation of the single neuron contributions to the lfp .
the simplified model is in agreement with the full simulation results if both effects are taken into account ( figure 1b ) , while neither of the factors alone is sufficient .

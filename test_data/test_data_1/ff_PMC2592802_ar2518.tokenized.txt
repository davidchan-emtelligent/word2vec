introduction rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease affecting peripheral joints and leading to loss of joint function .
the severity and outcome of disease are dependent on the balance between inflammatory / destructive and homeostatic or repair pathways .
increasing evidence suggests a role for bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp ) signaling in joint homeostasis and disease .
methods activation of bmp signaling in collagen - induced arthritis as a model of rheumatoid arthritis was studied by immunohistochemistry and western blot for phosphorylated smad1 / 5 at different time points .
expression of different bmp ligands and noggin , a bmp antagonist , was determined on synovium and cartilage extracts of arthritic knees , at different time points , with quantitative polymerase chain reaction .
at the protein level , bmp2 and bmp7 were studied with immunohistochemistry .
finally , the effect of anti - tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnfalpha ) treatment on the expression of bmp2 , bmp7 , and growth and differentiation factor - 5 ( gdf5 ) in synovium and cartilage of arthritic knees was investigated .
results a time - dependent activation of the bmp signaling pathway in collagen - induced arthritis was demonstrated with a dynamic and characteristic expression pattern of different bmp subfamily members in synovium and cartilage of arthritic knees .
as severity increases , the activation of bmp signaling becomes more prominent in the invasive pannus tissue .
bmp2 is present in cartilage and the hyperplastic lining layer .
bmp7 is found in the sublining zone and inflammatory infiltrate .
treatment with etanercept slowed down progression of disease , but no change in expression of gdf5 , bmp2 , and bmp7 in synovium was found ; in the cartilage , however , blocking of tnfalpha increased the expression of bmp7 .
conclusions bmp signaling is dynamically activated in collagen - induced arthritis and is partly tnfalpha - independent .
tnfalpha blocking increased the expression of bmp7 in the articular cartilage , possibly enhancing anabolic mechanisms .
different types of source and target cells are recognized .
these data further support a role for bmp signaling in arthritis .
introduction rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is a chronic and systemic autoimmune disease that affects mainly the peripheral joints .
synovitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells , synoviocyte proliferation , and accelerated angiogenesis triggers the formation of destructive pannus tissue and osteoclast activation that lead to erosion of cartilage and bone with progressive loss of joint function [ 1 ]. from a molecular point of view , the severity and prognosis of ra are dependent on the balance between inflammatory or destructive pathways and homeostatic or repair pathways [ 2,3 ] .
molecular signaling pathways , essential for tissue development and growth , such as bone morphogenetic proteins ( bmps ) , are likely to play a role in tissue homeostasis and repair [ 4 ] .
however , inappropriate or exaggerated activation of such pathways may also lead to pathology [ 5 - 8 ] .
bmps are members of the transforming growth factor - beta superfamily , a group of structurally related growth and differentiation factors .
their pleiotropic effects on different cell types steer many pre - and postnatal processes , such as cell differentiation , proliferation , adhesion , motility , and apoptosis [ 9 - 11 ] .
bmps were originally discovered as proteins that ectopically induce cartilage and bone formation in vivo [ 12 ] and are important during the embryonic development of articular joints [ 13 - 16 ] .
almost 30 bmps are described and classified into several subgroups according to their structural similarities [ 17 ] .
binding of a dimeric bmp ligand to type i and type ii bmp receptors typically activates a downstream signaling cascade involving either smad family member ( smad ) molecules or mitogen - activated protein kinases .
in the classical and most extensively studied pathway , the receptor - ligand complex will phosphorylate the intracellular receptor - smad1 and - smad5 molecules .
these will form a complex with common smad4 , which translocates to the nucleus , binds to dna , and directs the transcription of bmp target genes .
bmp signaling is regulated at different levels : by ligand diversity , by secreted extracellular bmp antagonists , by inhibitory smads , and by nuclear corepressors and coactivators [ 18,19 ] .
different bmps have been demonstrated in the synovium of ra patients [ 20 - 22 ] but their function and their target cells are not yet clear .
bmps have a chondroprotective role in different animal models of ra [ 23 ] .
in the present study , we investigated the activation of bmp signaling and expression patterns of different bmp ligands and antagonists in collagen - induced arthritis ( cia ) .
cia is a well - established mouse model of ra , which develops in susceptible mouse strains following immunization with heterologeous type ii collagen ( cii ) emulsified in complete freund 's adjuvant ( cfa ) and shares both immunological and pathological features with human ra [ 24 ] .
our data highlight the relevance of bmp signaling in the joint and provide a basis for further studies on the role of specific bmps in ra. materials and methods animal studies eight - week - old male dba / 1j mice were purchased from janvier laboratories ( le genest - saint - isle , france ) .
all experiments were approved by the ethics committee for animal research ( katholieke universiteit leuven , leuven , belgium ) .
for induction of arthritis , chicken sternal cartilage cii ( sigma - aldrich , bornem , belgium ) was dissolved at 2 mg / ml in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs )/ 0.1 m acetic acid , stirred overnight ( o / n ) at 6degreesc , and emulsified with an equal volume of cfa ( 1 mg / ml ) ( sigma - aldrich ) .
one hundred microliters of the emulsion ( 0.1 mg of cii ) was injected intradermally at the base of the tail .
at day 21 after immunization , mice received an intraperitoneal booster injection of 100 mul of cii ( 2 mg / ml ) .
at day 25 , the onset of arthritis was synchronized by an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mul of lipopolysaccharide ( 500 mug / ml in pbs ) ( sigma - aldrich ) [ 25 ] .
mice were sacrificed at different time points ( day 0 , 20 , 27 , 33 , 40 , and 47 after immunization ) for immunohistochemistry and protein and rna expression assays .
in additional experiments , mice were injected daily with 100 mul of soluble tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnfalpha ) receptor etanercept / pbs ( 250 mug / ml ) ( wyeth pharmaceuticals , louvain - la - neuve , belgium ) intraperitoneally ( or pbs alone as negative control ) from day 29 onwards .
the severity score was determined daily according to the scoring system of backlund and colleagues [ 26 ] .
mice were sacrificed at day 35 .
rna extraction , cdna synthesis , and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of synovium and cartilage samples at each time point and at the end of the tnfalpha blocking experiment , synovium and cartilage samples were dissected , separated , and used for rna extraction .
rna was isolated using a nucleospin rnaii kit ( macherey - nagel , duren , germany ) and reverse - transcribed using a revert - aid h minus first strand cdna synthesis kit ( fermentas , st. leon - rot , germany ) according to the manufacturers' instructions .
for quantitative analysis , real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) was performed in duplicate using the rotor - gene 6000 detection system ( corbett research , westburg , leusden , the netherlands ) .
gene expression of mouse bmp2 , bmp4 , bmp6 , bmp7 , growth and differentiation factor - 5 ( gdf5 ) , noggin ( nog ) , and tnfalpha were studied using assay - on - demand primer / probe sets ( applied biosystems , lennik , belgium ) .
expression was normalized to mouse housekeeping gene gapdh ( glyceraldehydes - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ) using the comparative threshold method [ 27 ] .
in kinetic experiments , data were further normalized to baseline levels .
protein extraction and western blot analysis of whole knees at each time point , three sets of three pooled knees were used for protein extraction .
whole knees were weighed and homogenized ( cat homogenizer x120 ; cat ingenieurburo m. zipperer gmbh , staufen , germany ) in 1 ml of cell extraction buffer ( biosource europe , nivelles , belgium ) supplemented with 5 % proteinase inhibitor cocktail ( sigma - aldrich ) and 1 mm pmsf ( phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) ( sigma - aldrich ) .
protein extracts were normalized to wet weight in an appropriate volume of cell extraction buffer .
samples were analyzed under reduced conditions ( 0.1 m dtt [ 1,4 - dithiothreitol ]) .
samples were boiled for 5 minutes at 95degreesc , chilled on ice , and loaded onto a 4 % to 12 % bis - tris gel ( invitrogen corporation , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
electrophoresis was carried out into a commercially available running buffer ( nupage mes sds running buffer ; invitrogen corporation ) at 130 v for 10 minutes in the beginning , followed by 25 minutes at 200 v. proteins were transferred on a prewet pvdf ( polyvinylidene difluoride ) membrane ( millipore s.a. / n.v. , brussels , belgium ) for 70 minutes at 30 v in a transfer buffer containing 0.4 m glycine , 0.5 m tris base , 0.01 m sds , and 200 ml / l methanol .
nonspecific binding sites were blocked in tris - buffered saline / 0.1 % tween ( tbst ) ( wash buffer ) with 5 % milkpowder ( blottoa ) ( santa cruz biotechnology , inc. , santa cruz , ca , usa ) for 1 hour at room temperature ( rt ) .
blots were then probed o / n at 4degreesc with polyclonal antibody against phosphorylated smad1 / 5 ( p - smad1 / 5 ) or smad5 ( cell signaling technology , inc. , danvers , ma , usa ) ( 1:1,000 in tbst / 5 % bovine serum albumin [ bsa ]) and thereafter incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) - conjugated secondary antibody ( jackson immunoresearch laboratories , inc. , west grove , pa , usa ) at a dilution of 1:5,000 in tbst / 5 % milkpowder for 1 hour at rt. for detection , a chemiluminescent substrate ( western lightning ; perkinelmer life and analytical sciences , inc. , waltham , ma , usa ) was applied on the membrane .
blots were visualized using an las - 3000 mini ccd ( charge - coupled device ) camera using an exposure time of 15 minutes .
densitometry measurements were done using digital image densitometry analysis ( imagej ; national institutes of health , bethesda , md , usa ) .
as positive controls , mouse mesenchymal progenitor c2c12 cells were stimulated with recombinant bmp2 ( 300 ng / ml for 30 minutes ) .
as negative controls , blots were incubated with secondary antibody alone ( data not shown ) .
immunohistochemistry knees and ankles were dissected , formaldehyde / pbs - fixed o / n , decalcified with decal ( 3 days at rt ) ( serva , heidelberg , germany ) or edta ( ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) ( 0.5 m in pbs , ph 7.5 ) ( 10 changes at 4degreesc ) , and embedded in paraffin .
for immunohistochemistry , paraffin sections ( 5 mum thick ) were deparaffinized with histo - clear ( national diagnostics , atlanta , ga , usa ) and methanol .
for antigen retrieval , sections were incubated 2 hours at rt in 0.1 m sodium citrate / 0.1 m citric acid .
endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubating the slides for 10 minutes in 3 % h2o2 in water ( bmp7 and p - smad1 / 5 ) or 3 % h2o2 in methanol ( bmp2 ) .
sections were washed three times in pbs / 0.1 % triton ( bmp7 and p - smad1 / 5 ) or in tbst ( wash buffer ) ( bmp2 ) and blocked 30 minutes at rt in 20 % donkey serum ( bmp7 , bmp2 ) or 20 % goat serum ( p - smad1 / 5 ) in wash buffer and were incubated o / n at 4degreesc with primary antibody at a final concentration of 10 mug / ml chicken anti - bmp7 ( pfizer inc , new york , ny , usa ) , 2 mug / ml goat anti - bmp2 ( santa cruz biotechnology , inc. ) , 1:50 dilution of rabbit anti - p - smad1 / 5 ( cell signaling technology , inc. ) or with isotype control ( chicken , goat , and rabbit igg ) ( santa cruz biotechnology , inc. ) or serum ( dako , glostrup , denmark ) at an appropriate concentration in wash buffer .
sections were then washed three times with wash buffer and incubated for 30 minutes at rt with secondary antibody .
for bmp7 immunostaining , the secondary antibody was an hrp - conjugated anti - chicken ( jackson immunoresearch europe ltd , newmarket , suffolk , uk ) diluted 1:100 .
for bmp2 immunostaining , a biotinylated donkey anti - goat at 1:400 dilution was used , followed by streptavidin anti - hrp ( lsab kit ) ( dako ) ( 30 minutes at rt ) .
for p - smad1 / 5 immunostaining , an abc kit ( vecta stain rabbit igg [ vector laboratories ltd. , peterborough , uk ]) was used for signal amplification .
liquid dab ( 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine ) substrate chromogen system ( dako ) was used as a peroxidase substrate .
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin .
adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) .
gdf5 immunohistochemistry was not performed on these samples as we found that different commercially available antibodies showed a lack of specificity .
statistical analysis where appropriate ( n > 3 ) , results were analyzed with spss 15.0 ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) with the unpaired non - parametric mann - whitney u test .
statistically significant differences were defined as p values of less than 0.05 .
results activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in collagen - induced arthritis activation of bmp signaling during the course of cia was visualized at different time points by immunohistochemistry for p - smad1 / 5 ( figure 1b,d,f,h ) .
histo - morphological scoring of adjacent h & e - stained sections was used to assess the severity of disease ( figure 1a,c,e,g,i ) .
in the initial phase of cia ( exsudate score 1 and infiltration and pannus formation score 0 ) , only a few p - smad1 / 5 - positive cells were visible , mostly in the lining layer of the synovium ( figure 1b ). with increasing severity , characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells and synovial hyperplasia ( exsudate score 1 , infiltration score 3 , and pannus formation score 1 ) , p - smad1 / 5 - positive cells became apparent in the subintimal zone of the synovium .
also , a few blood vessels and articular chondrocytes showed nuclear p - smad1 / 5 staining ( figure 1d - f ) .
eventually , in the destructive phase ( pathology exsudate score 2 , infiltration score 3 , and pannus formation score 2 ) , p - smad1 / 5 - positive cells were identified in the invading pannus tissue ( figure 1h ) .
in contrast , healthy knees showed almost no p - smad1 / 5 - positive cells ( data not shown ) and igg controls were negative ( figure 1j ) .

activation of bmp signaling in cia was further semi - quantified by western blot on pooled protein extracts from whole knees at different time points ( day 0 , 20 , 27 , 33 , 40 , and 47 of the experiment ) .
positive controls were obtained by stimulating c2c12 cells with recombinant bmp2 ( 300 ng / ml ) for 30 minutes .
mouse knee extracts ( three per time point , each pooled from three different knees ) were normalized to wet weight .
a specific 60 - kda band was found in all samples ( figure 2a ) .
negative controls showed no band of this size ( data not shown ) .
c2c12 cells stimulated with bmp2 had a higher expression of p - smad1 / 5 than unstimulated cells ( figure 2b ) .
we further studied the relative amount of phosphorylated and therefore activated smad1 / 5 as compared with total smad5 levels .
densities of p - smad1 / 5 and smad5 bands of mouse samples were quantified using digital image analysis densitometry software .
( imagej , national institutes of health , bethesda , md , usa ) normalized density of p - smad1 / 5 bands per time point was consistently upregulated ( three samples versus three samples ) from day 33 onwards as compared with baseline ( figure 2c ) .
these semi - quantitative western blot data thus corroborated our immunohistochemical results , supporting more active bmp signaling in the joint as cia progresses .

kinetics of bone morphogenetic protein ligands in collagen - induced arthritis - mrna level quantitative pcr for different bmp ligands and bmp antagonist nog in both synovium and cartilage extracts ( three sets per time point , extracts from two mice pooled per set ) showed a dynamic expression pattern with upregulation or downregulation of these molecules during the course of cia ( day 0 , 20 , 27 , 33 , and 40 ) as compared with healthy controls ( figure 3 ) .
as expected , expression of tnfalpha in the synovium gradually increased during the course of the disease process .
bmp7 was upregulated with peak expression around day 20 .
the expression levels of bmp2 , bmp4 , bmp6 , and nog were stable around day 20 and decreased gradually , in contrast to gdf5 expression , which was downregulated abruptly around day 20 .
as gene expression levels are normalized to a housekeeping gene , they are also likely to be influenced by the increased number of cells in the synovium .
in the articular cartilage , an increase in tnfalpha was visualized , though to a milder extent , but we found a striking increase in gdf5 expression , whereas the other molecules showed a more or less stable expression pattern .
at day 40 , bmp2 was very mildly upregulated in the articular cartilage .
again , due to normalization , expression levels are likely to be influenced by the decreased number of cells in the cartilage , due to chondrocyte cell death .

kinetics of bone morphogenetic protein ligands in collagen - induced arthritis - protein level the gene expression data prompted us to further study bmp2 and bmp7 protein levels in the arthritic joint .
these prototype bmps belong to different subfamilies preferentially binding to distinct type i and type ii receptor complexes .
immunohistochemical analysis of affected mouse knees revealed bmp2 expression predominantly in the hyperplastic lining layer of synovium and in the articular cartilage ( figure 4b,h ) .
bmp2 was less expressed but still present in some cells in the subintimal zone ( figure 4d,f ) .
the bmp7 staining pattern in mouse knee joint was influenced by disease severity .
mild inflammation ( figure 5a ) was associated with discrete bmp7 staining in the lining layer of synovium ( figure 5b ) and in superficial chondrocytes in the articular cartilage ( figure 5b ). with increasing severity ( figure 5c,e ) , bmp7 positivity became more pronounced in the lining layer and subintima ( figure 5d,f ) .
eventually , in the destructive phase ( figure 5g ) , bmp7 positivity appeared more and more in the subintima , away from the lining layer ( figure 5h ) .

effect of tumor necrosis factor - alpha blocking on bone morphogenetic protein expression levels in collagen - induced arthritis as bmp expression was recently reported in the human tnf transgenic mouse model , we further investigated the effect of blocking tnfalpha on expression of bmps in synovium and cartilage , using daily intraperitoneal injections of etanercept or pbs ( as control ) during clinically apparent cia ( n = 9 mice per group ) .
six - day treatment reduced severity of arthritis , as shown by the cumulative severity scores ( figure 6a ) .
at endpoint , synovium and cartilage were collected and mrna expression levels of bmp2 , bmp7 , and gdf5 were compared between the two groups .
in the synovium , expression levels of bmp2 , bmp7 , and gdf5 were not significantly changed .
in cartilage , however , etanercept treatment raised the expression levels of bmp7 significantly ( p = 0.003 ) .
bmp2 and gdf5 expression was not affected ( figure 6b ) .
immunohistochemistry confirmed the increased levels of bmp7 in the cartilage ( figure 6c ) .

discussion in the present study , we demonstrated a dynamic activation of the bmp signaling pathway , as detected by p - smads , in a mouse model of ra , cia .
the activation pattern is dependent on the stage of disease , starting , in the initial phase , at the synovial lining layer , gradually shifting toward the subintimal region and eventually , in the destructive phase , persisting in pannus tissue .
moreover , similar dynamic expression levels were shown for different bmp ligands in cia .
a more extensive study of bmp2 and bmp7 , different bmp subfamily members , revealed for both bmps a distinct and dynamic pattern .
in contrast to bmp2 , which is restricted mainly to the synovial lining layer and articular cartilage , bmp7 resembles the p - smad1 / 5 positivity pattern very closely ( figure 1 ) .
upon tnf blockade , the expression of bmp7 was increased in the articular cartilage of affected joints , whereas in the synovium the expression levels of bmp2 , bmp7 , and gdf5 were unchanged , suggesting that at least part of the regulation of bmp expression is tnf - independent .
this suggests that , although some bmps are upregulated under inflammatory conditions , other autocrine and paracrine mechanisms may be important and may sustain bmp expression during the arthritic disease process [ 3,28 ] .
in addition , the upregulation of bmp7 seen after anti - tnf treatment , which has an inhibitory effect on cartilage and bone destruction , supports an anabolic effect of tnf blockage .
until now , this association was shown with the wnt pathway in arthritic mice , in which inhibition of tnf decreased the expression of dickkopf , a wnt antagonist , known for its neutralizing effect on anabolic mechanisms while supporting catabolic pathways of joint destruction [ 29 ] , and with melanoma inhibitory activity in ra patients , a chondrocyte - specific molecule with anabolic characteristics , which has a decreased expression under pro - inflammatory cytokine conditions [ 30 ] .
results of earlier studies on bmp expression in ra already speculated on a potential role for bmps in ra. our group showed an increased expression of bmp2 and bmp6 in the synovium of ra patients and illustrated their association with apoptosis of synoviocytes [ 20 ] .
bmp4 and bmp5 , however , are reduced in the synovium of ra patients as compared with healthy patients [ 21 ] .
bmp7 has been demonstrated in the synovial fluid of ra patients and levels are correlated with severity of disease [ 31 ] .
marinova - mutafchieva and colleagues [ 22 ] observed bmp type ia ( activin - like receptor kinase - 3 ) receptor - positive mesenchymal cells in the synovium of ra patients , and recently we described different bmp target cells , including mostly fibroblast - like synoviocytes and the vascular - perivascular niche , in synovial biopsies of ra patients [ 28 ] .
an effective treatment of arthritis resulted in an overall reduction of active bmp signaling .
however , the pathway remained active and the relative number of p - smad1 / 5 - positive cells did not change , suggesting that indeed part of bmp regulation is inflammation - independent .
animal models of arthritis are increasingly used to address the role of bmps in disease pathogenesis .
our group previously studied the role of bmp signaling in joint homeostasis and repair by modulating the bmp signaling pathway in different mouse models of chronic arthritis [ 23 ] .
nog haploinsufficiency provided protection for articular cartilage against destruction in methylated bsa - induced arthritis and delayed the progression from cartilage to bone formation in a mouse model of spontaneous ankylosing enthesitis [ 23 ] by enhancing bmp signaling .
blaney davidson and colleagues [ 32 ] showed that bmp2 is associated with cartilage protection , chondrogenesis , and osteophyte formation in an animal model of osteoarthritis , and badlani and colleagues [ 33 ] demonstrated that bmp7 protected the articular cartilage in a rabbit model of osteoarthritis , confirming the in vitro pro - anabolic and anti - catabolic properties of bmp7 as proposed by chubinskaya and colleagues [ 34 ] and fan and colleagues [ 35 ] .
overexpression of nog rendered the cartilage more vulnerable in two mouse models of destructive arthritis ( methylated bsa and cia ) [ 23 ] and inhibited the onset and progression of remodeling arthritis [ 8 ] .
in contrast , in these overexpression or genetic models , we have not seen detectable differences in synovitis [ 23 ] .
recently , bobacz and colleagues [ 36 ] demonstrated a differential expression of gdf5 and bmp7 in articular cartilage and synovium of htnftg mice .
they found an increased expression of bmp7 and gdf5 in the synovium of htnftg mice along with a decrease of both genes in articular cartilage .
based on their in vitro data , they concluded that a decrease in the cartilage could compromise cartilage repair while an increase of bmp7 and gdf5 in the synovium might contribute to synovial hypertrophy .
however , steenvoorden and colleagues [ 37 ] showed that transforming growth factor - beta induced an epithelial - mesenchymal transition - like phenomenon , which apparently precedes synovial hypertrophy , and which can be inhibited in vitro by adding bmp7 .
contrasting data also exist on the function of bmp7 in other disease models .
in inflammatory bowel disease [ 38 ] and acute renal failure [ 39 ] , bmp7 treatment reduces the severity of the pathogenesis and favors healing .
bmp7 inhibits tumor growth in some forms of cancer [ 40 ] .
in contrast , bmp7 can promote cell invasion and tumor growth [ 41 ] and directs cancer to metastasis [ 42,43 ] or exerts malignant fibrinogenic effects [ 44 ] .
conclusion the data presented reveal that bmp signaling is activated during the course of cia , following a specific pattern , and may be partly independent of tnfalpha .
furthermore , tnf blocking possibly enhances repair mechanisms via upregulation of bmp7 .
our data also confirm that different cells in the synovium and cartilage are a target for bmp signaling .
taken together , the current data suggest a chondroprotective effect of bmps on articular cartilage , but the biological effect of different bmps in distinct synovial compartments may be more complex and further functional studies are warranted .

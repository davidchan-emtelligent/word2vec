abstract p62 / sequestosome 1 ( p62 ) is a multi - domain protein that functions as a receptor for ubiquitinated targets in the selective autophagy and serves as a scaffold in various signaling cascades .
p62 have been reported to be up - regulated in several human malignancies , but the biological roles and significance of p62 are still poorly understood in colorectal carcinoma .
we immunohistochemically evaluated p62 in 118 colorectal adenocarcinoma and 28 colorectal adenoma cases .
we used four colon carcinoma cells ( hct8 , ht29 , colo320 , and sw480 ) in the in vitro studies .
p62 immunoreactivity was detected in 11 % of colorectal adenoma cases and 31 % of adenocarcinoma cases , while it was negligible in the normal epithelium .
the immunohistochemical p62 status was significantly associated with synchronous liver metastasis , and it turned out to be an independent adverse prognostic factor in colorectal cancer patients .
following in vitro studies revealed that hct8 and ht29 cells transfected with p62 - specific sirna showed significantly decreased cell proliferation activity , whereas colo320 and sw480 cells transfected with p62 expression plasmid showed significantly increased cell proliferation activity .
the p62 - mediated cell proliferation was not associated with the autophagy activity .
these findings suggest that p62 promotes the cell proliferation mainly as a scaffold protein , and that the p62 status is a potent prognostic factor in colorectal carcinoma patients .

the prognosis of colorectal cancer has been recently improved due to advances in chemotherapy and target - specific therapies such as anti - epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) antibody therapy 2 .
however , the estimated 5 - year overall survival for early - stage colorectal carcinoma is 90 % , decreasing to 71 % for regional disease and 13 % for distant disease , respectively 1 .
therefore , it has becomes critical to find out clinical and biological markers that predict recurrence and also determine the postoperative algorithm of treatment in individual patients .
a multifunctional adapter protein , mammalian sequestosome 1 ( p62 / sqstm1 ) , hereinafter referred to as p62 , was identified as an ubiquitin - binding protein , transporting ubiquitinated proteins into autophagosomes through selective autophagy 3 , 4 , 5 .
in addition , p62 could activate several intracellular signaling pathways , such as nuclear factor - kappa - b ( nf - kappab ) , nuclear factor erythroid 2 - related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) , and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) signalings , as a multifunctional scaffold protein 6 , 7 , 8 .
p62 is constantly degraded by autophagy ancillary to ubiquitinated proteins under physiological conditions 3 , 4 , 5 .
however , emerging evidence has revealed that p62 protein accumulates in several types of malignant tumors such as gastrointestinal , prostate , liver , breast , and lung carcinomas 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , and it has been reported that p62 accumulation is related to adverse clinical outcomes in the patients of lung cancer 9 and triple - negative breast cancer 16 .
p62 immunolocalization has been reported in colorectal carcinomas 10 , 14 , 15 , but its biological functions and clinical significance , including correlation with the clinical outcome of patients , remain largely unknown .
in this study , we examined p62 immunoreactivity in human colorectal carcinoma and the biological functions of p62 in human colon carcinoma cell lines .
material and methods patients and tissues a total of 118 colorectal carcinoma specimens were obtained from patients who underwent surgical treatment between 2000 and 2006 in the department of surgery at tohoku university hospital , sendai , japan .

john wiley & sons , ltd correlation between p62 status and clinical outcome of colorectal carcinoma patients as demonstrated in figure 2a , the p62 status was significantly associated with adverse overall survival in the 118 colorectal carcinoma patients ( p = 0.0089 ) .
similar findings were detected regardless of the tnm stage [ p = 0.18 in tnm stage i - ii cases ( fig. 2b ) and p = 0.0062 in tnm stage iii - iv cases ( fig. 2c )] .
the p62 status was positively associated with synchronous liver metastasis in our present study ( table 1 ) , but the p62 status tended to be associated with an adverse prognosis in the patients without synchronous liver metastasis , although the association did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.062 ) ( fig. 2d ) .

john wiley & sons , ltd effects of p62 expression on cell proliferation in colon carcinoma cells immunohistochemical results suggest that p62 is overexpressed in human colorectal carcinoma cells .
when we examined p62 protein levels in human colon carcinoma ( hct8 and ht29 ) and normal colon epithelial ( ccd841 ) cell lines , p62 protein level was markedly and moderately detected in hct8 and ht29 cells , respectively , whereas it was negligible in ccd841 cells ( fig. 3a ) .

* p < 0.05 and *** p < 0.001 versus control cells ( left bar ) .
subsequently , we transfected p62 - specific sirna in hct8 and ht29 cells to evaluate the biological functions of p62 .
the p62 mrna expression levels were significantly ( p < 0.001 , respectively ) decreased in these cells transfected with p62 - specific sirna ( si1 or si2 ) at 2 days after transfection compared to those transfected with negative control sirna ( sic ) ( fig. 3b ) .
the expression level of p62 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting in these cells ( fig. 3c ) .
as shown in figure 3d , the number of cells was significantly lower in hct8 cells transfected with p62 - specific sirnas than in control cells transfected with sic ( p < 0.001 for si1 and p < 0.001 for si2 ) at 2 days after the transfection .
significant association was also detected in ht29 cells transfected with p62 - specific sirna ( p < 0.001 for si1 and p < 0.001 for si2 ) .
to confirm the association between p62 and cell proliferation , we then transiently overexpressed p62 in colo320 and sw480 colon carcinoma cells .
the p62 protein level was negligible and low in colo320 and sw480 cells , respectively , but it was markedly increased in the cells transfected with ha - tagged p62 expression plasmid for 2 days ( fig. 3e , upper panel ) .
the accumulation of p62 protein was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry in these cells ( fig. 3e , lower panel ) .
as shown in figure 3f , the cell proliferative activity was significantly more elevated in colo320 and sw480 cells transfected with p62 expression plasmid than in control cells transfected with sic at 3 days after the transfection ( p < 0.05 , respectively ) .
association between p62 - mediated cell proliferation and autophagy in colon carcinoma cells p62 is well known to play an important role in selective autophagy 3 , 4 , 5 and it is therefore very important to examine whether the p62 - mediated cell proliferation is associated with the autophagy activity in colon carcinoma cells .
as shown in figure 4a , treatment with an autophagy inhibitor , bafilomycin a1 ( 1 nmol / l , 3 days ) 22 , markedly increased the p62 and lc3 - ii ( lipidated form of lc3 , binding to the autophagosome membrane ) protein levels both in hct8 and ht29 cells transfected with sic and p62 - specific sirna , demonstrating sufficient suppression of autophagy by bafilomycin a1 treatment 24 .
however , the cell proliferative activity still remained significantly lower in hct8 cells transfected with p62 - specific sirnas than in controls transfected with sic ( p < 0.01 for si1 and p < 0.01 for si2 ) at 3 days after the transfection under the bafilomycin a1 treatment ( fig. 4b , left panel ) .
a similar association was also detected in ht29 cells ( p < 0.01 for si1 and p < 0.01 for si2 ) ( fig. 4b , right panel ) .

( a ) immunoblotting for p62 and lc3 in hct8 and ht29 cells transfected with p62 - specific sirna ( si1 , si2 ) and negative control sirna ( sic ) .

p62 , gfp , and mrfp staining is shown as blue , green and red , respectively .
blue arrows show puncta formation by p62 staining in the cytoplasm of the carcinoma cells .
colocalization of gfp and mrfp puncta appears as yellow in the gfp / mrfp merged images ( i.e. , yellow puncta ) , and colocalization of p62 and yellow puncta appears as white in the p62 / gfp / mrfp merged image ( bar = 10 mum ) .
in the inset , white arrows indicate yellow puncta with p62 and yellow arrowheads show yellow puncta without p62 ( bar = 5 mum ) .
( d ) number of yellow and red puncta in hct8 and ht29 cells cotransfected with tflc3 plasmid and sirna for p62 .
the values are presented as mean +/ - sd ( n = 20 ) .
** p < 0.01 and n.s. ; not significant versus control cells ( left bar ) .
in the immunofluorescence analysis , p62 staining was detected in the cytoplasm with puncta formation in hct8 cells transfected with sic ( fig. 4c , blue arrows ) , but it was almost diminished in hct8 cells transfected with p62 - specific sirna .
we also evaluated the autophagic activity in these cells by the tflc3 method 21 .
briefly , the tflc3 method is based on the distinction of gfp signal that disappeared due to the lysozomal environment , and the colocalization of gfp and mrfp puncta ( i.e. , yellow puncta in the merged image ) indicates tflc3 located at the phagophore or autophagosome .
in contrast , the mrfp puncta without gfp colocalization ( i.e. , red puncta ) corresponds to an amphisome or autolysosome .
figure 4c demonstrates that yellow puncta were frequently detected in hct8 cells transfected with sic , and a great majority (~ 95 %) of the yellow puncta was colocalized with p62 in these cells ( white arrows ) .
yellow puncta were also detected in hct8 cells transfected with p62 - specific sirna ( si1 or si2 ) , but approximately 40 % and 70 % of these puncta were not colocalized with p62 staining in hct8 and ht29 cells , respectively ( yellow arrowheads ) .
the numbers of yellow and red puncta in hct8 and ht29 cells transfected with si1 or si2 were similar to those cells transfected with sic ( fig. 4d ) .
discussion this is the first study to demonstrate that p62 immunoreactivity associated with adverse clinical outcomes in colorectal carcinoma patients .
in our present study , p62 immunoreactivity was detected in 31 % of the adenocarcinoma cases and 11 % of the adenoma cases , but it was almost negligible in the nonneoplastic epithelial cells .
previous studies have reported that p62 immunoreactivity was detected in several human malignancies such as stomach , colon , liver , lung , prostate , breast carcinomas 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , and its immunopositivity ranged from 20 % to 95 % in these studies .
increased p62 immunoreactivity in colon carcinoma compared to normal epithelium has been reported previously 10 , 14 , 15 , which was consistent with results of our present study .
previously , takamura et al. showed that multiple benign liver adenomas occurred in autophagy - deficient mice and additional knockout of p62 lead to the size of the tumors being smaller 25 .
therefore , p62 overexpression is suggested to be involved in the progression of colorectal tumors .
our present result also revealed that p62 - immunopositivity was significantly higher in the carcinoma than the adenoma cases , suggesting the particular importance of p62 in colorectal carcinoma .
the results of our in vitro studies demonstrated that p62 significantly promoted the cell proliferation of colorectal carcinoma cells .
p62 has an important function as a receptor for selective autophagy 3 , 4 , 5 , and autophagy was reported to be required for the growth of pancreatic carcinoma 26 .
the results of our present immunofluorescence analyses revealed that p62 was frequently colocalized with yellow puncta ( autophagosomes ) in the colon carcinoma cells , but the autophagic activity was not linked to the p62 expression level or p62 - mediated cell proliferation in these cells .
previously , komatsu et al. reported no significant change in the autophagic activity in the liver of p62 - knockout mice 27 and takamura et al. demonstrated that p62 accumulation caused by a deficiency of autophagy contributed to tumor progression in autophagy - deficient mice 25 .
our present results are in good agreement with these reports above and suggest that autophagy is not directly associated with the p62 - mediated cell proliferation .
p62 also plays an important role as a multifunctional scaffold protein in cell signaling pathways .
for instance , p62 overexpression induced by kras mutation activated nf - kappab signaling pathway and enhanced tumorigenesis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 6 , and nrf2 activation by p62 contributed to tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma 7 .
in addition , duran et al. reported that p62 promoted tumorigenesis through the activation of the mtorc1 pathway 8 .
taken together , these findings and our present results show that p62 is considered to play important roles in the proliferation of colorectal carcinoma , mainly through the activation of cell signaling as a scaffold protein rather than through modulation of the autophagic activity .
ki - 67 antibody detects cells in all phases of the cell cycle except g0 ( resting ) phase 28 .
ki - 67 li is frequently used for the assessment of proliferative activity in various tumors , and high ki - 67 li in tumor tissues is generally correlated with poor survival in breast and lung carcinomas , astrocytoma , and meningioma patients 29 .
however , we did not find a significant association between p62 immunoreactivity and ki - 67 li in the colorectal carcinoma cases .
it is also true that overexpression of ki - 67 induced growth arrest 30 , and hilska et al. suggested that strongly stained tumor cells had a slow cell cycle and a low proliferation rate 31 .
in colorectal carcinoma , valera et al. showed that ki - 67 is a worse prognostic parameter 32 , and kawakami et al. reported that high ki - 67 expression was a prognostic factor for liver metastasis 33 .
however , several investigators also reported that higher ki - 67 li was paradoxically associated with longer survival in colon cancer patients 34 , 35 .
therefore , the significance of ki - 67 li still remains controversial in colorectal cancer patients , in contrast to that in other human malignancies .
in this study , p62 immunoreactivity was significantly associated with liver metastasis in colorectal carcinoma .
the p62 status was significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes in the colorectal carcinoma patients , and multivariate analysis revealed that the p62 status was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in the patients .
recently , inoue et al. demonstrated p62 as an independent poor prognostic factor for lung cancer - specific survival 9 , and luo et al. reported that p62 accumulation was an independent prognostic factor for disease - free survival in triple - negative breast cancer patients 16 .
the results of these studies are in good agreement with those in our study .
p62 increased migration and invasion in glioblastoma stem cells 36 , and p62 immunoreactivity was correlated with distant metastasis in breast carcinoma 17 .
moreover , yu et al. reported that cisplatin - resistant skov3 / ddp ovarian carcinoma cells expressed much higher levels of p62 than did cisplatin - sensitive skov3 cells , and knockdown of p62 resensitized skov3 / ddp cells to cisplatin 37 .
therefore , p62 possibly regulates a variety of biological functions in colorectal carcinoma cells in addition to the induction of proliferative activity , and residual carcinoma cells following surgical treatment in p62 - positive colorectal carcinomas could still have a potential for rapid recurrence .
we could not examine biological functions of p62 in colorectal carcinoma cells using mouse transplantation model in this study , and further studies are needed to clarify the molecular functions and possible therapeutic potential of p62 in human colorectal carcinoma .
in summary , p62 immunoreactivity was detected in 11 % of colorectal adenoma and 31 % of the adenocarcinoma cases , while it was almost negligible in the normal epithelium .
the p62 status was significantly associated with synchronous liver metastasis in the colorectal carcinoma cases , and it turned out to be an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival in the patients .
subsequent in vitro studies revealed that p62 expression levels were significantly associated with the cell proliferation activity of colorectal carcinoma cells , but the p62 - mediated cell proliferation was not correlated with the autophagy activity .
these findings suggest that p62 promotes the cell proliferation of colorectal carcinoma mainly as a scaffold protein , and the p62 status in carcinoma cells could serve as a potent prognostic factor in human colorectal cancer patients .
conflict of interest we declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript .

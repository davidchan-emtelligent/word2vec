cannabis adverse effects substance - related disorders dear editor , in the article entitled " laboratory profiles of treatment - seeking subjects with concurrent dependence on cannabis and other substances : a comparative study " , authors have focused on the systemic adverse effects of cannabis consumption through the evaluation of routine hematological parameters .
cannabis is extensively studied for its effects on the central nervous system , while its long term effects on other organs and systems are not much considered .
endocannabinoid system plays a key role in the modulation of hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system .
it is involved in regulating various cardiovascular activities such as heart rate , blood pressure and the baroreflex .
data emerged from studies performed on patients affected by myocardial infarction have shown that cannabis consumption increases the risk of myocardial infarction in the hour after use , as well as the mortality in a dose - dependent manner ( 1 ) .
moreover , a growing body of evidences suggests that cb1 receptors exert influence over the development of insulin resistance and liver lipogenesis .
on the other hand , cb2 receptors can cause liver inflammation and antifribogenic activity .
overall , clinical and experimental studies have confirmed the involvement of endocannabinoids in the pathogenesis of liver steatosis and cirrhosis .
data emerged from the studies performed on patients affected by hepatitis c have indicated the association between severe steatosis and cannabis consumption ( 2 ) .
additionally , endocannabinoid receptors , in particular the cb2 type , are involved in the development and modulation of immune and hematologic cells .
information derived from studies performed on chronic cannabis consumers have shown that this substance can reduce the number of t and b lymphocytes and increase the number of eosinophils ( 3 ) .
although the cannabis consumption is not associated with severe acute effects on health , clinical information have evidenced that its chronic use can produce significant alterations in many biological systems .
thus , patients should be discouraged from the recreational use of cannabis .
furthermore , the misleading message that cannabis is a soft and low risk drug should be reconsidered , given the growing scientific information demonstrating the contrary .
quraishi et al. promoted a more complete and adequate medical assessment of cannabis dependent patients in the absence of sophisticated diagnostic instruments .
a better international cooperation is of great importance in order to promote common guidelines for monitoring and preventing the adverse effects of cannabis consumption .
authors' contribution : both authors have contributed equally to realization of this letter .

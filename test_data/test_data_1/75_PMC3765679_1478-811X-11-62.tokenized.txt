background pannexins ( panxs ) are relatively newly discovered large - pore ion and metabolite permeable channels .
although no proteomics - based interactome has yet been published , panx1 has been demonstrated to interact with actin in an ectopic expression system .
this interaction affects both panx1 plasma membrane stability as well as cytoskeletal remodelling .
the current study builds on our recent discovery of panx1 expression in ventricular zone ( vz ) neural stem and progenitor cells ( nsc / npcs ) , and on the demonstrated interaction of panx1 with the cytoskeleton .
findings here we demonstrate that panx1 also plays roles in two additional cell behaviours associated with neurogenesis , including cell migration and neurite extension .
furthermore , we confirm an endogenous interaction between actin and panx1 , and identify a new interaction with actin - related protein 3 , an actin cytoskeleton - modulating protein .
conclusions this study further establishes the importance of panx1 in the cell biology of nsc / npcs and strengthens and expands our knowledge of panx1 interactions with the cytoskeleton .
findings panxs are four - pass transmembrane proteins that oligomerize to form large - pore mechanosensitive channels permeable to ions and metabolites of up to 1 kda in size , such as adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) [ 1,2 ] .
we recently detected panx1 expression in the neuro - 2a ( n2a ) cell line as well as in post - natal ventricular zone ( vz ) neural stem and progenitor cells ( nsc / npcs ) , where it positively regulates cell proliferation in part through release of atp that results in activation of purinergic receptors .
this built on earlier work demonstrating an important role of constitutively released episodic bursts of atp in the proliferation of vz nsc / npcs , which in turn activates metabotropic purinergic receptors in an autocrine and paracrine manner [ 3 - 5 ] .
perhaps not surprisingly , as a mechanosensitive channel , recent work has shown that panx1 is actually physically linked to the cytoskeleton .
in an ectopic expression system , panx1 was reported to physically interact directly with actin [ 6 ] .
a recent study in glioma cells further supported a role for panx1 in the dynamic regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling [ 7 ] .
here we extend on our previous discovery of panx1 expression in vz nsc / npcs by further defining the cell - type demographics of panx1 over the course of vz neurogenesis , by demonstrating that panx1 plays a role in additional cell behaviours associated with neurogenesis , including cell migration and neurite outgrowth , and by uncovering additional interactions with cytoskeletal elements , further establishing the relationship of panx1 with the cytoskeleton .
in our previous study [ 8 ] we observed marked panx1 expression in nestin - positive / glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) - positive and nestin - positive / gfap - negative nsc / npcs , but detected little to no panx1 expression in doublecortin ( dcx ) positive neuroblasts in cultures of differentiating vz neurospheres , and in dcx - positive neuroblasts migrating from the dorsolateral corner of the lateral ventricle in coronal sections from immature mice ( postnatal day 15 ; p15 ) .
to extend on these findings we investigated the expression of panx1 in dcx - positive cells in the adult mouse brain ( p60 ) .
for a complete description of the methods used in this report , please see additional file 1 .
interestingly , we observed robust panx1 expression in dcx - positive cells in rostral coronal sections through the lateral ventricles , but relatively minimal panx1 in dcx - positive cells in more caudal coronal sections through the lateral ventricles ( figure 1c - e ) .
the high level of panx1 expression in rostral dcx - positive migrating migratory neuroblasts suggested that panx1 might play a role in modulating the process of cell migration from the vz. to directly investigate the involvement of panx1 in cell migration , we employed a scratch wound closure assay [ 9 ] monitored in real time ( figure 2a - c ) , in parallel sets of panx1 sirna and control sirna treated cells .
over time , cell migration into the scratch wound leads to a decrease in width ( wound closure ) , and thus differences in the rate of wound closure can be attributed to differences in cell migration [ 9 ]. with a knockdown in panx1 expression of approximately 60 % in panx1 sirna - treated cells compared with control sirna - treated cells ( figure 2d,e ) , we observed a significant impairment in wound closure .
in the corresponding western blot , the expected panx1 band is present at ~ 50 kda corresponding to the full length , fully glycosylated species [ 10,11 ] .
the observed lower band was not always present on western blots of n2a lysates ( for example see figure 3 ) ; however when present , it was specifically knocked down by the sirna .
this suggests that it is indeed a form of panx1 and likely represents one of the lower , less glycosylated species .
while we could not track panx1 knockdown to specific cells , the levels of knockdown we obtained in the overall population provided a significant reduction in cell migration .
together these data suggest that panx1 plays a role in regulating cell migration .

all scalebars are 10 mum .
dcx - positive neuroblasts overall appeared to express less panx1 than nsc / npcs immediately proximal to the ventricle , suggesting that panx1 expression decreases with differentiation .
this was confirmed in vitro in retinoic acid and low serum differentiated n2a cells and differentiating vz nsc / npc cultures ( figure 3a,b ) .
interestingly , immunostaining of endogenous panx1 in neuronally differentiated vz cells and n2a cells revealed strong panx1 expression within the developing neurites ( figure 3a,b ) .
since differentiation of n2a cells and vz nsc / npcs in vitro is associated with such marked neurite outgrowth , we examined whether blocking or knocking down panx1 can , on its own , induce neurite extension in the absence of additional differentiation stimuli .
indeed , blocking panx1 with probenecid [ 12 - 14 ] induced marked neurite extension in both n2a cells and vz nsc / npcs ( figure 3c - i ) .
similarly , panx1 sirna knockdown in n2a cells caused increased neurite outgrowth without additional stimuli ( figure 3j ) , while panx1egfp overexpression inhibited neurite extension in n2a cells induced to differentiate ( figure 3k ) .
current knowledge points to close links between panx1 and cytoskeletal dynamics , and the cell behaviours in which panx1 appears to be involved in the context of neurogenesis ( proliferation , migration , neurite outgrowth ) are all tightly linked to the cytoskeleton .
to better understand the interface between panx1 and the cytoskeleton and to determine whether this underlies panx1 regulation of vz nsc / npcs we set out to uncover novel panx1 interactors using an unbiased proteomics strategy ; we are the first group , to our knowledge , to do so. we therefore performed immunoprecipitations from n2a cells overexpressing panx1 - egfp or egfp as control ( figure 4a ) .
the egfp tag does not affect the trafficking or functioning of the panx1 [ 6,15,16 ] and therefore was deemed suitable for use in identification of interactors .
the identification of interactors was performed by high - performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry ( lc - ms / ms ) .
all proteins precipitated by the egfp tag alone were excluded from further analysis .

the expected panx1 band is present at ~ 50 kda , as well as a lower band that likely corresponds to another glycosylation species .
arp3 and beta - actin were confirmed to interact with endogenous panx1 .
we discovered several novel interactions , including several cytoskeleton - related proteins .
gene ontology ( go ) analysis ( http :// www.broadinstitute.org / gsea / msigdb / index.jsp ) of hits revealed that 10 % of the putative panx1 - interacting proteins amenable to go analysis could be classified by the generic go term go : 0005856 aka ' cytoskeleton ' ( additional file 2 : table s1 ) .
this go term refers to ' any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells , and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm .
the term embraces intermediate filaments , microfilaments , microtubules , the microtrabecular lattice , and other structures characterized by a polymeric filamentous nature and long - range order within the cell .
the various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve in the maintenance of cellular shape but also have roles in other cellular functions , including cellular movement , cell division , endocytosis , and movement of organelles . '
a large number of these newly identified cytoskeleton - associated proteins ( 14 / 26 ) were associated with the go term collectively known as ' actin _ cytoskeleton ' ( go : 0015629 ) .
among these , we observed significant overlap of actin - related protein 3 ( arp3 ; figure 4b,c ) and actin ( figure 4d ) with panx1egfp by confocal microscopy .
interestingly , as with endogenous panx1 , we also observed high levels of panx1egfp localized to neurites and other cellular protrusions resembling filopodia ( figure 4c,d ) .
finally , endogenous panx1 , actin and arp3 co - precipitated from n2a cells ( figure 4e ) .
actin was previously identified as a panx1 interactor in cells ectopically expressing panx1 [ 6 ] ; this confirms that an interaction occurs between the two endogenously expressed proteins .
the novel panx1 interactor , arp3 , is a major component of the arp2 / 3 complex , a seven - subunit protein that plays a major role in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( reviewed in firat - karalar and welch , 2011 [ 17 ]) .
a link between panx1 and actin cytoskeleton rearrangements has previously been described [ 7 ] .
arp3 closely resemble the structure of monomeric actin , and one of its functions is to serve as a nucleation site for new actin filaments .
actin and actin - associated proteins , including the arp2 / 3 complex , have been shown to be integral in both migration [ 18,19 ] and neurite outgrowth [ 19,20 ] .
actin polymerization in lamellipodia and filopodia of migrating cells provides the necessary driving force for leading edge protrusion .
furthermore , arp2 / 3 complex regulates the actin filaments present in these cellular processes .
in fact , arp2 / 3 depletion has been shown to significantly reduce filopodia formation in both primary neurons and neuroblastoma cells [ 21 ] , while alterations to arp2 / 3 function cause dysregulation of lamellipodia dynamics [ 22 ] .
furthermore , arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization regulates growth cone mobility and neuritogenesis [ 23 ] , as loss of arp2 / 3 activity causes erratic neurite numbers and extension , as well as increased focal adhesions [ 21 ] .
moreover , in agreement with our previously published work illustrating a role for panx1 in the positive regulation of vz nsc / npc proliferation , the actin cytoskeleton has been shown to be indispensable for cell division ( reviewed in firat - karalar and welch , 2011 [ 17 ]) .
this includes roles in contractile ring formation , centrosome separation , and spindle positioning .
as panx1 interactors , actin and arp3 have illustrated a direct connection between panx1 and the actin cytoskeleton .
this further supports the observed role for panx1 in the actin - associated behaviours of cell migration and neurite outgrowth , as well as that previously published linking panx1 to cell proliferation .
altogether , our data expand on our previous findings by demonstrating that panx1 is expressed in dcx - positive migrating neuroblasts in adult brain , and is also involved in additional cell behaviours associated with neurogenesis , including migration and neurite outgrowth .
further , our analysis of protein interactions uncovered a novel panx1 interacting protein , arp3 , a major part of the arp2 / 3 complex , which is an important regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in cell proliferation , neuritogenesis and cell migration [ 17 ] .
we also established that endogenously expressed panx1 interacts with actin , and discovered that a large proportion of panx1 interacting proteins are associated with the cytoskeleton .
overall , this study provides novel evidence reinforcing the link between panx1 and the cytoskeleton , and suggests that this relationship underlies the regulation and function of panx1 in vz nsc / npcs .

normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( nchh ) is a rare reproductive disease leading to lack of puberty and infertility .
loss - of - function mutations of gnrh1 gene are a very rare cause of autosomal recessive nchh .
r31c gnrh1 is the only missense mutation that affects the conserved gnrh decapeptide sequence .
this mutation was identified in a cpg islet in nine nchh subjects from four unrelated families , giving evidence for a putative " hot spot " .
interestingly , all the nchh patients carry this mutation in heterozygosis that strikingly contrasts with the recessive inheritance associated with frame shift and non - sense mutations .
therefore , after exclusion of a second genetic event , a comprehensive functional characterization of the mutant r31c gnrh was undertaken .
using different cellular models , we clearly demonstrate a dramatic reduction of the mutant decapeptide capacity to bind gnrh - receptor , to activate mapk pathway and to trigger inositol phosphate accumulation and intracellular calcium mobilization .
in addition it is less able than wild type to induce lh - beta transcription and lh secretion in gonadotrope cells .
finally , the absence of a negative dominance in vitro offers a unique opportunity to discuss the complex in vivo patho - physiology of this form of nchh .

introduction the gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( gnrh ) is essential in mammalian reproduction .
this decapeptide , released from hypothalamic gnrh - neurons , triggers an intracellular cascade involving ip3 accumulation , calcium mobilization and mapk phosphorylation through its cognate receptor gnrhr .
the activation of these signaling pathways ultimately stimulates the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins ( lh and fsh ) by pituitary gonadotrope cells .
the decapeptide sequence is conserved among most mammals and the amino and carboxyl termini are conserved in mammals and invertebrates [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
mutations of the human gnrh1 gene , encoding a 92 amino - acid pre - pro - gnrh , are a very rare cause of normosmic congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( nchh ) .
a frame shift resulting in a failure to translate the gnrh peptide sequence gives rise to nchh with autosomal recessive inheritance [ 5 ] .
subsequently a p.r31c gnrh1 mutation in which arginine is substituted by cysteine has been described [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
this is the sole mutation affecting the gnrh decapeptide sequence .
the arginine in position 8 of the gnrh decapeptide has been shown to be crucial for biological activity [ 2 ] - [ 4 ] and shown to interact with an acidic residue in the mouse [ 8 ] and in the human [ 9 ] gnrh - rs. this mutation , though identified in two nchh families in two independent series [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , has not been characterized .
in these families , the somehow afflicted individuals were heterozygous .
this observation is surprising as the frame shift gnrh1 mutation only resulted in nchh in homozygous patients [ 5 ] .
here we report on the identification of p.r31c mutation in three individuals in two additional unrelated nchh families .
all the individuals are heterozygous for the mutation .
we have undertaken a comprehensive molecular characterization of the mutation in order to understand the mechanism of nchh in these individuals .
results genetic analysis we identified the gnrh1 c.91c > t ( p.r31c ) mutation in two unrelated french families with nchh .
demographic , clinical , biological and genetic data are reported in table 1 .
interestingly , the two pedigrees are very different in terms of presentation ( fig. 1 ) .
in family 1 , nchh is sporadic .
the boy ( ii.1 ) presented at 19 years old with a failure to progress through puberty .
at physical examination he had a partial pubertal development with 12 - ml bilateral testes volume .
he had no olfactory impairment .
hormone assays revealed very low testosterone levels and low gonadotropin levels .
no secondary causes were found for central hypogonadism ( see table 1 ) .
gnrh1 heterozygous mutation in this boy was de novo , as ascertained by micro - satellites analysis .

in the family 2 the mutation was transmitted from the mother ( i.2 ) to her son ( ii.1 ) .
she required medical assistance for procreation .

** subjective olfactometry was performed by a computed - assisted validated test [ 35 ] .
in the second family the gnrh1 mutation was present in heterozygosis and segregated with disease .
the boy ( ii.1 ) was diagnosed having hypogonadotropic hypogonadism because of small testis volume ( 10 ml at left , 12 ml at right testis ) , low serum testosterone and low gonadotropins .
his pubertal stage was p3 according to tanner .
he had no anosmia .
common causes of secondary hypogonadism were excluded .
his mother ( i.2 ) was affected by primary amenorrhea , and conceived after ovarian stimulation by exogenous gonadotropins , although a formal diagnosis was not established at that time .
she was re - evaluated later at the age of 65 , and hormone assays revealed low sex steroids accompanied with inappropriately low gonadotropins .
she had no other apparent secondary causes ( see table 1 ) .
the father ( i.1 ) was not available for genetic analysis .
we did not identify a second genetic event after genomic regulatory region analysis of gnrh1 locus and gnrh1 cdna sequencing in all propositii .
predictive analysis the gnrh1 c.91c > t nucleotide substitution did not create any donor or acceptor aberrant splice site according to prediction tools with alamut ( r ) software .
this nucleotidic substitution induces a missense at codon 31 , replacing arginine - 31 by a cysteine in the pre - pro - gnrh ( gnrh1 p.r31c ) .
prop v.1.0b predicted that this missense did not abolish proconvertase - dependent cleavage site for pre - pro - gnrh maturation into the decapeptide ( amino - acids 24 to 33 ) .
alignment with orthologs revealed conservation of arginine in position 8 of gnrh in mammals ( fig. 1 ) .
this amino acid exchange was classified as deleterious by various in silico prediction tools ( see methods section ) .
more importantly , experiments on the substitution of arginine 8 with a variety of amino acids demonstrate that it is crucial for binding and signaling [ 10 ] .
arginine 8 was further shown by mutagenesis studies in the gnrh - r that it interacted with an acidic residue in the extracellular loop three of the mouse ( glutamate 301 ) and the human ( aspartate 302 ) gnrh - rs [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
in vitro molecular characterization r31c and wild - type ( wt ) decapeptides were stable over 24 - hours at room temperature in water and culture medium .
no dimerization of the mutant decapeptide was found ( fig. s1 ) .
the r31c gnrh peptide bound the gnrh - r with an affinity more than 100 - fold lower than that of wt gnrh ( fig. 2a and 2b ) .
dose - response curves with sre - luciferase assay showed an almost 100 - fold reduction of r31c agonist versus wt ( fig. 3a ) .
the ec - 50 was 4 nm for wt gnrh and 314 nm for r31c gnrh ( p < 0.0001 , fig. 3b ) .

r31c gnrh showed similar kinetics , but the degree of phosphorylation was reduced ( fig. 4a ) .

the maximal ip generated by both ligands was the same indicating that the r31c gnrh peptide was a full agonist , as was found in the sre - luciferase assay .

the experiment was conducted four times and each sample was assayed in duplicates .
wt gnrh strongly stimulated lh secretion over baseline ( p < 0.001 ) .
r31c gnrh significantly stimulated lh secretion in lbetat2 cells supernatants over baseline ( p = 0.042 , fig. 7b ) .
the above findings clearly show that in binding , signaling and functional assays , the r31c gnrh is less potent than wt gnrh .
since the heterozygous condition was associated with nchh in our patients , that could suggest a dominant negative effect , we studied the effects of combining wt gnrh with r31c gnrh .
we hypothesized that the cysteine in position 8 of the r31c gnrh might form disulfide bridges with cysteine residues in the receptor that are not in disulfide bridges .
there are three such cysteines : cysteine 218 , cysteine 279 and cysteine 317 .
in order to examine this possibility the effects of r31c gnrh pre - incubation on subsequent binding of a radio - labelled gnrh analog was examined .
we determined from the competition binding study that r31c gnrh would occupy 50 % of receptors .
as a control , we utilized wt gnrh at 10 - 8 m , which also occupies 50 % of receptors .
after treatment , the cells were extensively washed to remove all non - covalently bound peptide .
subsequent binding of radiolabeled gnrh analog was the same in these treatments as well as in medium - treated cells ( fig. 2b ) .
these findings indicate that both wt gnrh and r31c gnrh can be fully removed from the receptor , indicating that r31c gnrh does not form covalent disulfide bonds with the receptor .
dose - response curves generated from sre - coupled luciferase were indistinguishable from wt gnrh administered alone ( fig. 3a ) .
after pulsatile administration of each ligand at 90 - minute frequency , wt gnrh was more potent than r31c gnrh to induce luciferase activity coupled to sre reporter gene .
combination of wt and r31c was not able to impair luciferase activity when compared to wt alone ( fig. s2 ) .
treatment of lbetat2 and gnrh - r - expressing hek293t cells with 10 nm wt gnrh in combination with 10 nm r31c gnrh induced similar kinetics of erk1 / 2 phosphorylation compared to 10 nm wt alone ( fig. 4a ) .
increasing the dose of r31c gnrh from 10 nm to 300 nm in the presence of 10 nm wt gnrh did not reduce erk1 / 2 phosphorylation at 5 minutes exposure ( fig. 4b ) .
calcium peak and area under the curve after treatment with the combination of 10 nm gnrh and 10 nm mutant peptide was indistinguishable from wt gnrh alone ( fig. 5 ) .
ip dose - response curve with equal concentrations of wt and r31c peptides was indistinguishable from wt gnrh alone ( fig. 6 ) .
this indicates that a full range of doses of r31c gnrh does not influence the ability of wt to bind and activate the gnrh - r .
r31c gnrh was also unable to influence the stimulation of lhb transcription ( fig. 7a ) or lh secretion ( fig. 7b ) from lbetat2 cells by wt gnrh .
discussion gnrh1 mutations are a very rare cause of nchh [ 5 ] - [ 7 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
the gnrh1 p.r31c mutation is the only description of an amino acid change in gnrh .
yet this mutation has been described in nine individuals in four separate families .
this mutation was first reported in association with nchh in heterozygosis and a dominant inheritance was postulated [ 6 ] , contrasting with the previously described recessive transmission of the frame shift mutation , which fails to transcribe the gnrh sequence [ 5 ] .
some nchh individuals with the r31c mutation concomitantly had variations in other nchh genes perhaps suggesting oligogenism .
more recently , the r31c mutation was reported in a girl with no variations in other nchh and kallmann syndrome - related genes [ 7 ] .
this is of interest since this study analyzed all known genes associated with nchh and kallmann syndrome aiming to establish the prevalence of oligogenism in these syndromes .
this mutation was considered not sufficient to explain the phenotype because of the heterozygous inheritance [ 7 ] .
in the present study , we have found the same mutation in three additional nchh patients from two unrelated families and unrelated to the previously described families with the r31c mutation .
although sex steroid and gonadotropin levels undoubtedly related to chh , more - than 4 ml testicular volume in patients at presentation suggested a residual functional activity of hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis , probably reflecting heterozygosity .
the identification of this recurrent mutation in four unrelated families , the finding of a de novo event in one family and the location of the nucleotide base change within a cpg islet are three consistent arguments for a mutational << hot spot >> .
as interest , this amino acid is the most variable among vertebrate and invertebrate gnrhs [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
the r31c gnrh mutation has never been identified in controls and segregation with the phenotype has been found in all affected families ( see table 2 ) .
furthermore , this nucleotide base change has not been identified in 5989 individuals from the exome sequencing project ( esp ) cohort ( nhlbi go , seattle , wa ; url : http :// evs.gs.washington.edu / evs ; october , 2012 ) .
thus , this implies that this missense mutation is likely responsible for the nchh phenotype .
however , although the r31c gnrh had very low activity in receptor binding , sre - luciferase , ip , ca2 + , erk1 / 2 signaling and in lhb gene expression and lh secretion , we were unable to demonstrate any dominant negative effect on wt gnrh activities .

a : the mother of the female propositus has been represented as a carrier but no clinical data are reported .
b : 120 chh patients and 345 healthy subjects have been added to previously published data [ 5 ] .
previous genetic studies established that gnrh1 loss of function mutations lead to an autosomal recessive nchh .
thus we first searched for another genetic event at gnrh1 locus .
this was excluded by an exhaustive analysis of the entire sequence of intron 1 present in the hypothalamic primary transcript , the sequence of the upstream and downstream gnrh1 promoters and the cdna coding regions [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
we also ruled out oligogenism by sequencing the main genes associated with nchh and kallmann syndrome [ 15 ] - [ 17 ] , although wdr11 , chd7 and sema3a , other genes known to be associated with chh , have not been analyzed .
furthermore , we cannot entirely exclude the contribution of a gene not known to be associated with chh .
next generation sequencing methods could be helpful to find a possible second genetic defect .
in order to investigate the possible mechanisms whereby r31c gnrh might influence the actions of wt gnrh , as it is apparently the case in the patients , we set about first examining the activity of the r31c gnrh in receptor binding and variety of signaling pathways , as well as its ability to stimulate lh release .
we then examined its ability to affect wt gnrh actions in these systems .
r31c gnrh had a binding affinity of more than 100 - fold lower than that of wt gnrh .
consistent with this observation , r31c gnrh had similar reductions in potency ( increased ec - 50 values ) in stimulation of sre - luciferase and ip generation .
however , r31c gnrh was able to elicit the same maximal stimulation of sre - luciferase and ip , clearly demonstrating that it is a full agonist in recruiting these signaling pathways .
this indicates that it has no antagonistic activity and it is therefore unlikely to explain the phenotype of the heterozygous patients .
supporting these observations , r31c peptide determined weaker responses in contrast to those of wt gnrh on erk1 / 2 phosphorylation , ca2 + mobilization , lhb transcription and lh secretion .
further studies confirmed our interpretation that r31c gnrh does not antagonize wt gnrh actions at the receptor level .
when r31c gnrh , at concentrations varying from 10 - 10 m to 10 - 6 m , was added in combination with wt gnrh at 10 - 9 m in various experiments , it failed to have any impact on receptor binding , sre - luciferase , ip generation and ca2 + signaling or on lhb transcription and lh secretion .
these findings are in accordance with our understanding of structure - activity relations of gnrh analogs and their interaction with the gnrh - r. arginine 8 is crucial for the correct conformation of mammalian gnrh and for its binding to the receptor [ 1 ] - [ 4 ] .
in particular arginine 8 has been demonstrated to be crucial for the interaction with the aspartate 302 of the human gnrh - r and the glutamate 301 of the mouse gnrh - r [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 18 ] .
the mode of inheritance , apparently dominant in four families , is thus not explained by a simple negative dominance in the parameters that we have measured .
there are other possibilities that were not investigated here .
firstly , the mutant peptide may interact with molecules within the gnrh neuron to impair activity or induce toxicity , thereby reducing wt gnrh secretion .
aberrant transcription products might be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or could act as neurotoxic agents , as already demonstrated for pro - dynorphin in ataxia [ 19 ] or arginine - vasopressin variants in diabetes insipidus [ 20 ] .
another possibility is that , in gnrh neurons , the r31c gnrh precursor forms an aberrant intermolecular disulfide bridge with the wt gnrh precursor , which disrupts correct folding of the molecule leading to detection by surveillance proteins and trafficking to lysosomes for degradation of both peptides .
in addition , the heterodimer may be resistant to processing .
although a wide range of cellular models was used , they do not necessarily reflect in vivo events .
despite abundant literature , the molecular mechanisms underlying gnrh - r down - regulation and pulse deciphering remain currently poorly understood [ 21 ] - [ 23 ] .
it is of note that sre - luciferase activity was not impaired after four pulses at 90 - minute frequency ( fig. s2 ) .
nevertheless a slow and progressive loss of pituitary response to mutant gnrh might require a longer pulsatile exposure .
in this context , a transgenic mouse model may shed light on the mechanism of the dominant negative effect [ 24 ] .
in conclusion , together with our report , four nchh families carrying r31c gnrh1 heterozygous mutations have been identified .
as this is a putative << hot spot >> mutation it is likely to be identified in other nchh families .
the families harboring the r31c mutation are of great interest for reproductive sciences since the pathophysiology is not explained by in vitro experiments .
there is herein an obvious opportunity to study novel aspects of gnrh signaling in vivo and / or to identify novel genes modulating gnrh reproductive function .

it has been suggested that above - ground biomass ( agb ) inventories should include tree height ( h ) , in addition to diameter ( d ) .
as h is a difficult variable to measure , h - d models are commonly used to predict h. we tested a number of approaches for h - d modelling , including additive terms which increased the complexity of the model , and observed how differences in tree - level predictions of h propagated to plot - level agb estimations .
we were especially interested in detecting whether the choice of method can lead to bias .
the compared approaches listed in the order of increasing complexity were : ( b0 ) agb estimations from d - only ; ( b1 ) involving also h obtained from a fixed - effects h - d model ; ( b2 ) involving also species ; ( b3 ) including also between - plot variability as random effects ; and ( b4 ) involving multilevel nested random effects for grouping plots in clusters .
in light of the results , the modelling approach affected the agb estimation significantly in some cases , although differences were negligible for some of the alternatives .
the most important differences were found between including h or not in the agb estimation .
we observed that agb predictions without h information were very sensitive to the environmental stress parameter ( e ) , which can induce a critical bias .
regarding the h - d modelling , the most relevant effect was found when species was included as an additive term .
we presented a two - step methodology , which succeeded in identifying the species for which the general h - d relation was relevant to modify .
based on the results , our final choice was the single - level mixed - effects model ( b3 ) , which accounts for the species but also for the plot random effects reflecting site - specific factors such as soil properties and degree of disturbance .

introduction forest is the main terrestrial biotic reservoir for above - ground carbon stock [ 1 ] .
for this reason , accurate estimates of forest above - ground biomass ( agb ) are required to understand the global carbon cycle , thereby to implement climate change mitigation policies [ 2 ] , and support project activities such as redd + ( reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries + conservation of forest carbon stocks , sustainable management of forest and enhancement of forest carbon stocks ) [ 3 ] .
globally , substantial effort has been made to develop robust and cost - effective above - ground biomass estimation methods , including field measurements and remote sensing [ 4 ] .
however , the accuracy in the estimation of agb still lags behind the required level , and uncertainties in the terrestrial carbon storage are particularly large in the tropical areas [ 5 ] .
in comparison to other regions of the world , the agb estimates of the african forests and woodlands , however , remain scarce [ 6,7 ] .
in terms of redd + , large areas of savanna woodlands , shrublands and agroforestry parklands qualify as forests ( e.g. [ 8 ]) .
biomass typically constitutes the largest fraction of the primary energy consumption in these areas [ 7 ] , and hence agb estimates are important part of fuelwood resource assessments [ 9 ] .
although destructive sampling of above - ground biomass estimation is an accurate method ( e.g. , [ 9 - 17 ]) , its implementation for carbon inventories is rarely practical and hence allometric models are commonly used instead ( e.g. , [ 1,4,6,18 ]) .
since allometric models might be an important source of estimation uncertainty [ 19 - 22 ] , the selection of the most suitable model from the literature requires special attention .
furthermore , using species - specific models is an unfeasible option in species - rich tropical countries [ 23 ] and therefore mixed species models for groups of similar species have to be used .
in the pan - tropical models , species are often taken partly into account by including wood density ( rho ) in the allometry [ 24 ] , which can be either measured or extracted from the literature or online databases ( e.g. , [ 25 ]) .
the most typical tree parameter used as predictor in agb models is the diameter at breast height ( d ) , because it is easy to measure with high accuracy in the field and , accordingly , it is usually available in the forest inventory databases .
other typically used parameters are total tree height ( h ) , rho and crown diameter .
allometric models based on d only are commonly used , but the importance of including tree height in biomass estimation has been emphasized by several authors [ 24,26 - 29 ] .
the relationships between biomass and tree attributes depend on factors such as site , successional status , ecological zone , forest type and management , but h - d allometry can explain most of this variation [ 17 ] .
therefore , inclusion of h could improve model applicability to different sites [ 26 ] .
recently , chave et al .
[ 24 ] suggested that a single agb model based on d , h and rho holds across tropical vegetation types , regions and environmental factors .
feldpausch et al .
[ 27 ] showed that mean agb of plots located across the tropics was 13 % lower when including h , which implies that carbon storage estimate may be prone to bias if h is ignored .
also the mean error in tree - level biomass estimates was halved when accounting for h. marshall et al .
( 2012 ) found that aboveground carbon was overestimated by 55 mg ha - 1 if h was not included in the allometric model in tanzania , which would cause an overestimation of carbon resource by about 24 % .
furthermore , simulations by molto et al .
[ 20 ] showed that a " 2 - 5 % bias in h predictions can propagate to agb estimations off their own confidence intervals " .
on the other hand , sometimes agb model based on d only is recommended because such model is more parsimonious and applicable to inventory data that has only d measurements ( e.g. , [ 14 ]) .
many authors have also found that inclusion of h to biomass model might only lead to negligible changes in biomass prediction [ 10,12,15,30,31 ] .
therefore , it is still an open question whether the inclusion of h in the allometry actually matters in terms of agb estimation , under what circumstances or conditions , and what are the factors that can lead to relevant changes in the estimation .
measuring h is difficult and expensive , especially in the tropics [ 13 ] .
therefore , to increase the cost - efficiency of the field work , it is a common procedure to measure d and identify species from every tree , but measure h just for a subset of trees , called sample trees [ 32 ] .
the objective would then be to generalize the sample tree h to the rest of the trees , called tally trees .
the h - d model is used for this purpose .
there are numerous studies comparing the functional forms for the h - d relationship .
according to mehtatalo [ 33 ] the most frequently used function forms are the power function [ 34 ] , meyer 's equation [ 35 ] and the korf curve [ 36 ] .
a plethora of basic functional forms have been tested [ 37 - 39 ] , but none of them has been found to be superior .
the h - d relationships vary by tree species and therefore h - d curves should be fitted by species [ 40 - 42 ] .
however , if the number of tree species is high , species - specific modeling is not a viable option .
in that case , information accounting for species variation should be incorporated to the model itself [ 43,44 ] .
chave et al .
[ 24 ] advised that for reliable agb estimations it is required to develop local h - d allometry , by measuring total h on a subsample of the trees stratified by forest type and covering the range of diameters in full .
the reason for this is grounded on the fact that the h - d relationship varies considerably between plots , stands and regions [ 37,45 - 47 ] .
this variation in h - d curves is often taken into account by adjusting plot / stand / region - specific h - d curve parameters .
there are , however , many alternatives to do the localization .
a simple approach is to use either existing h - d model or to fit a local h - d model and then re - scale it so that the measured mean height at wanted level is obtained when the d equals to the measured mean diameter .
alternatively , more complex models can be adjusted by adding covariates known to modify the h - d relationship , such as site index [ 35 ] , stem density [ 48 ] , or other stand - level characteristics such as basal area or dominant height [ 49 ] .
a more advanced statistical approach is to use a linear or non - linear mixed - effects modeling ( nlme ) [ 50 ] .
nlme suits well for the generalization of sample tree information to tally trees because plot based inventory data is collected in a hierarchical manner ( e.g. tree - plot - cluster ) and random ( e.g. plot - cluster ) effects are available while predicting [ 45 ] .
for this reason , mixed - effects modeling was suggested by lappi and bailey [ 51 ] as a method to predict stand development .
the random effects allow taking into account the effect of multiple causal relations in the model [ 49,52 ] or the influence of unknown covariates [ 53 ] affecting the h - d relationship .
they allow for developing models accounting for spatial variability in large - scale modelling [ 43,46,54 ] .
for these reasons , mixed - effects modelling has become a widespread approach to h - d modelling [ 39,49,52,55,56 ] .
in this study , our objective was to examine how sensitive agb estimation in woodlands of the sudanian savanna in burkina faso are to the use of allometry either omitting or including h , and the approach employed for h - d modelling .
more specifically , first , we studied how accurately h can be predicted in a species - rich study site , using a small subset of trees measured for h and several options for non - linear fixed and mixed - effects models .
then , we examined the propagation of the h differences into the agb predictions. with this research we wished to shed some light on whether the h - d modelling approach actually matters with regards to the target outcome : the agb prediction .
we also compared those agb predictions with allometry not including h as predictor , and reflected on plausible alternatives to h - d modelling .
material and methods study area the study site is located in the southern burkina faso in the ziro province ( approx. 11degrees44'n 1degrees56'w ) ( fig 1a ) .
the area belongs to the west sudanian savanna ecoregion [ 57 ] .
according to the worldclim dataset [ 58 ] , the mean annual precipitation is 827 mm in 1950 - 2000 and the mean annual temperature is 27.5degreesc .
the most of the precipitation falls between may and september , the wettest month being august .
the driest months are december , january and february .
mean minimum and maximum temperatures were 24.7degreesc and 38.3degreesc in the warmest month ( april ) and 16.1degreesc and 33.6degreesc in the coldest month ( december ) .
in the koppen - geiger climate classification , the area lies in the transition of arid steppe ( bsh ) and tropical savanna climate types ( aw ) [ 59 ] .
topographically , the study area is relatively flat with a mean elevation of 350 m above sea level .
plinthosols with subsurface accumulation of ironoxides , kaolinitic clay and quartz ( plinthite ) are the dominant soil type [ 60 ] .

the land cover in the study area consists of savanna woodlands with variable densities of tree crown cover , surrounded by settlements and agroforestry parklands , which are typically dominated by single species , like vitellaria paradoxa [ 63 ] .
majority of the forest area is under community forest management and protection ( chantiers d'amenagement forestier , caf ) , a 1986 's participatory program aiming at providing sustainable fuelwood production for the capital ouagadougou which involves the local communities in the practical management of forests [ 64 ] .
furthermore , forests and woodlands are also partly used for livestock grazing [ 64 ] .
fires due to anthropogenic and natural causes take place regularly in the study area and influence the ecology of the vegetation ( e.g. , [ 65 ]) .
field data collection field data consisted of 160 sample plots measured between december 2013 and february 2014 in the framework of building biocarbon and rural development in west africa ( biodev ) .

the sampling design was based on the land degradation surveillance framework ( ldsf ) [ 61,62 ] .
the 10,000 ha ( 10 km x 10 km ) site was stratified into 16 tiles , which were sampled by 100 ha clusters .
each cluster had ten 0.1 ha circular sample plots ( radius 17.84 m ) .
cluster and sample plot centre points were randomly placed ( fig 1b ) .
at each of 0.1 ha plots , diameters were measured at a height of 1.3 m above ground ( d ; cm ) for the stems having d > 10 cm. tree height ( h ; m ) was measured for trees of smallest , median and largest diameter .
furthermore , all the stems having d = 4 - 10 cm were counted at four 0.01 subplots ( radius 5.64 m ) evenly located within each 0.1 - ha plot [ 62 ] , where also d and h were measured and species recorded for the median diameter tree .
diameters were measured using a diameter tape , and heights with a hypsometer ( suunto pm - 5 / 1520 , vantaa , finland ) .
tree species were determined for each stem by a field crew with local expertise .
out of those 160 plots , 152 plots had living trees .
d was measured for a total of 2298 stems , and both d and h for 403 stems .
descriptive statistics for the sample plots are given in table 1 .
a total of 54 tree species were observed , although the ten most common species accounted for 80 % of the stems ( fig 2 ) .
anogeissus leiocarpus and vitellaria paradoxa were the most common tree species ( fig 2 ) .
in the trees sampled for h measurement , there were in total 36 tree species present .

we compared the performance of a large number of model forms available in the literature [ 39 ] using the model comparison tools available in package " lmfor " ( version 1.1 [ 68 ]) .
two - parameter curtis 's function [ 36 ] showed the best fit while conforming to the assumptions of normality , homoscedasticity and lack of trend in the residuals : h ( d )= 1.3 + alphad ( 1 + d ) beta ( 1 ) where 1.3m is the breast height at which diameters were measured and alpha,beta are model parameters .
therefore , the general model can be expressed as : hijk = f ( alpha,beta,xijk )+ eijk,i = 1 ,... , njk,j = 1 ,... , mk,k = 1 ,... , k , ( 2 ) where hijk is the h of a tree i measured within plot j in cluster k , and eijk the model residuals .
f is the non - linear function , eq 1 in this case , ( alpha,beta ) being its parameter vectors .
xijk is a vector of covariates used for predicting h , which was only d in the simplest case .
therefore , the case for the simple fixed - effects h - d model ( m1 ) was defined by : xijk = dijk ( 3 ) alpha = alpha0 beta = beta0 then , we considered the possibility of accounting variability in these parameters due to the presence of 36 different species ( sp ) , which may show a different h - d relation due to physiological differences and interspecific competition within the plant :) no more than plantsaying ?
( and e.ves a greater impression of high species mixture .
() .
a case study ) this whole thing can community .
the species of each h - measured tree ( spijk ) were therefore included in the covariate vector , as well as species - specific parameters ( alphasp,betasp ) .
an additional term for sp was therefore added , obtaining a second fixed - effects h - d model ( m2 ) as : xijk =( dijk,spijk ) ( 4 ) alpha = alpha0 + alphasp beta = beta0 + betasp next , between - plot variability was accounted for by adding plot random effects ( aj,bj ) as an additional term in a mixed - effects model ( m3 ) as : xijk =( dijk,spijk ) ( 5 ) alpha = alpha0 + alphasp + aj beta = beta0 + betasp + bj finally , the last step was to consider the clustered sampling design followed after ldsf [ 62 ] ( fig 1b ) , by using nested levels of grouping for these random effects .
the final mixed - effects model ( m4 ) therefore included two random effects : a first ( outer ) level of grouping for clusters ( bk ') , and a second ( inner ) level for the plots contained within each cluster ( bjk ) : xijk =( dijk,spijk ) ( 6 ) alpha = alpha0 + alphasp + ajk + ak ' beta = beta0 + betasp + bjk + bk ' to summarize , as a result of h - d modelling , we obtained the following h estimations for each tree : m1 : h predicted from model based on d fixed effects ( eqs 2 and 3 ) ; m2 : h predicted from model including d and species as fixed effects ( eqs 2 and 4 ) ; m3 : h predicted from mixed - effects model including d and species as fixed effects and between - plot random effects ( eqs 2 and 5 ) ; and m4 : h predicted from mixed - effects model including d and species as fixed effects and multilevel nested between - cluster and between - plot random effects ( eqs 2 and 6 ) .
accuracy of each model was assessed by computing the bias ( mean difference of predicted and observed values ) and root mean square error ( rmse ) of model residuals , and expressing them in both absolute ( m ) and relative (%) units .
since effects were included as nested additive terms , increasing model complexity , whether the additions incorporated significant portions of explained variance was determined with likelihood ratio ( lr ) tests of their ml fits , using " lmtest " package [ 69 ] .
therefore , in lr tests a chi2 distribution was used to test the null hypothesis , which was the goodness of fit without the additional term ( i.e. , minus log - likelihood of the model of immediately decreasing complexity from m4 to m1 ) .
modelling steps the general modelling setting described in the previous sub - section was subject to diagnose of model assumptions , which shaped the final models presented in results .
according to eq 3 , the simple fixed - effects ( alpha0,beta0 ) model m1 was fitted as : hijk = 1.3 + alpha0dijk ( 1 + dijk ) beta0 + eijk ( 7 ) this model obtained significant estimates for all parameters ( see table 2 in results ) .
the model form chosen achieved a homogeneous distribution of residuals , which was specially challenging for larger trees , rendering other alternatives unreliable .
although m1 was unbiased , it was considered that its precision could be improved by including additive effects from other covariates available .
the first such covariate considered was the effect of species , since in highly mixed - species forest it was likely that some species may significantly differ from the main effects in eq 7 .
our strategy was to selected the species to be added as fixed effects on the grounds of statistical significance , based on two steps : ( i ) incorporating these effect for all species , as a means for selecting the significant ones , and ( ii ) using those selected ones in a final fixed - effects model predicting h from both d and species .
then , after obtaining unreliable intercept estimates when adding species effects in the numerator of the equation ( alphasp ; eq 4 ) , it was decided to incorporate these fixed effects in the exponent of the denominator ( betasp ; eq 4 ) only .
for the first step to select significant species , we added a categorical variable describing all the h - measured species ( spijk ) as fixed effects : hijk = 1.3 + alpha0dijk ( 1 + dijk )( beta0 + betaspspijk )+ eijk ( 8 ) 10.1371 / journal.pone.0158198.t002 table 2 parameter estimates for the models m1 - m4 .

considering significances at the 95 % level , five were the species which obtained a significant estimate for the betasp parameter ( in order of significance ) : anogeissus leiocarpus , burkea africana , combretum molle , prosopis africana and pterocarpus erinaceus .
however , a model including these five species effect as dummy variables violated model assumptions , showing the influence of outliers in residuals , and presented an estimate for p. erinaceus with high standard error .
accordingly , this model was rejected and , by increasing the significance level to 99 % , the number of species was reduced to three : a. leiocarpus , b. africana and c. molle .
therefore , these species were selected and added as dummy variables ( denoted by the first letters of their genus and species : alijk ; baijk ; cmijk ) , resulting in a simpler model m2 : hijk = 1.3 + alpha0dijk ( 1 + dijk )( beta0 + betaalalijk + betababaijk + betacmcmijk )+ eijk ( 9 ) as in other cases , these effects were also initially tested to modify both the intercept ( alpha ) and the slope ( beta ) , however in the end they were only left in the slope due to lack of significance in the intercept .
the next step was to include the plot random effects into a mixed - effects model ( m3 ) .
according to eq 5 , plot random effects ( aj,bj ) were incorporated from eq 13 as : hijk = 1.3 +( alpha0 + aj ) dijk ( 1 + dijk )( beta0 + betaalalijk + betababaijk + betacmcmijk + bj )+ eijk ( 10 ) although , when this model was fitted , the assumptions of independent and identically distributed random effects was not met .
after detecting high correlation between the random effects r ( aj,bj ) = - 0.997 , it was decided to leave the random effects only in the exponent of the denominator ( i.e. aj = 0 ) .
therefore , we obtained a simpler mixed - effects model accounting for plot effects ( m3 ) which was finally used : hijk = 1.3 + alpha0dijk ( 1 + dijk )( beta0 + betaalalijk + betababaijk + betacmcmijk + bj )+ eijk ( 11 ) m3 was only useful in case that at least one height measurement was available for a given plot .
there were , in fact , seven plots out of the total 152 plots containing trees , for which no height measurement was taken .
in order to obtain the final agb estimation based in both d and h ( see next section below ) , the h prediction from m2 was taken for those few plots .
finally , the convenience of using a more complex multilevel mixed - effects ( m4 ) accounting for both between - plots effects ( bjk ) nested within between - clusters effects ( bk ') was also evaluated as : hijk = 1.3 + alpha0dijk ( 1 + dijk )( beta0 + betaalalijk + betababaijk + betacmcmijk + bjk + bk ')+ eijk ( 12 ) as in the previous cases , the inclusion of these effects in both intercept and slope ( eq 6 ) was initially considered but dismissed after observing lack of statistical significance for the intercept .
similar restrictions to the use of m3 apply for m4 as well , and therefore the prediction of h from model m2 had to be taken for the few plots where no tree heights were measured , with the intention of obtaining the corresponding final agb estimation .
computation of aboveground biomass we used pan - tropical allometric models from chave et al .
[ 24 ] for predicting agb .
the models are based on trees ( d from 5 to 212 cm ) harvested from a wide range of tropical climatic conditions and vegetation types ( tropical forests , subtropical forests and woodland savannas ) .
when h is available , the best - fit pan - tropical model for tree agb ( kg ) is ( eq 4 in chave et al .
[ 24 ]) : agb = 0.06773 ( rho.d2.h ) 0.976 ( 13 ) which includes the effect of species - specific wood densities ( rho ; g cm - 1 ) .
in the absence of h , the following alternative model is recommended ( eq 7 in chave et al .
[ 24 ]) : agb = exp [ - 1.803 + 0.976 ( ln ( rho ) - e )+ 2.673ln ( d ) - 0.0299 [ ln ( d )] 2 ] ( 14 ) where e is a dimensionless measure of environmental stress based on temperature seasonality ( ts ) , climatic water deficit ( cwd ) and precipitation seasonality ( ps ) ( eq 6b in chave et al .
[ 24 ]) : e =( 0.178.ts - 0.938.cwd - 6.61.ps ). 10 - 3 ( 15 ) we computed agb for each tree in the 0.1 - ha plots using eq 13 and different h predictions .
agb was also computed for median diameter trees in the 0.01 - ha subplots using the measured h. wood density values rho were derived from nygard and elfving [ 70 ] and online databases [ 25,71 ] .
they were assigned to each tree from the closest taxonomic level available [ 44,72 ] .
97.5 % of stems had rho data available from species level and 100 % from genus level .
averaged rho values were used whenever there were multiple values for a same species .
on the other hand , agb based on d only was computed using eq 8 .
the value of e ( 0.701 ) was extracted from the global gridded dataset ( 2.5 arc sec resolution ) provided by chave et al .
[ 24 ] , and given to the entire study area .
to finalize , in order to compute plot - level agb predictions ( mg ha - 1 ) , we assigned a hectare expansion factor ( hef ) for each stem , according to the size of the plot / subplot where it was measured ( i.e. hef = 10 for 0.1 - ha plots , and hef = 25 for the four 0.01 - ha subplots ) .
as a result of all the above - mentioned options for h - d modelling , we also obtained a similar list of different plot - level agb predictions : b0 : agb obtained from measured d only ( eq 14 ) ; b1 : agb obtained from measured d and predicted h ( eq 13 ) , using m1 model with d fixed effects ( eqs 2 and 3 ) ; b2 : agb obtained from measured d and predicted h ( eq 13 ) , using m2 model with d and species fixed effects ( eqs 2 and 4 ) ; b3 : agb obtained from measured d and predicted h ( eq 13 ) , using m3 model with d , species fixed effects and between - plot random effects ( eqs 2 and 5 ) ; b4 : agb obtained from measured d and predicted h ( eq 13 ) , using m4 model with d , species fixed effects and multilevel nested between - cluster and between - plot random effects ( eqs 2 and 6 ) ; effects of environmental stress factor ( e ) and baseline determination it is worth noting that the agb allometry without h as predictor in eq 14 assumes a pan - tropical h - d model that depends on e ( eq 6a in chave et al .
[ 24 ]) : ln ( h )= 0.893 - e + 0.760ln ( d ) - 0.0340 [ ln ( d )] 2 ( 16 ) in other words , in a hypothetical case of empirical h - d data fitting exactly to this relation , there would be no difference between eqs 13 and 14 for predicting agb .
in the context of the present article , we name this model m0 , as the h - d model that corresponds to the agb predictions obtained by b0 ( for comparison to our own models m1 - m4 , the pan - tropical model has been incorporated to fig 3a , see results ) .
we considered that such hypothetical case could be regarded as a ' baseline ' ( assumed most accurate , in absence of destructive sampling of agb ) to which all other alternatives could be compared .
for that purpose , using our empirical h - d data , we solved e from eq 16 .
the result was an alternative e ' calibrated ' to the specific local conditions defined by the empirical h - d relations measured in the field , which can be applied directly in eq 14 .
the calibration was carried out by including the exponential form of eq 16 in function " nls " [ 66 ] , obtaining the adjusted value for e which best fits to the measured h - d data .
in the context of the present article , these are the baseline model ( m0 *) and its subsequent agb predictions ( b0 *) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0158198.g003 fig 3 model fit plots .
effects were included as nested additive terms , increasing complexity : ( a ) fixed - effects h - d model ; ( b ) adding species fixed effects ; ( c ) adding plot random effects ; and ( d ) adding cluster random effects .
predictions have been omitted from ( a ) , since they are known to follow the fixed - effects model ( solid line ) , so that the species distribution in the training data can be observed more clearly in this plot .
assessing statistical differences among alternatives we were especially interested in detecting whether the choice of method can actually lead to bias in agb estimation , which is a conclusion that can be deducted by simply comparing methods .
in the absence of agb data obtained by destructive sampling which would allow an independent validation of the final agb estimations , we considered that accounting for differences between the modelling approaches can provide an idea on how differences in h - d modelling can propagate to the final agb predictions [ 11,20 ] .
after obtaining all the alternative agb predictions ( b0 - b4 and the baseline b0 *) , we tested whether they were significantly different , or otherwise the agb allometry and h - d modelling approach does not significantly affect the final outcome. with that intention , we computed pair - wise differences ( diff ) between all plausible combinations of the alternatives .
since normality could not be assumed for all groups , the hypothesis that two alternatives were significantly different was tested using paired wilcoxon signed rank tests ( r function " wilcox.test ") .

m1 was accepted as a valid and unbiased h - d model , although its rmse of 25.64 % was deemed quite high ( table 3 ) , and therefore we considered the possibility of including additional effects .
observing the model fit against the training data , it became apparent that some species ( fig 3a ) stand out from the general h - d relation in this forest community .
when individual species were highlighted in residual versus prediction plots , some of those residuals appeared to be highly biased for few individual species ( fig 4 ) .
it therefore seemed to exist an important species effect in the h - d relation ( eq 4 ) , although there was a challenge in defining for which species a modification in the model was actually necessary .
using the two - step approach to determining significant species effects , as detailed in sub - section " modelling steps " , the following species were finally selected for species effects : a. leiocarpus , b. africana and c. molle ( fig 4 ) .
although the significance for the latter one was weak ( table 2 ) , it was accepted as the standard error of its estimate was acceptable .
model m2 ( fig 3b ) explained a substantially higher proportion of variance than m1 , achieving a reduction of the rmse down to 21.78 % ( table 2 ) .
results from the lr test demonstrated the significance of including these additional terms in the model ( table 3 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0158198.g004 fig 4 plot of residuals versus predictions for fixed - effects h - d model ( m1 ) .
species which were found to significantly include additional effects are highlighted .
the next increase in model complexity was the inclusion of plot random effects .
model m3 delivers predictions ( triangular symbols in fig 3c ) that differ from the fixed part of the model ( solid lines in fig 3c ) according to ratios of variances within - plots and between - plots ( sigmabj ) .
m3 was very successful in terms of model fit , since all parameter estimates were significant ( table 2 ) , with residuals from eq 11 showing normality , heteroscedasticity and independence of predictors and random effects , and also lacking dependencies ( correlations ) among random effects ( not the case for eq 10 , which was therefore dismissed ) .
compared to m2 , m3 obtained a considerable increase in the amount of explained variance and lower rmse ( table 2 ) .
lr test demonstrated the significance of incorporating the between - plot variability as random effects into the previous fixed - effects model m2 ( table 3 ) , and it was therefore accepted the inclusion of this additional term ( bj ) .
furthermore , as detailed in eq 12 , a final multilevel mixed - effects ( m4 ) including nested levels for plot and clusters effects , was obtained .
in the case of model m4 , final predictions ( triangular symbols in fig 4c ) depend on ratios of within - groups variances with respect to between - clusters variance ( sigmabk ') and variances between - plots at each cluster ( sigmabjk ) .
diagnosis of the resulting model m4 ( fig 3d ) was positive , although the amount of explained variance was very similar to the other simpler mixed - effects model m3 ( table 2 ) .
a very surprising outcome was to observe a slight increase in the rmse of m4 with respect to m3 .
nonetheless , the lr ratio test between these two models was still significant at a 95 % level ( table 3 ) , and therefore the incorporation of this nested additional random effect between clusters could , in principle , be accepted .
comparison of agb estimates five different plot - level agb predictions ( b0 - b4 ) were obtained , each corresponding to one h - d model alternative ( m0 - m4 ) .
( fig 5a ) compares their box - whisker plots and table 4 includes their summary statistics .
table 4 also presents a matrix of all combinations for pair - wise differences ( diff ) whereas , for simplicity , the box - whisker plots selected for fig 5b only compare differences between options of successively increasing complexity : b0 versus b1 ; b1 versus b2 ; b2 versus b3 ; and b3 versus b4 .
we used actual mg.ha - 1 units to help the reader in reflecting on the practical significance of absolute agb differences .
positive diff values denote underestimation with respect to the simpler option , and negative corresponds to overestimation ( i.e. , diff is rows minus columns in table 4 ) .
medians and interquartile ranges ( iqr ) for diff are reported , because the distribution of some of the differences was extremely asymmetric .
table 4 also includes a matrix of significance results for the wilcoxon signed rank tests for those differences .

taking into account the worst case scenario ( b0 versus b1 or b2 ) , 95 % of differences observed in plot - level predictions were reaching roughly 5.5 mg.ha - 1 at most .
however , agb predictions from eq 8 may be biased , since differences between option b0 and the rest of alternatives were all significantly different than zero ( table 4 ) .
for instance , 82.3 % of b0 - b1 differences were above zero , which showed that using eq 7 makes predictions systematically below those obtained by eq 8 , however with some exceptions .
this was not the case for the rest of contrasts carried out , which were largely non - significant , in spite of the significances found in the final fit of the h - d models ( table 3 ) .
only the inclusion of species effects could be considered to significantly affect the final agb predictions , although only considered under a 90 % level of significance ( p - value = 0.065 ; table 4 ) .
differences in the agb predictions between approaches using fixed - effects or mixed - effects h - d models could be considered negligible , although it may be worth noting the presence of numerous outliers among the plot - level agb differences obtained when the additional term incorporated were the random effects b2 - b3 ( fig 5b ) .
effect of environmental stress factor ( e ) since the agb estimations not using h as predictor in the allometry ( eq 14 ; b0 ) , were notably different from all those including a h - d model , we considered it relevant to further investigate the reasons for what seemed an overestimation in b0 .
in order to investigate the sensitivity of the agb estimations to changes in the e parameter , we employed eq 16 , which tells us the h that on average corresponds each d under the environmental stress conditions defined by a given value of e. in fig 3a , the dashed line depicts that model for the exact case of e = 0.70 applied in this study site ( m0 ) .
fig 6 shows how changing values of e within a range of 0.6 - 0.9 affects the prediction of h from d , and how this propagates to agb predictions at the tree level ( b0 ) .

outliers have been omitted from ( c ) and ( d ) to improve the clarity of figures .
as explained in the sub - section about " assessing statistical differences among alternatives " , we determined baseline agb predictions as those for the value of e which secured the best fit of eq 16 to the empirical h - d data ( m0 *) .
this ' calibrated ' value was found to be e = 0.81 ( table 5 ) , and its subsequent agb predictions ( b0 * ; eq 14 ) were unbiased with respect to those obtained directly from the field h - d measurements , via eq 13 ( fig 6d ) .
the inclusion of the red dashed line within boxplots' notches in fig 6b and 6d , are therefore also an indication of whether they are significantly equal to the measured values , whereas its exclusion from within those notches signify a possibility for bias .
also , to help the reader in reflecting on the absolute agb differences , we incorporated plot - level aggregates of b0 * to table 4 and fig 5a .
moreover , fig 5b also includes b0 * - b1 differences , which can be directly compared to b0 - b1 , showing the effect of calibrating e for obtaining the best fit to eq 16 .
all by - group differences and their significances have also been added to table 4 .
differences between the baseline ( b0 *) and h - d modelling approaches were statistically significant , although significance levels were much lower than those for the approach using d only ( b0 ) .

chave et al .
[ 24 ] recommended to include h as a predictor in agb allometry , and preferably develop locally - fitted h - d models for each study .
the cluster sampling design employed in our field data collection and the high number of species present in the study area led us to an a priori assumption that the correct approach should be a multilevel mixed - effects model designating the hierarchical levels of sampling as random effects , and also including fixed effects accounting for species influence .
however , as detailed in the results for h - d modelling , the development of such a complex model requires some skill in carefully checking that modelling assumptions are met and no critical dependencies are left among random effects , residuals , etc .
[ 50 ] .
on the other hand , mehtatalo et al .
[ 39 ] found no critical differences among h - d modelling approaches , while feldpausch et al .
[ 47 ] recommended to include plot - level random effects in tropical h - d allometric models .
the key question for us was : does the h - d modelling approach actually matter to the final purpose of agb estimation , or could otherwise the simplest option work out a proper prediction for agb ?
multilevel versus single - level random effects considering the final agb estimations , differences between the h - d models including nested multilevel random effects ( b4 ) and the single - level plot random effects ( b3 ) were negligible and probably lacked importance in practice .
differences were only marginal , dispersing narrowly around zero ( fig 5b ) , within an approximate 95 % confidence interval of - 0.002 +/ - 0.50 mg.ha - 1 .
therefore , in spite that the inclusion of nested multilevel random effects was conceptually the most appropriate approach for the sampling design based on ldsf [ 61,62 ] , adding such complexity to the h - d model may not matter much in practice , after all .
furthermore , although the lr tests found the inclusion of cluster - plus - plot random effects significant compared to plot - only ( table 3 ) , the significance level was lower than other contrasts ' .
it was also observed that m4 increased the rmse with respect to m3 , which may be a sign of overfitting for the multilevel h - d model .
in conclusion , since the complexity of the model was increased without substantially improving its precision , we decided that model m3 with single level of grouping for random effects was more convenient in practice .
however , this result may reflect an absence of significant landscape - level differences or gradients influencing the h - d relation at our study area .
this may be the case since , for example , the entire study area shared a same value of environmental stress ( e ) ( sensu chave et al. [ 24 ]) .
the inclusion of multilevel random effect could , however , be relevant in studies following ldsf inventory design over larger areas , or dealing with more heterogeneous landscapes or latitudinal / altitudinal gradients .
mixed - effects versus fixed - effects models mixed - effects models outperformed fixed - effects ones in terms of lr tests and accuracies .
however , the plot random effects ( bj ) are only useful in plots where at least one tree has been measured , providing a calibrated prediction [ 73 ] .
in turn , the advantage is that this same model could be applied on additional field plots from this same study area if acquiring a higher sample size was considered necessary [ 32,46 ] .
although results in h - d modelling suggested the importance of the mixed - effects model m3 with regards to the final plot - level agb estimations ( table 4 ) , we found no substantial differences between the models that included random effects ( b3 - b4 ) and those which did not ( b1 - b2 ) .
this does not mean that agb differences between these approaches are not important , but that they are not systematic .
as mentioned , in the absence of data for external validation , we cannot reflect on the accuracy of each approach , but only study differences in means and infer that they could indicate the presence of bias .
in the light of our results , there are no systematic differences between the agb estimations based on the fixed - effects and mixed - effects models , and therefore omitting the random effects would not lead to bias in the agb estimation for the study area .
this is , however , not an unexpected outcome , since it demonstrates that the random effects are actually random .
nonetheless , fig 5b shows the presence of a large number of outliers in b2 - b3 .
this may mean that the mixed - effects model is mending the prediction for few given plots , which were probably needing it , possibly having characteristics that makes them differ slightly from others , such as soil [ 47 ] , site productivity , or relative stand density [ 22 ] .
differences between b2 - b3 show that agb discrepancies were enclosed within - 0.013 +/ - 1.69 mg.ha - 1 ( table 4 ) .
this suggests that , although the fixed - effects model would by itself lead to an unbiased agb estimation for the entire study area , the mixed - effect models may correct some large errors which may be relevant at some plots , better reflecting the spatial distribution of agb .
the most conservative choice is therefore to use mixed - effects modelling to avoid error at such areas , and therefore b3 is our recommended option among those compared .
h - d modelling with species effect versus d - only the effect of species observed in the h - d model showed that only few species had a slightly different relation than others ( fig 4 ) .
these may be species that dominate the top of the canopy and grow taller for a same d than other species do [ 74 ] .
availability of sufficient sample size for a given species may also critical for finding significant differences in its h - d relation , and therefore the species that were finally found to significantly differ from the others - a. leicocarpus , b. africana and c. molle - also show some of the highest frequencies in the study area ( fig 1 ) .
there was , however , no univocal relation between sample size and significance , since not all species with large sample sizes were found to significantly affect the h - d relation ( 36 species tested ) .
in practice this shows the reliability of the method for identifying significant species effects , but it also means that we cannot statistically assure whether a different h - d relation should apply the rest of species , as probably many more among the non - significant ones do. in turn , since a. leicocarpus , b. africana and c. molle collectively account for almost 40 % of the total number of stems ( fig 1 ) , their effect on the final agb computations is greater .
as a result , not only including the additional term for species was found to be significant for h prediction , but the derived plot - level agb estimation was significantly different ( b1 versus b2 ; table 4 ) .
these differences reached 0.218 +/ - 1.69 mg.ha - 1 , which may be relevant specially if considering that there is an overall bias leading to overestimation if no species information is included .
all these significances found in the species fixed effects showed the importance of accounting for species - wise differences in h - d modelling of highly - mixed tropical forests .
therefore , the effects by species were demonstrably the most relevant we found among those considered .
however the inclusion of random effects , although being systematic and of lesser importance , may also lead to improvements in some given plots .
topics related to the effect of species in allometry and methods dealing with species mixture in agb estimations are of current interest in the research literature [ 22,23,75 ] .
typical approach is to derive separate h - d allometry for each species ( e.g. , [ 39 - 42 ]) , although this may be unpractical in highly mixed forests [ 27 ] .
the alternative is to use pan - tropical models [ 24 ] , in which it is commonly assumed that the effect of species in biomass estimations is implicitly included when considering species - specific rho in the agb allometry ( e.g. , [ 29 ]) .
however , even though rho was included in b1 ( eq 7 ) , we still observed a weak significance in its plot - level differences against the agb predictions of b2 , which made use of the h - d model accounting from species effect ( table 4 ) .
this may indicate a possibility for bias in agb predictions using a pan - tropical agb model if the species effect is not accounted for in the h - d model .
in our study , we were even surprised to find that the fixed species effect was more relevant than the random plot effect , in terms of added explained variance .
accordingly , we suggest to include additional terms accounting for species effects in the h - d models .
in this article , we presented a two - step replicable methodology to tackle with the presence of multiple species in a same study area .
in the first step , species was added as a fixed - effect factor only with the purpose to identify the significant species , which were added as separate dummy variables in the second step and final model .
we suggest that this method can be easily replicable in other highly mixed - species forest areas .
agb allometry using d - only versus d and h the largest differences were found between the agb estimations obtained from the allometry involving only d ( b0 ; eq 8 ) , and those including both as predictors ( b1 - b4 ; eq 7 ) .
results were very significant , with clearly biased differences which reached levels within a 95 % confidence interval of 1.451 +/ - 4.12 mg.ha - 1 ( table 4 ) .
this result was not surprising , since it is convergent with conclusions drawn by chave et al .
[ 11 , 24 ] , that best approach is to derive local h - d allometry for each study .
some readers may think of a plausible fifth alternative to those contrasted in this article : apply a published h - d model and use those h predictions in eq 13 .
it is noteworthy to mention that we also tested h - d models published by feldpausch et al .
[ 27 ] and banin et al .
[ 74 ] , only to observe that such approach would dramatically overestimate h and hence agb for our study area .
the reason is that those models have been fitted in very different kind of forests and conditions than those present at this study site .
the fact that they are unbiased over the extent at which they were adjusted ( pan - tropical , continental or regional ) does not prevent that they can lead to bias if applied locally , like it was for our case .
in contrast , the flexibility provided by the e parameter in chave et al. ' s [ 24 ] models allows modifying the intercept for each case study , allowing locally - unbiased implementation of the model .
sensitivity to the environmental stress parameter we also though that inaccurate assumptions in e may be conditioning the agb predictions using only d , and decided to further investigate their sensitivity to e. the resulting test demonstrated the high sensitivity of the agb predictions to e , and since it affects to the mean h and agb , any uncertainty in e induce bias rather than random errors ( fig 6c ) .
this begged the following question : what value of e would provide correct mean h for our study area ?
then we developed the ' calibrated - e ' approach and its derived agb predictions .
although they were still significantly different than the predictions yielded by h - d modelling , those differences were no longer systematic , serving as a baseline for our study .
the magnitude of change in was higher than 0.1 , which leads to relevant changes in the predictions , since eq 14 is critically sensitive to the value chosen for describing the environmental stress ( fig 6 ) .
in our case , the values of e that would provide correct mean agb can be found from chave et al .
[ 24 ] less than 100 km northward from our study area .
since our study site was not large enough to cover areas with different values for e , we are unable to detect a systematic error of e. however , the overestimation effect in the agb allometry predicting from d only has also been observed by other authors [ 18,20,27 ] , while we found no reports accounting for an underestimation of agb when allometry lacks h as predictor .
there is therefore a possibility that e may be more easily underestimated than overestimated , which needs to be further investigated .
we postulate that there may be a need for including causes for environmental stress other than those included in the current definition of e ( ts , cwd and ps ; eq 9 ) which may induce an increase in the ' real e ' , such as soil conditions and natural or human - induced forest disturbance .
it may also be the case that underestimation is caused by measurement error of the parameters ts , cwd or ps , which should be object of further investigation .
to derive their pan - tropical allometry , chave et al .
[ 24 ] employed data from old - growth and secondary forests , excluding plantations and agroforestry systems .
adding such components , could extend the applicability of their equations in tropical managed forests with high degrees of human intervention .
this would bring an opportunity since perhaps such calibration could be carried out with a lower field effort in h measurements , although that would be only a hypothesis to be corroborated by further research .
results showed that the alternative b0 * , which is very simple in its implementation , can result in agb predictions not systematically differing from those obtained by a separate h - d allometry , and therefore unbiased with respect to them .
this indicates that the only reason for finding significant differences between b0 and b1 was the choice of model form .
it must be recalled that the fixed - effects modelling procedure for calculating b1 also included a comparison of different model forms , selecting the one which best fits to the empirical h - d data .
the comparison is therefore unfair , and there are clear advantages in using a pan - tropical model .
however , it could be suggested that an alternative version for eq 16 which would allow changes in e to modify the slope , and not just the intercept , could yield more flexibility in model form , and perhaps the ' calibrated - e ' approach would be more efficient as well .
conclusions and suggestions for future research in the light of these results , the modelling approach followed in some cases affected the final agb estimation significantly , although differences were also negligible for some of the alternatives considered .
the most important difference found was given by the additive term which accounted for species effect .
therefore , we recommend to include species as fixed effects in future allometry , as a simpler and more practical approach than obtaining models for each species in forests with high degree of mixture .
the presented two - step methodology described for selecting species with significant effects , discriminating them from those that followed the general fixed - effects model , was successful in improving the accuracy of the h prediction , and proved relevant for the subsequent agb estimation .
we therefore suggest its replication in the similar studies .
further research could also test the same approach on agb allometry , addressing the effect of species variation directly .
our final choice was the h - d mixed - effects model ( b3 ) , which accounts for the species but also for the plot random effects reflecting site factors such as soil properties and degree of disturbance .
it should be noted that the practical use that we gave to the mixed - effects modelling would not be , however , applicable to the case of agb modelling .
the reason is that destructive sampling would be needed at every new field plot for calibrating its effect , which would be neither practical nor desirable .
we observed that agb predictions without h were very sensitive to the chosen e , which represents the environmental stress of a given study site .
we postulate that e may be systematically underestimated in forest areas with human intervention , although that extreme cannot be tested with our experimental design .
further research could investigate factors affecting e , considering the possibility of including an additional component for disturbance in eq 15 .
overall , factors most affecting the final agb estimates were , in order of decreasing influence : the choice e ( when using no h - d model ) , species variation , and plot - level variation .
cluster - level variation had lower influence , which may be sign of homogeneity within the given study area .
consequently , we concluded that alternatives rank in this order from the most desirable to the least accurate : ( 1 ) using mixed - effects h - d models accounting for species and plot - level variation ; ( 2 ) using local fixed - effects h - d models ; and ( 3 ) obtaining the agb from d data only .

objective : to evaluate the presentation , management , complications and outcome of intestinal atresia ( ia ) managed at our center over a period of 1 year .
materials and methods : records of patients of ia admitted in our center from january 2015 to december 2015 were retrospectively analyzed .
demographic data , antenatal history , presenting complaints , location ( duodenal , jejunoileal , colonic ) of atresia , surgery performed and peri - operative complications were noted .
results : total 78 cases of ia were included in the analyses .
mean age and weight at the time of presentation was 5.8 days ( range 0 - 50 ) , and 1.9 kg ( range 1.1 - 3.2 ) , respectively .
ia included duodenal atresia [ da ( 32 )] , jejuno - ileal atresia [ jia ( 40 )] , colonic atresia [ ca ( 3 )] and atresia at multiple - location ( sites ) in 3 cases .
ninety percent of patients underwent surgery within 5 to 20 hours of admission .
all cases of da except one underwent kimura 's diamond shaped duodeno - duodenostomy .
one case with perforated duodenal web underwent duodenotomy with excision of web .
seven patients with jia and ca required primary stoma , while rest were managed by excision of dilated proximal segment and primary anastomosis .
complications included anastomotic leak in 5 , proximal perforation in 2 , functional obstruction in 7 , aspiration pneumonitis in 3 , and wound infection in 6 patients .
mean hospital stay for survivors was 11 days .
overall survival was 63 % .
conclusion : late presentation , overcrowding in intensive care unit , septicemia , functional obstruction and anastomotic leak are the causes of poor outcome in our series .
early diagnosis , some modification in surgical technique , use of total parenteral nutrition and adequate investigations for other congenital anomalies may improve the outcome .
intestinal atresia neonatal intestinal obstruction introduction intestinal atresia ( ia ) is one of the most common causes of intestinal obstruction in neonates [ 1 ] .
reported survival rates in most of the series from developed countries are 90 % or more [ 2 - 4 ] .
this has been achieved because of refinements in neonatal intensive care , operative technique , use of total parenteral nutrition ( tpn ) , antenatal diagnosis and neonatal anesthesia [ 5 ] .
however , survival rates in developing countries are still lower ( 58.3 - 71.5 %) [ 4 - 8 ] .
in two reports from india , survival rate of 82 % and 80 % has been reported in series of 46 patients of jejuno - ileal atresia ( jia ) and colonic atresia ( ca ) , and 15 patients of duodenal atresia ( da ) , respectively [ 9,10 ] .
materials and methods records of all patients of neonatal ia treated at our center during one - year period ( january 2015 to december 2015 ) were analyzed .
all patients were admitted in neonatal surgical intensive care unit ( icu ) .
data of demographics , antenatal history , presentation , location and type of ia ( duodenal , jejuno - ileal , colonic ) , and peri - operative complications were collected .
patients of ia with volvulus , complicated meconium ileus and gastroschisis were excluded from our series .
after the presumptive diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical assessment , an upright x - ray abdomen was taken .
decision of surgery was taken on the basis of clinical and radiological assessment .
nasogastric ( ng ) tube was inserted in all patients .
intravenous fluids and antibiotics were started and continued post - operatively .
ng tube was removed after 5th post - operative day when ng aspirate was gastric and less than 15ml / day , and thereafter gradual feeding was started .
follow up was not included in the study .
results total 78 patients ( 45 male , 33 females ) met the inclusion criteria .
mean age and body - weight on presentation were 5.8 days ( range 0 - 50 ) and 1.9 kg ( range 1 - 3 ) , respectively .
twenty percent of patients presented at age of more than one week .
ia included da ( n = 32 ) , jia ( n = 40 ) , ca ( n = 3 ) and atresia at multiple - location ( sites ) in 3 cases .
two of the 32 cases of da had associated esophageal atresia ( ea ) with tracheo - esophageal fistula ( tef ) , and anorectal malformation ( arm ) labeled as triple atresia .
antenatal history of polyhydramnios could be elicited in 6 cases , and only one neonate with da was antenatally diagnosed .
vomiting was the chief presenting complaint in da , while abdominal distension , bilious vomiting , and failure to pass meconium , were the presenting symptoms in jia and ca. double - bubble sign on upright x - ray abdomen was present in cases of da ; while distal gas with double - bubble was seen in patients with perforated duodenal web ( fig.1a ) .
fig.1b shows double - bubble sign with red rubber catheter in upper esophageal pouch in a case of triple atresia .
one case of da had associated gastric perforation ( fig.1c ) .
upper - gi gastrografin contrast study was performed in 4 cases of perforated duodenal web because of diagnostic dilemma due to presence of gas in distal bowel on x - ray .
tripple - bubble sign , and varying degree of dilated bowel loops and multiple air - fluid levels were seen in jia ( fig.2a,b,c ) .
gastrografin enema was performed in two cases of ileal atresia who presented more than 15 days after the birth .
both of them showed unused colon ( fig.2d,e ) .
majority of cases ( 90 %) were operated within 5 to 20 hours of admission .
table 1 shows type of operative procedures performed for different ias , and their outcomes in terms of survival .
total 31 cases of da were operated .
one patient with da expired before intervention .
intra - operative findings include type i atresia in 13 ( 42 %) , type ii in 1 ( 3.2 %) , and type iii in 17 ( 54.8 %) .
among type i da cases , perforated web was found in 3 , and annular pancreas in 5 cases .
operative findings of jia included type i in 8 ( 20 %) , type ii in 3 ( 7.5 %) , type iiia in 18 ( 45 %) , type iiib in 3 ( 7.5 %) and type iv ( multiple jia ) in 8 ( 20 %) .
fig.3 shows intraoperative findings in cases of da and jia at different locations .
ca was present in 3 cases .
two were type i , and 1 had type iii ca. a rare association of gallbladder duplication with ia was found in two cases ; one with type iii da and other with multiple - site ( pyloric , ileal , colonic ) ia. all the operated cases of da were managed by kimura 's diamond shaped duodeno - duodenostomy except one in which duodenotomy and excision of perforated web was done .
one case had associated gastric perforation which was repaired .
one patient with triple atresia died before surgery due to severe pneumonitis .
the other case of triple atresia was subjected to primary repair of ea , kimura 's duodeno - duodenostomy and colostomy .
in jias , dilated proximal bowel ( length ranged from 2 to 20 cm ) was resected and distal patency was checked .
bowel continuity was maintained by end to oblique single layer anastomosis .
in 8 cases of type iv jia ( multiple jia ) , the whole segment of bowel containing atresias was resected .
in 4 of these 8 cases , single anastomosis was performed following bowel resection , while 2 required anastomosis at two different sites to avoid severe shortening of bowel length , and 2 cases of jejunal and distal ileal atresia underwent jejuno - jejunal anastomosis with ileostomy .
three case of ca underwent resection of atretic segment followed by colo - colic anastomosis in one , colostomy in one and covering ileostomy in one patient .
details of 3 patients with multiple - site atresia have been given in table 1 .
among total 77 operated patients , stoma was created primarily in 7 patients ( ileostomy in 6 and colostomy in 1 ) .
six patients needed re - exploration and stoma was created in 3 of these .
post - operative complications , their management and outcome are shown in table 2 .
anastomotic leak occurred in 5 patients ( all jias ) .
three of them were re - operated , stoma was created in two at the site of anastomotic leak and one was re - anastomosed .
two patients with anastomotic leak died of septicemia before intervention .
two patients with da and five with jia had prolonged bile drainage of > 30 ml / day from ng tube for more than 10 days , due to functional intestinal obstruction .
upper - gi contrast study of these patients showed anastomotic patency but persistent dilated loops and air - fluid levels proximal to anastomotic site .
one of them died due to aspiration pneumonitis , and two due to septicemia .
one patient underwent re - exploration , and anastomosis was found patent , with proximal dilated bowel .
resection of 8 cm of dilated bowel and re - anastomosis was done .
remaining three patients were managed conservatively .
proximal perforation occurred in two .
repair of perforation in one , and repair of perforation with ileostomy at the site of previous anastomosis in the other patient was performed .
wound infection occurred in 6 patients , 5 of them managed with dressings , one needed secondary suturing .
mean hospital stay for survivors with da was 11 days ( range 8 - 24 ) and for jia and ca was 11 days ( range 5 - 27 ) .
in our series survival rate was 61 % for da , 65 % for jia and 66.6 % for both colonic and multiple - site atresia .
overall survival was 63 % .

table 1 : type of atresia , management and survival (%) in current study table 2 : management and outcome of complications in current study discussion ia is one of the most common causes of neonatal intestinal obstruction .
regarding etiology of ia , two theories are tandler 's concept of a lack of re - vacuolization of solid cord stage of intestinal development [ 9 ] and louw and barnard theory of late intrauterine mesenteric vascular accident [ 10 ] .
prenatal ultrasonography is more reliable in detection of duodenal atresia than jia or ca. basu and burge reported that 31 % of patients with small bowel atresia could be diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound [ 11 ] .
pre - operative management includes , primary resuscitation , correction of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities .
because of high incidence of cardiac and renal anomalies associated with da , echocardiography and ultrasonography of the abdomen should be performed [ 12 ] .
in a series of 138 cases of da , 38 % cardiac anomalies , 14 % renal anomalies , 6 % ea with tef , and 5 % imperforated anus were noted [ 5 ] .
in current series ea with tef and imperforate anus was found in 2 ( 6 %) patients of da , and no investigations were performed for detection of cardiac and renal anomalies .
two cases of gallbladder duplication , one with da and other with combined pyloric , ileal and colonic atresia , were noted in current series .
gallbladder duplication with ia is an extremely rare association .
only three such cases have been reported in literature [ 13 ] .
two of these cases are the part of current series .
surgical procedure should be individualized according to location and type of atresia , degree of dilatation of proximal segment and pre - operative condition of the patient .
most common procedure performed for da is kimura 's diamond shaped duodeno - duodenostomy .
in type i da , duodenotomy with excision of web is an option which is performed less commonly due to chances of damage to ampulla of vater .
intra - operatively compression of gallbladder with release of bile may help in identification of ampulla [ 5 ] .
duodeno - jejunostomy is another option in difficult cases , because of patient anatomy particularly in small and premature children .
in current series only one case was managed with duodenotomy and web excision .
anti - mesenteric tapering duodenoplasty is advised as a useful technique in managing duodenal motility disorder related to mega - duodenum [ 14 ] .
surgical procedure for jia should be based on site and type of atresia , proximal segment dilatation , length of remaining bowel and pre - operative general condition of patient .
to avoid functional obstruction and abnormal motility in retained proximal bowel , dilated segment can be excised up to ligament of treitz .
some reports suggest that resection of dilated proximal bowel should be minimized , as tpn can take care of the period of dysmotility and impaired anastomotic function [ 15 ] .
however preservation of as much bowel length as possible at the risk of creating a poorly functioning anastomosis can produce significant morbidity and mortality [ 16,17 ] .
in instances of short bowel length , proximal tapering enteroplasty or intestinal plication has been proposed as an alternative , in an effort to preserve bowel length [ 18 - 21 ] .
in current series , limited ( 2 to 20 cm ) resection of proximal bowel was done .
tapering enteroplasty was not done in any case .
stoma should be avoided in patient with ia because it increases the morbidity and mortality .
indications to create stoma in our series were either presence of sepsis and severe peritonitis , poor general condition or gross discrepancy between the caliber of proximal and distal bowel segments in cases of distal ileal and colonic atresia .
in current study peri - operative mortality is almost same for da and jia .
outcome of ia is still not satisfactory in developing countries [ 6,7,22 ] .
difference in outcome in developed and developing countries is not because of surgical techniques , rather because of advancement in the following : 1 ) availability of good primary health care with early referral and proper transportation system , 2 ) availability of neonatal surgeons , 3 ) parallel growth of neonatal anesthesia , 4 ) development and availability of sophisticated medical devices , 5 ) availability of neonatal ventilators and respiratory support system , 6 ) tpn , 7 ) neonatal icu with trained personnel [ 23 ] .
in developing countries , delay in diagnosis , late presentation to tertiary center , poor primary health care infrastructure and transportation system , lack of equipped neonatal icu with trained personnel , overcrowding leading to cross infection and septicemia , and unavailability of tpn , are the primary reasons for high mortality rates .
early diagnosis reduces pre - operative metabolic derangements and facilitates appropriate and rapid surgical treatment , which positively impacts the rate of survival [ 24,25 ] .
pre - operative resuscitation , adequate correction of hypovolemia , third space loss and electrolyte imbalance in neonates undergoing major gi surgery is invaluable for the outcome of surgery [ 26 ] .
cardiac anomalies are more commonly associated with da than jia and are one of the major obstacles to successful outcome in case of da [ 5 ] .
conclusion survival of neonates with ia is still poor in such a high volume tertiary care center in india ( developing country ) .
poorer outcome in current series may be due to delayed presentation , high patients load , overcrowding in the icu and septicemia .
functional obstruction and anastomotic leaks are the major surgical complications .
some modifications in surgical techniques such as tapering enteroplasty , use of tpn , and adequate investigations for congenital cardiac anomalies , may improve the outcome .

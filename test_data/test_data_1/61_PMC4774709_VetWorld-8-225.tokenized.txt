background and aim : in today era , broiler industry facing a problem of price hiking of feed of broiler , also in competitive era there should be lower feed cost , lower feed conversion ratio , low feed consumption yet good body weight at marketable age .
materials and methods : day - old commercial broiler chicks ( n = 200 ) were distributed randomly into 5 dietary treatment groups viz .
control ( t1 ) , probiotic in the feed @ 100 g / tonne of feed ( t2 ) , prebiotic in the feed @ 500 g / tonne of feed ( t3 ) , probiotic + prebiotic @ 100 g / tonne and 500 g / tonne of feed , respectively ( t4 ) and probiotic + prebiotic @ 50 g / tonne and 250 g / tonne of feed ( t5 ) .
the growth of broilers and dressing weight along with the weight of giblet ( liver without gall bladder , gizzard without serous layer , and heart without pericardium ) , kidney , abdominal fat , length of intestine and dressing percentage were measured .
economics in terms of return over feed cost ( rofc ) and european performance efficiency index ( epei ) was calculated .
results : among all carcass traits , dressing percentage , abdominal fat weight and abdominal fat percentage ( as a percentage of dressed weight ) were recorded significant ( p < 0.05 ) difference among different treatment groups .
the income from selling of the birds was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher in all treatment groups than the control group but there was a non - significant difference between supplemented groups .
feed cost during whole experimental period was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) lower in synbiotic supplemented groups ( t4 and t5 ) than other groups .
rofc of all treatment group found significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher than the control group .
conclusion : it can be concluded that the diet supplemented with synbiotic ( 100 % level ) was most efficient in terms of epei and synbiotic ( 50 % level ) in terms of rofc .
hence , as feed supplement , synbiotic has a beneficial effect over probiotic and prebiotic when used alone .
broiler carcass traits european performance efficiency index prebiotic probiotic return over feed cost symbiotic introduction poultry is one of the fastest growing segments among the component of livestock sector in india .
production of agricultural crops has been growing at a rate of 1.5 - 2.0 % per annum while poultry industry is growing at 8 - 15 % per annum in india .
the organized sector of the poultry is contributing nearly 70 % of the total output and the rest 30 % by the unorganized sector .
about 66.7 % of the total output from poultry is realized from the poultry meat sector and only 33.3 % from egg production .
the total poultry population , which was only 73.5 million in 1951 has made tremendous growth during the past 50 years and has reached 648.83 million as per 2007 census .
india occupied the 3rd position in egg production and 5th position in poultry meat production as per 2010 census in the world .
the per capita availability of poultry meat is 2.15 kg / annum , which is very less as against the recommendation of 11 kg meat / annum given by national institute of nutrition [ 1 ] .
feed as a major input item to broiler rearing for being 75 % of the production cost has a vital role in broiler economics .
hence , it is imperative to give due attention to proper utilization of feed without adversely affecting the growth or production performance of broilers [ 2 ] .
antibiotics have been also used to promote growth rate , improve feed conversion ratio ( fcr ) and reduce mortality in broiler flocks .
however , repeated use of antibiotics in poultry diets resulted in severe problems like resistance of pathogen to antibiotics , accumulation of antibiotics residue in their products and environment , imbalance of normal microflora and reduction in beneficial intestinal microflora [ 3,4 ] .
this has led to the development of different products to be used as feed additives such as enzymes , probiotics , prebiotics , organic acids , and plant extracts .
probiotics are " live microorganisms , which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host " [ 5 ] .
whereas prebiotics are defined as non - digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and activity of one or a limited number of bacteria .
synbiotics refer to nutritional supplements combining probiotics and prebiotics and in a form of synergism .
the main reason , for using a synbiotic , is that a true probiotic , without its prebiotic food , does not survive well in the digestive system .
without the necessary food source for the probiotic , it will have a greater intolerance for oxygen , low ph , and temperature [ 6 ] .
poultry meat production has been paid more and more attention because it is particularly high in quantities and qualities of valuable protein , essential amino acids , fat , essential fatty acids , vitamins and minerals .
poultry meat is a high quality concentrated food and , therefore , plays an important role in human nutrition [ 7 ] .
poultry meat constitutes around 20 % of total meat production in the country [ 8 ] .
materials and methods ethical approval the present study was carried out at the age of 42 days / 6 week and carcass parameters were carried out at chicken shop with due care after selling of the birds .
experimental design a 200 - day - old commercial broiler chicks were randomly distributed into five different treatment groups having four replicates in each treatment with 10 chicks in each replicate and they were reared under battery brooder system of cage up to 42 days of age .
experimental procedure feed and water were offered ad libitum , and standard managemental practices followed .
chicks were weighed individually at the start of the experiment and at the end of every week .
mortality was also recorded .
composition of dietary treatments is given in table - 1 .
proportion of different feed ingredient is shown in table - 2 and detailed composition of feed additives is shown in table - 2.1 first group of birds were kept as a control , and they were not supplied feed with either probiotic or prebiotic in both , broiler starter and broiler finisher feed .
probiotic in the feed of t2 group was given at the rate of 100 g / tonne of feed during the starter phase ( 0 - 4 weeks ) and finisher phase ( 5 - 6 weeks ) .
prebiotic in the feed of t3 group was given at the rate of 500 g / tonne of feed during the starter phase and finisher phase .
in t4 group , probiotic was given at the rate of 100 g / tonne of feed and prebiotic was given at the rate of 500 g / tonne of feed during the starter phase and finisher phase .
whereas , in t5 group , probiotic was given at the rate of 50 g / tonne of feed and prebiotic was given at the rate of 250 g / tonne of feed during starter phase and finisher phase i.e. half of the dose than t4 treatment .
each gram of probiotic contains 6 x 109 colony forming units of lactobacillus acidophilus , lactobacillus casei , pediococcus acidilactici , bacillus subtilis and saccharomyces boulardii .
whereas , prebiotic contains mannan oligo - saccharide in which mannan 12 - 14 % and glucan 13 - 16 % were included .
the broiler starter ( 0 - 28 days ) and broiler finisher ( 29 - 42 days ) feeds for different treatments were prepared as per the guidelines of bis ( 1992 ) .
return over feed cost ( rofc ) is calculated by subtracting the feed cost during the rearing period from the income from the sold bird on live weight basis .
whereas european performance efficiency index ( epei ) ( european performance efficiency index ) , as described by [ 9 ] , was calculated by following formula .

all supplemented groups were having significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher epei value than the control .
there was a non - significant difference between t2 , t3 , t5 and t2 , t3 , t4 .
the higher epei value means higher average body weight ; good livability and higher feed efficiency in stipulated number of days thus give overall economics of the birds considering various important traits .
hence , t4 group ( synbiotic ) found more economical than other group when epei considered .

conclusion dressing percentage was highest in synbiotic ( 50 % level ) group ( t5 ) over other supplemented groups and differed significantly with control in spite of having lowest pre - slaughter weight .
the rofc ( rs. ) was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher in the synbiotic group ( t4 and t5 ) than other groups .
also , rofc in terms of per cent per bird was highest in synbiotic ( 50 % level ) group ( t5 ) than all other groups .
epei was highest in symbiotic ( 100 %) group ( t4 ) over other group which means higher average body weight ; good livability and higher feed efficiency in stipulated number of days by the group .
overall it can be concluded that the diet supplemented with synbiotic ( 100 % level ) was most efficient in terms of epei and synbiotic ( 50 % level ) in terms of rofc .
hence , as feed supplement , synbiotic has a beneficial effect over probiotic and prebiotic when used alone .

many host cellular signaling pathways were activated and exploited by virus infection for more efficient replication .
the pi3k / akt pathway has recently attracted considerable interest due to its role in regulating virus replication .
this study demonstrated for the first time that the mammalian reovirus strains masked palm civet / china / 2004 ( mpc / 04 ) and bat / china / 2003 ( b / 03 ) can induce transient activation of the pi3k / akt pathway early in infection in vitro .
when uv - treated , both viruses activated pi3k / akt signaling , indicating that the virus / receptor interaction was sufficient to activate pi3k / akt .
reovirus virions can use both clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis , but only chlorpromazine , a specific inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , or sirna targeting clathrin suppressed akt phosphorylation .
we also identified the upstream molecules of the pi3k pathway .
virus infection induced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) but not gab1 , and blockage of fak phosphorylation suppressed akt phosphorylation .
blockage of pi3k / akt activation increased virus rna synthesis and viral yield .
we also found that reovirus infection activated the ifn - stimulated response element ( isre ) in an interferon - independent manner and up - regulated ifn - stimulated genes ( isgs ) via the pi3k / akt / emsy pathway .
suppression of pi3k / akt activation impaired the induction of isre and down - regulated the expression of isgs .
overexpression of isg15 and viperin inhibited virus replication , and knockdown of either enhanced virus replication .
collectively , these results demonstrate that pi3k / akt activated by mammalian reovirus serves as a pathway for sensing and then inhibiting virus replication / infection .
reovirus pi3k / akt endocytosis enhancing viral replication introduction reovirus belongs to the family reoviridae and is a non - enveloped , double - stranded rna virus .
they can be isolated from a broad range of avian , mammalian and reptilian hosts ( rosen et al. , 1960 ; jackson and muldoon , 1973 ; fields et al. , 2001 ) .
the mammalian orthoreoviruses ( mrv ) firstly isolated from humans in 1951 commonly infects humans , but is pathogenic only in children ( tyler et al. , 2004 ) .
reovirus infection is widespread and 50 - 100 % of adults show seropositivity ( twigger et al. , 2012 ) .
most infections result in only mild illness or are asymptomatic .
despite its lack of pathogenicity in humans , recent studies have demonstrated that infection of reoviruses spilled over from wild animals can lead to acute and severe clinical disease in humans ( chua et al. , 2007 , 2008 , 2011 ; cheng et al. , 2009 ) .
these recent discoveries have raised concern about future zoonotic reovirus infections in humans and the need for understanding of reovirus pathogenicity in humans .
reovirus infection is initiated by interactions between the attachment protein sigma1 , a cell - surface carbohydrate , and junctional adhesion molecule a ( jam - a ; barton et al. , 2001 ) .
next , beta1 - integrin interacts with the reovirus lambda2 protein , which contains both rgd and kge integrin - binding motifs ( maginnis et al. , 2006 , 2008 ) , leading to reovirus internalization .
reovirus virions can use both clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytic pathways during cell entry ( schulz et al. , 2012 ) .
it is unknown which host signaling pathways are activated during recognition and endocytosis to provided a favorable cellular environment for viral needs .
the pi3k / akt signaling pathway is involved in multi - cellular processes such as glucose metabolism , protein synthesis , and proliferation .
in addition , the pi3k / akt pathway appears to be associated with the host cell immune response to counteract viral infection ( diehl and schaal , 2013 ) .
activation of this pathway contributes to the induction of a set of interferon - stimulated genes ( isgs ) through the regulation of the transcriptional repressor emsy ( ezell and tsichlis , 2012 ; ezell et al. , 2012 ) .
nevertheless , a large number of viruses rely on activation of the pathway for their replication .
for certain viruses , the pi3k / akt pathway has been shown to be required not only for viral cell entry but also for subsequent intracellular trafficking and viral replication ( cooray , 2004 ) .
infection with mature vaccinia virus triggers pi3k / akt signaling , and blocking p13k activation can reduce viral entry in an beta1 - integrin - dependent manner , suggesting that beta1 integrin - mediated pi3k / akt activation is induced by vaccinia virus ( izmailyan et al. , 2012 ) .
inhibition of pi3k signaling decreases hiv infection after viral entry and reverse transcription but prior to hiv gene expression ( francois and klotman , 2003 ) .
activation of the pi3k / akt pathway plays an important role in regulating vesicular trafficking and cellular entry of the zaire ebola virus ( saeed et al. , 2008 ) .
the internalization of adenovirus relies on the pi3k - mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( li et al. , 1998 ) .
parainfluenza virus 5 ( piv5 ) and avian leukosis virus ( alv ) utilize the pi3k / akt pathway to enhance synthesis of viral rnas ( sun et al. , 2008 ; feng et al. , 2011 ) .
activation of the pi3k / akt pathway by the influenza virus regulates an early step during viral entry , which impairs dimerization of irf - 3 and reduces irf - 3 - dependent promoter activity , thus causing the loss or reduction of host antiviral activity ( ehrhardt et al. , 2006 ) .
to our knowledge , there has been no study conducted on the relationship between pi3k / akt signaling pathway and reovirus infection .
here , we report our investigation into the role of pi3k / akt during reovirus infection in vitro .
our results showed that akt was phosphorylated early during infection with two different reovirus strains in a pi3k - dependent manner .
reovirus virions can use both clathrin - and caveolae - mediated endocytosis , but only the blockage of clathrin - mediated endocytosis suppressed akt phosphorylation .
we also found that activation of pi3k / akt depended on the focal adhesion kinase ( fak ) phosphorylation and not on the receptor tyrosine kinase ( rtk ) pathway .
inhibition of pi3k activation enhanced reovirus replication by repressing isg expression , and isg15 and viperin played important roles in inhibiting reovirus replication .

results isolation and preliminary characterization of two new mammalian reoviruses after the outbreaks of sever acute respiratory syndrome ( sars ) in 2002 - 2003 , epidemiological and pathogen discovery investigation indicated that masked palm civets and bats were most likely the amplifying reservoir hosts for the sars coronavirus respectively ( kan et al. , 2005 ; wang et al. , 2005 ; ge et al. , 2013 ) .
since then , other viruses have also been detected or isolated from these two animal groups , including reoviruses ( du et al. , 2010 ; lelli et al. , 2013 ) .
the two new mammalian reoviruses used in this study were isolated from bats in 2003 ( b / 03 ) and civets in 2004 ( mpc / 04 ) , respectively .
both were isolated from apparently healthy animals in a surveillance study after the outbreak of sars .
phylogenetic analysis based on the s1 gene revealed that the b / 03 strain belonged to serotype i and that the mpc / 04 strain belonged to serotype iii ( figure 1 ) .
this molecular grouping was further confirmed serologically by hi testing ( data not shown ) .

the scale bar represents the nucleotide substitutions per site .
the numbers above and below the branches indicate bootstrap values .
bootstrap support values > 70 are shown ( 1000 replicates ) .
* ( b / 03 ) and ^ ( mpc / 04 ) indicate the two viruses characterized in this study .
infection with b / 03 and mpc / 04 reoviruses transiently activates akt in a pi3k - dependent manner because of the biological importance of the pi3k / akt pathway in viral infection , we investigated whether b / 03 and mpc / 04 infections lead to activation of this pathway .
in contrast to mock - treated cells , infection with both viruses resulted in a rapid increase in akt phosphorylation within 5 - 15 min post - infection ( p.i. ) , a subsequent decline by 30 min p.i. and a return to background levels by 6 h p.i .
( figure 2a ) .
akt phosphorylation in mpc / 04 - infected cells began after approximately 5 min , which was faster than the time required ( approximately 15 min ) in b / 03 - infected cells ( figure 2a ) .
moreover , akt phosphorylation in mpc / 04 - infected cells at each time point reached higher levels than in b / 03 - infected cells ( figure 2b ) .
similar results were obtained in 293t cells ( figure 2c ) and vero cells ( figure 2d ) .
to eliminate any secreted factors that could possibly have triggered production of phosphorylated akt ( p - akt ) , viral stocks were filtered and pelleted by centrifugation , and they were then resuspended and inoculated into cells .
as shown in figure 2e , both viral filtrate and pellet from viral stocks triggered p - akt at 30 min p.i. in contrast , no signal was detected in cellular extraction from l929 cells inoculated with supernatant after centrifugation .
to demonstrate further that akt phosphorylation depended on viral infection , both viruses were exposed to shortwave ( 254 nm ) uv light treatment , and virus inactivation was verified by plaque assay .
when inactivated viruses were inoculated into a549 cells , phosphorylation of akt was still detected ( figure 2f ) .
these results demonstrated that mpc / 04 and b / 03 reovirus particles were sufficient to activate akt in the early stage of cell infection .
figure 2 determination of akt phosphorylation in a549 cells .
serum - starved a549 cells ( a ) , 293t cells ( c ) and vero cells ( d ) were infected with live mpc / 04 and b / 03 at a moi of 5 .
the lysates from reovirus - infected cells were harvested at the indicated time points .
( e ) viral stocks were filtered and pelleted .
the viral stock , filtrate , pellet and supernatant were used to infect a549 cells .
at 30 min p.i. , cell lysates were harvested .
( f ) serum - starved a549 cells were infected with uv - inactivated mpc / 04 and b / 03 .
the lysates from reovirus - infected cells were harvested at the indicated time points .
( h ) serum - starved a549 cells were infected with t1l and t3d at a moi of 5 .
in all assays , phosphorylated akt ( ser473 ) was detected by western blotting .
equal protein loading was verified using total akt and gapdh on the same membranes .
( b,h ) quantification of relative p - akt band intensities to akt in ( a ) and ( g ) .
the results were confirmed in three independent experiments .
to analyze whether the infection with t1l and t3d leads to different results than those from b / 03 and mpc / 04 , the levels of p - akt in a549 cells were determined .
as shown in figure 2g , akt phosphorylation was detected in the cells infected with both viruses from 5 min to 1 h p.i. , and the levels of p - akt in t3d - infected cells were higher than those in t1l - infected cells ( figure 2h ) .
to determine whether akt phosphorylation was pi3k - dependent , the role of pi3k in akt phosphorylation following reovirus infection was investigated using the specific pi3k inhibitors , ly294002 ( ly ) and wortmannin ( wort ) , or sirna targeting the pi3k p85alpha subunit .
as expected , pretreatment with ly ( 50 mum ) or wort ( 0.1 mum ) completely inhibited reovirus infection - induced akt phosphorylation ( figures 3a - d ) .
knockdown of p85alpha reduced the level of p - akt at 30 min p.i .
( figures 3e - h ) , indicating that the activation of akt induced by reovirus infection depended on pi3k .
figure 3 role of pi3k in akt phosphorylation .
serum - starved a549 cells were pre - incubated with ly294002 ( ly ; 10 - 50 mum ) , wortmannin ( wort ; 100 nm - 1 mum ) or dmso ( 0.4 % , v / v ) for 1 h and subsequently infected with mpc / 04 ( a,b ) or b / 03 ( c,d ) at a moi of 5 .
a mock - infected lane was included in each panel as a negative control .
( e,g ) a549 cells were transfected with 15 pmol / well negative control ( negative sirna ) or p85alpha sirna .
24 h after transfection , cells were infected with mpc / 04 ( e ) or b / 03 ( g ) at a moi of 5 .
cell lysates were collected at 30 min p.i. and separated by sds - page .
in all assays , phosphorylated akt ( ser473 ) was detected by western blotting .
equal protein loading was verified using total akt and gapdh on the same membranes .
the levels of p85alpha were determined by western blot analysis using an anti - p85alpha antibody .
( f,h ) quantification of relative p - akt band intensities to akt in ( e ) and ( g ) .
the results were confirmed in three independent experiments .
activation of pi3k / akt is associated with clathrin - mediated endocytosis because akt phosphorylation occurs within 5 - 15 min p.i. , it is possible that cellular endocytosis play key roles in the activation of pi3k / akt .
thus , we examined whether pi3k / akt activation depends on cellular endocytosis .
chlorpromazine ( chl ) , an inhibitor of clathrin - mediated endocytosis , completely suppressed akt phosphorylation at a concentration of 10 - 50 mum ( figures 4a,b ) and inhibited reovirus rna production ( figure 4i ) .
genistein ( gen ) , an inhibitor of caveolar endocytosis , did not decrease the levels of p - akt ( figures 4c,d ) at a concentration of 300 mum , but it did inhibit the caveolar pathway and reovirus replication in a549 cells at 200 mum ( figure 4i ) .
to confirm that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is required for the induction of pi3k / akt , cells were transfected with sirna targeting clathrin .
knockdown of clathrin reduced the levels of p - akt ( figures 4e - h ) and reduced reovirus rna production ( figure 4i ) .
figure 4 role of clathrin - mediated endocytosis in the activation of pi3k / akt early in infection .
serum - starved a549 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of chlorpromazine ( chl ; 5 - 50 mum ) and genistein ( gen ; 50 - 300 mum ) for 30 min , and the cells were then infected with mpc / 04 ( a,c ) and b / 03 ( b,d ) at a moi of 5 .

error bars indicate sd. activation of pi3k / akt depends on fak phosphorylation fak is upstream of pi3k / akt in the beta1 - integrin pathway ( xia et al. , 2004 ) .
blocking fak by pharmacologic inhibition or by dominant negative fak attenuates phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of pi3k and akt ( xia et al. , 2004 ) .
grb2 - associated binder 1 ( gab1 ) is an adapter protein , and it can bind to growth factor receptor - binding protein 2 ( grb2 ) .
both gab1 and grb2 act downstream of rtk ( nishida and hirano , 2003 ) .
phosphorylated gab1 interacts with grb2 , shp2 and the p85 subunit of pi3k ( nishida and hirano , 2003 ) .
first , we examined the phosphorylation of fak and gab1 in reovirus infection .
at 30 min p.i. , infection with either b / 03 or mpc / 04 led to phosphorylation of akt and fak but not gab1 ( figure 5a ) .
pp2 , a selective src - kinase family inhibitor that blocks integrin - induced fak phosphorylation ( xia et al. , 2004 ) , abolished the phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 of fak and serine 473 of akt with both b / 03 and mpc / 04 infection ( figures 5b,c ) .
in contrast , pp3 , an inactive analog of pp2 , had no effect on fak or akt phosphorylation ( figures 5b,c ) .
to eliminate the potential non - specificity issue caused by pharmacological inhibitors , we knocked down the expression of fak by sirna and found that p - akt levels were reduced ( figures 5d,e ) .
furthermore , when cells were transfected with the dominant negative fak ( fad - dn ) plasmid , phosphorylation of fak and akt was blocked in response to infection of both viruses ( figures 5f,g ) .
these results suggested that the activation of pi3k / akt signaling was mediated by fak during b / 03 or mpc / 04 infection .

pi3k / akt pathway regulates viral replication our previous study showed that activated pi3k / akt was required for reovirus mpc / 04 replication ( zhang et al. , 2015 ) .
to investigate whether pi3k / akt signaling was involved in both mpc / 04 and b / 03 infection , both viral rna transcription and viral titers were measured after pi3k inhibition .
the real - time rt - pcr results showed that pretreatment with ly294002 significantly increased mpc / 04 rna synthesis at a concentration of 50 mum ( p < 0.05 ) and b / 03 rna synthesis at a concentration of 25 mum ( p < 0.05 ; figure 6a ) .
pretreatment with wortmannin at all tested concentrations led to a 3 - to 5 - fold increase ( p < 0.05 ) in mpc / 04 rna and a 1 - to 4 - fold increase ( p < 0.05 ) in b / 03 rna ( figure 6a ) .
the viral titer results were in accordance with the results for rna ( figure 6b ) .
the growth of mpc / 04 and b / 03 in a549 cells pretreated with ly294002 ( 50 mum ) increased 5.5 - and 5 - fold , respectively ( p < 0.05 ; figure 6b left ) , and wortmannin ( 1 mum ) pretreatment led to increases of 7 - and 4.4 - fold , respectively ( p < 0.05 ; figure 6b right ) .
figure 6 modulation of reovirus replication by the pi3k / akt pathway .
serum - starved a549 cells were pre - incubated with increasing concentrations of ly294002 , wortmannin or dmso for 1 h , and they were then infected with mpc / 04 and b / 03 at a moi of 5 in the presence of each drug for 24 h. the total rna of the cells was prepared , and s4 gene expression was analyzed by qpcr ( a ) .
cells and cell supernatants were harvested together , and subjected to a single freeze / thaw step for analysis of viral titers ( b ) .
expression of akt1 was determined by qpcr analysis and western blot analysis using akt1 - and gapdh - specific antibodies ( c ) .
effect of inhibition of akt1 expression on virus replication was also evaluated by plaque sizes in a549 cells ( d ) .
a549 cells were transfected with 4 mug / well of shakt or shctrl for 24 h , and the cells were then infected with mpc / 04 and b / 03 .
after 1 h incubation , the monolayers were covered with 2 ml of 1 % bacto agar and 2 x mem containing 10 mug / ml tlck - treated alpha - cht .
plaques were photographed 4 days later .
( e ) a549 cells were transfected with 2 mug / well of shakt or shctrl for 12 h , and the cells were then infected with mpc / 04 or b / 03 at a moi of 5 .
cell supernatants were harvested at the indicated time point and titrated on l929 cells for the plaque assay .

* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.001 .
error bars indicate sd. to further confirm these results , rna interference ( rnai ) technology was employed to specifically reduce the expression of akt1 .
inhibition of akt1 expression in a549 cells was confirmed by both qpcr and western blot analyses ( figure 6c ) .
a549 cells were transfected with shrna control ( shctrl ) and akt shrna ( shakt ) constructs .
after infection with mpc / 04 and b / 03 , the plaques for a549 - shctrl and a549 - shakt were analyzed .
as shown in figure 6d , the plaques in infected a549 - shakt cells were larger than the plaques in a549 - shctrl cells .
the growth of mpc / 04 and b / 03 in cells transfected with shakt was compared with that in mock - transfected cells ( figure 6e ) .
the results showed that knockdown of akt promoted the replication of both viruses at 72 and 96 h p.i .
pi3k / akt inhibits viral replication via increasing ifn - stimulated genes expression to explore the mechanism of pi3k / akt regulation of reovirus replication , we analyzed the role of apoptosis and interferon in reovirus replication .
akt promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis via phosphorylating and inactivating multiple targets , including bad ( 7 ) , forkhead transcription factors ( 8 ) , c - raf ( 9 ) and caspase - 9 ( cardone et al. , 1998 ; bonni et al. , 1999 ; zimmermann and moelling , 1999 ) .
suppression of akt activation should promote cell death and may increase the release of virus particles .
treatment with trail did not affect reovirus replication in a549 cells ( data not shown ) .
the levels of interferon production in infected cells were analyzed .
mpc / 04 infection did not significantly increase the production of ifn - beta ( figure 7a ) .
b / 03 infection increased the production of ifn - beta only at 6 h p.i .
( figure 7a ) , but this increase did not occur at the other time points ( figure 7a ) .
however , activation of the ifn - stimulated response element ( isre ) was detected during infection of both viruses ( figure 7b ) .
to rule out the effect of endogenous interferons , activation of the isre was examined in a549 cells treated with anti - type i and iii receptors antibodies before reovirus infection .
both viruses triggered the isre ( figure 7c ) , and downregulation of akt by rnai nearly abolished activation of the isre ( figure 7c ) .
the plaque assays in vero cells revealed that knockdown of akt formed larger plaques than mock - transfected cells ( figure 7d ) , suggesting that suppression of akt increases the cytopathic effect of both reoviruses .
these results demonstrated that reovirus infection - mediated induction of isre was independent of ifn production .

error bars indicate sd. it has been shown that the activated pi3k / akt - dependent pathway contributes to the induction of a set of isgs through the regulation of the emsy transcriptional repressor ( ezell and tsichlis , 2012 ; ezell et al. , 2012 ) .
our data ( figure 7e ) demonstrated that infection of mpc / 04 or b / 03 also resulted in the phosphorylation of emsy , and ly294002 ( 50 mum ) treatment inhibited the phosphorylation .
overexpression of emsy repressed the induction of isre ( data not shown ) and promoted viral replication ( figure 7f ) , and downregulation of emsy by rnai promoted the induction of isre ( data not shown ) and inhibited viral replication ( figure 7f ) .
infection with both viruses increased the relative luciferase activity via the isre regulatory element in luciferase assays , and both ly294002 ( 50 mum ) treatment ( figure 7g ) or knockdown of akt ( figure 7h ) eliminated virus - induced activation of isre , indicating that activated pi3k / akt in reovirus infection triggered the isre via emsy .
additionally , as shown in figures 7i - k , both infections significantly increased the transcription of ifitm1 , isg15 and viperin , and a 50 mum ly294002 treatment ( figure 7i ) or knockdown of akt ( figure 7j ) or knockdown of emsy ( figure 7k ) reduced the mrna levels of ifitm1 , isg15 , and viperin .
more importantly , overexpression of isg15 and viperin decreased viral titers ( figure 7l ) , and knockdown of isg15 and viperin increased viral rna levels ( figure 7m ) and viral titers ( figure 7n ) .
these data suggested that the activated pi3k / akt pathway contributes to the production of a set of isgs through the emsy transcriptional repressor , which inhibits the replication of reovirus .
discussion in this study , we demonstrated the role of the pi3k / akt signaling pathway in regulating reovirus infection .
we showed that akt is phosphorylated early in mpc / 04 and b / 03 infection in a pi3k - dependent manner and that akt phosphorylation is triggered and / or mediated by clathrin - mediated endocytosis .
we also demonstrated that activation of pi3k / akt depends on beta1 - integrin - mediated phosphorylation of fak .
importantly , we also found that inhibition of pi3k activation increases viral rna synthesis and viral yield , and we showed that pi3k / akt activation is an important determinant for the difference observed in growth between mpc / 04 and b / 03 .
finally , we found that pi3k / akt inhibits viral replication via increasing ifn - stimulated gene expression .
these results confirmed that pi3k / akt signaling regulates reovirus replication and that activation of pi3k / akt signaling is an important antiviral mechanism .
many wildlife species are reservoirs of some important pathogens [ for example , human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) and ebola virus ] that threaten the health of humans .
sars cov - like viruses have been isolated from horseshoe bats ( li et al. , 2005 ; wang and eaton , 2007 ; ge et al. , 2013 ) and palm civets ( guan et al. , 2003 ) .
the viruses used in this study were isolated from bat and palm civets .
it is well documented that bat - borne reoviruses can be transmitted to and cause clinical diseases in humans ( chua et al. , 2007 ) .
understanding the mechanisms of infection and pathogenesis by viruses of wildlife origin will be essential for the prevention and control of infectious disease emergence .
field viruses typically undergo mutation upon adaptation to cell culture .
the changes may be involved in virus attachment or evasion of innate immunity .
during the process of propagation on l929 cells , no mutation in amino acid sequence was detected between the genomes from the first passage virus and the second and third passage viruses .
reovirus is isolated from the respiratory and enteric tracts of humans and animals ( gauvin et al. , 2013 ) .
both mpc / 04 and b / 03 were isolated from lung tissues and replicated in same tissues in mice ( unpublished data ) .
a549 cells as a cell model for investigating the pathogenic mechanism and characteristics of some respiratory viruses were used in this study and could represent natural environment for infection of reovirus .
herpesvirus binding to alpha3beta1 integrin ( akula et al. , 2002 ) and cytomegalovirus binding to beta1 - integrin ( feire et al. , 2004 ) activate fak .
in addition , adenovirus binding of alphav integrins induces activation of pi3k , which is required for adenovirus endocytosis ( li et al. , 1998 ) .
because of their wide distribution , integrins are common receptors of diverse viral pathogens ( izmailyan et al. , 2012 ) .
reovirus infection is initiated by interactions between the attachment protein sigma1 and jam - a. blockage of beta - integrin by a specific antibody inhibits reovirus infection in hela cells , and expression of the beta1 - integrin and jam - a in non - permissive chicken embryo fibroblasts confers susceptibility to reovirus infection ( maginnis et al. , 2006 ) .
these results suggest that beta1 - integrin can affect reovirus infection .
pi3k / akt can be activated by both integrin - and rtk - mediated endocytosis pathways ( izmailyan et al. , 2012 ; goh and sorkin , 2013 ) .
activation of both pathways can lead to clathrin - mediated endocytosis .
in this study , we found that the activation of pi3k / akt depended on the upstream molecule fak and clathrin - mediated endocytosis during reovirus infection .
further investigation is required to understand whether reovirus binds to beta1 - integrin and lead to the phosphorylation of fak and activation of pi3k / akt .
the initial timing of activation of pi3k / akt depends on the virus strain .
activation of pi3k / akt can be initiated early in infection or replication .
exogenous alv infection triggers pi3k / akt signaling in the early stage ( feng et al. , 2011 ) , and this pathway can be suppressed by an inhibitor specific for clathrin - mediated endocytosis .
beta1 - integrin - mediated pi3k / akt activation is induced by vaccinia virus at 20 min p.i .
( izmailyan et al. , 2012 ) .
for influenza a virus infection , pi3k / akt activation occurs at the late stage , which depends on ns1 binding to p85beta ( ehrhardt et al. , 2007 ) .
in this study , mpc / 04 and b / 03 infection activated pi3k / akt in the early stage of infection , and blockage of pi3k / akt activation did not affect reovirus absorption and entry ( data not shown ) .
blockage of pi3k / akt during infection by alv , vaccinia virus , and other viruses inhibits viral replication , but in our case , this blockage increased viral rna synthesis and viral yield of mpc / 04 and b / 03 during infection .
thus , pi3k / akt plays an important role in recognizing reovirus infection in the early stage and inhibiting virus replication .
in this study , we found that there may be some correlation between pi3k / akt activation and viral pathogenesis .
pi3k / akt activation inhibited reovirus replication via up - regulating some of the isgs .
mpc / 04 infection stimulated more robust phosphorylation of akt ( figure 2 ) and led to higher isgs expression ( figure 7i ) compared to b / 03 and the results from figure 6e showed that mpc / 04 replicate much less than b / 03 .
more importantly , b / 03 is more pathogenic than mpc / 04 in mice ( unpublished data ) and reovirus t1l showed higher virulence than t3d in mice ( gauvin et al. , 2013 ) .
these data indicated that pi3k / akt may be associated with different virulence among different reovirus isolates .
however , more evidence needs to be identified .
the precise molecular mechanism ( s ) for regulating viral replication by pi3k / akt are not yet fully elucidated .
interferon - stimulated transcription is thought to occur mainly through the action of the jak / stat pathway .
recent findings have demonstrated that activation of the pi3k / akt pathway contributes to the induction of a set of isgs through regulating the emsy transcriptional repressor ( ezell and tsichlis , 2012 ) .
in this study , we found that isre was activated in an interferon - independent , pi3k / akt - dependent manner .
in addition , the phosphorylation of emsy was induced via pi3k / akt after infection , and emsy may regulate the induction of isre and reovirus replication .
further , reovirus infection up - regulated the transcription of isgs , namely ifitm1 , isg15 and viperin , and blockage of the pi3k / akt pathway in reovirus infection inhibited the expression of ifitm1 , isg15 and viperin .
overexpression of isg15 and viperin decreased reovirus replication , and knockdown of either enhanced reovirus replication .
although interferons are potent antiviral factors , many viruses , in turn , have evolved multiple strategies to counteract the ifn system ( didcock et al. , 1999 ; wang et al. , 2000 , 2010 , 2011 ; fensterl et al. , 2005 ; de los santos et al. , 2006 ) .
we found that reovirus infection did not induce a high production of ifn - beta , which may inhibit antiviral effects mediated by the ifn - beta response .
as a result of reovirus infection , activated pi3k / akt promoted the induction of isre and increased the expression of isgs , which can function as a compensatory pathway in interferon signaling to inhibit reovirus replication .
zhang et al .
( 2015 ) reported that pi3k / akt / p53 signaling pathway was activated upon reovirus strain mpc / 04 infection and the activation suppressed the viral replication .
in this study , activated pi3k / akt pathway suppresses reovirus replication through emsy phosphorylation and isg induction .
both studies found that pi3k / akt was involved in reovirus infectin , but provided different pathways .
emsy and p53 are known to involving dna damage / repair pathways ( cousineau and belmaaza , 2011 ) , and any cross - talk between two results may exist .
however , we found that overexpression of p53 promoted reovirus replication , but did not affect the expression of isgs ( data not shown ) .
so , both may affect reovirus replication via different pathways .
in conclusion , our study revealed , for the first time , that the pi3k / akt pathway plays an important part in regulating reovirus replication and presumably in pathogenesis .
this new finding will not only help us to better understand the role of the pi3k / akt pathway in the general virus - host interactions , but it will also be important for future investigations of the mechanisms of reovirus - host specificity and pathogenesis as well as for the development of novel prevention and control strategies for reovirus infection in human and animals .

changes in the relative abundances of many intestinal microorganisms , both those that naturally occur in the human gut microbiome and those that are considered pathogens , have been associated with a range of diseases .
to more accurately diagnose health conditions , medical practitioners could benefit from a molecular , culture - independent assay for the quantification of these microorganisms in the context of a healthy reference range .
here we present the targeted sequencing of the microbial 16s rrna gene of clinically relevant gut microorganisms as a method to provide a gut screening test that could assist in the clinical diagnosis of certain health conditions .
we evaluated the possibility of detecting 46 clinical prokaryotic targets in the human gut , 28 of which could be identified with high precision and sensitivity by a bioinformatics pipeline that includes sequence analysis and taxonomic annotation .
these targets included 20 commensal , 3 beneficial ( probiotic ) , and 5 pathogenic intestinal microbial taxa .
using stool microbiome samples from a cohort of 897 healthy individuals , we established a reference range defining clinically relevant relative levels for each of the 28 targets .
our assay quantifies 28 targets in the context of a healthy reference range and correctly reflected 38 / 38 verification samples of real and synthetic stool material containing known gut pathogens .
thus , we have established a method to determine microbiome composition with a focus on clinically relevant taxa , which has the potential to contribute to patient diagnosis , treatment , and monitoring .
more broadly , our method can facilitate epidemiological studies of the microbiome as it relates to overall human health and disease .

introduction the human gut microbiota , the consortium of microbial inhabitants in our distal gut , has been increasingly recognized as playing a major role in the maintenance , promotion and distortion of health .
a healthy gut microbiota is involved in energy extraction from dietary components [ 1,2 ] , regulation of components of the immune system [ 3 ] , vitamin synthesis [ 4 ] , and colonization resistance , i.e. , protection against colonization by gastrointestinal pathogens [ 5 ] .
in addition , there is an increasing number of associations between a microbiome imbalance and various diseases and medical conditions [ 6 ] .
such disturbances of the healthy microbiome composition have been found associated with infections with gastrointestinal pathogens such as campylobacter , salmonella and vibrio cholerae [ 7,8 ] to more elusive imbalances found in the setting of inflammatory bowel diseases [ 9,10 ] , metabolic syndrome [ 11 ] , and irritable bowel syndrome [ 12,13 ] .
rapid and accurate identification of pathogens is critical to provide the appropriate treatment for patients suffering from certain gastrointestinal conditions .
this has in particular been the case for acute diarrheal illness , for which identification of the causative agents still greatly relies on conventional microbiology techniques such as culturing of stool samples [ 14 ] .
however , although culture - based methods are rapid , sensitive , and specific , they are often designed around a presence / absence criterion , i.e. , to detect microbial organisms that are usually absent in health and present in disease .
traditional clinical microbiology methods are less able to detect potential gut microbiota imbalances , i.e. aberrant ratios of multiple non - pathogenic , health - associated microorganisms in the setting of chronic conditions .
one of the main reasons is that most intestinal commensals are hard to culture and can only be recovered under specialized technical conditions [ 15 ] .
recent advancements in amplification and next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) techniques , in particular applied to the bacterial and archaeal ribosomal rna encoding genes ( 16s rrna genes ) have overcome this problem , are increasingly used in the clinical microbiology lab [ 16,17 ] , and have enormously expanded our knowledge of microbiome composition [ 18 ] .
however , it is still difficult to use the composition of the human gut microbiota as a clinical tool in the diagnosis of chronic health conditions .
this is partly caused by large inter - individual variations associated with human geographic , dietary , genetic and lifestyle differences , which made it challenging to define the healthy human microbiome [ 19,20 ] .
therefore , most studies comparing microbiomes from healthy controls and diseased patients might be too small to detect small , but real , differences in gut microbiotas .
in this study , we present an ngs - based clinical gut microbiome sequencing assay to assess the relative abundance of health condition - associated microorganisms ( fig 1 ) .
the assay utilizes 16s rrna gene sequencing to identify 28 clinically relevant microbial targets ( 14 species and 14 genera ) , including 5 intestinal pathogens , 3 beneficial bacteria , and 20 commonly present inhabitants of the human gastrointestinal tract , with high precision and sensitivity .
in addition , we define the relative abundance ranges of these taxa in stool samples from a large healthy human cohort .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0176555.g001 fig 1 sample collection and processing of clinical stool samples for traditional clinical microbiology versus 16s rrna gene sequencing .
a traditional fecal microbiology test requires collecting a rather large stool sample in a cumbersome process and immediately delivery to the laboratory or clinical practitioner .
specific organisms are cultured from the sample based on the physician 's requests , and processing requires interpretation by extensively trained laboratory personnel .
this approach usually focuses on the discovery of culturable pathogens .
in contrast , 16s rrna gene sequencing requires only a fraction of the biological material needed for culture - based techniques ( just a swab from toilet paper ) .
in addition , the sample is collected in tube with a buffer that lyses microorganisms and stabilizes dna , allowing the sample to be mailed at room temperature .
thus , sample collection and delivery are greatly simplified .
sequencing and interpretation can be automated to reduce human labor and error .
finally , this method can detect uncultivable organisms and relative abundances of both pathogenic and commensal organisms .
material and methods participants a group of 1,000 self - reported healthy individuals who had submitted fecal samples ( one sample per subject ) were selected from the ongoing ubiome citizen science microbiome research study ( manuscript in preparation ). of these , 103 extracted fecal samples ( see below for more details ) did not pass our 10,000 read quality control threshold .
we used this stringent threshold to ensure detection of all targeted taxa , even at low abundance .
the final cohort therefore included 897 individuals ( 62 % male and 38 % female ) .
participants were explicitly asked about 42 different medical conditions such as cancer , infections , obesity , chronic health issues , and mental health disorders .
selected participants with an average age of 39.7 years ( sd = 15.5 ) responded to an extensive survey and self - reported to be currently and overall in good health .
none of the individuals selected for the healthy cohort had ever been diagnosed with high blood sugar , diabetes , gut - related symptoms , or any other medical condition .
this study was performed under a human subjects protocol provided by an irb ( e & i review services , irb study # 13044 , 05 / 10 / 2013 ) .
informed consent was obtained from all participants .
analysis of participant data was performed in aggregate and anonymously .
sample collection and 16s rrna gene sequencing fecal samples were self - collected by participants at home using commercially available ubiome microbiome sampling kits , which have been designed to follow the specifications laid out by the nih human microbiome project [ 21 ] .
participants were instructed to use a sterile swab to transfer a small amount of fecal material into a vial containing a lysis and stabilization buffer that preserves the dna for transport at ambient temperatures .
samples were lysed using bead - beating , and dna was extracted in a class 1000 clean room by a guanidine thiocyanate silica column - based purification method using a liquid - handling robot [ 22 , 23 ] .
pcr amplification of the 16s rrna genes was performed with primers containing universal primers amplifying the v4 variable region ( 515f : gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r : ggactachvgggtwtctaat ) [ 24 ] .
in addition , the primers contained illumina tags and barcodes .
samples were barcoded with a unique combination of forward and reverse indexes allowing for simultaneous processing of multiple samples .
pcr products were pooled , column - purified , and size - selected through microfluidic dna fractionation [ 25 ] .
consolidated libraries were quantified by quantitative real - time pcr using the kapa bio - rad icycler qpcr kit on a biorad myiq before loading into the sequencer .
sequencing was performed in a pair - end modality on the illumina nextseq 500 platform rendering 2 x 150 bp pair - end sequences .
taxonomic annotation and reference database generation after sequencing , demultiplexing of samples was performed using illumina 's bcl2fastq algorithm .
reads were filtered using an average q - score > 30 .
forward and reverse reads were appended together after removal of primers and any leading bases , and clustered using version 2.1.5 of the swarm algorithm [ 26 ] using a distance of 1 nucleotide and the " fastidious " and " usearch - abundance " flags .
the most abundant sequence per cluster was considered the real biological sequence and was assigned the count of all reads in the cluster .
the remainder of the reads in a cluster were considered to contain errors as a product of sequencing .
the representative reads from all clusters were subjected to chimera removal using the vsearch algorithm [ 27 ] .
reads passing all above filters ( filtered reads ) were aligned using 100 % identity over 100 % of the length against a hand - curated database of target 16s rrna gene sequences and taxonomic annotations derived from version 123 of the silva database [ 28 ] .
the hand - curated databases for each taxa were created by selectively removing sequences with amplicons that were ambiguously annotated to more than one taxonomic group , while still maximizing the performance metrics sensitivity , specificity , precision , and negative predictive value of identification for the remaining amplicons in each taxa ( s1 doc ) .
in total 28 taxonomic groups of clinical relevance passed our criteria of over 90 % for each performance metric ( s1 table ) .
raw fastq reads mapping to the samples and the taxa in the reference databases used in this study were uploaded to ebi 's ena under accession code prjeb20022 .
the relative abundance of each taxa was determined by dividing the count linked to that taxa by the total number of filtered reads .
experimental verification verification samples were obtained from luminex 's xtag gastrointestinal pathogen panel ( xtag gpp ) .
verification samples contained real or synthetic stool samples with live or recombinant material , with some specimens being positive for more than one clinical target .
a total of 40 positive control samples were used , 35 of which were certified to be positive for one control taxon from our target list , with the exception of those samples containing either clostridium difficile or salmonella enterica which are positive for 2 taxa simultaneously ( the species to which they belong and their corresponding genus ) .
the control samples were considered negative for the remainder of the taxa on our test panel .
two out of 35 control samples did not pass our sequencing quality thresholds of having at least 10,000 pair - end reads each , so they were removed from further analysis .
five additional luminex samples positive for yersinia , a genus that is not present in the final target list , were included as negative controls .
verification samples were processed in ubiome microbiome sampling kits using the clinical pipeline described above .
results and discussion clinically relevant target identification to derive a preliminary target list of bacteria and archaea to include in our assay , we first identified clinically relevant microorganisms present in the human microbiome .
we performed an extensive review of the literature and clinical landscape , and obtained evidence supporting the importance of hundreds of microorganisms known to inhabit the human gut .
we included these in our initial list , along with organisms that are commonly interrogated in clinical tests .
this initial list was further evaluated for positive and negative associations with several indications , including flatulence , bloating , diarrhea , gastroenteritis , indigestion , abdominal pain , constipation , infection , inflammatory bowel syndrome , ulcerative colitis , and crohn 's disease - related conditions .
ultimately , we compiled a preliminary target list containing 15 genera and 31 species of microorganisms associated with human health status ( s1 table ) , including pathogenic , commensal , and probiotic bacteria and archaea .
the bioinformatics annotation pipeline developed for this method was specifically designed to have high prediction performance .
to this end , we implemented a taxonomy annotation based on sequence searches of 100 % identity over the entire length of the 16s rrna gene v4 region from the preliminary targets in our database ( s1 doc ) .
curated databases were generated for each of the taxa in our preliminary target list using the performance metrics sensitivity , specificity , precision , and negative predictive value as optimizing parameters .
in other words , the bioinformatics pipeline was optimized to ensure that a positive result truly means the target is present in the sample and a negative result is only obtained when no target is present in the sample .
after optimizing the confusion matrices for all preliminary targets , 28 out of 46 targets passed our stringent threshold of 90 % for each of the parameters ( fig 2 ) .
the resulting target list is composed of 5 known pathogens , 3 beneficial bacteria , and 20 additional microorganisms related to various gut afflictions ( s2 table ) , including commensal bacteria and one archaeon .
on average the sensitivity , specificity , precision , and negative prediction value of the microorganisms on our target list are 99.0 % , 100 % , 98.9 % , and 100 % , for the species , and 97.4 % , 100 % , 98.5 % , and 100 % for the genera .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0176555.g002 fig 2 bioinformatics target identification performance metrics .
the 46 preliminary targets identified from literature and available clinical tests are comprised of 15 genera and 31 species .
to optimize the bioinformatics pipeline for accurate detection of the maximum number of targets , the following performance metrics were evaluated based on the number of true positives ( tp ) , true negatives ( tn ) , false positives ( fp ) , and false negatives ( fn ) detected in a manually curated amplicon database ( described in s1 doc ) : specificity = tn / ( tn + fp ) ; sensitivity = tp / ( tp + fn ) ; precision = tp / ( tp + fp ) ; and negative predictive value ( npv ) = tn / ( tn + fn ) .
after optimization , 28 / 46 preliminary targets passed our stringent threshold of 90 % ( red vertical line ) for each of the parameters , resulting in the accurate detection of all genera ( light blue ) except for pseudoflavonifractor , and 14 / 31 species ( dark blue ) .
reference ranges from a healthy cohort many clinically relevant microorganisms associated with health and disease are present at some level in the gut of healthy individuals .
the clinical significance of microbiome test results is determined not only by the identity , but also the quantity of distinct species and genera within the context of a healthy reference range .
to determine the healthy reference range for the 28 targets , we established a cohort of 897 samples from self - reported healthy individuals from the ubiome microbiome research study ( manuscript in preparation ) .
microbiome data from this cohort were analyzed to determine the empirical reference ranges for the 14 species and 14 genera .
for each of the 897 samples , we determined the relative abundance of each target within the microbial population .
this analysis gave rise to a distribution of relative abundance for each target in the cohort ( fig 3 , s3 table ) .
these data were used to define a central 99 % healthy range with confidence intervals for each target .
many of the targets show significant spread , emphasizing the importance of microbiome identification in the context of a reference range .
for example , the pathogen c. difficile is found in ~ 2 % of the healthy cohort , and thus we define a healthy range for it from 0 % to 0.18 % relative abundance .
although c. difficile is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause severe diarrhea , especially among antibiotic - treated hospitalized patients [ 29 ] , our results confirm that asymptomatic c. difficile colonization is not uncommon in healthy individuals [ 30 ] .
although all taxa were present in at least one of the healthy individuals , the upper limit of the reference range of the relative abundance was found to be quite high for some taxa ( e.g. , 63 % for prevotella and 49 % for bifidobacterium ) .
two species are not represented at all within the central 99 % of the healthy cohort : vibrio cholerae and ruminococcus albus .
the absence of v. cholerae is suggestive of its pathogenic nature and its relatively rare occurrence in the developed world .
however , r. albus , has previously been found to be enriched in healthy subjects in comparison to patients with crohn 's disease [ 31 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0176555.g003 fig 3 reference ranges from a cohort of healthy individuals for 28 clinically relevant species and genera .
healthy participant stool microbiome data were analyzed to determine the empirical reference ranges for each target .
the boxplot displays the relative abundance for each of 897 self - reported healthy individuals , revealing the healthy ranges of abundance for the taxa in the test panel .
the healthy distribution is used to define the 99 % confidence interval ( red line ) .
boxes indicate the 25th - 75th percentile , and the median coverage is indicated by a horizontal line in each box .
even in this healthy cohort , many of the bacteria that are associated with poor health conditions are present at some level .
as most taxa are absent in a significant number of individuals most boxes expand to 0 % , the healthy lower limit ( not shown ) .
detection of known pathogens above the healthy reference range after establishing our ability to detect all 28 targets using synthetic dna at relative abundances of 0.03 % or more ( s2 doc , s4 table ) , we tested 40 reference isolates from luminex 's xtag gastrointestinal pathogen panel to establish the clinical relevance of our pipeline .
these verification samples comprise real or synthetic stool samples with live or recombinant material of known composition .
two of the samples were excluded due to poor sequencing depth .
the remaining samples were positive for 1 of 8 different bacterial strains corresponding to 5 of our clinical targets : v. cholerae ( 5 ) , s. enterica ( 5 ) , escherichia - shigella ( 13 ) , campylobacter ( 5 ) and c. difficile ( 5 ) .
all of these verification samples were correctly identified as having a relative abundance of the clinical target well above our defined healthy reference range ( fig 4 ) .
five samples containing yersinia were tested as a negative control .
although yersinia was included in our preliminary target list , it did not pass our stringent bioinformatics qc thresholds for accurate identification .
as expected , the relative abundance of the 28 clinical targets was in the healthy range for the yersinia positive samples , as shown for escherichia - shigella ( fig 4 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0176555.g004 fig 4 experimental validation of the clinical 16s rrna gene sequencing for pathogens on the screening test panel using verification samples .
commercially available verification samples ( luminex ) containing real or synthetic stool samples positive for at least one control taxon from the target panel were tested using the dna extraction , amplification and bioinformatics pipeline described in this paper. of the 35 samples on this panel , 33 yielded 10,000 or more reads .
together , these 33 samples contained the 5 pathogenic taxa in our target list , all of which were accurately identified at a level above the maximum value of the healthy range ( red lines ) .
all 33 control samples tested within the healthy range for the remainder of the taxa on our panel ( not shown ) , and thus were considered negative for the pathogenic taxa shown here .
five samples positive for yersinia , a genus that is not present in our target list , were included as additional negative controls .
these samples are visualized for the escherichia - shigella genus as they contained dna for this taxon within the healthy range .
clinical relevance accurate detection of microorganisms in the context of a healthy reference range can be of great use to physicians .
all of the 28 microorganisms successfully identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing are associated with specific health conditions .
for example , 2 of the microorganisms on our panel , escherichia - shigella and ruminococcus , are associated with crohn 's disease [ 32 - 37 ] , while 5 other organisms , akkermansia muciniphila , bifidobacterium , dialister invisus , odoribacter and roseburia , are inversely associated with crohn 's disease [ 32,35 - 38 ] ( fig 5 , s2 table ) .
to help diagnose and monitor this condition and distinguish it from other conditions with other microbial associations , it is essential to sequence a panel of microorganisms .
the combinatorial information of which organisms are outside of the healthy range can be used by a physician to augment a treatment plan .
for example , reducing the intake of animal based diets and diets high in resistant starches to reduce ruminococcus [ 39 - 41 ] and the consumption of probiotics , inulin and oligofructoses to increase levels of bifidobacterium [ 42,43 ] .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0176555.g005 fig 5 human health associations of the 28 targets microorganisms .
all of the 28 taxa on the test have been associated with human health in the gut microbiome .
here we show the associations for 13 specific conditions .
13 of the taxa are associated with health conditions , meaning that these microorganisms have been shown to be elevated in patients suffering from these conditions .
the 11 microorganisms that are inversely associated were found to be less abundant in people who have this condition in the scientific literature ( s2 table ) .
4 taxa are associated with some and inversely associated with other conditions .
interestingly , both elevated and reduced levels of lactobacillus have been associated with obesity [ 44 - 46 ] .
the accurate detection of a great number of microorganisms within a stool sample is critical to initiate the appropriate treatment in a clinical setting .
here we have shown that 16s rrna gene sequencing can accurately detect and quantify clinically relevant levels of 28 target bacteria and archaea .
we demonstrate that many prokaryotic targets identified from the literature as associated with human health can be consolidated in an assay , and further that relating the relative levels of bacteria and archaea to a healthy reference range enables the reporting of positive results only when clinically relevant .
the selection of microorganisms for this panel was based on studies in medical journals and peer - reviewed articles .
while all targets are relevant on their own , there is some overlap in the consolidated test .
for example , while the salmonella genus is unquestionably clinically relevant , testing for the genus when the test already includes the salmonella enterica species might be clinically redundant .
the only other species of salmonella is salmonella bongori , a species that rarely infects humans and is mostly relevant to lizards [ 47 ] .
in our dataset of nearly 900 stool samples from healthy individuals , eight samples tested positive for the genus - level salmonella target ( s3 table ) .
in 6 of these , the relative salmonella - genus abundance was less than 0.01 % , the clinical relevance of which remains unclear .
in one of the two remaining subjects , both salmonella - genus and s. enterica abundance values were 0.674 % , suggesting the same target was detected .
in the remaining sample , salmonella - genus was present at 1.84 % but s. enterica was not detected , suggesting that this individual might have been colonized with s. bongori. of note , none of these individuals reported having gastrointestinal problems .
it remains to be determined whether these low counts of salmonella are suggestive of the presence of clinically irrelevant , yet - uncharacterized strains , as has been reported in cattle [ 48 ] .
while medical diagnosis has traditionally been focused on pathogens , research on the whole microbiome and its correlations with gut health continues to emerge [ 6,20 ] .
the test panel presented here reports on some microorganisms that are not usually interrogated in the clinic but provide additional insight into the overall gut health of a patient in a clinical setting ( s2 table ) .
because our detection method is based on dna sequencing , the target panel can readily be expanded if new information about clinically important microorganisms arises .
because 16s rrna gene sequencing identifies and quantifies the bacteria and archaea in a sample , relevant microbial metrics such as a microbiome diversity score can also be obtained , in addition to the information about individual targets , to provide a comprehensive overview of gastrointestinal health [ 49,50 ] .
as any rrna gene based test , this assay has limitations .
the test only detects and analyzes a short , specific genomic region , and taxonomic resolution or functional inference is therefore limited .
for example , this assay cannot recognize the different serovars within s. enterica , or detect toxin genes that could distinguish pathogenic c. difficile or escherichia strains from nonpathogenic strains , or resolve species within some of the genus - level targets .
the correlation - - or lack thereof - - of 16s rrna - based phylogenetic sequence identities with taxonomic levels such as genus or species has been extensively discussed elsewhere [ 51 - 54 ] .
16s rrna gene sequencing as a clinical screening tool for gut - related conditions has many advantages over traditional culture - based techniques , including ease of sampling , scalability of the test , no need for human interpretation , and the ability to provide additional information about gut health .
most importantly , it can determine the relative abundances of multiple microbial targets , and can therefore be used to detect potential deviations of one or many taxa from that of a healthy cohort .
defining the healthy ranges for gut microbes with known clinical relevance , as done in this study , is likely to bring the analysis of the composition of the gut microbiome one step closer to being part of routine health care analysis [ 55 - 57 ] .
thus , this method of detection for multiple clinically relevant microbial targets is a promising addition to current diagnostic techniques and treatment options .
supporting information s1 table bioinformatics performance of the preliminary clinical target list .
the 46 targets identified from literature and available clinical tests comprise 15 genera and 31 species .
the bioinformatics pipeline for accurate detection of the maximum number of targets is optimized based on the performance metrics sensitivity , specificity , precision and negative predictive value ( npv ) as determined with a manually curated amplicon database ( described in s1 doc ) .
the metrics are calculated based on the number of true positives ( tp ) , true negatives ( tn ) , false positives ( fp ) and false negatives ( fn ) as follows : specificity = tn / ( tn + fp ) , sensitivity = tp / ( tp + fn ) , precision = tp / ( tp + fp ) and negative predictive value ( npv ) = tn / ( tn + fn ) .

background idiopathic sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis ( or abdominal cocoon ) is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction , especially in adult population .
diagnosis is usually incidental at laparotomy .
we discuss one such rare case , outlining the fact that an intra - operative surprise diagnosis could have been facilitated by previous investigations .
case presentation a 56 year - old man presented in a & e department with small bowel ileus .
he had a history of 6 similar episodes of small bowel obstruction in the past 4 years , which resolved with conservative treatment .
pre - operative work - up did not reveal any specific etiology .
at laparotomy , a fibrous capsule was revealed , in which small bowel loops were encased , with the presence of interloop adhesions .
a diagnosis of abdominal cocoon was established and extensive adhesiolysis was performed .
the patient had an uneventful recovery and follow - up. conclusion idiopathic sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis , although rare , may be the cause of a common surgical emergency such as small bowel ileus , especially in cases with attacks of non - strangulating obstruction in the same individual .
a high index of clinical suspicion may be generated by the recurrent character of small bowel ileus combined with relevant imaging findings and lack of other plausible etiologies .
clinicians must rigorously pursue a preoperative diagnosis , as it may prevent a " surprise " upon laparotomy and result in proper management .
background sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction , and can be classified as idiopathic or secondary ( most importantly and most frequently due to chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ) .
the idiopathic form ( also known as abdominal cocoon ) was first described by foo et al in 1978 [ 1,2 ] .
it affects mainly young females from tropical and subtropical regions , but adult case reports from temperate zones can be encountered in literature .
it is characterized by a thick , fibrotic , cocoon - like membrane , partially or totally encasing the small bowel .
clinically , it presents with recurrent episodes of acute or subacute small bowel obstruction , weight loss , nausea and anorexia , and at times with a palpable abdominal mass [ 2 ] .
most cases are diagnosed incidentally at laparotomy , as in the case presented , although a preoperative diagnosis is purported feasible by a combination of barium follow - through ( concertina pattern or cauliflower sign and delayed transit of contrast medium ) and computed tomography of the abdomen ( small bowel loops congregated to the center of the abdomen encased by a soft - tissue density mantle )[ 3,4 ] .
however , preoperative diagnosis requires a high index of clinical suspicion .
surgery ( membrane dissection and extensive adhesiolysis ) is the treatment of choice , and there is usually no need for bowel loop resection , especially when a preoperative diagnosis is feasible .
resection of the bowel is unnecessary and it increases morbidity and mortality .
resection is indicated only if the bowel is non - viable .
an excellent long - term postoperative prognosis is most of the times guaranteed [ 5 ] .
recently , in a series of 5 patients , in addition to adhesiolysis , small bowel intubation was performed with good results [ 6 ] .
case presentation in september 2004 , a 56 year - old man presented in a & e with 24 - hour history of colicky abdominal pain and bilious vomiting .
he reported 6 similar episodes , attributed to small bowel obstruction in the past 4 years , which required hospitalization and resolved with conservative treatment .
he also admitted chronic constipation for the last 6 years , anorexia and 15 kg weight loss since his last admission ( april 2004 ) .
he had no surgical or other medical history .
on examination , he was in distress , but afebrile and haemodynamically stable .
his abdomen was distended but non - tender , with increased bowel sounds in pitch and frequency .
no palpable abdominal mass or organomegaly and no external hernias were present .
laboratory blood analyses were within normal limits .
plain abdominal x - ray showed few air - fluid levels centrally located , without free intraperitoneal gas .
ultrasound of the abdomen did not reveal any abnormalities .
contrast - enhanced abdomen computed tomography , performed on the same day , confirmed the diagnosis of small bowel ileus without providing any diagnostic clues .
the patient was admitted to the general surgical ward and ileus resolved by day 3 conservatively .
endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract and biopsies from the duodenum and colon provided normal findings .
although symptoms of obstruction had abated , the history of multiple relapses , the patient 's complaints for poor quality of life and multiple admissions , as well as the undefined origin of the underlying pathology led to an exploratory laparotomy on day 7 .
on surgery , a fibrous capsule covering all the abdominal viscera was revealed , in which small bowel loops were encased , with the presence of interloop adhesions .
the liver , stomach , appendix , right and left colon , as well as the sigmoid , were also covered and the greater omentum looked hypoplastic and encased in fibrous tissue ( figure 1 ) .
incision of the thick membrane and extensive adhesiolysis of small bowel loops were performed without loop resection .
histology of the membrane showed thickened fibrocollagenous tissue without inflammation .
a diagnosis of idiopathic sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis ( abdominal cocoon ) was established , due to intraoperative findings and by ruling - out any other condition explaining the patient 's pathology .
postoperatively , a forgotten small bowel follow - through performed elsewhere in 2000 was brought to our attention by the patient , showing " ileal loops bunched and confined in the lower abdomen and pelvis apparently due to adhesions " ( figure 2 ) .
postoperative recovery was uneventful and 10 months after the operation he is in good health .
conclusion in the case presented , an intra - operative diagnosis of idiopathic sclerosing peritonitis was made in an adult male patient with a history of recurrent bouts of small bowel ileus .
pre - operative findings were inconclusive in his current admission .
although final surgical management would not have been modified , if results from imaging investigations during prior admissions were accessible in time , a pre - operative diagnosis could have been made possible .
idiopathic sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis or abdominal cocoon , although a rare cause of a common surgical emergency such as small bowel ileus , may be responsible , especially in cases with recurrent attacks of non - strangulating obstruction in the same individual .
a high index of clinical suspicion may be generated by the recurrent presentation of small bowel ileus combined with relevant imaging findings and lack of other etiologies clinicians must rigorously pursue a preoperative diagnosis , as it may prevent a " surprise " upon laparotomy and unnecessary procedures for the patient , such as bowel resection .

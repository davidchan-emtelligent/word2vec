2012 elsevier inc.open access under cc by 3.0 license summary the t7 phage - encoded small protein gp2 is a non - dna - binding transcription factor that interacts with the jaw domain of the escherichia coli ( ec ) rna polymerase ( rnap ) beta ' subunit and inhibits transcriptionally proficient promoter - complex ( rpo ) formation .
here , we describe the high - resolution solution structure of the gp2 - ec beta ' jaw domain complex and show that gp2 and dna compete for binding to the beta ' jaw domain .
we reveal that efficient inhibition of rpo formation by gp2 requires the amino - terminal sigma70 domain region 1.1 ( r1.1 ) , and that gp2 antagonizes the obligatory movement of r1.1 during rpo formation .
we demonstrate that gp2 inhibits rpo formation not just by steric occlusion of the rnap - dna interaction but also through long - range antagonistic effects on rnap - promoter interactions around the rnap active center that likely occur due to repositioning of r1.1 by gp2 .
the inhibition of ec rnap by gp2 thus defines a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which bacterial transcription is regulated by a viral factor .

in bacteria , transcription is catalyzed by a multisubunit rna polymerase ( rnap ) with subunit composition alpha2betabeta'omegasigma ( abbreviated as esigma ) .
the catalytic determinants of the bacterial rnap are contained in the largest and second - largest subunits ( beta ' and beta , respectively ) .
the overall architecture of rnap is reminiscent of a crab claw ( murakami et al. , 2002b ) .
the two pincers of the claw form a positively charged dna binding channel ( dbc ) .
the active center where rna synthesis occurs is located deep within the dbc ( figure 1a ) .
a number of flexible domains from the beta ' and beta subunits ( beta ' jaw , beta ' insertion 6 , beta ' downstream clamp , and beta downstream and upstream lobe domains ) surround the dbc and contribute to stable binding of dna ( opalka et al. , 2010 ) .
a dissociable rnap binding factor called the sigma ( sigma ) subunit confers promoter specificity upon the rnap by recognizing the - 35 and - 10 ( with respect to the transcription start site at + 1 , hereafter called the + 1 site ) elements present in most bacterial promoters. of the seven sigma factors encoded by the escherichia coli ( ec ) genome , sigma70 is responsible for transcription of housekeeping genes and is therefore a major sigma factor essential for growth of the cell ( haugen et al. , 2008 ) .
the six remaining " alternative " sigma factors contribute to transcription of genes under specific stress conditions , growth transitions , and / or morphological changes ( gruber and gross , 2003 ) .
other bacteria also have one sigma70 - like major sigma factor that is responsible for transcription of housekeeping genes , and a variable number of alternative sigma factors .
all alternative sigma factors , with the exception of sigma54 , are related to sigma70 .
in ec , transcription at most sigma70 - dependent promoters begins with sigma70 - directed reversible binding of esigma70 to the promoter , which results in the formation of the initial closed promoter complex ( rpc ) .
at most promoters , the rpc is unstable and either dissociates or isomerizes via several intermediates to the transcription - initiation - competent open promoter complex ( rpo ) .
in the rpo , the promoter dna strands are locally melted and form a transcription bubble spanning positions - 12 to + 3 of the promoter and the + 1 position of the template strand placed at the rnap active center ( figure 1a ) ( murakami et al. , 2002a ; saecker et al. , 2011 ) .
the double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) immediately downstream of the active center ( dwdna ) interacts with a segment of the dbc called the downstream dbc ( dwdbc ) , and this interaction is essential for the formation and stability of the rpo ( murakami et al. , 2002a ; saecker et al. , 2011 ) .
the beta ' jaw , beta ' insertion 6 , and beta ' downstream clamp domains contribute to the dwdbc ( murakami et al. , 2002a ) .
the dwdna interaction with the dwdbc can be divided into active center - proximal (+ 5 to + 8 ) and - distal (+ 10 to + 20 ) sets of interactions .
the active center - distal interactions mainly involve the beta ' jaw , beta ' insertion 6 , and beta clamp domains .
in the structural model of the rpo , the beta ' jaw domain aligns with the path of the dwdna and is located closest to the dwdna .
the deletion of the beta ' jaw domain ( amino acid residues 1149 - 1190 ) in the ec rnap dramatically reduces the stability of the rpo ( ederth et al. , 2002 ) .
thus , it is very likely , but as yet experimentally unproven , that the beta ' jaw domain makes sequence - nonspecific contacts with the dwdna during rpo formation .
within the sigma70 family , only proteins that function as major sigma factors contain an extended (~ 100 amino - acid - long ) amino - terminal domain , called region 1.1 ( r1.1 ) .
sequences of r1.1 from major sigma factors from various sources are variable but tend to be acidic .
at sigma70 - dependent promoters , r1.1 plays an important regulatory role during transcription initiation ( see below ) .
although the solution structure of the isolated domain of r1.1 ( amino acid residues 1 - 100 ) of thermotoga maritima sigmaa ( a counterpart of ec sigma70 ) is available ( schwartz et al. , 2008 ) , the r1.1 domain is not resolved in the crystal structures of the sigmaa - containing rnap from thermus aquaticus and t. thermophilus ( murakami et al. , 2002a , 2002b ; vassylyev et al. , 2002 ) , implying that it is disordered and / or can adopt multiple conformations .
fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) analyses indicate that in the absence of promoter dna , the position of r1.1 in esigma70 corresponds to that of the dwdna in the rpo ( mekler et al. , 2002 ) .
in other words , in esigma70 , r1.1 is located deep within the active - center cleft , just above the floor of the dwdbc channel , and is positioned to interact with the floor and walls of the dwdbc ( figure 1a ) ( mekler et al. , 2002 ) .
in the rpo , r1.1 is displaced to the tip of the beta - subunit pincer ( mekler et al. , 2002 ) .
hence , it has been proposed that in free esigma70 , r1.1 acts as a mimic of dwdna and must be displaced for dwdna to enter the dwdbc and allow the rnap active center to access the dna ( mekler et al. , 2002 ) .
gp2 is a 7 kda , t7 bacteriophage - encoded , non - dna - binding transcription factor .
the essential biological function of gp2 is to coordinate transcription of the phage genome by the host and viral rnaps ( savalia et al. , 2010 ) .
gp2 binds tightly to the beta ' jaw domain of ec rnap ( camara et al. , 2010 ; nechaev and severinov , 1999 ) and strongly inhibits transcription from sigma70 - dependent bacterial promoters ( camara et al. , 2010 ; nechaev and severinov , 1999 ) .
gp2 inhibits rpo formation but does not bind to ( and therefore has no effect on ) preformed rpo ( nechaev and severinov , 1999 ) .
recently , using an optimized variant of the sigma70 - dependent t5 n25 promoter ( hereafter called n25cons ) , we trapped and characterized a ternary esigma70 - gp2 - promoter complex that had normal contacts with promoter dna upstream of the + 1 site and a partially open transcription bubble , but was transcriptionally inactive and lacked the interaction with the dwdna ( mekler et al. , 2011b ) .
here , we describe the near - atomic resolution solution structure of gp2 bound to a fragment of the beta ' jaw domain ( ec beta ' subunit residues 1153 - 1213 ) .
we show by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) chemical shift perturbation analyses that the beta ' jaw domain interacts directly with dsdna , and that the interaction surface for dsdna overlaps with the gp2 binding surface. by using rnap containing mutant sigma70 lacking r1.1 ( amino acid residues 1 - 100 ) and determining the effect of the in trans addition of the isolated r1.1 domain on the mutant rnap activity in the presence of gp2 , we demonstrate that gp2 inhibits rpo formation by esigma70 not only by sterically preventing dwdna binding to the dwdbc but also by exerting r1.1 - dependent and long - range antagonistic effects on rnap - promoter dna interactions near the rnap active center .
results from biophysical analyses demonstrate that gp2 changes the microenvironment of r1.1 in esigma70 and restricts the obligatory displacement of r1.1 from the dwdbc during rpo formation .
a combination of direct ( by competing for dwdna binding ) and indirect ( mediated by r1.1 ) effects makes gp2 a highly efficient inhibitor of rpo formation by esigma70 .
results structure of the complex between gp2 and the beta ' jaw domain a lysine substitution at residue e1158 or e1188 in the beta ' jaw domain prevents gp2 from binding to the ec rnap ( figure s1a available online ) ( camara et al. , 2010 ; nechaev and severinov , 2003 ) .
therefore , the major gp2 interacting surface on the beta ' jaw domain probably includes residues 1158 - 1188 .
in agreement with this view , deletion of residues 1149 - 1190 in the ec rnap confers resistance to inhibition by gp2 ( nechaev and severinov , 1999 ) .
we determined the solution structure of the complex between gp2 and a fragment of the beta ' jaw domain ( representing ec beta ' jaw domain residues 1153 - 1213 ; hereafter referred to as the beta ' jaw fragment ) using multidimensional nmr spectroscopy applied to hybrid - labeled complexes .
backbone calpha , cbeta , c ' , n , and hn assignments for each of the labeled binding partner were obtained from hncacb / cbca ( co ) nh and hn ( ca ) co / hnco spectra , and side - chain assignments were completed with the use of hcch total correlation spectroscopy spectra .
broadening of some residues in the binding interface indicates the presence of conformational exchange in the isolated complex , perhaps due to the beta ' jaw fragment not fully representing the complete rnap interaction .
despite this , the interface was initially characterized based on the manual unambiguous assignment of a few intermolecular nuclear overhauser effect ( noes ) from 13c / 15n - filtered noe spectroscopy - heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) spectra .
automated noe assignment methods using the aria program were used to complete the noe assignment of the complex and calculate a family of 10 structures ( figure s1b and table 1 ) .
the solution structure of the ec beta ' jaw fragment consists primarily of a four - stranded antiparallel beta sheet ( figures 1b and 1c ) and shows high structural similarity to the corresponding region of the beta ' subunit in the crystal structures of t. aquaticus and t. thermophilus rnap ( figure s1c ) .
in the complex with gp2 , the beta sheet is extended to a seven - stranded beta sheet in an antiparallel arrangement ( figure 1b ) .
the primary interface region is localized to beta3 and beta2 of the beta ' jaw fragment and beta3 and alpha1 of gp2 .
the two invariant arginine residues in gp2 that are important for binding to the rnap , r56 and r58 ( camara et al. , 2010 ) , are located in the interface region in close proximity to e1188 , providing a significant ionic interaction across the interface ( figure 1b , inset ) .
additional interfacial residues include l36 , l40 , t55 , and v57 from gp2 , and v1176 , y1186 , e1187 , e1188 , and m1189 from the beta ' jaw domain ( figures 1a and 1b , insets ) .
residues l36 , l40 , and v57 of gp2 form the major hydrophobic contacts with v1176 and m1189 of the beta ' jaw domain at the binding interface ( figures 1a and 1b , insets ) .
gp2 contains a contiguous strip of seven negatively charged amino acids ( e21 , e34 , d37 , e38 , e41 , e44 , and e53 ; hereafter referred to as the negatively charged strip [ ncs ]) on the side of the molecule opposing r56 and r58 ( sheppard et al. , 2011 ) .
analyses of the role of the ncs by mutagenesis reveal that the ncs is not important for the binding of gp2 to rnap , but the disruption of the ncs significantly attenuates the ability of gp2 to inhibit rpo formation ( sheppard et al. , 2011 ) .
an examination of the surface electrostatic properties of the gp2 - beta ' jaw fragment complex reveals that the ncs in gp2 is extended by residues e1158 , d1181 , d1184 , e1187 , and e1188 of the beta ' jaw domain ( figure s1d ) .
interaction of the beta ' jaw domain with dsdna to better understand how gp2 inhibits rpo formation by esigma70 , we derived a composite structural model of the gp2 - rnap complex using our solution structure of the gp2 - beta ' jaw fragment complex together with structural models of the ec core rnap ( opalka et al. , 2010 ) and rpo based on the structure of the t. aquaticus rnap ( murakami et al. , 2002a ) .
in the composite structural model , the gp2 - binding surface of the beta ' jaw domain is facing the dwdbc and toward where the dwdna would likely lie in the rpo ( figure 2a , insets i and ii ) .
because gp2 antagonizes the interaction between the dwdna and dwdbc during rpo formation ( mekler et al. , 2011a , 2011b ) , we hypothesized that this region of the beta ' jaw domain would make sequence - nonspecific direct contacts with dsdna , and the binding of gp2 could block or modulate its interaction with dsdna .
to test whether an interaction exists between the beta ' jaw domain and dsdna during rpo formation , we conducted an nmr titration experiment with a randomly generated 14 bp dsdna fragment and 15n - labeled beta ' jaw fragment .
we recorded 2d 1h - 15n hsqc spectra to monitor the backbone amide chemical shift changes in the beta ' jaw fragment in the presence of dna .
the nmr spectrum exhibited several specific chemical shift changes , which were in fast exchange on the nmr timescale indicative of a binding constant in the micromolar to millimolar range ( figure 2b ) .
the major perturbed residues ( t1169 , r1174 , and m1189 ) map to the exposed surface of the beta3 sheet of the beta ' jaw fragment ( figure 2a , inset ii , and figure s1a ) , suggesting that these residues are involved in interaction with dsdna .
consistent with this view , results from formaldehyde crosslinking experiments showed that whereas the wild - type beta ' jaw fragment could be crosslinked to the 32p - labeled 14 bp dsdna , a mutant beta ' jaw fragment containing an alanine substitution at r1174 could not be detectably crosslinked to the dsdna ( figure s1e , compare lanes 2 and 4 ) .
further , the r1174a mutation in the context of esigma70 formed a significantly reduced number of rpo compared with the wild - type esigma70 ( figure s1f ) .
however , once the rpo were formed , the stabilities of the mutant and wild - type rpo upon challenge with heparin were indistinguishable ( figure s1f ) , which is not surprising considering that the interface between esigma70 and dna is extensive in the rpo , and the effect of a single point mutation in the beta ' jaw domain on overall dna binding by esigma70 would be difficult to detect .
thus , in the composite model , we redefined the potential path of the dsdna in the rpo with respect to the beta ' jaw domain ( figure 2a , inset iii ) .
a comparison of the dna - interacting surface in the beta ' jaw fragment with the gp2 - binding interface from our solution structure of the gp2 - beta ' - fragment complex reveals significant overlap and suggests that gp2 and dsdna may compete for overlapping interaction surfaces on the beta ' jaw domain in the rnap ( figure 2a , inset iii and iv ) .
to test this hypothesis , we performed a competition nmr experiment by titrating gp2 into a saturated complex of the beta ' jaw - fragment - dsdna complex and recorded the changes in the nmr spectrum .
as shown in figure 2c , the characteristic nmr spectrum of the gp2 - beta ' jaw - fragment complex was regained after the addition of gp2 , thus confirming that in the context of the isolated beta ' jaw fragment , gp2 is able to displace dsdna efficiently .
consistent with this view , results from formaldehyde crosslinking experiments showed that in the presence of gp2 , the beta ' jaw fragment could not be efficiently crosslinked to the 32p - labeled 14 bp dsdna ( figure s1e , compare lanes 2 and 3 ) .
overall , the results strongly suggest that gp2 and dna compete for overlapping binding sites on the beta ' jaw domain in the rnap , and provide a structural basis for and further insights ( see below ) into the mechanism by which gp2 inhibits rpo formation by esigma70 .
gp2 requires r1.1 to efficiently inhibit rpo formation by esigma70 the location of gp2 in our composite structural model of the gp2 - rnap complex places gp2 proximal to the location of r1.1 of sigma70 in esigma70 inferred from biophysical studies ( mekler et al. , 2002 ) .
thus , it is possible that gp2 could affect r1.1 function during rpo formation , and therefore gp2 could inhibit rpo formation by a mechanism involving r1.1 of sigma70 .
to test this hypothesis , we explored the role of r1.1 in the mechanism by which gp2 inhibits rpo formation by esigma70 .
initially , we determined the ability of gp2 to inhibit esigma70 reconstituted with either wild - type sigma70 or sigma70deltar1.1 using an in vitro transcription assay .
incubation of an ~ 2 - fold molar excess of gp2 with esigma70 before the addition of a dna fragment containing the lacuv5 promoter abolished the synthesis of lacuv5 - specific apapupu transcript ( figure 3a , lanes 1 and 2 ) ( camara et al. , 2010 ) .
in contrast , under identical conditions , esigma70deltar1.1 was inhibited far less efficiently (~ 55 % inhibition ; figure 3a , lanes 3 and 4 ) even though the affinity of gp2 for esigma70deltar1.1 and esigma70 did not differ detectably among the conditions under which the in vitro transcription assays were performed ( figures s2a and s2b ) .
therefore , it seems that full inhibition of esigma70 rpo formation by gp2 requires r1.1 of sigma70 .
consistent with this view , the in trans addition of the isolated domain of sigma70 r1.1 ( encompassing sigma70 amino acids 1 - 100 ) to esigma70deltar1.1 increased the efficiency of esigma70deltar1.1 transcription inhibition by gp2 , bringing it to the same level as in the case of esigma70 ( figure 3b , lanes 2 - 5 ) .
thus , the presence of the isolated r1.1 domain in trans in esigma70deltar1.1 allows gp2 to efficiently inhibit rnap .
full inhibition of esigma70deltar1.1 by gp2 occurred when the isolated r1.1 domain was added in trans to the esigma70deltar1.1 either before or after gp2 binding ( figure s2c ) .
control reactions established that the in trans presence of the isolated r1.1 domain in esigma70deltar1.1 ( in the absence of gp2 ) did not antagonize the ability of esigma70deltar1.1 to synthesize the apapapu transcript ( figure s2d ) .
an alternative ec sigma factor , sigma38 , does not contain r1.1 but is able to recognize some sigma70 - dependent promoters ( gruber and gross , 2003 ) .
we compared the ability of gp2 to inhibit rpo formation by esigma38 and esigma70 on one such promoter , the ec osme promoter ( bordes et al. , 2000 ) .
although the affinity of gp2 for esigma38 and esigma70 did not differ detectably among the conditions under which the in vitro transcription assays were performed ( figures s2a and s2b ) , gp2 inhibited esigma38 - dependent synthesis of the apapcpa osme transcript by only ~ 80 % even under conditions in which the amount of gp2 exceeded that of esigma38 by ~ 4 - fold ( figure s2e ) .
in contrast , transcription initiation by esigma70 from this promoter was barely detectable under the same conditions ( figure s2e ) .
as expected , full inhibition of rpo formation by esigma70 on the osme promoter was r1.1 dependent ( figure s2f , lanes 3 - 6 ) .
moreover , in the presence of the r1.1 domain of sigma70 added in trans , gp2 fully inhibited rpo formation by esigma38 on the osme promoter ( figure s2f , lanes 7 - 10 ) .
in summary , even though no detectable differences in the affinity of gp2 for esigma70 , esigma70deltar1.1 , and esigma38 were observed in two independent experiments ( figures s2a and s2b ) , we cannot exclude the possibility that the absence of r1.1 ( as in the case of esigma70deltar1.1 and esigma38 ) can affect the affinity of gp2 for rnap .
however , the results strongly suggest that r1.1 of sigma70 is part of the mechanism by which gp2 inhibits rpo formation by esigma70 : gp2 alone antagonizes dwdna binding to the dwdbc , leading to partial inhibition of rpo formation , and full inhibition requires r1.1 of sigma70 .
gp2 requires r1.1 of sigma70 , but not the consensus promoter dna sequences , to fully inhibit rpo formation by esigma70 the sigma70 factor makes extensive contacts with the consensus promoter dna sequences ( i.e. , the - 35 and - 10 promoter elements ) in the rpc and during rpo formation .
because full inhibition of esigma70 rpo formation by gp2 depends on r1.1 of sigma70 , we considered whether interactions between esigma70 and the consensus promoter dna sequences play any role in the mechanism by which inhibition of rpo formation by gp2 at sigma70 - dependent promoters occurs .
to address this issue experimentally , we determined whether gp2 could inhibit the catalytic activity of esigma70 on a promoterless minimal nucleic acid scaffold template ( hereafter called the minimal scaffold [ ms ] probe ) .
the ms probe consists of an 18 - nucleotide - long dna duplex and an 8 - nucleotide - long rna - dna heteroduplex separated by two unpaired dna bases ( kulbachinskiy et al. , 2004 ) ( figure s3a ) .
thus , the ms probe lacks the consensus promoter dna sequences recognized by sigma70 .
the addition of alpha32p - utp to the esigma70 - ms probe complex results in the synthesis of a nine - nucleotide - long alpha32p - utp - labeled rna product , hereafter called rna - u ( kulbachinskiy et al. , 2004 ) .
as shown in figure 4a , lanes 1 and 2 , gp2 inhibits the synthesis of rna - u from the esigma70 - ms probe complex by preventing esigma70 from binding to the ms probe ( see also figure s3b , lanes 1 - 4 ) .
in contrast , and as expected , the addition of gp2 to the preformed esigma70 - ms probe complex had relatively little effect on the amount of rna - u synthesized ( figure 4a , lane 3 ) .
under identical conditions , when esigma70deltar1.1 was used , no inhibition of rna - u synthesis by gp2 was observed ( figure 4a , lanes 4 - 6 ) .
the in trans addition of the isolated r1.1 domain to esigma70deltar1.1 conferred a significant degree of gp2 sensitivity upon the esigma70deltar1.1 - dependent transcription from the ms probe ( figure 4b , lane 4 ) .
further , in the absence of sigma70 , the catalytic activity of core rnap on the ms probe was unaffected by gp2 ( figure s3c ) .
in summary , the results obtained with the ms probe corroborate the view that full inhibition of esigma70 rpo formation by gp2 depends on sigma70 ( specifically the r1.1 domain ) but occurs independently of the consensus promoter dna elements .
inhibition of rpo formation by gp2 involves a long - range , r1.1 - dependent , antagonistic effect on esigma70 - promoter interactions in the rpc , the promoter dna does not interact with the dwdbc , and consistent with previous results , rpc formation is not inhibited by gp2 ( camara et al. , 2010 ; mekler et al. , 2011b ) .
we next conducted experiments to investigate whether the binding of gp2 to the beta ' jaw domain influences rnap - promoter interaction outside of the dwdbc during rpo formation , and determine what role ( if any ) r1.1 plays in this process .
we conducted electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays ( emsas ) to determine whether esigma70 binding to shortened versions of the sigma70 - dependent lacuv5 , lambdapr3 , and t7a1 promoter probes truncated at position - 7 of both strands ( the - 7 / - 7 probes ) is inhibited by gp2 .
note that the - 7 / - 7 probes contain the - 35 and - 10 consensus promoter dna elements recognized by sigma70 regions 4.2 and 2.4 , respectively , and lack the dwdna segment .
the results reveal that the binding of esigma70 to the - 7 / - 7 probes is not inhibited by gp2 ( figure 5a , lanes 3 and 4 , and figure s4a ) , and are thus consistent with the view that interactions between the rnap and the promoter in the rpc are not affected by gp2 .
in contrast , under identical conditions , the binding of esigma70 to the corresponding + 20 /+ 20 probes is abolished by gp2 , as expected ( figure 5a , lanes 1 and 2 , and figure s4a ) .
we next determined the minimum length of the promoter template at which inhibition by gp2 starts to occur .
to that end , we extended the lacuv5 - 7 / - 7 probe in one - basepair increments and monitored the gp2 sensitivity of complex formation with these probes by emsa .
the results show that binding of esigma70 to the - 2 / - 2 probe is reduced by 50 % in the presence of gp2 , and binding of esigma70 to the - 1 / - 1 and + 1 /+ 1 probes is inhibited by 85 % and 100 % , respectively ( figure 5b and figure s4b ) .
because the site of gp2 binding , the beta ' jaw , is located downstream of the + 1 position , the inhibitory effect of gp2 evidently extends beyond the inhibition of dwdna interactions with the beta ' jaw during rpo formation ( see above ) .
in support of the above view , whereas inhibition of esigma70 binding to the + 20 /+ 20 dna depends on the order of addition , gp2 inhibited the binding of esigma70 to the + 1 /+ 1 probe independently of the order of addition ( figure 5c ; compare lanes 1 - 3 and 4 - 6 ) .
the order of addition - independent inhibitory effect of gp2 on the binding of esigma70 to the + 1 /+ 1 probe is specific , because the binding of esigma70 to the + 1 /+ 1 probe is not inhibited by an rnap - binding mutant of gp2 ( r56e ) ( camara et al. , 2010 ) ( figure s4c ) .
the binding of gp2 to the beta ' jaw per se was not the cause of inhibition of esigma70 binding to the + 1 /+ 1 probe , because esigma70 bound the + 1 /+ 1 probe in the presence of a gp2 mutant ( mut7 ) that binds rnap normally but is functionally attenuated ( sheppard et al. , 2011 ) ( figure s4c ) .
furthermore , the inhibitory effect of gp2 was markedly reduced when rnap containing sigma70 lacking r1.1 was used to bind the + 1 /+ 1 probe ( figure 5d , lanes 3 and 4 ) and , as expected , was partially restored when the isolated r1.1 domain was added in trans to this reaction ( figure 5d , lanes 5 and 6 ) .
overall , we conclude that inhibition of the rpo formation by gp2 also involves a long - range , r1.1 - dependent antagonistic effect on esigma70 interactions with dna around the rnap active center .
gp2 interferes with the promoter dna template strand accessing the rnap active center we next wanted to determine the effect of gp2 on esigma70 binding to variants of the - 7 / - 7 lacuv5 probe with either template or nontemplate single - strand downstream extensions to position + 20 ( - 7 /+ 20 or + 20 / - 7 promoter probes , respectively ; recall that rpo formation on the + 20 /+ 20 probe is efficiently inhibited by gp2 ) .
the emsa results reveal that gp2 had no detectable effect on the binding of esigma70 to either of these probes ( figure 5e ) .
to determine whether the rnap active site can access the + 1 position on the template strand of the - 7 /+ 20 probe in the presence of gp2 , we performed transcription - initiation assays .
the results , shown in figure 5f , indicate that even though gp2 does not inhibit the binding of esigma70 to this probe ( figure 5e , lanes 1 - 3 ) , the synthesis of the apapupu transcript is effectively abolished in the presence of gp2 .
the inhibitory effect of gp2 on transcription from the - 7 /+ 20 probe is r1.1 dependent : apapupu transcript synthesis by esigma70deltar1.1 is not inhibited by gp2 ( figure 5g , lanes 3 and 4 ) , whereas the in trans addition of the isolated r1.1 domain to esigma70deltar1.1 - containing reactions abolishes apapupu synthesis ( figure 5g , lane 5 ) .
therefore , we conclude that the rnap active center cannot productively access the template strand of the - 7 /+ 20 promoter probe when gp2 is bound to the beta ' jaw domain .
this conclusion is consistent with the view that the binding of gp2 to the beta ' jaw has a long - range , r1.1 .
- mediated antagonistic effect on esigma70 - promoter interactions near the rnap active center .
in other words , it seems that the binding of gp2 to the beta ' jaw in esigma70 restricts single - stranded dna from accessing the rnap active center in an r1.1 - dependent manner .
gp2 appropriates r1.1 to efficiently inhibit rpo formation by esigma70 previously , mekler et al .
( 2002 ) showed that fret can be used to monitor the displacement of r1.1 from near the dwdbc in free esigma70 to the tip of the beta pincer in the rpo ( see introduction ) .
because gp2 efficiently inhibits transcription initiation in an r1.1 - dependent manner , we wanted to determine whether gp2 antagonizes the obligatory displacement of r1.1 during rpo formation .
initially , we calculated the distance between r1.1 and the rnap active center by measuring fret between a fluorescein probe incorporated at amino acid position 36 in sigma70 r1.1 ( hereafter called sigma70 *) and rifampicin ( rif ) , an antibiotic that binds rnap between the upstream and downstream lobes of the beta subunit and effectively quenches the fluorescence in esigma70 * ( figure s5a and figure 6a ; compare lines labeled esigma70 * and [ esigma70 * - rif ]) .
as expected , the quenching efficiency is much lower in the rpo formed on the n25cons promoter than with esigma70 * ( figure 6a ; compare lines labeled esigma70 * and [ esigma70 *+ rif ] with lines labeled esigma70 *+ n25cons and [ esigma70 * - rif ]+ n25cons , respectively ) , thus indicating displacement of r1.1 from near the dwdbc upon rpo formation .
in control experiments in which rif was replaced with the colorless rnap inhibitor sorangicin - a ( sor ) , which binds rnap in the rif - binding site ( campbell et al. , 2005 ) , no influence on the fluorescence of the fluorescein probe attached to position 36 in r1.1 was detected ( figure s5b ; compare lines esigma70 * and [ esigma70 * - sor ]) .
further , the addition of rif to the preformed esigma70 *+ sor complex also resulted in a negligible decrease in fluorescence intensity ( figure s5b ; compare lines [ esigma70 * - sor ] and [ esigma70 * - sor ]+ rif ) .
thus , the rif - mediated decrease in fluorescence intensity of the fluorescein probe attached to amino acid position 36 in r1.1 is specific to the binding of rif and is a consequence of quenching via the fret mechanism .
the addition of gp2 caused an ~ 13 % decrease in the fluorescence intensity of esigma70 * ( figure 6b ; compare lines labeled esigma70 * and esigma70 *+ gp2 ) , suggesting that the binding of gp2 to the beta ' jaw domain changes the microenvironment of r1.1 and / or its positions with respect to the rnap active center .
these effects result from specific gp2 binding to the beta ' jaw domain , because no change in fluorescence spectra was observed in the presence of the r56e gp2 mutant ( sheppard et al. , 2011 ) , which does not bind to the rnap ( compare figure s5c and figure 6b ) .
the calculated distances between the fluorescein probe attached to amino acid position 36 in r1.1 and rif are 41 a and 65 a in esigma70 * and rpo , respectively ( figure 6c ) .
however , in the [ esigma70 * - rif ]+ gp2 complex , this distance is longer than in the [ esigma70 * - rif ] complex by 9 a ( figure 6c ) .
when the n25cons probe is added to the [ esigma70 * - rif ]+ gp2 complex , the calculated distance between fluorescein at amino acid position 36 in r1.1 and rif is 53 a ( figure 6b , compare lines labeled [ esigma70 * - rif ]+ gp2 and [ esigma70 * - rif ]+ gp2 + n25cons , and figure 6c ) .
in contrast , as mentioned above , when the n25cons probe is added to the [ esigma70 * - rif ] complex ( i.e. , in the absence of gp2 ) , the corresponding calculated distance is 65 a ( figure 6a , compare lines labeled [ esigma70 * - rif ] and [ esigma70 * - rif ]+ n25cons , and figure 6c ) .
thus , gp2 reduces the distance of r1.1 displacement during rpo formation by 12 a. this effect is specific , because no change in fluorescence spectra was observed in control experiments with r56e gp2 mutant ( compare figure s5c and figure 6b ) .
because esigma70 forms a complex with the n25cons promoter , which contains gp2 and bears some hallmarks of the rpo formed in the absence of gp2 ( see introduction ) , our results indicate that ternary ( esigma70 - gp2 - n25cons promoter ) complex formation is not accompanied by the characteristic long - distance displacement of r1.1 that normally occurs during rpo formation ( figures 6a and 6c ) .
to avoid a possible error related to uncertainty of the rif - fluorescein distance determination ( knight et al. , 2005 ) , we performed control experiments conducted with fluorescein probe attached to a different position in r1.1 ( amino acid 59 ) , which further corroborated our conclusion ( figure 6c and figure s5e ) .
when the n25cons probe is added to the [ esigma7059 * - rif ]+ gp2 complex , the calculated distance between the fluorescein at amino acid position 59 in r1.1 and rif is 40 a ( figure s5f , compare lines labeled [ esigma7059 * - rif ]+ gp2 and [ esigma7059 * - rif ]+ gp2 + n25cons , and figure 6c ) .
in contrast , when the n25cons probe is added to the [ esigma7059 * - rif ] complex ( i.e. , in the absence of gp2 ) , the corresponding calculated distance is 61 a ( figure s5e , compare lines labeled [ esigma7059 * - rif ] and [ esigma7059 * - rif ]+ n25cons , and figure 6c ) .
thus , gp2 appropriates r1.1 to efficiently inhibit rpo formation by esigma70 .
discussion the interaction between dwdna and dwdbc in the rnap is important for establishing the rpo for transcription initiation at bacterial promoters .
the ec rnap beta ' jaw domain , a pivotal feature of the dwdbc , is a multifunctional domain whose role in transcription extends beyond rpo formation ( ederth et al. , 2006 ) .
in previous studies , ederth et al .
( 2006 ) and our group ( wigneshweraraj et al. , 2006 ) showed that the beta ' jaw domain is involved in regulatory interplay with other parts of the rnap that extend to the distally located nascent rna - binding site .
in vitro , deletion of the beta ' jaw domain in the ec rnap destabilizes rpo , suppresses transcriptional pausing , increases the overall elongation rate , and decreases intrinsic termination ( ederth et al. , 2002 , 2006 ) .
here , we have demonstrated that the beta ' jaw domain makes sequence - nonspecific contacts with dsdna .
ec rnap mutants with the g1161r mutation or the deletion of residues 1149 - 1190 in the beta ' jaw domain form rpo with significantly reduced half - lives compared with rpo formed by the wild - type rnap .
our data provide an explanation for the observed phenotypes of the mutant rnap in a structural context : ( 1 ) the beta ' jaw domain residues that undergo significant chemical shift changes upon interaction with dsdna ( t1169 , r1174 , and m1180 ) are all located within the deleted region ( i.e. , 1149 - 1190 ) , and ( 2 ) the invariant g1161 residue ( figure s1a ) is located in the beta1 sheet of the beta ' jaw domain structure and is facing away from the dna - binding surface toward the beta ' insertion 6 domain ; thus , an arginine side chain at this position could compromise the overall structural integrity of the dwdbc .
during t7 phage infection of ec , the sequence - nonspecific interaction between the beta ' jaw domain and dsdna is subject to regulation by the small , non - dna - binding t7 transcription factor gp2 , which inhibits rpo formation by the host rnap .
one strategy used by gp2 to inhibit rpo formation by the host rnap is to sterically occlude dsdna from binding to the beta ' jaw domain by competing with dsdna for overlapping interaction surfaces on the beta ' jaw domain .
the narrow width of the dwdbc observed in structures of the bacterial rnap is thought to constrain the entry of dna into the catalytic cleft of rnap for rpo formation .
an obligatory step during rpo formation at sigma70 - dependent promoters is the displacement of the r1.1 domain of sigma70 from near the dwdbc to the tip of the beta pincer , which occurs concomitantly with the loading of dna in the dbc / dwdbc .
the negatively charged r1.1 domain is believed to act as a molecular placeholder for dsdna in esigma70 ; therefore , the displacement of r1.1 would facilitate the loading of dwdna into the dwdbc and subsequently stabilize the formation of rpo ( mekler et al. , 2002 ) .
thus , it was proposed that r1.1 can facilitate dna entry into the dwdbc by holding the beta and beta ' pincers open so that the promoter dna can enter the dwdbc and the template promoter strand can access the rnap active center ( saecker et al. , 2011 ) .
our results demonstrate that r1.1 of sigma70 has an important functional role in the mechanism by which gp2 inhibits rpo formation at sigma70 - dependent promoters .
consistent with this view , gp2 inhibits rpo formation by rnap containing alternative sigma factors such as sigma38 or sigma54 less efficiently or not detectably , respectively ( see above ) ( wigneshweraraj et al. , 2004 ) .
we envisage a model in which gp2 repositions r1.1 ( see below ) and / or stabilizes r1.1 so that it can no longer be displaced to the tip of the beta pincer .
this would allow rpo to form and thus stall the esigma70 - promoter complex in an intermediate state ( intermediate promoter complex [ rpi ] in figure 6d ) at sigma70 - dependent promoters .
furthermore , the extended negatively charged patch in the dwdbc that results upon binding of gp2 to the beta ' jaw domain could thus help electrostatically reposition r1.1 and / or mimic the presence of r1.1 in the dwdbc .
in support of the former view , the removal of the negatively charged side chains of the amino acids in gp2 that contribute to the ncs does not affect the affinity of gp2 to the rnap or its overall structural integrity , but it does severely decrease its ability to inhibit rpo formation ( sheppard et al. , 2011 ) .
intriguingly , the r1.1 - dependent inhibitory effect of gp2 on the binding of dwdna to the beta ' jaw domain extends beyond the dwdbc and has long - range antagonistic effects on esigma70 - promoter interactions that extend up to the rnap active center .
as a consequence , esigma70 - promoter dna interactions become stalled en route to the rpo ( figure 6d ) .
because not even single - stranded dna can access the active center of the rnap in the presence of gp2 , it seems that gp2 when bound to the beta ' jaw domain restricts the conformational flexibility and changes in the rnap that normally accompany rpo formation .
because the interaction between gp2 and the isolated beta ' jaw domain fragment is several orders of magnitude weaker than that between gp2 and the whole enzyme , we cannot exclude the possibility that gp2 undergoes positional rearrangements and makes additional contacts with the other domains of the rnap that surround the dwdbc , notably the beta ' insertion 6 and / or the beta downstream lobe domains .
it is therefore likely that the solution structure of the gp2 - beta ' jaw fragment likely reports on an early encounter complex between gp2 and rnap .
the biological role of gp2 is to inhibit the transcription of early t7 genes from strong sigma70 - dependent promoters present on the t7 genome by the host rnap ( savalia et al. , 2010 ) .
the absence of gp2 results in unsuccessful infection because the antiterminated host rnap moves into regions of the t7 genome that are normally transcribed by the t7 rnap .
the interference of the fast - moving t7 rnap , which is responsible for the transcription of middle and late t7 genes , by the slow - moving host rnap results in aberrant packaging of concatemeric viral dna into virion heads , and thus unsuccessful infection .
the two - pronged strategy used by gp2 to inhibit the host rnap , through occlusion of dwdna from binding to the dwdbc and appropriation of a sigma70 - specific domain , leads to highly efficient inhibition of esigma70 - dependent transcription from very strong early t7 promoters to ensure successful infection .
the inhibition of host rnap by gp2 thus defines an as yet uncharacterized mechanism by which bacterial transcription is regulated by a nonbacterial factor .

in vitro transcription assays in vitro transcription assays were conducted essentially as previously described ( camara et al. , 2010 ) .
reactions ( 10 mul ) were conducted using final concentrations of 100 nm esigma70 , 20 nm unlabeled promoter dna probes , 0.5 mm dinucleotide primer apa , 100 mug / ml heparin , and 3 muci of [ alpha - 32p ] - utp ( for lacuv5 ) or [ alpha - 32p ] - atp and 0.5 mum ctp ( for osme ) .
unless otherwise indicated , gp2 and esigma70 ( at a 2:1 molar ratio ) were always preincubated before the promoter dna was added to the reaction .
when present , r1.1 was always preincubated with esigma70deltar1.1 ( at the indicated amounts ) before addition of gp2 and / or promoter dna to the reaction .
the reactions were resolved on a 20 % ( w / v ) urea - denaturing polyacrylamide gel .
the dried gel was visualized and quantified with the use of an fla - 5000 phosphorimager .
native gel mobility assays all native mobility shift assays were conducted essentially as described previously ( camara et al. , 2010 ) .
binding reactions ( 10 mul ) were set up as described above .
fret assays fluorescence emission spectra of esigma70 reconstituted with sigma70 subunit labeled at position 36 or 59 with fluorescein ( sigma70 *) were recorded with 482 excitation as previously described ( knight et al. , 2005 ) .
when present , rif and sor ( at 1 mum ) were incubated with esigma70 * for 10 min at 37degreesc .
the esigma70 - gp2 complex was obtained by incubation of 1 nm esigma70 and 200 nm gp2 for 10 min at 37degreesc .
promoter complexes were obtained by incubation of 1 nm esigma70 or esigma70 - gp2 with 5 nm n25cons for 15 min at 37degreesc .
the fret efficiency , critical fret radius ( r0 ) , and distance between fluorescein and rif were determined as previously described ( knight et al. , 2005 ) .
a previous analysis of the accuracy of similar fret - based measurements of distances between esigma70 - bound rif and fluorescein incorporated at different positions in sigma70 indicated that the uncertainty of such a distance determination is 11 % - 25 % , with a mean of 15 % ( knight et al. , 2005 ) .

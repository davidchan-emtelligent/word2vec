mutant p53 gains new function in promoting inflammatory signals by repression of the secreted interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist p53 tumor microenvironment inflammation antagonist receptors cytokines the microenvironment of solid tumors is composed of malignant cells surrounded by a reactive stroma containing extracellular matrix with a huge infiltration of non - malignant populations ( myeloid cells , lymphocytes , fibroblast , endothelial cells ) , which together with several cytokines / chemokines , tissue remodelling and angiogenesis support an inflammatory milieu .
tumor growth and metastasis are the result of a complex bidirectional interaction between cells that progressively acquire molecular alterations , and a transformed phenotype ( cell - autonomous functions ) and the surrounding host cells ( non - cell - autonomous functions ) .
the tp53 gene is mutated in about half of all human cancers .
missense mutations are the most prevalent alterations ( 75 %) located mainly within the dna binding domain .
most of these alterations hold the full - length protein , often present in grossly elevated levels compared to the wild type ( wt ) p53 in normal cells , that lose the tumor suppressor functions ( loss - of - function , lof ) , and acquire novel functions ( gain - of - function , gof ) through which contribute to tumorigenesis , tumor progression and chemo - or radiotherapy resistance .
in recent years many cell - autonomous gofs mutant ( mut ) p53 have been described , mostly linked to the ability of mutated proteins to control the expression of specific target genes [ 1 ] .
noteworthy , emerging evidences uncovered the existence of non - cell - autonomous wtp53 functions by promoting anti - tumor microenvironment [ 2 , 3 ] , whereas barely reported the non - cell - autonomous gofs mutp53 [ 4 ] .
we previously demonstrated that inducible depletion in vivo of endogenous mutp53 reduces tumor growth , stromal invasion , and angiogenesis in xenografted ht29 colon cancer cells [ 5 ] .
founded on these results we enquired whether gofs mutp53 might be involved in the tumor microenvironment ( tme ) crosstalk .
to this aim we analysed the cytokine secretion profile in a panel of colon and breast human cancer cells , and identified the soluble interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist ( sil - 1ra ) as a novel mutp53 repressed target gene [ 6 ] .
the sil - 1ra is a natural occurring anti - inflammatory cytokine that acts as a specific antagonist of the interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) alpha and beta pro - inflammatory cytokines : it binds to both type i and type ii il - 1 receptors ( il - 1r1 and il - 1rii ) , with approximately equal affinity as compared with il - 1alpha and il - 1beta , without exerting any agonist activity .
the il - 1beta is a highly active and pleiotropic pro - inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammation - associated diseases .
indeed , recombinant sil - 1ra ( kineret ) is currently used to cure a number of inflammatory and orthopaedic disease .
importantly , the il - 1beta expression is found elevated in several human tumors ( breast , colon , lung , head and neck , and melanomas ) , and patients with il - 1beta producing tumors have generally bad prognosis .
we found that mutp53 represses whereas activated wtp53 induces sil - 1ra gene expression uncovering a novel gof mutp53 [ 6 ] .
mechanistically , we identify the maff as common molecular player in the opposite regulation of sil - 1ra gene expression by mut and wtp53 [ 6 ] .
indeed , the small mafs abundance has been identified as a fine tuning molecular switch regulating positively or negatively gene expression .
to evaluate the biological significance of sil - 1ra suppression in gof mutp53 , we explored the cancer cell response to recombinant il - 1beta along with mutp53 depletion or kineret pre - treatment .
results revealed that similarly to pre - treatment with recombinant sil - 1ra , the derepressed sil - 1ra in mutp53 depleted cells , hampers the il - 1beta signalling cascade by reducing il - 1 target genes expression in vitro and in vivo ; the cancer cell proliferation in vitro ; and the growth of xenografted tumor in lps - treated mice .
additionally , the supernatants of either mutp53 depleted or kineret pretreated cancer cells abolishes the il - 1beta - induced huvec endothelial cell monolayer permeability , a hallmark of early angiogenesis [ 6 ] .
the study shown for the first time the existence of a functional link between sil - 1ra and mutp53 , adding further insights for the identification of novel non - cell - autonomous gofs mutp53 in human cancer .
thus , mutp53 by repressing sil - 1ra could sustain a prompt il - 1beta cancer cell response promoting a chronically inflamed tme , hence fostering further malignancy .
noteworthy , chronic - inflammation is a predisposing cause in various malignancies and is often characterized as the seventh hallmark of cancer [ 7 ] .
recent investigations reported that mutp53 sustains cancer progression by augmenting nuclear factor kappab ( nfkappab ) activation in the context of chronic inflammation in vitro and in vivo [ 8 ] .
the nfkappab is a required transcription factor for canonical il - 1 target genes expression .
accordingly , we propose that mutp53 might support a ready - to - be - activated il - 1 signalling cascade in cancer cells through a dual regulatory path : - extracellularly by suppressing the sil - 1ra production , thus reducing the relative protein levels of the receptor antagonist in the microenvironment nearby the cancer cells ; - intracellularly increasing the il - 1 target gene expression augmenting nfkb activity .
remarkably , preclinical studies provide ample support to propose the reduction of il - 1 activity as a potential therapeutic target in human cancers .
accordingly , albeit further investigations are required , achieved results are suggesting that modulation of the tme through the targeting of il - 1 activity combined with currently used chemotherapeutic agents might constitute a novel efficient anti - tumoral strategy for treating mutp53 carrying tumors .

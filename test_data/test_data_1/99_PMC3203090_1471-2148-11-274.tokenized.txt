background schmidtea mediterranea ( platyhelminthes , tricladida , continenticola ) is found in scattered localities on a few islands and in coastal areas of the western mediterranean .
although s. mediterranea is the object of many regeneration studies , little is known about its evolutionary history .
its present distribution has been proposed to stem from the fragmentation and migration of the corsica - sardinia microplate during the formation of the western mediterranean basin , which implies an ancient origin for the species .
to test this hypothesis , we obtained a large number of samples from across its distribution area .
using known and new molecular markers and , for the first time in planarians , a molecular clock , we analysed the genetic variability and demographic parameters within the species and between its sexual and asexual populations to estimate when they diverged .
results a total of 2 kb from three markers ( coi , cyb and a nuclear intron n13 ) was amplified from ~ 200 specimens .
molecular data clustered the studied populations into three groups that correspond to the west , central and southeastern geographical locations of the current distribution of s. mediterranea .
mitochondrial genes show low haplotype and nucleotide diversity within populations but demonstrate higher values when all individuals are considered .
the nuclear marker shows higher values of genetic diversity than the mitochondrial genes at the population level , but asexual populations present lower variability than the sexual ones .
neutrality tests are significant for some populations .
phylogenetic and dating analyses show the three groups to be monophyletic , with the west group being the basal group .
the time when the diversification of the species occurred is between ~ 20 and ~ 4 mya , although the asexual nature of the western populations could have affected the dating analyses .
conclusions s. mediterranea is an old species that is sparsely distributed in a harsh habitat , which is probably the consequence of the migration of the corsica - sardinia block .
this species probably adapted to temperate climates in the middle of a changing mediterranean climate that eventually became dry and hot .
these data also suggest that in the mainland localities of europe and africa , sexual individuals of s. mediterranea are being replaced by asexual individuals that are either conspecific or are from other species that are better adapted to the mediterranean climate .
background schmidtea mediterranea benazzi et al. , 1975 is a freshwater planarian ( order tricladida , suborder continenticola , phylum platyhelminthes ) that is mostly known to the scientific community for its capacity to regenerate ([ 1 - 3 ]) and has become a model organism for the functional analysis of the genes involved in pattern formation ( e.g. , [ 4 ]) .
nonetheless , little is known about its evolutionary history and demographics , although it possesses several intriguing features .
the genus schmidtea includes only four species : s. polychroa , s. lugubris , s. mediterranea and s. nova. with the exception of s. polychroa , which has either amphimictic diploid and / or parthenogenetic polyploid populations , most of the schmidtea species are amphimictic diploids .
in s. mediterranea , in addition to the more common sexual amphimictic diploids , a third type of reproduction , asexual fissiparity [ 5 ] , occurs in diploid populations bearing a heteromorphic translocation between 1st and 3rd chromosomes ( only one chromosome of each pair is affected by the translocation ) [ 6 - 8 ] .
although fissiparity is also common in other genera of planarians , such as girardia [ 9 ] and dugesia [ 10 ] , most asexual fissiparous populations of these genera are triploid. s. mediterranea is restricted to the western mediterranean in several scattered populations along the catalan coast , menorca , mallorca , corsica , sardinia , sicily and tunisia [ 6 - 8,11,12 ] ( figure 1 ) .
the asexual strain occurs only in a few locations , in catalonia and the balearic islands , where sexual populations have not yet been found .
in the remaining distribution area , only sexual diploids are found , with the only exceptions being a triploid sexual population in sardinia [ 13 ] and a triploid asexual ( fissiparous ) population in menorca , the latter bearing a translocation between the 1st and 3rd chromosomes ( only one of each triplet ) [ 7 ] .
figure 1 distribution of the species and haplotype distribution in populations .
each map corresponds to a single gene : coi ( a ) , cyb ( b ) and n13 ( c ) .
pie charts indicate the proportion of the different haplotypes in each of the eleven populations .
colours and names of the haplotypes correspond to those indicated in the haplotype networks ( figure 2 ) .
dotted lines show the geographical regions obtained in the samova analysis for 3 groups : west ( w ) , central ( c ) and southeast ( s ) .
this peculiar geographical distribution prompted baguna et al .
[ 14 ] and de vries et al .
[ 11 ] to propose , according to the known geological history of the area at the time , that this was the result of microplate fragmentation and migration during the formation of the western mediterranean basin .
indeed , the fragmentation of continental microplates ( the corsica - sardinia block , csb ) and their clockwise and counterclockwise migration gave rise , during the oligocene and early miocene periods , to the balearic islands , corsica , sardinia , calabria and the kabilies in algeria [ 15 - 18 ] .
if this hypothesis is true , it implies that this species , or a close ancestor , was already present on the microplate before it first broke away , approximately 30 mya , splitting the csb from the spanish coast .
the poor dispersion capability of freshwater planarians ( they require permanent freshwater courses or ponds , and no forms resistant to desiccation have been described ) and their impossibility to cross large marine masses , make other explanations ( e.g. , human or animal transport or recent colonisation ) less plausible .
although a clear link between csb fragmentation and migration and the successive speciation events has been demonstrated for other groups of animals [ 19 - 21 ] , the case of s. mediterranea is unique because a correlation between geological events and its distribution has not been linked to any speciation event , which implies a more ancient origin for s. mediterranea .
furthermore , when and how the asexual populations of s. mediterranea originated is also of considerable interest because no conspecific sexual individuals live in the same localities , the nearest populations being found in sardinia and corsica .
this situation suggests multiple possible explanations for when and where they originated .
asexual s. mediterranea could have originated from sardinian sexual populations a long time ago and remained isolated in the current area of distribution ; they could have originated recently and have been transported by humans ; or they could have a recent or ancient origin from sexual spanish populations that are now extinct .
altogether , these ideas pose several interesting questions : 1 ) is the microplate fragmentation the origin of the present distribution of s. mediterranea ?
2 ) what is the age of this species ?
3 ) when and where did the asexual strain appear ?
4 ) which sexual population is closest to the asexual ones ?
5 ) did the new asexual populations outcompete the original sexual populations , or did they originate in other regions and were brought to their current localities by human transport ?
to answer these questions and to widen our knowledge on the evolutionary history of s. mediterranea , a well - resolved phylogeny is first needed .
molecular phylogenies are currently the best option to provide solid evidence on the origin , relationships and divergence in time among populations , particularly for organisms such as planarians , which are lacking reliable morphological characteristics .
furthermore , if these events can be correlated to some geological phenomena , a molecular clock can be set and calibrated , and the evolutionary history can be put into a temporal context .
finally , a comparative analysis of the genetic ( nucleotide ) variability within and among populations may allow us to identify the evolutionary factors responsible for the levels and patterns of genetic variation and therefore for the biological diversity [ 22 ] .
we have sequenced fragments of two mitochondrial genes ( one for the first time in planarians ) , and taking into account the genomic information available for s. mediterranea , we developed a new nuclear marker for planarians .
because nuclear and mitochondrial markers accumulate changes at different rates , they provide complementary information on the effects of different types of factors , namely , those affecting different historical times .
using these markers , we measured the levels of genetic variation among and within all populations sampled and inferred the phylogenetic tree for these species .
in addition , we have calibrated , for the first time in planarians , a molecular clock to estimate the age of the species and the divergence among populations .
the results obtained show the usefulness of the new markers and attest that the phylogeography and evolutionary history of s. mediterranea is far more complex than formerly envisaged .
methods sampling , dna extraction , gene amplification and sequencing samples covering all known distributions of s. mediterranea ( table 1 ) were collected between 2006 and 2009 .
described populations from mallorca [ 23 ] and north of catalonia [ 7 ] could not be recovered .
sampling in morocco and algeria retrieved a population of s. polychroa , but no s. mediterranea was found .
the populations from spain , corsica and tunisia are the only populations described in the literature for those regions and were found during the present project sampling ; no new populations have been found .
populations collected from tunisia , corsica , sardinia and sicily were identified as s. mediterranea by karyological analyses using standard procedures [ 24 ] .
altogether , a total of 217 specimens were collected from 11 localities .
high molecular weight dna was purified from live or ethanol - fixed specimens individually using dnazol reagent ( molecular research center inc , cincinnati , oh ) .
specific primers ( table 2 ) , some designed for this study , were used to amplify partial fragments of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase i ( coi ) and cytochrome b ( cyb ) .
we also searched for new nuclear markers , and based on sequences provided to us by other researchers ( abril , j. , adell , t. and cebria , f. ) , we designed primers to amplify and perform sequence analyses of different introns from the genes glycogen synthase kinase 3 and the netrin receptor - like protein ( netr ) .
the intron of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 gene was very short (~ 50 bp ) and showed low variability ; thus , only a partial region of the 13th intron of the netrin receptor - like protein gene ( n13 ) was selected because it is the only fragment with the length and variability adequate for the proposed studies .
amplification products were sequenced directly with the same primers used in the pcr reaction using big dye ( 3.1 , applied biosystems , norwalk , ct , usa ) and an automated sequencer , abi prism 3730 applied biosystems / hitachi ( unitat de genomica dels serveis cientifico - tecnics de la ub ) .
dna sequences were aligned with clustalw [ 25 ] and optimised by sight using the amino acidic sequence as a guide for mitochondrial genes .

cloning some individuals were heterozygous for the nuclear gene n13 ( table 3 ) .
the haplotype phases were reconstructed using the phase algorithm [ 26,27 ] included in dnasp v5 [ 28 ] .
the pcr products of six individuals , two belonging to the bar _ mon population and four from the sic _ maz population , were cloned and sequenced to test the conflicting haplotypes obtained with phase .
the pcr products were purified with a vacuum manifold and then cloned using the htp topo ta cloning kit for sequencing ( invitrogen , california , usa ) .
eight colonies from each individual were amplified and sequenced using the t3 and t7 primers ( included in the kit ) following the procedure described in the previous section .

population genetics analyses we used the program dnasp v5.10 [ 28 ] to conduct most of the population genetic analyses .
haplotype diversity ( hd ) and nucleotide diversity ( pi ) [ 29 ] were estimated for every population and gene .
genotype diversity for n13 was calculated by using the hd formula [ 29 ] and replacing haplotypes with genotypes .
the coi , cyb and n13 haplotype networks were constructed using tcs v1.21 [ 30 ] .
we used spatial analysis of molecular variance ( samova v1.0 [ 31 ]) to define groups of populations , and we tested every gene for 2 , 3 and 4 groups .
this method is based on a simulated annealing procedure aimed at identifying groups of populations that are geographically homogeneous and maximally differentiated in terms of an among - group component of the overall genetic variance without the prior assumption of group composition that is necessary for amova .
the levels of divergence between s. polychroa and s. mediterranea and within and between the new groups were estimated using the dxy parameter [ 29 ] .
the non - coding region of n13 presented high sequence variability between s. polychroa and s. mediterranea , so only a fragment of 191 bp could be unambiguously aligned to calculate the divergence ( k ) between the two species .
gene flow statistics fst and the corresponding nm were estimated for the three regions defined by samova .
a genetic differentiation statistic , snn , was estimated , and its statistical significance was determined using a permutation test ( 10,000 replicates ) .
to determine if the pattern of the polymorphism for the n13 fragment conforms to that expected under the neutral hypothesis , we applied two neutrality tests to detect the specific fingerprint of recent population expansions , heavy bottlenecks or other selective and demographic scenarios : tajima 's d [ 32 ] and r2 [ 33 ] .
these statistics were selected because they are not sensitive to the haplotype phase reconstruction and r2 has the advantage of behaving well for small sample sizes .
their statistical significance was estimated using coalescent computer simulations ( 10,000 replicates ) .
phylogeny and the molecular clock all maximum likelihood ( ml ) phylogenetic analyses were determined using phyml 3.0 [ 34 ] with the hky model and 1000 bootstrap replicates .
bayesian inference ( bi ) was estimated using either with mrbayes 3.1 [ 35,36 ] or beast 1.6.1 [ 37 ] .
because the fossil record of freshwater planarians is non - existent , no molecular clock for the tricladida is available .
hence , to calibrate the molecular clock and to infer the approximate age of schmidtea mediterranea , we used two - step dating .
first , an analysis with a partial sequence of the coi gene ( 309 bp ) , which belongs to 19 species of the families dugesiidae and planariidae ( additional file 1 ) , was performed .
before running the dating analysis , we ran phylogenetic analyses for the short coi fragment using ml and bi ( mrbayes , gtr with invgamma , 106 generations with sampling every 103 and a burnin value of 10 %) to test its resolution capability from the family to the species level .
then , we used beast with the following conditions : relaxed clock estimate , hky evolutionary model and yule process speciation , during 107 generations with sampling parameters every 103 and a 10 % burnin value for the final trees , as recommended in the beast manual .
we calibrated the data based on the biogeographical hypothesis proposed by ball ( 1974 ) [ 38 ] .
analysing the present day distribution of the dugesidae genera , ball suggested that the center of the origin of this family would have been situated in southern gondwanaland .
the breakage of this supercontinent , thus separating from what would become america to the west , would have resulted in the origin of the girardia genus ( exclusively american ) in that region , while the rest of the genera ( or their ancestors ) would have appeared in the eastern block ; dugesia and schmidtea ( currently present in africa , asia and europe ) would have originated in africa and europe , respectively , after their ancestors moved northward .
hence , we have used the split between the continents of africa and south america ( ending around 100 mya ) as a calibration point to determine the maximum age of the separation of the genera dugesia and schmidtea from the genus girardia .
in the second dating step , we used 192 sequences from the coi ( 920 bp ) and cyb ( 677 bp ) genes of s. mediterranea and the mean rate value obtained for coi in the previous analysis to determine the age of separation between the populations of s. mediterranea .
for this second analysis , which consisted of a comparison of populations from the same species , it was expected that the rates of evolution would not vary among populations .
hence , the conditions for the analysis were the following : strict clock , hky evolutionary model , coalescent model with constant population size for 108 generations , sampling every 104 generations and a burnin of 10 % .
in addition , a phylogenetic analysis with ml was performed to obtain boostrap support for the nodes .
results datasets for the coi and cyb sequences , we created two datasets for each gene : one for phylogenetic analyses and the other for population genetic studies .
for phylogenetic analyses , the coi alignment contained 216 sequences of 920 bp. cyb was more difficult to amplify , so the dataset contained only 193 sequences of 677 bp. however , the ends of some sequences , for both coi and cyb , were shorter because of sequencing difficulties and contained a series of ns. additionally , some coi gene sequences were amplified in two non - overlapping fragments , and this procedure resulted in a short region between them (~ 50 bp ) in which some individuals had unknown nucleotides .
in both cases , these sites were removed from the datasets for the rest of analyses .
this removal reduced the length of the coi dataset to 699 bp and of the cyb dataset to 598 bp. the nuclear fragment ( n13 , a non - coding region ) was used in population genetic analyses but not in phylogenetic inference analyses because its levels of polymorphism were high within the populations studied but low among them and , consequently , there was not enough information for the analyses at this level .
additionally , there were difficulties with amplification of n13 in some individuals and , hence , a single dataset was obtained with 177 sequences of 336 bp. levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity all nucleotide polymorphism results are shown in table 3 .
we found 8 haplotypes in the 216 coi sequences analysed [ genbank : jf837055 to jf837062 ] and 10 haplotypes in the 193 cyb sequences [ genbank : jf837045 to jf837054 ] .
for both genes , a single haplotype was found in 7 of the 11 populations studied .
for n13 , we found only two populations with a single allele , tun _ leb and sic _ mar , because the remaining populations had more than one allele and at least one heterozygous individual [ genbank : jf837063 to jf837081 ] .
we used the phase algorithm to reconstruct the alleles of n13 that were present in the heterozygous individuals in these populations .
phase results showed that the two populations with more heterozygous individuals ( bar _ mon and sic _ maz ) shared an allele .
because these two populations are geographically distant and differ in the presence / absence of the translocation and in their type of reproduction , we decided to clone the n13 pcr product of some individuals of each population to verify the existence of this common allele .
the sequences obtained ( additional file 2 ) showed that bar _ mon and sic _ maz do not share any allele .
the conflicting results between the phase outcome and the cloning experiments were most likely derived from the assumption of phase in which all of the individuals analysed belong to a single panmictic population in hardy - weinberg equilibrium , a situation that posterior analyses ( see below ) showed not to be the case here .
finally , for the 177 individuals analysed , after phase reconstruction and cloning verification , we found 14 alleles in the 354 n13 sequences .
taking all of the populations together , the haplotype diversity values were high and similar for the three genes ( 0.773 , 0.803 and 0.853 ) , whereas nucleotide diversity was much higher in the mitochondrial genes ( 0.0223 and 0.0168 ) than for the nuclear marker ( 0.0081 ) .
instead , haplotype and nucleotide diversity within the populations were lower for the mitochondrial genes than for the nuclear fragment ( table 3 ) .
the nuclear gene n13 showed very similar values of haplotype and nucleotide diversity within the populations ( table 3 ) , with the only exception being the two menorca asexual populations , which had nearly no variability .
additionally , the genotypic variability was also very low for the three asexual populations .
geographical division and genetic differentiation among and within geographical groups coi and cyb haplotype networks ( figure 2a and 2b ) show three well - differentiated groups that match the current geographical distribution of populations ( west , central and southeast of the known distribution ) ( figures 1a and 1b ) .
the n13 network does not at first glance show a clear division among the haplotypes ( figure 2c ) .
however , after using samova ( additional file 3 ) for n13 , we found three groups of populations with the same clustering as was found for the mitochondrial genes ( figure 1c ) .
accordingly , the groups obtained were named west ( w , populations from barcelona and menorca ) , central ( c , populations from sardinia and corsica ) and southeast ( s , populations from sicily and tunis ) .
when these groups were analysed using the snn statistical test , they were found to be significantly different .
moreover , the fst statistic was high , and the values for nm were very low for the three genes ( table 4 ) .
figure 2 gene haplotype networks .
each network corresponds to a single gene : coi ( a ) , cyb ( b ) and n13 ( c ) .
different textures represent the studied populations , and each coloured circle represents a haplotype found in the sample .
black dots represent intermediate ( non - present ) haplotypes , lines connecting haplotypes ( either existing or not ) represent one nucleotide change , the size of each circle is proportional to the haplotype frequency in the sample and the colours of the circles correspond to the three groups : w ( red ) , c ( blue ) and s ( green ) .

high fst and low nm values suggest that there is no gene flow among the three groups .
significant differences in the snn statistic shows the same result .
for the mitochondrial genes ( table 3 ) , the groups presented low nucleotide diversity ( pi ) with the sole exception of cyb from the s group .
in some cases ( s group coi , w and s cyb ) , the values of mitochondrial haplotype diversity ( hd ) for the groups were higher than those observed for the individual populations within them , which is indicative of differentiation among their populations .
the values of nucleotide and haplotype diversity for n13 were , in general , higher than those for the mitochondrial genes .
the average number of nucleotide substitutions per site ( k ) between s. polychroa and s. mediterranea were similar for the three genes ( 15 % for coi , 17 % for cyb and 14 % for n13 ; table 5 ) .
for mitochondrial genes , dxy values between populations and within each group ( w , c and s ) were much lower ( at least four times lower ) than among groups ( table 5 ) .
the highest dxy values among groups were situated at approximately 3.5 % , demonstrating a large gap between the higher intraspecific distances and the mean interspecific values ( 15 - 17 %) .
for n13 , this gap was more evident because the higher interpopulation distances were 1.4 % .

1these populations had only one haplotype .
significant differences in some populations suggest that the variability observed cannot be explained by the neutral hypothesis .
phylogeny and the molecular clock to test the phylogenetic informativeness of the short coi gene fragment before dating analysis , two phylogenetic analyses by ml and bi were performed .
both resulting trees were concordant with the accepted phylogeny for freshwater planarians [ 38 - 40 ] ( support values shown in the dating tree are in additional file 4 ) .
the analysis with beast of these data placed the time of the most recent common ancestor between s. mediterranea and s. polychroa at 43 mya ( between 72.23 and 24.96 mya , additional file 4 ) and the time of the most recent common ancestor ( tmrca ) of s. mediterranea between 19.55 and 5.9 mya .
the resulting dates for the divergence of dugesia cretica from the other two greek species ( d. ariadnae and dugesia sp. from peloponnese ) within dugesia and the divergence among occidental and oriental dugesia species are congruent with a geologically based biogeographical hypothesis [ 41,42 ] .
finally , the average rate of evolution calculated for the coi gene by beast for the whole tree is 0.0027 mutations per site per million years ( 0.27 % substitutions per million years ) , which implies a sequence divergence of 0.54 % per million years .
this is between one - half and one - fourth of the rate of 1 - 2 % , which is commonly used as a standard for mitochondrial genes ( mainly derived from arthropods [ 43 ]) in many studies .
however , similar low values have been found in other groups , e.g. , 0.67 - 0.95 % sequence divergence in molluscs of the arcidae family [ 44 ] .
while planarians have some of the lowest rates of substitution , this does not invalidate the dating results obtained .
using the mean rate obtained in the previous analysis ( 0.0027 ) , we performed the second dating analysis with the two mitochondrial genes .
the analysis included all individuals for which we obtained sequences of both mitochondrial genes .
the topology of the resulting tree within s. mediterranea was the same as that obtained in the previous analysis , and node ages and dating intervals between the three groups were consistent in both analyses ( figure 3 and additional file 4 ) .
w , c and s groups were monophyletic with high posterior probabilities in the bayesian analysis , and western populations appeared to be the basal group of the three groups .
the populations within the regions did not constitute monophyletic groups , with two exceptions : the individuals from tun _ leb ( brown in figure 3 ) constitute a monophyletic clade ( 1 pp / 79 bs ) buried within the s group , and this clade is a sister clade to some individuals from sic _ maz ; and the individuals from men _ mer ( orange in figure 3 ) also constitute a monophyletic clade ( 1 pp / 65 bs ) that is a sister clade to a clade that includes a mix of individuals from the other two populations of the w group .

discussion is schmidtea mediterranea a single species ?
the levels of genetic divergence found among all of the populations of s. mediterranea studied , which cover most of its current range of distribution , suggest that it is a single species .
this suggestion is based on the large gap between the higher genetic distance values obtained among s. mediterranea populations and those between the s. mediterranea populations and s. polychroa ( values of 0.035 for coi , 0.028 for cyb and 0.014 for n13 vs. the means of 0.15 , 0.17 and 0.14 , respectively ) .
furthermore , these values are within the range for other tricladida species .
in dugesia and microplana ( a freshwater and a terrestrial genus , respectively ) , the coi divergence within species is less than 0.04 , whereas among species it is greater than 0.10 - 0.12 [ 10,45 ] .
such differences are clearly visualised in the first phylogenetic dating analysis , which includes the other three schmidtea species ( additional file 4 ). s. mediterranea is genetically structured .
this is evident for the mitochondrial genes and , although not as clearly , for the nuclear intron as well .
the haplotype networks for both mitochondrial genes show three well - defined groups that are separated by a similar number of differences , and these groups correspond to the same three clades separated by deep nodes in the phylogenetic analyses ( figures 2 and 3 and additional file 3 ) .
the structure shown by the haplotype networks and phylogenetic trees is confirmed by the samova results , which show that the same three groups are the ones that best explain the genetic structure in relation to geographical distribution , in this case , for the three markers ( additional file 3 ) .
additionally , genetic differentiation analyses ( table 4 ) show that the three groups are significantly differentiated both for the mitochondrial and nuclear genes ( high fst values and a significant snn value ) .
the differences in genetic diversity patterns found between nuclear and mitochondrial markers generally result from differences in coalescence times between the two genomes .
the fact that in certain analyses the nuclear marker also detects the division into three groups supports the idea that this might be the result of an old isolation ; together with the observed lack of gene flow among populations , this finding could indicate that these groups are undergoing speciation or even constitute cryptic species ( although the reported inter - fertility among c and s individuals [ 46 ] makes this latter hypothesis less plausible ) .
the geographical distribution of schmidtea mediterranea : remnant of an old distribution driven by microplate dispersal or indicator of recent colonisations ?
the genetic structure found for s. mediterranea does not reflect a process of recent colonisation from one region to the others .
indeed , the genetic pattern found - - with significant differentiation among geographical groups and even among populations within each group ( polymorphism parameters show low levels of polymorphism within populations but high levels when all populations are considered together for mitochondrial genes , which reflects high differentiation among the populations ) - - indicates better an ancient differentiation among these three geographical groups and even within them .
moreover , the shape of the haplotype networks , which shows the groups to be equidistant , suggests that no region is central to the others .
altogether , these findings strongly suggest that the current distribution of s. mediterranea is a relic of the split from a former larger geographical distribution .
taking into account the phylogeny of s. mediterranea , could the fragmentation and migration of microplates be the sole reason for its current distribution ?
despite the evident complexities of the geology of the western mediterranean [ 16,17,47 ] , there is a general agreement on the original location of the microplates of corsica , sardinia , part of calabria , the balearic islands and both kabylies ( grande and petite ) , which form the csb , the region that separated from iberia and eurasia 30 mya .
in the first event , the southern assemblage , which included the balearic islands and the grande kabylie , broke off and moved clockwise from iberia , and the northern assemblage , which included corsica , sardinia , part of calabria and the petite kabylie , broke off and moved counter clockwise from eurasia .
next , the crucial event was the breakage between both assemblages that gave rise to the sardinian channel at 24 mya , dividing the western from the central and southern areas. between 16 mya and 10 mya , corsica and sardinia reached their present locations and collided with future peninsular italy ( then connected with sicily ) .
finally , the tyrrhenian sea opened between 8.6 mya and 7.6 mya [ 47 ] .
in parallel , the grande and petite kabylies broke off from the balearic island and sardinia microplates , respectively , between 25 mya and 20 mya , moved southwards and collided with africa to reach their final positions approximately 15 mya .
furthermore , the history of the islands , such as the balearic islands and sicily , is even more complex because in the last 20 my , they have endured periods of submersion and emersion , as well as continental contacts .
thus , ~ 14.8 mya , as attested by the entrance of diverse animal species , menorca and mallorca were in contact with the iberian peninsula .
later , a marine transgression covered both islands , wiping out most of the protoligurian fauna and flora , only sparing some species in the highest parts of mallorca ( serra de tramuntana ) .
a second contact with the peninsula , approximately 5 mya ( during the messinian crisis , when the sea level dropped dramatically ) , allowed the entrance of some mammal species .
finally , during the pleistocene glaciations , the two islands formed a single landmass , easing the migration of the remaining protoligurian and other fauna from mallorca to menorca [ 48,49 ] .
the first dating analysis ( additional file 4 ) provides an age of ~ 43 mya for the divergence of s. mediterranea from its sister species schmidtea polychroa .
this date and the age inferred for the older node of s. mediterranea in our two dating analyses ( between ~ 20 and ~ 5 mya ; figure 3 , additional file 4 ) sets a time range for the origin of the species that is congruent with the hypothesis that s. mediterranea , or its most recent ancestor , was already present on the csb microplate ( or microplates [ 18 ]) when the microplate broke off from the continent ~ 30 mya .
furthermore , the basal position of the w group ( spanish populations ) is consistent with the next breakage of the csb into the northern and southern microplate assemblages .
finally , the splitting of corsica and sardinia from calabria during the opening of the tyrrhenian sea ( 7.6 - 8.6 mya ) and the connection of the latter , via sicily , with tunisia would have resulted in the separation of the c and s groups (~ 7 my of age for the last common ancestor ) .
the spreading of the groups from calabria to sicily and tunisia was likely very hazardous given its low dispersal capability , but it happened during a rainier period than today .
indeed , the mediterranean climate as we know it , with dry summers , did not appear until 3.2 mya [ 50 ] with the main difference being the frequency of rain , rather than the temperature , which should have resulted in more freshwater courses and , hence , more opportunities for freshwater planarians to disperse .
last but not least , with the present data , we can also postulate that the present asexual populations ( w group ) are descendants of the original sexual s. mediterranea that remained on the continent or in the balearic islands after sardinia and corsica broke away , although the dating obtained is too recent to be explained by the geological history ( between ~ 20 and ~ 4 mya vs. 24 mya ) .
alternatively , this age could be consistent with a variation of the csb migration hypothesis [ 51 ] in which the microplate including corsica - sardinia and calabria remained connected to the paleo - europe continent during its migration , becoming detached ~ 5 mya , when the mediterranean was refilled after the messinian salinity crisis and simultaneously with the raising of tuscany .
this alternative could explain the closeness of the split between the three geographical groups in our phylogenetic trees and their equidistance in haplotype networks .
however , in this case , we would expect s. mediterranea to be distributed across a wider area , including liguria and the mediterranean coast of france , but s. mediterranea has never been described in these places or been found there in recent samplings , whereas s. polychroa and other planarian species have .
one can consider that the asexual character of the w group populations could have affected the dating analyses , resulting in artefactually younger datings ( see the next section ) .
compared to its sister genus dugesia ( with more than 20 species described in the mediterranean ) , the genus schmidtea ( with a mere 4 species ) has a much lower diversity ( see additional file 4 ) .
even in the area where we find s. mediterranea , dugesia has diversified into at least 4 species ( d. hepta , d. benazzii , d. subtentaculata , and d. liguriensis ) probably as a consequence of the same geological events described here .
therefore , the results point to schmidtea as a low diversifying genus and to s. mediterranea as an old species compared to others in the same area , even within the tricladida. with the exception of s. mediterranea and some populations of s. polychroa in north africa and sardinia , most schmidtea inhabit continental europe up to scotland and sweden .
sexual s. polychroa and s. lugubris lay cocoons between 10degreesc and 23 - 25 degreesc [ 52 ] because higher temperatures are deleterious .
even for sexual populations of s. mediterranea , harrath et al .
[ 12 ] showed a moderate to drastic reduction in the size of the testes , ovaries and the copulatory apparatus begins at over 20 degreesc and worsens over 25 degreesc .
in other words , schmidtea seem best adapted to climates with moderate summer temperatures , a situation that is by no means found on the mediterranean islands and in continental coastal areas .
this raises a final intriguing question : could s. mediterranea be considered a survivor trapped in a harsh habitat as a consequence of csb breakage and migration ?
the asexual populations of s. mediterranea : single or recurrent origins ?
recent or ancient ?
genetic variability at the mitochondrial level is null within asexual populations and very low when the three populations are taken together ( only for cyb did one of the three populations show a different haplotype diverging only at one nucleotide ) .
in contrast , the nuclear marker n13 shows , namely , in the barcelona population , high haplotype diversity similar to that found for sexual populations in other regions .
this value might , however , be rather misleading because the barcelona population is almost exclusively made up of heterozygous individuals ( 32 out of 33 ) .
when we measure genotype diversity instead of haplotype diversity ( table 3 ) all asexual populations show lower genetic variabilities than the sexual populations .
in summary , whereas in sexual populations the variability is evenly distributed among all genotypes ( whether heterozygous or homozygous ) , in asexual populations variability is exclusively found in specific genotypes .
although the latter situation would be at odds with a panmictic population , it might be anticipated for an asexual population that reproduces by fission .
how is the very low or null variability in asexual fissiparous s. mediterranea explained ?
most likely , when a few individuals , or even one , became asexual within a sexual population ( assuming that they persisted and outcompeted their sexual counterparts ) , this genotype would become fixed , which would result in the disappearance of the sexual individuals and of most genetic variability .
present climatic conditions and the types of habitat where these asexual forms are found make this scenario very likely .
in menorca , the asexual forms live in temporary water courses that become dry or are reduced to small ponds during summer , with running water only after rainfall in winter and early spring .
under these conditions and with a fair amount of food available , fissiparous organisms ( which duplicate in number after fission and regeneration in 15 - 20 days ) could reproduce faster than sexual individuals , which have higher energy demands than asexual individuals because they need to develop and maintain reproductive organs , mate , and lay cocoons [ 53 ] .
in fact , the negative values obtained in the tajima 's d neutrality test , although not significant , provide support for an expansion signal for the two menorca populations .
for the barcelona population , the situation is different because it is localised in a plant nursery without seasonal water shortages .
however , other factors , such as periodic pond cleaning in the plant nursery , may cause some decreases in population size .
the significant positive values obtained in the neutrality tests may result from these types of recent and less pronounced bottleneck .
it is important to bear in mind that asexual reproduction by fissiparity poses problems that are very different from the much more common asexual reproduction by parthenogenesis .
in parthenogenetic populations , new genetic variants could arise and spread by mutation in the germline , and with the occurrence of meiosis , new combinations could arise by recombination .
in fissiparous populations , all mutations are somatic instead , and the probability of a new mutation spreading over a whole individual , and thereafter through the whole population , should be very low and could explain the extremely low rates of substitutions in these populations .
therefore , the genetic composition found in these organisms might be a frozen picture of the genetic pattern that was present in the first animals that became asexual .
although very low rates of substitution ( absence of nucleotide diversity ) are evident in the data presented here , more in depth studies with new markers are necessary to understand how these populations keep the burdens of a lack of genetic variability at bay. from the data obtained , is it possible to make an educated guess about when and where asexual populations originated and spread ?
the close genetic relationship among the menorca and barcelona populations , the sharing of mitochondrial haplotypes , and their geographical closeness argues for a single asexualisation event .
after the asexual individuals outcompete the original sexual population , they might have spread from the island to the continent or vice versa ( the former is more likely given the basal situation of men _ mer in the w clade ) either by passive dispersal or through human activities , that has been proven for several species , freshwater planarians among them ( ribas et al. [ 9 ] for girardia tigrina ; and lazaro et al. [ 10 ] for dugesia sicula ) .
however , although the estimated age for the clade , including the bar _ mon and men _ gor individuals , is too recent to be explained by the geological events described , it is also too old to be explained by human transport ( 0.6 - 0.2 mya ) .
as for the age of onset of the asexual lineage , it is recent according to the point of diversification among fissiparous populations ( 1.36 - 0.14 mya ) .
however , this and the recent dating obtained for the basal splitting in the species tree ( figure 3 ) might be underestimates caused by the anomalously low genetic substitution rates of fissiparous organisms misleading the methodologies used in the dating analyses .
to test this hypothesis further , we performed a test and attempted to model the change in the evolutionary rate in the asexual lineage by using beast .
to do this , we repeated our second dating analysis , and this time we considered the asexual sequences as fossils so that at the point in the past where they first appear , the lineage stops accumulating changes ( additional file 5 ) .
the results show that , if we assign an old age to the asexuals ( around 20 mya ) and use the rate obtained in our first dating analysis , we recover splitting ages among geographical groups that are close to those that would be expected if the csb hypothesis were true .
the low substitution rates of fissiparous populations could spare them the burden of accumulating deleterious mutations and explain this longevity , although they still need to avoid the problem of a lack of variability .
further genetic analyses , including more coding regions , could help to ascertain whether these hypotheses are valid and to understand how mutations spread within individuals and became fixed in populations of these asexuals .
a final conundrum of the asexual populations of s. mediterranea is the presence of the fissiparous triploid population ( men _ mer ) that bears the translocation in one of its three chromosomal sets .
in freshwater planarians , triploid individuals are known to form in sexually reproducing populations ( e.g. , in s. polychroa [ 54,55 ]) from the union of unreduced diploid ovules ( or sperm ) and haploid sperm ( or ovules ) .
the men _ mer population bears two normal chromosomal sets with one set including the translocation between the 1st and 3rd chromosomes .
therefore , this population could have originated from the union between an unreduced diploid ovule from a sexual diploid and a sperm bearing the chromosomal translocation from an asexual individual .
in laboratory cultures , large ( e.g. , > 20 - 25 mm in length ) individuals from asexual fissiparous populations often develop testes , large ovaries , and the whole copulatory complex [ 6,56 ] and have been reported to mate with sexual diploids , although the cocoons that are laid are usually sterile .
although fissiparous specimens do not usually reach this size in nature , such an event is the more reasonable explanation for the origin of fissiparous triploids in s. mediterranea .
the sexual populations of s. mediterranea the sexual populations studied showed extremely low mitochondrial variabilities ( table 3 ) , with two of them ( one in sardinia , one in sicily ) having no variability .
data on intrapopulation variability for other triclads are scarce , but two terrestrial planarian species from the atlantic forest in brazil have notably higher values of pi ( 0.01 and 0.017 for coi [ 57 ]) .
although other groups of animals show very low values of pi [ e.g. , palinurus elephas ( 0.0013 - 0.0030 for coi , [ 58 ]) ; and the lepidopter helicoverpa armigera ( 0.0017 - 0.0038 for coi , [ 59 ])] , the values are not as low as those found for s. mediterranea .
for the nuclear marker , intrapopulation variability is higher than for mitochondrial genes , although again two populations ( from tunisia and sicily ) show no variability .
however , as pointed out above , the high diversity found among geographical regions , even for the nuclear marker , suggests an old origin for the present distribution of planarians and , hence , for their populations .
because old populations are expected to contain high variability ( because long stable populations accumulate changes ) , the low levels determined here could be explained by demographic events affecting neutrality .
the neutrality tests applied ( table 6 ) show that many of these populations demonstrate a significant result against the hypothesis of neutrality , with the estimated values on the positive side of the interval obtained in the permutation test .
this finding may be interpreted as a consequence of recent bottlenecks ( that would also explain the significant genetic differentiation found among populations ; data not shown ) .
this interpretation is in agreement with the habitat and climate conditions in which these populations live , even though their demographic conditions are not as harsh as those for the fissiparous populations from menorca , and the sexual character of the c and s populations results in a different outcome ( here , there are no signs of population expansion ) .
the relationship between sicilian and tunisian populations merits a final comment .
the close relationship between the tunisian population and some individuals from the sicilian populations may indicate that the only tunisian population ( despite extensive sampling [ 12,60 ]) was recently introduced by human activities .
however , this is unlikely because the sicilian and tunisian populations do not share a mitochondrial haplotype and because the age of the node giving rise to the tunisian population ( figure 3 ) far exceeds the age in which human activities began in the mediterranean .
therefore , the scarcity of s. mediterranea in africa ( it has so far not been reported from algeria to the canary islands ) may be explained by competition between the abundant fissiparous triploids of d. sicula [ 60 ] and s. mediterranea .
fissiparous populations of d. sicula are present all around the mediterranean coastal areas ( from greece and israel to the canary islands [ 10 ] ; e. sola and m. riutort , unpublished data ) where they seem well adapted to high temperatures and dry conditions [ 60,61 ] .
it is not surprising that d. sicula may outcompete s. mediterranea , which at present has been reduced to a single locality found in tunisia , despite a reasonable sampling coverage .
conclusions schmidtea is a genus with a low diversity that is constituted by only four species .
these species are probably quite old (~ 40 mya ) and primarily have a northern european distribution .
they are probably better adapted to cold climates , which are less likely to allow speciation , than to hot climates .
ball [ 38 ] has suggested that schmidtea species are in morphological stasis ( differences in morphology among species are circumscribed to details of their reproductive organs ) , and the present study seems to indicate that the stasis is also found at the molecular level .
the present distribution of s. mediterranea is best explained , as suggested long ago , by a vicariant process of microplate fragmentation and migration of the csb during the oligocene and miocene periods .
regardless of which of the two possible outcomes of this hypothesis better explains the distribution of schmidtea , the age of the species is relatively old compared with the species of other groups present in the same area , even compared with its sister genus dugesia .
asexual fissiparous populations of s. mediterranea probably arose within the west area ; however , the lack of sexual populations in that area precludes a good estimate of whether it was an ancient or a recent event .
last but not least , the sparse number of localities where s. mediterranea is currently present in the continental range , i.e. , on the tunisian and the catalan coast , suggests that s. mediterranea may be a survivor trapped in a harsh habitat after a long voyage to the south on several microplates after the breakage of the csb 30 mya from which s. mediterranea has slowly been displaced by better - adapted species .

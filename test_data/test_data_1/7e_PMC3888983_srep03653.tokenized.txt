the formed wo2.9 nrs were modified with methoxypoly ( ethylene glycol ) ( peg ) carboxyl acid via ligand exchange to have good water dispersability and biocompatibility. with the high photothermal conversion efficiency irradiated by a 980 nm laser and the better x - ray attenuation property than clinically used computed tomography ( ct ) contrast agent iohexol , the formed pegylated wo2.9 nrs are able to inhibit the growth of the model cancer cells in vitro and the corresponding tumor model in vivo , and enable effective ct imaging of the tumor model in vivo .
our " killing two birds with one stone " strategy could be extended for fabricating other nanoplatforms for efficient tumor theranostic applications .
development of novel nanoparticulate systems for theranostics of cancer that combines both diagnostic and therapeutic functions has increasingly attracted a great deal of attention in recent years12345 .
for effective cancer therapy , it is essential to develop a nanoparticulate system that is able to respond to the local tumor environment or external stimuli such as temperature , ph , magnetic field , light , and enzyme6789 .
in particular , light - activated theranostics have been of vital importance .
compared with photodynamic therapy and photo - controlled chemotherapy , photothermal therapy ( ptt ) makes use of a photosensitizer that converts tissue transparent near - infrared ( nir ) light into heat with a minimal attenuation of the energy and prevents undesirable thermal damage to healthy tissue .
over the past decade , a variety of nanoparticulate photothermal agents with a relatively high tissue transparency in the nir window , such as gold nanostructures ( nanorods , nanoshells and nanocages ) 101112 , carbon nanomaterials ( carbon nanotubes and nanographenes ) 1314 , palladium / germanium nanostructures15161718 , copper chalcogenide nanocrystallines1920 and other organic nanoparticles21222324 have been intensively investigated .
however , in most of the cases , molecular imaging functionalities have not been developed or incorporated within the investigated np systems for theranostics .
among the many molecular imaging technologies , x - ray computed tomography ( ct ) can afford better spatial and density resolution than other imaging modalities .
current iodine - based small molecular ct contrast agents have severe limitations including relatively short circulation times due to rapid renal clearance , renal toxicity , and vascular permeation .
due to the prolonged blood circulating half - life , passive accumulation at the tumor sites via enhanced permeation and retention ( epr ) effect , and high contrast efficacy , nanoparticulate ct contrast agents comprised of heavy metal elements with a high atomic number have been paid considerable attention recently .
a range of np systems including but not limited to au25262728293031 , bi2s33233 , fept34 , taox3536 and naluf4 / naybf43738 nanoparticulate have been developed as effective ct contrast agents .
however , most of the developed ct contrast agents have not been simultaneously developed for therapeutic applications .
generally , theranostic agents are constructed using an integrated platform such as dendrimers3940 , polymeric micelles41 , and inorganic nanocarriers42434445464748 , which contain both imaging and therapeutic components ( e. g. , cancer drug ) .
however , the conventional integration process for theranostic agents requires multiple synthetic steps and additional costs to avoid convoluted behavior and effects in vivo and to clear substantial regulatory hurdles .
to address these problems , a single component nanomaterial having both imaging and therapeutic functionalities should be an ideal option .
up to now , very few studies have been reported for simultaneous ct imaging and nir photothermal therapy with a single component agent4950 .
due to the high surface - to - volume ratio , large surface energy , and quantum confinement effects , nanostructured tungsten oxide have been developed for electrochromic devices51 and gas sensors5253 , used as a photocatalyst54 , and applied in field emission displays5556 .
very recently , plasmonic tungsten oxide nps have been applied for photothermal therapy57 .
as is well known , tungsten has a higher x - ray absorption coefficient ( 4.438 cm2 / kg at 100 kev ) than that of iodine ( 1.94 cm2 / kg at 100 kev ) .
therefore , it is reasonable to hypothesize that tungsten oxide nps may be developed as a theranostic agent for simultaneous tumor ct imaging and photothermal therapy .
in this work , we demonstrated the first use of tungsten oxide nanorods ( wo2.9 nrs ) modified with polyethylene glycol ( peg ) for simultaneous ct imaging and nir photothermal therapy of tumors in vivo .
the formed pegylated wo2.9 nrs were characterized via different techniques .
the photothermal therapy performance of the pegylated wo2.9 nrs was confirmed in vitro and in vivo under irradiation of a 980 nm laser .
further , the in vivo tumor ct imaging was confirmed by scanning the mice intratumorally injected with pegylated wo2.9 nrs .
results synthesis and characterization of pegylated wo2.9 nrs wo2.9 nrs were synthesized by a modified high - temperature pyrolysis of a cheap and air - stable precursor of tungstic acid in a mixture solvent of oleyl alcohol and diphenyl ether at 260degreesc under nitrogen atmosphere ( fig. 1a ) .
this process enables the generation of wo2.9 nrs that can be well - dispersed in different organic solvents ( fig. s1a ) .
x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was used to characterize the crystalline phase of the nrs ( fig. 1c ) .
the peaks shown in the xrd pattern were indexed and the nrs had a nonstoichiometric wo2.9 form ( jcpds no.18 - 1417 ) .
a careful examination of a typical transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) image ( fig. 1b ) show that the formed wo2.9 nrs have a length of 13.1 +/ - 3.6 nm ( fig. s1b ) and a diameter of 4.4 +/ - 1.5 nm ( fig. s1c ) .
a clear lattice fringe with a spacing of ~ 0.37 nm corresponding to the lattice spacing in the ( 110 ) plane of the wo2.9 phase can be clearly observed in a typical high - resolution tem image ( inset in fig. 1b ) , confirming the crystalline nature of the material .
furthermore , the composition of the nrs was characterized by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) .
the w4f curve fitting data shown in fig. 1d reveal that the main peaks at 35.8 and 37.8 ev can be assigned to w6 + and the weak peaks located at 36.5 and 34.3 ev be assigned to w5 + 58 .
the existence of w5 + may be due to the fact that a part of the w6 + is reduced by oleyl alcohol at a high temperature .
as a result , a portion of the used oleyl alcohol was oxidized to oleic acid to control the growth of nrs .
the presence of oleic acid was confirmed by fourier transform infrared ( ft - ir ) spectroscopy ( fig. s1d ) , where the vibration band at 1655 cm - 1 assigned to the c = o groups of oleic acid can be clearly observed .
the formed wo2.9 nrs stabilized by oleic acid are not dispersible in water , and unable to be used for biomedical applications .
therefore , it is essential to modify their surfaces to endow the nrs with water dispersability and biocompatibility. through a ligand exchange process , polyoxyethylene chains ( peg ) was modified onto the surfaces of the nrs via the coordination interaction between carboxylate ions and the tungsten oxide surface .
this was confirmed by ft - ir spectrum ( fig. s1d ) , where the vibration band at 1111 cm - 1 associated to the c - o - c unit of peg can be clearly observed .
the ligand exchange process was further confirmed by thermal gravimetric analysis ( tga ) ( fig. s1e ) .
it is clear that the weight percentage of the organic content changed to ~ 15 % from ~ 8 % , indicating that around 7 % peg has been modified onto the surface of the nrs .
furthermore , we show that the morphology of the nrs after pegylation does not have any appreciable change in comparison with that of organic ligand - capped nrs ( fig. s1f ) .
finally , the pegylated wo2.9 nrs were proven to have good dispersability in water , pbs buffer solution , and fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) and do not precipitate for at least one month ( inset in fig. 2a ) .
the good water solubility and colloidal stability are essential for their further biomedical applications .
photothermal effect the aqueous solution of pegylated wo2.9 nrs ( 100 mug / ml ) showed a blue color with strong absorption in the nir region ( fig. 2a ) , which was attributed to the strong localized surface plasmon resonances ( lspr ) of the nrs59 .
the strong nir absorption of pegylated wo2.9 nrs motivated us to investigate their potential application as photothermal agents .
the temperature increase of the aqueous solution in the presence of the pegylated nrs as a function of the nr concentration ( 60 to 1200 mug / ml ) under the 980 nm laser irradiation shows that the solution temperature increase can reach 41.7degreesc at the nr concentration of 1200 mug / ml , and higher concentration of nrs leads to more prominent temperature increase ( figs. 2b and s2a ) .
in contrast , the water solution in the absence of nrs does not show any obvious temperature increase under similar experimental conditions ( fig. 2b ) .
to assess the nir photostability of pegylated wo2.9 nrs , five cycles of laser on / off were performed by irradiating the aqueous solution of pegylated wo2.9 nrs via a 980 nm laser for 10 min ( laser on ) , followed by cooling down to room temperature without nir laser irradiation for 30 min ( laser off ) .
as shown in fig. 2c , the temperature increases of 20.1degreesc and 30.3degreesc were able to be achieved after the first laser on for the nr concentration of 100 and 750 mug / ml , respectively .
no significant change in the temperature increase was observed after five cycles .
furthermore , the absorbance of the nrs ( 180 mug / ml ) at 980 nm remained stable even after ten cycles of laser irradiation ( fig. s2b ) .
x - ray attenuation property considering the high atomic number and x - ray absorption coefficient of tungsten , the contrast efficacy of pegylated wo2.9 nrs as a ct contrast agent was evaluated ( fig. 2d ) .
iohexol , a conventional iodine - based ct contrast agent was used as control .
the ct value , measured in hounsfield units ( hu ) , increased linearly as a function of the concentration of w or i ( fig. 2d ) .
however , the increasing trend of the nrs ( the slope of the ct value for pegylated wo2.9 nrs was ~ 1.9 ) was much higher than that of iohexol with a slope of ct value of ~ 0.5 .
at equal concentrations of w or i element , the ct contrast enhancement of pegylated wo2.9 nrs was much higher than that of iohexol , which is primarily due to the higher x - ray attenuation coefficient of w than that of i. photothermal therapy of cancer cells in vitro the high photothermal conversion efficiency of pegylated wo2.9 nrs prompted us to evaluate the feasibility to use them as a photothermal agent for cancer therapy .
firstly , hela cells ( a a human epithelial cervical cancer cell line ) and l929 cells ( a normal mouse fibroblast cell line ) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the pegylated wo2.9 nrs via a standard 3 - ( 4,5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2,5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) cell viability assay ( fig. s4a ) .
it is clear that the viability of both hela and l929 cells treated with the nrs is all greater than 80 % even at the nr concentration of 500 mug / ml. this suggests that the pegylated wo2.9 nrs are quite cytocompatible at the nr concentration up to 500 mug / ml. it is essential to check the hemocompatibility of the material , especially under that the circumstance that requires the material to contact blood .
we show that at the nr concentration of 400 mug / ml , the hemolysis percentage of pegylated wo2.9 nrs was only 2.6 % , much less than the threshold value of 5 % ( figs. s4b - s4d ) , suggesting their excellent hemocompatibility .
these studies demonstrate that in the given concentration range , the pegylated wo2.9 nrs are cytocompatible and hemocompatible , which is essential for their further biomedical applications .
we next evaluated the capability of using pegylated wo2.9 nrs to photothermally ablate cancer cells by typan blue staining under laser irradiation .
as shown in the optical microscopic images in fig. 3a , there were no obvious changes in the control groups of hela cells with or without laser irradiation ( figs. 3a1 and 3a2 ) .
moreover , negligible cell ablation was observed for cells incubated with pegylated wo2.9 nrs without laser irradiation ( fig. 3a3 ) .
in contrast , the hela cells incubated with pegylated wo2.9 nrs ( 50 mug / ml ) were stained blue after laser irradiation for 8 min ( fig. 3a4 ) , indicating that hela cells were ablated by nir laser irradiation .
the photothermal ablation of cancer cells was also confirmed by laser confocal fluorescence microscopy .
after laser irradiation , hela cells were co - stained with calcine am and propidium iodide ( pi ) to differentiate live ( green ) and dead cells ( red ) , respectively .
the majority of hela cells were able to be ablated after treated with 50 mug / ml pegylated wo2.9 nrs under laser irradiation at 0.35 w / cm2 for 8 min , suggesting that the pegylated wo2.9 nrs are able to kill hela cells via photothermal destruction ( fig. 3b4 ) .
in contrast , the hela cells without treatment were not affected by laser irradiation under similar experimental conditions ( fig. 3b3 ) .
these results corroborate with the above optical microscopic imaging data .
we further quantitatively investigated the photothermal ablation of hela cells by mtt assay and flow cytometry ( facs ) .
hela cells incubated with 5 to 125 mug / ml pegylated wo2.9 nrs for 4 h in 12 - well plates were irradiated under a 980 nm laser at 0.35 w / cm2 for 8 min .
then , the cell viability was measured .
as controls , hela cells were treated similarly with pegylated wo2.9 nrs without laser irradiation and were laser irradiated in the absence of pegylated wo2.9 nrs .
as shown in fig. 3c , the cell viability of the two control groups was higher than 85 % , indicating that pegylated wo2.9 nrs or the 980 nm laser irradiation alone have negligible effect on hela cells .
however , when hela cells were incubated with 5 - 25 mug / ml pegylated wo2.9 nrs and irradiated with a 980 nm laser at 0.35 w / cm2 , the cell viability decreased rapidly with the nr concentration .
at the nr concentration of 25 mug / ml , the cell viability decreased to 15.0 % +/ - 1.4 % ( measured by mtt assay ) , which is comparable to ~ 18.3 % analyzed by facs .
the cell viability decreased very slowly at higher concentrations. from 25 to 125 mug / ml , the cell viability decreased from 15.0 % +/ - 1.4 % to 6.2 % +/ - 0.6 % as measured by mtt assay , which can be confirmed to be from ~ 18.3 % to ~ 5.8 % as analyzed by facs .
the median lethal dose induced by a 980 nm laser at 0.35 w / cm2 was ~ 5 mug / ml. furthermore , photothermal cytotoxicity was enhanced by increasing the nir laser power density .
at an nr concentration of 50 mug / ml , the viability of hela cells decreased from 68.1 % +/ - 0.8 % to 13.0 % +/ - 0.2 % as measured by mtt assay ( from ~ 70.9 % to ~ 6.1 % as analyzed by facs ) with an increase in the laser power density from 0.1 to 0.45 w / cm2 .
the median lethal power density for hela cells incubated with 50 mug / ml pegylated wo2.9 nrs was ~ 0.20 w / cm2 .
these experimental findings demonstrate that the combination of pegylated wo2.9 nrs and nir laser irradiation is able to ablate cancer cells in vitro in a localized manner .
therefore , pegylated wo2.9 nrs have a great potential to be used for in vivo photothermal tumor therapy .
to clarify the cell death mode after photothermal treatment , an annexin v - fitc ( av ))/ pi assay was conducted by facs .
the quantity of apoptotic cells was determined by the percentage of av +/ pi - , while the quantity of necrotic cells was determined by the percentages of av +/ pi - . as shown in figs. 4a1 - 4a4 , the apoptosis rate of hela cells is ~ 0.6 % when incubated with pegylated wo2.9 nrs at a concentration of 50 mug / ml and ~ 7.2 % after laser irradiation at 0.30 w / cm2 .
therefore , neither pegylated wo2.9 nps nor 980 nm laser irradiation alone exerted obvious destructive effects to hela cells .
in sharp contrast , the apoptosis rate of cells incubated with pegylated wo2.9 nps under the above conditions under laser irradiation was ~ 71 % ( fig. 4 ) , while the necrosis rate was only ~ 6.4 % .
therefore , under this condition , the mechanism of in vitro photothermal therapy is mainly triggered by cell apoptosis , not necrosis .
the power density - and concentration - dependence of the cell death mode of hela cells were further investigated in detail , as shown in figs. 4b and 4c .
as a control , the apoptosis rate of hela cells treated only with pegylatedwo2.9 nrs at the highest nr concentration of 100 mug / ml for 4 h is only ~ 1.0 % .
on the other hand , in the absence of pegylated wo2.9 nrs , the apoptosis rate was ~ 11.4 % when irradiated with the highest power density of 0.45 w / cm2 for 8 min .
the control experiments demonstrate that the pegylated wo2.9 nrs or 980 nm laser irradiation alone do not induce any obvious cell apoptosis .
in the presence of pegylated wo2.9 nrs with a high concentration ( 50 mug / ml ) , the apoptosis rate of hela cells increased from ~ 9.7 % to ~ 71 % with an increase in the laser power density from 0.05 to 0.30 w / cm2 , respectively .
however , there was no obvious increase in the percentage of necrotic cells .
to our surprise , with the increase in the laser power density from 0.30 to 0.45 w / cm2 , the apoptosis rate decreased from ~ 71 % to 31.5 % , with a significant increase in the necrosis rate from 6.4 % to 58.9 % .
these experimental findings demonstrate for the first time that photothermal therapy occurs via an apoptosis - mediated mechanism with a low laser power density ; however , with a high laser power density , apoptosis and necrosis modes were simultaneously observed .
the apoptosis and necrosis modes with a laser power density of 0.35 w / cm2 were further confirmed by increasing the concentration of pegylated wo2.9 nrs ( fig. 4c ) .
for instance , the apoptosis and necrosis rates were 29.3 % and 11.7 % in the presence of pegylated nrs ( 5 mug / ml ) , respectively , while the apoptosis and necrosis rates increased to 47.5 % and 41.1 % in the presence of 100 mug / ml pegylated nrs , respectively .
ct imaging and photothermal therapy of a tumor model in vivo as a proof - of - concept , we tested the feasibility to use pegylated wo2.9 nps as a ct contrast agent for in vivo tumor imaging .
pegylated wo2.9 nrs dispersed in physiological saline were intratumorally injected into the xenografted hela tumor model in a nude mouse with a dosage of 20 mg / kg of body weight .
the tumor signal was clearly enhanced immediately after injection ( figs. 5a1 , 5a2 , figs. 5b1 and 5b2 ) .
the ct value determined from a 0.4 mm3 region of the tumor was measured to be 235 +/ - 30 hu before injection .
the injection of pegylated wo2.9 nps gave rise to a significant tumor ct value increase ( 6996 +/ - 1735 hu ) , indicating that the developed pegylated wo2.9 nps are able to be used as a contrast agent for tumor ct imaging .
motivated by the obvious photothermal property of pegylated wo2.9 nrs in vitro under the 980 nm laser irradiation , we then investigated the potential to use them to photothermally ablate hela tumor model in vivo .
tumor bearing mice were intratumorally injected with pegylated wo2.9 nrs ( 20 mg / kg ) and then irradiated with a 980 nm laser .
the local temperature change was monitored by an infrared thermal camera , and plotted as a function of the irradiation time ( fig. 5d ) .
the surface temperature of the tumor injected with pegylated wo2.9 nrs rapidly increased by 20degreesc under 980 nm laser irradiation at 0.35 w / cm2 for 5 min , which was high enough to kill the tumor in vivo .
the temperature of the tumor region without injection of pegylated wo2.9 nrs was not obviously affected .
therefore , besides ct imaging , pegylated wo2.9 nrs can be used as a good photothermal imaging agent for tumor imaging in vivo .
to further confirm the tumor ablation resulted from the photothermal effect of pegylated wo2.9 nrs , the damage levels of tumor tissues were examined using hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) staining after different treatments .
the tumor tissues treated with either pegylated wo2.9 nrs or laser irradiation alone showed a similar damage level to the untreated tumor .
as expected , a high damage level was observed in the tumor tissue treated with a 980 nm laser and pegylated wo2.9 nrs .
the photothermal therapy for tumor tissue was further quantitatively confirmed by tunel staining after various treatments .
as shown in fig. 6 , 20 % +/ - 2.7 % and 26 % +/ - 2.7 % tunel positive cells were found after treatment with pegylated wo2.9 nrs without laser irradiation and after treatment with the laser irradiation in the absence of pegylated wo2.9 nrs , respectively .
however , after laser irradiation , the quantity of tunel positive cells increased to 45 % +/ - 1.1 % after treated with the nrs .
the photothermal therapeutic efficacy of pegylated wo2.9 nrs by a 980 nm laser was further evaluated .
four groups of hela tumor - bearing mice with 5 mice per group were used in our experiment .
all mice were alive during the period of the photothermal therapy .
the relative tumor volumes ( v / v0 ) were calculated for each mouse and plotted as a function of time ( fig. 6d ) .
the relative tumor volumes for the group of intratumorally injected with pegylated wo2.9 nrs only and the group exposed to the nir laser irradiation alone were similar to that of the group injected with saline , suggesting that injection of pegylated wo2.9 nrs only or irradiation of the 980 nm laser alone is unable to inhibit the tumor growth .
as expected , tumor growth in the group injected with pegylated wo2.9 nps and exposed the nir laser irradiation were completely inhibited ( fig. s10 ) .
these results further demonstrate that the combination of pegylated wo2.9 nrs and nir irradiation is essential for effective photothermal therapy of tumors .
discussion generally , non - stoichiometric tungsten oxide nanomaterials are synthesized from the precursor of tungsten ethoxide and tungsten chloride , which are of high cost and very sensitive to the moisture5759 .
in our procedure , the cheap and stable tungsten acid was adopted , which was convenient to handle under the conventional experimental conditions .
the decomposable inorganic acid precursor may be developed as a general precursor for the synthesis of other nanomaterials .
the developed pegylated wo2.9 nrs were quite photostable under the nir laser irradiation when compared with the classical photothermal agents ( e.g. , au nrs ) .
our results reveal that five cycles of laser on / off ( 0.25 w / cm2 ) do not lead to any significant changes of the temperature and the absorbance at 980 nm for pegylated wo2.9 nrs ; however , the same process of laser on / off results in vanished absorption peak of au nrs in the nir region and a gradual decrease of temperature ( fig. s3 ) .
furthermore , the contrast efficiency of pegylated wo2.9 nrs was ~ 4 - fold higher than that of the clinical ct contrast agent ( iohexol ) .
as a result , to obtain an equivalent contrast enhancement , pegylated wo2.9 nrs can be used at a much lower dose , which can avoid the adverse side effects of higher dose administration when compared with the clinically used iodinated contrast agent .
it is interesting to note that in our study , we selected hela cells ( a human epithelial cervical cancer cell line ) for theranostics because hela cells have been widely used as model cancer cell line .
the success of our work may be beneficial for theranostics of cervical cancer , as well as other types of cancer .
due to the significant nonspecific cellular uptake of the pegylated wo2.9 nrs possibly via two dictinct mechanisms ( phagocytosis and diffusion via cell walls ) 29 , the cancer cells are able to be significantly inhibited after photothermal treatment .
for effective tumor ct imaging and photothermal ablation , we selected to use intratumoral injection of the pegylated wo2.9 nrs .
this is because the developed pegylated wo2.9 nrs do not possess active targeting ligands and the passive targeting of the particles via enhanced permeability and retention ( epr ) effect after intravenous injection of the particles was proven to be not sufficiently effective by our ct imaging experiment ( fig. s5 ) .
for non - targeted nps or targeted nps with a size more than 100 nm , intratumoral injection may be selected as an effective administration route for tumor imaging31 and therapy60 .
though many types of nanoparticulate theranostic agents that are integrated with both imaging agents and therapeutic components have been reported39404142434445464748 , the developed one - component theranostic agents similar to the one developed in our study are quite limited .
for example , metal ferrite nanoparticles for both mr imaging and magnetic hyperthermia6162 , fe3o4 nanoparticles for both mr imaging and nir photothermal therapy63 and and porphysomes for photoacoustic imaging and photodynamic therapy64 have been developed .
compared to the conventional integration procedure , our ' killing two birds with one stone ' strategy is quite convenient and economic , and may be used as a new theranostic agents for different biomedical applications .
in summary , we demonstrated the use of pegylated nrs for simultaneous x - ray ct imaging and nir photothermal therapy of tumors with a " killing two birds with one stone " strategy .
combining the advantage of deep tissue spatial penetration without tissue damage for ct imaging , and that of minimal attenuation of the energy and undesirable heating of healthy tissue for ptt , the higher x - ray attenuation coefficient of pegylated wo2.9 nrs than that of iodine - based small molecular ct contrast agent enables them to be used for sensitive ct imaging of tumors .
on the other hand , with the high intensity absorption in the nir region , the developed pegylated wo2.9 nrs are able to have high photothermal conversion , amenable for photothermal ablation of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo .
the developed pegylated wo2.9 nrs may be further functionalized with different targeting ligands for targeted ct imaging - guided phototheraml therapy of different types of cancer .

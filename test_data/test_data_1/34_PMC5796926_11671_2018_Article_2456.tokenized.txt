the macro / microstructures of carbon - based electrode materials for supercapacitor applications play a key role in their electrochemical performance .
in this study , hierarchically macroporous graphitic nanowebs ( hm - gnws ) were prepared from bacterial cellulose by high - temperature heating at 2400 degreesc .
the hm - gnws were composed of well - developed graphitic nanobuilding blocks with a high aspect ratio , which was entangled as a nanoweb structure .
the morphological and microstructural characteristics of the hm - gnws resulted in remarkable charge storage performance .
in particular , the hm - gnws exhibited very fast charge storage behaviors at scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 v s - 1 , in which area capacitances ranging from ~ 8.9 to 3.8 mf cm - 2 were achieved .
in addition , ~ 97 % capacitance retention was observed after long - term cycling for more than 1,000,000 cycles .
keywords macroporous carbon carbon nanofiber carbonization electrode supercapacitor national research foundation of korea ( kr ) 2017r1c1b1004167 yun young soo issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background multidimensional carbon - based nanomaterials ( mcns ) have a great potential in energy storage , because of their unique material properties , such as large specific surface area , high surface to volume ratio , high electrical conductivity , and chemical / thermal / mechanical stability [ 1 - 3 ] .
in addition , abundant and inexpensive precursor materials with well - known simple chemistries make mcns more attractive as electrode materials for a range of energy storage devices [ 4 , 5 ] .
in particular , mcns have been considered as a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors that can deliver much higher power than other energy storage devices because of their intrinsic charge storage mechanism based on physical adsorption / desorption on the surface of the electrode materials without solid state diffusion [ 6 ] .
in a general point of view , the power characteristics of supercapacitors are affected strongly by the operating cell voltage , as shown in the following formula : pmax = vi2 /( 4r ) , where p , vi , and r are the power density , initial voltage , and equivalent series resistance ( esr ) , respectively [ 7 ] .
in addition , the energy density is also closely related to the cell voltage from the relationship , e = 1 / 2 cv2 , where e , c , and v are the energy density , capacitance , and operating voltage , respectively [ 8 ] .
therefore , a better power capability and energy density on supercapacitors can be achieved through a high cell voltage .
a high working voltage of >= 3 v was realized using an ionic liquid - based electrolyte ( ile ) , while the bulky organic molecules showed unfavorable diffusion kinetics [ 7 - 9 ] .
this suggests that a more sophisticated design of ncms is required to maximize their electrochemical performance .
the charge storage behaviors of the mcns are strongly dependent on both their macroscopic structure and local microstructure , particularly in ile .
concentration polarization generally limits the rate capabilities of electrode materials due to a decline in the ion transfer ability with increasing current rates .
therefore , a hierarchically macroporous open structure composed of nanometer scale carbon building blocks can be an ideal platform to achieve rapid ion transfer ; several studies reported the practicability of these architectures [ 10 - 13 ] .
on the other hand , when ion transfer of the electrolyte is fast enough , an ohmic drop originating from inadequate electrical conductivity is a critical factor limiting the rate capabilities of the electrode materials .
graphitic carbon composed mainly of sp2 carbon layers generally have better electrical conductivity than amorphous carbon .
although the local carbon structures can be transformed to graphitic structures by simple heating under an inert gas atmosphere , it is difficult to maintain the internal nanostructure of the carbon - based materials during the heating process , collapsing the nanoporous architecture and / or causing the aggregation of the carbon nanobuilding blocks .
therefore , the development of advanced nanostructured graphitic materials with a large number of open macro / micropores as an electrode for high - power supercapacitors has been reported .
bacterial cellulose ( bc ) is a sustainable nanofibrous polymer produced by acetic bacteria , e.g. , acetobacter xylinum [ 14 , 15 ] .
bc has a unique pore structure and properties compared to other types of cellulose in terms of its purity , high crystallinity , and high mechanical strength [ 15 ] .
in our previous studies , it was found that bc pellicles can be carbonized by simple heating with maintaining its intrinsic pore structure [ 14 , 16 , 17 ]. and the carbonized bc pellicles were graphitized with further high - temperature heating by 2400 degreesc [ 17 ] .
moreover , the carbonized / graphitized bc pellicles were free - standing , which can be used as an electrode material for energy storage without binder and substrate [ 14 , 17 ] .
these material properties of bc could be fitted as an electrode for high - power supercapacitors .
in this study , hierarchically macroporous graphitic nanowebs ( hm - gnws ) and carbon nanowebs ( hm - cnws ) were prepared from bc membrane by simple heating at 2400 and 800 degreesc , respectively , and their electrochemical performance was characterized .
the hm - gnws possessed well - ordered graphitic microstructures including insignificant oxygen heteroatoms , showing superior electrochemical performance to hm - cnws over a large operating voltage window of 3 v under an ile .
at a high sweep rate of 100 v s - 1 , the hm - gnws showed a capacitance of 3.8 mf cm - 2 and good cycling stability over 1,000,000 cycles .
experimental preparation of hm - gnws and hm - cnws bc pellicles were cultured by acetobacter xylinum brc 5 in a hestrin and schramm medium for 14 days .
the prepared bc hydrogel was purified in an aqueous 0.25 m naoh ( 97.0 % , daejung , korea ) solution and rinsed several times with pure distilled water .
the neutralized bc hydrogel was then immersed in tert - butanol for 12 h at 60 degreesc .
after freezing at - 20 degreesc for 5 h , the bc pellicles were lyophilized at - 45 degreesc and 4.5 pa for 3 days .
the resulting bc cryogels were treated thermally at 800 or 2400 degreesc in a graphite furnace under an ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 degreesc min - 1 .
the product hm - gnws or hm - cnws were stored in a vacuum oven at 30 degreesc .
electrochemical characterization the electrochemical properties of the samples were characterized by cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) , chronopotentiometry , and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy ( eis , pgstat302n , autolab ) .
ag / agcl and pt wire were used as the reference and counter electrodes , respectively .
1 - ethyl - 3 - methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ( emim.pf6 ) was diluted in acetonitrile ( acn ) at a weight ratio of 1:1 , and the mixture solution was used as the electrolyte .
the three - electrode system was tested in a beaker cell .
the working electrodes are prepared by punching hm - gnws at a diameter of 1 / 2 in. the loading of the active electrode was approximately 4 ~ 5 mg. the specific capacitance was determined from the galvanostatic measurements using the following equation : 1 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ c =\ frac { 4 { i }_{\ mathrm { cons }}}{ mdv / dt } , $$\ end { document } c = 4iconsmdv / dt , where icons is the ( constant ) current , m is the total mass of both carbon electrodes , and dv / dt was calculated from the slope of the discharge curve over the voltage window .
material characterization the morphology of the samples was characterized by field - emission scanning electron microscopy ( fe - sem , s - 4300 , hitachi , japan ) and field - emission transmission electron microscopy ( fe - tem , jem2100f , jeol , tokyo , japan ) .
the raman spectra were recorded using a continuous - wave linearly polarized laser ( 514.5 nm wavelength , 2.41 ev , 16 mw power ) .
the laser beam was focused by a x 100 objective lens , resulting in a spot ~ 1 mum in diameter .
x - ray diffraction ( xrd , rigaku dmax 2500 ) was performed using cu - kalpha radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm at 40 kv and 100 ma. x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps , phi 5700 esca , usa ) was used to examine the surface chemical properties of the samples .
the pore structure was characterized by nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm tests using a surface area and porosimetry analyzer ( asap 2020 , micromeritics , usa ) at - 196 degreesc .
the electrical conductivities of hm - cnws and hm - gnws were investigated using a conventional four - probe method .
the punched samples were attached to gold wires using silver paint ( dupont 4929n ) .
the i - v characteristics were measured using an electrical conductivity meter ( loresta gp , mitsubishi chemical , japan ) .
the current was applied to the samples from - 1 to 1 ma through dual sweep .
the step was 0.01 ma , and each delay time is 1 s. results and discussion the morphological characteristics of the hm - cnws and hm - gnws were examined by fe - sem , as shown in fig. 1a , b , respectively .
both samples have macroporous nanoweb structures composed of entangled nanofibers with a high aspect ratio (> 100 ) .
the numerous nanofibers of both samples were approximately 20 nm in diameter and had different microstructures ( fig. 1c , d ) .
although hm - cnws are composed of an amorphous carbon structure without long - range graphitic order , the hm - gnws have highly developed graphitic structures ( fig. 1c , d ) .
the microstructural characteristics of both samples were examined further by raman spectroscopy and xrd , as shown in fig. 2. the raman spectra of the hm - gnws showed distinct d and g bands at 1352 and 1582 cm - 1 , respectively , which correspond to the disordered a1g breathing mode of the six - member aromatic ring close to the basal edge , and the hexagonal carbon structure related to the e2g vibration mode of the sp2 - hybridized c atoms , respectively ( fig. 2a ) [ 7 ] .
the sharp and split d and g bands suggest that the hm - gnws have a well - ordered hexagonal carbon structure .
in addition , the presence of a narrow 2d band at 2701 cm - 1 showed that the hm - gnws have three - dimensional ordering of the hexagonal carbon planes .
in the case of hm - cnws , the d and g bands were broad and fused to each other , indicating that they have defective carbon structures .
the raman spectrum of hm - cnws showed no 2d band , which was attributed to their poor carbon ordering .
in the xrd patterns , a sharp graphite ( 002 ) peak at 25.7degrees 2theta was observed for the hm - gnws , while a highly broad peak at 24.0degrees 2theta was observed for hm - cnws ( fig. 2b ) .
these results coincide with the raman spectra showing that hm - gnws and hm - cnws have well - ordered graphitic structures and amorphous carbon microstructures , respectively. fig. 1 fe - sem images of a hm - cnws and b hm - gnws and fe - tem images of c hm - cnws and d hm - gnws .
scale bars in the fe - sem and fe - tem images are 2 mum and 10 nm , respectively fig. 2 a raman spectra , b xrd patterns , c xps c 1s spectra , and d nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm curves ( inset of pore size distribution data ) of hm - cnws and hm - gnws the surface properties of the hm - cnws and hm - gnws were characterized by xps , as shown in fig. 2c .
in the c 1s spectrum of the hm - cnws , the main sp2 carbon bonding was observed at 284.4 ev , and two peaks , such as sp3 c - c and c ( o ) o bonding , were observed at 285.7 and 289.9 ev , respectively ( fig. 3a ) [ 10 ] .
similar bonding configurations were observed in the c 1s spectra of the hm - gnws .
the c 1s spectra of hm - gnws showed sp2 carbon , sp3 carbon , and c ( o ) o bonding at 284.4 , 285.4 , and 290.4 ev , respectively ( fig. 3c ) .
the c / o ratios of the hm - cnws and hm - gnws were calculated to be 23.4 and 110.1 , respectively , indicating that both samples have insignificant oxygen contents. fig. 3 electrochemical performance of hm - cnws and hm - gnws in an emim pf6 / acn mixed ( 1:1 w / w ) solution over a voltage window of 0 - 3 v ; cv curves at different sweep rates from 5 to 100 v s - 1 characterized every 5 v s - 1 of a hm - gnws and b hm - cnws .
nyquist plots of c hm - gnws and d hm - cnws ( inset of the magnified images for the high frequency region ) .
e rate capabilities of both samples and f cycling performance of hm - gnws ( inset of the cv curves after long - term cycling ) the pore structure of both samples was investigated using the nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm curves , as shown in fig. 2d .
in the isotherm curves of both samples , a small amount of monolayer adsorption of nitrogen molecules was observed in the relative pressure region of < 0.05 , indicating the presence of micropores [ 10 ] .
a dramatic increase in the level of nitrogen adsorption quantity was observed in the relative pressure section of > 0.9 , and there was no hysteresis between the adsorption and desorption isotherm curves .
these results suggest that both samples have a macroporous structure , including a small amount of micropores , corresponding to iupac type - i and type - ii hybrid shapes .
in particular , both samples have a broad range of macropore sizes which ranged from dozens of nanometers to several micrometers .
the inset of fig. 2d confirms the macropore size distribution of both samples .
the specific surface areas of the hm - cnws and hm - gnws were 158.5 and 138.7 m2 g - 1 , respectively , and their pore volumes were 0.346 and 0.310 cm3 g - 1 , respectively .
the electrochemical performance of hm - cnws and hm - gnws was characterized in an emim pf6 and acn mixed electrolyte ( weight ratio 1:1 ) over the potential range 0 - 3 v ( fig. 3 ) .
cv was performed at high sweep rates from 5 to 100 v s - 1 .
at a sweep rate of 5 v s - 1 , a rectangular - like cv curve was observed for the hm - gnws , indicating ideal charge storage behaviors by the formation of a electrochemical double layer ( fig. 3a ). with increasing sweep rates , the cv shapes were well maintained , even after 100 v s - 1 , which is a 0.04 - s charge / discharge rate ( fig. 3a ) .
in contrast , the cv curves of the hm - cnws were more dented with increasing sweep rates , and the area of the cv curves was overall smaller than that of hm - gnws , indicating the relatively poor rate capabilities of hm - cnws ( fig. 3b ) .
eis of both samples characterized over the frequency range , 100 khz to 0.1 hz , support the cv results .
the nyquist plots of hm - gnws and hm - cnws exhibited a vertical line in the low - frequency region , which shows ideal capacitive charge storage behavior ( fig. 3c , d ) .
in the high - frequency section , a transition between the rc semicircle and migration of the electrolyte was observed at a frequency of ~ 420 and ~ 425 hz for the hm - gnws and hm - cnws , respectively , which correspond to a resistance of ~ 2.0 and ~ 3.3 omega , respectively ( fig. 3c , d ) .
the resistance of hm - gnws was smaller than that of the hm - cnws and much smaller than the previous results [ 9 ] .
electrolyte diffusion stopped at ~ 4.3 and ~ 4.8 hz for the hm - gnws and hm - cnws , respectively ; the electrochemical series resistances ( esrs ) were calculated to be 2.3 and 3.7 omega for the hm - gnws and hm - cnws , respectively .
therefore , both samples have low internal resistance with the hm - gnws having the smaller value .
the specific area capacitance of the hm - gnws was ~ 8.9 mf cm - 2 at a sweep rate of 5 v s - 1 , which decreased almost linearly with increasing sweep rates and reached 3.8 mf cm - 2 at 100 v s - 1 ( fig. 3e ) .
in the case of hm - cnws , their area capacitance at 5 v s - 1 was 6.7 mf cm - 2 , which decreased more dramatically with increasing sweep rates .
approximately 50 % of the initial area capacitance was maintained at 25 v s - 1 for the hm - cnws , and their area capacitance was decreased by ~ 1.1 mf g - 1 at 100 v s - 1 .
these results clearly show that the hm - gnws have better rate capabilities than the hm - cnws .
considering the similar porous structure and morphologies of both samples , the rate performance gap of both samples could be induced by the differences in electrical conductivity .
the hm - gnws have two orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivities (~ 130 s cm - 1 ) than the hm - cnws (~ 3.7 s cm - 1 ) .
the cycling stability of the hm - gnws was tested by cv at 20 v s - 1 for more than 1,000,000 cycles , as shown in fig. 3f .
the initial capacitance was well maintained over the overall cycles , and approximately 3 % of the initial capacitance was decreased after 1,000,000 cycles .
these ultra - stable cycling behaviors confirm that the surface charge adsorption / desorption mechanism on the hm - gnws is highly reversible and semi - permanent after repetitive cycling .
the high rate and cycling performances of hm - gnws were induced by their unique morphological and microstructural features based on three - dimensionally entangled graphitic nanofibers (~ 20 nm in diameter ) which is much smaller and well ordered than carbon nanofibers prepared from electrospinning or template method [ 18 - 21 ] .
therefore , surface - induced charge storage performances can be improved in hm - gnws , showing exceptionally high rate capabilities and cycling stabilities by sweep rates of 100 v s - 1 and 1,000,000 cycles , respectively .
the rate and cycling performances of hm - gnws surpass them of other similar carbon - based electrode materials for supercapacitors [ 18 - 25 ] .
conclusions hm - cnws and hm - gnws were prepared by the pyrolysis of bc pellicles at 800 and 2400 degreesc , respectively .
both samples had similar macroporous nanoweb structures composed of entangled carbon nanofibers with a high aspect ratio (> 100 ) .
the hm - cnws had an amorphous carbon structure without long range carbon ordering , whereas the hm - gnws possessed well - ordered graphitic structures on the nanometer scale .
the microstructural differences caused a considerable gap in the electrochemical performance , particularly the rate capabilities .
the hm - gnws exhibited very fast charge storage performance in an ile , in which the area capacitance of ~ 8.9 mf g - 1 was obtained at 5 v s - 1 , and approximately 3.8 mf cm - 2 was achieved at an ultra - high sweep rate of 100 v s - 1 .
moreover , excellent cycling stability was observed over 1,000,000 cycles for the hm - gnws .

while it is common practice for health surveys to include an open - ended question asking for additional comments , the responses to these questions are often not analysed or used by researchers as data .
the current project employed an automated semantic program to assess the useability and thematic content of the responses to an open - ended free response item included in the australian longitudinal study on women 's health ( alswh ) surveys .
the study examined the comments of three cohorts of women , born between 1973 - 78 , 1946 - 51 , and 1921 - 26 , from survey 1 ( in 1996 ) and survey 5 ( in 2007 - 2009 ) .
findings revealed important differences in the health status of responders compared to non - responders .
across all three cohorts , and at both time points , women who commented tended to have poorer physical health ( except for women aged 82 - 87 ) and social functioning , experienced more life events , were less likely to be partnered , and ( except for women aged 18 - 23 years ) more likely to have higher levels of education , than women who did not comment .
results for mental health were mixed .
the analysis revealed differences between cohorts as well as changes over time .
the most common themes to emerge for the 1973 - 78 cohort were health , time , pregnant and work , for the 1946 - 51 cohort , the most common themes were health , life , time and work , while for the 1921 - 26 cohort , the most common themes were husband , health and family .
the concepts and frequency of concepts changed from the first to the fifth survey .
for women in the 1973 - 78 cohort , pregnant emerged as a prevalent theme , while eating disappeared .
among women in the 1946 - 51 cohort , cancer , operation and medication emerged as prevalent themes , while for women in the 1921 - 26 cohort , the concept children disappeared , while family emerged .
this analysis suggests that free - text comments are a valuable data source , suitable for content , thematic and narrative analysis , particularly when collected over time .

introduction while many health surveys include an open - ended question to allow participants to provide additional comments and information , the responses to these questions are not often examined beyond surface - level analysis .
the sole reliance on numerical survey data has been criticised , with researchers pointing to the interpretive value of descriptive comments [ 1 ] .
the detail provided by free - text comments may offer an important context for participant responses and reveal issues that cannot be identified using purely quantitative surveys [ 2 ] .
for example , in a study using likert scales and free - text comments to assess quality of life among homeless people , students , and a town population , important discrepancies emerged between the two response methods [ 3 ] .
while homeless people had similar or better quantitative ratings on several of the health - related measures , their free - text accounts revealed a range of unique difficulties , which appeared to contradict the quantitative results , indicating the value of qualitative comments in evaluating health .
little is known about the health profile of respondents to open - ended questions compared to non - respondents in terms of representativeness of responses .
it has been argued that respondents may not be representative of the population surveyed .
in a review of free - text comments from a study of maternity care involving recent mothers , and a longitudinal cohort study of uk medical graduates' careers , garcia and colleagues [ 4 ] found free text respondents were likely to be more articulate , or to have a negative comment to make than non - respondents .
these findings suggest that biases may exist in open - ended datasets , however little is known about the more general biases such as demographic factors and overall quality of life .
the potential of free - text responses , particularly in a longitudinal context have increasingly been acknowledged for their utility and narrative potentials .
analysis of free - text data collected over time enables researchers to explore changes in how participants construct meaning across the life course [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .
the growing body of literature that has analysed free - text comments begins to suggest that qualitative data sets are of intrinsic value and can be analysed for more than survey evaluation purposes .
the current project employed an automated semantic program to assess the useability and thematic content of the responses to an open - ended free response item included in the australian longitudinal study on women 's health ( alswh ) .
these data are well suited to interrogation due to the large number of participants from three broadly representative samples [ 10 ] .
the aims of this project were to assess the quality , rigour and usefulness of the comments collected by the alswh in order to validate the targeted analysis of these comments .
additionally the health status of responders compared to non - responders was assessed .
methods this project and the data used in the analysis have received all relevant ethics approvals .
ethics approval was granted by the university of newcastle ( h - 076 - 0795 ) and the university of queensland human research ethics committees ( 2004000224 ) .
written informed consent was obtained from all participants .
this consent procedure was approved by both ethics committees .
the australian longitudinal study on women 's health ( alswh ) has been collecting postal survey data from three cohorts of women born between 1973 - 78 ( n = 14247 ) , 1946 - 51 ( n = 13715 ) and 1921 - 26 ( n = 12804 ) since 1996 .
these cohorts have been surveyed by postal survey on approximately a three - yearly basis [ 11 ] .
in addition to completing quantitative questions on their health and lifestyle , participants are also asked " have we missed anything ?" and given the opportunity to answer the question in an open - ended format .
since the study 's inception in 1996 the alswh has been collecting these comments , often using them to provide further insights into quantitative analysis [ 11 ] and more recently for in - depth qualitative analysis [ 8 ] .
this paper presents examples from two separate time points to highlight the validity of free - text comments as data , surveys 1 and 5 are presented to exemplify this. through the use of leximancer software the researchers were able to provide visual maps of the qualitative data , uncovering the most common themes , words and relationships .
this software uses word - association information to elicit emergent concepts from the text [ 12 ] .
word frequency and location are used to generate taxonomies which are presented as maps showing the relationships between common concepts .
leximancer software was used to conduct an automatic analysis of the alswh qualitative data sets .
this analytical tool enables the generation of a taxonomy which is derived from the data itself , offering an efficient way of conceptually mapping , in this case , large data sets .
this type of automatic analysis is grounded and exploratory , as the researcher is removed from making any judgements or preconceptions regarding the coding of the data .
leximancer quantifies large text documents using a classification system of learned lexical concepts rather than just keywords [ 13 ] .
as this project was exploratory in nature , simply to uncover what women wrote about over the study period , all default settings of leximancer were maintained with one exception .
leximancer by default reads the data in two - sentence blocks , as generally in common language two sentences presented together contain similar content and topics .
however , for this project this setting was changed to analyse one - sentence blocks because the nature of free - text comments is that often the sentences are not continuous in content and are rather spontaneous and short in nature .
descriptive quantitative analyses ( t - tests and chi - squares tests ) were additionally undertaken to determine demographic and health - related differences between those women who responded to the free - text item and those who did not respond .
physical and mental health and social functioning were measured using the sf - 36 health survey [ 14 ] .
the mental health index , physical functioning , general health and social functioning subscale scores were compared for those who commented and those who did not comment at survey 1 and survey 5 for each cohort .
a proportional life events score was developed from responses to a life events scale developed from the norbeck 's [ 15 ] life events scale .
demographic measures included partner status ( partnered / unpartnered for the 1973 - 78 cohort and partnered / unpartnered / widowed for the 1946 - 51 and 1921 - 26 cohorts ) and the highest education qualification achieved ( year 12 or less / non - university tertiary / university degree or higher ) .
results this analysis included data from survey 1 ( in 1996 ) and survey 5 ( in 2007 - 2009 ) of the three alswh cohorts .
table 1 shows the number of responses to the open - ended question at each survey .
the proportion of women in the 1973 - 78 cohort who wrote comments increased over time , while the proportion of women in the 1946 - 51 cohort who responded to the free text item remained stable .
the 1921 - 26 cohort were the most likely to comment and also wrote the most ( as measured by number of words ) .

participants who also had significantly higher proportional scores on the life events scale , indicating they experienced more life events than those participants who did not .
there were no significant differences across demographic measures for the two groups .
the results for survey 5 ( in 2009 ) for the 1973 - 78 cohort can also be found in table 2 .
at this time there were no significant differences on the mental health index , however all other subscales of the sf - 36 were significantly lower for those women who commented .
there was also a significant difference detected for education , with those women who commented more likely to have higher levels of education than those women who did not comment .

mental health index scores were not significantly different .
significant differences were also detected for higher proportional scores on the life events scale , higher levels of education and partner status .
at survey 5 , significant differences were only detected for the social functioning score , with women who commented significantly more likely to have lower social functioning scores on the sf - 36 compared with women did not write comment .
women who commented were also significantly more likely than women who did not comment to experience a higher proportion of life events , and had a higher level of education ( see table 4 ) .

as seen in figure 1 , 1973 - 78 cohort survey 1 data , the leximancer software maps the themes according to frequency of words and connectedness of words to other words i.e. pregnancy and child .
as a result the maps create concept circles that are heat mapped .
the hot ( most frequent and most connected i.e. word association ) colours through to cooler colours ( i.e. the red , orange through to cooler colours such as green and blue to purple ) are able indicate meaning and relationships .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0068832.g001 figure 1 1973 - 78 cohort qualitative data leximancer map survey 1 .
in the 1973 - 78 data set the hottest coloured theme was time followed by health and family .
the size of the circles indicates the interconnectedness of each of the themes .
for instance , time has overlapped with year ( which is not a high frequency colour being green ) however the size highlights the importance of the relationship between time and year .
so it is clear that through a visual analysis of the leximancer map the warmth of the colour is important but also the interconnectedness between the circles is important when exploring the comments made by the women .
within the main theme of time , key words such as time , months , stress , work , due , past , times , weeks , child , week , depression , relationship derived from the data .
the results of this map in comparison to the survey 5 map highlight changes over time expressed by the participants .
when the 1973 - 78 cohort was surveyed approximately 15 years later , the themes and concepts showed transitions and developments .
in this map , figure 2 , the main theme is work , followed by pregnant , questions , months and survey .
this indicates that the women used the free - text space to comment on the survey and the questions in the study .
however , this also indicates that issues surrounding work and pregnancy are dominating these women 's comments , which is dissimilar to the earlier survey where pregnancy was not a theme .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0068832.g002 figure 2 1973 - 78 cohort qualitative data leximancer map survey 5 .
within the theme of work , significant concepts words included work , time , week , home , having , days , months , job .
1946 - 51 leximancer analysis results the map of the 1946 - 51 cohort data are a rich collection of assorted comments , raising some similar and different issues to the younger cohort .
in the first survey of this cohort , the most common theme was health , followed by life and time .
within the theme of health , concept words found within that theme include health , feel , women , people , better , answers , things , believe , question and etc .
( figure 3 ) .
these concepts indicate that the 1946 - 51 cohort communicate with the alswh researchers about their feelings and health related to the survey items .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0068832.g003 figure 3 1946 - 51 cohort qualitative data leximancer map survey 1 .
it is interesting to note that in survey 5 the main themes , or the hottest colours , have changed slightly .
over time , work has shifted to become the most prominent theme derived from the data .
work is interlinked with themes such as husband , live and difficult .
within the theme of work are the concepts , time,health , life , home , mother , full , living , age and job ( figure 4 ) .
this interconnection emphasises the challenges of home life and work life for women in mid - life .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0068832.g004 figure 4 1946 - 51 cohort qualitative data leximancer map survey 5 .
each of the above examples illustrates how life events , health and emotions were often written about together by the 1946 - 51 cohort participants .
1921 - 26 leximancer analysis results the map of the 1921 - 26 cohort comments is the largest collection of alswh comments .
as with the other datasets , the 1921 - 26 cohort data are rich in diversity of themes , contents and experiences .
the participants in this cohort generally wrote longer comments ( and often in letter style ) and are were likely to write more frequently , that is , .
several survey waves .
in the 1921 - 26 first survey the theme of husband was the warmest colour .
included in this theme were the concepts life , family , happy , old , live , friends , living , died , mother , people , age , years and full ( figure 5 ) .
it is interesting , that at survey 5 , twelve years after the first survey , the theme husband remained the hottest theme ( figure 6 ) .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0068832.g006 figure 6 1921 - 26 cohort qualitative data leximancer map survey 5 .
in 2008 , under the theme of husband , the concepts changed since 1996 .
these newer concepts include home , week , care , daughter , son , and car .
there is a noticeable shift in the types of comments these older women were writing in 2008 in comparison to the 1996 data .
for example , the term ' children ' has disappeared from this data set in 2008 and been replaced by the emergent term ' family ' as these women moved from their mid - seventies into very old age .
discussion across all cohorts , women who wrote free text comments tended to have poorer physical health and to have higher levels of education .
results for psychological wellbeing were inconsistent .
in addition those results for the 1921 - 26 cohort at survey 5 were inconsistent , possibly due to the number of women who have died or withdrawn from the study by survey 5 , due to the high numbers of participants who commented in this cohort by this time .
examination of the concept maps revealed differences between the three cohorts .
the most common themes were for the 1973 - 78 cohort , were health , time , pregnant and work , for the 1946 - 51 cohort , were health , life , time and work , and for the 1921 - 26 cohort , were husband , health and family .
all cohorts wrote about health related concepts , as would be expected in a health survey .
common themes included : eating and pain from the 1973 - 78 cohort , weight , cancer and medication from the 1946 - 51 cohort , and arthritis , eye and pain from the 1921 - 26 cohort .
the concepts and frequency of concepts changed from the first to the fifth survey .
for women in the 1973 - 78 cohort this included the emergence of pregnant and the disappearance of eating as prevalent themes among women moving from their early twenties to their early thirties .
for women in the 1946 - 51 cohort this included the emergence of cancer , operation and medication as prevalent themes among women moving from their middle forties to their fifties. and for the 1921 - 26 cohort , this included the disappearance of the concept children and emergence of the concept family among women moving from their mid seventies into very old age .
the maps ( see figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) also illustrate the intersections between concepts and the changes that occur in these intersections over time .
assessing quality through the kitto et al ( 2008 ) framework in assessing this data the authors have applied a framework explained by kitto and colleagues [ 16 ] which examines qualitative validity .
this framework sets some ground rules for assessing quality in qualitative data and was recently published in an edition of the medical journal of australia , applied below [ 16 ] .
clarification this aim of this paper was to reveal via a leximancer analysis what the women in the alswh write about at the end of a survey , the health differences between those who write and those who do not write , and to assess whether or not the data collected is a viable option for research .
justification this was an important research question to ask of the alswh data as it has never been asked before .
surveys and questionnaires often ask their participants if there is anything else they would like to tell the research team , but , to date , this is a largely untapped source of research data .
often , these data are only used only for quality assurance or evaluation of survey items .
procedural rigour all processes of the data collection have been documented and approved by relevant ethical boards .
the data used in this analysis have not been edited or changed by researchers , apart from being typed into a database .
leximancer is an automated program based on word count and word association ; therefore , this analysis is relatively unbiased and naturally derived from the original data .
representativeness this study is a nation - wide longitudinal australian study .
the sample is broadly representative of the population of australian women in included age groups .
not every participant has written comments ; however , many have , as table 1 details .
interpretation this data analysis was conducted by an automated computer program , leximancer , which consequently has reduced researcher interpretation bias .
reflexivity and evaluative rigour this analysis strongly confirmed the views of the researchers , that in fact , qualitative free text comments are a valid source of data , particularly when collected over time .
these type of data can be used for content , thematic , narrative and other forms of qualitative analysis and are especially useful when collected over time .
transferability the authors conclude that this method can be transferred to similar contexts .
as mentioned , the process of collecting free - text comments is common among population and epidemiological studies ; this study concludes that these qualitative data can be an asset to these studies and further understandings of particular phenomena .
contributions and limitations of this study this study was unique in its protocol and analysis .
never before have free text comments collected over a 15 year time period been subjected to a leximancer analysis .
this study has the capacity to encourage other survey based studies to analyse qualitative comments .
an important limitation of this study is that only comments written by women who participate in the alswh have been analysed , therefore there may be other themes that have not been included in this study , which are of importance to women in australia who did not write at the back of the alswh surveys .
a further limitation has been identified by the quantitative analysis .
broadly speaking , those participants who commented were of poorer health , un - partnered and had higher levels of education compared with women who did not comment .
nonetheless , these comments provide valuable insight in to the health , wellbeing and lifestyle of australian women over time .
conclusion this analysis of free text comment from a longitudinal study is novel , and as far as the researchers have found , it has never before been validated that free - text comments collected over time can be used as an effective and justified data source .
free text response offers a rich source of data suitable for content , thematic and narrative analysis , particularly when collected over time .

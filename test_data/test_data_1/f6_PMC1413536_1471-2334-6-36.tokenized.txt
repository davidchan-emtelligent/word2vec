background streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus is a rare infection in humans associated with contact with horses or consumption of unpasteurized milk products .
on october 23 , 2003 , the national public health institute was alerted that within one week three persons had been admitted to tampere university central hospital ( tays ) because of s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus septicaemia .
all had consumed fresh goat cheese produced in a small - scale dairy located on a farm .
we conducted an investigation to determine the source and the extent of the outbreak .
methods cases were identified from the national infectious disease register .
cases were persons with s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus isolated from a normally sterile site who had illness onset 15.9 - 31.10.2003 .
all cases were telephone interviewed by using a standard questionnaire and clinical information was extracted from patient charts .
environmental and food specimens included throat swabs from two persons working in the dairy , milk from goats and raw milk tank , cheeses made of unpasteurized milk , vaginal samples of goats , and borehole well water .
the isolates were characterized by ribotyping and pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) .
results seven persons met the case definition ; six had septicaemia and one had purulent arthritis .
five were women ; the median age was 70 years ( range 54 - 93 ) .
none of the cases were immunocompromized and none died .
six cases were identified in tays , and one in another university hospital in southern finland .
all had eaten goat cheese produced on the implicated farm. s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus was isolated from throat swabs , fresh goat cheese , milk tank , and vaginal samples of one goat .
all human and environmental strains were indistinguishable by ribotyping and pfge .
conclusion the outbreak was caused by goat cheese produced from unpasteurized milk .
outbreaks caused by s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus may not be detected if streptococcal strains are only typed to the group level. s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus may be a re - emerging disease if unpasteurized milk is increasingly used for food production .
facilities using unpasteurized milk should be carefully monitored to prevent this type of outbreaks .
background streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus belongs to the betahemolytic group c streptococci , which can cause disease both in animals and humans [ 1 ]. s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus may be found in the nasopharynx , on the tonsils , in the respiratory tract , and on the genital mucous membranes of healthy horses and cattle [ 2 ] .
it is an important cause of respiratory tract infections in foals and young horses , and it is associated in uterine infections in mares [ 3 ] .
it has also been associated with a wide variety of infections , including mastitis , in pigs , sheep , cows , goats , and several other mammalian species [ 4 - 6 ] .
human infections are rare ; the clinical presentations include pharyngitis , septicemia , meningitis , purulent arthritis and endocarditis .
poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis has also been described in connection with human infections [ 7,8 ] .
outbreaks with high mortality have been reported [ 9,10 ] .
the source of human infection is often traced back to contact with domestic animals , especially horses , or ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products [ 11 ] .
all invasive streptococcal infections are notifiable to the national infectious disease register ( nidr ) in finland ( population 5.2 million ). between 1998 and 2002 , only three cases of invasive s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus infection were notified to nidr .
in addition , during the same time period , from 7 to 11 cases of invasive group c streptococcal infections per year were notified .
in these cases the streptococcal strains were only typed to the group level .
on october 23 , 2003 , the national public health institute ( ktl ) was notified that three patients with s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus septicemia had been admitted to tampere university hospital from october 14 to october 19 , 2003 .
epidemiological , microbiological and environmental investigations were conducted to determine the source and the extent of the outbreak .
methods epidemiological investigation cases were identified from the nidr .
a case was defined as a person with an illness in which s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus was isolated from a normally sterile site from september 15 to october 31 , 2003 .
in addition to cases notified to nidr , the clinical microbiology laboratories in the country 's 21 health care districts were requested to type to species level all group c streptococcal strains isolated from a normally sterile site between september 15 and october 31 .
to determine the source of the infection , all cases were interviewed by telephone by using a standard questionnaire .
cases were asked about underlying illnesses , onset and symptoms of current illness , contact with farm and other animals , and consumption of goat cheese and unpasteurized milk products .
in addition , clinical information was extracted from patient charts , including results of laboratory tests and antimicrobial treatment .
in outbreak investigations in finland , ethics committee approval is not required .
during the telephone interview , a verbal informed consent was obtained from the patients .
environmental investigation initial interviews suggested that goat cheese manufactured in a small - scale dairy on a farm was associated with the cases .
samples from cheeses ( n = 11 ) produced on the farm on october 20 , october 23 , and october 27 were collected from retail stores and the farm .
the farm was inspected on october 28 by local authorities , and milk samples were collected from the farm 's milk tank ( n = 1 ) and from all goats ( n = 34 ) in lactation .
in addition , nasal swab samples were taken from 10 goats , and vaginal samples ( n = 34 ) from all goats in lactation .
water samples ( n = 2 ) from the farm 's borehole well were taken , as well as environmental swabs ( n = 22 ) from the dairy and the barn .
milk samples were also collected from goats ( n = 48 ) and milk tank ( n = 1 ) on another farm delivering milk to the dairy .
throat swabs were taken from the two persons who manufactured cheese in the dairy .
laboratory methods clinical microbiology laboratories isolated s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus by using routine microbiological methods [ 12 ] .
samples from the cheese , the environment , and the goats were examined at the national veterinary and food research institute ( eela ) [ 13 ] .
cheese samples were diluted in peptone water until 10 - 7 , streaked onto bovine blood agar plates and incubated anaerobically and aerobically at 37degreesc .
vaginal and nasal swabs from goats were streaked onto bovine blood agar plates and onto edwards agar and incubated anaerobically and at co2 ( 5 %) atmosphere at 37degreesc .
milk samples were streaked onto bovine blood - aesculin agar plates .
environmental swab samples were enriched in todd - hewitt broth containing nalidixic acid ( 15 mg / l ) and colistin ( 10 mg / l ) [ 8 ] and streaked onto edwards agar and bovine blood - aesculin agar plates supplemented with and without nalidixic acid ( 15 mg / l ) and colistin ( 10 mg / l ) .
beta hemolytic pin point colonies were identified using conventional methods : gram staining , catalase test , the lancefield group c using a commercial latex test streptex ( remel europe , dartford , uk ) , and biochemical characterization using api 20 strep and rapid id32 ( biomerieux , marcy - l'etoile , france ) .
susceptibility to antimicrobial agents was performed by using a commercial microdilution method vetmic ( tm ) ( sva , uppsala , sweden ) .
at ktl , the species identification was confirmed by biochemical tests and the strains were ribotyped as described previously by using hindiii and ecori as the restriction enzymes [ 14,15 ] .
the strains were genotyped at eela by using pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) .
dna isolation was performed as described previously [ 16 ] , and 40 u of smai and 20 u of apai ( new england biolabs , beverly , usa ) were used for digestion .
electrophoresis conditions were as follows : 120degrees , 14degreesc , 6 v / cm and switch times 5 - 40 s , 20 h and 1 - 15 s , 18 h , respectively .
for testing discriminatory power of the typing methods five s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus strains : one human clinical isolate from sporadic case ktl 03v05424 , isolates from bovine mastitis eela179 , horse eela ba6997 / 1 , atcc 700400 and eela tyyp656 ( defra intercalibration ) were used as control strains .
a one - band difference in pfge profiles and ribopatterns was considered to represent a new type .
results epidemiology and clinical features altogether seven cases were identified , six of which were from the tampere university hospital and one from the helsinki university hospital .
in one case , s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus was identified after the microbiology laboratories had typed the invasive group c streptococcal isolates further to species level .
two cases were men and five were women .
the median age was 70 years ( range 54 - 93 years ) .
the median incubation period from eating goat cheese to onset of symptoms was two days ( range 0 - 12 ) .
six cases had septicemia , and one had purulent arthritis ( see additional file 1 ). whether this case also had septicemia is unknown , because blood cultures were not taken .
none of the cases had malignant diseases , or severe immunosuppression .
all cases were treated with antimicrobial therapy .
after the blood culture results were obtained , four patients received intravenous penicillin either alone or combined with aminoglycosides , two patients continued with initial cefuroxime treatment , and one who had allergy to penicillin received levofloxacin combined with rifampicin .
all cases recovered without complications , and were discharged after a median hospitalization of 14 days ( range 6 - 32 days ) .
all cases had eaten goat cheese during october 2003 .
six cases reported that the goat cheese they had eaten was a brand that was manufactured in a small - scale dairy located on a farm in the vicinity of tampere .
the remaining case had eaten goat cheese , but did not remember the brand .
however , the cheese was purchased from a retail store that was selling goat cheese manufactured on the implicated farm .
microbiological investigations blood cultures of six cases and joint fluid culture of one case yielded morphologically identical group c streptococci , which also shared identical biochemical profiles and were thus identified as s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus in the clinical laboratories .
similarly identified s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus was isolated from a bulk milk sample , samples from cheese ( dilutions 10 - 1 and 10 - 2 ) manufactured on october 23 , and two consecutive vaginal samples from one goat out of 34 animals examined .
none of the ten nasal swabs from the goats yielded s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus , neither did the milk samples from individual goats on the farm nor the environmental and water samples .
milk samples from goats and bulk milk on the other farm producing milk to the dairy were negative .
throat samples from the two persons who manufactured goat cheese in the dairy also yielded s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus .
these persons had suffered from symptoms of pharyngitis .
all strains had decreased susceptibility to clindamycin ( mic = 0.5 ) .
ribotyping and pfge ( smai and apai ) patterns of the isolates associated with the outbreak ( human clinical isolates , throat isolates from dairy workers , isolates from cheese , raw milk and goat ) were indistinguishable ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
the pfge and ribotyping patterns of the control strains were clearly different from each other , and also from the outbreak strain pattern .

environmental investigation and trace - back the farm had 40 goats producing milk that was only used for cheese production .
in addition , the dairy on the farm received about 200 liters milk per week from another goat farm for cheese production .
milk from the farms was not mixed but used separately for the production .
however , labeling in the cheese packages did not indicate the origin of the milk .
altogether , the dairy used about 30,000 liters of goat milk per year .
the dairy manufactured two types of cheeses , fresh and feta cheese .
during manufacture of fresh cheese , the milk was warmed to 32degreesc , while during manufacture of feta cheese , the milk was heated to 75degreesc .
microbiological quality of the milk , including counts of heterotrophic bacteria and staphylococci , was monitored once per month .
cheese samples were routinely tested 11 times a year for listeria , salmonella , total heterotrophic bacteria , staphylococci and coliform bacteria .
staphylococci had been detected in some of these samples , but the goats had not presented any signs of mastitis .
goats on the farm had previously had abortions , but although samples were sent for examination the cause of these had remained unknown .
control measures cheese manufactured on the farm was distributed to 14 retail stores located in the county of pirkanmaa .
the producer transported cheeses herself to the retail stores and collected at the same time cheeses that were not sold before the expiry date .
cheeses were also distributed to one spa in the same county and one retail store in a neighboring county .
all cheeses produced on the farm were recalled from retail stores on october 28 , 2003 .
at the time of recall , cheeses produced on october 20 , october 23 , and october 27 were still available in the retail stores .
altogether 53.5 kg cheese was collected from the retail stores , mainly from the batch produced on october 27. of the 15 kg batch produced on 23 october , 2.2 kg were collected back .
samples from this batch yielded s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus .
production of cheese in the dairy was stopped on october 28 , and use of pasteurized milk was required for restart of production .
the goat found to be carrier of s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus was slaughtered to prevent further contamination of milk .
discussion this s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus outbreak was caused by fresh goat cheese manufactured from unpasteurized milk in a small dairy on a farm .
six of seven cases had eaten fresh goat cheese manufactured in this dairy , and also the seventh case had probably eaten the same cheese .
human , cheese , bulk milk and goat samples yielded s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus .
molecular typing with two different methods showed indistinguishable patterns for all outbreak associated strains , providing strong evidence that goat cheese was the source of infections .
all cases with invasive s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus disease recovered in this outbreak .
in several other outbreaks , the case fatality proportion ( cfp ) has been substantial .
among 11 patients hospitalized in hong kong because of septicemia from 1982 to 1986 , two died ( cfp 22 %) [ 10 ] .
two persons of sixteen ( cfp 12 %) died in an outbreak associated with homemade cheese in new mexico in 1983 [ 17 ] .
in another outbreak affecting 11 persons caused by unpasteurized milk in england in 1984 , seven patients died ( cfp 64 %) [ 9 ] .
in a series of three cases , two of which were septicemias , in england in 1985 , one patient died [ 18 ] .
single cases of invasive infection with variable outcomes have been reported from several countries [ 19 - 26 ] .
although the median age of cases in this outbreak was high , none of them had severe underlying illnesses , which may explain that all of them recovered .
in addition , after previously reported outbreaks from the 1980s , substantial development has taken place in the treatment of severely ill patients .
the clinical features of illness in this outbreak were severe , however , which is demonstrated by the long hospitalization required for most cases .
the cases with invasive disease likely represent only a small proportion of all persons infected in this outbreak , because after the outbreak became public in the media , several persons reported that they had suffered from pharyngitis after having eaten the implicated goat cheese. of the contaminated batch from october 23 , 13 kg were sold , which means that probably tens of people were exposed to cheese from this batch .
in addition , our cases had eaten cheese from batches manufactured earlier in october , indicating that also other batches have been contaminated .
invasive group c streptococcal infections are not common in finland .
in most clinical laboratories , the strains are routinely typed only to the group level .
identification of the strains to species level would better enable public health professionals to detect outbreaks .
in addition , even in individual cases , typing to species level might help in determining the probable source of infection .
molecular typing in this outbreak provided strong evidence that cheese from the implicated dairy was the source of the outbreak .
because the outbreak had substantial economic consequences to the manufacturer , it was important to get as strong evidence as possible about the source of these infections , also by using two types of molecular fingerprinting methods .
the two persons manufacturing goat cheese may have acquired their infection from contaminated milk or cheese .
however , the owner might also have acquired the infection through direct contact with goats as she milked the animals and took care of them .
transmission of s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus through direct animal contact has been described in several reports [ 7,19,22 ] .
the other food handler participated only in the manufacture of cheese and might have become infected through the manipulation of contaminated cheese .
also person - to - person transmission might have occurred , because symptomless food handlers can carry the organism in the throat [ 8 ]. s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus is a normal commensal of mucous membranes of a variety of animal species , especially horses .
it is not known to be a common cause of genital infections in goats .
some cases of mastitis and meningitis have been reported [ 27,28 ] .
the prevalence of carrier state is not known .
in the present case , the s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus - positive animal was in heat during the first sampling , and abundant growth of s. equi subsp.zooepidemicus was detected on the primary plates .
the vaginal discharge might have contaminated the udder and the milk during milking .
in the second sample the growth was sparse , and could easily have been overlooked .
this indicates that the number of organisms excreted may vary , and may be difficult to detect .
the isolation of the bacterium from cheese samples was performed without using a selective medium which might have weakened the sensitivity of the analysis as the background flora was abundant .
the dilution of the samples , however , enhanced the detection of the organism .
the vaginal and nasal samples therefore were not heavily contaminated and the only goat with an isolation of s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus had an abundant growth of the organism .
pasteurization is effective in preventing transmission of bacterial infections through milk products , and nearly all milk products in finland are manufactured of pasteurized milk .
several outbreaks reported in the literature have been associated with unpasteurized milk , including salmonellosis , campylobacteriosis , listeriosis , and s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus infections [ 11 ] .
after pasteurization of milk became common , some of these infections , including s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus have become rare .
if unpasteurized milk is used for manufacture of foods , the facility should be monitored carefully , including frequent microbiological sampling of the lactating animals and the products .
the spectrum of the microbes examined routinely in finland may not be sufficient for these facilities , but it should be extended to include s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus or beta - hemolytic streptococci as an indicator group .
because delicacy products manufactured of unpasteurized milk , like the goat cheese in this outbreak , may become more common , the importance of rigorous routine control measures should be emphasized .
conclusion the investigation provided strong evidence that this s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus outbreak was caused by fresh cheese produced from unpasteurized milk .
seven patients had severe invasive illness , but none died .
outbreaks caused by s. equi subsp .
zooepidemicus may not be detected , if streptococcal strains in invasive infections are only typed to the group level .
facilities using unpasteurized milk for food production should be carefully monitored to prevent this type of outbreaks .

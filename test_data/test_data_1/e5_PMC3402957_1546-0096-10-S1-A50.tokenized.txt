understanding the comparative effectiveness of these diverse therapeutic approaches would likely result in better health outcomes .
we therefore aimed to derive consensus based treatment plans , standardized assessment intervals and data collection plans for clinical use to facilitate comparative effectiveness studies for new - onset sjia .
eligible patients may be enrolled into any of the treatment plans at the treating physician 's discretion .
methods to develop eligibility criteria and consensus approaches to therapeutic management , the carra sjia core workgroup convened regularly for workgroup meetings , hosted a 2 - day carra consensus conference in april 2010 , and conducted surveys of the carra membership .
results the carra sjia core workgroup developed formal eligibility criteria for patient enrollment , standardized treatment approaches , and a recommended schedule of visits and monitoring parameters .
entry criteria include age 6m - 18y and probable sjia determined by defined criteria .
the treatment regimens include : 1 ) a corticosteroid based plan , 2 ) a methotrexate based plan - with / without corticosteroid , and 3 ) an anti - il1 ( anakinra ) based plan - with / without corticosteroid .
a survey of the carra membership was conducted in december 2010 to assess the acceptability and feasibility of these strategies .
there was a 63 % response rate ( 133 of 211 surveyed ) , of which 92.6 % expressed willingness to follow 1 of 3 treatment plans as outlined .
82 % concurred that a 4th anti - il6 based treatment arm should also be offered .
consensus was reached at the 78 - 85 % level for all topics posed ( entry criteria , specific details of treatment plans , ability to use plans ) .
a feasibility study estimated that over 250 patients could be enrolled in these plans per year , and that physicians would likely enroll one - third to one - quarter of the patients in each of the original 3 plans .
conclusion the use of consensus derived standardized treatment plans for new onset sjia is feasible and acceptable to most north american rheumatologists who are members of carra .
four treatment approaches to the first 6 months of treatment will be published as frameworks for use .
coupled with standardized data collection at routine intervals , use of these treatment plans will serve as the basis for rigorous study of comparative effectiveness of the regimens as used in clinical practice .

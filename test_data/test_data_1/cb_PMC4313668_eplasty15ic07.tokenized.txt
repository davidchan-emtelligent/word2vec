heterotopic ossification implant calcification breast implant breast surgery complication implant contracture description an 80 - year - old woman with a reconstructed breast 28 years ago presented prosthetic extrusion .
chest radiographs showed a round opacity with bone density .
after implant removal , the breast maintained a rigid conformation with exuberant calcification .
the massive calcification took the microscopic form of multilamellar crystal calcium deposits with true bone formation .
questions what is heterotopic calcification ? is massive heterotopic ossification a frequent finding ?
what are the patient risk factors for breast implant calcification ?
what are the implant characteristics that are implicated with a higher risk of periprosthetic calcification ?
discussion in 1977 , peters et al described for the first time the calcification around breast implants and its mechanism of deposition .
it is a common reaction that affects 16 % to 25 % of removed implants and it is associated with higher capsular contraction ( baker iii and iv ) and pain , although many cases remain subclinical .
the implant capsule is formed by thick collagen fibers , inflammatory cells , histiocytes , and foreign - body giant cells ; chondral metaplasia and hyalinization may coexist .
it is thought that there is a time - related cascade of events until calcium deposits in the fibrous capsule : a strong histiocyte , macrophage , and foreign - body giant cell reaction leads to synovial metaplasia after a median time of 11.7 years and dystrophic calcification after 11 to 22 years .
massive heterotopic calcification , characterized by an organized multilamellar deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals between collagen fibers , with osseous trabeculae surrounded by osteoblasts and lacunae osteocyte apposition , is a rare finding .
there are few case reports describing this exuberant reaction in the literature .
the only host risk factor related to periprosthetic calcification is age more than 60 years at the time of surgery .
the other factors identified are related to implant characteristics : the type of filling ( saline or silicone ) , the implant generation , the duration of the implant in situ , and implant integrity .
it appears to exist a causative relation between the rupture of the implant envelope ( or its decomposition ) with a higher deposition of calcium crystals , maybe by a more intense host reaction against silicone , dacron , or polyurethane particles .
hundred percent of first - generation breast implants ( 1963 - 1972 ) led to calcification of the capsule after 14 years .
those implants had a thicker envelope and a dacron patch ; those characteristics were reviewed , and second - generation implants ( 1973 - 1987 ) had a thinner envelope and the dacron patch was removed. that improved calcification rates : 0 % before 11 years and 42 % after 11 years in situ .
during the 1980s , the possibility of leakage of implants was of obvious concern , given the well - known problems with silicone gel breast injections made during the 1940s and 1950s .
several journals published articles about severe capsular contracture , heterotopic calcification , and serious connective tissue disorders after breast implant rupture or " bleeding " of silicone and silica particles .
after the food and drug administration 's moratorium that banned silicone implants in the united states during the 1990s , manufacturers developed implants with a triple - layer shell that prevented leakage , and a more cohesive gel .
these reintroduced implants ( third generation ) had almost no silicone leak , and a dramatic decrease in heterotopic ossification was noticed since then , making it a rare finding .
recent third - generation implants ( after 1987 ) still lack large , randomized studies ; however , the literature points to calcification deposits in 5 % to 30 % after 11 years in situ and 0 % before that .
calcification takes 1 of 2 forms : globular aggregates and heterotopic bone .
the former are found in saline prosthesis in the entire capsule surface and in silicone prosthesis restricted to the anterior surface ; the latter was identified only in the anterior surface of silicone prosthesis .
this patient presented an ulcer on a reconstructed breast with second - generation silicone prosthesis , 28 years before , following a radical mastectomy for breast cancer .
the breast was very stiff , and the prosthesis could not be felt by external palpation .
after prosthesis removal , the breast maintained the same rigid and nondepressible conformation .
after careful dissection of the thin cutaneous flaps , a 1 - mm - thick exuberant and dense calcification was identified under the capsule surface .
the posterior wall of the prosthetic capsule was less involved .
the mandatory capsulectomy was performed and the breast flaps were sutured to the anterior chest wall , under suction drainage .

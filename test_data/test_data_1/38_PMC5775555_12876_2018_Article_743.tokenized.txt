background we present the first description of en bloc endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) for total circumferential barrett 's adenocarcinoma , predominantly of the long - segment barrett 's esophagus ( lsbe ) , with a 2 - year follow - up and management strategies for esophageal stricture prevention .
case presentation a 59 - year - old man was diagnosed with lsbe and barrett 's adenocarcinoma by esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( egd ) .
a 55 - mm - long circumferential tumor was completely resected by esd .
histopathology revealed a well - differentiated adenocarcinoma within the lsbe superficial muscularis mucosa .
for post - esd stricture prevention , the patient underwent an endoscopic triamcinolone injection administration , oral prednisolone administration , and preemptive endoscopic balloon dilatation .
two years later , there is no evidence of esophageal stricture or recurrence .
conclusions esd appears to be a safe , effective option for total circumferential barrett 's adenocarcinoma in lsbe .
keywords barrett esophagus adenocarcinoma of esophagus endoscopic submucosal dissections esophageal stricture issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2018 background recently , there has been an increased incidence of barrett 's adenocarcinoma and its resection by endoscopic submucosal dissection ( esd ) has been reported [ 1 ] .
barrett 's esophagus originates from gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) and occasionally progresses to esophageal adenocarcinoma .
a local resection of cancerous lesions in the barrett 's esophagus mucosal layer ( t1a ) is recommended as a therapeutic option because it is minimally invasive .
esd is common in japan because it allows en bloc resection of large lesion [ 2 ] ; however , gerd - induced submucosal fibrosis beneath the cancerous lesion often makes esd difficult to perform .
a lesion occupying the barrett 's esophagus circumference poses therapeutic difficulties and has a high risk of post - treatment esophageal stenosis .
no reliable methods currently exist for esophageal stricture prevention after complete circular esd for barrett 's adenocarcinoma .
we describe a case of long - segment barrett 's esophagus ( lsbe ) , which was mostly replaced by an early esophageal adenocarcinoma , treated by complete circular esd and followed up for 2 years without esophageal stricture or recurrence .
case presentation a 59 - year - old man complaining of heart burn for two decades was diagnosed with lsbe with an irregular surface on esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( egd ) during a routine check - up. a targeted biopsy of the irregular mucosa revealed an adenocarcinoma .
the patient was reported to have a 10 - year history of lsbe on his annual check - ups , but no irregular mucosa in lsbe had been previously found .
no remarkable medical history was elicited .
clinical examination and laboratory studies had unremarkable results .
egd showed a sliding herniation in the esophagus and lsbe was classified as c4m5 according to the prague c & m criteria ( fig. 1a ) .
lsbe surface mucosa was unevenly reddish and contained an erosive area ( fig. 1b - c ) .
narrow band imaging ( nbi ) with magnification revealed a scattered lesion with lsbe mucosal and vasculature irregularities ( fig. 1d - e ) .
the biopsy revealed that most of lsbe was replaced with a well - differentiated adenocarcinoma .
endoscopic ultrasound ( 20 mhz ) revealed thickening of the mucosal layer , although the submucosal layer was intact ( fig. 1f ) .
no metastatic lesions were detected on enhanced ct. finally , the patient was diagnosed with early esophageal adenocarcinoma corresponding to the lsbe area ; the lesion was totally circumferential and longitudinally measured 50 mm. after receiving written informed consent , esd was performed using an eg - 580rd ( fujifilm medical , tokyo , japan ) with a distal attachment ( d201 - 11804 ; olympus medical systems , tokyo , japan ) .
a submucosal injection of 0.4 % sodium hyaluronate ( mucoup ; johnson and johnson , tokyo , japan ) was administered .
marking , incision , and dissection were performed using a hook knife ( kd - 620qr ; olympus medical systems ) .
an electrosurgical generator ( vio300d , erbe elektromedizin , tubingen , germany ) was used with specifications set at dry - cut mode 60 w , effect 3 , and spray coagulation mode 60 w , effect 2 .
carbon dioxide was used for insufflation .
esd procedure was performed as follows : distal marking at 5 mm caudally from the eg junction ( fig. 2a ) and proximal marking 10 mm cranially from the sc junction ( fig. 2b ) , followed by circumferential incision at the caudal end of the lesion ( fig. 2c ) .
a submucosal tunnel entrance was created by a partial incision at the cranial end of the lesion ( fig. 2d ) and submucosal dissection was performed ( fig. 2e ) , followed by the creation of three submucosal tunnels in the same way ( fig. 2f ) .
finally , incision between the opening of each tunnel and dissection of the connective submucosal tissue between each tunnel assisted by the thread - traction method was performed .
en bloc resection was achieved without intraoperative adverse events ( fig. 2g - h ) .
the operation period was 12 h. histopathological analysis of the resected tissue demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma occupied the entire lumen circumference and was well differentiated .
both the cranial and caudal margins were tumor free ( fig. 3a ) .
the depth of the tumor invasion was the superficial muscularis mucosa without lymphatic vessel and vascular involvement ( fig. 3b - c ) , and minimal lateral extension under the adjacent squamous epithelium was observed ( fig. 3d ) .
the timeline after esd is shown in fig. 4. postoperative adverse events such as pneumomediastinum , mediastinitis , or bleeding did not occur .
the hospitalization period was 4 weeks .
an intralesional steroid injection of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide diluted with saline to a total dose of 20 ml ( 40 injection points , 0.5 ml per point , 8 points per circle every 10 mm ) was completed on the first day post - esd .
oral prednisolone was administered at an initial dose of 30 mg / day on the third day post - esd , which was gradually tapered and discontinued 14 weeks later .
prophylactic endoscopic balloon dilation ( ebd ) with 12 - 15 mm balloon diameter ( cre balloon ; boston scientific , boston , usa ) was commenced on the 10th day post - esd and was conducted once every 1 - 8 weeks for 30 weeks ( 20 sessions ) .
a proton pump inhibitor ( ppi ) , proteinase inhibitor ( 100 mg camostat mesylate , three times after each meal ) , and prokinetic agent ( 5 mg mosapride citrate hydrate , three times after each meal ) were orally administered for almost 2 years to prevent the occurrence of gerd and promote the natural healing of the post - esd ulcer ( fig. 4 ) .
at the 2 - year follow - up , the post - esd ulcer had been covered with regenerated squamous epithelium , although small erosions still existed at the center of the post - esd area ( fig. 5a ) and eg junction ( fig. 5b ) .
the patient does not have dysphagia and there is no evidence of esophageal stricture or recurrence 2 years after esd. fig. 1 endoscopic findings .

b the eg junction area through which an egd ( 9.2 - mm diameter endoscope ) can be passed discussion and conclusions endoscopic mucosal resection ( emr ) is a therapeutic option for esophageal intramucosal carcinoma ( t1a ) ; however , the procedure may be unsuitable for large lesions because of the difficulty associated with en bloc resection .
en bloc resection is very important for an exact diagnosis and should be followed by an appropriate planned post - resection management strategy .
esd is the most common treatment method for intramucosal esophageal and gastric cancers ( t1a ) in japan and facilitates en bloc resection even for large lesions .
however , because the lesion in the present case was entirely circumferential and longitudinally measured 50 mm , treatment was presumed to be difficult even with esd and the risk of post - esd stricture of esophagus was extremely high .
although the alternative option of reliable treatment was open surgery , it was considered too invasive for such an early - stage barrett 's adenocarcinoma .
therefore , we selected esd as the treatment strategy for this lesion .
magnifying endoscopy with nbi facilitates easy detection of early barrett 's adenocarcinoma [ 3 , 4 ] .
however , the diagnosis of the extent of the tumor and attention to subsquamous tumor growth , often observed in patients with barrett 's adenocarcinoma , is required [ 5 ] .
the resected specimen revealed minimal tumor extension under the adjacent squamous epithelium .
the circumferential incision of the cranial end should be undertaken at the oral side of the sc junction .
submucosal fibrosis might exist in barrett 's esophagus because of the preexisting inflammation of the esophageal wall .
even with esd , dissecting a long segment of the submucosal layer with fibrosis is challenging .
most of the submucosal layer beneath the lesion showed remarkable fibrosis in the present case .
counter - traction is very important to dissect the fibrous submucosa .
we initially created three submucosal tunnels .
endoscopic submucosal tunneling dissection was introduced as a safe , effective treatment for large , circumferential superficial esophageal neoplasia [ 6 , 7 ] .
the creation of tunnels was assisted by counter - traction produced by the surrounding fibrous submucosa .
however , it was difficult to distinguish the mucosal side from the muscle side in the submucosal tunnel because both sides were whitish because of fibrosis .
therefore , the orientation of vertical direction might be lost , and this constitutes a risk factor for perforation or incision into the mucosal lesion .
to maintain a vertical orientation , we frequently removed the scope from the submucosal tunnel and reconfirmed the orientation of anatomical direction .
we dissected the connective submucosal tissue between each tunnel assisted by the thread - traction method [ 8 ] , which was very useful for obtaining good counter - traction during the procedure .
it is well known that circumferential resection of more than three quarters of the lumen leads to esophageal stenosis .
to avoid this major complication , various strategies have been implemented .
however , there is no established prophylactic option for esophageal stenosis after radical resection .
we employed intralesional steroid injection and oral steroid therapy [ 9 , 10 ] .
we frequently conducted prophylactic ebd , though it is a controversial option for preventing the esophageal stenosis [ 11 , 12 ] .
frequent gastric acid and bile juice reflux was presumed in the present case because the patient suffered from esophageal hiatus herniation .
despite treatment with ppi , protease inhibitor , and prokinetic agent , squamous epithelium regeneration was slow and two erosions persisted long - term .
we were concerned about the chronic inflammation with subsequent fibrosis at the esd site .
once a firm strictural fibrosis is established , it might be difficult to relieve using therapeutic ebd .
therefore , we employed prophylactic ebd with intralesional steroid injection and oral steroid therapy .
prophylactic ebd was undertaken more often because of the slow healing of the post - esd ulcer .
to clarify the significance of prophylactic ebd with oral and intralesional steroid therapy , reports from additional cases are desirable .
esd for lsbe mostly replaced with superficial barrett 's adenocarcinoma ( sba ) is challenging .
a prophylactic approach for post - esd esophageal stricture remains unclear .
however , compared with other treatment options such as emr and surgical operation , esd appears to be a safe and effective option for the treatment of total circumferential long - segment barrett 's adenocarcinoma .

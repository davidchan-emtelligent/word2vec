to date , there are no phase iii trial data that can guide healthcare professionals in managing toxicities of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors ( egfris ) .
this exploratory survey assessed the similarities and differences in nursing management of egfri - related toxicities across 10 european countries .
a questionnaire that was sent to ten nurses who specialize in the treatment of patients with egfri asked about the prevention and treatment of acneiform rash , dry skin / eczema , fissures , paronychia , and pyogenic granuloma .
responses from seven nurses showed that overall ( with the exception of rash ) , treatment differed markedly between countries in the management of dermatologic toxicities .
these substantial differences across the european hospitals surveyed suggest that it might be worthwhile to develop treatment algorithms by conducting a consensus conference or a follow - up survey with several assessments and a larger sample .
cover - date2011 cancer treatment is being transformed with the advent of entirely new classes of drugs that specifically inhibit genes , proteins , or processes involved in cancer development , thus sparing a greater number of healthy cells .
one cancer drug target is the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr , also called erbb1 and human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 ( her 1 )) .
egfr is a member of a protein family called receptor tyrosine kinases , which control vital cell processes such as proliferation , migration , and survival [ 1 ] .
egfr has been linked to many common cancers , including head and neck cancer , colorectal cancer ( crc ) , pancreatic cancer , and non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) , and overproduction of egfr is associated with more aggressive clinical behavior ( including more tumor angiogenesis , proliferation , and metastasis ) and shorter overall survival time [ 2 - 4 ] .
based on their efficacy in clinical trials , therapies that inhibit the egfr signaling pathway , such as the small - molecule inhibitors , erlotinib ( tarceva ( r )) and gefitinib ( iressa ( r )) , and the monoclonal antibodies , cetuximab ( erbitux ( r )) and panitumumab ( vectibix ( r )) , are now routinely used in clinical practice to control these cancers [ 5 - 8 ] .
several types of epithelial cells , such as those in the epidermis , hair follicles , sebaceous glands , mucosal tissues , and ocular tissues , produce high levels of egfr .
epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors ( egfris ) are thus commonly associated with class - specific toxicities , many of which are new to oncology teams and differ from the toxicities regularly observed with conventional chemotherapy regimens [ 9 ] .
skin toxicities , such as acneiform rash , dry skin , fissures , and nail and hair disorders , are commonly associated with treatment with egfris [ 10,11 ] .
to date , there are no data from phase iii trials that can guide healthcare professionals in managing toxicities of egfris .
in this article , a first step towards improving and standardizing patient care is reported .
in brief , an exploratory survey of nurses from different european countries was conducted to assess the similarities and differences in the management of egfri - related toxicities across european countries. between april and november 2009 , a questionnaire was sent to ten hospital - based clinical nurse specialists who focus on the treatment of patients with egfri ; these nurses were selected based on their prior participation in a nursing advisory board on skin toxicities of egfris or membership in the european oncology nursing society target task force on targeted therapies .
the questionnaire asked about the prevention and treatment of egfri - related dermatologic toxicities including acneiform rash , dry skin / eczema , fissures , nail changes such as paronychia , and pyogenic granuloma .
all questions were open - ended to allow for the possibility of discovering management approaches that are not reported in the literature .
seven nurses responded , from belgium , ireland , the netherlands , spain , sweden , switzerland and the united kingdom .
as shown in the tables and discussed in detail below , approaches to management of egfri toxicities differed substantially across the nurses surveyed .
skin rash all survey respondents provided patient education and general skin care advice , including the use of moisturizers ( table 1 ) , but they also reported that they do not provide routine pharmaceutical prophylaxis for skin rash .
in some countries , topical antibiotic creams are given immediately with the appearance of grade 1 acneiform rash , while in others oral antibiotics are preferred .
treatment of grade 3 acneiform rash varies greatly , with oral / topical steroids as well as antibiotics and antihistamines being incorporated into some strategies .
overall , there appeared to be substantial variation in the management of skin toxicities across europe .
these results are consistent with another survey that inquired about the management of egfri - associated skin rash across 110 oncology practices in the united states , which also detected pronounced diversity in the types of interventions used [ 12 ] .
an interdisciplinary , international panel has recommended dividing papulopustular reactions into three categories , based on the severity of symptoms , the impact of symptoms on daily activities , and whether the patient has signs of , or potential for , superinfection [ 13,14 ] .
according to the international guidelines , if there is no response to rash treatment within 2 - - 4 weeks , egfri therapy should be temporarily suspended as directed by the manufacturer [ 13,14 ] .
therapy can be restarted once the rash adequately diminishes in severity .
referral to a dermatologist is warranted if lesions have an uncharacteristic appearance or distribution ; if there is necrosis , blistering , or petechial / purpuric lesions ; or if patients have atypical dermatological manifestations unrelated to rash [ 15 ] .
however , consistent with the findings of this survey , all recommendations are based on experience rather than clinical trial data , and there are important geographic variations in actual management of egfri skin toxicity [ 11 ] .
dry skin various approaches to preventing dry skin were recommended , but the use of emollients and protection against the sun were among the most common ( table 2 ) .
management approaches differed from each other with regard to the types of emollients to be used ; whether and when to use corticosteroids ; and the need for , and timing of , referral to a dermatologist .
not all respondents mentioned examining patients for the possibility of infection , although it could be assumed that these evaluations are conducted when infections are suspected .
fissures for fissures , there was virtually no overlap in the therapeutic measures reported , although two respondents reported using propylene glycol for grade 1 fissures .
four respondents reported giving pain medication , but the timing of its initiation varied .
only two respondents reported experience with grade 4 fissures .
in one of these centers reduced dose or interrupted egfri therapy for severe fissures .
common recommendations for the treatment of fissures in europe include a 50 % solution of propylene glycol in water , an ointment containing 10 % salicylic acid , or a hydrocolloid dressing or liquid cyanoacrylate glue [ 11 ] .
patient education also differed widely among the respondents , according to whether prophylactic care is recommended for the entire body , just the hands and feet , just the hands , or just the feet ( see table 3 ) .
paronychia treatment of paronychia among the respondents varied even more markedly than treatment of the other dermatologic toxicities ( see table 4 ) .
for grade 1 paronychia , management strategies ranged from observation to the use of an oral antibiotic .
most respondents gave some sort of topical treatment for grade 1 ; two added a corticosteroid for grade 3 .
antibiotic therapy was given if needed .
three respondents considered referral to a dermatologist for moderate or severe paronychia .
only two respondents reported experience with grade 4 paronychia ; egfri therapy was routinely stopped for grade 4 paronychia at one of the centers .
pyogenic granuloma only three respondents reported experience with any grade of pyogenic granulomas because this condition is rarely observed ( see table 5 ) .
one nurse felt that no effective treatment was available for this condition .
for grade 1 pyogenic granulomas , the three respondents recommended various antiseptic soaks ; they recommended adding topical treatment and oral antibiotics ( if superinfections were present ) for grade 2 .
a short course of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs was also suggested to alleviate pain .
for prophylactic care , three nurses advised patients to moisturize their bodies twice daily with an alcohol - free emollient and to minimize exposure to the sun or use broad - spectrum sun protection .
one nurse also recommended that patients take short showers without soap .
conclusion this pilot survey of european hospitals revealed that there is no consensus on the management of egfri - related skin toxicities , but respondents clearly agreed that these toxicities need treatment .
this is not surprising , given that treatment options described in the medical literature are based on case reports , case series , or reported personal experience , not on data from large , randomized , controlled trials .
other potential explanations for differences in management are that ( a ) the specific approved egfris and their indications vary between countries in europe and ( b ) different agents have slightly different toxicity profiles .
despite the diversity in their answers , the respondents clearly recognized that egfri toxicities are treatable and require medical intervention .
while dermatologic reactions are usually mild to moderate in severity , they are sometimes physically or emotionally bothersome such that patients wish to discontinue therapy .
conversely , patients may under - report their symptoms out of fear that the anticancer therapy will be withheld .
therefore , it is important that healthcare professionals minimize the incidence and severity of side effects , prevent their progression , and thus the need for dose reduction or discontinuation of potentially effective treatment .
standardized consensus guidelines to prevent or treat egfri - related dermatologic toxicities may help improve patient care and be a useful resource for clinicians throughout europe .
these guidelines should include detailed information on how to educate patients about lifestyle modifications , early signs of toxicity , and the importance of treatment adherence ; how to regularly assess patients' side effects and related quality of life ; and how to provide resources for psychosocial support .
assessment or patient self - report of side effects should begin within 14 days from egfri initiation [ 7 ] .
this survey was exploratory , and the results should be interpreted in the context of certain limitations .
the survey is not representative of the entire european union or of all hospitals within each country .
a more detailed follow - up survey with an expanded questionnaire is planned in order to facilitate the development of a consensus statement and , potentially , algorithms for the optimal treatment of toxicities .
in the meantime , management of egfri - related toxicities should be undertaken on a case - by - case basis , with an emphasis on preventing dose modification whenever possible .
effective management and patient education may help to alleviate the significant social and emotional anxiety related to these manageable toxicities , thus resulting in improved quality of life .

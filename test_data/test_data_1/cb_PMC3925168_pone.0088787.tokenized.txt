introduction acromegaly is a quite rare chronic disease caused by the increased secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) and subsequently insulin - like growth factor 1 .
although cardiovascular diseases remains the most common cause of mortality among acromegalic patients , increased prevalence of malignant and benign neoplasms remains a matter of debate .
the aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of thyroid nodular disease ( tnd ) and thyroid cancer in patients with acromegaly .
materials and methods pubmed , cochrane library , scopus , cinahl , academic search complete , web of knowledge , pubmed central , pubmed central canada and clinical key databases were searched to identify studies containing .
random - effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios and risk ratios of tnd in acromegaly .
studies which not included control groups were systematically reviewed .
results tnd was more frequent in acromegaly than in control groups ( or = 6.9 , rr = 2.1 ) .
the pooled prevalence of tnd was 59.2 % .
also thyroid cancer ( tc ) proved to be more common in acromegalic patients ( or = 7.5 , rr = 7.2 ) , prevalence was 4.3 % .
the pooled rate of malignancy ( calculated per patient ) was equal to 8.7 % .
conclusions this study confirms that both tnd and tc occur significantly more often in acromegalic patients than in general population .
these results indicate that periodic thyroid ultrasound examination and careful evaluation of eventual lesions should be an important part of follow - up of patients with acromegaly .
the authors have no support or funding to report .
introduction acromegaly is a rare chronic disease caused by the increased secretion of growth hormone ( gh ) and subsequently insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf - 1 ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
cardiovascular diseases are very common and remain the most common cause of mortality among acromegalic patients [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
however , increased prevalence of malignant and benign neoplasms is also a matter of debate [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] .
most studies were focused on colorectal and thyroid tumors , however also elevated risk of other , e.g. breast , central nervous system , adrenals or urinary tract neoplasm were reported [ 2 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
meta - analysis performed by rokkas et al .
[ 5 ] proved the increased risk of colon cancer .
the issue of benign and malignant thyroid tumors is not as well established as there was no meta - analysis on the topic and outcomes of particular studies were dispersed .
the aim of this study is to evaluate the risk of thyroid nodular disease ( tnd ) and thyroid cancer ( tc ) in patients with acromegaly and also to combine results of the studies including control groups to assess if the risk is significantly higher than in general population .
materials and methods selection of the studies we have searched the pubmed / medline , cochrane library , scopus , cinahl , academic search complete , web of knowledge , pubmed central , pubmed central canada and clinical key databases from january 1960 up to may 2013 in order to find all relevant journal articles .
we have used the search term : acromegaly and ( thyroid or " thyroid cancer " or " thyroid nodules " or goitre ) .
only full - text journal articles written in english were taken into account .
we have also searched manually the references of review articles in order to avail eventually omitted studies .
two researchers ( k.w. , a.c. ) searched all included databases independently and prepared list of included studies .
in case of discrepancies between lists , authors were reading doubtful articles together .
data extraction we have recorded data on study design , year of publication , country of origin , number of the patients , sex and age of participants , duration of the disease , methods of the thyroid examination ( e.g. ultrasonography , palpation ) , number of patients with and without thyroid lesions and with thyroid cancer .
in case of studies including control group , same data on this group were recorded .
studies with control group matched by age and sex was included .
studies with control groups not matched by this parameters were excluded to avoid within study bias .
statistical analysis we have meta - analyzed odds ratios ( or ) and risk ratios ( rr ) using a random - effect model using statistica v.10 software with medical package .
heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the q statistics and i2 statistics .
q and i2 values given in " results " are based on the odds ratio calculations .
if calculation of or was impossible due to zero cells , a constant ( 0.5 ) were added to all columns .
publication bias was assessed using kendall 's tau .
if publication bias was present we performed cumulative metaanalysis and also re - performed calculations with exclusion of the studies with highest standard error .
we used also data from all included studies ( with and without control groups ) to calculate the pooled prevalence of thyroid nodular disease ( tnd ) and thyroid cancer ( tc ) as well as malignancy rates .
these data were meta - analyzed using random - effect model according to the methodology described by borenstein et al .
[ 9 ] .
only studies assessing the thyroid by ultrasonographic ( us ) examination were included in calculations concerning tnd .
other articles ( e.g. about palpable nodules only ) have been systematically reviewed .
results case - control studies the search results and steps of selection are shown on the flowchart ( figure 1 ) .
nine studies including control group were identified .
in one of them [ 10 ] only palpational examination of thyroid was performed .
in one study [ 11 ] the control group was not matched by age and bmi , in another one - such details about control group were not given [ 12 ] .
in study performed by cannavo et al .
[ 13 ] control group was not matched by sex .
these four studies were excluded from the meta - analysis .
another five studies , two prospective and three retrospective have been included .
[ table 1 ] in case of 15 studies only data on prevalence of thyroid lesions or thyroid cancer were available ( without data on the control groups ) .
these studies were included in quantitative synthesis of pool prevalence of thyroid lesions .
two studies contained data on palpable nodules only ; these studies were systematically reviewed .

5 11 patients examined only by palpation were excluded ; descriptive statistics refer to the whole group ; abbreviations : sd - standard deviation ; sir - standarized incidence ratio ; tc - thyroid cancer ; tnd - thyroid nodular disease .
eleven studies were included .
using also the data about prevalence from case - control studies , there were 13 papers containing data on tnd frequency in ultrasound ( us ) examination and also 13 bringing data on thyroid cancer occurrence .
two further studies contained information about palpable thyroid nodules .
prevalence of thyroid lesions fluctuated from 43.2 % to 75.6 % in us examination .
in total there were 668 patients with and 457 without tnd included .
the pooled prevalence meta - analyzed using random - effect model is equal to 59.2 % with 95 % ci 52.7 % - 66.5 % .
in two studies about the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules was given in two papers and it was 38.8 and 10.5 % .
prevalence of tc fluctuated from 0.8 % to 11.8 % .
in total there were 55 patients with and 1317 without tc included .
the pooled prevalence meta - analyzed using random - effect model is equal to 4.3 % with 95 % ci 3.0 % - 6.2 % .
register - based studies four studies based on registers of acromegalic patients and cancer patients were identified [ table 4 ] .
malignancy rate in thyroid nodules ten studies included data both on thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer frequency what allows to calculate the risk of malignancy in acromegalic patients with tnd .
there were 620 patients with tnd including 48 malignancies .
the pooled rate of malignancy ( calculated per patient ) meta - analyzed using random - effect model is equal to 8.7 % with 95 % ci 6.1 % - 12.3 % .
comparing the risk of malignancy in the studies containing control group , the rr of malignancy in patients with tnd and acromegaly was insignificantly higher than in patients with tnd and without acromegaly - rr = 3.2 , 95 % ci 0.5 - 20.1 .
discussion thyroid nodular disease turned out to be significantly more frequent in patients with acromegaly than in control groups ( or = 3.6 , rr = 2.1 ) and it seems to be a very common disorder in these patients ( prevalence slightly below 60 %) .
according to wuster et al .
[ 10 ] also palpable thyroid nodules occurs significantly more often in acromegalic patients tc also proved to be more common in acromegaly ( or = 7.9 , rr = 7.6 ) , however the calculations of publication bias was of borderline significance ( p = 0.05 ) , what can suggest slight overestimation of the result .
prevalence of tc was quite high - about 4 % .
the risk of malignancy in acromegalic patients with tnd was insignificantly higher than in control groups .
there was also visible tendency that in newer studies thyroid disorders are reported more frequently - e.g. in studies published from 2008 tnd occurred in about 65 % of patients whereas in older studies - in about 54 % ; similar tendency can be observe in case of tcs - they were present in almost 6 % of patients in papers published from 2008 and about 3 % in older studies .
this result is in line with suggestions , that the improving diagnostic and treatment of acromegaly extends the life duration what increases the prevalence of benign and malignant neoplasms .
in the past , more patients died before neoplasms appeared or became clinically relevant [ 4 ] .
the fact that our meta - analysis includes study performed in the period of over 50 years could be consider as limitation of this research .
on the second , however there were numerable studies on the topic , amount of most reliable papers - prospective , including sex and age matched control groups and data both on the prevalnce of tc and tnd is unsatisfactory .
this fact is another limitation of this meta - analysis and it causes that confidence intervals of ors and rrs are very wide , it also precludes detailed analysis of case - control studies in subgroups ( e.g. newer vs. older studies ) .
it also calls attention that studies based on matching data from registers of acromegalic patients with data from cancer registers showed much lower frequency of tc than other , especially prospective studies , however in most cases insignificantly higher than expected [ 31 ] , [ 32 ] .
this discrepancy can be partially caused by inaccuracies in registers .
on the other hand , these results may suggest , that tcs remained undiagnosed in great proportion .
in included studies the risk of malignancy for patients with tnd was about 8 % , what is in the range considered for general population [ 34 ] .
case - control studies also did not show significantly increased risk .
however , the amount of studies is unsatisfactory ; further researches are necessary to determine , if the risk of malignancy in acromegalic patients with tnd is higher than in general population or if the frequency of tc is elevated proportionally to increased prevalence of tnd .
however , many studies was published on the topic of increased risk of benign and malignant neoplasms in acromegaly , it remains controversial as results were often divergent .
among neoplasms , the increased prevalence of colon polyps and cancer seems to be most widely agreed , in large part thanks to meta - analysis performed by rokkas et al .
[ 5 ] .
comparing results of that meta - analysis with our outcomes , the risk of tc is elevated even more strongly than the risk of colon cancer ( or 7.9 vs. 4.4 ) .
prevalence of these two malignancies seems to be similar in acromegalic patients , about 4.5 % .
in conclusion , our meta - analysis proved that patients with acromegaly are at an increased risk of thyroid nodular disease and thyroid cancer .
these results indicate , that periodic thyroid us examination and careful evaluation of eventual lesions should be important part of follow - up of acromegalic patients .

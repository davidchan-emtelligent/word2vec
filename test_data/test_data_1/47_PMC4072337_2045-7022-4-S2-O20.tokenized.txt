a key element in the protective effect is thought to be induction of a specific igg4 response leading to a decrease in the ige - mediated allergic symptoms .
the effect of asit can be ascertained by provocation or skin prick testing .
ige measurement by immunocap is a sensitive standard procedure for allergy diagnosis and this has recently been supplemented by a single allergen array ( isac ) , which employs significantly lower amounts of allergen and may have different assay dynamics .
24 subjects suffering from allergic rhinitis due to grass pollen allergy were stratified on basis of sensitivity in a basophil activation test , to receive standard subcutaneous immunotherapy ( n = 18 ) or to an open control group ( n = 6 ) .
allergen specific ige and igg4 was measured at baseline and when reaching maintenance dose by using both the quantitative immunocap for phl p1 and phl p5 and the chip - based semi - quantitative isac method ( phl p 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 11 and 12 ) .
data are presented as mean and 95 % ci. asit treatment reduced self - reported symptoms from 10,7 to 5,5 ( p = 0,0001 ) .
asit increased allergen specific igg4 levels , both by isac ( from 0,3 to 5,0 isac specific units ( isu ) ( increment 4,7 isu ; 2,7 - 6,7 isu ; p = 0,0001 ) and immunocap ( from 0,1 to 5,2 mg / l , increment 5,1 mg / l ; 2,3 - 7,9 mg / ml ; p = 0,0006 ) .
specific ige increased from 23,0 to 48,8 ku / l when measured by immunocap ( increment 25,8 ku / l ; 4,4 - 47,2 ; p = 0,01 ) .
surprisingly , isac measurement of specific ige decreased from 21,4 to 2,5 isu ( increment 18,9 isu ; - 10,0 ; - 27,8 ; p = 0,0002 ) during updosing .
no significant changes in igg4 or ige measurements were found in the control group during the treatment period .
immunocap measurements indicate that igg4 and ige increase during asit updosing as previously reported .
in contrast , when ige in the same serum samples was measured by isac a decrease in ige seems to be the result of successful asit .
this may be the result of inhibition of ige - binding in vitro in the isac assay , possibly reflecting functional ige inhibition in vivo in the treated patients .
isac measurements before and after asit may thus be useful in monitoring the clinical effect of allergen specific immunotherapy .

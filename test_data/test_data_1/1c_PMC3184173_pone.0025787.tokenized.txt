background microrna expression is altered in cancer cells , and micrornas could serve as diagnostic / prognostic biomarker for cancer patients .
our study was designed to analyze circulating serum micrornas in patients with renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) .
methodology / principal findings we first explored microrna expression profiles in tissue and serum using taqman low density arrays in each six malignant and benign samples : although 109 micrornas were circulating at higher levels in cancer patients' serum , we identified only 36 micrornas with up - regulation in rcc tissue and serum of rcc patients .
seven candidate micrornas were selected for verification based on the finding of up - regulation in serum and tissue of rcc patients : mir - 7 - 1 * , mir - 93 , mir - 106b * , mir - 210 , mir - 320b , mir - 1233 and mir - 1290 levels in serum of healthy controls ( n = 30 ) and rcc ( n = 33 ) patients were determined using quantitative real - time pcr ( taqman microrna assays ) .
mir - 1233 was increased in rcc patients , and thus validated in a multicentre cohort of 84 rcc patients and 93 healthy controls using quantitative real - time pcr ( sensitivity 77.4 % , specificity 37.6 % , auc 0.588 ) .
we also studied 13 samples of patients with angiomyolipoma or oncocytoma , whose serum mir - 1233 levels were similar to rcc patients .
circulating micrornas were not correlated with clinical - pathological parameters .
conclusions / significance microrna levels are distinctly increased in cancer patients , although only a small subset of circulating micrornas has a tumor - specific origin .
we identify circulating mir - 1233 as a potential biomarker for rcc patients .
larger - scaled studies are warranted to fully explore the role of circulating micrornas in rcc .
introduction kidney cancer is one of the most common malignancies in developed countries [ 1 ] .
renal tumors are asymptomatic and non - palpable in early stages ; more than 50 % of renal tumors are detected incidentally by imaging to investigate non - specific symptoms .
the most common renal tumor is clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccrcc ) , but other histological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma ( i.e. papillary , prcc ; or chromophobe rcc , chrcc ) or non - malignant renal tumors ( i.e. oncocytoma and angiomyolipoma ) are more or less difficult to differentiate by imaging modalities , and additional diagnostic tools are warranted to optimize the management of patients with renal tumors .
so far , non - invasive biomarkers are not used in the routine practice because they do not improve the diagnostic or prognostic accuracy [ 2 ] .
micrornas are small non - coding rnas of approximately 22 nt size , and modulate differentiation , growth , apoptosis and proliferation of cells .
microrna expression profiles not only allow distinguishing malignant and non - malignant tissue , but also distinguishing different tumor entities. [ 3 ] micrornas are circulating in a cell - free form in blood [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] , most probably in exosomes which protect them against degradation by rnase [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
microrna signatures in blood are similar in men and women , as well as individuals of different age. [ 6 ] furthermore , microrna levels are similar in plasma and serum [ 4 ] , and freeze / thaw as well as prolonged storage at room temperature do not affect microrna levels [ 4 ] .
thus , circulating micrornas have the potential of a novel biomarker .
several studies demonstrated that specific micrornas are useful to distinguish cancer patients and healthy controls : e.g. , patients with prostate cancer have increased levels of mir - 26a [ 7 ] , mir - 29 and mir - 92a were increased in colon cancer patients [ 8 ] , and mir - 195 was increased in patients with breast cancer [ 9 ] .
in addition , micrornas were prognostic indicators ( prostate cancer : mir - 141 [ 10 ] ; colon cancer : mir - 29 [ 8 ]) .
methods objectives so far , circulating micrornas have not been investigated in patients with renal cell carcinoma .
several groups analyzed microrna expression in tissue , with conflicting results .
we therefore designed our study to identify potential candidates using an array technology ( taqman low density array ) , and validate the most interesting micrornas in an independent cohort using conventional real - time pcr .
the flow chart of the marker verification study is shown in figure 1 .

participants we collected prospectively serum from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy or nephron - sparing surgery for renal tumors ; thus , the study cohort consisted of patients with renal cell carcinoma and benign renal tumors ( brt ; i.e. oncocytoma and angiomyolipoma ) .
we also investigated a control group consisting of patients with non - malignant disease ( men / women attending to our hospital for surgery of non - malignant disease , i.e. benign prostate enlargement or urinary incontinence , or preventive medical examination ) .
the detailed clinical - pathological parameters of patients are reported in table 1 .
the collection of serum samples was performed between 2005 and 2011 at the departments of urology at the universitatsklinikum bonn ( ukb ) , the universitatsklinikum munster ( ukm ) and the universitatsklinikum des saarlandes ( uks ) .

blood samples were obtained prior surgery .
blood was withdrawn in serum s - monovette gel tubes with clotting activator ( sarstedt , numbrecht , germany ) ; after clotting , serum was separated after centrifugation ( 10 min , 2800 g ) and stored in cryotubes at - 80degreesc .
all samples were processed between 1 and 3 hours .
we also analyzed formalin - fixed , paraffin embedded tissue from six patients stored in the archival files of the institut fur pathologie at the universitatsklinikum bonn .
rna isolation serum rna isolation was performed as published earlier [ 7 ] .
in brief , the mirvana paris kit ( ambion , foster city , ca , usa ) was used to purify rna from 400 microl serum .
rna isolation was performed according to the manufacturers' recommendation ( final elution volume 50 microl ) with one exception : we added 25 fmol of a synthetic caenorhabditis elegans microrna , cel - mir - 39 ( qiagen , hilden , germany ; catalog number msy0000010 ) to the serum before starting the isolation procedure .
quantification of cel - mir - 39 allows controlling sample - to - sample differences of rna isolation efficiency .
we analyzed separate ( and not pooled ) samples at each step of the study [ phase - 1 : ccrcc n = 6 , healthy control n = 6 ; phase - 2 : ccrcc n = 33 , healthy control n = 30 ; phase - 3 : rcc n = 84 ( including 69 ccrcc , 10 prcc , 3 chrcc and 2 srcc patients ) , healthy control n = 93 , angiomyolipoma n = 3 , oncocytoma n = 10 ] .
malignant and non - malignant renal tissue was marked on haematoxylin and eosin stained slides by a pathologist .
five serial sections ( 20 microm ) were cut from the tissue block , and the tissue was dissected using a scalpel to enrich ccrcc and adjacent non - malignant renal tissue .
afterwards , the rna was isolated with the recoverall total nucleic acid isolation kit ( ambion ) according the manufacturer recommendations .
rna quantity and purity was determined using the nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer ( thermoscientific , wilmington , de ; usa ) .
low density arrays reverse transcription was performed using the taqman microrna reverse transcription kit and megaplex rt primers .
the reaction mix included 16.6 ng / ml rna ( tissue ) or 3 microl of the eluted rna ( serum ) .
in order to increase the sensitivity of the taqman low density arrays , we performed a pre - amplification using the taqman preamp mastermix .
microrna profiling of 754 different human micrornas was then performed using the taqman low density array ( taqman array human microrna a + b cards set v3.0 ; see table s1 for a list of micrornas ) on an abiprism 7900ht .
in order to normalize serum microrna levels , we additional determined mir - 39 levels : rna was reverse transcribed with mir - 39 rt primers using the taqman microrna reverse transcription kit and quantified using a real - time pcr ( see below for details ) .
all reactions were performed as specified in the protocols of the manufacturer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) .
details are reported miqe - compliant in methods s1 .
quantitative real - time pcr we identified seven candidates using the low density array technology for further characterization .
the determination of microrna levels in subsequent validation experiments was performed similar as described above with one exception : reverse transcription was performed with a self - created primer pool : to obtain this rt primer pool , we speed vacuumed a mixture of each 320 microl of cel - mir - 39 ( applied biosystems assay id : 000200 ) , hsa - mir - 1233 ( id : 002768 ) , hsa - mir - 106b * ( id : 003280 ) , hsa - mir - 1290 ( id : 002863 ) , hsa - mir - 210 ( id : 4373089 ) , hsa - mir - 7 - 1 ( id : 001388 ) , hsa - mir - 320b ( id : 002844 ) and hsa - mir - 93 ( id : 4373302 ) at 45degreesc for 3 hours with the concentrator 5301 ( eppendorf , wesseling , germany ) .
the rt primer pool was re - suspended in 320 microl nuclease - free water .
for the validation of mir - 1233 in a second cohort , the same rt primer pool was used .
quantitative real - time pcr was performed using the taqman small rna assay on the abiprism 7900 ht in triplicates in 10 microl reaction volume ; all experiments were performed as specified in the manufacturers' protocols .
the detailed experimental procedures are presented miqe - compliant in methods s1 .
ethics all patients gave written informed consent prior blood withdrawal .
the study was approved by the ethikkommission an der medizinischen fakultat der rheinischen friedrich - wilhelms - universitat bonn ( approval number : 166 / 10 ) .
statistical methods the analysis of the real - time pcr data was done using with the sds software v2.4 ( settings : automatic baseline , threshold 0.2 ) ; relative microrna levels were calculated with the rq manager v1.2.1 , and data was analyzed with dataassist v2.0 ( all software packages : applied biosystems ) .
microrna levels in serum were normalized against mir - 39 because circulating levels of potential microrna reference genes are also increased in serum of cancer patients [ 7 ] and normalization to a spiked - in synthetic microrna allows to control for rna isolation efficiency ; tissue microrna expression was normalized against rnu6 , rnu44 and rnu48 .
statistical analyses were performed using pasw statistics 17.0 ( spss , chicago , il , usa ) : sensitivity , specificity and area under curve ( auc ) for microrna levels were determined using receiver operator characteristic ( roc ) analysis .
clinical - pathological parameters and microrna levels were correlated using the mann - whitney - u or kruskal - wallis - test , as appropriate .
results phase - 1 : marker - discovery first , we determined microrna expression in ccrcc and adjacent non - malignant tissue ( both n = 6 ) of 754 micrornas using taqman low density arrays .
microrna expression was normalized to small nuclear rna ( rnu6b , rnu44 , rnu48 ) , and the mean expression level was calculated .
eighty - three micrornas were > 2 - fold upregulated , and 103 micrornas were downregulated (< 2 - fold ) ; similar expression levels were seen in 277 micrornas and 299 micrornas were not detectable .
see table s1 for ct - values .
next , we determined the microrna profile in serum from these patients , and compared the expression profile to healthy individuals ( each n = 6 ) ; in order to control the isolation efficiency , the microrna expression was normalized to mir - 39 , which was spiked to serum prior the rna isolation procedure .
in rcc patients , 189 micrornas were upregulated , 9 downregulated and 120 expressed at similar levels ; 444 micrornas were not detected in serum .
raw data is provided in the table s1 .
we then compared microrna profiles of serum and tissue to discover potential tumor - specific micrornas which could serve as non - invasive diagnostic biomarker : 36 micrornas were circulating at increased levels in cancer patients and overexpressed in corresponding ccrcc tissue ( see figure 2 and table 2 ) .
the criteria for further investigation of the seven most promising candidates were : ( i ) high microrna level in serum of cancer patients , ( ii ) high microrna level in rcc tissue , and ( iii ) quantification cycle values < 30 to enable reliable detection .
based on these criteria , we selected mir - 106b * , mir - 1233 , mir - 1290 , mir - 210 , mir - 7 - 1 * , mir - 320b and mir - 93 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0025787.g002 figure 2 serum microrna levels in patients with renal cell carcinoma , benign renal tumors and healthy controls .
micrornas were profiled in serum and tissue of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccrcc ) and healthy controls ( each n = 6 ) using the taqman low density array ; 36 micrornas were upregulated in rcc tissue and serum of rcc patients ( phase - 1 ) .
seven micrornas were chosen for verification using real - time pcr in a cohort of 33 ccrcc and 30 healthy individuals ( phase - 2 ) .
in phase - 3 , the finding of increased serum mir - 1233 levels in rcc patients was confirmed in a multicentre cohort of 84 rcc , 93 healthy and 13 benign renal tumors ( brt ) .
microrna recovery ( as determined using quantification of the synthetic mir - 39 ) was similar in the study centers ( ukb , ukm , uks ) ; the level of mir - 1233 were somewhat higher in patients from ukm .

the level of mir - 1233 was significantly increased in patients with rcc ( mean 2.19 ; 95 % ci 1.57 - 2.81 ) compared to healthy controls ( mean 1.49 ; 95 % ci 1.11 - 1.86 ; p = 0.022 ) .
using roc analysis we determined a sensitivity of 90.9 % and a specificity of 50 % ( threshold 0.93 ; auc = 0.669 , 95 % ci = 0.531 - 0.807 ) .
the circulating levels of mir - 106b * ( p = 0.137 ) , mir - 1290 ( p = 0.262 ) , mir - 210 ( p = 0.342 ) , mir - 320b ( p = 0.308 ) , mir - 7 - 1 * ( p = 0.199 ) and mir - 93 ( p = 0.483 ) were not different in rcc patients and healthy individuals .
see figure 2 .
phase - 3 : marker - validation we thus investigated mir - 1233 levels using the same method in an independent cohort of 84 patients with rcc ( ccrcc n = 69 ; prcc n = 10 ; chrcc n = 3 ; srcc n = 2 ) and 93 healthy controls ; we also analyzed 3 patients with angiomyolipoma and 10 patients with oncocytoma .
we could confirm that mir - 1233 levels are increased in patients with rcc ( p = 0.044 ) : the mean ( 95 % confidence interval ) level of mir - 1233 was 2.05 ( 1.58 - 2.53 ) in rcc patients and 1.88 ( 1.61 - 2.17 ) in healthy controls .
using roc analysis we determined a sensitivity of 77.4 % and a specificity of 37.6 % at a threshold of 1.15 ( auc 0.588 , 95 % confidence interval 0.505 - 0.671 ; accuracy 55.9 % ; precision 52.4 % ; false positive rate 63.4 % ; see figure 2 ) ; sensitivity ( 84.5 %) and specificity ( 28.5 %) were somewhat lower if the threshold of 0.93 was applied , which was determined in the smaller cohort from phase - 1 .
the diagnostic information was similar if only patients with ccrcc and healthy controls were compared ( auc 0.590 , 95 % confidence interval 0.503 - 0.678 ; accuracy 53.1 % ; precision 46.8 % ; false positive rate 63.4 %) .
it should also be noted that mir - 1233 levels from rcc patients and healthy controls at the ukm were somewhat increased compared to patients from ukb or uks ( see figure 2 ) .
however , the number of samples from the centers differed ( ukb : 85 healthy , 4 brt , 56 rcc ; ukm : 8 healthy , 1 brt , 14 rcc ; uks : 8 brt , 14 rcc ) , and make more detailed interpretation difficult .
due to the low number of patients with prcc , chrcc or srcc , we did not compare mir - 1233 levels within different histological subtypes .
clinical - pathological parameters were not correlated with mir - 1233 levels in rcc patients ( sex : p = 0.300 ; pt - stage : p = 0.735 ; lymph node metastasis : p = 0.715 ; fuhrman grade : p = 0.215 ). of interest , patients with benign renal tumors ( angiomyolipoma , oncocytoma ) had similar mir - 1233 levels as cancer patients ( see figure 2 ) .
in an earlier study [ 7 ] , we reported lower microrna isolation efficiencies in patients with prostate cancer ; in the present study , patients with rcc had a similar recovery of mir - 39 : mean ( 95 % ci ) recovery was 37.8 % ( 34.2 % - 41.4 %) in rcc patients and 36.1 % ( 32.5 % - 39.7 %) in healthy controls .
however , microrna isolation was quite variable with a standard deviation of 16.7 % .
we did not notice a difference of microrna recovery between the study centers .
discussion pioneering studies on circulating serum / plasma micrornas [ 4 ] - [ 6 ] showed that circulating micrornas are potential tumor markers : micrornas are stable in blood and their signatures are independent of age and sex .
consequently , researchers demonstrated increased microrna levels in serum / plasma of patients with various tumor entities [ 7 ] - [ 9 ] ; [ 11 ] - [ 15 ] .
former studies demonstrated that microrna expression in rcc and non - malignant renal tissue is different [ 16 ] - [ 24 ] , although findings regarding the number and type of up - / down - regulated micrornas are conflicting .
thus , circulating micrornas may also be a suitable biomarker for patients with rcc .
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study on circulating micrornas in patients with rcc .
so far , there is no consensus on a set of upregulated micrornas in rcc which could be used as non - invasive biomarker .
we therefore compared the microrna expression profile of normal and cancerous serum / tissue ; this approach allowed the identification of 36 micrornas with relative tumor - specificity upregulated in serum of rcc .
most of these micrornas were already recognized as overexpressed in rcc tissue in previous studies ( e.g. mir - 15a , mir - 16 , mir - 21 , mir - 34b , mir - 106b , mir - 155 , mir - 210 , mir - 142 - 5p [ 16 ] - [ 25 ]) , whereas mir - 1290 and mir - 30d were downregulated [ 25 ] .
the accordance of upregulated micrornas in our study with earlier reports indicates the validity of our findings in phase - 1 , even though the discovery cohort in our study was restricted to each six rcc and control tissue / serum samples .
it is of great interest that our study is the first to identify mir - 1233 as rcc - associated oncomir .
similar to earlier studies , we observed that micrornas were predominantly downregulated ( 103 vs. 83 ) in rcc tissue .
in comparison , an overwhelming number of micrornas were increased in serum of rcc patients ( 189 vs. 9 ) .
this indicates that circulating micrornas are generally increased in rcc patients , and that , besides a limited amount of more tumor - specific micrornas , many of these upregulated serum micrornas originate from healthy cells .
we earlier noted similar findings for cell - free serum dna , which is mainly composed of dna from normal cells [ 26 ] - [ 29 ] , and hypothesized that pro - apoptotic signals from cancer - cells lead to cell death of adjacent normal cells .
however , additional reasons for this difference are possible : ( i ) in order to identify cancer - associated micrornas in serum , we compared microrna expression profiles of serum , cancerous and non - malignant tissue of the same cancer patient , whereas serum from different individuals was used .
( ii ) the different normalization strategy in serum ( cel - mir - 39 ) and tissue ( rnu6 , rnu44 , rnu48 ) may also contribute to different numbers of upregulated micrornas in tissue and serum .
we next validated the diagnostic potential of seven candidates from the array experiments in cohort of ccrcc patients .
surprisingly , only mir - 1233 was circulating at increased concentrations in patients with rcc , whereas differences were no longer observed for mir - 106b * , mir - 1290 , mir - 210 , mir - 320b , mir - 7 - 1 * and mir - 93 .
importantly , we were able to confirm the increase of mir - 1233 in serum of rcc patients compared to healthy controls in a multicentre - cohort .
although the diagnostic information ( sensitivity 77 % , specificity 37.6 % , auc 0.588 ) was below the expectations after the initial experiments , it should be kept in mind that " accepted " diagnostic biomarkers like psa do not have a better diagnostic performance for prostate cancer .
a relatively small number ( n = 13 ) of oncocytoma and angiomyolipoma did not show different mir - 1233 levels , and thus the value of mir - 1233 for the differential diagnosis of solid renal tumors needs to be clarified in larger - scaled , future studies .
a recent study published by youssef et al .
[ 24 ] demonstrated that microrna expression profiles allow to distinguish between rcc and oncocytoma , thus maybe more than a single microrna needs to be investigated to improve the diagnostic information .
our study is the first on mir - 1233 , and information about the function of this microrna located on chromosome 15q14 is missing .
the microrna target prediction software mirwalk [ 30 ] identified several potential microrna binding sites : most of them are genes with unknown function , but there are also tumor - associated genes like blcap ( identified as tumor suppressor gene in bladder cancer [ 31 ]) or p53 among the potential targets .
a strength of our study is the use of samples from three different study centers for validation ; other studies on circulating micrornas in cancer patients only analyzed samples from one centre .
interestingly , we observed higher levels of mir - 1233 in healthy individuals and cancer patients in one centre ( ukm ) .
this finding must be interpreted with caution because of the different number of patients recruited in each centre , but indicates clearly the necessity of multicentre evaluation of novel biomarkers .
we decided to normalize the amount of circulating micrornas against cel - mir - 39 ( as earlier described by mitchell et al .
[ 4 ]) , which allows absolute quantification of circulating micrornas with normalization to technical variability .
often , larger rna species ( i.e. u6 or rnu6b ) are prone to degradation by serum rnases , and thus normalization to these classical reference genes for microrna studies is not reasonable .
an effective normalization strategy for biological variation is not well - developed and factors leading to biological variation independent of rcc are not known , and their effect on specific micrornas has not been characterized [ 32 ] .
thus , absolute quantification is an appropriate approach for the analysis of circulating micrornas .
limitations some limitations should be named : the number of samples in phase - 1 was limited to six , and more samples would have probably allowed us to identify a better microrna panel for verification / validation .
also , samples from six healthy individuals who were younger than the rcc patients served as controls , and these samples could be a potential bias .
in addition , the cancer cohort in phase - 1 consisted only of patients with ccrcc , and is therefore less suitable to identify a marker for patients with non - ccrcc histology .
larger - scaled future studies are warranted to explore the role of circulating micrornas in rcc patients ; it is of outstanding importance to analyze serum of patients with non - ccrcc and non - malignant renal tumors for a better understanding of micrornas is biomarkers for rcc .
however , we were able to identify mir - 1233 as cancer - associated , cell - free circulating microrna with potential use in the diagnosis of rcc in the multicenter validation cohort .
we did not observe a correlation of mir - 1233 and clinical - pathological parameters ; it should be kept in mind , that recruiting was performed for a diagnostic study , and thus the composition of the study cohort is unlikely to reveal prognostic information ( most patients have moderately differentiated ( 74 % g2 ) and organ - confined ( 70 %) tumors ) .
novel biomarkers for rcc should also provide information during follow - up to aid the diagnosis of recurrence ; blood samples for this purpose were not available , and thus this question has to be answered by future studies .

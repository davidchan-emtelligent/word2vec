changes in antioxidant properties and degradation of bioactives in palm oil ( po ) and rice bran oil ( rbo ) during deep - frying were investigated .
the alpha ( alpha ) - tocopherol , gamma ( gamma ) - tocotrienol and gamma - oryzanol contents of the deep - fried oils were monitored using high performance liquid chromatography , and antioxidant activity was determined using 2 - diphenyl - 1 - picryl hydrazyl ( dpph ) radical scavenging activity .
results revealed that the antioxidant activity of po decreased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) , while that of rbo was preserved after deep - frying of fries .
as expected , the concentration of alpha - tocopherol in po and gamma - tocotrienol in both po and rbo decreased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) with increased frying .
results also showed that gamma - tocotrienol was found to be more susceptible to degradation compared to that of alpha - tocopherol in both po and rbo .
interestingly , no significant degradation of alpha - tocopherol was observed in rbo .
it is suggested that the presence of gamma - oryzanol and gamma - tocotrienol in rbo may have a protective effect on alpha - tocopherol during deep - frying .
vegetable oils deep - frying kinetic degradation free radical scavenging oil antioxidants 1 .
introduction vegetable oils are generally known to be healthy , due to being high in unsaturated fatty acid and other various phytochemical compounds .
palm oil ( po ) is produced from the fruit bunches of the tree oil palm ( elaeis guineensis ) and has been used for food preparations , as well as other commercial applications in many parts of the world .
yellow palm olein is well known for its high concentration of lipophilic antioxidants , in particular , tocopherols and tocotrienols , as compared to that of other vegetable oils , but lacking in carotenoids , which are removed during the refining process [ 1 ] .
in addition , po contains an equal ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids , making it a versatile oil for commercial usage without involving major modification processes [ 2 ] .
rice bran oil ( rbo ) has been used as cooking oil in some parts of the world , particularly in japan and india [ 3 ] .
rice bran oil has been reported to be an excellent source of antioxidants , such as tocopherols , tocotrienols and oryzanols [ 4 ] .
generally , rbo consists of up to 1.5 % of oryzanol depending on the variety of the rice and is well known for its stability as a frying oil [ 5,6 ] .
the role played by both tocols and oryzanol in improving lipid stability and human health is fascinating , although the use of rice bran oil is not as popular as that of other vegetables oils [ 7,8 ] .
studies have shown that tocopherols , tocotrienol , carotenoids and oryzanols exhibited potent antioxidant properties in both in vivo and in vitro systems [ 9,10 ] .
deep - frying is a convenient and rapid process to produce fried foods with intense flavor [ 11 ] .
in this process , food is immersed in edible oil at a maintained temperature ( 150 to 200 degreesc ) for a specific period of time [ 12 ] .
however , in certain conditions , instead of the desirable intensive flavor , undesirable off - odor and toxic compounds from lipid peroxidation can also be produced during deep - frying , which is normally associated with the type of oil used .
the alteration of flavor and oil quality during deep - frying can occur via the hydrolysis , oxidation and polymerization of the oil used as a result of the long exposure to high temperature [ 13 ] .
several in vivo studies revealed the existence of the relationship between deep - frying oil quality intake with oxidative stress level .
the intake of such an altered oil quality could affect both the plasma and mitochondrial membrane [ 14,15 ] .
although oils , like po and rbo , contain bioactive compounds that can protect lipids from oxidation , the reaction can still occur during deep - frying , which results from the degradation of the bioactive compounds , as affected by exposure to high temperature [ 3,13 ] .
therefore , it is important to evaluate the stability and degradation pattern of bioactive compounds in the oils during food preparations , in an effort to get a better picture on effective oil usage before complete depletion of bioactive compounds occur .
the consumer can then gain the beneficial effects from such oils , including the lowering of serum cholesterol and blood pressure , reducing the risk of diabetic necropathy and cardio - reperfusion injury [ 8,16,17 ] .
chiou et al .
[ 18 ] reported that during frying , foods absorb oil , the composition of which is similar to that remaining in the frying pan .
therefore , it is vital to investigate the quality of the oils during and after the frying process .
a number of studies have provided information on the quality deterioration of frying oils , but only a few studies focused on the stability of bioactive compounds during deep - frying [ 19,20,21 ] .
the information regarding the antioxidant degradation kinetic and the changes of these bioactive compounds during deep - frying is relatively scarce .
hence , this study was conducted to evaluate the radical scavenging capacity and prominent bioactive compounds ( alpha - tocopherol , gamma - tocotrienol and gamma - oryzanol ) in po and rbo , as well as to examine their degradation kinetic during the deep - frying of french fries .
2. experimental section 2.1 .
materials yellow palm olein oil ( buruh brand , shah alam , malaysia ) , rice bran oil ( green love brand , amorchai co. , ltd. , bangkok , thailand ) and french fries ( kg brand , shah alam , malaysia ) were purchased from a local supermarket in serdang , selangor , malaysia .
alpha - tocopherol , gamma - tocotrienol and 2,2 - diphenyl - 1 - picrylhydrazyl ( dpph ) were purchased from sigma - aldrich , steinheim , germany .
the gamma - oryzanol standard was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ltd. , beijing , china .
hexane , isopropyl alcohol , acetonitrile , butanol , acetic acid and isooctane were purchased from fisher scientific , u.k. all other reagents and chemicals used were of analytical or hplc grade .
2.2 .
deep - frying model a deep - frying model as described by schroeder et al .
[ 22 ] was adopted with slight modification .
frying oil with an initial volume of 3 l was heated to 180 +/ - 5 degreesc in a kitchen fryer ( philux , model df30ait , libertronic sdn bhd , seri kembangan selangor ) .
french fries ( 100 g ) were then fried in the oil for 2 min , denoted as first batch deep - frying .
the fried french fries were then removed , and the deep - frying was repeated with a new batch of french fries without any time lag .
this procedure was repeated until the 60th frying cycle .
an aliquot of the oil ( 30 ml ) was sampled after each tenth batch of french fries deep - frying to be analyzed and compared with that of fresh oil .
2.3 .
determination of free radical scavenging capacity the antioxidant capacity of fresh po and rbo and after deep - frying ( 20th , 40th and 60th frying cycles ) were determined using the 2,2 - diphenyl - 1 - picryl hydrazyl ( dpph ) radical scavenging assay as described by lee et al .
[ 23 ] .
briefly , 0.7 grams of oil samples were dissolved in 10 ml isooctane as a stock solution .
dissolved oil ( 0.25 ml ) was then added to 1.75 ml dpph solution ( 25 mg.l - 1 prepared in isooctane ) .
the mixture was then vortexed and incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min .
the absorbance was measured at 515 nm using a uv - vis spectrophotometer ( el800 , biotek , winooski , vt , usa ) .
the radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following formula : where abs control is the absorbance of the control reaction ( containing all reagents except the test compound ) and abs sample is the absorbance of the test sample .
synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole ( bha ) and alpha - tocopherol were used as positive controls .
2.4 .
determination of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol were determined according to the american oil chemists' society ( aocs ) ce 8 - 89 [ 24 ] method with slight modifications .
oil was dissolved with 10 ml of hexane : isopropyl alcohol ( ratio 98:2 ) and filtered through a 0.45 mum ( whatman ) nylon membrane filter prior to injecting into a hplc .
an aliquot of sample ( 20 mul ) was analyzed using a normal phase hplc system equipped with chromatography software ( millennium lc - 6a , shimadzu , kyoto , japan ) , a uv detector ( spd - 6a , shidmazu , kyoto , japan ) and pumps .
the separation was performed with an ace 5 silica column ( 250 x 4.6 mm , 5 mum ) operated at ambient temperature .
the mobile phase consisted of hexane : isopropyl alcohol at a ratio of 98:2 ( v / v ) with a flow rate of 1 ml.min - 1 , and the detector was set at 295 nm. the identification of unknown tocopherol and tocotrienol isomers was based upon matching their retention time with those of pure standards , while the concentrations calculated using the peak area based on standard calibration curves .
2.5 .
determination of gamma - oryzanol in rice bran oil the content of gamma - oryzanol was determined according to the method of xu and godber [ 25 ] .
an aliquot ( 0.1 g ) of oil was dissolved in 10 ml hexane : isopropyl alcohol at a ratio of 98:2 ( v / v ) .
the dissolved oil sample was then filtered through a 0.45 mum ( whatman ) nylon membrane filter prior to injecting into a hplc .
the filtered sample ( 20 mul ) was analyzed using an hplc system ( millennium lc - 6a , shimadzu , tokyo , japan ) chromatography manager , a uv detector ( spd - 6a , shidmazu , tokyo , japan ) and pumps .
the separation was carried using a waters reverse - phase ( rp ) mubondapak c18 column ( 250 x 4.6 mm , 5 mum ; waters corp. , milford , ma , usa ) at ambient temperature .
the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile / butanol / acetic acid / water at a ratio of 94:3:2:1 ( v / v / v / v ) .
the flow rate was kept at 1 ml.min - 1 with the isocratic mode , and the detector was set at 330 nm. identification of the gamma - oryzanol component in the rbo was done by comparing its retention with that of pure standard , and quantification was done based on the standard calibration curve .
2.6 .
determination of degradation kinetics using the order of reaction equation according to taoukis et al .
[ 26 ] , the degradation kinetics of many compounds in foods at constant temperature follows the first - order kinetics model , which can be expressed as follows : - dc / dt = kc ( 1 ) integration of equation 1 gives : lnc = lnco - kt ( 2 ) lnc / co = - kt ( 3 ) where c is the concentration of the compound , co is the initial concentration of the compound , t is time and k is the reaction rate constant. by plotting the logarithm of the concentration of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol , respectively , over the initial concentration against a number of frying cycles during the degradation process , the degradation rate constant for each compound was calculated from the slope of the simple linear regression line .
2.7 .
statistical analysis all frying experiments and analyses were conducted in triplicate .
data was analyzed statistically through one - way anova by duncan 's multiple range tests using the commercially available software , the spss 16 software program ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
a p - value of less than 0.05 ( p < 0.05 ) was considered to denote statistical significance .
3. results and discussion 3.1 .
antioxidant capacity of the oils in this study , free radical scavenging activity utilizing the dpph radical was done in determining the antioxidant capacity of the oils , due to its simplicity and wide use in antioxidant research .
the free radical scavenging capacity of po and rbo after the 20th , 40th and 60th frying cycle is shown in figure 1 .
results showed that there is no significant difference in the antioxidant capacity between the fresh and the 20th frying cycle po. however , a significant ( p < 0.05 ) decrease in the activity was observed for the oil from the 40th and 60th frying cycle .
on the other hand , there was no significant difference in the antioxidant activity exhibited by all the batches of rbo .
this indicates that rbo is more stable compared to that of po upon deep - frying .
it was also noted that rbo derived from the 40th and 60th frying cycle exhibited significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher radical scavenging activity than that of po. the radical scavenging assay is one of the common methods that can be used to determine the antioxidant capacity of vegetable oils [ 27 ] .
the results of the study showed that both po and rbo exhibited good antioxidant capacity .
however , the antioxidant capacity of po decreased with deep - frying .
this is probably attributed to the degradation of bioactive compounds as a result of the exposure to high temperature used during deep - frying .
results presented here are in line with that of a previous study conducted by gomez - alonso et al .
[ 28 ] , where the reduction of antioxidant activity of olive oil correlated well with the number of deep - frying cycles .
however , similar the destruction of some of these bioactive compounds may not be occurring in rbo , as the antioxidant activity in the oil was preserved throughout the frying process .
3.2 .
degradation of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol during deep - frying the degradation of alpha - tocopherol in po and rbo during deep - frying is shown in figure 2 .
as expected , results showed that the concentration of alpha - tocopherol in po decreased significantly with deep - frying .
similar to that of its antioxidant activity , alpha - tocopherol content decreased from 1.29 mg.g - 1 to 0.59 mg.g - 1 after the 60th frying cycle , depicting a loss of 54 % .
surprisingly , alpha - tocopherol in rbo was found to be more stable and remained almost unaffected upon deep - frying up to the 60th frying cycle .
the contents of alpha - tocopherol in fresh rbo and the 60th frying cycle were 0.75 mg.g - 1 and 0.73 mg.g - 1 , respectively , a loss of only 2 % .
this is reflected in the antioxidant activity exhibited by the oil .
the degradation of alpha - tocopherol in po is in agreement with that of previous literature [ 14,15 ] .
battino et al .
[ 14 ] found that alpha - tocopherol in olive oil was degraded up to 28 % from the initial value after frying for 60 min .

figure 3 showed the degradation of gamma - tocotrienol in deep - fried po and rbo .
there was a similar trend on the loss of gamma - tocotrienol in both oils during the deep - frying of french fries , where it decreased significantly with frying .
however , interestingly , gamma - tocotrienol 's content in rbo was always higher than that of po in all batches of oils .
the fresh po and the 60th frying cycle po consisted of 0.79 mg.g - 1 and 0.28 mg.g - 1 tocotrienol , respectively depicting a loss of 65 % .
whereas , the content of gamma - tocotrienol in fresh rbo and the 60th frying cycles of rbo were 1.34 mg.g - 1 and 0.77 mg.g - 1 , respectively , showing a lower loss of 42 % .

a,b , the values with different small letters indicate a significant difference between frying cycle numbers at p < 0.05 .
during the deep - frying of fries , the decrease in the concentration of tocopherols and tocotrienols in po might have occurred due to their protective role against oxidation and degradation upon exposure to high temperature .
a similar observation has been reported by hoffmann [ 29 ] , where at a high temperature , tocopherols and tocotrienols tend to protect the oil by oxidizing themselves to quinones and dimers .
the present result also indicated that alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol in po degraded at a faster rate than that of rbo .
generally , po consisted of an equal amount of saturated fatty acid to unsaturated fatty acid , whereas rbo contained a higher amount of unsaturated fatty acid , usually up to 74 % .
a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in rbo , relative to po , could be correlated to the greater number of double bonds in the former oil [ 21,22 ] .
therefore , it can be suggested that during the deep - frying of rbo , these unsaturation might have competed with tocopherols and tocotrienols as substrates for oxidation , resulting in a slower degradation of these antioxidants .
in addition , a higher degree of unsaturation , as a basis of more competitiveness of the fatty acids towards oxidation , may explain the high degradation rate of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol in po as compared with that of rbo [ 30 ] .
this is in agreement with that reported by hoffmann [ 29 ] , who showed that during the propagation phase of oxidation , the fatty acid peroxy free radicals may react preferentially with the phenolic hydrogen molecule of tocopherol .
seppanen et al .
[ 31 ] reported that the antioxidant activities of tocopherols and tocotrienols in oils are mainly due to their abilities to donate phenolic hydrogen to reactive lipid free radicals , thus retarding the normal steps of autocatalytic lipid peroxidation .
tocopherols can effectively scavenge peroxy radicals and yield relatively stable products , which interrupt the propagation stage of the oxidative chain reaction , thereby preventing the destruction of lipid molecules [ 32,33 ] .
it is interesting to note that the concentration of alpha - tocopherol in rbo was maintained during the deep - frying of the fries exhibiting only a low percent loss ( figure 2 ) .
in contrast , the content of gamma - tocotrienol in rbo decreased considerably with increased frying .
in rbo , gamma - tocotrienol is expected to possess higher antioxidant activity than that of alpha - tocopherol .
this was also applied to po , which exerts the same trend [ 22 ] .
therefore , it can be suggested that gamma - tocotrienol was firstly oxidized in order to protect other weak antioxidants .
this is in agreement with that reported by rossi et al .
[ 30 ] , where among vitamin e homologs , gamma - tocotrienol was found to be the least stable and easily oxidized during deep - frying , which might be attributed mainly to its protective role and self - degradation in preserving other homologues , such as tocopherols .
apart from that , the initial content of gamma - tocotrienol in fresh rbo was significantly higher than that in po , although the concentration of both decreased with an increase in the number of frying cycles .
therefore , with a higher concentration , the protective effect of gamma - tocotrienol in preserving alpha - tocopherol was evident .
3.3 .
degradation of gamma - oryzanol in rice bran oil during deep - frying figure 4 showed the degradation of gamma - oryzanol in rbo over the 60th frying cycles .
the concentration of gamma - oryzanol in rbo was seen to decrease significantly ( p < 0.05 ) in accordance to the number of frying batches .
fresh oil , containing 3.0 mg.g - 1 gamma - oryzanol , was reduced to 2.8 mg.g - 1 at the 20th cycles , 2.6 mg.g - 1 after 40 cycles and 2.4 mg.g - 1 after 60 batches .
the remaining gamma - oryzanol content in rbo after the 60th frying cycles was estimated to be 80 % of the original amount in the fresh oil .
rbo naturally contains alpha - tocopherol , gamma - tocotrienol and gamma - oryzanol , making it a suitable model to study the synergistic interaction between these bioactive compounds in protecting lipids from oxidation .
the ability of a compound to inhibit the oxidation process is via several mechanisms .
gamma - oryzanol is one of the most potent antioxidant compounds reported .
it is interesting to note that besides acting as an antioxidant to prevent oil from oxidation , gamma - oryzanol is also associated with decreasing cholesterol in plasma , platelet aggregation and cholesterol absorption [ 34,35,36 ] .
in addition , gamma - oryzanol has also been used to treat nerve imbalance and disorders of menopause in women [ 37 ] .
the results in this study indicated that gamma - oryzanol in rbo was degraded with the number of frying cycles , and its degradation is parallel to that of gamma - tocotrienol .
however , the alpha - tocopherol content in rbo did not decrease significantly ( p < 0.05 ) until the 60th frying cycles ( figure 2 ) .
thus , it can be assumed that , in rbo , gamma - oryzanol and gamma - tocotrienol synergistically protect alpha - tocopherol from degradation during deep - frying .
the presence of gamma - oryzanol in rbo may confer a protective effect for alpha - tocopherol , thus slowing down its degradation compared to that in po. this observation was in agreement with that of kochhar [ 38 ] , who reported that gamma - oryzanol has substantial synergistic effects with tocopherols .
similarly , the higher amount of gamma - oryzanol , due to the addition of rbo to soybean oil , was related to the synergistic antioxidant effects in preserving tocopherol degradation during the frying of dough [ 39 ] .
figure 4 the degradation of gamma - oryzanol in rbo during deep - frying .
the values given are means +/ - standard deviation of a triplicate analysis .
the values marked with the same letters are not significantly different at p < 0.05 analyzed using the duncan multiple range test .
rbo usually contains oryzanol up to 1.5 % and is well known for its good stability as a frying oil [ 6 ] .
even though rbo contained a higher percent of gamma - oryzanol in comparison to that of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol , the main reaction that caused the degradation of gamma - oryzanol during deep - frying is due to the oxidation process [ 40 ] .
in the present study , the antioxidant capacity of po as measured by dpph decreased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) after deep - frying , similar to its alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol degradation .
in contrast , the antioxidant capacity of rbo did not decrease significantly over 60 frying cycles .
the slow degradation of gamma - tocotrienol and the retention of alpha - tocopherol in rbo was probably attributed to the preservation of its antioxidant activity .
this is in agreement with the findings of nanua et al .
[ 41 ] , who reported that gamma - oryzanol can improve the stability of rbo and acts as a natural antioxidant to improve the stability of several fried foods .
hence , it is suggested that blending po with rbo might be helpful to preserve the tocol content during deep - frying .
3.4 .
degradation kinetic of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol during deep - frying the first order kinetic plots of the degradation of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol in po and rbo during deep - frying of french fries are presented in figure 5 and figure 6 , respectively .
the kinetic constant of degradation ( k ) of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol and the determination of the coefficient ( r2 ) for po and rbo during deep - frying is shown in table 1 .
the results showed that the first - order kinetics model can be applied to approximately describe the degradation reaction of alpha - tocopherol in po , but not in rbo .
it is reported that the degradation kinetics of many compounds in foods at constant temperature will follow the first - order kinetics model [ 26 ] .
this is in good agreement with the findings of sabliov et al .
[ 42 ] , where heat during frying caused the degradation of free alpha - tocopherol followed first order kinetics and holding oils at 180 +/ - 5 degreesc showed the greatest degradation rate .
figure 5 first order kinetic plots of the degradation of alpha - tocopherol in palm oil and rice bran oil during deep - frying .
figure 6 first order kinetic plots of the degradation of gamma - tocotrienol in palm oil and rice bran oil during deep - frying .
antioxidants - 03 - 00502 - t001 _ table 1 table 1 kinetic constant ( k ) of degradation of alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol and the coefficient of determination ( r2 ) of palm oil and rice bran oil during deep - frying .
variable k ( min - 1 ) coefficient of determination , ( r2 ) alpha - tocopherol in palm oil 0.004 0.961 alpha - tocopherol in rice bran oil 0.000 0.041 gamma - tocotrienol in palm oil 0.006 0.972 gamma - tocotrienol in rice bran oil 0.003 0.880 in the present study , the reaction rate constant for the degradation of both alpha - tocopherol and gamma - tocotrienol upon deep - frying can be obtained using the order of reaction equation .
the reaction rate constants of the degradation of alpha - tocopherol in po and rbo were found to be 0.009 min - 1 and 0 min - 1 , respectively and their correlation coefficients ( r2 ) were found to be 0.961 and 0.041 , respectively .
similarly , gamma - tocotrienol in po and rbo obeyed the first - order kinetics with the reaction rate constants of degradation being 0.0061 min - 1 and 0.0031 min - 1 , respectively , and their correlation coefficients were found to be 0.972 and 0.88 , respectively .
the results are in line with that of previous studies that showed that tocopherols and tocotrienols decrease as a function of time and temperature , following first - order kinetics [ 43 ] .
results from the present study showed that gamma - tocotrienol in po ( k = 0.0061 min - 1 ) degraded faster than that of alpha - tocopherol in po ( k = 0.0049 min - 1 ) .
in addition , it was reported that the antioxidant property of gamma - tocotrienol is better than that of alpha - tocopherol [ 22 ] .
similarly , the antioxidant capacity of gamma - tocotrienol under heating conditions in stripped oils is better than that of alpha - tocopherol [ 44 ] .
therefore , it could be suggested that the faster degradation of gamma - tocotrienol could be due to its greater antioxidant activity .
4. conclusions based on the present study , it is concluded that po and rbo are good sources of natural antioxidants that include tocols and oryzanols .
these compounds exhibited degradation at a faster rate in po compared to that of rbo , with the degradation kinetics obeying the first - order kinetics .
it was also noted that alpha - tocopherol does not degrade to a significant extent in rbo by virtue of the presence of gamma - oryzanol , indicating the synergy between the bioactive compounds in maintaining the nutritional value of the oil .

tolerogenic dendritic cells ( toldcs ) have reached patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disease , at least in clinical trials .
the safety of toldcs as intervention therapy has been established , but the capacity to modulate autoimmune response in vivo remains to be demonstrated .
studies have revealed a diversity of regulatory mechanisms that toldcs may employ in vivo .
these mechanisms differ between various types of modulated toldc .
the most often foreseen action of toldcs is through regulatory polarization of naive t cells or activation of existing regulatory t cells , which should ultimately diminish autoimmune inflammation .
yet , selection of a target autoantigen remains critical to expedite tissue specific tolerance induction , while measuring immune modulation incited by toldcs in vivo provides a great challenge .
we will discuss the regulatory action of different types of toldcs and the possible methods to monitor immunological efficacy endpoints for the next generation clinical trials .

the ability of dcs to orchestrate the immune system makes them interesting candidates for therapeutic application .
in autoimmune diseases where the physiological state of self - tolerance is lost , tolerogenic dendritic cells ( toldcs ) could aid in restoring the immunological balance .
several modulating actors have proved to induce dcs with stable regulatory capacity and researchers have since developed clinical grade toldcs suitable for clinical trials ( 6 - 8 ) .
phase i clinical trials with toldcs are ongoing or have been completed in patients with type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) , crohn 's disease and multiple sclerosis proving toldc vaccination safe and well tolerated , encouraging next generation trials to verify the therapeutic efficacy ( 9 - 13 ) .
while disease amelioration is the goal in the long run , immunological changes may be detectable more promptly and understanding the regulatory mode of action of toldcs is essential to define immunological efficacy endpoints .
variation in the methods used for culture makes comparison of toldcs difficult , may therefore lead to diversity and inconsistency when comparing results from clinical trials evaluating different toldcs in different diseases or conditions .
in addition , toldcs with desired therapeutic efficacy have not been identified yet .
current actions such as that of action to focus and accelerate cell - based tolerance - inducing therapies ( http :// www.afactt.eu ) have generated minimum information models to report and interpret data on the quality and preclinical efficacy of toldcs ( 14 , 15 ) .
this may enable the comparison of treatment effects of toldcs generated with other methods .
in this review , we consider regulatory actions of toldcs and discuss the methods to monitor these in vivo as immunological efficacy endpoints for future clinical trials , whether they are described as a common feature or shown only for a certain type of toldc .
using similar immunomonitoring strategies in different trials could also help answering the question whether the variation in the culture methods translates into variable functional properties .
phenotypical characteristics and cytokine profile of toldcs - - mediators for tolerogenic function several approaches have been tested to induce maturation resistant toldcs in vitro ( 2 , 7 , 16 , 17 ) .
common features of toldcs presumed to mediate tolerogenic functions include low antigen presentation capacity , reduced co - stimulatory signals , expression of inhibitory molecules and an anti - inflammatory cytokine profile .
co - stimulatory signals such as cd80 , cd86 , and cd40 in addition to antigenic stimulation are key to adequate t cell activation and absence thereof leads to unresponsiveness , i.e. , anergy and activation of regulatory t cells ( tregs ) ( 18 , 19 ) .
the balance between pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines il - 12 and il - 10 is important for tolerance .
il - 12 is central in the induction of t helper 1 cells ( th1 ) and high ifn - gamma production. by contrast , il - 10 reduces the antigen - presenting function of dcs , inhibiting th1 responses ( 20 ) .
furthermore , presence of il - 10 is a requisite for the induction of a subset of tregs ( type 1 treg ) , while forkhead box p3 ( foxp3 ) demethylation is dispensable , rather than a condition sine qua non ( 21 - 23 ) .
an overview of phenotype and functions of clinically applied toldcs is provided in table 1 , showing variations of the abovementioned common traits as well as unique features that may initiate regulation through distinctive mechanisms .
most toldcs show reduced expression of co - stimulatory molecules and hla - dr , while expressing inhibitory molecule pd - l1 ( 8 , 10 , 24 , 25 ) .
toldcs treated with antisense oligonucleotides against co - stimulatory molecules cd40 , cd80 , and cd86 ( antisense toldc ) , and nf - kb inhibitor ( nf - kb toldc ) demonstrate low tnf and il - 10 production ( 10 , 26 ). by contrast , toldcs induced with combined dexamethasone and vitamin a or vitamin d3 show high production of il - 10 ( 8 , 24 , 25 , 27 ) .
gene and protein expression data revealed cd52 as candidate marker specifically for vitd3 - dex - modulated toldc ( 28 ) and mertk was identified in dex - vita toldcs as a specific molecule involved in the negative regulation of t cell activation ( 29 ) , yet these markers remain to be validated in other toldcs .
although efforts have been made to find molecules underlying toldc function , common regulators of tolerogenicity have not been found ( 28 , 30 ) .

while the knowledge about ligands and soluble mediators help us understand how toldcs shape immune response and may be utilized as clinical release criteria for in vitro generated toldcs , none of them have proved to be unique to serve as a biomarker of toldcs in vivo , while their efficacy to achieve therapeutic efficacy remains to be confirmed .
hyporesponsiveness of effector cd4 and cd8 t cells a common trait of toldcs is the suppression of effector t cells ( table 1 ) ( 2 ) .
toldcs inhibit t cell proliferation either directly by inducing anergy or apoptosis , or through the induction of tregs .
death receptor ligands such as pd - l1 function as direct negative regulator of t cell response .
toldcs treated with vitd3 delete t cells antigen specifically with co - ligation of pd - 1 ( 32 ) .
another mechanism through which dex - vita toldcs inhibit t cell proliferation is through mertk .
mertk is a family of tam tyrosine kinase receptors and directly inhibits t cell activation through competition of pros1 on the surface of t cells , which drives autocrine proliferation ( 29 ) .
furthermore , vitd3 - dex toldcs inhibit naive cd8 t cell proliferation and induce anergy in memory cd8 t cells .
however , this effect is countered by cytotoxic killing of toldcs presenting cd8 epitopes ( 33 ). whether other toldcs similarly affect cd8 t cells , needs to be verified .
altogether , toldcs are capable of inhibiting t cell proliferation through different mechanisms .
this common feature is ideal to utilize as efficacy endpoint in clinical trials .
in vivo alterations of cd4 + t cell responses can be determined with a lymphocyte stimulation test ( lst ) and enzyme - linked immunosorbent spot assay ( 34 ) , which quantifies antigen - specific t cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
the lst was proven valid in predicting graft survival in pancreatic islet transplantation , since increase of proliferation was associated with a rapid failure of islet grafts ( 35 ) .
effects on t cell populations could be further assessed through quantification of effector cd4 t helper subsets ( th1 , th2 , and th17 ) and cd8 t cells by flow cytometry .
moreover , using quantum dot nanotechnology ( qdot ) it is possible to detect and quantify autoreactive cd8 t cells ( 36 ) .
in vivo signs of t cell modulation were already observed in the nf - kb toldc trial by a reduction of cd4 + cd25 + cd127 + effector t cells ( 10 ) .
in vivo , toldcs could alter different t cell subsets with the potential to influence overall disease outcome as affected subsets may have specific pathophysiological relevance for a particular autoimmune disease .
the inflammatory reaction in ra and crohn 's disease is mediated by t helper 1 and 17 ( th1 and th17 ) cells secreting pro - inflammatory cytokines ifn - gamma , il - 17 , and il - 22 ( 37 , 38 ). by contrast , autoreactive cd4 t helper cells contribute to t1d pathogenesis but cytotoxic cd8 t cells are the main offenders , destroying the insulin producing beta cells ( 39 - 41 ) .
therefore , harmonizing assays and following changes in multiple t cell subsets in response to toldc treatment could enable comparison and correlation to clinical outcomes in different trials .
induction of tregs perhaps the most important and diverse mechanism of toldcs is the induction of tregs , which has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo ( 17 ) .
these induced tregs are suspected to suppress pathogenic autoimmune processes by effector t and b cells involved in a multitude of autoimmune diseases .
so far , several treg populations have been described , and toldcs can induce or activate various tregs depending on the dc modulating agent .
naturally produced thymic tregs ( ntregs ) are defined using the high and stable expression of transcription factor foxp3 and represent the best described treg subset next to cd4 + foxp3 - type 1 tregs ( tr - 1 ) producing high il - 10 .
in vitro , nf - kb toldcs and dex - dcs promote cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs , while toldcs modulated by dex plus vitd3 also induced tr - 1 like tregs ( 23 , 24 , 31 ) .
this is in line with the thought that tr - 1 treg induction is dependent on il - 10 production by toldc ( table 1 ) ( 21 , 22 ) .
membrane bound tnf and pd - l1 are other factors involved in the induction of antigen - specific tregs and may contribute to the capacity of vitd3 - dex toldcs to induce heterogeneous treg subsets which suppress through distinct mechanisms such as killing of monocytes and inhibition of naive or effector t cell proliferation ( 23 , 42 , 43 ) .
indeed , toldcs generated by vitd3 - dex induce at least three different types of tregs ( 23 ). whether these features are shared by tregs induced by different types of toldcs , and whether the variety of tregs induced by toldcs extends to other types remains to be investigated .
induction of tr - 1 like tregs seems preferred over ntreg induction , since the antigen specificity of the latter is undefined .
ntregs may therefore suppress any effector t cell response , including those against cancer , whereas tr - 1 cells with defined specificity will exclusively exert their action when their cognate target of choice ( e.g. , islet autoantigen ) is recognized .
similar to determining effector t cell responses , the quantification and qualification of tregs in patients in relation to toldc treatment is an essential tool in all trials .
indeed , an upregulation of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + tregs was observed in humans injected with dex - vita toldcs ( 12 ) .
most studies were limited to measuring circulating foxp3 + tregs which possibly underestimates the therapeutic effect , since tr - 1 tregs induced by il - 10 producing toldcs need not express foxp3 ( 21 - 23 ) .
another problem with simply looking at foxp3 expression is that this transcription regulator is also transiently expressed in activated t cells , thus cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + cells represent a mixture of both tregs and activated effector t cells ( 44 , 45 ) .
lastly , an observed increase of cd4 + cd25 + foxp3 + cells could be indicative of an expansion of dedicated ntregs or newly induced tregs from naive t cells in the periphery ( 45 , 46 ) .
additional markers such as icos , pd - 1 and cytotoxic t lymphocyte - associated protein 4 ( ctla - 4 ) could help us describe suppressive cells in response to toldc action .
yet , due to a lack of a common marker for all tregs , measuring the suppressive capacity of t cells in a suppression assay remains the only valid method to determine whether tregs are present ( 47 , 48 ) .
infectious tolerance and linked suppression it becomes increasingly clear that the interaction between tregs and dcs is bidirectional since dcs induce tregs , which in turn impact dc development reducing co - stimulatory ligands and stimulation of suppressive molecules ( 49 , 50 ) .
ctla - 4 expression on tregs modulates dcs by scavenging the co - stimulatory ligands on dcs through the process of trans - endocytosis ( 51 ) .
tregs induced by vitd3 - dex toldcs stimulate the expression of inhibitory b7 - h3 and icos ligand ( i.e. , b7 - h2 ) on inflammatory dcs upon cognate interaction , which thereafter induced il - 10 producing t cells with other antigen specificities causing infectious tolerance ( 50 ) .
another molecule described on modified dcs is b7 - h4 , which is up - regulated under influence of il - 10 secretion by cd4 + cd25 + tregs ( 52 ) .
hence , toldc can exert infectious tolerance through the capacity of tregs to induce linked suppression and potentially modulate other dcs in vivo to acquire tolerogenic phenotype and function .
in this way , induced tregs can augment the suppressive capacity of toldcs by transferring regulatory properties to other inflammatory dcs .
so far , this complementary action is proven in vitd3 - dex toldcs but is yet to be validated in other , such as antisense and nf - kb toldcs .
in vivo , analysis of dcs acquiring the expression of inhibitory molecules from the b7 family ( b7 - h2 , b7 - h3 , and b7 - h4 ) or a spreading of tolerance to antigens other than that carried by toldc - vaccine may be an additional lead to monitoring of tolerance induction in the trials and create legacy of tissue specific immune regulation beyond the lifetime of the injected toldcs .
importance of antigen - specific tolerance induction the ultimate goal of toldc therapy is the induction of targeted tolerance , thereby impeding autoimmune inflammation in the affected lesion .
addition of one or more target antigen ( s ) will guide toldcs to address effector cells which is desirable to induce disease - relevant immunomodulation .
for this purpose , established disease - associated autoantigens are necessary .
this may be a straight - forward approach in the case of t1d and multiple sclerosis where tissue specific antigens are identified as suitable targets ( 53 - 57 ) .
since toldcs induce tregs that act through linked suppression , regulation will not be limited to the antigen to which the tregs were generated , but spread to all other specificities presented by residency dcs in the lesion or draining lymph nodes .
however , in some autoimmune diseases , specific autoimmunity - inducing antigens are unknown or associated antigens are not tissue specific .
citrullinated antigens and dead - cell - related epitopes associated with ra and systemic lupus erythematodes , respectively are present throughout the body , which obscures the desire to induce specific tolerance ( 3 , 58 ) .
antigens involved in crohn 's disease also remain unidentified despite great efforts ( 12 , 37 ) .
in the latter case , application of toldcs will rely on the migratory capacity of toldcs to the pathogenic lesion and local uptake of proteins and presentation in tolerogenic context .
in whichever way it may be achieved , the antigen specificity of tolerance induction is essential to avoid general immune suppression and should be closely monitored , for example by measuring the proliferative response against pathogens included in the childhood immunization program .
suppression of b cells a rarely studied effect of toldcs is the regulation of b cells , as suggested by preliminary clinical data , but the clinical relevance of such b cell modulation in vivo needs to be confirmed .
patients with ra treated with citrullinated peptide loaded nf - kb toldcs showed reduced anti - ccp iga / igg levels , which correlated with clinical improvement ( 10 ) .
similarly , a significant reduction of antigen - specific autoantibodies was observed in another clinical trial with toldcs in ra patients ( 13 ) .
the mechanism through which toldcs regulate b cells is still undiscovered .
dcs play an important role in the function of b cells through transferring antigens to naive b cells and initiation of antigen - specific antibody responses .
in addition , dcs provide b cells with isotype - switch signals and promote b cell proliferation and survival through cd40 ( 59 , 60 ) .
it is plausible that toldcs lack the capacity to stimulate b cells resulting in reduced activity of plasma cells or regulate b cell activity indirectly by inducing tregs .
inhibition of b cell function may not be equally important in all autoimmune diseases as the role of b cells in the pathophysiology of t1d is largely elusive , and islet specific antibody titration does not correlate with disease progression ( 55 , 61 , 62 ) .
yet , regardless of whether b cells are pathogenic , bregs may still prove valuable in disease modulation ( 62 , 63 ) .
more recent data show evidence of toldc involvement of breg induction ( 11 ) .
b cells with suppressive activity ( bregs ) have been described in the past , but their biology is just beginning to unravel .
the so - called bregs regulate through promotion of treg development and suppression of effector cd4 and cd8 t cells ( 64 ) .
the phenotype of bregs could be characterized by the expression of various surface markers ( cd19 , cd21 , and cd23 ) and the expression of il - 10 .
recipients of antisense toldc vaccination showed an increase of il - 10 producing bregs in peripheral blood , these bregs inhibited allogeneic t cell proliferation in vitro independent of tregs ( 11 , 65 ) .
dex - vitd3 toldcs increased a population of cd19 + il - 10 + bregs in vitro ( 24 ) .
the underlying mechanism of breg induction is largely unknown , and il - 10 may be involved .
more specifically in the case of antisense toldc , the antisense oligonucleotide mixture may stimulate expression of cd40l and il - 7 on toldcs and drive breg induction ( 24 , 65 ) .
dependent on the pathophysiology of the disease in question , quantification of b cell populations or measuring of disease - specific antibody titers could be relevant .
the potential role of toldcs in breg induction should be further explored in other types of toldcs and may proof relevant as additional player with regulatory property .
potential metabolic effects of toldcs gene expression data and proteomics have revealed considerable changes in metabolic pathways in toldcs induced by vitd3 or vitd3 - dex ( 16 , 25 , 66 , 67 ) , which might affect the microenvironment where toldcs exert their tolerogenic function .
interestingly , toldcs induced by other agents such as dexamethasone alone or rapamycin did not show similar metabolic changes ( 68 ) .
the increase of metabolic rate through upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation while maintaining or enhancing glycolysis ( 28 , 68 ) , may be a phenomenon similar to the so - called warburg effect ( 69 ) .
this will result in enhanced glucose uptake and fermentation to lactic acid and may be a target for in vivo monitoring upon toldc treatment .
the ability of toldc to switch from aerobic respiration to anaerobic glycolysis may have several functional implications .
it is presumed to enhance toldc longevity and resistance to metabolic stress in inflammatory milieu , where low oxygen and glucose levels prevail .
experiments in vitro showed that while glucose was essential in the metabolic programming of vitd3 toldc , the regulatory phenotype remained stable in hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions after induction ( 68 ) .
the increase in oxidative phosphorylation activity may surge reactive oxygen species ( ros ) as byproduct and cause damage to cells with no effective antioxidative machinery in the close proximity ( 25 ) .
the enhanced glucose throughput may cause nutrient deprivation , which can activate intracellular metabolic sensors such as mtor controlling the homeostatic proliferation of tregs ( 70 ) .
thus , metabolic changes inside toldcs may result in an immune suppressive effect through nutrient deprivation supporting treg proliferation and the secretion of ros damaging immune cells in the proximity .
it is difficult to envisage how such effects may be monitored in vivo as the effect may be local and easily compensated to non - detectable changes in the circulation .
still it may be interesting to explore this uncharted field of immunometabolism as potential functional activity of toldcs in vivo .
concluding remarks application of toldc therapy in the clinical setting is an exciting progression toward specific tolerance induction in patients with autoimmune diseases .
we now face the challenge to establish the efficacy of toldc therapy .
results from phase i clinical trials using toldcs show preliminary effects regarding immune regulation in vivo .
in this review , we evaluated the regulatory mechanisms of different types of toldcs to find potential immunological efficacy endpoints , which are summarized in figure 1 .
lymphoproliferative assays measuring the response to disease - associated antigens provide an elegant method to grasp a view of antigen - specific t cell modification , whereas examining affected immune subsets such as tregs may prove a holy grail that requires appropriate assay improvements .
features that particular toldcs exert , such as the induction of bregs may be further explored in other toldcs , to assess whether these are unique to certain types of toldcs or common assets .
a better understanding of the phenotypical properties of the different toldc and affected immune cells will provide essential information for choosing the preferred type of toldc and designing appropriate monitoring endpoint .
therefore , harmonizing assays and following changes in multiple t cell subsets in response to toldc therapy could enable comparison and correlation to clinical outcomes in different trials .

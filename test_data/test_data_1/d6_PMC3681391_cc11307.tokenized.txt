abstract introduction the aim of this study was to compare the epidemiology , risk factors , severity and outcome of two types of icu - treated candidemias : namely , icu - acquired candidemia ( acquired after 48 - hour icu stay ) ( icuac group ) , and those needing icu treatment for candidemia acquired before icu admission or during the first 48 - hour icu stay ( non - icuac group ) .
methods a retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2000 and 2009 in a mixed tertiary icu among patients with blood - culture - confirmed candidemia .
results the study involved 82 patients ( 53 men ) .
the icuac group consisted of 38 patients ( 46.3 %) and the non - icua group included 44 patients ( 53.6 ) .
the icuac group had undergone previous surgery more often and had icu stays that were 3.7 times longer than the non - icuac group , whose members more often had co - morbidities ( 95.6 % versus 73.7 % , p = 0.001 ) .
the icuac group had significantly more frequent organ failures with cardiovascular , renal , central nervous and coagulation systems than the non - icuac group .
icu , hospital and one - year mortality rates did not differ between the groups ( 23 % , 36.8 % and 65.8 % , respectively , in the icuac group and 26 % , 44.4 % and 64.4 % , respectively , in the non - icuac group ) .
among patients with apache ii scores greater than 25 , the icuac group had lower one - year mortality ( 65.0 % versus 87.5 %) .
among patients with apache ii scores of 25 or less , the icuac group had higher mortality ( 66.7 % versus 50.0 ) .
candida albicans was most common cause of candidemia in both groups ( 76.3 % and 68.9 % , respectively ) .
conclusions more than half of the icu - treated candidemias were acquired prior to admission to the icu .
patients with icu - and non - icu - acquired candidemias had different risk factors and different needs for icu resources .
hospital mortality was similar in both groups ; however , the groups had different mortality rates when the severity of disease and underlying diseases were taken into account .
introduction candida species are among the most common microbes causing severe infections in patients in icus .
recent european publications of the causes of bloodstream infections ( bsi ) have listed candida species as between the fifth and tenth most common causative pathogen [ 1 ] .
candidemia is associated with increased overall morbidity and attributable mortality , longer duration of icu stay , as well as increased cost [ 2 - 5 ]. c. albicans has been the most common isolate ( 60 % to 70 %) among patients with icu - acquired candidemia , followed by c. glabrata ( 15 % to 20 %) .
some publications have shown an increase of candidemias with non - albicans candida species , although contrary results have also been published [ 4,6 - 10 ] .
among icu patients , candidemia is typically a late - onset nosocomial infection .
as far as can be determined , few studies have investigated the characterization types of candidemias in the icu .
specifically , this refers to candidemias acquired prior to icu admission ( non - icuac group ) or within 48 hours of admission and those who have an icu - acquired candidemia ( icuac group ) , that is , more than 48 hours after icu admission [ 1,11 ] .
the present study examined whether these two candidemia groups have different risk factors , severity , outcomes or resource utilization or the spectrum of candida species .
materials and methods study location and design the study was conducted at oulu university hospital , a 900 - bed tertiary - level teaching hospital .
the mixed medical - surgical icu is an 11 - bed unit with three two - bed rooms , one three - bed room and two single - bed rooms .
this icu has between 750 and 800 annual admissions .
data from patients admitted into the medical - surgical icu between 2000 and 2009 were evaluated retrospectively .
the list of patients with positive blood cultures for candida species was obtained from the register of the clinical microbiology laboratory of oulu university hospital .
patients were divided into two groups : the non - icuac group , in which candidemia was diagnosed before icu admission or during the first 48 hours after icu admission ; and the icuac group , in which candidemia was diagnosed more than 48 hours after icu admission .
we consulted the chief of the ethical committee and she noted that because the study design was a register - based survey with no contact or consequences to the patients approval from the ethical committee was unnecessary .
study parameters the following information was collected for all study patients : age , gender , severity of underlying diseases , organ dysfunctions on admission as assessed by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation index ( apache ii ) [ 12 ] and sequential organ failure assessment score ( sofa ) with six different types of organ failure [ 13 ] , smoking habits , alcohol or drug abuse , presence of ischemic heart disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , diabetes mellitus or hepatic failure , underlying hematological or other malignancy , recent use of immunosuppressive therapy , elective or emergency operations during the preceding 30 days , and previous antimicrobial therapy .
the length of stay in the icu and in the hospital was recorded , as was icu and hospital mortality .
post - discharge mortality data were obtained from the central statistical office of finland on 28 june 2010 .
microbiological analysis blood cultures were carried out by an automated continuous monitoring screening system of bact / alert ( bio merieux , marcy - l'etoile , france ). between 2000 and 2005 , 10 ml of venous blood was taken into standard aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles if neither antimicrobials nor antineoplastics were used during the preceding seven days ; otherwise , the samples were cultured in in bottles containing neutralizing agents ( ecosorb ) for antimicrobials .
corresponding , new fa / fn bottles have been used since 1999 for all patients suspected of having candidemia , and for all patients , since 2006 .
until the end of october 2008 , blood samples were drawn at the time clinical sepsis was documented and from between 30 minutes and two hours thereafter. from november 2008 , both sets of blood samples were taken at the same time but from different blood vessels .
the blood bottles were screened for up to five days and , in case there was a suspicion of slowly growing bacterial and yeast pathogens , up to 14 days .
positive blood cultures were gram - stained and subcultured .
commercial kits identified yeast growth as c. albicans or yeast , not albicans , within a few hours and further as species level within two days by a api id 32 c ( biomerieux ) .
positive blood cultures were gram - stained and subcultured .
commercial kits identified yeast growth as c. albicans or non - albicans within a few hours , and further as species level within two days .
e - test was used to test antifungal susceptibility to fluconazole , voriconazole , caspofungin and amphotericin b. bacterial and yeast findings were also reported immediately by phone to the clinician .
data registration and statistical analysis the data were entered into a spss database ( spss data entry , version 2.0 , spss inc. , chicago , il ) .
summary statistics for continuous or ordinal variables are expressed as the median with the 25th to 75th percentile .
kaplan - meier survival curves and log - rank test results are presented for simple comparisons between non - icu and icu - acquired candidemia groups .
the apache ii score (< 25 or > 25 ) was used as an adjusting factor in cox 's proportional hazards model to further evaluate the group effect in one - year mortality .
two - tailed p - values are reported , and the analyses were performed by the spss ( version 18.0 , spss inc. , chicago , il ) software .
results characteristics of study groups the total study population consisted of 82 patients with candidemia : 38 in the icuac group and 44 in the non - icuac group .
the incidence of icuac per 1,000 patient days varied from 0.19 ( in 2005 ) up to 0.9 ( in 2000 and 2009 ) .
the proportion of patients with non - icuac slightly increased during the study years , from 50 % ( 19 / 38 ) during the first five - year period to 58 % ( 26 / 44 ) during the last five years .
table 1 presents the main demographic data of the groups .
patients in the non - icuac group more often had underlying co - morbidities ( 96 % versus 46 % , p = 0.01 ) , especially malignancies ( 29 % versus 11 % , p = 0.04 ) .
as table 1 also shows , patients in the non - icuac group had experienced recent surgery significantly less often ( 60 % versus 84 % , p = 0.016 ) and they also had central venous catheters ( 64 %) less often than patients in the icuac group ( 100 % , p < 0.001 ) .
in both study groups , the median time between previous surgery and candidemia was one week ; gastrointestinal surgery ( 39 % of patients ) was most common , followed by plastic surgery ( 8 % of patients ) .

patients in the icuac group had received pre - emptive fluconazole treatment significantly more often ( 13.3 % versus 40 % , p = 0.007 ) .
most patients had also been on antibacterial treatment before candidemia .
the most common antibacterials used in the icuac group and the non - icuac group were as follows : piperacillin / tazobactam in 22 ( 58 %) and 24 patients ( 52 %) , second generation cephalosporins in 15 ( 39 %) and 19 patients ( 41 %) , fluoroquinolones in 15 ( 39 %) and 6 ( 13 %) patients , and carbapenems in 8 ( 21 %) and 6 patients ( 13 %) , respectively .
as table 2 shows , the median apache ii or sofa scores did not differ statistically between the groups .
however , when six different organ failures were compared between the two candidemia groups ( table 3 ) , the patients in the icuac group had significantly higher maximum sofa scores in coagulation ( p = 0.012 ) , cardiovascular ( p = 0.010 ) , central nervous system ( p = 0.000 ) and renal systems ( p = 0.005 ) .
the median duration of hospital stay before icu admission was 1.0 day ( with 25 and 75 percentiles 0.0 to 2.0 ) in the icuac group and 7.5 days ( 1.0 to 16.0 ) in the non - icuac group .
the median duration of hospital stay before positive blood cultures was 12 days ( 7.0 to 19.0 ) in the icuac group and 11 days ( 3.0 to 17.0 ) in the non - icuac group .

laboratory data and clinical characteristics the icuac group had a higher body temperature on the day of positive blood culture than the non - icuac group ( 38.8degreesc versus 38.3degreesc , p = 0.03 ) .
on the other hand , c - reactive protein ( crp ) and leukocyte counts on the day of positive blood culture did not differ between the groups ( crp was 126 mg / l in the icuac group and 165 mg / l in the non - icuac group ( p = 0.7 ) and leukocyte count was 11.3 x109 / l versus 9.4 x109 / l , respectively ) .
abnormal renal function ( creatinine > 90 mmol / l in women and > 100 mmol / l in men ) was noticed in 16 patients ( 42 %) in the icuac group and in 23 patients ( 49 %) in the non - icuac group .
in the icuac group , crp reached its peak on day three after positive blood culture : 160 mg / l ( with 25 percentile of 100 mg / l and 75 percentile of 232 mg / l ) while crp in the non - icuac - group peaked on the day of blood culture at 165 mg / l ( with 25 percentile of 61 mg / l and 75 percentile of 195 mg / l ) .
distribution of candida species c. albicans was the most common isolate in both groups across the entire study period ( table 4 ) .
the proportion of non - albicans species was 26.7 % in the icuac group and 31.1 % in the non - icuac group .
the most common non - albicans species was c. glabrata .
there was a relatively small and non - significant decrease of non - albicans species in the icuac candidemia group between the first five years and the last five years ( 26.3 % versus 21.1 % , respectively ) and , on the contrary , a small non - significant increase in the non - icuac group ( 26.3 % versus 34.6 % , respectively ) .

antifungal treatment the median duration of the antifungal treatment was 22 days in patients in the icuac group and 24 days in the non - icuac group .
the most common antifungal used was fluconazole ( 38 patients ( 73 %) in the icuac group and 35 ( 77 %) in the non - icuac group ) , followed by liposomal amphotericin ( 13 patients ( 34 %) in the icuac group and 16 patients ( 35 %) in the non - icuac group ) and echinocandins ( 12 patients ( 31 %) and 18 patients ( 40 %) , respectively ) .
the median time between positive blood cultures and the beginning of antifungal treatment was less than 24 hours ( with 25th percentiles 0 to 2 - days in both groups ) and there were no differences between the groups .
patients with fluconazole prophylaxis were not included in this analysis .
eighteen patients out of 82 ( 23 % of the whole study population ) developed breakthrough candidemia during fluconazole treatment. of these 18 patients , 16 ( 89 %) had previously been operated on and two ( 11 %) had malignancies .
the median duration of the fluconazole prophylaxis was 7.0 days .
fluconazole - resistant c. albicans or glabrata was found in ten patients , six of whom were in the non - icuac group and four in the icuac group .
four out of ten patients had previously received fluconazole .
hospital mortality was significantly higher among patients with candidemia due to fluconazole - resistant candida than patients with candidemia due to fluconazole - sensitive candida ( 90 % versus 37 % , p < 0.002 ) .
outcome as table 5 shows , the length of hospital stay did not differ between the groups .
the median duration of hospital stay before icu admission was 1.0 day ( with 25th to 75th percentiles 0.0 to 2.0 ) in the icuac group and 7.5 days ( 1.0 to 16.0 ) in the non - icuac group ( p < 0.0001 ) .
the median duration of hospital stay before positive blood cultures was 12 days ( 7.0 to 19.0 ) in the icuac group and 11 days ( 3.0 to 17.0 ) in the non - icuac group .
among the patients in the icuac group , the time between icu admission and the onset of candidemia was 8.0 days ( 1.0 to 12.0 ) .
table 5 the length of icu and hospital stay and mortality data in the icuacg and the non - icuacg .
icuacgn = 38 non - icuacgn = 45 p - value length of hospital stay ( days ) in surviving patients 38.0 ( 22 to 59 ) 40.0 ( 22 to 57 ) 0.762 length of icu stay ( days ) in surviving patients 16.0 ( 11 to 30 ) 4.0 ( 2 to 9 ) < 0.001 icu mortality 8 ( 23 ) 12 ( 26 ) 28 - day mortality 8 ( 21.1 ) 14 ( 31.1 ) 0.33 hospital mortality 14 ( 36.8 ) 20 ( 44.4 ) 0.51 one - year mortality 25 ( 65.8 ) 29 ( 64.4 ) > 0.9 icuacg , icu - acquired candidemia group ; non - icuacg , non - icu - acquired candidemia group .
the length of stay in the icu was significantly longer among the surviving patients with icu - acquired infection ( table 4 ) .
the icu mortality did not differ greatly between the groups ( 23 % versus 26 %) , and the same applies for hospital mortality ( 36.8 % versus 44.4 %) and one - year mortality ( 65.8 % versus 64.4 %) .
the majority of the deaths ( 55.4 %) occurred during the first 60 days after positive blood cultures in both groups ( figure 1 ) .
in the icuac group , one - year mortality among patients who had apache ii scores of 25 or less was higher ( 66.7 % versus 50.0 % , figure 1 ) , while the mortality was lower among patients with apache ii scores greater than 25 ( 65.0 % versus 87.5 % , figure 2 ) .
this result was supported by the multivariate cox model with the interaction term ( group x apache ii score hr 2.7 ; 95 % confidence interval 0.92 to 8.1 ) .

the apache ii score adjusted p - value according to log - rank test is 0.60 .
figure 2 kaplan - meier one - year survival curves in icuacg ( icu acquired candidemia group ) and the non - icuacg ( non - icu acquired candidemia group ) for patients with apache ii scores on admission > 25 .
the apache ii score adjusted p - value according to log - rank test is 0.60 .
discussion the results of this study show that more than half of the candidemia patients treated in the icu acquired the infection before icu admission and more often had co - morbidities , especially malignancies .
on the other hand , the real icu - acquired candidemia patients had undergone surgery more often and they all had central lines .
moreover , icuac patients had statistically higher maximum sofa scores in four of six organ systems .
this study has several strengths .
earlier literature of icu - treated candidemia did not compare the epidemiology and outcome of non - icu onset and icu - acquired candidemias .
the case definition required blood culture confirmation for candidemia .
all blood cultures had been processed in the same microbiological laboratory , which is accredited by the finnish lab quality - system .
moreover , the study followed the long - term outcome of candidemia patients for up to one year .
the study also has some limitations .
due to its retrospective approach , some essential information was probably overlooked .
moreover , the study was only performed in a single mixed icu , so the results cannot be directly extrapolated to other types of intensive care units .
furthermore , the relatively small study groups did not seem to justify the use of multivariate analysis for the risk factors of mortality .
the recent literature includes some reports of increasing figures of the overall incidence of candidemia , as well as icu - acquired candidemia since 2000 [ 3,8 ] .
in the present series , the incidence of icu - acquired candidemia was quite stable during the relatively long study period .
data from the national nosocomial infection system ( nnis ) survey showed a decline in the frequency of candidemia among icu patients in the united states , while the burden of invasive candidiasis is shifting from the icu to the general hospital wards [ 14 ] .
another report from italy also concluded that candidiasis can no longer be considered to be just an icu - related infection and that efforts to design preventive and diagnostic strategies must be expanded to include other at - risk populations and hospital environments [ 15 ] .
recent literature has also reported that nearly one - quarter of candidemias were healthcare - associated [ 16 ] .
these findings are in keeping with ours , where less than half of the patients needing icu treatment due to candidemia belonged to the icuac group .
in our series , ten out of 45 patients ( 22 %) in the non - icuac group had acquired healthcare - associated candidemia before admission ( data not shown ) .
besides , the number of patients in the non - icuac group was almost 1.5 times higher during the last five - year period than in the first five - year period of the study .
one explanation for this could be more active use of blood cultures for the diagnosis of infections in the wards of the studied hospital , where the number of obtained blood cultures increased 2.3 - fold from 2000 to 2009 ( according to the register of the microbiology laboratory ) .
as far as can be ascertained , few publications have compared icu - acquired candidemia patients with non - icu - acquired candidemia cases needing icu treatment .
for example , a large multicenter study with 300 icu - treated patients in french icus did not reveal this specific topic [ 17 ] .
in the present series , the icu stays of the icuac group were 3.7 times longer than patients in the non - icuac group .
moreover , the icuac group had statistically higher maximum sofa scores concerning coagulation , cardiovascular , central nervous and renal systems .
when the two time periods were compared , similar results concerning the circulation and renal systems were observed during the last period .
the risk profiles for candidemia were also different in those groups that had an impact , for example , on prevention of those infections .
patients with icu onset candidemia had a history of previous surgery significantly more often , especially intra - abdominal operations .
in addition , they all had central venous catheters .
on the other hand , patients in the non - icuac group more often had underlying diseases , such as malignancies .
the risk of candidemia in those patients is more probably due to the immunosuppressive condition , which is often hard to influence by infection control methods [ 18 ] .
despite high severity scores on admission , the hospital mortality of candidemia patients treated in the icu was only 43.4 % in the present series , with the similar rates in both groups ( 36.8 % versus 44.4 %) being almost identical to the mortality rate of 42.6 % in the epic ii study [ 19 ] .
hospital mortality in other studies has varied from 26 % to 62 % among patients with c. albicans fungemia , and from 34 % to 90 % among patients with non - albicans candidemia [ 6,11,20 ] .
delayed administration of antifungals had been reported to be a risk factor for worse outcome [ 21 - 23 ] .
in the present series , the median time between taking positive blood cultures and starting antifungal treatment was less than 24 hours in both survey groups .
another explanation of favorable outcome could be the relatively low proportion of non - albicans species .
it is important to note that although almost 40 % of patients in the icuac group had prophylactic or pre - emptive treatment with fluconazole , they developed a breakthrough invasive candida infection .
breakthrough candemia during fluconazole treatment has been reported , for example , in association with hematological malignancies [ 24 ] .
similar breakthrough invasive candidal infections have even been reported during echinocandin treatment [ 25 - 27 ] .
the existing literature has sparse information about the long - term outcome of candidemia patients .
in a nationwide survey of candidemia in israel , one - year mortality was 31.9 % [ 28 ] and 90 % of patients died within 90 days after the identification of candidemia .
in the present icu series , one - year mortality was twice as high ( 65.9 %) , while 60.2 % of the deaths occurred within 90 days .
non - icuac patients with apache scores greater than 25 on admission had higher long - term mortality which reflects the importance of underlying co - morbidities in survival .
the trend of changes in the distribution of c. albicans and non - albicans species has been controversial in the recent literature .
in a recent study from brazil , the proportion of non - albicans species was exceptionally high , at 82 % [ 29 ] .
in harmony with most other recent publications , c. albicans was the most common species in the present study population .
in fact , there was even a small but insignificant decrease of non - albicans species in the icuac candidemia group and a small increase of these species in the non - icuac group .
it has been noted that even a three - year period with routine fluconazole prophylaxis for selected surgical icu patients did not cause an increase of c. glabrata colonization or invasive candidasis due to c. glabrata [ 30 ] .
in conclusion , the present study shows that the majority of icu treated candidemias are actually acquired before icu admission .
the icuac group had more specific organ failures than the non - icuac group .
moreover , the groups had different outcome profiles when the patients were categorized according to apache ii scores .
non - icuac patients more often had underlying co - morbidities , whereas icuac candidemia patients had more often undergone previous surgery and all had central venous lines .
taken together , future studies should account for the fact that icus are treating two different groups of candidemia patients .
key messages * more than half of the icu - treated candidemias are actually acquired before icu admission .
candida albicans is still the most common cause of candidemia .
* patients with non - icu - acquired candidemia have different risk factors than patients with icu onset candidemia .
* patients in the icuac group had significantly higher maximum sofa scores in coagulation , cardiovascular , central nervous system and renal systems than patients in the non - icuac group .

celiac disease ( cd ) is a chronic digestive disease that results in hypersensitivity to the gliadin fraction of gluten .
malabsorption syndrome may be responsible for weight loss , diarrhea , osteomalacia , and vitamins deficiency .
herein we report a patient with coeliac disease ( cd ) who presented with osteomalacia and psoriasis without classical symptoms of cd. a 25 - year - old north african tunisian white woman was admitted to the hospital because of a 1 - year history of bone pain , weight loss and weakness .
she had cutaneous psoriasis on dermatologic examination .
she had also anemia , hypocalcemia and pathological fracture .
she was diagnosed to have osteomalacia on the basis of clinical , biological and radiological findings .
further investigations revealed the presence of antiglutaminase antibodies , and histopathologic findings of the duodenal biopsy were consistent with celiac disease .
the patient showed a fast response to gluten - free diet , and full recovery with calcium and vitamin d replacement .
coeliac disease is frequently misdiagnosed leading to major complications such as osteolamacia .
in the other hand , osteomalacia can still be the presenting feature of undiagnosed celiac disease .
association between osteomalacia and cutaneous psoriasis is rarely reported .
osteomalacia cutaneous psoriasis celiac disease vitamin d bone loss gluten - free diet tunisia background celiac disease ( cd ) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the small intestine precipitated by the ingestion of gluten , in genetically susceptible persons [ 1 ] .
classically , it manifests with intestinal symptoms ( diarrhea , steatorrhoea , abdominal pain or discomfort ) associated with weight loss and anemia .
besides the intestinal symptomatology , the disease is often accompanied by extra intestinal complications including osteopenia or osteoporosis and osteomalacia [ 2 ] .
there are very few reports of osteomalacia as the presenting symptom of cd [ 1,3 ] .
herein we report a patient with undiagnosed coeliac disease ( cd ) who presented with osteomalacia and cutaneous psoriasis without classical symptoms of cd. patient and case report a 25 year - old north african tunisian white woman with unremarkable medical history , presented to our department of internal medicine with erythematic and squamous cutaneous lesions associated to bone pain , weakness and important weight loss .
she complained of a diffuse bone pain which has progressed gradually over the last 2 years to the point that she had difficulties in rising from a chair and walking .
on physical examination , she had pale conjunctive and showed a waddling gait disturbance .
her right hip range of motion was limited and painful .
her weight was 36 kg and her height was 160 cm. she denied any gastrointestinal symptoms .
the dermatologic examination noted a dry erythrodermis to hick squamous with nail psoriatic changes called beau lines ( lines going across the nails ( side to side rather than root to tip ) .
laboratory tests revealed microcytic anemia ( haemoglobin at 9.6 g / dl and mean corpuscular volume at 77 fl ) , severe hypocalcemia ( corrected serum calcium level at 1.84 mmol / l ) , mild hypophosphoremia ( 0.6 mmol / l ) and raised alkaline phosphatase ( 606 ui / l ) .
other laboratory data were normal including erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , serum creatine kinase and liver enzymes .
renal function was within normal value .
work - up disclosed low 25 - hydroxy vitamin d at 4 ng / l ( normal 30 - 100 ng / l ) and high parathormone at 264 pg / ml ( normal 8.7 - 79 pg / ml ) .
the 24 hour urinary calcium was low at 0.28 mmol / day .
x - ray examination of the hip revealed a fracture of the right ilio - pubic rami ( figure 1 ) .
the technetium 99m - whole - body bone scintigraphy evidenced multiple hot spots on the rib cage , sternum and pelvis ( figure 2 ) .
these images were consistent with osteomalacia .
dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) scan was performed .
bone mineral density revealed markedly low density at both lumbar vertebra ( z - score at - 3.5 sd ) and femoral neck ( z - score at - 3.6 sd ) .
the diagnosis of osteomalacia was made by clinical , biochemical and radiological features , and investigations for malabsorption were carried out .
antiglutaminase antibodies were strongly positive ( titre > 140 ui / l ) .
esophagogastroduodenal endoscopic examination with distal duodenal biopsy revealed diffuse villous atrophy accompanied by mononuclear infiltrates consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease .
treatment with calcium supplementation ( 1 g per day ) and vitamin d was prescribed associated with a gluten free diet .
at check - up one month later , the patient had improved markedly with a complete resolution of her symptoms .

a copy of the written consent is available for our patient .
discussion celiac disease ( cd ) is a chronic digestive disease that results in hypersensitivity to the gliadin fraction of gluten .
classically , the disease manifests with diarrhea , weight loss and anemia .
its diagnosis is based on positivity of iga and igg antigliadin and endomysial antibodies and characteristic endoscopic detection of inflammation and atrophy of duodenal mucosa [ 2 ] .
women comprise approximately 75 % of newly diagnosed adult coeliac disease cases and they tend to have more clinically prominent disease [ 1 ] .
the disease is often accompanied by extraintestinal complications including anemia , dermatitis herpetiformis , depression , dementia , dental enamel defects , osteopenia or osteoporosis and osteomalacia [ 1,4 ] .
this patient presented with severe osteomalacia in the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea , steatorrhoea or abdominal discomfort .
an association between celiac disease and osteomalacia was first reported in 1953 [ 5 ] .
it was reported in few cases that osteomalacia could be the presenting feature of coeliac disease [ 3 - 14 ] .
although , two large series of celiac patients have reported no evidence of osteomalacia [ 15,16 ] , many other authors emphasize that cd must be suspected in patients with osteomalacia [ 8,17 ] .
the disease is considered as the second most common cause of osteomalacia after gastrectomy in the united states [ 1 ] .
osteomalacia in adults , like in our patient , starts insidiously with pains in the lumbar region and thighs , spreading later to the arms and ribs .
patients show often an extreme weakness , and there is difficulty in climbing up stairs and getting up from a squatting position .
hypocalcaemia in cd - as in this case - is caused by reduced intestinal calcium absorption as a result of vitamin d deficiency .
it is also due to reduced absorptive area secondary to villous atrophy [ 18 ] .
the mechanism of development of bone pathology in those patients with untreated celiac disease is not fully defined , but chronic negative calcium balance and vitamin d deficiency are the potential factors .
bone loss is explained by the overproduction of cytokines il - 1 alpha , il - 1 beta and tnf - alpha which is further accelerated by hyperparathyroidism connected with malabsorption of calcium and vitamin d. interaction of both these mechanisms increases bone resorption and activates bone loss .
some studies of metabolic bone disease in celiac disease showed that osteomalacia , tetany , and bone fracture can be the presenting symptoms of coeliac disease , especially when the malabsorption is florid [ 11 ] .
however , the occult form of cd seen in our case , which is commonly seen in the elderly , may be associated with a risk of osteoporosis or osteomalacia related fractures , similarly as the classic symptomatic disease [ 2 ] .
we emphasize that the diagnosis of coeliac disease should be suspected in any patient with osteomalacia [ 17 ] .
on the other hand , detailed analysis of calcium metabolism , including markers of bone remodelling and x - ray densitometry ( dxa ) , are recommended in all patients with verified celiac disease [ 1,2 ] .
screening with bone densitometry is helpful in detecting patients at risk of fracture [ 19,20 ] and the presence of severely reduced bone mineral density is associated with fracture at these sites .
a combination of gluten - free diet and vitamin d supplementation is almost an effective mode of therapy [ 17 ] and lead in almost cases to rapid resolution of all symptoms .
our case presented with classical signs of osteomalacia , complicated by secondary hyperparathyroidism , and associated with cutaneous changing .
she showed an excellent response to gluten - free diet and oral vitamin d treatment .
finally , and even the association between osteomalacia and cutaneous psoriasis was rarely reported [ 18 ] , we would like to underline that outside of its action on the phosphocalcic metabolism , the vitamin d acts on the skin , especially on the proliferation of the keratinocytes that allowed its indication in the treatment of the psoriasis [ 18 ] .
conclusion osteomalacia remains a common complication of coeliac disease and may occur even without clinical or a biochemical abnormality of cd as it was shown by our case .
treatment with a gluten - free diet associated with calcium and vitamin d supplementation lead to resolution of symptoms and can dramatically improve bone density .

abstract objective to validate the self - reported diabetes mellitus in adults and older adults living in the city of sao paulo , brazil .
methods we have used data of 569 subjects ( 284 adults and 285 older adults ) , participants of the population - based cross - sectional study inquerito de saude do municipio de sao paulo ( health survey of sao paulo ) .
fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol / l ( 126 mg / dl ) and / or use of drugs ( oral hypoglycemic and / or insulin ) defined the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus .
we have validated the self - reported diabetes mellitus by calculating the sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive values , and negative predictive values .
we have used poisson regression with robust variance to verify the factors associated with the sensitivity of the self - reported datum .
for all analyses , we have considered the sample design of the study .
results the sensitivity of self - reported diabetes mellitus was 63.8 % ( 95 % ci 49.2 - 76.3 ) , specificity was 99.7 % ( 95 % ci 99.1 - 99.9 ) , positive predictive value was 95.5 % ( 95 % ci 84.4 - 98.8 ) , and negative predictive value was 96.9 % ( 95 % ci 94.9 - 98.2 ) .
the correct reporting of diabetes mellitus was more prevalent among older adults ( pr = 2.0 ; 95 % ci 1.2 - 3.5 ) than among adults .
conclusions the use of the datum of self - reported diabetes mellitus is valid , especially among older adults living in the city of sao paulo .
the results highlight the need to track diabetes mellitus in asymptomatic subjects who have one or more risk factors for it , mainly in the adult population of this city .
diabetes mellitus , epidemiology diagnostic self evaluation health surveys reproducibility of results validation studies introduction diabetes mellitus ( dm ) is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia caused by defects in insulin action or insulin secretion1 .
more than 90.0 % of the cases of dm correspond to type 2 dm , whose prevalence is increasing , especially in developing countries3 .
data from 133 studies of 91 countries suggest that the overall prevalence of dm , estimated as 6.4 % in 2010 , will be 7.7 % in 2030 , reaching 439 million persons and representing a significant impact on national health systems18 .
data from 27 brazilian cities assessed in the vigilancia de fatores de risco e protecao para doencas cronicas por inquerito telefonico ( vigitel - risk and protective factors surveillance for chronic diseases by telephone interviews ) showed a prevalence of 6.9 % ( 95 % ci 6.5 - 7.3 ) for self - reported dma , with a growth of 0.21 percentage points per year for the 2006 - 2013 period when prevalence rates were monitored .
data from the same study suggest the prevalence of 8.2 % ( 95 % ci 6.9 - 9.6 ) for self - reported dm in the city of sao paulo in 2013a .
even more alarming figures were presented by the estudo longitudinal de saude do adulto ( elsa - brazil - brazilian longitudinal study of adult health ) , conducted in six brazilian cities with 15,102 civil servants aged 35 - 74 years , whose prevalence of dm was 19.7 % ( 95 % ci 19.0 - 20.3 ) , determined by fasting glucose test , oral glucose tolerance test , and glycated hemoglobin test19 .
in this scenario , the use of information on self - reported dm becomes an important and convenient tool for population monitoring and surveillance , because of its low - cost and speed in data collection and analysis9 .
self - reported dm has often been used in national and international surveys14,16,19 .
some studies have been conducted in order to validate this self - reported information using biochemical tests , for specific locations and populations5,9,13,17,20 .
however , there is no consensus on the precision and accuracy of this datum20 .
thus , the purpose of this study was to validate self - reported dm in adults and older adults living in the city of sao paulo , brazil .
methods we have used data from the inquerito de saude de sao paulo ( isa - health survey of sao paulo ) , a cross - sectional population - based study with probabilistic sampling of the residents of the urban area of this city .
briefly , the sample was calculated by conglomerates in two stages : census tract ( primary sampling units ) and household ( secondary sampling units ) .
in the first stage , 70 census sectors were randomly selected from the register of the pesquisa nacional por amostra de domicilios ( pnad - national household survey ) of 2005 of the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ( ibge ) .
domains of study were set according to age and sex .
in order to preserve the representativeness of each domain , different sampling fractions were applied , considering the participation of age groups in the population of the urban area of sao paulo .
details of sampling are described in alves and escuderb .
the study involved 2,086 adults ( 20 - 59 years ) and older adults ( 60 years or older ) of both sexes. of these , 1,662 had two 24 - hour dietary recalls ( 24hr ) collected for the analysis of food intake and 592 had blood samples taken for the analysis of biochemical data .
there was no difference in terms of sexes , age , income , and education between the original isa sample and the remaining sample18 .
for this study , 569 individuals were selected ( 284 adults and 285 older adults ) , aged 20 years or older , who had their fasting glucose evaluated or who reported the use of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin .
twenty - three individuals were excluded because they had no values for the analysis of glucose .
in 2008 , information was obtained in - home , using a structured questionnaire administered by trained interviewers , who collected demographic , socioeconomic , lifestyle , health conditions , and health care service data .
the first 24hr was collected in the first home visit and conducted using the multiple - pass methodc , in which the respondent is guided through five steps ( quick list , forgotten foods , time & occasion , detail cycle , and final probe ) in a standardized process , which helps to maintain the individuals interested and engaged in the interview , and helps them remember all the items consumed .
the second 24hr was conducted by telephone , two or three days before the second home visit , using the interview system of the nutrition data system for research ( nds - r ) , version 2007 , developed by the nutrition coordinating center at the university of minnesota , minneapolis , mn , usa , which resembles the computerized version of the multiple - pass method ( the automated multiple - pass method ) as it enables the same structure to collect dietary data in five steps .
in the second home visit , we measured the anthropometric and blood pressure parameters , collected venous blood , and investigated drug use .
the data were collected by a previously trained nursing technician , according to the recommendations for measuring weight , height20 , waist circumference7 , and blood pressure17 .
for blood collection , participants were instructed to fast for 12 hours , without eating or drinking ( for alcoholic beverages , the minimum fast should be 36 hours ) , and no physical activity or exhaustive physical efforts should be performed during the 24 hours preceding the test .
blood samples were collected in vacuum tubes with a clot activator ( bd vacutainer , # 368660 , franklin lakes , nj , usa ) , packed in coolers , and immediately transported to the laboratory for processing .
the self - reported dm information was obtained from the structured questionnaire from the answer to the question : " do you have a chronic disease , a long - term disease , or a recurring disease ?" individuals who answered " diabetes ( if only gestational diabetes , select no )" were considered as self - reporting dm. a subsequent question was made : " who told you that you have diabetes ?" all individuals answered that a doctor made the diagnosis .
the laboratory diagnosis was made by measuring fasting serum glucose , using the enzyme glucose oxidase method ( glucose liquiform , labtest , lagoa santa , minas gerais , brazil ) and an automated system ( labmax 240 , lagoa santa , minas gerais , brazil ) .
all biochemical analyses were carried out in duplicate with a 10 % variation limit set as the criterion for repetition of the test .
the use of drugs was investigated by asking the following question on the day of blood collection : " do you currently use any medication and / or supplement ? ?
" which one ?" the use of medication was also considered when the individual selected the options " routinely use insulin " or " routinely take oral medication " for the question " what do you do to control your diabetes ? ?
( question included in the structured questionnaire ) .
the individual was classified as having dm if the value of fasting glucose was >= 7 mmol / l ( 126 mg / dl ) or if he or she used medications ( oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin ) , according to current criteria at the time of the studyd .
prediabetes was characterized by fasting glucose levels between 5.6 mmol / l ( 100 mg / dl ) and 6.9 mmol / l ( 125 mg / dl ) and if no oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin were usedd .
alcoholism was investigated by a specific questionnaire to assess alcohol dependence , named cage ( cut down , annoyed by criticism , guilty and eye - opener ) 6 .
the cutoff point adopted for positivity of the test was two or more positive answers .
usual alcohol consumption was estimated by incorporating 24hr data in the multiple source method program .
physical activity data was collected using the international physical activity questionnaire ( ipaq ) , long version4 .
for the analyses , physical activity of leisure was considered , classified either as sufficient ( practice of physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day , five days a week , of moderate intensity , or at least 20 minutes a day , three days a week , of vigorous intensity ) or insufficient .
body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated as weight divided by the square of height ( bmi = weight [ kg ] / height [ m ] 2 ) and classified according to the world health organization20 for adults and the pan american health organization ( paho ) 10 for older adults .
the bmi data were categorized into overweight ( overweight and obesity ) and not overweight ( underweight and normal weight ) .
waist circumference was classified as adequate or inadequate according to the cutoff points of 88 cm for women and 102 cm for men7 .
hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmhg and diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmhg or the use of drugs for hypertension17 .
the study sample design was considered for all statistical analyses by using survey module commands available on stata version 12.0 .
the significance level was set at 5 % .
the prevalence of dm was calculated for the total population and by age group ( adults and older adults ) .
differences between the relative frequencies of socioeconomic and lifestyle variables according to the presence of dm were analyzed using pearson 's chi - square test .
absolute and relative frequencies were used to compare diagnosed dm and self - reported dm. the validation of self - reported dm was determined by sensitivity ( proportion of individuals with dm that self - reported the condition ) , specificity ( proportion of individuals without dm who reported not having the condition ) , positive predictive value ( proportion of individuals who self - reported dm and were classified as having the condition ) , and negative predictive value ( proportion of individuals who self - reported not having dm and were classified as such ) .
the diagnosis of dm ( fasting glucose >= 7 mmol / l ( 126 mg / dl ) or the use of oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin ) was considered as reference for these calculations .
the validation of the self - reported data was also determined according to the socioeconomic and lifestyle variables .
the univariate poisson regression with robust variance was used to identify factors associated with the sensitivity of self - reported dm , so that the model could determine the probability of correct answer given the presence of dm. the university research ethics committee ( caae 26800414.1.0000.5421 ) and the ethics committee of the municipal health secretariat of sao paulo ( caae 003.0.162.000 - 08 ) have approved this study .
the objectives of the study were explained to all potential participants and we emphasized that their participation would be completely voluntary .
all those who agreed to participate in the study , before starting any procedure , signed the written informed consent .
results the prevalence of dm among residents in the urban area of the city of sao paulo was estimated at 8.0 % ( 95 % ci 6.1 - 10.6 ) , 5.0 % in adults ( 95 % ci 3.0 - 8.2 ) and 20.7 % in older adults ( 95 % ci 16.1 - 26.1 ) .
the prevalence of prediabetes in the study population was 4.4 % ( 95 % ci 2.7 - 7.3 ). of the individuals with dm , 79.5 % ( 95 % ci 64.0 - 89.4 ) were using oral hypoglycemic agents ( 71.9 % of adults and 87.0 % of older adults ) and 11.1 % ( 95 % ci 4.7 - 24.1 ) were using insulin ( 11.9 % of adults and 10.3 % of older adults ). of the individuals who self - reported dm , the older adults accounted for most of those who reported routine medical visits for dm care - 61.3 % ( 95 % ci 40.4 - 78.7 ) for older adults against 38.7 % ( 95 % ci 21.3 - 59.6 ) for adults .
the sample studied comprised subjects that were predominantly female ( 53.4 %) , adults ( 80.7 %) , who self - reported as white ( 51.6 %) , with head of household with six or more years of education ( 72.7 %) , with family income per capita of more than one minimum wage ( 62.4 %) , without partner ( 52.6 %) , and who possibly do not abuse alcohol ( 89.2 %) .
among the individuals with dm , there was a predominance of older adults , with head of household with up to five years of education , former smokers , overweight , with inadequate waist circumference , and hypertensive ( table 1 ) .

discussion the results indicate that , in order to use the self - reported dm datum for residents of the city of sao paulo , we need to consider the age group of the study population , as , while the sensitivity of this information is 85.8 % ( 95 % ci 70.7 - 93.8 ) in older adults , the same is only 42.1 % ( 95 % ci 22.4 - 64.6 ) in adults , even though the sensitivity in the study population is 63.8 % ( 95 % ci 49.2 - 76.3 ) .
a brazilian study that has assessed the self - reported dm information in older adults of the city of bambui , state of minas gerais , brazil , had a sensitivity rate of 57.1 % ( 95 % ci 50.3 - 63.8 ) 11 .
in international studies that have investigated self - reported dm among adolescents , adults and older adults , the sensitivity ranged from 30.1 % ( 95 % ci 24.0 - 36.2 ) to 70.4 % ( 95 % ci 64.5 - 75.8 ) 5,9,13,20 .
the results show that , as in this study , sensitivity depends on the study population .
one of the causes of the variation of sensitivity is the criterion that defines dm for validation of self - reported data .
schneider et al.20 has found that the definition of dm as fasting glucose >= 7.8 mmol / l ( 140 mg / dl ) or the use of drugs had higher sensitivity than the definition of fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol / l ( 126 mg / dl ) or the use of drugs in participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study .
despite this finding , in our study , the classic definition of fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol / l (>= 126 mg / dl ) was chosen to be used as diagnosis , which has been indicated since 1997 by the expert committee on the diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus and accepted by the world health organization and the brazilian diabetes society23 .
the difference found in the sensitivity of self - reported dm among adults and older adults in this study may have occurred because , in the population studied , older persons tend to the visit medical care more often than adults and , therefore , had already been diagnosed with dm. another possible reason is that older adults have more severe cases of the disease , since age is an important risk factor for the development of this condition12,15 .
on the other hand , of the individuals classified with dm and who did not know about the condition , most were adults , a fact that may be related to the initial stage of the disease , when it has not yet been diagnosed .
prediabetes and risk factors related to this condition were present in a substantial part of the study population .
this fact emphasizes the importance of screening to minimize the progression of dm , condition that accounted for 5.4 % of brazilian disability - adjusted life years ( daly ) in 20088 .
the mass screening of individuals who do not show symptoms of dm or prediabetes is not recommended ; however , the american diabetes association suggests tracking the diagnosis of dm by fasting glucose , glycated hemoglobin , or by glucose tolerance test of individuals that are overweight ( bmi >= 25 kg / m2 ) and who have one of the following risk factors : physical inactivity , first - degree relative with dm , high - risk race / ethnic group ( african american , latino , native american , asian american , and pacific islanders ) , women who have been diagnosed with gestational dm , hypertension , hdl - c < 0.9 mmol / l ( 35 mg / dl ) or level of triglycerides > 2.8 mmol / l ( 250 mg / dl ) , women with polycystic ovary syndrome , glycated hemoglobin >= 5.7 % , impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose on previous testing , history of cardiovascular disease , or other conditions associated with insulin resistance .
among those who do not present the mentioned risk factors , the screening of dm should be started in individuals aged 45 years and repeated every three to five years1 .
the screening of dm in brazilian primary care is recommended when asymptomatic individuals have sustained blood pressure greater than 135 / 80 mmhge .
in this study , 57.9 % of the individuals who were unaware of having the disease met this criterion ( data not shown ) .
data from this study shows that 2.9 % of the adults and older adults of sao paulo in 2008 were unaware of having dm. similar result was found in a multicenter study conducted in 1992 , which described the prevalence of 3.4 % of undiagnosed dm in a population aged 30 - 69 years in brazilian urban areas12 .
however , when individuals with dm are taken as total , the proportion of individuals unaware of the condition is 36.2 % .
data from elsa - brazil shows an even higher prevalence ( 50.4 %) of undiagnosed cases of dm15 , a difference that may have occurred because of the age of the population studied , 35 - 74 years , while this study , which uses data from the isa , included individuals aged 20 - 94 years .
age group was associated with sensitivity of self - reported dm in the univariate analysis .
among older adults living in minas gerais , brazil , lima - costa et al. have detected that visiting a doctor within the previous two years and educational level presented a positive association with sensitivity of self - reported dm11 .
educational level has been described as a marker of social differences in health .
data from the pnad shows a higher prevalence of investigated chronic diseases , including dm , in segments of the population with low literacy levels2 , which corroborates the higher prevalence of persons with head of household with up to five years of education among the individuals with dm found in this study .
the specificity of self - reported dm in a national study was 96.0 % ( 95 % ci 94.7 - 97.0 ) .
in international studies , the specificity of this information ranged from 96.8 % ( 95 % ci 96.4 - 97.2 ) to 99.4 % ( 95 % ci 99.2 - 99.7 ) 5,9,13,16 ; therefore , the result of this study is consistent with the literature ( 99.7 % ; 95 % ci 99.1 - 99.9 ) .
diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease with relatively clear diagnostic criteria and it has important implications for the quality of life of individuals that have the disease13 , which may explain the high specificity of this self - reported information .
in this study , the prevalence of dm among residents of the urban area of the city of sao paulo was 8.0 % ( 95 % ci 6.1 - 10.6 ) , whereas the prevalence of self - reported dm was 5.4 % ( 95 % ci 4.0 - 7.2 ) , indicating that , despite the ease of collection and use of self - reported data , the prevalence of this chronic disease is underestimated when self - reported information is used .
the same occurs when we compare the estimated prevalence of dm found in this study and the data from the vigitel - 2008 of sao paulo , whose information is self - reported : 8.0 % ( 95 % ci 6.1 - 10.6 ) versus 6.5 % ( 95 % ci 5.3 - 7.7 ) , respectively16 .
an important limitation of validation studies on self - reported dm is the classification bias11 .
only one measure of fasting glucose was used to classify the participants as individuals with dm in this study , while the ideal would be to repeat the test or to introduce the amount of glycated hemoglobin .
formerly only used for monitoring the glycemic control , glycated hemoglobin has the advantage of not being influenced by blood glucose fluctuations from one day to the next , and it is currently also indicated to confirm the diagnosis of dm or prediabetes1 .
however , because it is a population - based study , we could not measure fasting glucose again or another marker .
furthermore , the use of fasting glucose does not allow diagnosing all individuals with dm , as observed by goto et al.9 however , the inclusion of the biochemical measure in studies increases the validity of the data and reduces the classification bias13 .
it is possible that subjects that were not diagnosed with dm but who self - reported the condition controlled their disease with their lifestyle , such as diet and physical activity , which are also regarded as supporting factors for glycemic control1 .
another possible source of error was the classification of all participants with fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol / l ( 126 mg / dl ) or use of oral medication or insulin as individuals with type 2 dm , with no stratification among the other types of dm or other cases that demand the use of oral hypoglycemic agents .
this fact does not invalidate the results , since type 2 dm represents 90 % to 95 % of all dm cases3. of the individuals with dm , 1.9 % reported age of diagnosis under 18 years , an age group in which three quarters of the cases of type 1 or immune - mediated dm occur , though both did not use insulin , so they could not be classified as individuals with type 1 dm , and it may indicate the early onset of type 2 dm , which is increasingly being diagnosed at younger ages1 .
another limitation was the absolute number of individuals with dm ( n = 82 ) , which restricted the estimation of factors associated with the sensitivity of self - reported dm , producing large confidence intervals for some estimates and preventing us from using the multiple poisson regression model .
however , few variables were associated with the sensitivity of self - reported dm in the univariate analysis , which suggests that the impossibility of carrying out a multiple analysis is not a significant restriction .
the same limitation was observed in a previous study conducted in the netherlands : the utrecht health project13 .
the results obtained in this study provide evidence on the use of the self - reported dm information , often used in national and international studies11,14,19 , validate the data in a representative sample of the city of sao paulo , and provide important prevalence estimates of dm for this city .
in conclusion , self - reported dm is valid , especially in older adults of the city of sao paulo .
it is necessary to consider the age group of the study population in the analysis of this data , which may underestimate the prevalence of diabetes in the study population and reduce the power of association with other variables because of classification error .
therefore , the use of self - reported information will depend on the objectives of the study .
in addition , the results show the need for the screening of dm in asymptomatic individuals that have one or more risk factors for dm , mainly in the adult population .

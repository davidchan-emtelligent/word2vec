autophagy and inflammation play determinant roles in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) , an adult - onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by deterioration and final loss of upper and lower motor neurons ( mn ) priming microglia to sustain neuroinflammation and a vicious cycle of neurodegeneration .
given that extracellular atp through p2x7 receptor constitutes a neuron - to - microglia alarm signal implicated in als , and that p2x7 affects autophagy in immune cells , we have investigated if autophagy can be directly triggered by p2x7 activation in primary microglia from superoxide dismutase 1 ( sod1 ) - g93a mice .
we report that p2x7 enhances the expression of the autophagic marker microtubule - associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( lc3 ) - ii , via mtor pathway and concomitantly with modulation of anti - inflammatory m2 microglia markers .
we also demonstrate that the autophagic target sqstm1 / p62 is decreased in sod1 - g93a microglia after a short stimulation of p2x7 , but increased after a sustained challenge .
these effects are prevented by the p2x7 antagonist a - 804598 , and the autophagy / phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase inhibitor wortmannin ( wm ) .
finally , a chronic in vivo treatment with a - 804598 in sod1 - g93a mice decreases the expression of sqstm1 / p62 in lumbar spinal cord at end stage of disease .
these data identify the modulation of the autophagic flux as a novel mechanism by which p2x7 activates als - microglia , to be considered for further investigations in als .
als atp bzatp lc3b - ii microglia p2x7 fondazione italiana di ricerca per la sclerosi laterale amiotrofica10.13039 / 501100007802path - for - als introduction neuroinflammation plays a determinant role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ; cozzolino et al. , 2012 ) , where degenerating motor neurons ( mn ) contribute to produce danger signals that activate microglia to initiate a self - propagating cytotoxic cascade resulting in muscle weakness , atrophy , spasticity , compromised breathing and finally death in patients ( henkel et al. , 2009 ; ilieva et al. , 2009 ) .
extracellular atp functions as one of such endogenous alarm signal , by operating through purinergic p2 receptors , particularly the p2x7 ionotropic subtype ( beamer et al. , 2016 ; illes and verkhratsky , 2016 ) .
activation of p2x7 in microglia purified from superoxide dismutase 1 ( sod1 ) - g93a mouse model of als exacerbates pro - inflammatory responses exemplified by the levels of cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) , mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) , nadph oxidase 2 ( nox2 ) , nuclear factor kappa - b ( nf - kappab ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) , with a consequent cytotoxicity towards neurons ( d'ambrosi et al. , 2009 ; apolloni et al. , 2013b ; parisi et al. , 2016 ) .
in the sod1 - g93a mouse model of als , we have previously reported that disease onset is significantly anticipated and disease progression is worsened in mice genetically lacking p2x7 , thus suggesting that the receptor has beneficial effects at least during a precise stage of the disease that is however still undefined ( apolloni et al. , 2013a ) .
only when administered to sod1 - g93a mice from late pre - onset , the p2x7 antagonist brilliant blue g enhances mn survival and reduces microgliosis in lumbar spinal cord ( apolloni et al. , 2014 ) , with a slight beneficial effect on disease progression and mice survival ( cervetto et al. , 2013 ; apolloni et al. , 2014 ; bartlett et al. , 2017 ). by confirming the dual role previously recognized for p2x7 ( monif et al. , 2010 , 2016 ) , these findings have highlighted how crucial is the lag of p2x7 modulation for eliciting beneficial effects in als .
autophagy is an ubiquitous and highly conserved homeostatic mechanism by which eukaryotic cells degrade damaged organelles , intracellular components and protein aggregates .
it consists in the sequestration of target cellular materials ( cargo ) into autophagosomes and their subsequent transfer to and catabolism by the autophagosome - lysosome ( autolysosome vacuole ) system ( klionsky and emr , 2000 ; glick et al. , 2010 ) .
abnormalities in autophagy have been implicated in chronic neurodegenerative conditions comprising als , where both patients and animal models are characterized by overexpression of the autophagy marker microtubule - associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( lc3 ) - ii in spinal cord ( song et al. , 2012 ) .
moreover , sequestosome - 1 , a protein also known as ubiquitin - binding protein sqstm1 / p62 encoded by the sqstm1 gene , which is an autophagosome receptor recruiting proteins for selective autophagy , is found accumulated in spinal cord of sod1 - g93a mice , concomitantly with increased extent of autophagic vacuoles ( zhang et al. , 2011 ) .
in mouse microglia and in human epithelial cells , p2x7 has been reported to negatively regulate autophagy by impairing lysosomal function ( takenouchi et al. , 2009a ; haanes et al. , 2012 ) .
conversely , p2x7 apparently increases autophagy in monocytes and macrophages during mycobacterial infections ( biswas et al. , 2008 ) , and acts as a positive regulator of autophagy in dystrophic muscle cells ( young et al. , 2015 ) .
this not only confirms the twofold role often played by p2x7 , but also highlights a context - specific effect of p2x7 on autophagy pathways .
the purpose of this work is thus to learn if p2x7 might participate to als pathogenesis by directly modulating autophagy , and particularly the expression of the autophagosome component lc3 - ii and of the autophagy receptor p62 in sod1 - g93a microglia .
we demonstrate that activation of p2x7 deregulates lc3 - ii and p62 protein content .
moreover , in vivo treatment with the specific p2x7 antagonist a - 804598 reduces p62 levels in lumbar spinal cord of sod1 - g93a mice at end stage of disease .
these data identify the modulation of autophagy as a novel mechanism by which p2x7 activates als - microglia .

mice all animal procedures have been performed according to the european guidelines for the use of animals in research ( 86 / 609 / cee ) and the requirements of italian laws ( d.l. 26 / 2014 ) .
the ethical procedure has been approved by the animal welfare office , department of public health and veterinary , nutrition and food safety , general management of animal care and veterinary drugs of the italian ministry of health ( protocol number 319 / 2015pr ) .
all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and use the minimum number of animals necessary to obtain reliable results .
adult b6.cg - tg ( sod1 - g93a ) 1gur / j mice were obtained from jackson laboratories ( bar harbor , me , usa ) , bred in our indoor animal facility and genotyped as described ( apolloni et al. , 2013a ) .
to determine behavioral scores we employed a scale from 5 to 1 , where 5 defines healthy mice without symptoms of paralysis , 4 indicates mice with slight signs of destabilized gait and paralysis of the hind limbs , 3 describes mice with clear paralysis and destabilized gait , 2 depicts mice with fully developed paralysis of the hind limbs that only crawl on the forelimbs , finally 1 defines mice with fully developed paralysis of the hind limbs that predominantly lie on the side and / or are not able to straighten up within 30 s when they are turned on their back .
after reaching a score of 1 ( end stage , ~ 23 weeks of age ) , the animals were euthanized , according to the guidelines for preclinical testing and colony management ( ludolph et al. , 2010 ) .
sod1 - g93a mice were considered at onset when exhibited a statistically significant 10 % decline of rotarod performance , with respect to wild - type ( wt ) mice .
rotarod performance was evaluated by a rotarod apparatus ( ugo basile 7650 model ) at a constant speed of 15 r.p.m. over a maximum period of 180 s ( apolloni et al. , 2013a ) .
sod1 - g93a mice at 100 days of age ( pre - onset ) were randomly grouped into vehicle - treated or cns penetrant p2x7 specific antagonist a - 804598 - treated mice ( donnelly - roberts et al. , 2009 ; catanzaro et al. , 2014 ; iwata et al. , 2016 ) given by intraperitoneal injection at 30 mg / kg five times a week until end stage of disease .
because there is sex diversity in response to pharmacological treatments ( pizzasegola et al. , 2009 ) and the p2x7 antagonist brilliant blue g has prolonged survival only in female sod1 - g93a mice ( bartlett et al. , 2017 ; sluyter et al. , 2017 ) , we have chosen to study female mice .
primary microglia cultures primary microglia cultures from brain cortex were prepared as previously described ( apolloni et al. , 2013b ) .
briefly , neonatal sod1 - g93a mice and their non - transgenic littermates mice were sacrificed and , after removing the meninges , cortices were minced and digested with 0.25 % trypsin and 0.01 % dnasei .
after dissociation and passage through 70 mum filters , cells were resuspended in dmem / f - 12 media with glutamax ( tm ) ( gibco , invitrogen , uk ) , plus 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , 100 units / ml gentamicine and 100 mug / ml streptomycin / penicillin .
after approximately 15 days , a mild trypsinization was done for 30 min at 37degreesc .
the resultant adherent microglial cells ( pure > 99 %) were washed twice with dmem / f - 12 and kept at 37degreesc in a 5 % co2 and 95 % air atmosphere and used for experiments at least 48 h after .

after saturation with blocking agent , blots were incubated overnight at 4degreesc with the specified antibody , then for 1 h with hrp - conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using ecl advance western blot detection kit ( amersham biosciences , usa ) .
signal intensity quantification was performed by kodak image station analysis software .
immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy primary microglia were fixed for 20 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized in pbs containing 0.1 % triton x - 100 and then incubated for 1.5 h at 37degreesc with anti - lc3b ( 1:200 ) , anti - sqstm1 / p62 ( 1:100 ) or anti - cd11b ( 1:200 , abd serotec , usa ) in 1 % bsa in pbs .
cells were stained for 1 h with cy2 - conjugated donkey anti - rabbit igg or cy3 - conjugated donkey anti - mouse igg or cy5 - conjugated donkey anti - rat igg ( 1:200 , jackson immunoresearch ) .
hoechst 33342 was used for nuclei staining ( 1:1000 ) in pbs .
immunofluorescence was analyzed by means of a confocal laser scanning microscope ( zeiss , lsm700 , germany ) equipped with four laser lines : 405 nm , 488 nm , 561 nm and 639 nm. the brightness and contrast of the digital images were adjusted using the zen software .
data analysis data are presented as mean +/ - standard error of the mean ( sem ) .
statistical differences were verified by student 's t - test if the normality test was passed , or by the mann - whitney rank sum test , if the normality test failed , considering acceptable a value for asymmetry between - 2 and + 2 in order to prove normal univariate distribution .
one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by post hoc tukey 's test was used for multiple comparisons .
for onset and survival data , differences in the values of a804598 - and vehicle - treated mice were assessed using kaplan - meier analysis paired with log - rank tests .
the software package graphpad prism 7.03 ( graphpad software , san diego , ca , usa ) was used for all statistical analysis with differences considered significant for p < 0.05 .
results p2x7 activation induces lc3b - ii formation in sod1 - g93a primary microglia lc3 - ii localizing to the autophagosome membrane is widely used to monitor autophagy .
in particular , the generation of lc3 - ii from lc3 - i is generally identified by immunoblot analysis , because the amount of lc3 - ii is strictly correlated with the number of autophagosomes and is considered a more reliable marker than lc3 - i to be detected ( mizushima and yoshimori , 2007 ; barth et al. , 2010 ; klionsky et al. , 2016 ) .
to directly investigate the modulation of the autophagic pathway by p2x7 activation in sod1 - g93a microglia , we thus compared the expression of lc3b - ii , with respect to gapdh .
as shown by immunoblotting in figure 1a , sod1 - g93a microglia constitutively express augmented levels of lc3b - ii with respect to wt microglia .
activation of p2x7 by the specific agonist bzatp ( 10 - 100 - 300 mum ) increases lc3b - ii protein content in a dose - dependent manner in sod1 - g93a microglia with maximal effect obtained at 300 mum ( figure 1b ) .
the time - course experiment shows that the levels of lc3b - ii are maximally induced after 15 min , with a consequent decline observed at 1 - 6 h ( figure 1b ) .
notably , the physiologic purinergic agonist atp used at the mm concentrations required to activate p2x7 exerts similar effects ( figure 1c ) .
lc3b - ii induction by bzatp and atp is decreased by the specific p2x7 antagonist a - 804598 ( 10 mum ; figure 1d ) , thus indicating p2x7 involvement .
autophagy in sod1 - g93a microglia is moreover qualitatively assessed by immunofluorescence confocal analysis , by observing cells with accumulation of lc3 dots , because cells presenting a diffuse distribution of lc3 are generally described as non - autophagic , whereas cells with increased lc3 vacuoles are classified as autophagic ( tasdemir et al. , 2008 ; klionsky et al. , 2016 ) .
confirming the western blot data , we observed that 300 mum bzatp increases cytoplasmic lc3 - positive dots in microglia with respect to control , and the effect is reduced by the p2x7 antagonist a - 804598 ( figure 1e ) .
to demonstrate the autophagic mechanism involved in lc3 - ii induction , next we show that lc3b - ii up - regulation by bzatp and atp is attenuated by wortmannin ( wm ; 100 nm ) , an inhibitor of the initial stage of conventional autophagy / phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase ( klionsky et al. , 2016 ; figure 2a ) .
a correct way to define if a treatment augments a true autophagic flux is to determine the levels of lc3b - ii in the presence of the lysosomal proteases inhibitor bafilomycin - a1 ( klionsky et al. , 2016 ) .
while the increase in lc3 - ii by a treatment simply indicates the accumulation of autophagosomes without proving autophagic degradation , an enhancement of autophagy indeed occurs if lc3 - ii further accumulates in the presence of bafilomycina1 ( mizushima and yoshimori , 2007 ) .
here we show that the addition of bafilomycin - a1 ( 25 nm ) indeed further increases the up - regulation of lc3b - ii induced by 300 mum bzatp with respect to control cells , consistently with an accelerated true autophagic flux ( figure 2b ) .

we have previously demonstrated that bzatp modulates erk1 / 2 phosphorylation in sod1 - g93a primary microglia ( apolloni et al. , 2013b ) .
because the mapk activation pathway is a positive regulator of autophagy induction ( young et al. , 2015 ) and previous data have reported that p - erk1 / 2 is specifically involved in induction of lc3b - ii expression by activated p2x7 in non - transgenic microglia ( takenouchi et al. , 2009b ) , we have stimulated sod1 - g93a microglia with 300 mum bzatp or 3 mm atp in the presence of the mek pathway inhibitor pd98059 ( 100 mum ) that per se does not affect basal lc3b - ii content ( data not shown ) .
although a partial and not statistically significant inhibition is observed on lc3b - ii up - regulation by atp , lc3b - ii induction mediated by p2x7 receptor is not apparently dependent on erk1 / 2 phosphorylation , not being significantly inhibited by pd98059 ( figure 2c ) .
p2x7 inhibits mtor phosphorylation and modulates m2 markers in sod1 - g93a microglia inhibition of mtor pathway is generally required for the induction of conventional autophagy ( klionsky et al. , 2016 ) .
thus , we have analyzed the effects of p2x7 activation on mtor phosphorylation , showing by western blot analysis that 300 mum bzatp , or 3 mm atp , is able to transiently decrease the protein content of p - mtor / mtor in sod1 - g93a microglia , with maximal inhibition observed after 15 min , as compared to control cells ( figures 3a,b ) .
these effects are partially prevented by the p2x7 antagonist a - 804598 .
figure 3 mtor phosphorylation is regulated by p2x7 activation in sod1 - g93a microglia .
sod1 - g93a microglia were treated with 300 mum bzatp ( a ) or 3 mm atp ( b ) for 15 min or 1 h with or without 10 mum a - 804598 and subjected to western blotting and immunoreactions with anti - p - mtor and anti - mtor or anti - gapdh .

data represent mean +/ - sem of n = 3 independent experiments .
statistical significance was calculated by student 's t - test or mann - whitney rank sum test or anova followed by post hoc tukey 's test , and referred to ctrl (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 ) ; to bzatp15 ' - or atp15 ' - treated cells (# p < 0.05 , ## p < 0.01 ) .
microglia activation is known to occur by the alternating acquisition of different phenotypes concisely defined as m2 with anti - inflammatory properties , and m1 with pro - inflammatory features ( franco and fernandez - suarez , 2015 ) .
since the autophagic flux impacts on the m2 / m1 microglia phenotypes ( su et al. , 2016 ; xia et al. , 2016 ) , we investigated the effects of bzatp stimulation on the levels of the m2 markers cd163 and arg - 1 , in the absence or presence of wm. as shown in figure 3c , 300 mum bzatp in 15 min increases the content of arg - 1 and cd163 proteins that returns approximately to basal levels in 6 h and is partially reverted by wm. activation of p2x7 affects sqstm1 / p62 protein content in sod1 - g93a microglia and in lumbar spinal cord of sod1 - g93a mice a well - known substrate of autophagy is sqstm1 / p62 protein that can be degraded within the autolysosomes as an additional evidence of autophagic activity ( mizushima et al. , 2010 ) .
to ascertain whether the increased lc3b - ii levels induced by p2x7 activation in sod1 - g93a microglia represent a true increase in the autophagic flux , we have examined the content of sqstm1 / p62 protein .
we have observed that while sod1 - g93a microglia contain levels of p62 comparable to wt microglia ( figure 4a ) , 300 mum bzatp ( figure 4b ) , or 3 mm atp ( figure 4c ) , transiently decreases sqstm1 / p62 protein content in sod1 - g93a microglia with about 50 % maximal inhibition obtained in 15 min ( figures 4b,c ) .
a pre - incubation with the p2x7 antagonist a - 804598 ( figure 4d ) or with wm ( figure 4e ) , partially abolishes bzatp - and atp - mediated sqstm1 / p62 decrease in sod1 - g93a microglia .
as wm is also a class iii phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase inhibitor , this result moreover indicates that p2x7 - mediated increase in autophagic flux occurs via the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase - mediated pathway .
the reduction of sqstm1 / p62 by a short treatment with bzatp or atp in sod1 - g93a microglia is confirmed also by double immunofluorescence with microglia specific marker anti - cd11b , as the intensity of the sqstm1 / p62 immunostaining is reduced after a short - term stimulation of p2x7 with respect to unstimulated cells , and the effect is reversed by the simultaneous presence of a - 804598 ( figure 4g ) .
interestingly , a sustained activation of p2x7 by bzatp for 6 h markedly increases the levels of sqstm1 / p62 protein with respect to unstimulated cells , and this effect is abolished by the presence of a - 804598 ( figure 4f ) , thus indicating that a prolonged p2x7 activation might cause an engulfment of the autophagic flux .
figure 4 activation of p2x7 affects sqstm1 / p62 levels in sod1 - g93a microglia .
( a ) equal amounts of protein from sod1 - g93a and wt microglia were subjected to western blotting and immunoreactions with anti - sqstm1 / p62 and anti - gapdh .

( f ) sod1 - g93a microglia exposed to 300 mum bzatp for 6 h with or without 10 mum a - 804598 were subjected to western blotting and immunoreactions with anti - sqstm1 / p62 and anti - gapdh .
( g ) sod1 - g93a microglia treated for 15 min with 300 mum bzatp or 3 mm atp in the absence or presence of 10 mum a - 804598 were analyzed by means of fluorescence microscopy after staining with anti - sqstm1 / p62 ( red ) and cd11b ( blue ) ( scale bar 50 mum ) .
data represent mean +/ - sem of n = 3 independent experiments .
statistical significance was calculated by student 's t - test or anova followed by post hoc tukey 's test referred to ctrl (* p < 0.05 , ** p < 0.01 , *** p < 0.001 ) ; to bzatp15 ' - treated cells or atp15 ' - treated cells ( d,e ; # p < 0.05 , ## p < 0.01 ) , or bzatp6h - treated cells ( f ; ## p < 0.01 ) .
it is known that the sqstm1 / p62 autophagy substrate accumulates , together with lc3b - ii , in lumbar spinal cord of als mice during disease progression , when the autophagic flux is impaired ( zhang et al. , 2011 ) .
we have therefore measured the level of lc3b - ii and sqstm1 / p62 proteins in lumbar spinal cord of sod1 - g93a mice after having pharmacologically inhibited in vivo the p2x7 receptor by a chronic treatment in female sod1 - g93a mice with the blood - brain permeant a - 804598 , demonstrated to reach brain concentrations in rodents after oral or i.p. doses ( able et al. , 2011 ; iwata et al. , 2016 ) , administered at 30 mg / kg from pre - onset to end stage of disease .
we find that while the protein levels of lc3b - ii ( figure 5a ) and sqstm1 / p62 ( figure 5b ) are confirmed to be both increased at end stage in vehicle - treated sod1 - g93a mice with respect to wt , in a - 804598 - treated als mice with respect to vehicle , the lc3b - ii protein content appears unmodified , while sqstm1 / p62 is inhibited to basal levels ( figures 5a,b ) .
as shown , neither behavioral scores ( figure 5c ) , disease onset ( figure 5d ) , nor survival ( figure 5e ) are however affected by a - 804598 when administered in female sod1 - g93a mice .
figure 5 in vivo chronic treatment with p2x7 antagonist a - 804598 decreases sqstm1 / p62 expression in lumbar spinal cord of sod1 - g93a mice .

discussion recent work has provided strong indications not only that autophagy plays a key role in als , but also that p2x7 receptor contributes to the neuroinflammatory pathway of als on one hand , and to the autophagic flux of microglia , on the other .
the aim of this work was thus to investigate if p2x7 activation participates to als pathogenesis by directly modulating autophagic mechanisms in microglia , in other words to establish the occurrence of a p2x7 - neuroinflammation - autophagy axis in als - microglia .
we demonstrate that the modulation of the autophagic flux appears as a novel mechanism by which p2x7 contributes to activate sod1 - g93a microglia and to interfere with als features ( figure 6 ) .
in detail , we have illustrated here that a short time window of p2x7 stimulation by purinergic agonists augments lc3 - ii via the mtor pathway and decreases sqstm1 / p62 levels , concurrently with an up - regulation of the m2 markers cd163 and arg - 1 in sod1 - g93a primary microglia .
on the contrary , a sustained activation of p2x7 leads to an impairment of the autophagic flux with increased sqstm1 / p62 protein content .
this might occur concomitantly with the previously characterized polarization of sod1 - g93a microglia toward the m1 phenotype exemplified by gp91phox , cox - 2 , tnf - alpha and nf - kappab activation , and toxicity towards mn ( d'ambrosi et al. , 2009 ; apolloni et al. , 2016b ; parisi et al. , 2016 ) .
although as yet unaware of the molecular mechanisms linking the decrease in autophagy to the insurgence of pro - inflammatory actions sustained by p2x7 , our results are in line with the involvement of autophagy in the inflammatory response ( levine et al. , 2011 ; apolloni et al. , 2016a ) .
indeed , when autophagy is stimulated by lps in microglia , the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase is suppressed ( han et al. , 2013 ) .
conversely , when the autophagic flux is inhibited , the m1 phenotype is induced with higher expression of tnf - alpha , inducible nitric oxide synthase and cox - 2 mediated by the nf - kappab pathway , and m2 genes are instead inhibited with down - regulation of arg - 1 , bdnf and il - 10 ( xia et al. , 2016 ) .
in both als patients and transgenic mice , it is well known that microglia switches from a beneficial m2 phenotype occurring during the early phases of disease , to a detrimental m1 phenotype that is more preponderant when the disease accelerates and motor neuron injury escalates ( henkel et al. , 2009 ; beers et al. , 2011 ; zhao et al. , 2013 ; hooten et al. , 2015 ) .
these and our findings would thus suggest a parallelism between m2 inflammatory state and activation of autophagy , as well as m1 inflammatory condition and inhibition of autophagy , both consistently with the dual role played by p2x7 in als pathogenesis .
figure 6 schematic representation of p2x7 actions in sod1 - g93a microglia .
treatment of sod1 - g93a primary microglia with p2x7 agonists bzatp or atp modulates inflammatory and autophagic markers .
after a short stimulation ( left panel ) , p2x7 induces an increase in m2 markers ( arg - 1 and cd163 ) concomitantly with the stimulation of the autophagic process by augmenting lc3 - ii and decreasing p62 and p - mtor levels .
conversely , a sustained activation with p2x7 agonists ( right panel ) , causes inhibition of the autophagic flux with up - regulation of p62 that is parallel to previous results showing an increase of pro - inflammatory m1 markers gp91phox ( apolloni et al. , 2016b ) , cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ; d'ambrosi et al. , 2009 ) , and moreover nuclear factor kappa - b ( nf - kappab ; parisi et al. , 2016 ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf - alpha ) and motor neurons ( mn ) death ( d'ambrosi et al. , 2009 ) .
moreover , we suggest that the short p2x7 - dependent activation of autophagy demonstrated in vitro in sod1 - g93a microglia could be related to the beneficial role of p2x7 activation occurring during the early phase of the disease , when genetic ablation of p2x7 elicits detrimental consequences on als phenotype ( apolloni et al. , 2013a ) .
the persistent stimulation of p2x7 causing autophagic flux inhibition in sod1 - g93a microglia in vitro is instead perhaps resembling what occurs during the symptomatic phase of the disease , when the pharmacological inhibition of p2x7 exerts beneficial effects on als progression ( apolloni et al. , 2014 ; sluyter et al. , 2017 ) .
the initial stimulation of autophagic flux found in sod1 - g93a microglia by p2x7 activation with inhibition of mtor phosphorylation differs from what reported in non - transgenic microglia where p2x7 signaling has been reported to negatively regulate autophagic flux and stimulate the phosphorylation of mtor ( takenouchi et al. , 2009b ) .
the induction of microglial autophagy is instead in line with data obtained in dystrophic muscle cells , where p2x7 indeed increases autophagy ( young et al. , 2015 ) , thus indicating a phenotype - specific purinergic - mediated autophagy in als .
in addition , we have demonstrated that lc3 - ii induction in sod1 - g93a microglia is apparently independent from erk1 / 2 activation , again in line with what reported in muscle cells , where map kinases play only a marginal role in atp - induced autophagy ( young et al. , 2015 ) .
this is again different from what reported in non - transgenic microglia ( takenouchi et al. , 2009b ) , where inhibition of autophagy is instead dependent on the mapk pathway. by emphasizing the divergence between non - transgenic and sod1 - g93a microglia , these results however reinforce the synergism between autophagy and inflammation in p2x7 - activated microglia .
finally , in this article we have shown that inhibition of p2x7 through the antagonist a - 804598 in sod1 - g93a mice suppresses sqstm1 / p62 up - regulation in lumbar spinal cord , thus confirming p2x7 as an in vivo modulator of the als pathological mechanism of autophagy , although further experiments might contribute to identify the cell phenotypes that are more responsible for altered autophagy .
survival , behavioral scores and disease onset are however not affected by a - 804598 when administered in female sod1 - g93a mice at the time and dose adopted in our work .
this suggests that inhibition of sqstm1 / p62 overexpression is perhaps necessary , but not sufficient , to ameliorate als disease .
given the various controversial male vs. female differences encountered on the effects of p2x7 antagonists or genetic ablation ( sluyter et al. , 2017 ) , we cannot exclude that further dose - and sex - dependent preclinical studies might provide different results .
ectonucleotidase activities are responsible for the degradation of extracellular atp , and sod1 - g93a microglia have a reduced extracellular atp hydrolyzing activity with respect to non - transgenic microglia ( d'ambrosi et al. , 2009 ; butovsky et al. , 2012 ; volonte et al. , 2016 ) .
this would imply that higher extracellular atp concentrations might be present in vivo in the proximity of sod1 - g93a damaged mn to activate p2x7 on neighboring cells .
while an initial activation of p2x7 might ensure a positive impact on microglia by stimulating autophagy , a persistent engagement of the receptor might in turn inhibit autophagy .
these results thus extend to autophagy the dual role previously suggested for p2x7 in the sod1 - g93a model ( volonte et al. , 2016 ) .
in order to further validate the in vitro and in vivo results about p2x7 - dependent modulation of autophagy , because previous studies suggested that sod1 - g93a microglia has a regional heterogeneity during disease progression ( nikodemova et al. , 2014 ) , future experiments will investigate the actions of p2x7 also in primary microglia from sod1 - g93a spinal cord .
moreover , because wt - sod1 overexpression in mice per se causes mitochondrial vacuolization , axonal degeneration and premature motor neuron loss in mice ( jaarsma et al. , 2000 ) , we will also study how this condition might for itself influence the effects of p2x7 in microglia .
in conclusion , our results extend the role of p2x7 as a means for interfering with autophagy in sod1 - g93a microglia , and a new mechanism of intervention against autophagic dysfunction in als pathogenesis .

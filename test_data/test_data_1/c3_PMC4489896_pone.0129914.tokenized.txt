o - mannosylation , the addition of mannose to serine and threonine residues of secretory proteins , is a highly conserved post - translational modification found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans .
here , we report the functional and molecular characterization of the hppmt4 gene encoding a protein o - mannosyltransferase in the thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast hansenula polymorpha , an emerging host for the production of therapeutic recombinant proteins .
compared to the deletion of hppmt1 , deletion of another major pmt gene , hppmt4 , resulted in more increased sensitivity to the antibiotic hygromycin b , caffeine , and osmotic stresses , but did not affect the thermotolerance of h. polymorpha .
notably , the deletion of hppmt4 generated severe defects in glycosylation of the surface sensor proteins hpwsc1p and hpmid2p , with marginal effects on secreted glycoproteins such as chitinase and hpyps1p lacking a gpi anchor .
however , despite the severely impaired mannosylation of surface sensor proteins in the hppmt4increment mutant , the phosphorylation of hpmpk1p and hphog1p still showed a high increase upon treatment with cell wall disturbing agents or high concentrations of salts .
the conditional hppmt1pmt4increment double mutant strains displayed severely impaired growth , enlarged cell size , and aberrant cell separation , implying that the loss of hppmt4 function might be lethal to cells in the absence of hppmt1p .
moreover , the hppmt4 protein was found to form not only a homomeric complex but also a heteromeric complex with either hppmt1p or hppmt2p .
altogether , our results support the function of hppmt4p as a key player in o - mannosylation of cell surface proteins and its participation in the formation of heterodimers with other pmt members , besides homodimer formation , in h. polymorpha .

introduction protein o - mannosylation is an essential protein modification that is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria and yeast to humans and is initiated by protein o - mannosyltransferases ( pmts ) [ 1 ] .
in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , pmt proteins catalyze the transfer of mannose residue to ser / thr residues of target proteins [ 2 ] .
seven pmt isoforms ( scpmt1 - 7p ) , which are er membrane proteins comprising multiple transmembrane domains , have been identified in the baker 's yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 2,3 ] .
the s. cerevisiae pmt isoforms are grouped into three major subfamilies referred to as pmt1 ( scpmt1 / 5 / 7p ) , pmt2 ( scpmt2 / 3 / 6p ) , and pmt4 ( scpmt4p ) [ 4,5 ] .
orthologs of s. cerevisiae pmt proteins have been reported in many other yeast and filamentous fungal species , including aspergillus fumigatus [ 6 ] , aspergillus nidulans [ 7 ] , botrytis cinerea [ 8 ] , candida albicans [ 9 ] , cryptococcus neoformans [ 10 ] , pichia pastoris [ 11 ] , schizosaccharomyces pombe [ 12,13 ] , trichoderma reesei [ 14 ] , and ustilago maydis [ 15 ] .
moreover , pmt homologs are present in higher multicellular eukaryotes such as drosophila melanogaster , zebrafish , mice , and humans .
in d. melanogaster , only two pmt family members , rotated abdomen and twisted , are present [ 16,17 ] .
the same is true in the case of zebrafish , mice , and humans , which possess pomt1 ( a member of the pmt4 subfamily ) and pomt2 ( a member of the pmt2 subfamily ) [ 17 - 19 ] .
although pmt family members show a high degree of conservation , several significant distinctive features are present between pmt1 / pmt2 and pmt4 subfamily members .
first , the pmt1 / pmt2 subfamilies are highly redundant , whereas the pmt4 subfamily has only one representative per species [ 20 ] .
second , despite the fact that all pmt family members share three conserved sequence motifs , a , b , and c , these conserved motifs show significant variation between pmt1 / pmt2 and pmt4 subfamily members [ 20 ] .
third , pmt1 and pmt2 subfamily members function together as heterodimers for maximum activity , whereas the unique representative of the pmt4 subfamily forms a homodimer in fungi [ 3 ] .
however , a very recent study demonstrated that a. nidulans pmta ( subfamily pmt2 ) and pmtb ( subfamily pmt1 ) can also form heterodimers with pmtc ( subfamily pmt4 ) [ 21 ] , which is similar to the pomt1 - pomt2 complex formation in humans [ 22 ] .
furthermore , pmt1 / pmt2 and pmt4 subfamily members modify different acceptor protein substrates in vivo .
for example , kre9p , bar1p , pir2p / hsp150p , and aga2p are exclusively o - mannosylated by pmt1p - pmt2p complexes in s. cerevisiae [ 23 ] .
in contrast , kex2p , gas1p [ 23 ] , axl2p [ 24 ] , fus1p [ 25 ] , and beta - amyloid precursor protein ( app ) [ 26 ] are o - mannosylated by pmt4p .
the wsc family members as well as mid2p [ 27 ] , mtl1p [ 28 ] , and ccw5p / pir4p [ 29 ] are mannosylated by both complexes , but in distinct regions .
it was reported that the preferred substrates of pmt4p are membrane - associated proteins bearing ser / thr - rich domains in s. cerevisiae [ 30 ] .
hansenula polymorpha is a thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast that can grow rapidly using methanol as its sole source of carbon and energy , and at high temperatures up to 48degreesc [ 31 ] .
this yeast has been developed as a favorable host for the production of recombinant pharmaceuticals [ 32 ] , since it has several important advantages as a versatile cell factory .
it contains several strong and inducible promoters derived from genes of the methanol metabolic pathway , specifically methanol oxidase ( mox ) , dihydroxyacetone synthase ( dhas ) and formate dehydrogenase ( fmdh ) [ 33,34 ] .
furthermore , h. polymorpha does not hyperglycosylate secreted proteins , which often causes a problem in heterologous protein production in s. cerevisiae [ 35,36 ] .
systematic studies on the h. polymorpha genes involved in n - linked glycosylation facilitated the development of glycoengineered h. polymorpha strains for the production of human - type n - glycans [ 37 - 40 ] .
our recent study reported that h. polymorpha has five pmt genes ( hppmt1 , hppmt2 , hppmt4 , hppmt5 , and hppmt6 ) encoding protein o - mannosyltransferases [ 41 ] .
lack of hppmt1p results in increased temperature sensitivity and decreased o - glycosylation of the chitinase protein [ 41,42 ] .
the hppmt1pmt5increment and hppmt1pmt6increment double mutants showed increased sensitivity to cell wall stressors and aberrant o - mannosylation of the surface glycoproteins hpwsc1p and hpmid2p [ 41 ] .
here , we report the functional and molecular characterization of the h. polymorpha pmt4 gene , which is the only member of the pmt4 subfamily .
we present a line of evidence supporting our conclusion that hppmt4p plays a critical role essentially in the o - mannosylation of surface membrane proteins .
moreover , we show that pmt4p forms not only a homodimeric complex but also forms heterodimeric complexes either with pmt1p or pmt2p in h. polymorpha .
materials and methods yeast strains , plasmids , primers , and culture conditions the h. polymorpha strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table 1 and s1 table , respectively .
the primers used for the construction of plasmids and strains are listed in s2 table .
yeast cells were grown at 37degreesc in ypd medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % bacto peptone , and 2 % glucose ) .
the transformation of h. polymorpha was performed according to the modified lithium acetate - dimethyl sulfoxide method [ 43 ] .
a selective synthetic complete ( sc ) medium ( 0.67 % yeast nitrogen base without amino acids , 2 % glucose , 0.77 g / l drop - out amino acid supplement without uracil or leucine ) or ypd containing 80 mug / ml zeocin ( invitrogen ) or 100 mug / ml hygromycin b ( sigma ) was used for the selection of various yeast transformants .

first , the mox orf was replaced with the n302q mutant of the orf encoding human urokinase - type plasminogen activator [ 45 ] ; then , in the 1bq strain obtained , the ura3 gene was disrupted with the ade2 selectable marker .
the hppmt1 gene in the 1bq - u strain was disrupted using the pss18 - derived hppmt1 disruption cassette , which was constructed in a previous study [ 42 ] , generating the hppmt1increment mutant strain ( 1bu - u - pmt1 ) .
the hppmt4 disruption cassette was constructed by introducing inverse recombination arms into a hpleu2 - equipped integrative vector according to a previously reported approach [ 46 ] .
briefly , h. polymorpha cbs4732 genomic dna was digested with hindiii , self - ligated , and used as a template for pcr with the primers hppmt4d _ f and hppmt4d _ r .
the pcr product containing inverse recombination arms was digested with ecori and xhoi for cloning between the ecori and sali sites of the pchlx plasmid [ 47 ] .
the resulting plasmid pcss27 was digested with hindiii to obtain the hppmt4 disruption cassette .
the plasmid pdum3p600 - hppmt4d , used to construct the h. polymorpha pmt1pmt4increment double mutant strain bearing an hppmt4 allele under the control of the hpmet3 promoter ( 1bq - u - pmt1 / pmet3 - pmt4 ) , was obtained as follows : the 600 - bp hpmet3 promoter and the 750 - bp partial 5 ' orf region of hppmt4 were pcr amplified from the h. polymorpha cbs4732 wild - type genomic dna using the sali - hpmet3 _ f / hpmet3 _ r - ecori and ecori - hppmt4d _ f / hppmt4d - clai _ r primer pairs , respectively .
the sali / ecori - digested hpmet3 promoter was subcloned into sali / ecori sites of pdumox - msds ( ha - hdel ) [ 37 ] , generating pdum3p600 - msds .
subsequently the ecori / clai - digested hppmt4 fragment was cloned into ecori / clai - digested pdum3p600 - msds , resulting in pdum3p600 - hppmt4d , which possessed the incomplete hppmt1 orf under control of the hpmet3 promoter .

the pcr product was digested with nhei / asci and ligated into the nhei / asci - digested phigaht - 4flag [ 41 ] , resulting in the plasmid phinht - hppmt4f .
the 2.9 kb nhei / clai fragment containing the hppmt4 promoter and orf tagged with four units of flag was obtained from phinht - hppmt4f and ligated with the clai / sali - digested pdumox - msds ( ha - hdel ) [ 37 ] , generating an h. polymorpha expression vector for a flag - tagged hppmt4p , pdun - hppmt4f .

the hpura3 gene fragment was excised from pthpura3 - lz [ 48 ] by bamhi and inserted into the bglii - digested phinz - hppmt4h , generating phinzu - hppmt4h .
the drai - digested phinzu - hppmt4h or phinz - hppmt4h was integrated by homologous recombination into the hppmt4 promoter locus of the hppmt4increment or hppmt4increment / pmt4f strains , respectively , generating an h. polymorpha strain expressing ha - tagged hppmt4p ( hppmt4increment / pmt4h ) and another co - expressing ha - tagged hppmt4p and flag - tagged hppmt4p ( hppmt4increment / pmt4f / pmt4h ) , respectively .

for the construction of an h. polymorpha wild - type strain expressing a flag - tagged hppmt2p strain ( 1bq - la / pmt2f ) , the plasmid phiht - hppmt2f [ 41 ] was cut at the avai site within the hppmt2 orf and integrated by homologous recombination into the genomic hppmt2 locus of the 1bq - la strain .
for construction of a h. polymorpha 1bu - u - pmt4 ( hppmt4increment ) mutant strain expressing a flag - tagged hppmt2p ( hppmt4increment / pmt2f ) , phigaz - hppmt2f [ 41 ] was cut at the ecori site within the hppmt2 orf for linearization and integrated by homologous recombination into the genomic hppmt2 locus of the hppmt4increment strain .
to generate strains co - expressing either ha - tagged hppmt1p and flag - tagged hppmt4p ( hppmt1increment / pmt1h / pmt4f ) or flag - tagged hppmt2p and ha - tagged hppmt4p ( hppmt4increment / pmt2f / pmt4h ) in the cbs4732 strain background , the circular plasmid pdun - hppmt4f or the ecori - digested phinz - hppmt4h were integrated in the hppmt1increment / pmt1h or the hppmt4increment / pmt2f strain , respectively .

the pcr product was digested with bglii / asci and ligated with bglii / asci - digested phigaz - 6ha , generating phinz - hpwsc1h .
to construct plasmid phinz - hpmid2f , an expression vector of flag epitope - tagged hpmid2p ( hpmid2pflag ) , the pcr fragment containing the 500 - bp promoter and the full - length orf without the stop codon of the hpmid2 gene was obtained using the primer pair bglii - hpmid2 _ pm / hpmid2 _ r - asci .
the pcr product was cloned as a bglii / asci - digested fragment into phigaz - 4flag digested with bglii and asci enzymes , generating phinz - hpmid2f .

supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 5 min at 4degreesc and analyzed with 10 % sds - page .
for detection of phosphorylated mpk1 and phospho - hog1 proteins , the anti - phospho - p44 / p42 mapk and anti - phospho - p38 mapk antibodies ( cell signaling technology ) were used , respectively , and anti - schog1 antibody ( santa cruz biotechnology ) was used to detect hog1 protein .

[ 41 ] .
hppmt4pha protein was immunoprecipitated from sodium deoxycholate ( sdc ) extract containing 300 mug of proteins by using the profound ha tag ip / co - ip kit ( thermo scientific ) .

results construction and growth phenotype analysis of an hppmt4 null mutant strain to obtain information on the function of pmt4 in h. polymorpha , we constructed an hppmt4 null mutant strain in the cbs4732 derivative and analyzed its growth phenotypes .
the sensitivity of the hppmt4delta mutant strain to various cell stresses , as well as antibiotic and antifungal drugs , was analyzed and compared to that of the hppmt1increment mutant strain containing a deletion of hppmt1 ( fig 1a ) .
the growth of the hppmt1increment and hppmt4delta mutant strains was significantly inferior to that of the wild - type strain in the presence of cell wall destabilizers such as cas , cr , or sds .
however , the h. polymorpha pmt mutants showed marginal sensitivity to antifungals , such as amphotericin b ( amb ) and cfw , and to an er stress inducer tm , an inhibitor of asn - linked glycosylation causing er stress [ 50 ] .
the retarded growth of both pmt mutants was more apparent in the presence of another er stress inducer dtt , an inhibitor of disulfide bond formation [ 51 ] , than in the presence of tm. notably , the hppmt4delta mutant strain was more susceptible to cell wall stressors , such as caffeine and the antibiotic hygromycin b ( hgb ) , and to the pmt1p inhibitor r3a - 1c , than the hppmt1delta strain .
at elevated temperatures , the growth of the hppmt4delta mutant was marginally decreased , whereas the hppmt1delta strain displayed a profound temperature - sensitive growth defect .
such increased sensitivities of the hppmt4delta mutant strain to cell wall stressors and at high temperatures were also consistently observed in another independent hppmt4delta clone ( s1a fig ) .
altogether , these phenotypes suggest an important role for hppmt4 in maintaining cell wall integrity .
it is noteworthy that the hppmt mutant strains displayed increased susceptibility to various salt stresses ( fig 1b ) .
when incubated at high salt concentrations , such as 1 m kcl or 0.5 m nacl , the hppmt1increment and hppmt4increment mutant strains grew significantly slower than the wild - type strain .
interestingly , the hppmt4increment mutant appeared to be more susceptible to high concentrations of salts than the hppmt1increment strain .
it is notable that the growth of the hppmt1increment and hppmt4increment mutants of the h. polymorpha cbs4732 strain was inhibited even by sorbitol and mannitol , which are known as osmotic stabilizers .
for that reason , the increased sensitivity to cell wall disturbing reagents of the hppmt1delta and hppmt4delta mutants could not be complemented by the addition of 1 m sorbitol ( fig 1c ) .
the supplementation with other osmotic protectors , such as 1 m glycerol or 1 m sucrose , also did not recover the growth defects of hppmt1increment and hppmt4increment mutants at high temperatures and in the presence of cell wall stressors ( s1b and s1c fig ) .
taken together , these results suggest that the loss of hppmt4p results in significant alteration of cell wall integrity , generating increased sensitivity to cell wall and osmotic stresses .

plates were incubated for 2 days .
o - mannosylation analysis of glycoproteins in hppmt4increment mutants to investigate the influence of hppmt4 mutation on o - glycosylation activity in vivo , the electrophoretic mobility of the endogenous chitinase , an extracellular glycoprotein that is exclusively o - glycosylated without n - glycosylation [ 37,42 ] , was analyzed .
while the chitinase of the hppmt1increment mutant migrated slightly faster than that of the wild - type strain , no apparent change was observed in the electrophoretic mobility of chitinase of the single hppmt4increment mutant ( fig 2a ) , suggesting that pmt4p is not involved in o - mannosylation of chitinase in h. polymorpha .
we further investigated effects of pmt4 and pmt1 mutations on glycosylation patterns of secreted his - tagged yps1p ( hpyps1phis ) , which lacks a gpi anchor .
whereas hpyps1p is an aspartic protease largely localized on cell surface via gpi , hpyps1phis having a deletion of a gip signal ( deletion from omega + 4 position to c - terminus ) is efficiently secreted as a soluble form [ 49 ] .
the hyperglycosylated forms of hpyps1phis were detected by immunoblot analysis , using an anti - his antibody ( fig 2b ) .
after cleavage of the signal peptides , the molecular weight ( mw ) of secreted hpyps1phis was predicted to be approximately 55 kda , while its n - glycosylated form in the er is ~ 75 kda .
the secreted hpyps1phis displayed a single broad band of higher mw (~ 90 - 110 kda ) due to the addition of o - mannosylation in the wild - type strain .
an underglycosylated form of hpyps1phis of ~ 70 kda was apparently observed as a minor fraction in the hppmt1delta mutant , whereas the underglycosylated form of hpyps1phis was barely detected in the hppmt4delta mutant as a faint smear .
after pngase f treatment , which removes n - linked glycans from glycoproteins , the differential migration patterns of secreted hpyps1phis in the wild - type and hppmt mutant strains were still seen , indicating that the difference in electrophoretic mobility is caused by differential o - glycosylation .
thus , this suggested that the secreted form of c - terminally truncated yps1p is preferentially modified by pmt1p , although pmt4p may also be partly involved in the modification of yps1p in h. polymorpha .
we then examined whether hppmt4p is required in o - mannosyl modification of cell surface glycoproteins , such as wsc1p and mid2p .
for this analysis , either hpwsc1p with six copies of a c - terminal ha tag ( hpwsc1pha ) or hpmid2p with four copies of the c - terminal flag tag ( hpmid2pflag ) was expressed in the h. polymorpha wild - type and pmt mutant strains .
although the deduced mw of hpwsc1pha is 41.8 kda , hpwsc1pha migrated on sds - page with an apparent mw of approximately 100 kda in the wild - type strain due to intensive o - linked mannosylation ( fig 2c ) .
in the hppmt1increment mutant , we did not detect any significant difference in the migration pattern of hpwsc1pha compared to that for the wild - type cells .
in contrast , we clearly observed a remarkable reduction in the mw of hpwsc1pha in the hppmt4increment mutant .
we detected an abundant form of hpwsc1pha at 72 kda , which was not observed for the wild - type and hppmt1increment mutant strains ( fig 2c ) .
moreover , we observed a band of hpwsc1pha smaller than 35 kda , which is assumed to be the aberrant proteolytic product of unmodified hpwsc1p [ 27 ] .
a similar pattern of mw change due to a lack of o - mannosylation was obtained for hpmid2pflag in the hppmt4increment mutant strain .
in the wild - type strain , smeared bands of hpmid2pflag of approximately 120 - 200 kda , which is much larger than the predicted size of 46.8 kda , were detected by anti - flag antibody .
in the hppmt1delta mutant , the levels of the high mw forms of hpmid2pflag were slightly lower than those in the wild - type cells ( fig 2d , left panel ) .
however , in the absence of hppmt4p , the total amount of these high mw forms was dramatically decreased while small fragments of hpmid2pflag were generated ( fig 2d , right panel ) .
the re - introduction of functional hppmt4p in the hppmt4increment mutant strains expressing hpwsc1pha or hpmid2pflag were shown to completely restore the altered o - mannosylation patterns and thereby the instability of hpwsc1 and hpmid2 proteins to those observed in the wild - type strains ( s2 fig ). from these data , we conclude that hppmt4p plays a major role exclusively in o - mannosylation of membrane associated proteins , which is critical for maintaining the stability of these membrane proteins .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0129914.g002 fig 2 analysis of o - mannosylation of glycosylated proteins in the h. polymorpha wild - type and hppmt mutant strains .
( a ) chitinase was isolated from culture media of h. polymorpha wild - type 1bq - la ( wt ) , hppmt1increment , and hppmt4increment mutant strains by binding to chitin beads , and analyzed by 6 % sds - page .
( b ) c - terminally truncated hpyps1 proteins expressed in the h. polymorpha wild - type , hppmt1increment , and hppmt4increment mutant strains weredetected using anti - his antibodies with (+) and without ( - ) pngase f treatment .
( c ) cell extracts from the h. polymorpha wild - type and from several pmt mutants expressing hpwsc1pha were subjected to 8 % sds - page followed by western blot analysis with anti - ha antibody .
( d ) hpmid2pflag expressed in the wild - type , hppmt1increment , and hppmt4increment mutant strains was resolved by 6 % sds - page ( left panel ) and 12 % sds - page ( right panel ) .
blots were sequentially probed with anti - flag antibody .
the same samples were loaded in each panel .
analysis of map kinase activation in the hppmt4increment mutant in yeast , cell wall damage leads to the induction of the cell wall integrity ( cwi ) pathway , mediated by the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) mpk1p , which results in numerous cellular responses [ 52 ] .
to investigate whether the cwi pathway is activated due to cell wall damage caused by defective o - mannosylation in the hppmt4increment mutant , we analyzed the phosphorylation of hpmpk1p in the wild - type , hppmt1increment , and hppmt4increment mutant strains by western blot analysis using the anti - phospho - p44 / p42 antibody .
intriguingly , the basal level of phosphorylated hpmpk1p , a key kinase in the cell wall integrity pathway , was markedly reduced in the hppmt4increment mutant strain , while the phosphorylation of hpmpk1p was slightly induced in the hppmt1increment mutant compared to that in the wild - type strain in the absence of other external stresses ( fig 3a and 3b ) .
however , despite the decrease in the basal level of phosphorylated hpmpk1p in the hppmt4delta strain , the phosphorylation level was increased upon treatment with various cell wall disturbing agents , just as in the wild - type strain .
compared to moderate activation of hpmpk1p found in response to cfw , cr , cas and sds , the phosphorylation of hpmpk1p increased more significantly in the presence of caffeine ( fig 3a and s3 table ) .
particularly , treatment with tm led to the most dramatic activation of hpmpk1p phosphorylation among tested cell wall stressors ( fig 3b and s3 table ) .
these results suggest that the cwi signaling pathway can still be activated by cell wall damage , even when the o - mannosylation of surface sensors such as wsc1p and mid2p , normally catalyzed by the pmt4 protein , is severely reduced .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0129914.g003 fig 3 analysis of activation of the cell wall integrity pathway and hog pathway in h. polymorpha pmt mutant strains .
( a and b ) analysis of map kinase activation .
the total soluble protein samples were obtained from the wild - type 1bq - la ( wt ) , hppmt1increment ( increment1 ) , and hppmt4increment ( increment4 ) mutant strains , which were grown to early exponential phase and then treated for 2 hr with 20 mm caffeine , 0.2 mg / ml cfw , 10 mg / ml cr , 2 mug / ml cas , 0.05 % sds , or 2.5 mug / ml tm. the phosphorylated hpmpk1p was detected using the anti - phospho - p44 / 42 mapk antibody , and the protein loading was monitored using an anti - beta - actin antibody .
the relative values of hpmpk1p phosphorylation to the basal level value of the wild - type were indicated , which were obtained by measuring the signal intensity of western blots with quantity one 4.6.6 software ( bio - rad ) .
error bars represent standard deviation of duplicate measurements .
( c ) analysis of hphog1 map kinase activation .
the total soluble protein samples were obtained from the wild - type ( wt ) , hppmt1increment ( increment1 ) , and hppmt4increment ( increment4 ) mutant strains , which were grown to early exponential phase in ypd containing 0.5 m nacl for 2 hr. immunoblotting was conducted using anti - phospho - p38 antibody to detect phospho - hog1p and with anti - hog1 antibody as a loading control .
the strains used were wild - type 1bq - la ( wt ) and the hppmt1increment ( increment1 ) and hppmt4increment ( increment4 ) mutants .
a previous study in s. cerevisiae showed that the high osmolarity glycerol ( hog ) pathway was activated in response to zymolyase , which lyses cell walls of viable yeast cells [ 53 ] , suggesting cooperative cross - talk between the cwi and hog signaling pathways [ 54,55 ] .
we thus explored whether reduced o - mannosylation in h. polymorpha would also lead to stimulation of the hog pathway , which is mostly dedicated to the adaptation of yeast cells to osmotic stress .
under normal conditions , the levels of phosphorylated hphog1p were found to be slightly higher in the hppmt1increment and hppmt4increment mutant strains than in the wild - type ( fig 3c ) , implying that the defect in cell wall integrity in these pmt mutants activates the hog pathway in h. polymorpha even under normal growth conditions .
the wild - type , hppmt1increment , and hppmt4increment mutant strains all showed further activation of the hog pathway upon nacl treatment .
altogether , these results indicate that , although the loss of hppmt4p causes severe defects in o - mannosylation of cell surface sensor proteins , the mutant strain still retains its ability to activate the cwi and hog mapk signaling pathways in response to cell wall stress conditions .
analysis of a conditional hppmt1pmt4increment double mutant our previous study showed that the hppmt1pmt5increment , hppmt1pmt6increment , hppmt5pmt6increment double mutants , and even a hppmt1pmt5pmt6increment triple mutant , were viable [ 41 ] .
to investigate the effect of hppmt4 deletion in the absence of hppmt1p , we tried to construct an hppmt1pmt4increment double mutant strain .
despite several trials of transformation of a h. polymorpha pmt4 mutant strain with a pmt1 disruption cassette , we could not obtain the hppmt1pmt4increment double mutant strain .
along with the observation that hppmt4increment mutant showed an extremely severe sensitivity to the pmt1p inhibitor r3a - 1c ( fig 1a ) , this implied that the simultaneous loss of pmt1 and pmt4 functions is most likely lethal to cells in h. polymorpha .
to verify this hypothesis , the conditional pmt4 allele under control of the hpmet3 promoter was introduced in the hppmt1increment mutant strain .
this was accompanied with inactivation of the chromosomal wild - type pmt4 allele .
expression of the pmt4 conditional allele could be down - regulated by the controllable hpmet3 promoter , whose expression is repressed by the supplementation of cysteine but is induced under sulfur - limited conditions [ 56 ] .
the growth of the hppmt1delta [ pmet3 - pmt4 ] mutant strain was severely retarded on sd medium containing more than 2 mm cysteine , compared to that of the hppmt1increment single mutant ( fig 4a and 4b ) .
these results supported the theory that the concerted action of hppmt1p and hppmt4p is indispensable for growth of h. polymorpha .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0129914.g004 fig 4 morphological and growth phenotypes of the conditional hppmt1pmt4increment mutant strain .
( a ) yeast cells were grown overnight in ypd and then adjusted to an od600 of 1.0 , diluted in 10 - fold increments , and then each dilution was spotted onto sd plates supplemented with varying concentrations of cysteine .
the pictures of the plates were taken after 5 days of incubation at 37degreesc .
( b ) a series of 10 - fold dilutions of h. polymorpha strains was spotted on sd plates only or sd plates containing 10 mm caffeine , 0.3 mug / ml cas , 0.1 mg / ml cfw , 3 mg / ml cr , or 0.005 % sds without or with 2 mm cysteine .
cells were incubated for 4 days .
( c ) confocal micrographs of indicated strains ( wild - type , hppmt1increment , hppmt4increment , and hppmt1pmt4increment mutants ) grown for 1 day in sd liquid media containing 2 mm cysteine .
cells were fixed for 10 min in 3.7 % formaldehyde and subsequently stained with the chitin - staining dye cfw .
we further investigated cell morphology of the hppmt mutants through microscopic observation .
as shown in fig 4c , the hppmt1increment and hppmt4increment mutants showed an aberrant swollen or enlarged shape and formed chains of cells , whereas the wild - type cells exhibited normal growth as single yeast cells with simple buds .
moreover , the conditional hppmt1pmt4increment double mutant displayed not only a large and dysmorphic phenotype but also prominent cell aggregation with an apparently aberrant ( or random ) budding pattern , reflecting inability of the cells to separate normally .
to investigate the presence of chitin , the cells were stained with cfw .
the birth scar , in which chitin has been degraded [ 57 ] , was clearly observed in single cells of the wild - type strain .
while the hppmt1increment and hppmt4increment single mutants showed a chitin deposition pattern similar to that of the wild - type cells , the conditional hppmt1pmt4increment double mutant cells displayed unusual accumulation of chitin between connected cells ( fig 4c , arrow ) , which might result in a failure of daughter cells to dissociate properly from mother cells .
homo - and heterodimeric complex formation of hppmt4 proteins in s. cerevisiae , pmt4p forms homomeric complexes in vivo [ 3 ] .
to investigate whether this complex formation also occurs in h. polymorpha , we performed co - immunoprecipitation experiments using an ha epitope - tagged version of hppmt4p ( hppmt4pha ) and flag epitope - tagged hppmt4p ( hppmt4pflag ) .
in order to confirm whether the epitope - tagged hppmt4 proteins are functional in vivo , we tested functional complementation of the chemical reagent - sensitivity phenotype of the hppmt4increment mutant by expression of epitope - tagged hppmt4 proteins .
the hppmt4increment mutant cell was transformed with a plasmid containing ha - or flag - tagged hppmt4p .
as shown in fig 5a , the expression of ha - or flag - tagged hppmt4p in the hppmt4increment mutant complemented the sensitivity to several cell wall destabilizers and er stressors .
these complementation experiments demonstrate that c - terminal epitope - tagging does not inhibit the function of pmt4 protein in vivo in h. polymorpha .
next , to detect pmt4p - pmt4p complexes , hppmt4pha and hppmt4pflag proteins were co - expressed in the hppmt4increment mutant strain .
proteins solubilized from the crude membrane fractions by treatment with triton x - 100 and sodium deoxycholate were analyzed by co - immunoprecipitation experiments using anti - ha agarose or anti - flag m2 affinity gel .
the immunoprecipitate obtained was resolved with 8 % sds - page and detected by western blotting using antibodies against ha or flag .
the results from the experiment with the hppmt4increment mutant strain co - expressing hppmt4pha and hppmt4pflag demonstrated that hppmt4p forms homomeric complexes ( fig 5b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0129914.g005 fig 5 complex formation of hppmt4 proteins .
( a ) in vivo complementation analysis of epitope - tagged hppmt4 proteins .
a series of 10 - fold dilutions of yeast strain expressing the epitope - tagged hppmt4 proteins were spotted on ypd plates containing 10 mm caffeine , 0.1 mg / ml cfw , 5 mug / ml hgb , 0.01 % sds , 0.5 mug / ml tm , or 10 mm dtt and incubated for 2 days at 37degreesc .

the asterisk indicates a nonspecific protein band .
unlike s. cerevisiae pmt members , pmt2 and pmt4 subfamily members in mammals and flies form a heteromeric complex [ 58,59 ] .
furthermore , a very recent study showed that a. nidulans pmtc ( subfamily pmt4 ) forms not only homodimers but also heteromeric complexes with either pmta ( subfamily 2 ) or pmtb ( subfamily 1 ) [ 21 ] .
to investigate whether hppmt4p can interact with either hppmt1p or hppmt2p in h. polymorpha , we constructed h. polymorpha strains co - expressing either an ha epitope - tagged version of hppmt1p ( hppmt1pha ) and hppmt4pflag , or flag epitope - tagged hppmt2p ( hppmt2pflag ) and hppmt4pha .
co - immunoprecipitations were performed with anti - flag m2 affinity gel by using the solubilized membrane proteins derived from both strains , and then the corresponding immunoprecipitates were probed with anti - flag and anti - ha antibodies , respectively .
when probed with anti - flag antibody , two protein bands of approximately 86 kda and 89 kda were detected in the strains bearing hppmt4pflag ( fig 5c , upper panel ) and hppmt2pflag ( fig 5d , upper panel ) , respectively .
immunoblots probed with anti - ha antibody displayed the bands of hppmt1pha (~ 91 kda ) and hppmt4pha (~ 86 kda ) in the samples from the hppmt1pha and hppmt4pflag co - expressing strain ( fig 5c , lower panel ) and hppmt2pflag and hppmt4pha co - expressing strain ( fig 5d , lower panel ) , respectively .
furthermore , the hppmt1p - hppmt4p and hppmt2p - hppmt4p heterodimer complexes were also observed in the h. polymorpha dl - 1 strains ( s3 fig ) , although their band intensities were much lower than the band intensity detected in the strain harboring hppmt1pha and hppmt2pflag .
these results strongly suggest that h. polymorpha pmt4 proteins also participate in the formation of heteromeric complexes with either hppmt1p or hppmt2p .
discussion protein o - mannosylation , initiated by pmt family members in the er , is known to play important roles in various biological processes , including cell morphology , protein stability [ 27,60 ] , protein secretion [ 2,25 ] , cell wall integrity [ 5 ] , the budding process [ 24 ] , sorting [ 61 ] and localization of proteins , and virulence of pathogens [ 9,62 ] .
unlike the pmt1 / pmt2 subfamilies , which are highly redundant , the pmt4 subfamily has only one representative per species .
in the present study , we report the functional and molecular features of hppmt4p , a unique representative of the pmt4 subfamily in a thermotolernat methylotrophic yeast h. polymorpha with high industrial potential .
we showed that the function of hppmt4p , as a key player in o - mannosylation of cell surface proteins , is critical for resistance to cell wall and osmotic stresses .
moreover , we presented a novel finding that hppmt4p forms not only a homomeric complex but also a heteromeric complex with either hppmt1p or hppmt2p in h. polymorpha , which is distinctive from s. cerevisiae that is known to form exclusively heterocomplex between the pmt1 and pmt2 subfamilies .
the physiological effect of pmt4 deletion has been investigated in several organisms from yeast to humans .
in s. cerevisiae , disruption of pmt4 exhibited no obvious growth defect phenotype , and only multiple pmt gene disruptions including a pmt4 mutation partially showed conspicuous phenotypes [ 5 ] .
for example , the s. cerevisiae pmtlpmt3pmt4delta triple mutant was only slightly affected in spore germination , whereas the s. cerevisiae pmt2pmt4delta double mutant can grow only when osmotically stabilized .
the s. cerevisiae pmt1pmt4delta and pmt1pmt3pmt4delta mutants are temperature sensitive , whereas s. cerevisiae pmtlpmt2pmt4delta and pmt2pmt3pmt4delta mutations seemed to be lethal .
in contrast to s. cerevisiae pmt4 , just a single deletion of pmt4 homologs of other yeast and filamentous fungal species generated apparent defects in cell morphogenesis .
in s. pombe , the oma4 single mutant strain , which is a deletion of the scpmt4 homolog , forms an abnormal cell wall and septum , thereby exhibiting severely altered cell morphology and cell - cell separation [ 63 ] .
hyphal formation of a c. albicans pmt4 mutant was defective on defined lee 's medium but increased under embedded or hypoxic conditions [ 9 ] .
in the opportunistic human pathogen c. neoformans , cnpmt4 is also crucial for cell morphogenesis and virulence [ 10,62 ] .
in another opportunistic human pathogenic fungus , a. fumigatus , deletion of afpmt4 not only affects cell growth , hyphal morphology , and conidiation but also causes hypersensitivity to echinocandins .
in the plant pathogen u. maydis , umpmt4 is required for fungal pathogenesis through its essential role in appressorium formation and plant penetration [ 15 ] .
similarly , in another plant pathogenic fungus , b. cinerea , pmt4 plays a specific role in virulence [ 8 ] .
furthermore , mutations of the d. melanogaster pomt1 ( pmt4 subfamily ) causes defects in muscle attachment and changes in muscle contraction during larval development [ 64 ] .
in mice , targeted deletion of the pomt1 gene results in embryonic lethality , which is due to structural and functional defects in the first basal membrane of the embryo [ 65 ] .
mutations in the human pomt1 cause not only walker - warburg syndrome ( wws ) [ 66 ] but also muscle - eye - brain disease ( meb ) [ 67 ] .
in the present study , we also showed that just a single deletion of hppmt4 resulted in severe defects in cell wall integrity and stress resistance of h. polymorpha , indicating certain unique roles of hppmt4p in o - mannosylation of glycoproteins , which cannot be fully complemented by the function of other pmt members .
previous studies in s. cerevisiae and c. albicans showed the transcriptional alteration of pmt genes in response to defective o - mannosylation [ 52 , 68 ] .
to explore the transcriptional regulation of the h. polymorpha pmt genes , we determined the mrna levels of all pmt subfamily genes in the wild - type and pmt4increment mutant strains .
in contrast to the increased levels of the pmt1 subfamily ( pmt1 and pmt5 ) transcripts in the pmt4 mutant of c. albicans [ 68 ] , any compensatory up - regulation of other pmt genes was not detected in the h. polymorpha pmt4increment mutant ( s4a fig ) .
in addition , the transcript levels of all h. polymorpha pmt subfamilies were not significantly changed even in the presence of tm or a pmt1p inhibitor .
on the other hand , all five pmt genes of p. pastoris were reported to be extremely down - regulated during growth on methanol as compared to that on glycerol due to lower energy availability [ 11 ] .
thus , we tested the expression levels of h. polymorpha pmt genes on different culture media such as sulfur - free b media ( synthetic media with 2 % glucose without any sulfur source ) [ 69 ] , sd medium ( synthetic minimal medium ) , and ypm medium containing 2 % methanol as the sole carbon source ( s4b fig ) .
the qrt - pcr analysis showed that although there was no significant alteration in the expression levels of the hppmt genes in b and sd media , the pmt1 , pmt2 , and pmt6 genes were dramatically repressed by more than 2 - fold on methanol - containing media .
it is notable that , among the hppmt genes coding for three major isoforms pmt1p , pmt2p , and pmt4p , the transcript level of hppmt4 was found to be maintained at a relatively constant level under various culture conditions tested in this study .
in yeast , damage to the cell wall is sensed by plasma membrane sensors in the wsc family ( wsc1p to wsc4p ) and mid2p , which are highly o - mannosylated surface proteins [ 27 ] .
we demonstrate that hppmt4p mediates o - mannosylation primarily of cell surface proteins , such as hpwsc1 and hpmid2 proteins , which are involved in cell wall integrity signaling .
previously , we reported that the basal level of mpk1 mapk phosphorylation highly increased in the hppmt1pmt5increment and hppmt1pmt6increment mutant strains , in which hypomannosylation was also observed for hpwsc1ha and hpmid2flag proteins [ 41 ] .
however , in the present study , we observed that the basal level of the phosphorylated mpk1p in the hppmt4increment mutant strain was dramatically lower than that in the wild - type strain under normal conditions .
this suggests that hpwsc1p and hpmid2p might be mannosylated by both pmt1 / 2 family members and pmt4p , but in distinct regions , as shown in s. cerevisiae [ 27 ] , and that the o - mannosylation of these sensor proteins by pmt4p is required for maintaining basal activity of cell wall sensors under normal cell conditions .
until now , it has generally been considered that a member of the pmt1 subfamily interacts with a member of the pmt2 subfamily , whereas the pmt4 subfamily member self - dimerizes for maximal o - mannosyltransferase activity in yeasts and other fungi .
however , in contrast to the findings for fungal species , the pmt2 subfamily and pmt4 subfamily are reported to form a heterodimeric complex in mammals .
the co - immunoprecipitation experiments in s. cerevisiae showed that pmt1p - pmt3p and pmt2p - pmt5p are present in minor amounts , although pmt1p - pmt2p and pmt5p - pmt3p were the predominant complexes [ 3 ] .
similarly , in h. polymorpha , pmt2p can also interact with pmt5p , a minor member of the pmt1 family , in the absence of the preferred partner pmt1p [ 41 ] .
both of these yeasts have a redundant member of the pmt1 and pmt2 subfamilies , which could substitute if the dominant members are lost .
notably , a very interesting report on complex formation in all pairwise combinations of three a. nidulans pmts , one from each subfamily , was recently presented [ 21 ] , describing the possibility of complex formation between pmt1 or pmt2 subfamily and pmt4 subfamily members in other fungal species .
our data from the co - immunoprecipitation analysis of the h. polymorpha wild - type strains co - expressing hppmt1pha and hppmt4pflag or hppmt2pflag and hppmt4pha strongly support that pmt1p - pmt4p and pmt2p - pmt4p complexes are also present in h. polymorpha .
to our knowledge , this is the first case where the formation of pmt1p - pmt4p and pmt2p - pmt4p complexes is shown to occur in a yeast species that possesses a redundant member of the pmt1 and pmt2 subfamilies .
compared to the pmt proteins of the budding yeasts s. cerevisiae and h. polymorpha , which contain two to three redundant members , many filamentous fungi , including a. nidulans , possess only one representative from each pmt subfamily .
animals have only the pmt2 and pmt4 subfamilies , except that all pmts are missing in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans [ 3 ] .
based on these findings , it can be speculated that pmt gene families have most likely evolved to lose redundant genes , while the complex formation necessary for enzymatic activity has diversified with simplification of the redundant pmt genes ( fig 6 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0129914.g006 fig 6 proposed evolution of the pmt gene family and their complex formation .
in s. cerevisiae , the pmt1 subfamily forms heteromeric complexes with the pmt2 subfamily while the pmt4 subfamily forms homomeric complexes .
pmt1p interacts mainly with pmt2p , while interaction between pmt1p and pmt3p , or interaction of pmt2p with pmt5p occurs only in the absence of their preferred partners .
in a. nidulans , pmtb ( subfamily pmt1 ) , pmta ( subfamily pmt2 ) , and pmtc ( subfamily pmt4 ) form heteromeric complexes in every possible subfamily combination , and pmtc also interacts with itself .
in mammals , pomt2 ( subfamily pmt2 ) forms a heteromeric complex with pomt1 ( subfamily pmt4 ) .
in h. polymorpha , pmt1p forms heteromeric complexes mainly with pmt2p .
interaction between hppmt2p and hppmt5p can occur in the absence of hppmt1p .
hppmt4p forms both homomeric complexes , and heteromeric complexes with either hppmt1p or hppmt2p .
rectangles indicate the pmt1 subfamily , ovals indicate the pmt2 subfamily , and pentagons indicate the pmt4 subfamily .
in this study , we showed that the function of h. polymorpha pmt4 protein is critical , particularly for o - mannosylation of membrane proteins , which is crucial for protein stability .
likewise , in s. cerevisiae , the integral transmembrane proteins axl2 / bud10 require pmt4p - mediated o - mannosylation for their proper folding and the avoidance of degradation in the golgi apparatus [ 24 ] .
in addition , un - o - mannosylated fus1p accumulates in late golgi structures , suggesting that o - mannosyl modification by pmt4p functions as a sorting determinant for cell surface delivery of fus1p [ 42 ] .
these results point to different roles of pmt4p from those of pmt1 / 2 subfamily members in o - mannosylation of glycoproteins .
it seems that pmt1 / 2 subfamily members are mainly responsible for o - mannosylation of secretory proteins , while pmt4p is instead focused on surface membrane proteins .
along with n - glycosylation engineering , o - glycoengineering has been attempted in order to produce recombinant secretory proteins with mammalian - type glycosylation patterns in several yeast species , including s. cerevisiae [ 70,71 ] , p. pastoris [ 72 ] , and ogataea minuta [ 73 ] .
thus , understanding the specific functions of each pmt member in protein o - mannosylation in yeast is important to elucidate their differential effects on different target proteins , which should be considered when developing yeast expression systems either for production of secretory glycoproteins or for surface display of membrane glycoproteins .

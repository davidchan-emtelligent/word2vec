background hla - dps are class ii mhc proteins mediating immune responses to many diseases .
peptides bind mhc class ii proteins in the acidic environment within endosomes .
acidic ph markedly elevates association rate constants but dissociation rates are almost unchanged in the ph range 5.0 - 7.0 .
this ph - driven effect can be explained by the protonation / deprotonation states of histidine , whose imidazole has a pka of 6.0 .
at ph 5.0 , imidazole ring is protonated , making histidine positively charged and very hydrophilic , while at ph 7.0 imidazole is unprotonated , making histidine less hydrophilic .
we develop here a method to predict peptide binding to the four most frequent hla - dp proteins : dp1 , dp41 , dp42 and dp5 , using a molecular docking protocol .
dockings to virtual combinatorial peptide libraries were performed at ph 5.0 and ph 7.0 .
results the x - ray structure of the peptide - hla - dp2 protein complex was used as a starting template to model by homology the structure of the four dp proteins .
the resulting models were used to produce virtual combinatorial peptide libraries constructed using the single amino acid substitution ( saas ) principle .
peptides were docked into the dp binding site using autodock at ph 5.0 and ph 7.0 .
the resulting scores were normalized and used to generate docking score - based quantitative matrices ( ds - qms ) .
the predictive ability of these qms was tested using an external test set of 484 known dp binders .
they were also compared to existing servers for dp binding prediction .
the models derived at ph 5.0 predict better than those derived at ph 7.0 and showed significantly improved predictions for three of the four dp proteins , when compared to the existing servers .
they are able to recognize 50 % of the known binders in the top 5 % of predicted peptides .
conclusions the higher predictive ability of ds - qms derived at ph 5.0 may be rationalised by the additional hydrogen bond formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen belonging to the peptide position before p1 ( p - 1 ) and the protonated epsilon - nitrogen of his79beta .
additionally , protonated his residues are well accepted at most of the peptide binding core positions which is in a good agreement with the overall negatively charged peptide binding site of most mhc proteins .
background major histocompatibility complex class ii ( mhc class ii ) proteins are normally found in b lymphocytes , dendritic cells , and macrophages ; they are primarily involved in processing foreign , extracellular antigens , which are endocytozed and then enclosed in endosomes containing acid proteases .
the ph in endosomes ranges from 4.5 to 6.0 [ 1 ] .
in endosomes , antigens are degraded into oligopeptides .
mhc class ii proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and bind to a protein known as the mhc class ii - associated invariant chain ( ii ) .
ii facilitates the export from the er of mhc class ii proteins and prevents binding to peptides resident in the er. the complex mhc - ii enters a specific endocytic compartment , called miic ( mhc class ii compartment ) , which fuses with endosomes .
ii is cleaved initially to the so - called clip fragment , with clip later being displaced by high - affinity peptides .
the peptide - mhc class ii protein complex is translocated to the cell surface , where it is recognized by cd4 + t cells .
peptides binding to mhc class ii vary in length from 12 to 25 amino acids , yet the binding site accepts only nine peptide residues , the rest extending from both ends as the cleft is open - ended .
the side chains of bound peptides project into several binding pockets while a system of hydrogen bonds forms between the peptide backbone and the side chain atoms of the mhc [ 2 ] .
human mhcs , known as hla ( human leukocyte antigens ) , are extremely polymorphic and polygenic .
the imgt / hla database lists over 1,600 hla class ii proteins [ 3 ] .
hlas class ii contain three loci : dr , dq and dp. dr and dq proteins are well studied , while dp was initially considered of lesser importance in immune responses .
however , it is now clear that hla - dp proteins have important roles in mediating the immune response to many diseases , such as graft - versus - host ( gvh ) disease [ 4 ] , sarcoidosis [ 5 ] , juvenile chronic arthritis [ 6 ] , graves' disease [ 7 ] , hard metal lung disease [ 8 ] and especially , chronic beryllium disease [ 9 ] .
recently , the x - ray structure of the hla - dp2 ( dpa * 0103 , dpb1 * 0201 ) in complex with a self - peptide derived from the hla - dr alpha - chain has been determined [ 10 ] .
although the overall structure of dp2 is similar to that of other mhc class ii proteins , it contains a unique solvent - exposed acidic pocket containing three glutamic acids ( glu26beta , glu68beta and glu69beta ) .
this pocket may be able to bind beryllium and present it to t cells , providing a mechanistic explanation that underlies chronic beryllium disease [ 10,11 ] .
x - ray data also reveals that the dp2 binding site comprises four binding pockets : deep , hydrophobic pockets p1 and p6 ; large , shallow , negatively charged p4 ; and deep , narrow and polar pocket p9 .
peptides bind to mhc class ii proteins in an acidic environment ( ph ~ 5.0 ) .
bell - shaped profiles with optima at ph 5.0 are observed in many peptide - mhc class ii binding experiments [ 12 - 14 ] .
acidic ph markedly elevated association rate constants 40 fold ; dissociation rates are , by contrast , almost unchanged in the ph range 5.0 - 7.0 [ 13 ] .
the equilibrium binding level is thus enhanced at ph 5.0 .
the influence of ph on the binding equilibrium can be explained by subtle conformational changes due to altered protonation and deprotonation states and near neighbor interactions .
the only amino acid sensitive to ph in the range 5.0 - 7.0 is histidine .
the side - chain pka of the his imidazole is 6.0 .
at ph 5.0 imidazole is protonated and his is thus positively charged and very hydrophilic .
at ph 7.0 , imidazole is unprotonated making his less hydrophilic .
thus , a pair of amino acids consisting of his and a hydrophobic residue could function as a ph - sensitive " his button " [ 14 ] .
it " closes " at ph 7.0 ( hydrophobic interaction ) and " opens " at ph 5.0 ( hydrophobic - charge repulsion ) .
such ph - sensitive switch was observed for his33alpha in the formation of hla - dr1 - hla - dm complexes [ 14 ] .
there are five his residues in the hla - dp binding cleft : four belong to the alpha - chain ( positions 5 , 16 , 44 and 79 ) and one to the beta - chain ( position 79 ) .
all five histidine residues are conserved among dp proteins .
his79beta side chain contacts the binding peptide in the vicinity of peptide position 2 .
recently , a favorable pi - pi stacking between the aromatic rings of his79beta and his2peptide was identified [ 15 ] .
the other his residues are remote from the binding site and do not make contact with the bound peptide .
molecular docking is a key structure - based method with significant utility in drug design , bioinformatics , and immunoinformatics .
in contrast to sequence - based approaches , virtual docking experiments do not require extensive pre - existing experimental data .
the only information necessary is a reliable model of the peptide - mhc protein complex , as provided by x - ray crystallography .
docking methodology allows the development of predictive models where the training and test data are fully independent , thus , eliminating any possibility of over - fitting .
we use rigid docking to identify optimised bound peptide conformations ; since even for a nonamer , a fully unconstrained peptide docking would be of a prohibitively extended duration .
however , since the number of distinct peptide conformations observed within currently - known x - ray structures remains very small , we make the parsimonious and wholly - reasonable assumption that peptides will bind in a similar conformation .
molecular docking has been extensively and rigorously tested on both peptide - mhc class i and peptide - mhc class ii complexes .
as an approach to evaluating peptide binding to mhcs , it has proved to be rapid , accurate , and reliable [ 15 - 17 ] .
recently , we applied a molecular docking protocol to a library of modeled peptide - dp2 complexes to assess the contribution of each of the 20 naturally occurred amino acids at each of the nine binding core positions and four flanking residues ( two at both ends ) [ 15 ] .
the normalized binding scores formed a quantitative matrix ( qm ) , known also as a position - specific scoring matrix ( pssm ) .
pssms are a commonly used representation of motifs or patterns within biological sequences .
the predictive ability of the derived qm was assessed using an external test set of known binders to dp2 .
a comparison to predictions made by existing servers for dp2 binding prediction indicated an improvement in performance offered by our docking score - based qm ( ds - qm ) [ 15 ] .
in the present study , we modelled by homology four of the most frequent hla - dp proteins [ 18 ] : dp1 ( dpa1 * 0201 / dpb1 * 0101 ) , dp41 ( dpa1 * 0103 / dpb1 * 0401 ) , dp42 ( dpa1 * 0103 / dpb1 * 0402 ) and dp5 ( dpa1 * 0201 / dpb1 * 0501 ) .
we applied a similar docking protocol to derive ds - qms for peptide binding prediction [ 15 ] .
to investigate the influence of ph on the predictive ability , different qms were derived at two ph values : 5.0 and 7.0 .
the qms were validated using external test sets and compared to other servers for dp binding prediction .
additionally , in order to analyze the peptide - mhc protein interaction interface , a single docking of hla - dp2 ( dpa * 0103 , dpb1 * 0201 ) in complex with a self - peptide derived from the hla - dr alpha - chain ( pdb code : 3lqz ) was analyzed using rosetta dock [ 19 ] .
our analysis affords a deep and detailed analysis of the different amino acid preferences at each position of peptides binding dp proteins .
methods input data the x - ray structure of the hla - dp2 ( dpa * 0103 , dpb1 * 0201 ) protein , in complex with a self - peptide derived from the hla - dr alpha - chain , was used as the starting structure for homology modelling [ 10 ] .
the covalently bound peptide was separated and defined as chain c. it consists of nine binding core positions ( fhylpflps ) and six flanking residues ( rk at the n terminus and tggs at the c terminus ) .
the conformation of the protein was used to model by homology the four hla - dp proteins .
the conformation of the bound peptide was used as a template for the modelling of four virtual combinatorial peptide libraries .
homology modelling models of four hla - dp proteins were built using the x - ray structure of hla - dp2 protein ( pdb code : 3lqz ) as the template for homology modelling .
hla - dp proteins used were : dp1 ( dpa1 * 0201 / dpb1 * 0101 ) , dp41 ( dpa1 * 0103 / dpb1 * 0401 ) , dp42 ( dpa1 * 0103 / dpb1 * 0402 ) , and dp5 ( dpa1 * 0201 / dpb1 * 0501 ) .
the polymorphic amino acids among the first 80 amino acids from chain alpha ( dpa1 ) and the first 90 amino acids from chain beta ( dpb1 ) were mutated accordingly .
the resulting structure , in complex with the native peptide from the starting x - ray structure , was subjected to energy minimization by simulated annealing using the amber force field [ 20 ] .
each peptide - dp protein complex was used as a starting structure for generating the corresponding virtual peptide library .
combinatorial peptide library the nine positions forming the peptide binding core were examined .
four peptide libraries , each consisted of 172 peptides ( 19 amino acids x 9 positions + 1 original ligand ) , were built using pymol [ 21 ] .
the saas ( single amino acid substitution ) approach was used to model the conformations of each altered side chains : after substitution , the peptide was minimized while keeping the mhc protein rigid .
the protonation state of ionisable protein side chains was assigned to a standard ionisable state : neutral for his ; positively charged for arg and lys ; and negatively charged for asp and glu [ 22 ] .
in the case of docking at ph 5 , his was considered to be positively charged .
autodock protocol a parallelized version of autodock 4.2 [ 23 ] , employing an implementation of the lamarckian genetic algorithm ( ga ) , was used to model the peptide binding to hla - dps .
all simulations were run on the ibm blue gene - p of the bulgarian supercomputing centre .
the input ligands for autodock 4.2 were prepared by using tools developed in - house using c # and . net .
the output data were mined by python scripts using the mgl tools 1.5.4 package [ 24 ] .
all retained poses considered in the study had an rmsd below 2.0 a. to limit the computational burden of calculating peptide - mhc interactions at positions not involved in the static docking , all coordinates were kept fixed apart from the peptide residues of interest .
these were left flexible .
all ga settings were kept to their default values , apart from the number of energy evaluations and the number of generations which were set to 2 500 000 and 27 000 , respectively .
the docking grid was defined as a cuboid with respective dimensions of : 68 a x 80 a x 80 a for dp1 , 72 a x 80 a x 82 a for dp41 , 72 a x 80 a x 82 a for dp42 and 72 a x 80 a x 82 a for dp5 which encompassed the entire peptide binding site on dp. the output from ten independent ga runs for each ligand was processed and the pose ( binding conformation ) with the lowest free energy of binding ( feb ) was considered .
feb values represent the direct output from the autodock 4.2 scoring function which takes into consideration weighted terms for van der waals dispersion / repulsion , hydrogen bonding , electrostatics , desolvation interactions , and the change in torsional free energy when the ligand goes from an unbound to a bound state .
docking score - based quantitative matrices ( ds - qms ) the febs derived from the docking experiments had negative and positive values .
negative febs correspond to binding peptides , while positive febs correspond to non - binding peptides .
only negative febs were considered ; non - binding amino acids were assigned the penalty score of - 10 .
the febs were normalized position per position using the following formula : ( 1 ) febi,norm = febi - feb febmax - febmin , where febi is the binding energy of the i - th peptide , feb is the average for a given position , febmax and febmin are the maximum and minimum febs for a given position .
normalized febs were multiplied by ( - 1 ) before being entered into the quantitative matrices ( qms ) for ease of presentation .
thus , the positive febs correspond to preferred amino acids , and negative febs to non - preferred residues .
eight qms were derived : two for each hla - dp protein at ph 5.0 and ph 7.0 , respectively .
test set four test sets of peptides known to bind hla - dp1 , hla - dp41 , hla - dp42 , and hla - dp5 , respectively , were collected from the immune epitope database [ 25 ] ( june 2011 release ) .
the test set of dp1 binders contained 102 peptides originating from 60 proteins .
the dp41 test set contained 152 binding peptides from 71 proteins .
the dp42 test set contained 122 binding peptides from 66 proteins .
the dp5 test set contained 108 binding peptides from 66 proteins .
the peptides had different lengths .
no multiple binders were used .
each protein was represented as a set of overlapping nonamers .
the nonameric subsequence of any known binder with the highest score was considered a binder ; all other protein nonamers were considered as non - binders .
the binding score of each nonamer was calculated as a sum of the weights of all nine positions or of different combinations thereof .
the tests were performed under conditions similar to those which an experimental immunologist might use : proteins were cleaved into overlapping nonamers , the binding score of each nonamer was predicted .
nonamers were then ranked according to their binding score and the top 5 % of the predicted nonamers was selected .
the selected peptides were then compared to the known binders .
if the nonamer sequence was part of the known binder sequence , the predicted peptide was considered as a true predicted binder .
the ratio of all true predicted binders to all binders in the corresponding test set defined the sensitivity of prediction at the top 5 % cut - off .
the test sets used in the present study are given as additional file 1 .
additionally , the models were compared in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve ( auc ) .
two variables - sensitivity and 1 - specificity - were calculated at different thresholds .
auc is a quantitative measure of predictive ability and varies from 0.5 for random prediction to 1.0 for a perfect prediction .
rosetta dock protocol the rosetta dock server ( http :// rosettadock.graylab.jhu.edu ) was used to generate the pair interaction energies across the peptide - dp2 protein binding interface .
the x - ray structure of the peptide - hla - dp2 ( dpa * 0103 , dpb1 * 0201 ) complex ( pdb code : 3lqz ) was used as input .
the rosettadock output file contains a table of pair energies across the binding interface .
several energy terms are generated : etot is the sum of all energies between the pair residues ; eatr and erep are the lennard - jones attractive and repulsive energies , respectively ; esol is the solvation energy according to the lazaridis - karplus solvation model [ 26 ] , which penalizes buried polar groups ; ehbnd is the hydrogen bonding energy per residue ; epair is a statistically - based pair term derived from the pdb database , which favours salt bridges .
results pair energies across peptide - hla - dp2 protein binding interface the peptide - dp protein binding interface was analysed using the rosettadock server [ 19 ] .
it consists of 39 residues : 21 residues belong to alpha - chain ( 9 , 11 , 22 , 24 , 32 , 43 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 57 , 58 , 62 , 63 , 65 , 66 , 68 , 69 , 70 , 72 and 73 ) and 18 residues are from beta - chain ( 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 45 , 55 , 59 , 65 , 69 , 72 , 76 , 79 , 80 , 83 and 84 ) [ 10 ] ( figure 1 ) .
only five of the residues are polymorphic among the five most frequent dp proteins ( table 1 ) .
these are tyr / phe9beta , ala / asp / glu55beta , lys / glu69beta , val / met76beta and asp / gly84beta .
asp55beta is involved in a salt - bridge with peptide ser9 , while the other polymorphic residues do not form either an h - bond or a salt bridge with the bound peptide .

each peptide was docked separately into the corresponding dp rigid binding site .
ds - qms were derived based on normalized feb scores , as described in data and methods .
dockings were performed at two ph values : 5.0 and 7.0 .
over this ph range , only his undergoes protonation / deprotonation .
at ph 5.0 , his is protonated and very hydrophilic , yet at ph 7.0 his is neutral and less hydrophilic .
the eight ds - qms ( four at ph 5.0 and four at ph 7.0 ) derived here are given in additional file 2 .
external validation a test set comprising 484 peptides known to bind hla - dp1 , hla - dp41 , hla - dp42 or hla - dp5 , originating from 263 proteins , was used for external validation of the derived ds - qms .
initially , the sensitivity of the top 5 % of the best scored peptides for each position was assessed using ds - qms calculated at ph 7.0 and ph 5.0 .
next , all possible combinations of different positions were evaluated .
the most predictive models among all possible combinations between the nine peptide positions are shown in table 2 .
it is evident that almost all positions are involved in these highly predictive models , indicating that no peptide positions have a negligible effect on binding .
the results also indicate that the models derived at ph 5.0 seem to predict better than those derived at ph 7.0 .
moreover , different peptide positions are important for binding at different ph values .

both use sequence - based models powered by artificial neural networks ( ann ) .
netmhcii identifies nonamers , while iedb works only with 15mers .
the tests were performed as follows : protein sequences were converted into sets of overlapping peptides ( 9mers for netmhcii and 15mers for iedb ) , and the binding score of each peptide was predicted ; peptides were ranked according to their binding score , and the top 5 % of the ranked peptides were selected and compared to known binders .
if the predicted peptide was included in the known binder sequence , it was considered a true predicted binder .
the ratio of all true predicted binders to all binders in the corresponding test set defined the sensitivity of prediction at the top 5 % cut - off .
the sensitivities were recorded and compared to our best predicted models at ph 5.0 ( figure 2a ) .
additionally , servers were compared in terms of auc ( figure 2b ) .
it is evident that our ds - qm models out - performed state - of - the - art servers for dp1 , dp42 and dp5 proteins .
figure 2 sensitivities of the predictions calculated at threshold of top 5 % predicted binders ( a ) and auc values ( b ) by different servers for hla - dp binding prediction .
effect of ph on peptide and protein his residues as peptides typically bind to class ii mhc proteins in an acidic environment , with a ph between 4.5 and 5.5 , dockings were performed at ph 5.0 and ph 7.0 , and compared in terms of their predictive ability .
better prediction was found for the ds - qms derived at ph 5.0 .
the only amino acid sensitive to ph in the range 5.0 to 7.0 is histidine .
the pka of the his imidazole is 6.0 , thus making his protonated and very hydrophilic at ph 5.0 and unprotonated and less hydrophilic at ph 7.0 .
the influence of ph on the affinity of peptide binding to hla - dp proteins has two potential aspects : influence on peptide protonation / deprotonation and influence on protein binding site protonation / deprotonation .
figure 3 summarizes the normalized feb values for protonated and nonprotonated his residues at each of the nine peptide binding core positions .
it is clear that protonated his residues are preferred in most peptide positions ( p3 to p9 ) .
as the peptide binding site on dp proteins is predominantly negatively charged [ 29 ] , preference for positively charged his were expected .
figure 3 normalized feb values for protonated and nonprotonated his residues at each of the nine peptide binding core positions .
protonated his is strongly preferred in most positions .
five his residues are present in the hla - dp binding site : four belong to the alpha - chain ( positions 5 , 16 , 44 and 79 ) and one belongs to the beta - chain ( position 79 ) .
all are conserved among the studied dps .
only his79beta contacts the binding peptide in the vicinity of peptide position 2 ; the other his residues are distant from the binding site .
the protonation of his79beta allows an additional h - bond to be formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen belonging to peptide position - 1 ( the position before p1 ) and the imidazole epsilon - nitrogen of his79beta ( figure 4 ) .
the estimated n - h ... o = c bond energy for polypeptides in water environment lies within the range : 1.5 - 2 kcal / mol [ 30 ] .
this means that the formation of this additional h - bond can increase the binding affinity constant of the peptide - protein complex by over an order of magnitude in the absence of other effects .
this may explain the enhanced experimentally - observed equilibrium binding level seen at ph 5.0 [ 13 ] .
figure 4 at ph 5.0 an additional hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl oxygen from the peptide position ( - 1 ) ( here lys - 2 ) and the imidazole epsilon - nitrogen of protein his 79beta is formed .
discussion in the present study , molecular docking procedures developed recently for peptide binding prediction to hla - dp2 protein [ 15 ] were significantly extended to include the four most frequent dp proteins [ 18 ] : dp1 ( dpa1 * 0201 / dpb1 * 0101 ) , dp41 ( dpa1 * 0103 / dpb1 * 0401 ) , dp42 ( dpa1 * 0103 / dpb1 * 0402 ) and dp5 ( dpa1 * 0201 / dpb1 * 0501 ) .
the x - ray structure of the peptide - hla - dp2 protein complex was used as a starting template to model by homology the structure of the four dp proteins .
in turn , these were used to generate combinatorial peptide libraries built using the saas principle .
peptides were docked into the dp binding site using autodock at ph 5.0 and ph 7.0 .
the resulting scores were recorded , normalized , and used to generate ds - qms .
the predictive ability of these qms was tested using an external test set and compared to existing servers for dp binding prediction .
the models derived at ph 5.0 predict better than those derived at ph 7.0 , showing significantly improved predictions for three of the four dp proteins , when compared to current state - of - the - art servers .
ds - qms can recognize 50 % of the known binders in the top 5 % of predicted peptides .
moreover , a single docking of hla - dp2 ( dpa * 0103 , dpb1 * 0201 ) in complex with a self - peptide derived from the hla - dr alpha - chain ( pdb code : 3lqz ) was analysed using rosettadock .
this characterised more fully the interacting amino acids across the peptide - mhc binding interface , helping identify amino acid preferences at each position of the peptide binding core .
peptide binding pocket 1 ( p1 ) consists of 11 residues ( table 3 ) .
ten of them are conserved and only asp / gly84beta is dimorphic ( figure 5 ) .
dp1 and dp5 contain asp84beta , while dp41 and dp42 contain gly84beta as does dp2 .
aromatic amino acids such as phe , tyr , trp and his , as well as aliphatic ile and leu are able to bind into this pocket .

the influence of ph on the affinity of peptides binding to hla - dp has two main aspects : influence on peptide protonation / deprotonation and influence on protein binding site protonation / deprotonation .
at ph 5.0 , his is positively charged and it is preferred at peptide positions 3 to 9 .
among the five his residues in the hla - dp binding site , only the protonation state of his79beta affects peptide binding .
at ph 5.0 an additional hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the peptide position before p1 ( p - 1 ) and the imidazole epsilon - nitrogen of his79beta ( figure 4 ) .
this h - bond increases the peptide binding affinity by more than 3 orders of magnitude , perhaps explaining the higher experimentally - observed equilibrium binding level seen at ph 5.0 [ 30 ] .
the peptide - protein association rate constants greatly increases at ph 5.0 (~ 40 - fold ) , while the dissociation rates are almost unchanged in the ph range 5.0 - 7.0 [ 13 ] .
thus , one may speculate that the peptide - protein complex formed in the acidic environment of endosomes will also be stable in the neutral environment of the cell surface .
conclusion for peptide binding to the four most frequent hla - dp proteins ( dp1 , dp41 , dp42 and dp5 ) , statistically the ds - qms derived through molecular docking simulations at ph 5.0 gave better predictions than those derived at ph 7.0 and performed better than current state - of - the - art servers for mhc binding prediction .
clear differences are observed in our x - ray - based protein - peptide models : an additional hydrogen bond is formed between the backbone carbonyl oxygen belonging to the peptide position before p1 and the protonated epsilon - nitrogen of his79beta .
this additional hydrogen bond may provide additional stabilization for all peptide regardless of their sequences , provided that they have a sufficiently long n - terminal extension .
protonated his residues make favourable interactions at most of the peptide binding core positions .

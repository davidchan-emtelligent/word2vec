the consistent use of the taxonomic system of binomial nomenclature ( genus and species ) was first popularized by linnaeus nearly three - hundred years ago to classify mainly plants and animals .
his main goal was to give labels that would ensure that biologists could agree on which organism was under investigation .
one - hundred fifty years later , darwin considered the term species as one of convenience and not essentially different from variety .
in the modern era , exploration of the world 's niches together with advances in genomics have expanded the number of named species to over 1.8 million , including many microorganisms .
however , even this large number excludes over 90 % of microorganisms that have yet to be cultured or classified .
in naming new isolates in the microbial world , the challenge remains the lack of a universally held and evenly applied standard for a species .
the definition of species based on the capacity to form fertile offspring is not applicable to microorganisms and 70 % dna - dna hybridization appears rather crude in light of the many completed genome sequences .
the popular phylogenetic marker , 16s rrna , is tricky for classification since it does not provide multiple characteristics or phenotypes used classically for this purpose .
using most criteria , agreement may usually be found at the genus level , but species level distinctions are problematic .
these observations lend credence to the proposal that the species concept is flawed when applied to prokaryotes .
in order to address this topic , we have examined the taxonomy of extremely halophilic archaea , where the order , family , and even a genus designation have become obsolete , and the naming and renaming of certain species has led to much confusion in the scientific community .
historical background an important challenge in the classification of microorganisms is ensuring that scientists can follow the pedigree of isolates in the literature .
this laudable goal is however especially difficult to achieve for microbes that have a long history and where variants have been isolated and re - isolated from an abundance of niches in the laboratories of many different investigators .
for example , the group of extremely salt - loving halophilic microbes which produce red , pink , and purple hues in hypersaline ponds used to make salt from the sea , were among the earliest microorganisms to be recognized and described .
they were , not surprisingly , originally identified as agents of food spoilage , before the advent of refrigeration when salting was widely used for preserving fish and meats [ 1 ] .
some early isolates from dried and salted codfish ( klippfisch ) were documented in a 1919 review on causative agents of fish reddening by the german botanist , klebahn [ 2 ] .
notably , he isolated and named " bacillus halobius ruber " , aware that these bright vermillion halophilic microbes were not spore formers , but his isolate was subsequently lost .
a dozen years later , halophilic isolates thought to be similar to klebahn 's , were named " bacterium halobium " by petter in the kluyver laboratory in delft , holland [ 3 ] .
in the 1940s - 1960s , additional halophilic microorganisms were isolated from different countries and reported in the scientific literature with names such as halobacterium halobium , h. salinarium , and h. cutirubrum [ 4 ] .
many of these isolates were deposited in us , canadian , and european culture collections , but a substantial number of them were subsequently lost or renamed .
revision of the taxonomy of these extremely halophilic genera from bacillus to bacterium to halobacterium reflected the increasing sophistication of our knowledge of the microbial world during this period , and these changes were generally accepted by the scientific community .
in the modern era , there have been many more proposals for taxonomic revisions among these halophiles , some of which have been readily acceptable , and others that have since been challenged or refuted [ 5,6 ] .
a proposal to modernize haloarchaeal taxonomy and terminology among extremely halophilic microorganisms , the distinction of halophilic archaea from halophilic bacteria became apparent in the 1970 's through the molecular phylogenetic work of woese , who proposed the three - domain view of life .
while halophilic microorganisms represented many different taxonomic groups in the bacterial domain , those in the archaeal domain fell into a single order ( halobacteriales ) and family ( halobacteriacae ) [ 7 ] .
our understanding of the existence of the three domains has created ambiguity in the terminology used , since ' halobacteria ' traditionally referred to all extremely halophilic microorganisms , including both halophilic bacteria and halophilic archaea .
in order to clarify the definitions , we propose that the term halobacteria be reserved only for halophiles that are members of the bacterial domain , while haloarchaea be used only for halophiles that are members of the archaeal domain .
in addition , on a taxonomic level , the order halobacteriales should be designated as haloarchaeales and the family halobacteriaceae should be as haloarchaeaceae .
finally , the halobacterium genus would be better named haloarchaeum to reflect its membership in the archaeal rather than the bacterial domain .
these revisions would help update the taxonomy and terminology of halophilic microorganisms to be consistent with our current understanding of the microbial world .
taxonomic ambiguity among species while our proposed revision of haloarchaeal taxonomy is relatively simple , disentangling the taxonomy and pedigree within the original genus , halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) , is considerably more complex .
over the past twenty - five to fifty years , this genus witnessed a contraction in the number of recognized species from over a dozen to just a single species .
while some acquired new genus designations ( e.g. halobacterium volcanii changed to haloferax volcanii and halobacterium marismortui to haloarcula marismortui ) , in 1990 , grant and larsen proposed combining three common species , halobacterium halobium , h. salinarium , and h. cutirubrum , into a single one , h. salinarium [ 7 ] .
however , this proposal was not fully accepted by the community since the changes were not fully in accordance with the rules of the bacteriological code [ 8 ] .
in particular , halobium predated salinarium in the literature and , by convention , the former name should have taken precedence over the latter .
to complicate matters further , in 1996 , ventosa and oren proposed renaming of h. salinarium to h. salinarum [ 9 ] , removing an " i " , in their opinion , for linguistic reasons .
however , many investigators dissented and continued to use the original species designations .
in euzeby 's list of prokaryotic names with standing in nomenclature [ 10 ] , he reported that salinarium , is derived from the latin adjective salinarius a um , meaning " of salt works " , while salinarum is derived from salinae arum , meaning " salt works " , and concluded that salinarium was indeed correct .
there is no doubt that naming and renaming of these species has left the taxonomy of halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) species in disarray in the literature and in the haloarchaeal community .
perhaps the worst case of taxonomic ambiguity is for the first halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) isolate sequenced and also the most widely used haloarchaeal strain , which was published under the name h. halobium strain nrc - 1 [ 11 ] .
the origin of strain nrc - 1 is uncertain , though it likely appeared from the 1960 's collection of w. stoeckenius and was disseminated via w.f. doolittle ( personal communications ) to s. dassarma in the 1980's. in 2000 , the nrc - 1 strain was deposited by the dassarma laboratory in the american type culture collection ( atcc no .
700922 ) for standardization and distribution in the research community and has since been used by carolina biological supply company in the educational sphere ( carolina no. 154777 ) [ 12 ] .
stocks of the original culture used for sequencing are also maintained in the dassarma laboratory .
as a result of uncertainties regarding the origin of this strain , the authors of the complete genome sequencing paper [ 11 ] dropped the species designation , reverting to " halobacterium sp. strain nrc - 1 " , while its pedigree was being rigorously established and the relationships within this group of organisms fully clarified .
however , despite the lack of appearance of definitive information on the identity of nrc - 1 , gruber et al .
[ 13 ] published a paper in 2004 reclassifying the wild - type isolate as a strain of the ' h. salinarum ' species .
in so doing , these authors ignored a variety of differences between strains , including their own pulsed - field gel patterns , as well as variations in restriction maps of the unstable resident megaplasmids .
overreliance on phylogenetic trees based on 16s rrna sequences , some of which are already known to be divergent even within single haloarchaeal species [ 14 ] , was a serious shortcoming of this study .
reexamination of the available data on halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) isolates at the phylogenetic and taxonomic levels confirms the existence of serious complications .
the 16s rrna sequences vary in nearly all of the originally distinct species , with that of nrc - 1 and h. salinarium differing in several positions .
differences also exist between the nrc - 1 and h. halobium 23s rrna sequences , as well as between nrc - 1 and h. cutirubrum 5s rrna .
in fact , a recent publication even reported a major deletion in the 16s rrna promoter region of ' h. salinarum ' ( originally h. halobium ) strain r - 1 in comparison to strain nrc - 1 and other similar strains [ 15 ] .
the most compelling case for the existence of substantial taxonomic diversity among halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) isolates is from the recent genotyping analysis of cleland et al. using the diversilab reppcr system [ 16 ] .
in this study , some of the seven halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) strains in the atcc collection show differences quantitatively similar to haloarchaea that are classified as different genera of the halobacteriaceae ( haloarchaeaceae ) family .
their examination of nrc - 1 by this method ( figure 1 ) showed that this strain fell below 70 % similarity compared to other ' h. salinarium ' strains in atcc , suggesting that nrc - 1 should be given an entirely new species designation using that criterion .
this analysis supports our viewpoint that it is premature to reclassify all of these halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) isolates as a single species , especially without an existing consensus in the community on the definition of what constitutes a " species " among these organisms .

the two sequenced halobacterium species are included , the model strain nrc - 1 ( atcc 700922 ) and strain r - 1 ( atcc 29341 ) [ 14 ] , which appear to differ sufficiently enough to warrant distinct species designations .
phenotypes and pedigree at the phenotypic level , halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) strains have some clear - cut differences .
an especially striking difference is the absence , in ' h. salinarum ' ( e.g. strain r - 1 ) , of gas vesicles , which are characteristic of halobacterium sp. nrc - 1 .
gas vesicles permit nrc - 1 to move vertically in the water column in response to oxygen , light , and temperature , and the corresponding expression of gas vesicle protein genes can be clearly seen in dna microarray experiments [ 17,18 ] .
the lack of gas vesicles in ' h. salinarum ' indicates that these organisms exist in significantly different environments from nrc - 1 , with the latter inhabiting dynamic ones , and the former in more constant environments .
this notable phenotypic difference is easily visible even to the naked eye .
some other halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) species contain two different morphological types of gas vesicles in the same cell , those which are narrower and diagnostic of species inhabiting deep habitats , as well as those which are wider and found in shallow brines ( like nrc - 1 ) , suggesting the widespread environmental distribution of these species .
examined more broadly , isolate - specific differences have been shown to exist at the level of antibiotic - resistance markers , measured cations in cells , and protein , lipid , and sugar content in the cell envelopes [ 4 ] .
the pedigree of the various strains of halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) being studied in laboratories worldwide is also confounding .
one example is the unclear relationship between nrc - 1 and r - 1 , and another similar strain s - 9 , a purple membrane overproducer .
while some investigators reported that nrc - 1 , r - 1 , and s - 9 , were very close relatives [ 19 ] , others indicated otherwise [ 20,21 ] .
the stable gas vesicle - deficient strain , r - 1 , may be the parent of s - 9 , a strain which was isolated after extensive chemical mutagenesis , but r - 1 is probably not a descendent of nrc - 1 .
not surprisingly , the genome sequencing results showed at least 200 kb of additional dna in r - 1 compared to nrc - 1 and very little similarity in their resident megaplasmids [ 15 ] .
many additional examples of incongruent taxonomy and pedigree among halobacterium ( haloarchaeum ) species are reviewed by grant and larsen [ 7 ] and tindall [ 8 ] .
clearly , the frequent and questionable revisions in the taxonomy of these interesting microbes , and at times , the lack of careful maintenance and documentation of their pedigree , are a serious impediment to advancing the field .
epilogue the incredible precision of the genomic era has empowered microbiologists with the genetic blueprints of more than a thousand microorganisms and allowed for the development of many new approaches for the interrogation of their biology .
unfortunately , studies of certain microbes , such as the haloarchaea , have been made exceedingly difficult by the arbitrary and unnecessary renaming of strains , poor record keeping of pedigree , and the lack of a universal definition of species .
all of these shortcomings make it likely that future generations will not be able to fully interpret and utilize the current literature , ultimately diminishing the contributions of both past and present generations .
while rigorous genetic studies and complete genome sequences are destined to make a permanent contribution to the field , taxonomic rearrangements based on inadequate experimentation and flawed logic hold it back .
although these points resonate especially true among the haloarchaea , we suspect that similar taxonomic issues and challenges are quite widespread among other prokaryotes as well and are deserving of further scrutiny .
competing interests the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

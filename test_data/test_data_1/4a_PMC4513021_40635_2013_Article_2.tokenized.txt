adm , derived from a larger precursor peptide ( pro - adm ) , is released into the circulation during systemic inflammation , and the highest plasma concentrations are measured in patients with septic shock [ 1 ]. with a plasma half - life of approximately 20 min , it exerts multiple effects of which the most relevant appears to be vasodilation [ 2 ] .
the consequent clinical sequelae of increased adm concentrations are far from clear .
while elevated adm levels are associated with impaired outcome in sepsis patients [ 1 ] and the measurement of the circulating pro - peptide of adm might serve as a marker to assess disease severity and predict mortality [ 3 ] , administration of exogenous adm actually improved outcome in animal models of septic shock [ 4 ] .
intriguingly , in this issue of intensive care medicine experimental , two studies demonstrate beneficial effects of anti - adm antibodies administered in a murine cecal ligation and puncture ( clp ) model [ 5 , 6 ] .
these studies represent the first attempts at antibody targeting of the adm cascade in vivo .
struck et al. [ 5 ] describe the development of monoclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes of adm and their ability to attenuate sepsis - induced mortality in severe murine sepsis ( 100 % control group mortality within 2 to 3 days ) .
the severity of this model means that any long - term deleterious or beneficial effects of the antibody remain unknown .
notably , all antibodies directed against adm improved survival. of interest , the antibody against the n - terminal moiety of adm prevented mortality most effectively , while it inhibited adm agonistic activity by only 25 % .
wagner et al. [ 6 ] performed a more mechanistic study into the effects of ham1101 , the antibody targeted against the n - terminal part of adm , in a resuscitated murine clp model .
they show that ham1101 improves vasoactive responsiveness to catecholamines , attenuates systemic inflammation , and improves kidney function .
the beneficial effects on the kidneys are likely attributable to reduced inos expression and nitrotyrosine formation in ham1101 - treated animals .
the effects on inflammatory pmeters are surprising as adm itself has also been reported to inhibit inflammation [ 7 ] .
in summary , previous work has established that high endogenous levels of adm correlate with poor outcomes and that exogenous administration improved outcomes , while now it is reported that antagonism of adm using antibodies improves outcome in an animal sepsis model .
how can we explain these apparently conflicting results ?
we naturally tend to prefer simple linear reasoning .
however , reality , especially in the case of ( patho ) physiology , is more complex .
adm - mediated effects appear to represent yet another example of this fact .
timing and the magnitude of increase in adm may be especially relevant in understanding its clinical effects in sepsis .
in this respect , it is important to recognize that struck et al. found that the least efficacious antibody in terms of antagonistic activity exerted the largest beneficial effect on survival .
one could argue that other non - adm - dependent effects of the antibody may play a role .
however , it could also indicate that only very high concentrations of adm exert deleterious effects , while modest increases of this peptide are beneficial .
in addition to concentration - dependent and time - dependent effects , the specific clinical condition of sepsis , e.g. , hyper - vs hypodynamic sepsis , is also likely to play a role in the observed discrepancies .
it is clear that the path to clinical relevance at the bedside is long and bumpy , and based on the above described results , it is already clear that in sepsis patients , it will be a difficult task to define the therapeutic window of opportunity to modulate the adm pathway .
nevertheless , further investigation of the effects of modulating this pathway is clearly warranted .

taxanes are chemotherapeutic agents commonly used to treat several cancers .
however , the effects of taxanes on advanced gastric cancer ( agc ) are still not clear , especially when used as a first - line treatment .
this systematic review and meta - analysis aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of taxanes as a first - line treatment of agc .
the quality of our included studies was assessed using the cochrane risk of bias tool for rcts and nos scale for nrcts , and the data of the included studies was of satisfactory quality to analyze .
the outcomes included overall survival ( os ) , progression - free survival ( pfs ) , overall response rate ( orr ) , and toxicity .
taxanes significantly improved os ( hr = 0.84 , 95 % ci 0.76 - 0.92 , p = 0.0004 ) and had a slight effect on orr ( rr = 1.23 , 95 % ci 1.00 - 1.51 , p = 0.05 ) .
however , taxanes may also increase the risks of neutropenia and leucopenia , similar to effects observed in other conventional chemotherapeutic treatments such as oxaliplatin and epirubicin .
therefore , patient characteristics including concomitant diseases , physical condition , and prior therapies should be considered before selecting taxane - based treatments for agc .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction gastric cancer ( gc ) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide , particularly in developing countries1 .
most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of gc and usually present with metastasis at diagnosis owing to a lack of health awareness .
while radical gastrectomy has shown significant promise as a curative treatment for early gc , it is not satisfactory for cases of advanced gc ( agc ) 2 .
therefore , chemotherapy is still a vital treatment for agc worldwide3 .
for gc patients , particularly those with unresectable local agc , recurrent gc , or metastatic gc , systemic chemotherapy is the most common treatment option4 , 5 .
taxanes , a class of drugs including paclitaxel and docetaxel , have been widely used in various systemic chemotherapy regimens for agc6 , 7 .
paclitaxel ( taxol ) is an antileukemic and antitumor agent derived from the bark of the pacific yew tree taxus brevifolia 8 .
it was initially proven to have an assembly - promoting effect on microtubule proteins which interrupts cell division and proliferation9 - 11 .
upon isolation from the needle leaves of the european taxus baccata , docetaxel was characterized by a tricyclic taxane skeleton and antineoplastic activities similar to that of paclitaxel12 .
at present , taxanes are commonly prescribed to treat several cancers and have been shown to have an antitumor effect on lung cancer , gc , breast cancer , and ovarian cancer13 , 14 .
moreover , they have been consistently used in combination with other systemic chemotherapeutic agents including 5 - fluorouracil , cisplatin , bevacizumab , and s - 115 - 17 .
some meta - analyses have evaluated the use of paclitaxel and docetaxel against cancers such as advanced non - small - cell lung cancer , prostate cancer , and breast cancer18 - 21 .
however , to the best of our knowledge , no meta - analysis has evaluated the efficacy and safety of taxanes as palliative chemotherapy for agc .
since most clinical studies were conducted using either paclitaxel or docetaxel exclusively , a meta - analysis is warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the full taxane drug class for the systemic treatment of agc .
results search results we identified 1692 studies from a database search , and 1654 of these were excluded after reviewing the titles and abstracts .
ultimately , 11 studies met the inclusion criteria ( fig. 1 ) , including 6 randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) and 5 non - randomized controlled trials ( nrcts ) 22 - 32 .
these trials included a total of 1932 patients , with 969 in the taxane group and 963 in the control group .
all patients were diagnosed with agc , specifically with unresectable local agc , recurrent gc , or metastatic gc. we obtained data on patients' history of gastrectomy from four studies and found that approximately 29.4 % patients in the taxane group and 27.2 % patients in the control group had undergone gastrectomy .
all 11 studies investigated the first - line treatment options for agc .
detailed characteristics are shown in table 1 .
the quality of the studies was assessed using the cochrane risk of bias tool for rcts and nos scale for nrcts , showing that the data was of satisfactory quality to analyze ( fig. 2 and supplementary table s1 ) .
the quality of the evidence regarding overall survival , progression - free survival , and overall response rate were also evaluated following the grade approach and using gradepro software ( supplementary table s2 ) 33 .
publication bias was observed by performing a funnel plot on orr ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
since this test showed signs of bias , we conducted quantitative assessment using begg 's ( p = 0.64 ) and egger 's ( p = 0.20 ) tests using stata software .
the trim and fill analysis was also used for testing and adjusting for publication bias in our meta - analysis34 .
we observed that the logrr value ( 0.166 , 95 % ci 0.03 - 0.301 , p = 0.017 ) was similar to the results after trim and fill analysis ( 0.152 , 95 % ci 0.018 - 0.286 , p = 0.027 ) , indicating that the results of our study were stable ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
based on these qualitative results of publication bias , we concluded that the slight publication bias did not affect our overall results .

figure 2 risk of bias graph and summary of rcts .
overall survival we extracted os data from 10 studies ( roth et al.31 did not analyze os ) , including 928 patients in the taxane group and 923 patients in the control group .
the results indicated an advantage of taxanes as first - line systemic chemotherapeutic agents for agc patients compared with other agents ( fig. 3a ) .
the hazard ratio ( hr ) was 0.84 ( 95 % ci 0.76 - 0.92 , p = 0.0004 , i2 = 0 %) .
we performed a subgroup analysis comparing the different chemotherapy regiments and found that adding a taxane to known chemotherapy regimens had a moderate beneficial effect on os. the hr was 0.81 ( 95 % ci 0.72 - 0.91 , p = 0.0004 , i2 = 0 % , fig. 3b ) .
in the comparison between taxane - based chemotherapy and platinum - based chemotherapy , taxane - based chemotherapy trended toward a slight benefit over the platinum - based chemotherapy , but without statistical significance ( hr = 0.92 , 95 % ci 0.73 - 1.16 , p = 0.47 , i2 = 0 %) .
we also performed a subgroup analysis between the study types .
when grouped separately , the rcts ( hr = 0.81 , 95 % ci 0.72 - 0.92 , p = 0.0007 , i2 = 0 %) and the nrcts ( hr = 0.89 , 95 % ci 0.75 - 1.06 , p = 0.18 , i2 = 0 %) both showed a benefit when using a taxane , though the result in the nrct group was not statistically significant ( fig. 3c ) .
we then extracted the median length of the overall survival from the 11 studies and found that 9 of the 11 showed a longer median length of overall survival with a taxane ( supplementary table s3 ) , further suggesting a benefit of treating with a taxane .

( b ) subgroup analysis between the adding and replacing groups of the os .
( c ) subgroup analysis between the rct and nrct groups of the os. progression - free survival a total of 1487 patients from nine studies were included in the analysis of pfs .
the hr for pfs was 0.89 ( 95 % ci 0.78 - 1.00 , p = 0.06 , i2 = 15 %) , indicating that the use of a taxane could prolong the pfs of agc patients , although the p - value was 0.06 ( fig. 4a ) .
the results of the subgroup analysis indicated that the addition of a taxane improved pfs significantly compared to the original chemotherapy regimens ( hr 0.79 , 95 % ci 0.69 - 0.90 , p = 0.0006 , i2 = 0 %) .
taxane - based chemotherapy showed a similar effect compared with platinum - based chemotherapy ( hr = 0.95 , 95 % ci 0.76 - 1.19 , p = 0.66 , i2 = 0 % , fig. 4b ) .
in the subgroup of rct publications , taxane - based treatment trended toward improved pfs , but the results did not show statistical significance ( hr = 0.82 , 95 % ci 0.65 - 1.04 , p = 0.10 , i2 = 42 % , fig. 4c ) .
longer median progress - free survival was found with taxane use in 7 of 9 studies , indicating the benefit of taxanes for improving the length of progression - free survival ( supplementary table s2 ) .

( c ) subgroup analysis between the rct and nrct groups of the pfs .
overall response rate all of the included studies contained data on orr .
a total of 1742 patients were included in the analysis : 872 in the taxane group and 870 in the control group .
the risk ratio ( rr ) was 1.23 ( 95 % ci 1.00 - 1.51 , p = 0.05 , i2 = 60 % , fig. 5a ) .
our results indicated that using a taxane could lead to a more effective curative effect .
the subgroup analysis indicated that simply adding a taxane could significantly improve the orr ( rr 1.53 , 95 % ci 1.29 - 1.83 , p < 0.00001 , i2 = 0 % , fig. 5b ) .
we also compared the effect of platinum - or epirubicin - based chemotherapies with taxane - based chemotherapy .
the results indicated that taxane - based chemotherapy showed a similar effect both with epirubicin - based chemotherapy ( rr 1.14 , 95 % ci 0.70 - 1.87 , p = 0.59 , i2 = 5 %) and platinum - based chemotherapy ( rr 0.92 , 95 % ci 0.78 - 1.08 , p = 0.30 , i2 = 0 % , fig. 5b ) .
the results with subgroup analysis both in the rcts ( rr = 1.40 , 95 % ci 1.15 - 1.69 , p = 0.0006 , i2 = 17 %) and in the nrcts ( rr = 1.17 , 95 % ci 0.99 - 1.37 , p = 0.06 , i2 = 71 % , fig. 5c ) showed a more effective curative effect by using a taxane .

safety we analyzed the grade 3 and grade 4 toxicities of these studies .
the most common hematological toxicities were neutropenia , leucopenia , anemia , and thrombocytopenia .
the most common non - hematological toxicities included nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , febrile neutropenia , anorexia , and neuropathy .
taxane - based chemotherapy increased the risk of developing neutropenia and leucopenia when compared to the control group ( table 2 ) .
while the risk of developing thrombocytopenia decreased in comparison to control , it was not statistically significant .
compared to platinum - based or epirubicin - based chemotherapy , taxane - based chemotherapy showed no significant advantage or disadvantage in terms of safety .
detailed results are shown in table 3 .

discussion various clinical trials have evaluated chemotherapeutic drugs due to their important role in the treatment of agc .
agc treatment varies slightly in different geographical areas .
the national comprehensive cancer network ( nccn ) gastric cancer guidelines ( version 2.2016 ) recommend fluoropyrimidine combined with either cisplatin or oxaliplatin ; paclitaxel combined with either cisplatin or carboplatin ; docetaxel combined with cisplatin ; docetaxel , cisplatin combined with fluorouracil ( dcf ) ; or epirubicin and cisplatin combined with fluorouracil ( ecf ) as first - line chemotherapeutics for unresectable local agc , recurrent gc , or metastatic gc. the japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines ( version 4 , 2014 ) recommend s - 1 with cisplatin ; s - 1 combined with docetaxel ; or s - 1 and cisplatin combined with docetaxel ( dcs ) as the first - line treatment35 .
the european society for medical oncology ( esmo ) guidelines recommend epirubicin and oxaliplatin combined with 5 - fu ( eof ) ; epirubicin and cisplatin combined with 5 - fu ( ecf ) ; epirubicin and oxaliplatin combined with capecitabine ( eox ) ; or docetaxel and cisplatin combined with fluorouracil ( dcf ) as the first - line chemotherapy options for systematic chemotherapy36 .
first - line chemotherapy regimens that include a taxane might be good candidates for the combined treatment of agc37 .
however , the results of a meta - analysis comparing taxane - based chemotherapy and ecf indicated no benefits of taxanes38 .
therefore , we aimed to investigate the effect of adding a taxane to known chemotherapy regimens for systemic chemotherapy for agc .
it has been demonstrated that taxane - based chemotherapy is effective against several types of tumors .
in this respect , tian et al. found that the use of a taxane improved short - term local control in chinese patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma39 .
moreover , it has been reported that taxanes were beneficial for locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck ( scchn ) and advanced non - small cell lung cancer40 - 42 .
we concluded that taxanes significantly improved survival and os ( hr = 0.84 , p = 0.0004 ) compared with the control group in patients with agc .
moreover , taxanes also have a slight effect on orr ( rr = 1.23 , 95 % ci 1.00 - 1.51 , p = 0.05 ) , although these effects are not statistically significant .
the significant improvement in orr suggests that patients may be more sensitive to taxane - based treatments .
however , the safety - risk analysis uncovered negative effects , indicating that taxanes significantly increased the risk of developing neutropenia and leucopenia .
we performed a subgroup analysis to further the investigation , comparing data from the six rcts and five nrcts separately .
the rcts reported that taxanes significantly improved os , which is similar to the results above .
furthermore , taxanes improved the orr compared to the control group , suggesting that patients are more responsive to taxane - based treatments than control treatments .
the results of the analysis of the rcts indicated that taxanes increased the risk of developing febrile neutropenia and neuropathy .
this result was different from that obtained for the nrcts , which may be due to the small sample size .
further subgroup analyses were subsequently performed .
one subgroup analysis compared the effect of adding taxanes into known chemotherapy regimens .
the results indicated that adding taxanes significantly improved os , orr , and pfs , demonstrating that the incorporation of taxanes improved the systemic chemotherapeutic treatment of agc patients .
another two subgroup analyses evaluated the effects of platinum - or epirubicin - based chemotherapy regimens with taxane - based chemotherapy .
taxane - based chemotherapy did not improve os , pfs , or orr when compared with platinum - based chemotherapy , a result which was also observed by mao et al.43 .
likewise , roberto p et al. found that docetaxel and epirubicin - based chemotherapeutic regimens had similar effects on metastatic gastric cancer38 .
thus , adding a taxane to known chemotherapy regimens improved the systemic chemotherapeutical treatment of agc patients , but taxane - based chemotherapy did not have any advantage compared to the platinum - or epirubicin - based chemotherapies. with regard to toxicity , we found that the inclusion of a taxane increased the risk of neutropenia and leucopenia compared with the original chemotherapy regimens .
alternately , the inclusion of a taxane seemed to decrease the risk of thrombocytopena , but was not statistically significant .
the results of the comparison between single and combined treatment for agc were similar to those of other studies .
bittoni et al. found that first - line triple therapy might be superior to dual therapy for the treatment of agc patients regarding the orr and pfs44 .
mohammad et al. also found that first - line triple chemotherapy may be superior to a dual regimen in the treatment of advanced esophagogastric cancer patients45 .
these two studies also found that the triple therapy regimens increased the risk of toxicity , similar to our results .
conversely , sun et al. reported that single - agent treatment should be chosen as the first - line palliative chemotherapy option for older patients with gc46 .
therefore , the inclusion of a taxane in systemic chemotherapeutic treatments for agc could improve the therapeutic effect ; however , the benefits should be weighed against the risks of treatment - related toxicity .
similar to the survival analysis results , we did not find significant improvements in safety by replacing the drugs in known chemotherapy regimens with a taxane .
however , each drug has unique characteristics .
for example , compared with platinum - based chemotherapy , taxane - based chemotherapy increased the risk of neutropenia , leukopenia , and diarrhea but decreased the risk of neuropathy , nausea , and vomiting ( table 3 ) .
this result was similar to that of mao et al.43 .
moreover , taxane - based chemotherapy significantly increased the risk of developing neutropenia but decreased the risk of developing thrombocytopenia compared with epirubicin - based chemotherapy ( table 3 ) .
therefore , replacing chemotherapeutic drugs with a taxane did not significantly decrease the net overall risk of toxicity .
for this reason , systemic chemotherapeutic regimens should be chosen according to the patients' health status and drug characteristics .
further studies should evaluate better combinations of chemotherapeutic drugs .
in addition , the effects of newly emerging antineoplastic drugs and their correlation with traditional chemotherapeutic drugs , such as targeted therapies and chinese medicine47 , should also be investigated .
our systematic review and meta - analysis has some limitations .
first , the variance in the control group was not uniform due to the limited number of studies that evaluated the use of a taxane alone .
therefore , the heterogeneity might be higher than what was reported herein .
second , some subgroup analyses could not be done due to the limited number of studies , and some of our analyses included only two studies , which might decrease the stringency of the meta - analysis .
third , the quality of the included studies ( both rcts and nrcts ) was poor .
therefore , more high - quality rcts should be conducted to elucidate the role of taxane in the treatment of agc .
conclusions the addition of taxane to current first - line treatment options for agc can improve os , pfs , and orr ; however , these treatments concomitantly increase the risk of toxicity .
the effect of taxane is similar to that of conventional drugs such as oxaliplatin and epirubicin in known chemotherapy regimens .
therefore , other patient characteristics , including concomitant diseases , physical condition , and prior therapies , should be considered before choosing taxane .
methods study selection we searched the pubmed , embase , and the cochrane library databases for citations published before february 2016 .
the keywords searched included " taxane " , " taxol " , " paclitaxel " , " docetaxel " , " gastric cancer " , and " gastric carcinoma " .
the full search strategy is shown in the supplementary materials .
different search strategies were conducted for different databases , and the references of the included studies were also searched .
date extraction and outcomes the primary outcomes of our study were overall survival ( os ) , progression - free survival ( pfs ) , and overall response rate ( orr ) .
orr was defined as the sum of both partial and complete responses .
we also included grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events as safety outcomes .
two investigators ( jinxin shi and peng gao ) extracted the data from the full articles independently .
any disagreements were resolved by a third investigator .
eligibility criteria eligibility criteria included ( 1 ) studies that were published in english ; ( 2 ) patients were diagnosed with agc ; ( 3 ) studies that evaluated at least one of the three primary outcomes ; ( 4 ) studies that compared taxane - based therapy with other agent - based therapies as chemotherapy regimens ; ( 5 ) studies that evaluated first - line chemotherapeutic agents ; and ( 6 ) in cases of duplicates , the most recent and higher - quality study was included .
we excluded case reports , review articles , and letters .
the studies were excluded in cases in which none of the outcomes ( os , pfs , orr , or safety ) were provided or could not be calculated , and in cases in which the classification of the chemotherapeutic agents was not provided .
two reviewers ( jinxin shi and peng gao ) evaluated the studies independently .
the prisma 2009 checklist was used as a guideline for reporting the findings for included studies48 .
quality assessment the quality of the articles were assessed by two researchers independently using the cochrane risk of bias tool for rcts and nos scale for nrcts49 .
the quality of the evidence used for calculating os , pfs and orr was also evaluated using gradepro software .
statistical analysis the meta - analysis was performed using review manager software version 5.2 ( cochrane collaboration ) .
the hazard ratios ( hrs ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % cis ) of os and pfs were calculated using the log hr and standard error in review manager software version 5.2 ( cochrane collaboration ) following the method of tierney50 .
orr and safety were analyzed by calculating the risk ratio ( rr ) .
the random - effects model was selected prior to analysis because it provides more conservative estimates and is tailored to multicenter studies in which heterogeneity is usually present51 .
the p - values less than 0.05 were considered significant .
the begg 's and egger 's tests were performed using stata software version 12.0 .

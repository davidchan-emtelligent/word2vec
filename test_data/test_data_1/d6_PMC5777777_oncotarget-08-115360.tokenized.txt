in this study , we investigated if gefitinib , an epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) inhibitor , augments endometrial cancer ( ec ) therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( mpa ) .
combined treatment with gefitinib plus mpa decreased the proliferation and invasiveness of the ishikawa and rl952 ec cell lines more effectively than mpa treatment alone .
moreover , combined treatment with gefitinib plus mpa reduced growth of ec xenografts in balb / c nude mice more than either gefitinib or mpa alone .
the therapeutic efficacy of combined gefitinib plus mpa treatment was dependent on expression of dual - specificity phosphatase 1 ( dusp1 ) .
dusp1 knockdown in ishikawa cells treated with gefitinib plus mpa showed greater proliferation and invasiveness than parental ishikawa cells treated similarly .
ec cells treated with the combination of gefitinib plus mpa also showed dusp1 - dependent reductions in phospho - erk1 / 2 and increases in e - cadherin .
thus , gefitinib appears to dusp1 - dependently enhance the therapeutic efficacy of progestin in ec cells .
endometrial cancer gefitinib mpa dusp1 targeted therapy introduction endometrial cancer ( ec ) is the most frequently diagnosed gynecological malignancy worldwide , with more than 100,000 newly diagnosed ec cases reported in china and united states annually [ 1 - 3 ] .
about 3 - 5 % of women diagnosed with ec are < 40 years of age , and 70 % of these women are nulliparous [ 4 ] .
the 5 - year survival rate of early - stage ec patients is 91 % [ 5 ] , but , it decreases to 20 - 50 % in ec patients with advanced and metastatic disease [ 6 ] .
the current first - line therapy for advanced and metastatic ec patients is a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel , which has a response rate of about 40 - 50 % in chemotherapy - naive patients and is accompanied with severe adverse effects [ 7 - 10 ] .
therefore , there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic options for nulliparous and advanced ec patients that are effective and without adverse effects .
progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate ( mpa ) and megestrol acetate ( ma ) have been used for hormonal therapy in ec since 1970s to induce differentiation in normal glandular endometrial epithelium [ 11 ] .
advanced ec patients treated with tamoxifen and alternating weekly cycles of mpa show a median progression - free survival ( pfs ) of 3 months and median overall survival ( os ) of 13 months [ 12 ] .
these data demonstrate the potential of combined tamoxifen plus mpa therapy for patients with advanced or recurrent ec , regardless of tumor grade or hormone receptor status .
progestins are also used in hormonal treatment for young ec patients to preserve fertility [ 13 ] .
however , progestin therapy is limited because 30 % of ec patients exhibit resistance to hormonal therapy [ 14 ] .
furthermore , overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) is associated with progestin resistance and poor prognosis of advanced stage ec patients [ 15 ] .
gefitinib is a potent , specific inhibitor of the egfr pathway that binds to the atp binding site in the egfr tyrosine kinase domain with a greater affinity than atp , thereby suppressing ec progression [ 16 ] .
in our previous study , we showed that dual - specificity phosphatase 1 ( dusp1 ) expression was a negative prognostic indicator in ec [ 17 ] .
moreover , dusp1 deficiency induces ec progression by activating the mapk / erk signaling pathway [ 18 ] .
in ec patients receiving progestin therapy , dusp1 overexpression correlates with better prognosis [ 17 , 18 ] .
high dusp1 expression is also inversely correlated with jnk activity in breast cancer [ 19 ] .
in hepatocellular carcinoma , high dusp1 expression correlates with better prognosis [ 20 ] .
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma , dusp1 enhances anti - tumor effects of gemcitabine by promoting apoptosis and suppressing tumor growth and angiogenesis [ 21 ] .
many studies have shown that mpa is a key inhibitor of ec progression [ 11 ] .
mpa treatment induces dusp1 overexpression , which decreases tumor progression in ec [ 18 ] .
however , the effects of gefitinib on dusp1 expression in mpa - based ec therapy have not been studied .
therefore , we investigated if gefitinib augmented mpa - based ec therapy via dusp1 .
results gefitinib augments anti - tumor effects of mpa in ec cells we performed cck - 8 assay to evaluate proliferation of ishikawa , rl952 and hec1a cell lines that were treated with different doses ( 0 , 0.05 , 0.5 , 5 , 10 and 20mum gefitinib ; 0 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 20mum mpa ) of gefitinib and mpa for 24 h. we observed a dose - dependent decrease in proliferation of ishikawa and rl952 cells treated with gefitinib and mpa , whereas hec1a cell proliferation was inhibited by very high dose ( 20mum ) of gefitinib or mpa ( figure 1a - 1b ) .
furthermore , ishikawa and rl952 cell growth was inhibited by 5mum and 10 mum gefitinib , whereas 10 mum mpa decreased growth of ishikawa and rl952 cells ( figure 1a - 1b ) .
therefore , for further experiments , we selected 5mum and 10 mum gefitinib as well as 10 mum mpa doses to treat ishikawa and rl952 cells .
hec1a cell line was excluded from further experiments because it was resistant to low doses of the two drugs .
figure 1 combined gefitinib and mpa treatment decreases proliferation and migration of ec cell lines ( a - b ) cck - 8 assay shows proliferation of ishikawa , rl952 and hec1a endometrial cancer cells treated with different doses ( 0 , 0.05 , 0.5 , 5 , 10 and 20mum gefitinib ; 0 , 0.01 , 0.1 , 1 , 10 and 20mum mpa ) of gefitinib or mpa for 24 h. as shown , treatment with gefitinib and mpa decreases proliferation of ec cells in a dose - dependent manner .
( c - d ) growth curve of ishikawa and rl952 cells treated with 5mum gefitinib , 10 mum gefitinib , 10mum mpa or 10mum mpa plus 5 mum or 10mum gefitinib for four days .
cck - 8 assay was performed on all the 4 days at 490 nm. y - axis indicates the percentage of cell growth relative to dmso - treated ec cells .
( e - f ) histogram plots show transwell migration rates of ishikawa cells treated with 10mum gefitinib , 10mum mpa or 10mum mpa plus 10mum gefitinib for 24h .
( g - h ) histogram plots show transwell migration rates of ishikawa cells treated with 5 mum gefitinib , 10mum mpa or 10mum mpa plus 5 mum gefitinib for 24h .
note : in 1e - h , graph represents average number of cells determined in five high power fields ( x 200 ) for each condition in duplicate .
error bars represent standard deviation from triplicate experiments .
since egfr signaling could involve in progestin - resistance of ec [ 22 ] , we evaluated growth of ishikawa and rl952 cells treated with 5mum gefitinib plus 10 mum mpa or 10 mum gefitinib plus 10 mum mpa for four days .
combined treatment of gefitinib and mpa was more effective in inhibiting growth of ec cells than gefitinib or mpa treatments alone ( figure 1c - 1d ) .
next , we examined the effect of combined gefitinib and mpa treatment on invasiveness of ec cells by performing transwell migration assay .
we observed that combined treatment of 10 mum mpa with 5mum or 10mum gefitinib decreased migration of ishikawa and rl952 cell lines than mpa or gefitinib treatments alone ( figure 1e - 1h ) .
together , these results demonstrate that gefitinib enhances the suppression of growth and migration of ec cells of mpa .
gefitinib promotes mpa - mediated inhibition of ec xenograft tumors in nude mice next , we examined if gefitinib enhances the anti - tumor activity of mpa in vivo by subcutaneously xenografting ishikawa cells into nude mice and treating them with intraperitoneal injections of dmso or mpa with or without gefitinib for 3 weeks .
after 3 weeks , we observed that combined treatment of mpa and gefitinib decreased tumor volume more effectively than mpa or gefitinib treatments alone ( figure 2a - 2c ) .
moreover , there was no significant loss of body weight or other symptoms of toxicity in nude mice treated with mpa and gefitinib .
these results demonstrate that gefitinib enhances anti - tumor effects of mpa in vivo .

dusp1 knockdown blocks therapeutic effects of combined gefitinib and mpa treatment in ec cells in our previous study , we demonstrated that mpa treatment upregulated dusp1 , which subsequently decreased ec progression by dephosphorylating erk1 / 2 [ 18 ] .
therefore , we investigated the role of dusp1 in the combined gefitinib and mpa treatment of ec cells .
we established two stable dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cell lines by transfecting plvx vector with two dusp1 shrnas , sh - dusp1 - 1 # and sh - dusp1 - 2 # ( figure 3a ) .
cck - 8 assay showed that dusp1 knockdown partly decreased the inhibition of growth and migration inhibition effects of gefitinib and mpa combination from day 2 onwards ( figure 3b - 3c ) .
the partial response could be either due to partial down regulation of dusp1 in knockdown cells or because dusp1 pathway was part of multiple pathways involved in the anti - tumor effects of gefitinib and mpa treatment .
in spite of the partial effect , our study indicates that dusp1 plays an important role in the anti - tumor effects of gefitinib and mpa treatment combination .
figure 3 dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cells are resistant to therapeutic effects of combined gefitinib and mpa treatment ( a ) representative western blot shows dusp1 levels in ishikawa cells transfected with shrnas 1 # and 2 # against dusp1 and negative control shrna .
as shown , dusp1 levels are significantly decreased in ishikawa cells transfected by shrnas 1 # and 2 # against dusp1 than in ishikawa cells transfected with negative control shrna .
( b ) representative image ( x 200 ) shows viability of control and dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cells treated with 10mum mpa or 10mum gefitinib plus 10mum mpa and stained with crystal violet on day 2 .
( c ) histogram plot shows relative percentage of control and dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cells treated with 10mum mpa , 10mum gefitinib plus 10mum mpa or dmso between 1 - 5 days .
data are representative of triplicate experiments .
dusp1 mediates effects of combined gefitinib and mpa treatment in ec cells we further investigated the role of dusp1 in the anti - tumor effects of combined gefitinib and mpa treatment .
as previously shown [ 18 ] , we observed dusp1 induction upon mpa treatment of ec cells ( figure 4a - 4d ) .
but , gefitinib treatment had no effect on dusp1 protein levels after 24 h ( figure 4a - 4d ) .
however , dusp1 protein levels increased in both ishikawa and rl952 cells treated with a combination of gefitinib and mpa than mpa alone ( figure 4b and 4d ) .
these results indicated that gefitinib further upregulated dusp1 and therefore enhanced the anti - tumor effects of mpa in ec cells .
figure 4 gefitinib enhances mpa - mediated suppression of ec cells via dusp1 ( a - d ) representative western blots show dusp1 ( a , c ) and beta - actin ( b , d ) levels in ishikawa and rl952 cells treated with 5mum gefitinib , 10mum gefitinib , 10mum mpa , 10mum mpa plus 5mum gefitinib or 10mum mpa plus 10mum gefitinib for 24 h .
( e ) representative western blots show dusp1 , p - erk1 / 2 , e - cadherin and beta - actinlevels in parental and dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cells treated with 10 mum gefitinib , 10mum mpa or 10mum mpa plus 10 mum gefitinib for 24 h .
( f - g ) histogram plots show p - erk1 / 2 and e - cadherin expression levels relative to beta - actin in parental and dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cells treated with 10 mum gefitinib , 10mum mpa or 10mum mpa plus 10 mum gefitinib for 24 h. error bars represent the standard deviation ( n = 3 ) .
dusp1 is activated by phosphorylation on two serine residues , ser359 and ser364 by erk1 / 2 in human embryonic kidney ( hek ) 293 cells ; on the other hand , dusp1 inactivates erk1 / 2 by dephosphorylation in human bladder cancer ht1197 cells [ 23 - 25 ] .
in our previous study , shrna - mediated knockdown of dusp1 increased p - erk1 / 2 levels , which correlated with increased proliferation of ec cells .
therefore , we investigated the status of p - erk1 / 2 in the combined gefitinib and mpa treatment of dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cell lines and their corresponding controls .
as shown in figure 4e and figure 4f , ishikawa cells treated with a combination of gefitinib and mpa showed lower p - erk1 / 2 levels than in mpa - treated parental ishikawa cells ( with dusp1 expression ) .
however , dusp1 knockdown abolished the effects of the combined treatment and showed elevated phospho - erk1 / 2 levels ( figure 4f ) .
we further demonstrated increased e - cadherin levels in ishikawa cells treated with combination of gefitinib and mpa than in ec cells treated with mpa alone ( figure 4e - 4g ) .
however , dusp1 knockdown ishikawa cells treated with a combination of gefitinib and mpa showed low e - cadherin levels ( figure 4e , 4g ) .
these results suggested that gefitinib boosted e - cadherin upregulation by mpa through dusp1 , which correlated with inhibition of ec cell migration .
these data suggest that dusp1 mediates enhanced sensitivity of ec cells to combined treatment of gefitinib and mpa .
as shown in figure 5 , gefitinib enhances dusp1 upregulation by mpa .
in turn , dusp1 inhibits phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 and enhances e - cadherin expression .
these changes result in decreased proliferation and migration of ec cells .
therefore , gefitinib enhances the sensitivity of ec cells to mpa by enhancing dusp1 upregulation .
figure 5 schematic diagram illustrates mechanism of gefitinib - mediated progestin therapy discussion mpa and gefitinib are effective drugs in breast and endometrial cancer therapy [ 12 , 26 ] .
moreover , gefitinib is an effective drug in therapy for prostate , gastric , colorectal and non - small cell lung cancers [ 27 - 30 ] .
our data demonstrates that gefitinib enhances anti - tumor properties of mpa via dusp1 in ec cells , both in - vitro and in - vivo .
gefitinib enhances the inhibition of p - erk1 / 2 and upregulation of e - cadherin by mpa , resulting in decreased proliferation and migration , respectively .
combined gefitinib and mpa treatment also inhibits in vivo growth of ec xenografts in nude mice .
moreover , the anti - tumor effects of combined gefitinib and mpa treatment are mediated by dusp1 .
the mechanism of progestin therapy in ec involves ( 1 ) progesterone binding to the progesterone receptor ( pr ) , which switches its conformation , dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus where it binds specific pr response elements in target genes and initiates gene expression in collaboration with various other transcription factors ; and ( 2 ) progestins suppress mapk and pi3k / akt signaling pathways , there by inhibiting cell differentiation and growth [ 31 , 32 ] .
gefitinib is an egfr - tki inhibitor , which inhibits ras / raf / mapk , erk1 , erk2 and pi3k / akt signal transduction pathways that are involved in the regulation of cell growth , migration , adhesion , angiogenesis and apoptosis [ 33 ] .
hyperactivation of pi3k / akt and mapk / erk pathways by phosphorylation are central to growth and progression of various solid tumors .
phosphorylated akt dissociates from plasma membrane receptors and migrates to the cytoplasm and the nucleus , thereby regulating cell proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis by phosphorylating downstream targets such as gsk - 3 , e2f , cdk , fkhr , bad and caspase - 9 [ 34 , 35 ] .
mapk / erk pathway regulates cancer cell growth , differentiation and survival by phosphorylating downstream substrates such as elk - 1 , c - myc , c - fos , c - jun , atf , nf - kappab and ap - 1 [ 36 - 38 ] .
e - cadherin is a key indicator of the degree of epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( emt ) , which determines tumor invasion and metastasis [ 39 ] .
dusp1 is a member of the family of double specificity phosphatases , which phosphorylate tyrosine and threonine residues in map kinases to inhibit cell growth , differentiation and apoptosis [ 35 ] .
in pancreatic cancer , dusp1 decreases tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting the mapk / erk pathway [ 36 ] .
high expression of dusp1 is an independent risk factor that determines prognosis of early lung cancer patients [ 40 ] .
high expression of dusp1 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cells [ 38 ] .
in our previous study , dusp1 deficiency promotes ec progression via the mapk / erk pathway [ 18 ] .
tumor progression via emt correlates with activities and interactions of wnt / tgfbeta , hedgehog , pi3k / akt and mapk signaling pathways [ 41 ] .
in this study , we demonstrate that high dusp1 expression correlates with ec cell migration and e - cadherin expression .
this suggests that dusp1 / e - cadherin signaling axis regulates emt .
in conclusion , our results show that gefitinib augments progestin therapy sensitivity in ec cells by enhancing dusp1 levels .
further pre - clinical and clinical trials are needed to validate the potential of combination of gefitinib and mpa for ec treatment .

dear editor , we read with great interest the recently published article by tapper et al .
[ 1 ] .
in this study , the authors' intention was to describe the clinical predictors of advanced histology in a tertiary referral centre population , and to describe the rate of advanced histology in patients with ' normal ' ultrasound findings in a cohort of liver - biopsy - proven , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) or non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) patients .
in conclusion , aspartate aminotransferase - to - platelet ratio ( apri ) greater than 1.0 was found to be the most significant predictor of advanced fibrosis .
additionally , 20 % and 16.7 % of patients without ultrasound - detected steatosis had advanced fibrosis and active nash , respectively .
in accordance with these findings , the authors suggested that patients with suspected nafld should routinely be evaluated for advanced liver disease , including non - invasive indices of fibrosis such as apri , and that serious consideration should be given to liver biopsy .
however , we would like to share our thoughts and contributions to the original study .
first , although liver biopsy is still accepted as the ' gold standard ' method in diagnosis and follow - up of patients with advanced fibrosis , many studies have been performed on indirect , non - invasive , serum biochemical markers that can be used in place of liver biopsy because of its serious complications .
apri , forns index , fib - 4 , ast - to - alt ratio , age - to - platelet index , hepascore , fibrotest , fibroindex , fibrometer and nash fibrosis scores are the most commonly used of these tests .
among these tests , apri and fibrotest have the highest diagnostic accuracy for liver fibrosis ( aucs are 0.94 and 0.97 , respectively ) , therefore , following diagnosis by ultrasound , assessment of liver fibrosis in patients with nafld will reduce the risk of performing unnecessary biopsy .
second , cut - off values of 1.5 and 2.0 were usually used for apri , to predict significant fibrosis and cirrhosis , respectively .
in the original study , 1.0 has been accepted as predicting both significant and advanced fibrosis .
according to previous studies , 1.5 should be selected for significant liver fibrosis , and a cut - off point of more than 1.5 and less than 2.0 should be selected for advanced fibrosis [ 2 ] .
sensitivity of the 1.0 cut - off point was very low : only about 30 % .
therefore , the selected cut - off point for apri should be more than 1.0 to increase the sensitivity and negative predictive value .
in conclusion , due to probable liver fibrosis , patients with nafld should initially be evaluated using non - invasive liver fibrosis indices , adopting the previously established cut - off points .
conflict of interest : none declared .

introduction marine natural products are a source of promising molecules for cancer treatment .
however , there is a need to improve the evaluation of their mechanism of action in tumors .
metabolomics is one of the latest technologies for global and fast phenotyping of gene expression or response to drugs or nutrients , with the potential of metabolic biomarker or pathway discovery [ 1,2,3,4 ] .
well recognized tools for metabolomics are nmr spectroscopy which is limited in sensitivity but shows high metabolite specificity and remarkable versatility of acquisition conditions , and gas or liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry which exhibits much better sensitivity , but displays selectivity of analysis and requires systematic material extraction .
among nmr spectroscopy techniques , the high resolution magic angle spinning ( hrmas ) technology is especially suited to acquisition in intact cells , thus avoiding extraction procedures , and issues of metabolite selectivity .
also , it provides metabolic phenotyping as close as possible to the real biochemical cell content .
quantification is necessary to ensure reproducibility of findings , proper biomarker identification , or steady state concentration - based data processing .
we used 2d hrmas proton nmr spectroscopy - based metabolite profiling [ 3,5 ] to get insights into the mechanisms of the response of mcf7 breast cancer cells to ascididemin ( asc ) , a marine alkaloid extracted from the mediterranean ascidian cystodytes dellechiajei .
asc acts as a topoisomerase ii inhibitor , and exerts strong anti - proliferative effects in several tumor cell lines including mcf7 breast adenocarcinoma cells , through induction of caspase - dependent apoptosis [ 6,7 ]. by itself , this highly toxic alkaloid has no value as an anti - cancer agent but is considered as the lead of a family of anti - cancer drug candidates [ 8 ] .
after exposure to asc , mechanisms leading to cell death involve reactive oxygen species ( ros ) release due to reduction of asc iminoquinone moiety and dna break formation [ 8 ] , followed by oxidative stress - dependent apoptosis through jnk - dependent activation of caspase - 2 [ 9 ] .
we found that early ( 6 - 24 h ) response of mcf7 breast cancer cells to asc involved alterations of glycolysis , tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle , amino acid and phospholipid metabolism , and accumulation of gluconic acid ( gna ) .
the latter could be explained by glucose dehydrogenation , probably as a means to respond to oxidative stress .
candidate metabolic biomarkers of the response of breast cancer cells to asc were proposed including citrate , gna , polyunsaturated fatty acids which levels increase , and glycerophospho - choline and - ethanolamine which levels decrease .
in addition , from steady - state concentration - based data analysis , evidence was given of metabolic pathways being altered in response to asc that can be related to oxidative stress and anti - inflammatory responses .
2. results and discussion 2.1 .
global response of mcf7 cells to asc treatment of mcf7 breast cancer cells with asc yielded marked cell death at 48 h with 65 % +/ - 5.8 % ( p < 0.01 ) apoptotic cells ( figure 1a ) .
the count of apoptotic cells was 7 % +/ - 4 % ( p = ns ) and 22 % +/ - 7 % ( p < 0.01 ) at 6 h and 24 h , respectively , indicating that critical metabolic events took place before 24 h. in comet assays , tail dna increased in mcf7 cells exposed to asc at 24 h ( x31 , p < 0.01 ) ( figure 1b ) .

2.2 .
nmr spectrum analysis of asc - treated mcf7 cells a strong signal of cit was visible in 1d nmr spectra at exactly 6 h after the onset of treatment .
the cit level increased between 6 h and 24 h. other obvious metabolite variations involved increase of alanine ( ala , methyl signal at 1.47 ppm ) and phosphoethanolamine ( pe , methylene signal at 4.00 ppm ). between 24 h and 48 h , spectra of treated cells were completely upset , testifying the execution of apoptosis .
at 48 h , most small metabolite signals had disappeared from spectra only leaving macromolecular and lipid signals , of which that of phosphatidylcholine ( ptc ) ( figure 2a ) .
analysis of the 3.50 x 4.20 ppm spectral domain of the asc - treated group showed unusual signals at 4.12 , 4.02 , 3.83 , 3.82 , 3.76 and 3.66 ppm in 1d nmr spectra .
furthermore , 2d nmr spectra revealed strong correlations at 4.02 x 4.12 ppm , 3.76 x 4.12 ppm , 3.76 x 4.02 ppm , 3.66 x 3.76 ppm , and 3.83 x 3.66 ppm .
a less intense correlation was observed at 3.66 x 4.02 ppm .
the interrogation of the bmrb ( www.bmrb.wisc.edu [ 10 ]) and hmdb ( www.hmdb.ca [ 11 ]) spectral databases revealed that the unknown signals corresponded to gluconate ( gna ) [ 12 ] ( figure 2b ) .
to get some more information on the transition to apoptosis , the culture medium was analyzed using the same nmr sequences .
at 48 h , it revealed , in the asc - treated group , decreased lactate ( lac ) level , providing evidence of downregulation of glycolysis , together with pyruvate consumption from the medium and increased acetate ( ace ) release by the cells , testifying mitochondrial deficiency ( figure 2c ) .

2.3 .
metabolomics of asc - treated mcf7 cells as a preliminary step of the metabolomics method , which requires protein nmr signal identification , 13 2d nmr signals of proteins were assigned in 1h - nmr spectra of protein extracts of mcf7 breast cancer cells , untreated or exposed to asc ( figure 3a ) .
they were quantified using their cross - peak volume ( cpv ) , and autoscaled .
only a small , not statistically significant , difference ( 6 % of average protein signal ) was found between 2d nmr spectroscopy protein signals of the untreated and asc - treated groups .
for comparison , the same calculations were performed on 2d nmr spectra of human fibroblast protein extracts ( n = 3 ) and commercially - available histones and albumin .
treatment with asc did not altered protein content , which established the full applicability of the used metabolomics method [ 6 ] .
also , the protein composition of human fibroblasts varied lowly in comparison with that of mcf7 breast cancer cells .
only pure protein standards differed in amino - acid composition ( figure 3b ) .
identified and quantified metabolites were gathered into five metabolite subsets ( table 1 ) : glycolysis / tca cycle / lipid metabolism derivatives ( glc , lac , ace , puf , cit , myi , gna ) , glu derivatives ( glu , gln , pro , ala , asn , asp , naa , arg ) , met and transsulfuration derivatives ( met , ply hcy , tcr , gsx , hta , tau ) , other amino acids ( gly , lys , phe , thr ) , and phospholipid metabolism derivatives ( pe , gpe , cho , pc , cdpc , ptc , gpc ) .
as an unsupervised multivariate statistical description of metabolite alterations induced by asc , we used hierarchical clustering of the whole set of data ( figure 3c ) .
the analysis discriminated the response to asc .
metabolites accumulating in response to asc were cit , gna , and phospholipid derivatives ( cho , cdpc , pe ) , while decreasing metabolites were other phospholipid derivatives ( gpe , gpc , ptc ) and transulfuration pathway derivatives ( hcy , hta , tau ) .
then , we calculated average metabolite variations in response to asc .
the largest three changes corresponded to the accumulation of puf ( x4.6 , p < 0.01 , n = 8 untreated vs. n = 8 asc - treated cell pellets ) , cit ( x16.8 , p < 0.001 ) , and gna ( x10.2 , p < 0.001 ) ( figure 4a ) .
glycolysis alterations were observed with decrease of glc ( - 75 % +/ - 22 % , p < 0.05 , one - tailed test ) , and moderate decrease of lac ( - 21 % +/ - 14 %) .
significant alterations occurred in the glu derivative group with increase of gln (+ 150 % +/ - 56 % , p < 0.05 ) and ala (+ 128 % +/ - 42 % , p < 0.05 ) , and severe decrease of asp ( - 92 % +/ - 7 % , p < 0.01 ) .
the met derivative subset was strongly altered with decrease of hcy ( - 58 % +/ - 12 % , p < 0.05 , one - tailed test ) , hta ( - 85 % +/ - 6 % , p < 0.001 ) , and tau ( - 29 % +/ - 8 % , p < 0.05 ) , and moderate decrease of gsx ( - 13 % +/ - 8 %) .
the phospholipid metabolism subset was strongly modified with increase of pe (+ 145 % +/ - 59 % , p < 0.01 ) , cho (+ 41 % +/ - 11 % , p < 0.01 ) and cdpc (+ 82 % +/ - 37 % , p < 0.05 ) , decrease of gpe ( - 36 % +/ - 6 % , p < 0.001 ) and gpc ( - 57 % +/ - 7 % , p < 0.001 ) , and mild variation of ptc ( - 11 % +/ - 10 %) .
despite the limited number of samples at 6 h and 24 h , we sought for time - varying response to asc .
cit and gna increased between 6 and 24 h , and puf decreased , but these variations did not reach statistical significance ( figure 4b ) .
however , significant variations were observed for other metabolites between 6 and 24 h : ply (+ 211 % , p < 0.05 , n = 4 at 6 h vs. n = 4 at 24 h , in the asc - treated group ) , met ( - 132 % , p < 0.05 , one - tailed test ) , glu (+ 87 % , p < 0.05 ) , gsx ( - 32 % , p < 0.05 , one - tailed test ) , hcy ( - 25 % , p < 0.01 ) , pro ( - 87 % , p < 0.01 ) , asn ( - 22 % , p < 0.05 ) , gpe ( - 25 % , p < 0.05 , one - tailed test ) , ptc ( - 48 % , p < 0.05 , one - tailed test ) , and gpc ( - 49 % , p < 0.05 ) .

at 6 h , most biochemical processes associated to oxidative stress and cellular defense were initiated .

c6 and c24 , untreated at 6 h and 24 h ; a6 and a24 , asc - treated at 6 h and 24 h. for metabolite abbreviations , see table 1 .
principal component analysis was used to condense information carried by data .
the first axis ( f1 ) , accounting for 30 % of total information and separating asc from control samples , opposed the set of gna , cit , and puf to the set of gpe , hta , and gpc , all candidate biomarkers of the response to asc ( figure 4c,d ) .
high levels of gna , cit and puf and low levels of gpe , hta and gpc characterized asc - treated cells , even more after 24 h than 6 h treatment .
there was a trend for an opposing variation between glu and asp along the f1 axis .
the second axis ( f2 ) accounted for 17 % of total information , and was explained by opposed variations of myi and hcy on one side , and ace , pc and gsx on other side .
the rank correlation matrix was calculated to highlight short - and long - range co - variations between metabolites of slow turn - over or blocked at rate - limiting enzymes ( figure 5a ) .
correlations that implicated gna , cit and puf - - the three biomarkers of oxidative stress - - revealed long - range metabolic relationships .
unsurprisingly , gna strongly correlated with cit ( r = + 0.88 , p < 0.01 ) .
actually , cit is an allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase ( pfk ) , a well - known regulatory process used by the cell to enhance nadph production .
gna , the witness of a novel source for nad ( p ) h production , correlated negatively with transsulfuration derivatives of which gsx , the main cellular nadph consumer .
gpc and gpe correlated negatively with cit and gna , and positively with metabolites with an antioxidant role ( hta , gsx ) .
taken together , metabolite variations testified severe alteration of glycolysis , tca cycle , glu and phospholipid metabolism , and redox - sensitive transsulfuration .
changes in hcy and gsx were suggestive of the enrolment of transsulfuration in glutathione biosynthesis , and upregulation of cystathionine - beta - synthase ( cbs ) in asc - treated cells .
opposing variations in glu and asp may suggest downregulation of aspartate aminotransferase ( aat ) .
puf accumulation may be related to downregulation of cyclooxygenase - 2 ( cox - 2 ) , which is a component of anti - inflammatory response .
phospholipase a2 ( pla2 ) activity has been shown to correlate with gpc and gpe release [ 13 ] , and the decrease of gpc and gpe , in this study , could be the consequence of anti - inflammatory response which downregulates cox - 2 and pla2 [ 14 ] .

other abbreviations , see table 1 .
cho and cdpc accumulation suggests inhibition of choline - kinase and inhibition of cdp - choline : 1,2 - diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase ( cpt ) .
accumulation of cit indicates blockade of mitochondrial / cytosolic aconitase in response to asc , most likely through ros oxidation of [ 4fe - 4s ] 2 + center [ 15 ] .
this mechanism would explain cit diffusion out of mitochondria , and accumulation into the cytosol .
cytosolic cit is a well - known allosteric inhibitor of pfk [ 16 ] , thus downregulating glycolysis , and upregulating nadph - producing pathways .
alternatively , cit may become a source of nadph through conversion into malate and activity of malic enzyme .
gna accumulation could result from either glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( g6pd ) rate - limitation or hexokinase ( hk ) blockade .
among glucose - 6 - phosphate - regulated hexokinases , hk - ii is mostly bound to the mitochondrial membrane , and its inhibition detaches it from the mitochondrial membrane , yielding loss of mitochondrial potential and apoptosis [ 17 ] .
gna was reported to be increased in fibroblast lines transfected with cancer - causing genes [ 18 ] .
however , it is the first time that gna is reported to be implicated in human tumor cell response to a pro - oxidant agent .
a summary of the response to severe oxidative stress as derived from the present metabolomics study is given in figure 5b .
it is centered on the balance between nadph production and consumption , and depicts the metabolic counterpart of ros production and scavenging .
although the molecular chemistry of ros deserves extensive work , little is known about central metabolism alterations associated to severe oxidative stress .
it was recently shown that ros production could be evaluated through the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway [ 19 ] .
however , to the best of our knowledge , little or no research has reported the metabolic counterpart of ros production and scavenging .

this resulted in 2:50 min acquisition duration .
after fourier transformation , a baseline correction was applied using a spline function .
one - dimensional nmr spectra were processed using deconvolution procedures ( topspin 1.3 software , bruker biospin ) .
after the 1d acquisition , a two - dimensional ( 2d ) nmr spectrum was immediately recorded using a total correlation spectroscopy ( tocsy ) sequence involving water signal suppression at low power , 6 - ppm spectral bandwidth along both frequency axes , 256 samples along the first axis , and 2000 samples along the second axis , 75 - ms mixing time during which was applied the spin - lock pulse train ( dipsi - 2 ) , 1 - s relaxation delay , and 16 repetitions .
the 2d nmr spectrum duration was 1:41 h. tocsy spectra were first reconstructed both at high resolution ( 2000 x 256 ) , and referenced to tps for assignments .
then , they were reconstructed at lower resolution ( 256 x 256 ) for quantification .
baseline correction was applied using a second order polynomial .
the latter spectra were transferred on an excel worksheet ( microsoft co. ) and processed using a homebuilt routine designed to automatically compute spectral cross - peak volumes ( cpvs ) according to the developed quantitative method .
metabolites cross - peak signals normalized to protein cpvs , thus provided a metabolite measurement proportional to a concentration , according to the procedure of reference [ 6 ] .
3.7 .
statistical analysis comparison between treated and control metabolite measurements was done using the nonparametric mann - whitney test .
the full set of data ( table of n = 8 independent control and n = 8 independent treated samples , and n = 33 metabolites ) was processed using multivariate statistical analysis .
briefly , hierarchical clustering aims at identifying , among all individuals ( samples ) and metabolites , clusters of individuals and metabolites who behave similarly .
principal component analysis aims at condensing information contained in data .
it provides a small number of factors ( most often 2 ) , new variables and linear combinations of metabolites that explain the largest part of information contained by data ( the percentage of explained information is given with each factor ) .
it highlights the most informative metabolic trends within the whole set of data .
the strength of the correlation of individual metabolites with factors is the assigning of a metabolic / biochemical meaning to the factors , and is given by the loading plot .
individual samples projected onto the factors ( individual plot ) may clusterize into clouds with functional meaning .
hierarchical clustering of data used the rank correlation ( spearman coefficient ) as the distance criterion , and mean linkage as the clustering criterion principal component analysis used the rank correlation of data ( as a preferred alternative to the pearson correlation , given the non - gaussian structure of data ) , correlation between metabolites used the spearman 's nonparametric rank correlation .
statistical tests were two - tailed unless specified .
univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed using the xlstat 7.5 software ( addinsoft ) .
4. conclusions two - dimensional hrmas proton nmr spectrum - based metabolomics was successfully applied to evaluate the response of mcf7 breast cancer cells to asc .
candidate metabolic biomarkers of the response to asc involved citrate , gluconate and polyunsaturated fatty acids which levels increase , and glycerophospho - choline and - ethanolamine which levels decrease .
in addition , evidence was given of candidate metabolic targets including aconitase and glycolysis .
finally , central metabolism alterations after exposure of breast cancer cells to asc were shown to depict the metabolic counterpart of severe oxidative stress and anti - inflammatory responses .

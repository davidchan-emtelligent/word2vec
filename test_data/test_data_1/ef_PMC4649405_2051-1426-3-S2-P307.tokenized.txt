cancer immunotherapy has entered the era of maturity with new compounds like anti - pd - 1 fda approved to treat advanced tumors .
however , the use of immunotherapy in the setting of chemotherapy presents challenges , as chemotherapy causes lymphodepletion and potentially antagonizes immunotherapy .
in this work , we studied ways to optimize the delivery of chemotherapy in the setting of immunotherapy .
methods using the gl - 261 mouse glioblastoma model , we carried out a series of survival , immunophenotypic and mechanistic experiments to identify the optimal timing and delivery method of chemotherapy ( bcnu , temozolomide ) in relation to immunotherapy ( anti - pd - 1 ) .
results local chemotherapy ( lc ) in the form of chemotherapy eluted polymer combined with anti - pd - 1 monoclonal antibody led to superior survival and tumor eradication compared to monotherapies and the combination of anti - pd - 1 with systemic chemotherapy .
the use of systemic chemotherapy abrogated the survival benefit anti - pd - 1 produced as a monotherapy in a dose dependent manner .
furthermore , systemic chemotherapy caused lymphopenia and decreased t cell effector function in a dose dependent fashion , while the combination of lc and anti - pd - 1 resulted in the highest immune activation .
lc increased the infiltration of dendritic cells intratumorally .
utilizing the antigen specific ova system we showed that lc allowed for expansion of antigen specific t cells while systemic chemotherapy thwarted the homing and expansion of these cells .
we additionally found that systemic chemotherapy abrogated the creation of long - term memory that anti - pd - 1 alone created .
mice treated with anti - pd - 1 and systemic chemotherapy and rechallenged with gl - 261 tumors failed to reject the tumor due to the persistent lymphodepletion caused by systemic chemotherapy as well as functional impairment of t memory cells .
however , lc in combination with anti - pd1 preserved a long - term memory response .
we further studied the long - term effects of sc in immunotherapy ; mice treated with sc for 2 weeks were given an extended chemotherapy break ( 2 months ) to allow the immune system to rest and were subsequently treated with anti - pd - 1 .
surprisingly , these mice failed to show the same survival benefit anti - pd - 1 only treated mice exhibited .
conclusions lc in combination with anti - pd - 1 creates a robust antitumor immune response , increases antigen presentation and expands tumor specific t cells resulting in the cure of well established tumors in the majority of mice , while at the same time preserves a long - term memory antitumor response .

nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) is associated with caspase activation .
however , a role for pro - inflammatory caspases or inflammasomes has not been explored in diet - induced liver injury .
our aims were to examine the role of caspase - 1 in high fat - induced nash .
c57bl / 6 wild - type and caspase 1 - knockout ( casp1 - / - ) mice were placed on a 12 - week high fat diet .
wild - type mice on the high fat diet increased hepatic expression of pro - caspase - 1 and il - 1beta .
both wild - type and casp1 - / - mice on the high fat diet gained more weight than mice on a control diet .
hepatic steatosis and tg levels were increased in wild - type mice on high fat diet , but were attenuated in the absence of caspase - 1 .
plasma cholesterol and free fatty acids were elevated in wild - type , but not casp1 - / - mice , on high fat diet .
alt levels were elevated in both wild - type and casp1 - / - mice on high fat diet compared to control .
hepatic mrna expression for genes associated with lipogenesis was lower in casp1 - / - mice on high fat diet compared to wild - type mice on high fat diet , while genes associated with fatty acid oxidation were not affected by diet or genotype .
hepatic tnfalpha and mcp - 1 mrna expression was increased in wild - type mice on high fat diet , but not in casp1 - / - mice on high fat diet .
alphasma positive cells , sirius red staining , and col1alpha1 mrna were increased in wild - type mice on high fat diet compared to control .
deficiency of caspase - 1 prevented those increases .
in summary , the absence of caspase - 1 ameliorates the injurious effects of high fat diet - induced obesity on the liver .
specifically , mice deficient in caspase - 1 are protected from high fat - induced hepatic steatosis , inflammation and early fibrogenesis .
these data point to the inflammasome as an important therapeutic target for nash .

introduction consumption of high - energy diets and weight gain are associated with development of several metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis , characteristics of an early stage within the spectrum of non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( nalfd ) .
nafld is a common form of chronic liver disease , affecting both adults and children , which is strongly associated with obesity and insulin resistance [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
10 - 20 % of adults have hepatic steatosis , which is characterized by triglyceride accumulation in liver cells and follows a benign non - progressive clinical course [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) is defined as lipid accumulation with evidence of cellular damage , inflammation and early to moderate fibrosis [ 5 ] .
nash is a serious condition , as approximately 3 - 15 % of these patients progress to cirrhosis , with complications including portal hypertension , liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] .
in particular , the mechanisms responsible for liver injury and disease progression remain incompletely understood , but are of significant biomedical importance , as identification of cellular and molecular processes of nash pathogenesis may help to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for this highly prevalent and potentially serious disease .
until recently , progression from nafl to nash was modeled as a two - hit process .
the first hit is proposed to be the accumulation of lipids within hepatocytes , and considered a requirement for later events leading to liver injury [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] .
lipid accumulation occurs as a result of availability of excess free fatty acids ( fa ) coming from high - energy / high fat diets or released from adipose tissue , as well as an increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and decrease in degradation [ 11 ] .
impairment of triglyceride secretion by vldl can also contribute to hepatic steatosis in some conditions [ 12 ] .
the second hit is proposed to be a multifactorial process likely involving a combination of apoptosis and necrosis , oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation , proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production , dysregulated adipokine expression and mitochondrial dysfunction [ 13 ] .
all of these insults cumulatively contribute to the progression of nafld to nash and fibrosis .
despite this characterization of multiple contributors to disease progression , there remains a dearth of evidence to explain the molecular mechanisms of how these proposed " second hits " in diet - induced obesity result in the progression from steatosis to nash .
the inflammasome is an innate immune response that involves the formation of a multiprotein caspase - 1 - activating complex [ 14 ] .
the inflammasome complex contains cysteine - aspartate protease - 1 ( caspase - 1 ) , apoptosis - associated speck - like protein containing a card ( asc ) , and a nod - like receptor ( nod ) protein ( nlrp ) .
the inflammasome senses danger signals through intracellular nlrps .
among known inflammasomes ( nlrp1 , nlrp3 , nlrc4 , aim , and ipaf ) , nlrp3 is responsible for the activation of immune cells in response to tissue injury and cell death via monosodium urate [ 15 ] .
formation of the inflammasome complex leads to the activation of caspase - 1 , which in turn proteolytically cleaves interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and - 18 into their mature active forms [ 16 ] .
multiple lines of evidence suggest a role for the inflammasome in nash , for example , il - 1 receptor ( il - 1r ) is thought to play a role in nash since il - 1 knockout and il - 1r knockout mice are protected from methionine and choline deficient ( mcd ) diet - induced steatohepatitis [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] .
we and others have shown an increase in expression and activation of caspase - 1 in the mcd mouse model of nash [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] .
in addition , pharmacological inhibition of all caspases blocks hepatocyte apoptosis and the progression of mcd - induced fibrosis in mice , but does not improve hepatocellular injury assessed by plasma alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) , nor hepatocellular ballooning , steatosis or inflammation [ 22 ] , [ 23 ]) .
while pointing to caspases as important mediators of molecular mechanisms in nash , these data were limited to the mcd diet , which can be considered a non - pathogenic nash model .
the mcd diet induces the phenotypic changes of nash in the liver , but does not reflect the dietary etiology , pathogenesis , or disease mechanisms seen in nash patients [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .
in addition , the mcd diet causes non - characteristic features of nash , such as weight loss and wasting syndrome [ 26 ] .
high energy / high fat diets and obesity lead to a chronic state of low - grade inflammation , hyperinsulinemia , hyperglycemia and increased ros production and cell death .
we tested the hypothesis that caspase - 1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of high fat diet - induced liver injury .
in order to test this hypothesis , we exposed caspase - 1 deficient mice ( casp1 - / - ) to a high fat diet for 12 weeks .
the absence of caspase - 1 decreased hepatic steatosis .
casp1 - / - mice were protected from high fat diet - induced hepatic inflammatory cytokine expression .
in addition , absence of caspase - 1 protected mice from early stages of fibrogenesis , suggesting that caspase - 1 is necessary for an initial pro - fibrotic response during obesity - induced liver injury .
materials and methods animal studies these experimental protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the cleveland clinic .
male c57bl / 6 mice , 20 to 25 g of body weight , were purchased from jackson laboratory , bar harbor , me. caspase - 1 , caspase - 11 double knockout mice ( casp1 - / - ) on a c57bl / 6 background ( generated by dr. richard flavell from yale university , new haven , ct ) were described previously [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .

imaging of animals for body fat analysis each animal was initially anesthetized with 2 - 3 % isoflurane in oxygen .
the animals were then placed in a prone position within a bruker biospec 7t mri scanner ( bruker biospin , billerica , ma ) .
a 72 - mm diameter volume coil was used for excitation and signal detection to maximize the uniformity of the images .
after localizer scans , a relaxation compensated fat fraction ( rcff ) mri acquisition and reconstruction process was used to generate quantitative fat fraction maps for each imaging slice [ 29 ] .
briefly , three asymmetric echo spin echo mri acquisitions were acquired ( tr / te = 1500 ms / 20 ms , 17 - 25 coronal slices , resolution = 200 umx200 umx1000 um , 2 averages ) .
the three acquisitions were acquired with different echo shifts to allow separate fat and water images to be generated .
finally , a semiautomatic image analysis was performed to segment and calculate the volumes of peritoneal and subcutaneous adipose tissues , respectively .
volumes of adipose depots are expressed in ml. total adiposity is the sum of all peritoneal and subcutaneous depots and is expressed as a percent of body weight .

to begin to investigate the mechanisms for lower hepatic steatosis in the casp1 - / - mice , expression of mrna for genes associated with fatty acid synthesis , fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein metabolism were measured by rt - pcr .
expression of mrna for peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( ppargamma ) and sterol receptor element binding protein - 1c ( srebp1c ) , two key transcription factors regulating lipid synthesis , were increased with high fat feeding in wild - type mice ; this induction by high - fat feeding was reduced in casp1 - / - mice ( fig. 4a ) .
consistent with the increase in srebp1c expression , stearoyl - coa desaturase - 1 ( scd - 1 ) , a downstream target of srebp1c , was increased in wild - type mice on a high fat diet ( fig. 4a ) ; the absence of caspase - 1 attenuated this induction compared to wild type mice ( fig. 4a ) .
in contrast , while expression of mrna for acetyl co - a carboxylase - 1 ( acc1 ) was not significantly increased in wild type mice on the high fat diet ( fig. 4a ) , expression was lower in caspase1 - deficient mice .

expression of mrna of additional genes related to fatty acid oxidation pathways ( l - fabp , cpt1alpha , pgc1beta , lcad and mcad ) were not affected by either diet or genotype under the conditions of our study ( fig. 4b ) .
if casp1 - / - mice on high fat diet were protected from hepatic steatosis due to increased vldl secretion , we would expect to observe an increase in expression of genes associated with the formation and / or secretion of vldl in caspase - 1 deficient mice compared to wild type mice .
however , under the conditions of the current investigation , neither the expression of apob or mttp was increased in casp1 - / - mice on high fat diet compared to wild - type mice on high fat diet ( fig. 4c ) .

early indicators of fibrogenesis are induced by high fat diet in wild - type , but not in caspase - 1 knockout mice given the recent findings of the inflammasome and caspase - 1 in liver fibrosis [ 18 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , we evaluated the role of caspase - 1 in high fat diet - induced early fibrogenesis .
expression of the hepatic stellate cell ( hsc ) activation marker alpha - smooth muscle actin ( alphasma ) by immunohistochemistry was increased in the perisinusoidal space of the livers of wild - type mice on the high fat diet compared to control , but not in casp1 - / - mice ( fig. 6a , c ) .
sirius red staining , an indicator of extracellular matrix deposition , was greater in wild - type mice on the high fat diet compared to control diet and was present in a chicken - wire manner ( fig. 6b , d ) .
however , in the absence of caspase - 1 , a high fat diet did not induce extracellular matrix deposition over mice on the control diet ( fig. 6b and d ) .
consistent with this finding , mrna expression for collagen type 1 - alpha - 1 ( col1alpha1 ) was increased in the sinusoidal space in wild - type mice on a high fat diet ; but was not increased casp1 - / - mice ( fig. 6e ) .

discussion the progression of nafld and nash involves the development of hepatic steatosis , increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , and the eventual deposition of extracellular matrix proteins .
this process involves complex interactions between multiple cell types within the hepatic architecture .
the contribution of cells of the innate immune system and hscs are particularly critical to the progression from nafld to nash .
the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that caspase - 1 plays a role in the pathogenesis of high fat diet - induced nash .
caspase - 1 and il - 1beta expression were increased in mice on the high fat diet .
while both wild - type and casp1 - / - mice became obese on the high fat diet , casp1 - / - mice were protected from a number of the phenotypic characteristics of early nash .
for example , the high fat diet increased hepatic steatosis and expression of lipogenesis related genes in wild - type mice , but casp1 - / - mice were protected from these diet - induced phenotypes .
these data indicate that caspase - 1 directly and / or indirectly influences hepatocytes in the development of fatty liver .
further , while the high fat diet increased inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in wild - type mice , this response was attenuated in casp1 - / - mice , suggesting a role for caspase - 1 in macrophages during the progression to nash .
finally , our data also indicate that caspase - 1 plays an important role at early stages of fibrogenesis in response to high fat diets .
evidence for activation of hscs and accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins was apparent in wild - type mice after 12 weeks of high fat diet .
importantly , casp1 - / - mice had decreased fibrogenesis compared to wild - type in response to a high fat diet , suggesting either a direct and / or indirect role of caspase - 1 in the activation of hscs .
casp1 - / - mice fed a high fat diet exhibited reduced accumulation of liver triglycerides during high fat feeding , associated with greater adiposity than wild - type mice .
increased adiposity in casp1 - / - mice may contribute to their protection from diet - induced steatosis .
subcutaneous adipose , rather than visceral adipose , is increased in casp1 - / - mice on high fat diet .
this may be protective , as subcutaneous adipose is considered metabolically benign in comparison to visceral adipose tissue , which is associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome .
however , within the scope of this investigation , we cannot determine if the shift in adipose accretion to subcutaneous adipose tissue directly protects from diet - induced hepatic steatosis in caspase1 - deficient mice or whether it is merely an association .
reduced accumulation of hepatic triglycerides in the casp1 - / - mice might also be due to decreased hepatic lipogenesis , since the casp1 - / - mice expressed less mrna for genes associated with hepatic lipogenesis , ppargamma , srebp1c and its downstream targets acc1 and scd1 .
further , protection from high - fat diet - induced steatosis in caspase1 - deficient mice was not likely due to increased fatty acid oxidation , as expression of mrna for pparalpha and aox was also lower in casp1 - / - mice on high fat diet compared to wild - type mice , indicative of a reduced capacity for lipid oxidation .
another way in which caspase - 1 may contribute to steatosis is via regulation of cytokine and chemokine expression in the liver .
tnfalpha promotes the maturation of srebp - 1 [ 33 ] and mcp - 1 may directly regulate hepatic lipid homeostasis , independent of its chemokine activity [ 34 ] .
thus , lower expression of hepatic tnfalpha and mcp - 1 in casp1 - / - mice compared to wild - type mice on the high fat diet likely contributed to a decrease in high fat diet - induced hepatic steatosis .
the expression of caspase - 1 and other components of the inflammasome is constitutive in monocytes .
activation of the inflammasome in monocytes is therefore primarily controlled by recruitment of proteins to the inflammasome complex .
in contrast , expression of inflammasome components and caspase - 1 can be induced in non - myeloid cells , such as hepatocytes or other non - parenchymal cells [ 35 ] .
thus , the inflammasome and caspase - 1 is differentially regulated in multiple cell types of the liver ; activity in each cell type may make unique contributions to hepatic pathophysiology during disease progression .
caspase - 1 has been localized to both hepatocytes and non - parenchymal cells of the liver after mcd feeding and contributes to inflammation and fibrogenesis in this model of nash [ 18 ] .
however , very little further data is available to explain the cell - type specific mechanisms responsible for promoting caspase - 1 activity and inflammasome formation in nash .
the role of lps activation of tlr - 4 on hepatic kupffer cells , leading to expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , during high fat diet induced liver injury is well studied .
importantly , tlr4 - / - mice are protected from high fat diet induced liver injury [ 36 ] .
tlr ligands can include both pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( pamps ) ( eg. lipopolysaccharide ( lps )) and damage - associated molecular patterns ( damps ) ( eg. free fatty acids ( ffa ) .
high fat diet feeding not only increases the availability of ffa , but also increases plasma lps to a concentration equivalent to that seen in low - level metabolic endotoxemia and bacterial overgrowth [ 37 ] .
this metabolic endotoxemia is considered a key inducer of metabolic syndrome [ 37 ] , with multiple cytokines ( tnfalpha and il - 1beta ) and chemokines ( e.g. mcp - 1 ) contributing to the progression of both alcoholic - liver disease ( ald ) and nafld [ 34 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] .
ganz et. al. recently reported that lps , a ligand for tlr4 , may be an important regulator of hepatic expression of caspase - 1 and the nlrp3 inflammasome [ 21 ] .
these data provide an important potential link between the inflammasome and tlr - 4 - dependent responses .
our data are consistent with the hypothesis that caspase - 1 contributes to inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the liver during high fat diet feeding .
when wild - type mice were fed the high fat diet for 12 weeks , expression of hepatic tnf - alpha and mcp - 1 mrna were increased ; this response was attenuated in casp - / - mice .
this difference might be due to differential recruitment of monocytes / macrophages or differences in macrophage activation between wild - type and caspase - deficient mice .
here we find that high fat diet - induced increases in expression of monocyte / macrophage marker f4 / 80 was not affected by genotype , suggesting that caspase - 1 is important for regulating the sensitivity of kupffer cells to activation during high fat diet - induced obesity , rather than recruitment and / or proliferation of kupffer cells in the liver .
in addition to a role in steatosis and inflammatory cytokine activity , caspase - 1 also contributed to early stages of hepatic fibrosis in high fat diet - induced obesity .
fibrogenesis in the liver requires the activation of hepatic stellate cells , characterized by an increase in expression of alphasma expression .
alphasma - positive cells were increased in the livers of wild - type mice on the high fat diet , but were reduced in the parenchyma of casp1 - / - mice .
wild - type mice on the high fat diet also increased expression of col1alpha1 and a deposition of chicken - wire - like extracellular matrix in the perisinusoidal space , indicative of early phases of fibrogenesis .
casp1 - / - mice were protected from these markers of early fibrogenesis in response to a high fat diet .
these data suggest that caspase - 1 is important to the activation of hsc and promotes high fat diet - induced early fibrogenesis .
these data add to the increasing evidence for an innate immune function of hscs .
for example , tlrs are expressed by hsc [ 41 ] and have been associated with the progression of fibrosis .
tlr4 - / - mice are protected from bile duct ligation , thioacetamide or carbon tetrachloride - induced fibrosis [ 42 ] .
further , inflammasome components are expressed by both lx - 2 cells and primary cultures of hsc , regulating hsc function in culture and in vivo during experimental liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride or thioacetamide [ 15 ] .
mice lacking inflammasome components asc and nlrp3 have reduced thioacetamide or carbon tetrachloride - induced liver fibrosis [ 15 ] .
however , the cellular and molecular mechanisms for caspase - 1 - dependent hsc activation and fibrogenesis remain to be elucidated and will require further investigation .
taken together , the present data suggest that caspase - 1 is expressed and functional in multiple cell types of the liver at different times of high fat diet - induced nash , promoting steatosis , inflammatory cytokine production and the activation of hsc leading to early fibrogenesis .
this data is consistent with the concept that the inflammasome is differentially regulated in monocytic and non - monocytic cells .
caspase - 1 plays a role in protecting non - monocytic cells , such as hepatocytes , from steatosis [ 17 ] , whereas it contributes to the production of inflammatory cytokines in monocytic cells , like kupffer cells .
data from both high fat diet ( presented here ) and mcd diet - induced [ 18 ] liver injury clearly indicates that caspase - 1 also contributes to the regulation of hsc function in different mouse models of nash , indicating a need for further studies investigating the regulation and role of the caspase - 1 inflammasome in hepatic stellate cells .

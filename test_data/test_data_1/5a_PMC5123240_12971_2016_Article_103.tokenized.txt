background lack of smoking cessation education in undergraduate medical training hinders healthcare professionals in providing adequate tobacco cessation counselling .
we developed a comprehensive 4 - h smoking cessation counselling course for medical students that is easy to incorporate in a medical school curriculum , and assessed its short - term outcome for knowledge , skills , and attitudes .
methods eighty - eight medical students ( 53f , 35 m ) were educated by a doctoral student in five identical 4 - h courses .
a 45 - min theoretical introduction was followed by patient - physician role - playing by student pairs .
knowledge , skills , and attitude were assessed before and 4 weeks after the course by questionnaires , and by blinded analysis of pre - and post - course videos of a five - minute standardized patient situation .
results knowledge : before the course 10.6 ( mean , sd : 2.7 ) questions out of 29 were answered correctly , and increased to 19.2 ( 3.6 ) after the course ( p < 0.0005 ) .
major features of the students' counselling skills improved .
significant and highly relevant attitude changes reflected increased motivation to counselling smokers .
conclusion implementing a four - hour smoking intervention workshop into a medical curriculum was highly effective in improving students' knowledge , skills and attitudes towards smoking counselling , as well as providing them with additional clinical competencies .

keywords smoking cessation counselling medical education curriculum communication skills motivational interviewing knowledge skills attitude tobacco cessation education issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background smoking is the leading single cause of preventable disease [ 1 ] and death in the western world .
smoking - related mortality is estimated to increase from 3 million annually ( 1995 estimate ) to 10 million annually by 2030 , with 70 % of these deaths occurring in developing countries [ 2 ] .
the vast majority of these smokers wish to quit , but find it difficult to do so , in large part because of the addictive effects of nicotine .
smoking cessation treatment represents one of the most cost effective healthcare interventions [ 3 ] .
effective behavioural and pharmacological treatments , coupled with professional counselling and advice , are required to improve smoking cessation rates [ 4 ] .
since smoking duration is the principal risk factor for smoking - related morbidity , the treatment goals should be early cessation and prevention of relapse [ 4 ] .
physicians are uniquely placed to assist in smoking cessation as a crucial preventive medical measure : they are generally accessible to the whole community ; are frequently visited ; are the preferred source of information on health and lifestyle matters ; and have been demonstrated to be effective agents of change [ 5 ] .
furthermore , they act as visible role models and may unintentionally affect the smoking behaviour of others .
developing attitudes of future physicians towards preventive medicine ( e.g. smoking , other substance or non - substance abuse cessation , nutrition counselling / education , weight reduction , physical activity ) will likely provide a major impetus for the inclusion of preventive medicine content in medical school curricula and in other forms of physician education [ 6 ] .
assuming that physicians' personal attitude towards the issue of smoking cessation counselling is to a great extent formed during their medical education , any successful tobacco control measures within the medical profession will need to begin prior to graduation from medical school .
teaching modules should focus on the responsibility of physicians in disease prevention and training in specific smoking cessation techniques early in undergraduate curricula [ 7 ] .
despite its importance , few medical students receive formal training in smoking cessation counselling [ 7 , 8 ] .
anxiety and feelings of being ill - prepared for practice are common amongst medical students [ 9 ] .
several studies have documented physicians' failure to advise their patients regarding smoking [ 10 ] .
most smoking patients are not instructed or assisted in their cessation efforts .
given the importance of smoking in practically all aspects of medicine and the role of clinicians in advising and aiding cessation , such competence is needed [ 7 ] .
the purpose of this project was to teach students how to work effectively with patients in the area of smoking cessation counselling through an efficient 4 - h comprehensive course .
the workshop was designed to be easy to implement within the medical school curriculum .
key competences for adequate and successful smoking cessation counselling were intended to be as effective as possible , but still applicable to other health behaviours within daily clinical practice [ 11 ] .
methods course a 4 - h voluntary extracurricular smoking cessation teaching course " by medical students for medical students " was offered by the medical faculty of saarland university in homburg / saar , germany .
the course consisted of a 45 - min powerpoint presentation as a theoretical introduction , and a short discussion followed by 3 h of physician - patient role - playing and group discussions .
contents were in accordance with the swiss and international clinical guidelines for smoking cessation , as well as with swiss smoking cessation teaching courses for physicians [ 3 , 12 , 13 ] .
the course included a pre - and a post - course assessment scheduled 4 weeks apart .
the optional smoking cessation counselling courses , including full information on assessment , were offered for all medical students .
in order to accommodate the large response , the course was run five times between january 2006 and june 2007 .
the course was conducted by a doctoral student , vs ( 5th year medical student ) and took place in the seminar rooms of the university hospitals .
a medical expert , jh , with 25 years of experience in smoking cessation , including teaching smoking cessation counselling , was the full - time supervisor .
fifteen to 20 1st - 6th year medical students attended the course .
a 15 - min lunch break was included in the training period .
time was allocated for discussion and questions at the end of the course .
after each course all participating students were encouraged to fill out an anonymous course evaluation form in order to optimize future courses .
written informed consent was obtained from all participants in order that the data and film could be used for scientific research as well as for improving the course .
study objectives and outcome measurements the " success " or " partial success " of the course was reflected by " significant " ( p < 0.05 ) and " relevant " ( d = 0.25 ) improvements in each of the three dimensions of medical students' smoking cessation competence ( knowledge , skills , attitude [ for definitions : see additional file 1 ]) 4 weeks after the course , and were assessed as primary endpoints .
the course was considered " successful " according to our a priori definition whenever all three dimensions of competence ( knowledge , skills , attitude ) had significantly and relevantly improved in the assessment 3 - 4 weeks after the course ended .
the course was considered " partially successful " whenever less than three , but at least one dimension of competence had improved after the course .
formats for teaching and educational methods theoretical in - depth lecture the doctoral student ( vs ) delivered a 45 - min didactic powerpoint presentation , containing compact tobacco control information and set priorities to evidence - based practice - oriented theoretical knowledge needed for smoking cessation counselling by physicians .
together with additional literature , this short didactic approach served as a solid , but expandable theoretical basis for smoking cessation intervention training and clinical practice .
the slides were based on literature and course materials [ 4 , 11 , 13 , 14 ] .
physician - patient role - playing over a 3 - h period , the students participated in role - playing alternating between the smoking patient and the therapist , according to the six " stages of change " by prochaska and diclemente [ 15 ] .
each student was given a description of the case setting corresponding to one of the stages of change .
flip charts containing the most important points for smoking cessation counselling were also distributed , and the course leader explained their optimal use .
participants were encouraged to rate each other 's performance under interpersonal and emotional aspects with the aid of a check list and to discuss each other 's performances after each role - play .
five to ten minutes of interactive group discussions were implemented between each role - play .
both the doctoral student and expert continuously supervised the activities , provided feedback and answered questions .
teaching materials participants were given reading assignments from communication , health behaviour change and specialist smoking cessation literature , as well as instructive handouts to guide them through their interviews .
the handout - set included 6 items : a counsellor 's reference manual ( script ) summarizing current knowledge on tobacco use and cessation in clinical practice introducing the six stages of change : " pre - contemplation ," " contemplation ," " preparation ," " action ," " maintenance ," and " relapse ," as outlined by prochaska and diclemente [ 15 ] .
the manual also included a record sheet for consultations with smokers , and to facilitate data management of tobacco use and smoking cessation interventions .
a flip chart containing two algorithms summarizing counselling strategies and pharmacological therapy designed for the student 's or physician 's pocket or desk .
separate notes informing the students about each of the different role - playing settings according to the six stages of change by prochaska and diclemente [ 15 ] .
a check list for self - assessment after the role - playing containing a list of crucial facts required to counsel smokers .
information about the interview setting : the student were in the role of a general practitioner meeting a patient in order to re - examine a healed fracture of the ankle joint .
a set of patient instructions for the use of the discussed nicotine replacement products and smoking cessation drugs ( bupropion , varenicline ) .
the handout items are listed in additional file 2 : table s2 .
pre - and 4 weeks post - course assessments questionnaire on medical students' smoking cessation counselling competence students' smoking cessation intervention competences namely " knowledge ," " skills ," and " attitude " were assessed prior to training ( to determine baseline performance levels ) and 4 weeks after the course by questionnaires assessing the above - mentioned three dimensions of competence .
the questionnaires were developed for this study by an expert panel , using the evidence - based literature of medicine [ 16 ] and social sciences combined with empirical experiences in smoking cessation counselling .
assessing " knowledge " and the self - assessment of " attitude " ( subjective assessment of " attitude ") the dimensions of " knowledge " and " self - assessment of attitude " were rated with the aid of a questionnaire containing 41 questions of which 29 multiple choice questions assessed knowledge .
the basic knowledge required for efficient smoking cessation counselling is the essential composition of the course content , and can be summarized as : 1 ) cigarettes and nicotine , 2 ) diseases associated with smoking , 3 ) dependency and addiction , including an adapted pharmacological therapy for nicotine dependency , 4 ) the behaviour - change model with the different stages of change in the progress of smoking cessation according to prochaska and diclemente , and 5 ) related appropriate counselling strategies centred on basic communication concepts .
twelve questions targeting " attitude " assessed attitudes towards smokers , counselling of smokers , the smoking cessation course and their self - evaluated tolerance towards smokers .
all " attitude " items were answered with the aid of a visual analog scale ( vas ; scale range : 0 - 100 units ) .
the comprehensibility as well as the difficulty level of the questions were piloted with medical students not participating in the course .
five minutes of videotaped standardized patient interviews pre - and 4 weeks post - course , allowed an off - line blinded video analysis each participant had two ( pre - and 4 weeks post - course ) brief ( 5 min ) encounters with a standardized patient ( trained actor ) representing a stage of change (" pre - contemplation ") .
before the interview , each student was provided with information about the setting in which the general practitioner meets a patient in order to re - examine a healing fracture of the ankle joint .
both encounters were videotaped for a blinded analysis by two independent observers .
the dimension of the contents as well as the patient - physician relationship and interaction were assessed with 33 items using visual analog scales .
this allowed " skills " assessment as well as the externally assumed assessment of " attitude " ( in contrast to subject 's self - assessed " attitude " in the questionnaires ) .
assessing " skills " and the externally assumed assessment of " attitude " two independent and " blinded " evaluators ( a senior medical student and a physician in internship who used this analysis as his doctoral thesis ) were recruited and extensively trained individually and as a group , and repeatedly supervised by a multidisciplinary expert panel to rate the videotaped performances [ 17 ] using a rating check list .
evaluators were provided with a detailed evaluator 's manual based on criteria of an expert panel of medical practitioners and smoking researchers used in swiss smoking cessation courses , including a questionnaire assessing whether the student , in the role of a counsellor , covers the most important points of smoking cessation .
we assessed whether the student was able to detect the patient 's nicotine dependency , evaluate the smoking history and identify the patient 's stage of change according to prochaska and diclemente .
moreover , the check list covered the students' abilities to focus on the patient 's problems concerning smoking cessation , offer possible treatments including an appropriate pharmacological therapy and suggest further appointments .
details of the rating are indicated in additional file 3 .
any ambiguity had to be discussed and resolved together with the third evaluator and the expert panel .
no information about the time point ( pre - or post - course assessment ) of the interviews was provided to the evaluators .
more information about the structure of the rating schedule can be found in additional file 4 .
statistics data were analysed with the systat 12.0 software ( systat inc. , point richmond , ca , usa ) .
a p - value of <= 0.05 was considered significant .
the median and range is given for descriptive statistics of variables with normal distribution of the mean ( standard deviation ) and for nonparametric distribution of variables .
according to group number and design , paired t - test , unpaired t - test , analysis of variance ( anova ) with planned contrast analysis between groups or kruskal - wallis and mann - whitney u - test were applied , respectively .
for computation of cohen 's d effect sizes the online calculator for effect sizes by lenhard and lenhard [ 18 ] was used .
cohen 's d value ( d ) was used to estimate the effect sizes in the pre - post comparisons of the group .
as there are no agreed standards for how to interpret an effect size , the most established approach by cohen was applied [ 19 , 20 ] .
as a rule of thumb he suggested d >= 0.2 for small , d >= 0.5 for moderate and d >= 0.8 for large - sized effects .
wolf [ 21 ] simplified cohen 's scopes into d >= 0.25 meaning that the effect is educationally / academically significant ( i.e. " something was learned ") and d >= 0.50 standing for an effect being further practically significant ( therapeutic , i.e. " something happened ") .
results study subjects and biometric data eighty - eight ( eight pre - clinical and 80 clinical ) medical students participated .
twenty percent of the participants were smokers ( 11 female and five male ) , 66 % non - smokers and 14 % former smokers ( i.e. more than 100 cigarettes in life ) .
competence dimensions knowledge whereas participants could answer 10.6 ( mean , sd : 2.7 ) questions out of 29 correctly prior to the course , 4 weeks after the course they demonstrated increased knowledge , and answered 19.2 ( mean , sd 3.6 ) questions successfully ( p < 0.0005 ) corresponding to 81 % .
the effect size by cohen 's d was 2.7 , which is considered as an " extremely relevant " improvement .
the results are shown in additional file 5 : figure s1 .
objective results were distinctly reflected in students' subjective anonymously written feedback forms , as well as in verbal feedback .
skills significant gains were observed in the investigation of the motivation to quit smoking , in recommendations for stopping smoking , and suggestions for practical strategies to facilitate smoking cessation and prevent relapse .
substantial gains were also noted in the assessment of the duration and amount of tobacco consumption , and in the encouragement of the patient to reflect on present smoking behaviour in arguments against smoking and in informing the patient about benefits of smoking cessation .
this included asking the patient to weigh the pros and cons of smoking cessation , offering assistance for smoking cessation , informing the patient about smoking cessation and the withdrawal process , providing information about nicotine replacement therapy including instructions , and offering to discuss smoking again during the next visit ( all p < 0.05 ) .
for the most part , there was a notable increase in the approximate measure of the " sum of observed skills " for each student , as seen in the video - analysis pre - versus 4 - weeks post - course as shown in additional file 6 : figure s2 ( from mean 9.1 ( sd 2.0 ) to 11.8 ( sd 2.2 ) ; p < 0.0005 ; cohen 's d = 1.3 ) .
attitude c1 ) subjective ( self - ) assessment of " attitude " general attitude towards smoking counselling changed dramatically in questions 1 and 4 , as also evidenced by cohen 's d. questions 2 and 4 showed further changes between pre - and 4 weeks post - course , including a definite attitude to help smokers .
many students already expressed this attitude before the course , so there is probably some ceiling effect so that residual potential changes might only be small .
attitudes toward smokers as persons also became more tolerant , possibly reflecting more emotional understanding in their dependency ; however , other very personal questions on the place of smokers in the students personal life did not change .
results are given in additional file 7 : table s1 .
c2 ) externally assumed assessment of " attitude " the objective assessment of students' attitude showed a major positive change in virtually all assessed dimensions , as represented in additional file 2 : table s2 .
questions on students benefits on the visual analog scale ( 0 - 100 ) in reply to the question whether they think that it would be possible to counsel smokers on the basis of the knowledge and skills learned in the course , most students answered that they agreed strongly with this statement ( strongly agree = 0 - 19 pts ; mean = 17.4 ; sd = 3.8 ) .
all 87 students agreed that they would like to participate in further courses of the same style and with a similar goal setting ( 1 = agree ; mean = 1.0 ; sd = 0.0 ) .
more items about the students' evaluation after the course and their results are shown in additional file 8 .
discussion the study confirms that a compact comprehensive 4 - h interactive smoking cessation workshop for medical students is effective in terms of a profound short - term effect on the participants' counselling abilities .
its design allows easy inclusion in the medical curriculum .
as the course was designed , organized and conducted by medical students for their fellow medical students and supported by experts , its low costs makes it feasible for low - and middle income countries , where institutional receptivity for integration of tobacco control education in the medical curricula is frequently limited .
the workshop was implemented " by students for students " thus promoting corporate culture and identity among medical students , which may have been part of the particularly high acceptance of the course .
furthermore , in their spontaneous feedback , many students considered this smoking cessation counselling workshop to be " in line with the trend. " the quality of teaching during medical education is an important predictor of medical students' learning outcomes [ 22 ] .
observations of community - based faculties indicated strong deficits in the provision for feedback [ 23 ] .
in order to motivate students and to leave room for feedback , we offered the course to all medical students in the context of voluntary participation independent of their educational level .
their feedback confirmed that the course had a fundamental effect on " the enhancement of physician - patient communication " in general .
active educational methods , particularly standardized patient - physician role - playing were used in this study to foster " learning by doing " of counselling skills .
whereas the practical parts of the course emphasized brief intervention strategies [ 24 , 25 ] using key components of motivational interviewing for the range of patients willing to quit - to patients unwilling to quit .
the course was intended to form a focused , albeit expandable basis for clinical practice .
students were provided with the knowledge and skills needed to reasonably fill a minimal - but realistic - intervention time of approximately 5 min according to the patient 's individual stage of readiness to quit .
the vast majority of students rated the exercises and intervention training educational content as highly important and appropriate for their level of training and for their future clinical work .
this is also reflected by the fact that at the 4 - week evaluation , 77 % of the students had not consulted the hand - outs , underlining that the learning experience was , in effect , the course itself .
when and how to learn smoking cessation counselling ?
in our study the " two - half day training program " suggested in humair and colleagues " new curriculum to train residents in smoking cessation " [ 13 ] was reduced to a 4 - h comprehensive course en bloc , and tailored to medical students' educational needs independent of their academic year .
similar courses at 12 us medical schools [ 26 ] were quite heterogeneous , and lasted 4 to18 h. by including education about tobacco in the medical curricula early on , students can be alerted to the health effects of tobacco use and learn to assist smokers to quit .
this paper describes an efficient and economic setting for a smoking cessation course using the stages - of - change model by prochaska , et al .
[ 15 ] to teach medical students how to provide smoking cessation counselling tailored to the smoker 's individual readiness and motivation and to prescribe pharmacological therapy .
the transtheoretical model is an evidence - based model of behavior change that has been developed and tested during the past decades in the context of smoking cessation [ 27 ] .
antypas and colleagues see the potential to combine the efficacy of health behavior change theory - based interventions with the higher perceived usefulness of interventions designed according to patient input [ 28 ] .
in their anonymous feedback most students strongly agreed that the course provided not just the competence to approach and counsel smokers in a specifically scientific way , and overcome theoretical arbitrary dividing lines in order to assign patients to categories by means of a diagnosis and a consecutive treatment plan .
they also learned about the physician - patient relationship in general , more or less detached from theoretical assessment tools , thus enabling them to expand and modify their counselling skills according to the individual needs of their future patients .
the use of the stages - of - change model to behaviours other than tobacco dependence is an advantageous teaching method for promoting behavioural change in addiction in general , such as exercise , sleep hygiene , or nutrition , rather than specific techniques for specific behaviours [ 29 ] .
for the purpose of an efficient training methodology and a proper evaluation of the issue of smoking cessation , competence was differentiated into the components " knowledge ," " skills " and " attitude ," which is well established in the literature [ 30 ] .
students demonstrated significant , and considering cohen 's d effect size and student feedback , probably highly relevant improvements in key measurements of knowledge , skills and attitude regarding smoking cessation counselling and in the confidence and motivation to apply those competence elements in practice as future physicians .
medical students felt more knowledgeable and confident in following the recommended practices and offering cessation counselling to their future patients , as shown in additional file 7 : table s1 .
the most important outcome of knowledge , skill and attitude results may be the remarkable shift in attitude .
behaviour towards the patient is probably most influenced in the long - term by attitude .
study limitations as there are no existing validating tools , therefore the questionnaires have not been validated .
the current assessment for physicians and trainees formats reliably test core knowledge and basic skills .
however , they may underemphasize some important domains of professional medical practice , including interpersonal skills , lifelong learning , professionalism , and the non - trivial step of integration of core knowledge and skills into clinical practice .
in addition to assessments of basic skills , new formats that assess clinical reasoning , expert judgment , management of ambiguity , professionalism , time management , learning strategies , and teamwork would require optimal multidimensional assessments .
institutional support , reflection , and mentoring should accompany their development and change medical school programs and education .
unfortunately , most program evaluations - ours included - lack long - term follow - up. variations in counselling competence between genders were not considered .
empirical findings on gender differences in smoking cessation with focus on 1 ) nicotine replacement therapy , 2 ) depression and anxiety factors , 3 ) post - cessation weight gain and body - shape concerns , 4 ) post - cessation withdrawal , and 5 ) the importance of social support during smoking cessation might play a role .
there may exist an important selection bias due to non - randomized selection of the participants .
the course took place on a voluntary basis , and students who voluntarily enrolled for this course may be more motivated .
conclusions we conclude that the study 's major objectives were achieved as significant and assumed relevant gains in medical students' dimensions of competence ( knowledge , skills , attitude ) for successful patient - centred smoking cessation counselling could be measured .
the students' anonymous feedback was an indicator for the courses feasibility and for improved self - efficacy , suggesting that such a course was tailored to their competence needs , and could be implemented into medical school curricula .
the course seems highly effective in promoting future physicians' ability in smoking cessation counselling and thus in the long - term retention of medical students' preventive medical competence .
although not shown , such trained competences may foster general counselling competences in further areas , such as addiction , nutrition , exercise and weight , stress management , or sleep issuescounselling could be measured .

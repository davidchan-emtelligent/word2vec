summary : isomif finder is an online server for the identification of molecular interaction field ( mif ) similarities .
user defined binding site mifs can be compared to datasets of pre - calculated mifs or against a user - defined list of pdb entries .
the interface can be used for the prediction of function , identification of potential cross - reactivity or polypharmacological targets and drug repurposing .
detected similarities can be viewed in a browser or within a pymol session .
availability and implementation : isomif finder uses jsmol ( no java plugin required ) , is cross - browser and freely available at bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca / imfi .
contact : rafael.najmanovich @ usherbrooke.ca supplementary information : supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online .
1 background binding site similarities capture local physico - chemical correspondences between two protein structures , in particular cavities , based on functional pseudocenters ( shulman - peleg et al. , 2005 ) , all surface atoms ( najmanovich et al. , 2008 ) , electrostatic surfaces ( kinoshita et al. , 2007 ) or molecular interaction fields ( mifs ) ( chartier and najmanovich , 2015 ) among others .
applications include , the prediction of molecular function , detection of cross - reactivity ( weber et al. , 2004 ; xie et al. , 2009 ) and polypharmacological targets ( kalliokoski and vulpetti , 2011 ) , druggability analyses ( campagna - slater et al. , 2011 ) , prediction of fragments or bioisosteric replacements ( tang and altman , 2014 ; wood et al. , 2012 ) , drug repurposing and classification ( allali - hassani et al. , 2007 ; najmanovich et al. , 2007 ) , etc .
we present isomif finder , a versatile web - server for the detection of mif similarities with isomif ( chartier and najmanovich , 2015 ) .
isomif uses 6 probes ( hydrophobic , aromatic , h - bond donor / acceptor and positive / negative charge ) and a coarse - grained force field to define mifs measured in cavities and a graph matching procedure to detect mif similarities .
web - servers exist for some other methods e.g. sumo ( jambon et al. , 2005 ) , pdbfun ( ausiello et al. , 2005 ) , ef - seek ( kinoshita et al. , 2007 ) , siteengine ( shulman - peleg et al. , 2005 ) , probis server ( konc and janezic , 2014 ) and isocleft finder ( kurbatova et al. , 2013 ) .
2 submitting a job the query mifs are calculated in cavities of a pdb structure .
the user first provides a pdb ( berman et al. , 2007 ) structure by entering a 4 letter - code or uploads its own .
the user then chooses to find the top n largest cavities in the pdb or to find the cavity where a specified ligand is bound .
cavities are identified with the get _ cleft algorithm ( gaudreault et al. , 2015 ) , our in - house implementation of surfnet ( laskowski , 1995 ) .
the user then selects the comparison set , either one of four pre - calculated mif datasets or a user defined pdb structure list .
the four datasets are the human purinome with 2643 mifs calculated around purine containing ligands bound to human proteins , the scpdb with 8077 mifs calculated in ligand binding sites ( desaphy et al. , 2015 ) , a non - redundant pdb pisces dataset ( wang and dunbrack , 2003 ) with 14 082 entries and a dataset of 412 entries of structures of drugs bound to their primary targets ( or homologue ) taken from the pdb website .
as mentioned , the user can alternatively provide a list of pdb structures and for each specify the top n largest cavities to find or one with a specified bound ligand .
the mifs of the comparison set will be calculated in these cavities .
finally , several parameters can be defined and optimal values for each are chosen by default .
we refer the readers to the original isomif publication for an explanation of these parameters and other methodological details ( chartier and najmanovich , 2015 ) and to the online help guide .
3 cropping the cavities the cavities identified can sometimes be very large and include non - druggable cavities. by cropping the cavities , the user ensures the query mifs are calculated in regions of interest .
for this , a 3d molecule viewer for each query cavity ( supplementary fig. s1 ) shows cavity lining residues that can be unchecked , cropping the cavity volume within 3 a radius of their atoms .
if the user provided a list of pdb entries for the comparison set , a table lists the cavities found with corresponding information like chains in contact , bound molecules and number of residues in contact ( supplementary fig. s2 ) .
each cavity can be visualized within the protein structure ( gif and png ) and the user can select only the cavities of interest for the comparison .
4 results page a results table for each query cavity lists the top hits found ( supplementary fig. s3 ) and can be downloaded in csv format .
the top hits can be sorted by tanimoto similarity or number of nodes ( similar probes detected ) .
additional data provided includes z - score , the search space ( number of grid points sampled ) , the crystalized ligand around which the hit mif is calculated ( for purinome , scpdb and drug - target datasets only ) , the pfam family , uniprot and protein name .
a snapshot of the detected similarities can be visualized in the browser with a gif or png image .
downloadable pymol sessions show the query ( green ) and target hit ( cyan ) structures with bound molecules and mif similarities , all superimposed using the transformation matrix that optimally minimizes the pairwise distance between matched probes .
the similar probes are shown using spheres coloured by interaction type : hydrophobic ( cyan ) , aromatic ( orange ) , h - bond donor ( blue ) , acceptor ( red ) , positive ( green ) and negative ( magenta ) charge .
bigger spheres represent probes from the query protein and smaller spheres from the comparison set protein .
semi - transparent spheres represent the initial mifs of each protein .
the matched probes and the initial mifs for each probe have individual selections in pymol making it easy to analyse the different objects individually ( supplementary fig. s4 ) .
5 example application high level of binding site mif similarity suggests the cavities might share similar molecular functions .
in other words , a drug bound in a one could bind the other .
experimental evidence suggests that carbonic anhydrases can be cross - reactivity targets of celecoxib , a cox - 2 specific inhibitor and that this approved drug could be repurposed to treat glaucoma ( weber et al. , 2004 ) .
when using the celecoxib binding site of cox - 2 ( pdb 6cox ) as query , carbonic anhydrase xiv ( pdb 1rj6 ) is found within the top hits of the drug - target dataset ( fig. 1 ; created using the pymol session of the mif similarities ) .
both ligands have a sulfonamide group surrounded by histidines in both proteins causing the negative charge similarities ( magenta spheres ) .
in 6cox , his90 could interact with the sulfonamide via hydrogen bonding while in 1rj6 the interaction would be mediated by a zn2 + atom ( small grey sphere ) coordinated by his94 119 and 96 .
hydrogen bond donor and acceptor similarities were also found near the sulfonamide ( not shown for clarity ) .
the hydroxyl of thr199 in 1rj6 creates a region favorable for h - bond acceptor probes , similarly to the amine of gln192 in 6cox .
the same detailed analysis could be done for other probes .
this example highlights how the results of isomif finder can be used to analyse binding site similarities , the underlying structural determinants in a context of drug repurposing and analysis of cross - reactivity. fig. 1. negatively charged probe similarities between celecoxib binding site of pdb 6cox and acetazolamide binding site of 1rj6 supplementary material supplementary data acknowledgements r.j.n. is part of cr - chus , the institute of pharmacology of sherbrooke , proteo ( the quebec network for research on protein function , structure and engineering ) and grasp ( groupe de recherche axe sur la structure des proteines ) .

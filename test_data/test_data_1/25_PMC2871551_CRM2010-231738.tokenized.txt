we report a case of a clostridium septicum empyema in an immunocompetent woman following operation for an incarcerated internal hernia .
the patient was successfully treated with pleural decortication and an extended course of postoperative antibiotics .
this is the first report of such an infection in the medical literature .
1. introduction clostridium septicum is an anaerobic , spore - forming gram - positive bacillus .
the organism is ubiquitous and is readily found in soil as well as in the gastrointestinal tract of humans [ 1 ]. c. septicum causes disease in nonhuman mammals and birds , and it was recognized historically as one of the causes of gas gangrene arising from battlefield injuries [ 1 ] .
in the 1960s and 1970s , it became apparent that there was a group of individuals who were uniquely susceptible to infection via nontraumatic routes , namely , those with hematologic malignancies [ 2 - 4 ] .
over the ensuing decades , the number of cases attributable to other malignancies , particularly colonic neoplasms , has increased dramatically such that the recommendation has been made that patients with spontaneous infections be screened for cancer [ 5 ] .
although nontraumatic infections in normal hosts do occur , they would appear to be quite rare , based upon our review of the available literature .
herein we report on a monomicrobial pleural space infection with c. septicum in an otherwise normal host .
2. case report the patient is a 68 - year - old woman who presented to the hospital with less than 24 hours of right upper - quadrant abdominal pain and nausea .
she had a past history of alcohol and tobacco abuse , although she had been abstinent from both for five years at the time of presentation .
no hiv risk factors were identified .
she did not have a fever , and she had moderate abdominal tenderness on examination .
her chest x - ray was interpreted as showing a right lower - lobe infiltrate ( figure 1 ) , and she received intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected community - acquired pneumonia .
because of persistent pain , an abdominal ultrasound was performed , which was negative for gallbladder wall thickening , stones , or pericholecystic fluid .
a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid ( hida ) scan was also normal .
the antibiotics were continued .
the third day in the hospital , her abdomen became more diffusely tender and she developed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response .
her heart rate was controlled with intravenous diltiazem .
an abdominal ct scan was performed , and it revealed multiple dilated loops of bowel anterior and superior to the liver , with associated free fluid ( figure 2 ) .
laboratory studies demonstrated a leukocytosis of 13,000 white blood cells / mm3 with a left shift and two - dimensional echocardiography revealed a moderate pericardial effusion , without evidence of hemodynamic compromise .
she was taken to the operating room , where she was found to have an internal hernia , with an ischemic loop of ileum incarcerated between the liver and the diaphragm .
the hernia was reduced , and the ischemic segment of bowel was resected .
she also underwent a cholecystectomy during the same procedure .
ciprofloxacin and metronidazole were administered postoperatively .
on the first postoperative day , control of her atrial fibrillation worsened .
an echocardiogram was repeated , revealing an increase in size of the pericardial effusion .
the cardiothoracic surgical service was consulted , and two days later she was taken back to the operating room and underwent drainage of the effusion and construction of a pericardial window .
the pericardial fluid contained 2 white blood cells / mul , with a manual differential of 33 % polymorphonuclear leukocytes , 44 % lymphocytes , and 23 % monocytes .
the total protein was 2.9 g / dl and the glucose was 131 mg / dl. microbiologic stains of the pericardial fluid were negative for bacterial , fungal , and acid - fast organisms , and cultures were ultimately negative as well .
she improved following the procedure and was discharged home 6 days later , on no antimicrobial therapy .
the patient returned to the hospital 19 days later due to a complaint of worsening shortness of breath .
examination showed her to have a low - grade fever of 38degreesc and diminished breath sounds in the right chest .
she had a white blood cell count of 24,500 / mm3 with 18 % band forms .
the remainder of her cbc was normal .
her chemistries and electrolytes were unremarkable , except for a depressed albumin of 1.8 g / dl. blood cultures were obtained and were negative .
her chest x - ray showed a right upper - lobe infiltrate with a large associated effusion ( figure 3 ) .
she was started on piperacillin / tazobactam and azithromycin , intravenously .
review of her chest x - ray suggested that she likely had several intrathoracic fluid collections .
a ct scan of the chest was performed , demonstrating a large , multiloculated fluid collection in the right chest , with multiple air - fluid levels ( figure 4 ) .
there was a mass effect on the mediastinal structures .
it could not be determined whether the fluid was contained above or below the diaphragm , so the patient was taken to the operating room , where an initial retroperitoneal approach showed that the fluid was in fact in the thoracic cavity .
she then underwent thoracoscopy , which immediately encountered 1000 ml of thin , brown fluid and gas .
decortication was attempted via the thoracoscope , but ultimately was completed via open thoracotomy .
gram stain of the pleural fluid was negative , but anaerobic cultures yielded clostridium septicum .
the organism was identified using the rapid ana ii system ( remel products , lenexa , ks , usa ) .
the organism did not produce beta - lactamase .
no additional susceptibility studies were performed .
there was no growth in aerobic cultures .
her antibiotics were changed to aqueous penicillin g , 3 million units iv every four hours , and she was discharged home from the hospital on the sixth postoperative day to complete four weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy at home .
she made a full recovery , and a colonoscopy , performed to rule out a colonic neoplasm , was negative .
she is still doing well , now over five years later .
3. discussion in an earlier review , spagnuolo and payne reported that spontaneous chest infections with clostridia spp. do occur in patients without trauma or apparent neoplasm [ 6 ] .
the majority of reviewed cases , however , still had some form of immune system compromise or other long - term chronic illnesses .
none of the patients in that small review were infected with c. septicum .
two later reviews reiterated that only five species of clostridium , namely , c. perfringens , c. sordellii , c. sporogenes , c. paraputrificum , and c. bifermentans , had been isolated as sole pathogens in cases of pleuropulmonary infection [ 7 , 8 ] .
a more general review of the microbiology of anaerobic empyema found that clostridium spp. constituted approximately four percent of all isolated organisms ( 7 / 161 ) [ 9 ] .
most of these were not isolated in pure culture , and , again , c. septicum was not identified from any patient 's infection .
it would appear likely that our patient 's infection arose from her compromised gastrointestinal tract. whether this was from direct spread across the diaphragm or from hematogenous dissemination is not clear .
in their review , patel and mahler [ 8 ] noted that a small but important subset of patients likely acquired their infection due to gut pathology .
the observation that there are a significant number of cases of c. septicum infection associated with colon cancer may have more to do with intestinal damage than from any immunosuppressive effect of the neoplasm itself .
our patient was not found to have cancer .
the mortality rate of clostridium infections in the chest was estimated at 30 % in one review , although the authors note that attributable mortality and mortality with appropriate antibiotics and drainage is significantly lower [ 8 ] .
given that most patients with nontraumatic infections with c. septicum appear to be immunocompromised , are there any specific factors which we can infer may be protective ?
the primary virulence factor of c. septicum appears to be alpha toxin , which exhibits necrotizing and hemolytic activities in vitro and in animal models [ 1 , 10 ] .
thus , johnson et al .
[ 11 ] reported on the antibody response to alpha toxin in seven survivors of c. septicum bacteremia .
two of their patients were considered normal hosts , who likely became infected as the result of a surgical procedure .
only one of these , who presented with myonecrosis and gas gangrene , developed neutralizing antibodies .
one of the immunocompromised patients in their series , an individual with occult cecal carcinoma , also developed antibodies to alpha toxin ( not found to be neutralizing ) .
none of the other immunocompromised patients developed antibodies , yet they nonetheless survived .
furthermore , antibodies to alpha toxin do not appear to be present in the general population , nor in immunocompromised individuals without infection .
indeed , survival thus appears to be more dependent upon appropriate antimicrobial therapy and surgical drainage than on the development of a humoral immune response .
in summary , our patient was unusual in several ways .
first , she was not found to have any immune compromise which would have led to an increased susceptibility to infection .
second , she developed an infection in a previously unreported site .
this case adds to the available clinical information and body of literature surrounding this infrequently encountered , yet , nevertheless , medically important pathogen .

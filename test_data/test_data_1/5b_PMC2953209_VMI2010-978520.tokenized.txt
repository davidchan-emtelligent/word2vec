the aim of the present paper was to investigate the efficiency of the equine chorionic gonadotropin ( ecg ) plus human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) associated with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( map ) to estrous ewes synchronization .
ninety texel ewes were investigated during seasonal anoestrous .
the ewes received intravaginal sponges containing map ( 60 mg ) for nine days .
at the time of sponges' withdrawal , the ewes were divided into three groups ( g ) : ( 1 ) receiving 2 ml of saline i.m .
( n = 30 ) , ( 2 ) receiving ecg 400 iu i.m .
( n = 30 ) , and ( 3 ) receiving ecg 400 iu plus hcg 200 iu i.m .
( n = 30 ) .
twelve h after sponges' removal , teaser rams were used to estrus check and remained with the ewes for 96 h. the artificial insemination was made with fresh semen 10 h after estrus detection .
the effect of the treatment was not significant for the estrous rates among the groups : 73 % , 90 % , and 86 % , respectively .
the main effect was observed in the pregnancy and lambing rates among the groups : 70 % , 86 % , 56 % , and 80 % , 120 % , 56 % , respectively .
based on these results from our study , the use of the map - - ecg is the best choice to improve the fertility rate on ewes .
1. introduction the first service of artificial insemination ( ai ) in sheep in brazil was offered by the board of agriculture in rio grande do sul state in 1940 [ 1 ] .
synchronization of estrous and ovulation creates an opportunity for the artificial insemination to perform in groups of ewes during a predetermined time .
estrous synchronization has been practiced for the last few decades when many protocols varying in degrees of success were based on the use of intravaginal progestagen devises inserted for 7 to 14 days followed by gonadotropin injection at devices removal and teaser ram introduction [ 2 - 5 ] .
braden and moule [ 6 ] and hunt et al .
[ 2 ] recorded that the treatment with ecg - hcg induced considerable variation in the ovulatory response and consequent low fertility among the ewes in anoestrus season .
in [ 7 ] , by cline et al. p.g .
600 did not seem to improve the predictability of the intervals from progestagen withdrawal to estrus and to ovulation in ewes during reproductive season .
in fact , p.g .
600 seemed to reduce the predictability compared with syncro - mate - b + of equine chorionic gonadotropin ( ecg ) .
menchaca and rubianes [ 8 ] obtained 75 % pregnancy rate with ram mating after the application of intravaginal sponges containing medroxyprogesterone [ map ( 60 mg )] for six days associated with a dose of 400 iu ecg at the time of sponges' withdrawal during seasonal anoestrus .
dogan and nur [ 9 ] obtained 76.5 % pregnancy rate with ai at a fixed time after the use of the map - pmsg protocol during nonbreeding season in kivircik ewes .
husein and ababneh [ 10 ] registered 42.9 % of estrous and 41.7 % of fertility after the use of map in out - of - season ewes .
todini et al .
[ 11 ] and husein et al .
[ 12 ] related the rates of pregnancy and lambing ( 11 / 12 ) , born lambs ( 13 ) , fecundity ( 1.08 +/ - 0.2 ) , and prolificacy ( 1.18 +/ - 0.1 ) after the use of the fga - ecg protocol to estrus synchronization of out - of - season ewes .
moeini et al .
[ 13 ] applied cidr - ecg in out - of - season ewes and obtained 72.5 % of estrous and 60.2 % of fecundity .
barrett et al .
[ 14 ] and simonetti et al .
[ 15 ] concluded that 500 ui of ecg given after 12 days of progestogen treatment increased serum concentration of estradiol during the periovulatory period , particularly in anoestrus ewes ; this probably resulted in the synchronous estrous and ovulation in anoestrous ewes .
the aim of the present paper was to investigate the efficiency of map sponges in association with the equine chorionic gonadotropin ( ecg ) plus human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) to estrous synchronization in ewes and their fertility .
2. material and methods the present study was carried out on the farm sheep , located in the city of curitibanos , santa catarina state , south brazil , during september to december .
ninety texel ewes , two to four years old in good body condition , were investigated during anoestrus season .
all ewes received intravaginal sponges impregnated with 60 mg map ( pfizer , paulinia , brazil ) for nine days .
at the time of sponges' withdrawal , the ewes were divided into three groups ( g ) : ( 1 ) ( control ) received 2 ml of saline i.m .
( n = 30 ) , ( 2 ) receiving ecg 400 iu ( intervet , sao paulo , brazil ) i.m .
( n = 30 ) , ( 3 ) receiving ecg 400 iu plus hcg 200 iu ( intervet , sao paulo , brazil ) i.m .
( n = 30 ) .
twelve h after sponges' removal , painted teaser rams were used to check the estrous and remained with the ewes for 96 h. during this time , the estrous was recorded every 3 hours .
the semen used for insemination was collected from two healthy rams by the artificial vagina method [ 16 ] .
immediately after collection into a graduated tube in 0.1 ml division , the ejaculation was evaluated , and only those with a volume higher than 0.5 ml and under a phase - contrast microscope ( olympus bx41tf , tokyo , japan ) were analyzed , considering the wave motility >= 3 ( score ranging 0 to 5 ) , progressive motility higher than 75 % , and vigor >= 3 ( score ranging 0 to 5 ) based on brazilian college of the animal reproduction [ 17 ] .
before one - step dilution at 30degreesc , the semen was adjusted at a concentration of 600 x 106 viable spermatozoa / ml. the extender consisting of sterilized cow skim milk added 1 % of glucose ( merk , darmstadt , germany ) , 1000 ui sodium g penicillin ( biochimico , rio de janeiro , brazil ) , and 1000 mug / ml dihydrostreptomycin sulfate ( biochimico , rio de janeiro , brazil ) .
after dilution , the semen was kept at room temperature .
the ai was made with 0.25 ml containing 150 x 106 spermatozoa per dose with diluted fresh semen by the intracervical method [ 18 ] , 10 h after estrous detection .
five days after ai , the ewes were submitted to ultrasonography using an ultrasound apparatus ( scanner 485 , pie medical inc. , maastricht , holland ) equipped with an 8 - mhz rectal linear transducer used to scan the ovaries and to check the corpora lutea presence [ 19 , 20 ] .
the pregnancy diagnosis was made with the ewe in the standing position forty days after ai. scanning was performed with an ultrasound apparatus ( scanner 485 , pie medical inc. , maastricht , holland ) equipped with a 5 - mhz external convex transducer and a printer .
the number of lambs was confirmed after lambing .
the mean values for onset of estrous , periods of estrous duration , estrous response , corpora lutea number , pregnancy rate , and number of lambs were analyzed with analysis of variance ; post hoc comparisons were made using tukey 's test .
statistical significance was defined as p < . 05 .
3. results and discussion the results obtained in the present study , which are set out in table 1 , show that estrous percentages were not significant between g2 and g3 , but it was between g2 and g1 treatments ( p < . 025 ) .
these results agree in part with those reported by dogan and nur [ 9 ] who obtained 76.5 % pregnancy rate with ai at a fixed time after the use of the map - pmsg protocol during non - breeding season .
this small difference might be due to the ai methods and the other variants as well as environment and breed of the ewes .
the g2 was significantly superior ( p < . 013 ) to g1 and g3 regarding interval between estrous onset and sponges' withdrawal .
these data are compatible with the results obtained by dogan and nur [ 9 ] , cline et al .
[ 7 ] , and husein et al .
[ 12 ] .
specifically into g3 , a high variability was detected among the ewes , confirmed by the standard deviation which was very high .
this fact did not improve the ewe fertility and reproductive management in the anoestrous season ( table 1 ) .
in relation to estrous duration , those data are not statisticaly significant among groups , but the g2 data are compatible with the results described by dogan and nur [ 9 ] .
the corpora lutea number found per group was not different among the groups .
in the pregnancy rate , g2 was statistically superior to g3 ( p < . 049 ) .
the results obtained from g2 agree with those reported by menchaca and rubianes [ 8 ] and husein et al .
[ 12 ] .
the small pregnancy rate from g3 ( 56.66 %) points out the unpredictability of the intervals from sponge withdrawal to estrus and ovulation .
this finding is not compatible with those described by braden and moule [ 6 ] , hunt et al .
[ 2 ] , and cline et al .
[ 7 ] .
these authors added hcg to the protocol for estrous synchronization during reproductive season .
in our study , the hcg ( g3 ) was used out - of - season with the aim of improving ovulation .
the data obtained in g1 ( control ) were better than g3 , agreeing with results of husein and ababneh [ 10 ] .
analysis of table 1 showed that in g3 , a great difference between rates of estrous ( 86.66 %) and pregnancy ( 56.66 %) confirms the low ovulation rate and corpora lutea on the ovaries of the ewes submitted to the map + ecg + hcg protocol .
the number of born lambs ( p < . 0007 ) and that of twin lambing ( p < . 05 ) were higher in g2 than g1 and g3 ( table 1 ) .
these results are similar to those reported by husein et al .
[ 12 ] and todini et al .
[ 11 ] .
regarding the g3 , the small number of born lambs was attributed to the hcg added in the protocol ; it is in agreement with the findings described by braden and moule [ 6 ] , hunt et al .
[ 2 ] , and cline et al .
[ 7 ] .
these are the most important data showed in the present study , because the main objective of this research is the sheep farm production in non - breeding season to get three lambing incidents in two years .
4. conclusion it was concluded from this experiment that ecg is a better choice than hcg as the gonadotropin to use at the time of progesterone withdrawal to prepare ewes to ai during anoestrous season .
it was recognized that this conclusion was based on data from relatively small number of ewes ( i.e. , 30 per group ) , and the serum hormonal trial during experimental period was not conducted .
therefore , more investigation should be conducted to determine the ecg dose and the injecting time in the progesterone withdrawal .
we recommend that hcg should not be used to prepare ewes to ai during anoestrous season due to the low fertility showed by g3 obtained in this study .

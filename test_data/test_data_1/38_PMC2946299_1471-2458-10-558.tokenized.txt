background major depressive disorder is among the medical conditions with the highest negative impact on work outcome .
however , little is known regarding evidence - based interventions targeting the improvement of work outcomes in depressed employees .
in this paper , the design of a randomized controlled trial is presented in order to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant occupational therapy in employees with depression .
this occupational intervention is based on an earlier intervention , which was designed and proven effective by our research group , and is the only intervention to date that specifically targets work outcome in depressed employees .
methods / design in a two - arm randomized controlled trial , a total of 117 participants are randomized to either ' care as usual ' or ' care as usual ' with the addition of occupational therapy .
patients included in the study are employees who are absent from work due to depression for at least 25 % of their contract hours , and who have a possibility of returning to their own or a new job .
the occupational intervention consists of six individual sessions , eight group sessions and a work - place visit over a 16 - week period. by increasing exposure to the working environment , and by stimulating communication between employer and employee , the occupational intervention aims to enhance self - efficacy and the acquisition of more adaptive coping strategies .
assessments take place at baseline , and at 6 , 12 , and 18 - month follow - ups .
primary outcome measure is work participation ( hours of absenteeism and time until work resumption ) .
secondary outcome measures are work functioning , symptomatology , health - related quality of life , and neurocognitive functioning .
in addition , cost - effectiveness is evaluated from a societal perspective .
finally , mechanisms of change ( intermediate outcomes ) and potential patient - treatment matching variables are investigated .
discussion this study hopes to provide valuable knowledge regarding an intervention to treat depression , one of the most common and debilitating diseases of our time .
if our intervention is proven ( cost - ) effective , the personal , economic , and health benefits for both patients and employers are far - reaching .
trial registration number ntr2057 background major depressive disorder ( mdd ) is among the medical conditions with the highest negative impact on work outcome , even higher than debilitating medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and ischemic heart disease [ 1 ] .
depressed employees have an increased risk for both short - term [ 2 - 4 ] and long - term [ 5 ] sickness absence , and claim substantially more work disability pensions [ 6 ] than their non - depressed colleagues .
out of the ten most common chronic health conditions , depression is associated with the highest reduction in productivity in the workplace [ 1,7 ] .
not being able to ( fully ) participate in the labor market due to depression can lead to subsequent economic and social deprivation [ 8 ] .
this , in turn , can have an added negative impact on the course of depression [ 9 ] , initiating a downward spiral .
indeed , studies have demonstrated that employees who have experienced a depression - related disability episode are seven times more likely to have another mental health - related disability episode within 12 months [ 3,4 ] .
the financial burden of depression - related work disability for society is substantial , and will only continue to increase [ 8 ] .
in 2000 , two - thirds of the total costs associated with depression were work - related ($ 51.5 out of a total of $ 83.1 billion ) [ 10 ] .
even when depressed employees are clinically treated for depression , they still incur 3.2 times higher absenteeism - related costs when compared to non - depressed employees [ 11 ] .
moreover , these costs do not include costs related to productivity loss ( presenteeism ) which are higher than the costs of absenteeism and medical treatment combined [ 1 ] .
although the debilitating effects of depression on work - ability have been consistently demonstrated , little is known regarding evidence - based interventions targeting the improvement of occupational functioning in depressed employees [ 12 - 14 ] .
in fact , a recent review [ 13 ] concluded that our earlier study [ 15 ] was the only study that evaluated an intervention specifically focused on occupational functioning in employees with depression .
all other studies evaluated the effectiveness of antidepressants and psychotherapy , aimed at symptom reduction , with work as one of the outcome parameters .
in this review , insufficient evidence was found for the effectiveness of standard clinical treatment on the improvement of occupational outcomes [ 13 ] .
these findings are consistent with other studies that have demonstrated that symptomatic improvement does not necessarily correspond to an improvement in workplace performance [ 16,17 ] .
instead , functional improvement often lags behind symptom reduction [ 18,19 ] .
if we want to improve occupational outcomes in depressed employees , we need to develop additional interventions that target not only symptomatic , but also functional improvement .
based on both scientific literature [ 20 - 22 ] and clinical expertise , we developed an occupational intervention that focuses on work - participation ( defined as hours of absenteeism and time until work resumption ) in depressed employees .
results from our previous randomized trial [ 15 ] evaluating this intervention ( mentioned above ) were promising : the addition of occupational therapy to standard clinical treatment resulted in a significant reduction in sick - leave days during the first 18 months after baseline assessment .
furthermore , the occupational intervention did not increase work stress , was cost - effective , and was highly regarded by patients .
unfortunately , results demonstrated that adjuvant occupational therapy had no additive effect on the reduction in depressive symptomatology .
recently , we have developed an improved version of our earlier occupational intervention that is shorter ( 18 instead of 36 sessions ) and which focuses mainly on coping and behavioral change at the workplace .
there has also been a shift in the theoretical framework underlying this new occupational intervention .
the earlier intervention focused on an extensive period of pre - vocational training before work resumption , an approach that is consistent with the traditional ' train - and - place ' model [ 23 ] .
the new intervention , however , is based on the more recent ' place - and - train ' model [ 24 ] .
consistent with this latter model , the patient is now encouraged to return to the work environment as soon as possible .
in this way , the patient 's work situation is directly utilized as an integral component of treatment .
first , the return to the work environment can serve as an ' exposure in vivo ' to prevent avoidance of problematic work situations .
second , the patient can immediately begin implementing skills ( acquired during the intervention ) to actively cope with work - related stressors .
this increases the patient 's positive feelings regarding his or her ability to ( fully ) resume work .
third , by maintaining contact with the work environment ( i.e. , with supervisors and colleagues ) , the ' ranks are kept open ' : increased contact with the workplace enhances understanding and social support from colleagues , which facilitates the employee 's return to work .
finally , by having so called ' work visits ' , the new intervention aims to stimulate communication between employer and employee regarding the re - integration process .
previous findings from the physical health field have indicated that early communication between employer and employee lead to improved return - to - work rates [ 25,26 ] .
although there is vast evidence that the place - and - train approach is more effective in helping patients return to work than the traditional train - and - place approach [ 27,28 ] , current research has solely focused on the effect of individual placement and support ( ips ) , a place - and - train intervention that is specifically designed for unemployed patients with severe mental illness ( e.g. , schizophrenia ) .
consequently , work goals in these studies are set lower ( working for at least 1 day ) than those we seek to achieve in our study .
to the best of our knowledge , our new occupational intervention is the first to apply the place - and - train model to improve work - outcome in employees with depression .
in addition to the improved design of the new intervention , the design of this study contains several improvements over our earlier study [ 15 ] .
first , we are including measures of at - work productivity in addition to measures of work participation .
second , we will expand our sample size in order to increase power , taking into account the increased number of baseline and outcome variables and the small to moderate effect sizes of our earlier study .
finally , we are including personality measures , work - place characteristics ( e.g. , perception of work load and work problems ) , and neuropsychological functioning in order to identify potential predictors of treatment effect .
considering that clinical symptoms are hypothesized to be associated with an underlying dysregulation of cognitive processes [ 29 ] , assessment of neuropsychological functioning might provide a framework for objectifying the cognitive impairments ( e.g. , reduced concentration , problems with memory and planning ) that are frequently reported by patients with depression .
the objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial ( rct ) to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant occupational therapy ( ot ) , as compared to care as usual ( cau : for description , see methods ) , on the work - participation of depressed employees .
we hypothesize that patients who are receiving ot have a higher average reduction in hours of absenteeism and a faster return - to - work than patients receiving cau only .
second , the effectiveness of adjuvant ot regarding work productivity , health - related quality of life , depressive symptomatology , and neurocognitive functioning is evaluated .
we hypothesize that patients receiving ot have higher work productivity and a higher quality of life than patients receiving cau only .
furthermore , we hypothesize no short - term ameliorating effect of adjuvant ot on depressive symptoms or neurocognitive functioning .
however , over a more prolonged interval of time , we hypothesize that patients receiving cau + ot will have a larger reduction in depressive symptoms and neurocognitive functioning than patients receiving cau only .
in addition , we aim to evaluate the cost - effectiveness of ot from a societal perspective .
in order to identify the intervention 's mechanisms of change ( intermediate outcomes ) , we aim to examine the effect of ot on work - related coping , self - efficacy , and the patient 's perception of the work environment .
finally , potential predictors of treatment effect are investigated in order to adequately tailor treatment in the future .
methods / design study design our study is a two - arm randomized controlled trial ( rct ) to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant occupational therapy to regular psychiatric outpatient treatment in patients with depression .
patients are randomized to ' care as usual ' ( control condition ) or ' care as usual ' with the addition of occupational therapy ( experimental condition ) .
the study includes a baseline assessment and follow - up assessments at 6 , 12 and 18 months after start of treatment .
the trial is approved by the medical ethics committee of the academic medical center and the university of amsterdam .
patients voluntarily participate in the study , and are offered a gift certificate of 35 euro for participation at the last follow - up assessment .
a signed informed consent form is obtained from each patient .
participants are informed of their right to withdraw their participation from the study at any time , without specification of reasons or negative consequences for their clinical treatment .
inclusion criteria participants are eligible for the study if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria : 1 ) diagnosis of major depressive disorder according to dsm - iv criteria ; 2 ) at least 25 % absenteeism due to the depressive disorder ; 3 ) duration of absenteeism of at least 8 weeks or the duration of the depressive disorder is at least three months ; 4 ) aged between 18 and 65 years ; 5 ) possibility of returning to their own or a new job ; 6 ) relationship between the depressive disorder and the work situation , i.e. ; work is one of the determinants of depressive disorder and contributes substantially (> 25 %) , or depressive symptoms reduce productivity or hinder the return to work ; 7 ) the participant agrees to the possibility of participation in the occupational intervention .
exclusion criteria participants are ineligible when they meet one or more of the following criteria : 1 ) diagnosis of bipolar disorder , a psychotic disorder or depression with psychotic characteristics ; 2 ) severe alcohol or drug misuse or dependence ; 3 ) severe physical problems that make participation to the study impossible ; 4 ) severe suicidality ; 5 ) inpatient treatment is indicated ; 6 ) current or recent ( i.e. , during the current depressive episode ) therapy with a psychotherapist , psychologist , or occupational therapist whose content resembles the content of our occupational intervention ; 7 ) current participation in a research study that disables participation in our study .
patient recruitment and procedure occupational physicians present potential study participants for a telephone screening , where the inclusion - and exclusion criteria are globally assessed by an independent psychiatrist .
next , potential eligible participants for the study receive a standard three - hour psychiatric intake at the outpatient department of the mood disorders program of the academic medical center .
in addition , a structured clinical interview for dsm - iv disorders [ 30 ] is administered , in order to check whether the participant meets the dsm - iv criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder and fails to meet the dsm - iv criteria of diagnoses mentioned in our exclusion criteria .
after the psychiatric intake , eligible patients are asked to sign an informed - consent form .
those who give written informed consent receive the full baseline assessment .
after baseline assessment , participants are randomized to the control or experimental condition .
all patients start care as usual ; those randomized to the experimental condition also start occupational therapy .
during care as usual , the 6 - , 12 - and 18 - month clinical follow - up assessments are conducted by the treating psychiatric resident .
when participants have finished care as usual , these assessments are conducted by an independent psychiatrist .
neurocognitive assessments are conducted by a trained researcher .
during assessments , participants are asked not to mention their intervention status in order to preserve blinding of the researcher .
interventions occupational intervention the occupational intervention is provided by two experienced occupational therapists , who have received extensive training in the intervention .
the intervention consists of three phases : phase 1 : problem clarification the first phase consists of an intake ( one session ) , an occupational anamnesis ( three sessions ) , and a video - observation ( one session ) .
during the intake , the patient 's current work situation and problem areas are explored .
in addition , the patient 's treatment goals and expectations regarding the occupational intervention are examined .
during the occupational anamnesis , the patient 's education and occupational history are systematically analyzed , in order to identify recurrent ineffective coping patterns in stressful situations .
during video - observation , the patient is recorded within a simulated work environment ( i.e. , engaging in role - playing ) , while the patient performs key tasks relevant to his or her job .
afterward , the recordings are viewed , and the patient 's experiences regarding the current tasks , workload , and relationships with colleagues are discussed .
in this way , the aspects of the job that the patient experiences as problematic are identified .
after completing the problem clarification phase , the occupational therapist discusses the content and goals of the intervention with the occupational physician ( op ) by telephone .
the therapist also informs the op that patients are required to work at least 2 hours per week when starting the second phase of the intervention .
phase 2 : occupational intervention the second phase consists of eight group sessions and four individual sessions .
central to this phase is the ' quality of work ' ( qw ) model .
the qw model is based on previous literature [ 20 - 22 ] and consists of five factors that affect work performance : ' work load ' , ' autonomy ' , ' relationships at work ' ' job perspective ' , and ' work - home interference ' .
according to this model , whenever there is an imbalance between work demands and work capacity , problems in occupational functioning are likely to occur .
in every group session ( approximately eight participants ) , the qw model is discussed , and patients are taught how to evaluate both the positive and negative factors in their own work situation in accordance with the qw model .
in this way , the model provides support for breaking the work problems down into specific , manageable pieces ( as opposed to general , insurmountable problems , as perceived by patients ) .
based on these evaluations , each group member decides what dimension within the model is most important to change in his / her own work situation .
this forms the basis for their individual work - reintegration plan .
during group sessions , progress regarding each patient 's work - reintegration plan is frequently evaluated .
in addition , group sessions are used to prepare for the meeting with the employer ( through role - playing ) and to develop a prevention plan .
the advantage of discussing the qw model in a group setting is that patients recognize they are not alone in their problems and that they can benefit from other participants' feedback .
concurrently with group sessions , three individual sessions and a meeting with the employer take place .
during individual sessions , the therapist tries to relate the presently occurring work stressors to the patient 's recurrent ineffective coping - pattern ( as discussed in the first phase of the intervention ) .
if needed , the therapist provides help with filling out the qw model .
in addition , the patient 's progress with the work - reintegration plan is monitored during individual sessions .
during the meeting with the patient 's employer ( i.e. , supervisor ) , the occupational therapist educates the employer regarding the content of the occupational intervention and the consequences of depression for work performance .
during this meeting , the patient has the opportunity to openly discuss work - related difficulties with the employer , such as an excessive workload or problematic interpersonal interactions .
phase 3 : follow - up within four to six weeks after the completion of the occupational intervention , patients receive a follow - up session to discuss potential problems during the work resumption process .
care as usual care as usual consists of treatment by psychiatric residents in the outpatient clinic of the mood disorders department at the academic medical center according to a treatment protocol consistent with the apa guidelines [ 31 ] .
visits consist of clinical management , including psycho - education , supportive therapy , and cognitive behavioral interventions .
therapies are supervised by an experienced senior psychiatrist on a weekly basis .
pharmacotherapy is started according to a protocolized algorithm .
if the patient 's condition is deteriorating and outpatient treatment is no longer adequate , the patient may be referred to day treatment or inpatient treatment at the same mood disorders department .
if the physician wishes to treat in a way that is deviating from the care as usual protocol , he / she is required to contact the research group .
randomization the randomization is conducted by an independent research - assistant , who uses a computerized program based on the minimization - randomization procedure [ 32 ] .
in order to assess intermediate outcomes and potential predictors of treatment effect , two - thirds of the participants are randomized to the experimental condition , and one - third is randomized to the control condition .
randomization is stratified according to hamilton score (<= 17 or >= 18 ) and number of previous episodes ( one or two , vs. three or more ) .
sample size and power based on previous results [ 15 ] , we expect to find a difference of 25 % in the main outcome variable between the experimental group and the control group .
to achieve a power of 0.80 , given a one - sided alpha of 0.05 , an estimated effect - size of 0.30 , and a control - to - experimental ratio of 1:2 , we need at least 35 patients in the control condition and 70 patients in the experimental condition .
considering the high loss to follow - up in this type of research design , we decided to expand the sample size by 10 percent .
thus , the total number of participants included in this study should be at least 116 .
power calculations are made with the program g - power [ 33 ] .
primary outcome work participation our primary outcome measure is work participation , defined in terms of absenteeism and work - resumption .
the first is operationalized as the average reduction in hours of absenteeism over the three 6 - month periods .
the latter is operationalized as time until full return - to work ( rtw ) and time until partial rtw .
time until full ( or partial ) rtw is defined as the duration of sick leave due to depression in calendar days from the start of treatment until full ( or partial ) rtw .
full rtw is defined as working the full amount of contract hours in own or other work for at least 4 weeks , without partial or full recurrence .
partial rtw is defined as working an increment of at least 5 hours ( when compared to the hours worked at baseline ) , for at least 4 weeks without partial or full recurrence .
data are derived from diaries that patients keep on a weekly basis during the 18 - month study period .
secondary outcomes work productivity work productivity is assessed in two ways .
first , participants are asked to record weekly their efficiency for the hours worked , on a scale of 1 (' not productive at all ') to 10 (' very productive ') .
second , the 25 - item work limitations questionnaire [ 34,35 ] is used to assess productivity loss ( presenteeism ) .
the wlq has demonstrated good reliability ( all scales have alpha 's above 0.90 ) and construct validity in both patient and employee populations [ 35 ] .
in addition to the wlq total score , we are examining three subscales ( the ' output ' , ' time ' , and ' mental - interpersonal ' subscale ) individually , since previous results have demonstrated a strong association between these subscales and depression - related work limitations [ 16,36 ] .
depressive symptomatology severity of depression is measured with the hamilton rating scale for depression ( hrsd ) and the inventory of depressive symptoms ( ids - sr ) .
the 17 - item hrsd [ 37 ] is a semi - structured clinical interview that covers a range of affective , behavioral and biological symptoms .
scores on this clinician - rated instrument range from 0 to 56 , where a score of >= 23 is qualified as ' very severe ' , 19 - 22 is qualified as ' severe ' , 14 - 18 as ' moderate ' , 8 - 13 as ' mild ' , and <= 7 as ' normal ' [ 38,39 ] .
the hrsd has acceptable psychometric properties [ 40 ] .
the ids - sr [ 41,42 ] is a 30 - item self - rated instrument to measure the severity of depression , with scores ranging from 0 to 84 .
a score of >= 39 is qualified as ' severe ' , 30 - 38 as ' moderate to severe ' , 22 - 30 as ' moderate ' , 14 - 22 as ' mild ' and <= 13 as ' normal ' [ 41 ] .
the ids - sr has good reliability and validity [ 42,43 ] .
health - related quality of life health - related quality of life is measured with the mos - sf 36 ( medical outcomes study - short form ) , a validated and widely used instrument for the assessment of health status [ 44,45 ] .
this self - report questionnaire contains 36 items regarding behavioral functioning and perceived psychological well - being during the previous four weeks .
responses to the 36 items can be aggregated into eight scale scores .
each scale score can be converted into a 0 to 100 scale , with higher scores indicating higher levels of functioning .
the dutch translation of the mos - sf 36 has demonstrated adequate psychometric properties [ 46 ] .
neurocognitive functioning speed of information processing is measured with the trailmaking test [ 47,48 ] part a and the stroop color - word test [ 49 ] part i. selective attention is measured with the stroop color - word test part iii , corrected for part ii. divided attention is measured by trailmaking test part b , corrected for part a. working memory is assessed by the subtest ' letter - number sequencing ' of the wais - iii [ 50 ] .
executive functioning is assessed by the manual version of the tower of london [ 51 ] .
economic evaluation medical consumption is assessed with the tic - p ( trimbos / imta questionnaire for costs associated with psychiatric illness ) [ 52 ] .
the tic - p is a validated dutch questionnaire that is commonly used in economic evaluations of treatment in mental - health treatment .
in order to calculate the indirect costs of both absenteeism and productivity loss , we are using data from the work limitations questionnaire and weekly self - report diaries ( self - constructed ) .
intermediate outcomes : mechanisms of change work - related coping one of the central goals in occupational therapy is to teach patients how to actively cope with the problems they encounter work - related situations .
coping behavior is measured by the utrecht coping list ( ucl ) [ 53 ] , adapted to specifically address coping behavior in work - related situations .
for our study , we are including the ucl - subscales ' avoidance behavior ' ( avoiding problematic situations , 8 items ) , ' passive reaction ' ( feeling unable to do anything about the situation , being absorbed by problems , 7 items ) and ' active problem focusing ' ( approaching problems with confidence and in a goal - directed way , 7 items ) .
all items are rated on a 4 - point scale , ranging from ' seldom or never ' ( coded 0 ) to ' very frequently ' ( coded 4 ) .
self - efficacy in our occupational intervention , an important mechanism of change is to provide patients with more perceived control over their work situation .
in other words , our occupational intervention aims to enhance patients' belief in their capacity to deal with work demands , or self - efficacy .
work - related self - efficacy is measured by the 11 - item questionnaire ' expectations regarding work resumption ' [ 54 ] .
perception of the work environment the ' perception and judgment of the working situation ' questionnaire ( vbba ) measures the patients' perception of the working situation .
the following vbba subscales are evaluated in order to longitudinally assess changes in perception of the work environment : work satisfaction , work tempo , work load ( mental and emotional ) , relationships at work ( with colleagues and supervisors ) , and work involvement .
potential predictors of treatment effect to investigate potential predictors of treatment effect , a wide range of variables are included in this study .
at baseline , the following variables are measured : socio - demographic characteristics ( e.g. , age , education level , gender ) , clinical history ( e.g. , severity of depression , number of previous episodes ) , personality ( e.g. , neuroticism , extraversion ) , job characteristics ( e.g. , type of profession , years of work experience , number of contract hours , contract type ) and a retrospective assessment of psychosocial work characteristics four weeks prior to sick leave ( e.g. , work load , variation in tasks , relationship with supervisor / colleagues ) .
in addition , several aspects within the neurocognitive domain are assessed at baseline as potential predictors of treatment effect : speed of processing is measured with the trailmaking test [ 47,48 ] part a and the stroop color - word test [ 49 ] part i. selective attention is measured with the stroop color - word test part iii , corrected for part ii. divided attention is measured by the trailmaking test part b , corrected for part a. working memory is assessed by the subtest ' letter - number sequencing ' of the wais - iii [ 50 ] .
executive functioning is assessed by the manual version of the tower of london [ 51 ] .
statistical analysis data are analyzed according to the intention - to - treat principle , i.e. , based on original intervention assignment , irrespective of the actual treatments received .
independent samples t - tests and chi ( 2 ) - tests are used to evaluate potential differences in baseline characteristics between the intervention and control condition .
in case of significant baseline differences between groups , the propensity score method [ 55,56 ] is used to adjust for these variables in the evaluations of the treatment effect .
missing independent variables are imputed using multiple imputation techniques .
effect of the intervention to take into account potential biased outcomes caused by selective loss to follow - up , we use a generalized linear mixed model ( glmm ) analysis approach , which , assuming missing at random ( mar ) for missing values , gives unbiased effect estimates .
mar is a less restrictive assumption than missing completely at random , and allows loss to follow - up to be related to baseline characteristics that are incorporated in the regression model .
glmm comprises , among others , logistic regression analysis ( dichotomous outcomes ; e.g. , proportion of participants who have returned to work ) , poisson regression ( count outcomes ; e.g. , hours worked ) , cox regression for censored data ( e.g. , time to full and partial return to work ) , and linear regression ( continuous outcomes ; e.g. , scores on depression scales ) .
in all of these analyses , intervention is the independent variable , and a propensity score [ 55,56 ] is entered as a covariate to adjust for potential confounders .
since work - productivity and perception of the work environment are conditional upon whether participants have returned to work , a pattern - mixture model analysis is applied for the analysis of these data [ 57,58 ] .
potential predictors of treatment effect predictors are assessed in two ways .
first , predictors ( e.g. , y ) are assessed through the statistical significance of the intervention by y interaction term .
second , predictors are assessed by using these variables instead of the intervention variable in the mixed model regression analysis restricted to the subgroup that was allocated to the occupational intervention condition .
cost - effectiveness cost - effectiveness is assessed from a societal perspective .
therefore , both the direct costs ( due to use of mental - health care ) and indirect costs ( due to production losses and absenteeism ) during the 1.5 - year follow - up are included .
both direct and indirect costs are estimated according to the dutch guidelines for cost - analysis in health - care research [ 59 ] .
the indirect costs are calculated by using the friction cost method [ 60 ] .
discussion this paper describes the design of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant occupational therapy , as compared to care as usual , on the work - participation of depressed employees .
considering that depression is among the top three disorders with the highest negative impact on work functioning , the lack of interventions targeting the improvement of occupational functioning is noteworthy .
only one previous study [ 15 ] , also conducted by our research group , has evaluated the effectiveness of an occupational intervention in depressed employees .
on the basis of this earlier intervention , we have developed an improved new intervention that focuses on an early return to the work environment and the acquisition of more adaptive coping strategies .
an important strength of our study is the wide range of outcome measures that will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of adjuvant occupational therapy .
few studies have included outcome measures on both the level of work - participation and work - functioning ; even fewer studies have included potential predictors of treatment effect .
to our knowledge , this is the first study to include measures to explore potential working mechanisms of treatment in this field .
this assessment enables us to evaluate a comprehensive picture of the effect of adjuvant occupational therapy in depressed employees .
a second strength of the present study is the extensive follow - up period .
in their article on improving return - to - work ( rtw ) research , pransky and colleagues [ 61 ] recommended that " research on rtw requires multiple longitudinal observations in order to fully understand the implications of the effect of an intervention targeting rtw " ( p.456 ) .
a possible limitation of our study is the lack of a waiting - list control condition .
thus , in the current study we are unable to compare our findings to a potential improvement in work functioning that might occur during the natural course of depression ( i.e. , spontaneous recovery ) .
on the other hand , it is considered unethical to deprive patients of evidence - based effective treatment , especially over the course of an 18 - month period .
previous studies have demonstrated that chances for relapse increase in untreated depression [ 62,63 ] .
another possible limitation of this study is the use of self - report measures for sickness absence data , which may be susceptible to recall bias .
in order to minimize bias , patients are asked to record the number of hours worked on a weekly basis .
previous findings have demonstrated that - when reported on a frequent basis - employee records correspond highly with employer records of absenteeism [ 64 ] .
to conclude , this study hopes to provide valuable knowledge regarding an occupational intervention for treating one of the most common and debilitating diseases of our time .
if our intervention is proven ( cost - ) effective , the personal and economic benefits for both patients and employers are far - reaching .

background several linkage analyses have mapped a susceptibility locus for diabetic nephropathy to chromosome 18q22 - 23 , and polymorphisms within the carnosine dipeptidase 1 gene ( cndp1 ) , located on 18q22.3 , have been shown to be associated with diabetic nephropathy in european subjects with type 2 diabetes .
however , the association of this locus with diabetic nephropathy has not been evaluated in the japanese population .
in this study , we examined the association of polymorphisms within the cndp1 / cndp 2 locus with diabetic nephropathy in japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes .
methodology / principal findings we genotyped a leucine repeat polymorphism ( d18s880 ) that is within cndp1 along with 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in the cndp1 / cndp2 locus for 2,740 japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes ( 1,205 nephropathy cases with overt nephropathy or with end - stage renal disease [ esrd ] , and 1,535 controls with normoalbuminuria ) .
the association of each polymorphism with diabetic nephropathy was analysed by performing logistic regression analysis .
we did not observe any association between d18s880 and diabetic nephropathy in japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes .
none of the 29 snps within the cndp1 / cndp2 locus were associated with diabetic nephropathy , but a subsequent sex - stratified analysis revealed that 1 snp in cndp1 was nominally associated with diabetic nephropathy in women ( rs12604675 - a ; p = 0.005 , odds ratio [ or ] = 1.76 , 95 % confidence interval [ ci ] , 1.19 - 2.61 ) .
rs12604675 was associated with overt proteinuria ( p = 0.002 , or = 2.18 , 95 % ci , 1.32 - 3.60 ) , but not with esrd in japanese women with type 2 diabetes .
conclusions / significance rs12604675 - a in cndp1 may confer susceptibility to overt proteinuria in japanese women with type 2 diabetes .

introduction diabetic nephropathy is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus , and is a leading cause of end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) in both western countries [ 1 ] and japan [ 2 ] .
although the precise mechanisms leading to diabetic nephropathy have not yet been elucidated , genetic susceptibility is considered to be an important factor for the development and / or progression of diabetic nephropathy [ 3 ] .
to date , many candidate genes for diabetic nephropathy have been evaluated , but most studies have produced conflicting results ; thus , the majority of diabetic nephropathy - susceptibility genes remain to be identified .
a family - based linkage study in turkish families suggested that a major susceptibility locus for diabetic nephropathy was linked to chromosome 18q22.3 - q23 [ 4 ] .
in a further study of this locus , a leucine repeat polymorphism ( d18s880 ) in the second exon of the carnosine dipeptidase 1 gene ( cndp1 ) was shown to be significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy in a relatively small number of multi - ethnic individuals ( european , arabs , and others ) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [ 5 ] .
cndp1 encodes a member of the dipeptidase family , which hydrolyses the substrate l - carnosine ( beta - alanyl - l - histidine ) .
carnosine is found in high concentrations in skeletal muscle and brain , and is thought to have antioxidant effects [ 6 ] , anti - advanced glycation end products ( age ) effects [ 7 ] , and anti - angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) effects [ 8 ] , along with a protective effect against podocyte injury [ 9 ] .
therefore , cndp1 is considered to be a plausible susceptibility gene candidate for diabetic nephropathy in this locus .
in the original report , homozygosity of a d18s880 allele containing 5 leucine repeats ( 5l ) , which is the most common allele found in europeans , was found to be associated with a low frequency of diabetic nephropathy [ 5 ] .
this association was also observed in european american subjects with type 2 diabetes [ 10 ] , whereas other studies using caucasian patients with type 1 diabetes [ 11 ] , or african americans [ 12 ] with type 2 diabetes , failed to observe the association of d18s880 with diabetic nephropathy .
in caucasian subjects with type 2 diabetes , mooyaart and colleagues showed that the effect of the d18s880 was observed only in women [ 13 ] .
therefore the association of d18s880 with diabetic nephropathy remains controversial , and contribution of this locus to diabetic nephropathy has not been evaluated in japanese subjects .
in this study , we examined the association of polymorphisms within the cndp1 / cndp2 locus , d18s880 and 29 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , with diabetic nephropathy in japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes .
materials and methods subjects and dna preparations dna samples were obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with type 2 diabetes , who regularly visited the outpatient clinics at shiga university of medical science , tokai university school of medicine , tokyo women 's medical university , osaka city general hospital , kawasaki medical school , iwate medical university school of medicine , nagahama city hospital , daini okamoto general hospital , and kawai clinic , or were obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes registered at biobank japan .
diabetes was diagnosed according to the criteria of the world health organization .
type 2 diabetes was clinically defined as a disease with a gradual adult onset .
subjects who tested positive for anti - glutamic acid decarboxylase ( gad ) antibodies and those diagnosed with mitochondrial disease ( mitochondrial myopathy , encephalopathy , lactic acidosis , and stroke - like episodes [ melas ]) or maturity - onset diabetes of the young ( mody ) were not included .
we conducted a case - control study involving 2,740 patients with type 2 diabetes , including 1,205 patients with overt nephropathy , as indicated by urinary albumin excretion rates ( aers ) of >= 200 microg / min or urinary albumin - to - creatinine ratios ( alb / cr ) of >= 300 mg / g cr , or with end stage renal disease ( esrd ) , and 1,535 controls with normoalbuminuria indicated by aers of < 20 microg / min or alb / cr of < 30 mg / g cr , and diabetic retinopathy , or with normoalbuminuria and a long duration of diabetes (> 10 years ) .
aer or acr were measured at least twice for each patient .

genotyping of d18s880 d18s880 , in exon 2 of cndp1 , was genotyped by performing a fragment length analysis on an abi 3500xl genetic analyzer ( life technologies corporation , carlsbad , ca ) .
the primers used were ; forward , 5 ' - [ 6 - fam ] - agg cag ctg tgt gag gta ac - 3 ' , reverse , 5 ' - ggg tga gga gaa cat gcc - 3 ' .
polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) product lengths of 168 bp and 165 bp , respectively , were confirmed as fragments with 6 leucine repeats and 5 leucine repeats , respectively by direct sequencing .
in each assay , the genotype of each product was compared to that of the control fragments containing 5 ctg repeats , in addition to a size standard marker .
fragment length was determined using the genemapper ( r ) software v3.7 ( life technologies corporation , carlsbad , ca ) .
snp genotyping the hapmap database ( http :// hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /) was searched for snps within the cndp1 / cndp2 locus , and 25 tagging snps were selected : rs11661606 , rs11665154 , rs11876996 , rs12326826 , rs12327522 , rs12605520 , rs12957330 , rs12964454 , rs17089368 , rs17089390 , rs17817077 , rs2241508 , rs2346064 , rs4329999 , rs4892239 , rs12604675 , rs17817095 , rs6566815 , rs7229005 , rs7239132 , rs7244647 , rs733686 , rs747174 , rs8087768 , and rs9953129 .
we also selected additional 4 snps , which were examined in a previous report [ 14 ] and not included in the above tagging snps : rs12456388 , rs2346061 , rs4891558 , and rs7244370 .
each snp genotype was analyzed using a multiplex pcr - invader assay , as previously described [ 15 ] .
genotyping success rates for all snps were over 95 % , and concordance rates in 96 randomly selected duplicated samples were 100 % .
statistical analysis descriptive analyses of characteristics data were performed using t - tests .
genotype distributions for hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( hwe ) proportions were tested using a chi2 test .
the differences between the case and control groups in terms of genotype distribution scored with an additive model were evaluated using a logistic regression analysis , adjusting for sex , age , log - transformed body mass index ( bmi ) , and duration of diabetes .
the level of significance was determined by the bonferroni 's method for correcting multiple testing errors .
under the selected 30 variants and 4 subgroup analyses ( sex stratified [ men and women ] and phenotype stratified [ proteinuria and esrd ]) , a p value of less than 0.0004 ( 0.05 divided by [ 30x4 ]) was considered statistically significant .
results we first examined the association of d18s880 with diabetic nephropathy .
as shown in table 2 , subjects with the 6l - 6l genotype were most common ( 94.3 %) , followed by subjects with the 6l - 5l genotype ( 5.5 %) , while other genotypes were very rare (< 0.1 %) in the analyzed japanese population .
there were significant differences in the genotype distribution of d18s880 between japanese and other ethnic groups , such as europeans [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 14 ] , south asians [ 16 ] , and african americans [ 12 ] .
we did not observe a significant association of d18s880 with diabetic nephropathy ( chi2 test , p = 0.58 ) in japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes .

we next examined the association of 29 snps within the cndp1 / cndp2 locus with diabetic nephropathy .
the genotype distributions of all snps did not deviate from hwe proportions , except for rs17089368 in the control ( p for hwe test = 0.013 ) , and rs9953129 in nephropathy case ( p for hwe test = 0.035 ) ( table s1 ) .
none of the 29 snps showed a significant effect on susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy ( p >= 0.05 , figure 1a , table s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 ) .
subsequent sex - stratified analysis , however , revealed that 2 snps were nominally associated with diabetic nephropathy in women ( rs12604675 - a : p = 0.005 , or = 1.760 , 95 % ci , 1.186 - 2.614 , and rs733686 - t : p = 0.022 , or = 1.333 , 95 % ci , 1.043 - 1.704 , figure 1c , table s2 ) .
interestingly , rs12604675 - a was observed to be associated with overt proteinuria ( p = 0.002 , or = 2.178 , 95 % ci , 1.318 - 3.600 , table 3 , figure s1 ) , but not associated with esrd in japanese women with type 2 diabetes .
no haplotype within this locus had a stronger association with diabetic nephropathy than rs12604675 alone in the present population ( table s6 ) .

discussion in this study , we examined the association of polymorphisms within the cndp1 / cndp2 locus with diabetic nephropathy in japanese patients with type 2 diabetes , and found that a snp in intron 5 of the cndp1 , rs12604675 ( figure s2 ) , was nominally associated with overt proteinuria in japanese women with type 2 diabetes .
results from several linkage analyses suggested the existence of a susceptibility locus to diabetic nephropathy on chromosome 18q22.3 - q23 [ 4 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] .
cndp1 , located at 18q22.3 , encodes carnosinase 1 , which is found in human plasma and brain and degrades carnosine , homocarnosine [ 19 ] .
carnosine has been reported to protect against renal injury , along with having antioxidant activity [ 6 ] , inhibition of age formation [ 7 ] , and ace inhibition property [ 8 ] , suggesting that cndp1 contributes to conferring susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy .
a trinucleotide repeat ( leucine repeat ) polymorphism , d18s880 , in exon 2 of cndp1 was previously reported to be associated with diabetic nephropathy .
patients with homozygous alleles containing 5 leucine repeats were shown to be less susceptible to diabetic nephropathy , and to have lower serum carnosinase activities as compared to individuals with other genotypes [ 5 ] .
it was also shown in cos cells that cndp1 secretion was significantly higher in the cells expressing cndp1 variants with more than 5 leucines [ 20 ] .
however , in the present japanese population , we did not observe any association of this leucine repeat polymorphism with diabetic nephropathy .
there were remarkable differences in the genotype frequencies of d18s880 between the japanese population and other ethnic groups , with the protective 5l - 5l genotype being the most common ( 23 - 41 %) , in european [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 14 ] , south asian [ 16 ] , or african american populations [ 12 ] , whereas individuals with the 5l - 5l genotype were very rare in the present japanese population (< 0.1 %) .
the results of our genotyping for d18s880 were validated by direct sequencing of fragments corresponding to either the 5l or 6l allele , and validated using a control genotype from genomic dna extracted from human embryonic kidney ( hek293 ) cells , derived from a caucasian individual identified as 5l - 5l in our fragment analysis ( data not shown ) .
in addition , the genotype distribution of d18s880 in the present study is similar to that in chinese peritoneal dialysis patients [ 21 ] , with frequencies of 5l - 5l and 6l - 6l at 0.9 % and 80 % respectively .
therefore , differences in the genotype distribution between east asian populations and other ethnic populations truly exists , and may be a principal cause for the discrepancy between the results of the previous study and the present japanese study .
to further evaluate the contribution of this locus to diabetic nephropathy susceptibility , we examined the association of 29 snps , including 25 tagging snps , with diabetic nephropathy .
the results indicated that 2 snps in cndp1 , rs12604675 and rs733686 , were nominally associated with diabetic nephropathy only in women .
these 2 snps were in weak ld ( r2 = 0.04 ) , but a conditional analysis including both snps using a logistic model revealed that the association of rs12604675 was still significant after conditioning ( p = 0.0309 ) , whereas the association of rs733686 was no longer significant after conditioning ( p = 0.1029 ) , indicating that these 2 snps were not independent , and that rs12604675 is probably more closely linked to disease susceptibility .
since , of many genes reported to be susceptible to diabetic nephropathy , some had similarly affected both proteinuria and esrd but the others had not .
therefore , we next performed phenotype - stratified analyses , proteinuria or esrd .
interestingly , rs12604675 - a was associated with overt proteinuria , but not with esrd in japanese women with type 2 diabetes .
discrepancies in genomic loci underlying susceptibility to proteinuria versus esrd have previously been noted in a genome - wide linkage study for diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes [ 22 ] .
as most of the patients with esrd were considered to have had proteinuria , some selection bias , such as a survival effect , may have existed when patients with esrd were included .
since the presence of proteinuria is also recognized as a predictor of cardiovascular diseases , the association of rs12604675 with proteinuria may reflect an association between the gene and cardiovascular diseases or metabolic syndrome instead .
though it remains unknown why the association of cndp1 snps with diabetic nephropathy was observed only in women , there are several reports demonstrating that the effects of cndp1 variants are more significant in women than in men [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 23 ] .
there are several possibilities to explain the predominant effect of cndp1 variants in women .
first , it has been reported that there are differences in muscle carnosine content between men and women , with muscle carnosine content in men shown to be higher than that in women [ 24 ] .
since it has also been shown that carnosine content in the muscle of female mice is elevated approximately 2.5 - fold after administration of testosterone [ 25 ] , tissue carnosine contents have been considered to be regulated by the anabolic action of testosterone , which may mask the effect of cndp1 variants in men .
second , in the present population , men had a higher risk than women for diabetic nephropathy ( p = 4.96x10 - 5 , or = 1.39 , 95 % ci , 1.19 - 1.64 ) .
therefore , the effects of rs12604675 on conferring susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy may also be masked in men .
the elucidation of a precise mechanism will require further investigation .
ahluwalia et al. reported the association of 2 snps located in the regulatory region of cndp1 and cndp2 , rs2346061 and rs7577 , with diabetic nephropathy in swedish subjects with type 2 diabetes [ 14 ] .
they also found a haplotype consisting of 3 snps ( rs7244370 in addition to the above - mentioned 2 snps ) , which was associated with a 3 - fold increased risk of diabetic nephropathy .
another study in american indians with type 2 diabetes found nominal association of 2 snps within cndp1 , rs12957330 and rs17817077 , with esrd [ 26 ] .
we analyzed these snps in the present study of japanese patients with type 2 diabetes .
the results indicated that rs7577 was monoallelic in the japanese , and we also did not observe the association of either the snps or the haplotype ( rs2346061 [ c ] - rs7244370 [ g ]) .
since nephropathy cases in the swedish study included patients with microalbuminuria , the discrepancy between the results of those studies and our study may be explained by phenotype differences and / or ethnic differences .
there were some potential limitations in this study .
first , in this association study , we recruited participants who met the criteria of case and control as many as possible to avoid the reduction of study power , and did not perform matching procedures .
as a result , there were significant differences in age , sex ratio between the nephropathy cases and controls .
although we adjusted these parameters by including them in a same logistic model in our association study , these mismatches might affect the results of our association study .
second , sample size in the present study was not sufficiently large enough to detect smaller effect loci .
the present japanese sample has 100 % power for most snps with or >= 2.0 , whereas , for snps with or of 1.10 , estimated power is less than 50 % ( table s7 , cats power calculator , cats : http :// www.sph.umich.edu / csg / abecasis / cats /)] .
third , rs12604675 , with suggestive evidence for an association in the present study , was not examined in swedish or american indian populations , and the association of rs12604675 in the present study did not overcome correction for multiple testing errors .
therefore , the association of rs12604675 needs to be further evaluated in independent samples .
in conclusion , on performing an extensive analysis for analyzing the association of the cndp1 / cndp2 locus with diabetic nephropathy in japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes , we obtained suggestive evidence that rs12604675 - a contributes to susceptibility to overt proteinuria in japanese women with type 2 diabetes , although the conclusion in this study need to be validated in an independent cohort .

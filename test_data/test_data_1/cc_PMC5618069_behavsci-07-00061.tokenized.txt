i deal with perception and action ( e.g. , movements ) using results from synergetics , a comprehensive mathematical theory of the self - organized formation ( emergence ) of spatial , temporal , or functional structures in complex systems .
i illustrate basic concepts such as order parameters ( ops ) , enslavement , complexity reduction , circular causality first by examples of well - known collective , spontaneous modes of human behavior such as rhythmic clapping of hands , and so forth , and then by face recognition .
the role played by ops depends on context .
in the case of face ( or pattern ) recognition an op represents the concept of an individual face ( action of mind ) and it enslaves the action ( firing rates ) of neurons ( body ) .
this insight allows me to interpret syndromes as order parameters playing their mind / body double role .
i present criteria for the identification of ops and discuss their general properties including error correction and remedy of deficiencies .
contact is made with a recent paper by sabine koch on embodied aesthetics .
my approach includes the saturation of attention at various time scales ( ambiguous figures / fashion ) .
adopting a psychological perspective , i discuss some ingredients of beauty such as proportionality and symmetry , but also the importance of irregularities .
pattern recognition order parameters aesthetics 1 .
introduction while the readers of my paper are surely familiar with what behavioral science is about , this need not be so concerning synergetics and why it may be of interest to behavioral science .
synergetics (" science of cooperation ") [ 1,2 ] is an interdisciplinary field of research that deals with complex systems that can spontaneously produce spatial , temporal , or functional structures ( figure 1 ) .
the considered systems are composed of many individual parts that exchange energy , matter , and / or information among each other , as well as with the surrounding of the total system ( figure 2 ) .
these systems acquire their structures by self - organization , that is , without any specific interference from the outside , say , by a sculptor .
synergetics is grounded in mathematics ( dynamic systems theory , theory of stochastic processes , phase transition theory , and information theory ) and has developed its own specific concepts .
synergetics has found numerous applications in physics , chemistry , biology and , in particular , behavioral science , for example , movement coordination and recognition of faces , facial expression and of movements .
thus , a common ground between behavioral science and synergetics is - - i think - - the study of the relations between a specific " behavioral pattern " as a whole and its individual constituents .
the whole may be a social group and the individual constituents persons , or the whole may be a human brain and the constituents its neurons , just to mention two examples that are relevant for my paper .
the central aim of synergetics is to cast these relations , based on realistic models , into a mathematical form which allows quantitative treatments .
as it has turned out there is a clear - cut correspondence between a conceptual approach that can be verbalized , and a formal mathematical treatment .
in my paper i will present the conceptual approach .
my paper is organized as follows .
section 2 has little to do with synergetics .
nevertheless , i state that ( embodied ) aesthetics necessitates a definition of beauty , but argue why there are no criteria for beauty .
section 3 presents basic concepts of synergetics , starting from well - known examples of collective human behavior , and then dealing with face recognition and movement coordination .
section 4 deals with order parameters and embodiment , while section 5 returns to the question of beauty and its psychological consequences .
the concluding section 6 makes contact with a recent paper by sabine koch [ 3 ] on embodied aesthetics .
her paper also contains numerous references that may serve as background information for parts of my paper that deal with beauty and / or embodiment .
i assume that my readers are familiar with her paper so that i do not duplicate these references .
2. what is beauty ?
nature abounds with objects that we perceive as beautiful , such as flowers , animals , landscapes .
we look at beautiful artefacts such as paintings , sculptures , architecture and we may be delighted by poetry and music .
we may perceive movements as beautiful , such as the elegant trot of a horse , and still more the dancing of people .
at a more abstract level , mathematicians speak of beautiful formulae , and physicists may consider their laws as beautiful. and more generally , people are delighted by new insights , or discoveries .
yet , a scientific study of aesthetics and its embodiment requires a definition of beauty .
whenever i met the famous art historian sir ernest gombrich ( 1909 - 2001 ) who had studied psychology , i asked him : what are the criteria for beauty ?
each time he replied : there are no criteria for beauty !
why ?
surely there are several reasons for that .
here i want to discuss one reason that appears to me most likely .
to this end , let us forget " beauty " for the moment and consider an ambivalent picture such as figure 3 .
our perception oscillates back and forth between the interpretations " vase " or " faces " .
in 1920 , the gestalt psychologist wolfgang kohler [ 4 ] proposed an explanation : when we have recognized an object , our attention for this object fades away and we are able to recognize the other object , and so on ( a detailed mathematical model of this process was presented by ditzinger and haken [ 5 ]) .
while here the switching time between percepts is a few seconds , in other cases it may be much longer .
a typical example is provided by fashion .
first a new style is created , which is followed by an ever increasing number of people - - until they get bored and require a new style .
thus an excitement / boredom cycle results .
this deep - rooted human trait is well reflected by the latin proverb " variatio delectate " or by poetry , for example , by goethe 's faust : " werd ich zum augenblicke sagen : verweile doch !
du bist so schon !
dann magst du mich in fesseln schlagen , dann will ich gern zugrunde gehen !/ when i say to the moment flying : linger a while - - thou art so fair !
then bind me in thy bonds undying , and my final ruin i will bear !" in section 5 , i will discuss what that means for some ingredients of beauty .
however , more importantly , we must be aware of at least one conclusion for the relation between therapist and client : does their understanding of what beauty is coincide ? and , does it persist ( e.g. , does boredom arise ?) in the present context we may interpret " beauty " in a wide sense as the property of an object or happening that causes good feelings , excitement , delight , harmony , etc .
in the recipient .
3. basic concepts of synergetics synergetics deals with complex systems , that form spatial , temporal , spatio - temporal or functional structures by self - organization .
in the present context , a number of insights gained by the mathematical approach of synergetics can be visualized by examples of spontaneous collective human behavior .
( a ) formation of spatial structures ( patterns ) consider swimmers in a swimming pool .
if there are few swimmers , they may swim quite independently of each other in various directions ( disordered state ) .
if the number of swimmers , that is , their density increases beyond a critical value , in the disordered state the swimmers impede each other so much that they acquire an ordered mode , namely , they swim in circles .
this may happen spontaneously , that is , without any given orders from the outside .
first , few swimmers begin swimming in circles , then more and more swimmers join them ( figure 4 ) .
anyone who enters the pool is automatically forced to join the collective , ordered motion .
spatial patterns are well known in the animal kingdom : flocks of birds , schools of fish , to mention but two examples .
( b ) formation of temporal structures ( patterns ) when , after a concert , the listeners get enthusiastic , quite often the following happens : while first the clapping of hands is quite irregular , suddenly few people start clapping their hands rhythmically until very quickly the whole audience claps rhythmically .
a further example is provided by people walking across an elastic bridge that can oscillate .
then quite often they synchronize their pace so to enhance the oscillation of the bridge .
they enjoy feeling the resonance !
an example of the animal kingdom is provided by the rhythmic blinking of fire flies .
( c ) formation of spatio - temporal structures ( patterns ) spectators in an arena may spontaneously form a " la ola " wave .
first , along some line , people stand up , others at their side follow and then those who got up first , sit down .
in this way people generate a " wave " running around the arena .
these simple examples may allow me to formulate general concepts of synergetics .
( 1 ) control parameters they are fixed quantities that are externally or internally prescribed .
in the example ( a ) the control parameter is the density of swimmers ; in the examples ( b ) , ( c ) , it is the internal excitement of the participants .
when a control parameter exceeds some threshold , the old state of the total system is abandoned and replaced by a new one .
in other words , ( 2 ) the old state becomes unstable .
( 3 ) close to such instability " points " the formation of a new structure ( pattern ) is triggered by some spontaneous events ( e.g. , rhythmic clapping of hands of only few people ) .
( 4 ) the new ordered state is characterized by an order parameter .
it plays a double role : it describes the macroscopic state and it prescribes the action of the individual parts .
( 5 ) slaving principles .
one or few order parameters determine ( enslave ) the behavior of the individual parts ( figure 5 ) ( e.g. , swimmers follow the circular motion , listeners join the collective hand clapping ) .
these examples may indicate that there are different grades of the " strength " of " enslavement " .
i have discussed the sociological implications of the " enslavement " notion at various occasions , because many sociologists strongly criticize this notion stressing that humans are free in their decisions .
( 6 ) complexity reduction instead of describing the actions of the numerous parts it suffices to deal with the order parameter ( s ) .
complexity reduction is crucial to face ( or pattern ) recognition , movement control , and sensory / motor action , among others .
( 7 ) circular causality this concept is rather counterintuitive because it contradicts our understanding of the conventional cause - - effect relation .
however , in the case of self - organization the order parameters enslave the individual parts , while the parts through their joint action , generate the order parameters .
however , just think of the hand clapping : each participant hears ( perceives ) the collective hand clapping , but at the same time she / he produces this effect .
visualization of the " behavior " of order parameters in quite a number of cases the " behavior " , or precisely speaking , the dynamics of order parameters can be visualized by an attractor landscape .
an example is provided by figure 6 .
on the abscissa , we plot the size of the considered order parameter , op. we represent its motion ( dynamics ) by the motion of a ball that rolls down a grassy hill so that it may come to rest at the bottom of the valley .
the ordinate , called v , may be identified with the height of the position of the ball .
figure 6.1 represents a situation where the op is zero , indicating a structureless or disordered state ( think of the irregular motion of swimmers in a pool ) .
when a control parameter is increased ( e.g. , density of swimmers ) , in the mathematical model the bottom of the valley becomes quite flat .
( figure 6.2 ) .
since the ball is subject to random fluctuations (" kicks ") , it moves randomly considerably away from the position of op = 0 .
this effect is called critical fluctuations and is a precursor to phase - transitions where a new structure appears ( figure 6.3 ). that is to say that with further increase of the control parameter two new valleys appear that entail two new stable values of the op , of which only one can be realized .
in the concrete " swimmer model " this means that the swimmers now swim clockwise or anticlockwise .
the observation of critical fluctuations of the behavior of patients may play an important role in neurology ( e.g. , in a number of cases such fluctuations may be indicators of evolving epileptic seizures ) .
the attractor landscape model may serve to discuss " saturation " effects .
according to tschacher [ 6 ] , the slope of a valley may represent the degree of intentionality acting as control parameter ( figure 7a ) .
when the corresponding task has been fulfilled and the control parameter is zero , the slope vanishes ( figure 7b ) .
attractors that vanish while the corresponding op is built up have been termed quasi - attractors by haken [ 7 ] , in particular in the context of the recognition of ambiguous patterns .
first , in the presence of the corresponding valley , an op increases beyond a critical size ( the conscious state ) until the valley and with it the op vanish .
after some time the valley is reestablished .
4. order parameters and embodiment to elucidate the role of order parameters in embodiment , we consider the example of face recognition .
in this case , an observer is able to recognize a face though it may be partly obscured .
he / she is able to complete this percept in his / her mind and associate a name with this face .
thus face recognition is conceived as action of associate memory , or , on a more abstract level , as the completion of a set of incomplete features ( data ) to a set of complete features ( data ) according to stored prototype patterns [ 8 ] .
an example is shown in figure 8 , where the family names are encoded by letters .
the individual patterns are represented by their pixel grey values .
the grey values of any shown image ( figure 9 , left hand side ) are encoded as neural excitations that are transmitted to the neural network of the brain ( figure 9 , right hand side ) , where they are further processed .
the pattern recognition process is modeled by a pulse - coupled neural network that i have dealt with elsewhere in great detail [ 9 ] .
in the context of my present paper , the following results are relevant : as it turns out , consistently with the mathematical treatment of the network , we may ascribe an order parameter xik to each pattern k = 1 ,... , 5 ( figure 8 ) .
when an incomplete pattern ( figure 10 ) is offered to the network , a competition between the order parameters evolves that can be visualized as motion of a representative point ( ball ) in an attractor landscape .
this competition is eventually won by an order parameter that " enslaves " the individual neurons of the network so that a complete pattern emerges ( figure 11 ) .
to put it cautiously : these results strongly suggest that the order parameters play a double role - - they represent the perceived object , that is , action of mind .
simultaneously they enslave the collective action of neurons : a body - action ( figure 12 ) .
my approach strongly supports spinoza 's view that mind and body ( matter ) represent the two sides of the same coin ( which i identify with an order parameter ) .
quite clearly , this view is in contrast to descartes 's view on the dichotomy between mind and body .
so far , i have represented the example of visual patterns .
my approach holds also for movement or behavioral patterns .
in all these cases , the prototype patterns may be learned or can be of an archetypical nature .
since the order parameter concept holds also for group dynamics ( of people or animals ) , it might be an interesting speculation to ascribe some kind of mind also to groups , some kind of consciousness to collectives , so to speak .
while in psychology we can verify the concept of consciousness by personal individual introspection , this " tool " is absent in sociology .
it is important to note that the role ( meaning ) of order parameters ( ops ) depends on the context .
to underline this statement , consider movement patterns produced by a human with his / her coordination between limbs and / or body motion .
an explicit example is provided by experiments of kelso [ 10 ] , who instructed subjects to move their index fingers in parallel at a slow speed ( figure 13 ) .
when the prescribed speed was increased more and more , quite involuntarily the parallel movement switched to an antiparallel , symmetric one .
this spontaneous switch was modeled by means of an order parameter dynamics in an approach by haken , kelso , bunz [ 11 ] that has become paradigmatic in the field of movement coordination .
in this model , the order parameter can be identified as relative phase between the index fingers .
in further experiments by kelso and his coworkers and the theoretical work of my group , we could demonstrate that acoustic perception , movement coordination , and activity of the cns ( central nervous system ) are governed by only two order parameters [ 10 ] .
these ops govern at the next level perception and action , each represented by the corresponding ops , which in turn " enslave " the elements participating in perception and the elements participating in action ( figure 14 ) .
5. criteria for ops and syndromes for a conceptualization and mathematical modeling we need criteria for ops .
quite generally , ops refer to the total system .
in particular , they refer to the coordination ( spatial , temporal , functional ) between the parts of the studied system .
moreover , a time - scale separation holds. that is to say , ops change slowly , whereas parts change fast .
this can be checked by means of their reaction time to perturbations .
additionally , while a change of ops causes a change of the behavior of the parts , a change of a part ( or a minority of parts ) has practically no effect on the ops ( just think of the hand clapping example !) .
the joint action of an order parameter and the slaving principle is visualized in figure 15 .
in particular , we may ascribe measurable values vl,l = 1 ,... , n to the individual parts .
an order parameter governs a whole configuration (" pattern ") of vs. if a configuration is incomplete , the order parameter serves for a complete configuration or it is able to correct errors ( e.g. , of texts ) .
it can serve for synchrony between the parts in oscillating systems .
some time ago i suggested that an order parameter represents a syndrome , where the vs represent a set of manifestations that may belong to mind or body ( figure 16 ) .
again , a syndrome may serve for completion of manifestations and synchrony .
order parameters may even " govern " interpersonal relations , for example , in an alliance between client and therapist .
a central question concerns the quantification of emotions and their measurements .
well - known examples are measurements ( observations ) of skin resistance , heartbeat , blood pressure , " goose skin " , eye movements , but also analysis of facial expressions ( e.g. , ekman classification ) or / and of gestures , and speech characteristics .
eeg , meg , fmri measurements allow the study of brain activities , especially of their localization and correlations. by these and other methods ( e.g. , extra - cranial excitations ) specific areas could be identified , for example , nucleus accumbens ( enjoyment ) , amygdala ( disgust , fear ) .
the data can be supplemented by personal ratings .
while i think it is at least plausible to consider intrapersonal ratings as ( more or less ) reliable , i believe that interpersonal ratings are highly questionable due to the qualia problem .
based on quantification , promising models of psychological processes have been developed by schiepek et al .
[ 12 ] , tschacher et al .
[ 13 ] and others .
6. some basic ingredients of beauty though i have stressed the absence of criteria for beauty ( section 2 ) there seem to be at least some ingredients of beauty that have endured over the centuries .
one aspect is proportionality , the other one symmetry .
in the latter case , there may be mirror symmetry ( figure 17 ) , translation symmetry ( figure 18 ) or rotation symmetry ( figure 19 ) .
the latter symmetries are connected by repetitions .
interestingly , these symmetric patterns can be observed in many self - organizing systems ranging from fluids over macroscopic chemical reactions to plants and animals .
what is the psychological impact of such regularities ?
they strengthen confidence , they make us calm .
this is in line with the idea that the human mind , consciously or unconsciously , is all the time trying to unearth ( general ) rules that allow it to extrapolate , that is , to foresee , what will be next .
obviously , regularities facilitate this process .
incidentally , however , ( too much ) regularity generates boredom !
thus , an artwork needs " surprises " , namely , breaking of symmetry ( as exemplified by picasso 's faces ) , irregularities , unusual combinations of elements , and so forth .
the weights of order and disorder , expectation and surprise are changing in the course of time , though each epoch seems to prefer a specific balance between order / disorder .
clearly , my remarks have some consequences on therapies based on embodied aesthetics - - for some clients it may be preferable to strengthen the " order / regularity " , for others , the " excitement / variation " aspect .
7. conclusions in my paper i have tried to give a brief outline of the concepts and results of synergetics .
according to it , external conditions ( represented by control parameters ) may lead to a qualitative change of the macroscopic behavior of a complex system .
at least at these instances the behavior of the system is governed by one or very few order parameters that govern (" enslave ") the individual parts via circular causality .
in this way , a perception - action cycle is governed by an order parameter .
this implies that this cycle can be initiated by the impact of a control parameter on action or perception , or both of them .
this order parameter approach can be immediately transferred to the circular model of embodied aesthetics by sabine koch [ 3 ] , where the interplay between person and art ( mediated by impression and expression ) is now ( in my approach ) governed by an order parameter .
as it seems to me , in this way the " re - invokation of the old concept of the ' soul ' in order to grasp the holistic aspects of the arts " , ( as suggested by sabine koch ) may be substantiated .
in the process , the therapist acts as " control parameter " by his / her incentives , providing specific surrounding , and so forth .
in conclusion , a warning should be added : the order parameter concept is seductive because of its seeming generality .
so always some care must be exercised when applying it. acknowledgments the author thanks wolfgang tschacher for a critical reading of the manuscript .

oligonucleotide microarrays allow for high - throughput gene expression profiling assays .
the technology relies on the fundamental assumption that observed hybridization signal intensities ( hsis ) for each intended target , on average , correlate with their target 's true concentration in the sample .
however , systematic , nonbiological variation from several sources undermines this hypothesis .
background hybridization signal has been previously identified as one such important source , one manifestation of which appears in the form of spatial autocorrelation. results .
we propose an algorithm , pyn , for the elimination of spatial autocorrelation in hsis , exploiting the duality of desirable mutual information shared by probes in a common probe set and undesirable mutual information shared by spatially proximate probes .
we show that this correction procedure reduces spatial autocorrelation in hsis ; increases hsi reproducibility across replicate arrays ; increases differentially expressed gene detection power ; and performs better than previously published methods. conclusions .
the proposed algorithm increases both precision and accuracy , while requiring virtually no changes to users' current analysis pipelines : the correction consists merely of a transformation of raw hsis ( e.g. , cel files for affymetrix arrays ) .
a free , open - source implementation is provided as an r package , compatible with standard bioconductor tools .
the approach may also be tailored to other platform types and other sources of bias .
1. background microarray technology , a fairly recent yet already well - established and extensively dissected method , allows for the simultaneous quantification of expression levels of entire genomes or subsets thereof [ 1 ] .
in situ oligonucleotide arrays are by far the most popular type , representing at the time of writing 70 % of all arrays deposited in the gene expression omnibus ( geo ) , a public microarray database , in the last year ; of these , 58 % are affymetrix genechips [ 2 ] .
these are designed such that each gene is targeted by multiple perfectly complementary oligonucleotide probes at various locations along its sequence ( forming a probe set ) ; copies of each of these probes are covalently linked to a solid surface at a predetermined location on a grid ; a labelled rna sample is allowed to hybridize to each of these probes ; and finally a hybridization signal intensity ( hsi ) is obtained for each probe [ 3 ] .
the technology relies on the assumption that , on average , hsis observed in a given probe set correlate with the true concentration of the given mrna species in the biological sample , that is , the true expression level of the targeted gene .
variations on this architecture exist ; for example , tiling arrays , are designed such that probes target contiguous regions of a genome , usually without regard for transcript annotations [ 4 ] .
because the objective of such experiments is generally to assess gene expression differences between one or more biological samples , separating biologically interesting variation from all other sources of obscuring variation is of utmost importance [ 5 ] ; consequently , this has been a major focus of microarray research in the last decade .
whereas random error ( i.e. , noise ) can be estimated via sample variance and cancelled out by some form of averaging , systematic errors introduce biases in the data that cannot be estimated without an independent source of information and cannot be explicitly corrected for without being estimated [ 6 ] .
as has been shown repeatedly , there are several important sources of systematic errors - - notably arising from rna sample preparation [ 7 ] ; probe - target binding efficiency [ 8 ] , specificity [ 9 ] , and spatial uniformity [ 10 - 14 ] ; secondary structure in probes [ 15 ] and transcripts [ 16 ] , and other thermodynamic properties [ 17 ] such as gc content [ 18 ] ; scanner calibration [ 19 ] ; and algorithmic processing of raw image data [ 20 ] - - and underestimating their effect on analyses leads to tangible consequences [ 21 ] .
an initial attempt to address nonuniform " background intensity " was incorporated directly in the design of the genechip platform : for each " perfect match " ( pm ) probe , there is a corresponding " mismatch " ( mm ) probe which features a single different base [ 3 ] .
the intention was twofold : to correct for specificity biases , by assuming each pm / mm pair would share nonspecific hybridization signal , while only the pm probe would exhibit specific signal , and to correct for spatial biases , by making each pm / mm pair physically adjacent on the array .
in practice , mm probes contain significant specific signal and do not share common nonspecific background with their respective pm probes ; in fact , early studies found that approximately one - third of mm intensities are greater than their pm counterpart [ 22 , 23 ] , which is evidently incompatible with their stated purpose .
in recent years , mm intensities have largely been ignored , and recent array designs by affymetrix do not include them [ 24 ] .
current popular methods make no attempt to correct for either of these biases .
in order to make data from multiple arrays directly comparable , normalization methods such as locally weighted scatterplot smoothing ( lowess or loess ) [ 25 - 28 ] and bolstad et al. ' s quantile normalization algorithm [ 27 ] have been proposed and are currently widely regarded as essential preprocessing steps .
the former modifies the hsis such that a log hsi ratio versus mean log hsi plot becomes locally linear , while the latter forces the hsis from each array in the experiment to follow the same distribution .
it is important to note , then , that neither of these methods attempts to correct for any specific source of obscuring variation , but rather they make a general attempt to craft the raw data from separate arrays such that they become more directly comparable , inevitably discarding information in the process .
it has been noted that the choice of background correction methodology has a significant impact on downstream analysis accuracy [ 29 ] , which implies that nonspecific hybridization and spatial nonuniformity should not be ignored .
we focus here exclusively on the latter ; the reader is referred to [ 30 - 32 ] for treatments of the former .
a few methods addressing spatial biases in spotted cdna arrays have been proposed .
dudoit et al. proposed the only such method to gain wide acceptance in the community , which consists of applying the loess - based intensity - dependent bias correction method individually within each print - tip group [ 25 , 26 , 33 ] .
colantuoni et al. proposed to subtract a 2d loess fit of intensities on the array surface [ 34 ] , while workman et al. similarly subtract an estimate of local bias based on a 2d weighted moving average with a gaussian kernel [ 35 ] , and wilson et al. fit a loess curve on the ma plot as in dudoit et al. ' s study , but then adjust it by smoothing residuals spatially on the array [ 36 ] .
various other methods have also been published [ 37 , 38 ] .
some methods have been proposed in the case of in situ oligonucleotide arrays as well , although none is commonly used .
reimers and weinstein proposed to visualize spatial biases by computing the deviation of each probe intensity from a robust average of that probe 's intensity across all arrays in the experiment and plotting these values on the array surface [ 10 ] ; suarez - farinas et al. used these to identify array regions to discard [ 11 ] .
upton and lloyd propose to subtract the smallest intensity around each probe on the array surface [ 12 ] .
arteaga - salas et al. essentially combine the ideas of reimers and weinstein and those of upton and lloyd to come up with an algorithm : subtract , from each probe intensity , the average local deviation from the average intensity across replicate arrays , that is , an estimate of locally induced , array - specific error [ 13 ] .
various other methods have also been published [ 14 ] , some of which are applicable only to specific platforms , such as cgh arrays [ 39 ] and snp arrays [ 40 ] .
the currently advocated standard operating procedure with respect to the well - known issue of spatial bias in in situ oligonucleotide array data , when one is used at all , consists of performing quality control steps to identify arrays deemed to be beyond arbitrary acceptability thresholds , and discarding these while leaving others intact [ 10 ] .
while this may appear to reduce noise on affected probes , it also silently increases noise globally by decreasing replication , and there is comparatively little information on any given gene to begin with [ 41 ] .
discarding array regions or even individual probes [ 10 , 11 , 42 ] may alleviate this issue somewhat , though this merely shifts the issue to a lower level .
several studies have concluded that most , if not all , arrays are affected by spatial bias , regardless of platform [ 14 ] .
we believe that very few of these are likely to be truly unrecoverable ; thus , we propose to correct all arrays without prejudice .
we posit that a priori information about sources of systematic variation , in the form of known relationships between probes , can be exploited to identify , quantify , visualize , and effectively correct probe - level systematic errors .
here , we present an algorithm , pyn , to correct for sources of obscuring variation dependent on spatial location of probes on the array .
the algorithm works by leveraging the power of expected mutual information found in probe sets with that of unexpected mutual information found in spatially proximate probes .
2. methods 2.1 .
algorithm using notation inspired by [ 22 ] , let y ijn be the log2 - transformed hsi of probe j = 1 ,... , j n belonging to probe set n = 1 ,... , n , on array i = 1 ,... , i. error estimates for observed intensities can then be expressed as deviation from some given intensity estimator ( 1 ) rijn = yijn - y ^ in , and we propose the following estimator : ( 2 ) y ^ in = 1jnsumjyijn .
the probe residual , r ijn , is thus simply the deviation of each hsi from the mean observed in its probe set on the same array .
in justifying the use of spike - in and dilution datasets for assessing accuracy , cope et al. assert that " to estimate bias in measurements , we need truth , in an absolute or relative form , or at least a different , more accurate measurement of the same samples " [ 6 ] .
we propose two extensions to this view : first , a priori information about relationships between probes provides a form of relative truth ; and second , this bias estimate is better used as a correction term than as an accuracy assessment .
although a given probe residual merely quantifies one hsi 's deviation from an estimate and thus contains contributions from many probe - specific biases ( e.g. , binding efficiency and specificity ) and random noise , a sufficiently large pool of probe residuals with similar locations on the array provides a summary of the average bias induced by such a location .
noting that residuals ( and accordingly means of residuals ) share units and scale with hsis , we thus simply propose to subtract this estimate of location - induced bias from each hsi to obtain corrected signals : ( 3 ) yijn *= yijn - r ^ ijn , where ( 4 ) r ^ ijn = 1ksumj'n'inknn ( jn ) rij'n ' , and knn ( jn ) returns the k nearest neighbours of probe jn , physically on the array , in terms of euclidian distance .
it is of theoretical interest to note that , as k increases , the computed estimates of local bias tend to approach a constant as they become less local and approach a global measure on the entire array ; in the limiting case , where k - - > sumn j n , the correction factor is almost exactly zero. of practical interest is that this is also the expected behaviour in the case of an ideal array ( lacking spatial bias ) with a reasonable k. the optimal choice of k , the only free parameter of our algorithm , is explored in the results section .
when a value is not given in the text , k = 20 is to be assumed .
2.2 .
data in this paper , three typical affymetrix human genome u133a datasets are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm : two datasets obtained from the public microarray repository geo [ 2 ] and a well - known benchmark dataset ; these are referred to in the text as " gse1400 ," " gse2189 ," and " spike - in ," respectively .
the gse1400 experiment compares two samples , with three replicates each : rna associated with membrane - bound polysomes and rna associated with free polysomes [ 44 ] .
the gse2189 experiment assesses the impact of the chemotherapeutic drug motexafin gadolinium relative to an untreated control sample , at three time points , with three replicates for each of these six samples [ 45 ] .
in the spike - in experiment , 42 transcripts are spiked in at 14 different concentrations , arranged in a latin square design across 14 arrays , such that each transcript is spiked in once at each concentration , with three replicates for each array [ 46 ] .
for practical reasons , some results present data for only one array per dataset ; in these cases , the arrays in question are gsm23121 , gsm39803 , and expt1 _ r1 , respectively .
2.3 .
implementation an implementation of the proposed spatial correction procedure is provided as part of an r package (" pyn ") , with critical parts written in c ++ for efficiency .
an " affybatch " object (" batch ") can be replaced with a corrected version by running the following command within an r session : > batch < - normalize .
pyn ( batch ) the procedure runs for approximately one second per array ( intel core 2 duo 3.33 ghz ) and accepts any valid affybatch object , independent of array platform .
the user can then proceed with his usual analysis pipeline , for example , " rma " and " limma. " the package also contains some utility functions for generating assessment figures similar to those found in this paper ; users are referred to the package 's internal documentation for instructions .
the package is released under a bsd license and is available at http :// lemieux.iric.ca / pyn / .
2.4 .
alternative methods in this paper , " cpp " and " lpe " refer to the two algorithms proposed by arteaga - salas et al. in [ 13 ] ; implementations provided by dr. arteaga - salas were used as they are , with default parameters .
" upton - lloyd " refers to the method proposed in [ 12 ] ; as code was not made available by its authors , we used our own implementation , which is provided for convenience in the r package made available with this paper , as the function " upton.lloyd.2005. " we now briefly describe these three algorithms .
2.4.1 .
lpe for each probe on each array in a batch , a value similar to our residual is computed , relating the deviation of the probe 's intensity from its median intensity across all arrays .
a " code " is then computed for each probe , which identifies the array where this value is the largest and whether it is positive or negative .
then , to determine whether a given location in a batch of arrays is affected by spatial bias , pm and mm probes in a 5 x 5 window are inspected ; if an " unusual " number of these exhibit the same code , the location on the array identified by this code is flagged for correction .
finally , for each flagged location , a standardized average of the previously defined deviations within its window is subtracted .
2.4.2 .
cpp residuals are computed for each probe on each array as in lpe , but the authors require in this case for all arrays to be replicates of one another .
each pm intensity is corrected by subtracting its mm counterpart 's residual and vice versa .
residuals are scaled before subtraction to address differences in pm and mm distributions .
2.4.3 .
upton - lloyd from each intensity at a given location on an array , the smallest intensity found in a ( 2m + 1 ) x ( 2m + 1 ) window is centred on it is subtracted ; if the result is negative , it is replaced with zero .
the authors find that m = 1 works best .
3. results figure 1 shows the empirical distribution of probe residuals in each of the 66 arrays found in the three datasets described in the data subsection .
in all cases , the residuals appear to follow an approximately normal distribution with sample mean near zero (| mu | < 10 - 17 ) .
the parameters of this distribution vary from one array to another , based on their intensity distributions , which notably vary in offset (" background intensity ") and scale (" dynamic range ") ; however , arrays in a common " batch " usually share these parameters .
thus , identifying outliers in residual distributions within a batch may be useful in identifying arrays significantly affected by spatial bias .
under the assumption that probes are randomly located on the array , these residuals are expected to be randomly spatially distributed across the array ; thus , any spatial patterns must be ascribable to some form of technical error .
in practice , we frequently observe various manifestations of such patterns .
figure 2 ( a ) plots the empirical spatial distribution of probe residuals for three arrays as heat maps , allowing for visual , qualitative assessment .
gse1400 is a typical case , in which the only noticeable regularities perceived are a few array - wide , horizontal stripes showing a greater density of either positive or negative residuals ; gse2189 presents a more problematic case , where a large region of the array ( left side ) exhibits a large cluster of positive residuals ; finally , the spike - in dataset reveals similar stripes as in gse1400 , in addition to a small localized artefact showing exclusively negative residuals ( bottom right ) .
the spatial patterns identified in figure 2 are reminiscent of those previously identified by plotting each probe intensity 's deviation from an arbitrary reference array [ 47 ] , from the average of that probe 's intensity in replicate arrays [ 10 ] , in all arrays in the experiment [ 11 , 13 ] , or in all arrays found in geo [ 14 ] , and by plotting the residuals ( or some variation thereof ) of a probe - level model - based method [ 48 , 49 ] .
however , previous work has been limited to qualitative and subjective quality control purposes , with few exceptions to the best of the authors' knowledge [ 12 , 13 ] .
we propose to exploit these values in a background correction algorithm .
moreover , our definition of probe residuals , not based on other arrays , allows for the indiscriminate identification of both systematic ( e.g. , batch effects , scanner effects ) and array - specific spatial biases ( e.g. , sample spatial nonuniformity , smudges , scratches ) .
figure 2 ( b ) shows the spatial distribution of probe residuals on the three arrays after correction by pyn .
qualitatively , all three types of artefacts previously identified appear to have been eliminated or at least severely reduced , thereby marginalizing spatial dependence between residuals .
this " spatial dependence " can be defined quantitatively as spatial autocorrelation , the bidimensional extension to autocorrelation , which itself is a special case of correlation in which the two vectors under analysis u and v are such that u i = v i + 1 for i = 1 , ... , | u | .
this additional dimensionality and directionality leads to multiple alternative formulations of a quantitative metric : geary 's c [ 50 ] and moran 's i [ 51 ] are widely used in geostatistics , while reimers and weinstein [ 10 ] and wilson et al .
[ 36 ] have proposed metrics specifically for microarrays .
though we have implemented all four of these metrics , results are only shown for reimers - weinstein as all results were found to be comparable ( data not shown ) .
figure 3 assesses the impact of correcting each of the 66 arrays in our study with the four methods described in the methods section .
cpp and lpe leave all arrays largely unchanged , with the exception of gsm38903 ( the selected array from gse2189 , with large blob in figure 2 ( a )) ; in all cases , upton - lloyd results in the lowest spatial autocorrelation ( near zero ) , while pyn results in the second lowest .
as effective correction of array - specific spatial biases should result in greater reproducibility , we evaluated the impact of each spatial correction method on variance across replicate arrays .
figure 4 shows the standard deviation across replicate arrays of gene expression values as obtained by rma after pretreatment by each of the methods , as a function of mean log expression value .
at low expression levels , pyn performs best , upton - lloyd critically inflates standard deviation , and cpp and lpe appear to have no effect whatsoever ; at higher expression levels , all methods appear to have virtually no effect .
in order to assess the impact of the spatial correction methods on more tangible , biological results , we used the affycomp package [ 43 ] to assess differentially expressed gene ( deg ) detection power in a dataset in which degs are " known. " the tool separates genes spiked in at low ( figure 5 ( a )) , medium ( figure 5 ( b )) , and high concentrations ( figure 5 ( c )) ; in each plot , the x - axis conveys 1 - specificity , while the y - axis conveys sensitivity ( see [ 6 , 43 ] for details ) .
pyn significantly improves low - and medium - concentration deg detection power , while upton - lloyd clearly deteriorates it , and cpp and lpe appear to have virtually no effect ; at high concentrations , no method can improve deg detection power , though upton - lloyd and cpp deteriorate it significantly .
finally , we assessed the effect of parameter k , the number of neighbouring residuals pooled in ( 3 ) .
roc curves are generated before correction and after correction with varying values of k , and the area under the curve ( auc ) is computed for each roc curve .
figure 6 shows the difference between the auc in corrected data and the auc in original data ( deltaauc ) , as a function of k , separately for low - , medium - , and high - concentration spike - in genes .
small values of k produce less robust ( noisy ) estimates , as they are more susceptible to contain contributions from other sources of probe - specific , but not location - dependent , variations ; thus , as expected , small values of k (< 6 ) perform badly .
conversely , as k increases , estimates of local bias , that is , the r ^ ijn 's , become increasingly robust ; thus , low - and medium - concentration deg detection power is increased significantly above this threshold , peaking around k = 20 then levelling off ( not shown , convergence to deltaauc = 0 ) .
above the k = 6 threshold , high - concentration deg detection power is unaffected .
as explained in the algorithm subsection , as k continues to increase , the correction gradually becomes a simple scaling of all intensities by a constant ; thus , the curves in figure 6 would approach zero as k continues to increase ( data not shown ) .
4. discussion systematic , nonbiological variations have been long known to obscure microarray data .
in the case of spotted arrays , array - and print - tip - dependent biases were the first to be considered .
array bias could trivially be visualized by inspecting box plots of a batch of arrays or using more sophisticated approaches such as rle and nuse plots [ 33 ] ; correction of such biases usually consisted of subtracting each array 's mean or median intensity to impose a common average on each array 's hsi distribution [ 33 ] .
print - tip bias could similarly be visualized by inspecting intensity distributions for each print tip , plotted side by side ; a proposed correction consisted of subtracting a loess fit of this plot for each array [ 25 , 26 ] .
intensity - dependent bias can be visualized and corrected for in the same manner , in which case the plots are known as ma plots and the correction is that first proposed in [ 25 ] .
this strategy of addressing known sources of bias individually has been somewhat abandoned in the case of in situ oligonucleotide arrays , perhaps based on the assumption that streamlined commercial manufacturing of such high - density arrays is much less prone to significant systematic errors .
for example , background correction and normalization steps in two of the most popular analysis packages , rma [ 22 ] and gcrma [ 52 ] , do not take into account known sources of bias , but rather make global , sweeping transformations of the data , via a convolutional model [ 53 ] and quantile normalization [ 27 ] , respectively .
we posit , as initially asserted by dudoit et al. in 2002 , that correcting for known biases using a priori information is preferable to global , blind , generic normalization , and / or reliance on unverified modelling assumptions [ 26 ] .
we have thus proposed such a scheme for correcting spatial bias in affymetrix genechip data , which can readily be applied on other platforms using multiple probes per gene .
we have shown that this method reduces spatial autocorrelation in hsis , reduces variance in gene expression measures across replicate arrays , improves deg detection power , and performs better than previously published methods in terms of replicate variance reduction and deg detection power increase .
as for spatial autocorrelation reduction , we conclude that upton - lloyd removes " too much " due to its working directly on hsis as opposed to pyn 's working with residuals , which may avoid subtracting the " baseline " spatial autocorrelation inherent to each microarray platform .
our analysis of parameter k , the number of neighbouring residuals pooled in ( 3 ) , identified k = 6 as a minimum in order for correction to improve deg detection power and k = 19 as the optimal value .
as computational time is linearly proportional to k and values in the 12 <= k <= 30 range all result in comparable performance , we propose to compromise with k = 20 , and this is the default in the provided implementation .
an assessment based on a spike - in benchmark dataset indicated that deg detection power is increased for low - and medium - concentration genes and is insignificantly affected for high - concentration genes .
however , it should be noted that , by its very design , this central affycomp assessment does not take into account methods' ability to increase detection power across replicate arrays , that is , to take array - specific effects and so - called " batch effects " into consideration : a roc curve is computed for each possible pair of arrays within each of the three 14 - array batches , and the 3 x c ( 14,2 ) = 3 x 91 = 273 curves are averaged to generate plots such as figure 5 [ 6 , 43 ] .
as the great majority of microarray experiments feature more than one replicate array per sample , this setup is highly unrepresentative of real conditions .
additionally , it should be noted that the spike - in dataset is at the high end of the quality control spectrum ; thus , if our correction method is able to improve biological results resulting from this data , it is to be expected that improvement will be even more significant for everyday datasets , such as gse1400 and gse2189 .
although the " random " spatial distribution of probes on the array surface was presented in this paper as a necessary assumption , this is an oversimplification and , thus , not strictly correct .
in reality , the underlying assumption is that probe locations are independent of their targets , or - - in more practical terms - - of the locations of probes in the same probe set , such that any correlation between locations and residuals is always considered undesirable noise or bias ; this can also be expressed as the assumption that probes are randomly spatially distributed on the array surface within each probe set .
thus , although recent studies have uncovered a significant dependence between probe locations and their sequences by observing spatial patterns when spatially mapping probe sequence gc content on the array [ 10 , 14 ] , our algorithm 's assumptions are unaffected .
this may also explain why , although upton - lloyd appears to reduce spatial autocorrelation further than our method , it performs much worse in replicate array variance and deg detection power .
in addition , these results imply that spatial bias correction procedures may unintentionally ( likely only partially ) correct sequence biases as well ; conversely , it implies that sequence bias correction may somewhat correct spatial biases in the process as well .
this does not appear to be problematic per se , but is likely worthy of further investigation in order to fully understand its implications .
finally , the framework established herein provides opportunity for implementing further types of microarray data pretreatments : correction of a specific source of bias which can be expressed as the presence of undesirable mutual information shared by " neighbouring " probes in some given coordinate space ( e.g. , physical location on the array ) or based on some given distance metric , as opposed to expected , desirable mutual information shared by some other sets of probes ( e.g. , affymetrix " probe sets ") .
this approach ( which we dub pyn : probe your neighbours ) should be applicable to other biases such as probe composition as well as to other microarray platforms such as tiling arrays , and preliminary results indicate that this is indeed the case .
5. conclusions oligonucleotide array data is invariably biased by a number of confounding factors , some of which can be effectively quantified and eliminated .
we have proposed a method for correcting bias arising from a known source and show the efficacy of one case , namely , spatial bias in affymetrix genechip data .

in each case , the mean residual is almost zero (| mu | < 10 - 17 ) .
figure 2 empirical spatial distribution of probe residuals in original and corrected data .
mapping probe residuals back to their originating physical locations and displaying them as a heat map reveals a variety of spatial artefacts in ( a ) original data : horizontal stripes ( all arrays ) , a large region of positive residuals ( gse2189 , left ) , and a small region of negative residuals ( spike - in , bottom right ) ; ( b ) after correction ( k = 20 ) , all of these artefacts appear to have been eliminated or greatly attenuated .
non - pm locations ( mm and control probes ) are coloured in white .
figure 3 quantitative effects of correction on spatial autocorrelation .
reimers - weinstein spatial autocorrelation metric computed in data corrected by various methods ( y - axis ) and in original data ( x - axis ) for each array in each dataset , with the " selected " array from each dataset being emphasized by a solid bullet .
the reimers - weinstein metric is a pearson correlation coefficient computed between each intensity and the average intensity among its four neighbours on the array [ 10 ] .
an unchanged metric lies on the dotted unit line , while a value below ( above ) this line indicates a decrease ( increase ) in spatial autocorrelation .
upton - lloyd consistently results in the greatest decrease , followed by pyn , while cpp and lpe have no effect in all but one case .
figure 4 effect of correction on reproducibility across replicate arrays .
standard deviation of log expression index of probe sets across replicate arrays as a function of mean log expression , as computed in data obtained with rma ( all default parameters ) after pretreatment with each of the spatial correction methods ( or none ) .
pyn performs best , resulting in an increase in reproducibility notably for low - expression genes , while upton - lloyd deteriorates data for low - expression genes , and cpp and lpe have virtually no effect .
figure 5 effect of correction on deg detection power .
receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves generated by the r / bioconductor package affycomp , plotting sensitivity as a function of ( 1 - specificity ) , as computed in data obtained with rma ( all default parameters ) after pretreatment with each of the spatial correction methods ( or none ) for ( a ) low - , ( b ) medium - , and ( c ) high - concentration spike - in genes .
see [ 6 , 43 ] for details .
at low and medium concentrations , pyn performs the best ; at all concentrations , upton - lloyd performs the worst by a large margin ; cpp and lpe have virtually no effect , with the exception of cpp degrading results at high concentration .
figure 6 effect of k on deg detection power .
difference between area under the curve ( auc ) of receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves computed in corrected data and auc computed in original data , as a function of the value used for k , separately for low - , medium , and high - concentration spike - in genes .
pyn improves low - and medium - concentration deg detection power with k > 5 , with optimal performance at k = 19 , and has virtually no effect on high - concentration deg detection power above k = 5 .

objective we investigated factors associated with masked and white - coat hypertension in a swiss population - based sample .
methods the swiss kidney project on genes in hypertension is a family - based cross - sectional study .
office and 24 - hour ambulatory blood pressure were measured using validated devices .
masked hypertension was defined as office blood pressure < 140 / 90 mmhg and daytime ambulatory blood pressure >= 135 / 85 mmhg .
white - coat hypertension was defined as office blood pressure >= 140 / 90 mmhg and daytime ambulatory blood pressure < 135 / 85 mmhg .
mixed - effect logistic regression was used to examine the relationship of masked and white - coat hypertension with associated factors , while taking familial correlations into account .
high - normal office blood pressure was defined as systolic / diastolic blood pressure within the 130 - 139 / 85 - 89 mmhg range .
results among the 652 participants included in this analysis , 51 % were female .
mean age (+/ - sd ) was 48 (+/ - 18 ) years .
the proportion of participants with masked and white coat hypertension was respectively 15.8 % and 2.6 % .
masked hypertension was associated with age ( odds ratio ( or ) = 1.02 , p = 0.012 ) , high - normal office blood pressure ( or = 6.68 , p < 0.001 ) , and obesity ( or = 3.63 , p = 0.001 ) .
white - coat hypertension was significantly associated with age ( or = 1.07 , p < 0.001 ) but not with education , family history of hypertension , or physical activity .
conclusions our findings suggest that physicians should consider ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for older individuals with high - normal office blood pressure and / or who are obese .

introduction in the last few decades , the development of techniques that enable measurement of blood pressure ( bp ) outside the physician 's office using either ambulatory or home bp has allowed individuals to be classified into four bp categories : sustained normotension ( individuals who have normal office and out - of - office bp ) , sustained hypertension ( individuals who have hypertension by both methods ) , white - coat hypertension ( individuals who have office hypertension but normal out - of - office bp ) , and masked hypertension ( individuals who have out - of - office hypertension but normal office bp ) [ 1 ] .
the term masked hypertension ( mh ) was first coined by pickering et al in 2002 [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
the prevalence of mh may vary from 8 to 48 % depending on the study methods and population [ 4 ] .
longitudinal studies have demonstrated that individuals with mh have higher cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) morbidity than normotensive persons , independent of other cvd risk factors [ 1 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
moreover , persons with mh have higher bp variability than normotensive individuals [ 7 ] , and tend to subsequently develop sustained hypertension ( sh ) [ 8 ] .
identifying risk factors for mh may allow clinicians to select patients who should undergo ambulatory bp monitoring ( abpm ) [ 4 ] .
it has been previously shown that male sex [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] , age [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , body mass index ( bmi ) [ 12 ] , smoking and alcohol intake [ 11 ] , high - normal office bp [ 11 ] , and a low educational level [ 9 ] are associated with mh in the general population .
on the other hand , the clinical significance of white - coat hypertension ( wch ) remains debated to this day [ 13 ] .
although the vast majority of studies have shown that individuals with wch tend to have the same cvd morbidity as normotensive persons [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , some studies have demonstrated that individuals with wch can have a cvd event rate comparable to individuals with sustained hypertension ( sh ) [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , or are at a higher risk of developing sh with time [ 19 ] .
if wch is a truly benign condition , unnecessarily treating persons with wch will have both clinical and financial consequences [ 13 ] .
factors that have been shown to be associated with wch are age , hypertension of recent onset , and low education [ 13 ] , [ 20 ] .
increasing research has been dedicated to better understanding the factors associated with mh. however , only a small number of studies using 24 - hour abpm have been conducted on a population - based level [ 6 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , with some being performed among individuals with a limited age range .
we explored factors associated with masked hypertension and white - coat hypertension within the multicultural setting of switzerland .
we aimed to provide clinically useful indicators for these conditions in a population - and family - based multicentric sample of swiss adults aged 18 years and older .
methods ethics statement all study participants provided written informed consent .
the skipogh study was approved by the human research ethics committee , lausanne university hospital and university of lausanne ( lausanne , switzerland ) , by the ethics committee for the research on human beings , geneva university hospitals ( geneva , switzerland ) , and by the ethics committee of the canton of bern , ( bern , switzerland ) .
study population and design skipogh ( swiss kidney project on genes in hypertension ) is a family and population - based cross - sectional study that examines the genetic determinants of bp. skipogh is part of the larger family - based international epogh study ( european project on genes in hypertension ) .
skipogh employs the same methodology as that implemented and validated in the epogh study [ 24 ] .
skipogh is a multi - centre study with participants being recruited in the cantons of bern and geneva , and the city of lausanne .
detailed methods have been previously described [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
briefly , recruitment began in december 2009 and ended in april 2012 in lausanne , in october 2012 in geneva , and in april 2013 in bern .
different strategies were used to draw up random samples of the population in each study centre .
index cases were randomly selected from the population - based colaus study [ 27 ] in lausanne , and from the population - based bus sante study in geneva [ 28 ] .
in bern , index participants were randomly selected using the cantonal phone directory .
inclusion criteria were as follows : ( a ) minimum age of 18 years ; ( b ) of european descent ( defined as having both parents and grandparents born in a restricted list of countries ) ; ( c ) at least one , and ideally three , first degree family members also willing to participate in the study .
participation rate was 20 % in lausanne , 22 % in geneva , and 21 % in bern .
participants filled in a standardized questionnaire at home .
the questionnaire focused on a variety of issues including lifestyle habits as well as medical and drug history .
the study visit was performed in the morning after an overnight fast .
electrolytes , kidney - function test , and blood glucose were measured in local laboratories using standard clinical laboratory methods .
participants were also asked to collect a 24 - hour urine sample for the measurement of urinary volume , electrolytes , and the excretion of albumin , urea and creatinine .
the ckd - epi formula was used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) [ 29 ] .
body weight and height were measured using precision electronic scales ( seca , hamburg , germany ) .
blood pressure measurements bp was measured with a non - mercury auscultatory sphygmomanometer ( a & d um - 101 , a & d company , ltd. , toshima ku , tokyo , japan ) that has passed the international protocol for validation of bp measuring devices of the european society of hypertension ( esh ) [ 30 ] .
this device has also been internally validated by our research group [ 31 ] .
bp was measured after 10 minutes of rest in the sitting position in each arm .
subsequently , five consecutive bp measurements were taken on the side with the highest bp [ 13 ] .
in this paper , each subject 's office bp was defined as the mean of the last four office bp readings .
24 - hour apbm was measured using a validated diasys integra device ( novacor , rueil - malmaison , france ) that has fulfilled the validation criteria set forth by the british hypertension society and association for the advancement of medical instrumentation ( aami ) protocols [ 32 ] .
measurements were taken every 15 minutes during the day , and every 30 minutes during the night ( from 10 pm to 7 am ) .
participants were included in the analyses if they had at least fourteen systolic bp ( sbp ) and diastolic bp ( dbp ) measurements during the day and at least seven readings during the night , in accordance with esh recommendations [ 13 ] .
75 participants were excluded due to insufficient 24 - hour bp readings .
day and night periods were obtained from participants' diaries over the 24 - hour period .
bp outliers were identified according to the editing criteria adopted by a & d software [ 33 ] and subsequently excluded from the analyses .
outliers were defined as sbp > 280 mmhg , sbp < 60 mmhg , dbp > 200 mmhg , dbp < 40 mmhg , heart rate > 200 beats / min , heart rate < 40 beats / min , or dbp >= sbp .
if one of the bp measures was categorized as an outlier ( e.g. sbp ) , then the other measures taken at the same instant in time ( e.g. dbp and heart rate ) were also excluded .
on average , 3 bp readings were categorized as outliers per participant over the 24 - hour period .
mean bp readings were subsequently calculated using the valid 24 - hour , daytime , and night - time measurements .
sustained normotension ( nt ) was defined as office bp < 140 / 90 and daytime ambulatory bp < 135 / 85 mmhg .
mh was defined as office bp < 140 / 90 mmhg and daytime ambulatory bp >= 135 / 85 mmhg .
wch was defined as office bp >= 140 / 90 mmhg and daytime ambulatory bp < 135 / 85 mmhg [ 4 ] , [ 13 ] .
sh was defined as office bp >= 140 / 90 mmhg and daytime ambulatory bp >= 135 / 85 mmhg , or if the participant reported taking an anti - hypertensive medication .
accordingly , individuals on anti - hypertensive medication ( n = 105 ) were excluded from the nt , wch , and mh categories .
for certain sensitivity analyses , sh was re - defined as having both office and ambulatory hypertension while excluding individuals who were on anti - hypertensive medication .
associated factors high - normal office bp was defined as an office sbp between 130 - 139 mmhg and office dbp between 85 - 89 mmhg [ 34 ] .
high - normal office bp was only assessed among normotensive individuals and individuals with mh as , by definition , participants with wch and sh already have office hypertension .
smoking was defined as responding yes to the question " do you currently smoke ?" alcohol consumption was defined as consuming at least one alcoholic beverage per week .
bmi was calculated as weight ( kilogram ) divided by height squared ( meter ) .
bmi categories were defined as follows : normal - weight (< 25 kg / m2 ) , overweight ( 25 - 30 kg / m2 ) , and obesity (>= 30 kg / m2 ) .
physical activity was assessed as a continuous variable by asking participants to report the number of hours per week they spend playing sports .
albuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin excretion >= 20 mug / min [ 35 ] .
education was classified into three categories : up to primary education , secondary education , and higher education ( e.g. university or equivalent ) .
participants were asked to report if one of their parents or siblings is known to have hypertension or has suffered from a myocardial infarction ( mi ) or stroke .
analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using stata 12.0 ( stata college station , tx ) .
complete case analysis was conducted on participants from lausanne and geneva , and participants from bern up until 2011 .
differences in baseline characteristics across bp categories were tested using fisher 's exact test for categorical variables and a 3 degrees of freedom likelihood - ratio test from a linear regression model for continuous variables .
the ambulatory and office means for sbp , dbp , and heart rate were adjusted for age , sex , bmi , and study centre using mixed linear models , and a likelihood - ratio test was used to test the differences across bp categories , while taking familial correlations into account .
mixed - effect logistic regression was used to examine the relationship of mh , wch , and sh with associated factors , while also taking familial correlations into account .
for the latter analyses , normotension was used as the reference category .
results complete case analysis of the data resulted in 652 participants with 51 % of the sample population being female .
mean age was 48 (+/ - 18 ) years .
15.0 % of individuals had office hypertension ( i.e. had an office bp >= 140 / 90 mmhg ) and 28.2 % had daytime ambulatory hypertension ( i.e. had a daytime ambulatory bp >= 135 / 85 mmhg ) .
table 1 displays the descriptive characteristics of the study population for each bp category .
individuals with wch were , on average , twenty years older than normotensive individuals , but had similar age as individuals with sh .
40.8 % of mh individuals had high - normal office bp as compared to 7.8 % of normotensive individuals ( p < 0.001 ) .

univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between mh and selected factors , with normotensive individuals acting as the reference group ( table 2 ) .
in multivariable analysis , age and overweight / obesity were positively associated with mh ( odds ratio ( or ) : 1.02 , p = 0.012 for age ; or : 3.63 , p = 0.001 for obesity ) .
the odds of having mh were 6.7 times greater among individuals with high - normal office bp ( p < 0.001 ) as compared to individuals with an office bp < 130 / 85 mmhg .
physical activity ( hours per week ) was inversely associated with mh ( or : 0.92 ; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) : 0.85 - 0.99 ) .
there was no statistically significant association for smoking , alcohol consumption , or educational level .
moreover , we did not find a significant association between mh and fasting serum glucose , serum sodium and potassium , 24 - hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion , microalbuminuria , and egfr ( results not shown ) .

analyses included people with sustained hypertension and people with normotension as a comparison group .
total sample size for this analysis is 532 participants .
we also conducted sensitivity analyses to explore whether the factors associated with mh differed by study centre .
due to the limited number of individuals with mh in our study , we ran the analyses while grouping two study centres at a time ( e.g. geneva and bern , geneva and lausanne , lausanne and bern ) .
the factors associated with mh were very similar to our findings including all three centres ( results not shown ) .
we could not perform similar sensitivity analyses for wch due to the limited number of participants identified as white - coat hypertensives .
discussion our study is the first to estimate the proportion of mh in a family - and population - based study in switzerland .
we found that one in six individuals in our sample had mh , a finding comparable to other population - based studies [ 12 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
although the frequency of wch in our study ( 3 %) was lower than that normally reported in the literature , other population - based studies have also found a prevalence within the range of 3 - 5 % [ 12 ] , [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] .
this low wch proportion may be attributable to the relatively young age of our study population , as wch tends to occur more often in older individuals [ 38 ] , as well as the clinical settings in which office bp was measured in this study ( after ten minutes of rest ) .
moreover , mean office bp was calculated using the last four bp readings whilst disregarding the first bp measurement .
correspondingly , individuals with wch were , on average , 20 years older than normotensive individuals in our study .
moreover , it has been shown that wch is associated with a previous diagnosis of hypertension [ 38 ] , and as the current study is population - based , only 16 % of individuals reported being on anti - hypertensive medication .
it should also be noted that the proportion of mh and wch is directly related to the cut - offs used to define normal office and ambulatory bp [ 4 ] .
although most studies tend to use the thresholds of 140 / 90 mmhg for office bp and 135 / 85 mmhg for daytime ambulatory bp , some studies set their thresholds based on the population studied , use arbitrary thresholds , or employ thresholds that are identical for both office and ambulatory bp [ 4 ] .
a growing body of evidence has found that abpm is better correlated with target organ damage than office bp measurement [ 15 ] , and that persons with mh have a cvd risk comparable to those with sh [ 14 ] .
the odds of having mh was seven times greater among participants who had a high - normal office bp , a finding consistent with previous reports [ 3 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 39 ] .
moreover , the proportion of mh among individuals with high - normal office bp was 31.8 % as compared to 11.7 % among individuals with an office bp of less than 130 / 85 mmhg .
high - normal office bp may thus be of important clinical utility , as it is easy to measure and appears to be strongly associated with mh , thereby aiding physicians in selecting patients for abpm .
shimbo et al hypothesized that although both ambulatory and office bp increase with age , ambulatory hypertension may precede office hypertension , whereas office bp rises but remains within the normal office bp range in the early stages [ 3 ] .
in our study , 41 % of individuals with mh had high - normal office bp. it is presumed that the office bp of these individuals will eventually increase leading to sh [ 3 ] , suggesting that it would be advisable to screen these individuals for mh. notably , just over half of the global burden of cvd that is attributable to bp occurs in individuals with high - normal bp [ 40 ]. of note , in contrast to some earlier studies , mh in this paper was considered only among untreated individuals .
some studies [ 11 ] , [ 39 ] , although not all [ 12 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 41 ] , have found that smoking and alcohol consumption are correlated with mh and wch .
in our study , we did not find a significant association between smoking and alcohol consumption and bp status .
in line with the existing literature [ 11 ] , [ 22 ] , [ 39 ] , persons who were overweight or obese were more likely to have mh and sh. moreover , physical activity was inversely associated with mh , consistent with a previous study that also found that mh was associated with a low physical activity score among nonsmokers [ 41 ] .
we found that individuals with mh and sh had the highest ambulatory bp whereas individuals with wch had the highest office bp. interestingly , the mean ambulatory dbp of masked hypertensives was significantly higher than that of sh individuals .
when treated individuals were excluded from the sh category , this was no longer the case .
we also found that individuals with mh had the highest ambulatory heart rate .
it has been postulated that mh is associated with a sympathetic overdrive , although the exact mechanisms underlying this sympathetic activation have to be further clarified [ 38 ] , [ 42 ] .
in our study , individuals with wch had the highest office heart rate , which is compatible with previous results showing that individuals with wch have an increased sympathetic activity [ 23 ] , [ 43 ] .
our study has some limitations .
the cross - sectional nature of this study limits inference on causality .
there were relatively few participants who were classified as having wch , limiting the statistical analyses that may be performed on this sub - group .
likewise , we were unable to stratify individuals in the sh category by treatment status due to the low number of participants who had sh and were not on anti - hypertensive medication .
participation rate was relatively low , raising the issue of selection bias and thus limiting the external validity of our results .
however , there was no difference in terms of age and sex distribution between the participants to this study and those of the population - based sample from which they were drawn [ 25 ] .
moreover , each study centre used a different strategy to select study participants , which implies that selection biases , if any , are likely to differ across centers .
our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that results were similar when restricting the analyses to two centres instead of three centres .
furthermore , the factors we found to be associated with mh were similar to those previously published , which suggests that our findings have reasonable external validity .
strengths of this study include its population - and family - based nature and the relatively large sample size .
conclusion we found that individuals with mh tend to share similar characteristics as patients with sh. although there is currently a lack of randomized controlled trials that have investigated the benefits of treating patients with mh , it is plausible that by identifying individuals with mh , cardiovascular complications and target organ damage may potentially be avoided if management of hypertension is based on ambulatory bp [ 16 ] .
our results suggest that clinicians should suspect mh in an older ( and / or overweight ) patient with high - normal office bp. supporting information table s1 mean ambulatory and office systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) , diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) , and heart rate ( hr ) by blood pressure category .

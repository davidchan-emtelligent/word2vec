in vivo evaluation of biomechanical property of the aortic tissue might be of interest to discriminate between normal and altered aortic tissue ( a lalande et al , jmri 2008 ) .
the purpose of this study was to describe a technique to measure regional aortic compliance ( ac ) , aortic distensibility ( ad ) and aortic stiffness with 1.5 t mri in young individuals under resting conditions and during supine bicycle exercise .
methods materials and methods : fiftheen young adults ( 8 men , median 29 ( 23 - 41 ) yrs ) with no risk factor for atherosclerosis were recruited .
they all underwent 1.5t mri ( siemens , avanto ) at rest and during supine exercise using an amagnetic ergometer ( lode , the netherlands ) .
the following parameters were used for rest and exercise : cine = tr / te = 30 ms / 1.8 ms , thickness = 6 mm , alpha = 65degrees , matrix = 148 x 256 , resolution = 30 ms , retrospective gating ; phase contrast = tr / te = 25 ms / 2 ms , thickness = 6 mm , matrix = 256 x 256 , flow encoding = 200 cm / s , alpha = 25degrees , resolution = 25 ms , retrospective gating ) .
for exercise the volunteer was instructed to cycle for 2 min at 25w , work load was increased each 2 min for a minimum of 10 min , to obtained twice the resting heart rate .
the volunteer was instructed to stop cycling and immediately following which a breath held stress dataset of 2 acquisitions were acquired .
the volunteer was instructed to cycle for at least 2 min at the last exercise level , and the images acquisition was repeated .
ac and ad were determined from cine - mri at four locations , ascending aorta ( aa ) , proximal descending aorta ( pda ) , distal descending aorta ( dda ) , and aorta above renal artery ( ra ) .
segmental aortic pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) was assessed by phase contrast .
results results all volunteer complete the whole protocol .
stress induced a significant decrease of ac and ad at all sites ( p < 10 - 3 ) .
at rest and during stress , ac was statistically higher in aa compared to the whole descending aorta ( p <= 0.0007 ) .
we found a strong correlation between the rate pressure product and ac at all sites ( figure 1 ) .
during exercise we measure a reduction of the aortic maximal diameter along the aortic arch ( aa , p = 0.06 and pda , p = 0.008 ) suggesting a contraction of the thoracic aorta during exercise .
pwv measured at pda and dda increased significantly during stress ( p = 0.02 , p = 0.008 , respectively ) .
figure 1 conclusions conclusion this study demonstrates the feasibility to analyze regional aortic function during an exercise - induced stress mri .
further studies are required to evaluate its interest to detect aa 's dysfunction among patients with thoracic aortic diseases .

a huge amount of energy is consumed during sugar production in the food industry .
the large amount of steam used and the power of the turbine power plant are key factors .
this makes energy and exergy analysis important in sugar factories .
the data given in the following paper are related to input and output information of the paper entitled energy - exergy analysis and optimisation of a model sugar factory in turkey by taner and sivrioglu ( 2015 ) [ 1 ] .
factory total energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are found to be etaent = 72.2 % and etaext = 37.4 % , respectively , and according to these results , the total energy quality emptyt = 0.64 .
these results indicate higher efficiency than similar studies ( vuckovic et al. , 2014 ; pellegrini and oliviera junior , 2011 ; deshmukh et al. , 2013 ; palacios - bereche et al. , 2015 ) [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] .
this study can be a model for these similar factories by taner and sivrioglu ( 2015 ) [ 1 ] .

1 data the integrated sugar factory 's name is cumra sugar integrated plant , turkey .
the process data were taken with permission from the factory manager .
these data were recently taken in collaboration with the department of factory central monitoring and directorate of maintenance and energy ( year 2011 to 2013 ) [ 1 ] .
a huge amount of energy is consumed during sugar production in the food industry .
calculations and analyses are performed from the point of view of energy and exergy efficiency [ 1 ] .
2 experimental design , materials and methods to define the relationship between the calculated energy and exergy analysis results , linear regression analysis from the statistical methods is applied with the spss 17.0 software package .
the effect of the integration of solid oxide fuel cell ( sofc ) technology was performed in a sugar - ethanol factory [ 6 ] .
a thermal integration technique was used another study [ 7 ] .
the thermodynamic performance of the plant was reached to assess [ 8 ] .
in this study , these similar subjects were discussed in our research .
the data in this data article has been generated by following these main steps : 1 .
method and equations regarding energy and exergy analysis .
2. factory energy and exergy analysis results .
this method allowed the identification of measures able to optimise the energy performance of the sugar factory .
the optimisation tool , with the use of computational procedures developed in excel programme , has been used in order to calculate the energy and exergy analysis .
these values are also calculated by using the thermodynamics laws and other steam tables and then verified .

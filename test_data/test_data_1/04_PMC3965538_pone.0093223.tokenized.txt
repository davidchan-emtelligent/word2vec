glucocorticoids are important mediators of the stress response and are commonly employed as drugs for the suppression of immune rejection after organ transplantation .
previous investigations uncovered the possibility of mood depression in patients undergoing long - term treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids , including dexamethasone ( dex ) .
exogenous glucocorticoids and their synthetic derivatives can also adversely affect the development of the central nervous system .
although neurite extension from rat pheochromocytoma - derived pc12 cells and a variety of primary neurons is stimulated by nerve growth factor ( ngf ) , and signaling pathways triggered by the binding of ngf to tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 ( trka ) function in both neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival , the effect of dex on the activation of regulatory proteins and pathways downstream of trka has not been well characterized .
to analyze the influence of dex on ngf - induced neurite outgrowth and signaling , pc12 cells , a widely utilized model of neuronal differentiation , were pretreated with the glucocorticoid prior to ngf induction .
ngf - induced neurite outgrowth was attenuated by pretreatment with dex , even in the absence of dex after the addition of ngf .
moreover , dex suppressed the phosphorylation of akt and extracellular - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) in the neurite outgrowth signaling cascade initiated by ngf .
finally , the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) antagonist , ru38486 , counteracted the inhibitory effect of dex pretreatment , not only on the phosphorylation of akt and erk1 / 2 , but also on neurite extension from pc12 cells .
these results suggest that dex binding to the gr impairs ngf - promoted neurite outgrowth by interfering with the activation / phosphorylation of akt and erk1 / 2 .
these novel findings are likely to be useful for elucidating the central nervous system depressive mechanism ( s ) of action of dex and other glucocorticoids .

introduction glucocorticoids are critical mediators of the stress response in neurons and other cell types .
exposure of cells to stress triggers the glucocorticoid - mediated activation of corticotropin - releasing hormones , which in turn stimulate the synthesis of pituitary corticotropin as a part of the hypothalamo - pituitary adrenal axis [ 1 ] .
glucocorticoids are also involved in cell proliferation , neurotransmitter synthesis [ 2 ] , neuronal survival , and neuronal differentiation [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
clinically , synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone ( dex ) are used for the suppression of immune rejection after organ transplantation and in the treatment of leukemia .
however , the clinical use of synthetic glucocorticoids increases the risk of mood depression in patients receiving long - term therapy with these agents [ 5 ] .
furthermore , prenatal exposure to dex can lead to the abnormal development of the central nervous system [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] .
nerve growth factor ( ngf ) is a member of the neurotrophin family [ 8 ] that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation within specific neural tissues during physiological as well as pathological processes [ 9 ] .
in particular , ngf is essential for cognitive function , and disrupted signaling through ngf is related to the development of alzheimer 's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [ 10 ] .
the functions of ngf are mediated by two distinct receptor types , tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 ( trka ) and the p75 neurotrophin receptor ( p75ntr ) [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] .
trka is a high - affinity catalytic receptor for ngf , whereas p75ntr is a low - affinity non - enzymatic ngf receptor .
after ngf binds to trka , the receptor is subjected to cellular internalization , together with autophosphorylation of its tyrosine residues [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
next , understream signaling , such as that mediated by phosphatidylinositol - 3 kinase ( pi3k ) and activated ras , takes place in the ngf - stimulated cells [ 15 ] - [ 17 ] .
thus , ngf binding to trka mediates axonal outgrowth and cellular survival in the affected neurons , whereas ngf binding to p75ntr is hypothesized to antagonize trka - stimulated signal transduction [ 18 ] .
the current study made use of the pc12 pheochromocytoma cell line to evaluate the capacity of dex to interfere with neuronal signaling downstream of trka .
pc12 cells provide a useful model for the investigation of neuronal differentiation , signaling , and other neurobiochemical / neurobiological events [ 19 ] - [ 22 ] .
in the presence of ngf , pc12 cells differentiate into sympathetic neuron - like cells and are capable of substantial neurite outgrowth [ 23 ] .
these properties allow for the exploration of possible cross - talk between glucocorticoid - and neurotrophin - activated signaling pathways that might affect the morphological differentiation of neurons .
indeed , pc12 cells have been successfully utilized to evaluate the effects of various natural and synthetic glucocorticoids on neurite outgrowth and related signaling cascades [ 24 ] - [ 27 ] .
to our knowledge , however , no information is available regarding the dex - induced modulation of protein activation / phosphorylation downstream of the trka receptor .
the present study now demonstrates that the interaction of dex with the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) can inhibit the activation of akt and extracellular - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( erk1 / 2 ) following the binding of ngf to trka , effectively attenuating neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells .
these findings are likely to shed light on the means by which dex adversely affects the central nervous system .
materials and methods materials dex ( dexamethasone sodium phosphate ) was purchased from wako pure chemical industries , ltd .
( osaka , japan ) .
ngf ( murine ngf ( mngf ) 2.5s derived from mouse submaxillary glands ) was obtained from alomone labs , ltd .
( jerusalem , israel ) .
the gr antagonist , ru38486 , was purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo , usa ) .
cell culture pc12 cells were obtained from the riken cell bank ( ibaraki , japan ) .
the cells were maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) ( gibco - life technologies , gaithersburg , md , usa ) supplemented with nutrient mixture f - 12 ( gibco - life technologies ) , 10 % ( v / v ) fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) ( gibco - life technologies ) , and 1 % ( v / v ) penicillin / streptomycin ( nacalai tesque , kyoto , japan ) .
the cells were kept in an incubator at 37degreesc in an atmosphere of 5 % co2 / 95 % air .
twenty - four hours prior to experimentation , the pc12 cells were seeded onto type i collagen - coated 60 mm tissue culture dishes ( iwaki , tokyo , japan ) at a density of 1.5x105 cells / dish in dmem / f12 containing 10 % fbs .
measurement of pc12 cell morphological differentiation ( neurite outgrowth ) pc12 cells were pretreated with dex ( 1 mum ) or vehicle ( dmem / f12 containing 10 % fbs ) for 24 h , washed with phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) , and stimulated with differentiation medium ( dmem / f12 containing 5 % fbs plus 50 ng / ml ngf ) .
cells were incubated for an additional 24 h and photographed by using a digital camera ( digital sight ds - l2 system ; nikon , tokyo , japan ) under a phase - contrast microscope ( eclipse ts100 ; nikon ) .
images of five randomly selected fields per dish were obtained that included a mean number of 10 - 20 pc12 cells per field .
the total length of the neurites derived from all 10 - 20 cells in each of the five fields was automatically measured by using neurocyte image analyzer software ( kurabo , osaka , japan ) .
the average neurite length per field was obtained by dividing the total neurite length by the number of cells per field .
finally , the results from all of the fields were summed and divided by the total number of fields ( n = 5 ) to yield the average neurite length per condition .
western blotting analysis pc12 cells were pretreated with dex ( 1 mum ) for 24 h , washed with pbs , and stimulated with ngf ( 50 ng / ml ) in dmem / f12 containing 5 % fbs .
at selected time points ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , and 60 min ) following the addition of ngf , the cells were harvested in ice - cold tris - buffered saline ( tbs ) ( bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) and lysed with pathscan sandwich elisa lysis buffer ( cell signaling technology , beverly , ma , usa ) on ice for 5 min .
cell debris was removed by centrifugation , and protein concentrations in the lysates were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid ( bca ) assay kit ( pierce , rockford , il , usa ) .
protein samples containing equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) - polyacrylamide gels , followed by electrophoretic transfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( pvdf ) membranes .
the pvdf membranes were blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin ( wako pure chemical industries , ltd. ) in tbs containing 0.1 % tween - 20 at room temperature for 1 h. next , immunoblotting was performed by using primary anti - phospho - akt ( p - akt ) antibody ( ser473 ; cell signaling technology ) , primary anti - akt antibody ( cell signaling technology ) , primary anti - phospho - erk1 ( t202 / y204 )/ erk2 ( t185 / y187 ) ( p - erk1 / 2 ) antibody ( r & d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) , and primary anti - erk1 / 2 antibody ( r & d systems ) .
immunoreactive bands were detected by reaction with a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody ( amersham pharmacia biotech , piscataway , nj , usa ) and visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting detection reagents ( amersham pharmacia biotech ) and rx - u fuji x - ray film ( fuji film , tokyo , japan ) .
imagej software ( freely available from the national institutes of health , bethesda , md , usa ) was employed for data analysis .
pharmacological inhibition of the gr in pc12 cells to evaluate the influence of gr blockade on the dex - mediated regulation of neurite outgrowth , pc12 cells were pretreated with the glucocorticoid ( 1 mum ) and ru38486 ( 2 mum ) , a pharmacological inhibitor of the gr , at 24 h prior to the addition of ngf ( 50 ng / ml ) .
the cells were incubated with ngf for another 24 h , and neurite outgrowth was then analyzed as described above .
alternatively , the cells were harvested at 10 min after the addition of ngf for western blotting analysis with primary anti - p - akt , anti - akt , anti - p - erk1 / 2 , and anti - erk1 / 2 antibodies .
statistical analysis quantitative data are given as the means +/ - the standard deviation ( sd ) .
statistical analysis of the quantitative data was performed by applying an analysis of variance ( anova ) test followed by tukey 's post - hoc test .
in all cases , p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results dex attenuates ngf - induced neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells pc12 cells extended few neurites in the absence of ngf ( fig. 1a ) .
as expected , total neurite outgrowth was significantly increased by treatment with the neurotrophin ( fig. 1a , b ) .
however , the ngf - induced increase in neuronal process extension was significantly attenuated by dex pretreatment ( dex + ngf ) .
in the absence of ngf , no differences were observed between the vehicle ( dmem / f12 / 10 % fbs ) group and the dex group ( fig. 1a , b ) .
therefore , dex effectively inhibited ngf - induced neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0093223.g001 figure 1 dex pretreatment attenuates ngf - induced promotion of neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells .
pc12 cells were pretreated for 24 ( 1 mum ) .
they were then stimulated with ngf for another 24 h .
( a ) images of the cultures are shown at 400x magnification .
( b ) neurite lengths were analyzed as described in the materials and methods section .
the values represent the means +/ - the sd for all pc12 cells included in five randomly chosen fields per condition (* p < 0.05 , dex + ngf versus vehicle ; ** p < 0.01 , ngf versus vehicle ; ++ p < 0.01 , dex + ngf versus ngf ) .
dex blocks ngf - induced activation / phosphorylation of akt and erk1 / 2 the time course of signaling activation associated with ngf - induced neurite outgrowth was next assessed in pc12 cells with or without dex pretreatment .
this was done by analyzing the phosphorylation status of akt and erk1 / 2 on western blots .
after the addition of ngf to the cells without dex pretreatment , the protein levels of phosphorylated akt ( p - akt ) gradually increased and reached their peak 10 min later ( fig. 2a , c ) .
the p - akt levels then declined by 52 % at 60 min after ngf treatment ( fig. 2c ). with dex pretreatment , p - akt levels also peaked in pc12 cells at 10 min after ngf treatment and declined thereafter ( fig. 2a , c ) , but the p - akt content was about 41 - 59 % lower in the presence versus the absence of dex at each time point examined ( fig. 2c ) .
this was not due to lower amounts of total protein in the dex - pretreated versus non - pretreated samples because equal amounts of protein were loaded into each lane of the sds - page gel , as assessed by the bca assay .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0093223.g002 figure 2 dex pretreatment inhibits ngf - induced phosphorylation of akt and erk1 / 2 .
pc12 cells were pretreated for 24 ( 1 mum ) .
they were then stimulated with ngf for varying periods of time ( 0 , 5 , 10 15 , 30 , or 60 min ) .
( a , b ) whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to sds - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to pvdf membranes , and immunoblotted with primary anti - p - akt antibody and anti - akt antibody ( a ) , as well as with primary anti - p - erk1 / 2 antibody and anti - erk1 / 2 antibody ( b ) , followed by a horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibody .
( c , d ) the intensity of the p - akt polypeptide band was normalized to that of the total akt band ( p - akt / akt ) ( c ) , and the intensity of the p - erk1 / 2 polypeptide band was normalized to that of the total erk1 / 2 band ( p - erk1 / 2 / erk1 / 2 ) ( d ) .
results are presented as the means +/ - the sd for three independent experiments .
similarly , the amount of phosphorylated erk1 / 2 ( p - erk1 / 2 ) was highest at 10 min after the addition of ngf without dex pretreatment ( fig. 2b , d ) .
however , dex pretreatment reduced erk1 / 2 phosphorylation by ~ 37 % at the same time point ( fig. 2d ) .
these results demonstrate that exposure of pc12 cells to dex prior to neurotrophin treatment downregulated the ngf - induced stimulation of akt and erk1 / 2 .
ru38486 prevents dex - mediated inhibition of ngf - induced neurite outgrowth and akt / erk1 / 2 phosphorylation we next investigated the ability of ru38486 , a gr antagonist , to interfere with the dex - mediated attenuation of ngf - induced neurite outgrowth and akt / erk1 / 2 signaling activation .
pc12 cells were pretreated with vehicle , dex , or dex together with ru38486 for 24 h. ngf was then added and incubated with the cultures for another 24 h , at which time total neurite outgrowth was assessed .
as seen above ( fig. 1a , b ) , ngf facilitated neurite extension from pc12 cells , while dex reversed the actions of ngf ( fig. 3a , b ) .
the inhibition of ngf - induced neurite outgrowth by dex pretreatment was significantly counteracted by simultaneous pretreatment with ru38486 ( fig. 3a , b ) .
furthermore , ru38486 completely abolished the capacity of dex to interfere with ngf - induced akt and erk1 / 2 phosphorylation .
figure 3c shows that the concomitant pretreatment of pc12 cells with ru38486 plus dex restored the ngf - induced phosphorylation of both signaling molecules at 10 min after the addition of the neurotrophin , when the peak levels of p - akt and p - erk1 / 2 were initially observed ( fig. 2 ) .
these findings suggest that the mitigation of neurite outgrowth by dex occurred through dex interaction with the gr , followed by the inhibition of akt and erk1 / 2 phosphorylation , and / or the activation of signaling proteins upstream of akt and erk1 / 2 .

discussion the present study utilized pc12 cells as a neuronal model to demonstrate that ngf - induced neurite outgrowth , a hallmark of neuronal morphological differentiation , was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with a synthetic glucocorticoid , dex ( fig. 1 ) .
dex - mediated interference with neurite outgrowth was accompanied by specific neurobiochemical changes , as evidenced by the downregulation of phosphorylated akt and erk1 / 2 levels in the ngf - treated cultures ( fig. 2 ) .
moreover , the current investigation utilized a specific gr antagonist , ru38486 , to show that the actions of dex to modulate neurite outgrowth and neurite outgrowth - associated signaling pathways were actually facilitated via the gr ( fig. 3 ) .
to our knowledge , this is the first report to demonstrate that the interaction of dex with the gr , the phosphorylation / dephosphorylation of akt and erk1 / 2 , and ngf - induced neurite outgrowth are all interrelated .
the mechanism underlying ngf - induced neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells has been investigated in various studies [ 9 ] , [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] .
in the cascade of signaling events contributing to the morphological differentiation of pc12 cells , ras and pi3k signaling events are absolutely pivotal to the control of ngf - induced neurite extension [ 9 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] .
akt and erk1 / 2 are then activated downstream of ras and pi3k , respectively ( fig. 4 ) [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
a significant increase in total neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells by the addition of ngf was also observed in the present study ( figs. 1 and 3 ) , along with phosphorylation / activation of akt and erk1 / 2 ( figs. 2 and 3 ) .
as noted above , the ngf - induced enhancement of neurite outgrowth and phosphorylation of akt and erk1 / 2 were both attenuated by dex pretreatment of pc12 cells ( figs. 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
pollock et al. , however , provided controversial results in which dex did not prevent neurite outgrowth from pc12 cells in the continued presence of ngf [ 24 ] .
on the other hand , lecht et al. demonstrated that ngf - induced neurite outgrowth was inhibited in the presence of dex [ 27 ] , consistent with our observations .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0093223.g004 figure 4 proposed scheme of the signaling pathways involved in dex - mediated inhibition of ngf - induced neurite outgrowth and akt / erk1 / 2 phosphorylation / activation .
dex associates with the gr in the cytoplasm and inhibits the phosphorylation of signaling molecules ( e.g. , ras / erk1 / 2 and pi3k / akt ) downstream of the trka receptor .
dex - mediated inhibition of ngf - induced neurite outgrowth is proposed to occur by preventing the phosphorylation of akt and / or erk1 / 2 and / or upstream proteins ( e.g. , ras and pi3k ) .
under the present experimental conditions ( i.e. , dex pretreatment for 24 h followed by the washing out of dex and the addition of ngf ) , dex was undeniably inhibitory to neurite outgrowth .
because the inhibition of ngf - induced neurite outgrowth and akt / erk1 / 2 phosphorylation were both observed with dex pretreatment , even after the removal of dex , we propose that the dex does not directly interact with the ngf trka receptor , but instead indirectly impedes the signaling activation of akt and erk1 / 2 by ngf .
moreover , the dex - mediated inhibition of both of these processes was counteracted by the addition of ru38486 ( fig. 3 ) , demonstrating that dex binding to the gr regulates the signaling activation of akt and erk1 / 2 and / or upstream proteins , such as pi3k and ras .
importantly , lecht et al. showed that dex precipitated a 50 % decrease in the selective binding of ngf to pc12 cells [ 27 ] .
the capacity of dex to affect signaling upstream of akt and erk1 / 2 , but downstream of ngf binding to the trka receptor , could explain the results of both lecht et al. and pollock et al. , as well as the indirect inhibition of trka - mediated signaling by the glucocorticoid .
lecht and colleagues also reported that dex can reduce the mrna and protein expression levels of the low - affinity ngf receptor , p75ntr , and that ru38486 reversed these actions [ 27 ] .
the authors demonstrated that the downregulation of p75ntr was associated with an increase in trka autophosphorylation / activation in pc12 - 6.24 - i cells , a pc12 cell clone that constitutively overexpresses the trka receptor .
given that akt and erk1 / 2 act downstream of autophosphorylated trka , these results are seemingly inconsistent with our findings of the dex - mediated inhibition of ngf - induced activation of akt and erk1 / 2 .
the discrepancy might be explained by the difference in cell types and / or divergent experimental conditions between the present study and that of lecht et al. moreover , lecht et al. addressed the relationship between dex - mediated inhibition of ngf - induced neurite outgrowth and the elevated levels of autophosphorylated trka , and proposed that an as yet unknown regulatory process might contribute to the uncoupling of trka activation and trka - mediated neurite outgrowth .
however , further research in this area is required .
another investigation reported that wortmannin , an inhibitor of pi3k , obstructed the ngf - induced activation of akt [ 34 ] .
furthermore , lovastatin , an inhibitor of ras , blocked the ngf - induced activation of erk1 / 2 and neurite outgrowth [ 35 ] , [ 36 ] .
these results suggest that the signaling activation of pi3k , akt , and erk1 / 2 is linked to the promotion of neurite outgrowth by ngf from pc12 cells ( fig. 4 ) .
however , we found that the simultaneous addition of dex and ngf to pc12 cells failed to inhibit the signaling activation of akt and erk1 / 2 ( data not shown ) .
this observation could be explained by the time lag between the signaling from the gr to the protein phosphorylation of akt and erk1 / 2 and / or upstream signaling molecules .
in conclusion , this study demonstrated that dex pretreatment of pc12 cells inhibited ngf - induced neurite outgrowth .
dex apparently exerted its actions by binding to the gr and by subsequently preventing the ngf - stimulated phosphorylation / activation of akt and erk1 / 2 , perhaps via actions on upstream effector proteins such as pi3k and ras .
because dex is well known to cause mood depression with long - term use [ 37 ] , the present findings may prove useful in elucidating the central nervous system depression mechanism of action of the synthetic glucocorticoid .

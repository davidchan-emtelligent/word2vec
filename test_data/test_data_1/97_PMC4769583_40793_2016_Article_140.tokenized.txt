the genus has attracted considerable attention as a source of thermostable enzymes , which have important biotechnological applications [ 6 ] , and as a model organism to study the mechanisms involved in bacterial adaptation to extreme environments [ 7 ] .
members of the genus thermus were formerly considered to be strictly aerobic , based on the characteristics of the type species thermus aquaticus [ 2 ] .
however , many studies have shown that thermus strains also can grow as facultative anaerobes using nitrogen oxides , sulfur , or metals as terminal electron acceptors under oxygen - deprived conditions [ 8 - 10 ] .
cava et al .
[ 11 ] demonstrated that different t. thermophilus strains can grow anaerobically by reducing nitrate to nitrite or by reducing nitrite to a gaseous nitrogen product .
the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle has been investigated in a few geothermal systems [ 12 ] , including great boiling spring , a ~ 80 degreesc hot spring in the u.s. great basin [ 13 - 15 ] .
studies in gbs revealed a high flux of nitrous oxide , particularly in the ~ 80 degreesc source pool , suggesting the importance of incomplete denitrifiers in high - temperature environments .
a subsequent cultivation and physiological study of heterotrophic denitrifiers suggested a significant role of t. oshimai and t. thermophilus in denitrification in this hot spring [ 16 ] .
a following study of the whole genomes of one strain from each species , t. oshimai jl - 2 and t. thermophilus jl - 18 , revealed that they have genes encoding the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrous oxide but lack genes encoding the nitrous oxide reductase , and explains their incomplete denitrification phenotype [ 17 ] .
thermus amyloliquefaciens strain yim 77409t was isolated in the course of an investigation of the culturable thermophiles that inhabit geothermal springs in yunnan province , southwest china [ 18 ] .
strain yim 77409t was cultured from a sediment sample collected from niujie hot spring using the serial dilution technique on t5 agar .
this organism was able to grow anaerobically using nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor , and may potentially impact the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle .
here we describe a summary classification and a set of the features of thermus amyloliquefaciens type strain yim 77409t , together with the genome sequence description and annotation .
this work may help to better understand the physiological characters as well as the ecological role of this organism in hot spring ecosystems .
organism information classification and features a taxonomic study using a polyphasic approach placed strain yim 77409t in the genus thermus within the family thermaceae of the phylum deinococcus - thermus and resulted in the description of a novel species , thermus amyloliquefaciens , according to its ability to digest starch [ 18 ] .
the highest 16s rrna gene sequence pairwise similarities for strain yim 77409t were found with the type strain of t. scotoductus se - 1t ( 97.6 %) , t. antranikianii hn3 - 7t ( 96.6 %) , t. caliditerraeyim 77925t ( 96.5 %) , and t. tengchongensisyim 77924t ( 96.1 %) using eztaxon - e [ 19 ] .
the sequence similarities were less than 96.0 % with all other species .
phylogenetic analyses based on the 16s rrna gene sequences show that yim 77409t together with t. caliditerrae , t. scotoductus , t. antranikianii , and t. tengchongensis constitute a distinct monophyletic group within the genus thermus ( fig. 1 ) .
the dna - dna hybridization value between strains yim 77409t and t. scotoductus se - 1t was 30.6 +/ - 1.6 % [ 18 ] , which was lower than the threshold value ( 70 %) for the recognition of microbial species [ 20 ] .
similarly , the average nucleotide identity ( ani ) score between the two strains based on genome - wide comparisons was 86.6 % , according to the algorithm proposed by goris et al .
[ 21 ] , which is lower than the ani threshold range ( 95 - 96 %) for species demarcation [ 22 ] .
those results indicate that strain yim 77409t represents a distinct genospecies in the genus thermus [ 18 ]. fig. 1 maximum - likelihood phylogenetic tree of the genus thermus to highlight the position of thermus amyloliquefaciens strain yim 77409t .
the tree was reconstructed based on 1374 aligned positions that remained after the application of the lane mask to the 16s rrna gene sequences using mega 5.0 [ 54 ] .
complete deletion of gaps and missing data and kimura 's two - parameter model was applied .

the phylogenetic coverage of these genomes is shown in fig. 1 and their basic properties are summarized in table 5 .
the thermus genomes range in size from 2.04 mb ( thermus sp. rlm ) to 2.56 mb ( t. tengchongensisyim 77401 ) ; gc contents vary from 64.8 % ( t. scotoductusdsm 8553t ) to 69.5 % ( t. thermophilus hb8t ) , predicted gene number range from 2,043 ( t. sp. rlm ) to 2,789 ( t. brockianus ) .
the genome size ( 2.16 mb ) and gc contents ( 67.4 %) of strain yim 77409t are around the average value , but the gene number of this strain is lower than the average , possibly indicating gene loss through genomic streamlining in this species .
in addition , the percentage of protein - coding genes with functional prediction ( 79.5 %) is higher than the average , whereas the percentage of protein - coding genes with cogs ( 67.4 %) is similar to the average of the genus thermus .

twenty abc transporters were identified in the yim 77409t genome , including amino acid , oligopeptide / dipeptide , n - acetyl - d - glucosamine , maltose , nucleoside , sugar , phosphonate , phosphate , thiamin , cation , and ammonium transporters as well as other permeases .
the genome also encodes glucosidases , glycosidases , proteases , and peptidases .
the finding of three genes probably coding for esterase ( bs74 _ rs04020 , bs74 _ rs04625 , bs74 _ rs10315 ) and one gene probably coding for amylopullulanase ( bs74 _ rs00620 ) are consistent with the observed lipase and amylase activities observed in strain yim 77409t .
a number of genes assigned to a classical electron transport chain have been identified in the strain yim 77409t genome .
respiratory complex i nadh quinone oxidoreductases consists of nadh quinone oxidoreductase chains a - n ( bs74 _ rs03070 - bs74 _ rs03135 ) , nadh quinone oxidoreductase subunit 15 ( bs74 _ rs02790 ) , and two quinone oxidoreductases ( bs74 _ rs00610 , bs74 _ rs06600 ) .
complex ii consists of succinate dehydrogenase ( cytochrome b556 subunit sdhc ( bs74 _ rs07950 ) , sdha ( bs74 _ rs07940 ) , sdhb ( bs74 _ rs07935 ) , and sdhd ( bs74 _ rs07945 ) .
a four - subunit cytochrome bc1 complex found in t. thermophilus was also identified in strain yim 77409t ( bs74 _ rs10415 - bs74 _ rs10430 ) [ 36 , 37 ] .
the terminal cytochrome oxidase is encoded by four cytochrome c oxidase genes ctac1 ( bs74 _ rs00820 ) , caaa ( bs74 _ rs00825 ) , ctad2 ( bs74 _ rs04775 ) , and ctac2 ( bs74 _ rs04780 ) .
other cytochrome c oxidase genes observed in t. scotoductus sa - 01 , ctah , ctae1 , ctae2 , ctad1 , and coxm ( tsc _ c00960 - tsc _ c01000 ) , were not found in the yim 77409t genome .
genes involved in denitrification denitrification is a respiratory process to reduce nitrate or nitrite stepwise to nitrogen gas ( no3 - - - > no2 - - - > no - - > n2o - - > n2 ) , and plays a major role in converting bioavailable nitrogen to recalcitrant dinitrogen gas [ 38 ] .
denitrification normally occurs under oxygen - limiting conditions , and is catalyzed by four types of nitrogen oxide reductases in sequence : nitrate reductase ( nar or nap ) , nitrite reductase ( nir ) , nitric oxide reductase ( nor ) , and nitrous oxide reductase ( nos ) [ 39 , 40 ] .
previous studies have demonstrated that some thermus species have incomplete denitrification phenotypes terminating with the production of nitrite or nitrous oxide [ 16 , 41 ] .
this incomplete denitrification is partly encoded by a conjugative element ( nitrate conjugative element , nce ) that can be transferred among strains [ 42 ] .
the nce is composed of two main operons , nar and nrc , and the transcription factors dnrs and dnrt , which are required for their expression under anaerobic conditions when nitrate is present [ 43 , 44 ] .
the periplasmic nitrate reductase subunits napb and napc were not found in the genome of t. amyloliquefaciensyim 77409t , consistent with the use of the nar system in the thermales .
figure 3 shows the organization of the nar operon and neighboring genes involved in denitrification in t. amyloliquefaciensyim 77409t , t. tengchongensisyim 77401 , and t. scotoductus sa - 01 .
they are located on the chromosome in strains yim 77409t and yim 77401 , as in t. scotoductus sa - 01 .
however , these gene clusters are located on megaplasmids in t. thermophilus and t. oshimai strains [ 17 ] .
the nar operons show a high degree of synteny and consist of narcghjikt encoding the associated periplasmic cytochrome narc , the membrane - bound nitrate reductase ( narghi ) , the dedicated chaperone narj , the nitrate / proton symporter ( nark1 ) , which might also function in nitrite extrusion in t. thermophilus hb8t , and the nitrate / nitrite antiporter ( nark2 ) .
regulatory protein a and a denitrification regulator gene operon dnrst are adjacent to the nar operons .
strain yim 77409t contains a putative nirs , which encodes the isofunctional tetraheme cytochrome cd1 - containing nitrite reductase .
the nirk , encoding a cu - containing nitrite reductase in t. scotoductus sa - 01 , is absent in strain yim 77409t and yim 77401 .
genes encoding conserved hypothetical proteins , coenzyme pqq synthesis protein ( pqqe ) , and nitric oxide reductase subunit b ( norb ) and c ( norc ) were also presented in the yim 77409t genome .
genes encoding the periplasmic multicopper enzyme nitrous oxide reductase ( nos ) , which catalyzes the last step of the denitrification ( n2o - - > n2 ) , were not observed in the yim 77409t genome or in any thermus spp. genomes .
physiological experiments with nitrate as the sole terminal electron acceptor also confirm that strain yim 77409t can convert nitrate to nitrous oxide under anaerobic conditions , but not to nitrogen gas. fig. 3 molecular organization of identified nar operon and neighboring genes involved in denitrification located on the chromosome of t. amyloliquefaciens yim 77409t , t. tengchongensis yim 77401 , and t. scotoductus sa - 01 .

[ 17 ] conclusions the genus thermus is the archetypal thermophilic bacterium and has been isolated from both natural and man - made thermal environments .
members of this genus are of significance as a source of thermophilic enzymes of great biotechnological interest and as an excellent laboratory models to study the molecular basis of thermal stability .
here , we report the annotation of a high quality draft genome sequence of thermus amyloliquefaciensyim 77409t .
analysis of the genome revealed that strain yim 77409t encodes enzymes involved in complete glycolysis , pentose phosphate pathway , tricarboxylic acid cycle , pyruvate dehydrogenase , and pentose phosphate pathway .
the genome sequence of strain yim 77409t provides insights to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the incomplete denitrification phenotype and the ecological roles that thermus species play in nitrogen cycling .
combined analysis of this genome and other thermus genomes also provides important insights into the evolution and ecology of this group and the role it may play in the high - temperature nitrogen biogeochemical cycle .

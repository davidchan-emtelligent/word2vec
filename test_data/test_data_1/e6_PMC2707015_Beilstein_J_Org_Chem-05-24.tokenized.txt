under microwave irradiation , quinoxalines have been synthesized in good yields from the corresponding alpha - hydroxyketones .
quinoxalines tandem oxidation process titanium dioxide introduction titanium dioxide has found widespread industrial application ranging from whiteners in paint [ 1 ] , and additives in food [ 2 ] , to uv absorbers in sunscreen lotions [ 3 ] .
its popularity stems from its inertness , low cost , and chemical stability under irradiation [ 4 ] .
in the laboratory , its utility has been extended to the photodegradation of pesticides [ 5 ] and carcinogenic dyes [ 6 ] , to sterilization against bacteria [ 7 ]. from a synthetic chemistry point of view , titanium dioxide 's main use has been to oxidize alcohols to its corresponding carbonyl derivatives which has been reported many times [ 8 - 10 ] .
titanium dioxide has also been used to synthesize dihydropyrazines [ 11 ] , piperazines [ 12 ] , and quinoxalines [ 13 ] although in low yields .
herein , we describe the application of titanium dioxide in conjunction with 2,2,6,6 - tetramethylpiperidine - 1 - oxyl radical ( tempo ) as an oxidant in the synthesis of quinoxalines , via the tandem oxidation process ( top ) ( scheme 1 ) .
scheme 1 titanium dioxide / tempo mediated synthesis of quinoxalines .
results and discussion titanium dioxide in the anatase phase is a photocatalyst with a band gap of 3.2 ev corresponding to a wavelength of 387 nm [ 14 ] .
thus , we attempted to evaluate titanium dioxide as a potential top type catalyst based on the excellent work of taylor and co - workers [ 15 - 16 ] by examining its behaviour under various energy sources ( table 1 ) .

cabsence of solvent .
titanium dioxide is known to be highly reactive under sunlight [ 17 ] and this seemed to be the most obvious starting point .
initially , 2 - hydroxyacetophenone was reacted with o - phenylenediamine under natural sunlight .
we were delighted to observe the formation of the quinoxaline derivative in an isolated yield of 90 % in 3 h. while encouraged by this result we immediately realized the limitations of this procedure .
the use of an incandescent lamp gave a disappointing yield of 25 % while a low wattage uv light afforded an equally disappointing yield of 10 % in 3 h. we explored the use of microwave energy , which has been claimed to substantially improve reaction rates [ 18 ] .
surprisingly , the use of microwave energy produced the best result with the quinoxaline derivative isolated in a yield of 87 % in 10 min. with the optimized procedure in hand , an investigation into the scope of the methodology , using a range of alcohols and diamines , was conducted ( table 2 ) .

bisolated as a mixture of regioisomers .
after the successful synthesis of quinoxaline 3a , the effect of an alkyl substituent was explored , which is often claimed to be problematic due to the ' hyper - reactivity ' of the intermediate keto - aldehyde [ 19 ] .
the reaction afforded the quinoxaline derivative 3b in a satisfactory isolated yield of 60 % .
the coupling of secondary alcohols 1c and 1d both proceeded smoothly , even though the hindered alcohol 1c required a longer reaction time .
finally , the diamine component was varied ( entries v - vii ) with satisfactory yields obtained for both primary and secondary alcohols .
concerning the mechanism , when titanium dioxide is irradiated with an appropriate energy source , electrons are promoted from the valence band to the conduction band leaving behind positive holes in the valence band [ 20 ] .
the positive holes and electrons migrate to the surface where the holes react with water ( or bound hydroxyl groups ) to produce hydroxyl radicals which are strong oxidants [ 21 ] .
nevertheless , the activation of titanium dioxide under microwave irradiation is surprising since uv light is more intense than microwave energy .
however , low levels of hydroxyl radical formation have been reported when titanium dioxide was subjected to microwave irradiation [ 22 ] .
it has been suggested [ 23 ] that microwave energy can couple with a crystalline solid generating a non - thermal distribution , resulting in an increase in ion mobility , which leads to the diffusion of electrons and positive holes to the surface and subsequent hydroxyl radical formation [ 24 ] .
it is believed that a similar interaction is taking place in our system and in conjunction with tempo lead to the formation of keto - aldehydes or diketones , which are trapped in situ to produce the required products .
in an attempt to extend the methodology , a preliminary investigation into a titanium dioxide mediated tandem wittig reaction was attempted in which the intermediate aldehyde is trapped by a stabilised phosphorane .
unfortunately , nmr spectroscopic analysis revealed a multitude of peaks , none of which were attributable to the product .
it is believed that this is due to the non - selective nature of the hydroxyl radicals [ 25 ] .
currently studies are under way to moderate the reactivity of the titanium dioxide .
in a recent publication [ 26 ] , zhao and co - workers reported the use of dye - sensitized titanium dioxide and tempo for the selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones .
in our studies we have been examining similar systems with a view to incorporating them into tandem type processes .
conclusion in summary , we have reported the use of titanium dioxide as a tandem oxidation catalyst , demonstrated by the rapid synthesis of quinoxalines under microwave irradiation .
the process is advantageous due to the green credentials and low cost of the oxidant , short reaction times and good yields .
experimental 2 - phenylquinoxaline ( 3a ) 2 - hydroxyacetophenone ( 0.068 g , 0.50 mmol ) , o - phenylenediamine ( 0.054 g , 0.50 mmol ) , titanium dioxide ( 0.040 g , 0.50 mmol ) and tempo ( 0.008 g , 0.050 mmol ) were added to a sealed 10 ml cem discover ( r ) reaction vial equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar .
the reaction vial was irradiated ( at 150 w with cooling ) for 10 min ( 2 x 5 min ) at 150 degreesc , after which the vessel was rapidly cooled to 50 degreesc by the unit .
the reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane ( dcm ) and passed through a short silica plug .
the solvent was removed in vacuo to produce a crude product which was purified using radial chromatography ( 3:1 pe : etoac ) to afford the pure product .

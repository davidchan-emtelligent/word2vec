several measuring methods are used to assess the avr on plain radiographs , including the visual nash and moe , perdriolle 's torsion meter and raimondi 's table , all of which have positive and negative aspects [ 1 - 3 ] .
purpose we developed an avr image scale of 0 - 55degrees rotation , pre - determined , to assess its ease of use as a visual method when comparing the mean inter - and intra - reliability against perdriolle 's and raimondi 's scales .
method a human lumbar vertebra ( l4 ) set on a rotating device , and a series of x rays were taken , at 1 degree increments , from 0 - 55degrees clockwise rotation .
these images were flipped to produce 0 - 55degrees counterclockwise rotation .
the apical rotations of 39 curves was measured by three different observers ( each having more than three years of experience specializing in the field of scoliosis ) using the spinecor avr scale , perdriolle 's torsion meter and raimondi 's table .
the measurements were taken twice , with a minimum of one week between each measurement .
results the inter - rater mean difference for the spinecor avr scale versus both perdriolle 's and raimondi 's was the same ( within 0.01degrees ) but this mean difference was greater than the mean difference between raimondi 's and perdriolle 's by 0.48degrees and 0.49degrees respectively ( spinecor avr scale versus raimondi = mean difference of 4.18degrees sd +/ - 2.04degrees , spinecor avr scale v perdriolle 's = mean difference 4.19degrees sd +/ - 2.05degrees , raimondi 's v perdriolle 's = 3.70degrees sd +/ - 1.92degrees ) ; the intra - rater mean difference was 1.07degrees greater with the spinecor avr scales than with perdriolle 's and 0.45degrees greater than raimondi 's table ( intra - rater mean difference for the three testers with spinecor images = 2.29degrees sd +/ - 0.44degrees , with raimondi 's = 1.84degrees sd +/ - 0.39degrees and with perdriolle 's = 1.22degrees sd +/ - 0.44degrees ) .
conclusions and discussion the spinecor avr scales demonstrated high intra - reliability mean differences with a mean difference of 2.29degrees sd +/ - 0.44degrees and inter - reliability of 4.18degrees +/ - 2.04degrees sd and 4.19degrees +/ - 2.05degrees sd , which does appear to demonstrate favourable intra - and inter - reliability in comparison to both perdriolle 's and raimondi 's scales [ 1,2 ] .

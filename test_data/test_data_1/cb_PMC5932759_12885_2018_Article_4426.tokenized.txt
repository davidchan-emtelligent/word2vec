background short telomeres have been associated with increased risk of many cancers , particularly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract including esophagus and stomach .
however , the association between telomere length ( tl ) and colorectal cancer and its precursors , colorectal polyps , is not clear .
methods we investigated the relationship between tl and risk of colorectal polyp subtypes in a colonoscopy - based study in western washington .
participants were 35 - 79 year - old enrollees at an integrated health care system , who underwent a colonoscopy between 1998 and 2007 ( n = 190 ) , completed a self - administered questionnaire , provided blood samples , and were distinguished as having adenomas , serrated polyps , or as polyp - free controls through a standardized pathology review .
telomere length ( t ) relative to a single copy gene ( s ) was measured in circulating leukocytes from stored buffy coat samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction .
multivariable polytomous logistic regression was used to compare case groups with polyp - free controls and other case groups ; adjusted odds ratios ( or ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( ci ) were estimated .
results tl in the shortest tertile ( t / s ratio < 0.58 ) was associated with increased risk of adenomas and serrated polyps [ or ( 95 % ci ) were 1.77 ( 0.81 - 3.88 ) and 2.98 ( 1.15 - 7.77 ) , respectively ) .
when evaluated by lesion severity within each pathway , short tl was more strongly associated with advanced adenomas and sessile serrated polyps [ or ( 95 % ci ) = 1.90 ( 0.76 - 4.73 ) and 3.82 ( 0.86 - 16.86 ) , respectively ] , although the associations were not statistically significant .
conclusions our results suggest that short tl may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps in both the adenoma - carcinoma and serrated pathways .
the risk was particularly notable for sessile serrated polyps , although the association was not statistically significant and sample size was limited .

advanced adenomas are known precursor lesions to crc within the adenoma - carcinoma pathway , while sessile serrated adenomas / polyps ( ssa / ps ) , are precursors on the serrated pathway [ 1 ] .
currently , colorectal polyps are not diagnosed until colonoscopy , an expensive and invasive procedure .
moreover , advanced adenomas are diagnosed in about 6 % of those undergoing colonoscopy ; rate of ssa / p diagnosis is lower [ 2 ] .
if reliable biomarkers that enable risk stratification to identify those at highest risk for progression to crc can be identified , patients could be triaged to tailored screening and surveillance regimes that coincide with their level of risk .
one such potential biomarker of interest is telomere length ( tl ) .
telomeres , the dna repeat sequences at ends of chromosomes , play an important role in maintaining genomic integrity [ 3 ] .
short tl has been evaluated as a biomarker for ageing , and age - related conditions , including cancers ; particularly of the gastrointestinal tract [ 4 ] .
the relationship between shortened telomeres and risk of sporadic colorectal cancers , however , is not yet clear .
here , we evaluate the association between tl and the risk for colorectal polyp subtypes .
methods study population the study population for the current project was derived from a parent study within kaiser permanente washington , a large integrated healthcare provider in western washington state .
details of the parent study have been previously published [ 5 ] .
we selected 35 - 79 year old enrollees who had undergone an index colonoscopy for any indication from 1998 to 2003 ( phase 1 ) and 2004 - 2007 ( phase 2 ) , and had available stored genomic dna ( n = 190 ) .
participants with a previous colonoscopy within the past year , a history of crc or other colorectal diseases , familial colorectal cancer syndromes , and past partial resection of the colon were excluded .
written informed consent was obtained from all study participants and institutional review boards at both fred hutchinson cancer research center and kaiser permanente washington approved the study .
data collection and case / control ascertainment participants in both phases completed a structured questionnaire to collect information on risk factors , and medical , family , and colorectal cancer screening history .
biopsies taken at the time of index colonoscopy received a standardized pathology review , as described elsewhere [ 5 ] .
participants were diagnosed as having adenomas ( tubular , villous or tubulovillous adenomas ) , serrated polyps ( hyperplastic polyps , traditional serrated adenomas , or ssa / ps ) , or both .
polyp - free controls were identified during index colonoscopy , and reflected the age distribution and diagnosis year of the polyp cases .
adenomas >= 10 mm in diameter or with >= 20 % villous components or exhibiting high - grade dysplasia were classified as advanced adenomas ( non - advanced otherwise ) .
ssa / ps were considered as advanced lesions , while hyperplastic polyps were considered to be non - advanced lesions in the serrated polyps subgroup .
telomere length measurement genomic dna was extracted from lymphocytes ( phase 1 ) or buccal dna ( phase 2 ) using the qiagen qiaamp dna extraction kit ( qiagen inc. , valencia , ca ) and stored at - 80 degreesc .
telomere length ( t ) relative to a single copy gene 36b4 ( s ) was measured using a singleplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qpcr ) , as described by cawthon [ 6 ] .
all assays were run in triplicate and a standard laboratory control was run on each plate .
each plate run was then assessed for efficiency and precision ( r2 ) using the standard curve generated using the laboratory control .
r2 values for the telomere and control gene standard curves were greater than 0.98 , demonstrating great precision .
efficiency for the telomere and control gene pcrs were between 99 % and 110 % .
the mean normalized t / s ratio was used for the statistical analysis .
statistical analyses multivariable polytomous logistic regression was used to compare case groups ( adenomas only , serrated polyps only , or both ) with each other and with polyp - free controls .
odds ratios ( or ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) for short tl ( shortest telomere tertile ; t / s ratio < 0.58 ) were computed adjusting for age , sex , race , smoking status , body mass index , and use of anti - inflammatory drugs these factors were selected a priori based on evidence from prior studies reporting associations between them and tl or colorectal polyps .
wald p - values were calculated to compare heterogeneity between case groups .
analyses evaluating associations between tl and lesion severity included persons with synchronous adenomas and serrated polyps within both the adenoma as well as serrated pathway groups ( fig. 1 ) , because we were interested in evaluating the differences between advanced and non - advanced lesions within a particular pathway , irrespective of the presence of polyp lesions from another pathway .
all analyses were performed using stata ( v14.0 ; stata corp ). fig. 1 study participants' outcomes based on index colonoscopy results of the 190 study participants with available dna specimens , 80 were classified as having adenomas , 33 as serrated polyps , 28 as having both adenomas and serrated polyps , and were compared to 49 polyp - free controls .
demographic comparisons between polyp subtype cases and controls are shown in table 1 .
participants with adenomas only were slightly older and more likely than controls to be male and former smokers .
in contrast , study participants with serrated polyps only were more likely to be female , current / former smokers , and obese .
cases were similar to controls with respect to other lifestyle exposures such as their educational status , and anti - inflammatory drug use .

having tl in the shortest tertile ( t / s ratio < 0.58 ) was associated with an increased risk of serrated polyps [ adjusted or ( 95 % ci ) = 2.98 ( 1.15,7.77 )] even after adjustment for confounding effects of age , sex , race , smoking status , body mass index , and use of anti - inflammatory drugs .
short tls were also modestly and non - significantly associated with increased adenoma risk [ or ( 95 % ci ) = 1.77 ( 0.81,3.88 )] in adjusted models .
when evaluated by lesion severity within each pathway , short telomeres appeared to be more strongly associated with advanced adenomas [ or ( 95 % ci ) = 1.90 ( 0.76,4.73 )] and sessile serrated polyps [ or ( 95 % ci ) = 3.82 ( 0.86,16.86 )] , although these associations did not reach statistical significance .
lastly , we did not find any evidence for heterogeneity in the associations with short tl for adenomas vs. serrated polyps ( p for heterogeneity = 0.42 ) or for lesion severity comparisons within the adenoma and serrated pathways .

two case - control studies nested within large cohorts observed a lack of association between tl and crc [ 7 - 9 ] .
conversely , pooley et al. have reported significantly shorter telomeres in circulating leukocytes among crc cases than controls [ 10 ] .
more recently , a large population - wide danish study of over 47,000 individuals reported no association , while a chinese study reported increased crc risk with shorter tl [ 9 , 11 ] .
summarizing these findings , a very recent meta - analysis noted that the available evidence is insufficient to understand the exact role of telomere length in the development of colorectal cancer , and highlighted the need for future studies [ 12 ] .
fewer studies have evaluated the relationship between colorectal cancer precursor lesions and tl. a recent report suggested an increased risk for advanced adenomas in persons with short leukocyte tl [ 13 ] ; however , this study was relatively small ( 35 advanced adenomas cases ) and did not evaluate the relationship with serrated polyps .
roger et al. reported in an experimental setting that extensive tissue telomere erosion may lead to chromosomal instability and initiation of crc in polyps from familial adenomatous polyposis patients [ 14 ] .
the authors hypothesize that this may be a potential mechanism resulting in chromosomal instability and malignant transformation .
another cross - sectional study found that tl in large adenoma lesions (> 2 cm ) was significantly shorter than normal surrounding tissue from the same individuals [ 15 ] .
taken together , these studies suggest that telomere shortening may play a role in the development of both colorectal polyps and / or crc .
however , further studies are required to better understand the role of tl ( and the point at which they may act ) in the pathological progression in colorectal neoplasia .
our analysis is an important addition to the literature , because it is the first study to report a statistically significant association of tl with serrated polyps , suggesting that telomeres may play an important role along the entire serrated pathway .
there was also a suggestion of increased risk , particularly , for ssa / ps. ssa / ps are newly - recognized precursors to crc [ 16 ] ; thus , this finding may provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms for cancer progression within the serrated pathway .
further work is warranted to determine whether tl can serve as a reliable biomarker for such a neoplastic progression .
our study is larger than most other studies of colorectal polyps and tl , but it is nonetheless limited by sample size , particularly as colorectal polyp cases were further divided into smaller subgroups based on lesion severity .
however , this enabled us to look at differences within sub - classes of colorectal polyps .
also , misclassification of disease status in some cases and controls is possible , particularly with respect to the harder to visualize ssa / ps. however , such misclassification would be non - differential and would bias estimates towards the null .
hence , our reported positive association with serrated polyps is conservative .
finally , although we have controlled for major potential confounders , including age , sex , smoking , body mass index , and inflammation , we cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding by measured and unmeasured risk factors .
strengths of our study include the high - quality and detailed characterization of colorectal polyp cases and controls using colonoscopy and standardized pathology review , which enabled us to evaluate the relationship between short telomeres and various polyp subtypes .
additionally , to our knowledge , this is the first study to report associations between short telomeres and advanced polyps within the serrated pathway .
conclusions in conclusion , short telomeres were associated with an increased risk of colorectal polyps in both the adenoma - carcinoma and serrated pathways , although the increased risk was statistically significant only for serrated polyps .
among individuals with serrated polyps , the risk associated with short telomeres appeared stronger , but not statistically significant , for those with ssa / ps. future prospective studies are needed to define the temporal sequence between tl and these high risk lesions , and to elucidate the role of telomeres as a biomarker for crc risk stratification .

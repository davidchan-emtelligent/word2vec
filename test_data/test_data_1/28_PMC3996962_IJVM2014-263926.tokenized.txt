diabetes mellitus is associated with worse angiographic and clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ). aim .
to investigate the impact of manual thrombus aspiration on in - stent restenosis ( isr ) and clinical outcome in patients treated by bare - metal stent ( bms ) implantation for st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ). methods .
100 diabetic patients were prospectively enrolled .
they were randomly assigned to undergo either standard primary pci ( group a , 50 patients ) or pci with thrombus aspiration using export catheter ( group b , 50 patients ) .
the primary endpoint was the rate of eight - month isr .
the secondary endpoint included follow - up for major adverse cardiac events ( mace ). results .
mean age of the study cohort was 59.86 +/ - 8.3 years , with 64 ( 64 %) being males .
baseline characteristics did not differ between both groups .
eight - month angiogram showed that group b patients had significantly less late lumen loss ( 0.17 +/ - 0.35 versus 0.60 +/ - 0.42 mm , p < 0.001 ) , with lower incidence of isr ( 4 % versus 16.6 % , p < 0.001 ) .
there was a trend towards lower rate of mace in the same group of patients. conclusion .
in diabetic patients undergoing primary pci , manual thrombus aspiration ( compared with standard pci ) was associated with better isr rate after bms implantation .
1. introduction acute myocardial infarction ( mi ) with st - segment elevation is caused by rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque , initiating intraluminal thrombosis resulting in occlusion of a coronary artery [ 1 - 3 ] .
primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) is the preferred treatment for mi with st - segment elevation and is effective in opening the infarct - related artery [ 4 - 6 ] .
however , microvascular obstruction with diminished myocardial perfusion occurs in a large proportion of patients with patent epicardial vessels after primary pci , and this event is associated with an increased infarct size , reduced recovery of ventricular function , and increased mortality [ 7 - 11 ] .
microvascular obstruction is related to the embolization of plaque or thrombotic material downstream in the infarct - related artery [ 12 , 13 ] .
embolization can occur spontaneously or by means of mechanical fragmentation during pci [ 12 - 15 ] .
the high frequency of suboptimal myocardial reperfusion after primary pci has resulted in the development of various devices to protect the microcirculation [ 16 - 24 ] .
other proposed mechanisms contributing to microvascular obstruction and dysfunction include reperfusion injury , production of oxygen free radicals , neutrophil activation , endothelial and myocyte edema , loss of antioxidant enzymes , cardiomyocyte apoptosis , loss of endothelial mediated vasomotion , alteration of sympathetic innervation , plugging of platelets and neutrophils , epicardial coronary vasoconstriction , and increased myocardial cell calcium level [ 25 ] .
it is proposed that the resulting cellular dysfunction , apoptosis , and necrosis mediate myocardial stunning , no - reflow , reperfusion arrhythmias , and additional loss of myocardium ( lethal reperfusion injury ) [ 26 ] .
diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for poor outcome after pci using bare - metal stents [ 27 - 29 ] .
a more diffused and accelerated form of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients , accompanied by small vessel size , long lesions , and greater plaque burden , may contribute to the well - documented increased risk of restenosis after stent implantation in these patients [ 30 ] .
in the current study , the author sought to explore the impact of upfront manual thrombus aspiration on angiographic ( in - stent restenosis ) and clinical outcomes , in diabetic patients treated by bare - metal stent implantation for acute st - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( stemi ) .
2. methods 2.1 .
study design and data collection 100 consecutive diabetic patients suffering from acute stemi were prospectively enrolled in this study .
they were referred to the catheterization laboratory on emergency basis , after being presented to the emergency department ( ed ) , in the period between march 2011 and january 2013 .
all included patients suffered from insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( iddm ) .
other inclusion criteria included symptoms suggesting acute myocardial ischemia lasting > 30 minutes , the onset of symptoms < 12 hours before presentation to ed , and st - segment elevation of > 0.1 mv in two or more leads on the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) .
exclusion criteria included patients undergoing rescue pci after thrombolysis , patients with prior history of unstable angina or mi , those with prior pci or coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) surgery , and those with congenital heart disease or any myocardial disease apart from ischemia .
patients with limited life expectancy due to coexistent disease , for example , malignancy , were excluded .
after enrollment and before coronary angiography , patients were randomly assigned in 1 : 1 fashion to undergo either standard pci ( group a ) or pci with thrombus aspiration ( group b ) , according to a computer - generated random series of numbers .
randomization was performed by block randomization ( blocks of 10 patients ) .
physicians participating in pci procedures were unaware of block randomization .
before inclusion , informed written consent was obtained from each patient and the study protocol was reviewed and approved by our local institutional human research committee , as it conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 declaration of helsinki , as revised in 2008 .
2.2 .
definition of risk factors of coronary artery disease the presence of hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmhg and / or diastolic blood pressure >= 90 mmhg , previously recorded by repeated noninvasive office measurements , which led to life - style modification and / or intake of antihypertensive drug therapy [ 31 ] .
the presence of diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting plasma glucose >= 126 mg / dl and / or two - hour postglucose load >= 200 mg / dl or specific antidiabetic drug therapy intake [ 32 ] .
dyslipidemia was defined as ldl cholesterol > 100 mg / dl and / or serum triglycerides > 150 mg / dl and / or hdl cholesterol < 40 mg / dl (< 50 mg / dl in women ) [ 33 ] .
2.3 .
pci and medications coronary angioplasty and stent implantation were performed according to institutional standards .
for all patients , the first procedural step was the passing of a floppy , steerable guide wire through the target culprit lesion ; direct stenting was left to operator 's discretion and usually performed in patent vessel with no or mild calcification .
in patients in the conventional pci group ( group a ) , this step was followed by balloon dilation to establish antegrade flow .
concerning patients in the thrombus aspiration group ( group b ) , this step was followed by the advancing of the 6f export aspiration catheter ( medtronic , minneapolis , mn ; crossing profile , 0.068 in. ) into the target coronary segment during continuous aspiration .
aspiration was started proximal to the occluded site , gently pushing the catheter through the occlusion and then pulling it in a proximal direction , keeping negative pressure even when the occlusion was crossed or when there was no longer back bleeding in the syringe .
withdrawal of the catheter from the artery and from the guiding catheter was performed with permanent negative pressure .
when necessary for stent delivery , balloon dilation was performed before stenting .
in all patients , after the restoration of antegrade flow , intracoronary nitrates were given to ensure maximal epicardial vasodilatation , to determine the size and length of the required stent , and to facilitate stent placement .
all placed stents were bare - metal stents .
pharmacological treatment before pci included the administration of aspirin ( a loading dose of 500 mg ) , heparin ( 70 iu / kg ) , and clopidogrel ( a loading dose of 600 mg ) .
all patients also received the glycoprotein iib / iiia inhibitor abciximab with an intravenous procedural bolus of 0.25 mg / kg followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.125 mug / kg / min for 12 hours and postprocedural infusion without heparin .
the primary endpoint was the rate of in - stent restenosis after eight months of follow - up , defined as angiographic luminal diameter stenosis by > 50 % using quantitative coronary angiography ( qca ) .
the secondary endpoint included follow - up for major adverse cardiac events ( mace ) , that is , a composite of death due to cardiac cause , nonfatal myocardial infarction , and target lesion revascularization ( tlr ) .
2.4 .
quantitative coronary angiography ( qca ) intracoronary nitroglycerine was administered before the initial , final , and follow - up angiograms to achieve maximal vasodilatation .
thrombolysis in myocardial infarction ( timi ) flow grade was recorded individually when flow restoration attempts were finalized .
contrast - filled guide catheters were used as the reference standard in qca .
matched end - diastolic frames of the angiograms before and after pci and at eight - month follow - up were analyzed using a contour detection minimum cost algorithm ( qca - cms version 3.0 , medis , leiden , the netherlands ) .
restenosis was defined as a stent stenosis > 50 % in diameter anywhere within the stent and / or within the 5 mm borders proximal or distal to the stent .
late lumen loss was defined as the difference between minimal lumen diameters ( mld ) immediately after pci and on eight - month follow - up angiography .
qca analyses were performed by an experienced technician who was blinded to patients' assignment .
2.5 .
statistics all continuous variables were statistically described in terms of mean +/ - standard deviation (+/ - sd ) .
categorical variables were described with absolute and relative ( percentage ) frequencies .
comparison of continuous variables between the study groups was done using student 's t - test .
for comparing categorical data , pearson 's chi - square test was performed .
p values were used to describe significance .
all statistical calculations were done using statistical package for social sciences ( spss for windows ) software ( version 15.0 , spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) .
3. results 3.1 .
baseline clinical characteristics a total of 100 consecutive iddm patients suffering from acute stemi were prospectively enrolled in the current study , which comprises 50 patients randomly assigned to undergo conventional pci ( group a ) and 50 others randomly assigned to undergo pci with thrombus aspiration ( group b ) .
the mean age of the whole study cohort was 59.86 +/ - 8.3 years , with 64 ( 64 %) being male patients .
the two groups were matched regarding age , gender , and risk factors of coronary artery disease ( cad ) .
no significant difference was recorded between the two groups ; concerning baseline mean serum hba1c levels .
table 1 shows baseline clinical characteristics of the two study groups .
all patients underwent follow - up coronary angiography after eight months , except for six patients .
five ( group a : three patients , group b : two patients ) patients had definite late (> 30 days after primary pci ) stent thrombosis and target lesion revascularization , while one patient belonging to group a died after 220 days , and thus a possible stent thrombosis is considered .
so , follow - up angiograms were available in 94 ( 94 %) patients ( group a : n = 46 , group b : n = 48 ) .
blood samples were drawn for hba1c quantitation at the day of follow - up of coronary angiography and revealed almost the same mean results ( group a : 7.02 +/ - 0.3 % , group b : 7.07 +/ - 0.4 % ; p > 0.05 ) .
3.2 .
lesion and procedure characteristics table 2 shows lesion and procedure characteristics .
no statistically significant difference was recorded between the two study groups regarding lesion length , stent length , need for stent postdilatation , and frequency of stenting of each coronary artery .
however , incidence of angiographic no - reflow was significantly less in group b patients ( p < 0.05 ) .
moreover , more patients in the same group showed timi iii flow grade after culprit lesion stenting ( p < 0.05 ) .
no serious periprocedural complications were recorded in both study groups .
3.3 .
quantitative angiographic outcomes angiographic measures are shown in table 3 .
angiographic follow - up was obtained for 98 patients ( 98 %) , at a mean of 247.1 +/ - 27.4 days .
late luminal loss was found to be less in the group b ( 0.17 +/ - 0.35 mm versus 0.60 +/ - 0.42 ; p < 0.001 ) .
also , the percentage of stenosis ( in - stent restenosis ) at follow - up was less in the same group ( 22.2 +/ - 9.7 in group b versus 35.37 +/ - 14.46 in group a ; p < 0.001 ) .
the rate of in - stent restenosis ( primary endpoint ) , defined as luminal diameter stenosis of > 50 percent , was 4 % ( n = 2 ) in group b versus 16.6 % ( n = 8 ) in group a ( p < 0.001 ) .
3.4 .
clinical events clinical follow - up data revealed that 11 patients experienced major adverse cardiac events ( mace ) as shown in table 4 , with no statistical difference between both study groups but a trend towards lower incidence in group b. five patients suffered from definite stent thrombosis and trl was done .
only one patient ( belonging to group a ) died during the follow - up period with possible stent thrombosis .
4. discussion the clinical importance of embolization of atherothrombotic materials from unstable plaques in patients with myocardial infarction with st - segment elevation has been recognized [ 12 , 15 ] , and the use of thrombectomy aspiration devices to reduce distal embolization , preserving tissue - level perfusion , has been tested in several studies with conflicting results [ 16 , 17 , 20 - 24 , 34 - 38 ] .
results achieved using different techniques to explore different aspects of microvascular integrity further enhance the strength of the tested hypothesis that distal embolization during primary pci plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of microvascular obstruction .
this was because thrombus aspiration significantly reduces the severity and extent of the phenomenon [ 39 ] .
despite early invasive strategies and optimal medical treatment , morbidity and mortality rates for stemi continue to be high .
thus , further improvement of the initial therapy is necessary to improve patient outcome .
the pivotal tapas ( thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention in acute myocardial infarction study ) trial of patients with stemi , which compared a strategy with thrombectomy with a strategy without thrombectomy , showed a reduction in cardiac mortality at one year [ 38 ]. by contrast , other randomized , controlled studies did not observe superiority of thrombectomy over standard pci with respect to surrogate endpoints of reperfusion success [ 40 , 41 ] .
however , meta - analyses in patients with stemi showed a mortality - related benefit after thrombectomy compared with pci alone [ 42 , 43 ] .
therefore , the current guidelines of the european society of cardiology ( esc ) on revascularization therapy in patients with stemi reperfused by primary pci have increased the recommendation class for manual thrombectomy from the previous class iib , level of evidence b , to class iia , level of evidence a [ 44 ] .
in line with the esc guidelines , thrombectomy is strongly recommended by the american heart association / american college of cardiology ( aha / acc ) guidelines ( class iia , level of evidence b ) [ 45 ] .
the current study sought to evaluate the clinical and angiographic outcome of thrombus aspiration during primary pci in diabetic patients presented with stemi .
eligible patients were randomly assigned to either primary pci with thrombus aspiration or standard pci .
bare - metal stents were used in all patients .
bare - metal stents are still the only available option ( especially on emergency basis ) for percutaneous revascularization in most of centers located in developing countries .
the current study was accomplished in one of these countries , where there is still a considerable cost burden concerning the use of drug - eluting stents ( dess ) .
patients who underwent primary pci with thrombus aspiration showed significantly higher incidence of final timi iii flow and less incidence of angiographic no - reflow phenomenon .
eight - month follow - up coronary angiography showed favorable qca results concerning the same group of patients with statistically significant less incidence of in - stent restenosis , less percentage of diameter stenosis , and less late lumen loss .
it is worth mentioning that mean culprit lesion length and mean used stent length did not differ between patients belonging to thrombus aspiration strategy and others belonging to standard pci strategy .
no recorded significant difference between both study groups concerning follow - up for mace after the same period of time , that is , eight months .
however , there was a recorded case of cardiac mortality , possibly stent thrombosis , and a case of definite stent thrombosis mounting to target lesion revascularization in the standard pci group of patients .
the presented results highlighted the favorable impact of thrombus aspiration , during primary pci in diabetic patients , on incidence of in - stent restenosis and consequently the other qca parameters .
although the favorable clinical impact of thrombus aspiration did not reach a statistical significance ( when compared to the angiographic impact ) , numerical values still show that adopting thrombus aspiration strategy was associated with less incidence of mace .
a larger number of patients for a longer follow - up period might magnify the obtained follow - up clinical results .
the author hypothesized that adopting thrombus aspiration strategy in this clinical setting could improve both angiographic and clinical outcomes encountered in diabetic patients , especially those who are managed using bare - metal stents .
4.1 .
comparison with other studies previous studies demonstrated safety and merits of using thrombus aspiration devices in primary pci prior to coronary stenting , especially concerning myocardial salvage and improved myocardial reperfusion [ 20 , 22 , 46 - 49 ] .
however , this was not always associated with reduction of infarct size [ 42 , 47 ] .
the current study results showed better early angiographic outcomes upon using thrombus aspiration device in diabetic patients in the setting of primary pci , in the form of higher frequency of timi iii flow and less frequent no - reflow phenomenon .
this was also demonstrated by previous trials [ 41 , 49 , 50 ] , not specifically targeting diabetic patients .
a previous trial reported the favorable impact of using thrombus aspiration ( in primary pci ) on incidence of in - stent restenosis [ 51 ] .
however , this trial also was not addressing diabetic patients in particular .
to the best of the author 's knowledge , the current study is a unique one , exploring the impact of aspiration thrombectomy on in - stent restenosis in diabetic patients .
the current study utilized export aspiration catheter for upfront thrombus aspiration as was previously proven to be effective and safe in primary pci [ 41 , 49 , 51 ] .
in agreement with the results of the current study , prior trials reported satisfactory intermediate and long - term follow - up clinical outcomes , favoring adopting thrombectomy strategy in primary pci settings [ 49 , 51 ] .
it is worth mentioning that all patients in both current study groups were assumed to exhibit more or less controlled blood glucose during the follow - up period as shown in mean hba1c levels tested shortly before follow - up angiograms .
so , quality of glycemic control during the follow - up period was not a determining factor for incidence of in - stent restenosis in the present study .
a prior study stated that proper glycemic control was associated with lower incidence of in - stent restenosis at six - month follow - up , after acute stemi [ 52 ] .
however , thrombectomy aspiration procedure was not included in the study protocol .
4.2 .
clinical implications diabetes mellitus was proven to be associated with worse angiographic ( in - stent restenosis , target lesion revascularization , and stent thrombosis ) and clinical ( mace ) outcomes after pci , regardless of the type of the used stent [ 53 ]. that is why interventionalists are always attempting to optimize the procedural circumstances , in order to achieve satisfactory short - and long - term results in diabetic patients .
the current study highlighted the favorable impact of thrombus aspiration on late angiographic and clinical outcomes in diabetic patients undergoing primary pci , using bare - metal stents .
the author recommends adopting thrombus aspiration strategy , whenever possible , in the aforementioned clinical setting .
4.3 .
limitations of the study the data presented in our study only apply for patients defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria .
moreover , this is a single - centre study with a relatively small sample size of the cohort .
2d - qca was used for angiographic assessment in the present study .
subsequent studies are needed to verify the obtained results using 3d - qca and / or intravascular ultrasound ( ivus ) .
follow - up period in the current study was limited to eight months .
a longer follow - up period is warranted for confirmation of the current study results , perhaps with the use of dess .
assessment of successful tissue reperfusion and infarct size was not included in the current study , as these parameters were outside the scope of the study protocol .
5. conclusion successful upfront manual thrombus aspiration ( in diabetic patients on insulin therapy ) during primary pci showed beneficial effects on the reduction of in - stent restenosis after bare - metal stent implantation compared with standard pci .

background human herpesvirus - 8 ( hhv - 8 ) , the etiologic agent of kaposi sarcoma ( ks ) , establishes lifelong latent infection with periodic lytic replication (" shedding ") at mucosal sites , especially the oropharynx .
patterns of hhv - 8 shedding are not well understood , and require elucidation to better predict risk of hhv - 8 related malignancies in those infected .
we sought to characterize patterns of hhv - 8 oropharyngeal shedding among diverse cohorts that enrolled hhv - 8 seropositive persons .
methods we quantified hhv - 8 oral shedding using pcr among hhv - 8 seropositive persons who collected at least 14 days of oral swabs in 22 studies on 3 continents .
we excluded persons taking antivirals during sampling or any prior use of antiretrovirals in those who were hiv - infected .
results 248 participants were enrolled from the us , peru , cameroon , uganda , and kenya ; 61 % were men , 58 % were hiv seropositive , and 16 % had ks. overall , 3,123 of 10,557 samples ( 29.6 %) had hhv - 8 detected .
quantity of virus shed was highly correlated with shedding rate , ( rho = 0.72 , p < 0.0001 ) .
hhv - 8 was detected in >= 1 sample in 55 % of participants with a median of 7 % of days in the us and kenya , 0 % in uganda and peru , and 18 % in cameroon .
median episode duration was three days , and episodes with high median quantity lasted longer ( 42 vs 3 days , p < 0.0001 ) .
in persons with multiple observations over time , 66 % of shedding rate variance was attributable to differences between individuals .
conclusions in hhv - 8 infected individuals from diverse settings , oral mucosal shedding rate , quantity , and duration were correlated ; individual shedding was highly variable .
studies are needed to determine factors accounting for between - person variation and the relationship of hhv - 8 shedding to development of associated diseases .

shedding is most commonly detected at the oropharynx , which is thought to be the site of transmission , primary hhv - 8 latency and reactivation [ 2 - 4 ] .
prevalence of hhv - 8 infection is geographically variable , in > 60 % of adults in uganda and other sub - saharan african ( ssa ) countries [ 5 , 6 ] and as low as 3.3 % in healthy americans [ 7 , 8 ] .
while in most people hhv - 8 is asymptomatic , hhv - 8 replication is considered to be integral to the development and maintenance of kaposi sarcoma ( ks ) .
other sequelae of the infection include multicentric castleman disease ( mcd ) , primary effusion lymphoma as well as the recently described khsv inflammatory cytokine syndrome [ 9 - 12 ] .
despite high seroprevalence of hhv - 8 in many regions , hhv - 8 associated diseases are relatively uncommon , except in the endemic regions of ssa , or in persons with advanced immunosuppression .
ks remains the second most prevalent cancer in men and the fifth most prevalent cancer in women in the who africa region [ 13 ] .
previous work by our group demonstrated that hhv - 8 mucosal shedding is associated with presence of ks and male sex , but not with hiv infection [ 4 ] .
prior studies assessing oral hhv - 8 shedding evaluated small numbers of participants and were limited in geography [ 14 ] .
the patterns of hhv - 8 shedding , such as duration of shedding episodes , interval between episodes , and variability between persons have not yet been characterized .
due to the heterogeneity of cohort composition , we describe shedding characteristics and patterns across all persons , avoiding prediction of shedding by geographic , demographic or clinical covariates .
we assembled diverse cohorts of hhv - 8 infected individuals to describe patterns of hhv - 8 oral mucosal shedding including rate , quantity , duration , and within - versus between - person variability over time .
results study participants between 1993 and 2011 , 248 subjects met inclusion criteria and contributed 298 sessions ( observation periods ) to the primary analysis , with median duration of 30 days ( range 14 - 136 ) per session [ fig. 1 ] .
these cohorts included persons at high risk for hhv - 8 infection , including heterosexuals from ks - endemic regions , men who have sex with men , and female sex workers .
overall , 152 ( 61 %) participants were men , and the median age was 38 ( interquartile range , iqr : 31 - 45 ) .
one hundred forty - three participants ( 58 %) were hiv - infected , 35 ( 14 %) had ks , and 1 ( 0.4 %) had mcd .
among 143 persons with hiv , cd4 count was < 200 in 9 ( 6 %) , 200 - 499 in 31 ( 22 %) , >= 500 in 17 ( 12 %) and not available in 86 ( 60 %) .
hiv rna was < 104 copies / ml in 23 ( 16 %) , and unmeasured in 70 ( 49 %) .
sixteen ( 44 %) had endemic ks , and 20 ( 56 %) had hiv - associated ks. all participants from peru and cameroon were hiv - infected , while other sites enrolled both hiv - infected and uninfected persons [ table 1 and fig. 2 ]. fig. 1 flow diagram of study participant inclusion .

within the entire cohort , 137 persons ( 55 %) had hhv - 8 dna detected at least once .
the median ( iqr ) shedding rate per session was 7 % ( 0 - 73 %) in the us , 0 % ( 0 - 33 %) in peru , 18 % ( 0 - 56 %) in cameroon , 0 % ( 0 - 34 %) in uganda , 7 % ( 0 - 43 %) in kenya , and 4 % ( 0 - 54 %) overall [ table 1 ] .
among us participants , 33 % of swabs had detectable hhv - 8 dna , 21 % in peru , 31 % in cameroon , 21 % in uganda and 24 % in kenya [ table 1 ] .
in order to validate the utilization of samples from persons with and without hiv and ks , we compared shedding rate within the factorial design of the ugandan cohort as previously described [ 4 ] .
in 34 ugandan persons with ks , the shedding rate was 25 % in hiv - associated cases and 40 % in endemic ks cases ; ugandans without ks had a shedding rate of 27 % .
the ugandan cohort was the only african cohort to include both men and women ; hhv - 8 was detected in 30 % of samples from men , compared with 6 % from women .
amongst all cohorts , hhv - 8 was detected in 18 % of swabs from hiv - infected individuals and 18 % of swabs from hiv - uninfected individuals .
the median quantity of hhv - 8 dna in samples with hhv - 8 detected was 4.7 ( iqr : 3.7 - 5.6 ) log10 copies / ml [ fig. 3 ] .
median hhv - 8 quantity during the session correlated strongly with shedding rate ( rho = 0.72 , p < 0.0001 ) [ fig. 4 ] .
maximum quantity of hhv - 8 detected during a session also correlated highly with the shedding rate ( rho = 0.82 , p < 0.0001 ) ( data not shown ). fig. 3 quantity of hhv - 8 dna ( log10 copies / ml ) within swabs positive for hhv - 8 .
2.17 log10 copies / ml represents the lower limit of accurate detection ( 150 copies / ml ) .
the label for each bin represents a range including the value listed and all values up to but not including the value listed in the next highest bin fig. 4 correlation of hhv - 8 dna quantity and shedding rate : scatterplot of hhv - 8 quantity ( median hhv - 8 dna copy number by qpcr during shedding session ) vs. hhv - 8 shedding rate ( number of days hhv - 8 is detectable at any level by qpcr divided by number of days of shedding session ) .
best - fit regression line is shown ( rho = 0.72 , p < 0.0001 ) shedding episodes we defined a shedding episode as a period of detectable hhv - 8 of at least one day bounded by at least two preceding and subsequent negative swabs , and could include singular missed or negative swabs [ 15 ] .
when initiation or termination of the shedding episode was not observed , interval - censoring survival was used estimate the episode duration .
we dichotomized episodes by median quantity above or below the median quantity of all detectable samples and tested the association between quantity and duration for episodes with log rank tests .
we evaluated up to 3 shedding episodes per session , for a total of 229 episodes in 116 persons .
duration was uncertain in 106 ( 46 %) episodes because of censoring at either limit of session observation .
for 123 episodes of certain duration , the median duration was 1 day ( iqr : 1 - 4 days ) .
using interval censoring survival analysis to include both episodes of certain and uncertain duration , 30 % of episodes were predicted to last less than 1 day , 50 % to last less than 9 days , and 60 % to last less than 20 days .
one hundred - nineteen episodes ( 52 %) with a high median quantity (> 4.5 log10 copies / ml ) had a predicted median duration of 42 days ; for episodes with lower median quantity (<= 4.5 log10 copies / ml ) , the median duration was 3 days ( p < 0.0001 ) .
we investigated the duration of shedding episodes and intervals without hhv - 8 shedding between episodes .
" short " episodes were defined as <= 3 days ( median duration of all episodes ) and " long " episodes as > 3 days .
short episodes were preceded by a median 13 - day interval without shedding whereas long episodes were preceded by a median 7 - day interval ( p = 0.035 ) .
a sensitivity analysis reclassifying episodes censored prior to 3 days ( 26 episodes ) as " short " instead of " long " provided similar estimates .
to illustrate patterns of hhv - 8 shedding , data from participants who collected swabs for 30 - 60 days and who shed at least once were included in a heatmap [ fig. 5 ] .
we did not observe a singular pattern of shedding , but rather a gradation was noted from infrequent and low copy number shedding to very frequent and high copy number shedding .
for example , some participants shed virus in single - day episodes , while others had intermittent episodes of both high and low quantities , and a few participants shed virus at high quantities throughout the session .
participants with ks and hiv were dispersed amongst participants when sorted by shedding rate [ fig. 5 ]. fig. 5 patterns of hhv - 8 shedding .
included participants had hhv - 8 detectable by pcr on at least one day during the first 60 days of observation and were observed for a minimum of 30 days .
each row represents one participant , ordered by shedding rate from lowest to highest over the shedding session .
sixty participants with at least 30 days of observation who never shed were omitted .

asterisks (*) denote participants with kaposi sarcoma and plus signs (+) denote participants with hiv .
white indicates no swab collected ; other colors as per legend variation in shedding rate over time stability of shedding rate over time was evaluated in participants contributing multiple sessions .
thirty - nine participants , all of whom were from the united states , had at least one additional session within two years of the first : 19 persons had 2 , 9 persons had 3 , 8 persons had 4 , and 3 persons had 5 , totaling 112 sessions .
the median shedding rate of first sessions was 50 % .
over time , 4 persons ( 10.3 %) had shedding rate increase by at least 30 % on an absolute scale , 7 persons ( 18.0 %) had shedding rate decrease by the same amount , and 28 ( 71.8 %) had no consistent pattern or a stable shedding rate [ fig. 6 ] .
using variance components , we examined the variation in shedding rates over time within the population that was due to inter - person versus intra - person differences .
we found that 66 % of the variance was due to inter - person differences and the remainder due to change in an individual 's shedding rate over multiple sessions. fig. 6 variation in oral shedding rate of hhv - 8 by participant across multiple shedding sessions .
all cohort participants with 2 - 5 sessions within two years were included in the analysis of shedding variation over time , representing 39 participants with 112 total sessions .
four persons had shedding rates increase by at least 30 % on an absolute scale over time ( red ) , 7 persons had rates decrease by the same amount ( blue ) , and 28 had no consistent pattern ( black ) discussion this is the largest study of hhv - 8 shedding published to date , evaluating more than 10,000 oral swab samples collected from geographically and demographically diverse hhv - 8 seropositive persons not receiving antiviral or antiretroviral therapy .
hhv - 8 shedding was a common event , although nearly half of participants never shed while under observation .
we found a strong correlation between shedding rate , quantity , and duration of oropharyngeal shedding within an individual , but significant variability between individuals .
our findings are consistent with earlier studies of hhv - 8 oropharyngeal shedding that observed 15 % - 32 % shedding rates [ 2 , 16 , 17 ] .
in our large cohort , we observed a gradation in shedding rate and quantity across participants .
in comparison to hsv - 2 , a herpesvirus with well - characterized shedding patterns , we found several differences in mucosal reactivation patterns .
hsv - 2 reactivation is characterized by shorter episodes with 20 % lasting > 9 days [ 18 ] , whereas we found longer episodes of hhv - 8 shedding , with 40 % ongoing at 20 days .
in contrast to hsv - 2 , which has rapid expansion and decay , we observed variable patterns of hhv - 8 shedding , with many episodes showing a long plateau without observed termination .
additionally , quantity of hhv - 8 detected tended to be more homogeneous compared to hsv - 2 , with the vast majority of swabs clustered around 4.5 log copies / ml , whereas hsv - 2 is frequently detected at both lower and much higher quantities [ 18 , 19 ] .
our analysis found similar shedding rates in hiv - infected and uninfected individuals , an intriguing finding that is dissimilar to other herpesviruses , including hsv , cmv , and ebv [ 20 - 24 ] .
hhv - 8 shedding in relationship to ks and hiv has been studied and results are inconsistent .
in uganda , ks patients were more likely to have hhv - 8 detected than those with asymptomatic hhv - 8 infection , while hiv serostatus was not associated with detection of hhv - 8 in the oral mucosa [ 4 ] .
another cross - sectional study found no difference in detection of hhv - 8 shedding in the oral mucosa of hiv - infected men with and without ks [ 25 ] ; persons with ks in our study were not observed prior to onset of disease .
our data do not address the risk of asymptomatically - infected persons developing hhv - 8 - associated diseases , nor compare shedding patterns between persons with hhv - 8 related diseases and asymptomatic infection ; the understanding of viral shedding patterns gained from our work may be used to design longitudinal studies to address questions of hhv - 8 transmission and disease association .
our study was limited by performance characteristics of the hhv - 8 serologic assays used to include and exclude participants , which have sub - optimal sensitivity and specificity [ 26 , 27 ] .
we may have excluded persons from our cohort who were hhv - 8 infected but seronegative , or included those with false positive serology .
using pcr to quantitate oral virus may not strictly detect lytic replicating virus , as latent cell - associated virus may also be present in these samples .
however , that the large majority of samples were negative in hhv - 8 seropositive persons suggests that latent virus in oral epithelial cells is generally not detected by this collection method and pcr technique .
additionally , we were limited in our ability to model demographic and clinical risk factors for hhv - 8 shedding due to both measured and unmeasured cofounders in these heterogeneous cohorts , especially with respect to available hiv clinical data .
conversely , the diversity of participants in this large cohort allowed us to describe hhv - 8 shedding patterns unrestricted to any narrow population or geographic area , as has frequently been done up to this point .
we benefitted from long sessions and serial observations on many participants ; prior studies have not been able to evaluate viral replication patterns in individuals over time .
other strengths of this study include robust methods of swab collection , laboratory , and statistical analysis concordant with methods used by our group in studies of herpesvirus shedding over the last three decades .
while different pcr methods were used in our reference laboratory during the time period over which our cohorts span , the standardization was consistent across all cohorts , was supervised by the same virologist , and quality control showed high correlation between assays .
conclusions we did not detect a consistent or singular pattern to hhv - 8 shedding , and substantial variability was observed between persons .
we demonstrated that rate and quantity of hhv - 8 shedding are highly correlated and that persons experiencing longer and higher quantity shedding episodes can be predicted to shed more frequently in the future .
patterns of hhv - 8 shedding are distinctly different from other well - characterized herpesvirus infections , such as hsv - 2 .
this work provides a foundation to assess mucosal shedding of hhv - 8 as a possible biomarker to assess risk of hhv - 8 transmission or disease .
longitudinal studies in asymptomatically infected persons are needed to further understand clinical correlates to patterns of hhv - 8 shedding , and if replication is associated with hhv - 8 related diseases .
methods we evaluated 22 prospective cohorts in which hhv - 8 dna quantification had been performed on oropharyngeal swabs , including 18 cohorts from the virology research clinic , university of washington [ 14 , 28 - 32 ] , and 4 studies by affiliated investigators in lima , peru [ 33 ] ; kampala , uganda [ 4 ] ; mombasa , kenya [ 34 ] ; and yaounde , cameroon .
the university of washington institutional review board and appropriate partner institutions for international sites approved each study ; all participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
participants collected daily samples of the oropharyngeal mucosa with a dacron swab ( three times weekly in cameroon only ) with similar technique across all studies , for a minimum of 14 days [ 35 ] .
each such observation period is termed a " session " .
we included hhv - 8 seropositive adults ( age >= 18 ) with and without hiv , and with and without hhv - 8 associated diseases including mcd and ks. we included hiv - infected participants only if antiretroviral naive to avoid confounding from immune restoration and potential direct and indirect effects of art on hhv - 8 replication [ 36 ] .
we excluded participants receiving antiviral therapies including valganciclovir , acyclovir , valacyclovir or famciclovir [ 31 ] , and participants with <= 14 samples per session , as prior analyses performed by our group demonstrate substantial instability in herpesvirus shedding estimates with fewer samples [ 37 ] .
data from 216 of 298 hhv - 8 shedding sessions ( 72 %) included in this analysis were previously published [ 1 , 4 , 14 , 16 , 31 , 34 , 38 ] .
we aggregated persons from these diverse populations to more robustly describe associations between shedding rate , quantity , duration , and variability of shedding episodes in hhv - 8 infected persons .
laboratory methods hhv - 8 seropositivity was determined by positive test result on either immunofluorescence assay ( ifa ) against latent or lytic antibodies [ 39 ] or whole - virus enzyme immunoassay ( eia ) [ 27 ] .
swabs were collected into lysis buffer containing 100 mm kcl ( or nacl ) , 25 mm edta ( ph 8.0 ) , 10 mm tris ( ph 8.0 ) , and 1 % igepal ca - 630 and stored at - 20 degreesc until testing , a process validated to be stable for extended storage [ 40 , 41 ] .
quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qpcr ) was performed to quantitate hhv - 8 dna using previously described and validated methods [ 1 , 16 , 38 , 42 ] .
three qpcr assays were used using the study period : the ks330bam233 region of orf26 ( a viral capsid protein ) 1 , orf73 ( latency - associated nuclear antigen - 1 ) 2 or a multiplex assay using orf73 plus t07 - k12 ( kaposin ) 3 .
briefly , early samples ( orf26 assay ) were extracted from swabs with traditional phenol - chloroform method and all other samples were extracted using qiagen column ( qiamap dna blood kit ) , then purified , and amplified with the given primers - probe sets on the taqman qpcr platform ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) .
compared to qpcr with orf73 as the gold standard , orf26 had sensitivity 83.1 % , specificity 98.8 % .
to minimize the variance in sensitivity at low end of detectable range , a cut - off of >= 150 copies / ml (>= 3 copies / pcr reaction ) were considered positive for hhv - 8 detection [ 43 ] .
applying this cut - off , the correlation between orf26 and orf73 results was r2 = 0.75 .
compared to qpcr with orf73 and t07 - k12 multiplex as the gold standard , orf73 had a sensitivity of 94.1 % , specificity of 97.5 % .
applying the minimum cut - off for positivity , the correlation between the latter two primer sets was r2 = 0.96 .
quantitation standard using the cloned pcr product of ks330bam233 primers was consistent throughout all cohorts .
quality control using standardization and positive and negative controls for each batch were supervised by m.l.h. in the same seattle - based reference laboratory for all cohorts .
overall , 92 % of samples were run with the orf73 assay , 5 % with the orf26 assay and 3 % with the orf73 and t07.k12 multiplex assay .
statistical analysis sessions are defined as discrete periods of contiguous swab collection >= 14 days and separated in time from other observation periods .
for participants contributing multiple sessions , the first and second sessions were included in the primary analysis .
for each session , shedding rate was defined as number of swabs with hhv - 8 dna detection , divided by total swabs .
quantity of hhv - 8 was log10 transformed for analysis and was assessed as maximum and median log10 copies / ml. we used pearson correlations to evaluate the association of shedding rate with maximum and median log10 copy number within sessions .
to test the association of episode duration with time between episodes , we classified episodes as " short " or " long " by dichotomizing at the median length of all episodes and used log rank tests .
first , we assumed episodes not observed to terminate were " long " and then then performed a sensitivity analysis reclassifying these episodes as " short " .
we excluded cameroonian samples from episode duration analysis since swabbing was not conducted daily .
participants with two to five sessions were included in the longitudinal shedding analysis .

hexane , ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of onopordum espinae leaves were investigated for their antibacterial activities against bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , enterococcus faecalis , escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and salmonella enteritidis .
hexane and ethyl acetate extracts were toxic to gram - positive bacteria with inhibition zone diameters ranging between 12 and 30 mm. two products , hispidulin 1 , and dehydromelitensin - 8 - ( 4ꞌ - hydroxy - methacrylate ) 2 were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of leaves and identified by 2d - nmr for the first time from this species .
ethyl acetate extractꞌs total flavonoid content was the highest , as 78.73 mg quercetin equivalents ( qe )/ g. the methanol extract showed the highest total phenolic content as 243.43 mg gallic acid equivalents ( gae )/ g and gave the most important 2,2 - diphenyl - 1 - picrylhydrazyl ( dpph ) scavenging activity ( ec50 = 86 microg / ml ) .
key words total flavonoid content total phenolic content dpph radical - scavenging assay hispidulin ; dehydromelitensin - 8 - ( 4ꞌ - hydroxy - methacrylate ) antibacterial activity introduction bacteria continue developing expanding defense against recent antibiotics manufactured lately by pharmaceutical companies .
they become capable of gaining resistance to drugs that are used as curative agents .
this is an interesting matter because of the large number of patients who have lost immunity and as a result of new bacterial strains multidrug - resistant .
therefore , new diseases can appear in hospitals resulting in high fatality .
plants have always been an important source of natural phytochemicals for preserving health of humans , with more concern for natural therapies ( 1 ) .
some species of the genus onopordum were used as antipyretic agents and to treat diabetes , hepatic diseases , gastric disorders and gynecological diseases ( 2 - 4 ) .
others exhibited antimicrobial and antioxidant activities ( 5 , 6 ) .
onopordum espinae bonnet ( asteraceae ) locally known as " bokk " is a cotton thistle endemic to tunisia and libya ( 7 ) .
there are no previous studies on the chemical composition or on the antibacterial activity of this plant .
besides , there is no information about its traditional uses .
thus , this study was carried out with the aim of evaluating the free radical - scavenging properties and the antibacterial activity of this plant , as well as identifying natural chemicals from it. experimental chemicals 2,2 - diphenyl - 1 - picrylhydrazyl ( dpph ) , butyl hydroxy toluene ( bht ) , alpha - tocopherol and gallic acid reagents were purchased from sigma ( germany ) .
aluminum chloride and folin - ciocalteu reagents were purchased from fluka ( germany ) .
sodium carbonate solid was from normapur ( france ) .
all other reagents were of analytical grade .
plant material onopordum espinae was harvested in june 2013 from sfax , tunisia and identified by pr. mohamed chaieb , a botanist at the faculty of sciences of sfax .
the voucher specimen ( lcsn121 ) was deposited at the laboratory of chemistry of natural substances , faculty of sciences , university of sfax , tunisia .
preparation of extracts leaves of onopordum espinae were air dried , powdered using a mechanical grinder and successively macerated using increasing polarity solvents ( hexane , ethyl acetate , and methanol ) during 48 h each .
the extracts were filtered , concentrated using a rotary evaporator and kept at 4 degreesc until use .
isolation and identification of products 1 and 2 by nmr successive purifications of the leaf ethyl acetate extract using silica gel column chromatography were performed using a gradient elution technique and led to the identification of two pure products .

dpph radical - scavenging assay free radical - scavenging activities of hexane , ethyl acetate , and methanol extracts were measured according to literature ( 10 ) .
the dpph free radical - scavenging activity is based on one - electron reduction .
briefly , 1 ml of a dpph solution ( 4 % ( w / v ) in methanol was mixed with 1 ml of the plant material at varying concentrations .
the reaction mixture was well shaken and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature .
a control sample was prepared without any plant material .
the absorbance of the solution was measured at 517 nm against a blank using a spectrophotometer ( jenway 6320 , united kingdom ) .
percentage of dpph scavenged by extracts or pure products at different concentrations was calculated as follows % inhibition = ( ablank - asample / ablank ) x100 where ablank is the absorbance of the dpph control solution and asample is the absorbance of the sample .
the concentration of this latter providing 50 % inhibition ( ic50 ) of dpph was calculated from the graph of percentage inhibition against extract concentration .
alpha - tocopherol and bht were used as reference dpph - scavengers .
total flavonoid content the flavonoid content was determined based on the formation of a flavonoid - aluminum complex ( 11 ) .
1 ml of the sample ( containing 1 mg of each tested extract ) was mixed with 1 ml of a 2 % aluminum chloride methanol solution .
the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 415 nm after incubation for 15 min at room temperature .
quercetin was used as a standard to make the calibration curve .
the amount of flavonoids was expressed as quercetin equivalents ( mg qe / g dry weight of the samples ) .
all the tests were carried out in triplicate .
total phenolic content total phenolic content was determined by using folin - ciocalteu reagent ( 12 ) .
briefly , 0.5 ml of the diluted sample ( 1 mg in 1 ml ) was reacted with 0.5 ml of folin - ciocalteu reagent for 3 min , and then 0.5 ml of a saturated sodium carbonate solution ( 75 g / l ) were added into the reaction mixture .
finally , 3.5 ml of water were added .
the absorbance readings were taken at 725 nm after incubation at room temperature for 90 min .
gallic acid was used as a standard reference and results were expressed as milligram gallic acid equivalents ( mg gae )/ g dry weight of samples .
all the tests were carried out in triplicate .
antibacterial activity bacterial strains extracts were tested against six bacterial strains from american type culture collection ( atcc ) : bacillus cereus atcc 14579 , staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 , enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 , escherichia coli atcc 25922 , pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 , and salmonella enteritidis ( food isolate ) .
bacterial strains were grown on mueller - hinton broth ( bio - rad , france ) at 37 degreesc for 12 - 14 h. the turbidity of the overnight broth was adjusted to 0.5 mcfarland standards ( 1 - 1.5 108 cfu / ml ) by densimat spectrophotometer ( biomerieux , italy ) and then diluted in mueller - hinton broth to a final inoculum concentration of 107 cfu / ml. agar well - diffusion assay antibacterial tests were performed by agar well diffusion method ( 13 ) using sterile mueller - hinton medium ( bio - rad , france ) .
a fresh cell suspension ( 100 microl ) was inoculated onto the surface of agar plates .
thereafter , 6 mm diameter wells were punched in the inoculated agar medium using sterile pasteur pipettes and the extracts were added to each well .
negative controls consisted of 20 % dmso and 50 % ethanol which were used to dissolve the plant extracts .
gentamicin ( 15 microg / well ) was used as a positive control to determine the sensitivity of each bacterial strain .
the plate was allowed to stand for 2 h at 4 degreesc to permit the diffusion of the extracts followed by incubation at 37 degreesc for 24 h. the antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the inhibition zone diameter izd ( clear zone around the well ) against the tested microorganisms .
all tests were repeated three times .
results phenolic and flavonoid contents total phenolic contents of the tested extracts / fraction varied from 30.5 to 243.43 mg of gae / g of sample , using the standard curve of gallic acid ( r2 = 0.9990 ) .
using the standard curve generated by quercetin ( r2 = 0.9999 ) , the total flavonoid contents of extracts / fraction varied from 5.24 to 78.73 mg of qe / g of sample ( table 1 ) .
dpph radical - scavenging activity the results of dpph radical - scavenging activity are also summarized in table 1 .
the ic50 values ranged from 86 to 463 microg / ml. the methanol extract exhibited the highest activity .
antibacterial activity onopordum espinae extracts were tested against both gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria and the data are shown in table 2 .
results are given by means of izds .
the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts showed strong antibacterial activity against gram - positive bacteria with inhibition zones ranging between 12 and 30 mm. the methanol extract was inactive against the tested microorganisms .
the antibacterial activity was observed only against gram - positive bacteria , gram - negative ones were resistant to the tested extracts .
the best activity was exhibited by ethyl acetate extract against staphylococcus aureus , one of the most common gram - positive bacteria causing food poisoning , followed by bacillus cereus .
the isolated compounds hispidulin 1 and dehydromelitensin - 8 - ( 4ꞌ - hydroxy - methacrylate ) 2 were also tested for their antibacterial activities , but none of them showed any antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria within the tested concentration range ( 1 mg / well ) structural identification of compounds 1 and 2 the chemical structures of both isolated compounds were identified according to their 1h and 13c nmr data ( figure 1 ) .
compared to literature ( 8 - 9 ) , they were identified as hispidulin 1 and dehydromelitensin - 8 - ( 4ꞌ - hydroxy - methacrylate ) 2 .

figure 1 compounds 1 and 2 isolated from onopordum espinae leaves discussion pathogenic bacteria continue raising strong resistance and after effects against drugs , mainly antibiotics .
consequently , massive attention has been taken to extracts and biologically active compounds isolated from the vegetable kingdom .
plants can give a new source of antibacterial agents for treatment .
phenolic substances have significant antimicrobial activity and it is estimated that their function in tissues where they accumulate might provide chemical barriers to invading microorganisms ( 14 ) .
a wide variety of antioxidants occurs in plants , with different compositions , physical and chemical properties , mechanisms and sites of action .
several species of the genus onopordum showed antimicrobial and antioxidant activities .
for instance , the antimicrobial activity of onopordum cynarocephalum boiss and blanche ( asteraceae ) polar extracts was discussed ( 5 ) .
the antimycobacterial properties of onopordum anatolicum boiss .
( asteraceae ) were also studied ( 15 ) .
onopordum illyricum l. was reported to contain antioxidant compounds ( 6 ) .
the present work is a continuation of research in this field .
in this paper , the ethyl acetate extract of onopordum espinae was the most active against gram - positive bacteria .
it was even more toxic to bacillus cereus and enterococcus faecalis than gentamicin , a known standard antibiotic .
this significant activity is probably due to the high amount of flavonoids inside ( 78.73 mg qe / g ) , as these latter are known antibacterial agents ( 16 ) .
this extract was subjected to silica gel column chromatography to yield 10 fractions .
the tlc profile of the fourth was the least complex ; it showed two main spots with some minor compounds .
further chromatography of fraction 4 on a silica gel column too yielded 16 sub - fractions among which the sixth and the seventh were pure .
nmr analysis led to identify these products as hispidulin 1 and dehydromelitensin - 8 - ( 4ꞌ - hydroxy - methacrylate ) 2 .
the antibacterial activity is influenced by phenolics and flavonoids composition .
a significant correlation between phenolic composition and antimicrobial activity was reported in several studies .
the phenolic compounds are antibacterial agents such us gallic and ferulic acids ( 17 ) .
in our study , we noticed an antibacterial activity using ethyl acetate as a solvent of extraction , but the methanol extract which contains the highest concentration of phenolics ( 243.43 mg of gae / g ) failed to show any antibacterial activity .
this result demonstrates that the antibacterial activity of onopordum espinae cannot be attributed to phenolic compounds .
on the other hand , flavonoids or other compounds seem to be implicated in antibacterial activity since the ethyl acetate extract contains the highest concentration of flavonoids ( 78.73 mg of qe / g ) compared to the methanol extract .
quercetin , a known flavonoid , is an antibacterial molecule that can inhibit bacteria lipase production and inhibit d - alanine ligase activity which occurs in peptidoglycans production ( 18 ) .
in this study , the antibacterial activity was detected only against gram - positive bacteria , no activity was observed against gram - negative ones .
these differences could be probably due to cell membrane permeability or other genetic factors .
the outer membrane of gram - negative bacteria acts as a barrier to many environmental substances including antibiotics ( 19 ) .
hispidulin is a flavonoid identified for the first time from onopordum espinae , but it was already isolated from onopordum acaulon l. , onopordum ambiguum fresen , onopordum corymbosum willk , onopordum heteracanthum c.a.mey .
( asteraceae ) and others ( 20 ) .
its dpph scavenging activity of 300 microg / ml proves its dpph radical - scavenging effect .
the free radical - scavenging assay of this flavonoid and its antibacterial activity were also described in literature ( 21 ) , but methods used were different .
the antifungal activity of hispidulin against aspergillus tubingensis , botrytis cinerea and penicillium digitatum was also investigated in another report ( 22 ) .
these studies emphasize the efficiency of this flavonoid aglycone against bacteria and fungi as well and assert its antioxidant activity .
other medicinal properties of hispidulin such as antihepatotoxic , analgesic , anti - inflammatory , and tumor inhibiting were also reported ( 23 - 25 ) .
dehydromelitensin - 8 - ( 4ꞌ - hydroxy - methacrylate ) is identified for the first time from this species , but it was previously isolated from onopordum acaulon , onopordum ambiguum , onopordum corymbosum , onopordum cyrenaicum maire & weiller , onopordum laconicum heldr .
& sart .
ex rouy , onopordum leptolepis dc .
( asteraceae ) and others ( 20 ) .
this sesquiterpene lactone was not reported for any biological activity yet .
in this study , it was not capable to scavenge the dpph radical .
the methanol extract was the richest in phenolic compounds ( 243.43 mg of gae / g ) and was the best dpph scavenger ( 86 microg / ml ) .
these data emphasize the role of phenolic compounds as antioxidant agents .
in summary , this study has shown that hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of onopordum espinae are potentially good sources of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such a plant in medicine .
the present study will be essential for selecting plant species for further investigation in the discovery of new natural bioactive substances .
further investigations should focus on the isolation and structure elucidation of antibacterial active constituents from onopordum espinae .

abstract the present study investigates the association of single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) on the chloride channel - 6 ( clc - 6 ) gene with coronary heart disease ( chd ) in china .
we carried out a large case - control study among 1193 chd patients and 1200 unrelated healthy control subjects .
information on the participants' health status was collected through the modified inter - heart questionnaire .
genomic dna from peripheral blood samples was analyzed for the genotypes of rs3737964 and rs3737965 snps on the clc - 6 gene using taqman probe - based quantitative real - time pcr ( qpcr ) .
we compared the collected data between the case group and the control group by chi - square test and t / nonparametric test .
furthermore , we performed logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with chd .
the frequency of tt genotypes in rs3737964 was significantly higher in chd patients compared to the control group , with an odds ratio ( or ) of 2.32 ( 95 % confidence interval , ci : 1.17 - 4.06 , p = 0.016 ) .
the association of chd with tt genotype was even stronger in smoking population after adjusting for confounders ( or = 3.19 , 95 % ci : 1.04 - 9.79 , p = 0.043 ) .
multivariate logistic regression showed the chd risk associated with tt genotype in rs3737964 was particularly among population who were more than 60 years old , smoking , and male ( p = 0.023 , 0.008 and 0.043 , respectively ) .
the present study has revealed that rs3737964 snp of clc - 6 was associated with chd .
in particular , subjects with tt genotype who were 60 - plus years old , with smoking habit or were male were more susceptible to chd .
chloride channel - 6 coronary heart disease genetic variation single - nucleotide polymorphism source - schema - version - number2.0component - idmgg3163cover - datenovember 2015details - of - publishers - convertorconverter : wiley _ ml3gv2 _ to _ nlmpmc version : 4.7.2 mode : remove _ fc converted : 22.12.2015 introduction coronary heart disease ( chd ) is the leading cause of death globally ( neubeck et al. 2009 ) .
it is a multifactorial disease caused by both genetic and environmental factors ( pranavchand and reddy 2013 ) .
environmental factors for chd such as smoking , advanced age , male gender , diabetes mellitus and hypertension have been identified ( agewall 2008 ; pizzi et al. 2008 ; verwoert et al. 2012 ) .
nevertheless , the underlying genetic mechanisms of chd are much less understood and have been largely ignored .
understanding the genetic variation responsible for chd is crucial to identify risk factors , which may enable accurate determination of an individual 's risk of chd .
chloride channels ( clcs ) are widely expressed in the cardiovascular system ( liu et al. 2007 ; duan 2011 ) .
in recent years , many studies have devoted to investigate the relationship between clcs and cardiovascular diseases .
some studies have proven that clcs were involved in many cardiovascular diseases , such as myocardial ischemic , myocardial hypertrophy , myocardial fibrosis and oxidative damage to cardiac myocytes ( heusch et al. 2001 ; duan 2009 , 2011 ) .
clc - 6 gene , located on chromosome 1p36 , was involved in cyclic adenosine monophosphate - dependent protein kinase a signaling pathway and transmembrane transport of small molecules , which are crucial for homeostasis of cardiovascular cells ( barriere et al. 2009 ; adkins and curtis 2015 ) .
polymorphisms of several other genes locating on chromosome 1p36 , such as human b - type natriuretic peptide precursor , natriuretic peptide a and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase , have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of chd .
all the above evidence has triggered studies about single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) on ccl - 6 gene .
to date , few polymorphisms have been identified on ccl - 6 gene , and the association of the rs3737964 and rs3737965 snps with chd is largely unexplored .
here in this study , we carried out a large case - control study in the chinese population to determine whether the two single - nucleotide polymorphisms , snps ( rs3737964 and rs3737965 ) of clc - 6 gene are associated with chd and further confirm the attributable risk genotype of the selected snps by the method of molecular biology and statistical analysis .
materials and methods study population the study population was composed of 1193 chd and 1200 age - and gender - frequency - matched controls .
patients were recruited from three hospitals ( union hospital , tongji hospital and wugang general hospital ) in wuhan , china .
chd was defined according to the world health organization criteria ( world health organization , 1979 ) .
participants were recruited from january , 2002 to december , 2006 .
the questionnaire and methods used in the survey were consistent throughout the 5 - year period .
in this study , patients were considered having chd if coronary angiogram which was performed at time of enrollment showed there was stenosis >= 50 % in one or more of the major segments of coronary arteries for the first time .
a total of 1193 patients diagnosed with chd were recruited in the case group .
we recruited the controls from the local inhabitants .
exclusion criteria of the control group were : having chd , having severe liver or renal diseases , having peripheral vascular diseases and having kinship with a recruited participant .
we screened participants for the above criteria by checking their medical history , and performing clinical examinations and electrocardiography .
people with hypertension , diabetes , and hyperlipidemia are prone to chd .
we defined subjects having hypertension if their systolic blood pressure was >= 140 mmhg or diastolic pressure was >= 90 mmhg or they were treated with hypotensive drugs .
subjects were considered having diabetes if they were on hypoglycemic treatment or met the 1999 world health organization diagnostic criteria ( world health organization , 1979 ) .
hyperlipidemia was defined as blood levels of cholesterol level >= 5.72 mmol / l or triglyceride >= 1.7 mmol / l. chd family history was defined as at least one of the first - degree family members had chd .
those who had on average at least one cigarette per day with a continuous smoking history for more than 1 year were defined as smokers .
body mass index ( bmi ) is a measure of body fat and was calculated as weight in kilograms / height in m2 .
data collection the epidemiological data were collected by the inter - heart questionnaire ( steyn et al. 2005 ) .
demographic characteristics collected were age and gender .
general health - related characteristics collected were disease history of hypertension , diabetes , family history of chd .
we also collected data on smoking and alcohol consumption .
systolic and diastolic blood pressure , weight , height , fasting glucose , cholesterol , and triglycerides were measured among subjects .
age , systolic and systolic blood pressure , weight , height , fasting glucose , cholesterol , and triglycerides were used as continuous variables , all other variables were categorical .
genotyping genomic dna was extracted from venous blood of each subject with puregene kit .
to determine the gene variations in snps rs3737964 and 3737965 , we analyzed the sequence of clc - 6 by taqman probe - based qpcr analysis using the following primers : rs3737964 sense , 5 ' - tcaaataggaaccagccctcaaaaa - 3 ' , and anti - sense , 5 ' - tgtagatcctcacccacatggt - 3 ' , relative probe sequence , vic - ctcacccctgaaagg and fam - tcacccccgaaagg ; rs3737965 sense , 5 ' - tgcgggcccagattgg - 3 ' , and anti - sense , 5 ' - cccgaggagctggtaagaag - 3 ' , relative probe sequence , vic - tctctcagtcccttagca and fam - tctctcagtcctttagca .
pcr was carried out in a 5 mul reaction system in total , including the following : 10 ng dna , 2.5 mul 2 x taqman universal pcr master mix ( no ung ) , 0.125 mul 40 x snp probe / primer mix .
amplification of the target dna was performed with the following condition : 95degreesc for 10 min , followed by 49 cycles of 92degreesc for 15 sec and 60degreesc for 1 min .
negative controls were included in each 384 - well format .
automatic allele calling with the default settings was carried out by abi 7900ht data collection and analyzed by sds software version 2.2.1 ( sds 2.2.1 ) ( zhou et al. 2008 ) .
taqman universal pcr master mix ( no ung ) and snp probe / primer mix were from invitrogen .
statistical analysis spss 10.0 was used to conduct the statistical analysis .
we checked whether the distribution of the polymorphisms was consistent with hardy - weinberg equilibrium by chi - square test .
categorical variables were compared by chi - square test .
continuous variables were compared by independent student 's t - test .
if results from independent student 's t - test showed the patient and control group do not have homogeneity of variance , nonparametric test was used to compare continuous variables .
p < 0.05 was considered significant .
we performed univariate logistic regression analysis of chd and possible risk factors .
the variables attaining p < 0.20 significance in univariate analysis were included in the multivariate regression analysis .
only variables achieving p < 0.05 significance were retained in the final model using backward stepwise elimination .
the degree of association was expressed as odds ratios with 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) .
results general information of the subjects general information of chd patients and controls was shown in table 1 .
no significant difference in age and gender was observed between the chd patients and controls ( p = 0.061 and p = 0.93 ) .
compared with the controls , the chd patients had higher systolic blood pressure and blood sugar , and were more likely to be a smoker .
the chd patients were also more likely to smoke heavily ( p < 0.001 ) .
moreover , the chd patients were more likely to have a history of hypertension and diabetes , and a family history of chd ( p < 0.001 ) .
however , the chd patients presented lower cholesterol .

john wiley & sons , ltd association between the clc - 6 snps and chd chi - square test showed that the distribution of snps rs3737964 and rs3737965 in chloride channel - 6 gene was in hardy - weinberg equilibrium ( chi 2 = 8.86 with p = 0.18 and chi 2 = 0.72 with 0.20 , respectively ) among chd patients and controls .
the frequencies of different genotypes of rs3737964 and rs3737965 in the chd patients and controls were reported in figures 1 , 2 .
for the snp rs3737964 , the tt genotype in the chd patients was significantly elevated compared to that of the controls ( fig. 1 ) .
for the snp rs3737965 , there was no significant difference between the chd patients and the controls .

john wiley & sons , ltd multivariate logistic regression results adjusting for relevant confounders were shown in table 2 .
the significant association between tt genotype and chd was particularly found among subjects who were above 60 years old ( or = 2.06 , 95 % ci : 1.77 - 2.92 , p = 0.023 ) , male ( or = 3.67 , 95 % ci : 1.40 - 9.61 , p = 0.008 ) ; and smokers ( or = 2.06 , 95 % ci : 1.98 - 4.12 , p = 0.043 ) .
discussion our large case - control study provides the first evidence that snp rs3737964 of the chloride channel - 6 is associated with chd .
our results showed that the tt genotype of the snp rs3737964 was associated with having chd .
in logistic regression analysis , the tt genotype was significantly associated with chd after adjusting for other confounders .
stratified analysis showed the significant association between tt genotype and chd was particularly found among subjects who were above 60 years old , male and smokers .
our study confirms previous epidemiological studies which suggest that the chd patients were more likely to be a smoker , have an elevated level of blood pressure , fasting glucose , a history of hypertension , diabetes and a family history of chd ( assmann et al. 1999a,b ) .
the seemingly contrary result in our study that the chd patients were more likely to have a lower level of cholesterol may due to the treatment of lipid - lowering drugs in the chd patients .
as a complex disease , chd is a result of interactions of both environmental risk factors and chd attributable genes .
identifying genetic determinants of chd will provide somewhat accurate determination of an individual 's risk of having chd .
it may also provide opportunities for population - scale screening for chd and new therapeutic targets of drugs ( keavney 2002 ) .
in this study , we first reported that clc - 6 snps as a genetic factor for chd , which might be used to assess an individual 's risk of chd and provide a new genetic target for treatment of chd in the future .
given the conclusion of our large case - control study that snp rs3737964 of ccl - 6 gene is associated with chd , we propose that rs3737964 might be relevant with the severity of chd and thus indicate the prognosis of chd patients .
however , since our questionnaire did not include the assessment of severity of chd , the role of re3737964 in prediction of prognosis of chd needs further exploration in the future .
moreover , we can screen tt genotype among people who are above 60 years old , male and smokers for chd at population level to reduce the prevalence of chd .
chloride channel is widely expressed among cardiovascular system , including atrial cells , sinus node cells , purkinje fibers and cardiomyocytes ( kenyon and gibbons 1979 ; cheng et al. 2007 ; huang et al. 2009 ; wojciak - stothard et al. 2014 ) .
studies reported it participates in many functional processes of cardiovascular system , including resting potential , action potential , adjusting of membrane excitability , cell permeability and volume of cells ( kunzelmann et al. 1991 ; funabashi et al. 2010 ; fahlke 2011 ; zhu et al. 2013 ) .
these reports all suggest an important role of clcs in normal function of cardiovascular system , which in part support our finding that snps in clc - 6 is related to chd .
at present , we have little knowledge of chloride channel - 6 .
kornak et al. , found that exons of chloride channel - 6 genes are very conservative among species ( kornak et al. 1999 ) .
previous studies have shown that introns of clc - 6 play an important role in clc - 6 gene expression and relevant physiological processes ( eggermont 1998 ; kornak et al. 1999 ) .
in our study , the two snps rs3737964 and rs3737965 were both sited in the intron of clc - 6 gene , which suggests that clc - 6 contributes to the etiology of chd .
we recommend future studies to take clc - 6 genes into account when investigating genetic factors of chd .
as genetic variants can be influenced by many factors , such as location , time , and nations ( in , 2006 ) .
more studies need to be performed to further understand the function of snps in clc - 6 in chd patients among different populations , races and countries to get a comprehensive picture of the role of snps in chd .
in summary , our study , to our knowledge , the first time reveals an association between snp rs3737964 of the chloride channel - 6 and chd .
our results provide a novel factor that can be used to determine an individual 's risk of chd , screen population at large and provide new therapeutic targets of drugs .

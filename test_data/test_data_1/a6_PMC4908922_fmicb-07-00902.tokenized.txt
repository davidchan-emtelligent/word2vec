coastal ecosystems are considered buffer zones for the discharge of land - derived nutrients without accounting for potential negative side effects .
hence , there is an urgent need to better understand the ecological assembly and dynamics of the microorganisms that are involved in nitrogen ( n ) cycling in such systems .
here , we employed two complementary methodological approaches ( i.e. , shotgun metagenomics and quantitative pcr ) to examine the distribution and abundance of selected microbial genes involved in n transformations .
we used soil samples collected along a well - established pristine salt marsh soil chronosequence that spans over a century of ecosystem development at the island of schiermonnikoog , the netherlands .
across the examined soil successional stages , the structure of the populations of genes involved in n cycling processes was strongly related to ( shifts in the ) soil nitrogen levels ( i.e. , no3 - , nh4 +) , salinity and ph ( explaining 73.8 % of the total variation , r2 = 0.71 ) .
quantification of the genes used as proxies for n fixation , nitrification and denitrification revealed clear successional signatures that corroborated the taxonomic assignments obtained by metagenomics .
notably , we found strong evidence for niche partitioning , as revealed by the abundance and distribution of marker genes for nitrification ( ammonia - oxidizing bacteria and archaea ) and denitrification ( nitrite reductase nirk , nirs and nitrous oxide reductase nosz clades i and ii ) .
this was supported by a distinct correlation between these genes and soil physico - chemical properties , such as soil physical structure , ph , salinity , organic matter , total n , no3 - , nh4 + and so42 - , across four seasonal samplings .
overall , this study sheds light on the successional trajectories of microbial n cycle genes along a naturally developing salt marsh ecosystem .
the data obtained serve as a foundation to guide the formulation of ecological models that aim to effectively monitor and manage pristine and impacted salt marsh areas .
such models should account for the ecology as well as the historical contingency of n cycling communities .
microbial succession functional diversity soil chronosequence ecosystem functioning metagenomics qpcr nederlandse organisatie voor wetenschappelijk onderzoek10.13039 / 501100003246gratama stichting10.13039 / 501100007442 introduction salt marshes rank among the most productive and valuable ecosystems in the world ( deegan et al. , 2012 ; bowen et al. , 2013 ) , yet they are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change and direct anthropogenic disturbances ( gedan et al. , 2009 ) .
it is recognized that salt marshes have a major role in protecting coastal areas , for instance by removing land - derived compounds ( valiela and cole , 2002 ; sousa et al. , 2008 ). of particular importance , the runoff and groundwater discharges of agricultural fertilizers largely contribute to the influx of nutrients into these systems .
in the case of nitrogen ( n ) , these are either incorporated into plant biomass or removed by the local microbiota via nitrification and denitrification ( verhoeven et al. , 2006 ) .
however , recent studies have indicated that such influxes of n forms can overwhelm the capacity of salt marshes to effectively remove n without deleterious effects to the ecosystem ( turner et al. , 2009 ; deegan et al. , 2012 ) .
this occurs due to the increase in plant aboveground biomass that reduces the bank - stabilization of the roots .
as a result , there is a progressive reduction of the geomorphic stability of the system , which leads to creek - bank collapse and salt marsh loss ( deegan et al. , 2012 ) .
in spite of their relevance , the current knowledge regarding the distribution of genes that govern nitrogen cycling in salt marshes and the effects of nitrogen input is still limited ( hamersley and howes , 2005 ; koop - jakobsen and giblin , 2010 ; vieillard and fulweiler , 2012 ; kinney and valiela , 2013 ) .
for instance , whereas the ammonia - oxidizing bacteria ( aob ) were found to respond to n fertilization , ammonia - oxidizing archaea ( aoa ) remained unaffected ( peng et al. , 2013 ) .
moreover , no significant effect was found on the nitrogen - fixing and denitrifying bacterial communities when exposed to added n ( piceno and lovell , 2000 ; lovell et al. , 2001 ; bowen et al. , 2011 ). of particular importance , and lacking in these studies , is a thorough understanding of the distribution and drivers of n cycling communities in a naturally developing salt marsh ecosystem .
obtaining and inferring the genetic potential of these communities in such a system is critical , as it provides a baseline against which one can weigh the impact of n input with respect to community assemblage .
such a baseline will enhance our ability to manage the impacted areas at a landscape level .
a promising approach to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of n cycling communities relies on the use of chronosequences of soil formation .
these model systems enable to study the dynamics of ecosystem development across multiple time scales ( walker et al. , 2010 ) , offering a setting to contrast and compare the patterns of community assembly across different successional stages .
however , the study of spatiotemporal patterns of microbial communities in chronosequences is relatively recent , and it is under debate with respect to the drivers of community assembly and how these ultimately influence microbially - driven processes ( sigler and zeyer , 2002 ; nemergut et al. , 2007 ; brankatschk et al. , 2011 ) .
as outlined by several authors , microbial communities exhibit successional trajectories that are tractable .
in particular , recent studies have successfully disentangled the interplay between abiotic variables ( edaphic factors ) and the ecological mechanisms structuring the microbial communities across natural and disturbed soil chronosequences ( ferrenberg et al. , 2013 ; dini - andreote et al. , 2015 ) .
in the present study , we investigated the n cycling microbial communities along a well - established chronosequence of soil formation .
we specifically focused on the distributions and identities of organisms that are predicted to be involved in selected steps of the n cycle .
a suite of complementary approaches was used to determine how the structure and functional capabilities of the target soil microbial communities shift over more than a century of natural ecosystem development .
we thus analyzed soil sampled from five successional stages along replicated plots , representing distinctly vegetated sites under different abiotic conditions ( i.e. , tidal regime , salinity , ph and soil nutrients ) ( see supplementary figure 1 and supplementary table 1 ) .
the functional potentials of the communities were characterized by shotgun metagenomic profiling , whereas seasonal variations of specific n cycling genes were measured using quantitative pcr assays .
we quantified the genes encoding ( 1 ) subunits of enzymes involved in n fixation ( nitrogenase reductase , nifh ) , ( 2 ) nitrification ( ammonia monooxygenase , amoa , of both aob and aoa ) and ( 3 ) denitrification ( nitrite reductase nirs and nirk and nitrous oxide reductase nosz from clades i and ii ) .
the whole dataset was used to test the overarching hypothesis that the genes involved in the different n transformations change not only in abundance but also with respect to the identity of the taxonomic groups along the ecological succession .
we also examined whether the shifts are related to important abiotic variables , such as primary net productivity ( brankatschk et al. , 2011 ) and soil nutrient status , i.e. , levels of carbon ( liu and greaver , 2010 ) and nitrogen ( lebauer and treseder , 2008 ) .
materials and methods sampling location and data collection soil samples were collected along a well - established salt marsh chronosequence located at the island of schiermonnikoog ( n53degrees30 '' e6degrees10 '') , the netherlands ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
this chronosequence is formed through the constant deposition of silt and clay particles ( carried by sea currents and winds directed west - to - east ) that accumulate on top of the underlying sandflats , causing the island to progressive extend eastwards ( olff et al. , 1997 ; schrama et al. , 2012 ) .
salt marsh age at each stage of the succession was estimated from topographic maps , aerial photographs and the thickness of the sediment layer accumulating on top of the underlying sand layer .
in addition , permanent plots have monitored the space - for - time replacement in this system for more than 20 years ( van wijnen et al. , 1997 ) .
for this study , five different soil successional stages were identified and estimated as 0 , 5 , 35 , 65 and 105 years of soil development in 2012 ( the sampling year ) ( referred in the main text and figures as " stages 0 , 5 , 35 , 65 , 105 ") .
soil samples were collected in may , july , september and november 2012 .
triplicate plots ( 5 x 5 m2 ) were established at each identified soil successional stage ( separated 25 m from each other ) at the same base of elevation - - position at the initial elevation gradient on the bare sand flats with a base elevation of 1.16 m +/ - 2.2 cm ( mean +/ - se ) above dutch ordinance level .
importantly , differences in the base elevation reflect differences in inundation regimes , therefore having strong influences on the dynamics and the fate of succession ( olff et al. , 1997 ) .
soil samples were collected in each plot by randomly taking 20 soil cores ( 5 cm diameter , 10 cm depth ) , using aseptic techniques , to represent a composite sample .
samples were placed in a sterile plastic bag , sealed and transported to the laboratory (< 24 h ) .
all samples were sieved ( 4 mm mesh size ) under sterile conditions and stored at - 20degreesc for total dna extraction and at 4degreesc for physico - chemical measurements .
for each sample , we quantified the soil physical structure ( silt : clay : sand %) and chemical content of total organic matter ( som ) , nitrate ( n - no3 - ) , ammonium ( n - nh4 +) , sulfate ( s - so42 - ) , sodium ( na ) and ph. for detailed information on the soil physico - chemical analyses see dini - andreote et al .
( 2014 ) .
for soil physico - chemical properties see supplementary table 1 .
total soil dna was extracted from 0.5 g of soil using the mobio powersoil dna isolation kit ( mobio laboratories , carlsbad , ca , usa ) .
extracted dna samples were quantified using the quant - it picogreen dsdna assay kit ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) on a tecan infinite m200 pro ( maennedorf , switzerland ) plate reader reading at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission .
all samples were standardized at equal concentrations for further analysis .
shotgun metagenomics shotgun metagenomic sequencing was conducted following the procedure described in the illumina trueseq dna sample preparation protocol .
the triplicated samples for each successional stage collected in july 2012 were subjected to shotgun metagenomic profiling ( n = 15 ) .
seasonal variations in the abundance of marker genes were later interrogated by primer - specific quantitative pcr assays ( see below ) .
in brief , aliquots of each dna sample were mechanically sheared before entering the illumina library generation protocol .
libraries were size - selected to 170 - 180 bp using an agarose gel .
sequencing was carried out in a paired - end ( 2 x 100 bp ) illumina hiseq2000 run at the argonne national laboratory in the next generation sequencing core ( ngs ) .
raw , unassembled illumina reads were paired , dereplicated and quality filtered in mg - rast ( meyer et al. , 2008 ) .
putative open reading frames on the quality - controlled sequences were called using fraggenescan ( rho et al. , 2010 ) .
metagenomes were functionally annotated using blastx searches against the kegg ( kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes ) orthology ( ko ) identifiers ( kanehisa et al. , 2008 ) .
for the taxonomic assignments of selected kos , sequences of specific kos were retrieved and annotated against the m5nr ( an md5 nonredundant database ) ( wilke et al. , 2012 ) using the best - hit organismal classification method .
functional and taxonomic annotations of sequences were carried out with a maximum e - value cutoff of 10 - 5 , a minimum percent identity cutoff of 60 % and a minimum alignment length cutoff of 15 .
all sequence data have been deposited in the mg - rast database .
the reference ids of the metagenomes are provided in supplementary table 2 .
quantitative pcr analysis functional marker genes encoding subunits of enzymes involved in n fixation ( nifh ) , nitrification [ amoa of ammonia - oxidizing bacteria ( aob ) and archaea ( aoa )] and denitrification ( nirs , nirk and nosz clades i and ii ) , in addition to the phylogenetic marker 16s rrna gene for bacteria and archaea , were quantified using quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) assays run on a abi prism 7300 cycler ( applied biosystems ) .
for the qpcr assays , all collected samples were considered , including seasonal time points ( may , july , september and november ) ( n = 60 ) .
we applied sybr green - based quantification assays using the power sybr green pcr master mix ( applied biosystems , frankfurt , germany ) .
reaction volumes were 25 mul containing one - fold pcr master mix .
pcr conditions , efficiencies , primers and calibration standards used are shown in table 1 .
the specificity of the amplification products was confirmed by melting curve analyses , and the expected sizes of the amplified fragments were checked in a 1.5 % agarose gel .
two independent quantitative pcr assays were performed for each gene and four no - template controls were run for each qpcr assay , which resulted in null or negligible values .
standard curves were generated over five orders of magnitude , i.e. from 103 to 108 copies of template , using a plasmid containing specific marker genes ( table 1 ) .
the qpcr efficiency ( e ) was calculated according to the equation e = [ 10 ( - 1 / slope ) - 1 ] .
possible inhibitory effects were checked by spiking samples with a range of known concentrations of the plasmid .
no apparent inhibition was observed for any of the quantified genes .
data were first calculated as log copy numbers per gram of dry - weight soil ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
since the sizes of the bacterial and archaeal communities change significantly over the successional gradient ( see supplementary figure 2 ) , our data are shown as the ratio between the abundance of each n cycling gene and its respective organismal abundance ( either bacteria or archaea ) , as a percentage .

statistical analyses cross - soil comparisons were made using bray - curtis similarities calculated based on normalized and square - root transformed count matrices of unique kos .
as the size of the metagenomic libraries varied stochastically by soil sample ( supplementary table 2 ) , raw counts were normalized to metagenomic library size to account for inconsistent sample depth .
this facilitated comparison between soils prior to bray - curtis calculations .
principal coordinate analyses ( pco ) and permanova ( anderson , 2001 ) were performed using the homonymous routines in primer6 + ( clarke and gorley , 2006 ) for the complete functional community profiling data ( ko annotations ) and a selection of kos specifically involved in n cycle transformations ( i.e. , nitrogen metabolism [ path : ko00910 ]) .
significance levels calculated in permanova were determined with 103 permutations .
all measured soil physico - chemical properties were checked for normality using the shapiro - wilk test and further log ( x + 1 ) transformed - - with the exception of ph - - to improve normality and homoscedasticity for multivariate statistical analyses .
the correlation strength and significance between the structure of the n cycling communities and the soil metadata were determined using relate ( a nonparametric mantel type test ) , run with 103 permutations .
we further used a nonparametric multivariate regression between normalized soil physico - chemical parameters and the bray - curtis similarity matrix of n cycling communities implemented as distance - based linear modeling ( distlm ) ( mcardle and anderson , 2001 ) , run with 103 permutations .
the model was built using a step - wise selection procedure and the adjusted r2 selection criterion .
we further used best to select for the best combination of less - colinear factors - - previously selected by marginal distlm - - to be incorporated in the models using the " forward " procedure within distlm .
the selected soil parameters were subsequently used to build a constrained ordination plot using the best - fitted model in a distance - based redundancy analysis ( dbrda ) ( legendre and anderson , 1999 ) .
these analyses were conducted using primer6 and permanova + ( primere ltd , ivybridge , uk ) .
for this study , the functional metagenomic analyses focused on the genetic potential of communities involved in n transformations .
marker genes ( kos ) were selected as previously reported ( lauro et al. , 2011 ; llorens - mares et al. , 2015 ) ( see supplementary table 3 and figure 2 , for a full description ) .
predicted kos that segregated significantly between successional stages were identified using random forest analysis ( breiman , 2001 ) with 1,000 trees followed by the boruta algorithm for feature selection ( average z - scores of 1,000 runs > 4 ) ( kursa and rudnicki , 2010 ) .
these analyses were carried out in r using the packages randomforest v4.6 - 7 and boruta v3.0 .
heatmaps were constructed based on z - score transformed functional annotations to improve normality and homogeneity of the variances .
the genetic potentials to perform specific steps in the n biogeochemical cycle of the salt marsh soils were assessed using the combination of these selected marker genes ( lauro et al. , 2011 ; llorens - mares et al. , 2015 ) , where each gene combination is averaged ( multiple enzymes / subunits in the same conversion step ) or summed ( multiple pathways performing the same conversion step ) .
for a detailed list of selected kos involved in each step of the n cycle , see supplementary table 3 .
results structure of n cycling communities in a developing salt marsh chronosequence we analyzed the shotgun metagenomic data from the soil samples taken from triplicate plots along five successional stages ( sampling time : july ; n = 15 ) in the schiermonnikoog chronosequence .
the sequenced soil metagenomes averaged 1.9 +/ - 0.7 ( mean +/ - sd ) gigabases , with average read lengths of 165 bp. of the total read counts in each metagenome , 12.6 +/ - 0.9 % could be assigned to kos and thus to specific functions ( e - value 10 - 5 ) ( see supplementary table 2 for details ) .
principal coordinate analysis ( pco ) of the annotated kos revealed a clear separation of functional community structures when compared across different soil successional stages ( figure 1a ) ( permanova , pseudo - f = 6.77 , p < 0.001 ; for pairwise permanovas between consecutive soil stages , see supplementary table 4 ). from the annotated kos , we then selected a set of marker genes that report on specific n cycle transformations ( i.e. , nitrogen metabolism [ path : ko00910 ]) .
differences in functional community structures occurred in a similar manner when only the kos involved in n cycling were considered ( figure 1b ) ( permanova , pseudo - f = 7.79 , p < 0.001 ; see also supplementary table 4 ) .

( c ) distance - based redundancy analysis ( dbrda ) illustrating the " best " fitting distlm model ( adjusted r2 = 0.71 ) containing forward selected predictor variables .
axis legends include % of variation explained by the fitted model and % of total variation explained by the axis .
the investigated soil successional stages had distinct edaphic properties , as previously described in detail ( dini - andreote et al. , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ; see supplementary table 4 ) .
we thus examined a possible coupling of the n cycling data with the soil metadata .
first , the functional community structures were weakly but significantly correlated with soil physico - chemical properties ( relate rho = 0.249 , p = 0.013 ) .
analyses of the individual soil parameters by marginal distlm resulted in the assertion that ( levels of ) sodium ( pseudo - f = 3.66 , proportion = 0.22 ) , nitrate ( pseudo - f = 2.37 , proportion = 0.15 ) , ammonium ( pseudo - f = 2.31 , proportion = 0.15 ) , ph ( pseudo - f = 1.95 , proportion = 0.13 ) and sand content ( pseudo - f = 1.58 , proportion = 0.10 ) were the best predictors of the structures of the n cycling communities .
collectively , these selected parameters correlated marginally with the n cycling community structures ( best rho = 0.262 , p = 0.049 ) .
the best - fitted distlm model , using the " forward " procedure of selected predictor variables , as shown by dbrda , explained 73.8 % of the total variation with an adjusted r2 of 0.71 ( figure 1c ) .
genetic potentials and taxonomic assignment of n cycling communities in salt marsh soils we used the relative abundances of selected marker genes obtained by metagenomics as proxies for their potential relevance ( i.e. , genetic potential ) in different steps of the n cycle .
we start by depicting the normalized relative abundance of selected marker genes involved in n transformations across the different successional stages .
the data showed that genes related to n assimilation and mineralization encompassed the major proportion of genes present across all successional stages ( 61.8 +/ - 3.4 % and 22.3 +/ - 1.3 % , respectively ) ( supplementary table 5 , figure 2a ) .
three genes encoding glutamate dehydrogenase ( involved in n mineralization ; k00260 , k00261 , k00262 ) were found to have a differential distribution along the succession ( boruta feature selection average z - score of 1,000 runs > 4 ) .
the taxa involved in n mineralization were affiliated with heterotrophic free - living organisms at early successional stages , mainly actinomycetales ( 7.8 %) and burkholderiales ( 7.6 %) , whereas at stage 105 the actinomycetales ( 10.6 %) were followed by rhizobiales ( 7.9 %) , encompassing the genera bradyrhizobium , methylobacterium , rhizobium and xanthobacter .
here , burkholderiales encompassed only 4.5 % of the total gene sequences .
next , the potential for nitrogen fixation ( nif genes ) was observed in all soil sites , significantly segregating across these and peaking at stage 35 ( 2.4 %) followed by the late successional sites ( stages 65 and 105 , 1.4 and 0.6 % , respectively ) .
the taxonomic assignment of the nif genes was partitioned mostly among desulfuromonadales ( 23.5 %) and desulfovibrionales ( 21.3 %) at the initial soil stage .
however , as succession proceeds , the relative contribution of n - fixing desulfuromonadales increased , reaching 31.8 % at stage 35 and peaking at the soil stages 65 and 105 ( 43.9 and 42.1 % , respectively ) .
genes involved in nitrification were present at low abundances in all soil sites ( 0.18 + 0.07 %) , followed by ammonification ( 0.7 + 0.19 %) .
the levels of the latter genes peaked at stage 0 ( 1.02 %) , with the underlying taxa being mostly affiliated to the orders myxococcales ( 29.4 %) ( genera anaeromyxobacter , myxococcus , sorangium ) and desulfuromonadales ( 16.9 %) ( genera geobacter and pelobacter ) .
genes involved in denitrification ( 5.2 + 0.8 %) were found across all successional stages .
they peaked in intermediate site ( stage 35 ) at 6.22 % , which was followed by stage 0 at 5.8 % and stage 105 at 5.0 % .
the main denitrifying taxa were flavobacteriales ( 17.2 %) and cytophagales ( 7.4 %) at stage 0 .
at stage 35 , flavobacteriales ( 15.6 %) , bacteroidetes order ii incertae sedis belonging to the family rhodothermaceae ( genera rhodothermus and salinibacter ) ( 5.5 %) were prominent , whereas flavobacteriales ( 19.8 %) and rhizobiales ( 5.5 %) prevailed at stage 105 .
we also found significant differences in the distribution and abundances of genes encoding enzymes involved in nitrate reduction ( napa , periplasmic nitrate reductase ; napb , cytochrome c - type protein ) .
these genes peaked at stage 35 ( 4.4 %) , with the underlying taxa being mostly affiliated to alteromonadales ( 10.9 %) , burkholderiales ( 8.1 %) , campylobacterales ( 9.2 %) and puniceicoccales ( 7.7 %) .
we further examined the genetic potential of genes involved in n cycle transformations in salt marsh soils using a previously described approach ( for details see lauro et al. , 2011 ; llorens - mares et al. , 2015 ; supplementary table 3 and figure 2b ) .

differences across successional stages of each step are shown by z - score heatmap lines indicated in each n transformation .
quantitative assessment and seasonal variation of n cycling gene abundances quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) was used to examine the abundances of nitrogen fixers ( nifh ) , ammonia - oxidizing bacteria ( aob - amoa ) , ammonia - oxidizing archaea ( aoa - amoa ) and denitrifiers ( nirk , nirs and nosz clades i and ii ) .
in order to address potential within - stage seasonal variations in the n cycling marker gene abundances , quantifications were performed in soil samples collected at five successional stages ( triplicate plots per stage ) along the soil chronosequence , at four sampling times ( samples collected in may , july , september and november 2012 ) ( n = 60 ) .
importantly , the population sizes of bacteria and archaea ( as estimated by the copy numbers of 16s rrna genes ) varied over 10 - to 100 - fold across all stages of the chronosequence and seasonal variations were observed in some cases ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
given such variation , our data are shown as the ratio between the abundance of each n cycling gene and its respective organismal abundance ( either bacteria or archaea ) , in percentage ( termed " relative abundance ") ( figure 3 ) .
for absolute quantifications of each individual gene , shown as log copy numbers per gram of dry - weight soil , see supplementary figure 2 .

bars represent average values +/ - standard error ( se ) ( n = 3 ) and letters above each bar describe seasonal variations within each stage of succession ( anova with tukey 's post - hoc test , p < 0.05 ) .
nitrogen fixation ( bacterial nifh gene ) the relative abundance of the nifh gene peaked at the intermediate site ( stage 35 , seasonal variation 51 +/ - 18 % , average +/ - sd ) , followed by stage 65 ( 23 +/ - 9 %) , being lowest at stages 5 ( 5 +/ - 3 %) and 105 ( 4 - 6 %) and slightly higher at stage 0 ( 16 +/ - 13 %) .
interestingly , these results corroborate the quantifications of this gene obtained by comparative metagenomics ( see figure 2 ) .
seasonal variations in the n fixer population sizes were observed for stages 0 , 35 and 105 ( anova with tukey 's post - hoc test , p < 0.05 ) ( see figure 3 for details ) .
we also found the relative abundance of the nifh gene to weakly but significantly correlate ( rho = 0.27 , p < 0.05 ) with variations in sodium concentration across the samples ( figure 4 ) .

* p < 0.05 and ** p < 0.01 .
ammonia oxidation ( bacterial aob - amoa and archaeal aoa - amoa ) the abundance of the ammonia monooxygenase gene was quantified for both aob and aoa .
independent of the stage of succession , the abundance of aob was always higher than that of aoa ( aob : aoa ratios of > 1 ) .
moreover , the abundance of total bacteria was higher than that of archaea by ca .
1,000 - fold ( supplementary figure 2 ) .
normalization of amoa gene numbers as relative abundance in the respective organismal groups indicated that the aob accounted for a small proportion of the total bacterial communities ( ca .
0.5 - 1.5 %) , being higher at stage 35 and displaying seasonal variations at stage 5 ( figure 3b ) .
conversely , the relative abundance of the amoa gene in the archaeal communities ranged from ca .
16 to 77 % , displaying a slightly opposite pattern , i.e. , being proportionally lowered at the intermediate stage ( stage 35 ) and displaying only significant seasonal variations at the initial soil site ( stage 0 ) ( figure 3b ) .
these differences were also evidenced by the distinct correlations of the patterns with the soil metadata .
whereas aob correlated with the soil chemical parameters ( i.e. , sulfate , sodium , total n , nh4 + and no3 - contents ; rho - values ranging from 0.22 to 0.34 , p < 0.05 ) , aoa correlated with soil physical structure ( i.e. , silt and clay content , rho - values ca .
0.33 , p < 0.01 ; sand content , rho = - 0.32 , p < 0.01 ) .
for the latter , only marginal correlations were found with som ( rho = 0.22 , p < 0.05 ) , sulfate concentrations ( rho = 0.28 , p < 0.05 ) and soil ph ( rho = - 0.3 , p < 0.05 ) ( figure 4 ) .
denitrification ( bacterial nirs , nirk and nosz clade i and clade ii ) to quantify denitrifying bacteria , genes encoding nitrite reductase ( nirk and nirs ) and nitrous oxide reductase ( nosz clade i and ii ) were used .
the relative abundances of the nirk and nirs genes were clearly influenced by the conditions prevailing at the local sites .
this was evidenced by the opposing relation of their respective distributions with the soil metadata .
in brief , whereas nirk was positively and significantly correlated with parameters prevailing at initial soil stages ( higher ph and sand content ) ( rho = 0.70 and 0.69 , respectively ; p < 0.01 ) , nirs correlated with conditions prevailing at late successional stages ( higher nutrient contents - - som , total n , nh4 + and no3 - - - so42 - and sodium concentrations , and silt and clay contents ) ( rho - values ranging from 0.32 to 0.55 , p < 0.01 ) ( figure 4 ) .
the relative abundances of these genes also revealed opposite trends along the successional gradient : nirk peaked at the initial soil sites , ranging from ca .
0.21 +/ - 0.14 to 0.42 +/ - 0.16 % ( average +/ - sd ) at stages 0 and 5 , respectively ; whereas nirs was highest at the intermediate and late sites , ranging from ca .
0.58 +/ - 0.28 to 1.06 +/ - 0.6 % at stage 105 and 65 , respectively ( figure 3 ) .
for the seasonal within - stage variations of these genes , see figure 3 .
we also quantified the abundance of the nitrous oxide reductase gene ( nosz ) , which has been recently shown to occur across two distinct phylogenetic clades ( see discussion for details ) .
across all successional stages , we found nosz clade i to occur at ca .
10 - fold higher abundances than clade ii ( figure 3c ) .
the relative abundances of these clades did not display a clear inversely distributed pattern along the chronosequence .
however , they clearly correlated with different soil parameters .
for instance , whereas nosz clade i correlated with ( shifts in ) soil chemical properties ( i.e. , sodium , som , sulfate and n - - total , nitrate and ammonium ) ( rho - values ranging from 0.32 to 0.4 , p < 0.01 ) ( ph , rho = - 0.35 , p < 0.01 ) , nosz clade ii correlated only with variations in soil physical structure : sand ( rho = 0.32 , p < 0.01 ) , silt ( rho = - 0.32 , p < 0.01 ) and clay ( rho = - 0.33 , p < 0.01 ) .
both nosz clades also displayed different within - stage seasonal variations along the chronosequence , providing additional support for their niche partitioning ( figure 3c ) .
discussion the increasing discharges of agricultural fertilizers into coastal ecosystems have been shown to cause a progressive transition of creek - edge and bay - edge marshes into mudflats and wider creeks worldwide ( macgarvin , 2001 ; tiner et al. , 2006 ; deegan et al. , 2012 ) .
thus , to prevent such ecological distress , it is crucial to examine the capacity of salt marshes to cycle n and to deal with exogenous n influxes ( e.g. , lovell et al. , 2001 ; bowen et al. , 2011 ; peng et al. , 2013 ) .
in spite of the urgency , the current knowledge of how microbial n cycling populations are ecologically assembled in salt marshes is still rudimentary .
here , we examined the successional signatures of microbial n - cycling genes across a naturally developing salt marsh chronosequence .
previous studies have made use of these soil sites to examine the patterns and mechanisms driving bacterial and fungal community assembly and dynamics at the phylogenetic level ( see dini - andreote et al. , 2014 , 2015 , 2016 ) .
in order to build on this knowledge , we here examined the distribution of genes predicted to encode nitrogen cycling enzymes in this system .
our results highlight whether or not the observed shifts relate to important abiotic variables .
last , we provided evidence that metabolically redundant genes involved in the nitrification and denitrification pathways are niche partitioned .
nitrogen input at the initial stages of the soil chronosequence emerging terrestrial systems are often characterized by low nutrient content and scarce vegetation ( sigler and zeyer , 2002 ; brankatschk et al. , 2011 ) .
in the schiermonnikoog chronosequence , the initial soil sites ( stages 0 and 5 ) had less than 20 % vegetation cover , whereas the intermediate ( stage 35 ) and late sites ( stages 65 and 105 ) were densely vegetated ( schrama et al. , 2012 ) .
thus , the initial input of organic materials by root exudates and plant litter was presumably low .
hence , n fixation , as well as autotrophic co2 incorporation , at early successional sites might be critical for primary production ( kohls et al. , 1994 ) .
interestingly , using metagenomics and direct qpcr , our data revealed a low genetic potential for n fixation and low nifh gene copy numbers at stages 0 and 5 ( figures 2b , 3a ) .
this finding corroborates those of brankatschk et al .
( 2011 ) and nemergut et al .
( 2007 ) , who also found that the lowest n fixation rates occurred in the bulk soil of the initial , rather than later , stages of soil development at the forefields of the damma glacier in switzerland and the puca glacier in peru .
moreover , we did not find a systematic shift in the taxonomic distribution of organisms holding n fixation genes .
for instance , there was a clear ( relative ) dominance of anaerobic sulfate reducers as n fixers throughout the current study , as organisms belonging to the desulfuromonadales increased progressively along the successional gradient ( see results for details ) .
in addition , whereas free - living autotrophic n - fixers such as cyanobacteria were expected to abound in the early stages ( bolhuis and stal , 2011 ; fan et al. , 2015 ) , anaerobic n fixers , specifically belonging to the desulfuromonadales and desulfovibrionales , prevailed .
this finding potentially relates to our sampling strategy , which focused on the " bulk soil " part of the initial stages , whereas the referenced studies focused on microbial mats .
in contrast to the ( relatively ) low genetic potential for n fixation , uptake of organic nitrogen compounds that came about as a result of mineralization seems to be the major n cycling step at the early stages of this ecosystem development .
this is supported by the high abundance of glutamate dehydrogenase genes , which are proxies for mineralization .
these genes were mostly affiliated with heterotrophic free - living organisms like actinomycetales and burkholderiales at the early stages , but changed systematically as succession proceeded ( see results for details ) .
in line with these arguments , it is worth mentioning that ( marine - derived ) c substrates are constantly being provided for mineralization at these initial soil sites ( schrama et al. , 2012 ) .
these external amendments of organic materials occur mostly through the adjective effect of the tides ( i.e. , daily cycles of inundation and water retraction ) .
this process has not only been shown to carry high loads of marine - derived nutrients toward the coast ( schrama et al. , 2012 ) , but it may also have been the key cause of the largely stochastic assembly of the microbial communities at the early stages of this chronosequence ( dini - andreote et al. , 2015 ) .
evidence for niche partitioning in nitrifying and denitrifying communities nitrification in soils is often rate - limited by the first step , the oxidation of ammonia , which is driven by aob and aoa .
across all successional stages , the abundance of the genes involved in nitrification was very low in the metagenomes , yet they were detected at a higher resolution in the qpcr assays .
interestingly , the abundance distributions of nitrification genes across successional stages displayed opposite patterns , providing an indication that niche partitioning influences the abundances of amoa from aob and amoa from aoa across the chronosequence ( figure 3b ) .
this finding feeds the current debate on the drivers of the aob and aoa in soils ( e.g. , sterngren et al. , 2015 ) .
mounting evidence supports a clear niche partitioning between these organismal groups .
for instance , the physiological characterization of culturable ammonia oxidizers has pointed toward their different tolerances to ammonium concentrations - - whereas aoa isolates are inhibited at 2 - 20 nm ( tourna et al. , 2011 ; hatzenpichler , 2012 ) , aob tolerate a concentration of up to 50 - 1000 nm ( koops and pommerening - roser , 2006 ) .
in our study , aob always outnumbered aoa ( aob : aoa ratios of > 1 ) , which is consistent with other data from estuarine and coastal studies ( e.g. , santoro et al. , 2008 ; caffrey et al. , 2010 ; wankel et al. , 2011 ) .
further support for niche partitioning was found in the significant correlations between aob abundance and sulfate concentration ( spearman , rho = 0.34 , p < 0.01 ) , and the marginal positive correlations with other soil chemical parameters ( see figure 4 for details ) .
as for the aoa abundances , they correlated mostly with soil physical structure ( i.e. , sand : silt : clay content ) .
collectively , our data are consistent with a suite of other studies that indicate , in order of importance , that dissolved oxygen , temperature ( directly affected by the soil structure ) , soil salinity , sulfate and n availability exert significant influences on the abundance and composition of the ammonia - oxidizing communities in soils ( e.g. , francis et al. , 2003 ; ward et al. , 2007 ; santoro et al. , 2008 ; moin et al. , 2009 ) .
denitrification , a facultative respiratory pathway in which nitrate is reduced to nitrogen gas through the intermediates nitrite , nitric oxide and nitrous oxide , is a wide - spread process carried out by many bacterial and archaeal taxa ( jones and hallin , 2010 ) .
here , we initially focused on the abundance of genes for two functionally equivalent , yet structurally distinct , nitrate reductase encoding the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide ( nirk and nirs ) .
we found a clear separation of the nirs and nirk types based on the habitat categories studied , which supports the idea that habitat selective factors exert a differential effect on organisms with different nir types ( hallin et al. , 2009 ) .
despite the overrepresentation of nirk over nirs across all successional stages ( nirk : nirs ratios of > 1 at the level of gene copies per gram of soil ) , we found their relative abundances to vary in a distinct manner along the succession. that is , nirk peaked at the initial soil sites ( stages 0 and 5 ) , and steadily decreased over time , whereas nirs showed the opposite pattern ( figure 3c ) .
these findings are in striking conflict with the idea that nirs types dominate in marine habitats whereas nirk prevails in terrestrial systems ( jones and hallin , 2010 ) .
salinity has been suggested as an effective modulator of nir types ( jones and hallin , 2010 ) , and one explanation for this discrepancy might be the progressive accumulation of sodium ( na ) in later stages of the chronosequence .
specifically , the initial soil sites had relatively low levels of na ( ca .
1.8 - 2.4 % by weight ) as compared with the intermediate and late successional stages ( ca .
13.8 - 14.4 %) ( dini - andreote et al. , 2014 , 2015 ; supplementary table 1 ) .
the opposing correlational patterns of nir types and the soil parameters ( including na ) ( figure 4 ) supports the idea of niche partitioning .
this finding is also consistent with smith and ogram ( 2008 ) suggesting that denitrifying communities harboring different nir types respond differently to environmental gradients .
moreover , we also revealed the habitat preferences of two phylogenetic clades of nitrous oxide reductase ( nitrous oxide conversion to dinitrogen ; gene nosz clades i and ii ) .
the nosz clade i encompasses a well - known clade of nitrous oxide reductase ( henry et al. , 2006 ) , whereas clade ii is a recent discovery ( sanford et al. , 2012 ; jones et al. , 2013 ) .
as the latter occurs mostly in bacterial genomes that contain truncated versions of other denitrification genes ( graf et al. , 2014 ) , noszii harboring organisms consume rather than produce n2o , which has critical implications for n cycling in soils ( jones et al. , 2014 ; domeignoz - horta et al. , 2015 ) .
in the salt marsh chronosequence , the abundance of noszi was ca .
10 - fold higher than that of clade ii across all successional stages ( figure 3c ) .
this contrasts with previous findings , where the mean relative abundance of both clades was reported to be similar ( jones et al. , 2013 ) .
moreover , the relative abundances of noszi and noszii correlated with different soil parameters ( figure 4 ) , thus supporting the contention of niche partitioning .
jones et al .
( 2013 ) and domeignoz - horta et al .
( 2015 ) , using structural equation modeling and correlational analyses , reported the chemical and physical properties that drove the distribution of these clades .
whereas in jones et al .
( 2013 ) clade i was most sensitive to shifts in soil texture , shifts in soil chemistry were a more important driver of clade ii. in the light of our divergent findings ( figure 4 ) and given the infancy of the studies on the ecology of these clades , we argue that a thorough study of the factors influencing their distributions across a range of soil biomes with contrasting biotic effects and historical contingencies is needed .
conclusion and methodological considerations this study provides a resolved profile of selected genes involved in different steps of the n cycle in salt marsh soils .
as mentioned , understanding the natural variations intrinsic of such communities and , in doing so , establishing a baseline genetic profile is required for future management of nitrogen dynamics in these systems ( turner et al. , 2009 ; deegan et al. , 2012 ; bowen et al. , 2013 ) .
in particular , we focused on the reconstruction of community genetic potentials and specific niche partitioning of selected genes. through this vantage point , historical contingency , niche structure and varying abiotic variables emerged as key drivers of the ecological distribution and abundance of n cycling genes along the investigated eco - evolutionary chronosequence. of particular importance , caution should be taken in the use of gene quantities as " proxies " for the respective activities in soils , as the abundance and structure of the functional communities do not necessarily reflect their effectiveness ( see brankatschk et al. , 2011 ; sterngren et al. , 2015 ) .
finally , we argue that future programs aiming to monitor coastal habitats , and restore impacted ones , may profit from the methodological and scientific improvements shown herein .
the current robust inventory of n cycle genes and their implementation in a successional framework in the salt marsh soils is a key achievement , and the dynamics and patterns we report can aid in the development of ecological models that aim to explain ecosystem processes and help the recovery of disturbed salt marsh ecosystems .

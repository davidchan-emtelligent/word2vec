the role of natural idiotypic ( id - abs ) and anti - idiotypic ( aid - abs ) autoantibodies against neuro - antigens observed in different neurological disorders is not fully understood .
in particular , limited experimental evidence has been provided concerning the qualitative and quantitative serological response after acute injuries of the central nervous system or during chronic mental diseases .
in this study , we analyzed the specific id - abs and aid - abs serological reactivities against 4 neuro - antigens in a large population of patients with ischemic stroke , schizophrenia , as well as healthy individuals .
patients with ischemic stroke were tested at different time points following the acute stroke episode and a correlation was attempted between autoantibodies response and different patterns of functional recovery .
results showed variable and detectable id - abs and aid - abs in different proportions of all three populations of subjects .
among patients with different functional recovery after ischemic stroke , a difference in time - related trends of id - abs and aid - abs was encountered .
our observations suggest that changes in the production of natural neurotropic abs may engender a positive homeostatic , beside a possible pathogenic effect , in specific neurological disorders .

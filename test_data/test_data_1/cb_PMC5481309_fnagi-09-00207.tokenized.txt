inflammation is a major component of neurodegenerative diseases .
microglia are the innate immune cells in the central nervous system ( cns ) .
in the healthy brain , microglia contribute to tissue homeostasis and regulation of synaptic plasticity .
under disease conditions , they play a key role in the development and maintenance of the neuroinflammatory response , by showing enhanced proliferation and activation .
prion diseases are progressive chronic neurodegenerative disorders associated with the accumulation of the scrapie prion protein prpsc , a misfolded conformer of the cellular prion protein prpc .
this review article provides the current knowledge on the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of prion disease .
a large body of evidence shows that microglia can trigger neurotoxic pathways contributing to progressive degeneration .
yet , microglia are also crucial for controlling inflammatory , repair and regenerative processes .
this dual role of microglia is regulated by multiple pathways and evidences the ability of these cells to polarize into distinct phenotypes with characteristic functions .
the awareness that the neuroinflammatory response is inextricably involved in producing tissue damage as well as repair in neurodegenerative disorders , opens new perspectives for the modulation of the immune system .
a better understanding of this complex process will be essential for developing effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases , in order to improve the quality of life of patients and mitigating the personal , economic and social consequences derived from these diseases .
microglia csf1r proliferation neuroinflammation neurodegnerative diseases medical research council10.13039 / 501100000265alzheimer 's research trust10.13039 / 501100000319 microglia in the healthy brain origin and turnover of microglia since the initial description of microglial cells by pio del rio hortega ( del rio - hortega , 1920 , 1932 ; del rio - hortega and penfield , 1927 ) , their origin has been a source of debate .
however , it has been recently established that tissue resident macrophages as microglia originate from erythroid - myeloid progenitors ( emps ) emerging from the yolk sac ( ys ) during primitive hemeatopoiesis at embryonic stages 7.0 ( e7.0 ) to e9.5 ( cuadros et al. , 1993 ; alliot et al. , 1999 ; schulz et al. , 2012 ; gomez perdiguero et al. , 2015 ; sheng et al. , 2015 ; wang et al. , 2015 ) .
a pioneering study by ginhoux et al .
( 2010 ) allowed finding the earliest microglial progenitors in the ys during mouse development , thanks to fate - mapping experiments that allowed tagging early ys blood - island cells and then follow the emergence of microglial cells into the central nervous system ( cns ) .
fate mapping of ys progenitors from e6.5 to e7.0 produced tagging of less than 4 % of adult microglia , whereas mapping from e7.0 to e7.25 produced 29 % microglia being labeled , allowing the definition that primitive emps that arise before e7.5 are the main contributors to the adult microglial population ( ginhoux et al. , 2010 ) .
then , several studies using tamoxifen - inducible cre lines in which the cre - er - t2 / mer - cre - mer protein was expressed under the control of different genes such as colony stimulating factor receptor 1 ( csf1r ; schulz et al. , 2012 ) , c - kit ( sheng et al. , 2015 ) , tek receptor tyrosine kinase ( tie2 ; gomez perdiguero et al. , 2015 ) corroborated that microglial progenitors have a ys origin .
a recent study by mass et al .
( 2016 ) has allowed a more precise definition of the sequence of differentiation steps leading to the adult microglial population .
in the ys , uncommitted emps ( kit + cd45lo csf1r + aa4.1 +) differentiate into pre - macrophage ( pmac ; kit - cd45hi f4 / 80 - ) that do not yet have a microglial phenotype. from e9.5 , as they initiate a core macrophage transcriptional program , those pmacs colonize the whole embryo in a c - x3 - c motif chemokine receptor 1 ( cx3cr1 ) - dependent manner .
indeed , at e9.5 and e10.5 , cx3cr1 - deficient embryos exhibit a delay in the colonization of progenitors and a decrease of pmacs and macrophages population in the head while they display an accumulation of pmacs in the ys and fetal liver ( mass et al. , 2016 ) .
immediately following colonization of the embryonic brain , a tissue specific transcriptional program is triggered and leads to the production of postnatal microglia , including a downregulation of t - cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 4 ( timd4 ) and mannose receptor ( cd206 ) and an upregulation of sal - like ( sall ) 1 and sall3 ( lavin et al. , 2014 ; mass et al. , 2016 ) .
as the embryo develops , microglia progenitors mature in a interferon regulatory factor 8 ( irf8 ) and pu.1 - dependant manner by expressing a set of different markers including csf1r , runt - related transcription factor ( runx1 ) , ionized calcium - binding adaptor molecule 1 ( iba1 ) , c - x3 - c motif chemokine receptor ( cx3cr1 ) , tie2 , the cluster of differentiation 45 ( cd45 ) or c - kit ( kierdorf et al. , 2013 ; mass et al. , 2016 ) .
in humans , microglial cells are identified in the extracerebral mesenchyme around 4.5 gestational weeks .
at 5 gestational weeks , they invade the parenchyma by entering the brain primordium via the developing meninges , ventricular zone and choroid plexus ( monier et al. , 2006 ; verney et al. , 2010 ) and they only exhibit a ramified morphology around the 35th week ( hutchins et al. , 1990 ; esiri et al. , 1991 ; rezaie and male , 1999 ) .
in the adult , the microglial population is maintained by a self - renewal process ( lawson et al. , 1992 ; askew et al. , 2017 ; figure 1 ) .
a foundational study by lawson et al .
( 1992 ) defined a remarkably slow turnover rate of adult murine microglia , by means of analyzing short - term 3h tymidine incorporation .
however , more recent insight arising from repopulation paradigms suggested that microglia could have a higher turnover capacity in the steady state .
the pharmacological depletion of microglia , by using a potent csf1r inhibitor , is followed by the rapid reconstitution of the microglia population by proliferation of resident microglia , without the contribution of circulating monocytes ( elmore et al. , 2014 ) .
a transgenic paradigm , allowing the depletion of microglia by diphtheria toxin injection , validated this repopulating capacity , independent of circulating monocytes ( bruttger et al. , 2015 ) .
although these repopulation paradigms are distal from modeling a homeostatic system , they suggested a latent potential for microglial cells to proliferate more rapidly than thought before , allowing the colonization of an empty niche .
in this line , a recent study from our group showed that in mice and humans the turnover of microglia in the steady state is remarkably fast , allowing the whole population to be renewed several times during a lifetime ( askew et al. , 2017 ) .
indeed , whereas the previous study in the healthy brain , using 3h thymidine and immunohistochemistry for f4 / 80 , had shown that , at a given time , only 0.05 % of the microglia were proliferating ( lawson et al. , 1992 ) , askew et al .
( 2017 ) recently demonstrated that 0.69 % of the microglial population is proliferating by using more sensitive techniques ( brdu incorporation detected in iba1 + cells and 2 - photon live imaging ) .
microglial proliferation is balanced by microglial apoptosis , with these two mechanisms being synchronized in time and space , allowing for a rapid remodeling of the microglial landscape during a lifetime , without the contribution of circulating monocytes ( askew et al. , 2017 ) .
figure 1 microglia in the prion - diseased brain .
in the healthy brain , microglia constantly surveil their microenvironment for any disturbance of brain homeostasis and are kept in this surveiling state by signals mainly originating from healthy neurons .
the microglial population is maintained by local self - renewal mediated via csf1r and its ligands csf1 and il - 34 .
in the context of neurodegeneration and protein accumulation present in the prion - diseased brain , the microglial response is characterized by functional changes involving increased proliferation , an inflammatory activation and the removal of apoptotic neurons .

distribution and function of microglia in the adult brain the density and morphology of microglia varies considerably across the healthy adult brain .
in the mouse brain , there are an estimated total number of 3.5 x 106 microglial cells , however their distribution varies from 5 % in the cortex and corpus callosum , to 12 % in the substantia nigra ( lawson et al. , 1990 ) .
in mice , microglia are more numerous in gray matter than white matter and areas as the hippocampus , basal ganglia and substantia nigra are particularly densely populated in microglia ( lawson et al. , 1990 ) .
in comparison , the less densely populated areas include fiber tracts , cerebellum and much of the brainstem whereas the cerebral cortex , thalamus and hypothalamus have average cell densities ( lawson et al. , 1990 ) .
this cell density remains constant from early postnatal development to aging , thanks to the constant turnover of the population ( askew et al. , 2017 ) .
in the human brain , microglia has been estimated to make up 6 % - 18 % of neocortical cells ( mittelbronn et al. , 2001 ; pelvig et al. , 2008 ; lyck et al. , 2009 ) .
similarly , microglial morphology varies considerably depending on specific regional properties .
whereas they are usually more ramified in gray matter , in white matter they display elongated somata and less ramified processes preferentially oriented along fiber tracts ( lawson et al. , 1990 ; mittelbronn et al. , 2001 ; torres - platas et al. , 2014 ) .
the molecular determinants of those anatomical differences in diversity and morphology are not clearly defined , however recent studies showed that microglia have a distinct region - dependent and age - dependent transcriptomic signature corroborating the existence of the regional heterogeneity of microglial phenotypes ( hickman et al. , 2013 ; grabert et al. , 2016 ; soreq et al. , 2017 ) .
in the healthy brain , microglia display a " surveilling " phenotype characterized by a small cell body and long branching processes serving to continuously sense the microenvironment to detect any alteration of cns homeostasis ( kettenmann et al. , 2013 ; figure 1 ) .
microglia show invariant soma positions but continually and rapidly moving processes ( average velocity around 2.5 mum / min ; davalos et al. , 2005 ; nimmerjahn et al. , 2005 ; wake et al. , 2009 ) .
microglias rapidly change their surveilling phenotype into a diversity of " activated " phenotypes after the alteration of the cns homeostasis or presence of a threat to neuronal integrity .
they adopt a more amoeboid and less ramified phenotype with a large soma and rapidly trigger appropriate responses , which could range from upregulation or de novo synthesis of cell - surface molecules such as cd68 and major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class ii to phagocytosis or the release of molecular mediators , including immune and non - immune factors ( kettenmann et al. , 2011 ; figure 1 ) .
consequently , this activated phenotype is a generalized term that fails to take into account that microglia can adopt numerous functionally different phenotypes , depending on the exact nature of the stimulus ( perry et al. , 2010 ) .
in the healthy brain , microglia is involved in several mechanisms regulating cns physiology .
microglia are in direct contact with dendritic spines , axons and synapses , suggesting that they participate in the regulation of synaptic structure and function ( wake et al. , 2009 ; paolicelli et al. , 2011 ; squarzoni et al. , 2014 ) .
one of these mechanisms is synaptic pruning , a process by which excess synapses formed in the developing brain are eliminated to thereby increase the efficiency of the neural network .
in this process , microglia has been shown in direct contact with the synapses and removing unwanted elements by phagocytosis ( paolicelli et al. , 2011 ) .
electron microscopy and high resolution in vivo engulfment assays have showed also the presence of presynaptic and postsynaptic elements inside microglial lysosomes ( berbel and innocenti , 1988 ; tremblay et al. , 2010 ; schafer et al. , 2012 ) .
some proteins as complement receptor 3 ( cr3 / cd11b ) , cx3cr1 or the adaptor protein dnax - activating protein of 12 - kda ( dap12 ) , highly expressed by microglia , are involved in the process of synaptic pruning .
indeed it has been shown that disruption of one of those proteins resulted in synaptic abnormalities in both prenatal and postnatal brain development ( stevens et al. , 2007 ; paolicelli et al. , 2011 ; squarzoni et al. , 2014 ) .
as mentioned above , the interactions between microglia and their surrounding cells have a major role in the determination of the microglial phenotype .
healthy neurons maintain microglia in their surveilling state via secreted and membrane bound signals .
the interaction of neuronal cd200 with microglial cd200r leads to inactivation of microglia and plays a critical role in neuroprotection ( lyons et al. , 2007 ) .
in cd200 - deficient mice , microglia are more numerous , form more aggregate - like structures , display less ramifications with shorter processes and show an upregulation of cd45 and cd11b , which are markers of activation ( hoek et al. , 2000 ) .
the bidirectional signaling between sirpalpha and cd47 that can be co - expressed by both neurons and microglia maintains microglia in their surveilling state by inhibiting phagocytosis and inducing the synthesis of the anti - inflammatory cytokines ( zhang et al. , 2015 ) .
the interaction of neuronal cx3cl1 with microglial cx3cr1 constrains microglial activation ( lyons et al. , 2009 ) .
in models for parkinson 's disease ( pd ) under a cx3cr1 - deficient background , microglia exhibit an over - activated phenotype and neuronal cell death is enhanced ( bhaskar et al. , 2010 ; cho et al. , 2011 ) .
the neurotoxicity induced by activated microglia in neurodegenerative diseases seems to be worsened in cx3cr1 - deficient mice , suggesting that the signaling through cx3cl1 / cx3cr1 regulates the phenotype of microglia ( cardona et al. , 2006 ) .
another receptor involved in the maintenance of the microglial surveilling state is the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 ( trem2 ) associated with the adaptor protein dap12 .
trem2 is essential for phagocytosis process by microglia ( takahashi et al. , 2007 ) and has recently been shown to interact with specific lipids to promote microglial survival ( wang et al. , 2015 ) .
mutations leading to a loss of function in trem2 or dap12 underlie the nasu - hakola disease , in which patients display progressive presenile dementia ( paloneva et al. , 2000 , 2002 ) .
microglia also express receptors that trigger essential cellular survival and developmental signals .
csf1r plays a major role in microglial development and survival .
expressed by microglia ( akiyama et al. , 1994 ; raivich et al. , 1998 ) , csf1r is activated by two homodimeric glycoprotein ligands , csf1 ( stanley and heard , 1977 ) and interleukin 34 ( il - 34 ; lin et al. , 2008 ) .
in the brain , il - 34 is primarily expressed by neurons ( mizuno et al. , 2011 ; wang et al. , 2012 ) whereas csf1 is mainly expressed by microglia ( chitu et al. , 2016 ) .
these two ligands present different patterns of regional expression in the prenatal and postnatal brain .
csf1 is highly expressed in the neocortex , corpus callosum , cerebellum and spinal cord , whereas il - 34 is highly expressed in the forebrain ( neocortex , olfactory bulb and striatum ; wei et al. , 2010 ; nandi et al. , 2012 ) .
the binding of csf1 or il - 34 to csf1r leads to the oligomerization and transphosphorylation of csf1r followed by the phosphorylation and activation of downstream cytoplasmic mediators that promote microglia development , survival and proliferation ( segaliny et al. , 2015 ) .
as described previously , the development of tissue - resident macrophages including microglia is dependent on csf1r expression from the first stages of development ( mass et al. , 2016 ) .
moreover , il - 34 - deficient and csf1 - deficient mice display fewer microglia in various regions of the brain while csf1r - deficient mice are completely devoid of them ( dai et al. , 2002 ; ginhoux et al. , 2010 ) .
in addition to their manifold functions in maintaining homeostasis in the healthy brain , microglia have been shown to play a major role in driving innate inflammatory responses in many neurodegenerative diseases .
prion disease is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration , which is accompanied by a pronounced microglia - mediated immune response , therefore being an extraordinary model to study the role of microglia in chronic neurodegenerative diseases .
in this review , we will explore the molecular determinants of the contribution of microglia to the pathogenic cascade in prion disease , aiming to address some of the most relevant remaining unknowns of the role of microglia in prion disease : is microglial activation merely a bystander effect of prion pathology , or what aspects of microglia - mediated immune response are contributing to disease outcome in a beneficial or detrimental manner ?
can the microglia - derived inflammatory response directly harm neurons and lead to neuronal degeneration , or is neuronal loss a consequence of misfolded prion protein ( scrapie ) ( prpsc ) accumulation , or a combination of both ?
in the following sections , we will provide a comprehensive picture defining many aspects of microglial biology in prion disease .
prion pathology transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases , such as creutzfeldt - jakob disease ( cjd ) , are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and many other mammals ( aguzzi and calella , 2009 ) .
the infectious agent consists of prpsc .
prpsc can aggregate , recruit and convert benign cellular prion protein ( prpc ) into abnormal pathological isoforms ( aguzzi and calella , 2009 ) .
thereby , prions act as " seeds " that trigger a chain reaction of prp misfolding and aggregation ( jarrett and lansbury , 1993 ) .
prion diseases have a heterogeneous etiology , as they can be genetic , infectious or sporadic .
infectivity requires the transfer of prion seeds from affected individuals into healthy hosts , whereas in genetic and idiopathic cases prion protein undergoes a spontaneous misfolding of prp molecules into self - propagating seeds .
in humans , sporadic cjd ( scjd ) is the most common prion disease , followed by genetic cjd ( gcjd ) and transmitted cjd ( iatrogenic cjd and variant cjd ; aguzzi and calella , 2009 ) .
cjd has been also shown to be transmitted through blood or blood derivatives ( llewelyn et al. , 2004 ; bishop et al. , 2013 ) .
the prion neuropathology is characterized by spongiform degeneration , synaptic and neuronal loss , gliosis and the accumulation of aggregated prpsc ( dearmond and prusiner , 1995 ; cunningham et al. , 2003 ; wadsworth and collinge , 2011 ; hilton et al. , 2013 ) .
prion disease typically has long incubation times and a rapid disease progression , and can be manifested in different ways , with behavioral and pathological differences within and across species ( prusiner , 1998 ; tanaka et al. , 2006 ; collinge and clarke , 2007 ; colby and prusiner , 2011 ) .
interestingly , different strains of prion ( e.g. , me7 , 79a , 22l , 22a ) preferentially affect specific regions of the brain in mice ( cunningham et al. , 2005a ) .
the simplest explanation for such regional selectivity would be a differential tropism of prion strains and thereby a regional aggregation and toxicity .
however , recent experiments assessing prion misfolding using highly sensitive techniques showed that prion protein seeds accumulate in all brain regions irrespective of neurodegeneration ( alibhai et al. , 2016 ) .
prions disease also provides an interesting experimental approach to model many aspects of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding .
in mouse models of prion disease , microglia become activated early in the disease process thereby representing a valuable tool for elucidating the impact of neuroinflammation in chronic neurodegenerative disorders .
microglial proliferation and activation in prion disease prion disease is characterized by an increase in the number of microglia , associated with an activated and phagocytic phenotype ( perry et al. , 2002 ; perry and o'connor , 2010 ; figure 1 ) .
the relative contribution of local proliferation of microglia vs. the infiltration of bone - marrow derived progenitors to this increase has been a source of debate during recent years ( gomez - nicola and perry , 2015 ) .
however , a recent study demonstrated that , in a murine model of prion disease , local proliferation of resident microglial cells is a major component in the evolution of chronic neurodegeneration ( gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ) .
the increase in microglial density and proliferative activity varies across different regions such as the hippocampus ( ca1 ) and the thalamus , the later showing the biggest increase in cell numbers ( gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ) .
this increase in microglial numbers is independent of the recruitment of circulating monocytes , evidenced by comparing microglial density in prion diseased mice with a c - c chemokine receptor type 2 ( ccr2 ) - / - background with wt mice ( gomez - nicola et al. , 2014 ) .
the proliferation of microglia in prion disease is regulated by the activation of csf1r and the transcription factors pu.1 and ccaat / enhancer - binding protein alpha ( c / ebpalpha , being this system also active in human variant cjd and alzheimer 's disease ( ad ; gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ; olmos - alonso et al. , 2016 ) .
the inhibition of csf1r blocks the proliferation of microglia , leading to a decrease in neuronal death in the hippocampus ( gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ) .
a recent study showed that prolonged inhibition of csf1r in appswe / psen1de9 ( app / ps1 ) mice , a model of ad - like pathology , blocks microglial proliferation and leads to the prevention of synaptic degeneration and to an improvement of performance in memory and exploratory tasks ( olmos - alonso et al. , 2016 ) .
csf1r blockade also showed positive effect in mutant superoxide dismutase 1 ( sod1 ) models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) by reducing microglial proliferation in the spinal cord and macrophage infiltration into peripheral nerves ( martinez - muriana et al. , 2016 ) .
the studies focused to targeting csf1r suggest that microglial proliferation in prion disease , ad and als has a net detrimental contribution to the disease progression .
targeting microglial proliferation by the specific inhibition of csf1r renders a different experimental outcome than the unspecific removal of microglia .
some studies have aimed at eliminating microglial cells in prion disease , either by the transgenic expression of thymidine kinase ( tk ) and " suicide " of proliferating cd11b + cells ( zhu et al. , 2016 ) , or by the non - specific blocker of mitosis cytosine arabinoside ( ara - c ; gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ) .
these approaches indicated a neutral or beneficial role of microglia , as their elimination did not change the trajectory of the disease .
however , the technical limitations of these targeting approaches difficult the interpretation .
for example , the use of cd11b - tk mice leads to a prominent and uncontrolled death of microglia in the context of on - going neurodegeneration , not providing a physiologically silent way to address the contribution of the cells .
also , the tk transgene in cd11b - tk mice is activated by the administration of ganciclovir , an agent recently identified to have a potent anti - proliferative impact on microglia during brain pathology ( ding et al. , 2014 ) .
similarly , the use of ara - c causes a shift in the microglial phenotype towards a detrimental pro - inflammatory profile , independent from its effects on cell proliferation , accelerating neuronal death ( gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ) .
together , these findings suggest that the specific and selective targeting of microglial proliferation , instead to their elimination , is an optimal approach to understand the contribution of these cells to the pathology .
activation of microglia is detectable from early stages of prion disease pathogenesis ( betmouni et al. , 1996 ) and becomes more widespread as the disease progresses , closely associated with the spread of neurodegeneration ( perry , 2016 ) .
microglial activation appears simultaneously with first behavioral deficits ( guenther et al. , 2001 ) , at a time point when synapses start to degenerate in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus , but no neuronal loss occurs yet ( cunningham et al. , 2003 ; gray et al. , 2009 ). whether microglia activation is directly caused by accumulating misfolded prpsc or as a response to synaptic damage cannot be reliably concluded .
while studies in vitro have demonstrated that microglia can be activated directly by prp and subsequently damage neurons ( brown et al. , 1996 ; giese et al. , 1998 ) , there is limited evidence of a direct response to prpsc aggregates in vivo .
in contrast , the mere presence of misfolded prion protein , as detected in various brain regions using high sensitivity techniques , might not be sufficient to induce a microglia - mediated immune response in all brain regions ( alibhai et al. , 2016 ) .
however , it is widely accepted that microglia activation precedes neuronal degeneration and the onset of clinical disease ( williams et al. , 1997 ; giese et al. , 1998 ) .
the cytokine profile in the prion - diseased brain is associated with the expression of both pro - and anti - inflammatory molecules ( perry , 2016 ; figure 1 ) .
while a number of studies demonstrated a profile shifted to the anti - inflammatory spectrum , dominated by the expression of transforming growth factor beta ( tgfbeta , c - c motif chemokine ligand 2 ( ccl2 ) and prostaglandin e2 ( pge2 ) with a limited pro - inflammatory response characterized by il - 1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnfa ; minghetti et al. , 2000 ; walsh et al. , 2001 ; cunningham et al. , 2002 , 2005b ; perry et al. , 2002 ) , other studies have reported that also pro - inflammatory factors are up - regulated in the prion brain ( campbell et al. , 1994 ; williams et al. , 1994 ; kordek et al. , 1996 ) , suggestive of a mixed inflammatory profile .
the lack of consensus regarding the inflammatory profile in the prion brain may arise from the fact that different prion strains , stages of disease and techniques of detection were used .
recent studies using a broader panel of markers support the hypothesis that both pro - and anti - inflammatory factors contribute to the immune response in prion disease .
vincenti et al .
( 2015 ) re - analyzed a large transcriptomic database of brains from multiple mouse strains exposed to various prion strains and collected at different stages of disease progression ( hwang et al. , 2009 ) and proposed that most of the differentially expressed genes in the prion brain were of microglial origin and associated with the inflammatory response .
microglia isolated from 79a - infected mice showed increased expression of il - 1beta , tnfalpha and csf1 , but not il - 6 , il - 10 or tgfbeta , which correlates with disease progression and indicates a classical activation phenotype of microglia in this prion model ( vincenti et al. , 2015 ) .
a recent longitudinal study reported new inflammatory genes upregulated early in the prion brain , including genes involved in inflammation , monocyte recruitment and growth regulation ( carroll et al. , 2015 ) .
concerning signal transduction pathways , an early activation predominantly of the signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat ) - and nuclear factor kappa - light - chain - enhancer of activated b cells ( nfkb ) pathways has been observed in prion disease models , determined by the up - regulation of stat - and nfkb - responsive genes , including many cytokines and chemokines , as well as by the detection of increased phosphorylation of stat1 and stat3 specifically ( llorens et al. , 2014 ; carroll et al. , 2015 ) .
the inflammatory response seems to be quite consistent between different murine prion strains .
although prion strains 22l , rml and me7 revealed cellular and regional differences in prpsc accumulation , they showed a similar up - regulation mainly of pro - inflammatory genes and chemokines which correlated with the deposition of prpsc and the onset of glial activation ( carroll et al. , 2016 ) .
targeting individual immune pathways which are dysregulated in prion disease have shown differential effects in modifying pathology .
the absence of ccl2 does not drastically affect the disease course ( felton et al. , 2005 ; o'shea et al. , 2008 ) and similarly , reducing pge2 levels using dapsone or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) did not impact disease progression ( guenther et al. , 2001 ; perry , 2010 ) .
on the contrary , inhibition of tgfbeta enhanced neurodegeneration , indicating that this immune mediator is critically involved in regulation of the innate immune response in prion disease ( boche et al. , 2006 ) .
tnfalpha as well as tnf receptor 1 knockout mice show normal prion disease progression after intracerebral injection of the prion protein ( klein et al. , 1997 ; mabbott et al. , 2000 ) , whereas deficiency of il - 1 receptor type 1 prolongs prion incubation time ( tamguney et al. , 2008 ) and delays disease onset and protein aggregation and increases survival of diseased mice ( schultz et al. , 2004 ) .
prp fibrils have been found to induce il - 1beta secretion by microglia in vitro , dependent on components of the nod - like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 ( nlrp3 ) inflammasome , is sufficient to induce neuronal toxicity ( hafner - bratkovic et al. , 2012 ; shi et al. , 2012 ) .
however , an in vivo study using mice deficient in nlrp3 or the adaptor protein apoptosis - associated speck - like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain ( asc ) and thereby lacking functional nlrp3 inflammasome , failed to demonstrate a significant impact on prion pathogenesis , indicating that inflammasomes do not contribute to prion progression ( nuvolone et al. , 2015 ) .
numerous studies have reported signs of oxidative stress in brains of cjd patients as well as in murine models of prion disease ( guentchev et al. , 2002 ; van everbroeck et al. , 2004 ; yun et al. , 2006 ) , which might play a role in disease progression by contributing to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration .
stimulation of microglia with prp fragments in vitro has been shown to induce growth arrest and the release of nitric oxide ( no ) and pge2 ( villa et al. , 2016 ) .
furthermore , in patients with cjd as well as in a mouse model of prion , production of nadph oxidase 2 ( nox2 ) was up - regulated specifically by microglia in the affected brain regions ( sorce et al. , 2014 ) .
prion - induced mice deficient in nox2 demonstrated decreased production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , a delayed onset of motor deficits and an increased survival time , indicating that microglia - specific nox2 production leads to the release of ros and affects prion pathology ( sorce et al. , 2014 ) .
it has been shown that microglia are able to engulf and clear apoptotic neurons ( hughes et al. , 2010 ; kranich et al. , 2010 ) .
the phagocytic function of microglia is increased in the prion - diseased brain and associated with enhanced expression of scavenger receptors , cathepsins , and proteins of the respiratory burst , while phagocytic microglia were characterized by a lack of il - 1beta expression ( hughes et al. , 2010 ) .
while microglia were efficient in the uptake of injected latex beads and apoptotic cells , they were unable to remove prion protein aggregates , even upon additional stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ( lps ; hughes et al. , 2010 ) .
phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons by microglia has been shown to be dependent on milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 ( mfge8 ) .
ablation of mfge8 resulted in accelerated prion pathology , with reduced clearance of apoptotic bodies and increased prion protein accumulation , indicating that microglia phagocytosis via mfge8 is a protective mechanism in prion disease ( kranich et al. , 2010 ) .
while in vitro studies using microglia cells or organotypic brain slices proposed that microglia can clear prp and thereby decrease prion titers ( mchattie et al. , 1999 ; falsig et al. , 2009 ; kranich et al. , 2010 ; zhu et al. , 2016 ) , evidence that they do so in vivo is still missing .
it is possible that the removal of misfolded prion protein is simply inefficient or that prpsc is not a sufficient trigger to induce phagocytosis , a similar concept to that proposed for phagocytosis of amyloid beta ( abeta in ad ( guillot - sestier and town , 2013 ; prokop et al. , 2013 ) .
furthermore , while the phagocytic function of microglia in prion disease is mostly considered to be beneficial and protective , it is also conceivable that microglia , by taking up cell debris from prion infected cells or possibly prp aggregates , might even contribute to the spreading of the pathogenic protein ( baker et al. , 2002 ) .
trem2 has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases such as ad ( jonsson et al. , 2012 ; guerreiro r. j. et al. , 2013 ) , frontotemporal dementia ( guerreiro r. et al. , 2013 ) and als ( cady et al. , 2014 ) .
trem2 is an innate immune cell receptor expressed on microglia and other myeloid cells is thought to be involved in phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons and promoting an anti - inflammatory phenotype ( takahashi et al. , 2005 , 2007 ; hsieh et al. , 2009 ) .
in the context of prion disease , trem2 has been demonstrated to be up - regulated after prion infection , but the depletion of trem2 did neither change incubation time and survival , nor microglia immune phenotype during prion disease ( zhu et al. , 2015 ) .
recently , there has been evidence of the involvement of non - coding micrornas ( mir ) in regulating the microglia inflammatory response in prion disease .
a number of mirs implicated in the regulation of gliosis , glial cell proliferation , the innate - immune response , inflammatory signaling , deficits in neurotrophic signaling and synaptogenesis have been found to be upregulated in human prion disease cases ( zhao et al. , 2016 ) .
among them , mir - 146a was observed to influence immune response and activation state of microglia ( saba et al. , 2012 ) .
while increasing evidence indicates that microglia activation seems to contribute to prion pathogenesis , not much is known about the mechanistic underpinnings .
we have shown recently that microglial expansion negatively affects prion disease pathology ( gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ) , pointing towards a net detrimental role of microglia during chronic neurodegeneration .
another recent study emphasized a protective role of microglia in prion disease , demonstrating accelerated disease pathology upon microglia ablation in the brain ( zhu et al. , 2016 ) .
this dual role of microglia during prion disease provides further proof that microglia function is highly dynamic and versatile , by promoting neurotoxic effects through facilitating a potentially aberrant and harmful inflammation in prion disease , but also by provoking a protective response through tissue maintenance and repair .
systemic inflammation and microglial priming the study of immune to brain communication is gaining interest , with the immune system as a transducer of both endogenous and exogenous challenges to the host .
it is known that systemic infection and inflammation are able to produce behavioral changes , known as " sickness behaviors " , that include fever , malaise , anorexia , lethargy and depression ( dantzer et al. , 1998 ) , demonstrating an important influence of the immune system on cns processes .
lps challenge in healthy humans has been shown to produce sickness behavior with fever and neuropsychological symptoms , including reduced declarative memory performance ( krabbe et al. , 2005 ) and increased symptoms of depression ( dellagioia et al. , 2012 ) .
systemic inflammation communicates with the brain by several neural and humoral pathways .
receptors for inflammatory mediators present on vagus nerve fibers can respond to inflammatory signals and inform the nucleus of the solitary tract and other regions of the brain ( wang et al. , 2003 ) .
macrophages in the circumventricular organs ( cvos ) , which are regions of the cns without a tight blood - brain barrier ( bbb ) , are also able to communicate with systemic inflammatory mediators .
signals generated in the cvos subsequently travel to other regions of the brain ( lacroix et al. , 1998 ) .
a third route of communication involves cerebral endothelial cells of the bbb , which can transduce signals from blood to the cns ( laflamme and rivest , 1999 ) .
the molecular pathways by which systemic inflammation alters brain function leading to sickness behavior are not completely elucidated .
it has been suggested that the link between the systemic immune system and the cns is located at the level of the hypothalamus , the main brain region controlling the neuroendocrine system .
systemic inflammation or ageing can modify the hypothalamic function though nfkb activation and microglial - neuronal crosstalk ( li et al. , 2012 ; zhang et al. , 2013 ) .
further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism underpinning the alteration of neuronal function by systemic inflammation .
it is known that microglia play an important role in immune - to - brain communication ( perry and teeling , 2013 ) .
within this context , the concept of microglial priming has been proposed .
microglial priming occurs as a result of damage associated with chronic neurodegenerative conditions ( e.g. , misfolded protein , neuronal debris or vascular changes ) , or several other stressors affecting the nervous system , such as maternal separation , acute injury or aging .
it consists of an exaggerated or heightened microglial response - - much stronger than that observed in stimulus - naive microglia - - to a second inflammatory stimulus .
most of the evidence supporting the hypothesis of microglial priming in chronic neurodegenerative conditions arises from the study of prion models .
in fact , microglial priming was first described in prion brains subjected to a systemic challenge mimicking systemic infection ( combrinck et al. , 2002 ) .
cunningham et al .
( 2005b ) showed how intracerebral lps injection in prion mice results in exacerbated il - 1beta expression , neutrophil infiltration and no expression , accompanied with increased cell death .
systemic injection of lps ( cunningham et al. , 2009 ) , polyinosinic - polycytidylic acid ( poly i : c ; cunningham et al. , 2002 , 2005b , 2007 ; field et al. , 2010 ) or tnfalpha ( hennessy et al. , 2017 ) in prion mice also leads to exacerbated in the brain , with increased expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including il - 1beta tnfalpha and ccl2 .
interestingly , the increased inflammation triggered by lps in me7 prion brain is independent on circulating il - 1beta and il - 6 ( murray et al. , 2011 ; hennessy et al. , 2017 ) .
although the exact mechanism by which microglia is primed is still unknown , it has been suggested that cyclooxygenase 1 ( cox - 1 ) expression in microglia mediates the systemic effects of lps in the prion brain ( griffin et al. , 2013 ) .
more recently , hennessy et al .
( 2017 ) reported that astrocytes could be also primed in the prion brain , and generate exaggerated levels of cytokines and chemokines after systemic lps challenge .
although these findings suggest that microglia in the prion diseased brain are primed by the ongoing pathology and that a secondary stimulus switches these cells to an aggressive phenotype , there is still no defining criteria to classify this state , and it remains unclear whether different patterns of priming result from different forms of neurodegeneration or different systemic inflammatory stimuli .
interestingly , priming observations and the impact of the immune system on the cns are not restricted to prion disease ( perry , 2010 ; cunningham , 2013 ) .
systemic lps injection can induce degeneration of cells in the substantia nigra ( gao et al. , 2002 ; qin et al. , 2007 ) and systemic challenge with il - 1beta in an animal model of pd leads to enhanced degeneration of substantia nigra neurons and pro - inflammatory cytokine production ( pott - godoy et al. , 2008 ) .
systemic challenge with lps or other bacterial toxins in an experimental model of multiple sclerosis , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( eae ) , can also exacerbate neurological symptoms ( schiffenbauer et al. , 1993 ) .
systemic lps challenge caused increased synthesis of pro - inflammatory cytokines in the cns of transgenic mouse models of ad - like pathology ( sly et al. , 2001 ) , and tau phosphorylation ( roe et al. , 2011 ) .
chronic systemic inflammation in the form of osteoarthritis results in accelerated neuroinflammation and abeta pathology in app / ps1 / col1 - il1betaxat mice ( kyrkanides et al. , 2011 ) .
there is also evidence about the impact of the immune system upon human neurodegenerative diseases .
systemic infection and increased systemic inflammation have been associated to an enhanced cognitive decline in ad patients ( holmes et al. , 2003 , 2009 , 2011 ) , and systemic infections are associated with relapses in multiple sclerosis in patients ( buljevac et al. , 2002 ) .
overall , evidence suggests that systemic inflammation contributes to the pathology during chronic neurodegenerative conditions , with microglia acting as a hub of communication between the systemic and cns compartments .
according to this view , it is likely that a correct treatment and management of systemic inflammation could potentially delay the progression of neurodegenerative disorders .
role of microglia in human prion diseases evidence from the literature supports a role of microglia - mediated inflammation in human prion diseases .
activated microglia are found in the brains of cjd patients ( sasaki et al. , 1993 ; szpak et al. , 2006 ) where they appear to be closely associated with prpsc deposits ( miyazono et al. , 1991 ; guiroy et al. , 1994 ; muhleisen et al. , 1995 ) .
however the degree of microglial reactivity seems to depend on the subtype of prion disease and the type of biochemical prpsc ( puoti et al. , 2005 ; shi et al. , 2013 ) .
increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as il - 8 , ccl2 , tgfbeta , tnfalpha and il - 1beta have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) of sporadic cjd cases ( sharief et al. , 1999 ; stoeck et al. , 2006 , 2014 ) and the inflammatory response seems to correlate with the severity of lesions ( van everbroeck et al. , 2002 ) .
a recent study demonstrated subtype - specific and region - specific changes in glia activation and the expression of inflammatory mediators in cjd , with inflammation being pre - dominant in the cerebral cortex in the cjd subtype prnp codon 129 met / met type 1 ( mm1 ) and in the cerebellum in prnp codon 129 val / val type 2 ( vv2 ) cases ( llorens et al. , 2014 ) .
microglia markers such as cd11b , iba - 1 and cd68 were found to be up - regulated in a region - and subtype - specific manner which correlated with the up - regulation of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines , members of the complement system , the integrin family and c - type lectin / c - type lectin - like domain ( ctl / ctld ) superfamily , toll - like receptors , colony - stimulating factors and cathepsins ( llorens et al. , 2014 ) .
additionally , regulatory proteins il - 34 , pu.1 and c / ebpalpha involved in microglial proliferation are increased in variant cjd ( gomez - nicola et al. , 2013 ) .
the increased inflammatory response observed in the two subtypes of cjd was further associated with an activation of nfkb and stat1 , 3 signaling pathways ( llorens et al. , 2014 ) .
the finding that key regulators of inflammationcox - 1 / 2 and pge2 , are elevated in brains of cjd ( minghetti et al. , 2000 ; deininger et al. , 2003 ; llorens et al. , 2014 ) further speaks for a crucial role of inflammatory processes in human prion disease , however the exact role of microglia - mediated inflammation during the course of the fatal disease remains to be elucidated .
conclusion increasing evidence highlights the major contribution of the expansion and activation of microglia to the pathogenesis of prion disease .
activated microglia adopts a variety of functionally diverse phenotypes depending on the disease stage and systemic influences .
while their response is manifold during prion disease , targeting the microglia - mediated immune response appears to be a useful approach to modify the disease course .
determining the exact mechanistic underpinnings of the neuroinflammatory processes in prion disease is an informative step in order to develop novel treatment strategies targeting neurodegenerative disease .

pompe disease , also known as glycogen storage disease ( gsd ) type ii , is caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha - glucosidase ( gaa ) .
the resulting glycogen accumulation causes a spectrum of disease severity ranging from a rapidly progressive course that is typically fatal by 1 to 2 years of age to a slower progressive course that causes significant morbidity and early mortality in children and adults .
the aim of this study is to better understand the biochemical consequences of glycogen accumulation in the pompe mouse .
we evaluated glycogen metabolism in heart , triceps , quadriceps , and liver from wild type and several strains of gaa - / - mice .
unexpectedly , we observed that lysosomal glycogen storage correlated with a robust increase in factors that normally promote glycogen biosynthesis .
the gaa - / - mouse strains were found to have elevated glycogen synthase ( gs ) , glycogenin , hexokinase , and glucose - 6 - phosphate ( g - 6 - p , the allosteric activator of gs ) .
treating gaa - / - mice with recombinant human gaa ( rhgaa ) led to a dramatic reduction in the levels of glycogen , gs , glycogenin , and g - 6 - p. lysosomal glycogen storage also correlated with a dysregulation of phosphorylase , which normally breaks down cytoplasmic glycogen .
analysis of phosphorylase activity confirmed a previous report that , although phosphorylase protein levels are identical in muscle lysates from wild type and gaa - / - mice , phosphorylase activity is suppressed in the gaa - / - mice in the absence of amp .
this reduction in phosphorylase activity likely exacerbates lysosomal glycogen accumulation .
if the dysregulation in glycogen metabolism observed in the mouse model of pompe disease also occurs in pompe patients , it may contribute to the observed broad spectrum of disease severity .

introduction glycogen storage disease type ii , also known as pompe disease and acid maltase deficiency is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder .
it is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha - glucosidase ( gaa ; ec 3.2.1.3 ) an exo - 1,4 and 1,6 - alpha - glucosidase that hydrolyzes glycogen to glucose in the lysosome .
deficiency of gaa leads to glycogen accumulation in lysosomes and causes progressive damage to respiratory , cardiac , and skeletal muscle .
the disease ranges from a rapidly progressive infantile course that is usually fatal by 1 - 2 years of age to a more slowly progressive and extremely heterogeneous course that causes significant morbidity and mortality in juveniles and adults [ 1 ] .
the infantile course of the disease generally correlates with a complete loss of gaa enzyme activity .
unlike the infantile patients , juvenile and adult - onset patients retain partial levels of gaa enzyme activity .
in these patients disease severity and age of onset do not correlate with residual enzyme activity [ 2 ] .
it is therefore likely that secondary factors or modifiers influence the age of onset and severity of the disease in the juvenile and adult - onset patients [ 1 ] .
one factor that could influence the course of pompe disease is the level of the glucose transporter 4 ( glut4 ) .
an increase in glut4 could potentially result in increased glucose uptake in muscle and consequent increased glycogen accumulation in lysosomes .
when muscle biopsies from adult - onset patients were immunostained with an antibody for glut4 only the vacuolated glycogen storing muscle fibers showed intense staining for glut4 [ 3 ] .
a similar increase in glut4 has been reported in the gaa - / - mouse model for pompe disease [ 4 ] .
to our knowledge knockdown of glut4 in gaa - / - mice to determine whether elevated glut4 causes glycogen accumulation or whether elevated glut4 is a consequence of glycogen accumulation has not been reported .
to determine whether other factors in addition to glut4 are dysregulated and may contribute to disease severity , we have examined several of the components involved in glycogen biosynthesis and degradation in gaa - / - mice .
unintuitively , many of the steps were dysregulated in a manner that would likely lead to increased glycogen storage .
if the dysregulation in glycogen metabolism observed in the mouse model of pompe disease also occurs in pompe patients , it may contribute to the observed broad spectrum of disease severity .
results glycogen is not reduced in gaa - / - mice lacking s6k1 or s6k2 we have previously shown that inhibiting mtorc1 with rapamycin abates glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle of pompe mice [ 5 ] .
however , the therapeutic potential of rapamycin for pompe disease is limited because rapamycin is also an immunomodulatory agent .
it is possible that inhibiting other signaling components in the mtorc1 pathway may prove less immune suppressive and also inhibit glycogen accumulation .
as a first step to decipher which components of the mtorc1 pathway might be responsible for rapamycin 's ability to inhibit glycogen accumulation , we investigated the s6k1 and s6k2 kinases , which are immediately downstream of and can be phosphorylated by mtorc1 [ 6 ] .
for this purpose , knockout mice for s6k1 ( s6k1 - / - ) and s6k2 ( s6k2 - / - ) were crossed to pompe mice to give the double knockouts ( gaa - / - x s6k1 - / - ) and ( gaa - / - x s6k2 - / - ) .
quantitation of glycogen levels in the heart , quadriceps and triceps from 3 - 4 month old wild type c57bl / 6 , s6k1 - / - , s6k2 - / - , gaa - / - , gaa - / - x s6k2 - / - , and gaa - / - x s6k1 - / - mice revealed that deleting the genes for s6k1 or s6k2 did not abate the extent of glycogen accumulation noted in pompe mice ( fig. 1 ) .
histologic examination of muscle sections stained with pas to visualize glycogen qualitatively confirmed these biochemical results ( data not shown ) .
thus , the s6k1 and s6k2 kinases do not appear to influence muscle glycogen accumulation in the pompe mouse .
since these double knockouts constitute two additional strains of mice deficient in gaa , they have been used in subsequent studies to evaluate the status of specific components of the glycogen metabolic pathway .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0056181.g001 figure 1 glycogen is not reduced in gaa - / - mice lacking s6k1 and s6k2 .

phosphorylase is dysregulated in gaa - / - mice muscle glycogen phosphorylase is one of several enzymes involved in the catabolism of cytoplasmic glycogen .
it exists in two forms , the active phosphorylated form ( ph - a ) and an inactive unphosphorylated form ( ph - b ) .
ph - b is only active in the presence of high concentrations of amp .
the ratio of ph - a to ph - b is relevant in pompe disease because gaa , the other primary enzyme capable of degrading glycogen , is deficient .
a situation in which both enzymes that are capable of degrading glycogen are lacking or inactive could result in increased glycogen accumulation .
this dynamic appears to exist in gaa - / - mice , as phosphorylase has been reported to be predominantly in the inactive ph - b form in muscle [ 7 ] .
the generation of additional gaa - / - mouse strains allowed us the opportunity to determine if a reduction in phosphorylase activity is a common feature of gaa deficient mice .
figure 2 shows that in the absence of amp , phosphorylase activity is greatly reduced in gaa - / - , gaa - / - x s6k1 - / - , and gaa - / - x s6k2 - / - mice compared to mice with normal levels of gaa ( c57bl / 6 , s6k1 - / - , s6k2 - / - ) .
the origin of these differences did not appear to be due to differences in absolute phosphorylase levels , since all strains had similar phosphorylase activity when amp was included in the assay .
it has been suggested that elevated glycogen levels may activate the phosphatase that converts ph - a to ph - b [ 7 ] , but the details of such an activation process are not clear , especially given the different compartmentalization of phosphorylase and glycogen .
thus , together with the above glycogen results ( fig. 1 ) , these results suggest that knockout of gaa leads not only to enhanced glycogen accumulation as expected , but also to a very significant decrease in the basal activity of muscle phosphorylase .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0056181.g002 figure 2 amp - dependent phosphorylase activity is reduced in gaa - / - mice .

glycogen synthase is dysregulated in gaa - / - mice and is normalized by rhgaa treatment phosphorylase and glycogen synthase activities are normally coordinately regulated in a reciprocal manner .
given the above results with phosphorylase , glycogen synthase ( gs ) levels and activity in heart , triceps , quadriceps , and liver of sv129 mice together with the strains described in fig. 1 were surveyed qualitatively by western blot analysis with antibodies specific to muscle gs and liver gs. figure 3a shows that compared to the gaa +/+ strains , gs levels are elevated in heart , triceps , and quadriceps of all three gaa - / - strains .
the most dramatic gs elevation was observed in heart .
interestingly , the levels of liver gs were not altered by knocking out gaa .
figure 3b shows that associated with the increases in absolute gs levels there was a concomitant increase in the amounts of phosphorylated gs in the muscles but not the liver of gaa - / - mouse strains .
glycogen synthase can be inactivated by phosphorylation .
however , as we show below , the large increases in gs levels shown here are also accompanied by very significant increases in gs activity .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0056181.g003 figure 3 muscle glycogen synthase protein is elevated in gaa - / - mice .
tissue lysates were prepared for the indicated tissues from each mouse strain .
lysates from 5 mice were pooled and 100 microg of protein from the pooled lysate was analyzed by western blot analysis .
all of the blots were probed with an anti - gapdh antibody (~ 37 kda in all panels ) to verify equal protein loading of all the test samples .
( a ) an anti - muscle glycogen synthase antibody was used to probe the blots containing samples from the heart , triceps , and quad .
an anti - liver glycogen synthase antibody was used to probe the blot containing samples from the liver .
( b ) an anti - phospho - glycogen synthase ( ser641 ) antibody was used to probe the blots for phosphorylated gs .
( c ) glycogen synthase transcript levels are not elevated in gaa - / - mice compared to wild type animals .
rna was isolated from triceps and heart of c57bl / 6 and gaa - / - mice and probed with qpcr primers as described under " experimental procedures. " values shown are means +/ - sem .
figure 3c shows that there were no significant differences in gs mrna transcript levels in the heart and triceps of wild type c57bl / 6 and gaa - / - mice .
there are no differences in gs mrna levels in quadriceps between wild type c57bl / 6 and gaa - / - mice ( data not shown ) .
the increases in gs protein and phosphoprotein noted above ( fig. 3a,b ) could be due to differential degradation of the protein in the different mouse strains rather than to its synthesis .
figure 4 gives additional details on gs levels and activity in gaa - / - mouse strains and the effects on cardiac muscle of treating these strains with recombinant human gaa ( rhgaa ) .
four weekly doses of rhgaa ( at 100 mg / kg ) essentially normalized the hyper - elevated ( up to 50 - fold ) gs levels seen in heart as assessed by western blot both qualitatively ( fig. 4a ) and quantitatively ( fig. 4b ) .
consistent with this treatment effect on gs levels , treatment also normalized the elevated (~ 20 fold ) cardiac gs activity ( fig. 4c ) and (> 100 fold ) glycogen levels ( fig. 4d ) .
a similar analysis of triceps treated with rhgaa , showed that gs levels and activity were also dramatically reduced in this muscle , although perhaps not to the same extent as noted in the heart ( figures 5a - c ) .
consistent with this reduction in gs , glycogen levels in triceps was also greatly reduced , but not completely cleared ( fig. 5d ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0056181.g004 figure 4 rhgaa treatment normalizes glycogen synthase protein and activity levels in heart of gaa - / - mice .
groups ( n = 5 ) of 3 to 4 - month old mice of the indicated strains were dosed with rhgaa ( 100 mg / kg ) weekly for 4 weeks by tail vein injection .
muscle homogenates were prepared , pooled and analyzed by : ( a ) western blot using an anti - gs antibody and ( b ) densitometry analysis of the western blots ( with gs normalized to gapdh ). , samples were also processed for measurements of ( c ) glycogen synthase activity ( d ) tissue glycogen levels .

10.1371 / journal.pone.0056181.g005 figure 5 rhgaa treatment reduces glycogen synthase protein and activity levels in triceps of gaa - / - mice .
triceps were analyzed as described in the legend to figure 4 .
taken together , these results strongly suggest that glycogen synthase levels and activity are dramatically upregulated in the skeletal and cardiac muscles of the pompe ( gaa - / - ) phenotype , consistent with the coordinate and reciprocal down regulation of phosphorylase shown above ( fig. 2 ) .
especially given the absence of lysosomal acid alpha glucosidase ( gaa ) in the pompe mouse , the status of the phosphorylase / synthase balance shown here would be expected to increase glycogen storage further and exacerbate any glycogen - driven pathophysiologic effects .
g6p and hexokinase activity are elevated in gaa - / - mice and is reduced by rhgaa treatment hexokinase phosphorylates glucose to give g6p .
g6p is an allosteric activator of gs and could be contributing to the dramatic gs activity increases in heart and tricep ( figs. 4 , 5 ) .
g6p levels were compared in heart and triceps from wild type ( c57bl / 6 ) and gaa - / - mice ( fig. 6a ) .
in gaa - / - mice g6p is elevated 20 - fold in heart and 60 - fold in triceps compared to wild type mice .
at these levels , g6p could cause phosphorylated gs to become active and result in greater glycogen biosynthesis .
hexokinase activity is also elevated in gaa - / - mice compared to wild type ( c57bl / 6 ) ( fig. 6b ) .
the high levels of g6p are likely due to increased hexokinase activity in combination with glut4 , the predominant glucose transporter in the heart and skeletal muscle , which is reportedly elevated in both pompe patients and gaa - / - mice [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] .
importantly , as with gs , rhgaa treatment reduces levels of g6p and hexokinase in the heart and triceps .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0056181.g006 figure 6 g6p ( a ) and hexokinase ( b ) levels are elevated in gaa - / - mice compared to wild type ( c57 / bl6 ) and reduced by rhgaa treatment .
gaa - / - mice were dosed with rhgaa as described in the legend to figure 4 .
g6p and hexokinase was quantified in heart and triceps homogenates from the strains indicated .

data was analyzed by one - way anova followed by newman - keuls comparing groups .

glycogenin is dysregulated in gaa - / - mice and normalized by rhgaa treatment in the presence of udp - glucose and mn2 + , the glycogenin homodimer self - glycosylates and attaches 7 - 11 glucose residues to a single tyrosine residue [ 8 ] .
gs then uses this short glucose polymer as a primer to initiate glycogen synthesis .
it has been reported that knockdown of glycogenin mrna levels using short hairpin ribonucleic acids in primary myotubes from gaa - / - mice decreases both cytoplasmic and lysosomal glycogen accumulation [ 9 ] .
a comparison of muscle glycogenin mrna or protein levels between wild type mice and gaa - / - mice has not been reported .
tissue lysates from wild type and gaa - / - mouse triceps muscle were examined by western blot with a monoclonal antibody specific to muscle glycogenin ( fig. 7 , a - c ) .
triceps from gaa +/+ strains showed predominant bands ranging between 40 - 60 kda in molecular weight .
in contrast , triceps from gaa - / - mouse strains revealed a much more intense and diffuse signal from 30 - 100 kda , indicating that glycogenin is more heterogeneous and likely upregulated in gaa - / - mice .
to ask to what extent this glycogenin heterogeneity was due to attached glycogen , samples were also treated with amyloglucosidase to cleave glycogen covalently attached to glycogenin .
figure 7b shows that this treatment resulted in only a marginal reduction in the heterogeneity of glycogenin suggesting that covalently attached glycogen is not responsible for the observed differences in glycogenin between wild type and gaa - / - mice .
regardless of the origin of this heterogenity , when gaa - / - mice were treated with rhgaa , the molecular form of glycogenin was restored to that of wild type mice , at least as assessed by western blot analysis ( fig. 7c ) .

discussion to date , only a few molecular aspects of the glycogen metabolic pathway in pompe disease have been investigated in detail .
for example , it has been reported that glut4 is elevated in both pompe patients and gaa - / - mice [ 3 ] .
in this report , we confirmed [ 7 ] that phosphorylase activity is suppressed in gaa - / - mouse muscle , and further demonstrated that gs , g6p , hexokinase , and glycogenin are all hyper - elevated .
the dysregulation observed for glut4 , gs , g6p , hexokinase , phosphorylase , and glycogenin in combination with a reported increase in autophagy in pompe disease [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] would appear to comprise an underlying metabolic syndrome .
the molecular entities that comprise this metabolic syndrome are all dysregulated in a manner that would facilitate glycogen biosynthesis and ultimately lead to a greater accumulation of lysosomal glycogen .
it is currently unknown whether these dysregulated components cause glycogen accumulation or if their dysregulation is a consequence of the aberrant accumulation of lysosomal glycogen in pompe disease .
it is likely that the observed increases in gs and autophagy cause glycogen accumulation because suppression of either autophagy or gs alone in gaa - / - mice reduced glycogen by 50 - 60 % and > 90 % , respectively [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] .
the other dysregulated components have not been individually suppressed or elevated in gaa - / - mice , so it is not possible to predict their role in glycogen accumulation .
the large differences in gs levels between gaa - / - and gaa +/+ mouse strains in heart , triceps , and quadriceps were not observed in all muscles .
we have determined that gs levels are similar between gaa - / - and wild type mice in extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles ( data not shown ) .
we have not assessed individual fiber types for gs levels and activity .
the differences observed for glycogenin between wild type and gaa - / - mice were unexpected .
western blot analysis of glycogenin from gaa - / - muscle lysates suggests glycogenin is modified in a way that heterogeneously increases its size .
a better understanding of the role of each of these molecular components of the glycogen pathway will aid the development of a substrate reduction therapy ( srt ) .
the goal of srt for pompe disease is to reduce glycogen transport to the lysosome to a point where residual enzyme or enzyme replacement activity is sufficient to prevent pathologic accumulation .
in addition to the current proposals to suppress gs [ 4 ] , [ 9 ] and autophagy [ 12 ] , our results suggest consideration should also be given to potential srt therapies that might reduce glut4 or g6p or increase phosphorylase activity .
administration of rhgaa to the gaa - / - mice normalized not only muscle glycogen levels but also g6p , hexokinase , gs , and glycogenin levels .
thus , it would appear that correction of one aspect of the glycogen metabolic pathway ( lysosomal glycogen ) results in the correction of multiple other components , viz .
a coordinate correction .
given the response of these other pathway components to the gaa - mediated decrease in lysosomal glycogen , it is also possible that these and other components involved in glycogen biosynthesis and degradation can be used as biomarkers to assess disease progression and response to therapies .
finally , it will be important to determine if the metabolic syndrome described here in the muscle of gaa - / - mice contributes to the observed broad spectrum of disease severity in pompe patients with the same genotype .

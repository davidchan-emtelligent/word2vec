somatic mutations in protein kinases ( pks ) are frequent driver events in many human tumors , while germ - line mutations are associated with hereditary diseases .
here we present kin - driver , the first database that compiles driver mutations in pks with experimental evidence demonstrating their functional role .
kin - driver is a manual expert - curated database that pays special attention to activating mutations ( ams ) and can serve as a validation set to develop new generation tools focused on the prediction of gain - of - function driver mutations .
it also offers an easy and intuitive environment to facilitate the visualization and analysis of mutations in pks .
because all mutations are mapped onto a multiple sequence alignment , analogue positions between kinases can be identified and tentative new mutations can be proposed for studying by transferring annotation .
finally , our database can also be of use to clinical and translational laboratories , helping them to identify uncommon ams that can correlate with response to new antitumor drugs .
the website was developed using php and javascript , which are supported by all major browsers ; the database was built using mysql server .
kin - driver is available at : http :// kin - driver.leloir.org.ar / introduction cancer arises due to somatic mutations that result in a growth advantage for the tumor cells .
these mutations are known as ' drivers' and can be divided into two groups : ( i ) ' loss - of - function ' mutations , which inactivate tumor suppressor genes ( from here on ' inactivating mutations ') and ( ii ) ' activating ' or ' gain - of - function ' mutations that transform proto - oncogenes into oncogenes .
somatic mutations in protein kinases ( pks ) are frequent driver events in many human tumor types and functionally relevant germ - line mutations are associated with hereditary disorders .
clinical laboratories worldwide are analysing thousands of human tumor samples , looking for activating mutations ( ams ) in certain pks - - such as egfr , her2 or braf - - that correlate with good responses to new generations of antitumor drugs that are kinase inhibitors .
mutations either new or not functionally characterized are often found .
in addition , whole - genomic sequencing of human malignancies and other diseases is identifying thousands of changes in pks , but most of them are likely to be passenger mutations or even polymorphisms .
discriminating driver mutations in pks is a significant challenge that is hampered by the fact that there are no curated sets of true driver and passenger alterations .
the extent of this challenge was evidenced when three state - of - the - art methods , namely mutationassessor ( 1 ) , transfitc ( 2 ) and fathmm ( 3 ) , were fed with well - established , tumor - associated ams of pks and failed to predict them as high impact or disease related ( 4 ) .
therefore , it is uncertain that the current tools , which are generally based on conservation calculations , can be trusted to screen whole - genome sequencing data in search of driver mutations in pks .
new methods need to be developed and unambiguously assessed datasets of driver mutations are required to train and test them .
methods mutation recruitment recruitment procedure is described by molina - vila et al .
( 4 ) .
briefly , in the case of proto - oncogenic kinases , abstracts and titles of pubmed manuscripts were mined with the kinase name , plus words ' activating ' , ' gain of function ' or ' constitutive activation ' .
for tumor suppressor kinases , the words ' inactivating ' and ' loss of function ' were used .
furthermore , all uniprot entries for human kinases were mined for the same keywords to identify new variants .
the references were manually checked to confirm its status .
for each annotated mutation , all samples with that mutation were retrieved from cosmic using the biomart perl api .
msa construction human stk and tks domains were obtained from pfam families pf00069 and pf07714 , respectively .
to account for classification problems in pfam families , some sequences incorrectly classified as tk were moved from this alignment to the corresponding one and realigned with t - coffee ( 5 ) .
for each msa , a sequence logo was calculated using seq2logo ( 6 ) .
mutation relative frequency calculation a relative frequency was computationally calculated for all mutations of the 518 pks of the cosmic database release 70 ( 7 ) as the frequency of mutation in cosmic for that gene times 1000 over the total number of tumor samples sequenced for that gene .
all mutations with a relative frequency above 2 ( 0.2 %) were then checked in pubmed by introducing the name of the mutation ( e.g. p267r ) and added to the dataset if they were found to have functional effects .
egfr mutations conferring a response rate to erlotinib higher than 50 % , according to the egfr somatic mutations database ( http :// www.somaticmutations - egfr.info /) , were also added .
results kin - driver database offers a comprehensive set of 560 primary ams in the kinase and justamembrane ( jm ) domains of 39 pks and 83 inactivating mutations in 5 kinases compiled by a two - step systematic search for each of the 518 pks present in the ' complete kinase ' study of the cosmic database ( 7 ) ( release 70 ) .
only primary mutations with experimental evidence demonstrating their activating / inactivating role were included .
kin - driver is a mysql relational database offering structural and sequence data cross - referenced with cosmic and with our set of curated mutations .
it also provides the frequencies of these mutations in actual tumor samples .
the cosmicmart service is used to fetch the data , so frequencies for new mutations can easily be added and data are kept up to date with the periodic cosmic releases .
our database can be interrogated by protein name , gene name or keyword , amino acid position or specific mutation name ( i.e. t790m ) .
range or specific mutations can also be used to look for driver mutations in other pks in equivalent positions ( see later ) .
finally , the database can be browsed by pk name , domain , tissue or type of histology , and these last two attributes obtained from the corresponding mutated samples are available in the cosmic database .
each individual mutation in kin - driver is displayed with its validation status (' activating ' , ' inactivating ' or ' unknown ') , the mutation type ( missense , insertion , deletion , nonsense , frameshift or indel ) , its absolute and relative frequencies in human tumors and the pubmed reference describing that particular mutation as activating / inactivating .
mutations can also be visualized in a multiple sequence alignment ( msa ) , placing on top the protein of interest and highlighting the mutation ( figure 1 ) .
the pk sequences are classified into one of the two families : tyrosine kinases ( tks , e.c number : 2.7.10 .
- classification ) and serine / threonine kinases ( stk , e.c number 2.7.11. - ) .
each family has its own msa .
the boundaries of the kinase domains are those defined either by pfam ( 8 ) or uniprot ( 9 ) .
the three - dimensional structure of the protein ( when available ) marking the mutated position is also shown ( figure 2a ) .
as an example , the output of kin - driver for mutation egfr e746 - a750del is presented in figures 1 and 2 .

snapshot of the kin - driver egfr e746 - a750del output .
( a ) mutation egfr e746 - a750del mapped onto the structure of the selected human egfr ( pdb code 1m14 ) .
other structures can be chosen for mapping .
( b ) location of the mutation in a cmap plot ( n = 13 ) .
in case the user challenges kin - driver with a particular mutation or position that is not described as activating / inactivating in our dataset , our server retrieves if there is an activating / inactivating mutation in any other human kinase in an equivalent position ( based on the msa alignment ) .
for example , human egfr in position 724 has no mutation described , but alk has one am in the equivalent position g1128a .
another interesting feature of kin - driver is that it incorporates the recent finding that ams are not randomly distributed within the kinase domain , but cluster in relatively short ' hyper - mutated ' segments ( hss ) ( 4 ) .
in the case of tks , our server shows the location of the mutation or position interrogated in a central moving average plot ( cmap ) , allowing users to inspect whether it is located within a hs ( figure 2b ) .
the cmap is calculated by adding columnwise all the relative frequencies of all mutations mapped in the msa obtaining a value per column of the alignment .
then , for each position of the msa , an average of these values is calculated using a windows size n = 13 ( figure 1 ) .
newly discovered mutations , or those of yet unknown effects , that are located within one of the hss can be suspected to be activating .
therefore , they might be worth further analysis or , if they affect a druggable kinase , might predict a good response to the corresponding antitumor drug ( 10 , 11 ) .
finally , the possibility to browse kin - driver by tissue and histology is also of interest .
first , it allows making instant comparisons .
for example , it reveals that hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors show the highest frequency of ams ( 33.25 %) , followed by lung ( 11.96 %) .
for lung tumors , the more frequently mutated kinase is egfr , with 61 of the 95 described ams .
second , this kind of browsing can be useful to clinical laboratories ; when confronted with a tumor sample , they can use kin - driver to find the genes affected by actionable mutations in this particular type of neoplasia , and they can subsequently direct their efforts to the analysis of those genes .
although mutational data on pks are currently cataloged in several databases ( 7 , 12 - 14 ) , they do not discriminate passengers from drivers .
kin - driver is unique in offering a curated functional annotation , supported by experimental data .
also , the possibility of transferring the mutation to equivalent positions in homologous proteins through an msa and the mapping into the desired protein structure with the jsmol app ( 15 ) are unique features of our database .
in contrast , cosmic ( 7 ) is the most comprehensive compilation of somatic mutations , but no functional status is given , no equivalences between pks can be inferred , nor the position in the structure is shown .
prokino ( 12 ) provides a kinase ontology and integrates basic mutational data ( as recruited from cosmic ) with other types of data , but they do not offer functional or structural information .
mokca and canpredict ( 13 , 14 ) offer a prediction of ' cancer - associated ' mutations , but it is not based on experimental evidence and the pictures of the mutations in the protein structures are static .
finally , kinmutbase ( 16 ) has no information on activation status and is outdated .
conclusions to the best of our knowledge , kin - driver is the first comprehensive curated dataset of driver mutations in human cancer .
it compiles data otherwise disseminated in several databases that offer poor functional information and in hundreds of articles describing the effects of one or a few mutations each .
our database can be used as a gold standard to develop and validate new bioinformatics methods to predict driver mutations .
second , it sets an easy and intuitive environment for the visualization and analysis of mutations in pks. and third , it can help researchers and clinicians to recognize relevant mutations in human malignancies .

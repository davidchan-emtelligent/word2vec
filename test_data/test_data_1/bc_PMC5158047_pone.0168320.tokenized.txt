the pathology of proliferative vitreoretinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy is linked to proliferation , migration , and adhesion of the retinal pigment epithelium .
microrna - 34a ( mir - 34a ) expression modulates changes in proliferation and migration of retinal pigment epithelial cell line arpe - 19 .
in this study , we determined that mir - 34a interacts with lgr4 , identified by bioinformatics using targetscan human 5.0 , to affect these changes .
double luciferase gene reporter assay confirmed mir - 34a involvement in mediating control .
mir - 34a mimic transfection decreased lgr4 expression .
western blot analysis documented corresponding protein expression inhibition .
mts , ki67 immunostaining , scratch and transwell testing , along with attachment assay showed that mir - 34a upregulation inhibited arpe - 19 cell proliferation , migration and attachment partly through downregulation of lgr4 protein expression .
western blot analysis revealed that both mir - 34a upregulation and lgr4 downregulation induced declines in e2f1 , p - cdc2 , cdk2 , cdk4 and cdk6 protein expression .
taken together , mir - 34a gene expression upregulation inhibits arpe - 19 cell proliferation , migration and adhesion partly by suppressing lgr4 expression .
these results substantiate earlier indications that both mir - 34a and lgr4 are potential drug targets to prevent fibrosis in a clinical setting .

introduction micrornas ( mirnas ) are non - protein - coding , short ( 20 - 25 ) nucleotide rnas that regulate expression of at least 30 % of all genes. [ 1,2 ] mirna - protein complexes bind to the 3 ' - untranslated region of their target mrnas , leading to inhibition of translation or destabilization of the target mrnas. [ 2 - 4 ] mir - 34a , a gene product of chromosomal locus 1p36.23 , is a tumor suppressor in many types of tumors. [ 5 ] this mirna is the focus of many research endeavors to better understand regulatory mechanisms of cell proliferation and migration .
one of the findings showed that the mir - 34 family are targets of the p53 oncogene family. [ 6 ] in mammals , the mir - 34 family contains three processed mirnas with mir - 34a being ubiquitously expressed. [ 5 ] the other two , mir - 34b and mir - 34c share a common primary transcript and are mainly expressed in the lungs. [ 5 ] mir - 34a expression is particularly pronounced in the cns system and implicated in controlling cell proliferation , cell cycle arrest and senescence. [ 5,7 ] the identified target genes of mir - 34a include silent information regulator 1 ( sirt1 ) , bcl - 2 , cd44 , c - met , various cyclins and cdks , and the proto - oncoproteins myc , mycn amongst numerous others. [ 5,8 ] the retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ) is composed of a monolayer of hexagonal cells that are quiescent and do not undergo proliferation and migration under normal conditions .
following breaching of the blood retinal barrier by injury , rpe exposure to blood borne cytokines can cause the cells to differentiate into a fibroblastic phenotype .
the proliferative and migratory changes are followed by expression of alpha - smooth muscle actin ( alpha - sma ) contractile proteins leading to pathologic conditions including proliferative vitreoretinopathy ( pvr ) , age - related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. [ 9 ] altered mirna expression affects target genes responsible for changes in the phenotype of arpe - 19 cell , a human retinal epithelial cell line .
one of the mirna changes includes variations in mir - 124 expression which affect epithelial mesenchymal transition ( emt ).[ 10 ] mir - 124 was downregulated in transforming growth factor - beta1 ( tgf - beta1 ) induced emt process in retinal pigment epithelium .
furthermore , mir - 124 inversely regulated tgf - beta1 - induced emt in arpe - 19 cells. [ 10 ] in another study employing arpe - 19 cells , mir - 29b also inversely regulated tgf - beta1 and emt and arpe - 19 transition. [ 11 ] we reported recently that mir - 34a is one of the regulators highly expressed in post - confluent rpe cells .
its regulatory function was confirmed by showing that mir - 34a upregulation inhibits rpe cell proliferation and migration through directly or indirectly suppressing the expression of c - met and other cell cycle - related molecules. [ 8 ] lgr4 ( leucine rich repeat containing g protein - coupled receptor 4 ) , also known as gpr48 ( g protein - coupled receptor 48 ) , is a member of the g protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) family. [ 12 - 15 ] the role of lgr4 in enhancing the aggressiveness of carcinoma as well as developmental derangements such as intrauterine growth retardation or renal development is well documented. [ 16 - 19 ] it has also been verified as a prognostic factor for poor outcome in cancer patients. [ 20 ] in terms of ocular development , we demonstrated that knockout of lgr4 reduced epithelial cell proliferation and migration and resulted in eob ( eye open at birth ) phenotype in mice .
because of failure in eyelid closure , the eyes of mice harboring eob phenotype are open at birth unlike wildtype mice whose eyes are closed at birth but open by 12 to 14 days postpartum. [ 13,15 ] we also found that deletion of lgr4 in mice can cause anterior segment dysgenesis and onset of age - related cataracts. [ 12,14 ] there is , however , no report about the role of lgr4 in the regulation of rpe functional activity .
in this study , we demonstrated that lgr4 is a direct target of mir - 34a .
inhibition of lgr4 expression with a specific sirna suppressed arpe - 19 's proliferative and migratory activity .
transfection with a mir - 34a mimic or sirna targeting lgr4 decreased arpe - 19 cell adhesion .
furthermore , mir - 34a and lgr4 have similar downstream targets involved in mediating control of cell cycle progression .
these include e2f1 , p - cdc2 , cdk2 , cdk4 and cdk6 .
taken together , our results suggest that lgr4 is a direct target of mir - 34a and regulates proliferation , migration and adhesion of arpe - 19 cells .
materials and methods cell culture arpe - 19 , a human retinal epithelial cell line , and human embryonic kidney 293 cells ( hek293 ) were purchased from american type culture collection ( atcc ; manassas , va ) .

the primers used for this purpose are : forward 5 ' - cagtgtgctaaatcaatagcaaaccaccgtcactattagttattctg and reverse 5 ' - cagaataactaatagtgacggtggtttgctattgatttagcacactg .
hek293 is a cell line widely used to perform dual luciferase assay to investigate the activation / inhibition of many signal pathways such as wnt , nf - kappab , tgf - beta , as well as the validation of direct interaction between mirnas and their targets .
in this study , hek293 cells in 96 - well plates were co - transfected with prl - sv40 vector ( promega , madison , wt ) , which contains renilla luciferase , and pmir - report vector containing the firefly luciferase .
for each transfection , 100 nm negative control mirna ( genepharma , shanghai , china ) or a mir - 34a mimic molecule ( genepharma ) was co - transfected with the reporter constructs using lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .

ki67 positive cells are expressed as percentages based on the number of ki67 positive cells in three random visual fields divided by the number of dapi positive cells .
transwell migration assays 100 nm lgr4 sirna , nc or mock was introduced into arpe - 19 cells grown to approximately 60 % confluence .
after 48 hours , trypsin was used to detach the cells , which were washed once with d - hank 's solution ( invitrogen ) .
2 x 104 cells were added into the upper chambers of the transwell that is separated with the lower chambers by a 8 - mum pore size culture insert ( transwell ; costar ) .
400 mul of dmem - f12 containing 10 % fbs were added into the lower chambers .
the transwell was placed at 37degreesc in a 5 % co2 atmosphere to allow the cells to migrate into the lower chambers .
after 18 hours , the migrated cells were stained with crystal violet and observed under microscope ( zeiss ) using a 20x objective .
to further quantify the migration potential , cells in 5 random vision fields were counted .
in vitro scratch assay 100 nm lgr4 sirna , nc or mock was introduced into arpe - 19 cells at approximately 60 % confluence .
a 200 mul pipette tip was used to scratch the monolayer when the cells reached confluence after 48 hours .
after removing floating cells with hank 's medium , cells were then cultured in 2 ml fresh serum free medium .

cells lysates were harvested after 72 hours and proteins were detected as previously described. [ 8 ] cdk2 , cdk4 , cdk6 , p - cdc2 ( threonine 161 ) and e2f1 antibodies were purchased from cell signaling technology ( beverly , ma ) .

p < 0.05 was considered significant .
results lgr4 is a direct target of mir - 34a to predict potential mir - 34a target genes , targetscan ( http :// www.targetscan.org ) was used .
one region in the 3 ' - utr of lgr4 was identified as a binding site for mir - 34a .
to confirm mir - 34a directly targets lgr4 , the wildtype 3 ' - utr of lgr4 was cloned into a luciferase reporter vector .
this vector was transfected into hek293 cells along with mir - 34a or a negative control ( nc ) .
luciferase activity assays 24 hours after transfection demonstrated that mir - 34a reduced luciferase activity to 57 +/ - 11 % of the negative control transfection , whereas mutation of the target site abolished the reduction of luciferase activity induced by mir - 34a ( fig 1a ) .
to further validate that mir - 34a directly regulates the expression of lgr4 in arpe - 19 cells , we performed western blot analysis .
lgr4 expression was significantly decreased 72 hours after transfection of mir - 34a into arpe - 19 cells .
the band density indicated a 53 +/ - 8 % inhibition of lgr4 after introduction of mir - 34a ( fig 1b ) .
these data confirm that lgr4 is a direct target gene of mir - 34a .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0168320.g001 fig 1 lgr4 is a direct target of mir - 34a .
( a ) hek293 cells were co - transfected with mir - 34a , pmir - lgr4 3 ' - utr or pmir - lgr4 3 ' - utr - mut , along with a prl - sv40 reporter plasmid .

lgr4 downregulation inhibits cell proliferation as lgr4 overexpression promotes proliferation , migration and invasion of some cancer cell lines , we sought to determine if its downregulation can negatively impact arpe - 19 cells. [ 17 ] transfection of arpe - 19 cells with a specific lgr4 sirna significantly reduced lgr4 protein level after 72 hours ( fig 2a ) .
based on the mts cell proliferation assay and ki67 immunostaining results , lgr4 sirna significantly inhibited growth of arpe - 19 cells three days after transfection ( fig 2b and 2c ) .
relative to the mock transfected group , cell proliferation was decreased to 40 +/ - 8 % five days after being transfected with lgr4 sirna .
on the other hand , in the mock transfected group , proliferation remained the same .
similarly , the results shown in fig 2c indicate that transfection of a lgr4 specific sirna or a mir - 34a mimic dramatically reduced arpe - 19 ki67 staining .
ki67 positive cells were 39 +/ - 16 % and 26 +/ - 15 % in lgr4 sirna and mir - 34a transfected cells , respectively , whereas they were 85 +/ - 8 % and 81 +/ - 3 % , respectively , in the mock and nc groups ( fig 2d ) .
these results show that there is a direct relationship between decreases in lgr4 expression and arpe - 19 cell proliferation .

downregulation of lgr4 attenuates cell migratory activity mir - 34a inhibits both arpe - 19 cell proliferation and migration. [ 8 ] since lgr4 is a target gene of mir - 34a , we sought to confirm that lgr4 knockdown by itself has the same effect on arpe - 19 .
accordingly , transwell and scratch wound assays were performed on lgr4 specific sirna transfected arpe - 19 cells .
in the transwell assay , much fewer lgr4 specific sirna transfected cells migrated to the lower chamber ( mock : 59 +/ - 12 , nc : 62 +/ - 10 , sirna : 25 +/ - 6 cells / vision field , n = 3 , p < 0.05 , fig 3a ) .
similarly , fewer lgr4 specific sirna transfected cells migrated into the gap between the leading edges of the wound compared with those appearing in plates containing mock transfected and nc cells ( 48 hours : mock : 236 +/ - 64 , nc : 191 +/ - 37 , sirna : 105 +/ - 15 cells / vision field ; 72 hours : mock : 621 +/ - 48 , nc : 555 +/ - 39 , sirna : 303 +/ - 36 cells / vision field ; n = 3 , p < 0.05 ) ( fig 3b and 3c ) .
thus , downregulation of lgr4 inhibits migration of arpe - 19 cells .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0168320.g003 fig 3 downregulation of lgr4 decreases arpe - 19 cell migration .
arpe - 19 cells were transfected with lgr4 specific sirna or a scrambled negative control ( nc ) .
transwell ( a ) and in vitro scratch assays ( b ) were performed to evaluate the arpe - 19 cell migration .
the number of cells that migrated in the transwell assay was quantified by counting the number of cells appearing in the lower chamber in five independent vision fields with a 20x microscope objective .
( c ) for in vitro scratch assay , cells that migrated into the gap were counted at 48 hours and 72 hours as indicated .
results were expressed as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 , * p < 0.05 ) .
all images are representative of at least three independent experiments .

lgr4 knockdown or mir - 34a ectopic expression decreases cell adhesion stress - induced rpe cell detachment from bruch 's membrane is one of the initial steps in the pathogenesis of pvr .
to determine if interactions of mir - 34a with lgr4 affected arpe - 19 adhesion to its substratum , we compared the effects of lgr4 loss of function with those of mir - 34a mimic transfection on this process .
lgr4 knockdown and mir - 34a mimic transfection both significantly decreased arpe - 19 cell attachment ( fig 4a ) .
to quantitate these declines , the mts assay was performed in parallel on these two groups of cells ( fig 4b ) .
the absorbances at 490 nm for the sirna group and mir - 34a transfected cells were much lower compared with mock and nc groups ( mock : 0.72 +/ - 0.08 , nc : 0.73 +/ - 0.12 , sirna : 0.55 +/ - 0.11 , mir - 34a : 0.41 +/ - 0.06 ) .
these results suggest that there is an inverse relationship between mir - 34a expression and arpe - 19 adhesion since mir - 34a induced suppression of lgr4 expression inhibited adhesion .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0168320.g004 fig 4 mir - 34a expression or lgr4 knockdown attenuates arpe - 19 adhesion .
forty - eight hours after transfection with either a mir - 34a , a lgr4 specific sirna or a negative control ( nc ) , arpe - 19 cells were harvested and re - seeded for 2 hours , and then unattached cells were removed by rinsing with pbs .
( a ) the phase - contrast images of attached cells were captured with an attached camera .
images represent those obtained in three independent experiments .
scale bar : 100 mum .
( b ) attached cells were quantitated with the mts assay .
data were expressed as mean +/ - sd of results from three independent experiments with each repeated in triplicates .

knockdown of lgr4 downregulates the expression of cell cycle - related mediators we further explored if direct knockdown of lgr4 had similar effects on the expression or activation of downstream effectors of mir - 34a. [ 8 ] western blot analysis showed that lgr4 sirna transfection suppressed expression of e2f1 , phosphorylated - cdc2 ( p - cdc2 ) , cdk2 , cdk4 and cdk6 compared with mock or nc group , similar to effects caused by mir - 34a mimic transfection ( fig 5a ) .
the band density was quantified with imagej software and normalized to the level of beta - actin ( fig 5b ) .
these results are in accordance with others showing that increase in mir - 34a expression suppresses proliferation by inhibiting lgr4 expression .
this inhibitory effect of mir - 34a on proliferation is consistent with the declines in the expression of the above - mentioned cell cycle mediators .
there is , however , inconsistency in the extent to which these genes are inhibited by mir - 34a as compared with our previous results ,[ 8 ] especially for e2f1 , p - cdc2 and cdk6 .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0168320.g005 fig 5 knockdown of lgr4 downregulates the expression of cell cycle - related molecules reminiscent of mir - 34a mimic transfection .
( a ) after transfection with either lgr4 specific sirna or mir - 34a mimic , arpe - 19 cell lysates were prepared and probed with anti - lgr4 , e2f1 , p - cdc2 , cdk2 , cdk4 and cdk6 antibodies .
beta - actin was probed as a loading control .
these results are representative of at least three independent experiments .
( b ) the band intensity was measured with imagej software .
the densitometric ratio between proteins of interest and beta - actin was calculated and then normalized to the expression level in mock - treated cell .
results were expressed as mean +/ - sd ( n = 3 , * p < 0.05 ) .
discussion previously , we have shown that mir - 34a modulates proliferation and migration of arpe - 19 cells through changes c - met expression. [ 8 ] mir - 34a upregulation suppressed c - met expression which led to declines in arpe - 19 cell proliferation and migration .
in the current study , lgr4 was identified as another direct target gene of mir - 34a whose modulation controls arpe - 19 cell proliferation , migration and adhesion .
as with c - met , increases in mir - 34a expression suppressed both lgr4 expression levels and arpe - 19 cell proliferation and migration .
we further showed that mir - 34a mimic transfection also inhibited attachment .
this study again demonstrates that one specific mirna can modulate cellular responses through control of numerous target genes .
the rpe forms part of the blood retinal barrier and serves multiple functions needed for normal vision .
this quiescent monolayer reduces impinging retinal light intensity , maintains a homeostatic milieu for retinal function in the subretinal environment and re - isomerizes trans - retinal to 11 - cis - retinal needed for photo transduction by the photoreceptors. [ 21 ] on the other hand , following breaching of the blood retinal barrier by injury , rpe cells can be exposed to blood borne cytokines and gain proliferative and migratory potential in pathological conditions. [ 9 ] rpe cells are the most important cells involved in the occurrence of pvr. [ 22 ] uncontrolled proliferation and migration of rpe cells eventually form pathologic membranes on both surfaces of the neural retina that can contract and cause retinal detachment and visual impairment. [ 22 ] in this study , we used the arpe - 19 cell line to investigate the potential role of lgr4 in rpe cells .
arpe - 19 cells express the retinal pigment epithelium - specific 65 kd protein ( rpe65 ) and cellular retinaldehyde - binding protein ( cralbp ) .
they are also the most popular cell line in rpe cell research. [ 23 ] numerous studies use arpe - 19 cell line as a model to analyze the molecular and genomic properties of rpe under pathological conditions , in order to develop new approaches to treatment of ophthalmological diseases. [ 24 ] to the best of our knowledge , this study is the first one to present a functional role lgr4 in arpe - 19 cells .
lgr4 is widely expressed in multiple organs such as heart , lung , intestines , kidneys , cartilage , reproductive tracts and the nervous system. [ 25 ] it is essential for normal embryonic development because studies with knockout mice identified a wide variety of developmental defects. [ 26 ] specifically , lgr4 is normally expressed in a spatiotemporal pattern in the developing eye. by e12.5 , lgr4 is primarily expressed in a layer of mesenchymal cells between the ocular surface and the optic cup. [ 14 ] neonatal mice retain strong expression in the ciliary body , iris stroma , lens and the corneal endothelial and epithelial cells. [ 14 ] in addition to the embryonic lethality previously shown , lgr4 - / - mice had multiple ocular defects including microphthalmia , partial corneal opacity , anterior segment dysgenesis , keratopathies , eye open at birth and early onset cataract formation. [ 14 ] lgr4 - / - keratinocytes also showed decreased migration and proliferation as a result of egfr inactivation. [ 13,15 ] after confirming lgr4 is a direct target of mir - 34a , we found that lgr4 knockdown inhibited arpe - 19 cell proliferation , migration and adhesion .
mir - 34a mimic transfection also inhibited these responses .
taken together , these results show that the described inverse relationship between changes in mir - 34a and c - met expression also pertains to the effects of variations in mir - 34a on lgr4 expression .
recent studies have shown that lgr4 is highly expressed in several types of cancer including gastric , lung , prostate and colorectal cancer. [ 17,20 ] p27kip1 induced lgr4 upregulation can enhance colon cancer progression and metastasis. [ 19 ] lgr4 promotes prostate tumorigenesis through pi3k / akt signaling pathway. [ 16 ] hsu et al. identified a lgr4 splice variant which encodes a soluble secreted protein that can inhibit lgr4 mediated wnt signaling. [ 27 ] furthermore , a nonsense mutation of lgr4 ( c.376c > t ) has been reported to be strongly associated with low bone marrow density , electrolyte imbalance , reduced testosterone levels and increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. [ 28 ] therefore , identifying regulators of lgr4 expression and activity may have a significant impact in clinical practice .
in summary , lgr4 is a direct target gene of mir - 34a .
mir - 34a upregulation had inverse effects on lgr4 expression as well as inhibiting arpe - 19 proliferation , migration and adhesion .
mir - 34a and lgr4 are potential targets for drug development for treating retinal fibrosis since either mir - 34a mimic transfection or lgr4 sirna downregulation suppressed arpe - 19 cell proliferation , migration and adhesion .

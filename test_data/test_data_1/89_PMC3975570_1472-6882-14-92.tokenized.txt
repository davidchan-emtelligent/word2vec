background this study was designed to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture - like stimulation at baihui ( gv20 ) and dazhui ( gv14 ) acupoints ( ea at acupoints ) following mild cerebral ischemia - reperfusion ( i / r ) injury .
furthermore , we investigated whether brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) - mediated activation of extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) 1 / 2 signaling pathway is involved in the neuroprotection induced by ea at acupoints .
methods rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion ( mcao ) for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 3 d. ea at acupoints was applied 1 d postreperfusion then once daily for 2 consecutive days .
results following the application of ea at acupoints , initiated 1 d postreperfusion , we observed significant reductions in the cerebral infarct area , neurological deficit scores , active caspase - 3 protein expression , and apoptosis in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion .
we also observed markedly upregulated bdnf , phospho - raf - 1 ( praf - 1 ) , phospho - mek1 / 2 ( pmek1 / 2 ) , phospho - erk1 / 2 ( perk1 / 2 ) , phospho - 90 kda ribosomal s6 kinase ( pp90rsk ) , and phospho - bad ( pbad ) expression , and restored neuronal nuclear antigen ( neun ) expression .
pretreatment with the mek1 / 2 inhibitor u0126 abrogated the effects of ea at acupoints on cerebral infarct size , neurological deficits , active caspase - 3 protein , and apoptosis in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion .
pretreatment with u0126 also abrogated the effects of ea at acupoints on pmek1 / 2 , perk1 / 2 , pp90rsk , pbad , and neun expression , but did not influence bdnf and praf - 1 expression .
conclusion overall , our study results indicated that ea at acupoints , initiated 1 d postreperfusion , upregulates bdnf expression to provide bdnf - mediated neuroprotection against caspase - 3 - dependent neuronal apoptosis through activation of the raf - 1 / mek1 / 2 / erk1 / 2 / p90rsk / bad signaling cascade after 3 d of reperfusion in mild mcao .
electroacupuncture brain - derived neurotrophic factor phospho - erk1 / 2 phospho - p90rsk phospho - bad apoptosis background cerebral ischemia - reperfusion ( i / r ) injury produces large amounts of reactive oxygen species , which initiate a series of cellular events and that lead to necrosis and apoptosis [ 1 ] .
in mild transient focal cerebral ischemia , brain infarction can develop and progress in a delayed manner , and become grossly visible after 3 d of reperfusion [ 2,3 ] .
apoptosis , which is dependent on caspase - 3 activation , plays a significant role in the pathology of the delayed infarction and predominates in ischemic neurons during mild focal cerebral ischemia [ 2 - 4 ] .
neurotrophic factors provide neuroprotection against caspase - 3 - dependent apoptosis by activating various signal transduction pathways following cerebral i / r injury [ 5,6 ] .
brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( bdnf ) is a member of the neurotrophin family that plays an important role in neuroplasticity , neuron development , differentiation , and neuronal survival [ 7 - 9 ] .
it binds to the specific tyrosine kinase b ( trkb ) receptor on neurons to activate two major intracellular signal transduction pathways : the phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( pi3k ) and the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathways [ 10 ] .
koh identified that the mapk / extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) 1 / 2 signaling pathway is a critical mediator of neuronal cell survival against apoptosis in a focal cerebral ischemia model in rats [ 11 ] .
a number of studies have shown that bdnf provides neuroprotective effects against apoptotic cell death through the stimulation of a protein kinase cascade that includes the sequential activation of raf - 1 , mapk / erk kinase1 / 2 ( mek1 / 2 ) , and erk1 / 2 [ 12,13 ] .
extracellular signal - regulated kinase1 / 2 then phosphorylates the 90 kda ribosomal s6 kinase ( p90rsk ) , leading to the phosphorylation of bad and the attenuation of caspase - 3 - dependent apoptosis [ 14,15 ] .
in previous studies , bdnf agonists improved neurological function and reduced infarct size in a transient focal cerebral ischemia model in rats [ 16,17 ] .
however , mek / erk inhibitors abrogated bdnf - induced neuroprotection in hippocampal neurons in vitro [ 6 ] and in neonatal hypoxic - ischemic brain injury in vivo [ 18 ] .
chinese physicians have used acupuncture to treat various disorders for several centuries [ 19 ] .
according to traditional chinese medicine , baihui ( gv20 ) and dazhui ( gv14 ) are both acupoints on the " du meridian " , which travels into the brain , and are commonly used to treat stroke .
experimental studies in rats have shown that ea stimulation at acupoints ( such as baihui and shuigou acupoints ) can attenuate cerebral infarction and improve neurological outcome after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion ( mcao ) [ 20,21 ] .
kim et al. have reported that pretreatment with ea at baihui and dazhui acupoints elicit neuroprotection through increased bdnf and stromal cell derived factor - 1alpha ( sdf - 1alpha ) expression 1 d after mcao [ 22 ] .
other studies have also shown that ea can potentially provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic insults through activation of various survival signaling pathways [ 20,23 - 25 ] .
however , the detailed mechanisms underlying bdnf - induced neuroprotection resulting from ea stimulation at baihui and dazhui acupoints following mild cerebral i / r injury remain unclear .
the aim of this study was , therefore , to evaluate the effects of ea - like stimulation at baihui and dazhui acupoints ( ea at acupoints ) after 15 min of ischemia followed by 3 d of reperfusion , and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the bdnf - mediated signaling transduction pathway .
methods experimental animals male sprague dawley ( sd ) rats weighing 300 g to 350 g were used .
this study was reviewed and approved by china medical university institutional animal care and use committee ( permit number : 100 - 215 - c ) , and the committee recognized that the proposed experimental procedures compiled with the animal protection law by the council of agriculture , executive yuan , taiwan .
all the procedures with animals avoided or minimized discomfort , distress , and pain to the animals .
the mcao model the mcao model was established in the sd rats using an intraluminal suture method as described previously [ 26 ] .
briefly , the rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate ( 400 mg / kg , intraperitoneally ) , and the right common carotid artery ( cca ) and internal carotid artery ( ica ) were exposed by way of an incision in the midline neck prior to ligation of the pterygopalatine artery close to its branch .
a 3 - 0 nylon filament suture , blunted at the tip by a flame and coated with poly - l - lysine ( sigma , usa ) , was inserted into the right external carotid artery ( eca ) through the cca into the ica for a distance of 20 mm to 25 mm to block the origin of the middle cerebral artery ( mca ) .
the suture was removed slowly to reestablish the blood flow after 15 min of mcao .
the rectal temperature of the rats was maintained at 37 +/ - 0.5degreesc throughout the experimental procedure using an electrical heating pad .
electrode implantation following the completion of the mcao operation , the rat 's head was fixed to the stereotactic frame and its scalp or costal skin was incised .
the electrode consisted of 0.5 - mm stainless steel wires used for acupoint ( or nonacupoint ) stimulation .
it was implanted in baihui ( midpoint of the parietal bone , 4 - mm depth of insertion forward ) and dazhui ( below the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra , 5 - mm depth of insertion vertically ) acupoints , or in bilateral costal regions ( nonacupoints ) .
the rat was then returned to the cage .
assessment of neurological status the neurological status of each rat was assessed after 1 d and 3 d of reperfusion .
motor , sensory , balance , and reflex functions were determined using the modified neurological severity score as described previously [ 27 ] .
the neurological function of each rat was graded using a numeric scale from 0 to 18 .
( normal score , 0 ; maximal deficit score , 18 ) .
excepting the sham - operation group , rats with neurological deficit scores equal to or greater than 7 after 1 d of reperfusion were included in further analyses , whereas rats with neurological deficit scores less than 7 were excluded from subsequent analyses .
experiment a grouping rats were randomly divided into 6 groups ( n = 5 or 6 ) : the ea - like stimulation at acupoints ( ea group ) , ea - like stimulation at nonacupoints ( non - acup ) , model , sham - operation ( sham ) , treatment with u0126 in the ea ( u0126 + ea ) and treatment with vehicle in the ea ( vehicle + ea ) groups .
rats in the ea group were subjected to 15 min of mcao .
after 1 d of reperfusion , rats received ea at acupoints once daily for 2 consecutive days .
rats were then sacrificed after 3 d of reperfusion .
rats in the non - acup group were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the ea group but received ea at nonacupoints .
rats in the model group were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the ea group but did not receive ea. rats in the sham group were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the model group but the mca origin was not occluded .
rats in the u0126 + ea group were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the ea group but also received an intracerebroventricular ( icv ) injection of the mek1 / 2 inhibitor u0126 30 min prior to the onset of ea at acupoints .
rats in the vehicle + ea group were subjected to the same procedure as rats in the ea group but also received an icv injection of the vehicle 30 min prior to the onset of ea at acupoints .
intracerebroventricular injection of u0126 or vehicle rats were anesthetized with a 2 % isoflurane / oxygen mixture and an icv injection of a 4 mul solution containing u0126 ( 4 mug in vehicle , # 662005 calbiochem ) or vehicle ( dmso diluted in saline ) was administered to the right hemisphere .

briefly , brain sections adjacent to those used in ihc analysis were incubated with 20 mug / ml proteinase k for 20 min at rt , rinsed with a tris - buffered saline and incubated with a 1 x tdt equilibration buffer for 30 min at rt. they were then incubated with a tdt labeling reaction mixture for 1.5 h at 37degreesc .
after addition of the stop solution and blocking buffer , sections were incubated with 1 x conjugate solution for 30 min at rt , and the tunel - positive cells were visualized using a dab kit ( calbiochem ) .
finally , sections were counterstained with methyl green ( calbiochem ) .
western blot analysis three days after reperfusion , the rats were anesthetized with choral hydrate ( n = 4 ) .
the rat brains were then removed and sectioned coronally from - 4.3 mm to + 1.7 mm bregma .
the brain was separated into the right cortex , right striatum , left cortex , and left striatum , and the right cortex was weighed and homogenized in an ice cold phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) ( 0.5 ml ) .
lysates were centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min at 4degreesc , and the supernatant was removed .
after addition of 200 mul cytosol extraction buffer a (# k266 - 25 biovision , usa ) and 11 mul cytosol extraction buffer b (# k266 - 25 biovision , usa ) , the suspension was centrifuged at 16000 x g for 30 min at 4degreesc .

after 3 d of reperfusion , the neurological deficit scores were higher in the model group than in the sham group ( p < 0.05 ) .
however , the neurological deficit scores were markedly lower in the ea and vehicle + ea groups than in the model group ( both p < 0.05 ; figure 2b ) .
after 3 d of reperfusion , the neurological deficit scores in the model , non - acup , and u0126 + ea groups showed no significant difference ( p > 0.05 ; figure 2b ) , indicating that u0126 pretreatment eradicated the effects that caused the difference in the neurological deficit scores between the model and ea groups .
effects of ea at acupoints on bdnf , praf - 1 , pmek1 / 2 , perk1 / 2 , and pp90rsk expression we evaluated bdnf - , praf - 1 - , pmek1 / 2 - , perk1 / 2 - , and pp90rsk - positive cells within the dotted line square of brain coronal sections ( counts / 1 mm2 ; figure 3a ) .
after 3 d of reperfusion , we observed a greater number of bdnf - , praf - 1 - , pmek1 / 2 - , perk1 / 2 - , and pp90rsk - positive cells in the ischemic cortex in the model , ea , non - acup , and u0126 + ea groups compared to the sham group ( all p < 0.05 ; figures 3b , 4a , b and c and 5a ; table 1 ) .
we also observed a significantly higher number of bdnf - , praf - 1 - , pmek1 / 2 - , perk1 / 2 - , and pp90rsk - positive cells in the ischemic cortex in the ea group compared to the model group ( all p < 0.05 ; figures 3b , 4a , b and c and 5a ; table 1 ) .
however , the levels of immunopositivity in the non - acup and model groups showed no significant differences ( all p > 0.05 ; figures 3b , 4a , b and c and 5a ; table 1 ) .
the numbers of bdnf - and praf - 1 - positive cells in the ischemic cortex were significantly higher in the u0126 + ea group than in the model group ( both p < 0.05 ; figures 3b and 4a ; table 1 ) .

discussion in this study , a 15 - min period of mcao consistently caused gross infarction after 3 d of reperfusion .
this result was in accordance with those of previous studies , in which mild focal cerebral ischemia models showed markedly delayed infarct development after 72 h of reperfusion [ 2 - 4 ] .
our data also indicated that ea at acupoints , applied at 1 d after cerebral i / r injury and once daily for 2 consecutive days , effectively reduced cerebral infarct areas and neurological deficits , whereas ea at nonacupoints did not attenuate cerebral ischemic injury and behavioral deficits after 3 d of reperfusion .
previous studies have reported that preconditioning with repeated ea at the baihui acupoint provided neuroprotective effects against focal cerebral ischemia in rats [ 20,28 ] .
our study findings further indicated that 2 repeated ea - like stimulations at baihui and dazhui acupoints , but not at nonacupoints , provided significant neuroprotection against cerebral i / r injury in a mild focal cerebral ischemia model .
accumulating evidence has shown that bdnf plays an important role in brain development and plasticity , and that exogenous and endogenous bdnf promote synaptic plasticity and axon growth , which correlate positively with behavioral change and neurological recovery in transient cerebral i / r injury [ 29 - 31 ] .
studies have also shown that bdnf exerts neuroprotective effects against cerebral infarction by activating intercellular survival signaling pathways in transient mcao in rats [ 10,16,32 ] .
in our evaluations , we observed that ea at acupoints increased the expression of bdnf in the ischemic cortex significantly after 3 d of reperfusion .
on the basis of these findings , we suggest that ea at acupoints exerted its neuroprotective effects against cerebral infarction and behavioral deficits in our mild mcao model , at least partly , through the upregulation of bdnf expression .
apoptosis is a prominent feature in mild focal cerebral ischemia and plays a crucial pathological role in the development of delayed infarction .
active caspase - 3 , which is a pivotal apoptotic executioner and causes cells to undergo nuclear condensation and dna fragmentation , was increased significantly 24 h to 72 h postreperfusion [ 2 ] .
other studies have reported that the administration of apoptosis inhibitors 6 h postreperfusion exerted beneficial effects on cerebral i / r insults after 3 d or 14 d of reperfusion in mild mcao [ 4,33 ] .
in our tunel assays , the number of apoptotic cells showed marked increases in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion , and ea at acupoints ( initiated after 1 d of reperfusion ) markedly reduced apoptotic activity in the ischemic cortex .
a previous study has reported that neun , a marker of mature neurons , colocalized with apoptotic cells in the ischemic area 3 d after mild focal cerebral ischemia [ 34 ] .
in our study , double staining for active caspase - 3 and neun revealed that active caspase - 3 - labeling colocalized with relatively weak neun labeling , and markedly increased in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion , consistent with changes in apoptosis .
however , ea at acupoints markedly suppressed any increases in active caspase - 3 - labeling .
in contrast , ea at acupoints effectively restored neun labeling through antigen retrieval .
these results are consistent with those of the study by cheng et al. , which identified a negative feedback loop between caspase - 3 - dependent apoptosis and neun immunoreactivity in the model and caspase inhibitor - treated groups following cerebral i / r injury [ 35 ] .
our findings further indicated that ea at acupoints provides bdnf - mediated neuroprotection against cerebral i / r injury through inhibition of caspase - 3 - dependent neuronal apoptosis in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion , and that posttreatment of ea at acupoints extends the effective time window for up to 24 h postreperfusion following mild mcao .
previous studies have well - described that bdnf promotes cortical neuron survival in response to ischemic insult through activation of the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway , which includes raf - 1 , mek1 / 2 , and erk1 / 2 phosphorylation [ 10,36,37 ] .
they have also shown that activation of the raf - 1 / mek1 / 2 / erk1 / 2 signaling pathway provides neuroprotective effects through the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis during focal cerebral ischemia [ 11,14,15 ] .
the downstream target of the raf - 1 / mek1 / 2 / erk1 / 2 signaling pathway is p90rsk and a number of studies have proposed that pharmacologically selective activation of the raf - 1 / mek1 / 2 / erk1 / 2 signaling pathway elicits neuroprotective effects through the phosphorylation of p90rsk and bad .
phosphorylated bad binds to 14 - 3 - 3 to prevent the interaction between bad and antiapoptotic proteins ( bcl - 2 and bcl - xl ) , which inhibits mitochondrial permeability transition pore formation and suppresses caspase - 3 - dependent apoptosis in permanent [ 11,38 ] and mild transient [ 39 ] mcao models .
however , it remains obscure whether bdnf - mediated neuroprotection resulting from ea stimulation involves phosphorylation of p90rsk and bad following cerebral i / r injury .
when evaluating the expression of molecules related to the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway , we observed sparse praf - 1 , pmek1 / 2 , perk1 / 2 , and pp90rsk expression in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion .
however , ea at acupoints effectively increased the expression of these protein kinases in our mild transient mcao model .
western blot analysis further showed that ea at acupoints effectively increased the cytosolic expression of pmek1 / 2 , perk1 / 2 , pp90rsk , and pbad in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion .
our results suggested that ea at acupoints elicits bdnf - mediated neuroprotective action against caspase - 3 - dependent neuronal apoptosis through activation of the raf - 1 / mek1 / 2 / erk1 / 2 signaling pathway , and that the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway - mediated neuroprotective effects of ea at acupoints can be further attributed to the phosphorylation of p90rsk and bad in the ischemic cortex after 3 d of reperfusion following mild mcao .
during cerebral ischemia progression , the survival signaling cascades activated by neuroprotective agents include the pi3k and mapk / erk1 / 2 signaling pathways , which can cause cross - reactions and prevent apoptosis [ 15,37 ] .
several reports have described that ea posttreatment elicits neuroprotective action against ischemic insults through the activation of the pi3k signaling pathway after 1 d of reperfusion in mild [ 24,25 ] and moderate [ 23 ] focal cerebral ischemia models .
one study done by du et al. , has shown that ea pretreatment elicited neuroprotective effects through activation of the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway after 1 d of reperfusion in a severe mcao model [ 20 ] .
these results indicated that ea treatment can potentially provide neuroprotection against cerebral i / r injury by activating pi3k and erk1 / 2 signaling pathways in mcao models .
previous studies have also reported that pharmacological activators of the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway elicit neuroprotection through the upregulation of bdnf expression in cerebral ischemia models [ 9,40 ] .
therefore , to gain further insight into the possible role of the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway in bdnf - mediated neuroprotection induced by ea at acupoints , we examined the effects of the mek1 / 2 inhibitor u0126 , which can inhibit activation of erk1 / 2 by inhibiting mek1 / 2 and eradicate erk1 / 2 signaling pathway - mediated neuroprotective effects in transient mcao [ 20,39 ] .
in our evaluations , we observed that in the u0126 + ea group , administration of u0126 30 min prior to the onset of ea at acupoints fully eradicated the neuroprotective effects of ea at acupoints against cerebral infarction , neurological deficits , and caspase - 3 - dependent neuronal apoptosis after 3 d of reperfusion .
during further analysis of the expression of erk1 / 2 signaling - related protein kinases and bdnf , we observed that pretreatment with u0126 abrogated the upregulating effects of ea at acupoints on cytoplasmic pmek1 / 2 , perk1 / 2 , pp90rsk and pbad expression .
however , u0126 pretreatment did not affect the upregulating effects of ea at acupoints on upstream kinase praf - 1 or bdnf expression .
based on these findings , we propose that ea at acupoints ( initiated 1 d postreperfusion ) upregulated bdnf expression , which subsequently upregulated the expression of raf - 1 .
in addition , u0126 pretreatment eradicated the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway - mediated neuroprotection induced by ea at acupoints , confirming that in our mild mcao model , activation of the erk1 / 2 signaling pathway , and subsequent phosphorylation of p90rsk and bad , induced bdnf - mediated neuroprotection against caspase - 3 - dependent neuronal apoptosis after 3 d of reperfusion .
to our knowledge , this is the first study to show that ea at acupoints induces bdnf - mediated neuroprotection against apoptosis through phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 / p90rsk / bad pathway in the model of mild transient focal cerebral ischemia .
conclusion in this study , ea at acupoints , initiated 1 d postreperfusion , effectively upregulated bdnf expression to provide bdnf - mediated neuroprotection against neuronal apoptosis through phosphorylation of the raf - 1 / mek1 / 2 / erk1 / 2 / p90rsk / bad signaling cascade after 3 d of reperfusion .
our data suggest that ea at acupoints could potentially provide a therapeutic strategy to extend the time window in mild cerebral i / r injury , and warrants further investigation for future clinic application .

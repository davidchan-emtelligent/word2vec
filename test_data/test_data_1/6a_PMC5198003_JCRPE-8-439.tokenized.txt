objective : the aim of this study was to investigate depression - like behaviors of juvenile rats with congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism .
methods : twenty - seven newborn rat pups were used .
first , 6 - month - old wistar albino female rats were impregnated .
methimazole ( 0.025 % wt / vol ) was given to dam rats from the first day of pregnancy until postnatal 21 days ( p21 ) to generate pups with congenital hypothyroidism ( n = 8 ) , whereas in the postnatal hypothyroidism group ( n = 10 ) , methimazole was given from p0 to p21 .
in the control group ( n = 9 ) , dam rats were fed ad libitum and normal tap water .
offspring were fed with breast milk from their mothers .
the behavioral parameters were measured with the juvenile forced swimming test ( jfst ) .
the procedure of jfst consisted of two sessions in two consecutive days : the 15 - minute pre - test on day 1 and the 5 - minute test on day 2 .
results : increased immobility and decreased climbing duration were observed in both congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism groups .
decreased swimming duration was detected in the postnatal hypothyroidism group .
both hypothyroidism groups had a lower body weight gain compared with the control group , while the congenital hypothyroidism group had the lowest body weight .
conclusion : our results showed that hypothyroidism had negative effects on depression - like behavior as well as on growth and development .
both congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism caused an increase in immobility time in jfst .
new studies are required to understand the differing results on depression - like behavior between congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism .
congenital hypothyroidism depression forced swimming test rats what is already known on this topic ?
hypothyroidism has been recognized as an important cause of depression .
adult rats with hypothyroidism have showed increased immobility time in forced swimming test ( fst ) .
what this study adds ?
this is the first study that explores behavioral patterns of juvenile rats with congenital or postnatal hypothyroidism in fst .
introduction the interaction between thyroid hormones and neurobehavioral alterations has been reported in previous studies ( 1,2 ) .
in mammals , this interaction begins in fetal life and continues throughout life .
thyroid hormones play an essential role in the maturation of the central nervous system by increasing trimonoaminergic neurotransmitters and mediating the formation of neuronal branching and synapses ( 3 ) .
a number of studies have highlighted that fetal and neonatal hypothyroidism have a negative effect on the neurodevelopment process ( 4,5 ) .
retarded locomotor ability as well as hyperactivity were reported as a consequence of experimental hypothyroidism in developing rats ( 6,7,8 ) .
in clinical trials , hypothyroidism and elevated thyroid - stimulating hormone ( tsh ) levels have been shown to lead to depression in adult patients ( 9,10,11,12 ) .
in a child and adolescent sample , withdrawal , anxiety / depression , mental problems , attention problems and aggressive behavior subscale scores were found to be significantly higher in the congenital hypothyroidism group in which treatment was started at an early age compared with a control group ( 13 ) .
however , the relationship between depression and congenital hypothyroidism is debatable .
the purpose of this study was to investigate the depression - like behaviors of juvenile rats with congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism .
methods the study has been approved by adnan menderes university animal experiments local ethics committee for the ethical care and use of animals in research and was conducted on 6 - month - old wistar albino female rats ( 210 - 250 g weight ) and their 27 pups provided by adnan menderes university medical faculty experimental animal laboratory .
all animal care and experimental procedures were in accordance with the national institutes of health guide for care and use of laboratory animals 1985 .
the rats were mated with males for fertilization .
vaginal smears were performed for the determination of pregnancy .
when semen was detected in the vaginal smears , rats were thought to be pregnant .
pregnant rats were divided into 3 groups .
group 1 [ methimazole ( mmi ) - induced prenatal hypothyroidism group ] : mmi ( 0.025 % wt / vol ) was given daily in drinking water to pregnant rats from the first day of pregnancy until postnatal 21 days ( e0 to p21 ) to generate pups with congenital hypothyroidism ( n = 8 ) .
all pups were fed with breast milk from their lactating mothers .
group 2 ( mmi - induced postnatal hypothyroidism group ) : the pregnant rats were fed ad libitum with water during pregnancy .
mmi ( 0.025 % wt / vol ) was given daily in drinking water to dam rats from birth .
offspring were fed with breast milk from their mothers to generate postnatal hypothyroidism ( n = 10 ) .
group 3 ( control group ) : the pregnant rats were fed ad libitum and normal tap water without mmi from e0 to p21 .
rat pups were fed with breast milk from their lactating mothers ( n = 9 ) .
pups were kept in the same cage with their own dams until p21 .
the observers were blind to the treatment .
the last day , pups were weighed .
the rats were placed separately in restricted plastic cages under artificial lighting from fluorescent lamps , with a 12 - h light photoperiod and a 12 - h dark photoperiod .
the room temperature was set at 25 degreesc constant heat and 45 % - 55 % humidity rates .
mmi ( sc - 205747a , santa cruz biotechnology , inc. , dallas , tx ) ( 0.025 % wt / vol ) was prepared daily and administered via the peroral route in drinking water .
this protocol and dosage of mmi administration are typically used for the production of congenitally hypothyroid rats ( 14,15,16 ) .
juvenile forced swimming test ( jfst ) was administered as described by reed et al ( 17 ) .
on the first day of the experiment , the rats were placed one by one in a tank 40 cm in height , 25 cm in diameter containing water of 23 degreesc .
the animals were left to spend 15 minutes inside the water .
the rats were then placed back in their cages and dried .
the water in the tank was changed at each animal replacement .
twenty - four hours after this familiarization , the jfst was performed .
a high - resolution camcorder ( samsung hmx - qf30 full hd ) recorded the 5 minutes following the first minute of contact with the water .
the rats were placed back in their cages after they were taken from the tank and dried .
the presented procedure was applied to all animals in an identical way .
then climbing , swimming , and immobility durations were determined via the camcorder recordings by a researcher blind to the treatment groups .
modified scoring criteria for juvenile rats were applied ( 17 ) .
5 - minute durations were uniformly divided into 5 - second duration intervals and the type of interval was determined according to the dominant activity in the interval ( 18,19,20 ) .
the duration in seconds of each activity exhibited by the experiment animal during the jfst was determined by multiplying the number of the intervals of the corresponding activity type by 5 .
jfst was performed to all pups to investigate the depression - like behaviors .
the procedure of jfst consisted of two sessions in two consecutive days : the 15 - minute pre - test on day 1 and the 5 - minute test on day 2 ( 24 h later ) .
the behavioral parameters analyzed were duration of immobility , swimming , and climbing .
after the swimming test was terminated , intracardiac blood samples were collected under anesthesia with 50 mg / kg ketamine and 10 mg / kg xylazine .
serum concentrations of free 3,5,3 ' , 5 ' - tetraiodothyronine [ free thyroxine ( ft4 )] and free 3,5,3 ' - triiodothyronine ( ft3 ) were measured with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ( eclia ) by using commercial kits .
statistical analysis spss 20.0 for windows packaged program was used to analyze the data ( 21 ) .
suitability for the normal distribution was evaluated by kolmogorov - smirnov test .
data were expressed as mean +/ - standard deviation ( sd ) .
the normally - distributed data were analyzed using a one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) .
behavior patterns ( swimming and climbing ) were analyzed using anova .
the kruskal - wallis ( kw ) h test was used as a non - parametric test for immobility duration .
a two - tailed p - value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results in this study , increase in duration of immobility was observed in the postnatal hypothyroidism group compared with control and congenital hypothyroidism groups ( kw h test , chi2 = 14.347 , df = 2 , p = 0.001 ; mean ranks : control = 8.39 , congenital = 11.06 , postnatal = 21.40 ) ( figure 1 ) .
there was a statistically significant difference in swimming duration between the groups as determined by one - way anova [ f ( 2.24 )= 7.438 , p = 0.003 ] .
a tukey post - hoc test revealed that swimming duration was significantly lower in the postnatal hypothyroidism group ( 50.5 +/ - 45.4 s , p = 0.002 ) compared to the congenital hypothyroidism group ( figure 2 ) .
in terms of climbing duration , it was lower in the congenital ( 144.3 +/ - 32.9 s ) and postnatal ( 99 +/ - 44.2 s ) hypothyroidism groups than in the control group ( 196.6 +/ - 48.1 s ) ( one - way anova [ f ( 2.24 )= 12.391 , p < 0.001 , tukey post - hoc test ; postnatal x control p < 0.001 , congenital x control p = 0.048 ] .
there was no statistically significant difference between the congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism groups ( p = 0.085 ) ( figure 3 ) .
blood levels of ft3 and ft4 were lower in the congenital and postnatal groups when compared with the control group , as expected ( table 1 ) .
there were statistically significant differences within the groups in weight as an indicator of growth / development ( p < 0.001 ) ( table 2 ) .
discussion the forced swimming test is a method that has been accepted and widely used in the assessment of depression - like behavior in rodents ( 22,23 ) .
prolongation of immobility time in the fst is the main indicator of depression - like behavior ( 24 ) .
in the present study , statistically significantly increased immobility and decreased climbing duration in both congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism groups and decreased swimming duration in the postnatal hypothyroidism group was detected .
consistent with our findings , it has been reported that adult rats with hypothyroidism created using propylthiouracil or hemi / total thyroidectomy , showed increased immobility and decreased climbing time in fst ( 25,26,27,28,29 ) .
additionally , ge et al ( 27 ) reported reduction in swimming time in both clinical and subclinical hypothyroid rats .
in contrast , yu et al ( 30 ) and da conceicao et al ( 31 ) reported decreased immobility time in adult rats with hypothyroidism .
as there is a paucity of research evaluating depression - like behavior in juvenile rats with hypothyroidism , we were not able to compare our findings with other studies .
alterations in both the hypothalamic - pituitary - thyroid and hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis have been shown in depression models in rats and in humans ( 32,33 ) .
stress - induced hyperactivity of the hpa axis , including increased availability of corticotropin - releasing hormone and cortisol may affect the amygdala and hippocampus and may lead to decreased serotonergic neurotransmission ( 34 ) .
thus , the hpa axis is thought to be the final common pathway in the pathogenesis of depression ( 35 ) .
montero - pedrazuela et al ( 28 ) suggested that a depressive - like behavior in adult - onset hypothyroidism in rats had a relationship with an impairment of hippocampal proliferation .
interestingly , in our study it was observed that the postnatal hypothyroidism group had the longest immobility time .
johnson et al ( 36 ) found that duration of hypothyroidism had different effects on the hpa axis in rats .
according to their study , short - term hypothyroidism was associated with increased pituitary corticotroph responsiveness to corticotropin - releasing hormone in contrast with long - term hypothyroidism ( 36 ) .
we speculate that when an imbalance of thyroid hormone homeostasis is acquired , duration of exposure to hypothyroidism would be a possible reason for the different findings in behavioral tests .
there are many animal studies suggesting that thyroid hormones influence norepinephrine and serotonin levels which play crucial role in depression pathogenesis ( 31,37,38,39,40 ) .
a recent study , which aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of a link between thyroid and serotoninergic system , suggested that the lateral habenula might play a role in depression - like behavior in rats with hypothyroidism ( 29 ) .
hassan et al ( 41 ) observed that there was a significant decrease of plasma dopamine , norepinephrine , and serotonin levels in young and adult rats with hypothyroidism .
a similar decrease in platelet serotonin concentration was also reported in a study conducted on hypothyroid patients ( 42 ) .
congenital hypothyroidism leads to a lower developmental quotient and delay in psychomotor development as well as to high depression / anxiety scores in clinical samples ( 13,43,44,45 ) .
determination of lower ft3 and ft4 blood levels in the congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism groups compared with the control group provided an evidence of hypothyroidism .
this finding is expected to be accompanied by an increase in tsh levels .
our failure to analyze the rat - specific tsh is the most important limitation of this study .
thyroid hormones play an important role in growth , development , and neurodevelopmental processes .
it has been reported that brain and bone growth and sexual maturation are more affected in rats with thyroid hormone deficiency which has an onset in fetal life ( 4 ) .
both hypothyroidism groups had a lower body weight gain compared with the control group , while the congenital hypothyroidism group had the lowest body weight .
it is thought that growth and development are more affected due to earlier onset of thyroid hormone deficiency in congenital hypothyroidism .
in conclusion , to our knowledge , this is the first study that explores behavioral patterns of juvenile rats with congenital or postnatal hypothyroidism in jfst .
our results showed that hypothyroidism had negative effects on depression - like behavior as well as on growth and development .
in both congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism groups , increased immobility time in jfst was observed .
we found that in juvenile rats , postnatal hypothyroidism was more likely to cause a depression - like behavior , while congenital hypothyroidism affects mainly the growth and development processes .
new studies are required in order to understand the differing results in depression - like behavior between subjects with congenital and postnatal hypothyroidism .

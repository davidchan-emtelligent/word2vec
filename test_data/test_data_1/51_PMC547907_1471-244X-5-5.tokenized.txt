background although serotonin reuptake inhibitors are effective in the treatment of ocd , many patients fail to respond to these agents .
growing evidence from open - label and placebo - controlled trials suggests a role for augmentation of sris with atypical antipsychotics in ocd .
quetiapine is generally well tolerated and previous open - label data has produced mixed results in ocd and additional controlled data is needed .
methods we undertook a double - blind , randomised , parallel - group , flexible - dose , placebo - controlled study of quetiapine augmentation in subjects who had responded inadequately to open - label treatment with an sri for 12 weeks .
following informed consent and screening , forty - two subjects were randomised to either placebo or quetiapine for six weeks .
results there was significant improvement from baseline to endpoint on the yale - brown obsessive - compulsive scale in both the quetiapine and placebo groups ( quetiapine , n = 20 , p < 0.0001 ; placebo , n = 21 , p = 0.001 ) with 40 % ( n = 8 ) of quetiapine and 47.6 % ( n = 10 ) of placebo treated subjects being classified as responders .
quetiapine did not demonstrate a significant benefit over placebo at the end of the six - week treatment period ( p = . 636 ) .
similarly quetiapine failed to separate from placebo in the subgroup of subjects ( n = 10 ) with co - morbid tics .
quetiapine was generally well tolerated .
conclusions in this study , quetiapine augmentation was no more effective than placebo augmentation of sris .
a number of limitations in study design make comparisons with previous studies in this area difficult and probably contributed to our negative findings .
future work in this important clinical area should address these limitations .
background obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) is a prevalent , chronic and disabling disorder [ 1 ] .
controlled pharmacotherapy studies have established superiority of serotonin re - uptake inhibitors ( sri 's ) over noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and over placebo in ocd and these currently form the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy management [ 2 ] .
despite the considerable advances made with the introduction of the sri 's into clinical practice , 40 - 60 % of subjects still fail to respond adequately to initial therapy [ 3,4 ]. from this it is clear that a need exists to pursue more effective treatments for those with ocd who fail to respond or respond inadequately to sri's. to this end , preliminary evidence supports a role for the addition of atypical antipsychotics to sris in ocd .
these agents combine serotonin - dopamine antagonism with the advantage of being well tolerated including a low potential for inducing motor side - effects .
to date a number of open - label studies have suggested that augmenting sri 's with atypical antipsychotics is an effective strategy for treatment - refractory ocd .
these include support for risperidone [ 5 - 7 ] , olanzapine [ 8 - 13 ] , and more recently amisulpride [ 14 ] and quetiapine [ 15 - 18 ] .
a single open - label study using quetiapine as augmentation showed lack of effect in a small sample using low doses [ 19 ] .
the outcome of the first controlled study in this area with the antipsychotic haloperidol demonstrated preferential benefit for refractory ocd subjects with co - morbid tic disorder [ 20 ] .
in two subsequent studies the efficacy of risperidone in sri refractory ocd has also been reported [ 21,22 ] .
interestingly the former study [ 21 ] , did not replicate the particular advantage for subjects with co - morbid tic disorder .
efficacy has also been shown for quetiapine [ 23 ] and olanzapine [ 24 ] using similar designs , but the effects on co - morbid tic disorders were not reported .
in contrast a recent controlled study using olanzapine failed to demonstrate efficacy over placebo in a six week study [ 25 ] .
despite some mixed evidence in this area , in general the available literature appears to support the use of relatively short trials with low doses of antipsychotic agents as augmentation to sris .
quetiapine has a particularly interesting profile in that it is the only available antipsychotic with significant 5 - ht1d effects and this serotonin receptor subtype has been implicated in ocd [ 26,27 ] .
our objective was to examine the effects of quetiapine augmentation in subjects with ocd who had failed to respond adequately to a 12 week trial of an sri , employing a double - blind , placebo - controlled , six week study design .
methods patients forty two subjects aged 18 - 65 years inclusive were recruited in our multi - centre study comprising five sites in south africa and one in canada .
recruitment took place between may 2002 and november 2003 .
prior to commencement , all sites in the study received approval from their relevant research ethics committees / institutional review boards and regulatory authorities .
all subjects provided written informed consent prior to the commencement of any study - related procedures .
diagnosis was confirmed using the mini neuropsychiatric interview ( version 5.00 , 1998 ) [ 28 ] to ensure compatibility with the diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders , fourth edition ( dsm - ivtr )[ 29 ] criteria for ocd .
subjects with any co - existing axis i disorder were excluded unless the co - morbid condition was deemed to be secondary to the ocd .
female subjects of childbearing potential were required to use adequate contraception and were not permitted to breastfeed while on the study .
subjects were excluded if they suffered from unstable medical conditions including renal or hepatic insufficiency , epilepsy or had suffered previous brain injury or undergone brain surgery .
taking medication that was deemed likely to interact with quetiapine or any other psychoactive substance was grounds for exclusion .
study design all subjects were treated and monitored by investigators for the minimum twelve week duration of sri - alone treatment phase before inclusion into this study .
this was to ensure that patients met criteria for duration of sri treatment which included at least 6 weeks on the maximum tolerated dose of the relevant sri .
sample size calculations were based conservatively on similar work in this area [ 20,21 ] .
accordingly , for the primary outcome variable ( ybocs ) , clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups of 6.67 with a standard deviation ( sd ) of 6 would be detected with a power of 80 % at a 5 % significance level with a sample size of 14 in each of the treatment groups .
the larger sample recruited reflects the anticipation of a 33 % drop - out rate in the double - blind treatment phase .
a double - blind , randomised , parallel - group six - week augmentation with quetiapine or matching placebo of the sri to which participants had not responded adequately , was undertaken .
specific sri 's , mean doses and dose range are provided in table 1 .
non - responsiveness to an sri was defined as either an improvement score on the clinical global impression scale of minimally improved ( 3 ) or worse ( 4,5,6 ) , or less than 25 % reduction in yale brown obsessive - compulsive score following twelve weeks of treatment .
inadequate response , as defined above , to at least one sri administered for a minimum of 12 weeks of which 6 weeks was either at the maximum tolerated dose or alternatively the manufacturer 's recommended maximum daily dose .
sri doses were maintained at the same level throughout the double - blind treatment phase .
for assignment to either quetiapine or placebo groups , we used a computer generated randomization schedule supplied by the sponsoring pharmaceutical company which also packaged the medication .
this procedure ensured blinded , balanced allocation to each treatment group across all the study sites .
all investigators remained blind to this schedule until closure of the study .
no incidents requiring investigators to break the blind occurred through the course of the study .

a flexible dosing schedule was initiated at 25 mg per day for one week and then doubled weekly to the start of week 4 .
based on clinical global impression of improvement ( cgi - i ) scores of minimally improved or worse , clinicians were permitted to increase the dose to a maximum of 300 mg per day for the final two weeks of the study .
in addition to clinical measures of improvement , clinicians also considered patient tolerability in their decision to adjust doses .
following completion of the treatment phase , subjects were withdrawn from study medication while continuing their sris .
all subjects were then followed up for any adverse effects .
ratings patients were assessed by clinicians at baseline and on completion of weeks 2 , 4 and 6 .
telephonic assessments were performed on completion of weeks 1 and 3 .
symptoms of obsessive - compulsive disorder were measured by the same clinician where possible at all study visits using the yale brown obsessive compulsive scale ybocs ) [ 30,31 ] .
a global assessment of severity and improvement was made by clinicians at all assessment points using the clinical global impressions scale of severity ( cgi - s ) and improvement ( cgi - i ) [ 32 ] .
depression was rated using the 10 - item montgomery - asberg depression rating scale ( madrs ) [ 33 ] .
for a measure of patient - rated disability we used the sheehan disability scale ( sds ) [ 34 ] .
for subjects with tics , frequency and severity were rated using the yale global tic severity scale ( ygtss ) [ 35 ] .
our primary outcome measures for ocd symptoms were ( 1 ) the change in ybocs score from baseline to endpoint and ( 2 ) the clinical global impression of improvement ( cgi - i ) at endpoint .
in the final analysis , treatment response was defined as a 25 % or greater reduction in ybocs score and a cgi - i of 1 ( very much improved ) or 2 ( much improved ) from baseline to endpoint .
secondary outcome measures included the madrs , sds and ygtss ( in subjects with co - morbid tics ) .
statistical analysis thirty - nine of the forty - two randomised subjects successfully completed the six - week treatment phase .
two subjects withdrew from the study prematurely ( week 1 and week 4 ) due to severe levels of sedation .
in both of these cases at least one week of study medication had been taken and at least one post - baseline clinical assessment was completed .
both of these subjects were included in the final analysis using data from the last observation carried forward ( locf ) .
the single subject not included in the efficacy analysis completed the study , but was found not to have correctly fulfilled the study definition of treatment refractoriness and was excluded .
twenty subjects were allocated to the quetiapine arm and twenty - one to the placebo arm .
student 's t - tests were used to determine any baseline differences in the groups for age , gender , number of previous trials of ssri 's , severity of symptoms in relation to ocd , depressive symptoms , and cgi - s. analysis of variance was undertaken with group and tics as factors .
all tests were two - tailed with p - values of less than 0.05 considered significant .
results study sample characteristics for the final analysis , our sample comprised 19 men and 22 women .
baseline characteristics of two treatment groups did not differ with respect to age ( years ) ( quetiapine group 33.8 ( sd 9.66 ) , placebo group 31.81 ( sd 12.14 ) ; p = 0.57 ) , gender ( p = 0.29 ) , number of previous adequate sri trials ( quetiapine 1.55 ( sd 1 ) , placebo 1.62 ( sd 1.02 ) ( p = 0.83 ) , baseline severity of ocd ( cgi - severity , p = 0.47 ; ybocs , p = 0.33 ) , depressive symptoms ( p = 0.91 ) , patient - rated disability ( p = 0.28 ) or the presence ( n = 11 , p = 0.66 and severity ( p = 0.87 ) of co - morbid tics .
treatment outcomes for the primary outcome measure of severity ( ybocs ) , quetiapine ( p < 0.0001 ) and placebo ( p = 0.001 ) augmentation of an sri significantly improved symptoms of ocd .
however quetiapine did not demonstrate significant benefit over placebo at the end of the six - week treatment period ( f = . 19 ; p = . 636 ) ( figure 1 ) .
the mean reduction in ybocs scores for the combined group was 7.15 points ( quetiapine = 7.10 ; placebo 7.19 ) .
forty percent ( n = 8 / 20 ) of subjects on quetiapine were classified as responders ( ybocs reduction of > 25 % from baseline and cgi - improvement score of 1 or 2 ) while 47.6 % ( n = 10 / 21 ) of subjects on placebo were classified as responders .
a higher number of previous sri trials for the each treatment group did not correlate with the degree of change on the ybocs or the response status .

endpoint data was missing for one subject on quetiapine. of the remaining 10 subjects , 3 ( quetiapine n = 2 ( 33 %) ; placebo n = 1 ( 20 %)) were classified as ybocs responders .
the reduction in the ygtss did not differ significantly between treatment groups with tics ( quetiapine - 4.5 , placebo - 9.4 ; f = 2.8 , p = . 46 ) .
severity ratings for depressive symptoms ( madrs ) were low at baseline ( mean 10.6 , sd 4.8 ) , showed little change over the study period , and at week 6 remained similar for both groups ( quetiapine = 8.2 , sd 4.8 ; placebo = 7.7 , sd 6.1 ) .
the mean daily dose at week 6 for the quetiapine group was 168.75 mg ( sd 120.82 ) compared to 228.57 mg ( sd 99.46 ) per day for those on placebo .
quetiapine responders ( 187.5 mg , sd 124.6 ) did not differ significantly from quetiapine non - responders ( 156.25 mg , sd 122.1 ) in their mean daily dose at week 6 ( p = . 585 ) .
furthermore , within the quetiapine group , participants receiving >= 200 mg / day ( 10 / 20 at week 6 demonstrated non - significant differences ( f = 6.837 , p = . 988 ) and a marginally lower percentage reduction in ybocs at endpoint ( 26.7 % , sd 20.34 ) compared to those receiving a dose <= 200 mg / day ( 26.9 % , sd 36.24 ) at endpoint .
tolerability quetiapine was generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events ( sae 's ) were reported through the course of the study period .
two patients on quetiapine withdrew from the study due to severe sedation ( week 1 and week 4 ) that was judged to be drug related .
otherwise adverse events were in the mild to moderate range and were mostly self - limiting .
no subjects on placebo withdrew from the study .
table 4 provides a list of the adverse events and their frequencies in the respective study groups .
table 4 percentage of subjects for each treatment group reporting adverse events adverse event quetiapine (% , n ) placebo (% , n ) sedation 75 % ( 15 ) 33.3 %( 7 ) dry mouth 15 % ( 3 ) 0 headache 15 % ( 3 ) 38 % ( 8 ) fatigue 15 % ( 3 ) 19 % ( 4 ) irritability 10 % ( 2 ) 4.7 % ( 1 ) impaired concentration 10 % ( 2 ) 0 dizziness 5 % ( 1 ) 14.3 % ( 3 ) nausea 5 % ( 1 ) 9.5 % ( 2 ) increased appetite 5 % ( 1 ) 9.5 % ( 2 ) delayed ejaculation 5 % ( 1 ) 0 weight gain 5 % ( 1 ) 0 worsening mood 5 %( 1 ) 4.7 %( 1 ) memory difficulties 5 %( 1 ) 0 muscle aches 5 %( 1 ) 0 abdominal tenderness 5 %( 1 ) 0 slurred speech 5 %( 1 ) 0 discussion our findings indicate that both quetiapine and placebo significantly reduced symptoms in subjects with ocd who had failed to respond adequately to 12 weeks of an ssri and , that the difference between groups was not significant .
similarly in the subgroup with co - morbid tics , no preferential benefit was noted for quetiapine .
interestingly , the high placebo response was similar to that seen in a recent failed controlled trial of olanzapine [ 25 ] , but stands in contrast to the positive studies in this area in which low placebo response rates were seen when demonstrating efficacy of quetiapine [ 23 ] , risperidone [ 21 ] , and olanzapine [ 24 ] .
it is likely that features of study design or specific study population characteristics may have contributed to this finding and these are discussed below .
first , the duration of a therapeutic trial of an sri prior to augmentation with an antipsychotic should be of adequate dose and duration .
in our study the majority of participants had failed only the single trial of an sri on which they continued during the study ( 63.4 % mean 1.59 ) .
notably only six weeks of this treatment was required at the maximum tolerated dose .
despite the notion that an optimum trial of pharmacotherapy in ocd is 12 weeks , it may be argued that higher and ultimately effective doses of an sri had not been maintained for an optimum duration prior to randomization .
given that therapeutic doses of sris in ocd are usually on the upper end of the dose range , it seems feasible that the high placebo response rate may reflect a response to sri 's once they had been administered at these higher doses for the additional six weeks of the study .
it seems possible that the recent study by shapira et al [ 25 ] may have been impacted by similar factors .
in a second and related point ; the number of previous sri trials in the subgroup receiving quetiapine did not predict a poorer response to treatment .
this effect is probably related to the lack of statistical power to detect these differences in a group in which the low number of previous sri trials was a distinguishing characteristic .
certainly , previous positive studies in this area have used relatively more refractory groups based on the number of previously failed sri trials .
taken together with the first point above , we suggest that future work in this area should consider longer periods at maximum tolerated doses of sri 's prior to categorisation of subjects as treatment refractory .
third , the use of a slow up - titration resulted in a relatively low mean daily dose being administered for the majority of the study .
for instance , a mean daily ( week 6 ) dose of 168 mg / day in the quetiapine group ( median 175 mg ) had only been achieved for the final two weeks of the study .
these doses are comparably low to those used in the negative single - blind study using low dose quetiapine by sevincok et al [ 19 ] .
in contrast the positive study using quetiapine by denys et al [ 23 ] employed a more rapid up - titration and a fixed - dose design .
this meant that subjects were exposed to 200 mg daily doses that were generally well tolerated , from the start of week 3 .
the authors of this study were able to show significant ybocs differences between groups from the end of week 4 .
similarly mc dougle et al [ 21 ] , using risperidone , began treatment on 1 mg per day for one week and permitted weekly 1 mg incremental increases for 6 weeks .
they found that by the beginning of week 2 , most subjects were on or around the mean daily dose for treatment responders ( 2.2 mg ) .
despite the significant improvement in the quetiapine group demonstrated in our study , the apparent lack of benefit of doses higher than 200 mg per day may seem surprising , however , we cannot rule out the possibility that administering these higher doses for an adequate duration would have changed the outcome .
in addition it must be noted that in our study the quetiapine group reported high rates of sedation ( n = 15 , 75 %) and a 10 % ( n = 2 ) rate of premature withdrawal was experienced .
as such it seems likely that a more aggressive up - titration schedule might have resulted in even higher rates of withdrawal. by comparison , rates of sedation were equally high , but did not appear to restrict use of the more rapid up - titration in the study by denys et al [ 23 ] .
certainly evidence of efficacy using lower doses has been demonstrated in studies of 6 and 8 weeks duration [ 21,23,24 ] , and it seems that therapeutically adequate doses should probably be reached earlier than week 4 in a 6 week study .
fourth , the impact of repeated clinical assessments and rating of relatively small changes in clinical severity combined with regular dose increases , may conceivably have increased the placebo response rates resulting from increased optimism , a tendency to over - report improvements and belief that higher doses are more likely to be more effective than lower doses .
this may be particularly true for the placebo - treated group that were considerably less likely to report sedation as an adverse event and as such were more likely to have their treatment dose increased at each visit .
our results differ , with respect to placebo response , from a considerable literature that suggests a consistently lower placebo response rate in treatment trials in ocd than in other mood and anxiety disorders .
while we believe that the reasons ( 1 - 3 ) discussed above probably provide the main reasons for our finding , the impact of repeated assessments and the potential effect thereof cannot be entirely discounted .
conclusions despite significant improvement in each of the study groups , response to quetiapine augmentation in sri non - responders , failed to separate from placebo treated subjects at the end of the six week treatment phase .
a number of limitations in study design make comparisons with previous studies in this area difficult and probably contributed to our negative findings .
future work in this important clinical area should address these limitations .

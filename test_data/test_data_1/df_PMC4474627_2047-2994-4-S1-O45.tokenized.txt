the campaigns combined educational sessions for healthcare workers ( hcws ) , promotion of alcohol - based hand rubs , patient awareness and audits with performance feedback .
each campaign consisted of a pre - campaign data collection period , an awareness period with training and a post - campaign data collection period .
objectives the campaigns aimed at raising awareness on good hh practices and promoting the use of alcohol based hand rubs [ 1 ] .
methods using a standardised observation roster , trained infection control teams measured adherence to hh guidelines by direct observation .
hh opportunities were counted and the actual episodes of hh were scored as no hh , hh with water and soap , or hh with alcohol - based hand rub .
compliance was stratified by indication and by type of healthcare worker .
compliance was computed as a percentage of the number of episodes divided by the number of opportunities .
each campaign had a specific message geared towards improving compliance , with the message of this year 's campaign being " hand hygiene , together with the patient " .
results participation rates were excellent for all years , with at least 79 % of all hospitals participating voluntarily .
national compliance rates increased from 49.6 % in 2005 to 69.1 % in 2015 before intervention , and from 68.6 % in 2005 to 75.8 % in 2013 after intervention .
after intervention results of 2015 are awaited .
generally nurses performed better than physicians and compliance rates increased for all indications but was always much higher after patient and body fluid contact than before patient contact .
compliance rates increased according to the campaign message for instance physicians compliance increased from 37.6 % in 2005 to 53 % in 2011 when the campaign message was " doctors do n't forget , it works and you have a role model " .
conclusion there was a high participation rate in all campaigns .
comparing the effect of all campaigns over time yielded an increase in hh compliance at short and long term when campaigns are repeated regularly , with campaign messages impacting the outcome .
disclosure of interest none declared .

nanocomposites electrical properties modeling piezoresistivity effect 1 .
introduction the development of nano - scale electrically conductive fillers and associated low cost fabrication methods has stimulated considerable interest in employing such particles to render otherwise insulating polymers conductive .
conductive nano - fillers , such as graphene platelets and exfoliated graphite , were found to impart significant conductivity and piezoresistivity behavior to polymers , which makes such material systems an excellent choice for electrical applications , such as strain sensors .
nano - platelet based conductive polymers have been the subject of a number of experimental studies [ 1 - 9 ] .
generally , these works were devoted to developing efficient fabrication methods and evaluate the conductivity and critical filler volume fraction at which a composite exhibits a transition from insulating to conductive behavior .
percolation theory has been a successful tool for describing the transition behavior of insulating polymers filled with conductive inclusions [ 10 - 14 ] .
according to percolation theory a critical filler volume fraction exists at which a percolation network is formed that renders a composite conductive .
the critical filler volume fraction at the onset of a percolation network is called the percolation threshold .
monte carlo simulation techniques have widely been employed to evaluate the percolation threshold and conductivity behavior of conductive composites [ 10 - 16 ] .
a large number of numerical and analytical investigations have been devoted to insulating polymers filled with spherical and stick - shaped conductive inclusions .
the majority of works related to conductive composites with platelet fillers has been experimental , and only few numerical and analytical studies on this subject are described in the technical literature [ 17 - 24 ] .
some researchers used monte carlo simulation techniques to evaluate the conductivity of platelet based conductive polymers .
hicks et al .
[ 17 ] developed a monte carlo - based computational model to predict the tunneling percolation behavior of a resistor network formed by rectangular conductive sheets that are oriented parallel to a substrate .
li and morris [ 18 ] developed a two - dimensional ( 2d ) computational percolation model to investigate the critical filler content and conductivity behavior for an adhesive filled with conductive flakes .
they assumed the inclusions to be rectangular plates that are dispersed in a 2d space .
the excluded volume method is another techniques employed for studying the percolation threshold of conductive platelet based composites .
xia and thorpe [ 19 ] , for example , investigated the percolation behavior of overlapping ellipses randomly located in a plane using the excluded volume method .
modeling based on the excluded volume method however has its limitations as it is unable to predict the effect of tunneling distance on the critical volume fraction .
consequently , for cases in which tunneling distance plays an important role in the conductivity behavior of composites ( e.g. , when particle dimensions and electron hopping distance become comparable in scale ) , excluded volume method based modeling is no longer efficient and cannot be employed to study the tunneling conductivity in conductive composites .
yi and tawerghi [ 20 ] carried out a numerical monte carlo based study to evaluate the percolation threshold for 2d interpenetrating plates , i.e. , circular , elliptical , square , and triangular plates dispersed in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space .
it was shown that noncircular geometries tend to produce higher percolation thresholds .
the percolation behavior of penetrable disks has been the subject of several other studies [ 21 - 23 ] .
vovchenko and vovchenko [ 24 ] , for example , predicted the percolation threshold of composites filled with intersecting circular disks .
otten and schoot [ 25 ] developed an analytical approach to investigate the percolation behavior of polydisperse nanofillers , specifically focusing on conductivity of needle - like filler nanocomposites .
they also briefly investigated the percolation behavior of platelet - based composites .
however , their modeling approach was subject to certain limitations , that is , the platelet thickness and the so - called tunneling decay length have to be of the same order of magnitude , and the diameter of disk - like fillers needs to be much larger than the disk thickness ( tunneling decay length corresponds to inverse of the square root of the insulator barrier height in the present study ) .
for monodisperse cases their model predicts the percolation threshold to be proportional to the ratio of filler thickness to decay length ; interestingly , the percolation threshold was independent of the filler diameter .
ambrosetti et al .
[ 26 ] conducted a numerical study to investigate the percolative properties of a system of hard oblate ellipsoids of revolution surrounded with soft penetrable shells .
for higher aspect ratios , oblates approach a disk - like geometry but still deviate from an ideal circular disk .
as described in a latter part of the present text ( section 3.3 ) , data from [ 26 ] was employed for comparison to platelet filler based tunneling percolation problems .
in a later work by ambrosetti et al .
[ 27 ] , their initial study was expanded to evaluate the conductivity of percolation networks formed by ellipsoids of revolution dispersed in an insulating matrix .
mathew et al .
[ 28 ] conducted a monte carlo study on the percolation of hard platelets in a 3d continuum system .
they represented the hard platelets by cut - spheres , which vary in shape from a platelet geometry .
in their model , platelet - like geometries were generated through intersecting a sphere with two parallel planes at equal distance from the equatorial plane .
their findings indicate that lower aspect ratios are associated with a lower percolation threshold .
note that the majority of related works neglected the condition of impenetrable disks , and only a few studies in the technical literature are devoted to the percolation behavior of impenetrable hard disk - like inclusions .
to the best of the authors' knowledge , research on this subject matter is limited to the last four studies mentioned above , which focus mainly on the percolation properties .
conductivity behavior in terms of a critical exponent describing post - percolation behavior and , more importantly , piezoresistivity behavior have been out of their scope .
moreover , in these studies , circular disks were approximated by ellipsoids or cut - spheres .
hence , studies on the tunneling percolation behavior of impenetrable circular disks in 3d space are lacking .
the limited quantity of published works related to the modeling of platelet based conductive polymers , and limitations associated with the employed techniques motivated the present authors to conceive an alternative approach for modeling the electrical behavior of polymers filled with conductive nano - platelet fillers .
published research on the electrical properties of nano - platelet based nanocomposites has further been limited to studying the electrical conductivity of polymers with exfoliated sheets with in - plane dimensions varying from a few to several hundred micrometer and thicknesses ranging from a few to several nanometers .
to achieve further enhancements in composite properties the synthesis of submicron size single layer graphene sheets may be an attractive proposition , and information on the percolation and electrical behavior of such reinforced polymers is therefore desirable .
the latter aspects are also addressed in the present contribution .
a 3d monte carlo model was developed to study the percolation , conductivity and piezoresistive behavior of composites filled with randomly dispersed impenetrable conductive nano - disks .
in the present study a monte carlo model was first developed to form a representative volume element filled with randomly dispersed nano - platelet conductive inclusions .
in a second stage a 3d finite element based resistors network model was used to analyze the conductivity behavior of nano - platelet based conductive polymers .
previous studies have shown that conductivity of such polymers for volume fractions greater than the percolation threshold can be described by a power - low expression [ 29 ] , i.e. : rho ~( v - vp ) s ( 1 ) where vp is the percolation threshold , v is the volume fraction of the dispersed inclusions , and rho and s are the resistivity and a critical exponent respectively .
parameters in equation ( 1 ) were determined through curve fitting using the results obtained from finite element modeling .
the resistor network model was also used to study the piezoresistive behavior for reoriented and updated conductive platelets when a conductive composite is subjected to mechanical strain .
2. formulation 2.1 .
random nano - platelet generation the developed 3d continuum monte carlo model is based on conductive inclusions that are randomly dispersed inside a cubic representative volume element ( rve ) with side length l. note that further details on the model described herein can be found in [ 30 ] .
conductive platelets were assumed as impenetrable circular disks with diameter d and thickness t. circular disks were randomly generated and uniformly dispersed inside the rve .
three random numbers ( xc,yc,zc ) were generated between ( 0,l ) to establish the coordinates of the center of each disk .
the random number generator algorithm developed by matsumoto and nishimura [ 31 ] was used for random number generation .
cornejo diaz et al .
[ 32 ] confirmed the suitability of this algorithm for monte carlo applications .
in order to determine the disk orientation , i.e. , the normal to the plane containing a disk , a point from the surface of a unit sphere was chosen employing the method presented by marsaglia [ 33 ] .
the point thus selected represents the end point of the normal vector with origin located at the center of the disk .
since , in this study , nano - platelets were assumed to be impenetrable rigid disks , the geometric feasibility of any generated disk needed to be validated so that only those disks were added to the rve that have no intersection with existing disks .
the intersection of two intersecting disks is a segment of a line , which is determined by the cross product of the normal vectors of the disk planes ( l = n1 x n2 ) .
two disks ( i and j ) are intersecting when the following inequality is satisfied : r2 - oipi 2 + r2 - ojpj 2 <= pipj ( 2 ) where oi is the center of the i - th disk and pi is a point on line l that is corresponding to the shortest distance of oi from line l .
2.2 .
electrical conductivity , clusters and percolation network electrical connection between two conductive inclusions arises from two different mechanisms , i.e. , ( i ) mechanical contact between conductive particles ; or ( ii ) electron tunneling effects .
based on quantum mechanical tunneling theory , electrical current can flow under certain conditions through an insulator material .
in other words , it can be assumed that a pair of conductive inclusions dispersed in an insulator matrix is electrically connected by a resistor formed by the matrix so that electrons can passage from one inclusion to the adjacent one .
it was shown in different studies that tunneling conductivity plays the dominant role in the conductivity of insulating polymers filled with conductive inclusions [ 34 ] .
for strongly conductive fillers the intrinsic filler conductivity has no appreciable contribution toward the nonlinear current - voltage behavior of nanocomposites , with nonlinearity arising from tunneling effects .
experimental research works devoted to studying the current - voltage behavior of carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) based [ 35,36 ] and graphene nano - platelet based [ 37,38 ] conductive nanocomposites indicate that nonlinear current - voltage behavior is more pronounced for disk - shaped fillers .
the significant dependency of conductivity on voltage in circular disks indicates that conductivity is indeed governed by tunneling mechanisms .
as shown by simmons [ 39 ] , electron tunneling resistivity can be described by equation ( 3 ) for a low - voltage range when edeltav << lambda , where deltav is the electrical potential , e is the quantum of electricity and lambda is the barrier height of the insulator .
rhotunl = h2e22mlambdaexp ( 4pidh2mlambda ) ( 3 ) where h is planck constant , m is the mass of an electron and d is the tunneling distance .
equation ( 3 ) was numerically evaluated for different values of lambda ( lambda = 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.5 ev ) and results are illustrated in figure 1 .
it can be observed that tunneling conductivity ( i.e. , the inverse of resistivity ) drastically decreases for an increasing tunneling distance .
it can , thus , be concluded that a cut - off distance can be approximated at which resistors with length greater than this distance have no appreciable contribution to the overall conductivity of the nanocomposite .
this cut - off distance is called electron - tunneling distance .
in the developed model , nano - platelets with neighboring distance less than the tunneling distance are labeled a cluster .
a cluster connecting two parallel faces of the rve is called a percolation network , which enables electrical current to flow through the rve , thus , rendering the nano - composite conductive .
the volume fraction of the conductive particles at the onset of the percolation network is called percolation threshold .
this concept is illustrated by the schematic shown in figure 2 .
it was assumed that current flow between two conductive inclusions would occur along the shortest possible path in between them .
it is therefore necessary to determine the shortest distance between the inclusions .
the algorithm developed by almohamad and selim [ 40 ] was employed in the present modeling approach to compute the shortest distance between two circular disks in 3d space .
in order to estimate the conductivity of a conductive composite a 3d network of resistors was formed ( see schematic in figure 3 ) .
as such , randomly dispersed conductive nano - platelets were modeled as circular disks generated and randomly dispersed inside the rve using the methods described above , and disks in clusters were mutually connected by tunneling resistors which resistivity was approximated using equation ( 3 ) .
disks were assumed to be in contact with each other when the shortest distance between their center planes is less than the thickness of the disks .
finite element modeling was employed to evaluate the conductivity of a resistor network representing the nanocomposite .
2.3 .
piezoresistivity effects subjecting a polymer with conductive inclusions to mechanical strain , as shown in figure 4 , is often accompanied by a change in resistivity .
this behavior is known as the piezoresistivity effect , which is an interesting characteristic of conductive nano - composites rendering them good candidates for sensor applications .
generally , there are two main reasons for piezoresistive behavior of nano - composites , i.e. , ( i ) changes in interparticular distance ; and ( ii ) reorientation of conductive particles .
piezoresistivity of nanocomposites with conductive inclusions has been the subject of several numerical and analytical works [ 17,41 - 43 ] .
in the present study , the described framework of monte carlo simulation and finite element modeling were employed to evaluate the piezoresistive behavior of conductive composites with nano - platelets .
most conductive nano - fillers have superior mechanical properties in comparison to the matrix .
as a consequence their deformation was neglected for a nanocomposite being subjected to mechanical strain , and conductive nano - platelets were assumed to undergo rigid body motion only .
note that nano - platelets such as graphene may be wrinkled or crumpled when dispersed in a host polymer .
the probability of being non - planar increases as the size of the nano - disk is increasing .
since this study was conducted for small - size nano - disks , it was assumed that disks remain planar during dispersion and mechanical loading .
further work may be conducted to evaluate the effect of wrinkling and bending on the nanocomposite electrical behavior .
the new position and orientation of the nano - platelets in the deformed matrix ( for uniaxial tensile strain ) were determined using affine transformation utilizing the formulation developed by pham [ 43 ] .
filler reorientation and displacement inside the polymer matrix is also governed by lateral mechanical strain , which is induced by poisson 's ratio effects .
for numerical simulations the poisson 's ratio was set at 0.33 , which was found to be the mean value reported in the literature for the poisson 's ratio of nano - platelet based conductive composites .
a 3d resistor network was then re - developed for the updated nano - platelet structure , and aforementioned finite element modeling was employed to evaluate the conductivity of the strained nano - composite .
3. results and discussion the computational code for the monte carlo simulation was developed in the fortran language to numerically investigate the 3d continuum percolation problem of conductive nano - disks .
considering the high computational cost of the monte carlo simulation , multiple processor computation was employed to allow for rapid code execution on a linux cluster .
the developed model was evaluated numerically considering a polymer matrix such as epoxy containing conductive nano - disk filler comprised of graphene platelets .
hence a constant nano - disk thickness of 0.34 nm was assumed , which is equal to the thickness of a single graphene layer [ 44 ] .
considering the high conductivity of graphene predicted by experimental and numerical studies [ 45 ] , it can reasonably be said that tunneling resistance dominates the conductivity properties of graphene nanocomposites .
hence , the electrical potential difference across graphene sheets was herein assumed negligible compared to the potential drop in the tunneling resistors .
ignoring the resistivity of the nano - disks in the present model also resulted in a considerable decrease in computational cost .
the rve size was set to be eight times 2r + dt , which was found large enough to minimize any errors introduced by finite size effects ( dt and r are the tunneling cutoff distance and nano - disk radius , respectively ) .
3.1 .
effective electron tunneling distance as discussed earlier , a cut - off distance can be assumed at which the effect of tunneling resistors with length greater than this distance is negligible .
the conductivity of nanocomposites was evaluated for different values of electron tunneling distance .
considering the results shown in figure 5 it was concluded that for a barrier height of 0.5 ev ( for epoxy polymer [ 42 ]) , tunneling resistors with length greater than 2 nm have no appreciable contribution to the conductivity of the nanocomposite .
it the present study the tunneling distance was , thus , assumed to be 2.5 nm. this value is conservatively larger than values given in the literature ( e.g. , 1.4 nm in [ 46 ]) , ensuring that essentially all tunneling paths that may contribute toward nanocomposite conductivity have been taken into account .
3.2 .
effect of matrix electrical properties on nano - composite conductivity it was stated previously that the polymer matrix chiefly affects the electrical resistivity of a nano - composite , especially for lower filler volume fractions .
as such , the contribution of matrix electrical properties , i.e. , the barrier height lambda should be investigated .
electrical resistivity was evaluated for three different barrier heights , i.e. , 0.5 , 1.5 and 2.5 ev , representing typical values reported as height of barrier for epoxy [ 42 ] filled with randomly dispersed nano - platelets .
results illustrated by figure 6 indicate that the matrix barrier height strongly affects the nano - composite conductivity .
for example , for a filler volume fraction of 7.5 % the electrical resistivity of a nano - composite with lambda = 1.5 ev is more than two orders of magnitude greater than for a matrix with lambda = 0.5 ev .
3.3 .
percolation threshold and electrical conductivity figure 7 illustrates the resistivity of nanocomposites with respect to changes in nano - disks volume fraction .
a critical volume fraction is recognizable at which a sharp drop in nanocomposite resistivity occurs .
this region was considered the formation of a percolation network .
balberg et al .
[ 47 ] showed that tunneling percolation conductivity yields a staircase effect in both lattice and continuum percolation systems .
they also reported that the existence of the staircase percolation behavior is validated by experimental data [ 1,47 - 53 ] .
based on these findings the resistivity / filler - loading curves cannot be described by a single percolation threshold and critical exponent .
in other words , equation ( 1 ) cannot adequately describe any given set of resistivity / volume - fraction data , and each subset of data should be described with different values of s and vp. the present study confirmed that a single expression with specific values of s and vp is insufficient to represent the entire nanocomposite conductivity and percolation behavior .
this is illustrated in figure 8 , where the power - law description with a universal value of s ( su = 2 ) was fitted to the resistivity data for nanocomposites with filler diameter of 20 nm. for low volume fractions the data points deviate little from the universal description , while the deviation increases with filler concentration .
interestingly , a threshold can be inferred from the curve at which the critical exponent regime changes .
findings illustrated in figure 9 are results obtained from fitting equation ( 1 ) to a data subset with interval of ( vp , 1.4vp ) .
figure 10 shows the power - law approximation for higher filler volume fractions .
as illustrated by figure 11 , fitting equation ( 1 ) to the dilute region of the curve yields values of s with small deviation from su. employing the power - law equation to describe the composite behavior for higher volume fractions , on the other hand , yields a mean value of 5.56 for the critical exponent , i.e. , s deviates strongly from su. comparing figures 9 and 10 reveals that the conductivity / filler - loading curves describe a rather smooth behavior for volume fractions well above the percolation region , while a somewhat " erratic " behavior can be observed near the percolation threshold .
assuming a single expression for the description of nanocomposite conductivity may necessitate ignoring the percolation neighborhood and considering its data outliers .
as mentioned in [ 47,54 ] , close agreement between s and su is expected to be restricted to a small region near the percolation threshold , and non - universal percolation behavior becomes dominant as the filler volume fraction is increasing .
based on the above considerations , results obtained in the present study for conductive circular nano - disks indicate a critical exponent that is filler content dependent and converges toward the universal value with filler loading approaching the percolation threshold .
this conclusion is congruent with findings from johner et al .
[ 55 ] .
data for different nano - disk sizes given in figures 9 , 10 and 12 further indicate an increasing percolation threshold and electrical conductivity with increasing nano - disks size .
note that the trendline shown in figure 12 only illustrates the data trend .
ambrosetti et al .
[ 26 ] studied the percolation threshold for hard oblate ellipsoids of revolution surrounded by a penetrable soft shell , which is analogous to the electron tunneling concept employed in the present study .
nano - disks can be assumed as spheroids where the major axis a is much larger than the minor axis b ( axis of symmetry ) .
in [ 26 ] , it was shown that the percolation threshold is governed by the ratio of the major axis to the minor axis , a / b , and the ratio of the soft shell thickness d to the major axis , d / a. in the present study , parameters a , b and d are equivalent to the nano - disk radius , thickness and tunneling distance , respectively .
as illustrated in figure 13 , percolation thresholds for different oblate radii ( i.e. , 1.25 , 1.88 , 2.92 , 5.00 , 7.10 , 11.25 nm ) were computed keeping b and d constant at 0.17 nm ( disk thickness / 2 ) and 1.25 nm ( tunneling distance / 2 ) , respectively .
disk radii were chosen to correspond to percolation thresholds provided in [ 26 ] .
critical volume fractions provided in figure 13 include the volume of the soft penetrable shell surrounding the hard oblates .
as explained previously , the soft shell is equivalent to tunneling distance concept in this study , so the volume of the soft shell has been deducted from the volume fraction provided by figure 13 using the correction factor a2b /(( a + d ) 2 ( b + d )) .
resulting percolation thresholds are given in figure 14 , which indicates an increasing percolation threshold for an increasing oblate major axis ( tunneling distance and oblates thickness are constant ) .
it worth noting that in the present study the percolation threshold was evaluated for circular nano - disks , while in [ 26 ] the percolation threshold of oblates was investigated , and results from [ 26 ] are provided herein to illustrate the qualitative agreement between trends .
in another work , lee and torquato [ 56 ] evaluated the critical area fraction for 2d circular disks with impenetrable radius of lambdar surrounded by a penetrable shell with thickness ( 1 - lambda ) r , dispersed in a 2d domain .
similar to ambrosetti 's work [ 26 ] , ( 1 - lambda ) r is equivalent to the tunneling distance used in the present study .
in [ 56 ] the critical area fraction is given in term of lambda .
in figure 15 percolation thresholds are replotted versus lambda /( 1 - lambda ) , a parameter representing the ratio of disk diameter to tunneling distance .
values for the percolation threshold were multiplied by lambda2 to exclude the area of the penetrable shell that is equivalent to the tunneling distance .
as illustrated by figure 15 , the percolation threshold increases as the ratio of disk size to the tunneling distance is increasing .
furthermore , mathew et al .
[ 28 ] showed that the dependency of platelet based conductive composite percolation threshold on the aspect ratio is in contradiction with that of needle - like fillers [ 57 - 59 ] .
in other words , trends obtained for the relation between aspect ratio and percolation threshold of needle - like fillers cannot be generalized to a platelet - like filler percolation problem .
3.4 .
piezoresistivity of nano - platelet nano - composites employing the methods described in section 2.3 , the piezoresistivity behavior of nanocomposites with nano - platelet inclusions was investigated .
simulation results shown in figure 16 for unstrained nano - composites and three applied tensile strains ( epsilon = 0.1 % , 0.3 % , 0.5 %) demonstrate an increase in resistivity with applied strain .
in figure 17 , the piezoresistivity behavior of nano - platelet based conductive composites with four different filler volume fractions is presented .
according to prediction data shown in figure 17a , nano - composites exhibit somewhat erratic piezoresistivity behavior for low filler volume fractions , while the nanocomposite piezoresistivity behavior becomes smoother with increasing filler concentration .
as mentioned above , piezoresistivity in conductive composites arises from two major mechanisms , that is , changing particle proximity and orientation .
increasing the tensile strain increases the average interparticular distance , so an increase in resistivity of the conductive nanocomposite is expected .
on the other hand , tensile strain raises the propensity for the formation of clusters , leading to a decrease in electrical resistivity .
this conjecture is supported by the results shown in figure 17b,d. for small values of mechanical strain , piezoresistivity behavior is governed by changes in interparticular distance , causing resistivity to rise approximately linearly with strain .
a critical strain can then be found at which the nanocomposite piezoresistivity behavior changes , that is , resistivity now decreases monotonically with increasing strain .
luheng et al .
[ 41 ] reported similar behavior for silicone rubber composites filled with carbon black , i.e. , a critical pressure was observed at which a change in the trend of the piezoresistivity effect occurred .
the existence of a critical pressure was also described by lu et al .
[ 60 ] for the piezoresistive behavior of polyethylene nanocomposites with exfoliated graphite .
li et al .
[ 61 ] also reported a critical strain for carbon nanotube - graphene nano - platelet hybrid composites .
as illustrated by figure 18 , the electrical resistivity increased with mechanical strain up to a critical strain upon which resistivity begins to decrease with rising strain .
the data presented in figure 17b - d further reveals an increase in critical strain for increasing filler volume fraction .
additional studies are warranted to further evaluate the effect of the governing parameters such as filler size and concentration on the critical strain .
the observed " switching behavior " and the existence of a critical strain have been reported in several other studies .
kalanadhabhatla [ 62 ] conducted a comprehensive discussion and literature review on the switching piezoresistivity behavior of conducting filler based nanocomposites .
two different kinds of piezoresistivity behavior and variations of resistivity trends have been reported in the technical literature .
some studies described negative gauge factors at the onset of tensile strain application , followed by an increase in resistivity as strain is increasing .
some nanocomposites with fillers , such as carbon black [ 63 ] , cnt [ 64,65 ] , and graphite nanosheets [ 66 ] were found to have a positive gauge factor for lower strains , while some studies reported a decreasing resistivity up to a critical strain with increasing tensile strain [ 67 - 70 ] .
the various studies devoted to piezoresistivity of conducting filler / polymer composites indicate that geometrical properties such as filler aspect ratio and filler concentration play a critical role in the piezoresistivity behavior of conductive nanocomposites .
the role of aspect ratio on piezoresistivity behavior can be comprehended by comparing the findings in [ 67,69 ] .
in [ 69 ] , graphite particles with diameters between 5 and 15 mum and thicknesses ranging from 1 to 2 mum dispersed in silicone rubber yielded a decrease in resistivity for compressive strains , while in [ 67 ] , silicone / graphite nanosheet specimens with filler thicknesses of 30 to 80 nm and aspect ratios of 100 to 500 showed an increase in resistivity .
as illustrated by figure 17 , the sensitivity of piezoresistive nanocomposites ( slope of the curve for strains lower than critical strains ) is governed by filler concentration .
in another study , kost et al .
[ 71 ] showed that carbon black based conductive composites display higher sensing sensitivity for lower filler concentrations , which is in agreement with findings in the present study .
near the percolation region there are few percolation clusters , and the formation or destruction of percolation clusters caused by strain has thus a significant contribution toward the change in nanocomposite resistivity .
it is interesting to note that for some intermediate filler volume fractions , i.e. , volume fractions between those shown in figure 17b , d , a diminished piezoresistivity effect can be observed for increasing strain as indicated by the plateau in the curve shown in figure 17c .
this behavior can be explained considering aforementioned piezoresistivity mechanisms in conductive nano - composites , that is , at strain levels within the plateau region none of the two - piezoresistivity mechanisms is dominant ; thus their effects cancel each other , leading to diminutive piezoresistivity behavior .
4. conclusions using a combined monte carlo and finite element modeling framework a theoretical study was carried out to investigate the electrical conductivity and piezoresistivity behavior of nano - composites filled with conductive nano - platelets such as graphene .
the power law relationship describing the conductivity of such polymers for filler volume fractions greater than the percolation threshold was investigated and discussed .
the critical exponent was approximately constant for all of the nano - disk sizes considered herein , which led to the conclusion that the exponent is controlled by filler geometry rather than size .
in addition , the critical exponent in the power law description depends on the filler volume fraction .
near the percolation threshold , the exponent was found to match the often - cited value of 2 , whereas the exponent deviates from this value for higher filler loadings .
modeling results further indicate a reduction in percolation threshold for decreasing nano - disks sizes and a strong effect of matrix electrical properties , i.e. , the barrier height of the insulator .
the investigation of the piezoresistivity behavior was performed through affine transformation .
the filler volume fraction was found to play an important role in the piezoresitivity behavior .
an erratic piezoresistivity behavior was observed for low filler volume fractions just exceeding the percolation threshold .
for higher volume fractions an approximately linear correlation with strain was predicted up to a critical strain at which the resistivity behavior was found to change .
for strains higher than the critical strain a monotonic decrease in electrical resistivity was observed .
overall , values of the critical strain were observed to rise with increasing filler volume fraction .
consequently , piezoresistivity behavior of nano - platelet based conductive composites can be tailored by adjusting the conductive filler content .

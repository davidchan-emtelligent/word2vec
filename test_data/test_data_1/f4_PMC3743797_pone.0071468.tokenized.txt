recently matrix metalloproteinase - 9 ( mmp - 9 ) and its endogenous inhibitor ( tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase - 1 , timp - 1 ) have been implicated in complicated malaria .
in vivo , mice with cerebral malaria ( cm ) display high levels of both mmp - 9 and timp - 1 , and in human patients timp - 1 serum levels directly correlate with disease severity .
in vitro , natural haemozoin ( nhz , malarial pigment ) enhances monocyte mmp - 9 expression and release .
the present study analyses the effects of nhz on timp - 1 regulation in human adherent monocytes .
nhz induced timp - 1 mrna expression and protein release , and promoted tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 production .
blocking antibodies or recombinant cytokines abrogated or mimicked nhz effects on timp - 1 , respectively .
p38 mapk and nf - kappab inhibitors blocked all nhz effects on timp - 1 and pro - inflammatory molecules .
still , total gelatinolytic activity was enhanced by nhz despite timp - 1 induction .
collectively , these data indicate that nhz induces inflammation - mediated expression and release of human monocyte timp - 1 through p38 mapk - and nf - kappab - dependent mechanisms .
however , timp - 1 induction is not sufficient to counterbalance nhz - dependent mmp - 9 enhancement .
future investigation on proteinase - independent functions of timp - 1 ( i.e. cell survival promotion and growth / differentiation inhibition ) is needed to clarify the role of timp - 1 in malaria pathogenesis .

introduction as a consequence of the global eradication program launched by charity foundations [ 1 ] , world health organization ( who ) officially registered in 2010 a decline in estimated malaria cases and deaths , with 655,000 deaths counted among more than 200 million clinical cases worldwide , of which 91 % were due to plasmodium falciparum [ 2 ] .
nevertheless , malaria remains an alarming emergency in developing countries , with the vast majority of cases occurring in the african region ( 81 %) and south - east asia ( 13 %) [ 2 ] .
thus it is imperative to investigate new anti - malarial drugs for primary and adjuvant therapy [ 3 ] and identify new affordable markers for early diagnosis of malaria .
human matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) are a family of proteolytic enzymes involved in wide variety of biological functions including modulation of inflammatory response , disruption of inter - endothelial tight junctions , and degradation of sub - endothelial basal lamina [ 4 ] - [ 7 ] .
as such , they are good candidate molecules and indeed there is growing evidence that mmps play critical roles in malaria in both animal and human disease models ( see [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] for more extensive reviews ) .
notably , malarial pigment ( nhz , natural haemozoin ) , a waste product of haemoglobin digestion by plasmodium parasites , induces mmp - 9 release from human monocytes [ 11 ] - [ 14 ] and endothelial cells [ 9 ] , [ 15 ] - [ 16 ] , and synthetic hz ( shz ) interacts with prommp - 9 priming its activation by mmp - 3 [ 17 ] .
endogenous inhibitors of mmps ( timps , tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ) represent one mode of mmp regulation [ 18 ] ; however , their involvement in malaria has been scarcely investigated , and their role remains debated .
a few lines of evidence from animal and human models support the involvement of timps in malaria .
cm - sensitive mice infected with p. berghei anka display increased mrna expression of timp - 1 in the brain , and both timp - 1 and - 3 mrna is increased in the liver and spleen , whilst mrna levels of timp - 2 and - 4 remain unchanged [ 19 ] .
increased serum levels of timp - 1 are also found in rhesus macaques ( macaca mulatta ) experimentally infected with p. coatneyi , a simian malaria parasite that closely mimics the biological characteristics of p. falciparum and replicates the multisystemic dysfunction of human severe malaria [ 20 ] .
human patients with severe or uncomplicated malaria have higher serum timp - 1 levels compared to healthy controls suggesting timp - 1 may be a valuable marker of disease severity [ 21 ] .
however , the cellular source of timp - 1 and the mechanisms underlying timp - 1 enhancement are as of yet unidentified .
additionally , it is imperative to assess whether increased cm - associated timp - 1 levels are sufficient to counterbalance nhz - enhanced mmp - 9 .
endothelial cells and monocytes are both producers of inducible timp - 1 protein [ 22 ] - [ 23 ] , and their phenotype and functions can be directly affected by malarial products such as infected red blood cells ( irbcs ) and nhz [ 9 ] .
however , it is unlikely that endothelium is the timp - 1 source in malaria , as neither irbcs nor nhz affect timp - 1 protein release from human microvascular endothelial cells [ 15 ] - [ 16 ] .
here we investigate the in vitro effects of nhz on human monocyte timp - 1 gene expression and protein release , the responsible soluble mediators , the signaling pathways involved , and the net gelatinolytic activity resulting from the altered mmp - 9 / timp - 1 balance .

cultivation of plasmodium falciparum and isolation of nhz plasmodium falciparum parasites ( palo alto strain , mycoplasma - free , lps - free ) were kept in culture as described [ 25 ] .
after centrifugation at 5,000g on a discontinuous percoll - mannitol density gradient , nhz was collected from the 0 - 40 % interphase .
nhz was washed five times with 10 mm hepes ( ph 8.0 ) containing 10 mm mannitol at 4degreesc and once with phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) .
nhz was treated with dnase to remove any adhering nuclear material as previously described [ 26 ] .
nhz was stored at 20 % ( v / v ) in pbs at - 20degreesc or immediately used for opsonization and phagocytosis .
preparation and handling of monocytes human monocytes were separated by ficoll centrifugation [ 11 ] from freshly collected buffy coats discarded from blood donations by healthy adult donors of both sexes provided by the local blood bank ( avis , associazione volontari italiani sangue , torino , italy ) .
separated lympho / monocytes were resuspended in rpmi medium and plated on six - well plates .
each well received 8x106 cells .
the plates were incubated in a humidified co2 / air - incubator at 37degreesc for 60 min .
thereafter , non - adherent cells were removed by three washes with rpmi and remaining adherent cells (~ 1x106 monocytes / well ) were again incubated at 37degreesc overnight .
shortly before starting phagocytosis , wells were washed with rpmi and panserin 601 monocyte medium was added ( 2 ml / well ) .
pre - selection of nf - kappab - non - activated monocytes by facs analysis and real time rt - pcr before starting experiments , a pre - selection of cell populations was taken as a precautionary measure , as previously described [ 13 ] .
briefly , cell cultures isolated through ficoll separation were analyzed by flow cytometry .
only cell populations showing at least 70 % monocytes were used for following experiments .
additionally , in order to avoid the use of nf - kappab pre - activated monocytes , cells were analyzed by real time rt - pcr : in each cell preparation a cell aliquot was stimulated or not with lps ( 1 microg / ml ) for 4 h , and tnf - alpha rna production measured in lysates by real time rt - pcr .
glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( gapdh ) was used as housekeeping gene .
only unstimulated monocyte populations ( nf - kappab - non - activated cells ) showing at least a 3 - pcr - cycles gap of cdna amplification between controls and lps - stimulated cells were used for the subsequent experiments .
cell culturing experimental conditions : phagocytosis of nhz or latex particles and treatment with blocking antibodies , recombinant pro - inflammatory molecules , or cell signalling chemical inhibitors phagocytosis assay was performed as previously described [ 27 ] .
briefly , nhz ( 120 nmoles hz haem , an amount comparable to 50 microl trophozoites on haem content basis ) and 50 microl amine - modified latex particles ( 2.5 % solids , diameter 0.105 microm ) were added to each well of a six - well plate containing the same amounts of human adherent monocytes (~ 1x106 cells / well ) .
nhz and latex particles were opsonized with fresh autologous serum .
after opsonization , all phagocytic meals were suspended in panserin 601 monocyte medium .
the plates were centrifuged at low speed for 5 s to start phagocytosis and incubated in a humidified co2 / air - incubator at 37degreesc for 2 h - a time period maximizing phagocytosis but not sufficient to induce haem - oxygenase - mediated degradation of ingested haem [ 28 ] .
cells were checked by optical microscopy : as an average , nhz - containing monocytes were 25 - 35 % among the total cells , a percentage similar to in vivo levels measured in patients with severe malaria showing high parasitaemia [ 29 ] .
additionally , the amount of nhz phagocytosed by monocytes was quantified by luminescence : as an average , each monocyte ingested nhz equivalent to ~ 8 - 10 trophozoites in term of ingested haem , in line with previous results from our group [ 30 ] .
thereafter , non - ingested nhz and latex particles were removed by four washes with rpmi .
the plates were then incubated in panserin 601 medium in a humidified co2 / air - incubator at 37degreesc for the indicated times .
in selected experiments , unfed and nhz - fed monocytes were incubated for the indicated times with 30 ng / ml anti - htnf - alpha , anti - hil - 1beta or anti - hmip - 1alpha / ccl3 blocking antibodies ; 20 ng / ml rhtnf - alpha , rhil - 1beta or rhmip - 1alpha / ccl3 ; 10 microm sb203580 , 15 microm quercetin , 10 microm artemisinin , or 10 microm parthenolide , dissolved in dmso ( final solvent concentration less than 0.1 % v / v ) .
complimentary co - culturing experiments with unfed and nhz - fed monocytes were also performed using six - well plate transwell systems with 0.4 microm of porosity ( see figure s2a - b ) .
briefly , monocytes ( 0,5x106 cells / transwell ) were seeded in transwells ( provisionally placed in cell - free wells ) and fed with nhz for 2h .
thereafter , transwells with nhz - fed monocytes were moved into new wells containing unfed monocytes ( 1x106 cells / well ) and incubated for 2 h , a time previously shown to be sufficient to induce early production of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , mip - 1alpha / ccl3 from nhz - fed cells [ 25 ] , [ 31 ] .
as negative and positive controls , respectively , unfed monocytes were also left unfed or fed with nhz for 2 h. then nhz and transwells with nhz - fed monocytes were removed .
after washing and adding fresh medium , cells were incubated in panserin 601 medium in a humidified co2 / air - incubator for 24 h before collecting supernatants for subsequent analyses .
cytotoxicity studies by lactate dehydrogenase assay the potential cytotoxic effects of phagocytic meals ( nhz and latex ) and treatments ( anti - htnf - alpha , anti - hil - 1beta and anti - hmip - 1alpha / ccl3 antibodies ; rhtnf - alpha , rhil - 1beta and rhmip - 1alpha / ccl3 ; sb203580 , quercetin , artemisinin , and parthenolide ) were measured as the release of lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) from cells into the extracellular medium ( see figure s1a - b ) .
briefly , human adherent monocytes were left unfed or fed with phagocytic meals for 2 h ; after washings , unfed and fed cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or in the absence of each one of the above mentioned treatments .
then , 1 ml of cell supernatants was collected and centrifuged at 13000 g for 2 min .
cells were washed with fresh medium , detached with trypsin / ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) ( 0.05 / 0.02 % v / v ) , washed with pbs , resuspended in 1 ml of trap ( 82.3 mm triethanolamine , ph 7.6 ) , and sonicated on ice with a 10 s burst .
5 microl of cell lysates and 50 microl of cell supernatants were diluted with trap and supplemented with 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 0.25 mm nadh ( 300 microl as a final volume ) to start the reaction .
the reaction was followed measuring the absorbance at 340 nm ( 37degreesc ) with a microplate reader .
both intracellular and extracellular enzyme activities were expressed as micromol of oxidized nadh / min / well .
finally , cytotoxicity was calculated as the net ratio between extracellular and total ( intracellular + extracellular ) ldh activities .
cell viability was calculated as the net ratio between intracellular and total ldh activities .
measurement of timp - 1 mrna levels by real time rt - pcr after the end of phagocytosis , monocytes ( 1x106 cells / well ) were further incubated with panserin 601 monocyte medium in a humidified co2 / air - incubator at 37degreesc for 15 h. total cellular rna from 2x106 cells ( contained in 2 wells ) was isolated from monocytes by trizol , according to the manufacturer 's instructions , and eluted in 20 microl diethyl pyrocarbonate water .
to remove any contaminating dna , rna was treated with ambion 's dna - free kit .
subsequently , 6 microg of rna were reverse transcribed into single - stranded cdna using m - mlv ( 200 u / microl final concentration ) and oligo - dt ( 25 microg / microl final concentration ) .
real time rt - pcr analysis was performed with the icycler instrument and the icycler iq real time detection system software version 3.0 as previously described [ 11 ] .

gapdh ( genbank accession no. bc020308 ) was used as housekeeping gene ; primer sequences were from the bio - rad library : forward : 5 ' - gaa ggt gaa ggt cgg agt - 3 ' and reverse : 5 ' - cat ggg tgg aat cat att gga a - 3 ' .
for each 25 microl pcr reaction mix : 1 microl cdna ( corresponding to 105 cells ) ; 1.0 microl sense primer ( 10 microm ) ; 1.0 microl anti - sense primer ( 10 microm ) ; 0.5 microl dntp ( 10 mm ) ; 1.5 microl mgcl2 ( 50 mm ) ; 1.25 u platinum taq dna polymerase ; 2.5 microl buffer ( 10x ) ; 1.7 microl sybr green ( stock 1:10,000 ) ; and 14.55 microl pcr - grade water were mixed together .
dna polymerase was pre - activated for 2 min at 94degreesc .
timp - 1 amplification was performed by 50 cycles with denaturation at 54degreesc for 30 s , annealing at 57degreesc for 40 s and extension at 72degreesc for 30 s ; gapdh amplification was performed by 40 cycles with denaturation at 94degreesc for 30 s , annealing at 65degreesc for 30 s and extension at 72degreesc for 30 s for gapdh .
relative quantification for timp - 1 , expressed as fold variation over untreated control cells , was calculated with the efficiency - corrected quantification model [ 32 ] after determining the difference between ct of the given gene a ( timp - 1 ) and that of the calibrator gene b ( gapdh ) .
ct values are means of triplicate measurements .
to validate the use of the method we tested serial dilutions of cdna from monocytes , stimulated for 15 h by 20 ng / ml rhtnf - alpha .
the specificity of pcr was confirmed by melt curve analysis .
the melting temperatures for each amplification product were 87.4degreesc for timp - 1 and 86.5degreesc for gapdh .
assay of timp - 1 protein levels by western blotting after the end of phagocytosis , monocytes ( 1x106 cells / well ) were further incubated with panserin 601 monocyte medium in a humidified co2 / air - incubator at 37degreesc for 24 h. thereafter , 15 microl of cell supernatants were separated on a 12 % polyacrylamide denaturing gel , transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane , and probed with monoclonal anti - timp - 1 antibodies .
after staining with secondary anti - mouse hrp - conjugated antibodies , bands were visualized by ecl staining .
densitometric analysis of the bands considered to reflect total protein levels was performed using a computerized densitometer with protein levels presented in relative units compared to background .
measurement of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , mip - 1alpha / ccl3 , mmp - 9 and timp - 1 production by elisa after the end of phagocytosis , monocytes ( 1x106 cells / well ) were further incubated with panserin 601 monocyte medium in a humidified co2 / air - incubator at 37degreesc up to 24 h. cell supernatants were collected 6 h , 15 h and 24 h after phagocytosis .
the levels of soluble tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , mip - 1alpha / ccl3 , mmp - 9 and timp - 1 were assayed in 100 microl of monocyte supernatants by specific elisa .
standard calibration curves were generated with rhtnf , rhil - 1beta , rhmip - 1alpha / ccl3 , rhmmp - 9 and rhtimp - 1 according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
assay of total gelatinolytic activity by a fluorogenic gelatin conversion assay after phagocytosis , monocytes ( 1x106 cells / well ) were further incubated with panserin 601 monocyte medium in a humidified co2 / air - incubator at 37degreesc for 24 h. thereafter , the total gelatinolytic activity [ the net overall activity of gelatinases ( mmp - 2 and mmp - 9 ) and their inhibitors ( timp - 2 and timp - 1 , respectively )] , was measured in cultured supernatants using dq - gelatin as recently described [ 33 ] .
briefly , dq - gelatin was dissolved at a stock concentration of 1 mg / ml in pure water .
serial dilutions of the samples were prepared in a black microtiter plate , and dq - gelatin was added at a final dilution of 2.5 microg / ml in 50 mm tris / hcl ph 7.6 , 150 mm nacl , 5 mm cacl2 , 0.01 % tween - 20 .
immediately thereafter , the plate was placed in the fluorescence reader and fluorescence measured every 10 min for 2 h at 37degreesc ( ex .
485 nm / em .
530 nm ) .
as a standard , serial dilutions of recombinant mmp - 9 activated by mmp - 3 were included in each plate .
the results were expressed as gelatinolytic activity units per ml , with 1 unit corresponding to 37 ng / ml activated rhmmp - 9 .
statistical analysis for each set of experiments , data are shown as means + sem ( real time rt - pcr , densitometry , elisa and fluorogenic gelatin conversion assay ) or as a representative image ( western blotting ) of three independent experiments with similar results .
all data were analyzed by a one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) followed by tukey 's post - hoc test ( software : spss 16.0 for windows , spss inc. , chicago , il ) .
results nhz induces timp - 1 mrna expression and protein release in human adherent monocytes human adherent monocytes ( 1x106 / well ) were left unfed ( control cells , ctr ) , fed with latex as a control meal ( latex - fed ) , or fed with nhz ( nhz - fed ) for 2 h. at the end of phagocytosis cells were washed and incubated for 15 h. thereafter , mrna was extracted and timp - 1 expression was measured by real time rt - pcr ( figure 1a ) .
nhz enhanced > 50 - fold timp - 1 mrna expression compared to ctr , while latex particles did not significantly alter basal timp - 1 mrna levels .
alternatively , to evaluate timp - 1 protein secretion , monocytes were washed and incubated for 24 h after phagocytosis , with cell supernatants collected at selected time - points ( 0 , 6 , 15 , and 24 h ) during the incubation .
timp - 1 protein levels were evaluated by western blotting and densitometry ( 24 h end - point studies , figure 1b ) and by elisa ( 0 - 24 h time course studies , figure 1c ) .
timp - 1 protein release was induced de novo in nhz - fed cells , whereas western blotting analysis did not detect apparent levels of timp - 1 in 24 h supernatants of ctr and latex - fed cells .
to verify these results , we used a more sensitive elisa assay to examine levels of timp - 1 at earlier time - points .
over time , ctr cells released low levels of timp - 1 protein ( up to ~ 3,5 ng / ml at the end of the 24 h observational period ) , which were significantly increased upon nhz treatment in the nhz - fed cells at 15 h and 24 h post phagocytosis ( up to ~ 10,5 ng / ml at the end of the 24 h observational period ) .
notably , nhz and latex did not display any cytotoxic effects on monocytes , and did not affect cell viability ( see figure s1a - b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0071468.g001 figure 1 nhz induces timp - 1 mrna expression and protein release in human adherent monocytes .
cells were left unfed ( ctr ) , fed with latex , or fed with nhz for 2 h. subsequently , monocytes were washed and incubated for 15 h , and timp - 1 mrna levels were measured in cell lysates by real time rt - pcr ( panel a ) ; alternatively , monocytes were washed and incubated for 24 h , and timp - 1 protein levels were evaluated in 24 h cell supernatants by western blotting and densitometry ( panel b ) or in 6 , 15 , and 24 h cell supernatants by elisa ( panel c ) .
data are indicated as mean values + sem or as a representative blot of three independent experiments .

panel c : vs ctr cells ( black circled line ) * p < 0.0001 .
we next questioned whether nhz - fed monocytes could modulate timp - 1 secretion from unfed cells .
to address this possibility , we co - cultured both unfed and nhz - fed monocytes in six - well plate transwell systems with 0.4 microm of porosity , plating unfed monocytes ( 1x106 cells / well ) at the bottom of the wells and seeding nhz - fed human adherent monocytes ( 0,5x106 cells / well ) onto the inserts .
co - cultures were incubated for 2 h before removal of the inserts .
after washing , unfed monocytes were further incubated for 24 h. then , cell supernatants were collected and analysed for timp - 1 secretion .
results ( see figure s2a ) show that unfed monocytes co - cultured with nhz - fed monocytes secrete higher amounts of timp - 1 than control cells , albeit significantly lower in comparison to the amounts released by nhz - fed cells cultured alone .
role of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 in nhz - dependent timp - 1 induction protein levels of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 released from ctr , latex - fed and nhz - fed monocytes ( 1x106 / well ) were measured over 24 h post phagocytosis by elisa ( figure 2 ) .
during the observational period , ctr and latex - fed cells released low amounts of all three pro - inflammatory molecules in a time - dependent manner , reaching less than 5 ng / ml tnf - alpha and less than 3 ng / ml il - 1beta or mip - 1alpha / ccl3 at 24 h as evaluated for both conditions .
no significant differences between ctr and latex - fed cells were found .
after phagocytosis of nhz , the production of pro - inflammatory molecules was significantly higher than in ctr or latex - fed cells , reaching ~ 15 ng / ml tnf - alpha and ~ 12 ng / ml il - 1beta and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 at 15 h , as well as ~ 22 ng / ml tnf - alpha or il - 1beta and ~ 15 ng / ml mip - 1alpha / ccl3 at 24 h .

as a next step , a double blocking and mimicking approach was used to investigate the role of il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 ( alone or combined ) in the nhz - dependent induction of timp - 1 mrna expression and protein release ( figure 3 ) .

thereafter , cells were incubated for 15 h ( mrna studies , panels a - b ) or 24 h ( protein studies , panels c - d ) in the presence / absence of the following treatments : single or combined doses ( 30 ng / ml ) of anti - htnf - alpha , anti - hil - 1beta and anti - hmip - 1alpha / ccl3 blocking antibodies ( panels a and c , blocking approach ) ; and single or combined doses ( 20 ng / ml ) of rhtnf - alpha , rhil - 1beta and rhmip - 1alpha / ccl3 ( panels b and d , mimicking approach ) .

after the end of phagocytosis ctr and nhz - fed cells ( 1x106 / well ) were left untreated or treated with single or combined doses ( 30 ng / ml ) of anti - htnf - alpha , anti - hil - 1beta and anti - hmip - 1alpha / ccl3 blocking antibodies for 15 - 24 h. we analyzed timp - 1 mrna expression and protein release by real time rt - pcr in cell lysates ( 15 h ) and western blotting in cell supernatants ( 24 h ) , respectively .
the effects of nhz on either mrna expression or protein release were reduced by single blocking antibodies , and were fully abrogated by the combination of all three antibodies ( panels 3a and 3c ) .
neither basal timp - 1 mrna nor timp - 1 protein levels in ctr cells were affected by any treatments with blocking antibodies and by non - immune ig used as a negative control ( data not shown ) .
alternatively , after the end of phagocytosis ctr and nhz - fed cells were left untreated or treated with single or combined doses ( 20 ng / ml ) of rhtnf - alpha , rhil - 1beta and rhmip - 1alpha / ccl3 .
again , timp - 1 mrna expression and protein release were analyzed as previously indicated .
the effects of nhz on either mrna expression or protein release were only partially mimicked by adding the single recombinant molecules to ctr cells , whereas they were fully recapitulated by the simultaneous addition of all three recombinant molecules ( panels 3b and 3d ) .
none of treatments with recombinant molecules further induced timp - 1 mrna or protein levels in nhz - fed cells , possibly because a plateau was already reached after nhz phagocytosis ( data not shown ). of note , blocking antibodies and recombinant molecules did not display any cytotoxic effects on monocytes and did not affect cell viability ( see figure s1a - b ) .

involvement of nf - kappab pathway in nhz - induced release of timp - 1 and pro - inflammatory molecules human adherent monocytes ( 1x106 / well ) were left unfed or fed with nhz for 2 h and then incubated for additional 24 h in the presence or absence of three inhibitory molecules which have been reported to block nf - kappab signaling at different levels : 15 microm quercetin , inhibitor of i - kappabalpha phosphorylation and subsequent degradation [ 35 ] ; 10 microm artemisinin , inhibitor of nf - kappab nuclear translocation [ 36 ] ; and 10 microm parthenolide , inhibitor of nf - kappab binding to dna [ 37 ] .
after treatment with the denoted inhibitors , cell supernatants were collected and timp - 1 release was evaluated by western blotting and subsequent densitometry , while tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 production was measured by elisa ( figure 5 , panel a : timp - 1 protein release ; panel b : pro - inflammatory molecules production ) .

thereafter , cell supernatants were collected .

nhz - induced protein release of timp - 1 , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 was abrogated by all three nf - kappab inhibitors .
quercetin , artemisinin , and parthenolide did not affect basal protein levels of timp - 1 or pro - inflammatory molecules in ctr cell supernatants ( data not shown ) .
nf - kappab inhibitors did not display any cytotoxic effects on monocytes , and did not affect cell viability ( see figure s1a - b ) .
nhz enhances total gelatinolytic activity of human monocytes despite timp - 1 induction unfed and nhz - fed monocytes ( 1x106 / well ) were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of p38 mapk or nf - kappab inhibitors .
after collection of cell supernatants 6 , 15 , and 24 h after phagocytosis , mmp - 9 and timp - 1 protein levels were quantified by elisa , and stoichiometric ratios were calculated .
both mmp - 9 and timp - 1 levels were higher in nhz - fed cell supernatants compared to unfed cells at all time - points .
however , mmp - 9 / timp - 1 stoichiometric ratios were > 1 both in unfed and nhz - fed cell supernatants ( with the exception of unfed cells at 6 h of the observational period ) , suggesting that nhz - dependent timp - 1 induction is not sufficient to counteract nhz - dependent mmp - 9 increase ( panels 6a - b ) .
we next sought to determine any overall net changes in gelatinolytic activity by employing a fluorogenic gelatin conversion assay [ 33 ] ( figure 6c ) .
consistently with data on mmp - 9 / timp - 1 stoichiometric ratios obtained by elisa , total gelatinolytic activity was enhanced after nhz phagocytosis .
as expected , p38 mapk inhibitor and nf - kappab inhibitors abrogated all nhz effects ( panels 6b - c ) .

during the incubation , cell supernatants were collected at different time - points ( 6 , 15 and 24 h ) .

it is interesting to speculate if nhz - fed monocytes can modulate timp - 1 and mmp - 9 secretion of unfed cells .
we tested this possibility by co - culturing both unfed and nhz - fed monocytes in six - well plate transwell systems and assessing changes in timp - 1 and mmp - 9 protein levels .
results show that unfed monocytes co - cultured with nhz - fed monocytes secrete higher amounts of timp - 1 and mmp - 9 compared to controls , although the levels are significantly lower compared to nhz - fed cells alone ( see figure s2b ) .
nevertheless , in all cases mmp - 9 / timp - 1 ratios were > 1 , confirming that nhz - dependent timp - 1 induction is not sufficient to counteract nhz - dependent mmp - 9 increase .
discussion timp molecules are widely distributed in the animal kingdom , with four paralogous genes encoding timp - 1 to - 4 in the human genome [ 18 ] .
timps were originally characterized as endogenous mmp inhibitors due to their ability to bind zinc in the mmp active site and thereby antagonize the effects of activated / cleaved mmps and block enzyme activity .
timps are key regulators of crucial mmp - related pathophysiological processes , such as turnover of extracellular matrix and shedding of cell surface molecules [ 38 ] .
additionally , timps have important roles in a broad spectrum of biological activities often independent of mmps , including effects on cell survival , cell growth and differentiation , cell migration , angiogenesis , and synaptic plasticity [ 39 ] - [ 40 ] .
it has only recently come to light that timps are involved in malaria disease state .
currently , our understanding of timps in malaria manifests from only a few studies showing dysregulated timp levels in different in vivo and in vitro malaria models .
in vivo , brain and spleen timp - 1 mrna levels are increased in cm - sensitive mice infected with p. berghei anka [ 19 ] .
further , increased timp - 1 serum levels are associated with severe malaria in rhesus macaques infected with p. coatneyi [ 20 ] .
moreover , in a case - control study on gabonese children , timp - 1 serum levels were significantly higher in malaria patients than in healthy controls and correlated with disease severity , suggesting a potential role for timp - 1 as a diagnostic marker [ 21 ] .
in vitro , p. falciparum - irbcs and nhz promoted timp - 2 but not timp - 1 protein release from human microvascular endothelial cells [ 15 ] - [ 16 ] .
on the other hand , in human monocytes , nhz did not affect timp - 2 production [ 41 ] , whereas no data on timp - 1 regulation by nhz were available so far .
the present work explores the effects of phagocytosed nhz on monocyte timp - 1 expression and release , and identifies cellular mechanisms and soluble mediators involved .
untreated cells , used as negative controls , express low timp - 1 mrna levels and secrete negligible timp - 1 protein , consistent with previous reports [ 23 ] , [ 42 ] .
interestingly , 15 h after phagocytosis of nhz , timp - 1 mrna expression is significantly enhanced , and higher timp - 1 protein levels are detected in cell supernatants up to 24 h post nhz phagocytosis .
the effect is specific for nhz and not due to phagocytosis per se since latex particles do not induce timp - 1 expression and secretion .
these data give insight into the molecular mechanisms that enable nhz to alter the phenotype of human monocytes .
indeed , nhz was previously shown to induce gene expression of a large number of pro - inflammatory molecules including cytokines ( il - 1beta , tnf - alpha , il - 1ra ) and chemokines ( mip - 1alpha / ccl3 , mip - 1beta / ccl4 , mcp - 1 / ccl2 , il - 8 / cxcl8 , ena - 78 / cxcl5 , groalpha / cxcl1 , grobeta / cxcl2 , grogamma / cxcl3 ) [ 43 ] .
also , nhz was reported to promote expression and release of mmp - 9 [ 11 ] - [ 13 ] and lysozyme [ 24 ] , [ 31 ] .
notably , it has been proposed that il - 1beta , tnf - alpha and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 function as soluble mediators for nhz - dependent upregulation of either mmp - 9 [ 11 ] - [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] or lysozyme [ 24 ] , [ 31 ] .
here we show that these three pro - inflammatory molecules are also involved in nhz - induced expression and release of timp - 1 .
either 15 or 24 h after phagocytosis of nhz , the levels of tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 in cell supernatants are significantly higher compared to controls .
treating with blocking antibodies directed against these three molecules abrogates the effects of nhz on monocyte timp - 1 mrna expression and protein release .
consistently , unfed cells treated with recombinant tnf - alpha , il - 1beta , and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 display timp - 1 mrna levels in lysates and timp - 1 protein levels in supernatants similar to those of nhz - fed cells .
these results are in line with previous data showing timp - 1 induction by il - 1beta [ 44 ] .
apparently , all three molecules are required in combination to obtain nhz - dependent timp - 1 induction , since only partial abrogation / emulation of nhz effects is obtained with single doses of blocking antibodies / recombinant molecules , whereas the effect is fully reached after using combined doses .
nevertheless , nhz induces a plethora of pro - inflammatory molecules [ 43 ] , some of which correlate with timp - 1 gene expression ( i.e. mcp - 1 / ccl2 , mip - 1beta / ccl4 , and rantes / ccl5 ) [ 45 ] - [ 46 ] .
therefore , the involvement of additional cytokines and chemokines as redundant soluble mediators for nhz - promoted timp - 1 expression and release cannot be excluded .
we next wanted to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying nhz - induced upregulation of timp - 1 and related pro - inflammatory molecules .
it has been previously reported that il - 1beta induces both timp - 1 and mmp - 9 in monocytes and monocytic leukemia cells [ 44 ] , [ 47 ] .
in a separate study using human monocytes , gene expression of timp - 1 , mmp - 9 and tnf - alpha , required p38 mapk and nf - kappab pathway activation [ 48 ] - [ 49 ] .
interestingly , several in vitro and in vivo studies have raised the possibility that either mapk or nf - kappab routes are involved in malaria .
to date we understand very little about nhz - dependent activation of mapks .
however , recent emerging evidence in a murine malaria model shows that nhz induces the activation of p38 [ 49 ] and erk1 / 2 [ 50 ] - [ 53 ] mapks , but does not induce the activation of other signaling pathways such as the jnk - 2 / stat pathway [ 47 ] - [ 49 ] .
evidence from a human malaria model shows nhz activates p38 mapk signaling , similar to the murine model , whilst nhz does not appear to activate the erk1 / 2 or jnk - 1 / 2 signaling pathways in the human model [ 25 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 54 ] .
interestingly , a study using syncytiotrophoblast cells shows nhz - dependent phosphorylation of erk1 / 2 , along with irbc - dependent phosphorylation of jnk - 1 , with both events being causally related to production of pro - inflammatory molecules ( tnf - alpha , mip - 1alpha / ccl3 , il - 8 / cxcl8 ) [ 55 ] - [ 56 ] .
moreover , our group recently showed intravenous injection of nhz in malaria - free mice induces an inflammatory frame similar to that observed in experimental malaria - associated acute respiratory distress syndrome , pointing to nhz as a prominent inflammatory virulent factor in lung pathology [ 26 ] .
on the other hand , plasmodium falciparum glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( pfgpi ) promotes phosphorylation of all major mapk routes , including p38 , erk1 / 2 , and jnk - 2 / stat - 1 [ 57 ] - [ 58 ] .
inhibition of pfgpi - dependent activation of mapks decreases inflammatory responses and enhances phagocytic clearance of irbcs in mice infected by plasmodium berghei or chabaudi chabaudi [ 59 ] .
future research defining the differential roles of nhz , irbcs , and gpi in regulating mapks and inflammation in malaria , both in vitro and in vivo , will be certainly welcomed .
along with nhz - dependent regulation of mapks , emerging evidence suggests malarial pigment plays a role in activating the nf - kb pathway .
in murine macrophages fed with nhz or shz , nf - kappab activation is required to upregulate expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase [ 51 ] and production of several chemokines , including mip - 1alpha / ccl3 , mip - 1beta / ccl4 , mip - 2 / cxcl2 , and mcp - 1 / ccl2 [ 52 ] .
gene expression profiling of shz - laden raw 264.7 macrophage cells display altered nf - kappab signal transduction , enhanced inflammatory response and a severe mmp - 9 / timp - 1 imbalance in favor of ecm proteolysis [ 60 ] .
nf - kappab activation is also mandatory for nhz - induced mmp - 9 expression in human thp - 1 monocyte cell line [ 61 ] and for nhz - enhanced release of mmp - 9 , lysozyme , tnf - alpha and il - 1beta from human adherent monocytes isolated from peripheral blood [ 13 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 31 ] .
consistently , in peripheral mononuclear cells of malaria patients , phospho - nf - kappab p65 levels are significantly higher than in healthy controls [ 62 ] , and genome wide expression profiles display nf - kappab - dependent enhancement of inflammatory cytokines [ 63 ] .
results from the present work suggest that nhz - induced secretion of timp - 1 and related pro - inflammatory molecules from human monocytes require the involvement of either p38 mapk - or nf - kappab - dependent mechanisms .
indeed , the effects of nhz - mediated protein release of timp - 1 , tnf - alpha , il - 1beta and mip - 1alpha / ccl3 are fully abrogated by using micromolar doses of sb203580 , a synthetic inhibitor of p38 mapk pathway [ 34 ] , or after treatment with quercetin , artemisinin and parthenolide - three molecules showing antimalarial properties [ 64 ] - [ 65 ] able to block nf - kappab pathway at different levels ( i - kappabalpha phosphorylation and subsequent degradation [ 35 ] ; nf - kappab nuclear translocation [ 36 ] ; and nf - kappab binding to dna [ 37 ] , respectively ) .
interestingly , these molecules also abrogate lysozyme and mmp - 9 release in the same cellular model [ 13 ] , [ 25 ] , [ 31 ] , [ 54 ] .
collectively , the present data show phagocytosis of nhz by human monocytes induces inflammation - mediated expression and release of timp - 1 through p38 mapk - and nf - kappab - dependent mechanisms , suggesting that in vivo nhz - fed human monocytes may be a source for the high timp - 1 serum levels found by dietmann and colleagues in malaria patients [ 21 ] .
in this context , timp - 1 levels are also related to disease severity .
however , it remains unclear how timp - 1 may exacerbate the clinical course in malaria patients .
one major function of timp - 1 is to counteract and modulate the numerous effects of mmp - 9 , which include degradation of the sub - endothelial basal lamina , modulation of the activity of several pro - inflammatory molecules , disruption of tight junctions , and impairment of haemostasis [ 4 ] - [ 7 ] ; [ 38 ] , all of which comprise key roles in cm. in this way it is attractive to hypothesize that increased timp - 1 levels are actually protective rather than a risk factor in malaria prognosis , as they could contrast the potentially detrimental effects of nhz - enhanced mmp - 9 .
however , our results show that mmp - 9 / timp - 1 stoichiometric ratios and total gelatinolytic activity measured in nhz - fed monocyte supernatants were significantly higher than in controls , arguing against timp - 1 ability to act as a protective factor in this context .
total gelatinolytic activity reflects the net overall activity of gelatinases ( mmp - 2 and - 9 ) and their endogenous inhibitors ( timp - 2 and timp - 1 , respectively ) [ 33 ] , but in the present model it should be noted that the activity is due solely to the net balance between mmp - 9 and timp - 1 , as unfed and nhz - fed human adherent monocytes do not release mmp - 2 and timp - 2 proteins [ 41 ] .
therefore , these results suggest that nhz - dependent induction of timp - 1 expression and release is not sufficient to counterbalance nhz - enhanced mmp - 9 levels released from human monocytes .
intriguingly , timp - 1 could play a detrimental role through an mmp - independent mechanism [ 39 ] - [ 40 ] .
mmp - independent roles for timp - 1 in biological processes include anti - apoptotic effects of timp - 1 in several human cells , such as burkitt 's lymphoma [ 66 ] , breast epithelial cells [ 67 ] , and cardiomyocytes [ 68 ] .
recently cd63 , a member of the tetraspanin family , was identified as a cell - binding partner for timp - 1 in human mammary epithelial cells , and cd63 down - regulation with shrna resulted in reduced timp - 1 binding and restored cell apoptosis [ 69 ] .
interestingly , nhz - fed monocytes do not undergo apoptosis , despite increased inflammation and functional impairment [ 30 ] , [ 43 ] .
cd63 is constitutively expressed by human monocytes [ 70 ] .
thus , it is intriguing to speculate that nhz - enhanced timp - 1 levels might prevent apoptosis of functionally impaired nhz - fed cells through cd63 - dependent mechanisms .
additionally , there are several reports describing mmp - independent abilities of timp - 1 to inhibit cell growth and differentiation [ 39 ] - [ 40 ] , [ 71 ] .
these timp - 1 properties may be crucial for nhz - fed monocytes , since these cells have been shown not to mature to dendritic cells [ 72 ] and not to coordinate erythropoiesis [ 73 ] .
in conclusion , the present work expands the available evidence on the expression of timps in malaria , providing new information on the mechanisms underlying nhz - dependent timp - 1 increase .
future investigation is needed to ascertain whether nhz - enhanced timp - 1 may contribute to worsen the clinical course in malaria patients as a consequence of its mmp - independent anti - apoptotic or growth / differentiation - inhibitory properties .
further , previous evidence correlating the number of circulating nhz - laden monocytes in patients to parasitaemia degree and malaria severity [ 29 ] seems to support such a hypothesis .
more extensive research on the functional role of timp - 1 in malaria , along with a better understanding of mmp - independent timp functions is necessary in order to find new tools for differential diagnosis and therapy of severe malaria .

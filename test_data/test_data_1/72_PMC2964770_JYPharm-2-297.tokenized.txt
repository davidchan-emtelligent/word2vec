a simple , fast , specific , and precise high - performance thin layer chromatography method has been developed for the estimation of monosodium l - glutamate ( msg ) in food products .
aluminum plates precoated with silica gel 60 gf254were used as stationary phase and a mixture of methanol - chloroform - formic acid in the ratio 5:5:1 ( v / v ) as mobile phase .
quantification was carried out by postchromatographic derivatization using 1 % ninhydrin solution , and the developed spots were scanned by using a densitometer in absorbance mode at 485 nm. the rfvalue of msg was 0.64 .
the results of the analysis have been validated statistically and by the recovery studies .
linearity was observed in the concentration range of 400 - 1000 ng. food products hptlc monosodium l glutamate introduction monosodium l - glutamate ( msg ) , chemically known as 2 - amino pentane dioic or 2 - amino glutaric acid , is normally used as a flavor - enhancing ingredient more commonly used in traditional asian cuisine .
this stimulates specific receptors located in taste buds such as the amino acid receptor t1r1 / t1r3or other glutamate receptors like the metabotropic receptors , which induce the taste known as umami .
only l - glutamate enantiomer has the flavor - enhancing properties .
in 1959 , the food and drug administration ( fda ) classified monosodium glutamate as a " generally recognized as safe " substance .
but in 1995 , fda commissioned report acknowledged that an unknown percentage of the population may react to monosodium glutamate and develop monosodium glutamate symptom complex , a condition characterized by the following symptoms : headache , nausea , rapid heartbeat , bronchospasm , chest pain , drowsiness , weakness , and sweating. [ 1 ] monosodium glutamate is absorbed very quickly in the gastrointestinal tract , so msg could spike blood plasma levels of glutamate. [ 2 ] this is in a class of chemicals known as excitotoxins .
high levels of which have been shown in animal studies to cause damage to areas of brain unprotected by the blood - brain barrier and that a variety of chronic diseases can arise out of this neurotoxicity. [ 34 ] spectrophotometric ,[ 56 ] derivative hplc ,[ 7 ] hplc with uv detection , fluorescence detection ,[ 89 ] gc ,[ 10 ] paper chromatography ,[ 11 ] and potentiometric methods [ 12 ] were reported for analysis of msg in food products .
in this paper , we report a new , rapid , sensitive , precise , and selective hptlc method for the determination of msg in food products .
materials and methods solvents and chemicals monosodium l - glutamate was procured from sigma - aldrich limited , india .
food products were procured commercially .
chromatographic grade solvents such as methanol , chloroform , acetone , and formic acid were obtained from qualigens chemicals , mumbai , india .
ninhydrin was procured from rankem chemicals , mumbai , india .
standard and sample solutions monosodium l - glutamate ( 100 mg ) was accurately weighed into a 100 - ml volumetric flask , dissolved in water , and the solution was diluted to volume with the same solvent to furnish a working standard .
accurately weighed sample equivalent to 1 g and transferred to a 100 - ml volumetric flask , dissolved in water ( 50 ml ) , sonicated for 15 min in an ultrasonicator , and made up to the volume with the same solvent .
the solution was then filtered through whatmann 's no .
42 filter paper .
one milliliter of the filtrate was taken in a 10 - ml volumetric flask and diluted to the volume with methanol and used for analysis .
chromatography chromatography was performed on aluminum - backed silica gel 60 gf254tlc plates prewashed with methanol .
standard solutions of msg were transferred to different 10 ml volumetric flasks and diluted to volume with the methanol such that the final concentrations were 0.4 - 1 mug / mul .
standards and three different sample solutions were applied to the tlc plates as 8 mm bands with 9 mm space between two bands using a camag linomat iv sample applicator .
plates were developed with a mobile phase of methanol - chloroform - formic acid 5 + 5 + 1 ( v / v ) in a tlc twin trough chamber .
after development , the plates were derivatized with 1 % ninhydrin solution in acetone and dried at 60degreesc for 5 min .
the quantification of the standards and samples were performed by means of a camag tlc scanner iii controlled by wincats 4.06 version software .
the amount of msg in the sample solutions were computed from the calibration plot .
results and discussion chromatography the mobile phase resolved msg very efficiently and is shown in figure 1 .
the rf value of monosodium glutamate was 0.64 .
typical absorption spectra of the derivatized monosodium glutamate was shown in figure 2 .
postderivatization of monosodium glutamate with 1 % ninhydrin solution gave an absorbance maximum at 485 nm and was selected for detection .
the method was used to determine msg content in three different food products .
the results were tabulated in table 1 .

system suitability according to the usp method ( 621 ) , system suitability tests are an integral part of a chromatographic analysis and should be used to verify that the resolution and reproducibility of the chromatographic system are adequate for the analysis .
to ascertain the effectiveness of the method developed in this study system suitability tests were performed on freshly prepared standard stock solution of msg .
linearity calibration plots of peak area against concentration of monosodium glutamate were linear in the range of 0.4 - 1.0 mug .
the calibration lines were represented by the linear regression equation y = 5627 + 13.08x where y is the peak area and x is concentration .
the correlation coefficient r was 0.9942 .
limit of quantification and detection the limit of quantification ( loq ) and limit of detection ( lod ) were calculated by use of the equations lod = 3 x n / b and loq = 10 x n / b , where n is the standard deviation of the peak area of the drug ( n = 3 ) , taken as a measure of the noise and b is the slope of the corresponding calibration curve .
the limit of quantification and the limit of detection for monosodium glutamate were 0.7 and 2.3 ng , respectively .
accuracy and precision the accuracy and precision of the method were studied by performing experiments by the standard addition technique .
accuracy of the method was determined by recovery experiments .
the recovery of the method was determined at single level by adding a known quantity of msg to the food products of preanalyzed samples , and the mixtures were reanalyzed according to the proposed method .
the average recovery obtained for monosodium glutamate for 97.0 % and is shown in table 2 .

ruggedness and robustness ruggedness is a measure of the reproducibility of a test result under normal , expected operating conditions from instrument - to - instrument and from analyst - to - analyst [ table 3 ] .
robustness of the method was determined by making slight changes in the chromatographic conditions .
no marked changes in the chromatograms demonstrated that the high - performance thin layer chromatography ( hptlc ) method developed are rugged and robust [ table 4 ] .

it can , therefore , be conveniently adopted for the routine analysis of monosodium glutamate in food products .

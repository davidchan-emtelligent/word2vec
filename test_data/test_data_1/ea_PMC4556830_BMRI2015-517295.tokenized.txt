mgcd0103 , an isotype - selective histone deacetylase inhibitor ( hdaci ) , has been clinically evaluated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors , alone and in combination with standard - of - care agents .
in order to investigate the effects of mgcd0103 on the metabolic capacity of cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) enzymes , a cocktail method was employed to evaluate the activities of human cyp2b1 , cyp1a2 , cyp2c11 , cyp2d6 , cyp3a4 , and cyp2c9 .
the rats were randomly divided into mgcd0103 group ( low , medium , and high ) and control group .
the mgcd0103 group rats were given 20 , 40 , and 80 mg / kg ( low , medium , and high ) mgcd0103 by continuous intragastric administration for 7 days .
six probe drugs , bupropion , phenacetin , tolbutamide , metoprolol , testosterone , and omeprazole , were given to rats through intragastric administration , and the plasma concentrations were determined by uplc - ms / ms. statistical pharmacokinetics difference for tolbutamide in rats were observed by comparing mgcd0103 group with control group .
continuous 7 - day intragastric administration of mgcd0103 slightly induces the activities of cyp2c11 of rats .
1. introduction cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) enzymes are essential for most biotransformation steps of xenobiotics and endogenous molecules [ 1 , 2 ] .
the cyp enzymes play a critical role in drug metabolism and the interactions between supplements and drugs [ 3 - 5 ] .
to avoid severe adverse effects from undesirable drug - drug interactions , it is highly desirable to understand the potential effects of a new chemical entity on drug - metabolizing enzymes [ 4 , 6 ] .
recently , inhibition of histone deacetylases ( hdacs ) is recognized as a novel and validated therapeutic strategy against cancer [ 7 , 8 ] .
for example , saha and fk - 228 are broad - spectrum hdac inhibitors ( hdaci ) that have been approved by fda for the treatment of refractory cutaneous t - cell lymphoma ( ctcl ) [ 9 , 10 ] .
the benzamide hdacis , such as ms - 275 and mocetinostat ( mgcd0103 ) , selectively target hdac 1 - 3 and exhibit better tolerability and efficacy in the clinical study compared with the above hdaci [ 11 , 12 ] .
mgcd0103 is an orally active benzamide hdaci currently being assessed in numerous phase i - ii trials for hematological malignancies and solid tumors in single - agent therapy or in combination with azacitidine , gemcitabine , or docetaxel [ 13 ] .
nevertheless , many hdacis including mgcd0103 have side effects , such as myelosuppression , fatigue , pneumonia , or cardiovascular toxicity .
on the other hand , undesirable drug - drug interactions also have been reported when hdaci is coadministrated with other anticancer agents [ 14 , 15 ] .
therefore , exploring the influence on cyp enzyme caused by mgcd0103 would facilitate understanding its metabolic behavior and avoid some undesirable drug - drug interactions or toxicity .
so far , no study on the effects of mgcd0103 on the metabolic capacity of cyp enzyme was reported .
therefore , in this study , six probe drugs were employed to evaluate effect of mgcd0103 on the metabolic capacity of human cyp1a2 , cyp2b6 , cyp2c19 , cyp2c9 , cyp2d6 , and cyp3a4 .
the homology of enzymes in rat is in the order of cyp1a2 , cyp2b1 , cyp2c , cyp2d4 , and cyp3a2 [ 16 , 17 ] .
the effects of mgcd0103 on rat cyp enzyme activity will be evaluated according to the changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of six specific probe drugs .

2.4 .
pharmacokinetics forty rats ( 220 +/ - 20 g ) were randomly divided into four different dosages of mgcd0103 groups ( low group , medium group , high group , and control group with 10 rats in each group ) .
mgcd0103 was dissolved in corn oil as suspension at three different concentrations ( 20 , 40 , and 80 mg / ml ) .
three different mgcd0103 groups ( low group , medium group , and high group ) were respectively given mgcd0103 20 , 40 , and 80 mg / kg one time by intragastric administration at every morning and last for 7 days .
control group were given saline by same administration method .
at 8 days morning , six probe drugs , bupropion , phenacetin , tolbutamide , metoprolol , testosterone , and omeprazole , were mixed in corn oil and given to the rats of three mgcd0103 groups and control group by intragastric administration at a single dosage of 10 mg / kg for bupropion , phenacetin , metoprolol , testosterone , and omeprazole and 1 mg / kg for tolbutamide .
blood ( 0.3 ml ) samples were collected into heparinized 1.5 ml polythene tubes from the tail vein at 0.0833 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , and 48 h after intragastric administration of six probe drugs .
100 mul of plasma was obtained from blood sample after centrifugation at 4000 g for 10 min .
in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube , 200 mul of acetonitrile ( containing 50 ng / ml is ) was added into 100 mul of collected plasma sample .
after vortex - mixing for 1.0 min , the sample was centrifuged at 13000 g for 15 min .
then supernatant ( 2 mul ) was injected into the uplc - ms / ms system for analysis .
concentration of plasma probe drugs versus time was analyzed by version 3.0 data analysis system ( wenzhou medical university , china ) .
the main pharmacokinetic parameters of the mgcd0103 group and control group were analyzed by spss l8.0 statistical software .
2.5 .
histopathology after pharmacokinetic properties analysis , rats were deeply anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate ( i.p. , 20 mg / kg ) .
the livers of control group and mgcd0103 treated groups were rapidly isolated and immersed in freshly prepared 4 % w / v formaldehyde ( 0.1 m phosphate buffer , ph 7.2 ) for 48 h and then embedded in paraffin .
then 5 mum thick histologic sections were prepared and stained with routine he method ( hematoxylin and eosin ) .
the morphological changes of liver were observed under light microscope .
3. results 3.1 .
method validation the concentrations of bupropion , phenacetin , tolbutamide , metoprolol , testosterone , and omeprazole in rat plasma were simultaneously determined by a sensitive and simple uplc - ms / ms method [ 18 ] .
the lloq for each probe drug in plasma was 2 ng / ml. the rsd of the six probe drugs was less than 15 % .
the calibration plot of the probe drugs is in the range of 2 - 2000 ng / ml ( r > 0.995 ) .
the intraday and interday accuracy ranged from 90 % to 115 % .
the matrix effects were more than 82 % or less than 113 % .
the extraction recoveries were better than 85 % .
3.2 .
pharmacokinetics the main pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion , phenacetin , tolbutamide , metoprolol , testosterone , and omeprazole calculated from noncompartment model analysis were summarized in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 .
the representative profiles of concentration of drugs ( phenacetin , metoprolol , testosterone , omeprazole , tolbutamide , and bupropion ) versus time were presented in figure 1. from table 3 , compared with the control group , no difference in pharmacokinetic behaviors can be observed between low , medium dosage group and control group .
however , the pharmacokinetic parameters of tolbutamide experienced obvious change with decreased auc ( 0 - t ) ( p < 0.05 ) and increased cl ( p < 0.05 ) after the dosage increase .
this result indicates that the 7 - day intragastric administration of mgcd0103 with high dosage slightly induces the metabolism of tolbutamide in rat .
on the other hand , no significant difference for auc , t 1 / 2 of omeprazole , phenacetin , metoprolol , testosterone , and bupropion ( p > 0.05 ) between the high dosage group and control group was observed .
tables 1 - 3 suggested that mgcd0103 was not able to induce or inhibit the activity of cyp1a2 , cyp2b1 , cyp2d4 , and cyp3a2 enzyme .
the cl of testosterone was shortened in high dosage group , but other parameters such as auc ( 0 - t ) , auc ( 0 - infinity ) , t 1 / 2 , v , and c max did not undergo changes simultaneously ; this result may be attributed to experimental error .
3.3 .
morphological changes of liver in low dose group ( figure 2 ( a )) , the hepatic lobule , central veins , and portal areas can be recognized at low magnification ; liver cells are arranged in funicular along with central veins ; the liver cells become slightly edematous .
in middle dose group ( figure 2 ( b )) , the structure of liver lobule disappeared at low magnification .
the liver cells experienced extensive fatty changes ; some of liver cells are pressed extensively ; karyopyknosis liver cells with basophilic nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm appeared at high magnification .
in high dose group ( figure 2 ( c )) , the structure of liver lobule can be recognized at low magnification .
a plenty of liver cells with steatosis and small , atrophy , hyperchromatic karyopyknosis with some dark blue fragment of nucleus in lobule were observed .
according to the pathological changes of liver at different dosage of mgcd0103 , mgcd0103 is hepatotoxic and its toxicity is dose - dependent .
4. discussion histone deacetylases ( hdacs ) remove the acetyl groups from acetylated lysines of histones and also function as transcriptional corepressors [ 19 - 21 ] .
unlike saha , mgcd0103 is a nonhydroxamate isotype - selective hdaci that targets hdac isotypes 1 - 3 and 11 [ 13 ] .
preclinical studies showed that mgcd0103 exhibited significant potent antitumor activity with low toxicity in vivo .
induction of histone acetylation in tumors by mgcd0103 has been observed to correlate with antitumor activity in mouse models with human tumor xenografts .
in general , changes in pharmacokinetics are attributed to drug - drug or drug - food interactions [ 22 ] .
in pharmacokinetic interactions , drug metabolic enzymes are considered to be the most important interactive sites for drug metabolism .
for example , a large number of drugs are metabolized by cyp enzymes in the liver , and more than 90 % of drug - drug interactions occur at the cyp enzyme - catalyzed step [ 23 , 24 ] .
similarly , supplement - drug interactions involving cyp enzyme - catalyzed metabolism are also found to cause severe adverse effect events .
for these reasons , we investigated the effects of 7 - day intragastric administration of mgcd0103 on the activity of cyp enzymes in vivo .
cyp isoforms cyp1a2 , cyp2d6 , cyp3a4 , cyp2c19 , cyp2c9 , and cyp2b6 were investigated in this study as more than 90 % of drugs are metabolized by those 6 cyp enzymes [ 25 , 26 ] .
as mgcd0103 is always administrated in combination with other drugs , interactions between mgcd0103 and other drugs would increase the risk of either diminished efficacy or adverse effects .
in our study , we found that 7 - day intragastric administration of mgcd0103 slightly induce the metabolism of tolbutamide .
this effect will result in decreased concentration of tolbutamide , which makes it hard to achieve the therapeutic effect .
tolbutamide is mainly metabolized by cyp2c11 enzyme and partly by cyp2c isoforms in the rat [ 27 ] .
rat cyp2c is homolog of human cyp2c19 and cyp2c9 .
cyp2c9 is involved in the oxidation of many drugs , such as losartan , torasemide , and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , while cyp2c19 metabolizes a number of drugs , such as clopidogrel , citalopram , lansoprazole , and propranolol [ 28 ] .
therefore , the metabolism and elimination of drugs would change if they are administrated in combination with mgcd0103 .
after the pharmacokinetic profiles evaluation by cocktail method , we also investigated the hepatotoxicity of mgcd by observing the pathological changes of liver after mgcd administration .
the pathological changes of liver were observed at three different dosages with significant changes in high dosage and small changes in low dosage .
therefore , mgcd is hepatotoxic and its toxicity is dose - dependent .
however , probe drugs were administrated to all of those rats in different groups before the pathological observation , and the probe drugs maybe cooperated with mgcd to cause hepatotoxicity .
therefore , a more systematic and comprehensive study to investigate the hepatotoxicity of mgcd will be carried out .
5. conclusion the results observed in this study would provide us with valuable information regarding the interactions of mgcd0103 with other drugs .
induction of drug metabolizing enzyme by mgcd0103 would reduce the efficacy of other drug .
additionally , concerns of hepatotoxicity of mgcd need special attention .

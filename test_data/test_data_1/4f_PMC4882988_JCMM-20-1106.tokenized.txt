abstract chronic kidney disease is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular complication and this interaction can lead to accelerated dysfunction in both organs .
renalase , a kidney - derived cytokine , not only protects against various renal diseases but also exerts cardio - protective effects .
here , we investigated the role of renalase in the progression of cardiorenal syndrome ( crs ) after subtotal nephrectomy .
sprague - dawley rats were randomly subjected to sham operation or subtotal ( 5 / 6 ) nephrectomy ( stnx ) .
two weeks after surgery , sham rats were intravenously injected with hanks' balanced salt solution ( sham ) , and stnx rats were randomly intravenously injected with adenovirus - beta - gal ( stnx + ad - beta - gal ) or adenovirus - renalase ( stnx + ad - renalase ) respectively .
after 4 weeks of therapy , ad - renalase administration significantly restored plasma , kidney and heart renalase expression levels in stnx rats .
we noticed that stnx rats receiving ad - renalase exhibited reduced proteinuria , glomerular hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis after renal ablation compared with stnx rats receiving ad - beta - gal ; these changes were associated with significant decreased expression of genes for fibrosis markers , proinflammatory cytokines and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( nadph ) oxidase components .
at the same time , systemic delivery of renalase attenuated hypertension , cardiomyocytes hypertrophy and cardiac interstitial fibrosis ; prevented cardiac remodelling through inhibition of pro - fibrotic genes expression and phosphorylation of extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) - 1 / 2 .
in summary , these results indicate that renalase protects against renal injury and cardiac remodelling after subtotal nephrectomy via inhibiting inflammation , oxidative stress and phosphorylation of erk - 1 / 2 .
renalase shows potential as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of crs in patients with chronic kidney disease .
renalase cardiorenal syndromes subtotal nephrectomy renal dysfunction cardiac remodelling national nature science foundation of china8127082481570603shanghai pujiang program15pj1406700shanghai talents development fundsource - schema - version - number2.0component - idjcmm12813cover - datejune 2016details - of - publishers - convertorconverter : wiley _ ml3gv2 _ to _ nlmpmc version : 4.9.8 mode : remove _ fc converted : 28.11.2016 introduction recently , it has been increasingly recognized that primary disorder of kidney will induce or worsen pathological injuries in heart , which in turn can lead to accelerated organ dysfunction in both systems .
this phenomenon has been defined as chronic renocardiac syndrome or type 4 cardiorenal syndrome ( crs ) 1 .
clinical studies demonstrated that patients with primary chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) show higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases ( cvd ) and a 10 - to 20 - fold increased risk of cardiac death compared with that of the general population 2 , 3 .
however , there are still no effective strategies for treatment of crs for now .
thus , it is urgent to identify underlying mechanisms of crs progression for developing novel therapy .
although the exact pathophysiology mechanisms underlying this bidirectional cardiorenal crosstalk are not fully elucidated yet , traditional risks in ckd such as humoural and haemodynamic disturbance and activation of renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system and sympathetic nerve system ( sns ) may contribute to the pathogenesis of cvd 4 , 5 .
recently , it has been suggested that abnormalities in bone - mineral axis and deficiency of erythropoietin ( epo ) or klotho may directly aggravate cardiac hypertrophy and participate in the pathogenesis of worsening of renal function and cardiovascular complication 6 , 7 .
therefore , special emphasis should be placed on the endocrine function of kidney 8 .
the reduction or loss of epo , calcitriol or klotho and yet - to - be known kidney - derived hormones or cytokines as a result of renal dysfunction may be potential mechanisms of crs 9 .
renalase , a recently discovered flavoprotein from kidney , can regulate blood pressure by degrading circulatory catecholamines 10 .
our previous reports demonstrated that renalase is up - regulated during various stresses including hypoxia , ischaemia / reperfusion and oxidative stress 11 , 12 , 13 .
administration of recombinant renalase protects against aki , contrast - induced nephropathy and cardiac ischaemia / reperfusion injury 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 .
clinical studies showed that renalase deficiency or single - nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with essential hypertension , cardiac hypertrophy , stroke and diabetes 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 .
recently , mounting evidence suggested that renalase exerts its cytoprotective effects by interacting with its plasma membrane receptor other than metabolizing catecholamines 21 , 22 , 23 .
thus , renalase may serve as a cytokine that regulates kidney function in autocrine or paracrine manner 24 .
nevertheless , whether renalase supplementation could prevent the progression of renal injury and occurrence of remote organ injury in ckd and its mechanisms still remain unknown .
western blot analyses demonstrated that plasma renalase concentration in ckd patients is substantially decreased in comparison to healthy population 10 .
however , several clinical studies using elisa reported opposite results 25 , 26 .
these opposite results may be inaccurate because of a not validated antibody used in the commercially kit which would non - specifically recognize renalase breakdown products or unrelated epitopes 27 .
consistently , renalase deficiency is also present in rats subjected to subtotal nephrectomy 28 .
thus , it is reasonable to speculate that renalase may be also a crucial kidney - derived modulator for crs progression .
in present study , we examined the effects of renalase supplementation by an adenovirus delivery on the progression of type 4 crs in a rat subtotal nephrectomy model .
furthermore , the potential mechanisms mediating renalase 's protective effects were also investigated .
material and methods construction of adenovirus vectors the replication - deficient recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing the rat renalase mrna sequence or beta - galactosidase ( beta - gal ) were generated respectively , under the control of the cytomegalovirus enhancer / promoter .
these adenoviruses were amplified in hek - 293a cells and purified by cscl ultracentrifugation and store at - 80degreesc in hanks' balanced salt solution ( hbss ) with a concentration of 1.0 x 1010 plaque formation unit ( pfu )/ ml. animal all the animal experiments were approved by the animal care and ethics committee of shanghai jiao tong university affiliated sixth people 's hospital .
male sprague - dawley rats were provided by shanghai science academy animal center .
all the rats were housed in a 12 / 12 hrs light / dark cycle with free access to water and fed with standard rat chow .
rat model of ckd and experimental protocols male sprague - dawley rats weighing 200 - 250 g , after 7 - day adaption period , were randomly allocated to either sham - operated group or 5 / 6 subtotal nephrectomy group .
the animals were anaesthetized by intraperitoneally injection of sodium pentobarbital ( 50 mg / kg ) and two - stage subtotal nephrectomy was performed as previously described 29 .
briefly , the upper and lower poles of the left kidney were resected and bleeding was controlled .
one week later , the right kidney was removed after ligation of the renal blood vessels and the ureter .
the sham - operated rats underwent the same procedures , but only the envelope capsule was removed .
two weeks after surgery , the rats were further randomly divided into following groups : ( i ) sham - operated treated with tail vein injection of 1.2 ml hbss ( sham , n = 10 ) ; ( ii ) subtotal nephrectomy treated with tail vein injection of 1.2 x 1010 pfu control adenovirus ( stnx + ad - beta - gal , n = 10 ) ; ( iii ) subtotal nephrectomy treated with tail vein injection of 1.2 x 1010 pfu adenovirus - renalase ( stnx + ad - renalase , n = 10 ) .
the effect of renalase gene delivery on crs was assessed 4 weeks after adenovirus injection ( corresponding to week 6 of ckd ) .
at the end of the experiment , all the rats were kept 24 hrs in metabolic cages for urine collection and echocardiography was also examined during the last week .
then all the animals were killed and blood as well as kidney and heart tissues were harvested for analyses .
renal function assessment blood samples were collected from abdominal aorta and centrifuged to obtain plasma and then separated into aliquots and stored at - 20degreesc .
blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) and urinary creatinine and proteinuria were measured by commercial kit ( nanjingjiancheng , nanjing , jiangsu , china ) .
the ratio of left kidney weight to bodyweight ( bw ) was also calculated to evaluate renal dysfunction .
plasma norepinephrine concentration was evaluated by elisa kit ( ldn , nordhorn , germany ) .
systolic blood pressure measurement systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) was measured prior to adenovirus injection and once a week after gene delivery by a tail - cuff method , using coda blood pressure systems ( kent scientific , torrington , ct , usa ) .
prior to the actual experiments , the conscious animals were training for three consecutive days to become accustomed to the procedure .
for each animal , at least 15 measurements were recorded to calculate a mean blood pressure and heart rate .
cardiac functional assessment transthoracic echocardiography was performed at the end - point using a vevo770 high resolution imaging system ( visual sonics inc. , toronto , on , canada ) with 17.5 mhz transducer as previously described 30 .
m - mode and 2d parasternal short - axis views were analysed in the anaesthetized rats by trained echocardiographers who were blinded to the treatments .
before being killed , all the rats underwent lv ( left ventricular ) catheterization to assess haemodynamics changes as previously described 31 .
the transducer was attached to rm6240bd multichannel biotic signal collection and analysis instrument ( taimeng , chengdu , china ) to determine cardiac function .
lv systolic pressure , lv end - diastolic pressure ( lvedp ) and the maximal rate of pressure rise ( dp / dtmax ) and fall ( dp / dtmin ) were recorded respectively .
heart weight ( hw ) index were analysed among the three groups .
the hearts were rapidly excised , cleaned and weighed .
the left ventricles were separated and weighed .
the ratios of the whole hw to bw , the ratios of the lv weight ( lw ) to bw were calculate to evaluate cardiac hypertrophy .
histology analysis all the tissues were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin .
tissue sections ( 4 - 6 mum ) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin , masson trichrome solution or sirus red to assess histological injury and fibrosis .
a semi - quantitative score was used to determine the severity of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury as described previously 32 , 33 .
glomerular area was measured as described previously 34 .
all evaluation was performed by an observer who was blind to the experimental protocol .
to evaluate the degree of fibrosis , 10 non - overlapping fields of each section were randomly chosen .
cross - section area of cardiomyocytes was calculated from the average of 50 cardiomyocytes per section as described previously 35 .
for immunohistochemistry , kidney sections were stained with antirat monoclonal antibodies against cd68 ( sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) , cd86 , cd163 and renalase ( both from abcam , cambridge , ma , usa ) as previously described 36 .
all the measurements were calculated by imagepro plus systems .
quantitative real - time pcr total rna were extracted from the renal cortex or lv tissue using trizol ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca , usa ) and was reverse transcribed into cdna with m - mlv reverse transcriptase ( promega , madison , wi , usa ) .
real - time pcr was performed with sybe green pcr master mix ( tarkara , dalian , china ) using steponeplus pcr systems ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
quantitation was normalized to internal control gapdh and 2 - deltadeltact method was used to determine relative gene expression levels .
all the primer pairs are seen in table s1 .
western blot analysis total protein was prepared from frozen tissues by homogenization .
protein concentrations were determined by bca assay ( beyotime , suzhou , jiangsu , china ) and protein samples were separated by 10 - 12 % sds - page and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane .
the membranes were blocked with 5 % non - fat dried milk and then incubated with primary antibodies against matrix metalloproteinase 1 ( mmp - 1 ) , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase - 1 ( timp - 1 ) , renalase ( abcam ) , phospho - erk - 1 / 2 , total erk - 1 / 2 , phospho - p38 , total p38 ( cell signaling technology , danvers , ma , usa ) .
horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( beyotime ) were used and visualized by image quant las 4000 mini system ( ge healthcare , pittsburgh , pa , usa ) .
the bands were analysed using image j software and gapdh or tubulin ( proteintech , chicago , il , usa ) was used as internal control .
statistical analyses spss software 19.0 ( ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) was used for all the statistical analyses .
all the values are expressed as mean +/ - s.e.m. one - way anova followed by a with tukey 's multiple comparison test was used to compare parametric data while kruskal - wallis test followed by the mann - whitney u - test was used for non - parametric data comparison .
a value of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
results adenovirus - mediated gene delivery efficacy as shown in figure s1 , subtotal nephrectomy resulted in dramatic decrease in renalase expression both in the plasma , remnant kidney and heart compared with sham group .
renalase gene delivery restored renalase expression nearly to normal levels in circulation , kidney and heart according to western blot and pcr results in stnx rats ( fig. s1 ) .
consistently , immunohistochemistry analysis also showed adenovirus - renalase effectively increase the percentage of renalase - positive cells in kidney compared with ad - beta - gal - treated stnx rats ( fig. s2 ) .
renalase gene delivery ameliorated renal dysfunction in stnx rats compared to sham group , stnx rats exhibited significant renal dysfunction characterized by increased plasma bun , urine 24 hrs total protein levels , and decreased creatinine clearance as shown in table 1 .
after 4 weeks of treatment , systemic delivery of renalase significantly decreased plasma bun and proteinuria in stnx rats .
kidney weight / bw was also lower in ad - renalase - treated group than ad - beta - gal - treated group ( table 1 ) .
in addition , ad - renalase delivery attenuated creatinine clearance decline in stnx rats .
furthermore , plasma norepinephrine level in ad - renalase - treated stnx rats was also significantly lower than ad - beta - gal - treated stnx rats ( table 1 ) ; suggesting renalase may participate in the metabolism of catecholamines .

john wiley & sons , ltd renalase supplementation attenuated renal pathological injury kidney sections from stnx rats revealed a remarkable glomerular hypertrophy and tubular enlargement ( fig. 1a ) .
ad - renalase treatment significantly decreased glomerular area ( fig. 1g ) and ameliorated glomerularsclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury after subtotal nephrectomy as assessed by pathological score ( fig. 1e and f ) .
to evaluate the extent of interstitial fibrosis , kidney tissues were stained with masson and sirus red .
results showed that renal interstitial fibrosis in ad - renalase - treated rats was less severe than that in ad - beta - gal - treated stnx rats as shown in figure 1b - d. consistent with the histological data , mrna levels of fibrosis markers , including collagen i , collagen iii and transforming growth factor ( tgf ) - beta1 were significantly higher in the remnant kidneys of ad - beta - gal - treated stnx rats than in those of sham rats ; and ad - renalase treatment significantly decreased mrna expression of these fibrosis markers ( fig. 3a ) .

renalase inhibited inflammation and oxidative stress in the remnant kidney to explore whether renalase was involved in macrophage infiltration , activation and polarization , we examined renal infiltration of total macrophage ( cd68 ) , m1 - like ( cd86 ) and m2 - like macrophage ( cd163 ) .
immunohistochemistry analysis showed that ckd rats displayed increased all subtypes of macrophage infiltration and enhanced m1 polarization .
ad - renalase administration significantly diminished total macrophage infiltration numbers especially m1 numbers than ad - beta - gal - treated rats after subtotal nephrectomy ( fig. 2 ) .
in addition , ad - renalase - treated rats exhibited slightly more m2 infiltration than ad - beta - gal - treated rats .

to determine the effects of renalase supplementation on inflammation and oxidative stress , mrna levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and nadph oxidase components were also measured by real - time pcr .
nephrectomized rats showed higher expression levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines , including tumour necrosis factor ( tnf ) - alpha , interleukin ( il ) - 6 , monocyte chemotactic protein ( mcp ) - 1 ( fig. 3b ) and nadph oxidase components , including gp91phox , p47phox and p67phox compared with sham ( fig. 3c ) ; and ad - renalase treatment decreased the expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines and nadph oxidase components .
taking together , these findings indicated renalase supplementation might protect renal injury after renal ablation via inhibiting inflammation activation and oxidative stress in remnant kidney .

discussion in a pathological circumstance such as crs , bidirectional heart - kidney interactions could lead to a vicious cycle which must be prevented .
it has been identified that several hormones or cytokines secreted by kidney or heart have beneficial effect on other organ and may represent as potential therapeutic targets .
for instance , epo prevented cardiac remodelling in nephrectomized rats beyond haematopoiesis and independent of kidney function 37 , 38 .
conversely , overexpression of hormones such as brain natriuretic peptide 29 and follistatin - like 1 ( fstl - 1 ) secreted by heart , attenuated renal fibrosis and cardiac - specific fstl - 1 knockout mice exhibited exacerbation of renal injury after subtotal nephrectomy 39 .
in the present study , we confirmed the beneficial effects of renalase supplementation on functional and histological alterations of kidney and heart and investigated the underlying mechanism in a rat model with progressive renal injury .
we demonstrated that systemic delivery of renalase , a kidney - derived protein , attenuated both renal and cardiac fibrosis , improved renal function and prevented cardiac remodelling 6 weeks after renal ablation through its anti - inflammatory and anti - oxidant effects and inhibition of erk pathway , indicating that renalase may play a crucial role in the interaction between kidney and heart .
renalase is a novel protein secreted by kidney and firstly reported to be a catecholamine - metabolizing enzyme .
our previous reports demonstrated that only kidney tubular epithelial cells could secrete renalase in vitro , thus tubular epithelial cells may be the primary source of circulation renalase 40 .
reduction of plasma and kidney renalase levels may contribute to elevated circulating catecholamines and consequent sns activation in ckd rats .
in agreement with baraka 's study 41 , we found that renalase supplementation indeed decreased the circulation norepinephrine level , sbp and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy .
more importantly , rats with renalase administration also showed improvement of albuminuria , glomerulosclerosis , tubular dilation and interstitial fibrosis after renal ablation , which was not observed in previous report 41 .
this difference may be caused by distinct methods of renalase supplementation .
recombinant protein subcutaneously injection is susceptible to be degraded while adenovirus can broadly infect various cells and leads to effective gene overexpression , is thought to be a more appropriate tool for long - term experiments .
these findings indicated that ad - renalase - administered rats had a lesser degree of crs ; regulation of blood pressure by degrading circulation norepinephrine may be at least in part mechanism for its protective effects .
inflammation and oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the progression of ckd .
our recent reports had shown that renalase protected hk2 cells against the cytotoxicity of h2o2 through suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis and recombinant renalase protected against contrast - induced nephropathy through anti - oxidation and anti - inflammation mechanism 12 , 13 .
other reports demonstrated that renalase - knockout mice led to exacerbation of renal injury caused by acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity and ischemia / reperfusion damage through up - regulation of pro - inflammatory cytokines 15 , 23 .
herein , we found that renalase supplementation also inhibited inflammatory response in remnant kidney via down - regualtion of pro - inflammatory cytokines and nadph oxidase components .
besides , we observed that ad - renalase treatment could not only reduce macrophage infiltration but also regulate change in macrophage m1 / m2 phenotype during ckd progression .
renalase might attenuate renal inflammation via inhibiting pro - inflammatory m1 - like macrophage polarization and promoting anti - inflammation or antifibrosis m2 - like macrophage activation .
evidence showed that renalase - knockout mice exhibit mild lv hypertrophy and renalase polymorphisms are associated with cardiac hypertrophy in patients .
our results proved that renalase supplementation ameliorated cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyocytes hypertrophy , decreased lvpwd and lvedp and restored cardiac diastolic function in ckd rats .
sbp decline after renalase supplementation might be mainly accounted for improvement of cardiac function .
beside , this amelioration was accompanied by remarkably milder cardiomyocytes hypertrophy , reduced expression of pro - fibrotic markers and inhibition of erk - 1 / 2 activation .
it has been established that mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) activity plays an important role in cardiomyocytes hypertrophy and pressure - overload induced cardiac remodelling .
takahashi et al .
42 reported that the phosphorylation of erk - 1 / 2 , not p38 mapk , was involved as an intracellular signalling pathway leading to cardiac hypertrophy in stnx rat model and blockade of erk - 1 / 2 phosphorylation could prevent cardiac remodelling , which is consistent with our results .
on the contrary , other studies 43 , 44 argued that a calcimimetic agent r - 568 or calcitriol increased the activation of erk - 1 / 2 and improved cardiac fibrosis 43 , 44 .
the opposite results may be caused by the different duration of experiment design and heterogeneity of animal operation .
interestingly , recent studies showed that phosphorylation of erk may cause excess oxidative stress which could lead to cardiofibroblasts activation ; and apocynin , an inhibitor of nadph oxidase , attenuated cardiac fibrosis through inhibition erk1 / 2 activation in stnx rats 45 .
we believed that suppressed phosphorylation of erk - 1 / 2 after ad - renalase treatment was mediated via its indirect effects because previous studies revealed that renalase can activate erk and p38 activation in vitro .
renalase treatment had changed the phenotype of stnx animals through decline of blood pressure and sympathetic hyperactivity , which might indirectly inhibit phosphorylation of erk - 1 / 2 .
despite of the enzymatic activity of renalase , it has been suggested that renalase is also a cytokine which may mediate its cardio - renal protective properties through its plasma membrane receptor .
pmca4b , as a recently identified receptor for renalase 22 , is a calcium pump that participates in ca2 + - dependent signalling .
previous reports demonstrated that pmca4b transgenic mice exhibited improvement of lv hypertrophy following transverse aortic constriction or phenylephrine / ang ii infusion and pmca4b overexpression inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro 46 .
supplementation of renalase may directly antagonize cardiac hypertrophy through activating extracellular pmca4b on cardiomyocytes and related downstream signalling pathway in an endocrine manner .
there are some limitations of this study .
first , the study duration is only 6 weeks which may be too short for ckd animals .
second , we could not conclude that renalase exerts its protective effects by lowering blood pressure or directly inhibiting fibrosis and hypertrophy of hearts because of lack of in vitro studies .
thus , kidney - specific renalase - knockout animal should be used in future study to determine the mechanism of renalase 's protective effects in type 4 crs .
in summary , renalase supplementation by systemic delivery of adenovirus - renalase ameliorated both renal dysfunction and cardiac remodelling after subtotal nephrectomy in catecholamine - lowering - dependent / independent manners .
the potential mechanism of its protective effects may be mediated by its anti - inflammatory , anti - oxidant function and inhibition of erk1 / 2 pathway .
therefore , renalase is a crucial modulator of crs progression and renalase supplementation may be a promising therapy for prevention and deterioration of crs in ckd patients .

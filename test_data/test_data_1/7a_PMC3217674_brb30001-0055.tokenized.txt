an eye - of - the - tiger sign is previously known to have one - to - one correlation with pantothenate kinase - associated neurodegeneration ( pkan ) .
reviewing the literature on this subject , the correlation between eye - of - the - tiger sign and pkan seems to show an interesting hypothesis that differs from conventional conclusion .
we analyze the published papers in an attempt to reflect this trend and illustrate our points with findings in a 39 - year - old man .
his brain magnetic resonance imaging study shows typical eye - of - the - tiger sign suggestive of pkan .
genetic analyses revealed no mutations in pantothenate kinase 2 .
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation pantothenate kinase - associated neurodegeneration pantothenate kinase 2 eye - of - the - tiger sign pkan nbia hallervorden - spatz syndrome an eye - of - the - tiger sign is a specific magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) pattern , a key diagnostic feature of pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration ( pkan ) .
it is low - signal intensity rings surrounding the central high - signal intensity regions in the medial aspect of bilateral globus pallidus on t2 - weighted mri ( fig. 1 ) .
the surrounding hypointensity of the globus pallidus is due to excess iron accumulation .
the central hyperintensity is possibly due to gliosis .
pkan , previously known as hallervorden - spatz syndrome , is one of the three extrapyramidal disorders associated with increased amount of brain iron , known as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation ( nbia ) .
according to the time of onset , pkan has been classified as early onset ( classic ) or late onset ( atypical ) .
pkan is caused by mutation of the pantothenate kinase 2 ( pank2 ) , the major causative gene of nbia .
a one - to - one correlation between an eye - of - the - tiger sign and pkan was reported by hayflick et al .
( 2003 ) .
there are few pank2 negative eye - of - the - tiger sign cases being reported ( hartig et al. 2006 ; mcneill et al. 2008 ; kumar et al. 2006 ; strecker et al. 2007 ; valentino et al. 2006 ) .
here , we described a case .
figure 1 t2 - weighted brain mri of the 39 - year - old patient showed bilateral symmetrical hypointensity in the globus pallidus with central hyperintensity , giving an eye - of - the - tiger sign ( arrow ) .
a 39 - year - old male patient presented to our hospital with a 3 - month history of repetitive , intermittent head turning to right .
the symptom showed no fluctuation and did not improve after rest .
the physical examination and neurological examination were unremarkable except right cervical dystonia with positive sensory trick .
cervical spine x - ray , nerve conduction velocity , electromyography , electroencephalography , and laboratory evaluation were normal .
t2 - weighted mri showed a typical eye - of - the - tiger sign ( fig. 1 ) .
this imaging finding suggested pkan .
but , further study of the patient revealed no evidence of pank2 gene mutation , aceruloplasminaemia , neuroferritinopathy , or retinopathy .
we reviewed published literature and found three major series studying eye - of - the - tiger sign and pank2 mutation ( table 1 ) ( hayflick et al. 2003 ; hartig et al. 2006 ; mcneill et al. 2008 ). and there are several pank2 - negative eye - of - the - tiger sign cases reported ( hartig et al. 2006 ; mcneill et al. 2008 ; kumar et al. 2006 ; strecker et al. 2007 ; valentino et al. 2006 ) .
the correlation between eye - of - the - tiger sign and pkan was good , 94 % ( 143 / 152 ) of eye - of - the - tiger sign had pank2 mutation , combining the cases of these three series ( hayflick et al. 2003 ; hartig et al. 2006 ; mcneill et al. 2008 ) .
all cases with pank2 mutation have eye - of - the - tiger sign , but not all eye - of - the - tiger sign cases showed pank2 mutation .
one of the pank2 - negative eye - of - the - tiger sign case was multiple system atrophy and two were neuroferritinopathy ( strecker et al. 2007 ; mcneill et al. 2008 ) .
table 1 pank2 negative eye - of - the - tiger sign hayflick hartig mcneil kumar strecker valentino p our case case no. / total 0 / 69 7 / 55 2 / 28 2 / 2 1 / 1 1 / 3 1 / 1 age ( years ) 2,2,4,4,5,10,30 32 - 69 23,31 65 21 39 diagnosis nbia neuroferritinopathy multiple system atrophy nbia nbia nbia , neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation we observed most of the pank2 negative eye - of - the - tiger sign cases were late onset ( hartig et al. 2006 ; mcneill et al. 2008 ; kumar et al. 2006 ; strecker et al. 2007 ) or adult cases ( valentino et al .
2006 ) , early onset pank2 negative eye - of - the - tiger sign cases were reported only by hartig et al .
( 2006 ) .
considering the lower incidence of late onset nbia ( 46 % in hayflick et al. 2003 and 25 % in hartig et al .
2006 ) , most of the pank2 - negative cases reported were late onset .
the combination of aging process and some other pathologic conditions may lead to an eye - of - the - tiger sign in these adults .
we suggest that an eye - of - the - tiger sign might not be interpreted in isolation .
further studies might be necessary before the diagnosis of pkan , especially in adult cases .

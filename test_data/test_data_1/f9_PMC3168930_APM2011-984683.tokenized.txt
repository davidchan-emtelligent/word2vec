metabolic syndrome is a set of risk factors ( abdominal obesity , insulin resistance , hypertension , and dyslipidemia ) which increases markedly the risk of arteriosclerotic vascular disease .
in subjects with frailty syndrome , aging - related loss of muscle ( sarcopenia ) and bone ( osteoporosis ) might progress to the extent that an older person loses his or her ability to live independently .
due to ongoing obesity pandemic and growing elderly population , metabolic and frailty syndromes are major emerging concerns in healthcare system .
recent studies show that resistance training has remarkable beneficial effects on the musculoskeletal system including prevention and treatment of these syndromes .
resistance training has favourable effect on metabolic syndrome since it decreases fat mass including abdominal fat .
it also enhances insulin sensitivity , improves glucose tolerance , and reduces blood pressure values .
the combination of sarcopenia and osteoporosis is often seen in the frailty syndrome .
resistance training is probably the most effective measure to prevent and treat sarcopenia .
in addition , many studies show that resistance training can maintain or even increase bone mineral density .
optimal nutrition enhances the anabolic effect of resistance training .
resistance training should be a central component of public health promotion programs along with an aerobic exercise .
1. introduction resistance training is any activity that causes muscles to contract against external force .
since the goal of resistance training is to progressively overload the musculoskeletal system , weight machines , dumbbells , and barbells are usually used as a resistance .
studies demonstrate that regular progressive resistance training develops the strength and size of muscles [ 1 ] and increases bone mass [ 2 ] from young male athletes to older women .
in addition , resistance exercise might be even more beneficial than aerobic exercise for fat loss [ 3 ] .
traditionally , public health guidelines primarily focus on aerobic exercise , which mainly enhances cardiorespiratory fitness .
due to ongoing obesity pandemic and growing elderly population , metabolic [ 4 ] and frailty syndromes [ 5 ] are major emerging concerns in healthcare system .
recent studies show that resistance training has remarkable beneficial effects on the musculoskeletal system including prevention and treatment of these syndromes .
the combination of resistance and aerobic training probably yields the greatest benefits in metabolic syndrome .
therefore , resistance training should be also a central component of public health promotion programs .
this paper reviews the effect of resistance training on metabolic syndrome , sarcopenia , and osteoporosis .
in addition , advices is given for clinicians on how to perform an effective resistance training including nutritional aspects .
2. the effect of resistance training onmetabolic and frailty syndromes 2.1 .
metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome is a set of risk factors that includes abdominal obesity , insulin resistance ( a decreased ability to process glucose ) , hypertension , and dyslipidemia [ 4 ] .
this combination of medical disorders increases markedly the risk of arteriosclerotic vascular disease .
the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is rapidly increasing worldwide , largely as a consequence of the ongoing obesity pandemic .
2.1.1 .
abdominal obesity and insulin resistance abdominal obesity and insulin resistance are the key features of the metabolic syndrome .
at rest , skeletal muscle consumes 54.4 kj / kg ( 13.0 kcal / kg ) per day which is larger than adipose tissue at 18.8 kj / kg ( 4.5 kcal / kg ) [ 6 ] .
since resistance training increases muscle mass , it does not result in weight loss without caloric restriction .
however , resistance training , even without caloric restriction , has favourable effect on body composition since it decreases fat mass including abdominal fat [ 7 - 9 ] .
treuth et al. , in 1995 , [ 10 ] already studied over a decade ago the effects of resistance training on body composition .
they found in 14 older women who exercised 3 times per week for 16 weeks that although there was no significant change in body weight because of increased muscle mass , intraabdominal adipose tissue was significantly reduced .
skeletal muscle is an important determinant of insulin sensitivity .
in many studies , resistance training has enhanced insulin sensitivity and improved glucose tolerance [ 9 ] .
meta - analysis of randomised controlled 9 trials evaluated 372 subjects with type 2 diabetes [ 11 ] .
when compared to not exercising , progressive resistance training led to small but statistically significant absolute reductions of 0.3 % in hba1c indicating that resistance training is a feasible option in the management of glycemic control in diabetic subjects .
bweir et al. in 2009 [ 12 ] demonstrated that resistance training lowers hba1c in up to 18 % in subjects with type 2 diabetes .
in this recent study , the resistance training group used 7 exercises that encompassed knee and hip flexion / extension , shoulder flexion / extension , adduction / abduction , elbow flexion / extension , and a chest press .
3 sets of 8 - 10 repetitions were performed for all exercises with a rest period of 2 minutes between sets in 30 - 35 minutes 3 times per week for 10 weeks .
improved glucose uptake appears to be not a mere consequence of the increased muscle mass associated with resistance training but seems to be also a result of qualitative changes in resistance - trained muscle .
holten et al. in 2004 [ 13 ] studied the effect of resistance training ( 30 minutes 3 times per week for 6 weeks ) on one leg while the other leg remained untrained .
they found that resistance training enhances insulin action in skeletal muscle in type 2 diabetic and healthy subjects .
this effect was likely independent of the increases in muscle mass .
they concluded that the increases in muscle glucose transporter isoform 4 ( glut4 ) content and in various insulin signaling protein expressions and / or activity are part of the mechanism behind the improvement in insulin action .
2.1.2 .
the other clinical components of metabolic syndrome resistance training increases blood pressure values acutively and is not therefore recommended for patients with labile hypertension .
however , a meta - analysis of 9 randomized controlled trials demonstrated a net reduction of diastolic blood pressure of 3.5 mmhg ( p < . 01 ) and a nonsignificant reduction of systolic blood pressure of 3.2 mmhg associated with resistance training [ 14 ] .
finally , the effects of resistance training on blood lipids are inconsistent .
resistance training might have some effect on the low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) levels since almost half of trials showed significant reductions in ldl - c levels ranging from 5 % to 23 % [ 15 ] .
2.2 .
frailty syndrome the frailty syndrome is a collection of symptoms or markers mainly due to the aging - related loss and dysfunction of skeletal muscle and bone .
subjects with the frailty syndrome have increased risk of adverse events such as death , disability , and institutionalization [ 5 ] .
the costs of frailty syndrome will increase dramatically as the elderly population grows over the next decade .
2.2.1 .
sarcopenia sarcopenia is the age - related loss of muscle mass and strength .
it reflects a progressive withdrawal of anabolism and an increased catabolism , along with a reduced muscle regeneration capacity .
sarcopenia is an important independent predictor of disability linked to poor balance , gait speed , falls , and fractures .
sarcopenia is mediated by multiple mechanisms including sedentary lifestyle , malnutrition , alpha - motor neuron death , altered hormone concentrations and increased inflammation [ 16 ] .
resistance training is currently the most effective known strategy to combat sarcopenia by stimulating hypertrophy and increasing strength [ 17 ] .
typically , the strength increments associated with resistance training have been much larger than the hypertrophic response .
strasser et al. in 2009 [ 18 ] demonstrated that after 6 months of resistance training for 3 times per week maximum , strength was increased by an average of 15 % for leg press ( p < . 01 ) , 25 % for bench press ( p < . 01 ) , 30 % for bench pull ( p < . 001 ) , and lean body mass was increased by 1.0 +/ - 0.5 kg in elderly adults .
based on this randomized controlled trial , they concluded that loading intensity to promote hypertrophy with resistance training should approach 60 - 80 % of one repetition maximum ( 1rm ) with an exercise volume ranging from 3 to 6 sets per muscle group per week of 10 - 15 repetitions per exercise .
progressive resistance training is an effective and safe tool against sarcopenia also in the very old geriatric patients .
binder et al. in 2005 [ 19 ] studied the effects of resistance training on 91 in community - dwelling subjects with frailty syndrome ( 78 years and older ) in a randomized , controlled trial .
3 months of supervised progressive resistance training induced improvements in maximal voluntary thigh muscle strength and whole body fat - free mass in these elderly women and men .
in general , significant ameliorations ( up to > 50 % strength gain ) can be expected even after 6 weeks of resistance training at a rhythm of 2 - 3 sessions per week .
therefore , from a preventive viewpoint , all elderly subjects should be advised to start such an exercise program and continue it as long as possible [ 20 ] .
2.2.2 .
osteoporosis osteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in the density of bone tissue .
the underlying mechanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation [ 21 ] .
osteoporosis can be thought of as a bone analog of sarcopenia .
bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress .
conversely , physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss .
however , not all exercise modalities have shown positive effects on bone mass .
for example , unloaded exercise such as swimming has no impact on bone mass , while walking or running has limited positive effects [ 22 ] .
many studies have shown that resistance training can maintain or even increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal women [ 23 ] .
it seems that a combination of high - impact ( i.e. , jumping ) and weight - lifting exercises might be superior for bone stimulation in adults [ 22 ] .
chilibeck et al. in 2005 [ 24 ] studied the effect of resistance training on bone mineral density in 29 older men ( age 71 years ) .
bone mineral density was determined by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry before and after training .
they found that resistance training , already after 12 weeks , significantly increased whole - body and leg bone mineral density by approximately 0.5 % - 1 % .
the best ( bone - estrogen strength training ) [ 25 ] project identified six specific resistance training exercises that yielded the largest improvements in bone mineral density .
this project suggested squat , military press , lateral pulldown , leg press , back extension , and seated row , with 3 weight training sessions a week of 2 sets of each exercise , alternating between moderate ( 6 - 8 reps at 70 % of 1rm ) and heavy ( 4 - 6 reps at 80 % of 1rm ) .
3. how to perform an effective resistancetraining resistance training and adequate nutrition are needed for muscle and bone growth .
in addition , appropriate rest period is required to recover from each exercise .
resistance training impacts several body systems including muscular , skeletal , metabolic , neural , respiratory , and endocrine systems .
an understanding and appreciation of basic scientific principles related to resistance training is necessary in order to optimize training responses .
3.1 .
general aspects resistance training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are slow , controlled , and carefully defined also in elderly people [ 1 ] .
it works by causing microscopic damage to the muscle cells ( catabolism ) , which in turn are quickly repaired ( anabolism ) .
the muscle cells adapt to the extra workload by enlarging ( hypertrophy ) and recruiting greater numbers of nerve cells to aid contraction [ 26 , 27 ] .
one of the fundamentals of effective resistance training is to perform each set or at least the last set ( s ) of an exercise to fatigue , the state where the subject cannot lift one more repetition with good form [ 28 ] .
higher training efficiency is superior to lower one in improving muscle strength [ 29 ] and bone mineral density [ 2 ] .
another fundamental is the principle of progressive overload in which the workload is gradually increased over time [ 30 ] .
1rm is the maximum amount of weight one can lift in a single repetition for a given exercise .
to increase specially muscle size ( but also clearly strength ) , medium to heavy loading is needed ( 70 - 80 % of 1rm ) .
in general , 1 to 5 repetitions per set performed to fatigue develop especially muscle strength , 8 to 12 reps muscle size , and more repetition muscle endurance .
when the training goal is muscular hypertrophy , sets with short rest intervals ( about 1 minute ) might be superior whereas longer resting periods ( several minutes ) increase absolute strength [ 31 ] .
optimal exercise time is below 60 minutes since thereafter training intensity reduces significantly .
resistance training under the supervision of a health care professional or personal trainer leads to greater workout intensities and is therefore more efficient [ 32 ] .
to receive lasting results , resistance training should be uninterrupted and be a part of lifestyle .
if lack of time is a barrier , 1 training session per week might be enough to maintain the gained results .
3.2 .
resistance training programs in studies of metabolic and frailty syndromes in clinical studies of metabolic syndrome , sarcopenia , and osteoporosis , the exercise program provides a total body resistance training program for all of the major muscle groups .
typically , there are 3 training sessions per week , but 2 times might be sufficient too [ 33 ] .
before each session , warm up exercises are performed for about 5 - 10 minutes , consisting of stretching exercises for the major muscle groups .
thereafter , 5 - 15 exercises are performed including leg press , squat , leg extension , leg curl , heel raise , bench press , shoulder press , lateral pulldown , seated row , back extension , sit - up , tricep extension , and arm curl .
large muscle groups are worked before smaller ones .
usually 1 - 4 sets of 8 - 15 repetitions ( at 50 - 85 % of 1rm ) often performed to fatigue have been used for all exercises with a rest period of 0.5 - 2 minutes between sets ( table 1 ) .
the regular time required to complete the resistance training program is within 45 minutes , in many studies half an hour .
3.3 .
resistance training programs in future studies in previous studies , each large muscle group has been usually trained for 3 times per week .
however , more advanced practitioners like bodybuilders and experts in muscle growth split the training program [ 34 ] .
split training involves working no more than two or three muscle groups or body parts per day .
it involves fully exhausting individual muscle groups during a workout , then allowing several days for the muscle to fully recover .
muscles are trained once or twice per week and allowed roughly 72 hours to recover ( table 2 ) .
in future studies of metabolic and frailty syndromes , it would be important to compare the effect of whole - body and split resistance training programs .
in addition , resistance training periods have been quite short in previous studies ( up to 6 months ) .
since less is known about long - term hypertrophic response to resistance training in older adults , studies with years of training are needed .
finally , varying the number of repetitions and length of rest and to some extent the types of exercises over time ( periodization ) , it may be possible to achieve greater benefits and hypothetically decrease the risk of injury .
4. nutrition optimal nutrition enhances the anabolic effect of resistance training .
it seems to be reasonable to eat at regular intervals and split daily food intake into 4 to 6 protein - rich meals instead of traditional 3 meals a day .
4.1 .
meals and protein supply protein is needed for cell growth and repair .
in adults , daily protein supply , measured as intake per body weight , is 0.8 - 1.0 g / kg. while protein restriction may be appropriate for treatment of existing kidney disease , there is no significant evidence for a detrimental effect of high - protein intakes on kidney function in healthy subjects [ 35 ] .
several studies have concluded that active people and athletes require elevated protein intake [ 36 ] .
the anabolic effect of resistance exercise is enhanced by the provision of dietary protein .
in intensive resistance training , adequate protein supply , from 1.5 to 2 g / kg per day [ 37 ] , is required for maximal muscle growth .
daily protein supply should be divided constantly on several meals (~ 20 g per meal ) [ 38 ] .
also an adequate supply of carbohydrates is needed as a source of energy and for the body to restore glycogen levels in muscles .
light , balanced meal prior to the workout ensures that adequate energy and amino acids are available for the intense bout of exercise .
water should be consumed throughout the course of the workout to prevent poor performance due to dehydration .
4.2 .
nutritional supplements nutritional supplements are very popular especially among athletes although some studies show either controversial or even negative results .
however , whey protein and creatine seem to have significant positive effects on muscle size , strength , and athletic performance without major adverse effects and high costs .
most studies have shown that supplementation of whey (~ 15 - 30 g ) alone or with carbohydrates immediately after and possibly before and during resistance exercise can enhance the muscle hypertrophy response to resistance training [ 39 ] .
some studies also suggest that whey protein may enhance recovery from heavy exercise and possibly decrease muscle damage and soreness [ 37 ] .
creatine supplementation increases the intracellular pool of phosphocreatine .
phosphocreatine provides a reserve of energy to rapidly regenerate atp , which is consumed as a result of muscle contraction .
the most common creatine loading programme involves an initial loading phase of 20 g / day for 5 - 7 days , followed by a maintenance phase of 3 - 5 g / day for differing periods of time ( 1 week to 6 months ) .
carbohydrate ingestion augments creatine retention during creatine feeding [ 40 ] .
creatine has been studied in hundreds of clinical trials and has shown benefits including increased muscle strength , power , and size [ 41 ] also in elderly men and women [ 42 , 43 ] .
in addition , creatine might increase bone mineral content may be due to an enhanced muscle mass , with potentially greater tension on bone at sites of muscle attachment [ 24 ] .
creatine supplementation causes minor water retention ( 1 - 2 kg ) but has no severe adverse effects such as renal dysfunction [ 44 ] .
however , creatine supplementation should not be used by an individual with existing renal disease , and more studies to address the issue of long - term ( for several years ) creatine usage are needed .
4.3 .
nutritional options in future studies the effect of nutrition on metabolic and frailty syndromes during resistance training has not been investigated accurately .
in especially frailty syndrome , protein malnutrition is common and nutritional intake might be insufficient to maintain adequate total body mass in these subjects .
esmarck et al. in 2001 [ 45 ] demonstrated that after resistance training immediate intake of a protein supplement is more effective than delayed intake for the maximal development of muscle hypertrophy in elderly men .
it is possible that optimal nutrition would improve the results in clinical studies .
therefore , in future studies , nutritional evaluation is indicated including adequate protein supply ( e.g. , 1.5 g / kg per day ) and a whey protein shake immediately following the exercise , because both protein uptake and protein usage are increased at this time ( table 3 ) .
finally , some subjects , for example , in frailty syndrome , might benefit from creatine supplementation .
creatine is very inexpensive , 1 kg costs about 30 euros and is almost enough for a year of usage .
5. conclusion the beneficial effects of resistance training have been known for decades in physiatrics and rehabilitation medicine .
however , recent studies demonstrate major positive actions far beyond this .
the prevalence and costs of metabolic and frailty syndromes will increase dramatically due to ongoing obesity pandemic and growing elderly population .
resistance training is an effective tool against these syndromes .
resistance training has favourable effect on body composition since it decreases fat mass including abdominal fat .
it also enhances insulin sensitivity , improves glucose tolerance , and reduces blood pressure values .
the combination of sarcopenia and osteoporosis results in the significant frailty syndrome often seen in the elderly population .
sarcopenia may progress to the extent that an older person may lose his or her ability to live independently .
resistance training is probably the most effective measure to prevent and treat sarcopenia .
in addition , many studies have shown that resistance training can maintain or even increase bone mineral density .
therefore , resistance training should be a central component of public health promotion programs along with an aerobic exercise .
more studies are needed to identify the effect of different training programs , long - term responses , and the role of optimal nutrition to enhance the anabolic effects of resistance training .
it is time for muscle millennium .

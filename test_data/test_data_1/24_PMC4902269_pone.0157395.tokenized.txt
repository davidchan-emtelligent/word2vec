gfi1 plays an important role in the development and maintenance of many hematopoietic linage cells .
however , the impact of gfi1 - deficiency on the inkt cell differentiation remains unclear .
we herein demonstrate a critical role of gfi1 in regulating the development of inkt cell subsets .
in the thymus of t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient mice , inkt cells normally developed up to stage 2 , while the number of stage 3 nk1.1pos inkt cells was significantly reduced .
furthermore , cd4pos inkt cells were selectively reduced in the peripheral organs of t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient mice .
the alpha - galcer - dependent production of ifn - gammaand th2 cytokines , but not il - 17a , was severely reduced in t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient mice .
in addition , a reduction of the alpha - galcer - induced anti - tumor activity was observed in gfi1 - deficient mice .
these findings demonstrate the important role of gfi1 in regulating the development and function of nkt1 - and nkt2 - type inkt cell subsets .

introduction invariant natural killer t ( inkt ) cells are composed of a rare lymphocyte sub lineage with phenotypic and functional properties similar to t and nk t cells [ 1 ] [ 2 ] .
murine inkt cells express the t cell antigen receptor ( tcr ) valpha14jalpha18 chain coupled with vbeta8.2 , vbeta7 , or vbeta2 , whereas human inkt cells have valpha24jalpha18 coupled to vbeta11 .
they play both effector and regulatory roles in infectious and autoimmune diseases .
in cancer , they are mostly protective by producing ifn - gamma to activate nk and cd8 t cells and by activating dendritic cells to release il - 12 .
inkt cells have been recently shown to play a role in tumor immunosurveillance and the potential effect of these cells in tumor therapy is beginning to be uncovered .
the ligand for inkt cells was identified as alpha - galactosylceramide ( alpha - galcer ) , which is presented by cd1d and stimulates the immediate release of high levels of effector cytokines [ 1 ] .
more recently , it was demonstrated that inkt cells respond rapidly to a variety of glycolipids presented by cd1d and produce effector cytokines [ 3 , 4 ] .
in addition , the preferential production of th2 cytokines from inkt cells stimulated with och , a sphingosine - truncated alpha - galcer , presented by cd1d has been reported [ 5 ] .
inkt cells mainly originate from cd4 + cd8 + double positive ( dp ) progenitors in an agonist selection process involving endogenous ligands , including glycosphingolipid isoglobotrihexosyl ceramide in the thymus [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] .
inkt cell precursors recognize endogenous lipid antigens presented by cd1d , a homologue of the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) .
importantly , they are selected by homotypic interactions of dp thymocytes that express cd1d on their cell surfaces .
a subset of dp thymocytes express the transcription factor retinoic acid receptor - related orphan receptor gamma ( rorgammat ) and rearrange their valpha14 and jalpha18 segments to form the invariant tcralphachain [ 9 ] .
following positive selection , inkt cells downregulate cd8 and progress down a maturation pathway that is marked by the sequential acquisition of specific patterns of surface marker expression [ 10 - 12 ] .
it is believed that maturation comprises four stages according to the expression of cd24 , cd44 and nk1.1 molecules .
the most immature stage of inkt cells is defined as stage 0 ( cd24hicd44lonk1.1neg ) followed by stage 1 ( cd24locd44lonk1.1neg ) and stage 2 ( cd24locd44hink1.1neg ) .
mature inkt cells are subdivided into at least 3 distinct populations , nkt1 ( cd4pos / negnk1.1pos ) , nkt2 ( cd4posnk1.1neg ) and nkt17 ( cd4negnk1.1neg ) [ 10 - 12 ] .
nkt1 and nkt2 predominantly reside in non - lymphoid organs , while nkt17 cells mainly locate in the peripheral lymph nodes .
nkt1 express t - bet and produce ifn - gammaand il - 4 , whereas nkt2 cells express gata3 and secret th2 cytokines , il - 4 and il - 13 .
nkt17 cells produce th17 - related cytokines , il - 17 and il - 22 .
several transcriptional factors have been identified as regulators of inkt cell development including rorgammat , runx1 , heb , egr2 , nf - kappab , plzf , gata3 , t - bet , c - myc and id2 [ 10 - 12 ] .
among them , the broad complex tramtrack bric - a - brac zinc finger ( btb - zf ) transcription factor plzf is a key regulator of inkt cell development and function [ 13 , 14 ] .
the expression of plzf is largely restricted to inkt cells , where it is highest in stage 0 and 1 populations .
the plzf - deficient mice showed an approximately 90 % reduction in inkt cell number and plzf - deficient cells failed to acquire the characteristic features of inkt cells in the thymus .
however , the transgenic expression of plzf in conventional t cells did not induce the expression of nkt cell - associated makers such as nk1.1 , nkg2d , dx5 and 2b4 , whereas the memory - like character was acquired [ 13 , 15 , 16 ] .
thus , the transcriptional regulation of inkt cell development is not fully understood .
gfi1 is a dna binding transcriptional repressor , originally identified as a proto - oncogene that converts an il - 2 - dependent cell line into an il - 2 - independent cell line [ 17 ] .
gfi1 exerts its role as a transcriptional repressor by interacting with a number of histone modification enzymes including lsd1 / corest , g9a and hdacs [ 18 - 21 ] .
gfi1 plays important roles in the differentiation of several hematopoietic cells including neutrophils , dendritic cells and b cells and in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells [ 22 ] .
in cd4 t cells , it has been reported that gfi1 regulates th2 cell expansion via the enhancement of stat5 activity [ 23 , 24 ] .
we previously reported that the expression level of gata3 protein and the generation of il - 5 - producing th2 cells are severely impaired in gfi1 - deficient cd4 t cells [ 25 ] .
gfi1 acts as a downstream effector of the erk / mapk pathways and promotes the generation of il - 5 - producing th2 cells , in part by preventing gata3 protein degradation .
more recently , the gfi1 - mediated inhibition of th17 and itreg cells development has been reported [ 26 - 29 ] .
gfi1 negatively regulates il17a expression , in part , via the inhibition of the recruitment of rorgammat to the il17a promoter [ 26 ] .
in this study , we showed that gfi1 plays an important role in the development and / or maturation of inkt cell subsets .
cd4pos and nk1.1pos inkt cell populations were significantly reduced in gfi1flox / flox cd4 cre - transgenic ( t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient : gfi1 - deficient ) mice .
the alpha - galcer - dependent induction of ifn - gamma , il - 4 and il - 13 production was severely reduced in gfi1 - deficient mice , whereas il - 17a was normally produced .
consistently , the decrease in the alpha - galcer - induced anti - tumor activity was observed in gfi1 - deficient mice using a murine model of lung metastasis of b16 melanoma .
these results clearly demonstrate that gfi1 is a critical transcriptional regulator that controls the development of cd4pos and nk1.1pos inkt cells .

results cd4pos inkt cells are decreased in the peripheral organs of t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient mice it was previously reported that gfi1 is expressed in thymocytes and mature peripheral t cells [ 22 , 33 ] .
we assessed the expression of gfi1 in cd1d - restricted inkt cells ( inkt cells ) by a facs analysis using heterozygote mutant mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein from the endogenous gfi1 locus ( gfi1 - egfp ki ) [ 34 ] .
although the majority of inkt cells in the spleen , lung and liver expressed egfp , the expression level of egfp was low in some nk1.1neg inkt cells in the spleen ( s1 fig ) .
to determine the intrinsic role of gfi1 in inkt cells , we crossed gfi1flox / flox mice with cd4 - cre transgenic ( tg ) mice .
the gfi1 gene was deleted in the cd4 / cd8 dp stage in t cell thymic development .
a significant decrease in the inkt cell numbers in the spleen , liver and lungs was observed in t cell - specific gfi1flox / flox cd4 - cre ( gfi1 - deficient ) mice ( fig 1a and 1b ) .
the mature inkt cells were then subdivided into two populations , cd4 inkt cells and double cd4 / cd8 - negative ( dn ) inkt cells [ 10 , 11 , 35 ] .
we found that cd4pos inkt cells showed a striking reduction in the lung , liver and spleen of gfi1 - deficient mice , whereas dn inkt cells remained unaffected ( fig 1c and 1d ) .
furthermore , a selective reduction of the nk1.1pos inkt cell number was detected in the peripheral organs of gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 2a and 2b ) .
the peripheral inkt cells were subdivided into 4 populations according to the cd4 and nk1.1 expression [ 10 , 11 , 35 ] .
although a high - level expression of gfi1 mrna was detected in the cd4posnk1.1pos , cd4posnk1.1neg and cd4negnk1.1pos fractions of splenic inkt cells , cd4negnk1.1neg inkt cells expressed relatively lower levels of gfi1 mrna ( fig 2c ) .
a significant reduction in cd4posnk1.1pos and cd4negnk1.1pos inkt cells was detected in the lung , liver and spleen of gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 2d and 2e ) .
in addition , a decreased number of cd4posnk1.1neg inkt cells was observed in the liver , but not in the lung and spleen of gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 2d and 2e ) .
the number of cd4negnk1.1neg inkt cells in the lung , liver and spleen was not affected by gfi1 - deficiency ( fig 2e ) .

gfi1 regulates nk1.1pos inkt cell development in the thymus to further examine the role of gfi1 on inkt cell development , we next analyzed the development of inkt cell in the thymus .
both immature ( cd24pos ) and mature ( nk1.1pos ) thymic inkt fractions expressed considerable levels of egfp ( s2 fig ) .
the expression of gfi1 mrna was also confirmed by a quantitative rt - pcr analysis .
gfi1 mrna was detected in inkt cells of all developmental stages ( stage 0 to stage 3 ) , and the level was relatively higher in the earlier stages ( stage 0 and stage 1 ) ( fig 3a ) .
the gfi1 - deficient thymus had similar number of inkt cells compared with the wild - type thymus ( fig 3b ) .
stage 0 cd24high immature inkt cells were not decreased in the gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 3c ) .
to further confirm the effect of gfi1 deficiency on cd24high immature inkt cells , we assessed the vbeta8 bias of the tcr repertoire .
the cd1d - tetramerpos thymocytes were enriched using a magnetic cell sorter to avoid a nonspecific staining as described previously [ 32 ] , and stained with an anti - cd24 and an anti - tcrvbeta8 mabs .
the number of vbeta8pos cd24high immature inkt cells in the thymus of gfi1 - deficient mice was comparable to that of in control wt mice ( fig 3d ) .
in contrast , a decrease in stage 3 inkt cells ( cd24lownk1.1pos ) and an increase in stage 1 - 2 inkt cells ( cd24lownk1.1low ) were observed in the gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 3e ) .
the reduction of stage 3 inkt cells and augmentation of the stage 1 - 2 inkt cell ratio in the gfi1 - deficient thymocytes were confirmed by staining with nk1.1 and cd44 ( fig 3f ) .
the expression of il - 17rb is a maker for thymic inkt cell subpopulations [ 36 ] .
the expression of il17rb mrna in the gfi1 - deficient thymic inkt cells was significantly reduced compared with the wild - type cells ( fig 3g ) .
surprisingly , the ratio of cd4 positive and negative inkt cells was not altered by gfi1 deficiency in the thymus ( fig 3h ) .
these data suggest that the reduction of cd4pos inkt cells occurs in the periphery , while the development of nk1.1pos inkt cells was altered in the thymus of gfi1 - deficient mice .

the alpha - galcer - loaded cd1d - tetramerpos b220low cd3epsilonpos mononuclear cells were isolated as total inkt cells .
the purity of the sorted inkt ( alpha - galcer - loaded cd1d - tetramerpos cd3epsilonpos ) cells was greater than 99 % ( s3a fig ) .
we detected a dramatic increase in eomes mrna in the gfi1 - deficient thymic inkt cells in comparison to the wild - type inkt cells ( fig 4a ) .
the expression of runx3 mrna was also detected in gfi1 - deficient thymic inkt cells ( fig 4a ) .
although the expression levels of gata3 , lef1 and tbx21 mrna were significantly reduced in the gfi1 - deficient thymic inkt cells compared with the wild - type cells , the differences were marginal ( fig 4a ) .
plzf , runx1 , zbtb7b , egr2 and rorgammat mrna were normally expressed in the thymic inkt cells of gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 4a ) .
in contrast , splenic inkt cells from gfi1 - deficient mice expressed lower levels of plzf , gata3 , tbx21 , zbtb7b , lef1 and rorgammat , and a higher level of eomes mrna compared with that of the wild - type cells ( fig 4b ) .
the reduced levels of plzf , gata3 and tbx21 and increased level of eomes mrna were also detected in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells from the liver and lung ( fig 4c and 4d ) .
however , rorgammat mrna was increased in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells of the liver and lung , and the expression of zbtb7b and lef1 showed different pattern in each of the organs ( fig 4c and 4d ) .
we next performed intracellular staining to assess the protein expression of the transcription factors .
a decreased protein expression of plzf , gata3 and t - bet was detected in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells from the spleen , liver and lung ( fig 4e ) .
the augmented expression of the eomes protein in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells from these organs was also confirmed ( fig 4e ) .
the expression of rorgammat was decreased in the gfi1 - deficient splenic inkt cells , whereas the level was increased in the lung and liver ( fig 4e ) .

to understand the difference in the impact of gfi1 - deficiency on the expression of transcription factors in the inkt cells between the organs , we divided splenic inkt cells into 4 populations according to the cd4 and nk1.1 expression and examined the mrna expression profile of the transcription factors .
the mrna expression of plzf , gata3 , zbtb7b and tbx21 was significantly low in the cd4negnk1.1neg inkt cells ( s3b fig ) .
in sharp contrast , the expressions of rogammat and eomes mrna were relatively higher in the cd4neg inkt cells compared with that of cd4pos inkt cells ( s3b fig ) .
these results support the notion that cd4 - and nk1.1 - positive inkt cells were reduced in the peripheral organs of gfi1 - deficient mice .
finally , we assessed the difference of functional populations of inkt cells between wt and gfi1 - deficient mice .
the ratio of inkt1 ( plzflow / t - bethigh ) and inkt2 ( plzfhigh / t - betlow ) cells was moderately reduced in the thymus of gfi1 - deficient mice , whereas the inkt17 ( rorgammathigh ) cells remained unaffected ( fig 5a and 5b ) .
the decreased ratio of inkt1 cells was also detected in the lungs , liver and spleen of gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 5c ) .
the ratio of inkt2 cells was moderately increased in the lung and spleen of gfi1 - deficient mice , but not in the liver ( fig 5c ) .
the ratio of rorgammat - positive inkt17 cells was increased in the lung and liver of the gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 5d ) .
interestingly , the expression level of rorgammat in non - inkt17 cells of the gfi1 - deficient mice was decreased ( fig 5d ) .
these findings demonstrate the important role of gfi1 in regulating the development and / or maintenance of type - 1 inkt cells .

inkt cells were purified by facs sorting and the intracellular staining of the indicated transcription factors was performed .
the expression of plzf and t - bet in the thymus ( a ) and the indicated peripheral organs ( c ) , and the patterns of plzf and rorgammat in the thymus ( b ) and the indicated peripheral organs ( d ) are shown .
decreased ifn - gammaand th2 cytokine production of gfi1 - deficient inkt cells we next examined the expression profile cytokines in splenic gfi1 - deficient inkt cells .
the alpha - galcer - loaded cd1d - tetramerpos b220low cd3epsilonpos inkt cells were purified by facs sorting (> 98 %) and then stimulated with pma plus ionomycin for 2 h. the expressions of ifngamma , il4 and il13 were severely attenuated in the gfi1 - deficient splenic inkt cells compared with the wild - type splenic inkt cells ( fig 6a ) .
similar results were obtained when we purified inkt cells from the lung and liver ( fig 6b and 6c ) .
in contrast , the reduced expression of il17a mrna was not detected in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells from the lung and liver ( fig 6b and 6c ) , and gfi1 - deficient splenic inkt cells showed only a moderate reduction of il17a mrna ( fig 6a ) .
the decreased ifn - gammaproduction in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells in the periphery was confirmed by intracellular staining ( fig 6d , upper panel ) .
in contrast , there was a moderate reduction in the level of il - 4 proteins in the gfi1 - deficient peripheral inkt cells ( fig 6d , middle panel ) .
gfi1 deficiency only had a marginal effect on il - 17a production in inkt cells ( fig 6d , lower panel ) .
the number of il - 4 / ifn - gammadouble - producing splenic inkt cells was also decreased in the spleen and liver of gfi1 - deficient mice ( fig 6e ) .
furthermore , we found that cd4posnk1.1pos inkt cells stimulated with pma plus ionomycin expressed high levels of ifngammaand il4 mrna , whereas the il17a expression was predominantly induced in the nk1.1neg inkt cells ( s4 fig ) .
taken together , these results suggest that ifn - gamma - , il - 4 - and il - 13 producing inkt cells are decreased in gfi1 - deficient mice via the selective reduction of cd4pos and nk1.1pos inkt cells .

inkt cells were purified by facs sorting , and stimulated with pma plus ionomycin in the presence of monensin for 4 h. alpha - galcer - induced anti - tumor activity is attenuated by gfi1 - deficiency finally , we assessed the impact of the gfi1 deletion on inkt cell - dependent immune response in vivo .
to confirm the reduced production of ifn - gamma , il - 4 and il - 13 in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells in vivo , alpha - galcer was intravenously injected and the concentration of cytokines in the serum was measured at 2 and 16 h after the injection .
as expected , the concentrations of ifn - gamma , il - 4 and il - 13 were reduced in the alpha - galcer - injected gfi1 - deficient mice compared with that of the wild - type mice ( fig 7a ) .
the increase in the serum il - 17a level induced by alpha - galcer injection was not affected by the gfi1 - deficiency ( fig 7a ) .

next , we assessed the alpha - galcer - dependent anti - tumor activity in gfi1 - deficient mice using the experimental lung metastasis model of b16 melanoma as previously reported [ 1 ] .
an experimental schedule is indicated in s5 fig. briefly , b16 melanoma cells were intravenously transplanted on day 0 , and alpha - galcer was administrated intravenously on day 1 , 5 and 9 .
sixteen days after b16 melanoma injection , lung metastasis was determined .
lung metastasis of b16 melanoma cells assessed by tumor coverage was significantly suppressed by the alpha - galcer administration in the wild - type mice ( fig 7b and 7c ) .
however , the administration of alpha - galcer into gfi1 - deficient mice failed to inhibit lung metastasis of b16 melanoma cells ( fig 7b ) .
increased lung metastasis in the gfi1 - deficient mice was confirmed by hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) staining ( fig 7c ) .
the survival time of the b16 melanoma - bearing wild - type mice was significantly extended by alpha - galcer administration compared to non - treated wild - type mice ( fig 7d ) .
the tumor - bearing gfi1 - deficient mice died more rapidly compared with the wild - type mice , and alpha - galcer - dependent extension in the survival time was not observed ( fig 7d ) .
these results indicate that alpha - galcer / inkt cell - dependent anti - tumor activity is impaired in the gfi1 - deficient mice .
discussion in this study , we described the role of gfi1 in the development and maintenance of both thymic and peripheral inkt cells .
gfi1 drove terminal differentiation of thymic inkt cells that required upregulation of the nk1.1 expression .
in addition , gfi1 maintained the cd4pos inkt cell number in the peripheral organs including the spleen , liver and lungs .
consequently , the production of ifn - gammaand th2 cytokines , but not il - 17a , was significantly reduced in gfi1 - deficient inkt cells both in vitro and in vivo .
furthermore , the alpha - galcer - dependent anti - tumor activity was impaired in t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient mice .
these results suggest that gfi1 ablation in dp thymocytes impacts on the development and maintenance of inkt cells .
mature inkt cells are subdivided into at least 3 distinct populations , inkt1 ( cd4pos / negnk1.1pos / plzflowt - bethigh ) , inkt2 ( cd4posnk1.1neg / plzfhight - betlow ) and inkt17 ( cd4negnk1.1neg / rorgammathigh ) , according to the cytokine production ability [ 10 , 11 , 35 ] .
inkt1 cells express t - bet and produce ifn - gammaand il - 4 , whereas inkt2 cells express gata3 and secret th2 cytokines , il - 4 and il - 13 .
inkt17 cells produce th17 - related cytokines , il - 17 and il - 22 .
we demonstrated that increase in the serum concentration of ifn - gamma , il - 4 and il - 13 induced by alpha - galcer intravenous injection were impaired in gfi1 - deficient mice .
in contrast , the serum level of il - 17a in gfi1 - deficient mice was comparable to that in the wild - type mice .
we sorted inkt cells from the peripheral organs and stimulated them with pma plus ionomycin to examine the cytokine expression in gfi1 - deficient peripheral inkt cells .
the reduced expression of ifngamma , il4 and il13 mrna was detected in gfi1 - deficient inkt cells from the spleen , liver and lung .
the intracellular staining of cytokines revealed that the number of il - 4 / ifn - gammadouble - producing cells was also decreased in the spleen and liver of gfi1 - deficient mice .
the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells from the peripheral organs showed a striking reduction of ifn - gammaexpression .
although the expression of il17a was moderately decreased in the gfi1 - deficient splenic inkt cells , inkt cells from the liver and lung expressed a considerable amount of il17a mrna even in the absence of gfi1 .
furthermore , the decreased expression of t - bet and gata3 was detected in the gfi1 - derficient inkt cells from the peripheral organs .
the reduced number of cd4pos and nk1.1pos mature inkt cells was detected in gfi1 - deficient mice .
moreover , the number of plzflowt - bethigh inkt cells was decreased in gfi1 - deficient mice , whereas the rorgammathigh inkt cells remained unaffected .
taken together , the gfi1 - deficiency has the strongest impact on the development of inkt1 cells .
the expression of rorgammat was only reduced in the gfi1 - deficient splenic inkt cells , and the increased level of rorgammat protein was detected in the gfi1 - deficient inkt cells of the liver and lung .
we cannot explain why the expression levels of rorgammat in inkt cells were different in every organ of the gfi1 - deficient mice .
we previously performed a dna microarray analysis to compare the mrna expression profiles of wt cd4 t cells and gfi1 - deficient cd4 t cells .
the expression of ccr2 , ccr5 and ccr6 was significantly increased , whereas the level of ccr8 mrna was reduced [ 37 ] .
in addition , the increased expression of itgalphae was reported in gfi1 - deficient cd4 t cells [ 28 ] .
changes of the chemokine receptors and integrins in gfi1 - deficient inkt cells would alter the organ distribution of the inkt cell subsets .
thus , it is possible that the variations in the rorgammat level of the gfi1 - deficient mice were caused by the altered organ distribution of rorgammat - positive inkt cells .
gfi1 was originally identified as a proto - oncogene that prevents cell death of an il - 2 - dependent cell line induced by il - 2 withdrawal [ 24 ] .
il - 2 receptor ( il - 2r ) consists of an alphachain , betachain and commongamma ( gammac ) chain [ 38 ] .
the gammac chain is a cytokine receptor subunit that is common to the receptor complex for several different interleukin receptors including il - 4 , il - 7 , il - 9 , il - 15 and il - 21 receptors .
furthermore , the il - 2rbetachain is also used as a component of il - 15 receptor .
the critical role of il - 7 and il - 15 in inkt cell development has been reported [ 39 ] .
more recently , it was reported that rorgammat - positive nkt17 cells are il - 15 independent and instead rely completely on il - 7 [ 40 ] .
we found that cd4pos and nk1.1pos inkt cells were significantly reduced in t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient mice , whereas the number of cd4negnk1.1neg inkt cells was less affected .
it is likely that gfi1 is induced by il - 15 and protects nkt1 ( cd4pos / negnk1.1pos ) and nkt2 ( cd4posnk1.1pos ) cells from cell death .
in fact , the expression of bcl - 2 in stage 3 inkt cells is significantly reduced in il15ralpha - deficient mice and the number of nk1.1pos thymic inkt cell is decreased [ 38 ] .
moreover , it was previously reported that gfi1 antagonizes p53 - induced cell death by inhibiting the expression of pro - apoptotic factors including bax , noxa and puma [ 41 ] .
gfi1 also protects hematopoietic stem cells against apoptosis [ 42 ] .
the high - level expression of gfi1 mrna was detected in the cd4pos inkt cells in the peripheral organs .
therefore , it is possible that gfi1 supports the cd4pos inkt cells survival by inhibiting the expression of pro - apoptotic factors .
we found that stage 3 ( nk1.1poscd44high ) thymic inkt cells were significantly reduced in gfi1 - deficient mice , whereas stage 2 ( nk1.1negcd44high ) inkt cell numbers increased .
the total thymic inkt cell number was unaffected by gfi1 - deficiency .
these results suggest that gfi1 participates in the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 inkt cells .
t - bet plays an indispensable role in the final maturation of inkt cells [ 43 , 44 ] .
the level of t - bet increases from stage 1 to 3 of thymic inkt cell maturation , and inkt cell development is blocked at stage 2 in the absence of t - bet .
we found that the expression of tbx21 moderately decreased in gfi1 - deficient thymic inkt cells compared with that in the wild - type cells , while another t - box family transcription factor , eomes , was observed to increase .
in addition , t - bet was preferentially expressed in cd4pos inkt cells in the spleen , whereas the expression of eomes was predominant in cd4neg inkt cells .
the increased level of eomes may therefore contribute to the selective reduction of cd4pos inkt cells in t cell - specific gfi1 - deficient mice .
in this study , we used a cd4 - cre tg system to delete the gfi1 gene in t cells .
under these conditions , gfi1 is deleted after the cd4 / cd8 - double positive stage during thymic t cell development .
therefore , it is difficult to fully determine the intrinsic role of gfi1 in inkt cells .
however , the data presented herein provide important information for improving our understanding of the development and maintenance of inkt cells .
we identified compelling evidence that gfi1 mediates the development of inkt cell subsets .
taken together , our present study thus provides new insight into inkt cell development and maturation .

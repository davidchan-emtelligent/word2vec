the general anesthetic propofol has been in clinical use for more than 30 years and has become the agent of choice for rapid intravenous induction .
while its hypnotic and anti - convulsant properties are well known , the propensity for propofol to promote seizure activity is less well characterised .
electroencephalogram - confirmed reports of propofol - induced seizure activity implicate a predisposition in epileptic subjects .
the aim of this study was to investigate the seizure - promoting action of propofol in mouse brain slices - - with the goal of establishing an in vitro model of propofol pro - convulsant action for future mechanistic studies .
coronal slices were exposed to either normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) or no - magnesium ( no - mg ) acsf - - and extracellular field potential recordings made from the hippocampus , entorhinal cortex and neocortex .
propofol ( and etomidate for comparison ) were delivered at three stepwise concentrations corresponding to clinically relevant levels .
the main finding was that propofol induced ictal - like seizures in seven out of ten hippocampal recordings ( p = 0.004 compared to controls ) following pre - exposure to no - mg acsf - - but strongly inhibited seizure - like event ( sle ) activity in the neocortex .
propofol did not induce seizure activity in slices exposed to normal acsf .
the results support the contention that propofol has the capacity to promote seizure activity , particularly when there is an underlying seizure predisposition .
this study establishes an in vitro model for exploring the mechanisms by which propofol promotes subcortical seizure activity .
keywords ictal general anesthesia propofol etomidate slice issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background propofol was introduced to clinical practice as a general anesthetic in 1977 and has become the agent of choice for rapid intravenous induction .
it was originally thought to be a pure hypnotic ( samra et al .
1995 ) , but has since been shown to have strong anticonvulsant properties ( al - hader et al .
1992 ) - - the equal of thiopental for treating refractory status epilepticus ( prabhakar et al. 2012 ) .
the pro - convulsant potential of propofol has been debated and remains a controversial area ( samra et al. 1995 ) .
myoclonic activity during propofol anesthesia is common ( walder et al .
2002 ) and many case - studies report convulsive - like muscle activity , particularly during induction and emergence ( sutherland and burt 1994 ) .
electroencephalographic ( eeg ) confirmation of cortical seizure activity ( hodkinson et al. 1987 ; makela et al. 1993 ; wang et al .
1997 ) points to a dual action of propofol - - predominantly anticonvulsant with a weaker pro - convulsant effect ( bevan 1993 ) .
where the eeg has confirmed seizure activity , subjects with a history of epilepsy tend to be overrepresented .
for example , hodkinson et al .
( 1987 ) report three consecutive cases of propofol - induced epileptiform activity in the eeg of epileptic subjects .
in a study reviewing five cases of convulsant - like muscle activity , the single eeg - confirmed case of seizure activity was from an epileptic ( makela et al. 1993 ) .
in a similar study , eeg spikes and sharp waves were recorded in epileptics and non - epileptics following low - dose propofol , but the one case of grand mal seizure activity was from the former ( wang et al. 1997 ) .
accordingly , it has been recommended that propofol be avoided or used with caution in subjects with a history of epilepsy ( hodkinson et al. 1987 ; makela et al. 1993 ; wang et al. 1997 ) .
abnormal posturing and convulsive - like movements during propofol anesthesia are not universally associated with eeg changes consistent with cortical seizure activity ( borgeat et al. 1993 ) .
these could be instances of non - seizure - related muscle dystonia and / or epileptiform activity originating from deeper structures ( borgeat et al. 1993 ) .
it is noteworthy that subcortical seizure activity , which may present as myoclonic convulsive - like movements ( gale 1992 ) , can be difficult to detect in the eeg ( borgeat et al. 1993 ; kiloh and osselton 1961 ; makela et al. 1993 ) .
furthermore , focal epileptiform events that are spatially limited may only be detectable with high - density electrocorticogram recordings .
thus , a normal eeg does not necessarily preclude an epileptiform aetiology. with this as background , we designed a series of experiments to investigate the seizure - promoting action of propofol in mouse brain slices .
the goal was to establish an in vitro model of propofol pro - convulsant action that could be probed for specific mechanisms in future studies .
three questions were of paramount interest .
firstly , could we identify a pro - seizure effect of propofol in the slice model ?
secondly , could the apparent in vivo susceptibility of epileptics to propofol - induced seizures be replicated ?
thirdly , are cortical or subcortical regions differentially sensitive to propofol seizure promoting effects ?
slices were pre - exposed to no - magnesium conditions - - initiating ongoing seizure - like events ( sle ) akin to in vivo interictal activity - - and compared to quiescent slices exposed to " normal " conditions .
we focussed on three anatomical regions , the hippocampus , entorhinal cortex and the neocortex .
the former is of particular interest as the site of seizure generation in temporal lobe epilepsy ( das et al .
2009 ) and as a documented target for anesthetic excitatory effects ( becker et al. 2012 ) .
the entorhinal area is also a seizure - prone region by nature of its recurrent network structure ( dhillon and jones 2000 ) .
finally , we compared the effect of propofol to that of etomidate , which shares with propofol a gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) - receptor mechanism of action ( lingamaneni and hemmings 2003 ) .
we choose etomidate as a comparator because it is recognised as having pro - seizure characteristics ( modica et al .
1990 ) and because it is the most specific gabaergic anesthetic ( franks 2006 ) .
results and discussion baseline sle characteristics slices perfused with no - mg acsf generated spontaneous interictal - like sle activity characterised by a sharp positive or negative deflection in the field potential of approximately 100 muv peak - peak amplitude and of 1 - 2 s duration ( illustrated in fig. 1 ) .
on some occasions this initial population " spike " was followed by oscillatory activity of lower amplitude , lasting up to approximately 5 s in the neocortex ( see tables 1 , 2 ) .
longer oscillatory activity was recorded in the entorhinal cortex compared to both the hippocampus ( p < 0.001 ) and the neocortex ( p < 0.05 ) .
the frequency of baseline sle activity was significantly higher in recordings from the hippocampus compared to the entorhinal cortex ( p < 0.001 ) and the neocortex ( p < 0.001 ) .
no statistical difference was seen in baseline amplitude between the different brain regions. fig. 1 an example of no - magnesium seizure - like event ( sle ) activity showing an expanded time view on the left and an enlarged view of a single sle on the right table 1 median ( range ) changes in sle - characteristics during propofol administration location baseline last dose end period p value entorhinal cortex amplitude ( microv ) 92.5 ( 23.7 - 341.9 ) 111.3 ( 25.9 - 310 ) 96 ( 36.6 - 429 ) ns frequency (/ min ) 2.0 ( 1.3 - 4.9 ) 0.7 ( 0.3 - 1.1 ) a 0.7 ( 0.3 - 1.4 ) a < 0.0001 * length ( s ) 3.6 ( 1.1 - 9.9 ) 9.1 ( 1.0 - 51.5 ) 18.9 ( 1.1 - 49 ) b 0.0155 * neocortex amplitude ( microv ) 138.7 ( 37 - 494 ) 245.7 ( 34.3 - 615 ) c 229.4 ( 38.8 - 429.2 ) 0.0302 * frequency (/ min ) 2.5 ( 0.6 - 4.4 ) 0.6 ( 0.0 - 3.6 ) d 0.7 ( 0.1 - 4.5 ) d < 0.0001 ** length ( s ) 2.3 ( 1 - 5.1 ) 1.9 ( 0 - 12.6 ) 1.8 ( 1 - 6.5 ) ns * p values generated from repeated measures analysis of variance ( anova ) ** p values generated from freidman test ( nonparametric repeated measures anova ) ap < 0.001 compared to baseline , tukey - kramer multiple comparison test bp < 0.05 compared to baseline , tukey - kramer multiple comparisons test cp < 0.05 compared to baseline , dunn 's multiple comparisons test dp < 0.001 compared to baseline , dunn 's multiple comparisons test table 2 median ( range ) changes in sle - characteristics during etomidate administration location baseline last dose end period p value entorhinal cortex amplitude ( microv ) 79.9 ( 28.3 - 229.8 ) 95.7 ( 20.8 - 172.9 ) 108.0 ( 30.0 - 199.3 ) ns frequency (/ min ) 2.7 ( 0.4 - 4.0 ) 1.2 ( 0.2 - 1.9 ) a 2.7 ( 0.5 - 6.5 ) b 0.0004 * length ( s ) 2.9 ( 2.1 - 143.3 ) 2.5 ( 1.0 - 246.6 ) 3.4 ( 1.3 - 73.7 ) ns neocortex amplitude ( microv ) 136.6 ( 46.8 - 502.6 ) 178.5 ( 75.0 - 663 ) c 141.2 ( 67.4 - 633.0 ) 0.0084 ** frequency (/ min ) 3.4 ( 3.2 - 5.2 ) 1.3 ( 0.3 - 3.4 ) 3.7 ( 0.7 - 12.7 ) 0.0515 ** length ( s ) 2.2 ( 1.2 - 3.4 ) 1.5 ( 1.1 - 1.7 ) 1.7 ( 1.5 - 3.6 ) ns hippocampus amplitude ( microv ) 90.1 ( 11.8 - 280.5 ) 103.8 ( 11.9 - 428.6 ) 135.1 ( 14.3 - 346.6 ) d 0.0398 * frequency (/ min ) 5.8 ( 3.5 - 7.9 ) 2.1 ( 0.1 - 5.1 ) c 4.5 ( 2.3 - 17.6 ) 0.0013 ** length ( s ) 1.1 ( 1.0 - 3.2 ) 1.2 ( 0.9 - 1.7 ) 1.2 ( 1.0 - 3.2 ) ns * p values generated from repeated measures analysis of variance ( anova ) ** p values generated from freidman test ( nonparametric repeated measures anova ) ap < 0.01 compared to baseline , tukey - kramer multiple comparisons test bp < 0.001 compared to last dose , tukey - kramer multiple comparisons test cp < 0.01 compared to baseline , dunn 's multiple comparisons test dp < 0.05 compared to baseline , dunn 's multiple comparisons test effects of propofol on no - mg sle activity recordings during propofol administration showed highly variant changes in activity in the three investigated areas .
most dramatically , in the hippocampus propofol induced a transition from interictal - like sle activity characterised by intermittent unitary sharp waves - - to prolonged ictal - like seizure events .
the characteristics of the latter were not identical in all hippocampal recordings , but two different groups with similar patterns could be identified .
in one group ( n = 4 ) the events started with a period of high frequency " tonic - like " activity that transitioned into " clonic - like " oscillations before terminating ( see fig. 2 ) .
on average one event occurred every 2 - 3 min , with a mean length of 196 s. in the other group ( n = 3 ) , oscillation frequency tended to remain stable throughout the event .
they also occurred every 2 - 3 min , but had a shorter mean length of 37 s. following drug washout , the majority of the recordings returned to the interictal - like activity pattern that was established during baseline .
seven out of ten of the propofol hippocampal recordings exhibited this transition to ictal - like seizure activity , compared with none of eight controls perfused with drug - free no - mg acsf ( p = 0.004 , fisher 's exact test ) .
no ictal - like events occurred in slices perfused with propofol vehicle ( 20 % intralipid ). fig. 2 propofol - induced ictal - like bursting activity in the hippocampus showing a changing pattern of the frequency and amplitude of population activity within each burst .
the top illustration shows a full recording of approximately 9 h. the three lower pictures are enlargements of the grey squares and illustrate : 1 interictal seizure - like event ( sle ) activity before propofol administration ; 2 ictal - like burst during propofol administration with a biphasic change in frequency and amplitude and ; 3 end period where the sle - activity is returning to the interictal sle - activty pattern established during baseline in the two other investigated areas , the entorhinal cortex and the neocortex , no transition to ictal - like seizures were seen during propofol perfusion .
a strong decrease in event frequency was seen after drug administration in both the entorhinal cortex ( p < 0.0001 ) and the neocortex ( p < 0.0001 ) ( table 1 ) .
figure 3 illustrates the profound inhibitory effect of propofol on cortical interictal sle activity ; compared with the ictal events precipitated in the hippocampus ( see fig. 2 ) .
propofol had contrasting effects on sle length and amplitude in the entorhinal and neocortical regions .
in the former , propofol increased the length of sles ( p = 0.0155 ) , while in the neocortex it induced a significant ( p = 0.0302 ) increase in sle amplitude .
these changes were not seen in the control slices perfused with no - mg acsf without drug delivery .
rather , sle frequency during control recordings tended to increase with time , in keeping with previous studies ( voss et al .
2010 ). fig. 3 a full length recording showing the inhibitory effect of propofol on interictal seizure - like event ( sle ) activity in the neocortex .
this recording further illustrates the increase in event amplitude prior to cassation of activity effects of etomidate on no - mg sle - activity one out of ten hippocampal recordings showed a transition to an ictal - like seizure pattern after etomidate administration , a rate not significantly different from the control recordings .
the ictal - like pattern had the same characteristics as shown in fig. 2 for propofol .
otherwise , etomidate had a similar effect on no - mg sle activity in all three brain areas ( see table 2 ) .
a reduction in event frequency was seen in all three locations , although for the neocortex the frequency drop was not quite significant ( p = 0.0515 ) , due to a paradoxical increase in sle frequency in one recording during perfusion of the highest etomidate dose .
like propofol , etomidate induced a significant increase in sle amplitude in the neocortex ( p = 0.0084 ) , as well as in the hippocampus ( p = 0.0398 ) .
etomidate induced no significant changes in the length of sles in any location .
none of these changes were seen in any of the control slices perfused with no - mg without drug delivery .
propofol and etomidate effects on slices perfused with normal acsf neither propofol nor etomidate induced any sign of sle activity in recordings from slices perfused with normal acsf. that is , these slices remained quiescent for the full duration of the recordings , at all locations .
the aim of this study was to investigate whether pro - seizure effects of the general anesthetic propofol could be identified in the in vitro cortical slice - - and whether seizure susceptibility was related to the prior state of the tissue and / or anatomical location .
most notably , propofol consistently induced prolonged ictal - like seizure events in the hippocampus following pre - exposure to no - mg acsf .
the hippocampal ictal - like events closely resembled tonic - clonic seizures recorded from the electroencephalogram in vivo ( jensen and yaari 1997 ) .
the results support in vivo findings showing that propofol has the capacity to promote seizure activity - - and suggest that subcortical regions may be particularly susceptible .
the pro - seizure effects were observed on a background of epileptiform " spiking " activity induced by magnesium removal from the acsf , a state that can be likened to the interictal epileptic brain .
thus , the results are also consistent with in vivo studies showing that propofol is more likely to promote epileptiform activity when there is an underlying seizure predisposition ( hodkinson et al. 1987 ; makela et al. 1993 ; wang et al. 1997 ) .
in addition , propofol strongly inhibited sle activity in the neocortex , confirming its dual anti - and pro - convulsant properties ( bevan 1993 ). by comparison , etomidate evoked few excitatory effects within the slice .
it shared with propofol a tendency to enhance sle amplitude in the neocortex and hippocampus , but otherwise reduced the frequency of sle activity in all investigated areas .
this was surprising on two levels .
firstly , etomidate and propofol are thought to share a similar gabaergic mechanism of action ( franks 2006 ) ; and secondly , etomidate is more well - known than propofol for its pro - seizure effects ( modica et al. 1990 ) .
an explanation for this difference is not forthcoming from this study , although a number of speculative hypotheses could be postulated .
these include , but are not limited to : localised hippocampal expression of gabaa subtypes that are differentially sensitive to etomidate and propofol ; differences in the capacity for propofol and etomidate to directly activate gabaa receptors and ; differential effects of propofol and etomidate on nakcc1 and kcc2 chloride transporters such that a chloride imbalance is facilitated by the former .
however , the balance of evidence does not lend strong support to any one of these .
for example , while alpha4 and alpha5 - containing gabaa receptors show enhanced expression in the hippocampus compared to the cerebral cortex ( sieghart and sperk 2002 ) , etomidate and propofol exhibit similar activation profiles for these gabaa subtypes ( bai et al. 2001 ; caraiscos et al. 2004 ; meera et al. 2009 ) .
furthermore , both propofol and etomidate directly activate gabaa to approximately 25 % of the maximum current induced by endogenous gaba ( siegwart et al. 2002 ) .
finally , the only documented effect of propofol on chloride handling is facilitation of kcc2 ( wang et al .
2006 ) , which would tend to limit the development of depolarising gabaa effects .
although widely thought to act specifically on gabaa receptors , propofol has additional actions that could contribute to its propensity to induce excitatory effects .
three possibilities present themselves .
firstly , reports indicate that glutamatergic effects may be relevant to propofol 's mechanism of action ( yiqing et al. 2014 ) .
in particular , propofol increases glua1 ampa receptor phosphorylation at serine 831 ( s831 ) in the mouse hippocampus but not in the prefrontal cortex ( mao et al. 2014 ) .
s831 phosphorylation in glua1 ampa - receptors increases single channel conductance ( jenkins and traynelis 2012 ) and potentiates ltp ( wang et al. 2014 ) .
this represents a promising , but as yet untested potential mechanism for propofol - mediated , hippocampal - specific excitatory effects .
secondly , schwieler et al. have shown that propofol is an agonist of metabotropic gabab - receptors ( schwieler et al. 2003 ) .
interestingly , baclofen ( a gabab agonist ) inhibits hippocampal inter - ictal activity , but in so doing facilitates ictal - like activity ( swartzwelder et al .
1987 ) , an effect remarkably similar to that observed in our study .
we have shown in unrelated experiments that the gabab agonist baclofen enhances the length of sle activity in the neocortex ( unpublished data ) .
an excitatory gabab effect could be mediated by a pre - synaptic gabab autoreceptor action that acts to inhibit the release of gaba ( dugladze et al. 2013 ) .
finally , propofol inhibits hyperpolarisation - activated cation currents ( ih ) in both cortical ( chen et al. 2005 ) and hippocampal ( funahashi et al. 2004 ) regions .
this is an important point of distinction between propofol and etomidate , as the latter does not block ih ( chen et al. 2009 ) .
a reduction in ih has been implicated as a mechanism supporting epileptogenesis ( wierschke et al .
2010 ) , which could occur secondary to an increase in neuronal input resistance resulting in enhanced epsp amplitude ( magee 1998 ) ; and / or a loss of membrane stabilisation resulting in prolongation of oscillatory field potential activity ( he et al. 2014 ) .
the no - magnesium in vitro slice model was used in this study because it is a recognised and widely used method to investigate mechanisms of epilepsy ( isaev et al. 2012 ; liu et al. 2010 ) .
in particular , the pattern of no - magnesium sle activity resembles the interictal state in epileptics .
the inherent limitations of an in vivo animal model such as this are countered by the ability to stringently control experimental conditions and isolate effects and mechanisms to particular structures .
in the case of this study it allowed us to differentiate effects to the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in complete isolation from subcortical influences .
conclusions in conclusion , the results support the contention that propofol has the capacity to promote seizure activity , particularly in the hippocampus and when there is an underlying seizure predisposition .
the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear , but appears to be independent of the seizure - promoting action of etomidate .
this study establishes a model for exploring the mechanisms by which propofol promotes subcortical seizure activity .
methods the method of euthanasia was approved by the waikato ethics committee at the university of waikato , hamilton , new zealand .
preparation of slices brain slices were investigated from 30 wild type mice of c57 , 129sv and c57 / 129sv genetic background .
the animals were 1 - 6 months old , both sexes and kept with unlimited access to water and food in a 12 - h day / night cycle .
all age ranges were represented in all experimental groups .
the mice were anesthetised with carbon dioxide and the brain dissected and transferred directly to ice - cold carbogenated ( 95 % o2 , 5 % co2 ) " normal " artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) composed of 125 mm nacl , 2.5 mm kcl , 1 mm mgcl2 , 2 mm cacl2 , 1.25 mm nah2po4 , 26 mm nahco3 and 10 mm glucose .
to maximise the number of slices containing the hippocampus , the brain was sectioned ( 400 mum , campden instruments ltd , sileby , leics , uk ) coronally between bregma 0 to - 5 mm. thereafter , the slices were allowed at least 1 h of recovery at room temperature ( 19 - 23 degreesc ) in either normal acsf or magnesium - free ( no - mg ) acsf , depending on the experiments .
no - mg acsf was composed of 124 mm nacl , 5 mm kcl , 2 mm cacl2 , 1.25 mm nah2po4 , 26 mm nahco3 and 10 mm glucose .
the acsf solutions were used for no longer than 1 week following storage at 1 - 4 degreesc .
electrical recording of field potential activity after recovery , one slice at a time was physically divided using a scalpel blade to isolate the cerebral cortex from the hippocampus ; and one hemisphere from the other ( see fig. 4 ) .
this was to ensure that recordings from the cerebral cortex were independent of the hippocampus and vice versa .
each slice was then transferred to a submersion - style bath perfused with carbogenated normal or no - mg acsf , depending on the experiment being performed .
perfusion was by gravity feed at a flow rate of 5 ml / min .
the flow rate was checked repeatedly during the recordings to ensure it remained stable. fig. 4 picture of a mouse brain slice with each of the recording regions numbered adjacent to the respective electrodes .
the lines illustrate where the slice was physically sectioned to isolate the cortex from the hippocampus .
1 the neocortex , 2 the hippocampus and 3 the entorhinal cortex extracellular field potential activity was recorded from one to three 25 microm teflon - coated tungsten electrodes , positioned in the neocortex , entorhinal cortex and hippocampus .
for the neocortex no particular subregion was targeted and included the posterior parietal association , retrosplenial , primary somatosensory , primary motor , piriform , visual and auditory cortical areas .
in the hippocampus electrodes were placed in the ca1 , ca3 or dentate gyrus areas .
recordings were amplified ( 1000x , a - m systems , usa or 250x kerr tissue recording system , kerr scientific instruments , christchurch , new zealand ) , ad - converted ( power 1401 , ced , uk or powerlab , adinstruments , sydney , australia ) and stored on computer ( spike2 , ced , uk or labchart , adinstruments , sydney , australia ) for later offline analysis using matlab software .
the recordings were low - pass filtered at either 1000 or 100 hz ( ced and powerlab , respectively ) and high - pass filtered at 1 hz. all of the experiments were performed in a faraday shielded room to minimize electrical noise in the recordings .
drug preparation and delivery propofol was prepared as a 1 % solution of 2,6 diisopropylphenol 97 + % ( safc supply solutions , usa ) in 20 % intralipid ( fresenius kabi ab , sweden ) and etomidate as the commercially available hypnomidate solution ( janssen - cilag , belgium ) .
the drug concentrations used were 28 , 56 and 84 mum for propofol and 8 , 16 and 24 mum for etomidate .
in each case the appropriate amount of each drug was added directly to pre - carbogenated acsf .
the concentrations were calculated to give tissue levels similar to that achieved clinically for surgical anesthesia , based on the diffusion charactersitics of etomidate into brain slice tissue and the relative clinical potencies of etomidate and propofol .
thus , at a slice recording depth of 100 - 200 mum , it takes approximately 10 - 15 min for the tissue concentration of etomidate to reach half of the drug concentration in the perfusion bath ( benkwitz et al. 2007 ) .
for our lowest etomidate concentration this equates to a tissue concentration of 4 mum .
in rodents , a brain effect - site etomidate concentration of 13 mum induces a surgical level of anesthesia ( de paepe et al. 1999 ) .
our relatively higher propofol concentrations were based on clinical data showing that etomidate is approximately five times more potent than propofol ( avramov et al. 1995 ) .
experimental protocols experiments were performed in either normal or no - mg acsf .
in the case of the former , no baseline sle activity was established in the tissue , according to standard practice .
under these conditions , viable tissue shows a transient burst of high frequency activity ( see fig. 5 ) when an electrode is inserted into the tissue ( voss et al. 2013 ) .
all recordings in normal acsf showed this characteristic response .
when using no - mg acsf , sle activity was already established in the tissue and recordings were made from locations where robust and stable activity was found .
in these cases , at least 10 min of stable sle activity was recorded prior to delivery of the first anesthetic concentration .
a corresponding " baseline " time - period was allowed for slices in normal acsf .
thereafter , either propofol ( n = 27 in no - mg and n = 7 in normal acsf ) or etomidate ( n = 19 in no - mg and n = 12 in normal acsf ) were delivered at three increasing concentrations at 30 min intervals. fig. 5 illustration from one slice perfused with normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) showing a burst of high frequency activity upon electrode insertion .
this characteristic response was used as a gauge of tissue viability in slices perfused with normal acsf , which do not ordinarily express seizure - like event activity the no - mg experiments were terminated when either the maximum anesthetic concentration was reached or sle frequency dropped to 50 % of that established during baseline .
when one of these criteria was met for all recordings in the slice , wash - out with drug - free acsf followed .
wash out was continued for 40 min or until the return of sle activity could be confirmed .
to control for the possibility of time effects : 3 slices were perfused with no - mg acsf with addition of three consecutive doses of drug - free 20 % intralipid solution equivalent in amount to the propofol experiments ; and 13 slices were perfused with no - mg acsf for at least 3 h without delivery of anesthetic .
all slices were photographed and recording locations identified in consultation with the allen interactive brain atlas .
statistical analysis for 36 out of a total of 178 recording locations , the protocol was not completed for one or other of the following reasons : 10 min of stable baseline no - mg sle activity was not achieved .
return of stable no - mg sle activity was not achieved during drug wash out , a burst of activity with electrode insertion could not be identified in normal acsf recordings .
stable no - mg sle activity could not be achieved for a minimum of three hours during control recordings .
electrodes were inadvertently moved during recording .
these recordings were excluded from the study , giving a total of 142 recordings for statistical analysis .
during the course of the experiments , it became apparent that propofol was inducing a unique pattern of activity in the majority of hippocampal recordings , characterised by a transition from interictal - like sle activity into long ictal - like bursts ( see " results and discussion " for details ) .
the propofol hippocampal data was therefore analysed as a separate group by quantifying the proportion of recordings exhibiting ictal - like bursting versus interictal - like sle activity using the fisher 's exact test .
the qualitative characteristics of these recordings were assessed in detail .
the remainder of the data were analysed in matlab for changes in sle amplitude , frequency and length .
background noise and artefacts were first removed by visual inspection .
the data were then quantified and averaged over three time periods covering : baseline 10 min before drug delivery .
last dose 30 min during perfusion of either the maximum drug concentration or that concentration required to effect a 50 % reduction in sle frequency .
the 30 min analysis period was offset by 10 min from the start of perfusion of the relevant concentration , since at a flow rate of 5 ml / min , 10 min is needed for the drug concentration in the perfusion bath to equilibrate ( data not shown ) .
end period the last 30 - 40 min of recording following drug washout .
in the control slices , corresponding time frames were selected .
for a small proportion of recordings ( 10 out of 142 ) the automated matlab scripts failed to accurately report sle length .
in these cases sle length was manually quantified and averaged across five sequential sles corresponding to equivalent time points in the recordings .
graphpad ( graphpad software inc 2003 , v3.06 ) was used for all statistical analyses .
data normality was tested using the kolmogorov - smirnov test , and parametric or non - parametric anova and pair - wise tests applied as appropriate .
the data are presented as median ( range ) .
a p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .

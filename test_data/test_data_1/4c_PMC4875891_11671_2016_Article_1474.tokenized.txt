the sodium lignosulfonate amount used in our synthetic route is able to fine - tune zno morphology and an abundance of pores have been observed in the nanoflake - array - flower zno , which result in specific surface area reaching as high as 82.9 m2 . g - 1 .
the synthesized zno exhibits superior photocatalytic activity even under low - power uv illumination ( 6 w ) .
it is conjectured that both nanoflake - array structure and plenty of pores embedded in zno flakes may provide scaffold microenvironments to enhance photocatalytic activity .
additionally , this catalyst can be used repeatedly without a significant loss in photocatalytic activity .
the low - cost , simple synthetic approach as well as high photocatalytic and recycling efficiency of our zno nanomaterials allows for application to treat wastewater containing organic pollutants in an effective way .

as a low - cost renewable biomass resource , lignin is the most abundant organic material in nature [ 2 ] .
it is derived from black liquor generated in the pulping process .
every year , tens of million tons of lignin are produced all over the world [ 3 ] unfortunately , most of them are discarded as waste , greatly contaminating our environment , while only a small part is inferiorly used .
therefore , exploration on high - effective utilization of lignin not only makes good use of natural resource but also protects the environment from pollution of black liquor [ 4 , 5 ] .
sodium lignosulfonate ( sl for short ) is one of the most important derivatives of lignin .
lignosulfonate can be obtained by the sulfonated modification of lignin .
moreover , sl itself is a by - product of sulfite pulp and paper industry .
it is a biomacromolecule polyelectrolyte and can act as an anionic surfactant [ 6 ] , because of its highly cross - linked polymers formed by various hydrophobic phenylpropanoid units and diverse hydrophilic groups .
various active functional groups ensure its favorable water solubility and effective surface charges .
in different solvents , sl can form associations and the degree of associations changes according to the environment of the solution ( such as sl concentration , the type of the solvents , and ion strength ) .
the aggregation state of sl will change as a result of the existence of electrostatic repulsion [ 7 - 9 ] .
spheroidal shape and irregularly disk - like shape of sl in different conditions were corroborated by previous works [ 10 ] .
the layer - by - layer self - assembly of sl can also easily be produced in saline solution because of its capability of binding transition metal ions such as cu2 + and zn2 + .
[ 11 ] .
all of these outstanding performances have enabled sl to be applied in the synthesis of nanoparticles of transition metal oxide .
zno , as a typical transition metal oxide , has recently attracted increasing attention in view of its outstanding properties [ 12 - 15 ] .
all these provide zno with diverse applications in dye - sensitized solar cell , nanoimprint lithography , drug delivery , and photocatalysis .
particularly , zno has excited much interest of researchers because of photocatalytically degrading organic pollutants and is becoming more promising alternative to tio2 .
it has well established that properties and performance of zno strongly depend on its structure and morphology [ 16 ] .
a variety of znos have been fabricated to meet practical applications [ 17 - 19 ] .
more fascinating merits have been found for hierarchical three - dimensionally ( 3d ) porous micro - / nano - architecture zno , which is self - assembled by low - dimensional nano - sized building blocks .
the high porosity of hierarchical 3d zno greatly facilitates gas diffusion and mass transport in sensor and surface chemical reaction materials [ 20 ] .
however , most of the synthetic methods for these complex structures are restricted because of requiring rigorous conditions .
apart from morphology discussed above , specific surface area is also one of the important factors to affect zno properties .
so far , the specific surface area of commercial zno is very low , ranging 4 - 5 m2 . g - 1 .
using highly ordered mesoporous carbon templates , polarz and co - workers synthesized zno of 195 m2 . g - 1 [ 21 ] .
larger surface area of 305 m2 . g - 1 was achieved by goswami et al. , in which the use for drug delivery was emphasized and synthetic details were not clearly described [ 22 ] .
although with relatively high surface area , the above zno does not show the hierarchical architecture .
currently , lower than 50 m2 . g - 1 specific surface area has been reported for zno having the hierarchical structure [ 23 - 25 ] .
therefore , it is highly demanded to synthesize zno materials having both 3d hierarchical architecture and high specific surface area , especially in the case of using a simple and economical approach with a low - cost surfactant .
in our previous work , we have developed a preparation method of zno using the sl [ 26 , 27 ] .
the prepared zno shows good catalytic performance with specific surface area about 20 - 30 m2 . g - 1 .
on the basis of previous work , the mixed solvent approach xhas been developed for the synthesis of zno nanomaterials .
hierarchically porous flake - array - flower structure with high specific surface area has been successfully fabricated .
its photocatalytic performance was tested , and the corresponding growth process and possible mechanism have been proposed .
herein , we have used the cost - effective sl surfactant , derived from industrially discarded lignin .
so , this study allows for not only effective utilization of resources and protection of environment but also a good way of massively producing hierarchical porous nanomaterials of zno .
methods in this work , zno architectures were synthesized by a surfactant - assistant solution - based method .
zinc acetate ( zn ( oac ) 2 . 2h2o ) ( fuchen chemical factory , tianjin ) was taken as zn2 + source and sodium hydroxide ( naoh ) ( tianda chemical corp. , tianjin ) was used as the precipitating agent .
sl ( tumen qianjinfuli chemical co. ltd. ) was used as surfactant material .
according to manufacturer 's specifications , the parameters of the sl is that ph = 4.5 - 6 , water content <= 8.5 % , insoluble matter <= 1.0 % , sugar content <= 12.0 % , ca and mg content <= 1.5 % , and inorganic salt ( na2so4 ) <= 5.0 % .
in a typical experiment , 7 g of sl was added to 50 ml of deionized water to form the surfactant solution. and 3.5 g of zinc acetate ( 0.53 m ) was dissolved to 30 ml deionized water forming the zn2 + solution .
these two solutions were mixed under stirring and then 100 - ml anhydrous ethanol was added to this mixed solution .
we added 20 ml of naoh ( 2.5 m ) solution into the above mixture dropwise .
the final solution was kept stirring for 30 min to form a homogeneous precursor solution .
finally , the precursor solution was kept stirring in 80 degreesc water bath for 5 h. precipitate was harvested by centrifugation and washed and dried at 50 degreesc .
then , the as - obtained powders were calcined in air atmosphere at 500 degreesc for 2 h to obtain the final zno product .
x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were recorded on a rigaku d / max - rc diffractometer using cu kalpha radiation , and scans were performed from ( 2theta ) 5degrees to 80degrees by rate 4degrees / min .
scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) images were taken with a field emission microscope fei sirion .
the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) images and high - resolution tem ( hrtem ) images of the samples were performed on a jem - 2100 electron microscope ( jeol , japan ) with an acceleration voltage of 200 kv. carbon - coated copper grids were used as the sample holders .
brunauer - emmett - teller ( bet ) nitrogen adsorption - desorption experiments were carried out on the automated surface area and pore - size analyzer ( st - 2000 ) .
the photocatalytic activity of the prepared hierarchical zno to decompose the methylene blue ( mb ) was investigated .
in the experiment , 0.1 g zno was dispersed in 40 ml of mb ( 10 mg . l - 1 ) solution. and the stirring suspensions were exposed to the uv irradiation ( 6 w , 365 nm , wfh - 203 ) under ambient conditions .
after being kept in the dark for 30 min , the solution reaches the absorption - desorption equilibrium .
the distance between uv light and the photoreaction vessel is 12 cm. in order to evaluate the efficiency of the degradation processes , the suspension was analyzed at a definite time interval , by recording variations at the maximum absorption around lambda = 664 nm using a uv - vis spectrophotometer ( shanghaijingmi instrument co. , ltd. uv762 ) .
results and discussion xrd measurement x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns were recorded to investigate the phase and purity of the synthesized product .
we have illustrated in fig. 1 the xrd patterns of the synthesized zno with and without calcination .
as seen in fig. 1a in the case of non - calcination , except for characteristic peaks of zno phase , the diffraction peaks of zn ( oh ) 2 are also present ( jcpds no. 20 - 1435 ) .
previous reports indicated that the direct synthesis of zinc oxide would result in impurity of more or less zinc hydroxide at a low temperature [ 12 ] .
subsequent calcination enables the xrd pattern to exhibit pure zno characteristic peaks .
it is illustrated from fig. 1b that all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed as the hexagonal wurtzite crystalline structure ( jcpds no. 36 - 1451 ) .
this also confirms that precursor of zinc hydroxide phase has been fully decomposed to zno .
meanwhile , one can see that , upon calcining , peak intensities of zno are obviously enhanced compared to those of non - calcined zno .
this testifies that pure and well crystallinity of zno would be obtained by calcination .
the mean crystallite size of calcined zno was computed to be about 21.8 nm via measurement of the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of zno ( 101 ) diffraction peak using scherrer formula. fig. 1 xrd patterns of zno ( a ) non - calcined ( red line ) ( b ) calcined ( black line ) at 500 degreesc for 2 h synthetic condition and sem effect of sl on zno morphology it is well known that the added amount of surfactant has a significant effect on morphology of formed nanomaterials .
to obtain a suitable architecture of zno that is helpful for subsequent photocatalysis , a series of experiments were performed with the variation of amount of sl from 0 to 11 g. building on above xrd results , all these prepared samples will be calcined to obtain well - crystallized zno .
their sem images are presented in fig. 2. when we do not add the sl surfactant in the synthesis , farfetched zno fragments were obtained ( fig. 2a ) .
upon adding 1 - 3 g sl , relatively small slices of zno were formed ( fig. 2b , c ) , albeit with irregular shape .
these desultory slices were transformed into flocculent zno clusters when 5 g sl was used during the synthesis ( fig. 2d ) .
in the case of increasing amount of sl to 7 g , we obtained 3d hierarchical zno architectures in fig. 2e .
this sample is featured with flower - like morphology .
moreover , some pores were observed on it. with further increasing sl to 9 g ( fig. 2f ) , many zno particles were emerged although still having partial micro - flower structure .
it was observed that morphology like broccoli in nature is formed when more sl was added ( 11 g , in fig. 2g ) .
it shows a relatively broad size distribution of 300 ~ 750 nm , resulting from agglomeration of sub - crystals .
our present studies indicate that the added amount of sl can fine - tune the morphology of synthesized zno .
the 7 g sl is optimal amount to prepare the uniform hierarchical flower - like zno architectures. fig. 2 sem images of zno with amount of sl of : ( a ) 0 g , ( b ) 1 g , ( c ) 3 g , ( d ) 5 g , ( e ) 7 g ( f ) 9 g , and ( g ) 11 g calcination and cosurfactant of ethanol in the assistance of 7 g sl surfactant , we will discuss effect of the calcination and the use of cosurfactant of ethanol on morphology of synthesized zno nanomaterials .
first , the calcining procedure is addressed while the ethanol cosurfactant is used in the synthesis .
morphologies of calcined and non - calcined zno have been pictured in fig. 3a , b , respectively .
these sem images indicate that both products consist of a large number of three - dimensional ( 3d ) flower - like microsized zno with the mean size of 4 - 5 mum .
meanwhile , all zno flowers show plentiful pores on every petal .
comparatively , smooth surface is observed for a part of assembled microflowers in the non - calcined zno except porous flower zno ( fig. 3b ) .
the smooth surface may be composed by zn ( oh ) 2 , sl , and zno composites. and it will produce more porous zno on the flower petal after calcination. fig. 3 sem images of the 7 g sl synthesized zno with conditions of ( a ) calcination and ethanol , ( b ) non - calcination and ethanol , and ( c ) calcination and no addition of ethanol the effect of ethanol on the formation of the zno hierarchical flower - like structure has been examined as seen in fig. 3a , c. also , both optimal 7 g sl surfactant and calcination were used .
addition of ethanol to the reaction solution results in much more regular zno slices in fig. 3a than those in fig. 3c .
it is rationalized that ethanol raised surface activity of sl and enhanced its coordination to zn2 + ions .
at the same time , once nuclei of zno were formed in the solution , the presence of ethanol decreases solubility of zno , which makes it easy to form small size nanostructure and eventually produces a hierarchical structure .
structural properties of optimal sample and thus , the sample was synthesized with the 7 g sl and ethanol cosurfactant , followed by a calcining procedure .
closer inspection ( fig. 4a , b ) reveals that the surface morphology of single cambered lamina is composed of numerous zno nanoflake array .
these nanoflake arrays almost stand vertically on the 2d lamina and cross - link and even overlap with each other by the edge to form networks as porous lamina structures .
this special structure was also caused by the hydrolysis of the initial zn ( oh ) 2 matrix as well as the shrink of zno crystals during the calcination .
it is consistent with xrd results and previous works about the hierarchical porous zno structures by calcining [ zn5 ( co3 ) 2 ( oh ) 6 ] precursor .
herein , we developed a method with introducing derivative of industrially discarded waste to synthesize hierarchical porous zno architectures. fig. 4 images of the hierarchical flower - like zno nanostructure : a high - magnification sem , b high - magnification sem with 500 nm , c tem , and d hrtem further detailed structural analysis of individual porous lamina was carried out using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) and high - resolution tem ( hrtem ) .
the tem image of the edge part of single flower - like zno shows that each lamina is constructed from agglomerative nanoflakes , which is featured with a wide size distribution ranging from 20 to 80 nm ( fig. 4c ) .
it is found that sizes measured from tem are larger than those calculated by scherrer 's equation according to xrd .
this discrepancy is attributed to the aspect ratio for non - spherically shaped crystallites , as well as the fwhm by the microstrain in the crystallite [ 28 ] .
these cross - linked nanoflakes show abundant porous structure , in accordance with the sem results .
meanwhile , some mesopores with several nanometers in size can be clearly observed , which are scattering in the nanoflake array .
well - resolved two - dimensional lattice fringes observed in the hrtem image ( fig. 4d ) suggest good crystallinity of our synthesized nanoparticles .
the interplanar distances between adjacent lattice planes were calculated to be 0.26 and 0.28 nm. they are attributed to d - spacing ( 002 ) and ( 100 ) planes of zno in the wurtzite phase , respectively .
specific surface areas of the calcined zno prepared with different amount of sl were determined by bet method as shown in fig. 5a .
one can see that the bet - specific surface areas of zno are strongly affected by the added amount of sl used in the preparation .
if sl is not added , then obtained area is as low as 16.7 m2 . g - 1 .
in contrast , upon adding sl , even only 1 g , the specific surface area of synthesized zno will exceed 50 m2 . g - 1 .
this results from sl guiding the formation of zno architecture .
in assistance of 7 g sl , the synthesized nanoflake - array - flower zno has the largest specific surface area , reaching as high as 82.9 m2 . g - 1 .
to our best of knowledge , the specific surface area of all the reported zno having the hierarchical structure remains lower than 50 m2 . g - 1 [ 23 , 25 ] .
notably , our zno displays much larger specific surface area , i.e. , 30 m2 . g - 1 larger than previously reported value. fig. 5 a specific surface areas of zno synthesized by sl surfactant , whose amount is presented .
b nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms and the corresponding plots of barrett - joyner - halenda ( bjh ) pore - size distribution for the porous zno synthesized with 7 g sl abundant pores in our synthesized zno materials are also evidenced by nitrogen adsorption - desorption isotherms and barrett - joyner - halenda ( bjh ) pore - size distribution ( fig. 5b ) .
the measurements find two kinds of pores in the nanoflake - array - flower zno .
first is small mesopores , whose diameters range from 3 to 4 nm. they are formed by interconnected individual zno nanocrystallites .
meso and macropores are the second kind .
their diameters are relatively large , about 80 nm. these pores are constructed by nanoflakes' interlacing , as observed in sem images fig. 4a , b ) .
formation mechanism it has been well established that sl is polyphenolic material , made from the copolymerization of three phenylpropanoid monomers such as coniferyl , sinapyl , and p - coumaryl alcohol .
due to containing both rich hydrophilic and hydrophobic sites , the macromolecular sl would form a structure of layer - by - layer self - assembly [ 11 ] in controlled experimental condition .
as a polar crystal , zno is known to possess partially positively charged zn2 + - terminated ( 001 ) and negatively charged o2 - - terminated ( 00 \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$ \ overline { 1 } $$\ end { document } 1 ) polar surfaces .
it is evident that zno was reported to show the flower - like morphology [ 25 , 29 ] .
in the current experiment , it is deduced that the polar zno nanoseeds could be adsorbed onto the negative - charged surface of sl and then form the zno - sl composite with layer - by - layer structure .
this shaped structure would induce nanoflakes to grow on the petal zno flower in a perpendicular direction .
meanwhile , electrostatic attractive interaction between the zno and sl layer are enhanced by ethanol co - solvent .
consequently , the flake - array hierarchical flower - like zno is constructed upon removing the sl. see the description of the process in scheme 1 .
scheme 1 formation of nanoflake - array - flower zno the association degree and the aggregation shape of sl are significantly affected by the sl concentration [ 9 ] .
for example , low concentration sl , using 1 ~ 3 g amount , shows relatively weak surface activity [ 13 ] ; as a result , irregular slices of zno are formed [ 18 ] .
too much amount of sl ( for instance 11 g ) added into the reaction system would destroy the layer - by - layer structure of sl , yielding the broccoli - like zno [ 30 ] .
in contrast , suitable sl concentration ( 7 g sl in 200 ml solvents ) would retain surface activity as well as facilitate its lay - by - lay self - assembly. and hierarchical nanoflake - array - flower zno materials with high surface area are fabricated .
in brief , the formation of final zno architecture is attributed to a synergistic effect , i.e. , the sl aggregation shape and the electrostatic attraction between sl and polar zno crystals .
the absorption of zno enhances the layer - by - layer shape of sl , which in turn induces the zno to form flake - based structural unit and then self - assembly superstructures .
photocatalytic performance given their porosity significantly facilitating mass transportation in photocatalytic process , hierarchically porous zno structures , especially with high specific surface area , are attractive to photocatalytically degrade organic pollutants in aqueous solution .
the present hierarchical nanoflake - array - flower architecture is expected to exhibit excellent photocatalytic property .
in the work , photocatalytic performance of the nanoflake - array - flower zno has been evaluated by photodegrading methylene blue ( mb ) , which is a typical pollutant in the textile industry. by irradiation with uv lamination in low power ( 6 w ) , the degradation percentage of mb achieved 93 % within 1.5 h ( fig. 6a ) .
nearly all of the mb molecules were decomposed after 2 h. to further assess the photocatalytic activity , we have compared degradation ability of our zno with degussa p25 tio2 that is highly efficient photocatalyst .
it is clearly seen from fig. 6a that the nanoflake - array - flower zno shows a photocatalytic activity comparable to that of degussa p25 tio2 , and even better in some cases .
the present study indicates that our zno is actually superior to p25 , as our zno was prepared with the renewable and cost - effective biomass sl surfactant .
the utilization of this surfactant greatly protects the environment , for lignin is present in black liquor of industrial waste .
furthermore , the recycling photocatalytic performance of zno was also evaluated .
in each circulation , the irradiating time is 2 h. it is shown in fig. 6b that highly photocatalytic activity is well retained even after re - using four cycles .
therefore , our prepared flower - like zno may be highly promising for photocatalytic application due to its excellent photocatalytic activity , good re - using performance as well as low cost. fig. 6 a photocatalytic degradation curves of mb solution under uv illumination .
b re - using activity of zno to photodegrade mb conclusions a sl - assisted self - assembly of certain morphology of zno architecture has been achieved via a simple precipitation synthetic approach .
various morphologies of zno have been fabricated by fine - tuning amount of sl. it is revealed that a suitable amount plays an important role in self - assembly forming the hierarchical nanoflake - array - flower morphology of zno .
the interesting architecture is featured with assembled lamina , while each lamina is constructed from agglomerative sub - level nanoflake array .
a wide size distribution ranging from 20 to 80 nm was measured for these nanoflakes .
it is observed in the flower - like zno that nanoflakes are standing perpendicularly to face of the lamina .
all these structural arrangement has eventually resulted in a great increase of specific surface area of zno , reaching as high as 82.9 m2 . g - 1 .
this surface area is much higher than those of reported zno materials with 3d hierarchical nanostructure .
the formation mechanism of this nanostructure has been proposed as a synergistic effect of the sl aggregation shape and polar zno crystals .
the hierarchical nanoflake - array - flower zno has been examined to show a superior photocatalytic performance of degrading methylene blue , even under a very low - power uv illumination .
this is attributed to both featured hierarchical nanostructure and high surface area of our zno .
its abundant pores and nanoflake array , simultaneously , may serve as scaffold microenvironments , which would enhance photocatalytic activity .
it is found that photocatalytic efficiency of our zno is comparable to that of degussa p25 tio2 .
moreover , a perfect durability in the photodegradation of mb has been observed for our hierarchical zno .
in the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructure zno , the cost - effective sl surfactant has successfully applied , allowing for a large - scale production .
moreover , sl is derived from renewable biomass lignin that is main component of black liquor from the pulping industry and is usually discarded as waste .
so the use of sl would not only recycle industrial waste and protect environment but also extend application of renewable lignin in adding its value .
in brief , our facile and low - cost synthetic approach is expected to be promising for the preparation of zno - based photocatalyst materials .

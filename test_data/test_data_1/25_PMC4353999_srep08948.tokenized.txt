however , it is still a challenge to support viability and regulate phenotypic activities of cells in a structurally stable gel , because the gel becomes less permeable with increasing rigidity .
to resolve this challenge , this study demonstrates a unique method to enhance the permeability of a cell - laden hydrogel while avoiding a significant change in rigidity of the gel .
inspired by the grooved skin textures of marine organisms , a hydrogel is assembled to present computationally optimized micro - sized grooves on the surface .
separately , a gel is engineered to preset aligned microchannels similar to a plant 's vascular bundles through a uniaxial freeze - drying process .
the resulting gel displays significantly increased water diffusivity with reduced changes of gel stiffness , exclusively when the microgrooves and microchannels are aligned together .
no significant enhancement of rehydration is achieved when the microgrooves and microchannels are not aligned .
such material design greatly enhances viability and neural differentiation of stem cells and 3d neural network formation within the gel .
design of hydrogels used for 3d cell immobilization and culture has focused mainly on tailoring permeability , which significantly affects molecular transport and subsequent viability and phenotypic activities of cells1234 .
it is common to modulate the gel permeability by controlling the number of cross - links and / or introducing micropores567 .
for example , a hydrogel formulated to have a smaller number of cross - linking junctions presents larger pores , and , subsequently , an increased molecular diffusivity in the matrix .
separately , micropores introduced into a hydrogel contribute to increasing permeability of the gel ; however , uncontrollable numbers of non - passing and isolated pores limit the range of control over permeability6 .
more importantly , these traditional approaches dramatically decrease rigidity and negatively influence the structural integrity of a hydrogel , specifically in a condition subject to external mechanical forces8 .
interestingly , several marine organisms present unique microstructure to facilitate molecular transports through their elastic tissue .
for instance , the skin of blue whales and brain corals exhibit grooved textures so that the skin can uptake a larger mass of molecules including water when compared to flat - surfaced skin9 .
separately , most plants present anisotropically aligned vascular bundles throughout their stems , so water and nutrients taken up by the root are supplied to all parts of the plant body10 .
inspired by these natural systems , we hypothesized that a hydrogel engineered to present microgrooves on its surface would significantly elevate gel permeability without appreciably changing the mechanical properties of the gel ( figure 1 ) .
additionally , incorporation of microchannels into the microgrooved gel would further improve mass transports through the gel , specifically when microchannels are aligned with microgrooves on the surface .
we examined this hypothesis by introducing microgrooves on an alginate gel surface using a microstamping technique .
a diffusion - based computational simulation was used to guide the geometry of microgrooves .
the microgrooved hydrogel was also uniaxially frozen , and lyophilized in order to create microchannels .
microgrooves and microchannels were aligned in parallel with or orthogonal to the microgrooves to systematically evaluate effects of alignments11 .
permeability of a resulting hydrogel was evaluated by measuring water diffusivity in the gel using magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) system .
multipotent , bone marrow - derived stem cells ( bmscs ) were cultured in these hydrogels to evaluate the effect of gel permeability on viability and neural differentiation of stem cells .
taken together , the results of this study will greatly serve to improve controllability of transport and mechanical properties of a wide array of materials used for cell - based bioscience and bioengineering studies .
results and discussion simulation - guided assembly of microgrooved hydrogels first , a 2d finite element method - based computational simulation was conducted to understand and optimize the geometry of microgrooves that can significantly enhance molecular diffusion into a gel ( figure 2a ) .
assuming that molecular transport into a gel was solely controlled by diffusion , oxygen concentration was determined by simulating both the oxygen diffusion rate into a gel and the oxygen consumption rate121314 by cells loaded in a hydrogel using eq .
( 1 ). where cl is the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the media , t is time , dl is the diffusivity of oxygen in a media , is the oxygen consumption rate per cell , and xv is the cell density .
the grooves with a depth of 500 mum were simulated while varying the spacing of grooves from 250 to 500 and 1,000 mum .
the simulation exhibited that oxygen concentration is dependent on the spacing between microgrooves on the gel surface .
specifically , oxygen concentration in the gel with grooves smaller than 500 mum - spacing would be almost 2.5 - fold higher than the gel with flat surface ( figure 2a & 2b ) .
however , decreasing spacing from 500 to 250 mum would make minimal change of oxygen concentration .
in addition , a hydrogel with grooves of 1,000 mum - spacing would display a local , limited increase of oxygen concentration around edges of microgrooves .
such simple but important role of surface topology on molecular transports into a gel matrix was not proposed in the past .
to validate the computational simulation , a hydrogel was prepared through a cross - linking reaction of alginate solution under a pdms stamp with controlled micro - patterns ( figure 3a ) .
the cross - linking reaction between carboxylate groups of alginate and adipic acid dihyrazide ( aad ) under the pdms stamp created hydrogels with pre - defined multiple , microgrooves ( figure 3b ) .
hydrogels with grooves of spacing at 1,000 and 500 mum were separately prepared , since further reduction of spacing between grooves from 500 to 250 mum would not make any increase of oxygen concentration in the gel .
as expected , this topological control of the gel surface minimally changed the bulk elastic modulus of the gel ( figure s1 ) .
effects of microgroove spacing on water transport into the hydrogel were examined by monitoring time - based diffusion of water originally placed on the gel surface using the mri ( figure 3c and s2 ) .
similar to the computational simulation of oxygen transport , microgrooved hydrogels displayed faster increases of water bound to a gel matrix than a hydrogel with flat surface as displayed with a more rapid increase of red color level ( figure 3c ) .
note that mass of water molecules bound to a gel matrix is proportional to the intensity of red color .
more interestingly , decreasing the spacing between grooves from 1,000 to 500 mum led to a saturation of the gel with red - colorated bound water within 10 minutes .
the gel with grooves of 1,000 mum - spacing displayed localized increase of bound water around microgrooves , similar to computational simulation of oxygen diffusion .
the diffusivity of water into hydrogels ( dwater ) was quantified by fitting the time - dependent increase of the number of pixels positively colorated at an intensity level higher than 50 to a first - order kinetics , as described by eq .
( 2 ). where at is the area of high water concentration at time t , dwater is the diffusivity of water , n ( t ) is the number of positively colorated pixel , and t is the time .
according to eq .
( 2 ) , decreasing spacing of grooves to 500 mum led to a 1.6 - fold increase of dwater attained with the flat hydrogel ( figure s3 and 3d ) .
this dependency of dwater on the microgroove spacing was attributed to an increase in the surface area - to - volume ratio of the gel ( figure 3d ) .
total surface area of the hydrogel with grooves of 500 mum - spacing was 1.5 times higher than that of the flat gel .
tailoring the hydrogel permeability by aligning microchannels next , microgrooved hydrogels were modified to present microchannels similar to the microvascular bundle of a plant .
in this process , a hydrogel was placed on a copper substrate cooled to sub - zero temperature .
then , multiple ice crystals grew along the direction perpendicular to the copper substrate ( figure 4a ) .
this uniaxial freezing process induced the anisotropic ice crystal growth , while excluding cross - linked polymer chains from the ice crystals .
the following lyophilization removed ice crystals , thus resulting in a cryogel with anisotropically aligned microchannels without isolated pores .
depending on the orientation between the gel and the copper substrate , microchannels were aligned either in parallel with microgrooves or perpendicular to the microgroove direction ( figure 4a ) .
the diameter of individual microchannels was 100 +/ - 15 mum , as confirmed by imaging the fractured surface of the gel with a scanning electron microscope ( figure 4b - 1 ) .
in contrast , lyophilization of hydrogels frozen in a freezing container that presented sub - zero temperature on all sides produced a cryogel that had randomly oriented micropores with poor opening and interconnectivity , termed as a microporous gel ( figure 4b - 2 ) .
in addition , we examined whether the alignment of microchannels with microgrooves of a hydrogel would affect the diffusivity of water .
when microgrooved cryogels were re - hydrated by placing water on their surfaces , the cryogel with microchannels displayed a substantial increase in the fraction of bound water ( i.e. , red colorated area ) compared with the microporous gel , as visualized with mr images ( figure 4c and s4 ) .
note that mr images were developed from relaxation rates of water molecules in a gel matrix .
the bound water is characterized by lower water relaxation rate than free water , due to a higher binding affinity of water molecules to a gel .
interestingly , the degree of increase in the fraction of bound water was more significant with the gel in which the microchannels were aligned parallel with microgrooves , termed the (//) microchanneled gel .
in contrast , the gel in which the microchannels were aligned perpendicular to microgrooves , termed the (_|_) microchanneled gel , displayed a smaller increase of the fraction of bound water than the microporous gel .
the role of microchannels in enhancing water transport during rehydration became insignificant with the cryogel without microgrooves .
additionally , water diffusion into the hydrogel was evaluated by measuring mass of the hydrogel over time while incubating the gel in aqueous media for 2 hrs .
agreed with mr images , the (//) microchanneled gel displayed the most rapid increase of the gel mass ( figure 4d ) .
the diffusivity of water ( dwater ) was calculated by fitting the increase of gel mass over time to eq .
( 3 ) where wt and winfinity are the mass of a hydrogel at time t and at equilibrium swelling , respectively , and l is the initial gel thickness .
very interestingly , dwater of the (//) microchanneled gel was 1.8 - fold higher than the microporous gel ( figure 4e ) .
in contrast , there was minimal difference of dwater between the microporous gel and the (_|_) microchanneled gel .
such enhanced water transport within the (//) microchanneled hydrogel is due to the larger number density of interconnected microchannels than the (_|_) microchanneled hydrogel , because of anisotropic growth of ice crystals in parallel with pre - defined microgrooves .
the uniaxial freezing process to prepare the (_|_) microchanneled hydrogel likely encountered the discontinued ice crystal growth in the microgrooved area of the gel , because of blocked heat transfer in the microgrooves .
additionally , it is likely that water entry into the (_|_) microchanneled gel is highly limited at the intersection of microgrooves and microchannels .
whereas the incorporation of microchannels into the hydrogel made a higher increase in the gel permeability than the microporous gel , it made much a smaller decrease of the elastic modulus of the matrix ( figure 4f ) .
note that the elastic modulus of the (_|_) microchanneled gel was only 1.4 - fold smaller than that of the original hydrogel before freeze - drying .
this smaller decrease in gel stiffness is likely due to the anisotropically extruded orientation of polymers during uniaxial freezing1516 , thus compensating effects of microchannels on decreasing stiffness of the gel .
in contrast , the elastic modulus of the microporous gel was 14 - fold lower than the original gel .
analysis of the gel capability to improve metabolic activity and neural differentiation finally , the microgrooved gels assembled above were modified with cell adhesion oligopeptides17 to test whether the controlled hydrogel permeability improves metabolic activity and neural differentiation of bone marrow - derived stem cells ( bmscs ) cultured in the gel ( figure 5a ) .
bmscs were loaded into the hydrogel by rehydrating the freeze - dried cryogel with cell suspension .
the elastic modulus of the microchanneled hydrogel used in this cell culture study was 49 +/ - 4.3 kpa , while that of the microporous gel was 8 +/ - 1.7 kpa .
according to a mtt assay used to identify positively colored metabolically active cells , bmscs cultured in the microchanneled hydrogel remained more metabolically active when grooves with 500 mum - spacing were present on the surface ( figure 5b ) .
in addition , the (//) microchanneled hydrogel was more advantageous to increasing the number of metabolically active bmscs than the (_|_) microchanneled gel .
in contrast , the microgrooves on the microporous gel surface did not make a significant contribution to elevating metabolic activity of cells .
the mtt absorbance ( at 570 nm ) of cells cultured on a 2d glass substrate was 0.286 (+/ - 0.06 ) , which is almost same as the microporous gel with microgrooves .
additionally , microgrooves and microchannels introduced into the gel orchestrated to elevate the neural differentiation level of bmscs evaluated with density of neurons , a ratio of neuron to glial cells , and calcium transport of differentiated cells .
incubation of the bmsc - laden hydrogel in the neural differentiation media activated differentiation of bmscs to neuronal cells that express microtubule - associated protein ( map2 ) .
bmscs can also differentiate to glial cells that express glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) 18192021 .
interestingly , cells cultured in the microporous hydrogel with an elastic modulus of 10 kpa formed a cluster independent of microgrooves on the gel surface , while those cultured in the microchanneled hydrogel with an elastic modulus of 50 kpa were fully stretched ( figure 5c ) .
the cellular clusters formed in the soft microporous hydrogel were morphologically similar to cells loaded into a microchanneled hydrogel with an elastic modulus of 7 kpa ( results not shown ) .
it is also noteworthy that number of cells in the gel was larger with presence of microgrooves for both microporous and microchanneled hydrogels .
more interestingly , compared with cells cultured in the microporous gel ( see second row in figure 5c - 1 ) , bmscs differentiated within the (//) microchanneled hydrogel formed a larger density of neurons and a smaller number of glial cells ( see second row in figure 5c - 2 & 5d ) .
interestingly , differentiated neuronal cells aligned to each other in the (//) microchanneled gel , while differentiated ones in the microporous gel were aggregated .
more interestingly , the glial to neuron ratio with the (//) microchanneled gel was 4 - fold smaller than the microporous gel ( figure 5e ) .
the microgrooves of the gel played an important role on the neural differentiation level and the glial - to - neuron ratio , termed g / n ratio .
for this analysis , the microchanneled hydrogel free of microgrooves was used as a control .
according to the water diffusion analysis presented in figure 4e , diffusivity of water in the control gel was two - fold smaller than the (//) microchanneled gel .
interestingly , neural density in the control gel system was almost two - fold lower than that attained with the (//) microchanneled gel .
conversely , the g / n ratio was two - fold higher with the control gel , which implicates that the (//) microchanneled gel with a higher permeability greatly supported differentiation of bmscs to neuron - like cells .
we further analyzed the action potential morphology of differentiated neuron - like cells by imaging calcium channels of the cell .
the level of calcium signals in the differentiated neuronal cells was evaluated with fluorescence arising from fluo - 4 am bound with calcium ions in living cells .
no significant difference in the level of calcium ion was detected between undifferentiated bmscs and differentiated neuronal cells , when they were cultured on a 2d substrate ( figure s5 ) .
the neuronal cells differentiated in the gel without microgrooves did not present a higher level of calcium ions , either ( see the third row in figure 5c , s6 and s7 ) .
in contrast , with the microgrooved gel , neuronal cells in the (//) microchanneled gel expressed a 2.5 - fold higher level of anisotropically aligned calcium channels than those in the microporous gel .
according to previous studies conducted by activating neural differentiation of bmscs on hydrogels with controlled stiffness , neural differentiation of bmscs is enhanced on a hydrogel with similar softness of brain tissue22 .
in contrast , our finding that neural differentiation of bmscs cultured in a gel is enhanced with the stiffer (//) microchanneled gel compared to the softer microporous gel implicates that transport property of a matrix is a more pre - dominant factor than mechanical property with the 3d cell culture .
however , controlling stiffness of the (//) microchanneled gel may allow us to tune mechanical signals of the matrix at a given permeability and attain a synergy to further elevate neural differentiation levels of bmscs. by combining mr images of the rehydrated gel with cellular metabolic and phenotypic activities , the results of this study address the beneficial role of bound water on 3d cell culture and further tissue development .
we suggest that water molecules bound to a gel matrix do not only facilitate molecular transports into a gel matrix but also support cellular adhesion to microchannels of a gel matrix .
conversely , free water molecules implicate insufficient rehydration of a gel matrix , which leads to limited molecular transports and cell adhesion .
in addition , it is noteworthy that the difference of cellular metabolic and phenotypic activities between the microporous and microchanneled hydrogel may be partially attributed to the difference of mechanical stiffness .
cellular clusters formed in the microporous gel were morphologically similar to those found in a microchanneled gel with similar softness .
therefore , to better address the underlying mechanism , it is necessary to systematically study balanced effects of matrix permeability and stiffness on cellular response in a 3d matrix in future studies .
conclusion overall , this study successfully demonstrated that bio - inspired assembly of a hydrogel to present microchannels aligned in parallel with microgrooves of optimal spacing ( i.e. , 500 mum ) allowed us to tune mass transports in the gel , without significantly softening the gel .
the perpendicular alignment between microgrooves and microchannels or the incorporation of randomly aligned micropores into the hydrogel with microgrooves did not improve water diffusion into the 3d gel matrix .
we suggest that such advanced tuning of the dependency between permeability and stiffness of the gel should be attributed to the orchestrated controls of microgrooves - induced surface area , interconnectivity of microchannels , and organized densification of polymers resulting from uniaxial freezing .
therefore , we could demonstrate the improved cellular metabolic and phenotypic activities in a stiff but permeable gel system .
we envision that such bio - inspired orchestration of surface topology and microchannel architecture of a gel would be highly useful to culturing a wide array of stem and progenitor cells for fundamental bioscience studies and cell therapies .
it would be also advantageous to improving viability and metabolic activities of yeasts and bacterial cells used in a variety of biochemical processes23 .
additionally , the material assembly principle can be readily extended to fabricating a variety of material systems used in both biological and non - biological applications .

hydrogel assembly based on simulation results , alginate hydrogels with microgrooves of controlled spacing were assembled by activating cross - linking reaction between alginate and adipic acid dihydrazide on a poly ( dimethoxysiloxane ) ( pdms ) stamp with pre - defined , positive patterns .

the repetition time ( tr ) was 500 ms and the echo time ( te ) was 9.5 ms. separately , an increase of the gel mass over time was monitored while incubating the cryogel in di water .
in parallel , the gel stiffness was evaluated by measuring a compressive elastic modulus .
cell assays after 24 hours since incorporating bmscs with a cell number of 5 x 104 into the gel , the number of metabolically active cells within the hydrogels was measured using a mtt cell proliferation assay kit ( invitrogen ) .

the uk bspar standards of care ( 2009 ) stipulate that children with jia should see a paediatric rheumatology team ( prh ) within ten weeks of symptom onset and within four weeks of referral .
it is not known how often these standards are met or whether they have impacted on outcomes .
objectives to describe trends in referral times , baseline disease severity , treatment times and one - year outcomes over a ten - year period among children with new - onset jia .
methods the childhood arthritis prospective study is a prospective inception cohort of children with new - onset inflammatory arthritis recruiting from seven uk prh centres .
this analysis included all children recruited between 2001 and 2011 with at least one year of follow - up. the cohort was divided into four groups by year of diagnosis and baseline referral times , disease pattern , disease activity indices , time to first definitive treatment and proportion achieving minimal disease activity ( mda ) ( magni - manzoni , 2008 ) were determined for each group .
values across the four groups were compared using linear and logistic regression , adjusting for prh centre and disease pattern .

the reasons for the former may be related to prh service pressures , with the latter relating to both public and physician education .
although it is encouraging to see more rapid introduction of treatment , further research is necessary to understand why approximately one - third of children have active disease at one year .
delay in access to definitive treatments may impact on outcomes .

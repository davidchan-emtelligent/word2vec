this paper presents an experimental synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) system that is under development in the universidad politecnica de madrid .
the system uses linear frequency modulated continuous wave ( lfm - cw ) radar with a two antenna configuration for transmission and reception .
the radar operates in the millimeter - wave band with a maximum transmitted bandwidth of 2 ghz .
the proposed system is being developed for unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ) operation .
motion errors in uav operation can be critical .
therefore , this paper proposes a method for focusing sar images with movement errors larger than the resolution cell .
typically , this problem is solved using two processing steps : first , coarse motion compensation based on the information provided by an inertial measuring unit ( imu ) ; and second , fine motion compensation for the residual errors within the resolution cell based on the received raw data .
the proposed technique tries to focus the image without using data of an imu .
the method is based on a combination of the well known phase gradient autofocus ( pga ) for sar imagery and typical algorithms for translational motion compensation on inverse sar ( isar ) .
this paper shows the first real experiments for obtaining high resolution sar images using a car as a mobile platform for our radar .
unmanned aerial vehicle ( uav ) synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) motion compensation range alignment phase gradient autofocus ( pga ) 1 .
introduction synthetic aperture radars ( sar ) typically provide a two - dimensional representation of the scatterers over an extensive area that has been illuminated with microwaves .
these two dimensions are called slant range and azimuth resolution .
it is known that sar systems obtain high range resolution transmitting signals with a large bandwidth .
for very high resolution sar systems , the movement errors could be large enough to shift the detected target to other range cells due to non - ideal motion .
these error corrections are critical for achieving the required quality of the final sar product .
focusing sar images with movement errors beyond the resolution cell has been addressed in the specialized literature [ 1 , 2 ] .
typically , proposed techniques are based on two - step procedures .
the first step consists of coarse motion compensation with resolution cell accuracy .
information provided by an inertial measuring unit ( imu ) is usually available for this purpose .
the second step consists of fine motion compensation based on the received raw data .
this fine correction is usually based on signal based motion compensation ( sbmc ) techniques , and their mission is to carry out a phase correction for auto - focusing the images .
currently , the miniaturization of sar systems is a very important objective because there are many applications in which the weight and size of the system are critical , for example uav operation .
our research group is developing a miniaturized system for this purpose. from the perspective of miniaturization , it is useful that the radar system operates at very high carrier frequency , that is , millimeter - wave band ( ka band , 34 ghz ) [ 3 ] .
thus , circuits and antennas are smaller and mmic technology has just been made available .
furthermore , a large bandwidth can be more easily transmitted working in the millimeter - wave band , because the relative bandwidth is lower .
the sar system described in this paper transmits to 2 ghz of bandwidth , which corresponds to range resolution of 7.5 cm [ 4 ] .
this high resolution is a problem from the point of view of motion errors , because the motion errors could be larger than the resolution cell in uav operation .
a potential solution to this problem consists of range aligning the target response for each pulse , thus removing the range shift .
this solution is only feasible for far scenes with a narrow swath , that is , with a range curvature that is very similar for all the targets in the scene .
this is not valid for nearer or wider scenes due to the range curvature .
the range curvature is different for each target because it depends on its position at the scene .
this range curvature is generated by the ideal motion of the platform .
the range migration algorithm ( rma ) is known to be able to focus sar images with high and different range curvatures within the swath of interest .
however , rma can not compensate for the range cell shift due to the non - ideal motion of the platform , which results in defocusing .
an additional technique to correct these effects is needed .
another solution is to use the motion information provided by an imu to align the target response for each pulse , removing the range shift .
however , the system might not have available data on this motion because the addition of an imu increases the weight and size of the sar system , which might not be tolerable for some uavs .
this paper describes a method for focusing sar images with movement errors larger than the resolution cell , without using an imu .
this method is based on a combination of the well known phase gradient autofocus ( pga ) for sar imagery [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] , with typical algorithms for translational motion compensation on inverse sar ( isar ) , such as envelope correlation ( ec ) [ 8 , 9 ] and global range alignment ( gra ) [ 10 ] .
the main characteristics of the proposed motion compensation method are summarized as follows : - it does not require imu or sensor movements .
- it requires prominent scatters within the swath to collect the phase error using pga .
- it does not compensate the range curvature due to the ideal trajectory of the platform .
therefore , it can be used in combination with algorithms that focus sar images with different range curvatures , e.g. , rma .
- it is valid for stripmap - mode sar operation .
this paper is arranged as follows : section two describes the different subsystems of the radar that have been developed .
specific measurements of each subsystem are presented .
section three describes the sar signal processing chain , emphasizing the motion compensation algorithm .
simulated data are presented to shown the performance of this technique for uav applications .
the last section shows two real sar images using the proposed system in a ground sar system with a car as the mobile platform .
these are the first experiments to prove the feasibility of our radar in a sar application .
2. system description nowadays , there is a great interest in using high resolution radar [ 11 ] , because targets can not only be detected , but can also be classified and identified .
to achieve high resolution , it is necessary to transmit a large bandwidth .
the range resolution is inversely proportional to the rf transmitted bandwidth .
the system works in the millimeter - wave band .
thus , a large bandwidth can be more easily transmitted because the relative bandwidth is low .
the peak power provided by commercial amplifiers in the millimeter - wave band is low .
the proposed sensor has a continuous wave ( cw ) configuration in order to increase the mean power and thus the maximum range [ 12 ] .
the radar transmits a linear frequency modulated ( lfm ) signal .
lfm systems obtain range information from beat frequencies .
the receiver has a homodyne structure that implements a matched receiver based on correlations .
lfm - cw signal facilitates system miniaturization and requires low power operation , which makes it possible to install the system in an uav .
2.1 .
general scheme figure 1 illustrates the block diagram , while figure 2 presents several pictures of the system .
the rf sensor dimensions are 24x16x9 cm , and its weight is 2.5 kg. the received signals are down - converted to base - band mixing the echoes from the targets with a coupled sample of the transmitted signal ( homodyne architecture ) .
the isolation between the transmitter and receiver is achieved using two separate antennas for transmission and reception , which are standard rectangular horns with a beamwidth of 6degrees and 8degrees , and a gain of 24 db ( figure 2a ) .
the signal generation is obtained with a closed - loop scheme .
a phase locked loop ( pll ) generates the tuning signal to a voltage controlled oscillator ( vco ) using as a reference a strictly linear frequency ramp obtained thanks to a direct digital synthesizer ( dds ) , which is controlled by a personal computer ( pc ) .
this pc also has an acquisition board to sample the beating frequencies , and to store them .
the sar signal processing is carried out by this pc ( figure 2b ) .
the most important operation characteristics are summarized in table 1 : central frequency , fc , 34 ghz ( lambda = 8.8 mm ) , and the maximum transmitted bandwidth ( brf ) , 2 ghz .
the system transmits a continuous train of linear frequency ramps with a maximum pulse repetition frequency ( prf ) of 5 khz .
to avoid aliasing in the doppler spectrum the maximum azimuthal sampling interval is determined to be 2.1 cm .
2.2 .
signal generation subsystem the signal generation subsystem consists of a pll that compares the output signal of the vco with a strictly linear frequency modulated signal generated by a dds .
the vco frequency , around 8 ghz , is divided with a n1 divider ( n1 = 80 ) to compare it in the pll .
the lfm - cw linear ramp of the vco is multiplied with a n2 multiplier factor ( n2 = 4 ) to obtain the desired transmitting millimeter - wave signal .
figure 3 shows the measurement of a 1.6 ghz bandwidth and 34 ghz carrier frequency signal , which was measured with a 4 db loss cable .
in this case , the lfm generated with the dds has a central frequency of 106.25 mhz and a bandwidth of 5 mhz .
2.3 .
transmitter subsystem the transmitter ( tx ) block is composed of a medium power amplifier ( mpa ) , a high power amplifier ( hpa ) and a 30 db coupler .
the measured gain of the block was around 30 db , and the 1 db compression point , p1db , is 31 dbm .
2.4 .
receiver subsystem the coupled sample of the tx block , using the 30 db coupler , was amplified with a mpa and used as the local oscillator ( lo ) signal in the receiver .
the rf echoes were amplified with a low noise amplifier ( lna ) before mixing them with the lo. the base - band signal was amplified 20 db before filtering it. the noise figure of the receiver is 5.2 db .
2.5 .
if subsystem and acquisition subsystem the intermediate frequency ( if ) block consists of an amplifier and a band - pass if filter .
this filter must be designed for a concrete application and is used to reduce the if bandwidth to be sampled , and to improve the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .
there are several ways to tune the range interval to be acquired .
in other works [ 13 ] , a heterodyne receiver with fixed if frequency and a variable mixer was used .
in our sensor , a fixed central frequency if filter and a variable prf were used to tune the different range limits .
the technique is explained in detail in [ 3 , 4 ] but a short summary is given here .
the received signal from a target is demodulated with a coupled version of the transmitted signal to produce a beat signal , with frequency fb : ( 1 ) fb = 2rcgamma =~ 2rc ~ brf.prf the beat frequency is directly proportional to the target range r. a fixed if bandwidth fl < | f | < fh allows collecting data from a range interval rmin < r < rmax : ( 2 ) rmin = c2brf.prffl,rmax = c2brf.prffh the system can be tuned to different range intervals varying the prf with the advantage of using a same if filter .
also , the system can make a band - pass sampling .
the band - pass theorem [ 14 ] states that a band - pass signal that has a nonzero spectrum only over the frequency interval fl < | f | < fh can be reproduced from sampled values if the sampling frequency fs satisfies the relationships : ( 3 ) 2fhn <= fs <= 2fl ( n - 1 ) , 2 <= n <= fhfh - flwithninz the sampling rate reduction allows use of a cheaper analogue to digital converter ( adc ) , and reduces the memory and cpu requirements .
3. lfm - cw sar signal processing chain the radar receives a delayed echo of the transmitted signal , equation ( 4 ) , for each scatter in the scene .
this signal is given by equation ( 5 ) , where ns is the number of scatters in the scene , and r ( k,t ) the range to the scatter kth .
this range has two components : the range ri ( k,t ) due to the ideal trajectory of the platform and the range rerr ( k,t ) due to the movement errors of the platform .
( 4 ) stx ( t ^ , t )= rect ( tpri ) exp [ j ( omegact + pigammat2 )] where c is the speed of light , omegac is the carrier pulsation , pri = 1 / prf , gamma =~ brf / pri , t is the fast time and t is the slow time .
( 5 ) srx ( t ^ , t )= sumk = 1nsa ( k,t ^). rect ( t - tr ( k,t ^) pri ) exp [ j ( omegac ( t - tr ( k,t ^))+ pigamma ( t - tr ( k,t ^)) 2 )] where tr ( k,t ^)= 2r ( k,t ^) c = 2 ( ri ( k,t ^)+ rerr ( k,t ^)) c , and a ( k,t ) is the backscattering coefficient of the kth scatter .
the received signal , equation ( 5 ) , is demodulated with the complex conjugate of the transmitted signal , equation ( 4 ) .
the result of this operation is the signal given by equation ( 6 ) , which is band - pass filtered and sampled , resulting the digital signal shown in equation ( 7 ) .
( 6 ) sd ( t ^ , t )= sumk = 1nsa ( k,t ^). rect ( t - tr ( k,t ^) pri ) exp [ - j ( omegactr ( k,t ^)+ 2pigammatr ( k,t ^) t - pigammatr2 ( k,t ^))] ( 7 ) ss ( m,n )= sumk = 1nsa ( k,m ). rect ( nts1 - tr ( k,m ) pri ) xexp [ - j ( omegactr ( k,m )+ 2pigammatr ( k,m ) nts1 - pigammatr2 ( k,m ))] where the fast time is sampled with a sampling period ts1 , ( t = nts1 ) , and the slow time is sampled at prf rate , ( t = m . pri ) , and m and n are integer indexes with values m = 0 ,... , m - 1 and n = 0 ,... , n - 1 .
after sampling , the signal given by equation ( 7 ) was demodulated with a digital reference signal , equation ( 8 ) , and low - pass filtered .
this reference signal is the echo that would have been received from a target at the centre range of the swath ( range r0 ) .
( 8 ) sref ( m,n )= exp ( j ( 2pigammat0nts1 + omegact0 - pigammat02 )) , wheret0 = 2r0c this operation has two consequences .
first , the band - pass signal is converted to a low - pass signal .
second , the reference signal makes motion compensation to a line , which is necessary to use rma as the image formation process ( ifp ) [ 7 , 15 ] .
at this point , the signal is a low - pass signal that can be resampled to fulfill the nyquist sampling rate .
this resampling , with a period ts2 , reduces the number of samples and therefore the computational burden .
the resampled signal , equation ( 9 ) , still has three error terms : a phase error phierr ( m ) , a frequency shift ( equivalent to a range shift ) and the known residual video phase ( rvp ) [ 7 ] .
( 9 ) sresam ( m,n )= sumk = 1nsa ( k,m ). rect ( nts2 - tr ( k,m ) pri ) xxexp [ - j ( 4pigammac ( fcgamma + nts2 - t0 )( ri ( k,m ) - r0 )+ 4pigammac2 ( r ( k,m ) - r0 ) 2 } rvp ++ 4pigammac ( fcgamma - t0 ) rerr ( k,m )} phierr ( m )+ 4pigammacrerr ( k,m ). nts2 } rangeshift +)] the phase error phierr ( m ) and the range shift were estimated and corrected using an autofocus technique .
pga , which has been extended to stripmap mode , is the chosen algorithm to estimate and correct the motion errors .
the implemented algorithm is explained in the next section .
the rvp term can be removed by means of the technique known as range deskew [ 7 ] .
after these corrections , the signal given by equation ( 10 ) is obtained .
this is the signal desired by rma to obtain a perfectly focused sar image [ 7 ] .
( 10 ) scorr ( m,n )= sumk = 1nsa ( k,m ). rect ( nts2 - t0pri ) exp ( - j ( 4pigammac ( fcgamma + nts2 - t0 )( ri ( k,m ) - r0 ))) 4 .
motion error compensation 4.1 .
phase gradient autofocus ( pga ) this subsection only shows an overview of the pga algorithm .
the detailed description can be found in [ 5 , 6 , 7 ] .
pga is able to estimate and remove arbitrary phase errors in sar images .
the right operation of spotlight pga is based on three hypotheses : - the phase error must be spatially invariant over the entire image , that is , all the scatters in a scene must share the same phase error history .
- targets must exist with phase error information over the entire data set .
- the raw data signal must be related to the sar image by means of a two - dimensional fourier transform .
this condition is always fulfilled in spotlight sar , because the data are usually motion compensated to a point .
however , our radar is going to operate at stripmap - mode to maximize the coverage of the scene .
the next four points summarize spotlight pga : circular shifting : the input to pga is the complex sar image .
the first step is to choose the strongest target for each range bin and circularly shift it to the azimuthal origin .
this shift removes the doppler frequency offset of these scatters .
therefore , pga can not estimate linear phase errors in the doppler history .
windowing : each selected scatter is windowed azimuthally .
windowing isolates the phase error information contained at the dominant scatter from other scatters at the same range bin that could interfere with the phase error estimation .
phase gradient estimation : the circular shifted and windowed data are inversely fourier transformed along azimuth to the range - compressed domain .
let us denote s ( m,n ) as the signal associated with the windowed target from the nth range bin , i.e. , the windowed and shifted fourier transform across the columns of s ( m,n ) : ( 11 ) s ( m,n )=| s ( m,n )| exp ( j [ phierr ( m )+ theta ( m,n )]) where phierr ( m ) is the phase error ( spatially invariant ) and theta ( m,n ) is the scatter - dependent phase function for the chosen target in the nth range bin .
the linear unbiased minimum variance estimate of the gradient phase error is given by : ( 12 ) < phierr '( m )> lumv = sumnim { s *( m,n ) s '( m,n )} sumn | s ( m,n )| 2where s '( m,n ) is the first derivative along columns of s ( m,n ) .
there are other phase gradient estimators that produce good results in combination with circular shifting and windowing [ 5 , 7 , 16 ] .
iterative phase correction : the estimated phase gradient has to be integrated to obtain the phase error .
any constant or linear term of the phase error is removed .
after the integration , the phase error is corrected multiplying the range - compressed data with a complex exponential function whose phase is the inverse of the phase error estimate .
then the corrected data are fourier transformed to the image domain , leading to a more focused image .
all the described steps are iteratively repeated until some convergence criterion is reached [ 5 , 7 ] .
basic spotlight pga is based on the three fundamental hypotheses that have been explained above .
the proposed sar signal processing chain implements a stripmap - mode with motion compensation to a line .
the first difference is referred to the azimuthal resolution limit and the scene coverage .
in stripmap - mode , the antenna beamwidth limits the azimuthal resolution , and data collection length determines azimuthal scene size .
however , in spotlight - mode , data collection length determines azimuthal resolution and antenna beamwidth limits the azimuthal scene size .
both modes usually use the same transmitted signal and a dechirp - on receive procedure [ 7 ] .
however , the second difference is the reference signal used for dechirping .
stripmap - mode uses compensation to a line that preserves the azimuthal chirp , while spotlight - mode uses motion compensation to a point that removes this azimuthal chirp [ 7 ] .
the proposed stripmap pga implements different strategies to fulfill these pga hypotheses .
the implemented algorithm is described in the next subsections .
the movement error that has been estimated by pga is used in a two step correction method : a coarse correction that removes the range shift , and a fine correction that focuses the target within the resolution cell .
4.2 .
stripmap to spotlight conversion spotlight pga needs a raw signal data that can be compressed by means of a two dimensional fourier transform to form a sar image .
however , stripmap data preserve the azimuthal chirp and a linear range migration , that is , a single scatter is detected at different range bins for each pulse of the data set .
these stripmap characteristics do not allow compression of the image using a two - dimensional fourier transform .
to solve this problem , the proposed algorithm converts stripmap data to spotlight data .
the conversion consists of a change of the reference signal .
stripmap data have been motion compensated with a fixed reference range r0 , while spotlight data were motion compensated with a different reference range rc ( m ) for each pulse .
the stripmap to spotlight conversion removes the stripmap motion compensation and applies motion compensation to the scene center .
this is equivalent to multiply each pulse with a complex exponential given by equation .
( 13 ) : ( 13 ) sst2sp ( m,n )= exp [ j ( 4pilambda ( r0 - rc ( m ))+ 4pigammac ( r0 - rc ( m )). n.ts2 + 4pigammac2 ( rc2 ( m ) - r02 ))] where lambda is the wavelength .
this conversion removes the azimuthal chirp without modifying the phase error that must be estimated [ 7 ] .
pga needs targets with phase error information over the entire data collection range .
in spotlight - mode , the phase history of any point covers the entire data set .
however , in stripmap - mode the phase history of any scatter is limited by the antenna beamwidth and is contained only in a portion of the data set .
a solution was proposed in [ 17 ] .
it consists of dividing the complete data collection into azimuthal data segments .
our proposed pga uses this philosophy and independently converts each segment from stripmap to spotlight mode .
furthermore , this minimizes range migration even in the case of squinted stripmap data .
both spotlight and stripmap data with dechirp - on receive have a rvp term .
in both modes , rvp can be removed using the range deskew filter given by equation ( 14 ) [ 7 ] .
( 14 ) hrd ( f )= exp ( - jpigammaf2 ) 4.3 .
range alignment previous to the phase estimation for each azimuthal data segment , some prominent scatters must be selected to estimate the phase error due to the non - ideal movement .
this selection can be done in the range compressed domain .
several methods to choose prominent scatters in the range compressed domain have been proposed in the specialized literature about isar [ 19 , 20 ] .
for our purpose , the most appropriate algorithm is based on the minimal normalized variance criteria .
it computes the normalized variance for each range bin ( column of the range compressed map ) .
the range bin n with the minimal normalized variance is chosen .
the formulation is given by equation ( 15 ) : ( 15 ) n ^= argnmin [ v ( n )] withv ( n )= summ = 0m - 1 [| s ( m,n )| - s ( n )] 2summ = 0m - 1 | s ( m,n )| 2ands ( n )= 1msumm = 0m - 1 | s ( m,n )| where s ( m,n ) is the range compressed map , with m azimuthal cells ( rows ) , and n range bins ( columns ) .
in this way , we achieve selected targets that are located in an azimuthal coordinate quite centered respect to the middle of the azimuthal data segment .
taking short enough azimuthal data segments , we can avoid the linear range migration due to the ideal motion of the platform .
it means that a selected target has remained in the same range cell for the major part of the azimuthal data segment and , therefore , this range column is the most appropriate to extract the movement error .
unfortunately , the range migration cell due to non - ideal motion is still present in the range compressed domain .
the selected range column could be processed by the typical pga to extract the movement error .
however , the range column does not have information in zones where the movement error was larger than the range resolution , because the target has suffered a range shift .
one way to overcome this drawback is range aligning the history of the target in the range compressed domain .
there are several isar techniques that make this correction .
also , we have to take into account that this range alignment is usually the first step for motion compensation in isar .
for example , ec [ 8 , 9 ] or gra [ 10 ] are robust techniques for aligning the history of a target in the same range column in presence of noise and clutter .
to avoid the interference of other targets in the range compressed domain , we can compress the image azimuthally via a fourier transform and isolate the selected prominent scatter in the image domain using a window .
this technique is used in isar processing [ 21 ] .
the complete procedure is illustrated in figure 4 .
after the range alignment , the column can be processed by the basic pga to estimate the phase error due to non - ideal motion .
4.4 .
phase gradient estimation only the scatters that are illuminated during all the acquisition time have complete phase error information .
the geometry of stripmap - mode does not allow collection of data from the same scatter all the time .
returns from a target are only received for a limited number of pulses .
the number of received pulses is determined by the antenna beamwidth .
this is a drawback , because pga needs targets with phase error information over the entire data set .
the solution proposed in [ 17 ] consists of dividing the data set into shorter azimuthal data segments .
after this division , each azimuthal data segment is independently converted from stripmap to spotlight - mode in the manner described above .
each segment is range compressed via a fourier transform .
for each segment , several columns containing prominent targets are selected using minimal normalized variance .
the history of these targets is range aligned as previously explained .
then , basic spotlight pga is independently applied to each column to obtain a phase error estimate .
final phase error of the segment will be an average of these independent estimations .
it is known that pga can not estimate linear phase errors .
thus , the phase error estimation of each segment could exhibit a different linear component .
to avoid discontinuities in the phase error estimation between consecutive segments , in [ 17 ] it is proposed to remove the mean of the phase gradient before combining and integrating the phase error segments .
however , this procedure leads to large errors because the segments are small , and the linear component of the actual phase error is , in fact , different from zero and also different from one segment to another .
an estimate of the second derivative of the phase error has the advantage of forcing the mathematical continuity between consecutive segment estimations .
the second derivative estimate of the phase error from all the segments is integrated together yielding the phase error gradient without any discontinuity over the complete data set .
the mean of the whole phase gradient was then removed before integrating again to get the complete phase error .
the first hypothesis of pga is that the phase error must be spatially invariant over the entire image , i.e. all the scatters in a scene must share the same phase error .
traditional pga algorithm assumes that the phase error is constant with range .
however , with wide swaths or short ranges , the incidence angle is highly varied and the phase error due to the movement exhibits range dependence .
two alternatives have been proposed : the first one consists of dividing the data set into narrow range subswaths .
the subswath width has to be chosen to guarantee high correlation of the phase error within the subswath .
the division is carried out with the range compressed data , after azimuthal segmentation and stripmap to spotlight conversion .
the previously described pga procedure is independently applied to each subswath .
the selected targets of one subswath will have very similar phase errors , and the pga correction will be appropriate to all the targets within the subswath .
the second alternative is to estimate the range dependence of the error to correlate different subswaths .
this method is based on the phase weighted estimation pga ( pwe - pga ) described in [ 18 ] .
this method improves the performance of pga , but increases its computational complexity .
4.5 .
coarse movement correction once the phase error due to non - ideal motion has been estimated , the movement error can be extracted using the phase information .
usually t0 is negligible in comparison with fc / gamma and , therefore , rerr ( m ) can be approximated by : ( 16 ) rerr ( m )=~ - lambda4piphierr ( m ) where phierr ( m ) is the estimated phase error and rerr ( m ) is the estimated motion error on the slant plane .
this estimate is valid to correct the range shifts due to the movement errors .
the range shift can be removed using the original stripmap raw data .
the procedure consists of shifting each received pulse the quantity given by rerr ( m ) .
the shift can be performed by multiplying each mth pulse of the raw matrix s ( m,n ) with a complex exponential given by ( 17 ) .
( 17 ) gcoarse ( m,n )= exp ( j.4pigammacrerr ( m ). nts2 ) after this correction , the movement errors that are larger than the resolution cell have been compensated , i.e. the range shift due to non - ideal motion has been removed .
however , the range curvature due to ideal motion that is different for each scatter still remains .
this range curvature will be compensated using rma [ 7 , 15 ] .
the range error estimated by ( 16 ) is extracted from the phase information .
this range information is only valid if the estimated phase error can be unwrapped , i.e. if the phase difference between two consecutive pulses is lower than pi radians : ( 18 ) 4pilambda | rerr ( m ) - rerr ( m - 1 )|< pi equation ( 18 ) imposes a limit for the maximum instantaneous radial velocity error ( projected over slant plane velocity ) that can be corrected .
using equation ( 19 ) , for our system the instantaneous maximum radial velocity error will be 11 m / s , which is a high value .
( 19 ) | vslant |< lambda4prf 4.6 .
fine movement correction the coarse correction removes the range shift , but a fine correction is still necessary , i.e. the typical phase correction of pga .
once the phase error component has been estimated and the range shift removed , the corrected stripmap data set can be fourier transformed to the range domain , and the phase error estimation can be removed for each range bin .
let s ( m,n ) be the range compressed data of s ( m,n ) .
the correction consists of multiplying each column ( range bin ) of the matrix s ( m,n ) with a complex exponential given by equation ( 20 ) : ( 20 ) gfine ( m )= exp ( j.phierr ( m )) finally , the range compressed data are inversely fourier transformed again to the time domain .
this data matrix contains the stripmap signal in the format required by rma , without motion error and without rvp .
4.7 .
movement error analysis let there be a trajectory error with z and y direction components , see figure 5 .
these movements , y ( m ) and z ( m ) , induce a phase error and a range shift on the slant plane that depends on the range to the targets yk. the proposed algorithm can correct range dependencies due to non - planar movement of the platform .
the phase error can be written as : ( 21 ) phierr,k ( m )= - 4pilambda [ y ( m ). sinthetak - z ( m ). costhetak ]= phiy ( m ). sinthetak + phiz ( m ). costhetak for a target located in the center of the kth range bin the incidence angle thetak is : ( 22 ) thetak = cos - 1 ( hrmin + k.deltar ) where deltar is the range resolution of the image the phiy ( m ) and phiz ( m ) phase error components do not depend on thetak and , therefore , they are the same for all the range bins .
this is exploited by pwe - pga , described in [ 18 ] .
therefore , this non - ideal motion can be compensated by the proposed autofocus algorithm described above .
variations in along - track speed result in non - uniform spacing of the radar pulses .
this non - uniform sampling of the doppler spectrum results in erroneous calculations of the doppler phase history .
traditionally , the data are interpolated in the azimuthal direction to correct the velocity variations across the synthetic aperture [ 2 ] .
this interpolation is based on the measured data of an imu .
our system does not have an available imu , therefore , this kind of error can not be compensated .
however , our autofocus is able to correct constant deviations respect to the nominal velocity , that is , the mean velocity error .
a constant deviation of the speed generates a phase error that produces defocus and distortion in the image .
an analytic study of this phase error can be obtained with a simple geometrical development .
suppose a target located on the ground in a position with coordinates ( xp , yp ) .
the phase of the received signal for each pulse is directly proportional to the distance between the platform and the target rp ( t ) : ( 23 ) phi ( t ^)= - 4pilambda.rp ( t ^) where t is the slow time and lambda is the wavelength of the transmitted signal .
the range between the platform and the target varies for each pulse if the platform moves at different speed from the nominal one .
suppose a nominal velocity of the platform , va , this range is given by : ( 24 ) rp ( t ^)= rp2 +( xp - va.t ^) 2where rp = h2 + yp2 is the distance between platform and target projected over the y - z plane .
supposing xp and va . t < rp , equation ( 24 ) can be approximated by : ( 25 ) rp ( t ^)= rp +( xp - va.t ^) 22.rp now , suppose that the platform moves with a constant deviation velocity , deltava , over the nominal speed va. the new range between the platform and the target , rbias ( t ) , is given by : ( 26 ) rbias ( t ^)= rp2 +( xp - ( va + deltava ). t ^) 2 supposing xp and ( va + deltava ). t << rp , equation ( 26 ) can be approximated by : ( 27 ) rbias ( t ^)= rp +( xp - ( va + deltava ). t ^) 22.rp using equation ( 23 ) that relates range with phase , the phase error due to a non - zero mean velocity error is given by : ( 28 ) phierr ( t ^)= - 4pilambda. ( rbias ( t ^) - rp ( t ^)) developing : ( 29 ) phierr ( t ^)= - 2pilambda.deltava. ( deltava + 2.va ) rp.t ^ 2 + 4pilambda.xp.deltavarp.t ^ the phase error consists of two different components .
the first term is a quadratic error .
this error produces a loss of resolution .
the second term is a linear error which produces an azimuthal shift of the image .
the quadratic error depends on the projected distance over the y - z plane , rp. therefore , this error is different for each range bin , because it depends on the position of the target in z and y. however , this kind of error can be compensated by the autofocus , because it perfectly matches with the error model of the method pwe - pga described in [ 18 ] .
the linear phase error cannot be corrected .
it is space variant because depends on the projected distance over the y - z plane , rp , and the azimuthal coordinate of the target xp. therefore , this error distorts the image .
the permitted distortion gives the maximum allowed velocity deviation , deltava .

simulated results the algorithm was tested with simulated stripmap - mode data .
the simulated system has the same parameters as our real lfm - cw sar system .
the nominal resolution cell chosen for this experiment is 15 cm ( 24 cm with windowing ) .
the simulation evaluated the degradation of the impulse response of the sar system .
the measured parameters were azimuth and slant range resolution at - 3 db and - 9 db respect to the main lobe level , and azimuth and slant range pslr ( peak side - lobe ratio ) with respect to the main lobe level .
the simulated scene consists of several corner reflectors uniformly distributed in a swath of 45x80 m. the swath is 2500 m away from the radar .
the movement error consists of random shifts in the y - z plane , see figure 5 .
the combination of these errors generated a range shift in the slant plane larger than the range resolution .
this motion error is shown in figure 6g .
also , the estimated motion error by the autofocus is shown in figure 6g .
our algorithm appears to have good accuracy .
the residual error is linear and can not be compensated by the autofocus .
however , it is not important because these errors do not result in image defocusing [ 7 ] .
figure 6a shows the sar image and figure 6b shows the detail of the system impulse response without applying any autofocus technique .
the image is completely defocused .
figure 6c illustrates a more focused sar image .
this is the result of applying the autofocus only with fine correction , without coarse correction .
the detail of the system impulse response can be seen in figure 6d .
figure 6e and 6f respectively show the sar image and the detailed system impulse response applying the complete autofocus .
thanks to the novel coarse compensation we can appreciate a resolution improvement of 7 % in slant range , and 11 % in azimuth .
also a slight increment of the pslr is achieved .
table 2 gives the exact measured values .
5. real data using a ground mobile platform the lfm - cw radar has been installed in a car that has been used as mobile platform , see figure 7 .
two real experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of our radar as sensor of a sar system .
the nominal square resolution cell is 30 cm. the first experiment consists of obtaining a high resolution sar image of a zone with man - made objects and vegetation .
figure 8 illustrates the sar image that has been achieved and an optical image to compare .
most of the objects can be detected thanks to the high resolution .
we can observe that many shadowing effects are presented because the system was being operating at ground level .
furthermore , the noise level was high , but it is interesting to remark that the incidence angle was near to 90 degrees , that is , the waves were almost tangent to the terrain surface .
therefore , the backscattering from the scene was very low .
these two effects will not appear in uav or airborne operations .
furthermore , this image has been processed without motion compensation because the movement errors were negligible .
the second experiment consisted of illuminating a rustic scene with the radar .
previously , one corner reflector was placed in the zone to measure the real impulse response of the system .
this target was labeled c in figure 9a that shows an optical image of the zone .
the point spread function ( psf ) of the system can be estimated by measuring the impulse response of the system to this reflector .
figure 9a shows the optical image .
figure 9b illustrates the movement error estimated by the proposed algorithm .
figure 9c shows the sar image of the scene without motion compensation .
also , a detail of the measured psf without motion compensation is shown in figure 9d .
figure 9e shows the sar image of the scene with our motion compensation .
the detail of the measured psf with motion compensation is shown in figure 9f .
after motion compensation , the estimated psf shows that the system has a square resolution cell around the nominal ( 30 cm ) , and a pslr larger than 20 db. these two experiments have proved the feasibility and the right performance of the complete system , hardware and software , to use our miniaturized radar as a sar sensor in uav applications .
4. conclusions a millimeter - wave lfm - cw radar has been described .
some measurements of the subsystems have been presented .
this sensor is modular , compact and lightweight , so it is very attractive for use in portable applications like uav operation .
the radar has a cw configuration to provide enough power to operate at medium range .
it works in millimeter - wave band , so a large rf bandwidth is transmitted and a high range resolution is achieved .
this work is the first step towards proving the feasibility of our millimeter - wave lfm - cw radar as a sar sensor .
the sensor has been integrated in a ground sar system using a car as mobile platform .
ground sar systems have more shadowing effects , worse snr and smaller coverage than airborne systems .
however , two high resolution ground sar images have been presented to demonstrate the performance of the system and the feasibility for uav applications .
furthermore , an autofocus algorithm has been developed to correct movement errors larger than the resolution cell for uav applications .
the paper describes the algorithm and shows the obtained results .
this work has been supported by the project tec2005 - 07010 - c02 of the spanish national board of scientific and technology research .
the optical images have been extracted from the spanish ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino 's farming land geographical information system ( sigpac ) .

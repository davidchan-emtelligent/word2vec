background previous reports have suggested that malignant transformations originate from adult stem cells , and may thus express the stem - cell - associated markers .
the purpose of this study is to investigate the differential expression and clinical significance of seven stem - cell - associated markers ( bmi1 , cd133 , cd44 , sox2 , nanog , oct4 and msi2 ) in lung cancer , providing new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer .
methods in this study , we evaluated the differential expression of mrna levels seven stem - cell - associated markers by semi - quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) from 112 human lung cancer and 18 non - cancer tissues obtained by bronchoscopy .
we further verified the differential expression of these markers by immunohistochemistry in 50 lung cancer specimens , 30 benign inflammatory lesion tissues and 20 non - tumor adjacent lung tissues .
results with the exception of oct4 , other markers bmi1 , cd133 , cd44 , sox2 , nanog and msi2 mrna and protein were abundantly expressed in lung cancer .
additionally , nanog expression was highly upregulated in lung cancer tissues and rarely presented in non - cancerous lung tissues , the sensitivity and specificity of nanog mrna reached 63.4 % and 66.7 % , respectively .
nanog therefore possessed high diagnostic value , however , cd44 , bmi1 and cd133 showed poor diagnostic value in lung cancer .
conclusion nanog may serve as a promising diagnostic marker of lung cancer and potential therapeutic target in lung cancer .
stem - cell - associated marker lung cancer therapeutic target diagnostic marker background lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer - related mortality in the world , and the incidence rates are increasing in many countries [ 1 ] .
although the prognosis is improving , the 5 - year overall survival rate of lung cancer patients is still only approximately 16 % [ 2 ] .
in order to improve survival outcome , it is important to detect and surgically remove lung cancer at an early stage .
currently , the cancer stem cell ( csc ) theory proposes that tumors contain a small subpopulation of csc , which is responsible for tumor growth , invasion and metastasis [ 3 ] .
csc and normal tissue stem cells share important characteristics : self - renewal , multipotency and unlimited proliferation , and potentially overlapping molecular mechanisms [ 4,5 ] .
in human adult tissues and tumors , several hundred stem - cell - associated markers have been identified .
in lung cancer , the common stem - cell - associated markers include bmi1 , cd133 , cd44 , sox2 , oct4 and so on [ 6,7 ] .
emerging evidences showed that these stem - cell - associated markers correlate with tumorigenesis , progression and metastasis , and may be as potential diagnostic markers for various human tumors [ 8 - 15 ] .
bmi1 is an oncogenic member of the polycomb group proteins involved in the self - renewal and differentiation of stem cells .
the expression of bmi1 mrna has been shown to be a good marker to support the diagnosis of breast cancers in surgically resected specimens [ 8 ] .
likewise , cd133 , a transmembrane glycoprotein which was first recognized in human hematopoietic stem cells , is considered the most representative marker to isolate csc from lung cancer [ 9 ] .
recently , moreira et al .
[ 10 ] found cd133 is expressed in 58 % of small cell lung cancers and 19 % of lung adenocarcinomas , but not in normal lung tissue , suggesting that cd133 could be used as a potential diagnostic marker in lung cancer .
another surface marker , cd44 , has also been used to isolate csc from lung cancer [ 11 ] .
a previous study using competitive rt - pcr to detect the expression of cd44 in urine for bladder cancer diagnosis was highly accurate and a potential non - invasive diagnostic marker for bladder cancer [ 12 ] .
transcription factors , sox2 , oct4 and nanog form a core regulatory network of self - renewal and differentiation in embryonic stem cells , which are essential in sustaining stem cell pluripotency [ 13 ] .
recent reports show that sox2 , oct4 and nanog are potential diagnostic markers for lung cancer [ 14 - 16 ] .
additionally , musashi2 ( msi2 ) , a rna binding protein , play crucial roles in maintaining self - renewal and pluriopentency of embryonic stem cells .
it have been demonstrated to participate in tumorigenesis and progression of multiple solid tumors [ 17,18 ] , and are expressed in lung cancer [ 10 ] .
however , these studies which are mainly based on surgical specimens to screen for new molecular markers have certain limitations in clinical application because most lung cancers are unresectable .
bronchoscopy has become an essential method by which to analyze and diagnose lung cancer through technological advances and its widespread application .
common bronchoscopy techniques including forceps biopsy , brushing and washing can easily obtained adequate specimens for histological , cytological and molecular biological analysis [ 19 ] .
the purpose of this study is to investigate the differential and clinical significance of these stem - cell - associated markers in bronchoscopy biopsy specimens .
in this study , we applied rt - pcr to examine the differential expression of bmi1 , cd133 , cd44 , sox2 , nanog , oct4 and msi2 mrna in bronchoscopic biopsy specimens from lung cancer and non - cancer patients .
furthermore immunohistochemistry was used to define the localization and expression patterns of these stem - cell - associated proteins in surgically resected lung cancer and non - malignant lung tissues .
the diagnostic value of these seven stem - cell - associated markers was evaluated in lung cancer .
materials and methods clinical samples from bronchoscope biopsy this prospective study in 112 patients with histologically proven lung cancer and 18 non - cancer patients was performed at guilin medical university hospital and affiliated nan xi shan hospital in china from january , 2011 to january , 2012 .
these 112 lung cancer patients included 94 males and 18 females ranging from 29 to 80 years of age ( median = 59.2 ) .
fifty - six cases were squamous cell carcinomas ( scc ) , 17 cases adenocarcinomas ( ad ) , 28 cases small cell lung carcinomas ( sclc ) and 11 cases of other types of lung cancer .
based on clinical and radiological findings , 100 cases had been evaluated for stages : 7 cases of stage i , 6 cases of stage ii , 60 cases of stage iii and 27 cases of stage iv of lung cancer .
among 18 cases of non - cancer , 7 cases were bronchitis , 7 cases tuberculosis , 3 cases pneumonia and 1 case brochiectasis .
all patients had not received any anti - cancer therapy before receiving bronchoscopy .
at least 5 biopsy specimens were obtained from one patient .
one to two specimens were snap frozen and stored at - 80degreesc for rt - pcr analysis under the condition of specimens were sufficient for routine diagnosis .
the remaining specimens were fixed in buffered formalin for histopathological evaluation .
this study was approved by the guilin medical university review board , and informed consent was obtained from all patients under the protocols prescribed by the guilin university ethics committee .
semi - quantitative rt - pcr total rna was isolated from the biopsy tissue using trizol reagent ( takara bio inc , dalian , china ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
one mug of the mrna was reverse transcribed to cdna using primescript ii 1st strand cdna synthesis kit ( takara ) .
one mul of the cdna was used in pcr for the amplification of beta - actin and seven stem - cell - associated markers .
the primers are presented in table 1 .
the dna thermal cycler conditions used were 94degreesc for 5 min ( pre - denature ) , and 35 cycles of 94degreesc for 1 min , annealing for 30 s and extension at 72degreesc for 45 s , followed by a final extension of 72degreesc for 2 min .
six mul of each pcr - amplified product were separated on a 2 % agarose gel , which was then visualized by ethidium bromide staining using a js - 780 gel image analysis system ( peiqing sci tech , ltd , shanghai , china ) .
the ratio of integrated density of target genes over corresponding beta - actin was normalized as relative mrna expression levels of stem - cell - associated markers .

the lung cancer samples consisted of 17 adenocarcinomas ( ad ) , 3 bronchioloalveolar carcinomas ( bac ) , 23 squamous cell carcinomas ( scc ) and 7 small cell lung carcinomas ( sclc ) .
thirty cases of benign inflammatory lesion samples included 12 cases of tuberculosis , 6 cases of pneumonia , 6 cases of inflammatory pseudotumor , 3 cases of brochiectasis , 2 cases of lung abscess and 1 case of benign fibroma of lung .
in 50 non - cancer lung tissues 3 cases were squamous metaplasia including 2 cases of non - tumor adjacent lung tissues and 1 case of pneumonia .
in all patients bronchoscopy and surgery were performed at guilin medical university hospital from january , 2002 to december , 2011 .
none of the subjects received radiation therapy or chemotherapy before surgery .
surgical specimens were fixed in 10 % formaldehyde , and paraffin - embedded .
after deparaffinization and rehydration , the 4 mum sections underwent antigen retrieval by boiling in 10 mm citrate buffer ( ph 6.0 ) or edta ( ph 8.0 ) .
the sections were immersed in h2o2 for 10 min and washed with pbs three times .
then the sections were incubated for 1 hr with the primary antibodies ( table 1 ) at 37degreesc .
after a brief wash , the sections were incubated for 20 min with polymer helper ( zsgb - bio , beijing , china ) .
sections were washed three times with pbs and the antigen was visualized with polyperoxidase - anti - mouse / rabbit igg ( zsgb - bio ) and dab as substrate ( zsgb - bio ) .
the sections were counterstained with mayer hematoxylin and mounted in permount .
blank controls were obtained by replacing the primary antibodies with pbs .
the expression pattern criteria determined by ihc included : ' diffuse ' when almost all cells expressed the antigen ; ' focal ' when isolated groups of positive cells were seen within a histological section ; ' isolated staining ' when single cells were positive for the marker .
all slides were reviewed by a pathologist ( lu jy , guilin , china ) and a well - trained researcher in pathology ( li ld , guilin , china ) blinded to the patients' clinical information .
statistical analysis the chi - square test and the mann - whitney u test were applied to compare the expression of markers between lung cancer and non - cancer .
the chi - square test was also performed to analyze the association between mrna expression markers and lung cancer clinical factors .
for evaluation of diagnostic value of seven stem - cell - associated markers mrna , the following calculations were made : sensitivity (%) was calculated as true - positive /( true - positive + false - negative ) x100 , specificity (%) as true - negative /( true - negative + false - positive ) x100 and diagnostic accuracy (%) as ( true - positive + true - negative /( true - positive + false - negative + false - positive + true - negative ) x100 , where true - positive denotes specimens with stem - cell - associated marker positive expression and lung cancer diagnosis during follow up , true - negative denotes negative expression with no lung cancer , false - positive denotes positive expression with no lung cancer and false - negative denotes negative expression and diagnosed lung cancer .
all statistical analyses were performed by spss 17.0 software package for windows .
p < 0.05 was regarded statistically significant .
results the mrna expression of seven stem - cell - associated markers in biopsy samples obtained through bronchoscopy the expression of bmi1 , cd133 , cd44 , sox2 , nanog , oct4 and msi2 mrna in bronchoscopic biopsies of lung cancer and non - cancer patients are presented in table 2 and figure 1 .
overall , the mrna expression of seven markers was higher in the malignant group than in the benign group .
however , the mrna relative levels of bmi1 , cd133 and cd44 by rt - pcr were not significantly different between lung cancer and non - malignant lung tissues analyzed by mann - whitney u test , nor were the expression rates of cd44 and msi2 .
we found that the bmi1 positive expression rate was significantly correlated with histology types ( p = 0.007 ) and differentiation ( p = 0.027 ) , while the positive rate of nanog was negatively correlated with differentiation ( 0.032 ) .
however , the positive expression rates of cd133 , cd44 , sox2 , oct4 and msi2 did not correlate with age , gender , histological type , stage and differentiation of lung cancer ( table 3 ) .

localization and expression patterns of stem - cell - associated markers protein in non - malignant lung tissues and lung cancer based on our rt - pcr results , most of the stem - cell - associated markers mrna were expressed in non - malignant lung tissues although the expression levels were relative low .
therefore , we further examined the localization and expression patterns of stem cell markers in non - malignant lung tissues and lung cancer by ihc .
bmi1 was diffusely expressed in bronchial epithelium cells , alveolar epithelium cells , lung interstitial cells and some inflammatory cells of all non - malignant lung tissues ( figure 2a ) , and was diffusely expressed in 47 cases of lung cancer and focally expressed in 1 case of ad and 1 case of sclc ( figure 2a ) .
similar to bmi1 , cd44 was abundantly expressed in alveolar epithelium cells , lung interstitial cells , macrophages , inflammatory cells and metaplastic squamous bronchial epithelium of non - malignant lung tissues ( figure 2b ) , but was absent in normal bronchial epithelium cells .
38 out of 50 lung cancer tissues were positive for cd44 , of which 37 cases were diffusely positive and 1 case was focally positive expression ( figure 2b ) .

all images were taken at 400x magnification .
in non - malignant lung tissues , cd133 was exclusively expressed in some , but not all , bronchial epithelium cells and bronchial smooth muscle cells ( figure 2c ) .
cd133 + bronchial epithelium cells were found in 74 % of non - malignant lung tissues while cd133 + bronchial smooth muscle cells were 70 % .
in lung cancer tissues , about 56 % of tumor samples were diffusely positive , 8 % focally positive and 2 % isolated positive for cd133 ( figure 2c ) .
in non - malignant lung tissues , all bronchial epithelium and squamous metaplasia showed positive expression of sox2 ( figure 2d ) and msi2 ( figure 2e ) , the expression decreases in terminal bronchioles and was absent in alveolar epithelial .
in lung cancer , the expression of sox2 and msi2 was 90 % and 94 % respectively , and more than 85 % of tissues was diffusely positive for both of the markers ( figure 2d , e ) .
in non - malignant lung tissues , only 2 cases of squamous metaplasia in non - tumor adjacent lung tissues were positive for nanog ( figure 2f ) , whereas , nanog staining was detected in 36 of 50 ( 72 %) cases of lung cancer , in which 29 cases were diffusely positive , 6 cases were focally positive and 1 case was isolated positive ( figure 2f ) .
in all non - malignant lung tissues , no positivity for oct4 was observed ( figure 2g ) .
in lung cancer group , only one case of scc and one case of sclc were focally positive for oct4 ( figure 2g ) .
potential value of the expression of stem - cell - associated markers as diagnostic markers table 4 describes the specificity , accuracy and sensitivity of seven stem - cell - associated markers mrna in bronchoscopic biopsies of lung cancer and non - cancer patients .
the stem - cell - associated markers with the highest sensitivity for malignancy were cd44 ( 98.2 %) , sox2 ( 98.2 %) and msi2 ( 96.4 %) , but their specificity were too low to be considered of no clinical significance .
nanog exhibited the highest specificity which was 66.7 % , and its sensitivity was 63.4 % .

our data found nanog mrna had the highest specificity in lung cancer .
we further confirmed the high diagnostic value of nanog protein levels by ihc , nanog was overexpressed in lung cancer tissues , but rarely expressed in non - malignant lung tissue .
taken together , these results demonstrate that nanog mrna is a potential diagnostic marker for lung cancer .
nanog is a transcription factor that plays an important role in maintaining self - renewal of embryonic stem cells .
current studies have reported that the expression of nanog was higher in multiple cancerous tissues than in their normal counterparts , including breast cancer [ 20 ] , gastric adenocarcinomas [ 21 ] , colorectal cancer [ 22 ] , gliomas [ 23 ] and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas [ 24 ] .
in this study , we found the expression of nanog mrna in bronchoscopic biopsies of lung cancer patients was significantly higher compared to that in non - cancer patients .
although nirasawa et al .
[ 16 ] have also reported that the expression of nanog mrna was higher in surgically resected lung cancer tissues than in non - cancerous tissues , it is not known what cells express nanog in non - cancerous lung tissues .
using ihc , we found nanog was only expressed in metaplastic squamous bronchial epithelium cells in 2 out of 50 non - malignant lung tissues , and was negative in normal airway epithelia .
therefore , nanog may be a good diagnostic marker for lung cancer .
in this study , our results showed that the mrna levels of bmi1 , cd44 and cd133 were not significantly different between lung cancer and non - malignant lung tissues .
further analyzed by ihc , we observed that bmi1 , cd44 and cd133 were not only expressed in lung cancers , bmi1 and cd44 were also abundantly expressed in lung interstitial cells , inflammatory cells and bronchial epithelium cells , and cd133 was diffusely expressed in some normal bronchial epithelium cells and bronchial smooth muscle cells , consistent with previous studies [ 11,25,26 ] .
hence , bmi1 , cd44 and cd133 are poor diagnostic markers for lung cancer .
likewise , although the expression levels of sox2 and msi2 mrna in lung cancer tissues were significantly higher as compared with non - malignant tissues , we found more than 80 % of bronchoscopic biopsy specimens of non - cancer patients were positive for sox2 and msi2 mrna , and all non - malignant tissues were positive for sox2 and msi2 protein expression , consistent with previous findings [ 10,27,28 ] .
therefore , sox2 and msi2 have poor diagnostic specificity in lung cancer .
it is still controversial whether lung cancer cells express oct4 .
some researchers believe that oct4 is involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis of lung cancer , and therefore is a potential diagnostic marker and useful therapeutic target of lung cancer [ 9,15,29 ] , while others did not detect oct4 expression in lung cancer [ 10,30 ] .
although we observed oct4 mrna expression in 85.7 % of lung cancer and 38.8 % of non - cancer bronchoscopic biopsy specimens , but oct4 protein was nearly absent in 50 cases of lung cancer tissues .
the reason for this discrepancy is unclear , but may be due to complex mechanism of post - transcriptional regulation , or potential presence of unknown oct4 pseudogenes which cause false positive detection by rt - pcr .
therefore , the diagnostic value of oct4 mrna in bronchoscopic biopsy specimens requires further investigation .
in addition , we examined the correlation of seven stem cell markers expression in bronchoscopic biopsy specimens of lung cancer with patient clinical features .
as we know , poorly differentiated cancers show stronger aggressive and metastatic ability [ 21 ] .
we found the positive expression rates of nanog and bmi1 mrna was inversely correlated to differentiation of lung cancer , indicating these two markers may be useful to predict tumor progression and poor prognosis in lung cancer .
chiou et al .
[ 29 ] reported that nanog expression in surgically resected lung cancer tissues is an independent prognostic factors of poor prognosis for patients .
vrzalikova and colleagues [ 31 ] also believed that the expression of bmi1 in surgically resected lung cancer tissues is a prognostic marker in lung cancer .
however , surgical resection is not an option for all lung cancer patients , and therefore the use of these markers in bronchoscopic biopsies to predict prognosis would be a great clinical advantage .
conclusions in conclusion , the expression of nanog mrna in bronchoscopic biopsy specimens is useful diagnostic marker for lung cancer .
further investigation of the diagnostic potential of nanog in early stages of lung cancer may have a profound clinical impact .

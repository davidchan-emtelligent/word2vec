summary vitamins and related compounds , such as provitamins , biopigments and antioxidants , belong to those few chemicals that appeal in a positive way to most people .
these terms sound synonymous to vitality , good health and mental strenght , even to the layman .
everyone of us needs his / her daily intake of ( pro ) vitamins and antioxidants , normally provided by a balanced and varied diet .
however , current food habits or preferences , food availabilities , as well as food processing , preservation or cooking methodologies and technologies , do not always assure a sufficient balanced natural daily ( pro ) vitamin supply to a healthy individual , and even more so for a stressed or sick human being .
today , modern society is seldom confronted with the notorious avitaminoses of the past , well known to the western world , but they do still occur frequently in overpopulated , war - ridden , poverty - or famine - struck regions on our globe , as well as for surprisingly large population groups in developed countries .

apart from their in vivo nutritional - physiological roles as essential growth factors and coenzymes for man , animals , plants and microorganisms , vitamins and related compounds are increasingly being introduced as food and as feed additives , as medical - therapeutical agents , as health promoting aids .
nowadays an impressive number of processed foods , feeds , cosmetics , pharmaceutical and chemical formulations contain extra - added ( pro ) vitamins or vitamin - related compounds , and single and multivitamin preparations are commonly taken or prescribed .
in addition to their well known nutritional , physiological and medical importance , ( pro ) vitamins and related health compounds have also found large - scale technical applications , for example , as antioxidants ( d - isoascorbic acid as the c5 - epimer of vitamin c , glutathione or gsh , tocoferol or vitamin e , carotenoids , wine and tea polyphenols ) , as acidulants ( ascorbic acid or vitamin c ) and as bio - pigments ( yellow - orange - red carotenoids , yellow riboflavin or vitamin b2 , red monascus - pigments ) in the food , feed , cosmetic , chemical , nutraceutical and pharmaceutical sectors .
there is especially a need for natural pigments of ( micro ) biological origin to replace synthetic pigments and colourants .
certain fungal carotenoids ( blakeslea trispora - beta - carotene , xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous - asthaxanthin ) and algal carotenoids ( dunaliella salina - xanthophylls , lycopene ) , cochineal - carminic acid from scale insects , blue - purple phycocyanin from arthrospira - cyanobacteria , and fungal dark reddish monascin - pigments are already used in this respect , but these bioprocesses need to be further improved as to yield and biotechnology tools involved ( vandamme , 2002 , 2011 ; babitha , 2009 ; yoshida et al. , 2009 ; patakova , 2013 ; vandamme and revuelta , 2016 ) .
the above considerations point towards an extra need for ( bio ) synthesis and supply of ( pro ) vitamin , biopigment , antioxidant and related health molecules , above the level provided naturally from microbial , plant and animal food sources .
switch from extraction technology over chemical synthesis towards industrial biotechnology - based processes till a few decades ago most added vitamins and related health compounds were indeed industrially prepared via extraction technologies .
concentrates or extracts derived from vitamin - rich or coloured natural staple food products ( of plant , animal or microbial origin ) , however , find now relatively little use in the food , feed , pharmaceutical or cosmetic sector .
apart from their high price , some of the reasons are : the level of vitamins and related health compounds in the natural plant / animal source is usually relatively low and fluctuates drastically ( i.e. exceptions are essential fatty acids or efa 's ( also known as pufa 's ) in plant oils and fish oils , vitamin d in fish oils ) .
their organoleptic presentation and shelf - life is often not optimal .
water - soluble vitamins are easily lost by aqueous extraction or other manipulations of these natural food vitamin sources ( pro ) vitamins and related health compounds are labile molecules during the process of harvest , preservation , storage ( or during preparation of foodstuffs ) and are generally sensitive to ph , heat ( riboflavin or b2 , d - pantothenic acid or b5 , pyridoxine or b6 , folic acid or b9 , vitamin c , vitamin e ) , light ( b2 , b6 , b9 , vitamin b12 , c , vitamin d ) , oxygen ( b9 , c , d , essential fatty acids or efa 's ) .
these drawbacks have led to the industrial manufacturing of most vitamins and related factors by chemical or microbial synthesis routes .
currently , several vitamins are made chemically ( pro - vitamin a , cholecalciferol or d3 , e , vitamin k1 or phylloquinone and thiamine or b1 , b5 , b6 , d - biotin or b7 , b9 ) , although enzymatic , microbiological and / or biotechnological methods emerge or exist , although not economically profitable as yet ( demain , 2000 , 2007 ; laudert and hohmann , 2011 ) .
for some of these molecules or their precursors , biotechnological processes are being developed , although indeed not competitive as yet with chemical synthesis .
two biotechnological routes , directed fermentation processes and biocatalysis , take gradually over from chemical synthesis for most of these chemically complex molecules .
both technologies were initially often rescued only when chemical processes failed to be successful or were uneconomical .
nowadays they become often first choice technologies for several reasons : they are based on renewable resources , deliver simple as well as very complex molecules directly in a desirable chiral form and in an economically favourable way and they are considered in society as clean , sustainable and reuse technologies .
vitamin and vitamin - like compounds that are produced ( exclusively ) by microbial fermentation with bacteria , yeasts or fungi include vitamin c , b2 , b12 , and ergocalciferol or d2 , efa 's , menaquinone or k2 , coenzyme q10 or ubiquinone , pyrrolquinoline quinine or pqq .
the antioxidant glutathione ( gsh ) is currently produced with the yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae or candida utilis ( li et al. , 2004 ; wang et al. , 2016 ) , while the health supplement gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) is produced based on a two - step bioprocess : glutamate fermentation with corynebacterium , and subsequent conversion into gaba with lactic acid bacteria - derived overexpressed glutamate decarboxylase ( shi and li , 2011 ; pham et al. , 2016 ) .
some molecules can be produced by a combination of chemical steps and microbial / enzymatic steps ( niacin or b3 , b5 , c , l - carnitine ) ( vandamme , 1989 , 1992 ; de baets et al. , 2000 ; shimizu , 2008 ; laudert and hohmann , 2011 ; eggersdorfer et al. , 2012 ; vandamme and revuelta , 2016 ) .
some are produced via microalgal culture in ponds or fermentor vessels ( beta - carotene , efa 's ) ( cadoret et al. , 2012 ; borowitzka , 2013 ) .
challenges and future developments the detailed biosynthesis pathways ( and their metabolic regulation and controls ) used by those microorganisms have been elucidated for several ( pro ) vitamins , biopigments , antioxidants and similar health compounds , but this was only realized gradually over the last decades , mainly by studying model microbial strains and / or producer microorganisms , such as bacteria ( escherichia coli , serratia , bacillus , lactobacillus , pseudomonas , gluconobacter , sinorhizobium , agrobacterium , hyphomicrobium , propionibacterium , rhodobacter , rhodococcus , arthrospira - cyanobacteria ) , yeasts ( saccharomyces , candida , xanthophyllomyces , yarrowia ) , fungi ( blakeslea , ashbya , mortierella , mucor , monascus ) , as well as green microalgae ( dunaliella , euglena , haematococcus ) , marine non - photosynthetic dinoflagellates ( crypthecodinium ) and marine non - photosynthetic thraustochytrid - microalgae ( schizochytrium ) ( laudert and hohmann , 2011 ; borowitzka , 2013 ; ledesma - amaro et al. , 2013 ; bellou et al. , 2014 ; vandamme and revuelta , 2016 ) .
it turned out that the pathways involved and their metabolic regulations are very complex and often very difficult to deregulate to arrive at overproduction levels of the desired compounds .
for some of the vitamins , biopigments and antioxidants and other health factors , microbial overproduction to reach industrially relevant levels still remains a challenge .
for gaba production , a high - yielding one - step fermentation process directly from glucose should replace the currently two - stage process now in use .
in the case of biotin or b7 , efficient bioconversion of dethiobiotin to biotin ( the last biochemical step in the pathway ) remains a real scientific bottleneck .
as to vitamin b1 and b9 , highly engineered bacillus subtilis strains converted expensive precursors only into quite low b1 or b9 levels , respectively , preventing industrial application so far .
for vitamin c , a defined mixed co - culture process is recently established on a large scale , and even a direct fermentation route is about to bring a breakthrough .
furthermore , it is well known that gut microbiota , mainly anaerobic eubacteria and archaea , act as vitamin suppliers to their hosts ( le blanc et al. , 2013 ) ; however , few of them have been studied sufficiently in this context .
they could be a source of novel genes and for strain development for industrial vitamin and other growth and health factor production .
apart from obtaining these vitamins , biopigments , antioxidants and related compounds via a microbial process - what microbial fermentation , biocatalysis and algal culture is all about - , fermentation - based or enzymatic biocatalytic processes furthermore yield the desired enantiomeric compound , and they can be redirected via genetic and biotechnological modification of the involved bacteria , yeast and fungi or microalgae into high - yielding production systems .
scientific breakthroughs in high - throughput screening methodologies , in molecular genetics of industrial microbial strains , in systems ( micro ) biology , in directed evolution , metabolic engineering and modelling , but equally in enzyme and cell engineering has allowed to make progress towards industrial realizations of vitamin and vitamin - like compounds production .
a striking example is the production by fermentation of vitamin b2 using ashbya gossypii .
the productivity of the initial industrial strains developed by classical mutagenesis techniques has been greatly improved by a combination of metabolic engineering , comparative genome and transcriptome analysis and genome metabolic modelling approaches ( karos et al. , 2004 ; ledesma - amaro et al. , 2014 , 2015 ) .
the success of this strain improvement programme allowed the replacement at industrial level of the vitamin b2 chemical process by the currently used based on microbial fermentation .
the implementation of the biotechnological process reduced the production and environmental protection costs by 43 % in relation to the chemical manufacturing process ( fig. 1 ) .
furthermore , co2 emission was reduced by around 30 % .
as result of its single main step , fermentation has substantial cost savings compared with the multi - stage chemical process ( wenda et al. , 2011 ) .
figure 1 environmental and economic impact analysis of riboflavin ( vitamin b2 ) chemical and biotechnological processes in different phases of development ( phase 1 , 2 and 3 ) .
also , combination of directed evolution and rational protein design using computational tools has become significant to create even novel enzymes , expanding their application potential in the field of ( pro ) vitamin and related fine chemical biosynthesis .
asymmetric biocatalysis with microbial enzymes and cells has now achieved high efficiency , enantioselectivity and yield , such that - for a wide variety of chiral products , including ( pro ) vitamins , biopigments , antioxidants and related compounds - biocatalysis has become a preferred production alternative in organic synthesis and in the ( bio ) chemical industry for fine as well as for bulk chemicals .
novel culture techniques , rapid sampling and sensor methodologies , improved bioreactor design and downstream processing , all will contribute to the growing interest to use industrial microbiology - and biotechnology - based processes in industry .
the design - based engineering of industrial microbial strains is still hampered by incomplete knowledge of cell biochemistry , metabolic regulation and cell biology .
advances in systems biology technologies and in synthetic ( micro ) biology can now also contribute to fill this gap .
especially a mix of all these advancements will allow for high - yielding microbial strains to be constructed that are suitable for industrial microbial - based production of ( pro ) vitamins , biopigments , antioxidants and related health compounds .
in the future , the advent of synthetic biology will further lead to the tailor made construction of high - yielding microbial ( pro ) vitamin , biopigment , antioxidant and other health factor producer strains .
conflict of interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests .

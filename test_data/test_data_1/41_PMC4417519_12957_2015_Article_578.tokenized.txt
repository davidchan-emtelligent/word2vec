solitary fibrous tumors ( sfts ) rarely develop in the pelvis .
when they do arise , they are usually treated using surgery , although sfts are often very large by the time of diagnosis , which makes surgical excision difficult .
we report a case of a 63 - year - old man who was referred to our hospital for the treatment of a giant tumor of the pelvis .
computed tomography ( ct ) revealed a 30 x 25 x 19 cm sized hypervascular tumor that almost completely filled the pelvic cavity .
the diagnosis of sft was made by ct - assisted needle biopsy .
the feeding arteries of the tumor were embolized twice .
the first embolization aimed to reduce the tumor volume , while the second one was planned a day prior to the surgery to obtain hematostasis during the operation .
tumor resection was then performed .
the blood loss during the operation was 440 ml , and there was no uncontrollable bleeding .
the postoperative course was uneventful .
no recurrence of sft was observed during a 2 - year follow - up. keywords solitary fibrous tumor embolization pelvis issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2015 background solitary fibrous tumor ( sft ) is a rare mesenchymal tumor that was first documented by klemperer and rabin [ 1 ] .
although sfts mainly develop in the pleura , they have also been found in various extra - thoracic sites , such as the peritoneum , liver , thymus , thyroid , intrapulmonary parenchyma , and nasal cavity [ 2 ] .
thirty percent of sfts occur in the abdominopelvic region , making it one of the major primary sites for this tumor [ 3 ] .
surgical resection is the treatment of choice for sfts .
however , abdominopelvic sfts are often very large by the time of diagnosis , which makes surgical resection difficult .
because of their rarity , the preoperative management for the safe resection of abdominopelvic sfts has not been fully defined .
here , we report a case of a giant pelvic sft that was successfully resected following preoperative embolization of the feeding arteries .
case presentation a 63 - year - old man presented to another hospital with frequent urination was diagnosed as having a very large pelvic tumor .
he was referred to our hospital for further treatment .
he had a history of medical treatment for diabetes from the age of 53 .
physical examination showed a large painless mass in the lower abdomen .
laboratory examination , including tumor markers , revealed no abnormalities except for a positive treadmill exercise test .
computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed a huge mass , measuring 30 x 25 x 19 cm , which occupied the pelvic cavity and was suggestive of a malignant mesenchymal tumor ( figure 1a,b ) .
the size of the tumor had increased by 20 % in 2 months since he was first diagnosed at the other hospital .
angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor fed mainly by the left obturator artery , left internal pudendal artery , and left superior vesical artery ( figure 1c ) .
ct - assisted needle biopsy was conducted to enable a pathological diagnosis .
histopathological examination revealed cd34 - positive proliferating spindle cells in a collagenous matrix , suggestive of sft .
coronary angiography showed total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery , hypoplasia of the left circumflex coronary artery , and 50 % stenosis of the right coronary artery .
percutaneous coronary intervention was therefore scheduled postoperatively .
in order to reduce the tumor volume , the feeding arteries of the tumor were embolized .
however , 1 month after the first embolization , ct revealed that the tumor had not reduced in size .
elective surgery was planned , and the second embolization of feeding arteries with lipiodol and n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate was conducted a day prior to the operation to prevent uncontrollable bleeding ( figure 1d,e,f ) .
laparotomy was then performed through a midline incision .
the tumor totally occupied the pelvic cavity .
it seemed to have grown expansively and was grossly well circumscribed , but it had also partly adhered to the left pelvic wall .
its surface was covered by a plexiform meshwork of large dilated vessels that were susceptible to hemorrhage .
vessels entering the tumor were carefully ligated .
the tumor did not invade the rectum or bladder and could be safely resected without massive bleeding .
the needle biopsy tract was not resected .
the total blood loss was 440 ml and no blood transfusion was needed .
the resected tumor measured 30 x 25 x 15 cm. macroscopically , the resected specimen was an encapsulated mass with focal hemorrhages and necrosis .
the cut surface was solid and grayish - white ( figure 2a ) .
microscopic findings were of proliferating round and spindle cells , which exhibited a disordered arrangement in a collagenous matrix without significant cytological atypia ( figure 2b ) .
the mitosis rate was low (< 1 / 10 high - power fields ) , and only 1 % of tumor cells were mib - 1 positive .
immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the tumor cells were positive for cd34 , vimentin , and bcl - 2 , and negative for desmin , s - 100 , and c - kit ( figure 2c ) , which was diagnostic for sft .
the postoperative course was uneventful , and no recurrence was apparent two years after surgery .
figure 1 preoperative computed tomography ( ct ) , angiography before embolization , and plain ct after embolization with lipiodol and n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate .
( a ) , ( b ) preoperative ct showed a giant pelvic mass lesion , measuring 30 x 25 x 19 cm .
( c ) angiography of the left iliac artery revealed that the mass was mainly supplied by the left obturator artery ( black arrow ) , left internal pudendal artery ( white arrow ) , and left superior vesical artery ( red arrow ) .
( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) ct after embolization showed that lipiodol and n - butyl - 2 - cyanoacrylate were well distributed to the left obturator artery ( black arrow ) , left internal pudendal artery ( white arrow ) , and left superior vesical artery ( red arrow ) , demonstrating successful embolization of the target vessels .

discussion sft was first described by klemperer and rabin in 1931 as a localized fibrous mesothelioma , but it is now recognized that sfts can originate in various extra - thoracic sites .
the age of onset of sfts is around 50 to 60 years , and the male - to - female ratio appears to be almost equal [ 4 ] .
surgical resection is the treatment of choice for both abdominopelvic sfts and those that arise in other organs .
no standard therapy has been established for inoperable sfts , and their surgical resectability is the most important prognostic factor [ 5 ] , as complete resection of the tumor is curative in more than 90 % of cases .
however , abdominopelvic sfts often remain asymptomatic and undiagnosed until they are very large .
indeed , wang et al. reported that the diameters of abdominopelvic sfts ranged between 2.5 and 28 cm ( mean , 12.7 cm ) , which sometimes makes surgical resection difficult .
in our case , the maximum diameter of the tumor was larger than in previous reports [ 2 - 4 ] .
in general , neoadjuvant therapies were applied for unresectable gigantic tumors after a preoperative diagnosis was made .
however , because of their rarity , the preoperative management of abdominopelvic sfts has not been defined .
in the present case , ct revealed a giant mass that filled the pelvic cavity .
the preoperative assessment revealed the patient had ischemic heart disease .
to resect this tumor safely , the preoperative diagnosis was vital in order to determine the appropriate neoadjuvant therapy .
on ct and mri scans , sfts are usually heterogeneous , with hypervascular areas showing intense enhancement , hypercellular areas showing moderate enhancement , and areas of cystic , myxoid degeneration , or necrosis showing no enhancement .
however , these imaging characteristics are also observed in other hypervascular tumors with fibrous content , including most sarcomas , gastrointestinal stroma tumors , and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors , and hence , it is difficult to differentiate these tumors by ct and mri findings alone [ 4 ] .
fluorodeoxyglucose positron - emission tomography shows heterogeneous accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose , and ultrasonography reveals a heterogeneous echotexture tumor ; however , these are not specific features for sfts [ 6 ] .
indeed , in our case , enhancing ct could only indicate that this tumor was possibly a malignant mesenchymal tumor , and it did not allow a definitive diagnosis .
these indistinct imaging findings explain why abdominopelvic sfts are diagnosed postoperatively in most cases [ 3 ] .
as we were not able to make a diagnosis based on ct findings , we performed a needle biopsy .
the risk associated with a percutaneous core biopsy seemed to be minimal , and only a few cases of tumor seeding of sarcomas after this procedure have been reported [ 7 - 9 ] .
therefore , a needle biopsy was taken in order to obtain a preoperative diagnosis , which allowed a definitive diagnosis of sft to be made .
the reported success of neoadjuvant therapy for sfts has varied .
combs et al. reported that radiotherapy was effective in controlling sfts of the central nervous system and spine , and some good results with radiotherapy have also been reported for abdominopelvic sfts [ 10 - 13 ] .
on this basis , irradiation is a candidate neoadjuvant therapy , although other studies have given disappointing results , and the efficacy of radiotherapy for sfts continues to be debated [ 3 ] .
adriamycin or a combination of cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , and dacarbazine have been considered to be the most effective chemotherapeutic treatments for sfts , but they have not been shown to prolong overall survival [ 12,13 ] .
unlike the approached described above , preoperative percutaneous embolization of feeding arteries has been shown to allow a safe , complete resection to be performed , especially in cases of thoracic , cervical , and spinal sfts [ 14 - 16 ] .
in the case of abdominopelvic sfts , a few reports have described but not emphasized the use of preoperative embolization , and most other reports have not discussed its importance [ 6,17 ] .
the resection of giant pelvic tumors , even if they are benign , is usually complicated by difficulties in visualizing the operative field , and the resection of giant pelvic hypervascular tumors such as sfts is sometimes very dangerous .
indeed , a massive transfusion was needed in several cases of abdominopelvic sft resection , and in two cases , patients died postoperatively of hemorrhagic shock [ 18,19 ] .
in our case , angiography revealed a hypervascular tumor that was fed by branches of the left internal iliac artery .
hence , embolization of the feeding arteries was performed to shrink the tumor and to prevent bleeding during the operation .
potential severe complications of embolization are related to ischemia and arterial occlusion .
these complications have been reported in the stomach , spleen , and kidney , but they rarely occur in the pelvis [ 20 ] .
unfortunately , the first embolization failed to reduce the tumor volume , although it prevented further tumor growth .
the second embolization was successfully performed , leading to a safe resection without blood transfusion .
in our case , the size of tumor was larger than that of previous reports , nevertheless the postoperative course was uneventful , and no recurrence was observed 2 years after surgery .
conclusion preoperative diagnosis and the embolization of feeding arteries are essential for the successful complete surgical resection of giant abdominopelvic sfts .

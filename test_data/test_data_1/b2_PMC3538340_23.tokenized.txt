most genome - wide association studies to date have been performed in populations of european descent , but there is increasing interest in expanding these studies to other populations .
the performance of genotyping chips in asian populations is not well established .
therefore , we sought to test the performance of widely used fixed - marker , genome - wide association studies chips in the han chinese population .
non - hapmap chinese samples ( n = 396 ) were genotyped using the illumina omniexpress and affymetrix 6.0 platforms , whereas a subset also were genotyped using the immunochip .
genotyped markers from the affymetrix 6.0 and illumina omniexpress were used for full genome imputation based on the hapmap 2 jpt + chb ( japanese from tokyo , japan and chinese from beijing , china ) reference panel .
the concordance between markers genotypes for the three platforms was very high whether directly genotyped or genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ; > 99.8 % for directly genotyped and > 99.5 % for genotyped and imputed snps , respectively ) were compared .
the omniexpress chip data enabled more snps to be imputed , particularly snps with minor allele frequency > 5 % .
the omniexpress chip achieved better coverage of hapmap snps than the affymetrix 6.0 chip ( 73.6 % vs. 65.9 % , respectively , for minor allele frequency > 5 %) .
the affymetrix 6.0 and illumina omniexpress chip have similar genotyping accuracy and provide similar accuracy of imputed snps .
the omniexpress chip however provides better coverage of asian hapmap snps , although its coverage of hapmap snps is moderate .
affymetrix 6.0 illumina omniexpress immunochip genetic polymorphisms djs export v1 genetic polymorphism is known to contribute to phenotypic variation , disease risks , and an individual 's response to pharmaceuticals and the environment .
for the past 20 years , genetic linkage combined with positional cloning has achieved tremendous success for mapping the variations that underlie monogenic mendelian diseases ( jimenez - sanchez et al. 2001 ) .
however , it was only with the development of the genome - wide association study ( gwas ) approach that significant progress was made mapping disease - associated loci in common complex human diseases ( wang et al. 2007 ) .
since the advent of the gwas era with the publication of the wellcome trust case control consortium studies in 2007 ( the wellcome trust case control consortium 2007 ) , gwas has become a routinely used tool to identify common , low - risk variants associated with or causative of a wide variety of human diseases .
this has led to the robust identification of more than 500 loci associated with common human diseases , representing a huge leap in our understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of human disease ( hindorff et al. 2009 ; manolio et al. 2009 ) .
the gwas approach has matured considerably since its introduction .
the key technical advances have come about through refinement of single - nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) selection on chips , marked increases in snp density , the development of copy number variant tagging approaches , and improvements in chip throughput and reduction in per snp genotyping costs .
at the moment , illumina ( http :// www.illumina.com ) and affymetrix ( http :// www.affymetrix.com ) microarrays are the two most popular microarray platforms in the gwas research area .
the ability to identify associations depends heavily on the coverage of the genotyping chip used ( barrett and cardon 2006 ) .
this coverage varies significantly between major ethnic groups and can be assessed in silico using previously genotyped samples of known ethnicity , typically from the hapmap study ( barrett and cardon 2006 ; the international hapmap consortium 2005 ; pei et al. 2008 ) .
this approach does not take into account real - world factors , notably the genotyping success rate of the different platforms and chips .
to date , most gwas studies have been performed in populations of european descent .
interest in gene - mapping in asian and african populations in particular has increased recently , driven at least partly by the fact that the so - called " low - hanging fruit " already have been identified for most common human diseases and the increasing evidence of specificity of a significant number of genetic associations to individual ethnic groups ( e.g. , cai et al. 2011 ; carty et al. 2011 ; noguchi et al. 2011 ; smith et al. 2011 ; yoon et al. 2012 ) .
this is particularly the case in east asia , where large case collections have already been established , or where high - quality health services in large populations enable the establishment of suitable case collections for gwas studies .
transethnic mapping , or comparing association findings in ethnically remote populations , can be highly informative about established loci in addition to identifying novel loci ( hughes et al. 2011 ) .
when disease associations are shared ( with the same polymorphisms ) between ethnically remote groups , this implies that the same causal variant is in linkage disequilibrium with the genotyped variant in each population , indicating a common founder mutation ( franceschini et al. 2012 ; twee - hee ong et al. 2012 ) .
here , we test the coverage of two commonly used genotyping chips , the affymetrix snp array 6.0 ( abbreviated as affymetrix 6.0 ) and illumina human omniexpress bead chip ( abbreviated as omniexpress ) , in a han chinese population ( n = 396 ) .
the affymetrix 6.0 is designed to genotype more than 906,600 snps and 946,000 copy number variants .
the omniexpress is an illumina infinium hd beadchip , which is designed to genotype 733,202 markers per sample .
a subset of individuals also was genotyped using the immunochip , an illumina infinium chip containing 196,524 polymorphisms for known immunogenetic loci ( cortes and brown 2011 ) .
chip performance was assessed in relation to data quality and genomic coverage , both for directly genotyped and imputed snps .
genotype concordance was evaluated between the affymetrix 6.0 and omniexpress , as well as between these two platforms and a third genotyping platform , the immunochip .
materials and methods study samples this study was approved by the research ethics committee of the second military medical university , china .
blood samples were obtained from patients attending outpatient clinics in changzheng hospital , shanghai , china .
all the study subjects provided signed informed consent .
subjects genotyped with the affymetrix 6.0 platform were a subset of a larger cohort of non - hapmap han chinese individuals at changzheng hospital , which included rheumatoid arthritis cases ( n = 51 ) and controls ( n = 188 ) .
only control subjects were genotyped further using omniexpress or immunochip .
genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using the axyprep blood genomic dna miniprep kit ( axygen , union city , ca ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
all genomic dna was resuspended in te buffer for the following study .
genotyping the concentration of genomic dna was measured using the quant - it picogreen dsdna assay ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) , and concentrations were standardized to 50 ng / mul for genotyping .
all samples were genotyped initially using the illumina omniexpress ( illumina inc. , san diego , ca ) and affymetrix 6.0 ( affymetrix inc. , santa clara , ca ) chips .
correlation of genotypes was then checked with a further illumina infinium chip , the immunochip ( illumina inc. ) , which contains a mixture of common and rare variants ( cortes and brown 2011 ) .
all platforms were operated according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
genotype clustering and quality control illumina genotype clustering was performed using illumina 's beadstudio software ( illumina inc. ) .
snps were reclustered using the study samples , low quality subjects were removed , and a subset of clustering results were manually inspected and verified .
all snps with gencall scores less than 0.15 were excluded .
for affymetrix chips , clustering was performed using the program birdseed version 2 , as implemented using affymetrix genotyper console v4.0 ( affymetrix inc. ) , using the default quality control ( qc ) thresholds .
population stratification was assessed with eigenstrat and smartpca ( both available from http :// genepath.med.harvard.edu /~ reich / software.htm ) using the hapmap phase 3 release 27 data ( price et al. 2006 ) .
this identified three ethnic outliers , which were removed before further analysis .
genotyped snps were evaluated using plink version 1.07 ( pngu.mgh.harvard.edu /~ purcell / plink /) , and markers with call rates less than 95 % , minor allele frequency ( maf ) less than 1 % , and hardy - weinberg equilibrium p - values less than 10 - 6 as were excluded from further analysis ( purcell et al. 2007 ) .
genotyping data in plink format has been deposited at the european genome phenome archive ( ega , genome - phenome http :// www.ebi.ac.uk / ega /) which is hosted at the european bionformatics institute , under accession number egas00000000131 .
imputation imputations were carried out using mach ( www.sph.umich.edu / csg / abecasis / mach ) with 50 rounds of model building ( li et al. 2010 ) .
the phase 2 jpt + chb ( japanese from tokyo , japan and chinese from beijing , china ) hapmap release 27 data were used as the reference panel .
imputation quality was assessed using the r2 metric .
imputed snps with r2 less than 0.3 were considered to be of poor quality and were excluded from analysis of imputation efficacy and genotyping concordance .
mach output files were converted to plink format using the free software gengen [ www.openbioinformatics.org / gengen / ( wang et al. 2007 )] .
coverage was calculated as the number of genotyped plus imputed snps ( r2 > 0.8 ) divided by the number of genotyped hapmap markers for the jpt + chb reference panel at a given maf .
corrected coverage was calculated using the formula presented in barrett and cardon ( 2006 ) , which adjusts coverage estimates for the total number of polymorphisms in the genome .
concordance analysis genotype concordance was analyzed using plink version 1.07 with the merge function in merge - mode 7 , which compares concordance ignoring missing genotypes ( purcell et al. 2007 ) .
prior to comparison snps genotyped on different platforms were adjusted for strand differences and allele coding to allow for accurate assessment of homozygote to homozygote miscalls as discussed in results .
figure 1 shows the number of individuals genotyped by each pair of platforms , and table 1 shows the number of shared markers .
types of discordance , maf , and r2 values for each snp were extracted from plink and gengen files using perl scripts .
correlations between concordance , maf , r2 were analyzed using the r function cor.test , and scatterplots were made using the r plot function ( r development core team 2005 ) .
figure 1 study sample size .
the total number of individuals genotyped by each platform is indicated under the platform name .

results genotyping success and concordance across chips a total of 396 subjects were genotyped , with subsets subjects genotyped on one , two , or all three platforms ( figure 1 ) .
for each array type , data were first subjected to qc to remove snps with low call rates and maf less than 1 % .
for the affymetrix 6.0 array , 582,284 snps ( 62.28 % of total markers ) passed qc and had maf greater than 1 % for each array .
the number of snps that were successfully genotyped by the omniexpress chip was 593,582 ( 81.19 % of total markers ) , which was slightly greater than for affymetrix 6.0 .
for the immunochip , 82,084 markers had maf less than 0.01 , and an additional 2,388 failed qc , leaving 112,112 ( 57.04 % of total markers ) genotyped markers .
genotype concordance between chip types was very high for all pairs of platforms ; dually genotyped snps were more than 99.8 % concordant in all cases ( table 1 ) .
no significant differences were noted between pairwise concordance , indicating that for genotypes that passed qc , genotyping accuracy did not vary substantially between the different platforms .
imputation efficacy information on imputation efficacy for hapmap snps using genotyped affymetrix 6.0 and omniexpress markers is presented in table s1 .
the number of imputable snps refers to the number of snps in the hapmap ii chb + jpt data set for a particular chromosome ( table s1a and b , second column ) .
imputation efficacy was initially evaluated using the mach default value of r2 = 0.3 as in nothnagel et al .
( 2009 ) .
overall , imputations were more efficacious using the omniexpress chip , with 4.59 % of snps failing qc vs. 7.10 % for the affymetrix 6.0 .
for both data sets , there was a high prevalence of snps with maf less than 1 % , but this was greater for the affymetrix 6.0 chip ( 8.42 %) than the omniexpress ( 4.72 %) .
coverage of hapmap snps imputed snps also were evaluated at r2 = 0.80 to calculate coverage of hapmap chb + jpt markers ( table 2 ) .
the hapmap phase ii chb + jpt panel contains 2,133,507 markers with maf greater than 5 % .
using the omniexpress platform , 25.3 % of these were genotyped , whereas 52.9 % were successfully imputed , giving a naive coverage rate of 78.2 % .
using barrett and cardon 's corrected formula for coverage with an estimate of 7.5 million snps in the genome , we calculated coverage as 73.0 % ( barrett and cardon 2006 ) , which is much lower than the 91 % coverage for markers with maf greater than 5 % reported by illumina for jpt + chb populations ( www.illumina.com / products / human _ omni _ express.ilmn ) .
corresponding coverage estimates for hapmap snps with maf greater than 1 % were 76.1 % ( uncorrected ) and 71.1 % ( corrected ; table 2 ) .
using the affymetrix platform , we found that the empirical coverages for snps with maf greater than 5 % were 66.6 % ( uncorrected ) and 59.2 % ( corrected ) , and for maf greater than 1 % were 66.4 % ( uncorrected ) and 57.3 % ( corrected ) .
this observed coverage was much lower than the theoretical coverage of 84 % for jpt + chb reported in li et al .
( 2008 ) .

coverage was calculated as the number of genotyped plus imputed snps ( r2 > 0.8 ) divided by the number of genotyped hapmap markers for the jpt + chb reference panel at a given maf .
corrected coverage was calculated using the formula presented in barrett and cardon ( 2006 ) , which adjusts coverage estimates for the total number of polymorphisms in the genome .
maf , minimum allele frequency ; snp , single - nucleotide polymorphism .
concordance of imputed snps the number of imputable snps , i.e. , the number of snps for one platform that can be imputed using a second platform , was calculated as the number of unshared ( not dually genotyped ) markers with phasing information in the hapmap ii chb + jpt set ( table 3 ) .
imputation efficacy between platforms corresponds to the percentage of imputable snps which passed imputation qc ( r2 > 0.3 , maf > 0.1 , call rate > 0.95 ; table 4 ) .
the omniexpress platform was more successful at imputing affymetrix 6.0 markers than vice versa ; however , both platforms had similar efficacy for imputation of immunochip snps .

percentages indicate the percent of discordant calls which fall into each category .
snp , single - nucleotide polymorphism .
concordance between imputed and genotyped snps for pairs of array platforms was very similar to concordance between pairs of genotyped snps ( table 1 and table 4 ) .
concordance rates exceeded 99.5 % in all cases , and no differences were noted in the concordance rates for different pairs of genotyping arrays .
this finding suggests that imputation is sufficiently robust to permit combining imputed and genotyped snps in studies using both affymetrix 6.0 and omniexpress arrays .
discordance between imputed and genotyped markers was classified into three categories : ( 1 ) a heterozygote mis - called as a homozygote , ( 2 ) a homozygote mis - called as a heterozygote , and ( 3 ) a homozygote called as the opposite homozygote .
for all chip types , homozygote mis - calls as heterozygotes were more common than the converse ( table 4 ) .
homozygote - to - homozygote mis - calls were uncommon with all chip types , comprising less than 5 % of miscalls in all cases , and occurred slightly less frequently in the imputed omniexpress data than the imputed affymetrix 6.0 data ( table 4 ) .
interestingly , homozygote mis - calls were noted between the illumina omniexpress and immunochip arrays , which use the same strand designation system ( table 4 ) .
correlation between concordance , maf , and r2 concordance was analyzed on a per - marker basis to explore correlations with maf and r2 , as well as to determine the types of discordance present .
it has been previously reported that imputation accuracy is positively correlated with maf , which implies that concordance between genotyped and imputed markers also should increase with increasing maf ( pei et al. 2008 ; marchini and howie 2010 ) .
here , we observed small but statistically significant positive correlations between maf and concordance .
a statistically significant but negligible correlation was observed between concordance and both maf ( pearson 's r = 0.07 , p < 0.001 ) and r2 ( r = - 0.09 , p < 0.001 ) were detected when comparing the imputed omniexpress snps to the affymetrix 6.0 genotyped snps ( figure 2 , top panels ) .
similarly , a negligible correlation was observed between concordance and maf ( r = - 0.04 , p < 0.001 ) for the imputed affymetrix 6.0 markers compared with omniexpress genotypes ( figure 2 , bottom panels ) .
the correlation between r2 and concordance was greater ( r = - 0.12 , p < 0.001 ) , but still quite low .
figure 2 concordance vs. maf and r2 for genotyping platforms .
each data point represents a genetic marker genotyped on one platform and imputed by the other .
concordance represents the proportion of subjects for which the directly obtained and imputed genotypes were the same , and maf and r2 were calculated using plink .
discussion in this study we have compared the real - world performance of two widely used genotyping platforms , affymetrix 6.0 and illumina omniexpress , in a non - hapmap han chinese population .
concordance between genotyped markers across the affymetrix and illumina platforms , including the immunochip , was high , with no significant differences noted between different pairs of chips .
nothnagel et al. showed similarly high rates of concordance between the affymetrix 6.0 and illumina 550k platforms for genotyping in a german population ( nothnagel et al. 2009 ) .
concordance of imputed with directly genotyped snps was slightly lower than between genotyped snps alone , but the level of discordance was still quite low .
although this discordance is minor , care must be taken when combining information from different genotyping platforms for cases and controls because platform - specific differences can lead to spurious or inflated associations ( sinnott and kraft 2011 ) .
low maf had little practical impact on the concordance or imputation quality as assessed by r2 , suggesting that these gwas chips , although not specifically designed to capture rare variants , may actually capture a significant fraction of genetic variation due to low frequency variants .
although discordance between both directly genotyped and imputed and genotyped snps was low , we noted differences in the type of discordance , with a greater frequency of homozygote genotypes being imputed as heterozygotes than the converse .
a slightly greater error rate was observed when comparing imputed data from affymetrix 6.0 chips with either the omniexpress or immunochip data , than with genotypes imputed from omniexpress compared with directly genotyped affymetrix 6.0 or immunochip snps .
this finding suggests that the imputation accuracy from affymetrix snps is lower than from omniexpress , although the difference was small .
imputation accuracy was lower on average for affymetrix platforms as compared to illumina platforms for chb + jpt populations in a previous study by li et al .
( 2008 ) .
significant differences were noted in the ability to impute from the omniexpress and affymetrix 6.0 , and imputation efficacy using mach was much lower in general than previously reported [ 16 ] .
many imputed snps were not considered for further analysis due to low genotyping rates , poor qc values , and maf less than 1 % in the target panel ( table 2 ) .
xu et al .
( 2009 ) demonstrated the presence of significant substructure in han chinese populations , with notable differences between northern and southern han subpopulations .
the hapmap chb + jpt reference panel includes genotypes from northern han ( beijing ) and japanese individuals , while our study population was from shanghai , which is in the southern han region .
some markers which are polymorphic in the jpt + chb reference panel with maf greater than 1 % may be less polymorphic or monomorphic in the han chinese population studied here , contributing to the reduced imputation efficacy .
greater imputation efficacy might be achieved by the use of mixed reference panels as described in huang et al .
( 2009 ) .
using hapmap data , illumina reports that omniexpress chips capture around 91 % snps with maf > 5 % and r2 > 0.8 in ceu ( utah residents with european ancestry from the centre du etude polymorphisme humain collection ) populations , with similarly good performance also in chb + jpt ( 91 % in hapmap ) .
in our study , coverage was much lower for the omniexpress platform ( table 3 ) .
this decreased coverage was largely attributable to imputation efficacy as described previously .
coverage estimates are known to be inflated when coverage is calculated using on the reference panel from which tagsnps were selected during the chip design process ( barrett and cardon 2006 ) .
this results in overfitting , which in combination with the small sample size of the hapmap data set can lead to exaggerated coverage estimates ( hao et al. 2008 ) .
markers for the illumina omniexpress platform were selected from hapmap snps representative of common variants ( maf > 5 %) which may also resulted in overestimation of coverage ( www.illumina.com / products / human _ omni _ express.ilmn ) .
the use of more specialized reference panels with larger sample sizes , and genotyping platforms tailored to east asian populations could improve coverage in future studies .
coverage for the affymetrix 6.0 chip was lower than for the omniexpress because a greater proportion of hapmap snps could be imputed using omniexpress .
lower coverage of ceu , jpt + chb , and yri populations by affymetrix arrays as compared with illumina arrays has previously been reported and may be related to differences in snp selection between the two platforms ( magi et al. 2007 ; li et al. 2008 , 2010 ) .
the affymetrix microarray technology relies on the differential hybridization of genomic dna to 25 - mer probes which match snp alleles , while the illumina infinium technology uses hybridization followed by primer extension ( kennedy et al. 2003 ; steemers et al. 2006 ; ragoussis 2009 ) .
although illumina emphasizes tagging snps , snp selection for the affymetrix system is limited by technical constraints .
for example , snps chosen for the affymetrix 6.0 assay must be located within fragments generated by a restriction digest by the enzymes nsp i and sty i ( http :// www.affymetrix.com ) , and are then required to ameliorate to universal hybridization conditions for adaptor ligation and subsequent inclusion on the array ( ding and jin 2009 ) .
this study demonstrates that , in a real - world setting , both the affymetrix 6.0 and omniexpress chips achieve good coverage of genetic variation in japanese and chinese as defined by hapmap. from our results , we can conclude that despite the different mechanisms in chemistry , the affymetrix 6.0 and omniexpress platforms both give good call rates and similar genotype accuracy , in comparison with the illumina infinium immunochip genotypes .
further , the imputation accuracy comparing snps imputed on one platform with snps genotyped on another platform was high , indicating that , with appropriate quality control , it is valid to combine imputed and genotyped snps in studies where samples have been genotyped either on the affymetrix 6.0 or omniexpress chips .

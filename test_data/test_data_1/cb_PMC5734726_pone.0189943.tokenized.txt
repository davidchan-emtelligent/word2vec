adaptive phenotypic plasticity is a key component of the ability of organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions .
fish have been shown to exhibit a substantial level of phenotypic plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic factors .
in the present study , we investigate the link between environmental sensitivity assessed globally ( revealed by phenotypic variation in body weight ) and more targeted physiological and behavioral indicators that are generally used to assess the sensitivity of a fish to environmental stressors .
we took advantage of original biological material , the rainbow trout isogenic lines , which allowed the disentangling of the genetic and environmental parts of the phenotypic variance .
ten lines were characterized for the changes of body weight variability ( weight measurements taken every month during 18 months ) , the plasma cortisol response to confinement stress ( 3 challenges ) and a set of selected behavioral indicators .
this study unambiguously demonstrated the existence of genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity , with some lines being particularly sensitive to environmental fluctuations and others rather insensitive .
correlations between coefficient of variation ( cv ) for body weight and behavioral and physiological traits were observed .
this confirmed that cv for body weight could be used as an indicator of environmental sensitivity .
as the relationship between indicators ( cv weight , risk - taking , exploration and cortisol ) was shown to be likely depending on the nature and intensity of the stressor , the joint use of several indicators should help to investigate the biological complexity of environmental sensitivity .

introduction phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to varying environments ( e.g. [ 1 ]) .
it may be adaptive , neutral or maladaptive [ 2 - 4 ] whether the phenotypic change leads to a more optimal phenotype with favorable characteristics or not .
adaptive phenotypic plasticity is thus a key component of the ability of organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions [ 5 ] .
in order to investigate the genetic factors underlying phenotypic plasticity , two main experimental approaches are traditionally used .
evolutionary - oriented approaches involve the testing of several genetic groups ( e.g. families , strains or populations ) in several environments , the level of phenotypic plasticity being assessed through genotype - environment interactions [ 2 ] or reaction norms [ 6 ] .
in animal breeding - oriented approaches , experiments are usually carried out in a single ( macro ) environment , the level of phenotypic plasticity being assessed through the scale of the within - group phenotypic residual variance in response to microenvironmental fluctuations [ 7 ] i.e. sensitivity to environment .
as shown by debat and david [ 8 ] , these approaches may not refer exactly to the same concept ( phenotypic plasticity , canalization , developmental stability ) but are all linked to sensitivity to the environment .
fish have been shown to exhibit a substantial level of phenotypic plasticity in response to a variety of abiotic ( e.g. [ 9 - 11 ]) and biotic ( e.g. [ 12,13 ]) factors .
furthermore , phenotypic plasticity in the context of adaptation to changing environmental conditions is particularly relevant for fish .
indeed , poikilothermy and close interactions with their living medium make them highly dependent on variation in water characteristics , including temperature , dissolved oxygen , ph , pollutants or pathogens .
management practices like transport , handling , confinement or dietary shifts can also severely affect farmed fish .
in the context of animal farming , sensitivity to the environment can be seen as an important component of robustness .
robustness has been defined as the ability to combine production performances together with high resilience to external stressors [ 14 ] .
therefore , genotypes that have the ability to maintain a given ( productive ) phenotype in a range of environments , i.e. that have a low sensitivity to changes in biotic and abiotic environment , are highly desirable .
organisms characterized by low sensitivity to environmental stress can either have biological sensors not sensitive to the stress ; or have a good ability to cope with the stress .
generally , physiological and behavioral indicators are used to assess the sensitivity of a fish to environmental stressors and hence its ability to cope with changes .
in fish , as in other animals , the most commonly used physiological indicators include the primary ( endocrine ) response to the stressor ( plasma catecholamines , cortisol and acth ) and the secondary ( metabolic ) response with variables or traits like plasma glucose , hematocrit , hemoglobin , plasma protein and condition factor [ 15 ] .
behavioral indicators of sensitivity to environmental stress in farmed fish include foraging behavior ( feeding motivation and feed intake ) , ventilatory activity , aggression , individual or group swimming behavior in different situations , exploratory behavior and food - anticipatory activity [ 16 ] .
to improve fish welfare [ 17 ] , including robustness in selective breeding schemes would allow balancing genetic change in production potential with genetic change in sensitivity to the environment [ 18 ] .
it is therefore of prime importance to understand the genetic determinism of the sensitivity to the environment. are some genotypes more sensitive to their environment than others ?
which factors influence the sensitivity to the environment ? are the different indicators of environmental sensitivity consistent ?
in animal breeding - oriented approaches , the genetics of environmental sensitivity is an active field of research , with statistical models [ 19 - 21 ] being developed to estimate genetic variability of residual variance .
however , those models rely on family structures , and need high number of large - size families to obtain precise estimates .
this leads to large and costly experiments , especially when one wants to measure many and / or not easy - to - measure traits .
in aquaculture species , there are only a few studies on the genetics of environmental sensitivity ( reviewed in [ 22 ]) .
the use of original biological resources , i.e. isogenic lines , offers a powerful alternative to overcome the difficulties encountered with standard populations when exploring the genetic determinism of sensitivity to environment .
isogenic lines of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss have been produced after two successive generations of gynogenetic reproduction [ 23 ] .
within each line , all fish are expected to be genetically identical , while the different lines are a sample of the genetic variability existing in the population they are derived from .
because there is no within - line genetic variability , the within - line ( among fish within tanks ) phenotypic variance is a direct estimator of the environmental variance , i.e. the environmental sensitivity of the line genotype [ 24 ] .
this animal material thus allows easy access to genetic variability of environmental variance with experiments of reasonable size .
using those isogenic lines , we demonstrated in a previous study the existence of a genetic determinism of the within - line phenotypic variability of body weight at early stages [ 24 ] , i.e. individual genotypes ( lines ) have the ability to express more or less homogeneous phenotype when kept in the same environment .
body weight was chosen as a trait expected to be integrative of the whole life history of each individual fish and to be representative of its ability to cope with the different environmental events it encountered .
one of the aims of the present study was to confirm the genetic determinism of body weight variability on a longer lifespan .
however , the links between this ability to express a more or less homogeneous body weight and classical ( i.e. physiological and / or behavioral ) indicators of sensitivity to the environment have not yet been investigated .
therefore , the main aim of the study was to investigate , for the same batch of animals , whether physiological and behavioral phenotypes were correlated with phenotypic plasticity of body weight .
the body weight and physiological parts of the study represent original experimental data .
the behavioral part of the study is based on data previously published in millot et al .
[ 25 ] that was re - analyzed for the specific purpose of the present study .
materials and methods ethical statement peima inra facilities are authorized for animal experimentation under french regulation c29 - 277 - 02 .
the experiments were carried out in 2007 - 2008 in accordance with the guidelines of the national legislation on animal care of the french ministry of research ( decree ndegrees2001 - 464 , may 29 , 2001 ) .
at this date , project authorization was not required .
experiments were conducted under the official licence of m. dupont - nivet ( a29102 ) , p. prunet ( 07393 ) and m.l. begout ( 17 - 010 ) .
biological material : production of heterozygous isogenic lines experimental fish were produced and reared in the inra experimental fish farm ( peima , sizun , france ) .
inra homozygous isogenic lines , previously established by quillet et al .
[ 23 ] and maintained at peima by single within - line pair mating , were used as breeders .
ten heterozygous isogenic lines were produced by mating several homozygous females from a single isogenic line ( b57 ) with ten homozygous sex - reversed xx males from 10 other isogenic lines ( a02 , a03 , a22 , a36 , ab1 , ap2 , b45 , b61 , n38 and r25 ) .
in order to obtain enough eggs , eggs collected from 24 females were used .
to minimize bias due to maternal effects and to minimize the initial environmental variance , these females were chosen among 200 homozygous females from line b57 because they had spawned on the same day and had similar egg weight .
eggs were mixed and then divided into ten batches , each batch being fertilized by one of the 10 homozygous males .
using this mating scheme , the between - line differences were expected to be genetic ones only , brought about by the male pathway .
it also avoided inbreeding effects likely to occur in homozygous lines .
previous results showed that performances of these heterozygous lines are in the range of those of conventional trout from the original population .
to avoid confusion with the inra homozygous isogenic lines , heterozygous lines will be named a02h , a03h etc .
fertilized eggs were incubated at 11.4degreesc .
at eyed stage , 1500 eggs of each of the lines were distributed into three replicates ( 500 per replicate ) for rearing in 0.25 m3 indoor tanks supplied with natural spring water ( 11.4degreesc ) .
at 137 dpf ( see fig 1 ) fish from each tank were transferred to 1.8 m3 outdoor tanks supplied with river water ( 11.3 - 16degreesc ) .
each replicate was started with 400 fish , then it decreased by random elimination to keep low density in each tank ( below 50 kg.m - 3 ) , until 100 fish remained at the end of the experiment at 578 dpf .
fish were fed ad libitum on a commercial diet ( biomar 's biostart range and le gouessant 's b - mega range ) , with automatic distribution during the indoor phase and with self - feeders ( imetronic ( r ) , france ) during the outdoor rearing phase .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0189943.g001 fig 1 experimental procedure .
dpf : days post fertilization .
during the outdoor rearing phase , repeated chronic confinement was performed from 305 dpf ( after measure d7 ) to 435 dpf ( until measure d11 ) and involved three cycles of confinement phase interspaced with a recovery phase ( table 1 ) .
also , fish were deprived of food for 22 days between 414 dpf ( d10 ) and 436 dpf ( d11 ) ; for 48 days between 470 dpf ( d12 ) and 518 dpf ( d14 ) ( fig 1 ) .

in total , there were 15 successive measurements for body weight ( d1 to d15 , fig 1 ) .
in addition , total body length and fulton 's condition factor ( k = 100 ( bw / l3 ) , where w is the body weight in grams and l the length in centimeters ) were measured at d5 and d15 .
no measurement was taken during the summer period to avoid further stressing the fish experiencing water temperature higher than their optimum .
in order to examine within - line body weight variability , the body weight coefficient of variation ( cv = ( standard deviation / mean ) * 100 ) was calculated by replicate , line and date .
cv allows the comparison of variability between lines and is a meaningful parameter often used by breeders to assess the quality of rearing since high cvs are indicators of poor environmental conditions .
also , because there is no within - line genetic variability , the within - line ( among fish within tanks ) phenotypic variance ( assessed here by cv body weight ) is an estimator of the random environmental variance , i.e. the environmental sensitivity of the line genotype .
a general linear mixed model for longitudinal data ( proc mixed in sas , with repeated statement ) was fitted to test the effect of the isogenic line on cv of body weight : cvijk = mu + linei + timej + linei * timej + residualijk where cv is the coefficient of variation for body weight in % for each replicate ; mu is the overall mean ; line , time and interaction line * time are fixed effects .
this analysis was performed on two distinct rearing periods : indoor ( d1 to d4 ; 10 lines * 4 dates * 3 replicates = 120 observations ) and outdoor ( d5 to d15 ; 10 lines * 11 dates * 3 replicates = 330 observations ) ( fig 1 ) .
for the covariance structure describing the repeated measures design of the data , we have modeled several covariance structures , with homogeneous or heterogeneous variances .
based on the information criteria ( aic , aicc or bic ) , no common model could be found for the two periods .
since the choice of the covariance structure did not have any impact on the estimation of the fixed effects ( data not shown ) , we have chosen to use the same model for the two periods , the unstructured model .
this is the most complex covariance structure , which estimates unique correlations for each pair of time points .
fisher 's least - square difference ( lsd ) test was performed using the lsmeans statement to investigate pairwise differences among isogenic lines over each period .
false discovery rate ( fdr ) procedure [ 26 ] was implemented to account for multiple testing .
physiological indicators of environmental sensitivity : confinement challenges and cortisol assays the line response to stressful environment was assessed by performing three confinement challenges associated with different stressor intensity : challenges 1 , 2 and 3 ( fig 1 ) .
challenges 1 and 2 were conducted at 169 dpf ( average weight of 25 g ) and 302 dpf ( average weight of 259 g ) respectively , and consisted in reducing the water level during one hour ( table 1 ) .
challenge 3 was a repeated chronic confinement stress performed from 305 dpf during 130 days : fish were exposed to 3 periods of high rearing density interspaced by 2 recovery phases ( table 1 and fig 1 ) .
at the end of the third period of high density ( at 435 dpf , see fig 1 ) , fish were exposed or not to an acute stress consisting of netting the fish out of the water during a few seconds .
indeed , previous results showed that a single measurement of plasma cortisol concentration at the end of a high - density period is not a reliable measure to evaluate fish response to chronic stress [ 27 ] .
instead , it has been shown in salmonids that the application of an acute stressor helps to reveal a chronic stress situation [ 28,29 ] .
for each challenge , the physiological response of the 10 isogenic lines was measured before and after confinement challenge through cortisol levels .
at each sampling date , 10 fish per replicate per line were sampled before the confinement for basal cortisol levels and 10 separate fish after the confinement for post - stress cortisol levels .
fish were netted and euthanized immediately in water containing excess 2 - phenoxyethanol ( 10 ml.l - 1 water ) .
blood samples were collected from the caudal vein into a heparinized syringe and the fish were individually weighed .
blood samples were immediately placed on ice , then centrifuged at 4degreesc and the plasma transferred to new tubes that were immediately frozen at - 80degreesc before transfer to - 20degreesc until cortisol measurements .
individual plasma cortisol concentrations ( ng.ml - 1 ) were determined according to the radioimmunoassay procedure detailed in auperin et al .
[ 30 ] .
basal and post - stress cortisol data of each confinement challenge were analyzed separately by a one - way anova using proc glm in sas , with the following statistical model : cortisolijk = mu + linei + replicatej ( linei )+ residualijk where cortisol is the observed plasma cortisol level in ng.ml - 1 ; mu is the overall mean per challenge ; line is a fixed effect and replicate ( line ) is a random nested effect .
to test for significant differences in cortisol level among isogenic lines , the f - test for the line effect was carried out by using the nested effect replicate ( line ) as the error term .
when significant differences among isogenic lines were detected , fisher 's lsd test was performed using the lsmeans statement of proc glm .
behavioral indicators of environmental sensitivity : spatial exploration , flight response and risk taking lines were also evaluated for behavioral traits .
detailed experimental set - up for these tests and results were published in millot et al .
[ 25 ] .
for the purpose of the present study , we removed redundant variables ( i.e. highly correlated ) in order to identify a subset of variables most representative of the different facets of the lines' behavioral features .
it is important to note that fish used for the behavioral characterization were part of the same experiment studying body weight and physiological response measurements .
they were reared in the same tanks until 198 dpf , when they were pit - tagged and redistributed for the behavioral assessment ( fig 1 ) .
firstly , risk - taking behavior was characterized at inra experimental fish farm between 347 and 363 dpf for the ten isogenic lines mixed in three replicates of 500 fish ( 50 pit - tagged fish per line x 10 lines ) .
full description of the test is given in millot et al .
[ 31 ] .
briefly , the experimental tank was separated into two equal zones ( safe ( shade ) vs. risky ( light )) by an opaque divider with a circular opening equipped with a pit - tag detection antenna .
at the beginning of the experiment , all fish were gathered in the safe zone , before the opening of the opaque divider , allowing the fish to move from the safe to the risky zone .
the two measurements associated with risk - taking behavior chosen were : the average percentage of time spent by each fish in the risky zone ( rt _%_ time _ spent ) and the average number of passages through the opening per fish ( rt _ ntpass ) ( table 2 ) .

the stimulus is the sudden fall of an object in the experimental tank .
7 out of the 10 heterozygous isogenic lines ( all lines except a22h , a36h and n38h ; 10 fish per line ) were characterized between 374 and 444 dpf ( full test description is given in millot et al. [ 32 ]) .
briefly , a single fish at a time was moved from its maintenance tank ( 400 l ) to the experimental tank ( 400 l ) .
after 2h of acclimatization , the activity and position of the fish in the experimental tank was recorded during three 20 - minute sequences : sequence 1 ( before the stimulus fall ) , sequence 2 ( just after the stimulus fall ) and sequence 3 ( 40 min after the stimulus fall ) .
analysis of video recordings allowed the separation of the tank into four virtual zones of equal surface : z1 ( stimulation zone ) to z4 ( the furthest away from the stimulation zone ) .
for the present study , eight variables were selected to describe spatial exploration behavior : the average proportion of time spent by a fish in each zone before ( spe _ seq1 _ z1 to z4 ) and after the stimulus fall ( spe _ avg23 _ z1 to z4 ) .
two variables were selected to describe flight response : the difference in distance travelled between sequences 2 and 1 ( fr _ dist _ diff21 ) and the average distance travelled by each fish after the stimulus fall ( fr _ dist _ seq23 ) ( table 2 ) .
correlations between average cv of body weight , physiological and behavioral traits in order to investigate the links between within - line body weight variability and classical ( physiological and / or behavioral ) indicators of environmental sensitivity , pearson correlation coefficients between average cv of body weight ( indoor and outdoor ) , average body weight ( indoor and outdoor ) , condition factor , cortisol levels and behavioral traits were obtained using proc corr in sas .
false discovery rate ( fdr ) procedure [ 26 ] was implemented to account for multiple testing .
also , in order to summarize this multivariate dataset and to group the isogenic lines based on the variables ( average cv of body weight , average body weight , condition factor , post - stress cortisol levels and the behavioral traits ) characteristics , a principal components analysis ( pca ) was performed using the factominer package in r [ 33 ] .
the rainbow trout isogenic lines and the variables were plotted on a 2d plot .
results at the end of the experiment ( 578 dpf ) , fish weighed on average 815 g , with a generally low mortality , involving a few fish per month .
two periods were however associated with higher mortality : at the very beginning ( until 50 dpf ) , with mortality up to 5.4 % and during the summer months ( 169 - 207 dpf ) , associated with poor water quality and occurrence of pathogens .
the 3 lines mostly affected by the summer peak of mortality were r25h ( 28.5 % mortality overall 3 replicates ) , n38h ( 18.8 %) and a36h ( 15.9 %) , and to a lesser extent a03h ( 9.7 %) .
in contrast , lines a22h and ab1h were the least affected , with 0.6 % and 1.4 % mortality over the same period .
coefficient of variation ( cv ) of body weight the changes of mean body weights and cv body weight over the course of the experiment are represented in fig 2 .
overall , cv body weight ranged from 9.94 to 23.92 % .
some general features can be highlighted : i ) an initial re - ranking of the lines in the period d1 - d2 ; ii ) a peak in cv body weight for the lines b45h and b61h in the period d3 - d5 ; iii ) lower variability in cv body weight among the lines in the period d9 - d15 , with almost no re - ranking .

longitudinal analyses with proc mixed in sas using the repeated statement were done on 2 periods : indoor ( d1 tod4 ) and outdoor ( d5 to d15 ) ( fig 2 ) .
for each period , there were significant line , time and line * time effects ( table 3 ) .
the longitudinal analyses showed that lines b45h ( 19.42 +/ - 1.15 %) , b61h ( 20.27 +/ - 0.93 %) and n38h ( 18.53 +/ - 0.60 %) were significantly more variable than the other 7 lines ( 14.76 +/ - 0.34 %) indoor ( fig 3a ; s1 table ) .

means with a different superscript are significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) .
cortisol level after confinement challenge cortisol levels before and after confinement are shown in s1 fig , for each of the three challenges .
generally , post - stress cortisol levels were much smaller for challenge 1 ( 26.5 +/ - 1.2 ng.ml - 1 ) than for challenge 2 ( 74.4 +/ - 4.3 ng.ml - 1 ) and challenge 3 ( 97.4 +/ - 8.9 ng.ml - 1 ) .
for challenge 1 , in the control and the stressed groups , there were no significant differences in cortisol level among the lines ( f9,282 = 0.40 , p = 0.919 ; f9,282 = 1.09 , p = 0.411 respectively ) .
however , line r25h exhibited unusually high variability in post - stress cortisol levels , up to 34 ng.ml - 1 difference between the 3 replicates compared with the other lines ( inter - replicate variability ranging from 1 to 12 ng.ml - 1 ) .
after removing the line r25h , there were significant differences in post - stress cortisol level among the lines ( f8,255 = 3.19 , p = 0.019 ) : cortisol level was significantly higher for line b45h ( 34.7 +/ - 5.2 ng.ml - 1 ) than lines a02h ( 22.5 +/ - 2.5 ng.ml - 1 ) , a22h ( 22.9 +/ - 2.5 ng.ml - 1 ) , ab1h ( 22.8 +/ - 2.8 ng.ml - 1 ) and n38h ( 24.1 +/ - 2.9 ng.ml - 1 ) ( s1 fig ) .
for challenge 2 , there were no significant differences in cortisol level among the lines in the control group ( f9,290 = 2.27 , p = 0.061 ) .
however , after confinement , there were significant differences among the lines ( f9,290 = 5.48 , p < 0.001 ) : lines a36h ( 95.1 +/ - 3.0 ng.ml - 1 ) , n38h ( 87.4 +/ - 3.4 ng.ml - 1 ) and r25h ( 97.0 +/ - 4.5 ng.ml - 1 ) showed a higher cortisol level than the other 7 lines ( 66.4 +/ - 1.4 ng.ml - 1 ) ( s1 fig ) .
for challenge 3 , there were significant differences in cortisol level among lines in the control ( f9,290 = 5.83 , p < 0.001 ) and stressed ( f9,290 = 14.96 , p < 0.001 ) groups .
in the control group , lines a22h ( 39.6 +/ - 3.0 ng.ml - 1 ) and ab1h ( 54.6 +/ - 4.4 ng.ml - 1 ) exhibited a significantly higher cortisol level than the other lines ( 18.5 +/ - 2.5 ng.ml - 1 ) , except ap2h ( 32.5 +/ - 2.4 ng.ml - 1 ) .
in the stressed group , line ab1h had the highest cortisol level ( 134.4 +/ - 6.0 ng.ml - 1 ) ( s1 fig ) .
behavior data detailed results and statistical analyses have been published in millot et al .
[ 25 ] .
for the risk taking experiment , data was available for the 10 isogenic lines .
significant behavioral differences between lines were observed , with lines a03h , b61h and b45h exhibiting higher risk taking behavior than lines a02h , a22h and ap2h ( s2 table ) .
for the spatial exploration and flight response experiment , data was available for 7 isogenic lines .
there were significant differences among lines in spatial exploration behavior in a new environment : line a03h showed a low level of swimming activity ( 54.3 +/ - 20.4 m ) , while line a02h showed homogeneous swimming and high spatial exploration behavior ( 367.3 +/ - 63.0 ) ( s3 table ) .
also , although all lines showed a decrease in swimming activity after the stimulus fall ( i.e. freezing behavior ) , lines b45h and b61h showed the highest decrease ( - 85.0 +/ - 19.9 m and - 82.4 +/ - 20.5 m respectively ) and line a02h the lowest ( - 10.6 +/ - 26.0 m ) ( s3 table ) .
integrative assessment of performances : correlations between average cv of body weight , cortisol levels and behavioral traits pca analyses were performed , including average cv of body weight during 2 periods ( indoor and outdoor ) , average body weight , condition factor , post - stress cortisol levels for the 3 confinement challenges and the 12 behavioral traits listed in table 2 .
the first 2 axes explained 55 % of the variance for the analysis including the 10 isogenic lines ( fig 4a , behavior data including risk taking only ) , and 57 % of the variance for the analysis including the 7 isogenic lines ( fig 4b , behavior data including risk taking but also spatial exploration and flight response ) .

( a ) 10 lines for cv body weight , average body weight , condition factor , risk taking behavior and cortisol levels after confinement challenges ; ( b ) 7 lines for cv body weight , average body weight , condition factor , risk taking behavior , spatial exploration and flight response traits , and cortisol levels after confinement challenges .
variables with cos2 < 0.5 are shown in grey with no labels ( the cos2 values are used to estimate the quality of the representation for variables on the factor map ) .
analysis performed with the 10 isogenic lines revealed several groupings ( fig 4a ) .
group 1 included lines b45h and b61h , associated with high cv body weight ( indoor ) , high risk taking behavior ( high rt _ ntpass ) and high cortisol level after challenge 1 .
group 2 included lines a03h and a36h , associated with high cv body weight ( outdoor ) , low average body weight ( outdoor ) and high risk taking behavior ( high rt _%_ time _ spent ) .
group 3 included lines n38h and r25h , associated with high cv body weight ( outdoor ) , high average body weight ( indoor ) , low condition factor at the end of the indoor period ( cond _ fact _ d5 ) , low risk taking behavior ( low rt _ ntpass ) and high cortisol level after challenge 2 but low cortisol level after challenge 3 .
group 4 included lines a22h , ab1h and ap2h , associated with low cv body weight ( indoor ) , low risk taking behavior ( low rt _ ntpass and rt _%_ time _ spent ) , low cortisol levels after challenges 1 and 2 but high cortisol level after challenge 3 .
group 5 included line a02h , associated with low cv body weight ( indoor and outdoor ) , high average body weight ( outdoor ) , high condition factor ( at dates d5 and d15 ) , low risk taking behavior ( low rt _ ntpass and rt _%_ time _ spent ) and low cortisol levels after the 3 confinement challenges .
the direction of the arrows on the graph of variables corroborates the correlations listed in s4 table : strong positive correlation between cv _ indoor and rt _ ntpass ( r = 0.70 , p = 0.023 ) ; positive correlation between cv _ outdoor and chalg2 _ cort _ s ( r = 0.60 , p = 0.069 ) ; negative correlations between cv _ outdoor and chalg3 _ cort _ s or cond _ fact _ d5 ( r = - 0.62 , p = 0.054 ; r = - 0.62 , p = 0.057 respectively ) .
analysis performed with the 7 isogenic lines confirmed the main groupings above ( fig 4b ) .
lines b45h and b61h ( group 1 ) were associated with low flight response ( low fr _ dist _ diff _ 21 ranging - 82 to - 85 m : freezing behavior ) and spent on average more time in zone 1 than other lines ( high spe _ seq1 _ z1 and spe _ avg23 _ z1 ) .
line a03h ( group 2 ) spent on average less time in zone 1 ( low spe _ seq1 _ z1 and spe _ avg23 _ z1 ) and more time in zone 4 ( high spe _ seq1 _ z4 and spe _ avg23 _ z4 ) .
lines r25 ( group 3 ) , ab1h and ap2h ( group 4 ) , and a02h ( group 5 ) were associated with high flight response ( high fr _ dist _ diff _ 21 ranging - 10 to - 30 m ) , high spatial exploration ability ( high spe _ dist _ seq23 ) and spent on average less time in zone 4 ( low spe _ seq1 _ z4 and spe _ avg23 _ z4 ) .
the direction of the arrows on the graph of variables corroborates the correlations listed in s5 table : strong negative correlations between cv _ indoor and fr _ dist _ diff _ 21 ( r = - 0.88 , p = 0.009 ) ; cv _ outdoor and cond _ fact _ d5 ( r = - 0.83 , p = 0.020 ) ; cv _ outdoor and chalg3 _ cort _ s ( r = - 0.78 , p = 0.040 ) ; negative correlation between cv _ indoor and spe _ avg23 _ z2 ( r = - 0.71 , p = 0.077 ) ; strong positive correlation between cv _ indoor and rt _ ntpass ( r = 0.92 , p = 0.005 ) .
discussion to cope with environmental conditions , organisms can put in place a complex set of physiological and / or behavioral responses .
hence , it is important to understand how organisms adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions or respond to environmental stress .
in this context , the present study aimed at investigating the genetic variability of sensitivity to environmental fluctuations , assessed here by coefficient of variation of body weight , and its correlations to physiological and behavioral traits. are some genotypes more sensitive to their environment than others ?
while working in natural populations , it can be difficult to disentangle genetics from environmental factors involved in phenotypic plasticity .
to answer this question , it is therefore easier and more powerful to use simpler biological models in a controlled setting where environmental factors can be controlled and / or monitored .
moreover , in animal breeding - oriented approaches , the genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity is usually assessed by complex statistical models [ 21,34 ] relying on large family structures .
for example , genetics of environmental variation in rainbow trout has been studied by using a variance model with the log - transformed squared residual values of a bivariate animal model as input data [ 35 ] .
one of the strengths of the present study is to rely on original biological material , the rainbow trout isogenic lines [ 23 ] , which allowed us to disentangle the genetic and environmental parts of the phenotypic variance and to directly investigate the genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity by looking at the within - line ( among fish within tanks ) phenotypic variance .
we focused on phenotypic variance of body mass ( 100 animals per line per replicate measured ) since , for other traits , the number of animals ( 10 per line per replicate for physiological traits ; 10 to 50 per line per replicate for behavioral traits ) precludes accurate estimation of residual environmental variances .
this study unambiguously demonstrated the existence of genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity , with some lines ( b45h and b61h ) being particularly sensitive to environmental fluctuations ( particularly during indoor period ) and others ( e.g. ap2h ) rather insensitive .
compared with a previous study using the same biological material ( heterozygous isogenic lines but with different genetic backgrounds , [ 24 ]) , the present study was based on a longer time period ( 18 months ) , with weight measurements taken every month , which allowed us to finely monitor the changes of environmental sensitivity over time .
the existence of genetic determinism of phenotypic plasticity for body weight is quite relevant in the context of the ability of the fish to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions .
it should be noted that the analysis assumed that the environment was common among the lines .
however , this may not be the case .
the lines could be experiencing uncontrolled differences in their environment ( e.g. social interactions ) that might induce differing levels of inter - individual phenotypic variation .
which factors influence environmental sensitivity ?
besides the genetic control highlighted by the existence of genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity , changes in the environment seemed to be a key determinant factor of phenotypic fluctuation between and within lines .
indeed , two lines ( b45h and b61h ) exhibiting a high coefficient of variation ( cv ) indoors ( period d3 - d4 ) were then re - ranked and showed a low cv ( i.e. low environmental sensitivity ) after transfer to outdoor rearing tanks ( period d7 - d15 ) .
it is important to note that peaks of variability were not due to a single replicate exhibiting higher variability than the other replicates .
the transfer to outdoor tanks was associated with changes in water quality , tank depth , lighting and feeding management : temperature variations were not buffered by the building , lighting changes during the year and water quality was not stable since river water was used .
moreover , fish were fed with mechanical distribution indoors , but with self - feeders outdoors .
on the whole , the environment was much less controlled outdoors and , although an increase of body weight cv could be expected , our observations show the opposite .
however , in our experiment , effects of rearing place ( indoor vs. outdoor ) were confounded with age .
there were many re - rankings of the lines during the very early phases ( period d1 - d2 , indoor ). from period d7 onwards ( outdoor ) , there was less amplitude in the variation of the cv of the 10 isogenic lines , with all lines within 5 % cv from each other ( fig 2 ) .
this is even more surprising because several rearing events were expected to impact body weight variability outdoor i.e. repeated chronic confinement and starvation ( fig 1 ) .
two hypotheses can be put forward to explain why the main differences in phenotypic plasticity between lines occurred during the early phases .
the first hypothesis is size - correlated bias in the coefficient of variation .
because of the overall reduction of growth potential with size , the expected relative weight gain between two successive measurements decreases as fish become larger .
therefore , the relative changes in cv values are expected to diminish with time , limiting the chance to observe re - ranking among lines .
the second hypothesis is that young fish are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations than adults [ 36 ] .
however , no experimental data in the present study substantiate this hypothesis , so our conclusions should be confirmed in further experiments .
finally , re - ranking of the lines occurred at d6 , with lines r25h , a36h , a02h , a22h and ab1h exhibiting a peak of cv body weight ( fig 2 ) .
this peak of phenotypic variability followed the summer period associated with poor water quality and mortality caused by the pathogen flavobacterium psychrophilum .
however , it is interesting that lines differed in their response to this summer mortality period .
indeed , among the lines exhibiting a peak of cv body weight at d6 , two were among the most affected by the summer peak of mortality ( r25h and a36h with 28.5 % and 18.8 % mortality respectively ) , and two among the least affected ( a22h and ab1h with only 0.6 % and 1.4 % mortality ) .
therefore , we cannot rule out that poor water quality and occurrence of pathogens over the summer period played a role in the re - ranking of the lines , but it is unlikely to be the predominant factor. are the different indicators of environmental sensitivity consistent ?
generally , physiological [ 15 ] and behavioral [ 16 ] indicators are used to assess adaptation potential of a fish and hence its ability to cope with environmental stressors .
the strength and novelty of the present study is to investigate the link between environmental sensitivity assessed globally ( by within - line phenotypic variance : average coefficient of variation for body weight ) and more targeted physiological and behavioral indicators .
trying to find the phenotypes that best characterize environmental sensitivity is crucial in the current socio - economic context of sustainable aquaculture under the global change .
pca and correlations results highlighted two extreme cases : i ) " sensitive " genotypes , sensitive to new events or environmental changes ; ii ) " non sensitive " genotypes , not sensitive to environmental changes .
this dichotomy between sensitive vs. non sensitive genotypes can be paralleled to the two opposite coping styles , proactive vs. reactive [ 37,38 ] .
coping style encompasses both behavioral and physiological ( neuroendocrine and metabolic ) responses of an organism to cope with stress [ 37 ] .
it has been established that animals can show two opposite stress - coping strategies , proactive ( high risk taking behavior , high flight response and low cortisol responsiveness ) or reactive ( low risk taking behavior , low flight response and high cortisol responsiveness ) [ 37 ] , also well recognized in fish ( reviewed in [ 38,39 ]) .
however , in the present study , we prefer to use the terms sensitive / not sensitive because , as discussed below , the cortisol data are not in agreement with the coping styles theory .
an interesting finding of this study is that cv for body weight , a trait expected to be integrative of the whole life history of a fish , could be a good indicator of a genotype 's sensitivity to its environment and be linked to behavioral indicators ( risk taking rt and flight response fr ) .
indeed , a significant correlation was found between cv body weight indoors and rt _ ntpass ( r = 0.70 , p = 0.023 with 10 lines ; r = 0.92 , p = 0.005 with 7 lines ) and fr _ dist _ diff _ 21 ( r = - 0.88 , p = 0.009 ) .
it is noteworthy that this relationship is only valid indoors , at the time when trout lines are the most divergent in terms of their response to the environment .
in contrast to behavioral indicators , cortisol responses to confinement challenges observed in this study are more difficult to interpret .
indeed , there was no consistent correlation between environmental sensitivity assessed by cv body weight and physiological indicators ( post - stress cortisol levels ) .
a significant correlation was found between cv _ outdoor and chalg3 _ cort _ s ( r = - 0.78 , p = 0.040 ) when considering 7 lines , but this correlation was not significant ( r = - 0.62 , p = 0.054 ) with 10 lines .
also , physiological indicators were only poorly correlated with behavioral traits .
this is surprising because plasma cortisol response after stress has been used as a selection criterion to select for high ( hr ) and low ( lr ) responding rainbow trout lines [ 40 ] and those lines were shown to differ in their behavioral responses [ 41 - 44 ] .
further studies will be needed to have a complete characterization of the coping style of our trout lines .
the relationship between environmental sensitivity ( average cv of body weight ) and behavioral indicators should be addressed in a wider range of environmental stressors ( type , severity and predictability ) , to investigate whether the relationship shown in this study stands or is context - dependent .
also , other physiological functions indicators ( e.g. respiration , immune response ...) should be considered in such studies , for a more complete characterization of the physiological response to stress .
in conclusion , the present study showed a certain consistency between average cv of body weight and some physiological and behavioral indicators of environmental sensitivity and confirms its potential to be included in environmental sensitivity assessment .
indeed , as the relationship between types of indicators is likely to depend on the nature and intensity of the stressor , the joint use of several types of indicators should help to investigate the biological complexity of environmental sensitivity .
the results of this study have implications in the context of establishing efficient and sustainable aquaculture production systems where improving animal welfare and environmental sensitivity is becoming a priority .
however , environmental sensitivity is a multi - facet trait , difficult to apprehend .
therefore , in order to include environmental sensitivity into breeding schemes , future research should include a diverse range of stressors and phenotypes to find the traits that best characterize environmental sensitivity .

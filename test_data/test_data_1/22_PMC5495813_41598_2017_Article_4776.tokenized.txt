homeobox genes regulate embryonic and placental development , and are widely expressed in the human placenta , but their regulatory control by dna methylation is unclear .
dna methylation analysis was performed on human placentae from first , second and third trimesters to determine methylation patterns of homeobox gene promoters across gestation .
most homeobox genes were hypo - methylated throughout gestation , suggesting that dna methylation is not the primary mechanism involved in regulating hox genes expression in the placenta .
nevertheless , several genes showed variable methylation patterns across gestation , with a general trend towards an increase in methylation over gestation .
three genes ( tlx1 , hoxa10 and dlx5 ) showed inverse gains of methylation with decreasing mrna expression throughout pregnancy , supporting a role for dna methylation in their regulation .
proteins encoded by these genes were primarily localised to the syncytiotrophoblast layer , and showed decreased expression later in gestation .
sirna mediated downregulation of dlx5 , tlx1 and hoxa10 in primary term villous cytotrophoblast resulted in decreased proliferation and increased expression of differentiation markers , including ervw - 1 .
our data suggest that loss of dlx5 , tlx1 and hoxa10 expression in late gestation is required for proper placental differentiation and function .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction the human placenta provides a critical interface between the maternal and fetal circulations during pregnancy .
formation of this interface is controlled by growth factors , cytokines and nuclear transcription factors .
cells respond to cues from growth factors and signalling molecules by either maintaining or altering their state of differentiation .
within cells , transcription factors play essential roles in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and this is evident in the most important placental lineage ; trophoblast cells1 - 4 .
the numerous cellular transcription factors that control proliferation and differentiation fall into a few families based on the presence of conserved motifs , which include the zinc finger , leucine zipper , helix - loop - helix , helix - turn - helix and homeobox domains5 , 6 .
the homeobox gene family plays fundamental roles in embryonic pattern formation and morphogenesis7 - 9 .
these genes were identified in mammals and vertebrates based on sequence homology to the genes of the drosophila hom - c complex8 , 10 , 11 .
in humans , the homeobox complex comprises 39 genes arranged in four separate chromosomal clusters ; hox a , b , c and d 12 - 14 - together into various subfamilies based on their functional and structural characteristics , and these subfamilies are essential for the control of specific aspects of cellular growth and differentiation14 .
homeobox genes play major roles in controlling extraembryonic development of the placenta .
studies of homeobox genes in the human placenta initially focused on identifying homeobox genes expressed in the normal placenta and in trophoblastic cancers9 , 15 , 16 .
subsequently , we and others identified human homeobox genes dlx3 , dlx4 , gax , esx1l and hlx , which play crucial roles in embryogenesis and organogenesis , as potentially important in normal and pathological human placental development17 - 26 .
we showed hlx expression is primarily in proliferating cytotrophoblast cell types and in mesenchymal stem / stromal cells during placental development25 , 27 and that hlx expression decreases in human idiopathic fetal growth restriction20 .
in cell culture models , we showed that hlx regulates trophoblast cell migration28 .
targets of hlx included genes involved in cell cycle regulation and other aspects of proliferation29 .
homeobox gene dlx4 functional studies revealed this gene was a regulator of trophoblast cell apoptosis and had a potential role in epithelial - mesenchymal transition26 , 30. with regard to homeobox gene dlx3 , we showed its expression was localised to nuclei of proliferating villous and extravillous cytotrophoblast cells , as well as in nuclei within the syncytiotrophoblast layer in the human placenta17 .
dlx3 target genes are associated with trophoblast differentiation , including gata2 and pparg that encode gata binding protein 2 and peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma respectively31 , cgb , the beta subunit of hcg18 , 32 , and 3 - betahsd18 , 32 .
finally , we and others have identified likely direct or indirect target genes downstream for homeobox genes that are involved in the regulation of endothelial functions33 .
whilst studies are progressing on growth factor regulation of homeobox genes and target gene identification in normal and pathological human placental development , our understanding of how external or environmental factors regulate homeobox gene expression in extraembryonic tissues , most likely via epigenetic mechanisms , is manifestly inadequate .
we previously showed that dna methylation ( the most widely studied epigenetic process ) is dynamic during placental development , with genome - scale changes in methylation patterns between first and third trimester placenta34 .
many studies have now investigated the association between dna methylation and placental function , including the potential role as a mediator of placental dysfunction in adverse pregnancy outcomes of preeclampsia , gestational diabetes and intra uterine growth restriction35 .
thus epigenetic modifications can regulate families of genes in the placenta during gestation .
dna methylation is one mechanism by which hox gene expression is modulated , with several hox gene loci showing tissue - specific dna methylation patterns36 , 37 .
indeed , the hox family of genes are more likely to show tissue - specific dna methylation profiles compared with non - developmentally essential genes38 .
in this study , we took a gene family - specific approach to determine the role of dna methylation in regulating homeobox genes during placental development .
specifically , we identified homeobox genes showing an inverse relationship between dna methylation and gene expression status from first to third trimester .
such genes are candidates for epigenetic regulation during placental development .
determining the temporal , epigenetic control of homeobox gene expression during placental development could provide insights into the function of these genes in placentation and in adverse pregnancy outcomes .
results identification of differentially methylated homeobox family genes in the placenta across gestation the 35 hoxa - d family genes are located in four clusters on chromosomes 2 , 7 , 12 and 17 , and are covered by 85 probes on the infinium 27 k methylation array .
additionally we were interested in other genes containing the homeo - box , based on previous associations with placental function or fetal development .
the output of the hm27 array consists of a beta value with a range from 0 - 1 , representing 0 - 100 % methylation .
each probe ( of the roughly 27,000 ) on the hm27 array , targets an individual cpg site in the genome , with the array designed in such a way that on average , each gene is targeted by 2 probes ( with a range between 1 to > 20 probes for certain genes ) .
using previously published methylation data34 ( geo31781 ) in 18 first , 10 second and 14 third trimester placentae we observe that for the most part hox genes do not show change in methylation during gestation ( figs 1 to 4 ) .
hoxa and hoxb clusters contained several differential cpg sites ( figs 1 and 2 ) , while hoxc and d clusters did not contain any ( fig. 3 and 4 ) .
furthermore , we extended our analysis to profile hox genes outside the hoxa - d families , and found that the majority of homeobox gene promoters show low methylation at first trimester , and remain hypo - methylated throughout gestation ( figure s1 ) .
homeobox genes for which expression is potentially regulated by promoter dna methylation were identified as those that showed a change in methylation ( delta beta ( deltabeta ) > 0.1 ; p < 0.05 ) from first trimester to term .
two genes , hoxb9 and msx1 ( represented by 3 probes ) , showed a significant loss of methylation ( figures s1 and s2 ) .
in contrast , five genes ( dlx5 , tlx1 , hoxa10 , tgif and hoxb6 ) showed increases in methylation over gestation ( figure s1 ) .
the most compelling finding was dlx5 , which was represented by 5 probes that all showed the same trend towards increasing methylation with gestational age ( table s1 ) .

dlx5 gene body methylation is associated with gene repression the dlx5 gene was covered by 18 probes on the array , of which 6 probes showed significant increases in methylation from the first to third trimester ( fig. 5 ) .
the sites of differential methylation were spread over exon 2 and 3 of dlx5 , and stretch across a region of about 1.7 kb. in order to determine the accessibility of this region , we looked at publically available encode dnasei tracks on the ucsc genome browser ( fig. 5 ) .
representative dnasei intensities are shown for several cell lines and primary cells .
as expected , all tracks show open chromatin at the promoter region , and several show dnasei signal within the identified differentially methylated region ( dmr ) .
this comparison indicates that dna methylation change is occurring at a possible regulatory region .
figure 5 dlx5 gene body methylation is restricted to the 3 ' end dlx5 had the highest number of associated dynamic cpg sites. by plotting dna methylation in first , second and third trimester for each site at this gene , it is clear that dna methylation change is occurring at the 3 ' end of the gene , and not at the promoter region .
encode dnasei track shows that the 3 ' dmr is associated with open chromatin in a subset of human tissues , indicating that change in dna methylation may result in change of accessibility .
relationship between homeobox gene methylation and expression in placenta tissue throughout pregnancy dna methylation changes ( deltabeta ) from first to third trimester were plotted against fold expression change during the same gestation period .
expression changes were measured for 13 genes using real - time pcr .
overall , increasing gestation was associated with a loss of homeobox gene expression , with 11 out of 13 homeobox genes showing lower expression in the third trimester ( fig. 6 ) .
for most genes , loss of expression was not associated with an increase in dna methylation ( fig. 6a and b ) , suggesting that dna methylation is not the primary mechanism of regulating expression of these genes .
only three genes ( tlx1 , hoxa10 and dlx5 ) showed a reciprocal gain of methylation with decreasing expression over time ( fig. 6a ) suggesting a role for dna methylation in gene regulation .
interestingly , for each of tlx1 , hoxa10 and dlx5 , methylation increased progressively over gestation , with second trimester showing an intermediate level of methylation to that of first and third trimester villi ( fig. 6c ) .
in order to confirm that the dna methylation changes observed at the hm27 cpg probes were representative of the surrounding region , we used published hm450 array data on 5 first and 10 third trimester placentas , from an unrelated cohort ( gse49343 ) 39 .
we show that the hoxa10 differential probe is in a dmr with 5 cpg sites showing increased methylation over gestation ( figure s3 ) .
the dlx5 probes are in a large dmr containing 12 differential cpg probes ( figure s4 ) and the tlx1 probes are in a region containing 4 differential cpg probes ( figure s5 ) .
the change in expression of dlx5 , tlx1 and hoxa10 across gestation was investigated by quantitative rt - pcr on first , second and third trimester placental villi ( fig. 6d ) .
these analyses showed a significant decrease in expression of all three genes in second trimester and third trimester placentae compared with first trimester placental tissues ( fig. 6d ) .

eleven out of 13 genes showed lower expression in third trimester compared to first ( clustering left of centre ) .
only 3 genes - dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 showed a concomitant increase in methylation ( clustering in top left corner ) .
( b ) shows the magnified view of the boxed area in panel a. dna methylation data points represent n = 18 first trimester and n = 10 third trimester samples , while gene expression data points represent n = 5 first trimester and n = 2 third trimester samples .

the second trimester shows an intermediate level of methylation change compared to third trimester , which indicates that dna methylation is changing progressively over gestation .
the change in methylation at second or third trimester is based on the difference between the mean methylation of these time - points relative to the first trimester time - point ( delta beta ) .
( d ) quantitative rt - pcr confirms the reduction in tlx1 , hoxa10 and dlx5 expression during gestation .
n = 12 first trimester , n = 4 second trimester , and n = 6 third trimester , data are presented as relative expression change ( mean +/ - sd ) .
dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 are localised in the nuclei of the syncytiotrophoblast of the first - trimester and term placentae the dna methylation and gene expression data suggest a progressive silencing of dlx5 , tlx1 and hoxa10 expression in placental villi during gestation .
we therefore sought to determine the specific cell compartments to which these proteins are localised .
figure 7a demonstrates that dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 protein was localised primarily to the nuclei of syncytiotrophoblast in both first - trimester ( panel a - c ) and term placental tissues ( panel d - f ) .
weaker expression of these genes was also detected in the villous stroma .
non - immune rabbit igg was used as a negative control ( panel g ) and ck7 was used as a positive control ( panel h ) .
figure 7i shows the quantitative analysis of the staining intensity for dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 .
the staining intensity was significantly decreased in term placental tissues ( n = 5 ) for all three candidate proteins compared with first - trimester placentae ( n = 5 ) .

dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 are expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer ( black arrows ) of first trimester ( a - c ) and third trimester ( d - f ) placentae .

( i ) dot plot shows immunoreactive signal pixel density for dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 in first and third trimester villi .
intensity for all three candidate proteins was significantly lower in the third trimester .
the intensity of staining was calculated using an axiovision software ( carl zeiss ks 400 , germany ) from five fields of view of each placental section and the results were expressed as the mean pixel density ( in arbitrary units ) .

functional role of dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 in primary term trophoblasts figure 8 demonstrates the functional role of dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 in trophoblast proliferation , differentiation and apoptosis following treatment of cultured trophoblasts with specific sirnas .
gene specific sirna treatment of trophoblasts significantly decreased dlx5 ( fig. 8a ) , hoxa10 ( fig. 8d ) and tlx1 ( fig. 8g ) relative to 18s rrna compared with sicont ( scrambled control ) treated cells ( n = 4 independent experiments , p < 0.05 ) .
functional analyses of trophoblasts demonstrated a reduction in cellular proliferation following treatment with sidlx5 ( fig. 8b ) , or sihoxa10 ( fig. 8e ) , or sitlx1 ( fig. 8h ) compared with sicont treated trophoblasts ( n = 4 independent experiments , p < 0.05 ) .
furthermore , cgb , erw - 1 ( syncytin - 1 ) and tp53 mrna were also significantly increased following treatment with sidlx5 ( fig. 8c ) , or sihoxa10 ( fig. 8f ) , or sitlx1 ( fig. 8i ) compared with sicont treated trophoblasts suggesting that markers of trophoblast differentiation and apoptosis are direct or indirect targets of dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 .
figure 8 reduction of dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 expression in trophoblasts using sirna leads to lower proliferation and higher expression of differentiation markers sirna specific for dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 were used to knock - down their expression in primary trophoblasts .
expression of dlx5 ( a ) , hoxa10 ( d ) and tlx1 ( g ) were reduced by the sirna .
in each case , trophoblast proliferation was reduced ( panels b , e , and h ) .
reduction in dlx5 , hoxa10 or tlx1 , resulted in increased expression of trophoblast differentiation markers - cgb , ervw - 1 and tp53 ( panels c , f , and i ) .
for panels b , e and h , @ 495 nm = absorbance at 495 nm. discussion in this study , we report differential methylation of homeobox genes in the human placenta across gestation .
interestingly , our data reveal that the majority of homeobox gene promoters are hypo - methylated during the first trimester and remain so throughout gestation ( figs 1 to 4 and s1 ) .
this indicates that many homeobox gene promoters remain open , allowing the induction of these genes in the placenta at all stages of pregnancy .
this may be important , as throughout gestation the placenta must maintain its fundamental roles of active nutrient transport between the maternal and fetal circulations , protecting the fetus from maternal immune rejection , and producing and secreting hormones and growth factors .
homeobox genes have been implicated in regulating these processes .
nevertheless , expression analysis shows that all but two genes have loss of expression over gestation , indicating that expression of homeobox genes peaks in the first trimester ( fig. 6 ) .
we previously showed wide - spread changes in genome - wide promoter methylation in the human placenta over gestation34 .
overall promoter methylation alone was predictive of gestational age , and several hundred promoters showed significant dna methylation changes between first and third trimester .
a general increase in promoter methylation was observed , suggesting that early gestation is associated with a higher capacity for gene induction .
in this study , we sought to investigate the role of dna methylation in controlling homeobox gene expression in the placenta throughout gestation .
several homeobox genes became increasingly methylated during gestation , with one or more hm27 probes showing differential methylation .
we chose to further explore the role of three genes , dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 , in placental function , based on significant change in dna methylation at these genes ( table s1 ) , and an inverse correlation between dna methylation and level of expression over gestation .
the largest dmr was found within the gene body of the homeobox gene dlx5 ( distal - less homeobox 5 ) , with 5 cpg sites within the region showing progressively higher expression in 2nd and 3rd trimesters compared to first trimester villi ( fig. 5 ) .
this change in methylation correlated with decreased dlx5 transcription ( fig. 6a ) .
the specific role of dlx5 in the human placenta , and the purpose of increased dlx5 methylation during gestation are not yet known .
in a recent study of known and putative imprinted genes in the human placenta , the transcription factor dlx5 was one of 10 genes that could discern between newborn neurobehavioural profiles deduced from the network neurobehavioural scales40 .
these data suggested that control of dlx5 expression in the placenta by methylation may be important for neurobehavioural development .
although the relationship between gene body dna methylation and gene expression control is not always easy to deduce , it is becoming increasingly clear from numerous sources that many gene enhancer elements in the introns of genes can interact with promoters to regulate gene transcription .
based on publically available encode dnasei tracks , we show that the 1.7 kb region with increased dna methylation within the dlx5 gene is associated with open chromatin .
therefore , dlx5 gene body methylation may be located at a regulatory element of the gene , which requires further investigation ( fig. 5 ) .
another potential role for dlx5 methylation may be in regulating stem cell function .
the murine homologue , dlx5 , plays a crucial role in the commitment of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) into osteoblasts and adipocytes41 .
in the human placenta , we showed that dlx5 is localised to nuclei of cells within the predicted vascular niche of chorionic mesenchymal stem / stromal cells ( cmsc ) .
furthermore , dlx5 nuclear expression was also detected in cultured first trimester cmsc , and there was a qualitative decrease in dlx5 expression in cultured , term cmsc .
cultured cmsc are capable of differentiating into the mesenchymal lineages including osteoblasts and adipocytes27 .
in a recent study , evidence was provided that dlx5 is a regulator of human bone marrow msc osteogenic differentiation and that dlx5 expression was not associated with a change in dna methylation level .
the authors concluded that the low to partial level of methylation at the cpg island is consistent with the ability of the gene to be induced42 .
due to the approach used , the authors of that study were only able to interrogate a region of 150 bp , while the distribution of the probes on the hm27 platform allowed us to identify that the dmr is about 1.7 kb in length .
at the 5 ' end of the cpg island the methylation level was indeed low and showed only a slight increase in methylation , while at the 3 ' end , the methylation change was higher .
two other genes - hoxa10 and tlx1 also showed a significant decrease in rna expression in second trimester and third trimester placentae compared with first trimester placentae ( fig. 6c ) , accompanied by higher dna methylation ( fig. 6d ) .
the concordant change in dna methylation and gene expression indicated that these genes are regulated during gestation , and may have roles in placental development and function .
next , we determined that within the placental villi , dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 protein were localised primarily to the nuclei of syncytiotrophoblast , as well as in stromal cells of both first - trimester and term placentae .
nuclear localisation was consistent with dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 acting as nuclear transcription factors ( fig. 7 ) .
furthermore , a decrease in the staining intensity for dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 protein was observed using immunohistochemical analysis of term placental tissues compared with first trimester placentae ( fig. 7i ) .
this data , were consistent with the decreased mrna expression and associated increased dna methylation across gestation for the candidate genes ( fig. 6c and d ) .
the localisation of these genes to the syncytiotrophoblast later suggests that their decreased expression influences the function of the syncytiotrophoblast , or in the differentiation of trophoblasts. by using sirnas specific for dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 , we showed that down - regulation of these genes in primary trophoblasts leads to loss of proliferation , and an increase in mrna expression of differentiation markers , such as ervw - 1 ( fig. 8 ) .
this suggests that loss of these proteins is required for proper syncytiotrophoblast development during gestation .
interestingly , loss of these genes at the second trimester stage onwards , correlates well with the reported increase in ervw - 1 expression in the second and third trimester , relative to early pregnancy43 .
in conclusion , our studies demonstrated that the homeobox gene methylation and their transcription are important for normal placental development .
furthermore , it is important to determine whether the increased dlx5 , tlx1 or hoxa10 methylation and decreased transcription observed during normal placentation are altered in placental pathologies .

the assay mix consisted of unlabelled pcr primers and a taqman fam - labelled mgb probes for dlx5 ( hs01573641 _ mh ) ; hoxa10 ( hs00172012 _ m1 ) ; tlx1 ( hs00271457 _ m1 ) ; cgb ( hs01668436 _ g1 ) ; syncytin - 1 / ervw - 1 ( hs01926764 _ u1 ) and tp53 ( hs01034249 _ m1 ) , ( thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) .
gene expression relative to 18s rrna ( 4319413e , vic / mgb probe , primer limited , thermo fisher scientific , waltham , ma , usa ) was calculated according to the 2 - deltadeltact method47 .
in total n = 5 first trimester , n = 3 second trimester and n = 2 third trimester samples were profiled for gene expression of a panel of genes .
additionally , dlx5 , hoxa10 and tlx1 expression were confirmed in additional n = 12 first , n = 4 second and n = 4 third trimester samples .
immunohistochemistry sections ( 5 microm ) of wax - embedded placenta were deparaffinised in histoclear and alcohol and microwaved at full power for 10 min in sodium citrate buffer ( 0.01 m ; containing 0.05 % ( v / v ) tween 20 , ph 6.0 ) to facilitate antigen unmasking .
after cooling for 20 min , sections were washed in distilled water and endogenous peroxide activity was quenched by incubation with 3 % ( v / v ) hydrogen peroxide at room temperature for 10 min .
tissue sections were washed ( 3 x 5 min ) in 0.05 m tris buffered saline ( tbs ) and blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) bsa in tbs for 30 min .
primary antibodies , diluted to the required concentration with 5 % ( w / v ) bsa solution [ rabbit polyclonal dlx5 epr4488 antibody 1:500 , hoxa10 ab191470 antibody , 1:750 and tlx1 ab78498 antibody ( abcam , cambridge , uk ) ; mouse monoclonal cytokeratin - 7 antibody 1:100 ( dako , glostrup , denmark ) and control rabbit igg ( concentration matched , sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo , usa )] were applied to the tissue sections , which were incubated overnight at 4 degreesc in a humidity chamber .
slides were washed in tbs ( 3 x 5 min ) and the secondary antibodies , diluted in tbs ( biotinylated rabbit anti - goat igg 1:500 ; biotinylated goat anti - mouse igg 1:200 , dako , glostrup , denmark ) , were applied for 30 min at room temperature .
slides were washed again ( tbs ; 3 x 5 min ) and incubated with avidin peroxidase ( 5 mug / ml ; sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo , usa ) for 30 min at room temperature .
after further tbs washes ( 3 x 5 min ) , tissue sections were incubated with 0.05 % ( w / v ) 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine ( dab ) and 0.015 % ( v / v ) hydrogen peroxide ( sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo , usa ) and colour development was monitored under a light microscope .
slides were washed in distilled water , counterstained with hematoxylin , rehydrated in alcohol and histoclear , and mounted in dpx ( sigma - aldrich , st louis , mo , usa ) for imaging with a leitz dialux22 light microscope ( stuggart , germany ) .
all tissue sections were incubated with dab for the same length of time so that comparisons could be made between individual samples , and all slides were stained in a single run to eliminate inter - experimental variations in staining intensity .
exposure times and background colour were matched at image capture .
the intensity of staining was calculated using the axiovision software ( carl zeiss , oberkochen , germany ) from five fields of view of each placental section and the results are expressed as the mean pixel density ( in arbitrary units ) .
villous cytotrophoblast isolation , culture and sirna treatment villous cytotrophoblasts ( vcts ) were prepared from placentae obtained from uncomplicated term pregnancies as described previously31 .
briefly , vcts were enriched by differential sequential trypsin digestion and the use of a percoll gradient ( 20 - 60 %) .
vcts were plated at a density of 1.0 x 104 cells / cm2 in 6 - well tissue culture plates using dmem supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , 2 mm glutamine , 100 microg / ml streptomycin , 100 iu / ml penicillin .
the purity of vct cultures was characterised by positive staining for ck7 ( 95 % positive cells ) and by microscopic observation of cell aggregates and syncytiotrophoblast formation at 48 to 72 hours .
vct were seeded at a density of 0.5 x 105 cells / well in 24 - well plates and transfected with thermo fisher scientific ( waltham , ma , usa ) dlx5 sirna ( sidlx5 ) or hoxa10 sirna ( sihoxa10 ) or tlx1 sirna ( sitlx1 ) , using the hiperfect transfection reagent ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) .
the optimum sirna : hiperfect ratio and incubation time for the culture was determined to be 1:6 and 72 h , respectively ( data not shown ) .
negative control sirna ( sicont ) used in these experiments consisted of an enzyme - generated pool of oligonucleotides ( 15 - 19 base pairs ) that showed no dna sequence similarity to any known human gene ( allstars neg. sirna af 488 , qiagen , hilden , germany ) 31 .
at the end of the incubation , the cells were collected for analysis of gene expression for dlx5 , hoxa10 , tlx1 , and trophoblast differentiation markers cgb , ervw - 1 and apoptosis marker , tp53 .
cell proliferation assay vcts were grown in 96 - well plate ( 2 x 104 cells / well , corning ) for 24 h. following sidlx5 / sihoxa10 / sitlx1 or sicont treatment of trophoblasts , the proliferation potential of cells was determined using the celltiter 96 ( r ) aqueous one solution cell proliferation assay ( promega corporation , madison , wi , usa ) and the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using an elisa plate reader ( spectramax i3 ) .
statistical analyses a p - value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
the limma package was used for hm27 dna methylation analysis , and probes were considered significant based on an adjusted p - value ( benjamini correction ) .

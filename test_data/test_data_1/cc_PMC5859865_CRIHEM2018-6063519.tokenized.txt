background epstein - barr virus - ( ebv - ) associated lymphoproliferative disease ( lpd ) is a rare condition , usually occurring in immunocompromised patients .
we report a case of ebv - associated lpd in a patient with severe celiac disease , the first report to describe this syndrome in a patient with this diagnosis .
case summary a 69 - year - old caucasian woman with recent diagnosis of celiac sprue presented to our hospital with persistent diarrhea , abdominal pain , weight loss , and fatigue despite adherence to gluten - free diet for a number of weeks prior to presentation .
she underwent evaluation for occult malignancy and was found to have diffuse intra - abdominal mesenteric lymphadenopathy on ct scan .
biopsy of mesenteric nodes revealed an ebv positive , cd20 positive mixed lymphoproliferative process with t - cell predominance , but without a monoclonal cell population felt to be consistent with ebv - associated lpd .
bone marrow biopsy revealed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis , complicating her course .
she was treated with steroids and rituximab but continued to decline , eventually developing mssa bacteremia and succumbing to her disease .
conclusion to our knowledge , this is the first report of the constellation of celiac sprue , ebv - associated lpd , and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis .
providers caring for patients with severe , uncontrolled celiac disease and adenopathy should consider ebv - associated lpd .
1. introduction epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , also called human herpes virus 4 ( hhv - 4 ) , is one of the eight known human herpes viruses [ 1 ] .
it was discovered in 1964 by electron microscopy of african burkitt lymphoma cells [ 2 ] .
antibodies to ebv have been demonstrated in all population groups worldwide ; approximately 90 percent of adults worldwide are ebv - seropositive [ 3 ] .
the majority of ebv infections are subclinical [ 3 ] .
infectious mononucleosis is the most common clinical manifestation of ebv infection [ 4 ] .
epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of b - cell lymphomas , t - cell lymphomas , hodgkin lymphoma , and nasopharyngeal carcinomas and has associated with the development of ebv - associated lymphoproliferative disorders ( lpd ) as well .
ebv - associated lpd occur in a spectrum , ranging from polyclonal b - cell proliferation to clonal , malignant b - cell lymphoma and most commonly occur in immunocompromised patients , especially in posttransplant and hiv - positive patients .
[ 3 , 5 , 6 ] ebv - associated lpd are increasingly being recognized in the elderly population as well , likely due to age - related immunosenescence [ 7 ] .
however , the constellation of celiac sprue , ebv - associated lpd , and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is unique in the literature .
2. case report a 69 - year - old caucasian female with recently diagnosed celiac sprue presented with fever , nausea , abdominal pain , diarrhea , and weight loss despite adherence to a gluten - free diet .
past medical history included hypothyroidism , hypertension , and atrial fibrillation .
she initially presented to an outside facility several months prior to presentation to our facility where she had a small bowel biopsy showing villous blunting consistent with celiac sprue as well as positive autoantibodies for gliadin and tissue transglutaminase .
she was started on a gluten - free diet and discharged .
despite adhering to the gluten - free diet , she lost approximately 15 pounds over the month prior to presentation at our facility .
given persistent symptoms , she was admitted to our institution , where initial blood work noted pancytopenia , elevated serum ferritin , elevated serum triglycerides , and low serum fibrinogen , raising clinical concern for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( hlh ) .
computed tomography ( ct ) of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis noted extensive lymphadenopathy throughout the abdomen with the largest nodes including a 2.9 cm mesenteric node in the left abdomen , a 2.4 cm node near the left iliac crest , and a 3.4 cm mass adjacent to the cecum .
a needle biopsy of an intra - abdominal lymph node demonstrated a lymphoproliferative process , with a predominance of cd4 - positive t - lymphocytes .
following needle biopsy , an excisional biopsy was obtained revealing a polymorphic - type ebv - positive lymphoproliferation with extensive paracortical t - cell hyperplasia .
the paracortical expansion was comprised of predominantly cd4 - positive polymorphic t cells that stained positively for cd2 , cd3 , and cd5 , with partial loss of cd7 ( figure 1 ( a )) .
a monotonous population of cd20 - positive b cells was also identified that coexpress mum - 1 and was positive for eber ( epstein - barr virus encoded messenger rna ) ( figures 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c )) .
t - cell receptor gene rearrangement studies by pcr were not performed ; however , gene rearrangement studies for tcr - gamma / delta and tcr - betaf1 by immunohistochemistry were performed .
tcr - betaf1 was positive in the polymorphic t - cell population within the paracortical expansion .
tcr - gamma / delta stained a small subset of t cells .
the final diagnosis was a cd20 - positive , ebv - positive lymphoproliferative disorder , which did not meet criteria for frank lymphoma and was not monoclonal in nature .
following the diagnosis of ebv - associated lpd , peripheral blood ebv dna quantitation via pcr was markedly positive at 9367 copies / ml (< 200 copies / ml ) ; to our knowledge , the patient 's ebv status was unknown until this point .
subsequent bone marrow biopsy was performed to further evaluate her pancytopenia .
this revealed marked hemophagocytic changes consistent with hlh ( figure 1 ( d )) .
she was started on a course of rituximab and methylprednisolone for ebv - associated lpd with hlh .
she subsequently developed methicillin - sensitive staphylococcus aureus ( mssa ) bacteremia , further worsening her clinical status .
following development of bacteremia , the patient and her family decided to pursue comfort care , and she succumbed while receiving comfort cares 25 days after initial presentation to our hospital .
3. discussion we describe a case of ebv - associated lpd , a rare disorder which typically occurs in immunocompromised patients and has been most commonly described in posttransplant and hiv - positive patients .
to our knowledge , this is the first case report to describe ebv - associated lpd disorder associated with celiac disease .
celiac disease has been associated with many different subtypes of lymphoma [ 8 , 9 ] , although lymphoma remains an uncommon complication in this population .
enteropathy - associated t - cell lymphoma ( eatl ) is a distinct lymphoma subtype highly associated with celiac disease , although b - cell lymphoma in association with celiac disease has also been described [ 10 ] .
patients with celiac - associated b cell lymphoma may have a better prognosis than those with eatl [ 11 ] .
to our knowledge , ebv - associated lpd has not been described in a patient with celiac disease , although ebv has been implicated in some cases of eatl [ 10 ] and active ebv has been detected in small bowel biopsies in up to 70 % of patients with refractory celiac disease [ 12 ] .
in this case , the strength of the link between the diagnosis of celiac disease and the ebv - associated lpd is somewhat difficult to discern , as the patient also had multiple other factors potentially causing relative immunosuppression including malnutrition secondary to celiac disease as well as age - related immunosenescence , but this case should alert clinicians to the possibility of ebv - associated lpd when presented with a patient with celiac disease and associated adenopathy concerning for lymphoma .
in patients with early , nonclonal ebv - associated lpd on immunosuppression either following solid organ transplant or due to a chronic autoimmune condition , modulation of immunosuppression is the initial management recommendation .
modulation of immunosuppressive therapy induces tumor regression in 25 % - 50 % of patients [ 13 - 15 ] .
in patients with a polyclonal ebv - associated lpd , rituximab is often added to modulation of immunosuppression [ 16 , 17 ] , as rituximab is generally well tolerated and rapidly depletes mature b - lymphocytes , the major reservoir of ebv [ 18 ] .
in patients with monoclonal ebv - associated lpd or disease refractory to rituximab and modulation of immunosuppression , rituximab is typically combined with chemotherapy directed at the particular lymphoma subtype described [ 17 ] .
in this case , given her frail state at diagnosis and patient hesitance regarding more aggressive therapy , treatment with rituximab was combined with high dose steroids as opposed to multiagent chemotherapy .
unfortunately , the patient developed a significant infectious complication and succumbed to her disease prior to an opportunity to assess her response to the above therapy .
another confounding feature of this case is the concurrent diagnosis of hlh .
hlh has been well described in concert with both b - cell lymphomas [ 19 ] and ebv infection [ 20 ] as a trigger for hlh .
our patient met 5 / 8 of the diagnostic criteria for hlh ( fever , pancytopenia , hypertriglyceridemia , elevated serum ferritin , and hemophagocytosis on histopathological examination of bone marrow ) [ 21 ] .
serum soluble il2 receptor level was not checked as our patient already met the diagnostic criteria for hlh .
the treatment regimen of hlh is chemoimmunotherapy based with the most commonly used regimen being etoposide , cyclosporin a , and dexamethasone [ 22 ] .
rituximab is also commonly utilized in the treatment of ebv - associated hlh [ 21 ] .
in conclusion , we represent a case of ebv - associated lpd occurring in a patient with refractory celiac disease complicated by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis .
this case demonstrates the difficulty in diagnosis and management of ebv - associated lpd and will hopefully lead to increased awareness of this possible diagnosis amongst clinicians treating patients with refractory celiac disease .

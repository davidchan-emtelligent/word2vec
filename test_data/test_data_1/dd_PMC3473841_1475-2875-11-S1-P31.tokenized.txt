some serve as important aquatic habitats with rich biodiversity while others are constructed to extract potable water and for agriculture in water sparse dry zone .
these restrictions call for alternative control measures .
a study explored the presence of malaria larvae and possible use of an indigenous fish species as a part of an on - going attempt for alternative malaria control methods .
materials and methods three types of potential mosquito breeding habitats ; abandoned clay pits and quarry pits from wet ( rain fall ( rf ) > 2500mm ) and intermediate ( rf = 1750 - 2500mm ) zones and agricultural wells in dry zone ( rf < 1750mm ) were mapped and were processed with mapsource ( r ) software .
anophiline larvae in clay pits ( n = 41 ) and quarry pits ( n = 39 ) were sampled taking six dips at each point at 10m intervals of the perimeter using a standard 350 ml dipper .
in agricultural wells ( n = 43 in wagollakada and n = 89 in rathmale regions of dry zone ) , were sampled with a 2l dipper at four points .
third and fourth instars of larvae were identified to the species level and percentage occurrence of larvae and larval density were calculated .
simultaneously , aplocheilus parvus , a common surface dwelling predatory indigenous fish species available in both lotic and lentic systems in all zones of sri lanka , was collected every 2 hours for 24 hours to determine its preference for mosquito larvae .
results the results indicated that 62 % of clay pits and 76 % of quarry pits were positive for anopheline larvae while 31 % and 37 % of agricultural wells contained anopheline larvae in rathmale and wagollakada respectively .
malaria vector an. culicifacies was present in 3 % of clay pits at a density of 0.001 larvae / dip and 24 % of quarry pits at the density of 0.027 larvae / dip .
among agricultural wells , 11 % was positive for an. culicifacies in rathmale at 0.097 larvae / dip whereas 11.63 % wells in wagollakada had a density of 0.106 larvae / dip .
moreover , potential malaria vectors an. varuna , an. vagus and an. jamesii were also recorded from all three types of habitats .
agricultural wells in rathmale were also the habitat for culicines at 0.899 larvae / dip including vector of japanese encephalitis culex tritaeniorhynchus .
according to the diet composition analysis , a. parvus diet mainly consisted of adult or larval stages of class insecta ( coleoptera , hymenoptera and other unidentified insect parts and insect larvae ) and class maxillopoda ( copepoda ) .
a time sex interaction explained the gut fullness with males having a peak gut fullness during 1630 hours whilst females had the peak gut fullness at 1230 hours ( p < 0.001 ) .
results suggested that insect parts and coleopterans were the dominant food items present in all time periods ( p < 0.001 ) .
conclusions the need for alternative malaria control measures is highlighted .
currently a. parvus and guppy ( poecilia reticulata ) are being experimentally introduced to above habitats and larval densities are being monitored whist the sensitivity of a. parvus to commonly used agricultural chemicals are being tested .
acknowledgements global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria ( gfatm ) is acknowledged for the financial support .
communities living in wagollakada and rathmale are acknowledged for permission to work in their wells .

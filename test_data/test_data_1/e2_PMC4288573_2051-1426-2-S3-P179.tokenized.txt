medi4736 has single - agent activity and potential for further increased activity in combination .
a comprehensive development programme is underway in nsclc , as monotherapy and in combination .
methods nsclc data from 2 multicentre , open - label phase i studies are reported .
nct01693562 evaluates safety and efficacy of medi4736 administered every 2 or 3 weeks .
nct02000947 evaluates safety and efficacy of medi4736 in combination with tremelimumab , a human igg2 anti - ctla - 4 mab , at 4 - week intervals .
results nct01693562 : as of may 2014 , nsclc cohort included 155 patients ( pts ) ( median age 65 years [ 33 - 85 ] , ps 0 / 1 / unknown [ 25 %/ 73 %/ 2 %] , median 3 [ 0 - 7 ] prior treatments ) .
median follow - up : 6 weeks ( range 0 - 67 ) .
treatment - related adverse events ( traes ) : 29 % ( grade [ gr ] >= 3 : 3 %) ; none led to treatment discontinuation .
most frequent traes : fatigue ( 7 %) , nausea ( 5 %) , and vomiting ( 5 %) .
no treatment - related colitis any gr. no treatment - related gr 3 / 4 pneumonitis or dyspnea .
58 pts had >= 12 weeks follow - up : 16 % had partial response ( as early as 6 weeks ) , duration of response ranged 5 - 54 + weeks , disease control rate 35 % .
pd - l1 positivity appears to enrich for response .
nct02000947 : as of april , 2014 , 12 pts treated at 4 dose - levels ( ps 0 - 1 , median 3 [ 2 - 5 ] prior treatments ) .
no dlts observed in any cohort during dlt observation period .
most frequent traes : - ^ amylase , abdominal pain , arthralgia , colitis , diarrhea , epigastric discomfort , fatigue and nausea .
traes >= gr 3 noted in 3 pts : gr 3 - ^ ast / alt & gr 5 myasthenia ( mg ) ( n = 1 ) , gr 3 diarrhea / colitis ( n = 1 ) , gr 4 - ^ amylase ( n = 1 ) .
traes led to discontinuation in two subjects : gr 5 mg and gr3 colitis .
in 12 response - evaluable pts ( figure 1 ) , tumor shrinkage at 8 weeks : 0 / 3 pts cohort 1a ; 6 / 9 pts cohorts 2a and 3a / b ; disease control : 7 / 12 pts .
dose - escalation ongoing ; total of 6 dose - levels , including cohort 5a ( medi4736 / treme : 15 / 10 mg / kg ) , has been cleared since cut - off .
figure 1 red : cohort1a ( medi4735 / treme : 3 / 1 ) ; green : cohort 2a ( medi4736 / treme 10 / 1 ) ; gold : cohort 3a ( medi4736 / treme 15 / 1 ) ; blue : cohort 3b ( medi4736 / treme 10 / 3 ) .
conclusions current safety profile and encouraging early antitumor activity ( monotherapy and combination ) support continued development in nsclc .
additional monotherapy nsclc studies : phase ii ' atlantic ' ( nct02087423 ) , phase iii ' pacific ' following chemo - radiotherapy ( nct02125461 ) , combination : phase i + gefitinib ( nct02088112 ) , and phase ib + azd9291 ( nct02143466 ) .
monotherapy and combination : phase iii ' arctic ' vs standard - of - care .

typical areas , where this is needed are analysis and enhancement of company compound archive , analysis of high - throughput screening data , design of combinatorial libraries , chemogenomics analyses and many others .
but also researchers in academia are facing similar challenges when analyzing large public molecular databases that become available recently or even structures generated in silico .
this presentation will provide overview of various methods used to analyze and visualize chemical space with particular focus on needs of medicinal chemists .
when displaying results , for chemists it is of great importance that the molecules are represented by their actual structures , or at least by their scaffolds and not only by points as it is common in other scientific fields .
this particular requirement makes chemistry visualizations challenging because of necessity to squeeze a lot of information on rather limited computer screen real estate .
in the presentation various chemistry visualization techniques will be discussed , starting from classical display of molecules as tables and grids , through visualization based on analysis of scaffold , up to advanced cheminformatics visualizations techniques recently developed at novartis , such as a method for natural ordering or scaffolds or molecule cloud diagrams .

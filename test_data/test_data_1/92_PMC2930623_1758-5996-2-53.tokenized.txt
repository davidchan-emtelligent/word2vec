biological rhythms are present in the lives of almost all organisms ranging from plants to more evolved creatures .
these oscillations allow the anticipation of many physiological and behavioral mechanisms thus enabling coordination of rhythms in a timely manner , adaption to environmental changes and more efficient organization of the cellular processes responsible for survival of both the individual and the species .
many components of energy homeostasis exhibit circadian rhythms , which are regulated by central ( suprachiasmatic nucleus ) and peripheral ( located in other tissues ) circadian clocks .
adipocyte plays an important role in the regulation of energy homeostasis , the signaling of satiety and cellular differentiation and proliferation .
also , the adipocyte circadian clock is probably involved in the control of many of these functions .
thus , circadian clocks are implicated in the control of energy balance , feeding behavior and consequently in the regulation of body weight .
in this regard , alterations in clock genes and rhythms can interfere with the complex mechanism of metabolic and hormonal anticipation , contributing to multifactorial diseases such as obesity and diabetes .
the aim of this review was to define circadian clocks by describing their functioning and role in the whole body and in adipocyte metabolism , as well as their influence on body weight control and the development of obesity .
introduction the prevalence of obesity is growing rapidly , affecting all ages and social classes , despite all scientific efforts to clarify its causes .
excess body weight has become one of the biggest health issues today , and is principally due to increased food availability , high caloric diets and sedentary lifestyles .
recent studies have shown the importance of new discoveries regarding the intracellular mechanisms which can trigger obesity and other metabolic disturbances .
some studies have suggested that altered patterns of sleep / wake cycle and feeding behavior were associated to 24 - hour lifestyles and changes in body weight although the mechanisms by which daily rhythms are transformed into increased adiposity remain unclear [ 1,2 ] .
circadian rhythms are biological events that constantly repeat in a 24 - hour period and are generated by an endogenous mechanism .
this endogenous mechanism is composed of circadian clocks , including the central clock ( located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus - scn ) and peripheral clocks ( located in all other cells of the organism ) , and is defined as the intrinsic molecular mechanisms that allow the organism to adapt to changes in its environment [ 3 ] .
the clocks are synchronized or adjusted to coincide with periodical environmental events such as the day / night cycle .
a well - synchronized clock guarantees that all physiological and behavioral rhythms take place in a coordinated manner over the 24 - hour period [ 4 ] .
many researchers are investigating the function of the circadian clocks in circadian physiology regulation .
hence , the knowledge regarding the role of peripheral circadian clocks in glucose and lipids metabolism is starting to emerge .
the adipocyte has an important role in endocrine system regulations , energy homeostasis , satiety signaling and in cell differentiation and proliferation .
the circadian clock of the adipose cell is also probably involved in the control of many of these functions .
it is reasonable to deduce that alterations in the peripheral circadian clock of adipose tissue can induce the onset of obesity or intensify its causes and consequences , for example , by generating modifications in adipose tissue metabolism or acting on hunger / satiety and energy balance regulation .
the aim of this review was to define the circadian clocks by describing their functioning , their role in the whole body , in adipocyte metabolism , as well as their influence on body weight control and the development of obesity .
circadian clocks it is well known that the life of plants , animals and humans seems to be adapted to their respective environment and that each species' survival depends on the capacity of the organism to adapt in response to periodical changes .
biological rhythms have emerged in an attempt to facilitate evolution by enabling the anticipation of many regulatory , physiological and behavioral mechanisms that improve the chances of survival of both the individual and the species .
in other words , due to the physiological anticipation of the stimuli of the environment , the reactions of the organism occur at the right time of day .
alterations in the natural synchrony between cycles of day / night , activity / rest , and hormonal or feeding behavior etc .
can induce modifications in this highly complex mechanism of metabolic and hormonal anticipation .
the control of circadian rhythm expression involves regulation at the cellular level through the clock genes [ 3,5 ] .
the clock genes codify a family of proteins that generate an auto - regulatory mechanism of positive and negative transcriptional feedback loops which occur on a 24 - hour basis [ 3 ] .
in mammals , the clock mechanism is composed of at least 9 main proteins : clock ( circadian locomotor output cycles kaput ) , bmal1 ( brain and muscle arnt - like protein 1 ) , per1 ( period 1 ) , per2 ( period 2 ) , per3 ( period 3 ) , cry1 ( cryptochrome 1 ) , cry2 ( cryptochrome 2 ) , reverbalpha ( reverse erythroblastosis virus alpha ) and roralpha ( retinoid - related orphan receptor - alpha ) .
many of these proteins act as transcriptional factors , since they have pas ( per - arnt - sim ; involved in protein - protein interactions ) and bhlh ( basic helix - loop - helix ; involved in protein - dna interaction ) domains. with these characteristics , the proteins comprising the clock work together activating and inhibiting their own transcription .
clock and bmal1 form a heterodimer that binds to e - box on the promoter of other clock genes , such as per1 , per2 , per3 , cry1 , cry2 , reverbalpha , roralpha and many output genes that are controlled by the clock ( ccgs : clock - controlled genes ) .
the heterodimer clock / bmal1 also stimulates bmal1 transcription , generating a positive feedback loop .
conversely , a negative feedback loop of the clock takes place through the heterodimerization of cry and per .
the heterodimer cry / per translocates to the nucleus and inhibits the transcriptional activity of the clock / bmal1 heterodimer [ 6,7 ] .
nuclear receptors reverbalpha and roralpha participate in the regulation of bmal1 expression , inhibiting or activating the transcription , respectively [ 8 ] ( figure 1 ) .
figure 1 molecular machinery of the circadian clock .
the core clock components clock and bmal1 heterodimerize in the cytoplasm , forming a protein complex .
the heterodimer is then translocated to the nucleus and binds to e - boxes on the promoter of target genes , controlling their expression .
these genes include per1 , per2 , per3 , cry1 , cry2 , reverbalpha , roralpha and many clock - controlled genes ( ccgs ) .
clock / bmal1 heterodimer also stimulates transcription of bmal1 itself , forming the positive feedback loop of the mechanism .
negative feedback loop is mainly regulated by cry and per , that heterodimerize in the cytoplasm , translocate to the nucleus and inhibits clock / bmal1 transcription activity .
gene expression of bmal1 is also regulated by reverbalpha ( inhibition ) and roralpha ( stimulation ) , that compete for the same ror elements present in the bmal1 promoter .
regulation of ccgs expression by the circadian clock confers rhythmicity to a variety of molecular and physiological processes .
straight lines : stimulation .
dashed lines : inhibition .
the circadian clock components show distinct characteristics and actions on the clock 's functioning .
thus , any alterations that occur in gene expression and / or protein translation may result in impaired functioning of the entire mechanism .
high tissue specificity of the circadian clock also guarantees perfect working of this complex intrinsic mechanism , which is primordial for physiological and behavioral circadian responses to be triggered at the optimum time of day .
the optimization of the organism 's responses at the right time of day directly depends on the synchronization between central and peripheral clocks and with regular cycles of the environment .
zeitgebers ( from the german word , zeit = time ; geber = give ) or synchronizers are the factors responsible for synchronizing the circadian clocks .
sun light determines the precise length of day and night in the 24 - hour period , accurately orienting the subject in relation to the point of day .
as a consequence , light is one of the most powerful synchronizers of the circadian rhythms .
environmental light is the zeitgeber for the central circadian clock , being transmitted to the scn through a neuronal pathway that starts at the retina [ 9 ] .
the zeitgebers of the peripheral clocks are neuro - humoral factors , some of which have previously been described as glucocorticoids , and in food restriction and melatonin [ 9 - 11 ] .
melatonin is one of the most important neuro - humoral zeitgebers for the synchronization of the internal system , since it is a hormone produced and secreted only during the night by the pineal gland , which receives retino - hypothalamic neural signals that carry information about the day / night environmental cycle .
moreover , it has been suggested that social rhythms can function as zeitgebers for the internal system [ 12 ] .
however , many critics raise questions over whether these social factors can really affect circadian rhythms independently of those controlled by environmental light .
peripheral clock of adipose tissue many studies have shown the existence of a peripheral circadian clock in adipose tissue [ 13,14 ] .
although research in this area is recent , the peripheral circadian clock of the adipose tissue seems to play a fundamental role in adipose tissue physiology and consequently in glucose and lipid homeostasis .
the importance of new discoveries regarding the peripheral clock of the adipose tissue has been recognized .
some authors have recently developed an in vitro model for studies on circadian biology of human adipose tissue , using differentiated adipocytes derived from stem cells [ 15 ] .
the adipocyte governs essential metabolic functions of the organism , not only working as an energy store but also as an endocrine organ that secrets hormones and cytokines that regulate many metabolic activities .
although circadian variations of adipose tissue metabolism have been shown to be influenced by external neuro - humoral factors [ 13,16 ] , they can also be influenced internally by a peripheral circadian clock that acts on tissue metabolism and can alter adipocyte responsiveness in response to different stimuli during the day ( for example , levels of glucose , insulin , fatty acids , melatonin ) or can alter the capacity of lipolysis and lipogenesis [ 17,18 ] .
many adipocytokines produced in adipose tissue present circadian rhythmicity .
leptin and adiponectin show opposite patterns of circadian secretion : the peak for leptin occurs during the sleep phase of the sleep / wake cycle while adiponectin falls during the night and peaks in secretion during the morning [ 19 - 21 ] .
in addition , it has been demonstrated that plasmatic concentrations of leptin and adiponectin also present secretion patterns of ultradian pulsatility [ 20,22 ] .
ultradian rhythms ( fast repetitive oscillations within 20 - hour periods ) are also a significant part of the organism 's temporal organization , allowing more precise adjustment of cellular and tissue responses at optimal time points for best improvement in cellular functions [ 23 ] .
adipogenesis , adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis also appear to be directly regulated by the circadian clock .
shimba et al .
( 2005 ) demonstrated that adipocyte differentiation is directly regulated by bmal1 [ 24 ] , since embryo fibroblasts from bmal1 knockout mice showed deficiency in the ability to become mature adipocytes , whose deficiency was restored by the transfection of an adenovirus containing the original bmal1 .
additionally , in the same study , when bmal1 was knocked - down in cultured pre - adipocytes , the cells were unable to accumulate intracellular lipids and demonstrated decreased expression of genes related to differentiation , including the c / ebp family of transcriptional factors such as srebp1a and ppargamma2 , proving the importance of the circadian clock in adipocyte physiology .
it was also demonstrated that reverbalpha is a target gene for ppargamma [ 25 ] , and that c / ebpbeta and reverbalpha genes are critical factors for adipocyte differentiation , showing a circadian rhythmic expression in epididymis and subcutaneous adipose tissue in mice [ 26 ] .
besides evidence showing the influence of the circadian clock on cellular proliferation and differentiation processes of adipose tissue , it has been demonstrated that hormonal and metabolic functions in adipose tissue are synchronized in circadian rhythms by the presence of melatonin in circulation [ 18 ] .
melatonin induces alterations in gene expression of the adipocyte clock genes that are translated into different cellular responses .
this means that the role of the circadian clock in adipose tissue is relevant for the functioning of the tissue , modulating adipocyte intracellular responses related to external factors while also influencing overall metabolism .
role of circadian clocks in metabolism it is well known that circadian clocks are involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis since many metabolic factors present circadian variations including enzymes , substrate transporters and hormones .
evidence has demonstrated that biological rhythms and metabolism closely resemble each other .
kennaway et al .
( 2007 ) showed this connection [ 27 ] in a recent study on transgenic mice that presented non - rhythmical expression of clock genes in liver and skeletal muscle .
the mice however , had preserved rhythmicity in the scn and pineal gland .
although these animals did not develop obesity or fatty acid augmentation , they had an increased plasmatic adiponectin , decreased glucose transporter glut4 mrna in skeletal muscle , low glucose tolerance , low insulin levels , and a decrease in gene expression with loss of rhythmicity in enzymes related to hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis .
in humans , the relationship between clock genes and metabolism has been previously demonstrated .
studies involving obese humans for instance , have found that circadian clock gene expression in adipose tissue was related to abdominal fat content and with risk factors for cardiovascular disease , since it was associated to plasmatic ldl levels , total cholesterol and with abdominal circumference [ 28 ] .
the same group studied isolated adipocytes from morbid obese individuals and demonstrated that the circadian clock genes continued oscillating in a 24 hour pattern , independently of the central circadian clock , for at least 48 hours in vitro , and that genes directly related to adipose tissue metabolism such as ppargamma , are controlled by clock genes [ 29 ] .
moreover , it was shown that clock gene expression depends on metabolic conditions , even in healthy subjects with normal body weight [ 30 ] .
it is evident that there is a direct association among rhythms at different levels of metabolism and the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis .
we can conclude that circadian regulation is essential for maintaining metabolism balance in the organism , even though the mechanisms involved in this process are not yet well defined .
concerning molecular mechanisms , components of the circadian clock are linked with metabolic pathways .
the gene expression of bmal1 is negatively regulated by reverbalpha and positively by roralpha ( retinoic acid receptor - related orphan receptor alpha ) , through rore ( ror - response element ) [ 31 ] .
in skeletal muscle , roralpha regulates lipogenesis and lipid storage [ 32 ] whereas reverbalpha is stimulated during adipogenesis [ 33 ]. by contrast , the heterodimer clock / bmal1 regulates the gene expression of reverbalpha , roralpha and ppar ( peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor family , principally alpha and gamma ) [ 34 ] .
pparalpha , which is involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism , participates in the regulation of bmal1 transcription , since it is linked to the gene promoter .
in addition , many other nuclear receptors directly involved in glucose and lipid metabolisms show circadian rhythmicity [ 35 ] , proving the participation of different molecular mechanisms in the relationship between circadian clocks and metabolism ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 molecular mechanisms underlying the association between circadian clock and metabolic pathways .
clock / bmal1 heterodimer activates transcription of genes directly related to metabolism , especially nuclear receptors reverbalpha and roralpha ( members of clock machinery ) and ppar family of transcriptional factors ( clock - controlled genes ; do not participate of clock machinery itself ) .
roralpha and pparalpha activate bmal1 and reverbalpha expressions .
reverbalpha represses bmal1 , roralpha and its own transcription .
ppar family and bmal1 are involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and adipogenesis .
reverbalpha and roralpha are implicated in the regulation of glucose , lipid and lipoprotein metabolism , adipogenesis and lipogenesis .
they can also cross - talk with other important genes of metabolism such as pgc - 1alpha ( ppargamma - coactivator - 1alpha ) .
straight lines : stimulation .
dashed lines : inhibition .
different biological rhythms synchronize physiological processes with daily environmental changes , allowing the organism to anticipate and adapt , generating responses in a rapid and appropriate manner .
a failure in this mechanism of synchronization between rhythms and metabolism can have serious consequences , allowing or inducing metabolic pathologies such as obesity and diabetes .
turek et al .
( 2005 ) have demonstrated that clock knockout mice developed obesity and showed alterations in feeding behavior such as hyperphagia , as well as hormonal abnormalities associated to metabolic syndrome , including hyperlipidemia , hyperleptinemia , hepatic steatosis , hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia [ 36 ] .
bmal1 knockout mice showed weight loss from 10 weeks of age due to a decrease in adipose and muscle tissue mass [ 24 ] .
these animals also showed loss of circadian rhythm and altered metabolic phenotypes , including modified glycemic homeostasis and reduced lifetime [ 24,37 ] .
akin to bmal1 knockout animals , per1 knockout ( per1brd ) mice had reduced body mass compared to wild type animals , despite the same food intake [ 38 ] .
the per1brd mice also had increased diurnal concentrations of glucocorticoids and higher fasting glucose clearance , suggesting that per1 directly alters metabolic behavior .
these results demonstrate that a disturbance in the circadian clock mechanism leads to significant alterations in glucose and lipid homeostasis and body weight maintenance .
circadian clocks and feeding behavior feeding behavior directly influences changes in body weight and is also under the circadian clocks control .
inversely , food ingestion , meals times , types of nutrient intake and metabolism can also synchronize the circadian clocks and stimulate specific responses .
food restriction ( fr ) is an experimental model in which time and duration of food availability is restricted without reducing calories .
animals submitted to this regimen , being fed ad libitum at the same time of day for just a few hours , adjust their feeding behavior for that specific time of day within only a few days [ 39,40 ] .
thus , fr promotes physiological and behavioral modifications that show anticipatory responses from 2 to 4 hours before the feeding period .
these changes are evidenced by multiple systems influenced by circadian clocks that show an increase in locomotor activity , cardiac frequency , body temperature , gastrointestinal motility and activity of digestive enzymes .
however , fr affects the peripheral circadian clocks without altering the central circadian clock , since animals without scn submitted to fr maintain circadian rhythms independently of the light / dark cycle [ 41,42 ] .
this means that fr desynchronizes peripheral and central circadian clocks yet when the feeding behavior reverts to normal , the peripheral circadian clocks are resynchronized by the central circadian clock .
the hypothalamic dorsomedial nucleus , involved in central hunger and satiety regulation , is considered the food - entrainable oscillator ( feo ) that acts in conjunction with the scn to coordinate circadian feeding behavior [ 43 ] .
it is known that food nutritional value also affects anticipatory responses .
when rats are fed daily with two meals containing two or three macronutrients ( protein + fat or protein + carb ) , they show anticipatory feeding behavior , a state which does not occur with free access to food containing all macronutrients [ 44 ] .
calorie restriction ( cr ) consists of reducing the amount of calories from lipids , carbohydrates and protein diet by 25 to 60 % without causing malnutrition .
in contrast , cr affects the central circadian clock , suggesting that a low calorie diet can alter physiological and behavioral rhythms .
it also alters clock gene expression since it modifies the scn function and its responsiveness to the light / dark cycle , thereby impairing circadian responses [ 45,46 ] .
cr has been shown to prolong lifetime and can postpone the onset of many diseases such as obesity and diabetes [ 47,48 ] .
moreover , it was also observed that high calorie diets can influence many systems controlled by the circadian clock [ 49 ] .
animals submitted to high calorie diets develop symptoms similar to metabolic syndrome , including insulin resistance and increased body weight gain , because several hormonal and behavioral rhythms are altered by this intake [ 49,50 ] .
a high fat diet also directly affects clock synchronization to environmental light carried out by the scn [ 51 ] .
the kind of food and regular feeding schedules are important synchronizers of circadian clocks since they are capable of inducing anticipatory responses and rhythms of food ingestion .
the understanding of all mechanisms by which these synchronizations occur is relevant for better comprehension of the physiological processes involved in body weight and hunger / satiety regulation .
circadian rhythms , body weight and obesity generally , knowledge on body weight control is centered on the understanding of the mechanisms by which animals sense and respond to nutritional signs .
in this context , circadian clocks act directly on energy balance and food intake control and consequently regulate body weight .
the season of the year influences body weight , food intake , energy consumption , body temperature among other parameters that are common in mammals as a result of evolutionary adaptations .
this advantage allows animals to adapt to environment variations , optimizing their endogenous responses .
several studies in animals have demonstrated the presence of seasonal rhythms , suggesting the importance of circadian clocks in body weight rhythmicity .
hamsters from siberia show well - defined seasonal rhythms for body weight , food intake and reproduction. through photoperiod modifications , i.e. length of the daylight period , seasonal alterations can be induced by melatonin secretion [ 52 ] .
in the winter phenotype for instance ( shorter days and longer nights ) there is a decrease in food intake , lethargy , body weight loss of up to 35 % ( especially intra - abdominal fat loss ) , change to a clearer pelage and differentiated body temperature control , avoiding excessive energy expenditure [ 53 ] .
there is also a decrease in leptin gene expression in adipose tissue and its concentration in circulation [ 54 ] .
studies on bird circannual rhythms have demonstrated that those exposed to shorter photoperiods exhibited lower daily energy expenditure [ 55 ] .
it was also observed that , during the winter period , reindeers ( arctic ruminants ) exhibit lower plasmatic concentrations of leptin and insulin , together with reductions in body weight , total serum proteins and urea [ 56 ] .
these , and other studies , have indicated that the photoperiod duration is associated to body weight alterations and that circadian clocks play a key role in its regulation .
it is known that light exposition at night and sleeplessness lead to an increase in adiposity and to other factors conducive to metabolic syndrome prevalence , including obesity , diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
studies in children and young adults have shown a direct association between fewer hours of sleep and weight gain , and individuals that sleepless have an increased chance of developing obesity in adult life [ 57,58 ] .
this association also holds for elderly people , and has been proven recently in a study with men and women over 65 years old [ 59 ] : individuals who slept less than 5 hours per day exhibited higher body mass index ( bmi ) , being an average of 2.5 kg / m2 higher in men , and 1.8 kg / m2 greater in women .
these data were also confirmed in lab studies .
one such study compared subjects submitted to 4 or 10 hours of sleep for 2 consecutive nights , and found that sleep restriction was associated with an average reduction of 18 % in leptin concentration , an elevation of 28 % in the orexigenic factor ghrelin , and increases in hunger ( 24 %) and appetite ( 23 %) , especially for calorie - dense foods with high carbohydrate content [ 60 ] .
given that hunger increases during sleep restriction lead to increased food intake , individuals who sleep less are expected to experience greater weight gain over time .
laposky et al .
[ 61,62 ] performed studies with leptin - deficient obese ob / ob mice , and obese and diabetic db / db mice ( they do not express a particular isoform of leptin receptor ) and demonstrated that these animals had disturbed wake / sleep cycles , slept less and had reduced locomotor activity .
therefore , fewer sleep hours can contribute to increased prevalence of overweight and obesity through changes in regulation of appetite , increased availability of feeding and / or stimulating a decrease in energy expenditure .
all these factors are influenced by the control of circadian clocks .
night shift workers have different patterns of sleep due to changes in synchronization of their endogenous rhythms with the light / dark cycle .
these sleep alterations are associated with metabolic disturbances , cardiovascular disease , diabetes and obesity .
in a study involving approximately 27,500 individuals , it was observed that obesity , increased triglycerides and decreased hdl cholesterol were more prevalent in night shift workers compared to day shift workers [ 63 ] .
another study demonstrated that night workers also exhibited increased fasting glucose , free fatty acids , arterial blood pressure , abdominal circumference and bmi [ 64,65 ] .
regarding the nutritional status of night workers , different eating patterns were found : 1 .
total intake of calories and the presence of three major groups of nutrients in one meal did not differ from day laborers , except for a 10 % higher consumption of saturated fat for night workers , 2 .
food intake was more fragmented during the day , being lower at breakfast and lunch , and higher at dinner and in snacks between meals , especially evening and night [ 65 ] .
it is important to highlight that obese individuals report less total sleep time per night , with a difference of one hour of sleep per week corresponding to an increase of 5.4 kg / m2 in bmi [ 1 ] .
sleep disorders such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are very common in individuals with metabolic and endocrine pathologies , but often remain undiagnosed .
this can lead to the onset of obesity and diabetes [ 66 ] .
treatment of sleep disorders has a potential to improve glucose metabolism and energy balance .
another point to consider is that even in altered metabolic states , circadian rhythms of hormones , receptors , transporters , etc are maintained .
for example , in obese subjects , circadian rhythms of leptin and adiponectin are still present , albeit changed .
in a 24 - hour period , obese individuals showed increased plasmatic leptin concentrations with higher peaks of secretion .
on the other hand , adiponectin concentrations were lower where this was associated with smaller and shorter peaks of secretion [ 67 ] .
ghrelin ( hormone involved in body weight regulation ) concentrations are decreased in the obese while no increase is seen in the evening in contrast to lean subjects [ 67 ] .
recently , kaneko et al .
( 2009 ) [ 68 ] demonstrated that obesity modifies clock gene circadian expression in the central nervous system .
moreover , it alters the expression of target genes of circadian clocks that can participate in mechanisms involved in the rhythmic alterations and neuronal dysfunctions observed in obese individuals such as pparalpha .
expression of peripheral clock gene components in adipose tissue are also altered in obese subjects , as demonstrated by loboda et al. in 2009 [ 14 ] .
the authors studied subcutaneous adipose tissue ( obtained from biopsies collected in the morning , afternoon or evening ) from obese patients submitted to fasting and / or treated with sibutramine .
results showed that 25 % of the expressed genes in adipose tissue presented circadian rhythm , including those essentially involved in energy metabolism and tissue physiology .
thus , they hypothesized that circadian rhythms showed by the genes involved in energy metabolism may be reflecting in the adipocyte , a transition from a state of energy expenditure in the morning to a state of energy storage during the night .
this mechanism was indeed demonstrated by the delay of this transition observed after fasting and treatment with sibutramine .
therefore , obesity is closely related to circadian clock disturbances , both central and peripheral .
this highlights the importance of circadian rhythms in adipose tissue physiology and energy metabolism regulation of the body .
circadian clocks play a key role in body weight control and in mechanisms implicated in this control , such as hunger / satiety cycle , feeding behavior , wake / sleep cycle , energy expenditure / storage and hormonal secretion .
genetics and the link between obesity , body weight and circadian clocks genetic factors are important contributors to obesity development , as demonstrated by several studies in humans and animals .
some authors have suggested four levels of genetic determination of obesity : genetic obesity , strong genetic predisposition , slight genetic predisposition , and genetically resistant [ 69 ] .
the heritability of common obesity is usually due to an interaction of multiple candidate genes found at different locations on the gene map and is therefore polygenic in nature [ 70 ] .
candidate genes either predispose to obesity or promote body weight loss .
genes either interact with each other ( gene - gene interactions ) or with various environmental factors ( gene - environment interactions ) .
interactions between biological ( genes , hormones , neurotransmitters , etc. ) , psychobehavioral and environmental factors influence body fat accumulation and fat distribution and can also increase other elements related to body weight gain .
most of the genes discovered to date chiefly impact hunger , satiety and food intake [ 71 ] .
mutations in the leptin gene ( lep ) , leptin receptor ( lepr ) , pro - opiomelanocortin ( pomc ) , proconvertase 1 ( pc1 ) , melanocortin receptor 4 ( mc4r ) , melanocortin receptor 3 ( mc3r ) , neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 ( ntrk2 ) and many others have been recognized as promoters of morbid obesity and rare forms of human obesity [ 72 ] .
studies evaluating twins and adopted children compared to their biological relatives showed heritability of bmi [ 73 ] .
a recent study involving 5,092 british twins aged from 8 to 11 years revealed that genetic influences were extremely significant in bmi ( 77 %) and abdominal circumference , whereby 60 % of abdominal adiposity heritability was from the same genes in bmi , and the remaining 40 % were attributed to different genetic factors [ 74 ] .
several human genetic polymorphisms have been described in circadian clock genes as have their associations with metabolic disturbances .
for example , studies in different populations demonstrated some associations between polymorphisms in the clock gene and metabolic syndrome , hepatic steatosis , obesity predisposition , eating disorder , sleep disorders , schizophrenia and bipolar disease [ 75 - 78 ] .
other studies have revealed associations between : polymorphisms in bmal1 with hypertension and type 2 diabetes [ 79 ] , hypertension and npas2 ( clock gene analogous ) [ 80 ] , and glucose and per2 [ 81 ] .
recent research has shown differences in the distribution of circadian clock gene polymorphism frequencies among populations in different parts of the world including chinese , african - american , caucasian - african individuals [ 82 ] .
population genetic analyses suggest these differences stem more from genetic factors than natural selection .
these results point to the fact that each population presents variations in circadian clock genes that allow metabolic and behavioral adaptations according to their ambient , cultural and social environment .
conclusions a large body of evidence suggests that obesity can cause alterations in circadian rhythms and vice - versa , since desynchronized rhythms can induce the onset of obesity and other metabolic diseases .
it is clear that perfect synchronization between central and peripheral clocks and correct functioning of the adipose tissue clock are essential in regulating hunger , adiposity , energy balance and body weight .
further studies are needed to investigate the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in this control .
this knowledge can contribute to the development of new therapies for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders .

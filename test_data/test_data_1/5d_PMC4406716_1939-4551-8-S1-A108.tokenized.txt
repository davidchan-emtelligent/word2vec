our study reflects the characteristics of old adults living in buenos aires who have been diagnosed of asthma .
methods an observational descriptive study was performed at five different health care facilities in buenos aires .
clinical records during three months of 2014 were searched .
allergists reviewed all clinical histories and elderly was defined as older than 60 years .
clinical and laboratory characteristics were assessed , including severity of asthma ( according to gina ) , current treatment , evidence of sensitization via skin prick test ( spt ) , chest radiograph , total serum ige and relative eosinophil counts .
results total 152 patients were included and their average age ( sd ) were 66.83 years ( 6.52 ) , 73 % women , 78 % caucasian and 22 % hispanic .
late - onset asthma ( with asthma onset after 60 years old ) was described in 10 % of the patients , with mean ( sd ) age at diagnosis of 69,67 ( 6,81 ) years .
most of the patients had a diagnosis of persistent asthma ( 74 %) , while only a 7 % of them had a severe persistent asthma .
they all were treated with an inhaled corticosteroid ( ics ) + long - acting beta - adrenergic ( fluticasone + salmeterol ( 59 %) , and the first choice as acute reliever therapy was an inhaled fast - acting beta - adrenergic agonist ( salbutamol ( 89 %) .
the doses of ics were below 1000 mg / day in 77 % of the patients .
common sensitizing allergens ( spt ) included mites ( 18 %) , pollens ( 8 %) and fungi ( 7 %) .
anaphylactic triggers were predominantly tobacco smoke ( 40 %) , even though most of the patients had never smoked before ( 88 %) .
exercise ( 21 %) and aeroallergens ( 20 %) also triggered anaphylaxis .
the chest radiograph was normal in the majority of the patients ( 89 %) .
elevated ige and eosinophilia were only found in 4 % and 30 % of the patients , respectively .
conclusions this is a retrospective study of aie patients in argentina .
better understanding of disease characteristics is needed to improve disease management .

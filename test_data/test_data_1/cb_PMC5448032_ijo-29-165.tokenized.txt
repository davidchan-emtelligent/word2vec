introduction : petrositis is a rare but severe complication of acute otitis media and mastoiditis .
despite efficient antibiotic therapy , there are still reports of both intratemporal and intracranial complications of otitis media with the potential risk of high morbidity and mortality .
petrositis has traditionally been treated with surgery , but recent advances in imaging , with improved antibiotic treatment , allow more conservative management .
case report : in this case report we describe the clinical course and treatment of a 33 - year - old man with petrous apicitis who presented with severe otalgia , retro - orbital pain , and sixth cranial nerve palsy gradenigo syndrome .
our patient showed a dramatic response to intravenous antibiotics only , without need for any surgical intervention , even myringotomy .
conclusion : it seems that early detection and management of this syndrome before development of other intratemporal or intracranial complications may prevent the need for surgical intervention .
key words acute otitis media gradenigo syndrome medical therapeutics petrositis surgical intervention introduction petrositis is a rare and severe complication of acute otitis media ( aom ) and mastoiditis ( 1,2 ) .
in goldstein ' study of 100 children admitted to the children 's hospital of pittsburgh between 1980 and 1995 with an intratemporal complications of aom , only four patients presented with acute petrositis ( 3 ) .
each petrous apex is either under developed ( sclerotic ) , contains marrow , or exhibits a variable degree of pneumatization .
pneumatization develops in only approximately 30 % of temporal bones .
petrous apicitis is essentially mastoiditis that occurs in the petrous apex .
petrous apicitis can produce a triad of retro - orbital pain , sixth cranial nerve paralysis , and otorrhea , which has become known as gradenigo 's syndrome .
only a minority of patients with petrous apicitis exhibit the full triad today ( 4 ) .
a review of the english - language literature for gradenigo syndrome or petrous apicitis revealed only 48 publications concerning this condition , most in the otolaryngology press ( 5 ) .
petrous apicitis is an extension of infection from the mastoid air cell tract into a pneumatized anterior or posterior petrous apex ( 6 ) .
most of the gradenigo syndrome cases that have been reported in the literature were caused by pyogenic bacteria , although there is a report documenting infections of nontuberculous mycobacteria ( ntm ) in gradenigo syndrome .
thus ntm infection must be considered in chronic otomastoiditis complicated by gradenigo syndrome not responding to initial broad - spectrum antibiotic therapy ( 7 ) .
a case of aspergillus petrous apicitis was also reported ( 8 ) .
in the pre - antibiotic era , the incidence of intracranial complications of ear disease has been quoted at 2.3 - 6.4 % , with a reduction to 0.04 - 0.15 % due to the introduction of the widespread use of antibiotics ( 9 ) .
sometimes extracranial complications of otitis media may be accompanied by intracranial complications such as meningitis and dural sinus thrombosis and cavernous sinus thrombosis ( 10,11 ) .
because of the anatomic complexities and the necessity to work around the labyrinth and the carotid artery , petrous apex air cell disease cannot be excised .
established drainage and prolonged antibiotics are an integral part of treatment , with or without surgery ( 4 ) .
petrous apicitis has traditionally been treated with aggressive surgical methods .
however , recent reports describe good results with more conservative medical treatment and minimal surgical intervention ( 12 ) .
we present a case of petrositis after aom with abducens nerve palsy and retro - orbital pain , which was managed medically with only iv antibiotics and steroids without the need for surgical intervention , even myringotomy .
case report our patient was a 33 - year - old male , who initially had presented to the neurologic clinic with left - sided lateral gaze restriction , horizontal diplopia , and retro - orbital pain for 8 days , but with no history of photophobia .
the patient also had an 8 - week history of left - sided otalgia that improved partially after receiving a 5 - day course of oral azithromycin , but became aggravated again 3 days prior to admission .
the patient 's hearing status was not changed subjectively .
in terms of past medical history , the patient had no complaint of otorrhea or ear problems .
he had a history of head injury with an altered level of consciousness the previous year , improving after 3 days .
on admission , a physical examination showed normal vital signs ( including normal body temperature ) with a left - sided red bulge on the tympanic membrane ( tm ) , but no evidence of perforation , otorrhea , retro - auricular swelling or tenderness was noted .
eye movement was restricted in the left - sided lateral gaze , but corneal sensation was normal .
the patient had normal symmetrical facial movement bilaterally .
other cranial nerves were also intact .
due to abducent nerve palsy and gaze restriction , the patient was initially evaluated by a neurologist , and a brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) scan was taken .
because of mri evidence of mastoiditis and petrositis , the patient was referred to our clinic for further evaluation and management ( fig.1,2 ) .
in concurrent mr venography , no evidence of lateral sinus thrombosis was detected ( fig.3 ) .
at that time our computed tomography ( ct ) scanner was not working , so a high - resolution ct scan was not performed on this patient .
laboratory tests showed a white blood count of 10.7 x 109 / l ; 57.8 % neutrophil ; an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10 mm / h and a negative c - reactive protein result .
fig 1 brain mri axial t1wi without gad showing left mastoid air cell opacification and involvement of the left petrous apex fig 2 brain mri axial t2wi without gad showing left mastoid air cell opacification and involvement of the left petrous apex fig 3 mr venography with contrast : no evidence of lateral sinus thrombosis is seen pure tone audiometry performed 2 months later showed mild left - sided sensorineural hearing loss that peaked at 4 khz , but the patient did not complain of recent subjective changes in hearing status .
this mild hearing loss may have been due to a previous head injury ( fig.4 ) .
fig 4 audiometry , 2 months after admission , mild sensorineural hearing loss in 4 kh in left side the patient was treated with clindamycin 600 mg intravenously ( iv ) every 6 hours and ceftazidime 1 g iv every 8 hours for 5 days .
in addition , the patient received dexamethasone 8 mg iv every 8 hours for 3 days .
on the second day in our institution , otalgia was improved .
one day later the patient had no complaint of retro - orbital pain , and on the fourth day after admission , the left lateral gaze returned to normal without any restriction .
the patient was discharged on oral co - amoxiclav for 2 weeks .
after 2 weeks of visiting the out - patient department , the patient was followed - up and found to have not complaints .
a follow - up temporal bone ct was taken approximately 6 weeks after discharge .
this scan showed the disappearance of the left mastoid bone and petrous apex opacification with good aeration of both areas ( fig. 5 ) .
fig 5 axial temporal bone ct image showing disappearance of opacification and improvement of aeration at left petrous apex and mastoid bone discussion gradenigo syndrome is an uncommon but life - threatening complication of otitis media .
the most common symptoms are deep facial or retro - orbital pain ( from irritation of contiguous trigeminal ganglion in meckel 's cave ) , or paralysis of the abducens nerve as it passes through dorell 's canal abutting the petrous apex or dysfunction of facial or cochleovestibular nerves as they course through the temporal bone .
the typical presentation of gradenigo syndrome comprises retro - orbital pain , sixth cranial nerve palsy , and otorrhea .
only a minority of patients exhibit the full triad today ( 4 ) .
our patient developed retro - orbital pain and abducens nerve palsy without any otorrhea , although otalgia was the initial complaint in his clinical course and at presentation he had overt aom .
petrous apicitis might develop following aom or may occur in a patient with chronic otitis media .
typical causative organisms in aom are streptococcus pneumoniae , haemophilus influenzae , and branhamella catarrhalis , and a combination of aerobic and anaerobic organisms have been cultured from patients ( 4 ) .
due to his previous history , our patient appeared to be a case of aom that developed into gradenigo syndrome .
because of his dramatic response to iv antibiotics , the patient did not need tympanocentesis or myringotomy and culture ; therefore no causative organisms were identified .
the time interval between the onset of otitis media and the clinical presentation of abducens nerve palsy varies from 1 week to 2 - 3 months ( 13 ) .
among our patients , this time is typically about 7 weeks .
most reported cases of gradenigo syndrome in the last decade have developed secondary to aom in children ( 5,9,13,14 ) .
in the present case of this adult 33 - year - old man , symptoms also followed an acute attack of otitis media .
established drainage and prolonged antibiotics are an integral part of treatment , with or without surgery ( 4 ) .
most authors advocate surgery , due to the possibility of fatal complications .
chole and donald stated that aggressive surgical drainage is indicated when petrous apicitis is diagnosed ( 15 ) and watkyn - thomas reported that petrositis is curable by adequate mastoid operation ( 16 ) .
hendersot et al. presented a middle fossa approach for the treatment of petrous apicitis ( 17 ) .
however , recent reports advocate conservative therapy with high - dose broad - spectrum antibiotics and less aggressive surgical procedures ( 5 ) .
indeed , five cases among 48 reviewed from the english - language literature were treated without surgery ( 6 ) .
in our case , a dramatic response was achieved by administering iv antibiotics for 3 - 4 days without the need for surgical intervention , even a ventilation tube .
our patient was discharged after a 5 - day course of iv antibiotic therapy .
in a case reported by scardapane , complete resolution of symptoms and radiological alterations were observed within 7 weeks ( 13 ) .
in the present case , all clinical signs and symptoms were resolved during the first 4 days of admission .
complete resolution of mastoid and petrous bone opacification was seen on a high - resolution ct scan of the temporal bone performed 6 weeks after discharge .
conclusion in conclusion , we emphasize the possibility of the conservative management of petrositis .
this is not the first report of gradenigo syndrome complicating a case of otitis media .
however , our case is a good example of successful and dramatic medical resolution due to early diagnosis and adequate prompt treatment with iv antibiotics before development of other intratemporal or intracranial complications .
clearly , when conservative therapy fails or chronic ear disease is present , surgical intervention is indicated to ensure adequate drainage of all mastoid and petrous bone air cells .

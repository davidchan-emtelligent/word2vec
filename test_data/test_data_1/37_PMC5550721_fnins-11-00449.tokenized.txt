purpose : exoskeletons have been developed for rehabilitation of patients with walking impairment due to neurological disorders .
recent studies have shown that the voluntary - driven exoskeleton hal ( r ) ( hybrid assistive limb ) can improve walking functions in spinal cord injury and stroke .
the aim of this study was to assess safety and effects on walking function of hal ( r ) supported treadmill therapy in patients with limb - girdle muscular dystrophy ( lgmd ) .
materials and methods : three lgmd patients received 8 weeks of treadmill training with hal ( r ) 3 times a week .
outcome parameters were 10 - meter walk test ( 10 mwt ) , 6 - minute walk test , and timed - up - and - go test ( tug ) .
parameters were assessed pre and post training and 6 weeks later ( follow - up ) .
results : all patients completed the therapy without adverse reactions and reported about improvement in endurance .
improvements in outcome parameters after 8 weeks could be demonstrated .
persisting effects were observed after 6 weeks for the 10 mwt and tug test ( follow - up ) .
conclusions : hal ( r ) treadmill training in lgmd patients can be performed safely and enables an intensive highly repetitive locomotor training .
all patients benefitted from this innovative method .
upcoming controlled studies with larger cohorts should prove its effects in different types of lgmd and other myopathies .
muscular dystrophy exoskeleton locomotor training walking rehabilitation introduction limb girdle muscular dystrophies ( lgmd ) are rare neuromuscular diseases with an estimated prevalence ranging from 0.43 per 100,000 for subtype 2i ( lgmd 2i ) and 0.94 per 100,000 for subtype 2a ( lgmd 2a ; fanin et al. , 2005 ; narayanaswami et al. , 2014 ; thompson and straub , 2016 ) .
they are a pathophysiologically diverse group of degenerative myopathies with the common feature of floppy para - or quadriparesis with proximal pronouncement and muscular atrophy .
basically , lgmds and divided into two groups due to different modes of inheritance .
the lgmd1 group has an autosomal dominant inheritance , whereas lgmd2 are autosomal recessive .
involvement of cardiac and respiratory muscles , joint contractures and extramuscular anomalies occur irregularly depending on the subtype , the underlying genetic defect and affected structural protein ( thompson and straub , 2016 ) .
for example , cardiac involvement is observed often in lgmd 2b whereas has not yet been reported for lgmd 2a , suggesting different pathophysiological mechanisms in both diseases .
different genetic mutations have been identified as the cause of fiber degeneration and strength loss .
intensive genetic and proteomic research over the last 10 years helped to understand the disease and clinical manifestations .
another nomenclature of lgmds can be done depending on the specific protein function that is defective .
so , different pathways and subcellular structures can be involved , e.g. , dystrophin - glycoprotein complex , sarcomere , glycosylation , signal transduction , nuclear function , and trafficking .
these pathological mechanisms may lead to loss of sarcomere integrity , error in glycosylation of alpha - dystroglycan , defects in muscle repair and dissociation of the sarcomere .
for example , lgmd 2a is the most frequent lgmd worldwide .
underlying mutations are located in the calpain - 3 - gene that encodes a muscle - specific nonlysosomal protease that is supposed to be mainly involved in disassembly of the sarcomere and muscle cytoskeleton to allow for proper protein turnover during muscle remodeling ( taveau et al. , 2003 ; kramerova et al. , 2007a,b ) .
the clinically manifestations can vary and the phenotypic spectrum is broad ; cardiac involvement has not been reported yet and stands in great contrast with other types of lgmd ( kramerova et al. , 2007a ) .
in contrast , lgmd 2i is caused by a mutation in the fukutin - related protein gene ( fkrp ) at chromosome 19 .
it leads to secondary laminin alpha2 deficiency and an abnormal glycosylation of alpha - dystroglycan ( brockington et al. , 2001a,b ) .
the clinical spectrum of this subtype ranges from severe and duchenne - like phenotypes to mild dystrophies with mild elevated creatine kinase ( ck ) levels ( mercuri et al. , 2003 ) .
however , genetic and protein defects for all subtypes are still not yet known .
today , lgmd1 a - h and lgmd2 a - w are described ( nigro and savarese , 2014 ) today .
clinically , muscle weakness is usually slowly progressive over years .
resultant reduced endurance and cardiovascular fitness , fatigue , exercise intolerance and a more sedentary lifestyle are common symptoms of patients with lgmd .
sooner or later but depending on subtype , most patients need physical assistance for walking and activities of daily living .
inspite of growing and innovative pharmaceutical investigations for degenerative and even hereditary neurological disorders , disease - specific therapy for lgmd is not yet available ( thompson and straub , 2016 ) .
a few study groups still try to find therapies that start at genetic level .
initial laboratory approaches have been undertaken for precise genetic therapy in lgmd 2b and 2d ( turan et al. , 2016 ) .
other study groups have tried to diminish secondary effects of muscle degeneration like inflammation with immune suppressive therapies or to prevent cardiac involvement ( chen et al. , 2016 ; heydemann , 2016 ) .
none of these approaches are established and safe medical therapies , today .
nonetheless , patients suffering from lgmd cannot profit from these new investigations .
therefore , exercise therapies play an important role in patients with lgmd ( siciliano et al. , 2015 ) .
even many studies have been conducted in this area , little is known about the best and most effective physiotherapy for each different myopathy .
standard rehabilitation therapy programs could not be established yet .
most studies struggle with the problem of small case numbers , unclear subtype of lgmd , unclear genetic mutation and heterogeneous causes of myopathy that has been included to the study .
one should be very careful in extrapolating training effects from one disease to another , since the molecular defects are so different , which warrants many more investigations of individual muscle diseases .
generally , two different types for physical therapy can be divided : ( a ) strength training and ( b ) aerobic exercise training ( siciliano et al. , 2015 ) .
strength training programs aiming at certain target muscles report transient increase in muscle strength , but without knowing the optimal resistance needed ( lindeman et al. , 1995 ; sveen et al. , 2013 ) .
strength exercise should be supervised because of possible long - lasting myalgia and increase of ( ck ) indicating therapy - induced muscular injury ( da luz et al. , 2011 ) .
studies examining various exercise protocols are limited because of small sample sizes and wide clinical heterogeneity , again .
several studies showed that walking rehabilitation programs with aerobic endurance training can improve muscle strength and self - assessed muscle function ( ansved , 2003 ; vissing et al. , 2014 ) .
for example , vissing et al. investigated 6 patients with lgmd 2l , so called anoctamin 5 myopathy ( vissing et al. , 2014 ) .
they performed systematically aerobic training with a bicycle ergometer for 10 weeks .
the authors could show improvement of oxidative capacity and muscle strength without further increase of ck or muscle soreness .
further studies from the same scientific group have demonstrated similar positive results for aerobic training in becker 's dystrophy ( sveen et al. , 2008 ) , lgmd 2i ( sveen et al. , 2007 ) , and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy ( olsen et al. , 2005 ) .
however , aerobic training seems to play a useful and safe effect in some subtypes of lgmd .
today , treadmill training ( tt ) is a very useful tool to enhance locomotor function in diseases presenting with walking disturbance , e.g. , stroke and spinal cord injury ( sci ; protas et al. , 2001 ; srivastava et al. , 2016 ) .
it requires partially preserved stability of the trunk and residual active muscle innervation of the lower extremities .
combined with a body weight support ( bwstt ) , it is a regularly used and safe tool to applicate an aerobic endurance training .
bwstt can be assessed also in patients with impaired cardiac and pulmonary function .
its advantage is a very high repetition frequency of gait cycle that can lead to more intensive learning and training effect ( daly and ruff , 2007 ) .
bwstt can especially improve the stance phase of gait , i.e. , the symmetrical weight shift ( visintin and barbeau , 1994 ) , symmetrical activation of the quadriceps muscles during limb loading ( trueblood , 2001 ) and faster walking ( visintin et al. , 1998 ; daly and ruff , 2004 , 2007 ) .
because bwstt has some lacks of results in some gait training studies considering brain plasticity and for the swing phase of gait , it is reasonable to combine bwstt with other interventions .
daly et al. combined bwstt with functional electrical stimulation ( fes ) in stroke survivors .
they showed that the combination offered the capability of practice of the greatest number of gait components for which two motor learning principles associated with cns plasticity could be satisfied : practice of close - to - normal movement and repetition of that practice ( daly and ruff , 2007 ) .
some studies using bwstt / tt in myopathies can be found in literature .
in particular , taivassalo used tt in patients with metabolic and non - metabolic myopathies performing a short - term aerobic training at low intensity .
both groups benefited ( taivassalo et al. , 1998 , 1999 ) .
controlled studies aiming on the effect of bwstt / tt compared to other training methods on different types of myopathy are not available so far .
clear recommendations on bwstt / tt application and other types of training methods in myopathies do not exist today .
in the last decades , bwstt has been combined with neurorobotic devices also ( blaya and herr , 2004 ; pohl et al. , 2007 ; michmizos et al. , 2015 ) .
all of these devices provide repetitive , accurate and reproducible practice and represent task - specific training .
a new generation of robotics are exoskeletons .
they are wearable mobile machines with a frame and actuators on hip and knee joints .
one commercially available exoskeleton is the hybrid assistive limb ( r ) ( hal ( r ) ; kawamoto et al. , 2013 , 2014 ) .
it detects electromyographic signals via surface electrodes from the ventral and dorsal thigh ( cyberdyne inc. , japan ) .
in contrast to other robotic devices that provide automatic passive motion , hal ( r ) enables gait training with voluntarily driven by muscle activity .
today , it used as a training tool only , not as an aid for domestic field .
in studies , it used in combination with bwstt throughout .
studies on patients with sci and stroke have demonstrated beneficial effects on walking function and on neuronal plasticity ( kubota et al. , 2013 ; aach et al. , 2014 ; cruciger et al. , 2014 ; sczesny - kaiser et al. , 2015 ) .
aach et al. showed in a pilot study and in a larger study including 55 patients with chronic sci that bwstt with hal ( r ) led to functional improvement assessed by walking tests like 10 - meter walk test and 6 - minutes walk test .
the authors used an intensive training program with 5 sessions per week over 12 weeks .
an improvement of ~ 50 % could be expected ( aach et al. , 2014 ; grasmucke et al. , 2017 ) .
even a cortical reorganization indicating neuronal plasticity could be observed .
using electrophysiological methods , unused leg representations in the postcentral gyrus were activated even after years post ictus ( sczesny - kaiser et al. , 2015 ) .
similar results have been reported for chronic stroke patients ( yoshimoto et al. , 2016 ) .
walking speed increased about 56 % .
a comparison with other rehabilitation programs like bobath has not been performed so far .
past experience with hal ( r ) training in patients with chronic gait impairment demonstrated that this exoskeleton and training program can induce additional functional improvements .
because patients with chronic myopathy rely on physiotherapy only , hal ( r ) might be a new training tool for exercise training .
looking for hal ( r ) training in myopathies , only one case has been reported using hal ( r ) in a patient with ocularpharyngodistal myopathy ( hasegawa et al. , 2015 ) .
authors stated that no adverse events occurred and that patient 's walking parameters were stable .
further application of hal ( r ) - training in myopathies or muscular dystrophies does not exist .
because hal ( r ) exoskeleton is a promising and novel rehabilitation tool utilizing patients' active and voluntarily driven muscular activity , we evaluated the effect on walking functions in three lgmd patients before and after an 8 - week period of hal ( r ) - supported treadmill training. by means of the results of this small study , upcoming studies with larger groups should be planned .
we want to establish a novel and innovative therapy program for patients with myopathies .
materials and methods subjects three outpatients of our neuromuscular center with lgmd were enrolled .
clinical details are shown in tables 1a,b. inclusion criteria were a clinically , histopathologically , or genetically determined lgmd with para - or quadriparesis and proximal pronouncement and muscular atrophy , and sufficient stability of the trunk .
the patients were required to present preserved motor function of hip and knee extensor and flexor muscle groups in order to be able to trigger the exoskeleton ( medical research council scale for muscle strength = mrc >= 1 / 5 ) .
exclusion criteria were plegia ( mrc 0 / 5 ) , instability of the trunk , severe limitations of range of motion regarding hip and knee joints ( i.e. , leading to functional contractures ) , body weight > 100 kg , non - consolidated fractures and severe heart insufficiency .
all patients provided written informed consent ( ethic approval no. 4733 - 13 , medical faculty , ruhr university bochum ) .
the study was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
the clinical assessment and muscle strength score were evaluated before the protocol by a skilled operator .

the exoskeletal training all patients underwent an 8 - week training period of body - weight supported treadmill training ( bwstt ) with hal ( r ) exoskeleton .
each patient was scheduled 3 times a week resulting in 24 sessions .
the actual time of walking with hal ( r ) was max .
30 min .
the exoskeleton was voluntarily triggered by emg - signals from the extensor and flexor muscles of hip and knee detected via surface emg electrodes .
voluntary motion was magnified and adjusted the muscle activity in accordance with the patient 's intention .
during therapy , the velocity of the treadmill ( woodway usa , wi , usa ) was set individually between comfortable and maximum speed tolerated by the patient .
initially , the bodyweight support was individually pre - set at up to 50 % of patient 's body weight and individually reduced in subsequent training sessions ( see figure 1 ) .

hal ( r ) - supported treadmill parameters some treadmill - bounded parameters were assessed .
the distance on treadmill in meters for each session , the velocity on treadmill and the time on treadmill were recorded and documented by the therapist .
primary outcome measurements to assess the training effect , all tests were performed without hal ( r ) exoskeleton .
we used the 10 - meter walk test ( 10 mwt ) at each daily training session ( bohannon et al. , 1996 ) .
data from the first and the last day have been taken for baseline and end of the training data .
we took it daily in order to give a feedback to the patient , to motivate her / him .
the 10 mwt measured the time needed to walk a 10 m distance .
the timed - up - and - go test ( tug ) describes the time and assistance required for standing up from the wheelchair , walk 3 m , turn around , walk back and sit down ( podsiadlo and richardson , 1991 ) .
the 6 - minute walk test ( 6 mwt ) evaluates the distance covered when walking for 6 min ( balke , 1963 ) .
tug test and 6 mwt were done at the beginning and at the end of the 8 - week training period .
if possible , all three tests were assessed 6 weeks after the end of the training period again ( follow - up assessment , see figure 2 ) .
figure 2 study design .
three measurements : pre - , post - , and follow - up assessments .
additionally , 10 mwt was performed before and after each training session .
follow - up assessments were done 6 weeks after completion of hal ( r ) training period .
secondary outcome measurements to assess motor and balance functions , the motor - related section of the functional independence measure ( fim ) ( keith et al. , 1987 ) and the berg balance scale ( bbs ) ( berg et al. , 1992 ) were documented at baseline and after the 8 - week training period ( ottenbacher et al. , 1996 ; ravaud et al. , 1999 ; berard et al. , 2005 ) .
both scales were tested by a physical therapist with long - time experience in neurological disorders and myopathies .
self - reported changes in condition and symptoms , adverse events before and after each training session , patients were asked if they had any negative symptoms and adverse events .
furthermore , after the whole training session , patients completed a modified questionnaire grading changes in physical endurance , leg muscle strength , and physical activity ( sveen et al. , 2007 ) .
results exoskeletal training all three patients completed 24 sessions each .
patients # 2 and # 3 performed follow - up assessment after 6 weeks .
patient # 1 was lost to follow - up. adverse reactions did not occur .
assessed data can be divided into two categories : ( a ) hal ( r ) - supported treadmill parameters and ( b ) primary outcome parameters without hal ( r ) .
treadmill parameters were recorded online and demonstrate the velocity on treadmill , how long the patients could perform the exercise on the treadmill and the distance walked on treadmill .
these parameters should improve , otherwise the training has to be considered not suitable for this patient .
improvement in treadmill bounded parameters are the basis of a successful training .
hal ( r ) - supported treadmill parameters all patients showed increased distance covering on treadmill , increased training time with a maximum of 30 min and increased velocity on treadmill ( see figures 3a - c ) .
a five - fold distance , four - fold increase of velocity and a maximum time on treadmill ( 30 min ) have been reached in all patients .
figure 3 treadmill parameter with hal ( r ) exoskeleton at baseline and after 24 training sessions ( a - c ) .
primary outcome parameters figures 4a - c show the results of all walking parameters 10 mwt , tug test , and 6 mwt .
at baseline 10 mwt showed similar impairment at a mild stage for all 3 patients .
six mwt and tug test demonstrated different degree of impairment reflecting different subtypes of lgmd .
but , assessed without hal ( r ) exoskeleton , all patients showed clearly decreased time in 10 mwt , increased distance in 6 mwt and decreased time in tug test after 24 training sessions .
in the follow up assessments , 10 mwt and tug test data revealed preserved training effects in both patients compared to baseline data .
this effect could not be observed for 6 mwt data .
statistical analysis was not performed due to small data .

bbs - scores of patients # 1 and # 3 varied only by 1 point .
considering the motor section of fim , patient # 3 increased by 6 points after hal ( r ) therapy whereas patient # 2 did not exhibit any change ( see figures 5a,b ) .

discussion this study shows that hal ( r ) - assisted bwstt is a safe and effective method for aerobic exercise training in ambulatory patients with lgmd .
all patients showed increased treadmill - bounded and hal ( r ) - dependent walking parameter , i.e. , walking distance , velocity on treadmill and time on treadmill .
no patient reported about sustained worsening of symptoms .
these results indicate a good acceptance of this new robotic training method and give the basic for an effective therapy .
hal ( r ) supports the patients efficiently to complete treadmill training sessions and to improve walking distances on treadmill .
hal ( r ) - training enables a highly repetitive and intensive locomotor training in lgmd - patients with mild to severe impaired walking functions .
like previously described , tt cannot cover all parts of gait phases ; tt is more effective when combined with other training methods .
in our study , we combined with a voluntarily driven exoskeleton .
in this combination , more importantly , we found improved hal ( r ) - independent walking parameters ( 10 mwt , 6 mwt , tug ) which were paralleled by self - reported improvements .
compared to other hal ( r ) bwstt studies , we found similar improvements with ~ 30 - 50 % for walking speed .
the effects on tug test were in two patients (# 1 , # 3 ) smaller ; patient # 2 clearly improved in tug test ~ 30 % .
again , we can see different effects on different types of myopathy .
the effects on 6 mwt were smaller .
these results indicate different effects of hal ( r ) - supported bwstt on different aspects of gait , too .
ten mwt mainly reflects walking speed and an efficient sequence of gait phases whereas tug test aims on safety , balance and functional mobility .
six mwt includes cardiopulmonary fitness .
parameter of pulmonary and cardiac functions were not assessed in this study .
one might speculate only about the possible reason for the lack of improvement in 6 mwt .
a comparison with aerobic exercise studies on lgmd patients assessed by sveen ( sveen et al. , 2007 ) and vissing ( vissing et al. , 2014 ) is not available .
sveen and vissing used parameters for cardiopulmonary fitness like vo2 and plasma lactate levels .
these parameters were not collected in our study .
taivassalos' studies on metabolic and non - metabolic myopathies using tt assessed different parameters , too phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( taivassalo et al. , 1998 , 1999 ) .
thus , our study results cannot be compared with previous studies dealing in this field .
remarkably , training effects measured with 10 mwt and tug persisted for at least 6 weeks .
the effect on 6 mwt could not be detected at follow - up. the reason for this observation remains unclear .
maybe a short - time factor like motivation might play a role .
missing effects on cardiopulmonary functions might be another reason .
since cardiopulmonary parameters like vo2 were not revealed , this question remains unanswered .
in order to answer the question whether hal ( r ) training effects are limited to walking function or can also lead to better motor and balance functions in daily living , fim and bbs were assessed .
the results of both parameters were inconsistent and have to be tested in a larger cohort .
the observed score changes are small and do not exceed the required minimal detectable change .
one might see a tendency for patient # 2 in bbs .
the patient also improved in tug test that includes balance functions also .
so , both values ( bbs and tug test ) might be considered as a concordant result .
patient # 2 reported about frequent falls that reduced after training period for a time. whether this can be a systematic result , upcoming studies have to investigate this issue .
this is the first hal ( r ) study specifically focused on patients with lgmd .
patients with this disease present with proximal paresis .
because hal ( r ) robot suit supports proximal joints and muscle groups , these patients might benefit the most from this therapy .
as mentioned above , two single case reports have been published including one distal and one proximal pronounced myopathy ( asai et al. , 2014 ; hasegawa et al. , 2015 ) .
like the patient with bmd and proximal pronounced paresis , all our lgmd patients improved in hal ( r ) - independent walking parameters .
in contrast to this , the opdm patient 's walking function did not improve whereas treadmill associated parameters increased .
these two single cases underline that hal ( r ) training is more effective in patients with proximal paresis .
so , from our point of view , it is necessary to adapt hal ( r ) - training and take into account the physical condition and pattern of paresis .
another critical point is the training frequency and training time .
the whole training session lasted about 90 min , the net walking time 30 min .
coming up from our previous sci study and to take possible myalgias into account , we reduced the frequency from 5 times a week to 3 times a week ( aach et al. , 2014 ; nilsson et al. , 2014 ) .
the question which frequency might be optimal should be tested in upcoming systematic studies .
considering that these patients suffer from chronic degenerative and dystrophic myopathy , these results are encouraging , offering the possibility to use a novel approach of symptomatic therapy .
even though our study does not allow conclusions on interference with natural course of lgmd or potential long - term effects as compared to conventional physiotherapy , the results are encouraging for upcoming controlled hal ( r ) - studies in larger groups of patients with muscular dystrophy .
the anatomical or pathophysiological origins of positive effects on walking functions remain unclear .
different effects on muscular and neuronal systems can be discussed but were not investigated in detail in this study .
instead of our positive results , some limitations should be discussed .
this study is based on only three lgmd patients without a control group .
all patients were ambulatory patients of our neuromuscular center and are not representative of the disease with respect to age , gender , and clinical aspect , thus the findings cannot be generalized to the whole lgmd population .
specific measurements looking for increased endurance capacity ( lactate , respiratory function , cardiovascular measurements ) and serum ck levels were not collected .
in future studies , these parameters should be implemented .
we can conclude that our study investigating hal ( r ) - assisted body - weight supported treadmill training in patients with lgmd showed feasibility and safety .
moreover , for the first time , our data show that this voluntarily driven exoskeleton can improve walking functions. with respect to the limited data of three patients only , it encourages us to undertake further studies with larger cohorts and different types of lgmd .

cyanobacteriochromes ( cbcrs ) are distantly related to the red / far - red responsive phytochromes .
red / green - type cbcrs are widely distributed among various cyanobacteria .
the red / green - type cbcrs covalently bind phycocyanobilin ( pcb ) and show red / green reversible photoconversion .
recent studies revealed that some red / green - type cbcrs from chlorophyll d - bearing cyanobacterium acaryochloris marina covalently bind not only pcb but also biliverdin ( bv ) .
the bv - binding cbcrs show far - red / orange reversible photoconversion .
here , we identified another cbcr ( am1 _ c0023g2 ) from a. marina that also covalently binds not only pcb but also bv with high binding efficiencies , although bv chromophore is unstable in the presence of urea .
replacement of ser334 with gly resulted in significant improvement in the yield of the bv - binding holoprotein , thereby ensuring that the mutant protein is a fine platform for future development of optogenetic switches .
we also succeeded in detecting near - infrared fluorescence from mammalian cells harboring pcb - binding am1 _ c0023g2 whose fluorescence quantum yield is 3.0 % .
here the pcb - binding holoprotein is shown as a platform for future development of fluorescent probes .
optogenetics linear tetrapyrrole gfp near - infrared fluorescence live cell imaging japan science and technology agency10.13039 / 501100002241 introduction phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes ( cbcrs ) are photoreceptors that form a large superfamily with a linear tetrapyrrole - binding gaf ( cgmp - phosphodiesterase / adenylate cyclase / fhla ) domain ( ikeuchi and ishizuka , 2008 ; anders and essen , 2015 ) .
some cbcrs are known to be involved in regulation of light acclimation processes such as phototaxis ( yoshihara et al. , 2000 ; narikawa et al. , 2011 ; song et al. , 2011 ; savakis et al. , 2012 ; campbell et al. , 2015 ) , chromatic acclimation ( kehoe and grossman , 1996 ; hirose et al. , 2010 ) and light - dependent cell aggregation ( enomoto et al. , 2014 , 2015 ) .
only gaf domain of cbcrs is enough for chromophore ligation and photoconversion , although additional pas ( per / arnt / sim ) and phy ( phytochrome - specific ) domains in phytochromes are necessary .
cbcrs have been roughly categorized into two types according to the chromophore they contain in the thermostable state : phycoviolobilin ( pvb ) and pcb .
in both cases , pcb is initially incorporated into the gaf domain and cys residue within the gaf domain covalently ligates to c31 of the chromophore .
pvb - binding cbcrs sense relatively shorter wavelength light covering ultraviolet - to - green region ( yoshihara et al. , 2004 ; ishizuka et al. , 2006 ; rockwell et al. , 2008 , 2012a,b ; narikawa et al. , 2011 ; song et al. , 2011 ; enomoto et al. , 2012 ; ma et al. , 2012 ; cho et al. , 2015 ) , whereas pcb - binding cbcrs sense longer wavelength light covering ultraviolet - to - red region ( hirose et al. , 2008 , 2013 ; narikawa et al. , 2008a,b , 2014 ; rockwell et al. , 2011 , 2012c ; chen et al. , 2012 ) .
these cbcrs commonly show light - induced z / e isomerization of a double bond between rings c and d , followed by various structural changes such as reversible protochromic cycle and reversible cys - adduct formation ( rockwell et al. , 2008 ; burgie et al. , 2013 ; hirose et al. , 2013 ; narikawa et al. , 2013 , 2014 ) .
among the pcb - binding cbcrs , red / green - type cbcrs are widely spread among various cyanobacteria and most extensively analyzed so far ( narikawa et al. , 2008a , 2013 ; fukushima et al. , 2011 ; chen et al. , 2012 ; kim et al. , 2012a,b,c ; rockwell et al. , 2012c , 2015a,b ; velazquez escobar et al. , 2013 ; slavov et al. , 2015 ; song et al. , 2015a,b ) .
the red / green - type cbcrs show reversible photoconversion between a red - absorbing form ( pr ) with 15z - pcb and a green - absorbing form ( pg ) with 15e - pcb .
structure of pr form provides direct insights into chromophore - protein interaction ( narikawa et al. , 2013 ) .
detailed spectroscopic analyses based on this structure have revealed their photoconversion mechanism in which excited state destabilization and ring d distortion are suggested to occur to form blue - shifted pg form upon red - light irradiation ( rockwell et al. , 2014 ; song et al. , 2015a ) .
recently , it has been revealed that red / green - type cbcrs ( am1 _ 1557g2 and am1 _ 1870g3 ) derived from the chlorophyll d - bearing cyanobacterium acaryochloris marina covalently bind not only pcb but also biliverdin ( bv ; narikawa et al. , 2015a,b ) .
bv - binding ones show reversible photoconversion between far red - absorbing ( pfr ) form and orange - absorbing ( po ) form , whereas pcb - binding ones show normal red / green reversible photoconversion .
site - directed mutagenesis suggests that a cys residue within the gaf domain covalently ligates not only to pcb but also to bv. bv is present in most organisms including mammals and far - red light can penetrate into deep tissues , with a potential as optogenetic and bioimaging tools ( ziegler and moglich , 2015 ) .
here , we report another gaf domain ( second gaf domain of am1 _ c0023 called am1 _ c0023g2 ) from a. marina that covalently binds not only pcb but also bv. replacement of ser334 with gly resulted in significant improvement in yield of the bv - binding holoprotein .
further , we detected near - infrared fluorescence from mammalian cells harboring am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb whose fluorescence quantum yield is 3.0 % .
materials and methods plasmid construction the nucleotide sequence of am1 _ c0023g2 was cloned into pet28a ( novagen ) using in - fusion hd cloning kit ( takara ) as described previously ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
am1 _ c0023g2 sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) with a specific primer set ( 5 ' - cgcggcagccatatgaatatttccgagattatt - 3 ' , 5 ' - ctcgaattcggatcctcaagcttctgctttgttttt - 3 ') and primestar max dna polymerase ( takara ) .
the inserted sequence was confirmed by sequencing with an abi310 genetic analyzer .
replacement of am1 _ c0023g2 ser334 with gly ( denoted s334g ) was performed using a specific primer set ( 5 ' - caacaaggatatacagattgtcatcta - 3 ' , tgtatatccttgttgataaatgtcagc ) and primestar max dna polymerase as described previously .
to construct gfp - fused am1 _ c0023g2 and am1 _ 1557g2 , the nucleotide sequences of gfp , am1 _ c0023g2 and am1 _ 1557g2 were amplified by pcr with specific primer sets and pyrobest dna polymerase ( takara ) .
the following primer sets were used to introduce restriction enzyme sites , a flexible peptide linker sequence , and kozak sequence : for gfp , 5 ' - atgcaagcttgccaccatggtgagcaagggcgag - 3 ' and 5 ' - gcatctcgagacctccgctaccgcccttgtacagctcgtc - 3 ' ; for am1 _ c0023g2 and am1 _ 1557g2 , 5 ' - atgcctcgagagcggcctggtgccgcgc - 3 ' and 5 ' - gagctcgaattcggatcc - 3 ' .
all sequences were confirmed by sequencing with an abi 310 genetic analyzer .
these constructs were cloned into a mammalian expression vector pcdna 3.1 (+) ( invitrogen ) using the restriction enzyme sites .
all the mammalian expression plasmids were purified using qiagen plasmid kit ( qiagen ) .
expression , purification , and sds - page his - tagged am1 _ c0023g2 was expressed in both bv - and pcb - producing escherichia coli ( c41 harboring pkt270 and pkt271 , respectively ) .
the his - tagged proteins were isolated by ni - affinity chromatography as described previously ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
the purified proteins were subjected to sds - page , followed by in - gel fluorescent assay and coomassie brilliant blue staining as described previously ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
fluorescence was visualized through a 600 nm long path filter upon excitation with wavelength of blue ( aaamax = 470 nm ) and green light ( aaamax = 530 nm ) through a 562 nm short path filter ( wse - 6100 luminograph , wse - 5500 varirays ; atto ) .
estimation of binding efficiencies protein concentration was determined by standard bradford method ( bio - rad ) .
we determined extinction coefficients of free pcb ( santa cruz biotechnology inc. ) and free bv ( frontier scientific ) under both acidic urea and 1 % sds conditions .
extinction coefficients of the free pcb and bv under the acidic urea condition were calculated to be a little less than 30000 , that is comparable to that reported previously ( glazer and fang , 1973 ) .
on the other hand , extinction coefficients of the free pcb and bv under the 1 % sds condition were calculated to be around 17000 .
although extinction coefficients of chromophores under the 1 % sds condition tend to be lower than those under the acid urea condition , pcb and bv behave similarly under both conditions .
thus , concentration of pcb bound to proteins was determined by absorbance at 666 nm when denatured with 8 m urea ( ph2.0 ) .
similarly that of bv bound to proteins was determined by absorbance at 646 nm when denatured with 1 % sds .
in vitro reconstitution s334g protein that is a mutant of am1 _ c0023g2 was used for in vitro reconstitution analysis because of its high yield of in vivo reconstitution system ( see figure 4 ) .
free bv and the apo - s334g protein were mixed in roughly equimolar amounts and incubated for 30 min at 37degreesc .
after removal of unbound bv by spin column , the sample was subjected to spectral analyses .
spectroscopy ultraviolet and visible absorption spectra were recorded with a shimadzu uv - 2600 spectrophotometer .
monochromic light of various wavelengths for photoconversion was generated using a variable wavelength light source ( opto - spectrum generator , hamamatsu photonics , inc. ) .
acid denaturation of the proteins was performed with 8 m urea , ph 2.0 under the dark condition .
fluorescence spectra were recorded with a stellarnet silver - nova spectrometer ( stellernet , inc. ) .
fluorescence quantum yields were measured with quantaurus - qy ( hamamatsu photonics , inc. ) .
imaging of gfp - fused am1 _ c0023g2 and am1 _ 1557g2 in mammalian cells human cervical carcinoma ( hela ) cells ( atcc , ccl - 2 ) were cultured in eagle 's minimum essential medium ( sigma ) supplemented with 2 mm l - glutamine ( gibco ) , 10 % fetal bovine serum ( gibco ) , 100 u / ml penicillin and 100 mug / ml streptomycin ( gibco ) at 37degreesc in 5 % ( v / v ) co2 .
the day before transfection , hela cells were plated onto 35 - mm glass - based dishes ( iwaki ) .
transfection was performed using lipofectamine 3000 ( life technologies ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
forty - eight hours after transfection , the cells were washed with hank 's balanced salt solution ( hbss ; gibco ) and replaced with hbss containing either 20 mum pcb ( frontier scientific ) diluted from a stock solution of 20 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ; wako ) or 0.1 % ( v / v ) dmso as the vehicle control .
after incubation for 4 h , the cells were washed and replaced with hbss , and imaged using a zeiss lsm 710 confocal microscope equipped with a plan - apochromat 63x / 1.4 oil immersion objective ( carl zeiss ) , a 488 nm ar laser , and a 633 nm he / ne laser .
green fluorescence of gfp was detected at 493 - 538 nm upon excitation with the 488 nm laser ( 6.5 muw measured at the back aperture of the objective lens ) .
near - infrared fluorescence of cbcr was detected at 638 - 740 nm upon excitation with the 633 nm laser ( 67 muw measured at the back aperture of the objective lens ) .
data analysis was performed using zen 2009 ( carl zeiss ) .
results and discussion am1 _ c0023g2 isolated from pcb - producing and bv - producing e. coli we found that am1 _ c0023 is closely related in - paralog of am1 _ 1557 .
am1 _ c0023 is 71 % identical to and has a domain architecture same as am1 _ 1557 ( figure 1a ) .
second gaf domain of am1 _ c0023 ( am1 _ c0023g2 ) is 84 % identical to that of am1 _ 1557 ( am1 _ 1557g2 ) .
residues highly conserved among red / green - type cbcrs and important for chromophore ligation are also conserved in am1 _ c0023g2 .

the zn2 + - staining was performed as previously described ( berkelman and lagarias , 1986 ) .
the gel was directly subjected to fluorescence detection .
the gel image was provided with black - and - white inversion for easy detection of fluorescent bands .
am1 _ c0023g2 was expressed in both pcb - and bv - producing e. coli and purified by using nickel - affinity column chromatography .
in - gel fluorescence analysis revealed that am1 _ c0023g2 covalently binds not only pcb but also bv like am1 _ 1557g2 ( figure 1b ) .
pcb - binding am1 _ c0023g2 ( am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb ) showed reversible photoconversion between red - absorbing pr form at 650 nm and green - absorbing pg form at 539 nm ( figure 2a ) , whereas bv - binding am1 _ c0023g2 ( am1 _ c0023g2 - bv ) showed reversible photoconversion between far red - absorbing pfr form at 699 nm and orange - absorbing po form at 618 nm ( figure 2b ) .
these spectral features are almost same as those of am1 _ 1557g2 ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
pfr - minus - po difference spectrum of am1 _ c0023g2 - bv possesses positive peaks at 700 and 377 nm and negative peaks at 601 and 284 nm , whereas pr - minus - pg difference spectrum of am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb possesses positive peaks at 650 , 352 , and 301 nm and negative peaks at 536 and 270 nm ( figure 2c ) .

( c ) difference spectra of pcb - ( blue ) and bv - binding ( magenta ) am1 _ c0023g2 before and after photoconversion .
am1 _ c0023 - bv pfr showed dark reversion to po ( figure 3a ) , whereas dark reversion of am1 _ c0023 - pcb pr was hardly detected ( figure 3b ) .
half - lives for the am1 _ c0023 - bv during dark reversion measured at 15 , 20 , and 25degreesc were 1356 , 478 , and 180 min , respectively ( figure 3b ) .
slower dark reversion was observed under lower temperature .
hardly detectable and relatively fast dark reversions of pcb - and bv - binding ones , respectively , are also consistent with those found for am1 _ 1557g2 and am1 _ 1870g3 ( narikawa et al. , 2015a,b ) .

site - directed mutagenesis of am1 _ c0023g2 in the process of site - directed mutagenesis analysis to obtain proteins with higher fluorescence quantum yields , we incidentally obtained a unique mutant protein , s334g in which ser334 was replaced with gly .
this replacement resulted in significant improvement in expression yield of bv - binding holoproteins in e. coli ( figure 4a ) .
colonies were picked up and grown in small - scale culture .
cell pellet of e. coli expressing only the wild type protein showed brown color typical of normal e. coli .
cell pellet of e. coli expressing both the wild type protein and the heme oxygenase showed pale green color .
on the other hand , cell pellet of e. coli expressing both the s334g protein and the heme oxygenase showed deep green color .
the bv - binding s334g ( s334g - bv ) showed reversible photoconversion between pfr at 699 nm and po at 611 nm ( figure 4b ) .
its po form is about 7 nm blue - shifted than that of the wild type .
binding efficiency to bv was calculated to be 1.25 - fold higher than that of the wild type protein ( see evaluation of chromophore binding efficiencies ) .
in total , judging from the pfr absorption peak , recovery of the s334g - bv was about five - fold higher than that of the bv - binding wild type from the same culture volume .
although gly317 of anpixjg2 corresponding to ser334 of am1 _ c0023g2 does not directly interact with pcb , gly317 is placed 4 residues upstream of cys321 that covalently ligates to pcb ( narikawa et al. , 2013 ) .
this replacement may indirectly affect chromophore - binding pocket to facilitate protein expression and chromophore incorporation .
apart from the underlying mechanism , we consider that s334g - bv is a good platform for further development of optogenetic switches .
slow dark recovery kinetics and almost full photoconversion ( 90 % estimated from the absorption spectra ) are favorable for long - term and acute regulation .

( b ) absorption spectra of the pfr and po forms of s334g - bv. chromophore species and configuration acid - denatured spectra proved that am1 _ c0023g2 isolated from pcb - producing e. coli undoubtedly bound pcb ( figure 5 ) .
absorption maximum of denatured pr and pg were observed at 665 and 603 nm , respectively ( figures 5a,b ) .
irradiation of denatured pg with white light resulted in red shift of the absorbance that is almost identical to that of denatured pr , whereas irradiation of denatured pr with white light resulted in no significant change ( figures 5a,b ) .
pr - minus - pg difference spectrum fits to that during photoconversion of denatured pg ( figure 5c ) .
these results clearly show that pr and pg bound 15z - and 15e - pcb , respectively .
figure 5 acid denaturation of am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb .

( c ) pr - minus - pg difference spectrum ( pr - pg , magenta ) and that during photoconversion of denatured pg ( pg l - d , blue ) .
acid - denatured spectra of am1 _ c0023g2 isolated from bv - producing e. coli showed completely different spectra ( data not shown ) compared with previously reported data ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
in order to monitor initial spectral change after denaturation , we denatured samples under 4degreesc and their absorption spectra were measured at 15degreesc at 0 , 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 min .
subsequently absorption spectra during white light illumination ( 1 , 3 , 5 , and 10 min ) were recorded .
absorption maximum just after denaturation of pfr form was observed at ~ 700 nm ( figure 6a ) , which corresponded to 15z - bv previously reported ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
absorption maximum after denaturation of po form was observed at ~ 660 nm ( figure 6b ) with a red - shift compared with 15e - bv as reported earlier .
because photoconversion from pfr to po is incomplete ( figure 2b ) , the residual pfr may affect the absorption peak of denatured po resulting in red shift to ~ 660 nm. figure 6 acid denaturation of am1 _ c0023g2 - bv .
( a ) absorption spectra of acid - denatured am1 _ c0023g2 - bv pfr during dark and light processes .
( b ) absorption spectra of acid - denatured am1 _ c0023g2 - bv po during dark and light processes .
( c ) difference spectrum during dark and light processes of denatured pfr ( magenta ) , during dark and light processes of denatured po , and of pfr - minus - po just after denaturation ( green ) .
( d ) normalized absorption spectra and difference spectrum of acid - denatured am1 _ c0023g2 - bv pfr and po after dark and light processes .
the ~ 700 nm peak observed for pfr ( denatured ) decreased during dark and light processes and final absorption spectrum was at ~ 665 nm ( figure 6a ) .
difference spectrum during these processes showed a negative peak at ~ 714 nm ( figure 6c , pfr w10 - pfr d0 ). from these results , we hypothesized that 15z - bv just after denaturation rapidly converts to an unknown state ( x ) at 665 nm. on the other hand , absorption after po denaturation slightly decreased under dark process and largely decreased under light process ( figure 6b ) .
the decrease under dark process may correspond to conversion from the residual pfr to the unknown state " x " .
the decrease under light process may correspond to conversion from po to " x " via pfr .
based on the above - mentioned hypothesis , in the case of both pfr denaturation and po denaturation , their final products after dark and light processes should be composed of only " x " .
indeed , absorption spectra of both denatured pfr and po after 10 min white light illumination are at 665 nm and almost same ( figure 6d ) , which strongly supports this hypothesis .
pfr - minus - po difference spectrum just after denaturation showed a positive peak around ~ 714 nm and a negative peak around ~ 614 nm ( figure 6c , pfr d0 - po d0 ) .
these wavelengths well correspond to those obtained from the difference spectrum of denatured am1 _ 1557g2 ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
thus , the positive peak around 714 nm corresponds to 15z - bv , whereas the negative peak around 614 nm corresponds to 15e - bv. however , a negative component around 745 nm was detected .
based on the above - mentioned hypothesis in which the denatured 15z - bv rapidly converts into " x " , 15e - bv from denatured po should be more abundant than 15z - bv from denatured pfr .
in such situation , absorption tail of 15e - bv around 745 nm should be larger than that of 15z - bv , and the difference spectrum should show the minus component around 745 nm. difference spectrum during light and dark processes of denatured po showed negative peaks at ~ 714 and ~ 614 nm ( figure 6c , po w10 - po d0 ) .
these wavelengths also correspond to 15z - bv and 15e - bv , respectively .
major negative peak at ~ 614 nm is likely to correspond to conversion from 15e - bv to " x " via 15z - bv , whereas minor negative peak at ~ 714 nm is likely to correspond to conversion from 15z - bv originated in the residual pfr to " x " .
taking the possibility into consideration that the bv chromophore bound to am1 _ c0023g2 is unstable under acidic condition , we denatured the am1 _ c0023g2 - bv under neutral urea condition .
however , the denatured chromophore was also unstable and its absorption was rapidly bleached ( data not shown ) .
the result suggests that urea is crucial for the chromophore instability .
thus , we denatured the am1 _ c0023g2 - bv pfr under 1 % sds as previously described ( ishizuka et al. , 2007 ) .
as a result , its absorption maxima was observed at ~ 646 nm and almost same as that of am1 _ 1557g2 - bv pfr ( figures 7a,b ) , indicating that their chromophores are both bv. to further confirm the result , we performed in vitro reconstitution analysis using s334g protein and bv chromophore .
although reconstitution efficiency was low , bv covalently bound to s334g was detected by in - gel fluorescence analysis ( figure 7c , inset ) .
far - red / orange reversible photoconversion was observed ( figure 7c ) and is almost same as that observed for in vivo reconstituted one ( figure 7d ) .
as a conclusion , the chromophore of am1 _ c0023g2 expressed in bv - producing e. coli is indeed bv. figure 7 denaturation with 1 % sds and in vitro reconstitution .

bv chromophore instability in the presence of urea although am1 _ c0023g2 binds bv as well as the other bv - binding cbcrs and bacteriophytochromes , bv derived from only am1 _ c0023g2 showed unstable nature in the presence of urea .
very recently , shcherbakova et al .
( 2015 ) obtained a fluorescent protein that consists of pas and gaf domain originally derived from a bacteriophytochrome , rpbphp1 ( shcherbakova et al. , 2015 ) .
the fluorescent protein , bph1 - fp , covalently binds bv via cys residue within the gaf domain .
the crystal structure revealed that covalent - bonding site of bph1 - fp to bv is heterogeneous , namely c31 or c32 .
this means that a cys residue within the gaf domain has a potential to ligate to both c31 and c32 .
in this context , we hypothesized that the cys residue of am1 _ c0023g2 ligates to c31 and the resultant adduct between the cys residue and c31 of bv may affect stability of the denatured chromophore in the presence of urea , whereas cys residues of am1 _ 1557g2 and am1 _ 1870g3 are likely to ligate to c32 of bv as well as normal bacteriophytochromes and the resultant chromophore may be stable under the same condition .
just after denaturation of pfr form , a component corresponding to bv and at 700 nm rapidly converts into a component at 665 nm. this characteristic in absorbing around 665 nm is somehow similar to that of pcb .
in this context , bv bound to am1 _ c0023g2 may break down into pcb - like chromophore in the presence of urea .
urea may affect conjugated system of bv bound to am1 _ c0023g2 .
in order to verify these hypotheses , we are now trying to crystalize both am1 _ 1557g2 - bv and am1 _ c0023g2 - bv. evaluation of chromophore binding efficiencies we calculated binding efficiencies of am1 _ c0023g2 to pcb and bv at ~ 80 and ~ 70 % , respectively .
based on these values and in - gel fluorescence analysis ( figure 1b ) , we also estimated the binding efficiencies of am1 _ 1557g2 to pcb and bv at ~ 50 and ~ 40 % , respectively .
the binding efficiencies of am1 _ c0023g2 to both pcb and bv are higher than those of am1 _ 1557g2 .
the binding efficiency of s334g to bv was calculated to be almost 100 % , which is better than that of the wild type protein (~ 70 %) .
binding efficiency of am1 _ c0023g2 to pcb is comparable to or slightly higher than that to bv. in this context , it is intriguing that no bv - binding holoproteins were detected from pcb - producing e. coli despite that bv should be present as a precursor .
bv may be kept at quite low concentration in the pcb - producing e. coli via substrate - channeling from heme oxygenase to pcya .
fluorescence spectroscopy room temperature fluorescence spectra of the thermostable forms of am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb and am1 _ c0023g2 - bv were measured to evaluate their potentials as fluorescent imaging probes ( figure 8 ) .
am1 _ c0023g2 - bv pfr form fluoresces with a maximum at 718 nm , whereas am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb pr form fluoresces with a maximum at 679 nm. the fluorescence maximum of am1 _ c0023g2 - bv pfr is red - shifted by 39 nm compared with that of am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb pr , a red shift similar to that found for their absorption spectra maxima .
fluorescence quantum yields of the pr and pfr forms were 3.0 and 0.2 % , respectively .
fluorescence quantum yield of am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb pr is about two times higher than that of am1 _ 1557g2 - pcb pr ( narikawa et al. , 2015b ) .
figure 8 fluorescence spectra of am1 _ c0023g2 - bv pfr ( magenta ) and am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb pr ( blue ) .
expression of am1 _ 1557g2 and am1 _ c0023g2 in mammalian cells we examined the fluorescence of am1 _ 1557g2 - pcb and am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb in live mammalian cells .
to precisely compare the fluorescence intensities of the cbcrs , we fused gfp to the cbcrs as an expression control ( figure 9a ) .
hela cells were transfected with gfp - fused am1 _ 1557g2 and am1 _ c0023g2 and treated with or without 20 mum pcb .
confocal fluorescence images of gfp - fused am1 _ 1557g2 - pcb and am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb show bright green fluorescence of gfp , indicating that both gfp - fused am1 _ 1557g2 and am1 _ c0023g2 were successfully expressed in the mammalian cells ( figure 9b upper left and right ) .
almost the same brightness of gfp indicates that the expression levels of gfp - fused am1 _ 1557g2 and am1 _ c0023g2 were similar ( figure 9b upper left and right ) .
no near - infrared fluorescence was detected from both cells without addition of pcb ( figure 9c ) .
low fluorescence quantum yield and / or low intrinsic bv level may be the reason for this result .
on the other hand , the near - infrared fluorescence was detected from both cells after exposure to pcb .
the near - infrared fluorescence of am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb was much higher than that of am1 _ 1557g2 - pcb ( figure 9b lower right and left ) .
relative intensities of am1 _ 1557g2 - pcb and am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb normalized to gfp intensities were 0.31 +/ - 0.10 and 0.49 +/ - 0.17 , respectively ( figure 9c ) .
this is the first report detecting fluorescence from pcb - binding cbcrs expressed in the mammalian cells .
their quantum yields are not so high , but comparable to those of the native phytochromes and cbcrs ( sineshchekov , 1995 ; chen et al. , 2012 ; rockwell et al. , 2012c ; pennacchietti et al. , 2015 ) .
thus , we can consider that am1 _ c0023g2 - pcb is appropriate for platform of fluorescent probe development as a starting material .

background fibrosis is a major contributor to systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) - related morbidity , and rapid , progressive skin involvement predicts later mortality .
western medicine therapies for ssc cannot produce satisfactory effects currently , while traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) , such as the wenyang huazhuo tongluo ( wyhztl ) formula , a chinese herbal decoction , has shown amazing anti - fibrosis efficacy on ssc in clinical applications .
this study is aiming to investigate the anti - fibrotic mechanism of wyhztl formula for the treatment of ssc .
methods fibroblasts from primary culture of skin lesions of ssc patients were exposed to rat medicated sera containing wyhztl or xav939 , a small - molecule inhibitor of both tankyrase 1 / 2 and wnt / beta - catenin pathway .
cell counting kit - 8 assay and annexin v fitc / pi apoptosis kit were used to analyze cell proliferation and apoptosis in fibroblasts , respectively .
reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) and western blotting were used to detect the mrna and protein levels of cyclin d1 and survivin .
results after 28 , 48 and 72 h of incubation , the proliferative ability of the fibroblasts cells was obviously reduced by the sera containing wyhztl compared with that in the control group ; the percentage of apoptotic cell population in the sera containing wyhztl treated fibroblasts cells was significantly higher than that in those treated with the control sera , and was about similar to that in those treated with xav939 .
the sera containing wyhztl could down - regulate both mrna and protein levels of cyclin d1 and survivin , compared with the control group .
conclusions the present study demonstrates the antiproliferative and pro - apoptotic actions of wyhztl formula against fibroblasts and the effect may be related to the down - regulation of mrna and protein levels of cyclin d1 and survivin in ssc .
keywords wenyang huazhuo tongluo formula systemic sclerosis anti - fibrosis survivin cyclin d1 http :// dx.doi.org / 10.13039 / 501100001809national natural science foundation of china ( cn ) 81373627 bian hua issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background systemic sclerosis ( ssc ) is an autoimmune and / or autoinflammatory disease mainly characterized by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix ( ecm ) , especially as collagen , and by extensive fibrosis in skin and eventually in multiple internal organs , such as lung , heart , esophagus and kidney [ 1 ] .
genetic factors , infection and unknown environmental influences may play roles in the pathogen of the disease .
however , the exact initiating events that lead to the disease remain unclear .
immune dysfunction , vascular damage , abnormal metabolism of connective tissue and a complex interaction of them are thought to be involved in ssc .
fibrosis is a major contributor to the disease related morbidity , and rapid , progressive skin involvement predicts later mortality [ 2 ] .
western medicine therapies mainly include immunosuppressive agents , vasoactive drugs and connective tissue formation inhibitors .
however , the clinical effects of these therapies are of questionable significance currently , such as methotrexate and cyclophosphamide [ 3 , 4 ] .
considering the unsatisfactory effect of current therapies for ssc , it would be desirable to have novel drugs / therapies .
traditional chinese medicine ( tcm ) has a long history of dealing with diseases and evolved over the past two and a half millennia to become the second largest health - care system in the world , after modern western medicine .
in the past few years , much research has focused on the molecular mechanisms of tcms to treat different diseases , for example , shuang kou et al .
[ 5 ] reported that zuo - gui and you - gui pills exerted neuroprotective effects by downregulation of nogoa , ngr , and rhoa pathways in rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis .
some effective tcm formulas have also been found to treat ssc through acting on certain molecular targets .
yan et al .
[ 6 ] reported that wenyang chubi decoction had the effects in decreasing the connective tissue growth factor and collagen - i expression and improving the skin fibrosis in a mouse model of ssc .
yiqihuoxue formula was found to effectively reduce collagen production via down - regulating the phosphorylation of smad3 and then the activity of smad binding element , which are involved in the tgf - beta pathway and constitutively activated in the progression of ssc [ 7 ] .
wenyang huazhuo tongluo ( wyhztl ) is a patented formula ( no .
cn201310351880.2 ) to treat ssc owned by our team , and has shown the efficacy of anti - fibrosis in clinical applications .
our previous studies proved that it exerts its therapeutic effect on ssc patients by regulating th17 / treg imbalance , lowering levels of von willebrand factor ( vwf ) and aminoterminal propeptide of type iii procollagen ( piiinp ) , and elevating the level of cross - linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type i collagen ( i ctp ) [ 8 ] .
we also reported that the formula antagonizes the fibrosis in a mouse ssc model through its regulation of tgf - beta1 / smad signal pathway and the reduction of collagen content [ 9 ] .
we also have demonstrated that the sera containing wyhztl reduces the expression levels of collagen i / iii through regulating some key signal molecules , such as tgf - beta1 receptor i , p - smad2 / 3 , smad7 , in tgfbeta1 / smad signaling pathway of skin fibroblasts obtained from ssc patients [ 10 ] .
in another report , we found the sera containing wyhztl inhibits the proliferation of ssc skin fibroblasts via blocking the cell cycle transition from the g1 to s phase [ 11 ] , but the exact mechanism is still unclear .
therefore , further study on the role of wyhztl in fibrosis of ssc is needed .
it 's known that the cell cycle transition from the g1 to s phase is regulated by cyclin d1 , and cyclin d1 activation promotes the passage of cells through the g1 restriction checkpoint [ 12 , 13 ] .
apoptosis is a key mechanism involved in fibrosis of ssc [ 14 ] , and survivin is an inhibitor of apoptotic protein gene family and a cell cycle regulator , it is critically required for suppression of apoptosis and ensuring normal cell division in the g2 / m phase of the cell cycle [ 15 ] .
in order to address the anti - fibrotic mechanism of wyhztl formula in treating ssc , a novel seropharmacology method arising recent years for pharmacological study is taken to study tcm in vitro using animal - medicated sera [ 16 ] .
the essence of seropharmacology is to administrate tcm to experimental animals ( generally are rabbits or rats ) , followed by harvesting animal sera after a period of time .
then the sera are applied to different cell lines for molecular mechanism study .
the advantage of seropharmacology for tcm study is to use the real pharmaceutical ingredients or internal biological metabolic compounds of tcm , without isolating the individual components , which is neither difficulty nor necessary in some cases .
the aim of the present study is to investigate the mechanism of wyhztl formula against fibrosis in ssc regarding its effect on the expression and regulation of cyclin d1 and survivin in primary cultured human fibroblasts treated by the animal - mediated sera .

results analysis of the compounds absorbed into the blood after oral administration of wyhztl decoction in sd rats figure 1 shows the representative hplc profiles of the control rat sera and the rat medicated sera , respectively .
four distinct peaks can be detected in the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl compared with the control rat sera , which indicates that the rat medicated sera may contain active ingredients and / or metabolic components of the decoction. fig. 1 hplc profiles of the rat medicated sera after administrated by gavage of the wyhztl decoction .
a control rat sera ; b rat medicated sera after administrated by gavage 1 h. four distinctive peaks ( 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) are detected in the rat medicated sera , but not in the control rat sera .
this indicates that the rat medicated sera may contain active ingredients and / or metabolic components of the wyhztl decoction effect of rat medicated sera containing wyhztl on proliferation of fibroblasts in order to confirm the role of wyhztl formula in the proliferation of fibroblasts , the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl were added into the primary culture fibroblasts .
the morphology of the cells was observed directly under an inverted microscope .
in the control group , fibroblasts were numerous and having branched cytoplasm surrounding elliptical , speckled nucleus with two or more nucleoli .
most nucleoli were spindle and some were irregular , but all tended to be in the same direction .
after incubated with xav939 or the sera containing wyhztl , both the total cell and the irregular cells with multi - nucleoli decreased , the cell bodies , nucleoli and the branched cytoplasm were shorter , compared with those in the control group ( as shown in fig. 2a ) .
such results demonstrated that the sera containing wyhztl strongly implicated in cell morphology regulation and had inhibitory effect on proliferation in fibroblasts. fig. 2 effect of rat medicated sera containing wyhztl on proliferation of fibroblasts .
a cell morphology observation : cells cultured in dmem containing the sera were grown in the flask and viewed directly under the nikon phase contrast inverted microscopy ( 200x original magnification ; ti - s type , nikon co. , japan ) .

** p < 0.01 compared with each group the above evidence was further confirmed by cck - 8 assay .
after incubated with the rat medicated sera or xav939 for 28 , 48 and 72 h , the proliferative ability of the fibroblasts cells was markedly reduced and was significantly lower than that in the control group following the indicated time of incubation ( p < 0.01 ) , as shown in fig. 2b .
rat medicated sera containing wyhztl promotes apoptosis in fibroblasts in order to determine the effects of the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl on apoptosis in fibroblasts , viable , early apoptotic , and late apoptotic or necrotic cells can be distinguished by flow cytometry analysis using dual staining with annexin v / pi dyes .
as shown in fig. 3a , viable cells were pi and annexin v - fitc double negative ; apoptotic cells were annexin v - fitc positive and pi negative , whereas late apoptotic or necrotic cells were annexin v - fitc and pi double positive .
we observed a strong time - dependent relationship with regard to the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl or xav939 exposure and early apoptotic or late apoptotic cells ( fig. 3b , c ) .
the percentage of late apoptotic cell population in the sera containing wyhztl treated cells was clearly higher than that in those treated with the control sera and was slightly lower than that in those treated with xav939 ( p < 0.01 ) .
interestingly , the percentage of early apoptotic cell population in the sera containing wyhztl treated cells was clearly higher than that in those treated with xav939 ( p < 0.01 ) , which suggesting the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl promotes apoptosis , especially early apoptosis , in the fibroblasts .
this effect was also observed in xav939 treated cells. fig. 3 rat medicated sera containing wyhztl induces cell apoptosis in fibroblasts .

the results are the mean +/ - sd of 3 independent experiments effect of rat medicated sera containing wyhztl on cyclin d1 in fibroblasts in order to further explore the molecular mechanisms of the role of the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl , we focused on the recognized proliferation - associated gene cyclin d1 .
rt - pcr and western blotting were performed to determine the cyclin d1 mrna and protein levels after treated with the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl in fibroblasts .
as shown in fig. 4 , treated with the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl for 24 , 48 and 72 h led to a down - regulation of cyclin d1 mrna and protein expression compared with that in the control group ( p < 0.01 ) , in accordance with the effect of xav939 known to have inhibition action on cyclin d1 ( p > 0.05 ) .
these results indicated that the sera inhibited proliferation in fibroblasts through down - regulation of cyclin d1 in mrna and protein level. fig. 4 effect of down - regulation of cyclin d1 by the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl in fibroblasts .

as shown in fig. 5 , treating with the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl led to a down - regulation of survivin mrna and protein expression compared to the control group ( p < 0.01 ) .
the sera had a similar inhibitory effect on fibroblasts to xav939 although the former is weaker than the later ( p > 0.05 ) .
these results indicated that the sera promoted apoptosis in fibroblasts via down - regulation of survivin in both mrna and protein levels. fig. 5 effect of down - regulation of survivin by the rat medicated sera containing wyhztl in fibroblasts .

the results are the mean +/ - sd of at least 5 independent experiments discussion ssc is a chronic fibrosing connective tissue disease characterized by a higher mortality rate compared with other connective tissue diseases .
in early stages of ssc , the main pathological manifestations are perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and a reduced capillary density , whereas later stages are fibrosis characterized by an excessive accumulation of collagen - rich ecm .
the fibrosis disrupts the physiological structure of the affected tissues and interferes with proper organ function .
tissue fibrosis is the primary cause of ssc - related mortality presently and the 10 - year survival rate is as low as 54 % - 66 % [ 21 ] .
there is a high unmet clinical need for effective antifibrotic therapies in ssc , but no drugs have been clearly shown to be effective in reducing specifically the development of ssc fibrosis in clinic up to now [ 4 , 22 ] .
chinese medical treatment is aimed at adjusting the environmental and human influences through the use of tcm , which exerts a comprehensive effect on the diseases ; because the decoction is usually composed of several herbs or minerals according to the symptoms of patients .
wyhztl formula is composed of 10 herbs , among which radix astragali membranacei exerts an anti - fibrotic effect in rats induced by porcine serum via down - regulating pdgfr - beta , inhibiting hepatic stellate cells proliferation and mapk activation [ 23 ] .
one of the isolated constituents from herba glechomae longitubae , asiatic acid , inhibits tgf - beta1 - induced collagen and pai - 1 expression in keloid fibroblasts through ppar - gamma activation [ 24 ] ; radix dioscoreae oppositae attenuats ccl ( 4 ) - induced hepatic fibrosis in rats in a dose - dependent manner and the attenuation may be related to the antioxidant properties of radix dioscoreae oppositae [ 25 ] .
the ethanolic extract of capparis zeylanica linn was reported having anti - fibrotic effect via inhibiting the fibroblast proliferation and type i collagen production in ssc [ 26 ] .
however , the therapeutic action of a tcm formula is far more than that of the total sum of its components , it 's a very complicated process in vivo .
tcm formulas prescribed by doctors of chinese medicine are selected on the basis of the past experience with treating diseases and on the basis of the current health status of the individual patient .
not only do the symptoms of ssc vary from individual to individual , but also the health histories ( such as coexisting diseases or syndromes ) are different .
these factors must be accounted in determining suitable prescriptions .
thus , tcm approach is a comprehensive treatment based on individual needs .
known abnormalities in ssc that relate to the fibrotic response include fibroblast proliferation increased and apoptosis decreased [ 27 ] .
so one of treatment strategies for fibrosis in ssc is to inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis .
cyclins play an important role in cell progression of fibrosis , so the mrna and protein levels of cell cycle regulatory factor , cyclin d1 , were examined .
our results showed that incubation with wyhztl formula in fibroblasts caused a marked reduction of the mrna and protein levels of cyclin d1 , indicating its crucial for the g1 to s transition [ 12 , 13 ] and suppression of apoptosis [ 28 ] .
marsillach et al. reported that survivin expression is significantly increased during the development of fibrosis [ 29 ] .
consistently , sisson et al. reported that inhibition of survivin restores susceptibility of fibroblasts to fas - mediated apoptosis .
therefore , survivin may represent a potential target for anti - fibrotic therapies [ 30 ] .
additionally , survivin is critically required for suppression of apoptosis and ensuring normal cell division in the g2 / m phase of the cell cycle [ 15 ] .
our results showed that wyhztl formula incubation in fibroblasts also caused significant reduction of the mrna and protein levels of survivin .
we have reported that wyhztl formula has the effect of inhibition on proliferation of ssc skin fibroblasts via blocking the cell cycle transition from the g1 to s phase previously [ 11 ] .
therefore , our study suggested that wyhztl formula arrested the cell cycle in the phase by inhibiting cyclin d1 expression , and its anti - fibrosis effect related to inhibition of cylcin d1 and survivin .
xav - 939 is screened out as an inhibitor of wnt / beta - catenin pathway and demonstrates to stabilize the axin levels through inhibiting tankyrases , and consequently inhibits the wnt signaling and the expression of target genes , including survivin and cyclin d1 [ 31 ] .
aberrant wnt / beta - catenin signaling pathway due to gain of beta - catenin function , induces constitutive transcription of cyclin d1 [ 28 , 32 ] .
our results showed that the effect of wyhztl formula on survivin and cyclin d1 is consistent with that of xav939 , this further proves that the anti - fibrosis effect of the formula is related to the inhibition of cylcin d1 and survivin .
conclusions in summary , our study demonstrates the wyhztl formula has antiproliferative and pro - apoptotic actions on fibroblasts in ssc .
it also provides valuable information regarding the mechanism of repression of ssc fibrosis , and the effect may be related to the down - regulation of mrna and protein levels of cyclin d1 and survivin in ssc .
nevertheless , further studies on the other possible mechanisms of anti - fibrosis effect of wyhztl formula and on the actual active ingredients and / or biotransformed ingredients contributed to the anti - fibrosis effect of wyhztl are needed .

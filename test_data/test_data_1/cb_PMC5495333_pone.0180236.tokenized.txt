most predictive models and scores of graft survival in renal transplantation include factors known before transplant or at the end of the first year .
they cannot be updated thereafter , even in patients developing donor - specific anti - hla antibodies and acute rejection.we developed a conditional and adjustable score for prediction of graft failure ( adgfs ) up to 10 years post - transplantation in 664 kidney transplant patients .
adgfs was externally validated and calibrated in 896 kidney transplant patients.the final model included five baseline factors ( pretransplant non donor - specific anti - hla antibodies , donor age , serum creatinine measured at 1 year , longitudinal serum creatinine clusters during the first year , proteinuria measured at 1 year ) , and two predictors updated over time ( de novo donor - specific anti - hla antibodies and first acute rejection ) .
adgfs was able to stratify patients into four risk - groups , at different post - transplantation times .
it showed good discrimination ( time - dependent roc curve at ten years : 0.83 ( ci95 % 0.76 - 0.89 ) .

introduction scoring systems that predict survival outcome after kidney transplantation can help physicians improve risk stratification among recipients and make the best therapeutic decision for a patient who develops de novo donor - specific anti - human leucocyte antigen ( hla ) antibody ( dsa ) .
serum creatinine ( scr ) and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) are not sufficiently reliable predictors for long - term risk of graft loss or patient death [ 1 ] .
in the last decade , predictive models of graft survival based on large panels of data collected in the donor [ 2 ] , in the recipient before transplantation [ 3 ] , and / or in the first year post - transplantation [ 4,5 ] have been proposed .
a limitation of these models is that they do not take into account the onset of adverse events over time , which modify graft outcome .
in particular , these models never consider the impact of the development of de novo ( dn ) dsa beyond one year post - transplantation on graft outcome , although this has been demonstrated to be strongly associated with graft loss through antibody - mediated rejections [ 6,7 ] .
all the studies focusing on the impact of the development of de novo dsa on graft outcome have concluded that post - transplant dsa monitoring could improve prediction of individual risk for kidney allograft loss [ 5,8 ] .
the previously proposed tools were globally validated in patient cohorts but they often lost their predictive power in small patient subgroups with specific risks of graft failure , i.e. the patients who need them most .
development of a graft failure risk score is most often based on cox 's proportional hazards models ( eventually with time - dependent covariates ) to identify predictive risk factors [ 4,9,10 ] random survival forest ( rsf ) modeling is an alternative non - parametric method based on an ensemble tree method for the analysis of right censored survival data [ 11 ] .
rsf was found able to identify complex interactions among multiple variables and performed better than traditional cox proportional hazard model [ 12 ] .
other advantages of rsf are ( i ) insensitivity to noise brought by missing values or error data [ 11 ] and ( ii ) inclusion of an internal validation process [ 11 ] .
thus , rsf has been used in several risk models in cardiology [ 13 ] and oncology [ 14,15 ] .
a conditional scoring system may be more appropriate than the addition of weights as derived from cox model if the impact of a risk factor is different , whether or not it is associated with other factors .
finally , a prognostic tool that can be updated with comorbidity onset may be more powerful [ 16 ] .
the objective of the present study was to build ( using rsf ) and validate a new conditional risk - scoring system of graft failure up to ten years post - transplantation , taking into account onset of emerging risks over time such as development of dndsa .
our score highlights the impact of renal function during the first year and the evolution of the risk of graft loss with the onset of dndsa and acute rejection .
methods this study adheres to the declaration of istanbul .
database of the 819 transplantations performed at the university hospital of limoges ( france ) between december 1984 and december 2011 , 664 were included in the primary cohort ( development database ) .
a flow - chart showing patient selection is shown in fig 1 .
all 664 transplants studied came from heart - beating deceased donors and had a follow - up of at least one year after transplantation .
the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen consisted mainly of one calcineurin inhibitor ( cyclosporine or , since 2001 , tacrolimus ) associated with azathioprine ( until 1996 ) or mycophenolate mofetil ( after 1996 ) and corticosteroids ( generally stopped between 3 and 6 months post - transplantation ) .
all patients received induction therapy .
patient outcome was known for each patient at the date of the last follow - up. death was considered as a censored event when the recipient died with a functioning graft .
when graft function was not known on the exact date of death , the date of the last biological assessment before death was then considered as the censoring time .
usually , graft function was recorded a few days before death .
when patients died because of graft loss , death was considered as a graft failure .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0180236.g001 fig 1 flowchart showing selection of renal transplant patients .
donor , recipient and graft characteristics were collected from the cristal register ( from the french public agency " agence de la biomedecine ") .
samples for immunological analysis were available in the local biobank , declared to the ministry of health ( ndegrees dc - 2010 - 1074 ) .
at the time of transplantation , dna was systematically extracted from the cells of the spleen or lymph node of the donor .
dna ( storage 4degreesc ) and cells ( storage nitrogen ) were preserved for each donor .
sera of the patients were systematically preserved at - 20degreesc .
the study database was approved by the french informatics and liberty national commission ( cnil , registration number 1795293 ) .
anti - hla antibodies screening anti - hla - a , - b , - c , - dp , - dq , - dr antibodies were screened and identified using luminex ( r ) solid - phase assay ( one lambda labscreen assays ) in samples collected before transplantation and routinely after transplantation ( three , six , twelve months , once every year thereafter , and whenever clinically indicated ) .
results were expressed as median fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) .
mfi > 1000 was considered positive .
all sera tested using the complement dependent cytotoxicity method prior to the availability of luminex ( r ) technology in our center ( 2007 ) , were re - analyzed using luminex ( r ) .
as dq , dp and c hla typing was not previously systematically performed in our center , a molecular dna typing of donor and recipient was performed in case of detection by luminex ( r ) of an anti - hla - c , - dq or - dp antibody during the survey .
this procedure allowed to determine the specificity ( donor - specific or non donor - specific ) of the anti - hla antibody and to avoid bias in the determination of dsa .
dsa diagnosis prior to renal transplantation was an exclusion criterion for transplantation in our center .
patients in whom the luminex ( r ) reanalysis identified presence of dsa before transplantation ( n = 13 ) were excluded from the database studied .
cluster analysis of serum creatinine over the first year post - transplantation homogeneous subgroups of trajectories of serum creatinine measured within the first year post - transplantation were identified by a clustering method based on k - means , specifically designed to analyze longitudinal data and implemented in the ' kml ' r - package ( version 1.1.3 ) [ 17 ] .
this method does not require any assumption regarding the shape of the serum creatinine - time curves , contrary to model - based methods which fit the trajectories with a specific model ( e.g. linear , polynomial or exponential ) .
the optimal number of clusters was selected using the statistical criterion proposed by calinski and harabasz [ 18 ] .
identification of factors predictive of graft survival the impact of the following variables was investigated on graft survival : ( i ) donor characteristics ( age , cause of death - - cardiac , stroke or traumatic injuries - ) ; ( ii ) recipient demographic variables ( age at time of transplantation , gender ) ; ( iii ) transplantation characteristics [ time period of transplantation ( i.e. 1984 - 1993 , 1994 - 2003 or 2004 - 2011 ) , cold ischemia time , previous kidney transplantation ( s )] ; ( iv ) immunological variables ( hla - a , hla - b and hla - dr mismatches , pre - transplant anti - hla antibodies , source of anti - hla alloimmunization ( i.e. previous transplantation , pregnancy , blood transfusion ) , occurrence of de novo donor - specific and / or non - donor - specific anti - hla antibodies ( dndsa and dnndsa , respectively ) with the date of the first diagnosis ; ( v ) biological variables [ repeated measurements of serum creatinine ( mum ) over the first year post - transplantation , proteinuria ( g / l ) at one year post - transplantation ] ; ( vi ) clinical variables ( initial renal disease , date of first acute rejection diagnosis , date of return to dialysis , date of end of follow - up ) ; and ( vii ) immunosuppressive drugs administered .
patient ethnicity was not recorded since it is not authorized by french law .
rsf analysis was performed to select and rank the most predictive covariates of graft failure using the date of transplantation as time origin [ 11 ] .
rsf was implemented in the ' randomforestsrc ' r - package ( version 2.0.0 ) .
briefly , a rsf was generated by creating 1000 trees , each tree built on a randomly selected bootstrap sample ( using 63 % of the original data ) using a randomly selected subset of covariates .
each bootstrap sample excluded , on average , 37 % of the data , which were reserved for a test set called " out - of - bag " data ( oob ) .
rsf evaluated the change in prediction error attributable to each covariate .
the prediction error ( i.e. the percentage of patients misclassified ) was assessed with the harrell 's concordance index ( harrell 's c - index ) using oob data [ 19 ] .
the c - index was computed using an oob set constructed with the 1000 oob datasets provided by the 1000 bootstrap samples used in growing the forest .
the oob prediction error is defined as 1 minus harrell 's c - index [ 11 ] .
the prediction error ranges between 0 and 1 , where a value of 0.5 corresponds to a prediction no better than random guessing and a value of 0 reflects perfect accuracy .
the parameter " nsplit " used to specify random splitting was fixed at 3 .
the predictive performance of the studied variables was evaluated by their " variable importance " ( vimp ) , calculated by rsf .
vimp measures the change in prediction error for a forest grown with or without this variable .
variables selection was successively done by ( 1 ) fitting data by rsf and ranking all available variables and ( 2 ) iteratively fitting rsf by removing at each iteration a variable from the bottom of the positive variable importance ranking list .
the minimal combination of variables leading to the smallest " out - of - bag " prediction error rate , assessed by the harrell 's c - index , was selected .
a conditional survival tree [ 20 ] was subsequently drawn from the whole original dataset , using the most predictive variables selected from rsf [' party ' ( version 1.0 - 21 ) r - package ] .
prediction of graft failure score calculations were derived from both the vimp sourced from the final rsf model and the conditional survival tree .
the weight of each variable ( i.e. each risk factor ) was based on the ratio between its vimp and the vimp of the last predictive variable retained .
a same value of weight was allocated for variables split at the same tree - depth in the conditional survival tree .
the weighted risk score was calculated by adding the weights of the different risk factors within each branch of the conditional survival tree .
this strategy led to a score for each patient subgroup identified at each terminal node of the conditional survival tree .
time - dependent receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves with area under the curve ( auc ) for censored survival data were used to evaluate the discrimination of the developed score .
additional weights were attributed for variables not selected in the conditional survival tree but highly associated with graft survival in the rsf analysis , provided their inclusion improved the roc auc .
the weight of a factor could be increased if it allowed maximization of the roc auc at ten years post - transplantation .
the predictive performance of the developed score was evaluated by time - dependent sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( ppv ) and negative predictive value ( npv ) with their standard error , all estimated at several cutpoints , i.e. for different threshold score values and for different times after transplantation .
therefore , ' timeroc ' ( version 0.2 ) r package was employed using the kaplan - meier estimator of the censoring distribution .
baseline ( i.e. including variables available at one year post - transplantation ) and adjusted ( i.e. adding variables collected after one year post - transplantation ) scores were also compared using time - dependent roc auc .
external validation external validation of the developed score was performed in patients transplanted between 2002 and 2010 in two independent french transplantation centers ( chu tours n = 706 ; chu poitiers n = 190 ) .
as in the development cohort , patients with pre - transplant dsa were excluded .
all anti - hla antibodies screenings were performed using luminex ( r ) .
the validation database ( astre database ) was approved by the cnil ( authorization number dr - 2012 - 518 ) .
validation procedure included : recalculation of the scr clusters considering the external database only , calculation of the individual scores using the developed scoring system , determination of the time - dependent roc auc at ten years post - transplantation and calibration based on hosmer - lemeshow goodness - of - fit test adapted for survival data [ 21 ] .
the calibration evaluation consisted in comparing numbers of patients with graft failure expected and observed in the validation cohort using the calculation of the numbers of events based on kaplan - meier survival estimates which was by proposed by d'agostino - nam [ 22 ] .
in a first step , the number of graft failures observed in the validation cohort in different time - intervals ([ 0 - 2 [ , [ 2 - 4 [ , [ 4 - 6 [ , [ 6 - 8 [ , [ 8 - 10 ] years after transplantation ) were calculated for each risk group as the product ni ( 1 - kmi ( t )) where kmi is the kaplan - meier survival estimate at a fixed time t for groupi and ni the number of observations in groupi .
the survival probabilities expected in the validation cohort were calculated using the kaplan - meier estimates obtained in the development cohort. with this test , the p value has to be higher than 0.05 .
statistical analyses the study used a conditional approach to determine a patient risk - stratification with several (> 2 ) levels of risk of graft failure .
an estimated 616 patients were needed for a power of 80 % and a two - sided significance level of 5 % .
based on published data and expert opinion , we assumed ( i ) a 10 - years free graft failure survival of 82 % in the studied population of renal transplant patients and ( ii ) that kidney function one year after the transplantation and occurrence of de novo dsa over time will be major discriminant parameters to classify the patients in the different risk levels .
we hypothesized that 25 % of the studied patients would have an impaired renal function one year after transplantation ( i.e a serum creatinine concentration higher than 1.8 mg / dl ( 160 mumol / l ) [ 1 ]) resulting in 10 - years free graft failure survival being decreased to 70 % .
in agreement with wiebe et al .
[ 23 ] we hypothesized cumulative incidence of de novo dsa of 15 % resulting in a 10 - years free graft failure survival decreased to 60 % and to 40 % in the groups with a serum creatinine concentration lower than 160 mumol / l and higher than 160 mumol / l , respectively .
acute rejection being a known major risk factor of graft failure in patients with dsa [ 24 ] , we considered that around 33 % of the patients with dsa would have developed acute rejection and that their graft survival would be reduced to 25 % .
comparison between categorical data was done using the pearson chi - square test or the exact fisher test .
normally distributed data were analyzed by anova and the parametric t - test , whereas nonparametric tests ( kruskall - wallis and mann - whitney tests respectively ) were used otherwise .
kaplan - meier analysis was used to assess graft survival ( graft loss , i.e. return to dialysis ) .
graft survival in different patient subgroups was compared using the log rank test .
statistical analyses were performed with medcalc for windows , version 14.10.2 .
( medcalc software , ostend , belgium ) and r version 2.15.1 ( www.r - project.org ) .

m12 = month 12 post - transplantation .
na not appropriate during the whole study period , 137 patients have been treated for a first acute rejection among them 122 ( 89 %) were biopsy proven .
one hundred nine first rejections occurred during the first year post - transplantation .
borderline rejection was evidenced in 36 patients and t - cell mediated rejection ( tcmr ) in 105 patients , antibody - mediated rejection ( abmr ) in 14 patients and mixed ( abmr + tcmr ) in three patients .
only two patients displayed abmr criteria on a biopsy done before the definition of abmr in the banff classification .
during follow - up , dndsa were present in 62 patients .
the median time to dndsa diagnosis was significantly lower in patients who exhibited pretransplant ndsa than in patients who did not ( 1.42 vs 4.87 years , p = 0.0012 ) .
sixty - four percent of patients with dndsa ( n = 39 ) had class ii antigens , 34 % ( n = 21 ) had class i and 2 % ( n = 2 ) had both class i and ii antigens .
nearly all patients who developed dndsa after transplantation had previously ( n = 19 ) or concomitantly ( n = 36 ) developed dnndsa .
except for one patient who presented dndsa transiently ( i.e. , detected at 1.6 years after transplantation and absent at subsequent screenings ) , dsa remained persistent at all screenings following the first detection .
thirteen patients with dndsa returned to dialysis , including six within the year following the diagnosis of dndsa ( median 1.04 years , range : 0.03 - 4.46 ) .
eleven out the 17 patients with abmr on histology had developed dndsa .
scr profiles over the first year post - transplantation were best partitioned in three clusters ( fig 2 ) .
graft survival after transplantation was significantly different in these three subgroups ( p < 0.0001 ) ( fig 2 ) .
the percentage of donors over 60 years of age increased from cluster a to c ( 29 [ 7.7 %] , 57 [ 23.4 %] , and 19 [ 44.2 %] , respectively , p < 0.0001 ) .
the mean cold ischemia time was significantly higher in cluster c than in clusters a and b , p = 0.034 ) .

identification of factors predictive of graft survival after the first year post - transplantation the classification of the variables according to their out - of - bag importance in the full rsf model is illustrated in the fig 3 .
the best model was obtained using the log rank splitting rule with 1000 trees with a harrell 's concordance error rate of 21 % ( standard deviation 0.2 %) ( fig 3 ) .
this final model included five baseline variables ( pretransplant ndsa , donor age , scr measured at 12 months post - transplantation ( scrm12 ) , scr clusters , proteinuria measured at m12 ( protm12 )) , and two predictors which could be updated during the follow - up of the graft ( onset of dndsa and first acute rejection whatever the time of onset after transplantation ) .

the log - rank splitting rule was used .
the partial plots of graft survival , predicted in the rsf analysis using the retained continuous variables ( after adjusting for all other predictors ) showed decreased survival when donor age exceeds 60 years , and very steep survival curves when scrm12 > 150 mum , so that small increments in scrm12 would result in large survival declines ( fig 4 ) .

adjustable graft failure score ( adgfs ) for prediction of graft survival a scoring system was constructed using conditional survival tree analysis , with nodes corresponding to the variables selected in the final rsf model .
the tree identified height terminal nodes , corresponding to height patient subgroups ( fig 5 ) .
the hierarchical order of the variables in predicting graft survival provided by the conditional survival tree was in accordance with the variable ranks obtained by rsf analysis .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0180236.g005 fig 5 conditional inference tree applied for graft survival with predicted kaplan - meier curves in the terminal nodes .
the tree was obtained using recursive partitioning for censored response in a conditional inference framework implemented in ' party ' r - package .
our scoring system , named adgfs ( adjustable graft failure score ) , is shown in fig 6 .
adgfs outperformed the baseline score including predictors available at one year after transplantation ( time - dependent roc auc at ten years : 0.83 ( ci95 % 0.76 - 0.89 ) vs 0.75 ( ci95 % 0.68 - 0.82 ) , p = 0.0075 ) .
taking into account onset of dndsa and first acute rejection developed over time , after one year post - transplantation improved survival prediction beyond 5 years post - transplantation ( p = 0.0244 ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0180236.g006 fig 6 scoring system for computing adgfs values .
scrm12 = serum creatinine at 12 months post - transplantation .
protm12 = proteinuria at 12 months post - transplantation .
scr = serum creatinine .
dndsa = de novo donor - specific anti - hla antibodies .
ndsa = non donor - specific anti - hla antibodies .
adgfs values are reported for each patient subgroup in fig 5 .
table 2 presents , for the different cutpoints of adgfs values , the performance characteristics of graft survival prediction at different post - transplantation times .
for example , a patient with low score ( adgfs = 2 ) has a probability of graft survival up to 10 years post - transplantation of approximately 94.5 % ( npv ) .
onset dndsa during the follow - up increased the score value ( adjusted score = 6 ) and led to a probability of graft loss of 64.9 % at 8 years and 83.6 % at 10 years post - transplantation ( ppv ) ( table 2 ) .
probabilities of graft survival lower than 20 % ( ppv > 80 %) at ten years post - transplantation were obtained for score values of 6 and more .
risk groups were defined according to the adgfs value : low risk ( 0 ) , intermediate risk ( 2 - 4 ) , high risk ( 6 - 8 ) , and very high risk ( 10 - 12 ) .
ten years graft survival was significantly different between these four risk groups ( p < 0.0001 ) ( fig 7 ) .

patients were partitioned according to the calculated score value : low risk ( 0 ) , intermediate risk ( 2 or 4 ) , high risk ( 6 or 8 ) , and very high risk ( 10 or 12 ) .

the test was considered as positive when adgfs score > cutpoint and negative when score was <= cutpoint .
time dependent sensitivity ( se ) , specificity ( sp ) positive predictive value ( ppv ) and negative predictive value ( npv ) were computed with standard error ( se ) at the six given cutpoints : 0 and 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 for different censored post - transplantation times .
adgfs could be calculated in 657 patients , 7 patients were secondarily excluded due to missing data .
external validation of adgfs table 1 reports the characteristics of the patients .
graft survival within each risk group was similar in the development and external validation datasets ( fig 7 ) .
the accuracy of the score at predicting graft failure remained high in the validation dataset , with a time - dependent roc auc of 0.79 ( ci 95 % 0.74 - 0.84 ) at ten years after transplantation .
results of calibration evaluation of adgfs in the external dataset were good : observed numbers of patients with graft failure were close to the expected numbers using the adgfs risk groups (( chi2 = 2.39 , p = 0.30 ) ( table 3 ) .

chi - squared = 2.39 ( p = 0.30 ) with 2 degrees of freedom .
the number of patients with graft failure expected in the validation cohort for the four different risk groups was calculated using the kaplan - meier survival estimates obtained in the development cohort .
discussion in the present work , we developed and externally validated a conditional and adjustable predictive score ( named adgfs ) of long - term kidney graft failure including pre - transplantation , early post - transplantation predictors and two factors collected all along the patients' follow - up : onset of dndsa and first acute rejection episodes .
all the items included in the score are available everywhere in the day - to - day clinical surveillance of the patients .
this score can be calculated from one year post - transplantation and updated all along the evolution of the graft depending on the occurrence of dndsa and acute rejection .
the calibration and discrimination of this score were good in large cohorts of patients treated with the current standard of care .
all previously published scores are computed using only individual factors known before the end of the first year post - transplantation .
they are never updated , even if the patient 's prognosis is altered .
the performance of these scores is usually evaluated with respect to shorter term graft survival and at a single time point [ 3 - 5,10,25 ] .
in this study , we used the non - parametric rsf method which has several advantages compared to regression approaches among which it does not test the goodness of fit of data to a hypothesis , but seeks a model that explains the data [ 26 ] .
most of the baseline predictors selected for the calculation of adgfs , are well - accepted graft failure risk factors [ 3,4,9,10,27 ] .
renal function in the first year post - transplantation was found to be predictive of graft survival at 3 , 5 [ 28,29 ] and 8 years post - transplantation [ 4 ] .
proteinuria has also recently been associated with graft failure in a cohort of 1518 patients [ 30 ] .
the cut - off points for scr and proteinuria defined in order to maximize time - dependent roc auc , are in accordance with previously published values [ 30 ] .
comparison between a score calculated with the baseline parameters included in adgfs ( i.e. the variables collected up to one year post - transplantation ) and adgfs ( i.e. adding variables collected after one year post - transplantation ) demonstrated the added value of taking into account follow - up data beyond one year post - transplantation .
the present study confirmed the deleterious role of donor age and its link with scr [ 2,31 ] .
donor age above 60 years was retained in different donor quality scoring systems [ 32 ] and was also associated with graft outcome after acute abmr [ 33 ] .
in the present study , two other baseline predictors were identified : scr cluster and pretransplant ndsa .
longitudinal scr clusters , assessing the scr time - profiles along the first year , have never been used before in predictive model of graft failure .
clustering adds information to the use of single or repeated measurement ( s ) of biological or clinical markers .
herein , it revealed patient subgroups with homogenous scr time - profiles .
this approach is in line with fda guidance to better differentiate phenotypes of patients ( http :// www.fda.gov / downloads / drugs / guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation / guidances / ucm458485.pdf ) .
for future studies , we propose a graphical tool dedicated to allocating new patients in the clusters ( s1 fig ) .
no previously proposed score takes into account onset of dndsa beyond one year post - transplantation and their impact on graft survival [ 5,6,34,35 ] .
our study , finding a cumulative incidence of 9.3 % of dndsa and a 24 % rate of graft failure at 3 years after the onset of dndsa , is in accordance with previous studies showing a 5 - year post - transplantation cumulative incidence of dndsa from 5.5 to 20 % [ 6,23 ] , a 7 to 9 % risk of graft failure in the first year after the occurrence of dndsa , and up to 24 % of patients with chronic abmr and renal failure within 3 years post - dsa [ 6,24 ] .
adgfs is the first score to include new - onset dndsa to predict graft survival .
the inclusion of dndsa requires an adjustable approach since they may appear at any time .
adgfs can be updated during patient follow - up in case of dndsa or acute rejection .
dndsa 's pathogenicity depends on their association with acute rejection , as previously found by cooper and colleagues [ 36 ] .
taking into account dndsa improved survival prediction beyond 5 years post - transplantation in accordance with published works highlighting that graft loss attributable to dndsa occurs several years after their onset [ 24 ] .
other factors classically reported to be associated with graft failure [ 4,27,32,37 ] , such as hla mismatches , cold ischemia , recipient gender , and immunosuppressive treatments , were not retained in the score because they did not allow a decrease in the error rate in the rsf analysis , and they did not improve the time - dependent roc auc .
this was explained by their significant association with the retained variables ( e.g increased cold ischemia time was associated with scr clusters ) .
contrary to published scores , adgfs predicted graft failure at different post - transplantation times up to ten years and stratified the patients into four risk groups .
kasiske and colleagues [ 9 ] evaluated only the 5 year risk of graft failure and the discriminatory ability of their scores remained modest as highlighted by the authors .
in the kidney transplant failure score , graft failure was evaluated at 8 years post - transplantation and patients were stratified into only two groups [ 4 ] .
the good results of our external validation in a population different with regards to time of transplantation and standard - of - care supported the robustness of adgfs .
assessment of the individual patient 's risk of transplant failure throughout the time after transplantation may be a decisive tool to select the optimal care strategy for the patient .
for instance , in the high risk group , specific treatments for dndsa might be questionable regarding the balance between the probability of maintaining a functioning graft and the side effects associated to these treatments .
the main strength of this study lies in the long follow - up and careful monitoring of anti - hla antibodies using a luminex ( r ) solid - phase assay , even for patients grafted before the year 2000 .
the database is one of the largest in which the impact of dndsa was analyzed .
our study has some limitations .
it included fewer patients than some previously published cohorts and was validated ( i ) beyond one year of transplantation , ( ii ) in deceased donors' grafts , and ( iii ) in patients without dsa at the time of transplantation .
thereby , adgfs can be cannot be calculated before one year post - transplantation neither in case of living donor nor in patients with dsa before transplantation .
in conclusion , we propose an adjustable score for risk stratification of graft failure at different post - transplantation times .
adgfs showed good discrimination and could be more useful than scores ignoring onset of dndsa , for decisions regarding more or less intensive surveillance and treatment of the patients .
supporting information s1 fig median ( 10th - 90th percentiles ) serum creatinine profiles over the first year post - transplantation for the three identified clusters , a , b and c. supplementary individuals can be allocated to a cluster using a graphical approach in which the individual serum creatinine values obtained at each visit are superimposed to the 10th - 90th percentiles interval of serum creatinine values obtained in the three clusters for the same times .
examples of predicted cluster for three different patients are shown .

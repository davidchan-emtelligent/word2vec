nationwide surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease has been conducted in germany since 1992. from 1992 to 2008 , a total of 12,137 isolates from invasive pneumococcal disease were collected .
data on serotypes were available for 9,394 invasive isolates .
the leading serotypes were serotypes 14 ( 16.5 %) , 3 ( 8.0 %) , 7f ( 7.6 %) , 1 ( 7.3 %) , and 23f ( 6.0 %) .
variations in serotype distribution over the years are particularly extensive , especially concerning serotype 14 ( min 7.4 % , max 33.5 %) with the highest percentages among the isolates serotyped from around 1997 to 2006 .
serotypes 1 and 7f increased over the last decade .
no increase was observed concerning serotype 19a .
higher pneumococcal conjugate vaccine coverages were observed among children ( 7v , 57.3 % ; 10v , 72.8 % ; 13v , 83.5 %) than among adults ( 7v , 39.9 % ; 10v , 55.5 % ; 13v , 73.5 %) .
the temporal variations in serotype distribution have to be kept in mind when interpreting vaccine coverages reported in epidemiological studies .
1. introduction streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important pathogens in bacterial pneumonia , sepsis , and meningitis worldwide [ 1 ] .
significant temporal [ 2 - 4 ] and regional [ 5 - 7 ] variations among pneumococcal serotypes have been described .
while the " epidemic " serogroups ( serogroups 1 - 3 and 5 ) decreased considerably in the united states during the last century , the serogroups included in the seven - valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( pcv7 ) increased clearly [ 2 ] .
a similar trend has been described in spain , where the prevalence of pcv7 serotypes increased significantly ( except serotype 4 ) since the start of the study in the early 1980s but then decreased considerably in the 2000s for all pcv7 serotypes except serotype 23f .
among the " epidemic " serotypes , a significant decrease of serotypes 1 and 5 has been observed in the 1980s followed by a significant increase in the late 1990s , while serotype 3 decreased continuously during the observational period .
furthermore , serotypes 6a , 7f , and 19a increased significantly since the late 1990s [ 4 ] .
the widespread use of antibiotics and the increasing application of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines ( a general recommendation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children < 2 years in germany was issued at the end of july 2006 ) will have an impact on future changes in serotype distribution .
the nrcs has conducted surveillance for invasive pneumococcal disease in germany since 1992 [ 8 ]. between 1992 and 1996 surveillance was based on a limited number of laboratories in germany on a voluntary basis [ 9 ] .
in 1996 , nationwide population - based surveillance of ipd in children was started [ 10 ] .
this surveillance system was extended to adults in one federal state ( north - rhine westphalia ) in 2001 [ 11 ] and successively broadened to nationwide surveillance until 2009 .
the aim of this study was to evaluate the serotype distribution of s. pneumoniae among the isolates with invasive pneumococcal disease ( ipd ) that were sent to the german national reference center for streptococci ( nrcs ) between 1992 and 2008 , analyze temporal trends , and calculate the vaccine coverages for the 7 - valent , 10 - valent , and 13 - valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines .
2. materials and methods 2.1 .
study design in this study data about invasive disease caused by streptococcus pneumoniae in children (< 16 years ) and adults (>= 16 years ) in germany were included using the data sources described above .
cases from january 1 , 1992 to december 31 , 2008 were included in this study .
a case of ipd was defined by the isolation of s. pneumoniae from a normally sterile site .
2.2 .
microbiological investigations isolates were identified using standard procedures including bile solubility and optochin sensitivity .
as a control strain , streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619 was used .
pneumococcal isolates were serotyped by the neufeld 's quellung reaction using type - and factor - specific antisera ( statens serum institut , copenhagen , denmark ) .
among isolates of adults , high levels of resistance were a main trigger for initiation of serotyping during the early years of this study .
since cross - reactive serotypes were not included in the calculation , coverage information strictly refers to the serotypes included in the vaccines .
serogroup 6 isolates were not tested with respect to serotype 6c .
3. results a total of 12,137 isolates from invasive pneumococcal disease were collected between january 1 , 1992 and december 31 , 2008 .
the total numbers of cases for each year varied between 297 and 2,037 cases ( median : 505 cases ) .
data on serotypes were available for 9,394 isolates ( 77.4 % of all invasive isolates ; 31.4 % children , 68.6 % adults ; 54.9 % male , 43.7 % female , 1.4 % no information on gender ) .
the serotype distribution of the years 1992 - 2008 is shown in table 1 ( a ) .
the leading serotypes were serotypes 14 ( 16.5 %) , 3 ( 8.0 %) , 7f ( 7.6 %) , 1 ( 7.3 %) , and 23f ( 6.0 %) .
concerning the epidemic serotypes 1 - 3 and 5 , a slight increase was noticed during the last years , reaching levels around 20 % among children and adults in 2008 ( figures 1 ( a ) - 1 ( c )) .
variations in serotype distribution over the years are partly extensive , especially concerning serotype 14 ( min 7.4 % , max 33.5 %) ( figure 2 ( a )) .
differences in serotype distribution among children and adults are shown in tables 1 ( b ) and 1 ( c ) .
the amount of serotyped isolates among all pneumococcal isolates sent to the nrcs in germany is shown in table 2 .
over the years the percentage of isolates serotyped increased continuously and in the last four years of the study almost all isolates were serotyped .
serotype 14 is considerably more frequent among children ( 22.5 %) than among adults ( 13.7 %) .
overall , an increase of serotype 14 can be noticed from around 1997 to 2006 ( figure 2 ( a )) .
a high percentage of serotype 14 isolates remain in existence for a longer time among children ( 1999 - 2006 , figure 2 ( b )) than among adults ( 1999 - 2001 , figure 2 ( c )) .
serotype 1 and serotype 7f have been clearly increasing over the last approximately 10 years , both among children and among adults .
while for children the percentage of serotypes 1 and 7f reach the highest values during this study in 2008 , among adults they are high , but still within the range already noted before ( figures 3 ( a ) - 3 ( c )) .
serotype 3 is far more common among adults ( 10.2 %) than among children ( 3.3 %) ( tables 1 ( b ) - 1 ( c )) .
the increase observed during the last years seems to be slightly higher among adults than among children ( figures 4 ( a ) - 4 ( c )) .
concerning serotype 19a no clear change in frequency can be observed during the period under study ( figures 4 ( a ) - 4 ( c )) .
variations in serotype distribution also affect theoretical vaccine coverages .
the overall serotype coverage for the 7 - valent conjugate vaccine was 45.4 % during 1992 - 2008 .
for the 10 - valent vaccine and the 13 - valent vaccine the overall coverages were 60.9 % and 76.6 % , respectively .
generally , higher coverages were observed among children ( 7v , 57.3 % ; 10v , 72.8 % ; 13v , 83.5 %) than among adults ( 7v , 39.9 % ; 10v , 55.5 % ; 13v , 73.5 %) .
among children , the coverage of the 7 - valent vaccine decreased from 64.2 % in 2005 to 24.6 % in 2008 ( figure 2 ( b )) , while for adults the coverage declined to a lesser extent ( 2005 , 45.9 % ; 2008 , 31.2 %) ( figure 2 ( c )) .
temporal changes of the additional 10 - valent and 13 - valent pneumococcal vaccine serotypes and the corresponding vaccine coverages are shown in figures 3 ( a ) - 3 ( c ) ( 10v ) and figures 4 ( a ) - 4 ( c ) ( 13v ) .
since the general recommendation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children < 2 years in germany at the end of july 2006 a percentage increase among the new ( 10v ) or upcoming ( 13v ) vaccine serotypes was noticed especially for serotypes 1 and 7f in children ( figure 3 ( b )) and for serotype 3 in adults ( figure 4 ( c )) .
in comparison , coverages of the 23 - valent polysaccharide vaccine are very similar among children ( min , 69.0 % ; max , 92.3 %) and adults ( min , 71.0 % ; max , 92.6 %) from 1992 to 2008 ( figure 5 ) .
4. discussion in this paper we present the results of 17 years of surveillance concerning serotypes of invasive pneumococcal disease in germany .
in the present study serotype 14 was the most prevalent serotype among children , followed in frequency by the serotypes 1 , 6b , 19f , 23f , and 7f , respectively .
these data are similar to those published for german children previously [ 12 , 13 ] and in line with data from england [ 14 ] , belgium [ 15 ] , and denmark [ 16 ] .
among adults , the most frequent serotypes were 14 , 3 , 7f , 1 , 4 , and 23f ( sorted in descending order ) .
these results are similar to a previous study from the nrcs among adults in north - rhine westphalia , germany , between 2003 and 2006 [ 17 ] , and are generally in line with results reported from other countries [ 6 , 15 , 18 - 20 ] ; however , they deviate in part from older german data [ 12 , 21 ] .
the variation of serotype 14 over the years is extensive in our study with an increased prevalence from about 1997 to 2006 , reaching maximum values in 2000 .
although the rate of serotyped isolates among adults was low from 1999 to 2001 ( 1999 , 22.9 % ; 2000 , 26.6 % ; 2001 , 38.6 %) , the increase seems plausible .
first , the increase among adults is paralleled by an increase among children , where nearly all isolates have been serotyped .
second , the rate of isolates serotyped among adults is within the range serotyped in the years before 1999 , where a similar increase of serotype 14 was not observed .
furthermore , similar data have been shown in a report from spain [ 4 ] .
also , a small rise in frequency of serotype 14 has been reported from denmark in 1995 - 1999 [ 16 ] , and data from england demonstrated a rise in incidence in 2000 and 2001 [ 14 ] .
the rise of serotypes 1 and 7f for nearly one decade is similar to results from spain [ 4 ] .
concerning serotype 19a , the highest prevalences were observed in 1996 ( 8.3 %) and 1998 ( 6.2 %) among children , and in 1999 ( 7.5 %) and 2000 ( 7.4 %) among adults .
although there seems to be a slight upward movement during the years 2002 to 2008 , the prevalences still are below the maximum values reported .
the increase of serotype 19a reported from other countries [ 4 , 22 , 23 ] has not been found in germany so far .
although changes in the incidence of different serotypes have been reported , the reasons for this are not fully understood [ 14 ] .
potential reasons discussed are changes in socioeconomic conditions , antibiotic use and resistance levels , immunocompromised status of populations , precise age distributions of the populations studied and increased life expectancy , and blood - culturing rates [ 2 , 6 , 24 ] .
since the general recommendation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children < 2 years in germany at end of july 2006 a reduction in the percentage of ipd caused by the 7 - valent vaccine serotypes was observed [ 25 ] .
this effect is more apparent among children , but also present among the adult population .
similar results have been reported from other countries [ 3 , 4 , 26 - 29 ] .
logically , the percentage decrease in vaccine serotypes is paralleled by a percentage increase in the amount of ipd caused by nonvaccine serotypes , which was most prominent for serotypes 1 and 7f in children and serotype 3 in adults in this study .
serotype coverage for the 7 - valent conjugate vaccine in germany was 45.4 % from 1992 to 2008 .
calculated coverages for the 10 - valent vaccine and 13 - valent vaccine are 60.9 % and 76.6 % , respectively .
these data are comparable to those previously reported [ 5 , 14 , 30 , 31 ] .
coverages of all three vaccine formulations in our study are approximately 15 % ( 7v , 17.4 % ; 10v , 17.3 % ; and 13v , 10.0 %) higher among children than among adults .
differences in age distribution among study populations are known to have a major impact on vaccine coverage of the current and proposed vaccines for different age groups and , furthermore , comparable data have been published [ 14 ] .
nevertheless , some factors and limitations must be regarded when interpreting the results of this study .
first of all , the isolates were sent by the participating laboratories on a voluntary basis , as participation in surveillance is not mandatory in germany .
furthermore , the systematic sampling of invasive isolates from adults ( 1992 ) and children ( 1997 ) was taken up at different points of time , and the included population - based studies in three german federal states started in 2001 ( north rhine - wesphalia ) and 2006 ( bavaria and saxony ) .
among isolates of adults , high levels of resistance were a main trigger for initiation of serotyping during the early years of this study .
therefore , the isolates may not be fully representative of all ipd in germany over the last two decades .
moreover , the structure of the surveillance project has been continousely improved over the 15 years and , in particular , after the general recommendation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children < 2 years in germany at the end of july 2006 an increased disease awareness by both clinical micobiologists and pediatricians was observed [ 32 ] .
ongoing nationwide surveillance is necessary to observe further developments of pneumococcal serotype distribution in germany .
acknowledgment the authors thank the microbiological laboratories in germany for their cooperation and for providing the isolates .

recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children , adolescents and adults are developed by the advisory committee on immunization practices ( acip ) .
acip is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the director of the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine - preventable diseases in the civilian population of the united states .
recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) , the american academy of family physicians ( aafp ) , and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( acog ) .
recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of aafp , acog , and the american college of physicians ( acp ) .
acip recommendations approved by the cdc director become agency guidelines on the date published in the morbidity and mortality weekly report ( mmwr ) .
additional information about acip is available at https :// www.cdc.gov / vaccines / acip .
in october 2017 , the advisory committee on immunization practices ( acip ) voted to approve the recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older , united states , 2018 .
the 2018 adult immunization schedule summarizes acip recommendations in two figures and a table of contraindications and precautions for vaccines recommended for adults , and is intended is to assist health care providers in implementing the current acip recommendations for vaccinating adults .
the schedule can be found at https :// www.cdc.gov / vaccines / schedules. * the full acip recommendations for each vaccine are available at https :// www.cdc.gov / vaccines / hcp / acip - recs / index.html .
the 2018 adult immunization schedule has also been approved by the american college of physicians ( https :// www.acponline.org ) , the american academy of family physicians ( https :// www.aafp.org ) , the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists ( https :// www.acog.org ) , and the american college of nurse - midwives ( http :// www.midwife.org ) .
the acip - recommended use of each vaccine is developed after an in - depth review of vaccine - related data , including data on disease epidemiology , vaccine efficacy and effectiveness , vaccine safety , feasibility of program implementation , and economic aspects of immunization policy ( 1 ) .
the adult immunization schedule also contains information on general principles of immunization for adults ; considerations for special populations , such as pregnant women ; reference resources pertinent to adult immunization ; instructions for reporting adverse events associated with vaccinations and suspected cases of reportable vaccine - preventable diseases ; and an acip - approved list of standardized abbreviations for vaccines recommended for adults .
the two figures in the adult immunization schedule are accompanied by footnotes that provide important details on vaccination recommendations , such as the number of doses in a vaccination series and dosing intervals .
health care providers are advised to use the figures and the footnotes together .
changes in the 2018 adult immunization schedule from the previous year 's schedule include new acip recommendations for the use of recombinant zoster vaccine ( rzv ) for adults aged 50 years or older and the use of an additional dose of measles , mumps , and rubella vaccine ( mmr ) in a mumps outbreak setting .
changes in the 2018 adult immunization schedule zoster vaccination ( 2 ) .
on october 20 , 2017 , the food and drug administration approved the use of rzv ( shingrix , glaxosmithkline [ gsk ]) for adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster ( shingles ) and its complications .
on october 25 , acip recommended the use of 1 ) rzv among immunocompetent adults aged 50 years or older for the prevention of herpes zoster and related complications , 2 ) rzv among adults aged 50 years or older who previously received the zoster vaccine live ( zvl ) ( zostavax , merck and co. ) , and 3 ) either rzv or zvl for adults aged 60 years or older ( rzv is preferred ) .
on october 26 , 2017 , acip recommended the following in the 2018 adult immunization schedule : administer 2 doses of rzv 2 - 6 months apart to adults aged 50 years or older regardless of past episode of herpes zoster or receipt of zvl .
administer 2 doses of rzv 2 - 6 months apart to adults who previously received zvl at least 2 months after zvl .
for adults aged 60 years or older , administer either rzv or zvl ( rzv is preferred ) .
the clinical trials for rzv excluded pregnancy and confirmed or suspected immunocompromising conditions that can result from disease ( e.g. , malignancy , hiv infection ) or therapy ( e.g. , cancer chemotherapy , treatment for autoimmune disorders ) ( 3 - 6 ) .
therefore , no acip recommendation currently exists for use of rzv among pregnant women ( health care providers should consider delaying administration of rzv for pregnant women ) or adults with immunocompromising conditions , including hiv infection ( additional discussions and recommendations by acip on the use of rzv in adults with immunocompromising conditions are pending ) .
consistent with the existing recommended use of zvl , acip recommended rzv for adults who are receiving low - dose (< 20 mg / day of prednisone or equivalent ) or short - term (< 14 days of corticosteroids ) immunosuppressive therapy , are anticipating immunosuppression , or have recovered from an immunocompromising illness ( 7 ) .
the clinical trials for rzv did not exclude adults with non - immunocompromising chronic health conditions ( 3 - 6 ) .
therefore , given the safety and effectiveness profiles of other conjugate vaccines recommended for adults ( e.g. , hepatitis b and pneumococcal vaccines ) , acip recommended that rzv should routinely be used for age - eligible adults with diabetes mellitus ; chronic heart , lung , liver , or kidney disease ; functional or anatomical asplenia ; or complement deficiencies .
mmr vaccination ( 8 ) .
on 25 october , acip updated mmr vaccination recommendations to include the use of a third dose of a mumps virus - containing vaccine for persons previously vaccinated with 2 doses of a mumps virus - containing vaccine who are identified by public health authorities as being a part of a group or population at risk for acquiring mumps because of an outbreak .
during a mumps outbreak , persons identified as being at increased risk and who have received <= 2 doses of mumps virus - containing vaccine or whose mumps vaccination status is unknown should receive 1 dose of mmr .
this change is described in the 2018 adult immunization schedule as follows : administer 1 dose of mmr to adults who previously received <= 2 doses of mumps virus - containing vaccine and are identified by a public health authority to be at increased risk during a mumps outbreak .
adults without evidence of immunity to mumps ( defined as birth before 1957 , documentation of receipt of mmr , or laboratory evidence of immunity or disease ) are routinely recommended to receive 1 dose of mmr for mumps prevention .
however , students in postsecondary educational institutions , international travelers , or household contacts of immunocompromised persons should receive 2 doses of mmr at least 28 days apart .
in a mumps outbreak setting , those adults identified by a public health authority to be at risk should receive 1 dose of mmr regardless of whether they previously received 0 , 1 , or 2 doses of a mumps virus - containing vaccine .
notable changes to figures 1 and 2 .
the footnotes in the 2018 adult immunization schedule should be used in conjunction with " figure 1 .
recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older , by age group " and " figure 2 .
recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older by medical condition and other indications. " the footnotes contain additional general information ( e.g. , dosing intervals for vaccination series ) and considerations for special populations ( e.g. , pregnant women , adults with hiv infection ) .
the footnotes in the adult immunization schedule and the child and adolescent immunization schedule have been harmonized to be more consistent with one another ( 9 ) .
notable changes in figures 1 and 2 include the following : in figures 1 and 2 , " zvl " replaced the term " hzv " ( herpes zoster vaccine ) that was used in past adult immunization schedules to refer to the live zoster vaccine .
a row for rzv was added above the row for zvl , and a dashed line was used to separate rzv and zvl rows to denote that the two zoster vaccines are recommended for the same purpose .
in the indication bars for rzv , the text stating that rzv is preferred over zvl has been added when either rzv or zvl can be used for adults aged 60 years or older .
in figures 1 and 2 , " td / tdap " ( tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids / tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine ) has been replaced by " tdap or td ," and the text in the indication bar has been revised to " 1 dose tdap , then td booster every 10 years . "
1 dose of tdap is recommended for adults who have not previously received tdap as an adult or child ( 1 dose of tdap is routinely recommended at age 11 - 12 years ) , except for pregnant women , for whom 1 dose of tdap is recommended in each pregnancy during the early part of gestational weeks 27 - 36 .
in figures 1 and 2 , the text in the indication bar for menacwy ( serogroups a , c , w , and y meningococcal vaccine ) has been revised to " 1 or 2 doses depending on indication , then a booster dose every 5 years if risk remains. " adults with functional or anatomical asplenia , persistent complement component deficiencies , or hiv infection should receive 2 doses of menacwy and be revaccinated every 5 years .
one dose of menacwy is recommended for microbiologists who work with isolates of neisseria meningitidis and travelers in countries with endemic or epidemic meningococcal disease , and a booster dose of menacwy is indicated every 5 years if the risk remains .
one dose of menacwy is recommended for first - year college students living in residence halls and military recruits .
mpsv4 ( 4 - valent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine ) is no longer available and has been removed from the adult immunization schedule .
in figure 1 , the text in the indication bar for mmr has been changed to " 1 or 2 doses depending on indication ( if born in 1957 or later )." one dose of mmr is routinely recommended for adults born in 1957 or later who do not have evidence of immunity to measles , mumps , or rubella .
however , for students in postsecondary educational institutions , international travelers , and household contacts of immunocompromised persons , 2 doses of mmr administered at least 28 days apart are routinely recommended .
in figure 1 , the text in the indication bars for human papillomavirus ( hpv ) vaccine for females and males ( 10 ) has been revised to " 2 or 3 doses depending on age at series initiation. " more information details on these updates and information on other vaccines recommended for adults are available online under adult immunization schedule , united states , 2018 , at https :// www.cdc.gov / vaccines / schedules / hcp / adult.html and in the annals of internal medicine ( 11 ) .

* cdc encourages organizations that previously have relied on copying the adult immunization schedule on their websites to use syndication instead , as a more reliable method for displaying the most current and accurate adult immunization schedule .
use of content syndication requires a one - time step that ensures an organization 's website displays the adult immunization schedule as soon as it is published or revised .
the syndication code for the adult immunization schedule and instructions for its use can be found at https :// www.cdc.gov / vaccines / schedules / syndicate.html .

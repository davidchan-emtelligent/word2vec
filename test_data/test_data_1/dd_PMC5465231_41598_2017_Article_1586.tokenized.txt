human brown adipose tissue ( bat ) , with a major site in the cervical - supraclavicular depot , is a promising anti - obesity target .
this work presents an automated method for segmenting cervical - supraclavicular adipose tissue for enabling time - efficient and objective measurements in large cohort research studies of bat .
fat fraction ( ff ) and r2 * maps were reconstructed from water - fat magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of 25 subjects .
a multi - atlas approach , based on atlases from nine subjects , was chosen as automated segmentation strategy .
a semi - automated reference method was used to validate the automated method in the remaining subjects .
automated segmentations were obtained from a pipeline of preprocessing , affine registration , elastic registration and postprocessing .
the automated method was validated with respect to segmentation overlap ( dice similarity coefficient , dice ) and estimations of ff , r2 * and segmented volume .
bias in measurement results was also evaluated .
segmentation overlaps of dice = 0.93 +/ - 0.03 ( mean +/ - standard deviation ) and correlation coefficients of r > 0.99 ( p < 0.0001 ) in ff , r2 * and volume estimates , between the methods , were observed .
dice and bmi were positively correlated ( r = 0.54 , p = 0.03 ) but no other significant bias was obtained ( p >= 0.07 ) .
the automated method compared well with the reference method and can therefore be suitable for time - efficient and objective measurements in large cohort research studies of bat .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction brown adipose tissue ( bat ) is considered as a promising target for treatment of obesity and diabetes1 due to its high capacity of converting chemical energy into heat2 .
positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography ( pet / ct ) using [ 18f ] fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) is currently the most established modality for in vivo imaging of human bat3 , of which the main depot is located in the cervical - supraclavicular region4 .
as a non - ionizing imaging alternative and complement to pet / ct , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) has been introduced for studies of human and animal bat during the metabolically active and inactive states5 - 11 .
one promising mri technique , multi - echo water - fat mri , can provide quantitative and simultaneous estimations of fat fraction ( ff ) and r2 * 12 .
the ff and r2 * metrics might reflect differences between bat and white adipose tissue ( wat ) , with respect to water , fat , iron and blood oxygen content , and have been used for characterizing the two types of adipose tissue ( at ) 13 .
an important step in bat image analysis is segmentation of the bat depots .
in human fdg - pet / ct studies , isolation of metabolically active bat is guided by the use of combined constraints on fdg standardized uptake value ( suv ) and ct hounsfield units ( hu ) 3 .
in studies involving separate examinations with fdg - pet / ct and mri14 or simultaneous examinations with integrated fdg - pet / mri15 , segmentation of the mr images can be accomplished by using the co - registered pet / ct data or pet data , respectively .
in standalone mri studies , there is so far no reference available for identifying active bat or bat amount .
instead , these studies typically rely on manual segmentation , based on anatomical criteria , for targeting at with high a priori probability of containing bat .
the cervical - supraclavicular adipose tissue depot is an example of such suspected bat and is hereafter denoted sbat ( for illustration of the depot location , see previous publication by enerback16 ) .
bat depots in human adults are not well - defined as compared to the traditional subcutaneous and visceral wat depots17 or the characteristic interscapular bat ( ibat ) depot in rodents and human infants18 .
the extension of the sbat depot is relatively subjective and may cover a smaller or larger portion of the non - subcutaneous adipose tissue present in the cervical - thoracic region .
besides the challenging task of anatomically defining the sbat depot in a standardized manner , manual delineation suffers from general drawbacks such as operator expertise dependency , limited precision , time - inefficiency and high cost19 .
a fully automated segmentation method would facilitate mr image analysis and lead to standardized , reproducible and objective measurements suitable for large cohort studies .
multi - atlas segmentation ( mas ) is a promising automated method for bat segmentation due to its state of the art performance for diverse applications and suitability for data exhibiting large anatomical variations19 .
moreover , mas methods have successfully been implemented on water - fat mri data for the purpose of studying volumes of muscle20 and adipose tissue21 .
the basic concept of mas is to use a group of previously segmented datasets ( atlases ) to segment a novel dataset ( target ) via image registration .
the purpose of the present work was to develop and validate an automated multi - atlas method for segmentation of human cervical - supraclavicular adipose tissue ( sbat ) , intended for studies of brown adipose tissue ( bat ) in large cohort studies .
the validation was performed by using a semi - automated segmentation method as reference .
materials and methods in the present study , an automated mas method was developed and subsequently validated by a semi - automated reference ( ref ) method .
an overview of the two methods is presented by the flow chart in fig. 1 and methodological details are provided in the following subsections .
the subjects used for producing and evaluating the mas method were divided into two groups with similar characteristics : the mas group and the evaluation ( e ) group ( illustrated in fig. 2 ) .
the mas group formed an essential part of the mas method and the e group was used for validating the mas method with the ref method .
figure 1 flow charts of the semi - automated reference segmentation ( ref ) method and the automated multi - atlas segmentation ( mas ) method .
in the mas method , the initial crude manual delineation of the ref method was replaced by a crude multi - atlas segmentation .
thereafter , a common set of automated fine adjustments was applied to the two methods ( thresholding , erosion ) .
in the mas method , the segmented depot was obtained after a refinement step where residual voxels of air and bone were removed ( by thresholding , dilation , filling of holes , erosion ) .
in the ref method , the segmented depot was obtained directly after the automated fine adjustments as voxels in bone and air were assumed to be avoided in the manual delineation .

both groups were composed of adults and children with body compositions ranging from lean to obese , here ordered according to bmi .
subjects seventeen children and adolescents from the beta - cell function in juvenile diabetes and obesity project and eight adults from previous mr method development studies , approved by the regional ethical review board in uppsala , were included in this study .
all participants had given informed written consent to participate and the procedures were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations .
the subjects were divided into an mas group of 9 subjects [ five males , four females , age : 23 +/ - 10 years ( mean +/ - standard deviation ) , age range : 12 - 37 years , body mass index ( bmi ) : 26.1 +/ - 5.7 kg / m2 ] and an e group of 16 subjects [ five males , eleven females , age : 17 +/ - 7 years , age range : 11 - 33 years , bmi : 27.7 +/ - 6.4 kg / m2 ] .
both groups were composed of adult and child subjects with a wide range of body composition ( fig. 2 ) .
as the performance of the mas method was directly influenced by the mas group , only subjects with relatively high image quality ( subjective assessment mainly considering motion artefacts ) were included in this group .
the number of subjects in the mas and e groups was considered appropriate in view of similar work published previously .
image acquisition and reconstruction water - fat mri of the cervical - supraclavicular depot was performed on a clinical whole - body 1.5 t mr system ( philips healthcare , best , the netherlands ) .
water images , fat images , ff maps and r2 * maps ( inherently co - registered as acquired simultaneously ) were obtained through a previously described in - house 3d reconstruction method12 .
imaging and reconstruction parameters for the water - fat data are summarized in table 1 .

rl = right - left , ap = anterior - posterior , fh = feet - head direction .
the regularization parameter , mu , reflects the influence of assumed magnetic field spatial smoothness , and hence the influence of noise , in fitting of the water - fat mri signal model to the data12 .
the semi - automated reference segmentation method the ref method was based on crude manual delineation of the sbat depot and applied to the water - fat data of all mas and e ( group ) subjects .
in the mas subjects , manual delineation was performed in all slices .
in the e subjects , manual delineation was performed in even numbered slices only , to reduce the associated time - consuming work .
the segmentation of the mas subjects formed a part of the mas method itself whereas the segmentation of the e subjects was used as reference for evaluating the performance of the mas method .
the ref method consisted of a slightly modified version of a previously published semi - automated method22 .
according to the ref method , the segmentation of sbat was accomplished in two steps : 1 ) manual delineation of a crude sbat volume of interest ( voi ) performed by an experienced operator guided by radiologists .
2 ) automated fine adjustment of the sbat voi for extraction of at and for final labelling of voxels as sbat or non - sbat voxels .
ref method , step 1 : manual delineation segmentation of the crude sbat voi was performed manually and slice wise on the ff map meanwhile also considering the r2 * map and the water image for more accurate delineation of at close to bone and lung .
the crude sbat voi was defined , from anatomical criteria , to include at located between the clavicula and the scapula and to exclude subcutaneous at , bone marrow , and paravertebral fat ( examples illustrated by the red contours in fig. 3a ) .
in regions where sbat and subcutaneous at were adjoining , the crude sbat voi was rather kept narrow than broad to reduce the infiltration of wat .
additionally , care was taken to not include at directly adjacent to the lungs and ribs as these areas were relatively difficult to delineate .
in general , the exclusion of potential bat voxels was considered as less severe than inclusion of distinct bone marrow or sat voxels in the crude manual delineation .

subject b : female , age = 11 years , bmi = 28.6 kg / m2 .
ref method , step 2 : automated fine adjustment of segmentation within the crude sbat voi , an automated segmentation ( implemented in matlab ) was applied to isolate the at and concurrently decrease the partial volume effects from adjacent non - fatty tissues .
the automated segmentation was accomplished by applying a voxel threshold on ff (>= 40 %) followed by subsequent 2d erosion with a four - neighbourhood structuring element ( se ) and a voxel threshold on r2 * (<= 50 s - 1 ) .
the threshold limits were determined empirically and aimed at excluding non - fatty tissue and probable border voxels .

the automated multi - atlas segmentation method mas methods are based on the use of previously segmented images ( atlases ) for subsequent segmentation of novel , to - be - segmented images ( targets ) 19 .
mas methods are generally automated and based on pairwise image registration between each atlas and target , where the atlases and targets can be represented by e.g. 2d or 3d images .
in this project , the atlases were generated from the mas subject water - fat data to which crude manual segmentations were associated .
the targets were represented by the corresponding unsegmented water - fat data of the e subjects .
mas of a single target was accomplished by the following steps ( implemented in matlab ) : ( 1 ) generation of atlases by preprocessing the input images to the image registration and by manual delineation of the crude sbat vois .
( 2 ) image registration - driven deformation of each atlas for anatomical matching to the target and for determining the spatial correspondence ( deformation field ) between the atlas and the target .
( 3 ) propagation of the crude atlas segmentations to the target by applying the deformation field .
( 4 ) fusion of the propagated segmentations , one for each atlas , for obtaining a single merged crude segmentation of the target .
( 5 ) fine adjustment and refinement of the fused crude segmentation leading to a final segmentation of the target .
mas method , step 1 : generation of atlases each atlas consisted of a water fraction ( wf ) and r2 * map with an associated crude sbat voi segmentation .
the wf and r2 * maps were chosen as they were both quantitative ( i.e. directly comparable between subjects ) and reflected different body tissue properties .
the wf map was preferred to the ff map as it could be preprocessed into an apparent lean tissue body .
this was due to the low wf of at that enabled the tissue to be interpreted as background by the computer algorithm .
the lean tissue body nearly enclosed the sbat depot and was of relatively high inter - subject anatomical similarity , despite a wide range of body fat content , and was therefore suitable for the image registration in the mas method .
the preprocessing steps of the wf map ( illustrated in fig. 4 ) were as follows : ( a ) voxel wise computation of the wf map ( wf = 1 - ff ) ( b ) removal of background ( i.e. voxels containing air and cortical bone ) , represented by noisy areas in the wf map due to the low water and fat signal .
the removal was accomplished by voxel wise thresholding on the sum of the water and fat signal .
( c ) removal of skin voxels by exploiting its tissue specific ff and r2 * properties and anatomical location , followed by a series of erosion , dilation and filling steps .
the major steps were as follows : a 2d erosion ( four - neighbourhood se ) , applied iteratively on axial slices under constraints on ff (<= 30 %) and r2 * (>= 80 s - 1 ) for eliminating one voxel - layer of skin at a time ( thresholds empirically determined ) .
in detail , the iterative process allowed removal of thin and thick layers of skin ( i.e. voxels of low ff and high r2 *) without substantially affecting adipose tissue ( i.e. voxels of high ff and low r2 *) or muscle tissue ( i.e. voxels of low ff and r2 *) .
for examples of tissue specific ff and r2 * properties , see figs 4 and 5 .
then , residual clusters of unwanted voxels in skin or outside of the body were omitted by considering only the largest connected component .
subsequent 2d morphological closing ( 5 x 5 se ) , with intermediate filling of holes , was applied to correct rare cases of erosion underneath the skin .
finally , 2d erosion ( 7 x 7 se ) without constraints was applied to further decrease the amount of any residual skin voxels .
figure 4 the preprocessing steps applied to the water fraction ( wf ) map prior to image registration in the multi - atlas segmentation ( mas ) method .
two slices of the same subject are illustrated .
step a : calculation of the wf map from the fat fraction ( ff ) map .
step b : removal of background voxels .
step c : removal of skin voxels .
after preprocessing , the wf map consisted of an apparent lean tissue body .
as the preprocessed wf map nearly surrounded the cervical - supraclavicular ( sbat ) depot and exhibited relatively low inter - subject variability , it was suitable for registration purposes .
figure 5 the preprocessing steps applied to the r2 * map prior to image registration in the multi - atlas segmentation ( mas ) method .
two slices of the same subject are illustrated .
step a : removal of background voxels outside of the body and skin voxels .
step b : reduction of image noise using a median - filter .
the preprocessed r2 * map exhibited high voxel intensities in areas close to bone and air - filled structures , which guided the matching of these anatomies under image registration .
the r2 * map was preprocessed into an image exhibiting high voxel intensities in areas close to bone and air - filled structures and used to guide the matching of these anatomies under image registration .
the preprocessing steps ( illustrated in fig. 5 ) were as follows : ( a ) removal of skin ( and simultaneously also background outside of the body ) by applying the same methods as described for the wf map .
( b ) smoothing of the r2 * map by applying a median - filter ( 3 x 3 x 3 se ) for noise - reduction .
the atlas segmentation was conducted by manual delineation , largely in accordance with the first step of the ref method .
but in addition to appropriate delineation of at , care was taken to also include lean tissue in areas that might correspond to sbat in other subjects with a different body composition .
when images of different subjects were registered , the lean tissue bodies and bone structures were expected to be adequately aligned whereas locally within the sbat region ( i.e. between the lungs , clavicula and scapula ) , suboptimal matching between lean tissue areas and at areas was common .
in the sbat region of a lean subject , the amount of lean tissue content was typically higher than the amount of at. in an obese subject , the relative amounts were generally the opposite .
as a consequence , a lean mas subject was expected to underestimate the sbat depot coverage of an obese e subject unless the crude sbat voi of the mas subject also included lean tissue within the sbat region .
mas method , step 2 : image registration prior to image registration , the wf and r2 * maps of the e subjects were preprocessed according to the same procedure as described above ( section generation of atlases ) .
pairwise image registration between each atlas and each target was accomplished in two steps by the itk - based elastix software23 .
in the first step , the atlas wf map ( moving image ) underwent affine deformation to match the target wf map ( fixed image ) during optimization of the normalized correlation ( optimizer = adaptive stochastic gradient descent , number of resolutions = 4 , max number of iterations = 3000 , b - spline interpolation order = 1 ) .
the affinely registered dataset was then used as starting point for the second step where a weighted sum ( weight = 1:1 ) of the normalized correlation between the atlas and target wf and r2 * maps was optimized under an elastic deformation ( b - spline transform , optimizer = adaptive stochastic gradient descent , number of resolutions = 4 , max number of iterations = 7000 , b - spline interpolation order = 1 , final grid spacing = 20 mm ) .
parameter settings were chosen to provide an appropriate trade - off between computational cost and degree of elasticity in the allowed deformations .
mas method , step 3 : propagation of segmentations for each pairwise image registration , the resulting deformation field was applied to transfer the crude sbat voi from the atlas to the target .
linear interpolation , preserving the voxel coverage values , was used as propagation strategy .
mas method , step 4 : fusion of segmentations for each target , nine different crude segmentations were obtained ( i.e. one from each atlas , examples illustrated by the multi - colour contours in fig. 3b ) .
these segmentations were combined , by majority voting , to a single and combined crude segmentation of the target ( examples illustrated by the blue contours in fig. 3c ) .
for a voxel to be labelled as a crude sbat voi voxel , it had to be labelled as such by more than half of the atlases .
as the imaged volume only partially covered the cervical - supraclavicular depot in the superior - inferior direction and as the shoulder area is flexible and sensitive to subject positioning , the imaged volume was slightly differently located ( with respect to anatomy ) in different subjects .
due to this inter - subject shift of the imaged volume , the majority voting of a specific voxel was performed only among the atlases in which the voxel was represented. with this approach , the influence from subject positioning on the voxel label was reduced .
in addition , this modified majority voting prevented unnecessary exclusion of sbat voxels due to shift in depot coverage between the subjects .
mas method , step 4 : fine adjustment and refinement of segmentation extraction of at within the crude sbat voi was performed automatically according to the second step of the ref method .
in a final refinement step , an attempt of removing any residual voxels within air and bone was made by applying a threshold on the total water and fat signal with additional dilation , filling of holes and erosion .
the final segmented sbat region ( examples illustrated by the green areas in fig. 3c ) is here denoted sbatmas and the associated mean ff and r2 * are denoted \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ overline {{\ rm { ff }}}}_{{\ rm { mas }}}\,{\ rm { and }}\,{\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}}_{{\ rm { mas }}}$$\ end { document } ff masandr2 * mas , respectively .

the mas method computation time was estimated per target .

voxels within the imaged volume of the e subject but outside the imaged volume of all mas subjects were discarded in the dice calculation ( i.e. not considered as fn voxels ) .
this was due to the interpretation of these non - overlapping voxels to be results of suboptimal subject positioning rather than of suboptimal mas method performance .

the fp voxels were visually categorized as distinct sat , distinct bone marrow or non - specific at voxels .
the non - specific at voxels included those adjacent to sat ( but which could not unambiguously be determined as sat ) , to lungs and bone and to other borders of sbatref .

linear regression was also used to evaluate the association of any mas method bias with measurement results and subject characteristics .
mean values were compared by student 's paired t - test using a two - tailed distribution .
the approximate normal distribution of the data was assessed by visual inspection .
the repeatability of the ref method was evaluated by letting the same operator repeat the manual delineation of the crude sbat voi , in even numbered slices of six of the e subjects , approximately two months after the original delineation .
the repeatability was determined by means of the dice ( equation 1 ) .

repeatability of the reference method the overlap between two repeated segmentations by the ref method , as evaluated within a subcohort of the e group , was larger [ dice = 0.94 +/ - 0.02 ( 0.91 - 0.97 )] than that obtained from the mas and ref method comparison [ dice = 0.91 +/ - 0.02 ( 0.89 - 0.95 )] ( p < 0.01 ) .
discussion in the present work , a multi - atlas based method for segmentation of human sbat from water - fat mr images has been described and evaluated .
this mas method is fully automated , time - efficient and provides objective results similar to those obtained by a semi - automated ref method based on manual delineation .
when compared to the ref method , the mas method demonstrated a relatively large segmentation overlap ( dice = 0.93 +/ - 0.03 ) with sufficient robustness ( dice range : 0.88 - 0.96 ) in lean to obese adults and children .
discrepancies in segmentations obtained with the mas and ref methods corresponded to inclusion of only small amounts of undesirable sat and bone marrow .
moreover , the discrepancy in segmentation overlap did not result in significant differences in \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{\ rm { ff }}},\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } ff , r2 * or volume estimations .
the relatively large standard deviations in the segmented volumes ( table 2 ) reflected the large variation in body composition between the e subjects .
the excellent correlations ( r =~ 0.99 ) and agreements ( slope k =~ 1 ) between the mas and ref methods , with respect to estimations of \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{\ rm { ff }}},\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } ff , r2 * and segmented volumes , suggest the latter method to be replaceable by the former without loss of accuracy .
when investigating the association of mas method bias with measurement results , the trend of positive correlation between \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ rm {\ delta }}\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } deltar2 * and \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}}_{{\ rm { ref }}}$$\ end { document } r2 * ref indicated an \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } r2 * - dependence leading to accurate estimation of \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } r2 * =~ 20 s - 1 but 1 % overestimation of \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } r2 * =~ 30 s - 1 by the mas method .
moreover , the positive correlation between dice and bmi and the trend of positive correlation between dice and segmented volume ( vref ) suggest inferior segmentation overlap in lean as compared to obese subjects .
this is probably due to a higher segmented surface - to - volume ratio in lean subjects , which is associated with a smaller segmentation overlap .
the stronger association of dice with bmi than with segmented volume ( vref ) was somewhat surprising as volume is expected to more directly reflect the surface - to - volume ratio .
separate and dedicated sets of lean - specific and obese - specific atlases could likely improve the segmentation of lean and obese subjects , respectively .
however , a common set of lean and obese atlases is preferable for objective and accurate measurements across a wide range of body composition , also including e.g. slightly overweight subjects .
an alternative future approach to using separate sets of atlases is to refine the segmentation fusion method .
instead of majority voting , where each atlas segmentation is weighted equally , a weighted voting approach might improve the results by smoothly adjusting the influence of individual atlases with respect to their similarities to the target19 .
despite the inclusion of both children and adults ( 11 - 33 years ) , there was no observed association between dice and age .
although the segmentation overlap was found to vary with subject body composition it did not introduce any bmi - or volume - associated bias in \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{\ rm { ff }}}$$\ end { document } ff . however , a trend of negatively correlated \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ rm {\ delta }}\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } deltar2 * with bmi and segmented volume ( vref ) was observed and might lead to biased results , e.g. in cross - sectional studies including both lean and obese subjects .
to exemplify the effect of this trend , the \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } r2 * of a subject with bmi =~ 20 kg / m2 would be overestimated by approximately 0.2 s - 1 by the mas method whereas the \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } r2 * of a subject with bmi =~ 33 kg / m2 would be estimated accurately .
the potential over - or underestimation related to the segmented volumes would be approximately up to +/ - 0.2 s - 1 .
age - associated bias in \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{\ rm { ff }}}$$\ end { document } ff and \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } r2 * was not observed and may be considered as negligible .
in conclusion , possible errors related to \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$$\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}$$\ end { document } r2 * measurements and body composition are likely to be small compared to other sources of errors .
most of the fp voxels were observed to be located in non - specific at and only smaller amounts in distinct sat and bone marrow .
as the border between sbat and sat is not well - defined , at near the border is more likely than distinct sat to contain considerable clusters of bat .
consequently , the mislabelling of non - distinct at was considered as less severe than that of distinct sat and bone marrow .
the segmentation overlap was observed to be larger between two repeated executions of the ref method than between the mas and ref methods .
this result was probably influenced by the large heterogeneity in subject body composition , which limited the performance of the mas method .
nevertheless , the results were comparable and this drawback with the mas method should be considered in light of the time efficiency advantage .
it should be noted that neither the ref nor the mas segmentations of sbat refer to at verified to be bat on a subject specific basis .
however , the probability of the segmentations to be or to contain bat is relatively high in the age span of subjects in the present study15 , 24 .
the not well - defined shape of the sbat depot makes the manual delineation , used for creating atlases and reference segmentations , challenging and operator - dependent .
this difficulty was reflected in the ref method repeatability ( dice = 0.94 ) , which nevertheless was relatively high .
however , an advantage with choosing a multi - atlas approach for the automated method is that the studied volume easily can be adjusted by changing the manual delineation of the atlases , without editing the algorithm .
besides ambiguous borders , the mixed content of bat and wat in the sbat depot18 , 25 results in partial volume effects that prevent true bat segmentation with the limited resolution of current imaging modalities .
in contrast , the anatomically well - defined and relatively pure rodent ibat depot is more easily identified , less affected by partial volume effects and less challenging to segment .
automated methods for segmenting rodent ibat in mr images have been presented26 , 27 .
although adaption for future use in humans was suggested by the authors , the adjustments are not trivial due to the aforementioned differences between the rodent ibat and the human sbat depots .
to our knowledge , no automated method for inter - subject segmentation of human bat depots in mri - only data has been presented .
in a bi - modal study , based on both fdg - pet / ct and water - fat mri14 , segmentation of active bat was accomplished by a similar method to those applied for standalone pet / ct studies .
subsequently , intra - subject registration of mr and pet / ct images was used to transfer bat segmentations to the mri data , thereby avoiding manual delineation of the mr images .
bi - modal studies could potentially be used for establishing mri properties of bat , anatomically defined from pet / ct guidance , with the future goal to estimate bat amount and activity solely with mri .
however , further development is required. with the increasing availability of integrated pet / mr systems , the conditions for pet - guided automated segmentation of bat will likely be improved due to simultaneous acquisition of the pet and mr data .
apart from difficulties in separating sbat from wat , the imaged shoulder region is flexible and non - rigid and thereby challenging for the registration step of the mas method .
however , the two - step image registration procedure ( affine deformation prior to elastic deformation ) was shown to sufficiently align the anatomies .
moreover , the inter - subject heterogeneity in body composition and size ( due to inclusion of both adult and child subjects ) further increased the complexity of the registration task .
to improve the segmentation results , a group of subjects representative of the whole cohort were chosen for the mas group .
to further improve the registration outcome , some preprocessing steps were applied to the input images , e.g. removal of skin voxels .
as the skin voxels were located at distances from the lean tissue bodies that differed between subjects , depending on the amount of sat , the removal was performed to avoid unpredictable image registration distortions .
another measure that probably improved the image registration performance was the standardized subject positioning which likely led to smaller deformations and more robust results .
another challenge in the present study was that of bone detection during manual delineation .
the appearance of bone in water - fat images of children differs from that of adults due to disparities in cortical bone thickness and bone marrow content .
as a consequence , the ability to detect bone was generally perceived as more difficult in children .
due to imaging time constraints , there was only partial sbat depot coverage ( 5 cm in the superior - inferior direction ) .
therefore , the positioning of the image volume had a large impact on the sbat overlap between different subjects .
in order to use as much of the imaged sbat depot as possible , the fusion of the individual atlas segmentations was based on a modified version of majority voting .
according to this version , the voting of a specific voxel was performed only among the atlases for which the image volume overlapped with the voxel .
a drawback with this approach was that the voxel labelling was performed by a number of atlases that varied from voxel to voxel , without considering the registration performance of the atlases .
there could have been cases where the voting was performed only among a few atlases with suboptimal registrations , which could have resulted in suboptimal segmentations .
however , this limitation was regarded as being related to imaging procedure and therefore not considered in the evaluation of the mas method .
a related limitation was that dice and vref were calculated only from overlapping image volumes , between the atlases and the target .
as a consequence , a considerable portion of the target sbat could have been omitted in the dice calculation and the target vref was probably underestimated .
nevertheless , \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ overline {{\ rm { ff }}}}_{{\ rm { ref }}}$$\ end { document } ff ref and \ documentclass [ 12pt ]{ minimal } \ usepackage { amsmath } \ usepackage { wasysym } \ usepackage { amsfonts } \ usepackage { amssymb } \ usepackage { amsbsy } \ usepackage { mathrsfs } \ usepackage { upgreek } \ setlength {\ oddsidemargin }{ - 69pt } \ begin { document }$${\ overline {{{\ rm { r }}}_{ 2 }^{\ ast }}}_{{\ rm { ref }}}$$\ end { document } r2 * ref were estimated from the whole sbat volume of the target ( in even numbered slices ) .
the automated segmentation method has been evaluated for data acquired using a specific set of imaging parameters .
the reliability of the method when applied to other data , e.g. those acquired with a different spatial coverage or resolution , has not been investigated .
although the method potentially could be satisfactory , such new data likely would require some adaption of the atlas data and / or computer algorithm for an optimal segmentation performance .
the performance of the automated segmentation method developed was similar to that of the semi - automated reference method .
this result suggests the automated method to be suitable for time - efficient and objective measurements in large cohort research studies of brown adipose tissue ( bat ) .

methods a group of 2000 patients were randomly selected from those with stored samples after stratification by region .
25 ( oh ) d levels were measured in a single laboratory from stored plasma samples .
the 1985 available 25 ( oh ) d results were stratified into tertiles .
factors associated with 25 ( oh ) d levels and associations of 25 ( oh ) levels with subsequent risk of all - cause mortality , aids and non - aids events were analysed , using poisson regression .
results thirty - six percent of patients had 25 ( oh ) levels below 12 ng / ml , 31,3 % between 12.1 and 20 ng / ml , and 32.7 % above 20 ng / ml. in a cross sectional analysis , older persons , patients of black ethnic origin , living outside southern europe and argentina , sampled during winter , and infected with hiv through non - homosexual exposure were at higher risk of having low 25 ( oh ) d levels , while patients receiving protease inhibitors were at a lower risk .
compared to those in the lowest 25 ( oh ) d tertile , those in the medium and high tertiles had a significantly lower risk of clinical progression .
adjusted incidence rate ratios ( irr ; see figure 1 ) for all - cause mortality were 0.68 ( 95 % ci : 0,47 - 0,99 , p = 0.045 ) and 0.56 ( 95 % ci : 0.37 - 0.8 , p = 0.009 ) , and for aids events were 0.58 ( 95 % ci : 0,39 - 0,87 , p = 0.0086 ) and 0.61 ( 95 % ci : 0.40 - 0.93 , p = 0.020 ) , for the medium and high tertiles , respectively .
there was a non - significant reduced incidence of non - aids defining events in the medium and high tertiles , and a significant lower irr of non - aids related death in the highest 25 ( oh ) d tertile : 0.60 ( 95 % ci : 0.37 - 0.98 , p = 0.043 ) .
figure 1 conclusions this observational study demonstrated that 25 ( oh ) d deficiency is frequent in hiv - infected patients , and is independently associated with a variety of outcomes , reflected by a higher risk of mortality and aids events. whether the relationship between vitamin d deficiency and clinical events is causal should be addressed because of potentially major consequences in terms of public health .

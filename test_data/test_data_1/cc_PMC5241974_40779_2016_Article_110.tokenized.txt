background hepatitis b is a disease that affects the liver and is caused by the hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) .
hepatitis b is a serious public health problem in china .
the objective of this study was to assess knowledge of and behaviours towards the transmission and prevention of hepatitis b of new military recruits in china .
methods a cross - sectional study was conducted among 800 new military recruits .
a self - administered , structured questionnaire was used to collect information , and 727 questionnaires were returned completed .
analysis was performed using spss 18.0 , and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant .
results of the respondents , 665 ( 91.5 %) were male and 62 ( 8.5 %) were female .
the mean age was 18.9 +/ - 1.7 years .
a total of 608 respondents ( 83.6 %) demonstrated poor knowledge and 119 ( 16.4 %) adequate knowledge about hbv .
older age , female and higher education level were statistically associated with a higher mean knowledge score .
multivariate logistic regression showed that age ( or = 3.040 , 95 % ci 1.724 - 5.359 , p < 0.001 ) and gender ( or = 1.791 , 95 % ci 1.325 - 2.421 , p < 0.001 ) were significantly associated with appropriate behavioural practices towards prevention of hbv .
conclusion against a backdrop of high hbv prevalence in china , new military recruits had poor knowledge of hbv .
new recruits need better education about hbv to assist in reducing and preventing hbv infection .
keywords hepatitis b virus new recruits infection knowledge china key technology research of prevention and controlling infectious diseases fundbws11j048 national military construction projectissue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 background hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) infection is an important global public health problem .
approximately 5 % of adults exposed to hbv develop chronic hbv infection [ 1 ] , and most of the 350 million chronically infected people worldwide are infected in childhood [ 2 ] .
approximately 780,000 people die every year from hbv infection ; of these , 650,000 die from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma resulting from chronic infection and another 130,000 die from acute hbv infection [ 3 ] .
hbv infection is a leading cause of death from liver cancer and cirrhosis [ 4 ] and is one of the five most prevalent diseases in mainland china , where approximately 130 million people are carriers of hbv - - almost a third of all people infected with hbv worldwide .
approximately 30 million people in china are chronically infected , with 300,000 dying from hbv - related diseases every year , accounting for 40 % to 50 % of hbv - related deaths globally [ 5 ] .
a nationwide hbv sero - epidemiological survey conducted in china in 1992 revealed a hepatitis b surface antigen ( hbsag ) carrier rate of 9.8 % for the entire population .
as a result , the chinese government initiated a universal hbv immunization programme in the same year , and free hbv vaccination has been provided for all newborns since 2005 .
these efforts have reduced the hbsag carrier rate in the general population , from 9.8 % in 1992 to 7.2 % in 2006 [ 6 ] .
although prevention and treatment of hepatitis b has improved , the number of hbv - infected patients in china remains very high .
hbv is highly contagious and is transmitted through parenteral , sexual and vertical ( perinatal transmission ) routes .
an improved understanding of hbv infection routes among the population reduces the risk of hbv infection , which is especially true for young people serving in the military .
young males and females in the military are one group in which it is important to recognize risk behaviours associated with parenterally transmitted diseases .
military personnel often live in camps , predisposing them to exposure to common routes for hbv transmission .
sharing daily utensils , such as hair brushes , combs , razors and toothbrushes , is common among people living in groups and is a behaviour that may facilitate the transmission of viruses [ 7 ] .
additionally , soldiers frequently travel for professional reasons and may spend extended periods of time apart from their family .
this may encourage soldiers to have multiple sex partners , potentially increasing their risk of exposure to a variety of sexually transmitted infections , including hbv .
military forces operate as a fighting collective , prepared for combat and adaptable to wartime needs .
unremitting effort is required to prevent unnecessary non - combat attrition through the prevention of disease , especially the prevention and control of infectious diseases .
in china , the new recruits are not infected with hbv , but we found that recruits still had hbv infection after enlistment , so understanding what influences infectious diseases in military personnel assists in improving and maintaining their health .
our study objective was to develop a questionnaire about basic hbv knowledge and conduct a survey among new recruits in the chinese army , using the results to inform military health promotion policies and to better prepare personnel for combat - readiness .
methods study design , subject selection and data collection we conducted a prospective cross - sectional survey , using a newly developed questionnaire .
military units that had enlisted recruits in march , 2015 were identified , and a random sample of these recruits was issued a questionnaire for self - completion .
a total of 800 copies of the questionnaire were issued .
data were kept anonymous and discarded after the completion of the research .
assessing hbv awareness and knowledge the questionnaire consisted of three sections and was presented in chinese .
the first section focused on the sociodemographic background of the respondents , including their gender , age , marital status , ethnic group , level of education , and type of residential area prior to joining the army .
our definition of " higher education level " indicates a college degree or above , and " older age " indicates 22 - 24 years old .
the second section comprised a set of 15 question - statements exploring knowledge of hbv infection and its consequences , as well as basic knowledge of hbv transmission modes and preventive measures ( table 1 ) .
the respondents were then classified as having adequate or inadequate knowledge , using a cut - off score of 9 points or above ( i.e. , >= 60 % correct ) to define adequate knowledge .
this information was then analysed to examine the factors associated with adequate knowledge .
the third section asked about previous hepatitis b vaccination , respondents' attitude towards people infected with hepatitis b , their source of knowledge about hepatitis b and whether they desire or require more knowledge about hepatitis b. table 1 responses of the study participants to basic hepatitis b knowledge items [ n = (%) , n = 727 ] no. statement yes no unknown 1 shaking hands with hepatitis b carriers or talking with them will cause you to become infected with hepatitis b .

logistic regression analysis was used to explore the independent factors associated with hbv knowledge scores .
the level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 .
adjusted odds ratios ( aors ) and 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were calculated .
results out of a total of 800 questionnaires sent out , 792 valid questionnaires were recovered , giving a response rate of 99.0 % .
sixty - five respondents did not complete the basic questionnaire information and were excluded , ultimately leaving a total of 727 completed questionnaires ( fig. 1 ). of the 727 respondents , 665 were male ( 91.5 %) and 62 were female ( 8.5 %) , with a mean age of 18.9 +/ - 1.7 years .

each response was scored as ' yes ' , ' no ' or ' unknown ' .
correct responses were awarded a score of one point , and the total knowledge score , which could range between 0 and 15 , was calculated ; a knowledge score of < 9 was considered as poor and >= 9 was considered as adequate basic knowledge about hepatitis b. the mean score of the entire cohort was 6 +/ - 2.96. of the 727 participants , 608 ( 83.6 %) were classified as having poor basic knowledge and 119 ( 16.4 %) showed adequate basic knowledge about hbv. of the 15 questions , 4 had ' unknown ' selected by > 50 % of respondents , and these included questions specifically about the route of hepatitis b transmission and hepatitis b prevention ; 627 ( 86.3 %) did not know any asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis b virus and only 262 ( 36.0 %) knew hepatitis b could be transmitted during sexual activity ( table 1 ) .

discussion hepatitis b is a highly infectious disease that is highly prevalent in china .
because of the high hbv prevalence , basic knowledge about hepatitis b is conducive to the protection of non - infected people , especially young people , in whom an understanding of hepatitis b is important .
in china , military recruits from city areas are required to have a high school or higher education level ; in rural areas , this requirement has been relaxed to junior high school .
our survey results reflected this , with high school or higher education accounting for 88.3 % of the group , meaning they were mainly around 18 years old .
only 119 ( 16.4 %) of recruits had adequate basic knowledge about hepatitis b. with the introduction of the hepatitis b vaccine , the hbv infection rate has decreased significantly in recent years [ 6 ] .
however , in rural areas , the hbv infection rate remains high .
screening of 12,393 women of childbearing age in 2013 revealed a positive hbv rate of 9.51 % [ 8 ] .
in the same year , 10.4 % of 14,997 cases screened positive for hbv in insular regions of southeast china [ 9 ] .
prior to this , an examination of 1050 people in putian found that 15.8 % tested positive for hbv [ 10 ] .
military personnel experience greater exposure to transmissible infectious diseases due to the nature of their missions [ 11 , 12 ] .
being away from home and exposed to several infectious agents makes military personnel more susceptible to infectious diseases , especially hbv , which may influence virus heterogeneity .
the army is trained to engage in combat and so military recruits live in collective group environments .
if both officers and soldiers paid attention to personal hygiene and increased their knowledge , this would benefit the prevention and treatment of hbv .
the answer ' do not know ' accounted for 50 % of responses for 8 of the 15 questions on basic knowledge of hepatitis b , further illustrating the need to strengthen the dissemination of accurate information about hepatitis b to new military recruits in the future .
one study found that a history of surgery , blood transfusion and having hepatitis b - infected family members were high risk factors for hbv infection [ 13 ] .
understanding the hbv infection pathway effectively reduces the chances of infection .
our study found that knowledge of hepatitis b was significantly associated with gender and age .
women demonstrated better hepatitis b knowledge , which may be related to a greater interest in hygiene .
the higher level of knowledge among older recruits is more readily understood , as knowledge generally tends to be acquired with age .
ethnicity and former type of residential area had no relationship to hepatitis b knowledge , which suggests that improvement in education about hepatitis b needs to be applied across the population , not just to select groups .
only a clear understanding of hbv transmission routes , symptoms and preventive measures will enable people to be fully involved in hepatitis b prevention .
the army screens potential recruits for hbv and only non - infected people are recruited .
more than half of survey respondents had been vaccinated against hepatitis b , with only 53 ( 7.3 %) not inoculated ; however , 301 ( 41.4 %) were not aware of their vaccination status .
as a result , hepatitis b vaccination will be introduced for unvaccinated recruits as it has been scientifically proven as effective in preventing hepatitis b. most recruits reported that they would maintain contact with hbv carriers , but with attention given to protecting themselves , and attitudes towards people with hbv infection were mostly non - discriminatory .
however , some results suggested more detailed knowledge of hbv transmission and preventive measures was required , particularly around the issue of dining with hbv carriers .
further emphasis is required about hbv being acquired only through transmission of infected blood and not via the digestive tract , meaning that co - dining is safe .
certainly , this study has three limitations .
firstly , the survey did n't mention the recruits' family income , which may be related with degree of hbv knowledge .
moreover , we could not validate the information by checking with medical records on the self - reported hepatitis b vaccination .
finally , it is a cross - sectional study , cause - effect relationship may be difficult to establish between the factors assessed and hb knowledge .
conclusions our study suggests that the dissemination of better information regarding hepatitis b to military recruits is imperative .
the chinese ministry of health 's " 2006 to 2010 : china 's hepatitis b virus prevention and control plan " aimed to increase knowledge of prevention of hbv in more than 80 % of the population by 2010 [ 14 ] .
however , our research shows that this target remains a long way off .
better education on the prevention of hbv will potentially improve the health of military recruits , and this will eventually positively influence their effectiveness in combat .
the simultaneous continued implementation of mass hepatitis b vaccination will further remove hbv from the general population .

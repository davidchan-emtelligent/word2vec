oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several types of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) .
statins are widely used to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the incidence of cvd .
certain over - the - counter products , including resveratrol , show similar effects to statins and may thus be used in conjunction with statins for the treatment of the majority of patients with cvd .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin , resveratrol and resveratrol + atorvastatin ( r + a ) pretreatment on myocardial contractions and vascular endothelial functions in the presence of h2o2 as an experimental model of oxidative stress in rats .
four groups were established and referred to as the control , atorvastatin , resveratrol and r + a groups .
atorvastatin ( 40 mg / kg , per oral ) and / or resveratrol ( 30 mg / kg , intraperitoneal ) treatments were administered for 14 days .
on the 15th day , the thoracic aortas and hearts of the rats were dissected and placed into isolated organ baths .
vascular responses to cumulative doses of h2o2 ( 1x10 - 8 - 1x10 - 4 m h2o2 ) with and without n ( g ) - nitro - l - arginine methyl ester ( l - name ) incubation were measured .
in addition , myocardial electrical stimulation ( es ) responses to various h2o2 concentrations ( 1x10 - 7 - 1x10 - 5 m h2o2 ) were evaluated .
in the control and atorvastatin groups , h2o2 application caused a significant dose - dependent decrease in the es - induced contractions in the myocardial tissue of rats .
in the resveratrol and r + a groups , h2o2 application did not significantly affect myocardial contraction at any dose .
in all groups , incubation with l - name caused a significant augmentation in the h2o2 response , revealing that this effect was mediated via the vascular endothelium .
in conclusion , pretreatment with r + a for cvd appears to be superior to pretreatment with either agent alone .
resveratrol atorvastatin myocardium hydrogen peroxide endothelium introduction oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several types of cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , including ischemic stroke , myocardial ischemia , myocardial stunning , ischemia - reperfusion injury , hypertension and atherosclerosis .
it is also considered to play a role in the progression of atherosclerosis ( 1 - 4 ) .
previous studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients with cvd are likely to have chronic oxidative stress and that this is associated with their diagnosed disease state ( 5 - 7 ) .
h2o2 is an important byproduct of oxidative metabolism and is a major contributor to oxidative stress - induced functional and metabolic dysfunction .
the beta - hydroxy - beta - methylglutaryl coenzyme a ( hmg - coa ) reductase inhibitors ( statins ) are widely used to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and reduce the incidence of cvd .
as well as their cholesterol - lowering effects , statins improve endothelial function in normocholesterolemia ( 8,9 ) .
certain over - the - counter ( otc ) products , including resveratrol , also exhibit similar effects to statins .
resveratrol ( trans - 3,5,4 - trihydroxystilbene ) is a polyphenol ( phytoalexin ) that naturally occurs in red wine and in a variety of therapeutic plants .
in vitro experiments have revealed that the cardiovascular protective effects of resveratrol may occur through a number of mechanisms .
resveratrol inhibits the proliferation of smooth muscle cells , platelet aggregation and the oxidation of low - density lipoprotein cholesterol , and reduces the synthesis of lipids and eicosanoids , which promote inflammation and atherosclerosis ( 10 ) .
these multiple protective effects of resveratrol increase its demand as an otc product , even for those undergoing treatment with statins .
a number of studies have demonstrated the aggravating effects of statins on oxidative stress in organisms ( 11,12 ) .
such aggravating effects of statins on the myocardium have already been shown ( 13,14,15,16 ) .
the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin , resveratrol and resveratrol + atorvastatin ( r + a ) pretreatment on myocardial contractions and endothelial function in the presence of h2o2 as an experimental model of oxidative stress in rats .
materials and methods animals and experimental procedure a total of 28 male wistar albino rats , aged 8 weeks and weighing 260 - 280 g , obtained from the animal care facility of meram medical faculty ( konya , turkey ) were used in the present study .
animals were housed identically in cages in an air - conditioned room under a 12 - h light / dark cycle .
temperature and relative humidity were controlled within the limits of 21 +/ - 2degreesc and 55 +/ - 15 % , respectively .
all animals were acclimated for >= 7 days prior to the onset of the study .
a standard diet and tap water were provided ad libitum .
the experimental procedures were approved by the animal ethics committee of the meram school of medicine ( konya , turkey ) .
all chemicals were purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo , usa ) and stored according to the manufacturers' instructions unless otherwise specified .
for 14 days , the control group ( n = 8 ) received 1.5 ml drinking water by oral gavage and 1 ml 10 % v / v dimethyl sulfoxide [ dmso ; intraperitoneal ( i.p. )] , the vehicle for resveratrol .
the atorvastatin group ( n = 6 ) received 40 mg / kg atorvastatin ( lipitor ( r )) , which was prepared daily and dissolved in drinking water , by oral gavage and 1 ml 10 % v / v dmso i.p. for the same period of time .
the resveratrol group ( n = 6 ) was treated with 30 mg / kg i.p. resveratrol and 1.5 ml drinking water by oral gavage for the 14 days , and the r + a group ( n = 8 ) was treated with 40 mg / kg atorvastatin by oral gavage and 30 mg / kg i.p. resveratrol .
rats were weighed every five days for adjustments to the dosing schedule and observed every day or as necessary .
on day 15 , the rats were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 50 mg / kg body weight sodium pentobarbital .
the heart and thoracic aorta were removed from each rat and placed immediately into fresh , oxygenated , ice - cold krebs - henseleit solution ( khs ) composed of 119 mmol / l nacl , 4.7 mmol / l kcl , 1.5 mmol / l mgso4 , 1.2 mmol / l kh2po4 , 2.5 mmol / l cacl2 , 25 mmol / l nahco3 and 11 mmol / l glucose .
detection of myocardial contraction myocardial strips ( 10 - 13 mm long and 2 - 3 mm wide ) were prepared from the left ventricle using a previously described method ( 17 ) .
the strips were placed in a 10 - ml chamber containing oxygen - enriched ( 0.5 l / min ) khs at 37degreesc .
one end of the strip was attached to a force transducer ( mp30 ; biopac systems , inc. , santa barbara , ca , usa ) by a thin silk thread and the other end was attached to a hook in the tissue bath .
the strips were left for 30 min for stabilization .
following the stabilization period , the maximum contractions to electrical stimulation ( es ) were recorded [ frequency , 0.5 hz ; duration , 5 msec ; and voltage , 30 - 40 v ( 20 % above threshold )] .
the effects of h2o2 on myocardial contractions were then evaluated at concentrations of 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 and 1x10 - 5 m. following each dose , the organ bath was washed with khs and the next dose was applied after 20 min resting time .
the same procedure was conducted for all four groups .
contractions are given as a percentage of the initial contractions .
detection of thoracic aorta responses thoracic aorta rings ( 2 - 3 mm wide ) were placed into a 10 - ml chamber containing oxygen - enriched ( 0.5 l / min ) khs at 37degreesc .
one end of the strip was attached to a force transducer ( mp30 ; biopac systems , inc. ) by a thin silk thread , while the other end was pinned to a hook in the tissue bath .
the strips were left for 15 min to spontaneously recover their isometric tension , following which they were gradually stretched to a resting force of 1 x g. the tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min with repeated washing every 10 min with khs .
following the equilibration period , the thoracic rings were contracted with 80 mm kcl .
after the 30 - min wash - out period in which the tissues were repeatedly washed every 10 min with khs , 1x10 - 8 , 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 , 1x10 - 5 and 1x10 - 4 m h2o2 were cumulatively added to the organ bath .
once the contractions reached a plateau , the tissues were washed twice every 15 min and incubated with 1x10 - 4 m n ( g ) - nitro - l - arginine methyl ester ( l - name ) , an inhibitor of nitric oxide ( no ) formation , for 30 min to evaluate the effect of the vascular endothelium on the h2o2 results .
following incubation , 1x10 - 8 , 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 , 1x10 - 5 and 1x10 - 4 m h2o2 were cumulatively added to the organ bath once more .
all results are expressed as a percentage of the previous contraction induced by 80 mm kcl .
statistical analysis data are expressed as the mean +/ - standard error of the mean .
the statistical significance of differences between the groups was analyzed by one - way analysis of variance or the student 's t - test .
p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference .
results intragroup myocardial results h2o2 was applied to the organ bath at doses of 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 and 1x10 - 5 m. to observe the effects of increasing doses of h2o2 , an intragroup comparison of the myocardial results was carried out for each group .
in the control group , h2o2 significantly reduced the contractions induced by es at all doses ( 1x10 - 7 vs. 1x10 - 6 m and 1x10 - 6 vs. 1x10 - 5 m , p < 0.01 ) .
the results were 94.16 +/ - 5.94 , 80.35 +/ - 5.66 and 62.61 +/ - 8.28 % for doses of 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 and 1x10 - 5 m , respectively .
in the rats treated with atorvastatin , h2o2 caused a significant dose - dependent decrease in myocardial contractions ( 72.09 +/ - 3.80 , 66.59 +/ - 3.14 and 48.96 +/ - 8.93 % for h2o2 doses of 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 and 1x10 - 5 m , respectively ; 1x10 - 5 vs. 1x10 - 7 m and 1x10 - 6 m , p < 0.01 ) .
in the resveratrol group , no significant changes in contraction were observed following h2o2 application at all doses ( 87.91 +/ - 2.33 , 89.66 +/ - 14.91 and 79.77 +/ - 17.33 % for h2o2 doses of 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 and 1x10 - 5 m , respectively ; p > 0.05 ) .
in the r + a group , the contraction results following h2o2 application were 76.57 +/ - 1.40 , 66.34 +/ - 5.91 and 66.55 +/ - 11.10 % for 1x10 - 7 , 1x10 - 6 and 1x10 - 5 m h2o2 , respectively ; h2o2 application did not significantly decrease the contractions when its concentration was increased .
intergroup myocardial results intergroup comparisons of the myocardial results were evaluated for all doses of h2o2 .
at 1x10 - 7 m h2o2 the atorvastatin group showed a significantly lower contraction percentage when compared with the control and resveratrol groups ( p < 0.01 ) .
the r + a group also demonstrated a significant decrease in contraction percentage when compared with the control group ( p < 0.01 ) .
however , no significant difference was observed between the contraction percentages of the resveratrol and control groups ( fig. 1a ) .
following a 20 - min washing period , the organ bath was adjusted to 1x10 - 6 m h2o2 .
the myocardial contractions of the atorvastatin and r + a groups were significantly lower than those control group ( p < 0.05 ) .
the resveratrol group tissues showed a significantly higher percentage contraction than those of the atorvastatin and r + a groups ( p < 0.01 ) .
no significant difference was observed between the myocardial contractions in the resveratrol and control groups ( fig. 1b ) .
at the final dose of h2o2 ( 1x10 - 5 m ) , the atorvastatin group exhibited a significant decrease in contraction compared with all the other groups ( atorvastatin versus control and r + a groups , p < 0.05 ; atorvastatin versus resveratrol group ; p < 0.01 ) .
the results of the present study demonstrated that resveratrol treatment alone attenuated the decrease in contraction percentage and that this effect was significant compared with all groups at 1x10 - 5 m h2o2 ( p < 0.01 vs. atorvastatin and control and p < 0.05 vs. r + a ) .
in the r + a group , the contraction percentages were higher than those in the atorvastatin group but significantly lower than those in the resveratrol group ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 1c ) .
results of thoracic aorta responses fig. 2 shows the cumulative dose responses to h2o2 ( between 1x10 - 8 and 1x10 - 4 m ) in aortic segments for the control , resveratrol , atorvastatin and r + a groups , with and without 1x10 - 4 m l - name incubation .
in all groups , h2o2 caused vasoconstriction and the contraction responses increased in a concentration - dependent manner .
the aortic rings reached their maximum contraction at 1x10 - 4 m h2o2 , and the maximum contraction responses were 16.14 +/ - 1.09 , 7.50 +/ - 0.75 , 6.82 +/ - 1.33 and 5.58 +/ - 1.37 % for the control , atorvastatin , resveratrol and r + a groups , respectively .
the h2o2 responses were significantly lower in the treatment groups than those in the control group at 1x10 - 4 and 1x10 - 5 m h2o2 ( control versus atorvastatin and resveratrol groups , p < 0.05 ; control versus r + a group , p < 0.01 ) .
when the maximum vasoconstriction responses of the treatment groups were examined , no statistical differences were identified among the resveratrol , atorvastatin and r + a groups ( fig. 2a ) .
following incubation with 1x10 - 4 m l - name for 30 min , the contraction responses of the tissues to h2o2 significantly increased when compared with their previous responses ( fig. 2b ) .
in all groups , l - name incubation significant augmented the h2o2 response at 1x10 - 5 and 1x10 - 4 m when compared with the response without l - name incubation ( fig. 3 ) .
the maximum responses were 25.56 +/ - 3.32 , 18.06 +/ - 1.74 , 26.19 +/ - 3.17 and 23.24 +/ - 3.24 % for the control , atorvastatin , resveratrol and r + a groups , respectively .
the thoracic aorta responses demonstrated that treatment of rats with resveratrol , atorvastatin and r + a resulted in a significantly lower vascular contraction response to h2o2 at a concentration 1x10 - 4 m when compared with the control group .
however , this result was eliminated with 1x10 - 4 m l - name incubation .
discussion the cardiac results of the present study revealed that oral administration of 40 mg / kg atorvastatin for 14 days resulted in a more sensitive myocardial response to h2o2 in rats .
treatment with 30 mg / kg i.p. resveratrol showed a cardioprotective effect against atorvastatin - aggravated and h2o2 - induced contractile dysfunction in the rat myocardium .
furthermore , the study revealed that atorvastatin and resveratrol exhibited a protective effect against h2o2 - induced vasoconstriction and that this protective effect was mediated by no. vasoconstriction induced by cumulative concentrations of h2o2 was augmented with l - name incubation .
these results indicated that the vasoconstriction elicited by high concentrations of h2o2 was negatively modulated by the endothelium .
no exerted a protective effect to counteract the oxidative effect of h2o2 in the groups without l - name incubation .
the protective effect of no on h2o2 in endothelial monolayer permeability has been previously demonstrated by mcquaid et al ( 18 ) .
in their study , it was concluded that , although lower levels of no may only give a small amount of cytoprotection , the barrier dysfunction in the endothelium caused by h2o2 may be partially reversed by no ( 13 ) .
it may be concluded from the results of the present study that the protective effect of resveratrol and / or atorvastatin treatment may be attributed to increased no production in the vascular endothelium .
under normal conditions , the h2o2 concentrations in human plasma , blood and vascular cells are likely to be in the lower micromolar ranges or below .
however , in pathological states , including myocardial ischemia and heart failure , it has been demonstrated that h2o2 concentrations can increase to millimolar levels ( 19 - 21 ) .
atorvastatin impairs cholesterol production by inhibiting the synthesis of mevalonate .
in addition to cholesterol - lowering effects , statins inhibit the biosynthesis of the major natural antioxidants ubiquinone ( ubiphenol ) q10 and glutathione peroxidase ( 22 - 24 ) .
as a result of this , statins may aggravate oxidative stress in the organism .
such aggravating effects of statins on the myocardium have previously been demonstrated ( 16 ) .
these changes may modulate myocardial contractility .
a previous study revealed that an increase in reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the myocardium resulted in ischemia , reperfusion injury and myocardial damage ( 25 ) .
studies on the antioxidant effects of statins have been performed using oxidative stress markers ( osms ) in body fluids ( 26 - 29 ) .
although osms are accepted to reflect the levels of oxidative stress within tissues , arguelles et al ( 30 ) demonstrated that osms were not correlated with the tissue levels of oxidative stress ; furthermore , they suggested that osms did not reflect the local oxidative stress status of individual organs .
this is consistent with the results of the present study , in which atorvastatin treatment aggravated the h2o2 response in the myocardial tissue and showed a protective effect on h2o2 - induced vascular contractions .
although the current study did not assess the antioxidant capacity of the myocardium , the diminished myocardial response may be attributed to decreased levels of antioxidant agents in the myocardium , including ubiquinone q10 , whose production is hmg - coa reductase - dependent ( 31 ) .
the protective effect of resveratrol can be attributed to its inhibitory effect on ros production in the myocardium ( 32 ) .
increased levels of pro - oxidants have been associated with vascular diseases and they are considered to be an important initial step in the development of vascular diseases , including atherosclerosis and hypertension ( 33 ) .
the present study demonstrated that atorvastatin treatment disrupted es - induced myocardial function in the presence of h2o2 , but that its co - treatment with resveratrol recovered this effect .
r + a treatment also exhibited a protective effect on h2o2 - induced vascular responses. from these results , resveratrol appears to be a promising treatment for the improvement of myocardial function in diseases associated with the development of oxidative stress .
resveratrol has been a popular choice in otc products .
resveratrol is frequently used for the prevention of atherosclerosis ; thus , the indications for its administration appear to be similar to those for the administration of statins .
the combined treatment of r + a provides a superior treatment for cvd compared with treatment with either agent alone .

abstract introduction motor endplates are composed of a motor neuron terminal and muscle fiber and are distributed in skeletal muscle , causing muscle contraction .
however , traditional motor endplate staining methods are limited to the observation of partial skeletal muscle .
the procedure was time - consuming due to strict incubation conditions , and usually provided unsatisfactory results .
we explored a novel method to label motor endplate rapidly by in vivo injection of fluorescent alpha - bungarotoxin .
methods fifty - two mice were randomly divided into two groups , an experiment group ( n = 50 ) , and a contrast group ( n = 2 ) .
in experiment group , alpha - bungarotoxin was injected via the caudal vein .
the injection dosages were designated as 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 mug / g. the experimental mice were divided into five subgroups of ten mice per group .
the contrast group was only injected with 200 mul normal saline solution .
bilateral gastrocnemius were acquired for microscope analysis and optical clearing to seek specific fluorescent signal .
results a dose of 0.3 mug / g of alpha - bungarotoxin with 1 h conjugation time could display the number and structure of motor endplate in plane view .
compared with the traditional procedure , this method was rapid , convenient , and time - saving .
combined with the optical clearing technique , spatial distribution could also be seen , helping to better understand the stereoscopic view of motor endplate position in skeletal muscle .
conclusions in vivo injection of alpha - bungarotoxin proved effective for studying motor endplate in skeletal muscle .

introduction mep ( motor endplate ) was described in 1928 by cajal ( sanes and lichtman 1999 ) .
mep receives motor neuron transmission signals to maintain muscle tone .
degeneration of mep caused by nerve trauma and autoimmune antibodies leads to muscle dysfunction and atrophy .
research into nervous system development ( wu et al. 2010 ) , myasthenia gravis ( lindstrom 2000 ) , and nerve injury repair ( kang et al. 2014 ) has focused on the mep .
the alpha - btx ( alpha - bungarotoxin ) conjugated with fluorescent dyes or radioisotopes clearly reveals the structure of mep , and has been applied in research to enable morphological observation ( sine 1997 ; wu and mei 2013 ) .
however , traditional mep staining methods that are time - consuming , lead to indistinct staining and are limited to the partial local characteristic observation of skeletal muscle .
meps can be viewed under fluorescent microscope in limited areas representing only a portion of muscle .
the full observation of mep in skeletal muscle requires a large amount of tissue sections , which is time - consuming and complicated .
based on the characteristics of alpha - btx that include high affinity and irreversible binding to mep , we hypothesized that alpha - btx conjugated with fluorescent dye could be injected in vivo to label the mep .
materials and methods animals this study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of the institutional animal care guidelines and approved ethically by the administration committee of experimental animals , peking university people 's hospital ( beijing , china , permit number : 2013 - 24 ) .
a total of 52 mice with a homogeneous c57bl / 6 background , aged 8 - weeks , and each weighing 20 +/ - 2 g , were obtained from the laboratory animal center of peking university ( beijing , china ) and anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate via intraperitoneal injection .
the animals were randomly divided into two groups , an experiment group ( n = 50 ) , and a contrast group ( n = 2 ) .
in the experiment group , alexa fluor 594 - bungarotoxin ( b13423 ; invitrogen , new york , ny ) was injected via the caudal vein .
the injection dosages were designated as 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 mug / g. the experimental mice were divided into five subgroups of ten mice per group .
the alpha - btx was diluted into 200 mul distilled water .
the contrast group was injected with 200 mul normal saline solution .
histology the mice were over anesthetized to death 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 h after the alpha - btx injection and tissues samples were immediately taken .
animals were perfused transcardially with 0.9 % sodium chloride solution , then with 4 % paraformaldehyde solution .
the intact bilateral gastrocnemius was dissected from the proximal femoral attachment and distal achilles tendon , with surrounding tissues left intact , then postfixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 12 h at 4degreesc .
the samples were dehydrated in 20 % and 30 % sucrose for 8 h. consecutive frozen sections measuring 60 mum were taken using a freezing microtome ( leica cm1900 , leica microsystems , heidelberg , germany ) .
slides were stored at - 20degreesc before analysis .
twelve slides from the proximal , middle , and distal portion of gastrocnemius muscle were selected for analysis under confocal microscope for positive fluorescent signal .
confocal microscope analysis the sections were viewed under confocal microscope ( tcs sp8 - confocal - mp - flim ; leica ) with 561 nm argon / krypton laser line exciting the alexa fluor .
mep images were collected with a 10x microscope objective .
once a fluorescent signal was positive in the microscopic field , 60 - mum thick stacks in z - axis ( 2 mum steps ) were acquired , as the area of interest was confirmed , with a 40x oil immersion microscope objective .
each optical section was then added to a stack of images using leica data processing software ( las af , leica , heidelberg , germany ) .
optical clearing technique the method of optical clearing was based on the 3disco technique ( erturk et al. 2012 ) .
the dissected and postfixed gastrocnemius muscle was treated with serial incubation in 50 % , 70 % , 80 % , and 100 % tetrahydrofuran for full dehydration and further incubation in 100 % dibenzyl ether for refractive index matching .
during the clearing procedure , the sample was placed on a rotator for gentle shaking for 2 h. the fluorescence images were acquired with ultramicroscope ( lavisionbiotec , bielefeld , germany ) , equipped with mv plapo 2x / 0.5 dry objective ( w.d. 20 mm ) , and dipping extension cap .
the acquired images were analyzed using image j software ( nih , bethesda , md ) and reconstructed into mip ( maximum - intensity projection ) .
results under confocal microscope , the specific fluorescent signal ( bright red ) of mep could be viewed in the 0.3 mug / g subgroup ( fig. 1a and b ) and stabilized after more than 1 h injection of alpha - btx ( fig. 1c - f & table 1 ) .
mep flat plane projection of the z - stacked confocal image in the gastrocnemius showed " pretzel - shaped " appearance ( fig. 2 ) .
mip revealed that mep in gastrocnemius was distributed in linear clusters , in a " root " shape ( fig. 3 ) .

the upper section represents medial and lateral heads of gastrocnemius , and lower section , achilles tendon .
discussion motor endplate plays an important role in muscle contraction and damage to mep has been considered to contribute to functional deficits after nerve injury ( pratt et al. 2013 ) .
previous studies have revealed that mep is not permanent ( fambrough et al .
1979 ) , and can change and remodel during functional recovery ( tomas i ferre et al. 1987 ) .
more recently , alpha - btx has been applied for observation of the morphological structure of mep .
traditional staining methods were performed with tissue sections taken , followed by incubation with alpha - btx , but this is time - consuming and complicated. with the help of confocal fluorescent microscopy , a laser can penetrate 500 mum sections that approximately equal the thickness of small flat muscles ( hama et al. 2011 ) .
the whole - mounting technique reveals mep distribution in small and flat muscle tissue , such as intracranial muscle ( murray et al .
2010 ) , diaphragm , and sternocleidomastoid ( lichtman et al. 1987 ; marques and santo neto 2002 ) .
however , the whole - mounting technique did not work for larger muscles such as gastrocnemius .
for further observation of internal mep in larger skeletal muscles , consecutive sections of muscle are needed , potentially causing loss of information and misjudgment of mep position .
therefore , other techniques have been explored for investigation of mep distribution in larger muscles .
the molecular weight of alpha - btx is 8000 da. it shows high affinity and specific binding to mep .
based on these characteristics , we first injected alpha - btx in vivo .
in one previous study , 125i - btx was injected into tibialis anterior muscles .
the results showed a rapid loss of radioactive signal within the first minutes of injection , indicating that intramuscularly injected 125i - btx did not effectively bind to mep ( strack et al. 2011 ) .
therefore , we performed intravenous alpha - btx injection through the caudal vein in anaesthetized mice .
according to known lethal dosages to humans and to mice , the dosages used were 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , and 0.5 mug / g , to explore effective and minimal dosage .
in the experimental group , mice were divided into several subgroups .
at different time points after injection , intact gastrocnemius was acquired for further histological examination .
the results showed that alpha - btx could penetrate vessel walls and bind the mep located in gastrocnemius .
the structure of mep was clearly visible with dosages of more than 0.3 mug / g ( fig. 1a and b ) .
one hour was enough to label mep with stable fluorescent signal after injection ( fig. 1c - f & table 1 ) .
the mep image for the gastrocnemius muscle was " pretzel " like ( fig. 2 ) , as described in previous study ( pratt et al. 2013 ) .
these results revealed that a 0.3 mug / g dosage and 1 h conjugation time was sufficient for the visualization of mep .
compared with traditional procedures , it was a rapid and convenient method of labeling mep , facilitating mep staining .
optical clearing technique can facilitate internal and deep microstructure imaging in tissue with preservation of tissue integrity , and are widely used in medical imaging for accurate reconstruction ( yu et al. , 2011 ; hama et al. 2015 ) .
using a combination of in vivo injection of alpha - btx and the optical clearing technique enabled us to explore mep distribution in gastrocnemius in our research .
during the optical clearing procedure , the fluorescent alexa fluor was stable with no significant fluorescent signal attenuation under confocal microscopy .
the maximum intensity projection of mep in gastrocnemius revealed that mep was distributed in linear clusters , arranged in a " root " shape ( fig. 3 ) .
this may correspond with christensen 's findings in a different perspective ( christensen 1959 ) and also proves that injected alpha - btx can bind the internal mep in skeletal muscle .
our novel technique is proposed as a method of obtaining accurate information about mep in skeletal muscle , with no loss of detail of the integral structure .
it can also be extrapolated that integrated mep information from other skeletal muscles could be acquired , such as from the anterior tibialis , quadriceps femoris , and biceps brachii , after only one intravenous injection of alpha - btx .
this information can be applied to the study of mep in myasthenia gravis , nervous system development , and degeneration and regeneration after nerve injury , to obtain information such as number and structure .
in conclusion , a 0.3 mug / g dose of alpha - btx with 1 h conjugation time results in clear display of the mep in c57bl / 6 mice .
this novel technique for studying mep in skeletal muscle simplifies the traditional immunohistochemistry procedure and is rapid , convenient , and effective .

many cancer patients have been shown to generate cd8 cytotoxic t cell responses to tumour - associated antigens .
however , this is often insufficient for the immune system to clear tumours , resulting in the progression of cancer .
this is in part due to the low avidity of these t cells , as well as the ability of cancer cells to develop escape mechanisms to avoid destruction by t cells .
methods to overcome these issues , we have engineered novel , bi - functional protein therapeutics termed immtacs ( immune mobilising monoclonal tcr against cancer ) which re - direct the immune system to target and destroy tumour cells with a high degree of potency and specificity .
an immtac comprises a high affinity ' monoclonal ' t cell receptor ( mtcr ) targeting a cancer - associated hla - peptide complex , fused to an anti - cd3 scfv domain which activates an anti - tumour t cell response .
results we have developed an integrated in - house process leading to the isolation of tcrs specific for validated cancer epitopes forming the starting material for immtac production .
the essential steps in this procedure are : antigen selection , epitope identification , t cell cloning , tcr isolation and binding to soluble peptide : mhc on the biacore .
high affinity immtacs are then generated through a process of affinity maturation .
conclusions the steps leading to the cloning of wild type tcrs are presented here , together with exemplary data to illustrate the successful isolation of tcrs resulting from this process .

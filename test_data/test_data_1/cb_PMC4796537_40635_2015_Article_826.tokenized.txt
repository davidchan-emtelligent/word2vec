([ 1 ]) the benefit to all ventilated patients in the icu is less clear. ([ 2 ]) an informal survey of the southwest region of the uk confirmed that on admission of a ventilated patient , most units measure patient height using a 1 m tape , derive predicted body weight ( pbw ) and convert this to tidal volume ( tv ) using 6 to 8 mls / kg. many units audit their adherence to low tidal volume ventilation .
however , there are no reports of the accuracy of estimating predicted body weight in supine unwell patients on which these lung protective strategies are based .
objectives the aim of this project was to assess the accuracy and precision of patient measurement and pbw estimation in our unit and to evaluate alternative techniques .
methods and results as a snapshot of current practice , a random sample of 20 nurses were asked to measure 20 patients using their normal technique and our standard 1 m tapes , as is our normal practice .
they were blinded to each other 's measurements .
there was a surprisingly high degree of variability in the measurements leading to differences in derived tv's. the largest tv difference from the mean tv calculated for a single patient was 63 mls ( 17 % of mean tv for this patient ) figure 1 demonstrates the spread in tv values from the mean calculated for each patient .
figure 1 we examined alternative techniques to derive pbw ([ 3 ]) : olecranon to ulnar styloid distance , knee to sole height and sternal notch to tip of middle finger .
21 members of nursing staff measured the predicted body weight of 8 subjects using the 4 different techniques .
individuals were blinded to other 's measurements and standing height was used as a " gold standard " for comparison .
figure 2 shows the tv difference and range of values generated by each modality as compared to the gold standard .
figure 2 the data demonstrates that no technique is accurate to standing height measurement and that most underestimate true height .
sternum to middle finger is most precise but least accurate and the others broadly compare .
conclusions much work has gone into elucidating the optimal mls / kg for ventilation of critically unwell patients with great emphasis on getting the numerator right .
error in measurements used to estimate pbw have not received the same scrutiny .
when used to generate tv 's , these will be amplified by multiplication possibly leading to clinically significant higher tv settings .
as a centre , we have invested in 2 m tapes and are considering laser measurers to improve our ventilation strategies .

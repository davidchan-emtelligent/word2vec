reported herein is the complete genome sequence of brachyspira pilosicoli strain p43 / 6 / 78t , isolated from a pig with clinical disease .
this sequence will aid in the study of genome - wide comparison among brachyspira species .
cover - datejanuary / february 2013access - typefree genome announcement among the brachyspira species , brachyspira pilosicoli has the unique capacity to colonize and infect a wide range of hosts , including human beings , nonhuman primates , dogs , pigs , and wild and domestic avian species ( 1 - 7 ) .
in all hosts , b. pilosicoli causes colonic spirochetosis ( cs ) , a polymicrobial disease characterized by persistent intimate mucosal epithelial cell attachment of spirochetes alone or together with certain enterohepatic helicobacter species ( 4 , 8 ) .
in developing countries , b. pilosicoli can be recovered from stool specimens obtained from immunocompetent individuals , while in western societies it is found primarily among homosexual men and hiv - positive individuals , some with diarrhea , abdominal pain , and rectal bleeding ( 9 ) .
systemic spread of b. pilosicoli has been reported mostly in critically ill human patients , some with diarrheal disease ( 10 , 11 ) .
in order to further investigate the pathogenesis of cs , the complete or partial genome sequences of several brachyspira species have been determined ; however , to date the complete genome sequence of the b. pilosicoli porcine isolate p43 / 6 / 78t has not been determined or analyzed ( 1 , 3 ) .
the genome sequence of b. pilosicoli strain p43 / 6 / 78t was determined by using paired - end and shotgun libraries of purified genomic dna and the 454 pyrosequencing technology ( gs flx titanium genome sequencer system ; 454 life sciences corporation , branford , ct ) .
the total 454 gs flx reads from both paired - end and shotgun libraries provided approximately 38 - fold coverage of the bacterial genome .
a combination assembly of the two libraries was done by using newbler assembler version 2.0.00.20 ( 454 life sciences corp. ) , and 19 scaffolds (> 500 bp ) were generated .
primer 3 ( 12 ) was used to design pcr primers to amplify gaps between scaffolds , and pcr products were sequenced by the sanger dna sequencing method at the cornell university life sciences core laboratories center .
final closure of the genome was accomplished by repeated cycles of sequence assembly incorporating gap sequences by using sequencher version 4.8 ( gene codes corporation , ann arbor , mi ) .
genome annotation was performed by the national center for biotechnology information ( ncbi ) prokaryotic genome automatic annotation pipeline .
the genome of b. pilosicoli strain p43 / 6 / 78t consists of a single circular 2,555,556 - bp chromosome with a g + c content of 27.9 mol % .
the annotated genome counts 2,208 protein - coding genes , of which 688 represent proteins without a known function (" hypothetical genes ") and 100 genes have been disrupted by a potential frameshift .
the type strain of b. pilosicoli seems most similar to the previously sequenced porcine strain b. pilosicoli 95 / 1000 ( genbank accession no .
cp002025 ) from australia ( 13 ) , with 98.7 % average blast nucleotide identity and over 93 % of the genome that could be aligned to the 95 / 1000 genome sequence .
the two strains show a high level of synteny and share approximately 1,995 orthologous genes .
the majority of the genes that are found only in b. pilosicoli p43 / 6 / 78t but not in 95 / 1000 are hypothetical genes , but some , such as a beta - galactosidase gene and a gene cluster putatively involved in o - antigen variation , may have important phenotypic implications .
nucleotide sequence accession number .
the complete genome sequence of b. pilosicoli strain p43 / 6 / 78t has been deposited in genbank under the accession number cp002873 .

the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) has emerged as an important target for cancer treatment .
hdn - 1 , an epipolythiopiperazine - 2 , 5 - diones ( etps ) compound , was here identified as a new hsp90 inhibitor .
hdn - 1 bound directly to c - terminus of hsp90alpha , resulting in a potential conformational change that interfered with the binding of 17 - aag and novobiocin to hsp90alpha .
in contrast , association of 17 - aag , novobiocin or atp with hsp90alpha did not prevent the binding hdn - 1 to hsp90alpha .
hdn - 1 in combination with 17 - aag exhibited an enhanced inhibitory effect on non - small lung cancer cell proliferation .
molecular docking analyses revealed that hdn - 1 bound to hsp90alpha at c - terminal 526 - 570 region .
in addition , hdn - 1 degraded multiple oncoproteins and promoted egf - induced wild type and mutated egfr downregulation .
notably , chaetocin , used as a suv39h1 inhibitor with similar structure to hdn - 1 , bound to hsp90 and degraded hsp90 client proteins and suv39h1 as did hdn - 1 .
these results indicate that hdn - 1 and chaetocin are inhibitors of hsp90 and that suv39h1 is a novel client protein of hsp90 .
pipolythiodioxopiperazines hdn - 1 chaetocin inhibitor hsp90 introduction heat shock protein 90 ( hsp90 ) is an evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperone .
human hsp90 has four human isoforms .
the two cytosolic isoforms in mammalian cells include the major , inducible hsp90alpha and the minor , constitutively expressed , hsp90beta [ 1 ] .
hsp90 participates in stabilizing and activating more than 200 proteins , referred to as hsp90 ' clients ' .
many of hsp90 client proteins are essential for cell signaling and adaptive responses to stress [ 2 , 3 ] .
importantly , some hsp90 clients are bona fide oncoproteins , linked to all six hallmarks of cancer as defined by hanahan and weinberg , and inhibitor of hsp90 was seemed to be able to simultaneously affect all six hallmarks of cancer [ 4 ] .
hsp90 is frequently upregulated in many solid tumors and hematological malignancies , protecting an array of mutated and overexpressed oncoproteins from misfolding and degradation and activating them .
these oncoproteins include egfr , akt , cyclind1 , bcr - abl , erb - b2 , craf , braf , met , vegfr , flt3 , androgen and estrogen receptors , and hypoxia - inducible factor ( hif ) - 1alpha [ 5 , 6 ] .
inhibition of hsp90 induces apoptosis through inhibition of the multiple growth signalings [ 7 ] , and hsp90 has been recognized as a crucial facilitator of oncogene addiction and cancer cell survival and has emerged as an important target in cancer therapeutics [ 8 , 9 ] .
hsp90 forms a homodimer and each monomer contains three flexibly linked regions , an n - terminal domain ( 1 - 275 aa ) , middle domain ( 275 - 444 aa ) , and a c - terminal domain ( 444 - 677 aa ) [ 10 , 11 ] .
n - terminal domain binds to atp , co - chaperones , and potentially client proteins .
middle domain , which contains a catalytic arginine required for the atpase activity , binds to co - chaperones and is thought to be the major client - protein binding domain .
c - terminal domain contains a second atp - binding site and the major dimerization interface , which makes hsp90 a constitutive dimer .
the c - terminus is a highly conserved meevd motif , which binds to tpr - containing co - chaperones [ 2 ] .
early attempts of drug development concentrated on blocking atp binding at the n - terminal domain of hsp90 .
two natural products , geldanamycin ( ga ) and radiciol , and other synthetic small - molecule inhibitors , such as 17 - aag , ipi - 504 , kf58333 , auy922a , biib021 , and snx2112 , have been shown to possess anti - proliferative activity and target the atp - binding site in the n - terminal domain of hsp90 .
up to now , 13 hsp90 inhibitors representing multiple drug classes are undergoing clinical evaluation , and many more compounds are in pre - clinical development [ 9 ] .
however , human clinical trials involving these hsp90 n - terminal inhibitors revealed that most of these inhibitors exhibit unfavorable toxicity profiles and tendency to induce expression of cytoprotective hsp70 proteins [ 5 , 12 ] .
because of the growing understanding of the mechanisms underlying the function of hsp90 in malignant transformation , c - terminal / middle domains of hsp90 inhibitor , co - chaperone / hsp90 interactions inhibitors , client / hsp90 associations , and cell surface hsp90 inhibitors have now been under investigation [ 13 , 14 ] .
epipolythiopiperazine - 2 , 5 - diones ( etps ) constitute an important class of biologically active compounds , characterized by a bridged polysulfide piperazine ring .
hdn - 1 ( figure 1 ) is a novel etps obtained from the antarctic fungus oidiodendron truncatum gw3 - 13 , which was isolated from the soil under lichens near to the great wall station ( chinese antarctic station ) .
hdn - 1 has significant cytotoxic activities against various human cancer cell lines [ 15 ] .
our preliminary studies revealed that hdn - 1 simultaneously inhibited various proteins expression , which suggested that hdn - 1 is a new hsp90 inhibitor .
in the present study , we investigated the relationship between hdn - 1 and hsp90 , and examined the effect of hdn - 1 on hsp90 regulation compared with that exhibited by the n - terminal inhibitor 17 - aag and c - terminal inhibitor novobiocin .
our results demonstrated that hdn - 1 is a novel c - terminal inhibitor of hsp90 .
in addition , we revealed that chaetocin functions as inhibitor of hsp90 and suv39h1 is a new client protein of hsp90 .
figure 1 chemical structure of hdn - 1 results hdn - 1 binds to hsp90alpha to investigate whether hdn - 1 directly binds to hsp90alpha , we used surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) to determine the interaction between hdn - 1 and hsp90alpha , which was biotinylated and immobilized onto a streptavidin - coated sensor chip .
as shown in figure 2a , typical sensorgrams of the interaction between hdn - 1 and hsp90alpha were obtained at 30 , 15 , 7.5 and 1.8 mum of hdn - 1 .
the dissociation constant ( kd values ) of hdn - 1 was 14.6 mum , indicating that hdn - 1 binds to hsp90alpha with moderate affinity .
to identify the binding site of hdn - 1 , we injected 17 - aag , novobiocin or atp over the chip before or after hdn - 1 inclusion .
we found that hdn - 1 was able to associate with hsp90alpha that was pre - bounded with 17 - aag ( figure 2b ) , novobiocin ( figure 2c ) or atp ( figure 2d ) .
in contrast , a pre - association of hdn - 1 with hsp90alpha reduced the binding of hsp90alpha to novobiocin ( figure 2c ) or atp ( figure 2d ) .
these results strongly suggest that hdn - 1 binds to hsp90alpha in a manner different from 17 - aag , novobiocin and atp .
the binding hdn - 1 to hsp90alpha may alter hsp90alpha conformation that prevents the access of hsp90alpha to 17 - aag , novobiocin and atp .
figure 2 interaction of hdn - 1 with hsp90 immobilized on a glh sensor chip in the absence and presence of 17 - aag , novobiocin , and atp the binding ru was recorded as binding potency .

various concentrations ( 1.8 - 30 mum ) of hdn - 1 were injected into hsp90alpha - immobilized chip , and ru values were recorded .
( b ) the interplay of 17 - aag ( 50 mum ) and hdn - 1 ( 50 mum ) on binding to hsp90alpha .
black line : 50 mum 17 - aag was injected onto hsp90alpha - immobilized chip and the ru values were recorded in succession .
50 mum 17 - aag was replaced by 50 mum hdn - 1 200 seconds after the injection , and ru values were recorded unceasingly .
red line : 50 mum hdn - 1 was first injected onto hsp90alpha - immobilized chip and was replaced by 50 mum 17 - aag 200 seconds after the first injection .
( c ) the interplay of novobocin and hdn - 1 on binding to hsp90alpha .
black line : 50 mum novobocin was injected onto hsp90alpha - immobilized chip and ru values were recorded in succession .
novobocin was replaced by 50 mum hdn - 1 300 seconds after novobocin injection , and ru values were recorded ; red line : 50 mum hdn - 1 was first injected into hsp90alpha - immobilized chip and was replaced by 50 mum novobocin 300 seconds after hdn - 1 injection .
( d ) the atp did not affect the hdn - 1 's binding to hsp90alpha .
100 mum atp was injected into hsp90alpha - immobilized chip , and ru values were recorded , and was replaced by 50 mum hdn - 1300 seconds after atp injection .
hdn - 1 binds to c - terminus of hsp90alpha to determine the region of hsp90alpha that binds to hnd - 1 , we used competitive inhibition assay based on fluorescence polarization .
we found that n - terminal hsp90alpha inhibitor 17 - aag competed with ga to bind to full - length hsp90alpha ( ic50 ; 0.298 mum ) ( table 1 ) .
in contrast , hdn - 1 did not affect ga 's binding to hsp90 even at 10 mum concentration .
these results suggested that hdn - 1 and 17 - aag bind to different regions of hsp90alpha or the binding of hdn - 1 to hsp90alpha alters the hsp90alpha structure that prevents the binding of 17 - aag .
given that the conformational changes of proteins could lead to different proteolytic fingerprintings [ 14 ] , we performed proteolytic fingerprinting assay with purified full - length hsp90alpha proteins .
hsp90alpha protein was incubated with 17 - aag or hdn - 1 followed by limited trypsin digestion , the fragments containing the c - terminal domain of hsp90alpha were detected by an antibody specifically recognizing epitopes within the c - terminus .
as shown in figure 3a , hsp90alpha incubation with hdn - 1 generated a 50 kda c - terminal fragment .
in contrast , this fragment was not detected after 17 - aag incubation .
these results implicated that hdn - 1 interacts with the c - terminal domain of hsp90alpha and affects its degradation by trypsin .
figure 3 hdn - 1 binds to c - terminus of hsp90alpha ( a ) proteolytic fingerprinting of hdn - 1 and 17 - aag on hsp90alpha .
0.6 mug hsp90alpha was incubated with 200 mum hdn - 1 or 200 mum 17 - aag , then digested by tpck - treated trypsin and analyzed by western blotting with an anti - hsp90alpha ( c - terminus ) antibody .
( b ) hdn - 1 binds to c - terminal hsp90alpha .
the binding interactions were measured using the fortebio 's octet system for the interaction between hdn - 1 and biotin labeled c - hsp90alpha that was immobilized on nhs - lclc - biotin superstreptavidin biosensors .
the curve from top to bottom denotes 500 , 250 , 125 , 62.5 and 31.25 mum of the concentration of hdn - 1 respectively .

table 1 the effect of 17 - aag and hdn - 1 on the binding of ga to hsp90 compounds ic50 ( mum ) 17 - aag 0.298 hdn - 1 > 10 the combination of c - terminal and n - terminal hsp90 inhibitor may induce enhancing effects [ 16 , 17 ] .
we next examined the effects of 17 - aag ( 100 , 200 , 300 nm ) and hdn - 1 ( 100 , 200 nm ) , either alone or in combination , on growth inhibition of h1975 non - small cell lung cancer cells by the mtt assay ( the q value was calculated according to jin 's formula [ 18 ]) .
as shown in table 2 , co - treatment with 17 - aag and hdn - 1 greatly enhanced the cell proliferation inhibition in a dosage - dependent manner compared to the treatment with 17 - aag or hdn - 1 alone ( q value were greater than 0.85 ) , suggesting that hdn - 1 binds to c - terminus of hsp90 .
this finding was further supported by spr spectroscopy with recombinant c - terminal hsp90 fragment ( 535 - 732aa ) of human hsp90alpha immobilized onto chip .
figure 3b shows that hdn - 1 was able to bind to c - terminus of hsp90alpha with the kd value of 201 mum .

as shown in figure 3c and 3d , hdn - 1 was able to dock into c - terminus of hsp90alpha .
the hydroxyl groups in the hdn - 1 molecule formed two hydrogen bonds (< 3.0 a ) with residues glu529 and lys564 , and the rest of the molecule were stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with lys526 , phe528 , lys537 , arg540 , ile544 , tyr569 , and lys570 .
these results suggest that hdn - 1 binds to a novel site different from the reported bind sites of hsp90alpha n - terminal and c - terminal inhibitors [ 14 ] , and this novel binding site is probably at 526 - 570 region of hsp90alpha ( figure 3e ) .
hdn - 1 induces degradation of multiple oncoproteins we first tested the growth inhibitory effect of hdn - 1 on three non - small cell lung cancer cell lines h1975 , hcc827 and a549 .
hdn - 1 inhibited the proliferation of these cancer cell lines with an ic50 of 0.22 , 0.54 , and 1.06 mum , respectively ( table 3 ) .
we showed that h1975 cells , which contain t790m mutation were resistant to conventional egfr inhibitors , were sensitive to hdn - 1 treatment .
the hsp90 chaperone complex regulates many client oncoproteins that play key roles in tumor formation and progression [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] .
therefore , we next examined whether hdn - 1 induced degradation of hsp90 client oncoproteins .
we found that hdn - 1 treatment reduced the expression levels of egfr , stat3 , akt , and erk , and their active phosphorylated forms and downregulated the expression of raf and cyclin d1 in h1975 , hcc827 , and a549 cells , in dosage - ( figure 4a - 4c ) and time - ( figure 4d - 4f ) dependent manners .
these results suggested that binding of hdn - 1 to hsp90 resulted in inhibition of hsp90 activity and induced degradation of many client oncoproteins .
intriguingly , we noticed that hdn - 1 did not obviously affect hsp70 expression as did 17 - aag ( figure 4a - 4c ) .
it is reported that increase of hsp70 is a striking feature induced by hsp90 n - terminal inhibitors , such as 17 - aag [ 12 ] , while hsp90 c - terminal inhibitors do not regulate hsp70 expression [ 19 ] .
thus , our results are consistent with the previous reports and further support that hdn - 1 is an hsp90 c - terminal inhibitor .
figure 4 hdn - 1 induces degradation of multiple oncoproteins hdn - 1 treatment induced degradation of hsp90 client proteins in h1975 cells ( a , d ) , a549 cells ( b , e ) and hcc827 ( c , f ) in dosage - and time - dependent manners .
cells were incubated with hdn - 1 at indicated concentrations and time , and then subjected to western blotting assay with indicated antibodies .
( g ) hdn - 1 induced degradation of hif - 1alpha in h1975 and a549 cells under hypoxic condition .
cells were incubated with hdn - 1 at indicated concentrations in the presence of 250 mum cocl2 or cultured in low oxygen condition ( 5 % co2 and 2 % o2 ) .
( h ) the sensitivity of different hsp90 client proteins to hdn - 1 or 17 - aag treatment in h1975 cells .
cells were incubated with hdn - 1 or 17 - aag at indicated concentrations , and then analyzed by western blotting .
table 3 ic50s of hdn - 1 for non - small cell lung cancer cell proliferation cell lines ic50 ( mum ) h1975 0.22 a549 0.54 hcc827 1.06 solid tumors typically exhibit regions of poor oxygen supply or hypoxia , and the hif - 1alpha regulates an adaptive response to hypoxia .
hif - 1alpha expression has been correlated with resistance to radiation and chemotherapy as well as poor clinical prognosis .
since hif - 1alpha is a client protein of hsp90 [ 20 ] , we speculated that hif - 1alpha expression is regulated by hdn - 1 .
as expected , hif - 1alpha was degraded after cells were exposed to hdn - 1 under cocl2 - induced hypoxia ( figure 4g , top panel ) or under 5 % co2 and 2 % o2 condition ( figure 4g , bottom panel ) .
hsp90 client proteins may response to hsp90 inhibitors differently .
we next compared the sensitivity of different client proteins to hdn - 1 and 17 - aag .
we observed that some client proteins including abl , p - stat3 , and erk were more sensitive to hdn - 1 than 17 - aag , while others , such as egfr and akt , were more susceptible to 17 - aag than to hdn - 1 ( figure 4h ) .
one possible explanation is that hdn - 1 is an hsp90 c - terminal inhibitor and it may have a different selectivity of client proteins compared with n - terminal inhibitor 17 - aag .
hdn - 1 promotes ligand - induced egfr down - regulation in response to ligand stimulation , egfr undergoes a process of desensitization involving endocytosis , ubiquitination , and lysosomal degradation , which is called ligand - induced receptor downregulation ( lird ) .
however , lird was impaired in egfr mutant - expressing cells .
it is reported that hsp90 impaired cbl - mediated receptor downregulation , and inhibition of hsp90 function restores lird [ 21 ] .
to further evaluate the effect of hdn - 1 on egfr degradation , we examined egfr levels in the cells treated with egf for 1 to 5 h. in a549 cells with wild - type egfr , egfr level was markedly reduced after egf stimulation for 1 h. in contrast , h1975 and hcc827 cells with egfr mutant maintained egfr levels upon egf stimulation ( figure 5a ). of interest , hdn - 1 treatment largely reduces the egfr levels in egf - treated a549 , h1975 and hcc827 cells in dosage - and time - dependent manners ( figure 5b ) .
this suggested that hdn - 1 facilitated egf - induced egfr downregulation independent of the egfr mutation status .
figure 5 hdn - 1 promotes egf - induced egfr downregulation ( a ) egfr mutants in h1975 and hcc827 cells were resistant to be degraded upon egf treatment .
a549 , h1975 or hcc827 cells were cultured overnight with serum free medium and incubated with 25 ng / ml egf at indicated time .
egfr expression was determined by western blotting assay .
( b , c ) hdn - 1 promoted the reduction of egfr expression and upregulation of egfr tyr1045 phosphorylation upon egf stimulation in a549 , h1975 and hcc827 cells .
a549 , h1975 or hcc827 cells were incubated with hdn - 1 at indicated concentrations and time in the presence of 25 ng / ml egf .
egfr and egfr py1045 were determined by western blotting assay .
( d ) hdn - 1 increased the level of egfr ubiquitination in a549 cell .
a549 cells were pretreated with 10 mum mg132 for 1 h , and then incubated with hdn - 1 at indicated concentrations in the presence with 25 ng / ml egf for 30 min .
the levels of egfr ubiquitination were detected by an antibody for ubiquitin .
phosphorylation of egfr at tyr1045 creates a major docking site for the adaptor protein c - cbl , leading to receptor ubiquitination and degradation following egfr activation [ 22 ] .
we found that hdn - 1 upregulated the phosphorylation of egfr at tyr1045 in the three types of lung cancer cells in dosage - and time - dependent manners ( figure 5c ) .
in addition , hdn - 1 increased the level of egfr ubiquitination in a549 cells ( figure 5d ) .
all these results suggested that hdn - 1 promotes egfr endocytosis and degradation through inhibition of hsp90 .
chaetocin binds to and inhibits hsp90 hdn - 1 is an analogue of chaetocin ( figure 6a ) , which is a fungal mycotoxin with histone methyltransferase suv39h1 inhibitory activity [ 23 ] .
to determine whether chaetocin also acts as an hsp90 inhibitor , we determined chaetocin - hsp90 binding and hsp90 activity after chaetocin treatment .
as shown in figure 6b , chaetocin bound to hsp90 with kd values at 16.8 mum , which is close to the kd values of hdn - 1 .
the molecular docking analyses showed that chaetocin bound to hsp90 with the same binding sites and interaction pattern as did hdn - 1 ( figure 6c ) .
furthermore , chaetocin degraded client proteins , such as egfr , p - egfr , akt , p - akt , and cyclin d1 , at a dose similar to hdn - 1 ( figure 6d ) .
notably , the level of suv39h1 was found to decline upon chaetocin and hdn - 1 treatment ( figure 6e ) .
these results revealed that chaetocin is an inhibitor of hsp90 and suggested that hsp90 inhibition contribute to the inhibition on suv39h1 and that suv39h1 is a new client protein of hsp90 .
figure 6 chaetocin binds to and inhibits hsp90 ( a ) chemical structure of chaetocin .
( b ) interaction of chaetocin with hsp90alpha .
various concentrations of chaetocin were injected onto hsp90alpha - immobilized chip , and ru values were recorded .
( c ) a schematic illustration of the interaction between chaetocin and full - length hsp90alpha .
( d ) chaetocin induced degradation of hsp90 client proteins in h1975 cells .
cells were incubated with chaetocin at indicated concentrations for 24 h , then subjected to western blotting assay with indicated antibodies .
( e ) both hdn - 1 and chaetocin induced degradation of suv39h1 .
cells were incubated with hdn - 1 or chaetocin at indicated concentrations for 24 h , then subjected to western blotting assay with antibody for suv39h1 .
discussion hsp90 has been intensively targeted for cancer treatment .
here , we identified hdn - 1 and chaetocin as novel c - terminal hsp90 inhibitors .
chaetocin was regarded as an inhibitor of suv39h1 histone methyltransferase .
our results support that chaetocin has previously unknown function to bind to hsp90 and to inhibit hsp90 activity .
hsp90alpha is reported to be essential to the survival of cancer cells , and the expression of hsp90alpha is associated with different stress factors and leads to tumor progression , invasion and metastasis [ 24 ] .
to investigate whether hdn - 1 interacts with hsp90alpha , we performed spr analysis and showed that hdn - 1 bound to the full - length and the c - terminus of hsp90alpha with moderate affinity at kd values of 14.6 and 201 mum , respectively .
these affinities are higher than those of the current c - terminal inhibitors .
novobiocin , a c - terminal inhibitor used in cancer therapy , binds weakly to the c - terminus of atp binding site ( 660 - 680 aa ) of hsp90alpha at approximately 3.3 mm [ 25 , 26 ] .
it is reported that 17 - aag binds to the atp binding site ( 34 - 124 aa ) of hsp90 [ 27 ] .
the binding of 17 - aag , novobiocin , and atp to hsp90alpha did not affect the association of hdn - 1 with hsp90alpha .
however , hdn - 1 's binding to hsp90alpha impairs the subsequent binding of 17 - aag and novobiocin , suggesting that hdn - 1 induced conformational changes of hsp90alpha that affects the access of other inhibitors .
these findings were supported by proteolytic fingerprinting analyses showing that hdn - 1 induced a distinct pattern of hsp90 digestion to that induced by 17 - aag .
csermely and his co - workers have reported that the c - terminal site becomes available for binding only after occupancy of the n - terminal site , and both the n - and c - terminal chaperone sites may contribute to hsp90alpha function as chaperones [ 29 ] .
combination of novobiocin and ga had enhancing effects on proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of leukemia cells [ 30 , 31 ] .
in line with these reports , hdn - 1 was found to have enhancing effect in combination with 17 - aag , an n - terminal hsp90 inhibitor .
the binding of hdn - 1 to the c - terminal region of hsp90alpha was further supported by molecular docking analyses , showing that 526 - 570 domain of hsp90alpha with two hydrogen bonds binding at glu529 and lys564 is the interaction interface .
it is reported that the hsp90 c - terminus does not exhibit atpase activity and is involved in the conformational rearrangement of hsp90alpha upon atp binding .
the atpase activity of hsp90 , which leads to a conformational change of the entire homodimer , is dependent upon the hsp90 c - terminal region to trap the nucleotide during the atpase cycle [ 32 ] .
we found that atp did not interfere hdn - 1 - hsp90 binding measured by spr spectroscopy while hdn - 1 exhibited no effect on hsp90alpha atpase activity ( data not shown ) .
these results support that the binding of hdn - 1 to hsp90alpha is different from current c - terminal inhibitors , such as novobiocin , cisplatin , and epigallocatechin - 3 - gallate ( egcg ) , which bind to the hsp90 c - terminal domain and interferes with nucleotide binding .
activating mutations in the kinase domain of the egfr in nsclc are usually small exon 19 deletions and point mutations , and a replacement of leucine by arginine at codon 858 ( l858r ) in exon 21 is most commonly observed .
both types of mutations confer sensitivity to the anilinoquinazoline inhibitors of egfr , gefitinib .
despite the initial responses of egfr - mutant tumors to small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors , resistance universally emerges over time .
acquired resistance has been associated with a second somatic mutation , resulting in a threonine - to - methionine substitution at position 790 ( t790m ) of egfr .
it have been reported that egfr mutants depend on hsp90 for stability .
crucial targets of hsp90 - active drugs vary in different cell types , and hsp90 is permissive for the development of mutant egfr - dependent lung cancers , these kinase domain mutants are degraded by hsp90 inhibitors [ 20 , 33 ] .
evaluation of the effects of hdn - 1 on three nsclc cell lines expressing wild type egfr ( a549 ) , exon 19 deletions egfr ( hcc827 ) , or t790m egfr ( h1975 ) showed that hdn - 1 exhibited stronger inhibitory activity in the two cell lines with egfr mutation than the cells with wild type egfr .
importantly , hdn - 1 degrades multiple client proteins , such as egfr , stat3 , akt , erk , raf , cyclin d1 , and hif , all of which have been reported to be oncoproteins to promote cancer development .
these results indicate that hdn - 1 not only interacts with hsp90 , but also inhibit the cellular functions of hsp90 .
inhibition of hsp90 by targeting its n - terminus but not its c - terminus is often compensated by increased expression of hsp70 as well as other heat shock proteins [ 12 ] .
hdn - 1 , unlike 17 - aag , did not upregulate the expression of hsp70 , further supporting that hdn - 1 is an hsp90 c - terminal inhibitor .
furthermore , we found some client proteins including abl , p - stat3 , erk were more sensitive to hdn - 1 , while others , such as egfr , akt , p - akt , p - erk , were more sensitive to 17 - aag .
these results suggest that inhibitors for the n - terminus and c - terminus have distinct effect on the selected degradation of hsp90 client protein .
in normal tissues , the temporal and spatial distribution of extracellular growth factors determines the quantity and quality of intracellular signals .
once activated by stimulation , egfr initiates both positive and negative processes that convey signals to downstream pathways via the interaction with adaptor proteins and remove receptors from the cell surface .
in the latter case , the cbl family of ubiquitin ligases plays a major role in ligand - dependent ubiquitination of many receptor tyrosine kinases [ 16 ] .
egfr activation results in the binding of cbl to egfr tyr1045 for lird , and this egfr downregulation was impaired in egfr mutant - expressing cells .
hsp90 was detected in immunoprecipitates of egfr and may contribute to the resistance of egfr mutants to lird ; hence , hsp90 inhibitor would reverse the resistance [ 34 ] .
indeed , our studies showed that hdn - 1 increased egfr phosphorylation at tyr1045 and promoted cbl - mediated egfr ubiquitination and lird .
these results underscore the potential of hdn - 1 to overcome the resistance of tumor cells to egfr inhibitors .
hdn - 1 is analogue of chaetocin , which was previously identified as a specific inhibitor of histone methyltransferase suv39h1 [ 35 ] .
however , another report shows that chaetocin was a nonspecific suv39h1 inhibitor [ 36 ] .
here , we found that chaetocin inhibited multiple client proteins of hsp90 , which is unlikely due to the inhibition of suv39h1 .
suv39h1 specifically methylates k9 of histone h3 ( h3k9me3 ) in the promoter regions of genes , leading to repression of genes and inhibition of cell cycle progression and cell proliferation .
downregulation of h3k9me3 has been observed in several types of human cancers ( such as colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , and lung cancer ) , which arise from either the deficiency of h3k9 methyltransferases or elevated activity or expression of h3k9 demethylases [ 37 ] .
we demonstrated that chaetocin was inhibitors of hsp90 and reduced suv39h1 expression , suggesting that suv39h1 is a new client protein of hsp90 and chaetocin inhibits suv39h1 by inhibiting hsp90 - mediated suv39h1 stability .
in conclusion , we demonstrate hdn - 1 is a novel inhibitor of hsp90 , binding to the 526 - 570 regions in the c - terminus , but not to the second atp binding site .
in addition , our results support that chaetocin is an inhibitor of hsp90 and regulates suv39h1 stability .
as novel inhibitors of c - terminus of hsp90 , hdn - 1 and chaetocin are promising anticancer compounds .

surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy ( spr ) spr analysis was carried out with a proteon xpr36 instrument ( bio - rad ) or fortebio 's octet red96 to determine binding of various molecules to full length hsp90alpha or c - terminal hsp90alpha .
for full length hsp90alpha , hsp90alpha was coupled to the surface of a glh sensor chip using amine coupling .
the coupling has been performed according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
binding experiments were performed with multiple concentrations of hdn - 1 and chaetocin running over the surface of the chip at 25degreesc , at a constant flow rate of 30 mul / min in pbs - t ( 10 mm phosphate , 150 mm nacl , ph 7.4 and 0.005 % tween20 [ v / v ]) .
the sensor chip surface was regenerated using 0.85 % h3po4 .
changes in mass due to the binding response were recorded as resonance units ( ru ) .
to obtain the dissociation constant ( kd ) , these responses were fit to a 1:1 langmuir binding model by nonlinear regression using the biaevaluation 4.1 software program .
for interplay of hdn - 1 with other molecules , 50 mum 17 - aag , 50 mum novobiocin , or 100 mum atp was injected into hsp90alpha - immobilized chip and the ru values were recorded in succession for indicated time , then these compounds were replaced by 50 mum hdn - 1 , and ru values were recorded unceasingly .

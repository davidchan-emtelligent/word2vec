we conducted two research studies to address the malleability of tolerance of ambiguity ( ta ) by manipulating situational ambiguity .
students participated in a semester - end assessment of their management skills ( n = 306 ) .
in study 1 , students in low and moderate ambiguity conditions had significantly higher post - experiment ta , more positive change in self - efficacy , and marginally higher faculty ratings .
in study 2 , a control group ( n = 103 ) did not participate in the assessment and was established for comparison to the first study results .
the study 2 students reported ta significantly lower than study 1 students in the low and moderate ambiguity conditions .
the control group ta was not significantly different from that of the study 1 high ambiguity condition .
this further suggested ta 's situational malleability , as those who had controlled access to structured information appeared to have increased their ta over that observed in the other two groups .
these results suggest that ta may be malleable .
we review the relevant literature , offer hypotheses , report our analyses and findings , and then propose future research , and potential prescriptive applications in such areas as management development , assessment , and decision - making .
ambiguity tolerance experiment personality self - efficacy structured interview introduction tolerance of ambiguity ( ta ) is defined as the preference for ambiguous situations ( frenkel - brunswick , 1948 , 1949 , 1951 ) .
after decades of research , ta continues to be upheld as a critical variable in applied research as " increasingly necessary in the global workplace as socioeconomic forces stretch managers' capacities to perceive , interpret , and act on environmental information due to rapid globalization , technological advancement , and workforce diversity " ( herman et al. , 2010 , p. 54 ) .
despite a long history of research attention to ta and its application , its validity is still in question .
for example , ta was first introduced as an attitude a person holds toward objects or situations ( frenkel - brunswick , 1948 , 1949 , 1951 ) , but it has primarily been studied as a single factor stable trait ( furnham and marks , 2013 ) .
ta research is characterized by an overall lack of construct development ( herman et al. , 2010 ; furnham and marks , 2013 ) and weakness of its operationalizations ( grenier et al. , 2005 ; mclain , 2009 ) .
in fact , furnham and ribchester ( 1995 , p. 179 ) summarized the ta literature as " scattered and diffuse. " the ta literature is also plagued with an overwhelming preference for correlational studies and a lack of experimental design ( furnham and marks , 2013 ) , a problem personality research encounters in general ( huang and ryan , 2011 ) .
the lack of ta validity across studies has led to recent questions whether it is truly a stable personality trait or an attitude that varies by context ( e.g. , durrheim , 1998 ) .
the purpose of the present study was to investigate the stability of ta in an experimental manipulation of task ambiguity .
we conducted two studies in order to examine the malleability of ta shown by senior business students in a capstone - course simulation and the impact of varied task ambiguity on ta. we present hypotheses , method , measures , and results .
last , we discuss implications for research and practice .
literature review in order for a construct to be considered a stable trait , compelling research evidence is needed across contexts , or as mischel ( 2004 , p. 2 ) stated , " finding the invariance in variability. " in the case of ta , the tolerance trait should be stable across tasks and situations with varied ambiguity .
an ambiguous context is defined as one in which participants lack information they need to understand the situation or possible outcomes ( furnham and marks , 2013 , p. 718 ) .
frenkel - brunswick ( 1949 ) first identified ta as an attitudinal construct , describing it as varied within the person depending on the focus of the tolerance .
although original measures of ta were unidimensional , more recent measures have included multiple contexts in which ambiguity may exist , such as in family or work situations ( e.g. , mclain , 1993 , 2009 ; furnham , 1994 ; durrheim and foster , 1997 ; herman et al. , 2010 ) .
this modern contextual approach has often focused on individual reactions to ambiguity in varied situations or tasks ( e.g. , judge et al. , 1999 ; endres et al. , 2009 ; weisbrod , 2009 ; herman et al. , 2010 ) .
however , the contextual approach to studying ta most often still assumes within - person trait stability .
furthermore , measures of ta have tended to be psychometrically weak and have varied widely in their underlying dimensions ( herman et al. , 2010 ; furnham and marks , 2013 ) .
however , a few researchers have hypothesized and found within - person variation that suggests ta may be context - specific rather than trait - based ( e.g. , glover et al. , 1978 ; durrheim and foster , 1997 ; durrheim , 1998 ) .
first , glover et al .
( 1978 ) studied ta levels in students before and after a cross - cultural simulation wherein the students had to deal with a large amount of ambiguity .
a control group did not participate in the simulation .
prior to the simulation , experimental , and control groups' ta did not differ .
post - simulation ta levels of the experimental group were significantly higher than the post - simulation ta levels of the control group .
in one of the few experimental studies hypothesizing changes in ta , durrheim and foster ( 1997 ) found within - person variability across different content areas .
these content areas , such as political authorities and family , were specified in the authors' attitudinal ambiguity tolerance scale ( aat ) .
in a similar study , durrheim ( 1998 ) also found variability in the relationship of ta and conservatism across content domains .
in longitudinal studies , some researchers found that ta changed over time .
studies of age and ta have indicated some change in the construct over time and with experience .
helson and wink ( 1992 ) surveyed 118 working women at age 45 and then at age 52 and found a significant increase in participants' ta over the 7 - years period .
similarly , howard and bray ( 1988 ) found that managers' ta increased significantly over time .
other researchers suggested within - person changes in ta without evidence .
for example , researchers have repeatedly stated that international experiences increase ta ( e.g. , lashbrooke et al. , 2002 ) , or that intercultural training increases ta ( e.g. , harris , 1979 ) .
there is no experimental evidence to support these claims , however , ( tucker et al. , 2011 ) .
in short , ta is a prolific topic of research studies with a variety of contexts and playing multiple roles .
overwhelmingly , the construct has been assumed to be a stable trait , most often studied at one point in time in correlational research ( furnham and marks , 2013 ) .
only a few experimental manipulations exist to test within - person variability in ta. we do not offer specific hypotheses , but a research goal to further investigate the within - person variability in ta. study 1 the purpose of study 1 was to design an experiment in which subjects would face varied levels of ambiguity .
we expected controlling ambiguity in an experimental manipulation would provide valuable information about whether ta would significantly differ in each group .
in addition , we measured pre - experiment self - efficacy and post - experiment self - efficacy due to strong evidence supporting that ta and self - efficacy are positively related ( endres et al. , 2009 ) .
sample a total of 324 subjects ( 55.0 % male ) participated in an experiment1 .
the average subject age was 23.91 ( sd 4.31 ) .
students were from eight class sections of the senior - level capstone management class , and the experiment was implemented in the half - day assessment required of all management majors .
most ( 69.4 %) students were management majors , while the remaining were either management minors ( 18 %) or other business majors ( 12.6 %) taking the course as an elective .
methods and measures the assessment took place over a 3 - h period and included two parts : a management skills interview and a group case analysis .
the faculty assessment director visited the student participants' classes one month before assessment to explain specifics of participation and to hand out a harvard case study .
students were told to read and take notes on the case , to dress in business casual clothing and to arrive at a specific time .
student participants were randomly assigned to 35 teams , with four to five students on each team .
we randomly assigned teams to one of three conditions of low , moderate and high ambiguity : ( 1 ) structured interview of past experiences , or low ambiguity ( n = 127 ) , ( 2 ) structured interview of hypothesized future experience , or moderate ambiguity ( n = 94 ) , or ( 3 ) unstructured interview , or high ambiguity ( n = 103 ) .
management literature supports that the strengths of structured interviewing techniques are their lessening of ambiguity about requirements ( campion et al. , 1997 ) .
structured techniques ( as opposed to unstructured ) provide clearer instructions , more information , and follow a format that interviewees expect ( williamson et al. , 1997 ) .
structured interviews should lessen ambiguity about the process and allow more focus on the task .
unstructured interviews provide higher ambiguity to subjects than structured interviews .
unstructured interviews' lack of a common format and identifiable goals make individuals unsure of the purpose of the interview , even as they feel high levels of ambiguity and focus on the process , rather than the task ( e.g. , dibner , 1958 ) .
we also randomly assigned faculty evaluators to each of the three experimental conditions and , in some cases , a graduate student assisted in evaluating .
before the assessment , we trained both faculty and graduate students regarding the case study and procedures .
we used the evaluations prepared by faculty in our analyses as the measure of performance , although we used the graduate students' evaluations to establish inter - rater reliability .
on assessment day , students were directed to their groups in separate classrooms where they first filled out pre - assessment questionnaires .
next , students filled out a written interview answer sheet to prepare them for their subsequent oral interview .
for the unstructured interview group ( high ambiguity ) , the answer sheet questions included : ( 1 ) outside of today 's experiences , what are your key management skills that you would like us to know about ?
( 2 ) how do you demonstrate to someone else that you have these skills ?
for the structured past interview group ( low ambiguity ) , the answer sheet asked : ( 1 ) describe a situation in which you applied a management skill in the past .
( 2 ) describe the action you took ( 2 - 3 sentences ) .
( 3 ) describe the result of your action ( 2 - 3 sentences ) .
what was the outcome ?
how did you measure it ?
for the structured future interview group ( moderate ambiguity ) the answer sheet asked : ( 1 ) describe a situation in which you may apply management skills in the future .
( 2 ) describe the action you would take ( 2 - 3 sentences ) .
( 3 ) describe the likely result of your action ( 2 - 3 sentences ) .
how would you measure the outcome ?
the students had 10 min to finish the answer sheets after which the faculty evaluator asked questions of each student regarding his / her answer sheet .
we trained the faculty to focus the discussion on skill - based feedback and to limit the scope to the specific questions asked of the students on the worksheets .
students then discussed the harvard case as a team with the goal of delivering a written solution in 50 min .
as the last step in the exercise , the faculty member debriefed the team 's work , and the students then filled out the post - assessment questionnaire .
change in self - efficacy we computed " change in self - efficacy " as the difference between pre - and post - experiment self - efficacy .
while we used the same questions on the pre - and post - versions of the measure , they were phrased either in the present (" i am confident that i can ... today ") or future (" i am confident that i can ... in future situations ") .
students answered using a scale of 0 - 100 % certainty in the statement .
reliability for pre - experiment self - efficacy was high ( alpha = 0.86 ) , as was reliability for post - experiment self - efficacy ( alpha = 0.90 ) .
table 1 includes each measure , the scale , number of items , an example question , and reliability ( cronbach , 1951 ) .

0.81 5 rating of student performancea 1 - 5 ( poor to excellent ) rated in five skill areas :( 1 ) problem solving / critical thinking ( 2 ) interpersonal / team skills ( 3 ) change management skills ( 4 ) communication skills , and ( 5 ) leadership skills .
0.93 5 tolerance of ambiguity ( ta ) 1 - 7 ( strongly disagree to strongly agree ) i prefer familiar situations to new ones ( reversed ) .
0.83 6 athe same rating form was used for the faculty rating , self - rating , and peer rating .
performance faculty rated the students' performance in the overall assessment .
the assessment included performance ratings on a five - point scale ( 1 = " poor ," 5 = " excellent " ; of five management skill areas that were consistent with the learning goals set for graduates in this major : ( 1 ) problem solving / critical thinking ; ( 2 ) interpersonal / team skills ; ( 3 ) change management skills ; ( 4 ) communication skills ; and ( 5 ) leadership skills .
reliability was high ( 0.93 ) and justified averaging the five questions .
students used the same form to rate their own performance as well .
for 128 of the 324 total subjects , a trained graduate student independently rated student performance using the evaluation forms the faculty evaluators also used .
we used these 128 subject ratings to calculate inter - rater reliability with an intraclass correlation , or icc ( mcgraw and wong , 1996 ) , which is considered to be acceptable at 0.79 .
this icc helped validate the performance measure , despite there being a single evaluator .
tolerance of ambiguity in the post - assessment questionnaire , ta was measured using six items from budner 's ( 1962 ) measure , and a likert - type scale from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 7 ( strongly agree ) .
the scale displayed good reliability ( 0.83 ) and a one - factor solution using principle component ( pca ) analysis ( eigenvalue = 3.24 ; 53.93 % of variance ) .
opinion of assessment in the post - assessment questionnaire , students rated perceived value of the assessment to their careers in five questions on a likert - type scale ranging from 1 ( strongly disagree ) to 5 ( strongly agree ) .
the scale displayed good reliability ( 0.81 ) .
we gathered demographics as potential covariates ( gender , age , and years of work experience ) , number of group mebers , and numbered and coded teams .
none of these control variables was significantly related to the outcome measures .
results table 2 shows the correlations and descriptives of the main study variables .
the sample size varied due to participation that may have varied due to lateness or lost forms .
table 2 shows that the average ta in the sample was slightly above the scale mean , at 4.03 ( sd = 1.24 ) .
the average self - efficacy change was 4.05 % ( sd = 5.40 ) .
faculty ratings , self - ratings , and student post - assessment opinions were close to the maximum five rating and lack of variation may limit the ability to find group differences .
due to the categorical nature of the experimental manipulation variable , more statistical testing must be done to conclude group differences .

anova was used to test whether the experimental manipulation resulted in significantly different outcome measures ( see table 3 ) .
results show that ta differed significantly according to experimental group ( f = 3.96 , p < 0.02 ) .
subject ta in the structured behavioral past group ( mean = 3.05 , sd = 1.28 , n = 125 ) and structured future group ( mean = 3.07 , sd = 1.11 , n = 94 ) was significantly higher versus subject ta in the unstructured interview ( mean = 2.64 , sd = 1.26 , n = 96 ) .
scheffe 's post hoc test indicates that each of the three groups differed significantly from the other groups ( p < 0.05 ) .

self - efficacy change varied according to experimental group ( f = 4.11 , p < 0.02 ) , with unstructured interview participants reporting the lowest change in self - efficacy ( mean = 2.70 , sd = 5.68 , n = 90 ) .
subjects in the structured future condition reported a higher self - efficacy increase ( mean = 4.42 , sd = 4.79 , n = 95 ) , and those in the structured past condition reported the highest self - efficacy increase ( mean = 4.72 , sd = 5.49 , n = 127 ) .
a scheffe 's post hoc test revealed that the difference between the structured past condition and the unstructured condition was significant ( p < 0.02 ) .
faculty ratings varied at a marginal significance level according to experimental group ( f = 2.89 , p < 0.06 ) .
faculty ratings were lower for the structured future condition ( mean = 3.77 , sd = 0.82 , n = 92 ) vs. the unstructured condition ( mean = 3.96 , sd = 0.73 , n = 92 ) and structured past condition ( mean = 3.99 , sd = 0.63 , n = 128 ) .
scheffe 's post hoc test indicated that these latter conditions were marginally higher than the structured future condition ( p < 0.07 ) .
self - ratings did not vary according to experimental group ( f = 0.37 , p < 0.69 ) .
the overall subject self - ratings were above average ( mean = 4.17 , sd = 0.56 , n = 291 ) .
post - assessment opinions also did not differ according to experimental group ( f = 1.68 , p < 0.89 ) , with an overall above average rating ( mean = 4.45 , sd = 0.84 , n = 319 ) .
study 1 results suggest that varied situational ambiguity may result in varied ta , self - efficacy increases , and faculty ratings .
low and moderate ambiguity conditions experienced the most positive changes vs. the high ambiguity condition .
study 2 the purpose of the second study was to assess the ta of a sufficiently similar student sample , but without the influence of the assessment and its manipulations .
the students in this sample were also in the capstone management class , but completed the ta questionnaire without assessment participation .
therefore , these students did not perceive themselves to be a control group or interact with other students who had participated in the assessment ( n = 103 ) .
we expected that study 2 students would have lower ta because they had not participated in the assessment experience that could serve to strengthen tolerance levels .
sample the students completed the ta and self - efficacy questionnaires at approximately the same part of the semester as those in study 1 did , but during a segment focused on management self - development .
the study 2 and study 1 samples did not significantly differ in age ( t = - 0.13 , p < 0.90 ) , work experience ( t = 1.55 , p < 0.12 ) , or pre - assessment self - efficacy ( t = - 1.08 , p < 0.28 ) .
the percentage of male participants in study 1 was 55.7 % ( n = 180 ) , while the percentage of males in study 2 was 49.0 % ( n = 49 ) .
the percentages were not significantly different ( chi2 = 1.39 , p < 0.24 ) .
the students' major field of study also did not differ between study 1 and study 2 groups ( chi2 = 0.6 , p < 0.97 ) .
the majority of students were management majors in study 1 ( n = 213 , 68.7 %) and study 2 ( n = 68 , 69.4 %) .
a large portion were also management minors in both study 1 ( n = 56 , 18.1 %) and study 2 ( n = 18 , 18.4 %) .
remaining students majored in other business fields in both study 1 ( n = 41 , 13.2 %) and study 2 ( n = 12 , 12.2 %) .
methods and measures reliabilities were again acceptable for the same study 1 measures of self - efficacy ( only the pre - assessment measure from study 1 , 0.91 ) and ta ( 0.84 ) .
as in study 1 , pca resulted in a one - factor solution for ta ( eigenvalue = 3.05 , 60.97 % of variance ) .
results the study 2 sample ta differed significantly from the study 1 ta ( t = 3.02 , p < 0.001 ) .
study 1 participants' ta levels , with all experimental manipulations combined ( mean = 2.93 , sd = 1.24 , n = 315 ) , were significantly higher than study 2 participants' ta levels ( mean = 2.49 , sd = 1.37 , n = 98 ) .
self - efficacy did not significantly differ between the two groups ( t = - 1.08 , p < 0.28 ) , with similar mean values for study 1 ( mean = 82.31 , sd = 9.49 , n = 319 ) and study 2 ( mean = 83.51 , sd = 10.32 , n = 101 ) .
ta and self - efficacy were not correlated ( r = 0.11 , p < 0.26 ) .
in study 1 , self - efficacy change was also not correlated with ta , although both constructs appeared to be similarly affected by the experimental manipulations .
we also analyzed whether ta differed according to four groups consisting of the three study 1 experimental groups ( 1 - 3 ) and the study 2 control group ( 4 ) .
ta differed significantly across the four groups ( f = 5.56 , p < 0.001 ) .
according to scheffe 's post hoc test , the study 2 control group 's ta was significantly lower than the two structured interview conditions in study 1 , but not significantly lower than the unstructured interview condition in study 1 .
figure 1 shows the group differences .
figure 1 tolerance of ambiguity ( ta ) means compared across study 1 and study 2 groups .
study 2 sought to provide a matched sample for study 1 that would serve as a control group .
this study 2 group was similar on major demographics as well as being in the same course , having the same majors , and the same level of study as those in study 1 .
the study 2 students , however , were not introduced to the assessment participation and were completing a ta scale as a part of the coursework .
study 2 ta was significantly higher than the combined study 1 ta. those who participated in the assessment had an overall lower tolerance .
when comparing all groups in the two studies , however , the study 2 control group and study 1 unstructured interview ( highest ambiguity ) reported lowest ta levels .
as in study 1 , the structured interview manipulations ( both past and future styles of interview ) reported highest ta levels .
these findings suggest that ta may be malleable and can be increased by exposure to structure and more information in an ambiguous situation .
conclusion our goal was to use an experimental manipulation in order to contribute to the question of whether ta is a stable trait or a malleable one .
the experiment involved senior business students in a capstone class participating in a management skills assessment with a faculty group interview and case analysis .
the results here are preliminary , but suggest that ta may be malleable .
we conducted two studies , one in which ambiguity was manipulated using structured and unstructured interviews .
less ambiguity appears to have led to higher ta than high ambiguity in a situation of less structure and information .
a limitation of the first study was that there was no information about the pre - experiment ta due to fear of priming the subjects with pre - and post - measures so close together .
for additional information , we conducted a second study in which we surveyed a demographically similar group of subjects without the experimental manipulation .
these subjects reported ta at the levels of those in study 1 's high ambiguity ( unstructured interview ) group , which levels were significantly lower than those in the study 1 low and moderate ambiguity ta ( structured past and future interview ) .
we concluded , therefore , that individual ta may be increased in an ambiguous situation by imposing structure and providing more information .
subjects who were given more structure and information in the study 1 assessment also appeared to receive other benefits .
those in the low and moderate ambiguity conditions reported a significantly higher gain in self - efficacy to use management skills , and were also rated more positively by faculty , although at a marginal significance level .
subjects did not vary according to experimental condition in their opinions of the assessment or in their self - ratings , however .
the five - point likert scale for judging performance may have limited the range of self - and faculty ratings , or the view of one 's own performance simply may not be related to the situation 's ambiguity .
individuals may simply judge themselves as on an even ground with others in the assessment , and not relate this to their ability to deal with ambiguity .
faculty , however , did judge the students differently ( marginally ) , suggesting that either the lessened ambiguity in the structured conditions may have led to higher performance in the interview and case analysis , or the faculty may have been influenced by the experimental manipulation .
those in the structured interview groups may have been influenced by the specific , behavioral answers they received and that created a halo effect over the individual ratings as well .
our inter - rater reliability of faculty and graduate student ratings gives more validity to the single - rater performance measure .
implications future researchers could measure ta earlier rather than directly before a manipulation or a naturally occurring event and reduce the priming effect , but also improve knowledge about the pre - vs. post - ta levels .
there may have been aspects of personality or cognition that we did not measure and that influenced ta. future researchers could study various subject types .
our sample of bba senior students may limit the range of some findings , although the students did qualify as adults with work experience .
the lack of gender difference is different from what has been found in past studies , however , and this may be due to their fields of study .
future studies could investigate ta changes over time in the same subject group and include other related personality constructs .
this experience may have lasting impact on one 's tolerance in similar situations or create a mindset that is concrete in structured conditions , vs. more malleable in unstructured conditions , for example .
therefore , the short - term versus long - term properties of ta may be important and would be an interesting topic in future research studies .
if ta is malleable and can be increased in otherwise ambiguous situations , training could be designed for dealing with unexpected or unknown decisions at work .
individuals may be able to learn strategies for increasing situational ta that are highly specific to their situations .
they also may be able to sustain these increases over time while sharpening their abilities .
most certainly , familiarity with a task or environment would decrease ambiguity , but our findings suggest that a changing or unpredictable environment could result in lower self - efficacy , lower external evaluations , and lower tolerance .
in short , we sought to add knowledge to the question of whether ta is a malleable within the individual .
our results suggest ta may change within the person when faced with varied situations and we encourage further study .

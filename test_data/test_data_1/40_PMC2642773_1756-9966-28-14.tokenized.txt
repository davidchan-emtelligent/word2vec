background epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) has been shown to be associated with gastric cancer .
however , inconsistent findings have been reported regarding the distribution of ebv infected cells ( in normal gastric epithelium vs. intestinal metaplastic cells vs. in neoplastic cells ) and the characteristics of ebv - associated gastric cancer .
lymph node positive ebv - associated gastric cancer has not been systematically studied .
the aims of this study were to evaluate ebv - associated gastric cancer , to assess the distribution of ebv infected cells including all positive lymph nodes , and to define the characteristics of ebv - associated gastric cancer .
design the study included primary gastric cancer patients who underwent surgical resection with no preoperative treatment at m.d. anderson cancer center between 1987 and 2006 .
formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded tissue from these resection specimens were assessed for ebv by in situ hybridization , the gold standard for ebv detection in tissue .
ebv status was analyzed along with clinicopathologic parameters including age , gender , tumor type , lymph node status , and pathologic stage of the tumor .
results among 235 patients , 12 had intranuclear expression of ebv .
ebv staining was seen only in tumor cells and no detectable ebv was observed in normal gastric mucosa , intestinal metaplasia or stromal cells .
eight of 12 patients with ebv - associated gastric cancer had regional lymph node metastasis. of note , metastatic tumor cells in all of the involved lymph nodes of these 8 cases contained ebv .
the epidemiologic data showed 11 of the 12 patients with ebv - associated gastric cancer were men , ranging in age from 54 to 78 years ( mean age , 60 years ; median age , 62.1 years ) .
the age distribution for non - ebv associated gastric cancer patients ranged from 21 to 93 years ( mean age , 67 years ; median age , 66.4 years ) .
conclusion our study demonstrated that ebv is present exclusively in gastric cancer cells .
the detection of ebv in tumor cells in all of the lymph nodes involved with metastatic gastric carcinoma suggests simultaneous replication of ebv and tumor cells .
the predominantly male gender and relatively younger age observed for the ebv - infected gastric cancer cases suggest an association between this disease and other factors , such as life style .
background in 1990 , burke et al .
[ 1 ] used a polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) method to detect epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) in a small group of gastric carcinoma cells that resembled cells of morphologically undifferentiated nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma .
subsequently , shibata et al .
[ 2 ] , using in situ hybridization , demonstrated that ebv genomes were uniformly present in gastric carcinoma cells resembling lymphoepithelioma cells but were not present in reactive lymphoid infiltrate or normal mucosa .
in addition , shibata and weiss [ 3 ] reported that ebv involvement was detected not only in lymphoepithelioma - like gastric carcinoma but also in a subset of ordinary gastric carcinomas .
during the past decade , the role of ebv in gastric carcinogenesis has been recognized as new evidences have continued to emerge [ 4 - 6 ] .
ebv - associated gastric carcinoma ( ebvagc ) harbors distinct chromosomal aberrations and is characterized by a unique transcription pattern that resembles but is not identical to that of nasopharyngeal carcinomas [ 7,8 ] .
ebvagc , compared with ebv - negative gastric carcinoma , shows distinct clinical features [ 9 ] .
however , findings from studies in which various techniques were used to detect the presence of ebv in gastric cancer tissue have been highly controversial and conflicting .
some authors found ebv in only carcinoma cells [ 4,10 - 12 ] , whereas others found ebv in both precursor lesions ( e.g. , intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia ) and carcinoma cells [ 3,13 - 15 ] .
moreover , the status of ebv in the metastatic ebvagc lymph nodes has not been investigated .
to further examine the role of ebv in gastric carcinogenesis , we systematically and retrospectively studied a large cohort of patients with gastric cancer in a single comprehensive cancer center using ebv - encoded rna 1 ( eber1 ) in situ hybridization technique ( the gold standard for identifying ebv , shown to be superior to ebv dna in situ hybridization )[ 16 ] .
we also utilized immunohistochemistry to detect ebv - specific proteins , which are known to be expressed in some ebv - associated malignancies [ 16 ] .
materials and methods patient population for inclusion in this retrospective analysis , patients must have had a diagnosis of primary gastric carcinoma and undergone complete surgical resection of the tumor as initial treatment .
the study criteria also included adequate archival tissue for analysis and the availability of complete clinicopathologic data .
patients who had received preoperative treatment ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , or chemo - radiotherapy ) were excluded from the study .
a total of 249 consecutive patients who had been treated at the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center during the period of january 1 , 1987 through december 31 , 2006 met the study criteria .
the collected clinicopathologic data collected consisted of age , gender , date of initial diagnosis , tumor type , lymph node status , pathologic tumor stage , and date of death from gastric carcinoma or of last clinical follow - up. histologic diagnosis and grade of differentiation were determined in accordance with the world health organization criteria for gastric tumors [ 17 ] .
the m. d. anderson cancer center institutional review board approval was granted to investigate molecular markers relevant to gastric cancer pathogenesis in this study .
histologic examination and tissue microarray construction hematoxylin and eosin - stained slides of gastric carcinoma tissue were reviewed to confirm the histopathologic diagnoses and to assess the adequacy of specimens before being selected for molecular analyses .
we retrieved neutral buffered formalin - fixed ( 10 % formalin in water , v / v ; ph 7.4 ) and paraffin - embedded tissue blocks containing gastric carcinoma and nonneoplastic gastric tissue from the department of pathology at m. d. anderson cancer center .
one investigator ( d.f.t. ) identified and marked the areas containing viable tumor and normal tissue elements for the construction of tissue microarrays ( tmas ) .
high - density tmas were assembled using a tissue puncher - array system ( beecher instruments , silver spring , md ) , as we described previously [ 18 ] .
briefly , specimens retrieved from selected regions of archived donor tissue were precisely arrayed onto a new ( recipient ) paraffin block .
tissue cores were 1.0 mm in diameter and ranged in length from 1.0 to 3.0 mm , depending on the depth of tissue available in the donor block .
for all cases , three tissue cores were acquired from each normal and tumor donor block .
the three - core samples were subsequently inserted ( spaced 0.8 mm apart ) onto 45 - x 20 - x 12 - mm recipient blocks .
a total of four high - density tmas were used in this study .
in situ hybridization to determine the localization of ebv in all specimens , we performed in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin - labeled 30 mer - oligonucleotide probe ( eber kit , ventana medical systems , tucson , az ) ( 5 ' agacaccgtcctcacc acccgggacttgta3 ') complementary to small nuclear eber1 , as described previously [ 19,20 ] .
briefly , 4 - mum - thick sections were cut from paraffin - embedded tissues , mounted on slides coated with 3 - ( aminopropyl ) triethoxysilane ( sigma chemical company , st. louis , mo ) , baked at 60degreesc for 1 hour , and dewaxed .
all sections were treated with 0.2 n hcl for 20 minutes , followed with 20 mug / ml proteinase k solution ( boehringer mannheim , mannheim , germany ) .
next , the slides were dehydrated and prehybridized for 2 hours at 37degreesc with mixtures of 50 % deionized formamide , 0.18 mol / l nacl , 10 mmol / l nah2po4 , 1 mmol / l ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid , 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate , 100 mug / ml of denatured salmon sperm dna , 100 mug / ml of transfer rna , and 10 % dextran sulfate .
the slides were then hybridized overnight at 37degreesc with 0.5 ng of digoxigenin - labeled probe .
follwed the first wash of all sections with 0.5 x saline sodium citrate , hybridization was detected by antidigoxigenin antibody - alkaline phosphatase conjugate .
next , all sections were subjected to a second wash follwed by a visualizing reaction performed with nitroblue tetrazolium salt and 5 - bromo - 4 - chloro - 3 - indolyl phosphate solution in the dark for 6 to 12 hours .
the slides were counterstained with methyl green and mounted with aqueous medium .
specimens from a patient with known ebv - positive gastric carcinoma were used as positive control , and a sense probe to eber1 was used as negative control for each procedure .
immunohistochemical analysis to detect ebv - specific proteins , which are known to be expressed in ebv - associated epithelial malignancies [ 16 ] , we used monoclonal antibodies against latent membrane protein 1 ( lmp - 1 ) .
serial 5 - mum - thick tissue sections were cut from microarrays for immunohistochemical analysis .
these sections were processed within 1 week of cutting to avoid oxidation of antigens .
we stained the initial sections with hematoxylin and eosin to verify histologic type .
we also used antigen retrieval and avidin - biotin staining and visualized the antibody with an avidin - biotin - horseradish peroxidase complex and diaminobenzidine - hydrogen peroxide staining method , as described previously by investigators from our laboratory [ 21,22 ] .
briefly , the sectioned array tissue was processed using steam - heat retrieval for 30 minutes .
a mouse monoclonal antibody ( cs1 - 4 ; dako , carpinteria , ca ) against lmp - 1 was reacted with the array sections for 25 minutes at room temperature in an automatic immunostainer ( dako ) .
the array sections were then incubated in a detection kit in accordance with the manufacturer 's instructions .
slides from the immunohistochemical analysis were independently reviewed by two investigators , who recorded the staining as negative or positive .
all cells in all the cores were evaluated .
unequivocal nuclear staining in > 5 % of tumor cells was considered as positive response ; nuclear staining in < 5 % of tumor cells was considered as negative response .
statistical analysis the following variables were examined : age , gender , tumor type , lymph node status , pathologic stage , and ebv expression .
for all statistical tests , two categories were analyzed in pairs as positive versus negative and present versus absent .
we analyzed categorical variables using the fisher 's exact test , mcnemar test and the mann - whitney rank - sum test .
the follow - up time was calculated using the potential follow - up method .
overall patient survival was defined as the time between the date of surgical diagnosis to the date of last follow - up ( censored ) or the date of patient death ( event ) .
the end of follow - up date of this study was december 31 , 2006 .
censored cases included those cases ( n = 6 ) in which the last follow - up date occurred before december 31 , 2006 .
patients who deceased of causes other than gastric cancer were not included in the study .
we analyzed the differences in survival times between patient subgroups using the log - rank test .
survival probabilities were calculated ( using the kaplan - meier method ) and compared ( using the log - rank test ) [ 23 ] .
we performed cox proportional hazards regression analysis [ 24 ] using sas software ( sas institute , cary , nc ) to determine the association between the clinicopathologic variables and overall patient survival .
first , we analyzed the association between possible prognostic factors ( including age , gender , stage , and node classification ) and death , considering one factor at a time .
second , multivariate cox analysis was performed on backward ( stepwise ) procedures that always forced ebv into the model , along with all variables that satisfied an entry level of p < 0.05 .
as the model continued to add factors , independent factors did not exceed an exit level of p > 0.05 .
results clinicopathologic data clinicopathologic features of the study subjects are summarized in table 1 .
our study consisted of 88 female ( 37 %) , and 147 ( 63 %) male .
one hundred eighteen ( 50 %) patients were older than 65 years , while the other 117 ( 50 %) were 65 years or younger .
eighty - three tumors ( 35 %) were intestinal type , and 152 ( 65 %) were diffuse type .
one hundred thirty - one patients ( 56 %) had stage i - ii disease , and the remaining 104 patients ( 44 %) had stage iii or iv disease .
sixty patients ( 27 %) had nodal involvement and 165 ( 73 %) had no nodal metastases .

the yield after tissue processing was 94 % ( 235 of 249 ) .
among the 235 tumor cases , 72 also contained non - neoplastic gastric tissue ( 9 cases from ebv positive tumor cases and 63 from ebv negative cases ) .
eber1 was detected by in situ hybridization .
positive control samples revealed a distinctive diffuse nuclear stain .
sections incubated with preabsorbed or preimmune rabbit antisera showed no immunostaining .
overall , 12 of the 235 tumors ( 5.1 %) exhibited positive ebv expression ( figure 1 ) .
the intensity varied slightly from tumor to tumor but was consistent within the same tumor .
no relationship was found between the intensity of eber - 1 expression and any clinicopathological features .
ebv expression was noted in both diffuse ( including lymphepithelial carcinoma ) and intestinal type of gc ( table 1 ) .
expression of ebv was not noted in nonneoplastic gastric mucosal , intestinal metaplastic , or stromal cells ( endothelial cells and fibroblasts ) , or infiltrating inflammatory cells within the tumor sections .
twelve of 235 gastric tumor cases exhibited ebv expression , while none of the 72 samples containing non - neoplastic gastric epithelium displayed ebv expression .
the difference between ebv positivity in carcinoma tissues and corresponding non - neoplastic gastric tissues was statistically significant ( chi2 = 9.0407 ; p = 0.0028 ) .
in addition , one representative positive lymph node from each metastatic case was examined .
we observed that a fairly uniform expression of eber1 in metastatic tumor cells .
among the 12 ebvagc cases , eight patients displayed lymph node metastasis .
tumor cells in all eight positive lymph nodes revealed ebv expression ( figure 2 ) .
ten additional metastatic cases were randomly chosen and lymph nodes with tumor cells were examined for eber1 .
no tumor cells in the lymph nodes of the 10 additional cases displayed eber1 expression .

lmp - 1 protein expression in gastric tissue positive control , using known lmp - 1 - positive lymphoid tissue , revealed a distinctive membranous stain .
negative control sections were immunostained under the same conditions , with preabosorbed antisera substituted for the primary antibody , displaying no immunoreactivity .
among all 249 tested , 231 were assessable .
no expression of lmp - 1 was identified in any gastric cancer or in non - neoplastic gastric tissue .
to verify the foregoing tma results , we examined a subset of 40 whole tissue sections ( from 12 patients with ebvagc and 28 without ebv ) for the expression of ebv and lmp .
the findings were consistent with those from the tma cores .
ebv was detected only in the ebvagc sections ; no ebv was observed in nonneoplastic gastric tissue or in intestinal metaplasia .
association of ebv expression with clinicopathologic parameters age , gender , tumor type , nodal status , and pathologic tumor stage were the clinicopathologic parameters analyzed in our study .
after examining the associations between ebv expression and clinicopathologic variables ( table 2 ) , we found a statistically significant association between ebv expression and gender .
eleven of the 12 patients with ebvagc were male .
the difference in ebv positivity in carcinoma tissues between male and female patients was significant ( p < 0.05 ) .
patients with ebvagc were 54 - 78 years old ( mean age , 60 years ; median age , 62.1 years ) , whereas patients with gastric cancer not associated with ebv were 21 - 93 years old ( mean age , 67 years ; median age , 66.4 years ) .
subsequently , we analyzed the differences in survival times between patient subgroups using the log - rank test .
survival probabilities were calculated ( using the kaplan - meier method ) and compared ( using the log - rank test ) .
compared to those without ebv expression , patients with ebvagc displayed a favorable clinical outcome ( figure 3 ) .
however , by multivariate cox analysis , only lymph node status and tumor stage were significantly associated with ultimate patient prognosis ( table 3 ) .

in addition , ebv - positive gastric cancer cases make up the largest group of ebv - associated malignancies .
thus , defining the role of ebv in the carcinogenesis of this widespread malignancy is essential .
using in situ hybridization technique , we examined 235 cases of primary gastric cancers , which to our knowledge was the largest study group of this type in the united states .
specific nuclear eber1 transcripts were found only in gastric carcinoma cells .
in contrast , ebv was detected in none of the normal or dysplastic epithelia in the ebvagc or ebv - negative cases .
specifically , in 10 of the 12 cases of ebvagcs , eber1 was expressed in almost all carcinoma cells , suggesting that ebv infection occurs early in oncogenesis with a subsequent clonal expansion of ebv - containing tumor cells , significant findings which have also been reported by investigators using molecular genetic techniques [ 13,25 ] .
in two cases of ebvagc , eber1 was expressed in a small number of gastric carcinoma cells , visualized with focal eber1 staining , indicating that ebv infection occurs after neoplastic transformation has taken place .
the ebv nuclear expression was restricted to gastric carcinoma cells .
no expression was found in the presumed precursor lesions of gastric carcinoma .
our results agree with those of other studies in which eber transcripts were not detected in adjacent precursor lesions , such as intestinal metaplasia [ 4,26 - 28 ] .
however , some studies have described the presence of ebv in dysplasia [ 3,13 ] , and others have detected the presence of ebv in intestinal metaplasia [ 14,15 ] .
there are several reasons for these discrepancies .
first , dysplasia adjacent to carcinomas is difficult to distinguish from local carcinoma spread [ 17 ] .
secondly , variation in the techniques used and methods of interpretation can lead to inconsistent results .
for example , one study that used both polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization indicated that the ebv genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction in one case of normal gastric mucosa , but not by in situ hybridization [ 19 ] .
recently , one study examining ebv in gastric carcinomas and gastric stump carcinomas and found that eber1 / 2 transcripts were restricted to the carcinoma cells in both types of cases [ 12,29 ] .
the absence of eber1 transcripts in preneoplastic gastric lesions ( intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia ) but their presence in two distinct types of gastric carcinoma further supports the theory that ebv can infect only neoplastic gastric cells .
our study showed that lmp - 1 expression was not found in ebv - positive carcinomas or their precursor lesions , which is in line with previous observations [ 28,30 - 32 ] .
the absence of lmp - 1 expression in ebvagcs suggests that lmp - 1 may not be necessary for such tumors , at least not for sustaining their already established malignant state .
rather , lmp - 1 may participate in the earlier stage of tumor development and may be down - regulated thereafter .
alternatively , the lack of lmp - 1 may reflect the result of clonal selection of lmp - 1 - negative tumor cells by immunologic pressure because ebv - specific cytotoxic t cells are potentially directed against the viral lmps rather than against ebv nuclear antigen 1 .
yanai et al .
[ 15 ] reported that ebv - lmp - 1 was observed in cases of atrophic gastric mucosa .
however , this finding is not likely to be confirmed due to the inconsistent results from in situ hybridization and due to the fact that the researchers used a biotin method .
it has been demonstrated that cross - reactivity can occur and that the interpretation of positive immunohistochemical results should always be done in the context of transcript analysis by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [ 7,28 ] and eber1 in situ hybridization [ 4 ] .
in this population , a 5.1 % prevalence of ebv in gastric cancer was observed , comparable with the prevalence of ebv detected in gastric adenocarcinomas worldwide [ 4,25,33 ] and indicating that the overall prevalence of ebv in gastric carcinomas is independent of geographic regions [ 11,29 ] .
our observations of male predominance and younger patient age are in agreement with those of several previous studies [ 3,33,34 ] .
however , ours was the first large study of this type conducted in the united states .
our male - to - female ratio of 9.2 was among the highest described so far .
a male : female ratio of 9.8 was reported in one large cohort dutch study [ 4 ] .
in short , this study , evaluating the distribution of ebv infected cells in a large cohort of patients at a single comprehensive cancer center in u.s.a , confirms that ebv is restrictly expressed in tumor cells and predominately in younger male patients .
furthermore , positive ebv - infected tumor cells were observed in all lymph nodes with metastasis .
the detection of ebv in metastatic tumor cells in all of the lymph nodes involved with gastric carcinoma suggests simultaneous replication of ebv and tumor cells .
the predominantly male gender and relatively younger age observed in our study suggest an association between ebv - infected gastric cancer and other factors , such as life style .

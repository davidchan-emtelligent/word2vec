apart from being structural contractile cells , they also have immunomodulatory properties .
dynamic multifunctional behavior of asm cells , namely phenotype plasticity and functional diversity , is now - recognized to be directly involved with tissue inflammation that often interrelates with hypoxia in orchestrating airway remodeling and hyperresponsiveness characteristic of asthma .
objective herein , we sought to investigate the effect of the inflammatory mediator tnf - alpha and / or hypoxia on the expression of the asm cell contractile markers smmhc ( smooth muscle myosin heavy chain ) , mlck ( myosin light chain kinase ) , alpha2 alphactin and sm22 .
method primary in vitro differentiated human bronchial asm cell cultures were incubated for 24 hours in the presence or absence of tnf - alpha under normoxia or hypoxia .
total rna was extracted , reverse transcribed and mrna expression levels of smmhc , mlck , a2 alphactin and sm22 were determined by quantitative real - time pcr .
results tnf - alpha remarkably increased smmhc mrna expression under both normoxia and hypoxia .
treatment under hypoxia , with tnf - alpha , or their combination decreased mlck and sm22 mrna levels .
in contrast , alpha2 alphactin mrna levels were not significantly affected under any of these conditions .
conclusion tnf - alpha and hypoxia appear to alter the expression of human bronchial asm cell contractile protein genes , providing new insights on the complex role of asm cells in the pathophysiology of asthma .
remarkable up - regulation of smmhc mrna by tnf - alpha is indicative of the excessive asm hypertrophy in severe asthma .

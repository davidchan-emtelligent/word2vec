cryptochromes are flavoproteins that play a central role in the circadian oscillations of all living organisms except archaea .
cryptochromes are clustered into three subfamilies : plant - type cryptochromes , animal - type cryptochromes and cryptochrome - dash proteins .
these subfamilies are composed of photolyase / cryptochrome superfamily with 6 - 4 photolyase and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase .
cryptochromes have conserved domain architectures with two distinct domains , an n - terminal photolyase - related domain and a c - terminal domain .
although the molecular function and domain architecture of cryptochromes are conserved , their molecular mechanisms differ between plants and animals .
thus , cryptochromes are one of the best candidates for comparative and evolutionary studies .
here , we have developed a web - based platform for comparative and evolutionary studies of cryptochromes , dbcry ( http :// www.dbcryptochrome.org /) .
a pipeline built upon the consensus domain profile was applied to 1438 genomes and identified 1309 genes .
to support comparative and evolutionary genomics studies , the web interface provides diverse functions such as ( i ) browsing by species , ( ii ) protein domain analysis , ( iii ) multiple sequence alignment , ( iv ) homology search and ( v ) extended analysis opportunities through the implementation of ' favorite browser ' powered by the comparative fungal genomics platform 2.0 ( cfgp 2.0 ; http :// cfgp.snu.ac.kr /) .
dbcry would serve as a standardized and systematic solution for cryptochrome genomics studies .
database url : http :// www.dbcryptochrome.org / introduction light is one of the major sources of energy and provides a signal for all living organisms from single cells to multicellular organisms .
light perception and light - mediated signaling , which are important for growth and development as well as survival and adaptation , are achieved by a single or various combinations of photoreceptors .
among light responses , circadian rhythm is mediated by cryptochromes .
cryptochromes are flavoproteins that share a structural similarity to dna photolyases and act as blue - / ultraviolet a ( uv - a ) - light receptors ( 1 ) .
cryptochromes are widely distributed in bacteria and eukaryotes but are not found in archaea .
although initially characterized in plants ( 2 ) , cryptochromes have also been found in animals including fruit fly ( 3 ) , frog ( 4 ) , chicken ( 5 ) and human ( 6 - 8 ) .
cryptochromes can be clustered into three subfamilies based on their sequence similarities : plant - type cryptochromes , animal - type cryptochromes and cryptochrome - dash ( cry - dash ) proteins ( 9 ) , and these subfamilies are composed of photolyases / cryptochromes superfamily with 6 - 4 photolyase and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer ( cpd ) photolyase .
cryptochromes have two domains - - an n - terminal photolyase - related ( phr ) domain and a c - terminal domain of varying size for nuclear / cytosol trafficking and protein - protein interactions .
the c - terminal domain is less conserved than the phr domain , and the c - terminal domain of the plant - type cryptochromes is often longer than that of the animal - type cryptochromes .
cry - dash proteins lack the c - terminal domain .
animal - type cryptochromes are a component of the circadian clock , which controls daily physiological and behavioral rhythms .
plant - type cryptochromes , however , mediate various photomorphogenetic responses such as the inhibition of stem elongation , the stimulation of leaf expansion , the control of photoperiodic flowering and regulation of gene expression in addition to the entrainment of the circadian clock ( 10 , 11 ) .
although the molecular function of the central circadian oscillator is similar between animal - type and plant - type cryptochromes , the molecular mode of action between these two cryptochrome subfamilies are different .
in animals , the transcription of time genes is regulated by a physical interaction of promoter - binding transcription regulators with cryptochromes ; no such interaction has been found in plant - type cryptochromes .
a previous phylogenetic study has suggested that the ancestral cryptochromes may have evolved before the divergence of prokaryotes and eukaryotes ( 12 ) .
in addition , the presence of dqxvp - acidic - staes ( das ) sequences in cryptochromes suggests that the evolution of cryptochromes in plants occurred > 400 million years ago even before the wide spread of vascular plants ( 1 ) .
these evolutionary studies also suggest that the divergence of cryptochromes from photolyases occurred earlier than the divergence of monocots and eudicots , and that the evolution of cryptochromes may have occurred in a lineage - specific and an environment - dependent manner ( 13 ) .
thus , the molecular function and sequence similarities of cryptochromes are more diverse in each lineage compared with other photoreceptors such as phytochromes .
in plants , two approaches have been used to investigate the structure - function relationship of cryptochromes .
one approach has investigated the mutation of individual amino acids in the cryptochrome .
the other approach has observed the in planta behavior of a recombinant protein that contains a marker enzyme fused to a partial or full - length cryptochrome sequence .
these studies have indicated that no specific region of cryptochromes has accumulated mutations with a significantly high frequency , but these mutations have accumulated with a relatively higher frequency in the 160 - residue region of the c - terminal domain of phytochromes ( 9 , 14 ) .
although recent studies of cryptochromes have made considerable progress in the investigation of their molecular mechanisms and protein structures , there are still many intriguing open questions .
recently , genome sequences from various organisms have been extensively analyzed , and accumulated dna sequence information provides an opportunity to perform comparative studies on genes of interest .
however , a flood of information prevents researchers from accessing and analyzing all of the available data .
thus , the construction of a database of individual gene families has become a requirement for enhancing data accessibility .
in this article , we present dbcry , a cryptochrome database .
dbcry is designed to serve as a central platform for providing and collecting information about cryptochromes from a wide range of organisms .
dbcry also provides analysis tools for detailed cryptochrome research .
construction and evaluation of data analysis to identify putative genes that encode photolyases or cryptochromes , five subfamilies were defined based on previous research ( 9 , 15 ) , and protein domain profiling was performed ( table 1 ) .
to determine the domain profiles for each class , all protein sequences from uniprotkb / swissprot ( 16 ) that are annotated as dna photolyase , cryptochrome or cry - dash proteins were retrieved .
retrieved proteins were turned out to have three essential domains for cryptochromes , which include ipr005101 [ dna photolyase , flavin adenine dinucleotide ( fad ) - binding / cryptochrome , c - terminal ] , ipr006050 ( dna photolyase , n - terminal ) and ipr014729 ( rossmann - like alpha / beta / alpha sandwich fold ) .
to identify putative genes that encode cryptochromes , > 7.5 million protein sequences from 1438 genomes in bacteria , archaea , oomycetes , fungi , plants and animals were screened .
a total of 1309 protein sequences that had all three essential cryptochrome domains were identified. by identifying the presence and absence of additional domains , these 1309 protein sequences were further classified into five subfamilies : animal - type cryptochromes , cry - dash proteins , cpd photolyase class i , cpd photolyase class ii and plant - type cryptochromes ( figure 1 ) .

( a ) the pipeline for the identification of cryptochrome - encoding genes .
to construct the pipeline , expert - curated protein sequences annotated as cryptochrome or dna photolyase were collected from uniprotkb / swissprot and analyzed by interpro scan .
cryptochrome genes were identified from 1458 genomes belonging to 1406 species and classified into five subfamilies .
the identified 1309 genes were archived in the database .
( b ) the box plot represents a normalized number of cryptochrome / photolyase genes per genome .
a total of 106 protein sequences that are known to belong to photolyase / cryptochrome superfamily were collected from a literature survey to evaluate robustness of the identification pipeline ( 9 , 15 ) .
the sequences were subjected to be searched by interpro scan to obtain domain profiles .
as a result , 98.11 % of tested characterized sequences ( 104 of 106 ) were correctly classified by our domain profiles for each corresponding class , which demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our pipeline ( table 2 ) .
in particular , 23 cry - dash , 8 cpd photolyase class i and 17 cpd photolyase class ii genes were detected by the pipeline .
in addition , 94.12 and 97.00 % of genes encoding plant - type and animal - type cryptochrome proteins , respectively , were positively identified .
only two sequences in the test set showed prediction different from the reality .
the plant - type cryptochrome , q84l83 ( armoracia rusticana ) , was negatively predicted because it lacked the ipr002081 domain .
the amino acid alignment of this protein with the cry2 gene from arabidopsis thaliana , a closely related species of a. rusticana , indicated there might be an annotation error in the c - terminal of this protein .
the animal - type cryptochrome , q17dk5 ( aedes aegypti ) , was assigned to cpd photolyase class i for having additional domains ( ipr002081 and ipr018394 ) .

cpd i , cpd photolyase class i ; cpd ii , cpd photolyase class ii. high variability was observed in the length of full - length genes and core domains of plant - and animal - type cryptochromes .
in addition , plant - and animal - type cryptochromes had a c - terminal extension ( cce ) domain on their c - terminal end , and these domains showed a high variability in length .
furthermore , the domain architecture of animal - type cryptochromes was relatively simple compared with other subfamilies .
animal - type cryptochromes had only essential domains , whereas other subfamilies had additional domains ( table 1 ) .
so animal - type cryptochromes were characterized by subtracting genes of other subfamilies from 1309 candidate genes , and these features may interfere with the prediction of cryptochromes .
however , most of the plant - and animal - type cryptochromes were captured by our pipeline .
for example , the animal - type cryptochrome , treu927 ( trypanosoma brucei ) , was captured even though the ipr005101 domain ( dna photolyase , fad - binding / cryptochrome , c - terminal ) was split into three subdomains because of nonconservative sequences insertions in the domain .
in addition , five genes that encode the photolyase / cryptochrome family were captured and assigned accurately into four corresponding families , as reported in a previous study ( 17 ) .
thus , our pipeline is able to accurately identify photolyase / cryptochrome families .
furthermore , our pipeline can detect fungal cryptochromes as well as plant - and animal - type cryptochromes , which demonstrates the comprehensive coverage of our method .
for example , a dash - type cryptochrome in the model fungus neurospora crassa ( 18 ) was identified and classified into the cry - dash subfamily .
in addition , phr1 in trichoderma atroviridae , which belongs to cpd photolyase class i ( 19 ) , was also correctly identified in dbcry .
in total , 818 genomes have at least one of the putative genes from the photolyase / cryptochrome family , including genomes from 15 archaea , 561 bacteria , 150 fungi , 33 animals and 30 plants ( figure 2 ) .
genes that belongs to cpd photolyase class i were the most frequently found ; 621 genes were found in 590 genomes .
among these 590 genomes , 449 and 121 genomes belonged to bacteria and fungi , respectively , which indicates that the genomes of archaea , plants and animals rarely possess this type of blue - light regulator .
the 74 plant - type cryptochromes were found only in the species belonging to the kingdom plantae , with an exception in the subphylum prasinophyceae .
the number of genes encoding plant - type cryptochromes ranged from one to nine because of the varying number of alternatively spliced isoforms .
in oryza sativa , for example , six isoform products were captured among nine predicted plant - type cryptochromes .
the genes encoding cry - dash proteins were distributed across a wide range of taxonomy , which is in accordance with previous research ( 20 , 21 ) .
unlike other classes , a low level of variance was observed in the number of cry - dash genes , which suggests that these genes do not have many alternative splicing isoforms .
the genes encoding cpd photolyase class ii were also found in a broad spectrum of taxa including bacteria , archaea , fungi , animals and plants but found in only 121 genomes .
the genes encoding animal - type cryptochromes were also found in a broad spectrum of the taxa .
in addition , high variance was detected in the phylum ' craniata ' , ranging from 1 to 17 , as shown in the high variance in plant - type cryptochromes ( figure 2 ) .
figure 2 .

the distribution of the 1306 identified cryptochromes is shown in the accumulated chart .
the average number of genes in each of the five subfamilies ( pc , plant - type cryptochrome ; cd , cry - dash ; pi , cpd photolyase class i ; pii , cpd photolyase class ii ; ac , animal - type cryptochromes including 6 - 4 photolyase ) is shown for each taxonomy .
utility of dbcry web interfaces and functionalities to provide intuitive browsing of the identified genes , web pages for visualizing charts and taxonomic distributions were developed .
the distribution of different classes in each species and the distribution of different species for a given class can be visualized via the web user interface .
the taxonomic summary tables provide kingdom - and subphylum - wide distributions of the putative genes of the photolyase / cryptochrome family to offer a glimpse of the geographical landscape of those genes .
in addition , the full list that describes the number of genes in each class from each of genome can be downloaded as a.sv file .
a user can also browse the data by the five cryptochrome / photolyase subfamilies .
in the ' browse by class' menu , the taxonomic distribution of the number of genes is provided as a box plot , which provides a quick overview of each class along with the wide range of taxonomy .
cross - linking favorite , a personalized virtual folder and data analysis hub dbcry provides various functions via favorite , a personalized data repository and analysis hub featured by the comparative fungal genomics platform ( cfgp 2.0 , http :// cfgp.snu.ac.kr /) ( 22 ) .
dbcry provides ( i ) class distribution , ( ii ) protein domain browser , ( iii ) domain sequence retrieval , ( iv ) homology search tools ( blast and blastmatrix ) and ( v ) a multiple sequence alignment tool ( clustalw ; figure 3 ) .
in particular , the domain sequence retrieval and multiple sequence alignment tools facilitate the search for conserved residues in the specific domains of selected cryptochromes .
the favorites created in dbcry can be used in cfgp 2.0 , which offers flexible and extended analysis options for further analysis .
in addition , the favorites are also interconnected with a number of gene family databases to offer multigene family analysis opportunities .

system structure dbcry was developed by taking the advantage of a three - tiered system , divided into the database , identification pipeline and web interfaces .
genome and proteome data subjected to domain profiling were retrieved from the standardized genome warehouse of cfgp 2.0 ( 22 ) .
in addition to the interpro domain information , additional results generated by seven bioinformatics programs were imported from cfgp 2.0 to provide broader information for each identified gene .
the web interface for dbcry was based on the data - driven user interface of cfgp 2.0 to provide user - friendly environment .
mysql 5.0.81 ( source code distribution ) and php 5.2.6 were used for administrating database and developing web interfaces , respectively .
web pages were served through apache 2.2.9 web server .
discussion evolution of cryptochromes cryptochromes play a crucial role in the regulation of circadian rhythms .
cryptochromes have been identified in bacteria , animals and plants .
cryptochromes are related to dna photolyases , which play a role in dna repair .
although cryptochromes are structurally similar to dna photolyase , they do not exhibit photolyase activity .
initially , bacterial dna photolyase was speculated as the common ancestor of cryptochromes ( 10 ) , but bacterial cryptochromes have not been characterized for decades .
the discovery of cryptochromes in bacterial genome such as cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. and vibrio cholera and the discovery of cry - dash proteins from bacteria , plants , insects and vertebrates indicated that cryptochromes evolved before the origin of eukaryotic organisms ( 20 , 23 , 24 ) .
furthermore , an early phylogenetic tree analysis suggested that animal - and plant - type cryptochromes diverged during two independent evolutionary events soon after the divergence of plants and animals ( 10 ) .
thus , the discovery of bacterial cryptochromes and cry - dash proteins provides a new chance to investigate the evolutionary history and functional study of cryptochromes .
in this study , 1309 cryptochromes - encoding genes were identified , and 248 cryptochromes from 72 genomes were selected and analyzed to investigate the evolution of cryptochromes .
the phylogenetic tree of representative cryptochromes indicates that each cryptochrome subfamily forms a distinctive cluster ( figure 4 ) .
however , some animal - type cryptochromes from fungi and bacteria were detected in the cpd photolyase class i subfamily .
previous studies on the fusion proteins of 6 - 4 dna photolyase suggest that evolutionary changes in the protein functionally separated the cryptochromes , but the core domain of photolyases were not significantly altered ( 25 , 26 ) .
this mixed clade indicates that animal - type cryptochromes , including the 6 - 4 photolyases of fungi , bacteria and algae , have a higher sequence similarity to cpd photolyase class i compared with higher plants or vertebrates .
furthermore , the amino acid sequences between 6 - 4 dna photolyase in plant - and animal - type cryptochromes showed high similarity , hampering clear distinction among them by domain profiles .
the phylogenetic tree analysis showed that 6 - 4 dna photolyase formed subclade in animal - type cryptochromes ( supplementary figure s1 ) .
thus , 6 - 4 dna photolyase were included in animal - type cryptochrome in this study .
figure 4 .
a phylogenetic tree of representative cryptochromes .
the evolutionary relationships of 248 representative cryptochromes from 72 genomes were investigated .
the evolutionary history was inferred using the minimum evolution method .
the optimal tree with a sum of branch length = 49.91770009 is shown .
animal - type ( circle ) , cpd photolyase class i ( left handed triangle ) , cpd photolyase ii ( right handed triangle ) , cry - dash ( diamonds ) and plant - type ( rectangular ) cryptochromes formed distinct clusters .
different colors were used for indicating different taxa ; violet ( vertebrate ) , bright blue ( insect ) , blue ( bacteria ) , green ( green algae ) , brown ( moss ) , pink ( fungi ) , red ( monocot ) and orange ( eudicot ) .
in contrast to photolyases , cryptochromes have a cce region but poorly conserved structure ( 15 ) .
however , cce domains of plants are more conserved compared with those of animals and also contain a das domain .
the interpro domain and phylogenetic analysis indicated that proteins containing the cce domain were first detected in moss ( physcomitrella patens ) and were not detected in green algae .
these results agree with the previous research ( 1 ) .
in this study , 10 green algae genomes were investigated , but none included cryptochromes with the das domain .
overall , this result implies that the cce domain may have emerged after the appearance of multicellular organisms and land plants .
in contrast to green algae or aquatic plants , land plants evolved to adapt to various environmental conditions , including exposure to a broad spectrum of light .
as a result , cryptochrome containing the cce domain emerged to mediate various light responses .
genetic studies indicate that the das domain is important for intermolecular interaction , cellular localization and physiological function ( 27 ) .
the detection of das - containing cce domains in moss suggests that land plants required the domain to mediate more complex responses to adapt to various light conditions .
more specifically , cce domains may have evolved to mediate new blue - light signaling pathways by interacting with their partners .
however , cryptochromes containing the cce domain were not observed in another moss species ( selaginella martensii ) .
the origin , emergence and succession of das - containing cce domains therefore remain to be elucidated .
the identification of the evolution and origin of cce domains will provide an important clue for evolutionary studies of cryptochromes .
in addition , the phylogenetic tree showed that cryptochrome 1 and 2 formed a distinct subclade ( figure 4 ) .
to investigate the divergence time of cryptochrome 1 and 2 in plant , phylogenetic analysis were performed using 144 plant - type cryptochromes including cryptochromes of amborella trichopoda .
the phylogenetic tree showed that cryptochrome 1 and 2 were subdivided before the divergence of monocots and eudicots .
these two cryptochromes therefore evolved in a lineage - specific manner ( supplementary figure s2 ) .
in conclusion , these data suggest that the evolution of cryptochromes resulted from an adaptation to various light conditions as land plants were exposed to more complex and various environments .
application of dbcry cryptochromes are structurally related to dna photolyases but do not possess dna repair activity .
the crystal structure of plant and bacterial cryptochromes reveals the structural differences between cryptochromes and photolyases ( 20 , 28 ) , and functionally essential amino acids that cause catalytic differences between these proteins have been identified .
although cryptochromes are structurally different from photolyases , the mode of action of cryptochromes has been revealed by comparative analysis between cryptochromes and photolyases .
for example , a comparative analysis of photolyases and cryptochromes has identified the essential amino acids for a light - activated electron transfer reaction ( 13 ) .
thus , a comparative analysis between plant - and animal - type cryptochromes may unveil the function of cryptochromes and their evolution .
in comparative studies , site - directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acids , deletion of specific domains or domain - swapping experiments based on the sequence comparison among cryptochromes are commonly used .
the comparison of large numbers of cryptochrome sequences from various genomes may allow bench scientists to discover important amino acids or domains in cryptochromes .
however , the large volume and disorganization of genome information is often a barrier to these comparisons .
it is difficult to identify individual gene families from a wide range of genomes because of complicated structures or divergent domain architectures .
in addition , special skills are required to handle the information derived from sequence alignments or the parsing of specific domain sequences .
dbcry can provide accurate and various sequence information and tools for analyzing cryptochromes. by using this database , researchers can perform sequence similarity search ( blast ) with putative cryptochrome sequences to evaluate and determine conserved amino acids by the alignment of specific domains or full - length sequences using clustalw ( figure 3 ) .
the embedded phylogenetic analysis tool in dbcry allows users to analyze either domain sequences of interest or full - length cryptochromes .
in addition , dbcry provides taxonomy information for each cryptochrome , and the user can remove or add cryptochrome sequences to their favorites .
therefore , dbcry enables bench scientists to collect functionally related proteins or cryptochromes of specific taxonomy for comparative analysis .
in conclusion , the genome - wide identification and analyses of cryptochromes , such as the discovery of cry - dash or the characterization of bacterial cryptochromes , have unveiled the evolution of cryptochromes as well as their biological function. with accumulation of additional information , further genome - wide studies will be able to uncover the old branch or the origin of cryptochromes .
future directions we believe that dbcry is the most comprehensive database for genes encoding blue - light photoreceptors .
this database has been developed to support bench scientists who study the mechanisms and biochemical properties of cryptochromes .
the extensive taxonomy that is archived in dbcry will assist researchers in many ways , including the collection of candidate cryptochrome targets , the determination of conserved residues for mutagenesis and comparative and evolutionary studies among genes that encode cryptochrome .
to keep up with the up - to - date and broader range of genome information , the dbcry will be updated on the regular basis when new or updated genomes in major repositories , such as ncbi and ensembl , become available .
we will continue our efforts to provide additional useful tools to make the dbcry a better research portal for cryptochrome genomics .

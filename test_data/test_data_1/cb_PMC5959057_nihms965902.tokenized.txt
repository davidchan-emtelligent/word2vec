sepin - 1 , a potent non - competitive inhibitor of separase , inhibits cancer cell growth , but the mechanisms of sepin - 1 - mediated growth inhibition are not fully understood .
here we report that sepin - 1 hinders growth of breast cancer cells , cell migration , and wound healing .
inhibition of cell growth induced by sepin - 1 in vitro does n't appear to be through apoptosis but rather due to growth inhibition .
following sepin - 1 treatment caspases 3 and 7 are not activated and poly ( adp - ribose ) polymerase ( parp ) is not cleaved .
the expression of forkhead box protein m1 ( foxm1 ) , a transcription factor , and its target genes in the cell cycle , including plk1 , cdk1 , aurora a , and lamin b1 , are reduced in a sepin - 1 - dependent manner .
expressions of raf kinase family members a - raf , b - raf , and c - raf also are inhibited following treatment with sepin - 1 .
raf is an intermediator in the raf - mek - erk signaling pathway that phosphorylates foxm1 .
activated foxm1 can promote its own transcription via a positive feedback loop .
sepin - 1 - induced downregulation of raf and foxm1 may inhibit expression of cell cycle - driving genes , resulting in inhibition of cell growth .
separase sepin - 1 raf foxm1 cell proliferation breast cancer introduction separase is a sister chromatid cohesion - resolving enzyme that cleaves cohesin subunit rad21 , resulting in the segregation of sister chromatids during cell cycle [ 1 ] .
besides its canonical role , separase is required for centrosome duplication [ 2 - 6 ] , dna damage repair [ 7,8 ] and membrane trafficking [ 9 - 11 ] .
because of its involvement in numerous important cell processes , separase is tightly regulated in normal cells [ 12 - 16 ] .
however , separase has been found to be an oncogene and overexpressed in many human cancers , including breast , bone , brain , and prostate tumors [ 17 - 21 ] .
overexpression of separase promotes aneuploidy , genomic instability , and tumorigenesis in mouse models [ 19,20 ] .
in order to modulate the activity of separase in cancer cells , we have performed a high throughput screen and identified a small molecular inhibitor called sepin - 1 [ 22 ] .
sepin - 1 non - competitively inhibits separase activity and prevents the growth of leukemia , neuroblastoma , and breast cancer cells in vitro , as well as breast - cancer tumors in vivo in a separase - dependent manner [ 22 ] .
however , the mechanisms behind the oncostatic action of sepin - 1 have not been elucidated .
herein we report that sepin - 1 inhibits breast - cancer cell growth , migration , and wound healing in a dose - dependent manner .
the inhibition is not through apoptosis but likely through the inhibition of foxm1 , an important cell cycle transcription factor , and its target gene expression .

drugs sepin - 1 was synthesized by chembridge ( san diego , ca ) ; etoposide was from sigma - aldrich ( st. louis , mo ) .
tissue culture bt - 474 , mcf7 , mda - mb - 231 , and mda - mb - 468 were obtained from american type culture collection ( atcc ) ( manassas , va ) .
the cells were cultured according to the protocols of atcc .
qpcr one million cells were seeded to a 10cm plate overnight and treated with different concentrations of sepin - 1 for 24 h. total rna was extracted using rneasy plus mini kit ( qiagen , inc , valencia , ca ) .
cdna was synthesized using rt2 first strand kit ( qiagen ) , and qpcr was performed using rt2 sybr green rox qpcr mastermix ( qiagen ) in eppendorf mastercycler realplex4 .
cell - migration assay cell migration following treatment with sepin - 1 was assayed using the protocol reported previously with certain modifications [ 23 ] .
briefly , cells were detached and suspended in serum - free cell culture media with 1x105 cells / ml. one hundred mul of the cell solution was plated on the top of the filter membrane in a 24 - well transwell ( r ) insert ( corning ) and incubated for 10 minutes at 37degreesc to allow the cells to settle down .
six hundred mul of medium with or without sepin - 1 was added to the bottom of the lower chamber in a 24 - well plate .
the cells were incubated at 37degreesc for 24 h. to examine the cells that migrated to the other side of the membrane , the cells that did not migrate were first removed using cotton - tipped applicators .
the cells on the opposite side of the membrane on the transwell ( r ) insert were fixed with 4 % glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.2 % crystal violet .
the migrated cells were counted with an inverted microscope ( axio vert. a1 , zeiss ) .
five random fields of each membrane were examined .
the number of cells in those fields were averaged and represented as the cells that migrated .
the assay was performed in triplicate .
wound healing assay the wound healing assay was performed according to the protocol reported previously [ 23 ] .
briefly , 2 x 105 cells per well were seeded to a 12 - well plate .
after 24h incubation at 37degreesc , a straight line of wound was made by using a 200 mul pipette tip in each well .
the medium was carefully aspirated to remove the cell debris and replaced with medium containing with or without sepin - 1 .
to check for wound closure , images were taken at 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h after the wound was made .
the distance of the wound gap was measured using a scale bar .
tunel assay cells were seeded to 6 - well plates and treated with sepin - 1 for 24 h. the cells were detached and cytospun to slides .
the cells were then fixed , permeablized , and labeled by following the protocol using deadend ( tm ) fluorometric tunel system ( promega , madison , wi ) .
the slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope .
reverse phase protein array ( rppa ) cells were treated with sepin - 1 for 24 h , and whole cell lysate was prepared as reported previously [ 24 ] .
rppa was performed by rppa core facility at md anderson cancer center , houston , tx. immunoblotting protein preparation and western blot were performed as reported previously [ 24,25 ] .
cell viability assay cells were seeded to 96 - well plates in 100 mul medium per well and incubated at 37degreesc for 24 h. on the second day , 50 mul of sepin - 1 or medium was added to each well .
on the fifth day , 20 mul of celltiter - blue ( r ) reagent ( promega ) was added to each well .
after 6h incubation , the fluorescence intensity ( fi ) was determined using a microplate reader at excitation 560nm and emission 590nm .
the wells without cells served as background , and the wells without sepin - 1 treatment served as the positive control .
cell viability (%)= 100 x (( fisepin - 1 - fibackground )/( fipositive - fibackground ) .
each treatment was performed in triplicate and repeated with 3 independent experiments .
results sepin - 1 inhibits growth of breast cancer cells four breast cancer cell lines , bt - 474 , mcf7 , mda - mb - 231 , and mda - mb - 468 , with distinct hormone - receptor status and subtypes ( table 1 ) were used for these studies .
sepin - 1 inhibited the cell growth of all four cell lines ( figure 1a ) .
bt - 474 and mcf7 ( ec50 =~ 18 mum ) were more sensitive than triple - negative cell lines mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 ( ec50 =~ 28 mum ) ( figure 1b ) .
immunoblotting results showed that separase level was reduced when cells were treated with sepin - 1 ( figure 1c ) , and the reduction of separase was more significant in bt - 474 and mcf7 cells than that in the two triple negative cell lines ( figure 1c ) .
sepin - 1 inhibits cell migration and wound healing metastasis occurs more frequently in basal breast carcinoma than in luminal breast cancers .
cell migration assay commonly is used to determine the potential capability for metastasis in vitro .
we tested the efficacy of sepin - 1 in inhibiting cell migration using both the luminal and basal cell lines .
we did not find any migration of cells for the two luminal breast cancer cell lines , bt - 474 and mcf7 , whereas the two basal breast cancer cell lines , mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 , could easily migrate through the membrane of the transwell ( r ) ( figure 2a ) .
the migration was significantly inhibited by sepin - 1 ( figure 2b ) .
as an additional test , we confirmed the inhibitory effect of sepin - 1 on cell migration using a wound healing assay .
sepin - 1 significantly reduced wound healing of mda - mb - 468 cells ( figures 3a and 3b ) .
the closure of the wounds' gaps in control groups occurred significantly faster than that of the sepin - 1 - treated groups , which could be seen as early as 24 h after treatment with sepin - 1 .
there was no significant difference between 20 mum and 40 mum sepin - 1 - treated groups ( figure 3b ) .
sepin - 1 causes dna damage in bt - 474 and mcf7 cell lines to investigate whether or not sepin - 1 treatment can cause dna fragmentation , we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( tdt ) dutp nick - end labeling ( tunel ) assay .
according to our results , approximately 40 % of both bt - 474 and mcf7 cells treated with 40mum sepin - 1 were tunel - positive .
this percentage was significantly higher than that in control cells or cells with 20mum sepin - 1 treatment , which was less than 10 % ( figures 4a - 4c ) .
surprisingly , we seldom found tunel - positive staining in mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 cells treated with 40mum sepin - 1 ( figures 4e and 4f ) .
we have excluded the possible technical issues by performing the experiments side - by - side .
we speculate that luminal and basal breast cancer cells likely have different responses to sepin - 1 treatment .
cell growth inhibition following sepin - 1 treatment is not through apoptosis one of the mechanisms that lead to cell death is apoptosis .
many proteins are involved in apoptotic signaling cascade .
results from reverse phase protein array ( rppa ) assay indicated that pro - apoptotic regulators bak , bax , and bid increased in a sepin - 1 concentration - dependent manner ( figure 5a ) , suggesting that an apoptotic signaling cascade was initiated .
we expected that effector enzymes caspases 3 and 7 would be activated with the generation of the 17 kd and 19 kd fragments , respectively , and parp would be cleaved with the generation of the 85kd fragment after cells were treated with sepin - 1 .
to our surprise , in sepin - 1 - treated samples , we did not find the cleaved fragments of activated caspases 3 and 7 or cleaved 85 kd parp ( figure 5b ) .
etoposide can induce apoptosis and was used as the positive control .
immunoblotting results indicated that treatment with etoposide caused cleavage of parp , resulting in the generation of an 85 kd fragment in bt - 474 , mda - mb - 231 , and mda - mb - 468 cells ( figure 5b ) .
in those three cell lines , the proenzymes of caspase 3 were also activated with the generation of cleaved fragments ( 17 kd ) , whereas caspase 7 was activated ( 19 kd ) only in mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 but not in bt - 474 or mcf7 ( figure 5b ) .
no caspase 3 bands were found on mcf7 blot because mcf7 is known to be caspase 3 deficient .
apoptotic parp cleavage ( 85 kd fragment ) was not found in mcf7 ( figure 5b ) , which is possibly due to lack of activated caspases 3 and 7 .
rppa data showed that parp protein levels were reduced in cells treated ( figure 5a ) , which was confirmed in immunoblotting ( figure 5b ) .
the reduction of parp possibly is not caused by apoptosis because the 85 kd fragment of parp was not found , and caspases 3 and 7 were not activated ( figure 5b ) .
however , we noted a faint band at approximately 70kd ( figure 5b arrow ) , possibly a degraded fragment of parp that was resulted from the treatment with sepin - 1 .
sepin - 1 inhibits expression of raf and foxm1 because sepin - 1 inhibits cell growth not via apoptosis , we hypothesized that the inhibition is possibly through its effect on cell proliferation .
we performed a reverse phase protein array ( rppa ) assay and found that expression of foxm1 was significantly reduced following treatment with sepin - 1 ( figure 6a ) .
qpcr analysis further indicated that mrna of foxm1 was reduced ( figure 6b ) , and immunoblotting data confirmed the rppa results showing that levels of foxm1 protein were decreased in cells treated with sepin - 1 ( figure 6c ) .
foxm1 is a transcription factor , and raf - mek - erk signaling cascade plays an important role in its activation .
rppa and qpcr results showed that a - raf expression was inhibited following treatment with sepin - 1 ( figures 6d and 6e ) .
western blot data also confirmed that expressions of a - raf , b - raf , and c - raf were inhibited by sepin - 1 ( figure 6f ) .
sepin - 1 inhibits the expression of proliferation - promoting proteins many foxm1 - targeting proteins control cell cycle progression and proliferation .
plk1 , cdk1 , aurora a , pericentrin , and lamin b1 are among those proteins .
rppa data and western blot showed that sepin - 1 reduced plk1 and cdk1 protein levels ( figures 7a - 7c ) .
pericentrin , aurora , and lamin b1 were also inhibited by sepin - 1 ( figure 7c ) .
discussion separase is overexpressed in many cancers , including breast cancer tumors [ 1,17,18,20,22,26,27 ] .
sepin - 1 is a separase inhibitor and inhibits growth of cancer cells [ 22 ] .
although sepin - 1 can induce apoptosis in molt4 cells [ 22 ] , it is unclear how sepin - 1 inhibits cell growth in breast cancer cells .
among the breast cancer cell lines that we used in this study , bt - 474 and mcf7 are classified to luminal b and luminal a subtype breast cancer , respectively .
mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 are basal - like breast cancer cells .
although the cell growth of all four cell lines was inhibited by sepin - 1 , their responses to sepin - 1 were different in some degree .
luminal breast cancer cell lines bt - 474 and mcf7 were more sensitive to sepin - 1 than were the basal breast cancer cell lines mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 ( ec50 =~ 18 vs ~ 28 mum ) .
dna damage was obvious in luminal breast cancer cell lines treated with sepin - 1 but not in basal - like breast cancer cell lines .
metastasis is defined as cancer cells that migrate to a location different from the origin .
it is well - known that mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 cell lines are metastatic .
sepin - 1 could inhibit migration and wound healing in mda - mb - 231 and mda - mb - 468 .
the effects of treatment with sepin - 1 that are similar on the four breast cancer cell lines include non - activation of caspases 3 and 7 and downregulation of cell cycle - driving proteins , such as raf , foxm1 , plk1 , cdk1 , aurora a , lamin b1 , and pericentrin .
sepin - 1 inhibits growth of breast cancer cells , but we do not know how .
growth of a tumor is determined by cell proliferation and cell death .
inhibition of cell proliferation and / or promotion of cell death is necessary to inhibit a tumor 's growth .
many factors lead to cell death [ 28,29 ] .
we explored the possibility of apoptosis induced by sepin - 1 .
activation of effector caspases 3 and 7 and parp cleavage are the hallmarks of apoptosis .
rppa assay indicated that pro - apoptotic regulators bak , bax , and bid increased in a sepin - 1 , concentration - dependent manner , suggesting that an apoptotic signaling cascade was initiated .
however , contrasting to the apoptotic positive control of cells treated with etoposide , neither caspase 3 nor caspase 7 was activated , nor was parp cleaved in sepin - 1 - treated cells , suggesting that treatment with sepin - 1 hinders execution of apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines .
cell proliferation requires expression of cell cycle driving factors , such as foxm1 , plk1 , cyclin b1 , cdk1 , lamin b1 , and pericentrin .
all are target genes regulated by foxm1 transcription factor [ 30 ] , and their expressions are inhibited by sepin - 1 .
an interesting note is that a strong positive correlation exists between espl1 ( gene that encodes separase protein ) and foxm1 transcripts across various human tumor tissues , suggesting a relationship between foxm1 and separase expression in human cancer .
forkhead box ( fox ) proteins are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that consist of a superfamily with 49 members that are classified into 19 subfamilies [ 31 ] .
foxm1 is one of the subfamilies and has four isoforms , foxm1a , foxm1b , foxm1c , and foxm1d [ 32,33 ] .
foxm1 regulates cell cycle progression , proliferation , migration , metabolism , dna damage response , angiogenesis , metastasis , and tumor development and progression [ 34 ] .
the activity of foxm1 can be affected in several ways .
first , the expression of foxm1 is self - regulated because it possesses a positive feedback loop and activates its own transcription [ 35,36 ] .
next , the degradation of foxm1 can be regulated through proteasome .
thiazole antibiotics thiostrepton and siomycin a inhibit foxm1 expression and its transcriptional activity [ 37 - 39 ] .
it has been proposed that thiostrepton , siomycin a , and other proteasome inhibitors hinder degradation of a negative regulator of foxm1 , which in turn reduces the activity of foxm1 [ 36,40 - 42 ] .
furthermore , the activity of foxm1 is regulated by post - translation modifications .
phosphorylation by the ras - raf - mek - erk cascade leads to foxm1 nuclear translocation .
once inside the nucleus , foxm1 is activated through phosphorylation by cdk1 / cyclin b1 and plk1 to promote transcription of cdk1 , cyclin b1 , plk1 in a positive feedback loop that produces a burst of cdk1 and plk1 activity to drive the cells into mitosis [ 43,44 ] .
inhibition of cell growth by sepin - 1 could be achieved through attenuating this positive feedback loop .
the raf kinase family has three members , a - raf , b - raf , and c - raf / raf - 1 .
the well - known role of rafs is in ras pathway signaling , in which they function as a direct effector of the ras gtpases and as the initiating kinase in the mek - erk cascade [ 45 ] .
raf contains a ras - binding domain ( rbd ) in the n - terminal regulatory region , which interacts to active gtp - bound ras [ 46 ] .
this interaction disrupts auto - inhibition and induces phosphorylation and dimerization of raf .
raf can form heterodimer with other raf family members , which is required for the activation of raf kinase [ 47 - 50 ] .
catalytically active raf kinase phosphorylates and activates mek , which in turn phosphorylates and activates erk [ 46 ] .
after phosphorylated by erk , foxm1 is translocated to the nucleus and binds to the promoter region of its target genes to stimulate their transcription [ 44 ] .
raf proteins are reduced in cells treated with sepin - 1 , which could reduce the activity of the ras - raf - mek - erk cascade , in turn decreasing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of foxm1 .
regulation of raf kinase expression by foxm1 has not been reported .
the mechanisms of how sepin - 1 downregulates raf remain to be elucidated .
conclusion in summary , sepin - 1 inhibits breast cancer cell growth not via apoptosis but possibly via inhibition of cell proliferation .
we speculate that inhibition by sepin - 1 of raf expression negatively affects the phosphorylation of foxm1 by the raf - mek - erk pathway , and possibly its nuclear translocation .
reduced foxm1 decreases the expression of foxm1 itself and causes the collapse of foxm1 expressing positive feedback loop , ultimately leading to the inhibition of foxm1 target genes' expressions , which are critical to the progression of cell - cycle and the proliferation of cells .

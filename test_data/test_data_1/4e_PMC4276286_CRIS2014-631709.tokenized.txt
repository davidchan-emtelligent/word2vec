cases have been reported in the literature of periprosthetic fractures associated with the use of bisphosphonates occurring in the long term following a total hip replacement ( thr ) .
we report an interesting case of periprosthetic fracture secondary to bisphosphonate use only a few months after a thr .
case report .
a 72 - year - old lady ( on bisphosphonates for 10 years ) underwent a thr for osteoarthritis .
she was pain - free in the first four months postoperatively .
thereafter , she developed spontaneous onset of pain in the lateral aspect of her thigh and groin and found it difficult to weight - bear .
x - rays and blood tests were unremarkable .
an ultrasound and mri scan showed no evidence of effusion / collection or periprosthetic fracture .
a radionuclide bone scan showed an abnormal appearance of the right femoral shaft .
a subsequent ct scan showed an oblique vertical split on the anterior surface of the upper right femoral shaft .
this stress fracture was managed nonoperatively with protected weight bearing .
she has progressed well with good clinical and radiological signs of fracture healing. conclusion .
this case is an important addition to our knowledge that bisphosphonate - induced periprosthetic stress fractures can be a cause of hip pain only a few months following a thr .
1. introduction bisphosphonates are osteoclast inhibitors used to treat osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases [ 1 - 5 ] .
although they have reduced the incidence of osteoporotic fractures , there is an increased risk of subtrochanteric and femoral shaft fractures amongst patients on long - term bisphosphonates [ 6 ] .
there have been cases reported in the literature of periprosthetic fractures associated with the use of bisphosphonates occurring in the long term following a total hip replacement ( thr ) [ 7 , 8 ] .
we report a very interesting case of a 72 - year - old lady who had thigh and groin pain only four months after a routine thr and was eventually found to have a periprosthetic fracture after a series of investigations .
this case is an important addition to our knowledge that bisphosphonate - induced periprosthetic fractures should be on the orthopaedic surgeon 's differential diagnosis as an explanation of pain following recent arthroplasty surgery .
2. case presentation a 72 - year - old lady presented to us with osteoarthritis of her right hip in july 2012 .
she had a past medical history of rheumatoid arthritis for 20 years , parkinson 's disease , chronic anaemia , and osteoporosis .
she was on alendronic acid for osteoporosis for 10 years .
other medications included madopar , methotrexate , sulfasalazine , prednisolone , adcal d3 , aspirin , and bisoprolol .
she was a nonsmoker and did not drink any alcohol .
the patient underwent a routine cemented thr in october 2012 .
she had no complications in the perioperative period and was pain - free in the first four months following the procedure .
thereafter , she developed spontaneous onset of pain in the lateral aspect of her thigh , buttock , and groin and found it difficult to weight - bear .
plain x - rays and blood tests including inflammatory markers performed at this stage were unremarkable .
the initial impression was infection , abductor dysfunction , or referred pain from the back .
an outpatient ultrasound ( us ) scan of her right hip was organised .
whilst waiting for this scan she had an episode of pain and felt a crack in her thigh whilst turning in bed at night in june 2013 ( eight months after her thr ) and was subsequently unable to weight - bear .
she was admitted to hospital and plain x - rays of her pelvis , right hip , and femur and blood tests were all normal .
the us scan was normal and an mri scan performed at this stage showed no evidence of effusion / collection or periprosthetic fracture .
plain x - rays of her right femur repeated again in 2 weeks did not show any abnormality .
a radionuclide bone scan was performed at this stage , which showed an abnormal appearance of the right femoral shaft , which could indicate infection or a fracture ( refer to figure 1 ) .
a ct scan was then performed focusing on the area of the hot spot , which showed an oblique vertical split on the anterior surface of the upper right femoral shaft ( refer to figure 2 ) .
therefore a diagnosis of stress fracture secondary to her long - term bisphosphonate use was made .
this was managed nonoperatively with protected weight bearing and the bisphosphonates were stopped .
she has progressed well with good clinical and radiological signs of fracture healing ( refer to figure 3 ) seen during her follow - up clinic visit in september 2013 .
3. discussion this case highlights bisphosphonate - induced periprosthetic femoral stress fracture as a recognisable cause for a painful thr in the early months following a thr .
although not common , it is important to consider this as part of the differential diagnosis of pain following thr especially in a population where bisphosphonates are commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis .
a case reported [ 7 ] in literature described an 81 - year - old lady who had bilateral hybrid thrs and presented with activity related pain in her left thigh approximately 8 years after her procedure .
after thorough investigation she was found to have a periprosthetic fracture around a well fixed implant .
she was treated nonoperatively with protected weight bearing and a course of teriparatide for six months with good recovery .
another study [ 8 ] reports three cases of bisphosphonate - induced periprosthetic fractures three years , 15 years , and 18 years , respectively , following the initial operation .
all cases required a series of investigations to diagnose the fracture and they were successfully managed nonoperatively with protected weight bearing and teriparatide / calcium supplements .
sayed - noor and sjoden [ 9 ] reported that when a cemented implant is well fixed , the load is shared through the implant , the cement , and the bone .
proximally , the majority of the load is borne through the implant and cement , and the load shared by the bone gradually increases from proximal to distal , with the load fully borne by the bone around the tip of the cement .
theoretically , most of the load around the middle and distal thirds of the stem should be borne through the implant and cement and not the lateral cortical bone , even in a severely osteopenic patient .
a fracture at the distal tip of the cement or the tip of a noncemented femoral component may not be unexpected .
in all the cases reported above the periprosthetic fracture occurred much later after the initial operation .
thus far , there have been no cases reported in literature showing bisphosphonate - induced periprosthetic fracture as a cause of painful thr in the short term ( within 6 months ) after the surgery .
our case highlights the fact that this can be a cause for a painful thr in the short term and should be considered to avoid unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment .

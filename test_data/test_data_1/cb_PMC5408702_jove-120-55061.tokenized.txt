a simplified , light - duty version of the process has been designed and implemented for full - size automotive wheels .
the apparatus is intended to assist in understanding the deformation mechanisms and the material response to this type of processing .
an experimental protocol has been developed to prepare for , and subsequently perform forming trials and is described for as - cast a356 wheel blanks .
the thermal profile attained , along with instrumentation details are provided .
similitude with full - scale forming operations which impart significantly more deformation at faster rates is discussed .
engineering issue 120 flow forming metal spinning shear forming a356 aluminum near - net shape manufacturing introduction one of the more challenging metal forming operations currently being practiced in the aerospace and transportation sectors is metal spinning , including derivatives such as shear forming and flow forming12 .
in this process , an axisymmetric workpiece is placed on a mandrel representing the final desired shape , and spun into contact with one or more impinging rollers .
the workpiece being compressed between the roller and mandrel then plastically deforms , with a diverse response including combined bending , thinning and axial elongation .
in a material which has limited ductility or is otherwise difficult to form , this is sometimes carried out at elevated temperature to decrease flow stress and increase ductility. from a processing standpoint , there are a wide range of parameters which can dictate the shape and properties of the manufactured component .
numerous studies have focused on statistical techniques for optimizing various parameters345 .
variables include tooling geometry , such as the shape of the tool and mandrel ; forming speeds including both mandrel rotation rate and tooling feed rates ; as well as material properties .
when elevated temperatures are required , practitioners need to assess the minimum temperature required while still retaining a sound product .
cast aluminum alloys are employed in a wide variety of automotive and aerospace applications , with alloy a356 used in automotive wheels .
however , this alloy is not suitable for forming at room temperature67 owing to its limited ductility and must be formed at elevated temperatures .
this introduces a host of processing complexity , principally in controlling temperature .
as this material 's properties change significantly with temperature8 , it is particularly important to perform instrumented trials in which thermal conditions can be kept to within a reasonable processing window and be monitored .
detailed data on the thermomechanical behavior of as - cast a356 ranging from ambient temperature to 500 degreesc over a wide range of strain rates can be reviewed elsewhere.9 in order to support development and optimization of flow forming operations for wheel manufacturing , custom forming equipment has been developed at the department of materials engineering at the university of british columbia ( figure 1 ) .
this apparatus has been built primarily from a manual , belt - driven capstan lathe with a total output of 22 kw , and a propane torch heating system with a peak output of 82 kw ( figure 2 ) .
a mandrel with embedded thermocouples along with a rigid roller assembly ( figure 3 ) has been installed , which is capable of forming workpieces up to 330 mm in diameter .
the mandrel has a manually activated clamping system which is able to account for large changes in workpiece diameter occurring during processing ( figure 4 ) .
a battery operated data acquisition ( daq ) system containing a miniature wireless computer capable of monitoring the temperature of the mandrel during forming and the blank for characterizing heating has been installed on the quill of the lathe .
while other flow forming processes have been synthesized using adapted lathes410 , the present apparatus is the first to embody in situ heating and thermal data acquisition .
a processing protocol for industrially - scaled forming operations has been developed to provide indicative processing conditions .
described subsequently , this protocol consists of tooling and workpiece preparation , forming practice , concluding with end of forming trial operations .

protocol 1 .
workpiece preparation for forming trials acquire as - cast workpieces machined to the mandrel size such that the inner diameter runout is 0.2 mm , while the outer diameter retains as much cast surface as possible .
note : if blanks are drawn from full - size wheel castings , machining operations are required to remove all hub and spoke portions , while providing features which can be employed to clamp the workpiece to the mandrel .
this includes removal of the in - board flange .
pre - heat a coffin furnace able to receive the entire workpiece to 135 degreesc , clean the workpiece with degreaser and place in furnace for an hour to prepare for thermal barrier coating application .
rapidly remove the workpiece from the furnace , and place on a coating jig .
using an automotive - type paint sprayer , apply a thin layer of thermal barrier die coating to the inner diameter .
note : this coating will provide lubrication and reduce heat transfer to the mandrel during forming operations .
2. tooling preparation wipe down the mandrel surface with a damp cloth .
ensure that the mandrel has a total rotational runout of < 0.5 mm using a dial gauge indicator along the forming length .
assess this with a live tooling center engaged on the tailstock plate .
using a torque wrench , ensure that all fasteners aside from those on the clamp assemblies are tightened to specified torque values for grade 12.9 bolts ( in nm : m8 - 40 , m12 - 135 , m16 - 340 ) .
start the pre - heating system by first powering the gas supply solenoid , and then igniting the torches with a flint spark lighter .
run the pre - heating system for 10 min to expel any condensate collected in the torches / hoses .
extinguish by deactivating the gas supply solenoid .
remove any loose / oxidized coating layer on the mandrel with dry 600 / p1200 grit silicon carbide paper while turning the mandrel at 20 rotations per minute ( rpm ) .
power the on - board data acquisition module , and run the pre - heating system until the thermocouples embedded in the mandrel surface read 200 degreesc with the live center engaged .
using an automotive - type paint sprayer , lightly coat the mandrel surface with a water - based forging lubricant and allow the rotary tooling to cool to ambient temperature with the live tooling center engaged .
loosen the jam nut assembly on the roller stand ( figure 3 ) with a wrench .
set the approach or attack angle on the roller assembly using a toolmaker 's protractor , and tighten both internal and external nuts ( m35 - 750 nm ) .
assemble the 3 clamp assemblies ( figure 4 ) by first engaging the m12 shoulder bolt to connect element 2 to the clamp bracket .
inspect for any thermal distortion which will prevent element 2 in figure 4 from smoothly running against the clamp bracket .
ensure that they move freely , lightly sanding the contact surfaces with dry 320 / p400 grit silicon carbide paper .
apply a thin layer of high temperature molybdenum - based lubricant with a cloth as needed .
3. forming operations move the roller tool stand completely away from the mandrel towards the spindle , move the tailstock and center to be clear of the mandrel .
manually slide the workpiece onto the mandrel ensuring even engagement .
note : as the blanks are nominally axisymmetric , there is no preferred orientation .
assemble the clamps onto the mandrel by engaging the tapered die pins and hand tightening m16 bolts running through the mandrel into the clamp blocks .
ensure that there is even pressure being applied by rotating and manually tightening , followed by a pneumatic impact wrench set to 50 nm. start the heating system and immediately start the mandrel rotating at 20 rpm .
keep applying heat until clamps loosen .
for the process considered , this is approximately 3 min .
note : this time will be slightly different for each workpiece due to subtle differences in workpiece / mandrel fitment .
extinguish the heating system and stop the rotation of the mandrel such that the first clamp is accessible with an impact wrench .
within 30 s , tighten all clamps with an impact or manual wrench and record the surface temperature of the workpiece in 3 locations along the length of the forming region with a reed - type thermocouple probe .
repeat step 3.4 until the workpiece is at an appropriate forming temperature ; at a minimum , 350 degreesc for a356 .
perform a final tightening of the clamps with an impact wrench set to 200 nm. move the roller axially and radially ( approx. 2 - 5 mm from workpiece surface ) into position for forming , and perform one last clamp tightening ( i.e. step 3.4 ). with the heating system on , increase the rotation rate of the lathe to the intended forming speed , engage the roller to a pre - set depth into the workpiece , and activate the screw - cutting feed to move the roller axially along the length of the workpiece .
note : for the present geometry , reasonable results were attained at 281 rpm with an axial movement of 0.21 mm / revolution .
repeat step 3.7 as required to increase levels of deformation .
after each forming pass , ensure that the temperature does not drop below the optimal forming temperature by stopping the mandrel and using the same reed - type thermocouple probe as employed in step 3.4 .
if the optimal forming temperature has dropped , repeat steps 3.4 and 3.5 to reheat .
note : reheating can be employed , however at the expense of potentially reaching the extent of the clamp system 's ability to restrain the workpiece .
4. post forming operations once the desired level of deformation has been obtained , stop the heating system , and undo all clamps , and disengage the tailstock to obtain clearance for workpiece removal .
gently tap the workpiece with a piece of brass to separate from the mandrel .
if this proves to be ineffective , re - engage the heating system and rotate the mandrel at 20 rpm gently tapping until the blank separates .
using an appropriate manipulation tool such as tongs or heavily insulated gloves , either quench the workpiece in water at 60 degreesc to prevent further ageing , or leave to air cool to minimize residual stress / distortion .
representative results as - cast aluminum a356 workpieces were formed according to the method described in this paper .
the workpieces were obtained from as - cast wheels from a north american wheel manufacturer employing the low - pressure die casting process .
one workpiece instrumented with thermocouples was not formed , but underwent the pre - heating cycle ( protocol section 3 , steps 3.3 - 3.5 ) to capture the distribution of temperature across the surface of the blank during this aspect of the process .
this response is shown in figure 5 .
a further 3 samples were deformed to various levels , including one which received two forming passes for a high level of deformation .
the first two samples and the first pass performed on the latter sample served to straighten the workpiece with little demonstrable change in wall thickness .
the latter sample peak wall thickness reduction was approximately 10 % , the majority of which was achieved in the second pass .
cross - sections and microstructure of the as - cast blank and those obtained in multi - pass sample are shown in figure 6 .
here , the as - cast microstructure is shown to significantly be refined by the process with dendritic features barely discernable .
the interdendritic eutectic is broken up by the deformation imposed , creating a much more homogenous microstructure than in the as - cast state .
this improves the overall ductility as well as fatigue and fracture properties of the component .
the authors have previously described more details of workpiece geometry , specific cross - sectional changes in wall thickness , defects observed , and dimensional variation in microstructure on the full set of samples813 .

discussion the representative results shown above highlight that the protocol and equipment employed is capable of forming cast aluminum at elevated temperatures , and has provided a platform to determine a processing window for flow forming of wheels .
the technique demonstrated can be used to explore aspects of forming envelopes , including how both formed and unformed material responds to heat treatment8 .
however , there is room for improvement with the current processing protocol with this apparatus .
regarding further instrumentation , which would accelerate process model development , the inclusion of machine - tool dynamometer and tribometers1112 to measure forming loads and friction factors on the roller would provide important information about the process conditions .
this is a widely employed instrumentation technique for orthogonal machining studies , and could be readily implemented on the current machine .
this additional instrumentation would provide useful data to accurately validate of modelling efforts1314 and support the increasing industrial interest in this process .
in order to effectively capture the evolution of temperature of the blank during processing , a non - contact measurement technique is desirable .
however , common infrared - based techniques are hampered by aluminum 's low emissivity and how the surface changes during processing .
this is the principal reason why an instrumented , commissioning blank was employed to capture the typical thermal response achieved with the protocol described , and served to populate a baseline heat transfer analysis to relate mandrel surface temperature to the workpiece .
as it is largely a manual forming process for a material which is sensitive to time at temperature , some inconsistencies between run to run are to be expected .
aluminum alloys have microstructures that are highly sensitive to temperatures above 100degreesc due to ageing mechanisms .
therefore , the most critical steps within the protocol are 1.2 and 3.3 - 3.7 , where the blank is at elevated temperatures .
tightening and re - seating the clamps must be conducted as quickly as possible to maintain repeatability between forming operations .
the in situ workpiece heating employed during the pre - heating step is quite inefficient and could be improved via radiative heating .
the overall processing speeds in terms of mandrel and tool movements that can be attained are somewhat limited by the capabilities of the lathe employed .
higher forming speeds require a more rigid frame with a higher load capacity , particularly if the forming of a stronger material were to be attempted .
workpiece clamping and release could be improved with the addition of hydraulic or pneumatic actuation .
as heat transfer from the blank to the mandrel is largely a function of the pressure imposed by the workpiece onto the mandrel , this addition could also improve a model - based approach to ascertain the workpiece temperature during forming with the existing system .
the apparatus and procedure described has shown that forming loads for this material under these conditions approaches those for standard turning operations , and remains a very cost effective process by which to perform manufacturing trials .
research into different manufacturing routes and formability can be performed away from commercial forming equipment , which is exceedingly expensive to operate. with the apparatus and protocol described , processing parameters can be investigated prior to constructing larger scale , higher throughput equipment , and to the authors' knowledge , is a unique approach .
as the protocol developed has only been applied to one specific variant of cast aluminum alloy , there is a multitude of other aluminum foundry alloys which could be investigated for a variety of applications beyond automotive wheels .
as these alloys have approximately similar processing windows from a temperature perspective , the protocol developed can be readily adapted .

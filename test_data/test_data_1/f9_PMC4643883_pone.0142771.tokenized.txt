telomere integrity in drosophila melanogaster is maintained by a putative multisubunit complex called terminin that is believed to act in analogy to the mammalian shelterin complex in protecting chromosome ends from being recognized as sites of dna damage .
the five proteins supposed to form the terminin complex are hp1 - orc associated protein , hp1 - hoap interacting protein , verrocchio , drosophila telomere loss / modigliani and heterochromatic protein 1 .
four of these proteins evolve rapidly within the drosophila genus .
the accelerated evolution of terminin components may indicate the involvement of these proteins in the process by which new species arise , as the resulting divergence of terminin proteins might prevent hybrid formation , thus driving speciation .
however , terminin is not an experimentally proven entity , and no biochemical studies have been performed to investigate its assembly and action in detail .
motivated by these facts in order to initiate biochemical studies on terminin function , we attempted to reconstitute terminin by co - expressing its subunits in bacteria and investigated the possible role of the fast - evolving parts of terminin components in complex assembly .
our results suggest formation of stable subcomplexes of terminin , but not of the whole complex in vitro .
we found that the accelerated evolution is restricted to definable regions of terminin components , and that the divergence of d. melanogaster drosophila telomere loss and d. yakuba verrocchio proteins does not preclude their stable interaction .

introduction the ends of the linear genetic material represent two problems regarding their faithful maintenance throughout cell generations .
first there is the problem of end replication by the replicative dna polymerases , which can result in a gradual loss of genetic material during replication cycles [ 1 , 2 ] .
the second problem is that chromosome ends might be recognized as double - stranded dna breaks ( dsb ) that can trigger dsb repair , resulting in structural rearrangements of chromosomes and keeping checkpoint processes sustained at the expense of suspending normal cell cycle [ 3 ] .
these problems have been circumvented during eukaryotic evolution by the " invention " of the telomere and its associated proteins .
chromosome ends are usually elongated by telomerase through reverse transcription that results in repetitive telomeric dna [ 4 ] .
telomere ' capping ' proteins bind these repetitive dna sequences to form a protecting ' cap ' complex .
it has been proposed that the single - stranded part of the telomere ( 3 ' - overhang ) folds back to its homologous sequence and hybridizes to its complement while displacing the identical strand .
this dna structure is called a t - loop [ 5 ] ; it prevents the end from being recognized by components of dna repair and checkpoint processes as a double - stranded dna break [ 6 , 7 ] .
in drosophila both the elongation of the chromosome ends and the inhibition of the chromosome fusions follow a seemingly different way compared to human and other canonical telomeres [ 8 , 9 , 10 ] .
drosophila chromosome ends are elongated by insertions of non - ltr retrotransposons such as het - a , tart and tahre , instead of reverse transcription by telomerase [ 11 , 12 , 13 ] .
therefore it is not surprising that in the lack of short telomeric repeats of defined sequences , the " canonical " capping proteins are also missing .
nevertheless , capping must take place and it has been suggested to be performed by a complex [ 14 ] consisting of the hp1 - orc associated protein ( hoap ) [ 15 , 16 ] , the hp1 - hoap interacting protein ( hiphop ) [ 17 ] , the verrocchio ( ver ) [ 18 ] , the drosophila telomere loss ( dtl ) also known as modigliani ( moi ) [ 19 , 20 ] and the conserved heterochromatic protein 1 ( hp1 ) [ 21 , 22 , 23 ] .
immunostaining verified that these proteins co - localize at the telomeres , and deletion of any of the genes encoding these proteins causes chromosome fusions [ 14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 21 ] .
in addition , interactions between individual members of this alleged protein complex were also demonstrated by gst pull - down experiments [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] .
further studies revealed that hoap and hiphop are even capable to mutually stabilize each other at the telomeres [ 17 ] .
the above - described evidences indicate that these proteins most probably participate in the same pathway and contribute to telomere maintenance .
similarly to t - loops in canonical telomeres , drosophila telomeres are also postulated to be complex structures containing both double - and single - stranded dna [ 11 ] .
this assumption and the observations on dna - binding properties of some terminin members suggest the possibility of their interaction with dna as a multivalent entity .
based on these observations , the existence of a multisubunit protein complex has been suggested that may work in analogy to the canonical capping complex .
it has been designated as the drosophila terminin complex [ 14 ] .
however , the lack of purified material precluded biochemical characterization of the putative complex and particularly its dna - binding affinity .
moreover , even the very existence of the terminin complex as a discrete entity needs further verification .
a particularly interesting feature of most of the terminin proteins is their accelerated evolution .
comparing d. melanogaster proteins with their orthologs from other drosophila species revealed that hoap , hiphop , ver and dtl / moi are more diverse in their amino acid sequence than drosophila proteins on average [ 14 , 15 , 17 - 19 ] .
this surely raises some concerns regarding complex assembly .
do the changes occur in an essentially random pattern or do they affect only discrete parts of the proteins ?
in case of this latter possibility , the fast - evolving parts may mark distinct functional domains of the proteins .
such domains can be , for example , interaction motifs which should change concomitantly within each interacting partner to ensure proper interplay .
on the other hand , it can be expected that if the changes hinder the formation of molecular interactions between terminin components of closely related but distinct species , thereby these ultimately contribute to post - zygotic isolation .
in order to initiate studies addressing these questions we analyzed the pattern of rapidly changing residues in terminin subunits , and found that they define discrete parts of the proteins , which can be considered as domains in most cases .
next we tried to reconstitute the terminin complex by expressing its components in a heterologous system .
we found that four out of the five terminin members can be expressed at high level in bacteria but form insoluble aggregates .
co - expression improved protein solubility ; however , we detected the formation of only two discrete subcomplexes , despite that previous data are compatible with the existence of a stable heterotetrameric subcomplex of terminin [ 18 , 19 ] .
we used one of the subcomplexes , the stable ver - dtl / moi heterodimer to address the possibility of interspecies heterodimer formation , and found that formation of such a dimeric structure between d. melanogaster and d. yakuba proteins can in fact occur .
results accelerated evolution affects discrete parts of terminin proteins the speed of evolution is usually quantified by the proportion of non - synonymous ( pn ) and synonymous ( ps ) substitutions .
higher pn / ps ratio means faster evolution of a protein .
based on this criterion drosophila telomere capping proteins with the exception of hp1 show accelerated evolution [ 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 ] .
however , pn / ps values are statistical , thus reflect the evolution rate for entire molecules , though that could be significantly different within molecules .
in order to determine the pn / ps values for protein domains we compared available terminin sequences from 21 drosophila species .
first the sequences were aligned to each other , then homology plots were calculated based on the alignments ( fig 1 ) .
we also included the conserved globin1 [ 24 ] and the fast - evolving lethal hybride rescue ( lhr ) [ 25 ] proteins in our calculations as reference points .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142771.g001 fig 1 sequence alignments reveal discrete parts of terminin proteins being subject to accelerated evolution .
homology plots show different conservation rates in distinct parts of terminin proteins .
each column represents the percentage of the consensus amino acid at the given position .
blue columns indicate regions where a gap occurs in some of the compared sequences as a result of deletion or insertion .
arrowheads and numbers represent domain boundaries considered during pn / ps calculations .
homology plots show the percentage of the most frequently found amino acid for each position in the compared sequences .
we used these plots to determine whether the speed of evolution is uniform within molecules .
we found that in most cases homology plots clearly showed that different parts of terminin protein molecules have evolved at different rates .
areas with similar amino acid conservation values correspond generally to protein domains identified earlier ( fig 1 ) .
we calculated the pn / ps ratio ( based on codon alignments ) for each identified domain ( fig 2 ) in order to compare the speed of evolution between and within molecules .
the presented pn / ps values are averages of pairwise calculations .
since the evolution of the full - length proteins has already been studied [ 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 ] we compared the evolution of domains to that of the whole proteins .
protein domains having pn / ps values below 0.2 according to our calculations were considered as conserved , whereas domains having pn / ps values above 0.4 were considered as fast - evolving ones .
for comparison : similar calculations for the conserved globin1 and fast - evolving lhr proteins of drosophilae yielded values of 0.14 and 0.48 , respectively .
we found that the changes observed within terminin proteins follow characteristic patterns as summarized below .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142771.g002 fig 2 pn / ps values for entire proteins and for domains of terminin proteins indicate high rate of evolution .
the pn / ps values shown in the diagram are averages of values obtained by pairwise comparisons with error bars representing standard deviation .
globin1 and lhr represent conserved and fast - evolving proteins , respectively , as reference points .
hp1 [ 26 , 27 ] is a conserved protein that has a low overall pn / ps ratio ( 0,16 ) .
the protein contains three domains , namely the chromo domain [ 28 ] , the chromo shadow domain [ 29 , 30 ] and a hinge region linking these two .
we found the chromo and chromo shadow domains to be highly conserved ( 0.12 and 0.06 pn / ps ratio ) , whereas the hinge region shows higher variability ( 0.35 ) ( fig 1 ) .
the hoap protein can be divided into the hmg - like domain and the proline - rich region , which is responsible for interaction with hp1 hinge and chromo shadow regions [ 31 ] .
according to the homology plot the hmg - like domain shows higher conservation values than the proline - rich region .
the proline - rich region shows greater sequence diversity , which results in poor alignment with frequent gaps .
however , a conserved motif could be identified at the c - terminal of this region ( fig 1 ) .
we also compared the 7 known paralogs of hoap [ 32 ] , and found that they show a similar pattern of conservation ( fig 1 ) , therefore the paralogs were also included in pn / ps calculations .
the results show that hoap is a fast - evolving protein ( 0.60 ) and both of its domains have high pn / ps values ( 0.52 and 0.77 ) ( fig 2 ) .
hiphop can be divided into three parts based on the speed of its evolution : it has a conserved c - terminal region , which is believed to be responsible for localizing hiphop in heterochromatin [ 33 ] , a variable hp1 - hoap interacting domain [ 17 ] , and an extreme variable region , which connects the two .
these domains and their evolutionary speed have been studied and the findings are described [ 33 ] .
the homology plots that we calculated for the 21 known hiphop amino acid sequences are in accord with the data available on hiphop evolution [ 33 ] ( fig 1 ) .
similarly to hoap , hiphop has many paralogs [ 32 ] .
( the hiphop paralog in d. melanogaster is called k81 , which is described as a " paternal effect gene " [ 34 ].) we found that the 15 hiphop paralogs displayed similar patterns in homology plots as hiphop ( fig 1 ) .
the results concerning the evolution of hiphop domains obtained from comparisons including 36 hiphop and paralog sequences ( fig 2 ) were consistent with the expectations , indicating that the c - terminal domain is highly conserved ( 0.165 ) , whereas the other two domains show rapid rates of evolution ( 0.53 and 0.79 ) .
ver consists of an ob - fold domain as described by raffa et al .
[ 18 ] .
ob - fold domains are responsible for oligosaccharide or oligonucleotide binding .
ver is supposed to bind single - stranded dna [ 18 ] .
the only known paralog of ver ( in d. willistoni ) was also included in our calculations .
based on homology plots , regions of the ver molecule show high conservation values ; however , these regions are stretches not longer than 10 amino acids ( fig 1 ) .
because the ob - fold domain of ver corresponds to nearly the entire protein , we calculated the pn / ps values for the whole sequence .
the result confirmed the fast evolution of ver ( 0,411 ) ( fig 2 ) .
dtl / moi has no identified domain structure .
the homology plot did not reveal domain boundaries either ; however , short conserved motifs can be found within the dtl / moi sequences ( fig 1 ) .
this suggests that dtl / moi is a single - domain protein , consequently we calculated pn / ps values for the whole sequences .
the data show that dtl / moi is a fast - evolving protein , as it was expected ( 0.47 ) ( fig 2 ) .
taken together , our analysis demonstrates that the pn / ps ratio calculated for a whole molecule could be misleading because of its statistical characteristics .
a protein can consist of fast - evolving regions and conserved domains , and it depends on the ratio of these whether or not a whole protein can be considered to be fast - evolving .
conserved domains are usually functional parts of the molecules , whereas variable parts often serve as spacers or perhaps have a role in regulation .
in the case of telomere capping proteins even the functional domains are variable as much as linker regions are in other molecules , which indicates that their evolution proceeds with a remarkable speed .
such fast - evolving domains with potential roles in protein - protein or protein - dna interactions are the hmg - like domain of hoap , the hp1 - hoap - interacting domain of hiphop , the ob - fold domain of ver and the dtl / moi domain .
these are ideal targets for studying the effect of accelerated evolution on complex assembly and can be exploited in planning in vitro experiments .
bacterial expression of terminin proteins previous studies have indicated interactions among terminin components as summarized in fig 3a .
in brief : ver interacts with dtl / moi and hoap [ 18 ] , and dtl / moi interacts with ver , hoap and hp1 [ 19 ] .
however , hiphop does not interact directly with ver or dtl / moi [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] .
to verify these interactions and to explore more connections between specific terminin proteins , furthermore to uncover signs of co - evolution which might play a role in speciation , we studied heterologously expressed terminin proteins .
our strategy to obtain recombinant terminin components for complex assembly studies involved cloning cdna sequences into expression vector ( s ) and producing the proteins in bacteria .
for each of the five proteins we attempted to express , we used cdna fragments encoding the complete coding regions , nonetheless in some cases we observed expression of shorter products resulting from degradation ( see later in more detail ) .
the use of monocistronic constructs revealed that hp1 , hoap , ver and dtl / moi were expressed at high level upon induction in bl21de3 codon plus ril cells .
hp1 appeared in denaturing gels as two bands , the lower being an n - terminal truncation , which was present even if the cells were lysed directly in sds sample buffer after harvesting .
hiphop expression was consistently low , and despite various attempts which included alterations in construct designs , conditions of induction and choices of host cells and as well trials of co - expression with other terminin proteins , we could not achieve notable expression .
the expression of hiphop at low level was , however , verified by immunodetection of the heterologously expressed ha tag - labelled protein [ data not shown ] .

on panel b images of different parts of the same gel are shown .

on panel c different parts of the same gel are shown except for the part with dtl / moi - ver data .
l : molecular weight marker ladder , w : whole cell extract , s : supernatant , p : pellet , nc : control supernatant without any heterologous protein .
the heterologous expression of the majority of terminin proteins , however , resulted in an insoluble pellet after cell lysis , as judged by comparing coomassie - stained samples on sds - page .
using arctic express cells as host , the solubility of hoap , hp1 improved ( by more than 50 %) , whereas the majority of ver and dtl / moi proteins remained in inclusion bodies .
often the insolubility of expressed proteins can be overcome by co - expression of interacting partners [ 35 , 36 , 37 ] .
in line with this logic , instead of purifying individual subunits for reconstitution attempts , we constructed polycistronic plasmids for simultaneous expression of various cdnas .
we found that co - expression of ver with dtl / moi and of hp1 with hoap increased the solubility of these proteins quite differently : in the case of ver and dtl / moi it resulted in a barely detectable improvement on coomassie - stained sds - page , whereas hoap and hp1 co - expression resulted in nearly completely soluble proteins ( fig 3 ) .
co - expression of ver and hoap or ver , hoap and hp1 did not increase the solubility of ver .
however , co - expression of all four proteins , namely hoap , hp1 , ver and dtl / moi resulted in soluble ver and dtl / moi proteins ( fig 3c ) .
these observations indicate that soluble terminin proteins can be produced by their co - expression .
these results also suggest that the presence of hiphop is not an absolute requirement for complex formation .
this notion is in accord with the presumed interactions among these molecules based on earlier studies [ 17 - 19 ] ( fig 3a ) , which suggests that a stable heterotetramer terminin subcomplex may form in the absence of hiphop .
purification of ver and dtl / moi in order to gain insight into the subunit composition of the putative terminin complex , we subjected the lysate of cells that co - expressed the four heterologous proteins ( hoap , hp1 , ver and dtl / moi ) to chromatography on heparin - sepharose column .
( the weak ion exchange matrix was chosen because of its proven suitability for purification of dna - binding proteins ) .
we found that ver together with dtl / moi , and similarly hoap together with hp1 eluted in different fractions ( fig 4a ) .
although full - length proteins were expressed , the hoap proline - rich region was truncated during purification .
supplementing the four co - expressed proteins with samples of hiphop obtained from a larger volume did not change the above - described result : not surprisingly hiphop co - eluted with hoap and hp1 .

ver and dtl / moi co - eluted in the first 4 fractions , whereas hoap and hp1 co - eluted at higher salt concentrations .
hp1 elutes in two peaks : in fractions 4 - 6 , and fractions 8 - 12 , the latter being observed only if hoap is present .

molecular weight marker ladder ( l ) , input ( inp ) , flow - through ( ft ) and fraction numbers and the position of the respected proteins are indicated .
we subjected peak fractions from the heparin - sepharose matrix to gel filtration at low salt concentration to investigate the existence of two sub - complexes ( fig 4c ) .
in the case of co - eluted hoap and hp1 the stoichiometry remained unclear , since a shorter form of hoap (~ 40 kda ) was also present in the samples and co - purified with the full - length hoap and hp1 proteins .
according to mass spectrometry , this represented a truncated form of hoap that had lost part of its proline - rich region ( fig 4b ) .
during gel filtration hoap and hp1 co - migrate forming a broad peak that suggests the presence of several complex types .
the sizes of complexes are between 66 and 40 kda , suggesting that hp1 homodimers and dimers of hoap and hp1 involving both truncated and full - length versions could be formed .
although in our experiments hoap co - purified with hp1 , indicating an interaction between the two proteins , we could not verify the 1:2 stoichiometry of hoap : hp1 interaction reported by badugu et al .
[ 31 ] .
this could be explained with the partial loss of the proline - rich region of hoap .
this region is supposedly responsible for interaction with the hp1 dimer [ 31 ] .
thus our observations suggest that secondary interacting surfaces may be present .
mixing the peak fractions that eluted from the heparin - sepharose matrix at low salt did not change the profile of the subsequent gel filtration , indicating that the elution of ver - dtl / moi and hoap - hp1 in two peaks from heparin - sepharose is not due to the increasing salt concentration used during development of the column ( fig 4c ) .
the formation of a stable heterodimer of ver and dtl / moi was also verified by processing the soluble fraction from bicistronic expression similarly as described above : ver and dtl / moi were bound to a heparin - sepharose column and eluted at low nacl concentration ( fig 5a ) .
during gel filtration ver and dtl / moi proteins co - migrated as one single peak corresponding to a 45 kda mass , which contained the two proteins in 1:1 ratio as expected ( fig 5b ) .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142771.g005 fig 5 ver and dtl / moi form a heterodimer that could be purified independently from other terminin proteins .

( b ) the first 5 fractions of the purification shown on panel a containing ver and dtl / moi proteins were combined and gel - filtrated on superdex 200 10 / 300 gl column .
molecular weight marker ( l ) , input ( inp ) , flow through ( ft ) and fraction numbers and the position of the respected proteins are indicated .
as noted above , dtl / moi and ver are both rapidly evolving proteins .
drosophila yakuba ver is 83 % identical with d. melanogaster ver .
the identity of d. melanogaster dtl / moi and d. yakuba dtl / moi is 89 % .
( the identity between globin1 and lhr proteins of these two drosophila species is 98 % and 69 % , respectively. ) one can assume that the differences between these proteins could influence protein - protein interactions and may affect protein function as well , therefore might have contributed to the isolation of species .
to attempt an experimental verification of this concept we investigated if d. yakuba ver could form a complex with d. melanogaster dtl / moi .
for this we co - expressed and purified the two proteins .
we found that they are able to bind to heparin - sepharose column as a hybrid complex and can be eluted similarly to the dimer of the two corresponding d. melanogaster proteins ( fig 6a ) .
the formation of the d. yakuba ver and d. melanogaster dtl / moi dimer was successfully demonstrated by gel filtration as well ( fig 6b ) .
thus , we concluded that d. yakuba ver forms a stable heterodimer with d. melanogaster dtl / moi .
10.1371 / journal.pone.0142771.g006 fig 6 d. yakuba ver and d. melanogaster dtl / moi form co - purifying hybrid complex .
( a ) cell lysate containing co - expressed d. yakuba ver and d. melanogaster dtl / moi was loaded onto heparin - sepharose column and the proteins were eluted by an increasing nacl gradient .

different parts of the same gel are shown .
( b ) fractions of the purification shown above containing d. yakuba ver and d. melanogaster dtl / moi ( fractions : 1 - 6 ) were combined and gel - filtrated on superdex 200 10 / 300 gl column .
the two proteins eluted in the same fractions in 1:1 ratio at 45kda suggesting the formation of a hybrid complex .
molecular weight marker ( l ) , input ( inp ) , flow through ( ft ) and fraction numbers , and the position of the respected proteins are indicated .
discussion we attempted to reconstitute the drosophila terminin complex from proposed terminin proteins expressed in bacteria either individually or together from polycistronic transcription units .
our efforts to express hiphop in larger amounts failed repeatedly , hampering our attempts .
though our system is limited in this respect , existing data on pairwise interactions between terminin proteins suggest that the presence of hiphop might not be an absolute requirement for complex formation , and a heterotetramer terminin subcomplex may form in the absence of hiphop .
remarkably , we did not observe the presence of a tetrameric complex during purification of four co - expressed capping proteins , but detected subcomplexes consisting of ver - dtl / moi and hoap - hp1 .
moreover , the ver - dtl / moi and hoap - hp1 sub - complexes were eluted in different fractions .
this might indicate that the described protein interactions are not equally important to hold a multisubunit complex together .
in particular the hoap - dtl / moi , hp1 - dtl / moi and hoap - ver interactions seem to be weaker compared to interactions forming between the previous two pairs of proteins .
on the other hand , we cannot exclude the possibility that hiphop might be an essential component for complex stability .
hoap is needed for the localization of ver and dtl / moi at the telomeres , and interactions were detected among these proteins by gst - pull - down assays [ 18 , 19 ] .
in experiments performed on artificial telomeres hoap , hiphop and hp1 co - localized , whereas dtl / moi did not [ 17 ] .
our data are in accord with results of these studies .
in summary , despite limitations of the heterologous expression systems , such as lack of posttranslational modifications and probing terminin complex formation in the lack of specific dna structure , we have successfully produced two subcomplexes of terminin proteins .
the subsequent steps of complex assembly might require the presence of dna or involve non - terminin proteins that have a role in telomere maintenance .
the fast evolution of capping proteins raises several interesting questions regarding co - evolution of interacting proteins and the possible role of terminin formation in speciation .
proteins that have a crucial function in telomere maintenance are expected to be conserved to preserve function , yet terminin proteins show accelerated evolution .
this contradiction could be resolved by two reasonings .
the first option is that , although these molecules are considered to be fast - evolving proteins - - based on their pn / ps ratio or similarity data - - they actually contain conserved domains that are responsible for their conserved function .
an example for this could be the conserved c - terminal of hiphop that is a functioning part of the molecule .
another solution could be that the functional domains also evolve rapidly .
in that case the domains must be able to accumulate many mutations without affecting the main function of the proteins .
we found four domains , the hmg - like domain of hoap , the hp1 - hoap interacting domain of hiphop , the ob - fold domain of ver and the uncharacterized dtl / moi domain that show accelerated evolution and still maintain function .
in these domains there are only short - - a few amino acid long - - conserved motifs .
we hypothesize that these motifs might be positioned next to each other during folding to create a core which ensures a proper structure that is responsible for the function of the protein .
several amino acid variations could serve to position these motifs correctly , therefore the lower selection pressure explains the fast evolution .
members of the ob fold protein family can serve as good examples to demonstrate that an identical structure could be produced by different sequences [ 38 ] .
other studies have also reported on fast - evolving proteins with conserved function [ 39 , 40 ] .
we hoped that examination of the interaction of dtl / moi and ver can provide information on whether their accelerated evolution has a role in forming species barriers .
we reasoned that a lack of interaction between terminin proteins might be used as an argument for a role in speciation .
because we wished to capture speciation in progress , we selected drosophila species , which are in close evolutionary relationship .
we reasoned that more distant species are more likely to develop other speciation barriers , which could be based on differences in morphology , behavior , size , etc .
we found that d. yakuba ver , which differs in 17 % of its amino acids from d. melanogaster ver forms a complex with d. melanogaster dtl / moi in spite of the 11 % difference between d. melanogaster dtl / moi and d. yakuba dtl / moi .
thus the observed existence of interspecies interaction might be interpreted as a counter argument against a role of the terminin proteins in speciation .
however , like in other cases , proving a " no role " is difficult , since several factors , among them the degree of divergence , the species included , the roles of the tested proteins in the complex and several others should be considered .
the complexity of the problem is demonstrated by a recent publication of fukagawa [ 41 ] , which explains the mechanism by which lethal hybrid rescue ( lhr ) and hybrid male rescue ( hmr ) act as hybrid incompatibility genes .
interestingly , the d. simulans lhr protein is unable to cause male lethality if the d. melanogaster hmr gene product is not present in the hybrid , therefore an interaction between these proteins is required in order to function as speciation barrier [ 42 ] .
this observation suggests that it is the altered function and not the loss of function of the hybrid complex that has a role in separating species .
the cross - species stable heterodimer of d. yakuba ver and d. melanogaster dtl / moi might need to be considered similarly .
therefore the hypothesis that terminin proteins play role as speciation barrier remains to be tested .
to examine this question more thoroughly , experiments are needed to test functional changes in hybrid complexes both in vitro and in vivo .
our experimental system of producing the terminin proteins and the results of our analysis of identifying their fast - evolving regions provide a base to plan these experiments .
materials and methods sequence alignments the drosophila melanogaster genome regions corresponding to terminin genes were downloaded from flybase .
these sequences were used for blastn searches in whole - genome shotgun contig databases of 21drosophila species ( drosophila ananassae , d. biarmipes , d. bipectinata , d. elegans , d. erecta , d. eugracilis , d. ficusphila , d. grimshawi , d. kikkawai , d. melanogaster , d. miranda , d. mojavensis , d. persimilis , d. pseudoobscura pseudoobscura , d. rhopaloa , d. sechellia , d. simulans , d. takahashii , d. virilis , d. willistoni , d. yakuba ) .
the drosophila albomicans sequences were not used in this study because of the preliminary stage of sequence data processing at the time of the analysis we performed .
the initial blast searches did not result hits in each species therefore results of first searches were used as quarries for further blastn searches to detect missing sequences .
dubruille et al. have described many hiphop and hoap orthologs and paralogs in detail [ 32 ] we complemented our sequence identification data with their findings .
we have identified further hoap and hiphop orthologs in drosophila erecta , d. miranda , d. sechellia , and d. yakuba .
we have also identified a hoap duplication in d. miranda , based on sequence similarity .
the paralog and ortholog sequences were distinquished by their genomic environment .
we have downloaded the extended sequence of the blast hits and predicted the coding regions by augustus software ( http :// bioinf.uni - greifswald.de / augustus ) [ 43 ] .
in those cases when augustus was unable to detect any open reading frame ( some verrocchio sequences ) the coding region was determined by ugene software ( unipro ) [ 44 ] .
the locations of the coding regions and the annotation numbers ( gi ) of the sequences used are described in s1 table .
the predicted coding sequences were translated into amino acid sequences and aligned by t - coffee algorithm with standard settings ( - 50 gap opening penalty ) in ugene .
homology plots were also calculated .
the codon alignments were based on these amino acid alignments and generated by pal2nal [ 45 ] software .
the ratio of non - synonymous and synonymous substitutions in the codon alignments were calculated by snap for each of sequence pair ( www.hiv.lanl.gov ) [ 46 ] .
cloning full - length cdnas were obtained from drosophila genomics resource center , indiana university , bloomington .
in order to construct expression plasmids cdnas were amplified in high fidelity pcr reactions using phusion ( thermo scientific ) polymerase using primers listed below : hp1 : gacaccatgggcaagaaaatcgacaaccctgagagctc , gacaggatccttaatcttcattatcagagtac ; hoap : gacaccatggcactgctgctactatgtgttaatatgtcggggac , gacaggatcctcaggctattgaggtgacgtc ; hiphop : gacacatatggcctccattgacgagggctcgcgcgttgagcggag , gacaggatccctaaccacctgtggttcccatc ; dtl / moi : gtaccatggttatgtccctggtgccagaagcct , gtaggatcctcatttctcgatcagacttctcatctcca ; ver : gtacatatggattttaatcagagtttcgagg , caaagatctctatttatttgttgtattctgcattg .
in order to construct polycistronic expression vectors , inserts were amplified using monocistronic expression plasmids as templates with the help of the following primer pair : ( ccctctagaaataattttgtttaactttaagaaggagatata , atagatctgcggccgcactagtaactcagcttcctttcgggctttgttag ) .
the forward primer hybridizes with the ribosome binding site of the pet expression vector and the reverse primer binds the sequence before the start of the t7 transcription termination signal .
the resulting products have the following structure : xbai - ribosome binding site - cdna - spei - noti - bglii .
pet22b vector plasmid and the insert were digested by xbai and noti and ligated to construct a monocistronic expression plasmid .
then , this was digested with spei and noti , while the next insert was digested with xbai and noti enzymes .
note , that xbai and spei restriction endonucleases produce compatible ends .
the steps resulting in a bicistronic construct can be reiterated as in every subsequent ligation step the spei site on the plasmid is eliminated while the noti site remains available for cloning and a new spei site is introduced with the insert .
protein expression and tricine sds - page protein production was performed in arctic express cells , de3 ( agilent technologies , inc. ) at 18degreesc .
induction was done with 0.3 mm iptg for 48 - 60 hours .
cells were lysed by sonication using sonics vibra cell ( tm ) apparate .
each sample was sonicated for 6 cycles of 20 second active sonication with 10 sec breaks at 30 % amplitude in sonication buffer ( 25 mm tris hcl ph7.5 , 100 mm nacl , 1mm cacl2 , 1 mm mgcl2 ) .
proteins were separated on 10 % tricine - sds - page ( gel buffer ( 1m tris , 0.33m hcl , 0,1 % sds ph 8.45 ) , anode buffer ( 0.1m tris , 0.022m hcl , ph 8.9 ) , cathode buffer 10x ( 0.1m tris , 0.1m tricine , 0.1 % sds , ph8,25 ) and visualized by coomassie brilliant blue staining as described [ 47 ] .
chromatography cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation and filtration and loaded to heparin - sepharose column ( ge healthcare ) at 1ml / min flow rate .
proteins were eluted by a 0.1 to 1m nacl gradient in 20 mm tris ph7.5 in 20 column volume and 1 ml fractions were collected .
gel filtration was performed on superdex 200 10 / 300 gl column ( ge healthcare ) using filter concentrated fractions from heparin - sepharose purification .
20 mm tris ph7.5 100mm nacl was used with 0.25ml / min flow rate , 0.3ml fractions were collected .
the column was calibrated using the broad range sds - page standard ( biorad ) .
the peaks of the 116 , 66 and 45 kda proteins were marked on the related figures ( figs 4c , 5b and 6b ) .
peptide mass fingerprinting bands corresponding to specific proteins separated on tricine sds - page and stained by coomassie blue were cut and after reduction and alkylation the proteins were digested by trypsin in the gel following the protocol described [ 48 ] .
the trypsin activity was inhibited by addition of 10 % formic acid .
samples were extracted from the gel by sonication and were desalted using c18 resin .
then samples were mixed with dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1:1 ratio and loaded to the maldi target plate .
the plate was dried on room temperature .
after calibration the sample were analyzed on maldi - tof using ' rp _ 2 - 3kda - med ' parameters .
spectrum was taken and monoisotopic peaks were selected by flexanalysis software .
proteins were identified by mascot and protein prospector search in swissprot.2014.3.7 database .
supporting information s1 table the gi numbers or annotation symbols of sequences that used in this study .
* in drosophila melanogaster dtl / moi is translated from the same transcription unit as the adjacent tgs1 gene [ 49 ] .
the structure of transcriptions unit ( s ) that specifies dtl / moi and tgs1 proteins varies among drosophila species .
in order to clarify the margins of analyzed sequences further general database reference was added to annotation symbols .

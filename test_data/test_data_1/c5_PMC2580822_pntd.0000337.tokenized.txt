in china alone , an estimated 30 million people are at risk of schistosomiasis , caused by the schistosoma japonicum parasite .
disease has re - emerged in several regions that had previously attained transmission control , reinforcing the need for active surveillance .
the environmental stage of the parasite is known to exhibit high spatial and temporal variability , and current detection techniques rely on a sentinel mouse method which has serious limitations in obtaining data in both time and space .
here we describe a real - time pcr assay to quantitatively detect s. japonicum cercariae in laboratory samples and in natural water that has been spiked with known numbers of s. japonicum .
multiple primers were designed and assessed , and the best performing set , along with a taqman probe , was used to quantify s. japonicum .
the resulting assay was selective , with no amplification detected for schistosoma mansoni , schistosoma haematobium , avian schistosomes nor organisms present in non - endemic surface water samples .
repeated samples containing various concentrations of s. japonicum cercariae showed that the real - time pcr method had a strong linear correlation ( r2 = 0.921 ) with light microscopy counts , and the detection limit was below the dna equivalent of half of one cercaria .
various cercarial concentrations spiked in 1 liter of natural water followed by a filtration process produced positive detection from 93 % of samples analyzed .
the real - time pcr method performed well quantifying the relative concentrations of various spiked samples , although the absolute concentration estimates exhibited high variance across replicated samples .
overall , the method has the potential to be applied to environmental water samples to produce a rapid , reliable assay for cercarial location in endemic areas .
author summary schistosomiasis ranks second only to malaria among parasitic diseases with regard to the number of people infected and those at risk .
schistosoma japonicum is the species that causes human and animal disease in china , the philippines , and to a lesser extent , indonesia .
recent evidence of schistosomiasis re - emergence in china has reinforced the need for active disease surveillance in these areas .
schistosomiasis infection occurs through contact with water contaminated with s. japonicum cercariae , the free - living stage of the parasite shed from intermediate host snails .
current practice of detecting cercariae in the environment uses sentinel mice , a method with serious limitations in which mice are exposed to environmental water and then maintained for 6 weeks before being dissected to count worms .
the method is labor intensive and costly in terms of time and resources , making it logistically prohibitive to monitor water contact sites regularly or comprehensively .
here we develop a quantitative pcr assay to measure s. japonicum cercariae concentration in water , providing a potential method for rapid and reliable data collection in the field , potentially replacing the use of live animal models .
introduction recent evidence of schistosomiasis re - emergence has been reported in the hilly and mountainous regions of sichuan province , reinforcing the need for active disease surveillance in these areas [ 1 ] .
meanwhile , endemic areas with active transmission persist in china , with the most recent data indicating approximately 700,000 current infections .
importantly , in these areas with active transmission , infection rates have increased over the last decade [ 2 ] .
this contrasts with the significant gains that had been made reducing the prevalence of schistosomiasis in china over the past five decades , down from an estimated 11.6 million people infected at the launch of the national control program in the 1950s [ 3 ] .
evidence of re - emergence , and increased transmission in endemic areas , suggest that nationwide elimination will require increased vigilance .
meanwhile , a recent global estimate suggests 207 million people are infected with schistosome parasites , with 779 million people at risk [ 4 ] .
the species schistosoma japonicum is responsible for intestinal and hepatosplenic schistosomiasis in humans and animals in china , the philippines , and indonesia [ 5 ] , and has been associated with anaemia [ 6 ] and liver and colon cancers [ 7 ] , among other outcomes .
current tools for environmental detection of the parasite are extremely limited .
human infection occurs through contact with a free swimming larval stage of the parasite called cercariae .
in western china where disease re - emergence has been reported , cercariae are released from infected snails inhabiting irrigation ditches supplying agricultural fields .
in this environment , cercarial density is known to be spatially and temporally variable , and thus disease surveillance , along with preventative actions and risk assessments , would benefit from measurements of cercarial density in natural waters [ 8 ] - [ 10 ] .
indeed , attempting to estimate exposure - response relationships in the absence of quantitative data on the distribution and density of cercariae in the environment can lead to insufficient power to detect a response [ 10 ] .
yet current methods to quantify cercarial density in natural waters are seriously inadequate .
the traditional technique involves suspending sentinel mice in cages just below the water surface , exposing them for five hours per day for two days .
after exposure , the mice are returned to the laboratory , maintained for six weeks to allow for maturation of the parasite , then dissected to count any resulting worms in vivo [ 10 ] .
the method is labor intensive and costly in terms of time and resources , making it logistically prohibitive to monitor water contact sites regularly or comprehensively , and raises ethical issues arising from the use of live animals for routine disease surveillance .
molecular assays such as polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) have shown promise for the detection of parasites in a variety of media .
qualitative techniques have been developed to detect the presence or absence of s. japonicum and avian schistosome cercariae recovered from snail hosts [ 11 ],[ 12 ] , as well as schistosoma mansoni cercariae in water [ 13 ] .
meanwhile , real - time pcr assays have been reported for the quantification of s. japonicum and other human schistosome eggs in human and animal stool [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] , and for the quantification of s. mansoni dna [ 17 ] .
to date , no quantitative assay has been developed to detect s. japonicum cercariae in water samples .
the objective of this study is to develop a fast , reliable taqman real - time pcr assay to detect and quantify s. japonicum cercariae in field samples , with the goal of improving surveillance capabilities , as well developing better estimates of environmental risk .
materials and methods schistosomes schistosome - infected snails were obtained from the biomedical research institute funded by national institute of allergy and infectious disease ( niaid ) .
the institute provided live oncomelania hupensis ( subspecies hupensis ) snails exposed to the chinese strains of s. japonicum , biomphalaria glabrata snails exposed to the puerto rican strain of s. mansoni , and bulinus truncatus ( subspecies truncatus ) snails exposed to the egyptian strain of schistosoma haematobium .
all living snails were maintained for a period of 1 day to 3 weeks in facilities at the university of california , berkeley. o. hupensis snails were crushed on a glass slide to maximize the extraction of live s. japonicum cercariae. b. glabrata snails and b. truncatus snails were exposed to a light source to induce shedding of live s. mansoni and s. haematobium cercariae .
avian schistosome cercariae , of the putative species austrobilharzia penneri , were obtained from laboratory of prof. w.p. sousa of the university of california at berkeley .
cercariae were preserved in 95 % ethanol in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes .
light microscopy cercariae from crushed snails or shed in water were isolated using a 3 mm diameter inoculation ring ( fisher scientific , pittsburgh , usa ) .
cercariae trapped within the inoculation ring were counted under a compound microscope , followed by an inspection under a dissecting microscope for any cercariae adhered to the ring .
the quantified cercariae were transferred to 300 microl of 95 % ethanol in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube .
the procedure was repeated until a specified number of cercariae were obtained in one sample .
all samples were stored at - 20degreesc until dna was extracted from the cercariae .
extraction of genomic dna from schistosomes samples of quantified cercariae preserved in 95 % ethanol were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 10 minutes , after which the supernatant was discarded .
the samples were air dried before genomic dna ( gdna ) extraction was performed using a dneasy tissue kit ( qiagen , ca , usa ) following the manufacturer 's instruction .
schistosome gdna was eluted with 100 microl of ae buffer from the dneasy column , and stored at - 20degreesc until analyzed by quantitative pcr ( qpcr ) .
design of primers and probe three primer sets were designed targeting the sjr2 retrotransposon [ 11 ] , the putative deoxyribodipyrimidine photo - lyase [ 18 ] , and the merlin transposon [ 19 ] ( table 1 ) .
the three primer sets were used in conventional pcr and sybr green qpcr ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , usa ) , a reagent mix containing a specific dye for quantification , for the detection of s. japonicum cercarial dna .
the primer set designed from the putative deoxyribodipyrimidine photo - lyase ( pl ) sequence provided the highest correlation between counted concentration of cercariae and real - time pcr estimation , and was thus selected for further development using the taqman system .

the probe was designed with 5 ' terminal reporter dye fam ( 6 - carboxyfluorescein ) and 3 ' terminal quencher dye tamra .
the specificity of primers and probe were tested using a blast search against the genbank database to assess potential cross hybridization with other schistosome species and other non - target organisms .
real - time pcr conditions real - time quantitative pcr was performed in microamp optical 96 - well reaction plates using steponeplus real - time pcr systems ( v. 2.0 , applied biosystems ) .
primer concentrations were optimized by testing various annealing temperatures ( 57degreesc , 59degreesc , 60degreesc , 61degreesc , 63degreesc ) , and various concentrations of magnesium chloride ( 0 nm , 250 nm , 500 nm , 750 nm ) .
all real - time pcr assays were run in a total reaction volume of 25 microl comprised 1xtaqman universal pcr master mix with amperase ( applied biosystems ) , 500 nm of both forward and reverse primers ( integrated dna technologies , coralville , ia , usa ) , 240 nm taqman probe ( applied biosystems ) and 2 microl of target dna solution .
the real - time pcr cycling parameters were set as follows : initial 2 minutes at 50degreesc for optimal ung enzyme activity followed by 95degreesc for 10 minutes to activate amplitaq gold enzyme , then 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95degreesc and 1 minute at 60degreesc .
standards were prepared from ten - fold serial dilutions of extracted dna solution from samples containing 500 microscopy counted s. japonicum cercariae .
negative controls without template were run on each plate using nuclease - free water .
species specificity of the assay was tested against two other human schistosomes , s. mansoni and s. haematobium ; and one avian schistosome , a. penneri .
ten to twenty cercariae of the two schistosome species were counted , gdna was extracted ( as above ) and was subsequently assayed .
all standards , samples and controls were carried out in triplicate .
unknown sample concentrations were calculated from a standard curve of samples of known concentration run on the same plate .
a sample was considered positive when more than one out of three reactions were positive .
some real - time pcr products were assayed by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis stained by ethidium bromide to confirm the expected size of the amplicons .
filtration of spiked water samples and dna extraction samples spiked with live cercariae were prepared for filtration using three different water sources : first , deionized water , second , phosphate buffered saline ( 1x ) , and third using water taken directly from the strawberry creek canyon on the campus of university of california , berkeley .
this third water source was included to represent environmental water and mimics natural water sources in schistosomiasis endemic sites .
each one liter water sample was spiked with a specific number of s. japonicum cercariae counted using light microscopy .
subsequently , samples were filtered through a whatman nuclepore membrane filter ( 8.0 microm pore size , 47 mm diameter , tracked - etched nuclepore membrane ; fisher scientific , pittsburgh , usa ) .
each sample flask was rinsed with deionized water five times and the rinse water was added to the filter .
the filter membrane was folded four times using sterilized forceps , transferred to a 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube , and stored at - 20degreesc until dna extraction .
several spiked water samples ( n = 4 ) were treated with bead beating as part of dna extraction .
360 microl buffer atl ( dneasy tissue kit ; qiagen , ca , usa ) , and beads ( 0.5 g , 0.1 mm diameter ; biospec products , bartlesville , usa ) were added to the folded filter membrane .
contents were homogenized for 1 minute at 500 g in a mini - bead beater ( biospec products , bartlesville , usa ) .
samples treated with bead beating were later compared with samples without bead beating .
dna was extracted using a modified dneasy tissue kit protocol ( qiagen , ca , usa ) .
samples were lysed in twice the suggested volume of buffer atl and proteinase k to allow for sufficient contact with the filter ; the lysates were incubated for two hours with vortexing at 15 minute intervals to ensure contents were homogenized .
samples were run through a single column twice with centrifugation .
purified dna was eluted once with 100 microl buffer ae in the final step .
strawberry creek canyon stream water without spiked cercariae was prepared and assayed as a negative control in parallel with the spiked samples .
dna extracted from samples spiked in the stream water was processed by filtration and diluted ten - fold in nuclease - free water to test for the potential presence of real - time pcr inhibitors .
results real - time pcr specificity and optimization a blast search of the chosen primer and probe sequence resulted in a single hit of the target sequence in s. japonicum , suggesting specificity of the target .
moreover , no amplification was observed from gdna extracted from s. mansoni , s. haematobium , a. penneri cercariae , nor from dna extracted from filtered stream water .
visualization of real - time pcr products on agarose gel confirmed the amplification of the specific template of expected size ( 85 bp ; data not shown ) .
results of real - time pcr optimization using three concentrations of magnesium chloride , five annealing temperatures , and two primer concentrations showed similar results for 500 nm and 900 nm primer concentrations , and an optimal annealing temperature of 60degreesc ( table 2 ) .
additional magnesium chloride reduced sensitivity ( data not shown ) .
reactions using optimized cycling parameters generated an average amplification efficiency of 91 % .
standard curves generated from 10 - fold serial dilutions of gdna extracted from 500 cercariae were linear over 3 orders of magnitude .
the average slope of standard curves was - 3.58 , with a standard deviation of 0.27 .
the real - time pcr detection limit was dna equivalent to half of one cercaria , with a mean ct ( cycle threshold ) value of 36.7 .

moreover , a statistically significant , positive linear correlation was observed between the real - time pcr estimated number and the light microscopy counts when analyzed by linear regression ( figure 1 ; r2 = 0.912 , slope = 0.992 , 95 % ci = 0.859 - 1.125 ) .
mean real - time pcr readings generally agreed with the cercarial numbers as determined by light microscopy , although a range of values was observed when replicates of the same concentration of cercariae were analyzed ( table 3 ) .
the results were reproducible when the real - time pcr was carried out on the same gdna samples on different days ( data not shown ) .

all samples were thus processed by direct dna extraction from membranes without bead beating .
all spiked deionized water and pbs samples resulted in positive detection ( 100 % , n = 16 ) ( table 4 ) .
cercarial concentration as low as one cercaria per liter of stream water was tested in duplicate with filtration , with one of the replicates detected .
overall , positive results were obtained in 93 % of all filtered samples spiked with cercariae ( n = 32 ) and analyzed by real - time pcr ( table 4 ) .
samples spiked with higher numbers of cercariae (> 10 cercariae ) had a higher probability of being detected after filtration .
the findings with spiked stream water suggested the presence of environmental inhibitors .
undetectable amplification signals were observed in undiluted samples , but subsequent dilutions produced detectable amplification ( data not shown ) .
dna dilutions of 2 - fold , 10 - fold and 100 - fold in stream water samples reduced inhibition effects .
a comparison across different concentrations of spiked cercariae suggested optimal detection at 10 - fold dilution .
subsequently , samples of spiked stream water were analyzed at this dilution .

in general , high variability was observed in spiked samples with filtration when compared to direct dna extraction of cercariae without filtration ( table 5 ) .
visualization of real - time pcr products on ethidium bromide stained agarose gels suggested that there were no other amplifications ( data not shown ) .
repeated assays of negative controls did not amplify , which was further confirmed by analysis of the real - time pcr products on agarose gel .

multiple target sequences were assessed , and a taqman real - time pcr assay was designed and applied to cercariae recovered from o. hupensis snails , and from spiked water samples .
results demonstrated the specificity of the target sequence , a putative deoxyribodipyrimidine photo - lyase , which amplified s. japonicum , but not other closely related human schistosomes , nor organisms present in environmental water samples drawn from a non - endemic area .
the authors acknowledge the limitations of the sensitivity assessments available in this study , including environmental samples drawn from a non - endemic area and blast searches of sequence databases where trematode sequences are often poorly represented .
other pcr - based molecular assays developed to detect human schistosomes were generally species specific when tested against related trematodes [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 20 ] - [ 24 ] .
however , as with previous assays , the authors of the current work remain cautious , recommending additional field testing for cross - hybridization with other schistosome species to confirm specificity of the assay presented here [ 25 ] .
for a robust and quantitative assay , we selected a target sequence with a fixed number of copies from a highly conserved region in the s. japonicum genome .
the target sequence encodes a putative deoxyribodipyrimidine photo - lyase which is expressed only in living cercariae [ 18 ] .
the selective expression of this protein could be extremely valuable for the future development of a reverse transcriptase pcr method to detect the level of mrna , thus allowing for the quantification of viable cercariae .
taking advantage of the target developed in this project , future efforts on a reverse transcriptase pcr method could offer the added benefit of a quantitative technique that accounts for viability , which would be especially valuable for improving risk assessments [ 26 ] .
conventional pcr methods developed to detect cercariae have usually targeted highly repeated sequences to enhance the assay 's sensitivity , demonstrating in several cases the capability to detect a single cercaria [ 11 ],[ 12 ],[ 23 ] .
in this study , we demonstrated sensitive detection using a non - abundant target sequence , capable of detecting one cercaria in replicated samples , as well as the dna equivalent of half a cercaria .
quantification is a major step forward in s. japonicum detection , since current methods using mouse bioassays are minimally quantitative , and prior pcr methods have allowed for qualitative detection only .
the assay presented here showed a significant association between ct values and the concentration of cercarial dna , both from standards derived by serial dilution , and from individual counted samples .
this strong association suggests the standards provided a reliable quantitative estimation of individual samples , derived from relative ct values .
the variance in real - time pcr quantification within replicates of the same cercarial number could be due in part to error in light microscopy quantification .
larger errors in high concentration samples could be expected because of the possibility of multiple miscounts in a single concentrated sample .
in the spiked water samples processed with a filtration step , high variability was observed when compared with samples processed without filtration .
samples spiked with <= 10 cercariae had a lower probability of being detected ( 83 % compared to samples > 10 cercariae , n = 12 ) .
while dna losses in the filtration and dna extraction steps are expected , a large variance was observed in real - time pcr estimates , rather than a simple underestimation .
thus , the recovery efficiency in the filtration process could not be determined .
subsequent testing may include multiple replicates of samples with a larger range to determine the sampling variability .
the variance observed could be attributed to inhibitors present in environmental water samples ; indeed , inhibition effects were observed in the stream water .
it has been reported that at different concentrations , the same compound can act as both attenuator and facilitator in the same system [ 27 ] .
in our environmental samples , the presence of excessive amounts of non - target dna and humic compounds might affect several reaction steps in real - time pcr .
to reduce the problem of inhibition , studies on other parasites in environmental samples have used bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) [ 28 ] - [ 31 ] .
further refinement of the assay presented here might explore bsa , among other approaches , to reduce inhibitory effects .
real - time pcr techniques have been used to detect eggs in stool samples for several schistosome species [ 14 ] - [ 16 ] , providing a diagnostic tool for clinical applications .
here , we have demonstrated the promising performance of a similar technique applied to the quantification of s. japonicum cercariae in natural water samples , useful for surveillance , risk assessments and intervention planning .
to adapt the method to field sampling , the assay should be assessed in parallel with mouse bioassays which , despite their limitations , remain the gold standard detection technique in endemic areas [ 11 ] .
such a field trial could reveal potential limitations of the qpcr assay in comparison to the sentinel animal assay .
for example , the sentinel mouse assay selectively detects viable cercariae , and could theoretically take advantage of cercarial host - seeking behavior to detect very low concentrations of cercariae , or cercariae in highly turbid environments .
indeed , given the typical turbidity of water in endemic environments in western china , sedimentation prior to filtration may be required to reduce loading of filter membranes .
moreover , as cercarial concentration may be lower than 1 cercaria per liter of water in endemic areas , an effective water sampling technique capable of skimming surface water for cercariae may be necessary in areas of low cercarial concentration , taking advantage of the surface seeking behavior of cercariae [ 32 ] .
additional sampling strategies such as filtration or centrifugation may be necessary in future development of the method application .
the assay presented here can serve as the foundation for a rapid technique for the analysis of environmental samples , and it has the potential to improve the temporal and spatial resolution of cercarial density measurements .

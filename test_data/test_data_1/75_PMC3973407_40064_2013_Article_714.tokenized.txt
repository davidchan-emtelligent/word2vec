soil salt crusts are special layers at soil surface which are widely distributed in the trim desert highway shelterbelt under drip - irrigation with high salinity groundwater .
in order to reveal annual variation of their chemical characteristics , soil salt crusts in shelterbelt of different ages in hinterland of the taklimakan desert were sampled .
som , total salt , inions and ph were analyzed .
following results were obtained .
som of salt crusts increased with the shelterbelt ages , but increasing trend became lower gradually .
total salt , ions , and ph of salt crusts reduced gradually with the shelterbelt ages .
total salt of salt crusts in shelterbelt of different ages was much higher than shifting sandy land .
ions were higher than shifting sandy land , cl - , na + , and so42 - increased more obvious , then mg2 + , k + , ca2 + and hco3 - , co32 - was little and nearly had no change .
ph was all alkaline , ph of salt crusts in shelterbelt of 11 years was even lower than shifting sandy land .
we can include that the quality of shallow soil ( 0 ~ 30 cm ) in the trim desert highway shelterbelt becomes better gradually .
chemical characteristics soil salt crusts saline groundwater drip - irrigation trim desert highway shelterbelt issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2013 introduction soil crusts are widely distributed in land surface , especially prevalent in arid and semiarid regions [ 1 ] , and are mainly divided into physical crusts and biological crusts [ 2 ] .
as we know , physical soil crusts are a thin compacted layers formed at the soil surface by the combined action of raindrop impacting , splashing and physicochemical dispersion of the finer particulate matter blocking the soil porosities , or by the sedimentation action of finer particles carried by water current or still water on the soil surfaces [ 3 ] .
biological soil crusts commonly result from the development of communities of micro - organisms on soil surface [ 4 - 6 ] .
soil salt crusts are special layers at the soil surface which are mainly formed by soluble salt crystallizing soil particles .
soil salt crusts are different from physical crusts or biological crusts ; some scholar thought that it should be classified as chemical crusts individually in the soil crusts classification system [ 7 ] .
salt crusts have high salt content , higher hardness and strong resistance to wind erosion [ 8 , 9 ] .
under natural conditions at the shallow groundwater level regions , water and soluble salt move upwards to soil surface because of soil capillarity action , water evaporates and loses , but the salt accumulates and crystals at the soil surface and forms soil salt crusts .
some scholars made related research on soil salt crusts formed under natural conditions [ 8 , 9 ] , but little studies on soil salt crusts formed under salinity water irrigation were reported [ 7 , 10 ] , and only confined to the relationship between soil salt crusts distribution and irrigation schedule .
mobile dunes on both sides of the highway are fixed gradually after the construction of the trim desert highway shelterbelt .
as a result of drip - irrigation with local high salinity groundwater ( 2.8 ~ 29.7 g / l ) , soil salt crusts develop extensively in the shelterbelt [ 7 , 10 ] .
under salinity water drip - irrigation , salt accumulates at soil surface , and salt content of distribution layers of trees roots is lower , so salt - injuries do n't happen .
but , unexpected precipitations can leach salt of soil salt crusts downwards , if soil salt contents of distribution layers of roots exceeds trees' salt - tolerance threshold , plants physiological drought might happen , even results in plants death .
unexpected strong precipitations happened in the summer of 2003 & 2005 , which caused a lot calligonum l. died and caused certain bad influence on protection of the shelterbelt .
the objective of this study was to reveal the chemical characteristics of soil salt crusts under high salinity groundwater drip - irrigation , and this study has important practical application value and theoretical meaning for analyzing and resolving salt - injuries of precipitations to the shelterbelt and promoting sustainable development of the shelterbelt .
materials and methods the study area the study was conducted at the taklimakan desert research station / tazhong botanical garden , chinese academy of sciences , in the hinterland of the taklimakan desert in xinjiang uighur autonomous region ( approximately 39 ( o ) 01 ' n , 83 ( o ) 36 ' e , 1 100 m a.s.l . )
( figure 1 ) .
the climatic characteristics of study area are as follows : ( 1 ) the annual mean air temperature is 12.4degreesc , with december the coldest month averaging - 8.1degreesc , july the warmest month averaging 28.2degreesc ; ( 2 ) the climate is extremely arid , annual average precipitation is approximately 24.6 mm , annual average relative humidity is 29.4 % , number of low humidity days (<= 30 %) is 246.6 days , and annual mean potential evaporation is 3 638.6 mm .
( 3 ) blown sand disasters are serious , the annual average wind speed is 2.5 m / s , maximum instantaneous wind speed is 20.0 m / s , and the sand - shifting wind occurs more than 130 days per year .
figure 1 map showing the study area .
since 1997 , to protect the security of the trim desert highway , the shelterbelt ecological system was experimentally established and succeeded in the hinterland of the taklimakan desert on both sides of the highway , and was popularized along the trim desert highway in 2005 .
the species are mainly highly stress - resistant shrubs with excellent windbreak and sand fixation properties , such as calligonum l. , tamarix l. , haloxylon bunge and etc .
all of the shelterbelt trees are drip - irrigated with regional high salinity groundwater , and soil salt crusts are formed and widely distributed in it [ 7 ] .
in the hinterland of taklimakan desert , natural vegetation is rare without a few drought - resistant shrubs ( tamarix ramosissima and calligonum leucocladum ) growing in lowlands between dune - chains , the coverage is very low ; ground landscape is mainly high mobile dunes and large complex dune chains .
the soil is mainly shifting aeolian sandy soil which has little nutrients , the salt content is 1.26 ~ 1.63 g / kg and ph is 8 ~ 9 ( table 1 ) .
the depth of groundwater at lowlands between dune - chains is 3 ~ 5 m , the mineralization is 4.0 ~ 4.8 g / l , ions composition are mainly cl - , so42 - , na + and k + .
the water quality profile is shown in table 2 .

in late march 2007 , soil salt crusts were sampled in the shelterbelt planted for 11 years , 8 years , 5 years , and 2 years in the hinterland of the taklimakan desert , meanwhile , shifting aeolian sandy soils were collected as checks .
to obtain organic matter contents , total salt contents , eight ions contents and ph , all samples were air - dried , rushed and passed through 2.0 mm sieve before analysis .
som was determined by potassium dichromate method ; total salt was determined by gravimetric analysis ; ca2 + and mg2 + were determined by edta volumetric method ; k + and na + were determined by flame photometry ; so42 - was determined by barium sulfate turbidity ; cl - was determined by silver nitrate titration ; co32 - and hco3 - were determined by neutralization titration ; ph ( soil : water = 5:1 ) was determined by glass - electrodes method [ 11 ] .
results som analysis it is known that som can decrease soil bulk density , increase soil porosity , improve soil structure and aeration , improve soil infiltration , soil water and heat conditions , create better conditions for plants growth and development .
it is known from figure 2 that som of soil salt crusts increased with forest ages in the shelterbelt drip - irrigated with salinity groundwater .
the analysis results showed that the som of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt irrigated for 11 years , eight years , five years and two years increased by 18.15 times , 38.49 times , 47.21 times and 50.33 times compared with shifting sandy land .
but , it still can be seen from figure 2 that the increasing trend weakened gradually .
at study area , species of shelterbelt are mainly deciduous shrubs , such as calligonum l. , tamarix l. and haloxylon bunge , etc .
litters are accumulated in the shelterbelt , and the increase of som is closely related to continuous accumulation and decomposition of litters [ 12 , 13 ] .
figure 2 som analysis of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt of different age .
total salt analysis soluble salt content in soil is one important index of judging the degree of salinization , it is one of important limiting factors to plant growth .
salt - injury or alkali - injury might be happened to plants if soil salt content is excessively high [ 14 , 15 ] .
mineralization of irrigation water in study area is 4.04 g / l. figure 3 showed that salt contents of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt with salinity water drip - irrigation change much , and was much higher than shifting sandy land , but reduced gradually with the forest ages .
this conclusion is consistent to the conclusions of zhou 's and xu 's [ 16 , 17 ] .
salt contents of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt irrigated for two years , five years , eight years and 11 years increased 317.15 times , 111.19 times , 108.96 times and 95.65 times than shifting sandy land .
salt contents of soil salt crusts reduced gradually with shelterbelt irrigation years , which are contributed to continuous salt leaching of drip - irrigation [ 18 ] .
figure 3 analysis of total salt of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt of different age .
ions composition analysis under high salinity groundwater irrigation , salt is brought into soil with irrigation water ; ions composition and contents of the soil are affected .
in shifting sandy land , soil anions are mainly cl - and hco3 - , a spot of so42 - and little co32 - ; cationics are mainly na + and ca2 + , a spot of mg2 + and k + ( table 1 ) .
it can be inferred from figure 4 that under salinity groundwater drip - irrigation , ions contents of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt irrigated for different years increased at different degree compared with shifting sandy land , but reduced gradually with the shelterbelt ages , the trend was consistent with total salt contents of salt crusts .
so42 - content of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt irrigated for different years ( two years , five years , eight years and 11 years ) increased 157 ~ 477 times than shifting sandy land ; cl - increased 7 ~ 27 times ; hco3 - increased 0.31 ~ 0.73 times which increased slightly ; co32 - content was very few , and nearly had no difference with shifting sandy land ; mg2 + increased 43 ~ 164 times ; na + increased 9 ~ 36 times ; ca2 + increased 2.2 ~ 5.6 times ; and k + increased 5.5 ~ 11.1 times .
it can be inferred from analysis results that cl - , na + and so42 - increased most obvious ; then mg2 + , k + , ca2 + and hco3 - ; co32 - content was very few and nearly had no change .
ions composition of soil salt crusts was accordant with irrigation water ( table 2 ) .
figure 4 analysis of ions contents of salt crusts in shelterbelts of different age .
4 ph analysis the increase of salt content may result in soil salinization or alkalization .
sodium salt , calcium salt and magnesium salt , formed by soil ions will restrict plants growth and development at different degrees , or even lead to plants death when serious [ 15 ] .
ph is one of important parameters of soil chemical characteristics , and is one of important indexes of judging soil salinization or alkalization .
it can be inferred from the analysis results in table 3 that ph of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt of different ages ( 2 years , 5 years , 8 years and 11 years ) were all alkaline , and decreased gradually with shelterbelt ages .
this trend was consistent with the change of total salt contents and ions composition of soil salt crusts , ph of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt of 11 years was even lower than shifting sandy land .

increment amounts of cl - , na + and so42 - were largest , then mg2 + , k + , ca2 + and hco3 - , the content of co32 - was very less and nearly has no change .
this change was consistent to ions composition of irrigation water ; ( 4 ) ph of soil salt crusts in shelterbelt of different ages was all alkaline , but decreased with shelterbelt ages ; ph of salt crusts in shelterbelt of 11 years was even lower than shifting sandy land .
under irrigation with salinity groundwater , salt crusts form at the soil surface which has impact structure and certain thickness .
we discovered that it can greatly improve soil resistance to wind erosion and can inhibit soil evaporation effectively .
in arid area , soil moisture is one of main limiting factors affecting vegetation growth , development and distribution .
it rains very less and evaporates strong in the extreme drought taklimakan desert region ; excessive evaporation causes a large amount of irrigation water loss ineffectively , which results in harmful effect on growth and development of plants .
so the salt crusts can play a role on saving the limited water resource for irrigation .
salt crusts are at the soil surface , and commonly do n't influence normal growth and development of the shelterbelt .
but unexpected strong precipitations can leach salt of salt crusts downwards , plants normal growth will be affected even die if the leaching depth arrives at main distribution layers of plants roots [ 19 ] .
therefore , arrangement for irrigation system reasonably and preventing the occurrence of salt - injuries is one of the issues to maintain the stability of the desert highway shelterbelt .
research on chemical characteristics of soil salt crusts under salinity groundwater drip - irrigation not only has important practical application value and theoretical value in analyzing and solving precipitation salt - injuries on shelterbelt , promoting the sustainable development of the shelterbelt , but also have reference meaning in preventing the occurrence of regional salinization and guiding rational use of water resource in salinity water irrigation region .
in the research field of salt crusts formation , evolution process and mechanism , and their role in ecosystems are not systematic enough [ 20 ] .
salt crusts formation and development process is affected by irrigation water quality , groundwater depth , soil texture , vegetation , climate conditions , etc ; soil eco - hydrological process under the influence of salt crusts and their effect on plants growth and development , etc , these aspects are worthy of further research and discussion .

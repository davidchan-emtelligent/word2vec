a tetrameric protein of therapeutic importance , escherichia coli l - asparaginase - ii was expressed in escherichia coli as inclusion bodies ( ibs ) .
asparaginase ibs were solubilized using low concentration of urea and refolded into active tetrameric protein using pulsatile dilution method .
refolded asparaginase was purified in two steps by ion - exchange and gel filtration chromatographic techniques .
the recovery of bioactive asparaginase from ibs was around 50 % .
the melting temperature ( tm ) of the purified asparaginase was found to be 64degreesc .
the specific activity of refolded , purified asparaginase was found to be comparable to the commercial asparaginase ( 190 iu / mg ) .
enzymatic activity of the refolded asparaginase was high even at four molar urea solutions , where the ib aggregates are completely solubilized. from the comparison of chemical denaturation data and activity at different concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride , it was observed that dissociation of monomeric units precedes the complete loss of helical secondary structures .
protection of the existing native - like protein structure during solubilization of ib aggregates with 4 m urea improved the propensity of monomer units to form oligomeric structure .
our mild solubilization technique retaining native - like structures , improved recovery of asparaginase in bioactive tetrameric form .
l - asparaginase - ii escherichia coli ibs mild solubilization refolding introduction most of the times , expression of recombinant proteins in escherichia coli leads to the formation of insoluble aggregates known as ibs ( hartley and kane , 1988 ; fahnert et al. , 2004 ) .
recovery of active protein from ib aggregates remains to be a cumbersome task and requires standardization of solubilization and refolding methods ( de bernardez et al. , 1999 ; burgess , 2009 ) .
the major hurdle associated with purification of proteins from ibs is the sub - optimal refolding of recombinant proteins into native conformation ( rudolph and lilie , 1996 ; panda , 2003 ; vallejo and rinas , 2004 ) .
poor refolding is often associated to high concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride ( gdmcl ) used to solubilize the ib proteins .
at higher concentrations , chaotropes such as urea and gdmcl completely denature the proteins and increases its propensity to aggregate during refolding resulting in low recovery of bioactive protein from ibs .
ib proteins are reported to have structure and functional activities ( umetsu et al. , 2004 ; ventura and villaverde , 2006 ; peternel and komel , 2011 ) .
these active ibs can be isolated from bacterial cells using different methods like homogenization , enzymatic lysis , and sonication where homogenization was observed to be most appropriate ( peternel and komel , 2010 ) .
it will be ideal to protect these secondary protein structures during ib solubilization process .
mild solubilization of ib aggregates protects the existing native - like protein structure of ib proteins and helps in its improved recovery into bioactive form singh and panda ( 2005 ) .
in a few cases , solubilization with mild denaturing conditions has been proved to be more efficient for the recovery of bioactive protein from the ibs ( panda , 2003 ; singh et al. , 2012 ; upadhyay et al. , 2012 ) .
refolding yield of active oligomeric proteins from ibs is even lower ( scrofani et al. , 2000 ; karumuri et al. , 2007 ; garrido et al. , 2011 ) .
formation of active monomer and its association is a prerequisite for refolding into fully active oligomeric proteins .
often it is hindered due to complete unfolding of proteins in ibs into random coil structure while using high concentration of chaotropes .
solubilized protein molecules have propensity to form intermolecular aggregates leading to massive aggregation during refolding .
it is thus essential to protect the secondary helical structure of ib proteins so that it reduces intermolecular aggregation between monomers .
it can be achieved by adopting mild solubilization process for solubilization of ibs .
chemical denaturation studies provide information about the solubility profile of ib aggregates .
based on this information , ibs can be solubilized at low denaturation concentration while protecting the existing native - like secondary protein structure .
refolding of protein from monomers having secondary structural element will promote monomer association leading to the formation of active oligomeric protein and thus will improve the overall recovery of bioactive protein from ibs .
even though mild solubilization processes have been used to recover bioactive protein from ibs , there is very little information available on the refolding of oligomeric proteins into bioactive form .
bacterial asparaginases from escherichia coli and erwinia chrysanthemi have been extensively used as drugs for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( muller and boos , 1998 ; graham , 2003 ; verma et al. , 2007 ) .
l - asparaginases ( ec 3.5.1.1 ) catalyze the hydrolysis of l - asparagine to l - aspartic acid and ammonia .
all asparaginases consist of four identical subunits a , b , c , and d and exist in homo - tetrameric form ( kozak et al. , 2002 ) having masses in the range of 140 - 150 kda ( aung et al. , 2000 ) .
one subunit consists of two alpha / beta domains that are connected by linking sequence .
interaction between n and c - terminal domain of adjacent monomers forms each active site .
therefore , the asparaginase tetramer can be treated as dimer of dimers because active site is either created by subunits a and c or b and d. the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer , and the dimers lack enzyme activity ( swain et al. , 1993 ) .
l - asparaginase contains one tryptophan molecule at 66 positions in each monomer .
it consists of four active sites formed at the interfaces of n and c - terminal domains of two interacting monomers ( swain et al. , 1993 ) .
l - asparaginase has been reported to be produced using recombinant e. coli ( khushoo et al. , 2004 ; oza et al. , 2011 ) , p. pastoris ( ferrara et al. , 2010 ) and from other microorganisms ( mahajan et al. , 2012 ) .
most of the times , the enzymes is produced in soluble form and purified with 40 - 60 % recovery .
there are no reports till date on solubilization and refolding of l - asparaginase from ibs into bioactive tetrameric form .
in this work , e. coli l - asparaginase ii was expressed in e. coli cells as ibs and used as a model system to refold into bioactive tetrameric form .
attempts were made to solubilize the ibs of asparaginase in mild denaturing conditions .
solubilized proteins were then refolded and purified into active oligomeric form .
role of structural integrity between monomers and their importance in regulation of enzyme activity and stability was monitored by chemical , ph , temperature and organic solvent based denaturation methods .
the results are of indication that mild solubilization followed by pulsatile refolding leads to improved recovery of bioactive multimeric l - asparaginase from ibs of e. coli .

chemical denaturation of asparaginase by urea and gdmcl chemical denaturation of asparaginase was probed by fluorescence spectroscopy in the presence of different concentrations of urea and gdmcl .
the protein was excited at 280 nm , and emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. fluorescence spectra of asparaginase in the presence of different concentrations of urea and gdmcl are presented in figures 4a,b. native asparaginase showed emission maximum at 319 nm. in the presence of 6 m urea or 2 m gdmcl , complete denaturation of the protein was observed with emission maximum at 356 nm that is a characteristic feature of solvent - exposed tryptophan residues in polar environment .
fluorescence intensity was reduced with the increase in urea concentration ( up to 4 m ) without any significant shift in emission maxima .
however , there was a 36 nm red shift in emission maximum of asparaginase at higher than 4 m urea concentrations .
similar denaturation behavior was observed in the presence of gdmcl .
however , being a stronger denaturant , loss of fluorescence intensity and red shift in emission maximum occurred at 1.2 m concentration of gdmcl .
as asparaginase has characteristic emission maxima wavelength in native and denatured states , denaturation curves of asparaginase were analyzed as ratios of fluorescence intensities at 319 / 356 nm at different concentrations of urea and gdmcl .
asparaginase showed cooperative denaturation profile in urea and gdmcl ( figures 4c,d ) .
it can be concluded that asparaginase is more susceptible to gdmcl denaturation in comparison to urea .
this conclusion was further supported by the denaturation profiles of asparaginase in presence of gdmcl observed with circular dichroism ( cd ) spectroscopy ( figure 5 ) .

in pre - and post - transition range of thermal denaturation , scans were performed at 5degreesc intervals and 1degreesc intervals within the transition range .
cd 222 nm signals were plotted against temperature ( figure 7b ) .
thermal denaturation curves showed the loss of cd signal at start of 57degreesc and gradually decreased to the lowest value at 70degreesc .
further increase in temperature beyond 70degreesc had no significant effect on cd 222 nm signal .

discussion refolding yield of bioactive proteins from ibs of e. coli are in general very low and contribute toward a major cost for production of recombinant proteins ( datar et al. , 1993 ) .
however , expression of protein as ibs has the advantages of very high level of protein expression and resistance to protease attack .
thus , ib expression helps in purifying the denatured protein with a lower number of operating steps .
if suitable high throughput refolding procedure can be developed for a particular protein , ib formation will be very helpful in the production of recombinant protein .
such an approach will be more beneficial for oligomeric proteins where the refolding yields are even lower .
strategy used to recover bioactive protein from ibs mainly involves four steps : isolation of ibs from e. coli cells ; solubilization of the ib aggregates ; refolding and purification of the solubilized protein .
among these steps , solubilization of the protein aggregates and refolding of the solubilized protein are the most crucial steps and need careful attention for high recovery of protein .
aggregation leading to low recovery of the recombinant protein occurs due to the use of sub - optimal refolding procedure .
it is expected that mild solubilization of the ib aggregates using low concentration of denaturants followed by pulsatile refolding of the solubilized protein would be an ideal approach for maximal recovery of bioactive proteins from the ibs .
in this study , e. coli l - asparaginase ii was expressed as ib aggregates in e. coli , purified by detergent washing and solubilized using only 4 molar urea solution .
maximum of 10 - 11 mg / ml of the protein could be solubilized at 4 m urea solution .
the solubilized protein was subsequently refolded into native tetrameric form using pulsatile dilution method .
around 50 % of ib protein could be refolded into bioactive tetrameric protein using the mild solubilization procedure .
the production data are comparable to that reported for soluble expression using lb medium in shaker - flask culture ( khushoo et al. , 2004 ) .
it is expected that if such expression system are optimized using high cell density fermentation followed by the present ib refolding process , the volumetric productivities will be even better .
crystal structure of e. coli asparaginase shows that the active site is present between subunits of intimate dimer formed by interaction of n - terminal domain of one subunit with c - terminal domain of the other subunit .
each dimer has two active sites , but only tetramer shows the activity .
apart from this , 0.1 m arginine in refolding buffer also promoted the formation of tetramer and reduced the extent of protein aggregation .
it showed that the arginine not only helped in preventing aggregation during refolding but also promoted the formation of correctly folded subunits for proper association into tetrameric form .
fluorescence spectrum of the refolded asparaginase was similar to that of native asparaginase indicating the formation of proper quaternary structure of the recombinant asparaginase after refolding .
according to the crystal structure of asparaginase , alpha - helices are predominantly present on the surface of tetramer .
active site of asparaginase is present on the interface of subunits with tryptophan residues at the core of n - terminal domains of monomers near the active site .
the cooperative fluorescence and activity profile and biphasic nature of cd spectra in the presence of different concentrations of gdmcl could be possible if , during the denaturation , dissociation of subunits precedes the complete loss of secondary structures into monomers .
protecting the existing secondary structure element of the protein during solubilization thus favors the association monomer into oligomeric form and results in the formation of tetrameric bioactive protein .
conclusions understanding the solubilization profile of ib aggregates at different denaturation concentration helped in designing a mild solubilization procedure .
such a mild process protected the existing native - like protein structure and thus helped in improved recovery of bioactive protein during refolding .
solubilized asparaginase from the ibs was refolded into tetrameric form having high specific enzymatic activity by optimization of solubilization and refolding conditions .
purified asparaginase was found to be active .
kinetic parameters of the enzyme were determined .
purified asparaginase was characterized for its denaturation profiles in the presence of urea and gdmcl .
thermal denaturation of the purified asparaginase was also studied , and the tm was determined to be about 64degreesc .
mild solubilization of ib protein is thus the key requirements in high throughput recovery of ib proteins into bioactive form .
this concept thus can be used for recovery of bioactive oligomeric proteins from the ibs of e. coli .

introduction staging and follow - up of oncologic patients rely widely on radiologic imaging modalities' accuracy that can in turn directly influence therapeutic decisions .
18fdg - pet / ct scan benefits from the combination of functional and structural information providing a highly superior diagnostic accuracy and has been widely used in the detection of distant metastases [ 1 ] .
as the liver is one of the commonest sites of metastasis , in particular for the tumors arising from the colon and rectum , liver imaging presents a common challenge in oncological evaluation by pet / ct. the practice of pet / ct in patients with colorectal cancer presented with hepatic metastases has been shown to improve therapeutic planning by detecting intrahepatic and extrahepatic sites of the disease .
liver metastases from colorectal cancer represent approximately 50 % of the recurrences , and surgical resection is the only potentially curative therapy in these patients .
in contrary , pet / ct may eliminate ineffective surgery by demonstrating additionally extrahepatic metastases with the inoperable disease in 11 - 32 % of patients .
this approach alters the therapeutic management to a more systemic approach with chemotherapy [ 2 ] .
despite pet / ct being a highly accurate imaging method , it is still susceptible to artifacts and pitfalls that compromise its efficiency [ 3 ] .
herein we present the case of a 48 - year - old female patient with metastatic colorectal cancer , who was subjected to an avertable hepatic tumor resection following misleading findings in pet / ct scan , throughout her follow up. she underwent surgical excision of the suspicious tumor , which proved to be granulomatous tissue , secondary to inflammation with no metastases in the pathology report .
case presentation a 48 - year - old female patient with a past medical history of left colectomy and metastasectomy in liver segments vii and iii , presented after one year of follow - up with a suspicious lesion in the resection margin of segment vii on a ct scan as can be seen in figure 1 .
figure 1 axial contrast - enhanced ct shows a hypodense lesion at metastasectomy site .
the lesion enhances after contrast administration .
the pet / ct confirmed the presence of a tumor with increased suv ( standardized uptake value ) of eight , as can be seen in figure 2 .
figure 2 eighteen pet / ct scans reveal that the lesion is hypermetabolic with a standardized uptake value ( suvmax ) of 8 .
the serum tumor markers were within normal range. with a provisional diagnosis of local recurrence , the patient was scheduled for an exploratory laparotomy and liver metastasectomy .
an intraoperative ultrasound was performed , which detected a lesion of approximately 4 cm at the site of previous resection adherent with the diaphragm .
an en bloc resection of the tumor and part of the diaphragm followed .
a frozen section of the resected liver specimen was negative for malignancy .
the histology revealed granulomatous tissue with giant cells and foreign body tissue reaction as presented in figure 3 and figure 4 .

figure 4 low power histology section showing giant cells ( a ) , foreign body remnants ( b ) , fibrous tissue ( c ) and hepatic tissue with adjacent foreign body reaction .
the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day .
discussion pet / ct has been established as an indispensable imaging tool in oncologic patients .
it is widely used for diagnosis , staging , and monitoring of several malignancies , and entails an excellent supplemental testing for clarification of suspicious findings detected in a ct scan [ 1 ] .
interpretation of a pet / ct scan , however , requires vigilance and experience to identify false positive findings .
the common benign pathology may mimic malignancy in these scans , which may lead to an ill - suited therapeutic strategy with possible negative repercussions .
metallic implants or presence of contrast medium is a fairly common factor that causes false positive findings in a pet / ct image .
also , patient breathing during the procedure might lead to misalignment of the images , and inaccurate localization of a lesion , i.e. a liver lesion might be interpreted as a lung nodule due to diaphragm movement .
the above artifacts can be eliminated through technical practices and careful instructions towards the patient regarding his breathing movements [ 4 ] .
nevertheless , apart from the general technology - specific pitfalls , there are imaging issues that are specifically related to the liver which is one of the commonest sites of metastasis arising from the gastrointestinal tract , lung , pancreas and other primary tumors .
because the diagnosis of hepatic metastasis often alters the treatment plan considerably , liver imaging presents a common challenge in oncological evaluation by pet / ct. it is important to take into consideration that 18fdg ( 18 - fluoro - 2 - deoxyglucose ) uptake is not specific to malignancy .
18fdg is a glucose analog that allows evaluation of glucose metabolism and is the most commonly used pet tracer that is transported into cells by glucose transporters .
cancer cells have been shown to indicate an increased uptake of glucose and glycolytic enzymes , and therefore preferential uptake of fdg .
yet , 18fdg is well known to accumulate in inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes , neutrophils and macrophages in various inflammatory conditions due to elevated glucose requirements .
the increased uptake of fdg in such lesions mimics the imaging characteristics of malignant tissue leading to false positive results [ 5 ] .
therefore , correlation with clinical setting and other imaging findings is essential for the correct diagnosis .
for instance , the presence of solitary uptake in the liver is non - specific of metastases in pet / ct imaging .
on the other hand , multiple sites of focally increased 18fdg concentration , in the background of relatively lower , normal hepatocyte - uptake are regarded as the hallmark of metastatic liver involvement from a known primary tumor .
solitary uptake can be due to infection or other inflammatory conditions like histiocytosis , abscesses , and granulomatous tissue .
the inflammatory process can produce granulomatous tissue , i.e. sarcoidosis or as a reaction to foreign bodies like surgical adhesives , hemostatic agents or sutures [ 6,7 ] .
similarly , inflammation related to therapeutic procedures such as surgery often produce a foreign body reaction leading to increased uptake on pet / ct scan following surgery or biopsy [ 8 ] .
foreign body granulomas have also been reported to masquerade as liver metastases in radiologic imaging [ 9 ] .
this phenomenon is particularly common after lung resections , where adhesives are used to prevent air leakage but have also been reported in general surgical cases after the use of hemostatic agents [ 7 ] .
taking into consideration the impact of pet / ct findings on therapeutic decisions regarding oncologic patients , the occurrence of false positive results is not negligible , as pet / ct can direct patient management by targeting surgical resections of liver metastases .
nevertheless , although knowing these pitfalls , the physician should be assessed the outcome of undertreating a malignancy and the mortality and morbidity risks of a surgical procedure .
our patient had already been subjected to metastasis excision while both ct and pet / ct scans confirmed the presence of a highly suspicious lesion and no evidence of widespread disease .
suv ( standardized uptake value ) on pet / ct revealed an increased uptake of eight , exceptionally higher than the cutoff level between benign and malignant lesion or nodule ; the cutoff being approximately 3.5 for metastases > 1 cm , and could vary across between several tumors [ 10 ] .
hence , in our case , exploratory surgery seemed the only reasonable option .
conclusions abnormal liver uptake in pet / ct imaging is a common finding and interpretation of radiologic images in oncologic patients .
it should be approached with caution and awareness of pitfalls , especially in the postoperative setting .
correlation with an appropriate clinical background , and findings from other imaging modalities and tumor marker values , are the keys to decision making in achieving a correct diagnosis .
in doubtful cases , other diagnostic methods should be employed whenever possible , i.e. , percutaneous or endoscopic biopsy .

background the central nervous tissue contains diverse subtypes of neurons with characteristic morphological and physiological features and different neurotransmitter phenotypes .
the generation of neurons with defined neurotransmitter phenotypes seems to be governed by factors differently expressed along the anterior - posterior and dorsal - ventral body axes .
the mechanisms of the cell - type determination , however , are poorly understood .
selected neuronal phenotypes had been generated from embryonic stem ( es ) cells , but similar results were not obtained on more restricted neural stem cells , presumably due to the lack of homogeneous neural stem cell populations as a starting material .
results in the presented work , the establishment of different neurotransmitter phenotypes was investigated in the course of in vitro induced neural differentiation of a one - cell derived neuroectodermal cell line , in conjunction with the activation of various region - specific genes .
for comparison , similar studies were carried out on the r1 embryonic stem ( es ) and p19 multipotent embryonic carcinoma ( ec ) cells .
in response to a short treatment with all - trans retinoic acid , all cell lines gave rise to neurons and astrocytes .
non - induced neural stem cells and self - renewing cells persisting in differentiated cultures , expressed " stemness genes " along with early embryonic anterior - dorsal positional genes , but did not express the investigated cns region - specific genes .
in differentiating stem - like cell populations , on the other hand , different region - specific genes , those expressed in non - overlapping regions along the body axes were activated .
the potential for diverse regional specifications was induced in parallel with the initiation of neural tissue - type differentiation .
in accordance with the wide regional specification potential , neurons with different neurotransmitter phenotypes developed .
mechanisms inherent to one - cell derived neural stem cell populations were sufficient to establish glutamatergic and gabaergic neuronal phenotypes but failed to manifest cathecolaminergic neurons .
conclusion the data indicate that genes involved in positional determination are activated along with pro - neuronal genes in conditions excluding any outside influences .
interactions among progenies of one cell derived neural stem cells are sufficient for the activation of diverse region specific genes and initiate different routes of neuronal specification .
background in the course of neural tissue genesis , multipotent neuroepithelial stem / progenitor cells give rise to a number of transient and persisting cell types .
despite the apparent histological homogeneity , the early neuroepithelium is composed of clusters of cell populations with different expression of " pre - neural " and " positional " genes [ 1,2 ] .
in the closing neural tube , regionalization and segmentation take place well before the formation of neurons [ 3 - 5 ] .
the regional heterogeneity is then translated into neuronal sub - type heterogeneity during neural tissue formation [ 6,7 ] .
the place of origin highly determines the morphology and the neurotransmitter phenotype of future neurons [ 8,9 ] .
in neuronal progenitors and early precursors , regional determination is thought to decide on the expression of possible homologues of basic helix - loop - helix ( bhlh ) proneural transcription factors [ 10,11 ] .
in the forebrain , mash1 bhlh proneural factor is expressed in ventral areas , together with the dlx2 positional factor , which is responsible for the activation of the gad65 , a key enzyme of gaba synthesis .
the gene cascade is required for the differentiation and migration of ventral forebrain derived gabaergic interneurons of the cortex [ 12,11,13 ] .
in establishment of the cortical glutamatergic neuronal phenotype , ngn2 , another bhlh proneural factor plays an essential role [ 12 ] .
emx2 transcription factor , which is expressed in an overlapping domain with ngn2 helps to maintain the stem / progenitor pool in the ventricular zone of the dorsal anterior forebrain , therefore it appears to be an important regulator of the size of the cerebral cortex [ 14 ] .
despite of rapidly accumulating data , the mechanisms underlying the timing and spatial restrictions of the activation of region - specific and proneural genes are not fully understood .
consequently , the regulation of neuronal sub - type determination is not clear .
because of the complexity of the developing central nervous tissue , simplified in vitro models , including cultures of embryonic [ 15 ] or adult [ 16 ] neuroectodermal progenitors and neurosphere preparations [ 17,6,18 ] have been used to investigate neural cell fate decision .
the in vitro results indicated some flexible regional commitment of neural stem cells [ 18,19 ] and a decisive role of the extracellular environment in regional specification [ 20,21 ] .
primary cultures and neurosphere preparations , however , contain multiple types of cells with heterogeneity in both origin and differentiation phase [ 17 ] .
the heterogeneity hinders the identification of the routes and consequently , the regulatory mechanisms leading to regional and phenotypic determination .
homogeneous starting material for such studies is provided by pheno - and genotypically homogeneous , cloned stem cell populations .
in the presented work , the expression of proneural bhlh transcription factors were investigated in conjunction with the activation of various region - specific genes in the course of in vitro neuron formation by three different , mouse stem - like cell clones including ne - 4c embryonic neuroectodermal [ 22 ] , r1 embryonic stem ( es ) [ 23 ] and the p19 embryonic carcinoma ( ec ) [ 24 ] cell clones .
the ne - 4c clone [ 22,25 ] was derived from anterior brain vesicles of p53 - deficient early ( e9 ) mouse embryos , and is composed by a nestin expressing population of proliferating neuroectodermal stem cells .
if induced by all - trans retinoic acid ( ra ) or by the presence of perinatal astrocytes [ 25 ] , ne - 4c cells give rise to neurons and later to astrocytes on a highly reproducible schedule [ 22,26,26 ] .
as a further indication of neural stem cell nature , ne - 4c cells integrate into the embryonic brain tissue and provide neurons for the early developing host brain [ 21 ] .
implantation - experiments [ 27 ] demonstrated that ne - 4c cells , in vivo , can generate myelin oligodendrocyte - specific protein ( mosp ) , o1 - o4 and rip immunoreactive oligodendrocytes , as well .
the lack of p53 did not interfere with neuron formation [ 28,22,26 ] .
data on the interference of p53 with the activation of region - specific genes , or with the determination of the body axes , however , are missing .
therefore we conducted experiments on two other clones of embryonic stem - like cells ( the r1 ( es ) [ 23 ] and the p19 [ 24 ] ( ec ) cells , both known to have no defect in their p53 pathway .
embryonic stem ( es ) and embryonic carcinoma ( ec ) cell lines represent multipotent populations of early embryonic cells , which can be directed to neural differentiation [ 29,24,31 ] , but can produce non - neural tissue - type cells , as well .
in contrast , ne - 4c cells were shown [ 32 ] to produce only neural tissue - type cells .
non - induced cells of each line expressed " stemness genes " along with the early embryonic anterior - dorsal otx2 gene , but did not transcribe any other investigated cns region - specific genes .
in the course of in vitro induced differentiation , however , several region - specific and diverse sub - type specific pro - neuronal genes were activated .
in the absence of any exogenous inducers , cell - autonomous mechanisms were sufficient to drive the manifestation of distinct neurotransmitter phenotypes .
results in vitro neuron formation by stem - like cells morphological , cell biological and molecular changes were followed during retinoic acid ( all - trans retinoic acid ; ra ) induced neural differentiation of r1 ( es ) [ 23 ] , p19 ( ec ) [ 29,24,30 ] ; and ne - 4c embryonic neuroectodermal [ 22 ] stem cells .
large number of neurons was formed by all stem - like cell populations ( fig. 1 ) on a reproducible but cell line - dependent schedule .
bulk neuron formation was evident in p19 cultures by the 3rd day of ra - induction .
for mass appearance of neurons , es cells must have been first grown as aggregates and treated with ra for 4 days ( eb4 ; see m & m ) , and then incubated in monolayer cultures for a further 7 days .
figure 1 neurons develop from es , ec and ne - 4c cells in response to treatment with retinoic acid .
cultures were stained for neuron - specific betaiii - tubulin in a phase of differentiation corresponding to stage 4 of ne - 4c development : the 15th day of induced differentiation of r1 ( es ) , the 4th day for p19 ( ec ) and the 7th day for ne - 4c .
bars : 50 mum differentiation of ne - 4c cells proceeded through well - characterized stages ( see table 1 ; fig. 2 , fig. 3 ) , each marked by a specific combination of immunocytochemical markers [ 22 ] , appearance of novel cell physiological features [ 33 ] and the formation of specific cell - arrangements [ 22 ] .
rc2 immune - positive , radial glia - like cells appeared by the end of stage 2 and were located in clusters of morphologically yet homogeneous cells ( fig. 2 ) .
the first neuronal precursors with betaiii - tubulin and nfl immunoreactivity appeared in stage 3 , and a large number of developing neurons formed by stage 5 .
the number of rc2 radial - glia like cells decreased when neurogenesis reached its highest level .
( fig. 2 ) .
in stage 6 ( fig. 3 ) , networks of mature neurons formed [ 34,35 ] on the top of a substrate - attached monolayer of flat cells containing a number of gfap - positive astrocytes .
ssea - 1 immune - reactive , self - renewing stem cells with neural inducibility ( see below ) persisted in differentiated ( stage 5 - 6 ) ne - 4c cultures ( fig. 3 ) , and composed substrate - attached spots among differentiated neurons and gfap - positive astrocytes .

the first betaiii - tubulin - positive neuronal precursors ( h ) appear inside the compact aggregates ( c ) .
at stage 4 , cells migrate out from the aggregates ( d ) , and form a two - layer arrangement with a basal substrate - attached monolayer and loose neuronal aggregates on the top of it ( j ) .
morphologically " mature " neurons appear by the end of the first week of induction ( stage 5 ) and form dense networks on the surface of a substrate - attached monolayer ( e , k ). by the time neurogenesis reaches its highest level , the number of rc2 immune - positive radial - glia like cells decreases ( l ) .
averages of fluorescence area - values for rc2 and betaiii - tubulin ( see m & m ) staining were related to the dapi - stained area - value representing all cell nuclei , on the same microscopic field .

otx2 a known early neuroectodermal marker gene [ 36 ] was active also in non - induced es and ec cells .
non - differentiated r1 es and p19 ec cells , but not ne - 4c cells also expressed emx2 region - specific and mash1 pro - neural genes ( fig. 4 ) .
figure 4 activation of region - specific genes is turned on after the onset of neural differentiation .
rt - pcr analyses on the expression of otx2 , emx2 , dlx2 , hox2b region - specific , ngn2 , mash1 proneural and math2 neuron - specific genes , in non - induced ( d0 ; st1 ) and in neuron - enriched ( d15 , d4 , st4 ) cultures of r1 ( es ) , p19 ( ec ) and ne - 4c ( neural stem ) cells , respectively. by the time of the mass - production of neurons displaying betaiii - tubulin immune - reactivity and expressing the math2 neuronal gene ( see fig. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , region - specific genes , emx2 , dlx2 , hox2b , marking non - overlapping regions in the developing nervous system , were activated in all - es , ec and ne - 4c - cultures ( fig. 4 ) .
ssea - 1 positive , non - differentiated cells persisting in differentiated ne - 4c neural cultures ( fig. 3a ) and comprising 2 to 5 % of total cells , were separated by facs sorting for ssea - 1 immunoreactivity ( fig. 5 ). from the selected ssea - 1 positive cell fraction several one - cell derived colonies were established by cell cloning .
these subclones of morphologically non - differentiated ( fig. 6a ) , proliferating cells could be induced by ra to give rise to neurons and astrocytes ( fig. 6b , c ) , indicating a preserved developmental capacity of ne - 4c mother cells .
in their non - induced stage ( stage 1 ) , ssea - 1 sorted sub - clones did not express the investigated region - specific genes ( fig. 6d ) , except otx2 ( data not shown ) .
a variety of region - specific genes , however , became activated by the time of appearance of neurons ( stage 4 ) .
the data indicated that expression of diverse region - specific genes was induced along with neural differentiation .

the histogram ( b ) and the statistics ( c ) showed an about 5 % frequency of ssea - 1 positive cells among the total cells ( r1 ; 100 %) defined by forward scatter ( fsc ) value >= 200 .
figure 6 non - differentiated , ssea - 1 positive cells re - cloned from differentiated ne - 4c cultures display neural stem cell properties .
non - differentiated cells re - cloned from differentiated ( stage 6 ) cultures displayed epithelial morphology ( a ) but gave rise to neurons ( b ) and astrocytes ( c ) if induced with ra. betaiii - tubulin immunoreactive neurons ( b ) and gfap - positive astroglial cells ( c ) visualized by hrp - dab reaction are shown in a representative clone ( clone 0901 ) .
bars : 50 mum on a , c and 100 mum on b. d : investigated sub - clones ( clone 0901 ; 0905 ; 1204 ) showed a gene expression pattern characteristic to non - induced ( stage1 ) ne - 4c cells , but expressed a variety of region - specific genes after reaching more differentiated stage ( st4 ) .
particular region - specific genes become activated in different stages of in vitro neural differentiation the onset of detectable transcription from the investigated region - specific genes seemed to be bound to two different stages of neural development of ne - 4c cells ( fig. 7 ) .
one set of region - specific genes including pax6 , gbx2 and hoxb2 were activated as early as stage 2 , when pro - neural gene - activity had already been turned on .
( interestingly , r1 es and p19 ec cells expressed mash1 in their non - differentiated stages while another proneural gene ngn2 became activated only later , coinciding with the onset of neuron - morphogenesis ( fig. 4 )) figure 7 expression of region - specific genes in cultures of ne - 4c neural stem cells at different stages of neural differentiation .
a group of region - specific genes including pax6 , gbx2 , and hoxb2 was activated at the time of switching on proneural ( e.g. ngn2 ) genes .
the expression of another set of " positional " genes ( dlx2 , emx2 , otx3 ) was detected in a later phase of differentiation , along with the activation of math2 neuronal gene .
the expression of another group of region - specific genes ( emx2 , dlx2 and otx3 ) was detected not sooner than stage 4 , when math2 , a marker for postmitotic maturing neurons [ 37 ] was also active ( fig. 7 ) .
bearing in mind that ra may also serve as a " posteriorizing and ventralizing " agent [ 38 ] , we compared the effects of short - and long - term presence of ra. in addition to the standard 48 - hour treatment , ne - 4c cells were exposed to 10 - 6 m ra for 12 , 72 and 168 hours and the expression of several region - specific genes was investigated on the 7th day ( stage 4 ) of induction ( fig. 8 ) .
each exposure to ra resulted in neuron formation ( fig. 8a ) , but the proportion of neurons was smaller after the shortest ( 12 hour ) induction .
long - term exposure to ra ( 168 h for ne - 4c and 96 hours for r1 es ) effectively reduced the otx2 transcript level ( fig. 8b ) , but failed to cause relevant changes in the expression of many positional genes including the anterior - dorsal emx2 .
figure 8 neuron formation and gene expression after short - or long - term exposure to ra. differentiation of ne - 4c cells was induced by exposure to 10 - 6 m ra for 12 , 72 or 168 hours .
a : the number of neurons was determined by counting neun - positive nuclei after a 168 - hour period of differentiation ( stage 4 ) .
in comparison to longer ( 72 - hour or 168 - hour ) treatments , short term ( 12 - hour ) induction resulted in less neun - positive neurons .
( averages and standard deviation values were calculated from 4 identically treated sister - cultures ( n = 4 )) .
b : short - term ( 12 - hour ) or long - term ( 72 or 168 hours ) presence of ra did not cause significant changes in the expression of hox2b , gbx2 and pax6 genes .
the continuous presence of ra did not inhibit the expression of the dorsal forebrain specific emx2 gene , but was sufficient to reduce the ra - sensitive otx2 mrna level .
the results of a representative rt - pcr assay on non - induced ( stage 1 ; left column ) and differentiated , neuron - rich ( stage 4 ; three right columns ) cultures are shown .
one - cell derived progenies can acquire diverse neurotransmitter phenotypes the expression of different homologues of proneural genes ( ngn2 and mash1 ) and the activation of diverse region - specific genes suggested a possible diversity in the neurotransmitter phenotype adopted by ne - 4c neurons .
immunocytochemical analyses of differentiated ( stage 5 - 6 ) ne - 4c cultures demonstrated gabaergic ( fig. 9a ) and glutamatergic ( fig. 9b ) cells among mature , neun [ 39 ] , map2 or betaiii - tubulin immunopositive neurons .
gabaergic neurons were identified by the presence of the vesicular gaba transporter ( vgat ) .
glutamatergic neurons were stained for the vesicular glutamate transporter ( vglut2 ) .
in stage 6 , these two neuronal subtypes , together , composed the majority ( approximately 95 %) of neun positive cells ( data not shown ) .
figure 9 ne - 4c derived neurons can acquire different neurotransmitter phenotypes .
a : double immune - staining for map2 ( red ; a1 , a3 ) neuronal marker and for vgat ( green ; a2 , a3 ) gabaergic neuronal marker showed that vgat staining was confined to neurons , but not all neurons displayed vgat - immune - reactivity .
arrows mark double immune - reactive cells ; asterisk indicates a vgat - negative neuron .
b : double immune - staining for betaiii - tubulin ( green ; b1 , b3 ) and vglut2 ( red ; b2 , b3 ) glutamatergic neuronal marker demonstrated the presence of both glutamatergic ( arrows ) and non - glutamatergic neurons .
asterisk marks betaiii - tubulin positive but vglut2 negative neurons .
c : double staining for vgat ( green ; c2 , c3 ) and vglut2 ( red ; c1 , c3 ) revealed a complete segregation of gabaergic ( arrows ) and glutamatergic ( arrowheads ) processes .
immunostaining was made on differentiated ne - 4c cultures at stage 6 .
bars : 10 mum in addition to demonstrating the activity of proneural genes linked to the establishment of the gabaergic and glutamatergic phenotypes ( mash1 and ngn2 , respectively ) , several genes involved in the maintenance of these neurotransmitter phenotypes were transcribed in differentiating ne - 4c cultures ( fig. 10 ) .
figure 10 expression of genes indicating glutamatergic and gabaergic neuronal phenotypes .
the expression of the gabaergic phenotype - related gad67 or gad65 and the glutamatergic vglut2 genes was detected in math2 expressing , neuron rich cultures of all ( r1 es , p19 ec and ne - 4c ns ) cell lines .
unexpectedly , vgat was expressed by all types of non - induced stem cells .
samples were taken on different stages of neural differentiation ; for r1 es on days 0,5,6,7,8,15 ( see m & m ) ; for p19 ec on days 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 after ra - induction ; for ne - 4c ns : at stages 1,3,4,5 ( see table 1 ) .
as expected from earlier results [ 35 ] , many genes related to gaba metabolism were active at early stages of neural differentiation ( fig. 10 ) , well before the appearance of morphologically identified neurons .
while ebihara and colleagues [ 40 ] reported on a low - level vgat expression in non - induced p19 cells , the ubiquitous presence of vgat mrna in all non - induced stem - like cells , was a rather unexpected finding .
in contrast to a marked presence of vgat mrna in non - induced ne - 4c cultures , vgat immunoreactivity was detected only in a proportion of mature neurons at stages 5 and 6 ( fig. 9a , c ). by this stage , genes coding for the gaba synthesizing enzymes ( gad65 and gad67 ) were also active ( fig. 10 ) .
the vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 ( vglut2 ) , was undetectable in non - differentiated stem - like cell cultures , either at mrna or protein level .
the activation of vglut2 gene was detected only in neuron - rich , math2 expressing cultures derived either from es , ec or from neuroectodermal stem cells ( fig. 10 ) .
accordingly , vglut2 immunoreactive neurons were detected only in differentiated neuronal cultures from stage 4 onwards ( fig. 9b , c ) .
in order to decide whether individual ne - 4c derived neurons were exclusively committed to either gabaergic or glutamatergic fates , neurons were double - stained for vgat and vglut2 proteins ( fig. 9c ) .
double immunolabeling revealed a complete segregation of vgat and vglut2 staining , indicating the differentiation of at least two distinct subtypes of neurons .
while a few serotonin containing ( fig. 11a ) cells were revealed , ne - 4c neurons with tyrosine - hydroxylase immunoreactivity were not found ( table 2 ) .
genes coding for transcription factors involved in the regulation of monoaminergic differentiation ( lmx1b , nkx2.2 , [ 41 ] gata3 [ 42 ] , phox2b [ 43 ] , on the other hand , were transcribed by stage 4 ( fig. 11b ) .
according to gene array analysis ( see additional file 1 ) , however , the expression from a number of genes related to monoaminergic development [ 44,45 ] did not increase significantly in the course of in vitro induced neuron formation .
table 2 distribution of investigated neurotransmitter phenotypes in stage 6 transmitter phenotype investigated molecule percentage of neurons gabaergic gaba , vgat 57,7 +/ - 8,2 * glutamatergic vglut2 44.2 +/ - 1,6 * cathecolaminergic th not detected serotonergic 5 ht < 1 100 % was determined as the total number of the neun positive neurons figure 11 monoaminergic features in differentiating ne - 4c cultures .
a : 5ht staining of ne - 4c derived neurons at stage 5 , scale bar : 10 mum .
approximately 1 % of the neurons contained 5 ht ( see also table 2 ) .
b : several genes coding for transcription factors involved in the differentiation of monoaminergic neurons were transcribed in stage 4 and 5 neuron rich ( math2 expressing ) cultures .
the data demonstrated that after initiation of neural differentiation by ra , intrinsic interactions between one - cell derived neural progenitors were sufficient to establish distinct gaba or glutamatergic neurotransmitter phenotypes , but did not result in the formation of catecholaminergic neurons .
discussion in non - induced stages , one - cell derived populations of es , ec and neuroectodermal stem cells expressed only early anterior - dorsal region - specific genes , characterizing the developing epiblast / neural plate areas [ 46 ] .
upon neural differentiation , a variety of region - specific genes , those expressed in non - overlapping regions of the developing cns , were activated .
the activation of positional genes seemed to depend on the stage of differentiation .
the r1 es , p19 ec and ne - 4c neuroectodermal stem cells , in their non - induced states , represented different stages of stem cell differentiation .
for neural commitment , es cells had to be preincubated to form embryoid body like aggregates [ 47 ] prior to and during the induction with ra , and mature neurons developed only after a further growth in monolayer cultures .
p19 cells , on the other hand , produced neurons in a short period ( 3 days ) after ra - induction even in comparison to the 5 - 7 days neurogenetic period of ne - 4c cells .
despite the above differences , ra - induced neural differentiation could be compared among the different cell lines if the activation of ngn2 proneural gene was set as a reference point ( 3rd day for es , 1st day for p19 and 2nd day for ne - 4c after the onset of ra induction ) .
in response to ra - induction , es and ec cell populations could give rise to a number of non - neural cells in addition to the differentiation of neurons [ 48,49 ] .
in such preparations , neural and non - neural cells could interact with each other , mimicking some in vivo interplay between the developing neural and non - neural tissues .
in the case of ne - 4c neuroectodermal cells , which do not produce any non - neural progenies [ 32 ] different region - specific genes were activated by mechanisms inherent to the one - cell derived neuroectodermal population .
a set of region - specific genes , including gbx2 , hoxb2 and pax6 became active along with pro - neural genes , at a stage when the rc2 immunoreactive radial glia - like phenotype appeared in induced ne - 4c cultures .
in case of the hox - family genes , known to respond directly to ra [ 4,50 ] , rapid gene activation was expected in response to ra. direct ra - responsiveness of gbx2 or pax6 genes , however , was not reported .
another set of " positional " genes , including emx2 , otx3 , dlx2 nkx2.2 , lmx1b , gata3 , expression was detected only after the activation of the neuron - specific math2 gene .
the delayed activation of these genes could not be the result of any direct effect of ra , as ra was removed days before the onset of the gene activation .
the applied conditions were sufficient to induce and maintain gabaergic and glutamatergic fates in ne - 4c neurons , but failed to manifest catecholaminergic or cholinergic ( data not shown ) features .
the formation of catecholaminergic neurons from es cells [ 51 ] , requires soluble factors such as shh , fgf2 and fgf8 .
ra was reported to promote the production of shh and fgf8 in the developing chicken brain [ 52 ] , but shh production was demonstrated in quails even at complete lack of ra [ 53 ] .
according to gene array analyses ( see additional file 1 ) , transcription from fgf8 and shh did not change in the course of neural differentiation of ne - 4c cells .
the activation of genes indicating catecholaminergic development including nurr1 [ 54 ] or tyrosine - hydroxylase ( th ) , showed either a short transient increase or did not change in the course of neuron formation by ne - 4c cells .
the absence of catecholaminergic cells suggest an insufficient level of factors necessary for the establishment of monoaminergic phenotypes [ 44 ] .
future experimentation will determine whether the few serotonin containing neurons represented a serotonergic population or only a subpopulation of gabaergic neurons containing 5 ht as a neuromodulator [ 55 ] .
in our experiments , ra was withdrawn from the environment of differentiating cells after initiation of neural differentiation .
the intrinsic interactions in differentiating populations of one cell derived ne - 4c cells could result in the production of glutamatergic and gabaergic neurons , but failed to manifest all of the major neurotransmitter phenotypes .
while several posterior ( hoxb2 , gbx2 , phox2b , lmxb1 ) and ventral ( dlx2 ) positional genes were activated , this activity was insufficient to manifest catecholaminergic phenotypes in ne - 4c derived neurons .
it may be due to the restricted developmental potential of the cell line , or may indicate a requirement of extrinsic factors for cholinergic or catecholaminergic commitment .
conclusion the data demonstrated that cell - autonomous mechanisms can direct diverse " regional " specifications in positionally non - determined neuroectodermal cells and manifest different - at least gabaergic and glutamatergic - neurotransmitter phenotypes .
methods maintenance and neural induction of ne - 4c and p 19 cells the ne - 4c and p19 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium ( mem ; sigma ) supplemented with 5 % fetal calf serum ( fcs ; gibco ) , 4 mm glutamine ( sigma ) and 40 mug / ml gentamycin ( chinoin ) , at 37degreesc temperature with 5 % co2 .
sub - confluent cultures were regularly split by trypsinisation using 0.05 % trypsin ( sigma ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) and transferred into poly - l - lysine ( pll ) ( sigma ) coated dishes at a cell density of 104 cells / cm2 .
neural differentiation was induced with a 48 - hour treatment with 10 - 6 m all - trans retinoic acid ( ra ) ( sigma ) .

two days before induction , es cells were transferred to gelatin ( sigma ) coated petri dishes ( greiner ) for 24 hours ( day 0 of differentiation ) , then harvested and transferred into bacteriological dishes in differentiation medium ( ko - dmem supplemented with glutamax , 50 mug / ml streptomycin , 50 u / ml penicillin , 50 mm beta - mercaptoethanol , 0.1 mm non - essential amino acids , and 15 % fcs ) ( 5 x 106 cells / 10 ml ) .
embryoid bodies ( ebs ) were formed in suspension were transferred into fresh dishes with fresh medium every second day .
all - trans retinoic acid ( 10 - 6 m ; sigma ) was added for 4 days , between the 4th and 8th days .
on the 8th day of differentiation , ebs were plated onto gelatin - coated plates and maintained for a further 7 days .
rt - pcr analysis ne - 4c , r1 ( es ) and p19 ( ec ) cells were lysed by addition of tri reagent ( sigma ) according to the instruction of the manufacturer .
total rna fraction was then isolated using organic / inorganic extraction by the standard procedures .
dna contamination was eliminated by dnase - i ( fermentas ) treatment .
the isolated rna was suspended in rnase / dnase free water at a concentration of 1 mug / mul and stored at - 70degreesc .
reverse transcription ( rt ) reactions were undertaken from 1.5 mug total rna using first strand cdna synthesis kit ( fermentas ) at 42degreesc .
the quantity and a potential genomic dna contamination of the cdna product was determined by pcr ( hotstart taq pcr kit ( qiagen )) using primers recognizing both cdna ( 248 bp ) and genomic dna ( 1086 bp ) sequences of the house keeping hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase coding gene ( hprt ) .
cdna samples containing no genomic dna were diluted according to the amplified hprt product and used for further pcr analyses .
the optimum temperatures , cycle numbers and mgcl2 concentrations were set for each primer pairs ( table 3 ) .
the pcr products were run in ethidium bromide containing agarose gels , and were visualized by uv trans - illumination .

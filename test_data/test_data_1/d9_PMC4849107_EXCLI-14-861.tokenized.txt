sem micrographs of the inner and outer surfaces of the silybum marianum shell obtained by variant extractions demonstrated that the extraction of silymarin required the destruction of cell walls .
the results suggest that uaee is a promising alternative for the extraction of silymarin .
the antioxidant activities of the silymarin were evaluated in vitro by its capabilities to scavenger the dpph , hydroxyl and superoxide free radicals , as well as by its tyrosinase inhibitory activity .
the results showed that silymarin has significant antioxidant activity , thus it can be used as a functional food material against oxidative stress .
we believe that the knowledge gained from this study should contribute to the further development and application of this resource .
silybum marianum ultrasonic assisted enzymatic extraction silymarin box - behnken design sem antioxidant activity introduction silymarin , derived from the silybum marianum plant , has been widely used for centuries for its hepato - protective properties .
it has also been used against toxic liver damage , hepatitis and cirrhosis ( mayer et al. , 2005 [ 18 ] ; wellington and jarvis , 2001 [ 27 ] ; saller et al. , 2001 [ 23 ] ; kren et al. , 2005 [ 14 ]) .
in addition to its antioxidant properties , it has been reported to have exceptional anti - tumor promoting activity ( singh and agarwal , 2004 [ 24 ] ; davis - searles et al. , 2005 [ 7 ]) and has also been linked to the prevention of skin cancer ( katiyar , 2003 [ 11 ]) .
silymarin consists primarily of a mixture of active flavonolignans isomers : silychristin , sc ; silydianin , sd ; and two groups of diastereoisomers , silybins a and b ( sb a , sb b ) , and isosilybins a and b ( isb a , isb b ) ( kim et al. , 2003 [ 12 ] ; lee and liu , 2003 [ 17 ]) .
the isomers of silymarin have been found to have different biological activities ( kren et al. , 2000 [ 13 ] ; chlopcikova et al. , 2004 [ 6 ]) .
several methods for the extraction of silymarin from the seeds of silybum marianum have been described ( alvarez et al. , 2003 [ 2 ]) .
previously used extraction methods include methanol soxhlet extraction , pressurised liquid extraction , and reflux and mechanical shaking extraction using ( hot / liquid ) water as the solvent .
the extraction yield of silymarin from the seeds of silybum marianum using either ethanol , methanol , acetonitrile or acetone as extraction solvents have been investigated ( wallace et al. , 2003 [ 25 ]) .
however , the most important features of ultrasonic assisted enzymatic extraction ( uaee ) have not yet been fully elucidated and the establishment of the parameters of the silymarin uaee process requires the systematic analysis of the experimental data .
the silymarin in silybum marianum is mainly found wrapped in the cell wall , composed mainly of cellulose , but with the ethanol extraction method the cell wall cannot be completely broken for the dissolution silymarin ; thus , there is considerable resistance , resulting in a greatly affected and wasteful extraction that is more costly and yields an extract with impurities and of not high quality .
response surface methodology ( rsm ) is a useful package of statistical and mathematical techniques used for developing and improving processes by solving simulation - based optimization problems , which was first introduced by box and wilson .
one of the advantages of this method is its ability to take into account the interactions among different variables as opposed to the traditional one variable at a time analysis .
additionally , as an experimental design , rsm can reduce the number of experiments and provide a mathematical model .
( guan and yao , 2008 [ 8 ] ; karacabey and mazza , 2010 [ 10 ] ; nagendra et al. , 2011 [ 21 ] ; wang et al. , 2012 [ 26 ]) .
hence , rsm can be effectively used to evaluate the effects of multiple factors and their interaction on one or more response variables ( myers and montgomery , 2002 [ 19 ]) and is thus applicable to the silymarin extraction problems .
in the present study , the isolation of the silymarin from the silybum marianum seed shell was investigated and the operational parameters were optimized using a central composite rotatable design combined with rsm .
the seed shell silymarin extract processed by the uaee was also compared with the silymarin extract from the silybum marianum meal prepared by heating extraction with ethanol .
to verify that the silymarin yield and the quality attained by uaee was improved over that achieved by heating extraction , changes and composition were monitored by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and high pressure liquid chromatography ( hplc ) analysis , respectively .

extraction of silymarin extraction of silymarin from silybum marianum meal the dried powder of the silybum marianum meal ( 500 g ) was mixed in a beaker , at a liquid - solid ratio of 6:1 , with 70 % ethanol .
subsequently , extraction was performed in a water bath for 24 hours ; and then the total silymarin content was determined to calculate the extraction rate .
the uaee of silymarin from silybum mariannum seed shell after rolling peeling , the silybum marianum fruit was mixed with water ; the seed coat was next isolated by winnowing , and then collected , dried and crushed .
afterward the powder was passed through a 40 mesh sieve and set aside .
to extract the silymarin,1 kg of dried powder from the silybum marianum seed coat was mixed with petroleum ether ( boiling range 60 - 90 degreesc ) , skimmed for 8 h , filtered , and then defatted for 4 h with petroleum ether .
an amount of 500 g of dry weight , nonfat , silybum marianum seed coat powder was weighed and dissolved in 100 ml of 50 % ethanol .

subsequently , the solution was filtered by vacuum suction filtration and each filtrate ( about 250 ml ) was the concentrated using the rotary evaporator until it reached 250 ml of solution and lastly the total flavonoid content was determined .
determination of total silymarin the total content of silymarin was determined by the colorimetric method ( aliakbarian et al. , 2012 [ 1 ] ; antoine et al. , 2004 [ 3 ] ; karabegovic et al. , 2011 [ 9 ] ; zhang et al. , 2011 [ 28 ]) .

( where y is the absorbance value of the sample , and x is the sample concentration ) .
reverse - phase - hplc analysis the hplc was used on a shimadzu lc - 20avp system with two lc - 20at solvent delivery units , an spd - 20a uv - vis detector , a cto - 10asvp column oven ( shimadzu , kyoto , japan ) , a t2000p workstation ( shenyang , china ) and a reversed - phase c18 column ( 250 x 4.6mm , 5mum , diamodsiltm ) .

a sample chromatogram from the extraction of silymarin is shown in figure 1 ( fig. 1 ) .
response surface design of experiments on the basis of a single factor experiment , according to box - behnken central composite design principles , the process for the optimal extraction of silymarin was evaluated using rsm based on a three - level five - factor box behnken design to determine the optimum extraction conditions including ethanol concentration , enzyme concentration , extraction time , liquid - solid ratio and ultrasonic output power .
the experimental design factors levels are shown in table 1 ( tab. 1 ) .
data analysis and statistical methods the polynomial equation , the response surface curve and the contour plots were generated using the " design - expert " software ( version 8.0 , stat - ease inc. , minneapolis , mn , usa ) .
the experimental data were statistically analyzed using the " design - expert " package for analysis of variance ( anova ) .
all experimental results were centered at using three parallel measurements of the mean +/ - sd. p values < 0.05 were regarded as significant and p values < 0.01 as very significant .
evaluation of the antioxidant activities of silymarin in vitro superoxide anion radical - scavenging activity measurement of superoxide anion activity is based on the method described previously with minor modifications .
the pms - nadh system for the generation of superoxide radicals contains 3 ml of tris - hcl buffer ( 16 mm , ph 8.0 ) , 338 mum of nadh ( adenine dinucleotide ) , 72 mum of television ( nitro blue tetrazolium ) and 30 mum pms ( phenazine methosulphate ) .
varying concentrations of samples ranging from 25 to 400 mug / ml were added to the pms - nadh radical scavenging systems .
the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes before the blank absorbance is read 560 nm. tris - hcl buffer was used in the control or blank instead of sample .
the decreased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated an increased in superoxide anion scavenging activity .
the removal of superoxide radicals by total flavonoids from persimmon leaves ( tfpl ) can be calculated using the following equation : scavenging effect (%) = ( 1 - asample560 / acontrol560 ) x 100 % dpph radical - scavenging activity the free radical - scavenging activity of the purified silymarin was measured by the dpph method as previously described ( karacabey et al. , 2010 [ 10 ] ; guan andyao , 2008 [ 8 ]) with some modifications .
the 0.4 mmol / l solution of dpph in 95 % ethanol was freshly prepared daily , and 2 ml of this solution , together with 2 ml of 95 % ethanol , were added to 1ml samples of the purified silymarin at different concentrations in water .
the mixture was shaken vigorously and left to stand for 30 min in the dark , and the absorbance was then measured at 517 nm against a blank .
the decreased absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated an increased in free radical - scavenging activity , which was analyzed from the graph of the plotted inhibition percentage against compound concentration .
ascorbic acid was used as positive controls .
the experiments were performed in triplicate and the data averaged .
the radical - scavenging capability of the dpph was calculated by the following equation : e ( dpph * ) = [ 1 - ( ai - aj ) / a0 ] x 100 % where a0 is the absorbance of the dpph solution without test sample ( 2 ml dpph + 2 ml of 95 % ethanol ) ; ai is the absorbance of the test sample mixed with the dpph solution ( 2 ml sample + 2 ml dpph ) and aj is the absorbance of the sample without the dpph solution ( 2 ml sample + 2 ml of 95 % ethanol ) .
hydroxyl radical - scavenging activity .
the hydroxyl radical - scavenging activity of samples of tfpl was measured using a modified smirnoff and cumbes' method .
hydroxyl radicals were generated in a solution of 2 mm edta - fe ( 0.5ml ) , 3 % h2o2 ( 1ml ) , and 360 mug / ml crocus in 4.5 ml sodium phosphate buffer ( 150 mm , ph 7.4 ) .
the samples at concentrations ranging from 25 to 400 mug / ml were incubated at 37 degreesc for 30 min and hydroxyl radicals were detected by monitoring absorbance at 520 nm. in the control , distilled water and sodium phosphate buffer were used instead of test sample and h2o2 respectively .
all the experiments were performed in triplicate and the data averaged .
the hydroxyl radical - scavenging capability was calculated using the following equation : scavenging effect (%) = ( 1 - asample520 / acontrol520 ) x 100 % tyrosinase inhibitory activity assay tyrosinase ( tyr ) inhibitory activity was measured according to a previously described method .
first stocks of all test samples were made by dissolving them in dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) to a concentration of 1.0 mg / ml. each of these stocks was further diluted in dmso to various concentrations .
subsequently , 30 mul of each diluted test sample was added to 970 mul of phosphate buffer ph 6.8 in a test tube and was then combined with 1.0 ml of l - tyrosine and 1.0 ml of mushroom tyr ( 200 units / ml ) .
the resulting 3 ml test samples were incubated in a water bath at 37 degreesc for 20 minutes , and the enzyme activity was monitored by measuring the change in absorbance at 490 nm. quercetin was used as reference .
each experiment was repeated at least twice .
the percent inhibition of the tyr by the test sample was calculated as follows : tyrosinase activity inhibition rate ( %) = [ 1 - ( c - d ) / ( a - b )] x 100 % where a = a490 - drug + enzyme , b = a490 - drug - enzyme , c = a490 + drug + enzyme , d = a490 + drug - enzyme .
results and discussion single factor analysis method the results in table 2 ( tab .
2 ) show that the yield of silymarin was markedly impacted by the different concentrations of ethanol .
extraction yield is the highest when 70 % ethanol is used as the extraction solvent .
below 70 % ethanol , the yield increased as the concentration of ethanol increased .
in contrast , the yield decreased as the concentration of ethanol increased from 70 % to 90 % .
in fact , the data in table 2 ( tab. 2 ) indicated that there were significant differences among the yields obtained with 60 , 80 , 90 and 70 % ethanol ( p < 0.05 ) .
since the mean yield difference was the highest with about 70 % , the 70 % ethanol was selected as a center point for further rsm experiment .
additionally , the results in table 2 ( tab. 2 ) revealed the striking effect that the different enzyme concentrations had on the yield of silymarin .
when the enzyme concentration was under 30 % , the yields were improved by the increasing concentration of the enzyme .
in contrast , when the enzyme concentration was above 30 % , the yields declined as the enzyme concentration increased from 30 to 50 % .
indeed , the results in table 2 ( tab. 2 ) show that there were significant differences among the yields attained with the 20 , 40 and 30 % enzyme concentrations ( p < 0.05 ) .
as the mean yield difference was the highest at an enzyme concentration of 30 % , the 30 % concentration was selected as the center point for further rsm experiment .
the results displayed in table 2 ( tab. 2 ) also demonstrated that the yield of silymarin increased greatly when the liquid - solid ratio grew from 2:1 to 6:1 , and then it maintained a mild slope with increasing ratio of liquid to material .
in effect , the data in table 2 ( tab. 2 ) also revealed the significant differences that existed among the 2:1 , 4:1 , and 6:1 ratios ( p < 0.05 ) ; there was however no significant difference between the 6:1 and 8:1 ratios ( p > 0.05 ) .
thus , the liquid - solid ratio of 6:1 was selected as the center point for further rsm experiment .
similarly , the results revealed that the yield of silymarin was clearly enhanced by the increase of ultrasonic power from 160 w to 240 w. moreover , statistical analysis detected that there were significant differences among the ultrasonic powers tested ( table 2 ( tab. 2 )) .
however , it was also obvious from the mean ratio difference that the largest change in yield was caused from the ultrasonic power from 160 w to 180 w. although the ultrasonic power 180 w was adopted for use in this work , after taking into account of extraction efficiency , it was not however selected as the center point for further rsm experiment .
additionally , the yield of silymarin was also markedly improved by the increase of the extraction time from 60min to 120 min .
while , over 120 min , the yield decreased somewhat .
this might be due to the decomposition of active compounds during the prolonged extraction time .
the results in table 2 ( tab. 2 ) also revealed significant differences among the 60 , 90 and 120 min reaction times ( p < 0.05 ) , but there were no significant differences among the 150 and 180 reaction times ( p > 0.05 ) .
therefore , the center point of extraction time chosen for rsm was 120 min .
diagnostic checking of the fitted model according to the values obtained in the single factor experiment and the method of central composite design experiment , rsm was applied to monitor the extraction characteristics of the silymarin components in silybum marianum and to determine the optimum conditions .
experiments were randomized as detailed in table 3 ( tab. 3 ) .
multiple regression analysis of the experimental data yielded the following second - order polynomial stepwise equation : y = 7.74 - 0.33a + 0.044b - 0.32c - 0.16d + 0.17ab + 0.14ac - 0.26ad + 0.38bc + 0.48bd - 0.26cd - 3.44a2 - 1.56b2 - 2.38c2 - 1.81d2 anova was used to evaluate the model for significance and suitability , and a statistical summary was given in table 4 ( tab. 4 ) .
the model f value of 210.17 with a low probability p value indicates the high significance of the model .
there was only a 0.01 % chance that a model f value so large could occur due to noise .
the coefficient of determination ( r2 ) was the proportion of variability in the data explained or accounted for by the model .
the r2 of 0.9953 was therefore desirable .
previous studies ( le man et al , 2010 [ 16 ] ; chauhan and gupta , 2004 [ 4 ]) have emphasized the acceptance of any model with r2 > 0.75 .
equally , the linear variables a and c , the quadratic variables and a2 , b2 , c2 , d2 were statistically very significant at p < 0.0001 ; and the two - variable interactions ad , bc , bd and cd had significant influences ( p < 0.05 ) on the extraction yield of silymarin , whereas the linear variable c and the two - variable interaction ab had no significant influence ( p > 0.1 ) on the extraction yield of silymarin. by observing linear and quadratic coefficients , we concluded that the order of factors influencing the response value of the extraction yield of silymarin was as follows : ethanol concentration > extracting time > the liquid - solid ratio > enzyme concentration .
response surface analysis three - dimensional ( 3d ) response surfaces and two - dimensional ( 2d ) contour plots were used for the graphical representations of regression functions .
they are presented in figures 2 ( fig. 2 ) and 3 ( fig. 3 ) for the independent variables ( enzyme concentration , ethanol concentration , extraction time , and liquid - solid ratio ) and were obtained by keeping two of the variables constant , which indicated the changes in extraction yield under different conditions .
figures 2a ( fig. 2 ) and 4a ( fig. 4 ) show the 3d response surfaces and the elliptical contour plots , which illustrate the combined effect of ethanol concentration and enzyme concentration on the extraction yield .
they revealed that at low and high levels of the ethanol and enzyme concentrations the extraction yield was minimal .
when the ethanol concentration was at a certain value , the extraction yield increased with the increase of the liquid - solid ratio .
on the other hand , the effect of the increase of the enzyme concentration on the extraction yield at a certain ethanol concentration was not significant .
the results shown in figures 2b ( fig. 2 ) and 4b ( fig. 4 ) , indicated that the mutual interactions between ethanol concentration and extraction time were significant when the other two variables were held constant .
similarly , as shown in figures 2c ( fig. 2 ) and 4c ( fig. 4 ) , the ethanol concentration and the liquid - solid ratio displayed a quadratic effect on the response , and the mutual interactions between them were also significant .
in contrast , the combined effect of the extraction time and the enzyme concentration was not significant , as can be seen in figures 2d ( fig. 2 ) and 4d ( fig. 4 ) .
the results presented in figures 2e ( fig. 2 ) and 4e ( fig. 4 ) revealed that at a given enzyme concentration the surface was relatively flat , implying that the effect of the liquid - solid ratio on the rate of extraction of silymarin was not very evident .
however , when the liquid - solid ratio was at a certain value , the rate of extraction of silymarin increased and then decreased .
the effects seen in figures 2f ( fig. 2 ) and 4f ( fig. 4 ) indicated that when extraction time was at a certain value , the extraction yield obviously increased with the liquid - solid ratio added .
in addition , when the liquid - solid ratio was unchanged , the extraction yield increased as the extraction time increased .
overall , the response surface indicated that the extraction yield underwent noticeable increases depending upon the ethanol concentration , extraction time , and liquid - solid ratio , whereas no significant effect was observed in the enzyme concentration .
this was in good agreement with our findings in the evaluation by anova .
optimization and verification by using the design expert 8.0 software , the optimum conditions were determined and recognized as the practical optimum : ethanol concentration , 60 % ; enzyme concentration , 30 u / mg ; liquid - solid ratio , 6:1 ; and extraction time , 120 min .
the estimated y value , under those conditions , was 7.85 % ; while the experimentally determined y value was 8.1 % , which was consistent not only with the predictive values , but was also better than any single factor experiments .
therefore , the extraction conditions determined by rsm were not only accurate and reliable , but also have practical value by reflecting the expected optimization .
in contrast to traditional techniques , this model takes into account the interactions among several independent variables .
this work clearly shows that the extraction of silymarin from silybum marianum can be improved by optimizing several key extraction parameters .
extraction explores various auxiliary mechanisms in order to understand the mechanisms of the uaee method and the inner and outer surfaces of the silybum marianum seed shell , scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) was performed on the silybum marianum seed shells with a table top scanning electron microscope ( hitachi t - l000 ; hitachi high - tech. , shanghai , china ) .
the observations are depicted in the sem microphaphs shown in figure 3a - d ( fig. 3 ) .
antioxidant activity analysis scavenging activity on dpph radical the dpph contains a stable free radical , which has been widely used to assess the radical scavenging activity of antioxidants ( nagai et al. , 2003 [ 20 ]) .
the effect of antioxidants on the dpph radical - scavenging activity was attributed to their hydrogen - donating ability ( chen et al. , 2008 [ 5 ]) .
the results of the experiments to assess the dpph radical - scavenging ability of purified silymarin are presented in figure 5a ( fig. 5 ) , and compared with ascorbic acid as control standards .
the results showed that silymarin at concentrations ranging from 5 - 10 mg / l increased the radical scavenging activity on dpph from 10 % to 74 % ; which indicated that the purified silymarin has a significant concentration - dependent dpph radical - scavenging activity .
scavenging activity on hydroxyl radical hydroxyl radical , well known as the most reactive free radical , can react with almost all the biomolecules functioning in living cells in the form of abstracting hydrogen atoms , addition reactions and electron transportation ( lai et al. , 2010 [ 15 ]) .
the radical scavenging activity is not due to its direct scavenging but rather to inhibition of hydroxyl radical generation by chelating ions such as fe2 + and cu2 + ( qi et al. , 2006 [ 22 ]) .
moreover , hydroxyl radical can be generated by the reaction of fe2 + and h2o2 , and silymarin has fe2 + - chelating ability .
therefore , silymarin could reduce the generation of hydroxyl radical by chelating the fe2 + .
the results in figure 5b ( fig. 5 ) depict the measurement of the hydroxyl radical - scavenging activity of silymarin and indicated that the antioxidant activity of all the tested samples was mostly related to their concentrations .
the values of the scavenging effects ranged from 45 % to 96 % while the concentration of silymarin varied from 2 to 10 mg / ml. the result suggested that silymarin has a noticeable concentration - dependent effect on the scavenging of the hydroxyl radical .
scavenging activity on superoxide radical mitochondria produce large amounts of superoxide anion ( o22 - *) through the respiratory chain electron leakage pathways .
the o22 - * is generated in the respiratory electron transport chain , by the one - electron reduction of oxygen , when electrons leak to the o2 molecule to form the highly reactive o22 - * .
such superoxide can further enhance the oxidation of h2o2 and form hydroxyl radical (* oh ) and contribute to oxidative stress via the formation of reactive oxygen species .
we measured the scavenging activity of the different silymarin extracts on the superoxide radicals by using the nadh - pms - nbt system and ascorbic acid as control .
the test results , shown in figure 5c ( fig. 5 ) for the purified silymarin , indicated that the o22 - * radical scavenging increased from 25 % to 73 % while the concentration of purified silymarin increased from 0.2 to 2.0 mg / ml ; and also showed that silymarin extract has a significant concentration - dependent antioxidant activity .
tyrosinase inhibitory activity tyr inhibitors are chemical agents capable of reducing enzymatic reactions , such as food browning and melanization of human skin .
therefore , these agents have commercial potential in the cosmetic industries .
the result of the tyr inhibitory activity of purified silymarin is shown in figure 5d ( fig. 5 ) , and include data for quercetin which was used as a control .
the tyr inhibitory activity increased from 40 % to 70 % while the concentration of purified silymarin increased from 10 to 60 mg / ml. the results of the test system shows that silymarin extract has a significant concentration - dependent tyr inhibitory activity .
conclusion in this study , the enzyme - assisted extraction of silymarin from the silybum marianum seeds was investigated with a four - variable , three - level experiment box - behnken design based on rsm in order to optimize the silymarin extraction yield .
in addition , the silymarin antioxidant activity was evaluated using a multi - test system in vitro .
the results indicate that the enzyme - assisted method has advantages to process the seed shell silymarin - enrich extract , compared to the heating extraction from silymarin meal and it could be used as an effective method to extract silymarin from silybum marianum .
another main finding of this work is the fact that the silymarin from silybum marianum exhibited excellent antioxidant activity in the multi - test systems .
studies are in progress to further characterize the silymarin from silybum marianum and elucidate their antioxidant mechanisms .
nevertheless , the knowledge gained from this study should be useful for further exploitation and application of the resource .
on the basis of our results confirming the potent antioxidant properties of silymarin from silybum marianum and previous findings about its metal chelator activity , the silymarin extract could be beneficial to humans as a health - promoting substance against oxidative stress ; and thus useful to the antioxidant protection system in the food industry .

background grafting is a well - established technique for studying long - distance transport and signalling processes in higher plants .
while oilseed rape has been the subject of comprehensive analyses of xylem and phloem sap to identify macromolecules potentially involved in long - distance information transfer , there is currently no standardised grafting method for this species published .
results we developed a straightforward collar - free grafting protocol for brassica napus plants with high reproducibility and success rates .
micrografting of seedlings was done on filter paper .
grafting success on different types of regeneration media was measured short - term after grafting and as the long - term survival rate (> 14 days ) of grafts after the transfer to hydroponic culture or soil .
conclusions we compared different methods for grafting b. napus seedlings .
grafting on filter paper with removed cotyledons , a truncated hypocotyl and the addition of low levels of sucrose under long day conditions allowed the highest grafting success .
a subsequent long - term hydroponic cultivation of merged grafts showed highest survival rates and best reproducibility .

it has been widely applied to improve the properties of different vegetables and other horticultural crop plants [ 1 ] .
key for a successful establishment of graft unions is the formation of a continuous vascular system between the grafting partners that are usually called scion ( shoot part of the graft ) and rootstock ( root part of the graft ) .
therefore , grafting is most successful in dicotyledonous plants possessing a vascular cambium and more difficult or even impossible in monocotyledonous plants .
because of the reunion of functional xylem and phloem connections , grafting has also become an excellent experimental tool to study long - distance mobility of a wide range of molecules in living plants [ 2 ] .
grafting studies have provided conclusive evidence that long - distance transport is involved in diverse , but likewise important , physiological processes .
examples are the photoperiodic regulation of flowering [ 3 , 4 ] , the systemic spread of viruses [ 5 , 6 ] , phytohormone transport and action [ 7 ] , apical dominance [ 8 ] , nodule formation [ 9 ] , small rna movement [ 10 - 12 ] , systemic acquired resistance [ 13 , 14 ] , and systemic gene silencing [ 15 ] .
grafting methods for confirming long - distance transport of regulating molecules are established for a wide range of plant species , including nicotiana benthamiana [ 16 , 17 ] , medicago truncatula [ 18 ] , and the model species arabidopsis thaliana [ 19 - 24 ] .
these techniques have been applied successfully to study signal transduction , for example by micro rnas ( mirnas ) [ 10 , 12 , 25 , 26 ] .
brassica napus is a suitable plant for studying long - distance communication , because it allows obtaining phloem and xylem exudates in sufficient amounts for analysing sap compositions .
in this species that is related to the model plant a. thaliana , sampling is relatively easy , and sample volumes are comparably large [ 10 - 12 , 27 - 29 ] .
several studies identified hundreds of proteins and small rnas ( smrnas ) in phloem sap of b. napus [ 28 , 30 , 31 ] .
to verify their long - distance mobility in vivo , so far grafting studies between wild - type and mutants / overexpressor plants were performed in arabidopsis [ 10 , 12 ] .
the major reasons are that arabidopsis transformation is straightforward and unmatched genetic resources are publicly available .
however , the use of arabidopsis in grafting experiments to study phloem mobility does only allow indirect conclusions about the mobility of phloem - localised molecules , since phloem sampling and , thus , direct measurements of changing compound levels in phloem sap are hardly possible .
therefore , a system allowing the same type of analysis of phloem long - distance signalling in brassica would be desirable .
although not as easy as in arabidopsis , several reports describe the successful transformation of b. napus using agrobacterium tumefaciens [ 32 , 33 ] what should allow the creation of suitable transgenic plants for grafting experiments .
however , up to now only a few not very detailed grafting protocols for this species have been published in international journals [ 34 - 36 ] , and no information about efficiency and reproducibility of grafting is documented .
this study attempts to provide a robust collar - free grafting procedure for different b. napus cultivars that is useful to confirm long - distance phloem mobility of potential signalling compounds identified in isolated phloem sap from this species .
we describe an optimised flat - surface root - to - shoot grafting protocol for b. napus seedlings .
the established grafting method does not require a collar to support the graft union and enabled a high short - term ( up to 100 %) and a reasonable long - term survival rate ( 70 - 80 %) after the transfer to hydroponic culture or soil , respectively , indicating a high ability for the formation of functional vascular connections .
this was confirmed by following the movement of the phloem - specific fluorescence dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate ( cfda ) through the established graft unions .

the ph was adjusted to 4.7 with 37 % hcl cfda solution 5 mg cfda were solved in 100 microl 100 % dmso .
for plant application a 1:100 dilution in deionized water is used .
brassica napusseeds can be obtained commercially and from various breeders and research laboratories .
this protocol is optimised for the drakkar and licosmos cultivars .
procedure critical step good sterilisation is necessary to prevent bacterial or fungal contaminations during graft recovery .
all work should be done under a sterile laminar flow cabinet .
seed sterilisation and germination timing ~ 1 h ( for sterilisation , depending on the amount of seeds ) , 6 days ( for germination ) sterilisation solution should be prepared freshly .
seeds are incubated for 2 min in 2 ml 100 % ethanol and subsequently surface sterilised with 2 ml sterilisation solution for 15 min and then washed with sterile water three times for 10 min [ 37 ] .
a better washing can be achieved by shaking the reaction tube containing the seeds .
transfer the sterilised seeds to the germination plate ( 6 - 8 seeds per plate ) and incubate the plates at 4 degreesc in the dark for 3 days in a vertical orientation .
after 3 days incubate the plates under short day conditions ( light : 8 h , dark : 16 h , light intensity 100 mumol m - 2 s - 1 , 22 degreesc and a relative humidity of 70 %) in a growth chamber and store the plates in a vertical orientation .
after approx. 6 days old 3 - 5 cm long seedlings were used for grafting .
plant grafting timing ~ 1 h ( for 40 grafts ) , 14 days ( for regeneration ) 4 .
cut up to four seedlings on a cutting plate ( petri dish with a round whatman filter paper moistened with sterile water ) with a razor blade under a binocular microscope .
remove cotyledons as well as 1 - 2 cm of the middle of the hypocotyl of the seedlings ( fig. 1 ). fig. 1 grafting procedure of b. napus seedlings .
3 day old b. napus seedlings were first transferred to a cutting plate covered with moistened filter paper ( a ) .
after removing of the cotyledons with a razor blade ( b ) , 1 - 2 cm of the middle of the hypocotyls where removed ( c , d ) .
finally the cut plant parts [ shoot ( s1 and s2 ) and root ( r1 and r2 )] were transported to a regeneration plate ( e ) and joined using tweezers ( f ) .
therefore the shoot of the one seedling ( s1 ) were connected to the root of the other plant ( r2 ) 5 .
join the cut plant parts on a regeneration plate with the respective regeneration conditions using forceps .
close the regeneration plates with parafilm and incubate them under short day conditions with plates in a vertical orientation ( 5degrees - 10degrees ) .
check the grafts after 6 , 10 and 14 days .
critical step in contrast to the protocol from marsch - martinez [ 24 ] optimal cutting of hypocotyls and cotyledons can be achieved on a moistened filter paper , propably due to the higher stiffness of b. napus plants compared to a. thaliana .
another difference to this protocol is the removal of the central part of the hypocotyl .
in brassica , the fast longitudinal growth of the seedlings hindered a successful graft formation when this step was omitted .
attention needs to be paid when joining the cut scion and root that no water film is within the parts .
ecotypes with an increased longitudinal growth direction like drakkar should be regenerated for 14 days since the graft junction is fairly instable .
ecotypes like licosmos with a reduced longitudinal growth can be regenerated for only 10 days .
post - grafting cultivation timing 14 days ( for regeneration ) , 30 min ( for cfda monitoring ) 6 .
for hydroponic cultivation 14 day old grafts are transferred to 50 ml conical tubes ( fig. 3a ) and grown in boxes using the hydroponic medium described in buhtz et al .
[ 12 ] .
for this purpose , wrap black foam around the grafted plant with the graft junction located in the middle of the foam .
cover the sides of the conical tubes with aluminium foil and fill in 40 ml of hydroponic medium to reduce algal growth .
7. place the wrapped graft in the conical tube in such a way that the foam does not get in contact with the medium , but holds the graft in place and store the tubes in a rack ( additional file 3 : figure s3 ) .
8. place the rack in a standard polystyrene box with at least the same height or higher than the grafted plants .
a box of 32 cm x 25 cm x 17 cm ( length , width , height ) is sufficient for cultivation of ca .
30 plants ( additional file 3 : figure s3 ) .
cover the box with a light permissive plastic cover .
for a simple set - up use plastic wrap and puncture up to 20 small holes for ca .
12 plants to allow adequate aeration .
cultivate the covered grafts for 10 - 14 days .
9. for soil cultivation the plants should be well - watered .
cover the transferred grafts with a plastic cover to avoid dehydration of the plantlets .
grafts are cultivated under long day conditions in a growth chamber ( light : 16 h , dark : 8 h , light intensity of 80 mumol m - 2 s - 1 , 22 degreesc and a relative humidity of 60 % ; fig. 3 ) .
after 14 days plants can be grown in the greenhouse either hydroponically in single pots or on soil .
critical step if hydroponic growth is favoured , precautions have to be taken to reduce algal growth .
therefore cover all conical tubes with aluminium foil .
also ensure that the graft junction has no contact to the hydroponic medium to minimise the formation of adventitious roots .
puncturing the cover lid or loosely covering the plants helps to achieve an appropriate aeration without letting the plantlets dry out .
chen et al .
[ 37 ] describe a similar method for arabidopsis grafts , but due to the larger size of grafted b. napus plants a floating system as described is not applicable .
furthermore we observed that taking care that the foam is not in contact with the hydroponic medium avoids the formation of adventitious roots .
to prevent a drying - out of freshly transferred grafts to soil or hydroponic medium it is advisable to cover those plants with a light permissive plastic cover , in addition to the high humidity set in the growth chamber .
10. the success of the formation of functional vascular connections within the grafts can be monitored using carboxyfluorescein diacetate , a phloem - specific fluorescence dye , as described in grignon et al .
1989 [ 38 ] .
grafted plants were transferred to agar plates containing ( 1 / 2 ) ms and 1 % ( w / v ) agar to prevent drying - out .
one leave per plant is punctured and a few microliters of a 10 microm cfda solution are applied .
after an incubation of 30 min at ambient temperature , fluorescence can be observed under a fluorescence stereomicroscope equipped with a gfp filter ( fig. 4 ) .
results and discussion grafting conditions were optimised for b. napus seedlings to improve the survival rate of grafts .
in contrast to other studies , we followed grafting success over a longer time period until grafted plants were successfully transferred to hydroponic culture or to soil .
obviously , success rates are lower at a later time - point than after a few days .
however , since our goal was to transfer stable grafts to hydroponic culture or soil to let the plants grow until sampling of phloem and xylem sap is possible , it is the more meaningful measure in this case .
plants with a non - functional vascular system are prone to die within 2 weeks of post - grafting cultivation .
since initial experiments showed that graft formation was more successful under short day than under long day conditions , all further experiments were performed in growth chambers with 8 h light and 16 h dark .
as shown in fig. 2b , there were significant differences in successful graft formation between conditions with and without additional sucrose .
sucrose - treated grafts showed higher survival rates ( 80 - 100 %) and a higher reproducibility when compared to sucrose - free conditions .
furthermore , the sucrose - treated grafts were much larger on agar plates and on filter paper , looked healthier , and the more stable graft connections allowed easier handling of grafts ( fig. 2a ) .
because of this , grafts treated with sucrose were more often successfully transferred to hydroponic culture or soil ( fig. 3a , b ) .
success rates ranged between 70 and 80 % ( figs. 2b , 3c ) .
again , regeneration without sucrose led to a high variability in survival rates after the transfer to either hydroponics or soil ( fig. 3c ) .
the reason was that sucrose - treated grafts were less prone to breakage of the graft unions during transfer .
this observation corresponds to results recently reported for a. thaliana where also 0.5 % sucrose improved grafting success in cotyledon - less grafts [ 24 ] .
adventitious root formation , as described to be problematic in arabidopsis and other species [ 2 , 12 , 39 ] , was no problem in brassica grafts , no matter whether they were supplied with sucrose or not .
orienting the plates slightly vertically ( 5degrees - 10degrees ) increased grafting success by reducing bending of hypocotyls and thus facilitating orientation of the grafting partners , as also observed in arabidopsis [ 24 , 39 ] .
experiments performed with another b. napus cultivar ( cv. licosmos ) confirmed the results obtained in cv. drakkar , but licosmos seedlings were in general smaller and even less delicate to handle ( see additional file 1 : figure s1 , additional file 2 : figure s2 , additional file 3 : figure s3 ). fig. 2 14 day old grafts of b. napus cv. drakkar after different regeneration conditions .
a overview of successfully grafted plants regenerated under different conditions after 14 days .
the arrow indicates the graft junction .
b survival rate of grafted plants upon different regeneration conditions : ( 1 / 2 ) ms 1 % agar 0.5 % sucrose ( n = 53 ) ; ( 1 / 2 ) ms 1 % agar ( n = 63 ) ; ddh2o ( n = 91 ) ; 0.5 % sucrose ( n = 51 ) .
grafting success was investigated after 6 , 10 and 14 days and plotted is the relative survivability of grafted plants under different regeneration conditions fig. 3 post - grafting cultivation of 14 day old b. napus cv. drakkar grafts .
for further cultivation of grafts the plants were transferred to hydroponic culture or soil .
for hydroponic cultivation the grafted plants were wrapped in black sponge , in which the graft junction was positioned in the middle and transferred to a 50 ml - falcon tube consisting 40 ml medium ( a ) .
for cultivation on soil grafts were transferred to well - watered soil , in which the graft junction was free of soil ( red arrow ) and stabilized by a plastic plant label ( b ) .
comparison of graft survival rates after hydroponic and soil cultivation ( c ) .
survivability was determined after 14 days post - cultivation .
( 1 / 2 ) ms 1 % agar 0.5 % sucrose ( hydroponic n = 22 ; soil n = 23 ) ; ( 1 / 2 ) ms 1 % agar ( hydroponic n = 17 ; soil n = 18 ) ; ddh2o ( hydroponic n = 18 ; soil n = 21 ; 0.5 % sucrose ( hydroponic n = 23 ; soil n = 21 ) in contrast to other published grafting procedures for b. napus [ 34 - 36 ] this work provides an easy and robust protocol for routine grafting with high success rates .
collar - free grafting is easier to handle and less laborious .
when germination , grafting and graft generation are carried out under at least semi - sterile conditions , grafting success was significantly increased by minimising contamination of the graft junctions .
another advantage of our protocol is its applicability to mid - to high - throughput , as transport studies often require high numbers of grafted plants to allow statistically relevant conclusions .
in parallel experiments performed with arabidopsis seedlings ( data not shown ) it could be observed that grafting on filter paper was more successful than grafting on agar plates .
also here , sucrose enhanced size and fitness of the grafts , but led to a slightly higher formation of adventitious roots in this species .
generally , too much moisture hindered successful formation of graft unions and water films on both agar plates and filter paper in all types of grafting experiments performed .
a similar observation was made in recent arabidopsis grafting experiments [ 24 ] .
the establishment of functional vascular connections was first checked using the phloem - accumulating fluorescence dye cfda .
figure 4 shows that most viable grafts disposed of functional vascular connections that allowed movement of cfda , while a few did not allow long - distance movement of cfda .
these grafts did not survive long - term .
since one major aim of our study was to produce grafts for xylem and phloem sampling , we tested whether 10 - week - old grafted plants allow sampling of xylem and phloem sap .
an example of phloem sap exuding from a grafted plant is shown in fig. 5. exudation can be observed after small incisions were applied with a syringe needle as first described in giavalisco et al .
[ 28 ] .
we could not detect any difference in xylem or phloem sampling ( concerning e.g. sap quantity or duration of exudation ) when comparing grafted with non - grafted plants , what demonstrates the suitability of our grafting protocol for long - distance transport studies. fig. 4 analysing graft junction formation by cfda staining .
14 day old grafts were transferred to a plate containing ( 1 / 2 ) ms and 1 % agar and stained with the phloem - mobile fluorochrome cfda .
therefore a leaf of the grafts was punctured with a sterile needle ( red arrow ) and a few microliters of cfda stain were applied at the point of lesion ( a ) .
after an incubation of 30 min at room temperature the plants were investigated under a fluorescence binocular using bright field ( a - c ) and fluorescence illumination with a gfp filter ( d - f ) .
while in successfully grafted plants the cfda stain passed the graft junction ( e ) , it accumulated in the scion part of the graft , when graft formation was not effective ( f ) fig. 5 phloem sap sampling from grafted b. napus plants .
10 - week - old grafted plants were punctured with a hypodermic needle below the inflorescence as first described by giavalisco et al .
[ 28 ] .
the white arrow indicates droplets of phloem sap after puncturing .
for phloem sample collection the first droplet is discarded due to the danger of contamination by the content of injured cells .
several hundred microliters of phloem sap could be collected per plant independent on whether they were grafts or not conclusions grafting is a versatile tool to study long - distance mobility of potential signalling compounds .
the development of optimised protocols that allow reliable grafting with high success rates is essential to obtain reasonable and reproducible results .
in this study we present a simple and efficient grafting procedure for b. napus that in routine application allows a short - term survival rate of 80 - 100 % and still 70 - 80 % after transfer to hydroponic culture or soil , respectively .
this demonstrates that b. napus is highly suitable for performing transport studies using the easy grafting procedure presented here. that is important , because b. napus is already used as a suitable model plant for xylem sap and phloem sap analyses due to the relatively easy access to quite large sample volumes from both long - distance transport systems .
long - term survival rates on hydroponic culture or soil enable the growth of grafts until the time - point suitable for phloem sap sampling .
therefore , in contrast to grafting studies in model plants like arabidopsis , brassica grafting studies do not only allow indirect conclusions of phloem mobility of potential signalling compounds , but their direct detection in collected phloem samples .

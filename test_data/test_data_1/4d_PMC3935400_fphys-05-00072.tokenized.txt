dopamine plays a number of important physiological roles .
however , activation of dopamine receptor type - 5 ( dr5 ) and its effect in renal epithelial cells have not been studied .
here , we show for the first time that dr5 is localized to primary cilia of llcpk kidney cells .
renal epithelial cilia are mechanosensory organelles that sense and respond to tubular fluid - flow in the kidney .
to determine the roles of dr5 and sensory cilia , we used dopamine to non - selectively and fenoldopam to selectively activate ciliary dr5 .
compared to mock treatment , dopamine treated cells significantly increases the length of cilia .
fenoldopam further increases the length of cilia compared to dopamine treated cells .
the increase in cilia length also increases the sensitivity of the cells in response to fluid - shear stress .
the graded responses to dopamine - and fenoldopam - induced increase in cilia length further show that sensitivity to fluid - shear stress correlates to the length of cilia .
together , our studies suggest for the first time that dopamine or fenoldopam is an exciting agent that enhances structure and function of primary cilia .
we further propose that dopaminergic agents can be used in " cilio - therapy " to treat diseases associated with abnormal cilia structure and / or function .
mechanotransduction fluid shear stress mechanosensation pharmacology physiology introduction dopamine is an endogenous catecholamine hormone that produces a range of effects in the nervous , immune , cardiovascular , and renal systems .
although classically produced in the brain and adrenal gland , dopamine is also biosynthesized in renal proximal tubules ( goldstein et al. , 1972 ; baines and chan , 1980 ; zimlichman et al. , 1988 ) .
the five g - coupled protein dopamine receptors ( dr ) are categorized into d1 - like ( dr1 and dr5 ) and d2 - like ( dr2 , dr3 , and dr4 ) families ( sibley and monsma , 1992 ) .
the role of dopamine in the renal system includes inhibition of na + reabsorption and blood pressure regulation through d1 - like receptor activation ( mcdonald et al. , 1964 ) .
thus , the expression of both dr1 and dr5 in the kidney implies a profound role for both d1 - like receptors in the renal dopaminergic system ( felder et al. , 1984 , 1989 ; yamaguchi et al. , 1993 ) .
however , the activation of dr5 in renal epithelial cells has not yet been studied .
primary cilia are small membrane enclosed , hair - like structures that extend from the cell 's apical surface .
in renal tubules , cilia function as sensory organelles that initiate an increase in cytosolic calcium in response to tubular fluid - flow ( nauli et al. , 2003 ) .
cilia dysfunction perturbs calcium responsiveness and is causal to renal disorders such as polycystic kidney disease ( pkd ) .
cardiovascular abnormalities including hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy significantly contribute to mortality in pkd patients ( fick et al. , 1995 ) .
therefore , renal dopaminergic control of blood pressure remains an understudied aspect of ciliopathies such as pkd .
as chemosensory organelles , primary cilia depend on various receptors to be expressed on the ciliary membrane .
this includes dopaminergic receptors , which are g - protein - couple receptors ( abdul - majeed and nauli , 2011 ) .
as mechanosensory organelles , primary cilia also depend on the expression of mechanosensitive molecules in the ciliary membrane .
some of these examples include mechanosensory polycystin - 1 and sensory calcium channel polycystin - 2 ( nauli et al. , 2003 ) .
it is generally accepted that fluid - shear stress will bend primary cilia and activated polycystins complex .
activation of polycystins can induce calcium influx into cilioplasm ( jin et al. , 2013 ) .
this ciliary calcium is further amplified through calcium - induced calcium release mechanism , resulting in an increase in the overall cytosolic calcium ( nauli et al. , 2003 ; jin et al. , 2013 ) .
as sensory organelles , primary cilia are viewed as compartments for sensory proteins ( nauli et al. , 2011a,b ) .
thus , a larger compartment would assume to " house " more sensory proteins .
as the result , it has been hypothesized that longer cilia tend to be more sensitive in chemo or mechanical - sensing .
however , there was no hypothetical model that had shown this previously .
our studies thus showed the relationship between cilia length - function for the very first time in porcine kidney proximal tubule cells ( llcpk ) .
materials and methods cell culture pharmacology llcpk cells plated on sterile glass - bottom plates were cultured to a confluent monolayer in dulbecco 's modified eagle medium ( dmem ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum at 37degreesc in 5 % co2 .
serum was then withdrawn from cells to allow differentiation .
a faster differentiation could be achieved by cell - cell contact inhibiting cell growth and / or withdrawing serum from the cell culture media .
because only fully - differentiated cells have well - developed cilia , cell differentiation can be validated by immunostaining of the sensory proteins in the cilia or responsiveness of the cells to fluid - shear stress .
we have previously discussed cell differentiation in details ( nauli et al. , 2013 ) .
once differentiated , dopamine or fenoldopam ( sigmaaldrich , inc. ) were gently added to culture plates to achieve 1 nm to 10 mum final concentrations for 16 h in the absence of serum .
for control experiments , vehicle alone was added to cells in the same manner and volume as those contained pharmacological agents .
immunofluorescence immunostaining was performed before and after flow experiments .
cells were fixed for 10 min ( 4 % paraformaldehyde / 2 % sucrose in pbs ) and permeabilized for 5 min ( 10 % triton x - 100 ) .
primary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at the following concentrations : acetylated alpha - tubulin at 1:5000 ( sigmaaldrich , inc. ) , dr5 at 1:500 ( emd millipore , inc. ) .
cells were then incubated with fluorescent - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1:500 ) as indicated in the text and mounted with dapi hard set mounting media ( vectorlabs , inc. ) .
cilia length measurements primary cilia are composed of acetylated microtubule structures and were measured by direct immunofluorescence with acetylated alpha - tubulin staining ( abdul - majeed and nauli , 2011 ). through calibrated image acquisition and analysis using metamorph software , primary cilia length was recorded .
for statistical purposes , 40 cilia were measured for each treatment group .
cytosolic calcium measurements cells were incubated with fluo2 - am ( 5 mum ; 30 min ; 39degreesc ) .
cells were then washed of residual dye and acclimated to allow complete ester hydrolysis .
cells were observed under a 40x objective lens with a nikon eclipse te2000 - u microscope controlled by metafluor software .
cytosolic calcium was observed by recording calcium - bound fluo2 excitation fluorescence at 488 nm and emission at 515 nm , as previously described ( nauli et al. , 2008 ; aboualaiwi et al. , 2009 ; muntean et al. , 2010 ; abdul - majeed and nauli , 2011 ) .
baseline calcium was observed for 10 min prior to data acquisition and then cells were subjected fluid - shear stress as indicated in the text .
after each experiment , the maximum calcium signal was obtained by perfusion of ionomycin ( 10 mu m final concentration ) followed by addition of egta ( 2 mm final concentration ) to observe maximum and minimum calcium signals for normalization purpose .
conditions for all experiments were maintained at 37degreesc and 5 % co2 in an environmental chamber ( in vivo scientific , inc. ) .
perfusion cells were grown on customized culture plates to allow enable perfusate influx and efflux ( aboualaiwi et al. , 2009 ; aboualaiwi et al. , 2014 ) .
fluid - shear stress was then applied to cells utilizing an instech p720 peristaltic pump .
we have previously calculated that kidney tubules experience shear - stress in a range of 0.2 to 20 dyne / cm2 , depending on the rates of urine production ( nauli et al. , 2006 ) .
to reflect physiological conditions , perfused fluid was therefore pumped into the cell culture dish and retained at shear stress of 0.8 dyne / cm2 .
statistical analysis cilia length measurements consisted of n = 40 for each experimental group .
cytosolic calcium measurements consisted of n = 3 for each treatment .
all data are reported as mean +/ - standard error of mean with statistical power greater than 0.8 at p < 0.05 .
data were then analyzed utilizing anova test followed by tukey post - test .
analysis of data was performed with prism graphpad 5 software .
results primary cilia are critical sensory organelles , and cilia dysfunction inhibits renal cells from responding to fluid - flow ( nauli et al. , 2003 ) .
although the chemosensory roles of cilia have been proposed ( goetz and anderson , 2010 ) , most studies have focused only on developmental signaling pathways .
thus , much less is known about the structure - function relationship regarding primary cilia in the kidney .
we previously showed that dopamine - receptor type 5 ( dr5 ) localized to primary cilia in endothelial cells ( abdul - majeed and nauli , 2011 ) .
in this study , we discovered that dr5 also co - localized to the primary cilia in kidney proximal tubule cells ( llcpk ) ( figure 1a ) .
figure 1 activation of dr5 increases primary cilia length of renal epithelial cells .
( a ) dopamine receptor type 5 ( dr5 ; green ) was localized to primary cilia of llcpk cells .
the cells were counterstained with ciliary marker acetylated alpha - tubulin ( acet - alpha - tub ; red ) , and nuclear marker ( dapi ; blue ) .
bar = 10 mum .
( b ) dopamine and fenoldopam increased length primary cilia in renal epithelial cells .
primary cilia were observed with ciliary marker , acetylated alpha - tubulin , in llcpk cells .
after treated with mock ( control ) , dopamine ( da ) , or fenoldopam ( fd ) for 16 h , cells were fixed and cilia length was observed and measured with fluorescence microscope .
bar = 5 mum .
( c ) cilia length was significantly longer in epithelial cells treated with dopamine or fenoldopam .
cilia measurement was made from 4 preparations in each group , and at least 10 cilia were randomly selected in each preparation .
the graph shows individual values of cilia length from measurements made in cells treated with mock ( control ) , dopamine ( da ) , or fenoldopam ( fd ) .
asterisks denote significant difference at p < 0.05 .
n = 40 .
to study the dopaminergic effect on primary cilia in llcpk cells , we measured cilia length through immunofluorescent staining ( figure 1b ) .
the average cilia length was observed to be 3.3 +/ - 0.3 mum .
when treated with 10 mu m dopamine , cilia length was significantly increased to 7.8 +/ - 0.7 mum within 16 h. as dopamine is a general activator of d1 - like dopamine receptors ( dr1 and dr5 ) , we next used fenoldopam to activate ciliary dr5 .
after a 16 - h treatment with 10 mu m fenoldopam , cilia length was significantly increased to 11.8 +/ - 0.7 mum within 16 h. data analysis of cilia length ( n = 40 ) revealed statistically significant differences amongst control vs. dopamine , control vs. fenoldopam , and dopamine vs. fenoldopam ( figure 1c ) .
primary cilia in renal epithelium respond to fluid - flow by initiating an influx of extracellular calcium ( nauli and zhou , 2004 ) .
we thus measured cytosolic calcium by incubating cells with calcium - specific indicator , fluo2 and recording the calcium - bound emission signal .
to mimic physiological conditions , cells were then subjected to fluid - shear stress at 0.8 dyne / cm2 while fluorescence emission was continuously recorded ( figure 2a ) .
to examine the effect of increased cilia length on calcium influx , cells were treated for 16 h with dopamine or fenoldopam prior to loading with fluo2 .
pre - treatment with either dopamine or fenoldopam was found to significantly enhance the cellular calcium response to fluid - shear stress compared to control cells ( figure 2b ) .
there was no statistical difference between dopamine and fenoldopam treated groups ( figure 2c ) .
figure 2 flow - induced calcium signaling is significantly greater in epithelial cells treated with dopamine or fenoldopam .

( b ) cilia function was assessed from 3 to 4 preparations in each group , and at least 10 cells were randomly selected in each preparation .
after treated with mock ( control ) , dopamine ( da ) , or fenoldopam ( fd ) for 16 h , cells were challenged with fluid - shear stress .

( c ) peak calcium changes were averaged in cells treated with mock , dopamine , or fenoldopam .
asterisks denote significant difference at p < 0.05 .
n = 3 .
to enable us to study cilia length - function relationship , we next examined the association between cilia length and cilia function , in terms of calcium influx in response to fluid - flow .
we performed more robust logarithmic or graded dopaminergic - induced responses on cilia length ( figure 3a ) .
in dose - response curve , effect of fenoldopam was more potent than that of dopamine ( figure 3b ) .
similarly , we performed logarithmic or graded responses on cilia function ( figure 3c ) .
based on the sigmoidal - relationship curve , we observed no difference in the efficacy or potency between dopamine and fenoldopam ( figure 3d ) .
figure 3 function of primary cilia as sensory organelles depends on the length of cilia .
( a ) hyperbolic curves indicated a positive correlation between cilia length and dopamine or fenoldopam .
averaged cilia length is shown from cells treated with dopamine or fenoldopam at 1 nm to 10 mu m .
( b ) sigmoidal curves were generated with logarithmic transformation to indicate a cause - and - effect relationship between cilia length and dopamine or fenoldopam .
( c ) hyperbolic curves indicated a positive correlation between cilia function and dopamine or fenoldopam .
cilia function was demonstrated by calcium signaling induced by fluid - shear stress .
averaged cilia function is shown from cells treated with dopamine or fenoldopam at 1 nm to 10 mu m .
( d ) sigmoidal curves were generated with logarithmic transformation to indicate a cause - and - effect relationship between cilia function and dopamine or fenoldopam .
( e ) peak calcium changes were averaged in cells treated with mock ( control ) , dopamine , or fenoldopam at 1 nm to 10 mu m. a hyperbolic curve indicates a positive correlation between cilia length and function .
asterisks denote significant difference at p < 0.05 .
n = 28 for each dopamine or fenoldopam treatment. through extension of our graded - response curves , an increase in cilia length was observed to correlate with cilia function ( figure 3e ) .
the graded response in dopaminergic - induced cells demonstrated a relationship between cilia length and cilia function , as indicated by the hyperbolic curve .
thus , this analysis revealed that cilia function is correlated to cilia length .
discussion in the present studies , we used logarithmic concentrations of both dopamine and fenoldopam to facilitate us to understand the relationship between cilia length and function ( figure 4 ) .
these curves are classical pharmacological means to understand effects of pharmacological agents on cellular responses ( nauli et al. , 2005 ) .
in the present study , we hypothesized that dopaminergic agents altered cilia structure and function .
because calcium signaling within a cilium has been shown to alter cilia length ( abdul - majeed et al. , 2012 ; jin et al. , 2013 ) and cytosolic calcium has been demonstrated to reflect cilia function ( nauli et al. , 2008 ) , we generated a model that guided us to understand cilia structure - function via calcium signaling in response to dopaminergic agonists .
we thus propose that dopaminergic agonist can modulate cilia function by extending cilia length .
figure 4 cilia length and function relationship is reflected by calcium signaling curves .
the roles of fenoldopam or dopamine on cellular responses to fluid - shear stress is a composite of interaction among intracellular calcium signaling , cilia length , and cilia function .
the independent functions of pharmacological agents on length - calcium and calcium - function can thus be summed algebraically to yield cilia length - function relationship .
endogenous dopamine neurotransmission signaling regulates many homeostatic functions ( sibley and monsma , 1992 ) .
since the discovery that the renal system biosynthesizes and utilizes dopamine independent of the nervous system , there has been significant interest in understanding the renal dopaminergic system ( carey , 2013 ) .
in regards to the renal system , dopamine has been shown to increase natriuresis through prevention of tubular na + reabsorption by activation of d1 - like dr ( hughes et al. , 1986 ) .
thus , it has been proposed that the renal dopaminergic system plays an important role in systemic blood pressure regulation through dr1 and dr5 .
pkd is one example of renal disorders that results in hypertension .
in healthy renal tissue , primary cilia respond to fluid - flow by initiating an increase in cytosolic calcium .
in pkd , on the other hand , primary cilia dysfunction leads to a reduction of intracellular calcium ( nauli et al. , 2003 ) .
further , pkd is the very first hypertensive disorder to be associated with abnormal primary cilia ( nauli et al. , 2008 ; aboualaiwi et al. , 2009 ) .
although both d1 - like dopamine receptors ( dr1 and dr5 ) have been identified in proximal tubules , there has not been much work focusing on dr5 in renal dopaminergic signaling .
our study presents data to support the role for dr5 in renal dopaminergic signaling and cilia function .
this may also help explain the clinical efficacy of fenoldopam , which is currently used as a treatment option for essential hypertension ( carey et al. , 1984 ) .
thus , by increasing cilia length fenoldopam is able to increase cilia function which may ultimately influence systemic blood pressure .
in this study , we show for the first time that dr5 localized to primary cilia in renal proximal epithelia .
when d1 - like receptors were activated by treatment with dopamine , the length of primary cilia was significantly increased. by selectively activating ciliary dr5 with fenoldopam , cilia length was further increased compared to both control and dopamine treatment .
this data suggests that ciliary dr5 may contribute to more specific regulation on primary cilia than other drs .
in response to fluid - flow , intracellular calcium levels were found to be increased after cells were treated with either dopamine or fenoldopam .
as the perfusate did not contain pharmacological agents , the increased sensitivity to fluid - flow can be attributed to the increase in cilia length .
therefore , by increasing cilia length , overall cilia function was increased as well .
to further test this hypothesis , intracellular calcium was graphed as a function of cilia length , which resulted in a positive correlation .
this suggests that in our experiments , cilia length could modulate cilia function .
the ciliary role of dr5 is of further significance given the fact that d1 - like receptors are expressed in low level in renal proximal tubules ( o'connell et al. , 1998 ) .
thus , the primary cilium may be an important central compartment that concentrates dopaminergic signaling , more specifically for dr5 .
without doubt , there are many more interesting future experiments brought up by our studies .
for examples , the numbers of receptors in the longer cilia will be needed to confirm .
the mechanism by which dopaminergic agonist induced longer cilia needs to be further understood .
an in vivo model may further shed some light into translational importance of our studies .
overall , our current studies provide evidence for the first time that dopamine or fenoldopam enhances both the structure and function of primary cilia .

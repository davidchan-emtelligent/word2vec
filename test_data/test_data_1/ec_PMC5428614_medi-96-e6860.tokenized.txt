http :// creativecommons.org / licenses / by / 4.0 supplemental digital content is available in the text abstract background : cyclin b plays a crucial role in cancer cell cycle progression and is overexpressed in many human cancers , including breast cancer .
however , the prognostic value of cyclin b expression in breast cancer is controversial .
we performed a meta - analysis to assess the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of cyclin b expression in breast cancer .
methods : we searched pubmed , web of science , and embase databases to retrieve the publications investigating the association between cyclin b expression and clinicopathological / prognostic significance in breast cancer patients .
the pooled hazard ratio ( hr ) or odds ratio ( or ) with its 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were used to estimate the effects .
results : ten studies with 2366 breast cancer patients were included to evaluate the association between cyclin b expression and overall survival ( os ) , disease - free survival ( dfs ) , disease - specific survival ( dss ) , and clinicopathological parameters .
the results showed that cyclin b overexpression in breast cancer patients was significantly associated with both poor os ( univariate analysis : hr = 2.38 , 95 % ci = 1.72 - 3.30 , p < . 001 ) , dfs ( univariate analysis : hr = 1.86 , 95 % ci = 1.50 - 2.32 , p < . 001 ; multivariate analysis : hr = 1.75 , 95 % ci = 1.22 - 2.52 , p = . 003 ) , and dss ( multivariate analysis : hr = 5.42 , 95 % ci = 2.15 - 13.66 , p < . 001 ) .
additionally , cyclin b overexpression was significantly associated with lymphatic invasion ( or = 2.58 , 95 % ci = 1.03 - 6.46 , p = . 017 ) .
conclusion : cyclin b overexpression appears to be an independent potential prognostic marker to dss and dfs for breast cancer .
further studies with large sample size are needed to dissect the relationship between cyclin b and clinicopathological features or prognosis of breast cancer .
keywords breast cancer clinicopathology cyclin b prognosis open - accesstrue 1 introduction as one of the most common cancers worldwide , breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among females. [ 1 ] with rapid improvements in treatment and early detection , breast cancer death rates decreased by 34 % from 1990 to 2010. [ 2 ] so far , biomarkers like er , pr , and her2 have been found to divide breast cancer into different subtypes and to predict the prognosis of patients. [ 3 ] however , intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer still complicates diagnosis , challenges therapy , and eventually affects patients' survival. [ 4,5 ] so , more reliable biomarkers are required to identify patients at higher risk and to select the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient .
cell cycle checkpoints are critical elements in controlling cell proliferation .
key events in the cell cycle are regulated by the cyclin dependent kinases ( cdks ) , which are activated by binding specific cyclins. [ 6 ] specific cyclin levels peak at specific times during the cell cycle and produce successive waves of cyclin - cdk activity to regulate the cell cycle events. [ 7 ] the cyclin b cluster , which includes cyclin b1 and cyclin b2 in human being , is a subunit of cdk1 and governs the entry into mitosis. [ 8 - 12 ] cyclin b is synthesized in late s and g2 phases .
cyclin b / cdk1 complex keeps inactive until it is activated by the cdc25 phosphatase family in prophase , which plays an important role in g2 - m phase transition. [ 9,12 - 14 ] overexpression of cyclin b has proved to drive tumorigenesis in many tumors , including breast cancer. [ 15,16 ] many studies have evaluated the relationship between the expression of cyclin b and survival in breast cancer patients .
however , the results of these studies vary from each other , and no consensus has been reached yet .
to draw a more precise conclusion , we have therefore undertaken a meta - analysis to assess the role of cyclin b expression as clinicopathological and prognostic molecular marker in breast cancer .
2 material and methods 2.1 search strategy we searched pubmed , web of science , and embase databases for articles published up to november 1 , 2015 that met the following search criteria : cyclin b or ccnb and breast neoplasm or neoplasm , breast or neoplasms , breast or tumors , breast or breast tumors or breast tumor or tumor , breast or mammary neoplasms , human or human mammary neoplasm or human mammary neoplasms or neoplasm , human mammary or neoplasms , human mammary or mammary neoplasm , human or mammary carcinoma , human or carcinoma , human mammary or carcinomas , human mammary or human mammary carcinomas or mammary carcinomas , human or human mammary carcinoma or breast cancer or cancer , breast or cancer of breast or mammary cancer or malignant neoplasm of breast or malignant tumor of breast or breast carcinoma or cancer of the breast .
the studies were limited to human subjects. and there is no language restriction in the literature search .
retrieved papers were independently screened by 2 authors ( sun and zhang ) according to the title , abstract , and type of article , and irrelevant papers were excluded .
in addition , the references of identified studies were reviewed to include potentially eligible studies .
systematic review does not involve animal and human experiments , so this article does not require ethical approval .
2.2 inclusion / exclusion criteria the following criteria were set and reviewed by 2 independent authors ( sun and zhang ) : cyclin b expression of breast carcinoma was assessed by immunohistochemistry ; articles were published as full paper ; odds ratios ( ors ) for estimating clinicopathological characteristics were provided or extractable from the original articles ; sufficient information was provided to estimate the relation between cyclin b expression and hazard ratios ( hrs ) of breast neoplasms ; when generating hr from published kaplan - meier curves , the reported minimum and maximum follow - up times and numbers of people in each arm are needed in these articles ; the study reporting the largest dataset was included if several publications reported data from overlapping samples ; and only retrospective or prospective cohort studies were included .
2.3 data extraction two authors ( sun and zhang ) independently extracted the following data : first author , publication year , country , sample size , cut - off values , clinicopathological and prognostic characteristics , duration of follow - up , and other relevant data .
disagreements between reviewers were resolved by discussion .
2.4 quality assessment two authors ( sun and zhang ) independently evaluated the methodological quality of all included studies using newcastle - ottawa scale ( nos ),[ 17 ] and the discrepancy was resolved by discussion .
each study in this meta - analysis was categorized with the nos system , which is comprised of 3 dimensions ( selection of cohort , comparability of cohort , and ascertainment of outcome ) .
the nos , a star system , ranges from 0 to 9 stars , with more stars indicating a better quality .
all of the included studies were awarded 7 or 8 stars in total .
2.5 statistical analysis the ors with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals ( cis ) were used to assess the relationship between cyclin b expression and clinicopathological characteristics in patients with breast neoplasms .
the clinicopathological characteristics extracted by meta - analysis included : the presence or absence of lymphatic invasion ; clinical stage i and stage ii versus stage iii and stage iv ; tumor grade 1 and grade 2 versus grade 3 and grade 4 ; tumor size larger than 2 cm versus less than 2 cm ; age more than 50 versus less than 50 years ; er positive or negative ; pr positive or negative ; and her - 2 positive or negative .
for prognosis , we used the hrs with corresponding 95 % cis to estimate the effect of cyclin b expression on survival rates .
we directly extracted hrs with corresponding 95 % cis if they were provided in the original articles .
otherwise , the methods described by parmar et al [ 18 ] and tierney et al [ 19 ] were used to calculate the data .
kaplan - meier curves were read using engauge digitizer version 4.1 ( http :// digitizer.sourceforge.net /) .
the survival data read from kaplan - meier curves were entered in the spreadsheet based on tierney when extracting the hr from published kaplan - meier curves , the reported minimum and maximum follow - up times and the reported numbers at risk are needed .
chi - square test and inconsistency index i2 were utilized to assess or quantify the heterogeneity of included studies .
if p > . 10 and i2 < 50 % , we employed the fixed - effect model , otherwise , a random effects model was used where p < . 10 or i2 > 50 % .
in order to assess the publication bias , funnel plots were used to detect underlying publication bias , with the plots' asymmetry being estimated by begger test. [ 20 ] data management and analysis were performed with stata 12.0 software ( stata co. , college station , tx ) .
3 results 3.1 search results as shown in fig. 1 , 3423 studies were initially retrieved from the databases including web of science , embase , and pubmed , of which 387 were excluded because of duplicates .
after screening the titles and abstracts , 3018 publications were excluded according to inclusion criteria. of the remaining 18 candidate articles , 3 publications provide cyclin b expression only and 5 publications , analyzing the relationship between cyclin b expression and clinicopathological / prognostic significance , could not be extracted with sufficient information .
ten eligible publications [ 21 - 30 ] were therefore included in the meta - analysis .
figure 1 flow diagram of publications searching and screening process .
3.2 study characteristics the detailed information of each study is summarized in table 1 .
ten studies , designed as retrospective cohort , investigated a total of 2366 cases from china , sweden , germany , korea , and japan .
immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess cyclin b expression in all studies. of the 10 studies included in this meta - analysis , 6 studies [ 21,24,25,27 - 29 ] investigated the association between cyclin b expression and prognostic significance , 2 studies [ 23,30 ] evaluated its clinicopathological parameters in patients with breast cancer , and 2 publications [ 22,26 ] studied both .
in these 10 studies , 3 publications [ 24,28,29 ] investigated the total cyclin b expression while 1 publication [ 22 ] studied the cyclin b2 expression and 6 publications [ 21,23,25 - 27,30 ] studied the cyclin b1 expression .
table 1 clinicopathological and methodological features of eligible studies .
3.3 impact of cyclin b expression on survival rates of patients with breast cancer as shown in table 2 and fig. 2 , meta - analysis of 4 studies [ 21,26 - 28 ] on the prognostic value of cyclin b expression indicated that high level of cyclin b was associated with poor overall survival ( os , univariate analysis : hr = 2.38 , 95 % ci = 1.72 - 3.30 ) , without significant heterogeneity between studies ( i2 = 0 % , p = . 53 ) .
five studies [ 21,24,25,27,29 ] and 3 studies [ 24,25,27 ] assessed the relationship between cyclin b expression and disease - free survival ( dfs ) in univariate and multivariate analysis , respectively .
both combined hrs suggest that high level of cyclin b expression is an indicator of poor dfs ( univariate analysis : hr = 1.86 , 95 % ci = 1.50 - 2.32 , p < . 001 , multivariate analysis : hr = 1.75 , 95 % ci = 1.22 - 2.52 , p = . 003 ) .
no significant heterogeneity between studies was detected ( univariate analysis : i2 = 35.4 % , p = . 185 , multivariate analysis : i2 = 0 % , p = . 829 ) .
as to the association between cyclin b expression and disease - specific survival ( dss ) , while no statistical significance was detected in pooled hr of 2 studies [ 22,29 ] in univariate analysis ( hr = 3.06 , 95 % ci = 0.80 - 11.73 , p = . 102 ) with heterogeneity ( i2 = 68.3 % , p = . 097 ) , the result in multivariate analysis suggested that high cyclin b expression was associated with poor dss in breast cancer patients ( hr = 5.42 , 95 % ci = 2.15 - 13.66 , p < . 001 ) , without heterogeneity ( i2 = 0 % , p = . 744 ) .
subgroup analysis was done to differentiate the effects between total cyclin b and its subtype when number of studies is at least 3 .
to test the robustness of association between cyclin b expression and survival outcome ( os and dfs ) , potential publication bias and sensitivity were assessed using begg funnel plot and sensitivity analysis .
as shown in fig. 3 , begg test ( puni - os = . 308 , puni - dfs = 1.000 , and pmulti - dfs = 1.000 ) demonstrated no obvious publication bias in this meta - analysis of prognosis .
sensitivity analysis indicated that no significant variation was detected in combined hr by excluding any of the study , confirming the stability of final results ( fig. 4 ) .

3.4 association between cyclin b expression and clinicopathologic parameters four studies [ 22,23,26,30 ] assessed the association between cyclin b expression and clinicopathological parameters including age , tumor size , tumor stage , tumor grade and lymphatic invasion , er , pr , or her - 2 status ( table 3 ) .
pooled data suggested a significant relationship between cyclin b expression and lymphatic invasion ( or = 2.58 , 95 % ci = 1.03 - 6.46 ) ( see fig. 1 , supplemental content ) .
however , no significant associations were found between cyclin b expression and age , tumor size , tumor stage , tumor grade , er , pr , or her - 2 status ( see figs. 2 - 8 , supplemental content ) .
table 3 meta - analysis estimating the relevance of cyclin b with clinicopathological characteristics .
4 discussion the cyclin b / cdk1 complex governs the g2 - m phase transition and is essential for the initiation of mitosis. [ 10 ] a negligent g2 / m checkpoint will cause genomic instability and induce cancer genesis .
so , aberrant cyclin b expression causes uncontrolled cell growth and promotes malignant transformation. [ 21,31 ] the overexpression of cyclin b has been shown to be an important factor affecting survival in several malignant diseases , including breast cancer ,[ 26 ] esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ,[ 32 ] nonsmall cell carcinoma ,[ 33 ] and hepatocellular carcinoma. [ 34 ] several studies with controversial results have been done to study the relationship between cyclin b and survival .
this meta - analysis has drawn a preciser conclusion about this topic .
to our knowledge , this is the first meta - analysis about the relationship between cyclin b and dss , os , dfs , and clincopathological parameters in breast cancer .
in this meta - analysis , we included 10 eligible articles about patients with breast cancer to draw a conclusion that overexpression of cyclin b is significantly associated with poor dss and dfs in breast cancer patients , indicating that cyclin b may be a promising molecular marker in this disease .
two studies [ 22,29 ] were included when analyzing prognostic influence of cyclin b on dss of breast cancer .
in univariate analysis , the prognostic value of cyclin b was not confirmed by combining data .
low heterogeneity was found between the 2 studies .
due to the number of the studies , the source of heterogeneity was not able to evaluate and more studies are needed to study the relationship between univariate dss and cyclin b. only 1 study [ 27 ] reported the hr ( 1.83,95 % ci = 0.99 - 3.40 , p = . 05 ) in multivariate analysis of os , and more studies are required to assess the prognostic role of cyclin b in os in multivariate analysis .
we further demonstrated that cyclin b is correlated with the presence of lymph node metastasis , indicating that patients with overexpression of cyclin b are prone to have lymphatic invasion .
some studies [ 21,27,28 ] investigated the relationship between cyclin b and clincopathological coefficient using the correlation parameters which prevented us from pooling these data to combine .
in addition , the multivariable analyses of different studies did not control for the same covariates , which is a source of heterogeneity and more studies are needed to clarify this .
cyclin b1 and cyclin b2 , which share the same binding motif , contain a 100 - amino - acid region of sequence similarity to the consensus " cyclin box " and both bind to cdk1 to form the cyclin b / cdk1 complex , which phosphorylates a critical set of proteins to set into motion the events that define mitosis when activated. [ 35 ] on account of the similar function of cyclin b1 and b2 in regulating cell cycle , 3 studies [ 24,28,29 ] detected total cyclin b expression including both b1 and b2 while other studies detected either 1 of the 2 cyclins .
subgroup analysis showed both total cyclin b and cyclin b1 play an important role in predicting poor prognosis in os with univariate analysis and in dfs with multivariate analysis .
nuclear translocation of cyclin b plays an essential role in promoting mitosis. [ 36 ] cyclin b / cdc2 is cytoplasmic during interphase and is transported into the nucleus at the beginning of mitosis. [ 37,38 ] suzuki et al [ 21 ] concluded that only nuclear cyclin b acts as prognostic factor in breast cancer .
winters et al [ 15 ] found that both nuclear and cytoplasmic cyclin b were significant predictors of poor prognosis in breast cancer .
in this meta - analysis , we included studies without differentiating between nuclear and cytoplasmic expression .
inadequate data extracted from these studies make it unable to combine data both in cytoplasm and nuclear .
more studies are needed to investigate the effect of cyclin b location on the prognosis of breast cancer patients .
in conclusion , this meta - analysis draws a preciser conclusion that there are significant associations between cyclin b overexpression and poor survival in patients with breast cancer , indicating that cyclin b may be a potential biomarker in breast cancer .
to strengthen our findings , well - designed prospective studies with lager number of cases should help to explore the relationship between cyclin b overexpression and survival of breast cancer .

caring for children with diabetes is challenging for many reasons , some of them are social , emotional , and financial problem .
aims to report our experiences in managing type 1 diabetes mellitus ( dm ) patients in our hospital , the referral hospital in our province , from 2009 till june 2012 .
methods we reviewed all the patients with diagnosis type 1 dm. the following information was collected : patient 's condition at first diagnosis , sex , body mass index ( bmi ) , age at diagnosis , blood glucose , c - peptide , and hba1c level , parents earning , presenting clinical features , family history , health funding , insulin therapy , and problems in managing the patients .
results we have 21 patients from 2009 until june 2012 , 4 were male .
the age at diagnosis was between 4 until 14 years old .
nutritional status were moderate until severe malnutrition .
about 62 % of patients had history of diabetic ketoacidosis .
most of them came from low social economic background , for some patients , the parents earning were less than 1 million rupiahs (< usd 100 ) .
only 5 patients had health insurance which covered insulin , and others must buy insulin by themselves .
this was a big problem for us since 4 patients stopped insulin therapy , using herbal treatments instead and were readmitted with diabetic ketoacidosis .
mean of hba1c level was 14 % , c - peptide was 0.3 ng / ml. four patients died with severe dka , and 1 died with severe hypoglycemia .
conclusion most of our patients were diagnosed late .
social , environment , and financial problems were the main issue in managing these patients .
we need government and people to work together to solve these problems and guarantee the quality of life of diabetic patients .

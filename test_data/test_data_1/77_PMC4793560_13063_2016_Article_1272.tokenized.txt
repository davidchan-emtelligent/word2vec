background to provide evidence that the chinese herbal medicine ( chm ) psori - cm01 combined with western medicine reduces the relapse rate of psoriasis vulgaris ( pv ) , we plan to conduct a large - scale randomized control trial ( rct ) .
in order to improve and perfect the rct , this pilot study was designed to determine the feasibility and the potential of a modified protocol for the full - scale rct .
methods eligible patients with psoriasis vulgaris ( pv ) were enrolled into a randomized comparison in which all subjects received topical sequential therapy and psori - cm01 or placebo for 12 weeks .
the primary outcome measure was the relapse rate .
treatment response was computed from psoriasis area and severity index ( pasi ) , body surface area ( bsa ) , and dermatology life quality index ( dlqi ) .
the secondary outcome measures included time to relapse , time to onset , rebound rate , pasi score , pruritus scores on the visual analog scale ( vas ) , bsa , dlqi and sf - 36 ( short form health survey ) , and incidence of serious adverse events ( saes ) .
results six of 7 ( 86 %) subjects reached the pasi - 50 in the chm group compared with nine of 10 ( 90 %) in the placebo group during the treatment period .
among the subjects who reached pasi - 50 , one out of six subjects ( 17 %) relapsed in the chm group during the treatment period compared with six out of nine patients in the placebo group ( 67 %) .
no subjects met the rebound criteria .
changes to baseline in the pasi scores were not significantly different between the two groups ( t = 1.764 , p = 0.098 ) .
conclusion oral psori - cm01 combined with topical sequential treatment showed a smaller recurrence rate ( p = 0.118 ) than placebo combined with the same topical therapy for moderate - to - severe pv in this pilot study .

keywords psoriasis vulgaris pilot randomized controlled trial psori - cm01 chinese herbal medicine topical sequential treatment issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2016 background psoriasis is a chronic skin disease characterized by disfiguring scaling and erythematous plaques that may be painful or often severely pruritic and may cause many quality of life ( qol ) issues [ 1 ] .
psoriasis vulgaris ( pv ) is the most common form and is categorized as " mild , moderate - to - severe " according to the rules of ten [ 2 ] .
a quarter of those affected have moderate - to - severe disease for which treatment options include topical treatment , systemic treatment , or phototherapy .
currently , no curative treatment is available .
due to its chronic nature , frequent relapses , and high impact on qol , patients often require long - term treatment .
however , most of the therapies are associated with side effects and not appropriate for long - term use .
therefore , the goal of treating psoriasis is to maintain the success of the treatment as far as possible with fewer side effects .
chinese herbal medicine ( chm ) has a history of successful use in treating pv in china .
meta - analyses of clinical trials suggest clinical benefit for at least some chm treatments [ 3 - 5 ] .
evidence showed that a combination of chm and western medicine relieved symptoms and reduced pasi scores with fewer side effects and toxicity [ 6 , 7 ] .
however , no evidence of chm for reducing the relapse of pv is available .
psori - cm01 , a chinese herbal formula , has been used for more than 20 years in guangdong provincial hospital of chinese medicine ( gphcm ) in china to reduce the recurrence rate of pv. we determined the feasibility of conducting a multicenter , randomized controlled trial ( rct ) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of psori - cm01 combined with topical therapy compared with placebo for pv , focusing on the relapse rate and reduction of pasi .
to this end , we conducted a feasibility pilot study , which was registered on 21 august 2012 ( chictr - trc - 12002447 ) , comparing psori - cm01 plus calcipotriol betamethasone ointment therapy with placebo plus the topical therapy .
the results of the chm group showed 50 % improvement in pasi earlier than the placebo group , with a longer maintenance efficacy .
however , the study had limitations associated with the interventions and study period .
the trial did not register good compliance from 6 weeks to the end mainly due to the rebound effect after 4 weeks of the calcipotriol betamethasone ointment therapy .
one patient was reported to manifest pustular psoriasis after 4 weeks of calcipotriol betamethasone topical treatment as an adverse drug reaction .
therefore , topical sequential treatment was needed to reduce the hazards associated with the rebound and adverse effect of topical corticosteroids .
topical sequential therapy with a combination of calcipotriol and calcipotriol betamethasone was significantly superior to the use of each therapy alone from a pharmacoeconomic standpoint according to the guidelines for the treatment of pv [ 8 ] .
to minimize the adverse effects and maximize compliance , we modified the protocol by adding 8 weeks of maintenance therapy with calcipotriol after 4 weeks of calcipotriol betamethasone ointment , based on guidelines and evidences for moderate to severe psoriasis with bsa less than 30 % [ 8 , 9 ] .
we designed a run - in period before enrollment and used urea ointment and cetirizine hydrochloride as rescue medicine when skin itchiness affected the patients' qol during the whole study .
the modified protocol was registered in april 2013 ( chictr - trc - 13003233 ) and published in july 2014 [ 10 ] .
the objective of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility of the modified protocol and assess the potential for a full rct .
the primary outcome measure was the incidence of relapse during the study .
methods design and eligibility this pilot study was designed as a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of oral psori - cm01 plus topical sequential treatment compared with placebo plus topical sequential treatment for moderate - to - severe pv. a randomized number was generated by computer with a randomized block method in which the block size was four , in a ratio of 1:1 , created by sas 9.2 software ( sas institute inc. , cary , usa ) and performed by the key unit of methodology in clinical research ( kumcr ) of gphcm .
the result of the randomized allocation was concealed in an opaque envelope and was also performed by the kumcr of gphcm .
the participants , paramedics , investigators , outcome assessors , statistician and other staff who help dispense medications were all blinded to the allocation .
the study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee of gphcm ( ethics statement no : b2012 - 53 - 03 , approved on 16 august 2013 ) , and all patients provided written informed consent prior to initiation of study .
setting prior to randomization , all patients had a run - in period of 2 weeks before receiving treatment .
before the run - in period , all patients agreed to cease topical corticosteroid therapy , vitamin d analogs , keratolytics , and coal tar or chm for 2 weeks , and phototherapy and systemic therapies for 4 weeks to meet the criterion .
only urea cream was permitted during the run - in period .
after this period , subjects were screened again according to inclusion and exclusion criteria .
eligible subjects were assigned according to their sequential numbers , which corresponded to a random number and then were randomized to one of the two groups ( see fig. 1 for the consort flowchart ). fig. 1 consort diagram of the pilot study .
chm , chinese herbal medicine ; pasi , psoriasis area severity index ; bsa , body surface area patients patients were recruited by dermatologist or investigators mostly from dermatology outpatients in the gphcm or through local newspapers or posters .
a few patients spontaneously contacted the trial center .
participants were diagnosed with pv by dermatologists .
the inclusion criteria were as follows : 1 ) moderate to severe psoriasis ( pasi > 10 or bsa > 10 % , pasi < 30 and bsa < 30 %) ; 2 ) written / signed informed consent ; 3 ) age : 18 to 65 years .
the exclusion criteria were as follows : 1 ) guttate psoriasis , inverse psoriasis , or psoriasis exclusively associated with the face ; 2 ) current ( or within 1 year ) pregnancy or lactation ; 3 ) current clinically important anxiety or depression with the self - rating anxiety scale ( sas ) > 50 or the self - rating depression scale ( sds ) > 53 , or with other psychiatric disorders ; 4 ) history of uncontrolled cardiovascular , respiratory , digestive , urinary , or hematologic disease ; 5 ) history of known cancer , infection , electrolyte imbalance , acid - base disturbance , and calcium metabolic disorder ; 6 ) abnormal serum calcium level ( ca2 + > 2.9 mmol / l or < 2 mmol / l ) ; 7 ) allergy to any medicine or ingredients used in this study ; 8 ) current registration in other clinical trials or participation within a month ; 9 ) topical treatments ( that is , corticosteroids or retinoic acid ) within 2 weeks ; 10 ) systemic therapy or phototherapy ( ultraviolet radiation b , uvb ) and psoralen combined with ultraviolet a ( puva ) within 4 weeks or biological therapy within 12 weeks ; 11 ) acute progression of psoriasis , and erythroderma tendency ; or 12 ) systemic treatment prescribed by doctors .
intervention the topical sequential treatment in the study was calcipotriol betamethasone ointment ( daivobetr ointment , containing calcipotriene 50 mug / g and betamethasone 0.5 mg / g as dipropionate ; leo laboratories ltd , dublin , ireland ) once daily for 4 weeks , followed by calcipotriol ointment ( dovonexr cream ; leo laboratories ltd , dublin , ireland ) once daily for 8 weeks .
patients were randomized ( 1:1 ) to receive either a psori - cm01 decoction or placebo orally .
the psori - cm01 decoction , composed of radix paeoniae rubra , rhizoma curcumae , sarcandra , radix glycytthizae , fructus mume , radix arnebiae , and rhizoma smilacis glabrae , was decocted and packaged into vacuum packs by the pharmaceutical department of chinese herbal medicine of gphcm ( 100 ml / pack ) .
the matching placebo , the main ingredients , of which were maltodextrin , lactose , and natural edible pigment , was similar to the psori - cm01 decoction in appearance , weight , and taste , and was also manufactured by the pharmaceutical department of chinese herbal medicine of gphcm .
the quality control of the decoction had been accredited by the guangdong provincial laboratory using liquid chromatography coupled with an ltq orbitrap mass spectrometer [ 11 ] .
patients were administered the psori - cm01 decoction or placebo single pack twice a day after meals .
the treatment duration was 12 weeks .
urea ointment was used as the basic concomitant treatment in the run - in period , according to doctors' choice .
in case of a serious itch , cetirizine hydrochloride ( 10 mg / day ) was the rescue drug , based on doctors' advice .
the study flowchart is illustrated in fig. 1. outcome measures the primary outcome measure in this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of psori - cm01 and topical sequential treatment to reduce the relapse rate of patients during the treatment period .
relapse was defined as the loss of 50 % of pasi improvement from baseline in patients who achieved treatment success ( at least 50 % improvement in pasi score from baseline ) [ 12 , 13 ] .
relapse was determined by evaluating the proportion of subjects who lost pasi - 50 response attained during the treatment period .
secondary outcome measures in the study were as follows : ( i ) the relapse time interval , ( ii ) time to onset , ( iii ) rebound rate , ( iv ) improvement in pasi , ( v ) pruritus scores on the visual analog scale ( vas ) , ( vi ) improvement in bsa for pv , ( vii ) improvement in dlqi and sf - 36 ( the mos item short form health survey ) , and ( viii ) incidence of serious adverse events ( saes ) .
the pasi and bsa were assessed by investigators every week during the first 4 weeks and every 2 weeks during the rest of the treatment period .
meanwhile , patients were required to report vas scores and the emergence of altered condition at any time during study period .
dlqi and sf - 36 were calculated every 4 weeks .
other outcome measures were calculated during patient visits .
laboratory tests including complete blood count , urinalysis , hepatic and renal functions , and electrocardiogram were monitored and recorded at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment .
statistical analysis data were processed with pasw statistics 18.0 ( ibm spss inc , armonk , new york , usa ) .
descriptive analysis was used to characterize patients' clinical demographics .
the primary outcome was compared 12 weeks after treatment between both groups using the chi - square test ( or fisher 's exact test ) .
secondary outcomes were compared between both groups by the end of treatment using t - tests , the mann - whitney test , and fisher 's exact test .
two - tailed p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant .
the last observation carried forward was used to evaluate data with an intention - to - treat analysis .
data were presented as mean and standard deviation .
since it was a pilot study instead of a hypothesis test , it is inappropriate to make any inferences or state findings of efficacy [ 14 ] .
the aim of this pilot trial was to test the practicality of the trial design , and data were only analyzed to alert the investigators to issues for testing in the planned larger - scale trial .
sample size for the large - scale study , we calculated sample size based on white 's study [ 9 ] in the protocol [ 10 ] .
sample size calculations are not a prerequisite for pilot studies [ 15 ] .
following recommendations for pilot trials , 18 patients were recruited at baseline to test the practicality of the trial design .
results patients in this pilot study , 77 patients were recruited for 2 months , and 18 ( 8 in chm group vs 10 in placebo group ) of them were enrolled from the outpatient department at gphcm .
however , one of the randomized patients in the chm group did not receive the allocated intervention and had no data from baseline ; therefore 17 patients were analyzed. of these , 15 ( 88 %) completed the study at week 12 .
two patients who discontinued did not show satisfactory efficacy .
the majority of subjects were male ( 89 %) , with a mean age of 43 years ( minimum to maximum : 24 to 62 years ) .
a summary of baseline demographic information is provided in table 1 .
the mean pasi score was 13.19 in the chm group compared with 11.67 in the placebo group at baseline .
the groups were similar in size , sex , age , and mean pasi at baseline ( table 1 ) .

during the treatment period , six of the seven ( 86 %) subjects in the chm group reached pasi - 50 and one of them ( 17 %) relapsed during the treatment period after attaining pasi - 50 , whereas five maintained pasi - 50 at the end of 12 weeks .
however , nine of 10 ( 90 %) subjects in the placebo group reached pasi - 50 , and six of them relapsed ( 67 %) , whereas three attained treatment success ( maintaining pasi - 50 ) .
relapse was 17 % in the chm group versus 67 % in the placebo group , with no statistically significant difference in the incidence of relapse between the two groups ( odds ratio : 0.10 ; 95 % ci : 0.008 , 1.288 ; p = 0.119 ) ( table 2 ) .

in this pilot study , the mean relapse time interval in the chm group was 6.00 weeks ( only one patient relapsed ) compared with 4.42 , 2.44 ( mean , sd ) weeks in the placebo group ( see table 3 ) .

the mean onset time of this pilot study was 3.33 , 2.25 weeks ( minimum to maximum : 1 to 7 weeks ) in the chm group versus 1.78 , 1.09 weeks ( minimum to maximum : 1 to 4 weeks ) in the placebo group ( table 3 ) .
rebound rate , that is , the proportion of patients with pasi scores rebounding , was defined only for patients who achieved pasi - 50 and occurred when the improvement in the pasi score increased up to 25 % from the baseline pasi score .
no patients reached rebound in the study , and therefore , the rebound rate was 0 % in both groups ( see table 2 ) .
group comparisons of outcomes above were not analyzed due to an insufficient number of participants in this trial .
the changes of pasi , vas , bsa , and dlqi scores in the chm group after treatments seemed much more than the placebo group from week 4 to week 12 ( fig. 2 ) .
at the end of 4 weeks , the pasi , bsa , vas , and dlqi curves of both groups showed similar tendency to decline. from 6 to 12 week , pasi , and vas scores were lower in the chm group than in the placebo group ( fig. 2 ) .
it was interesting that the psori - cm01 decoction not only improved lesions , but also improved health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) in psoriasis patients , as demonstrated by improvements of the dlqi scores ( see fig. 2 ) and sf - 36 ( see fig. 3 ). fig. 2 psoriasis areas severity index ( pasi ) score , body surface area for psoriasis ( bsa ) score , visual analog score ( vas ) , and dermatology life quality index ( dlqi ) score in the chinese herbal medicine ( chm ) and placebo groups .

no significant differences were observed between the groups in any subscale scores .
a comparison of changes of subscale scores after treatment between two groups : p < 0.05 indicated significant difference between groups .
the statistical results of the subscale scores are as follows : pf ( z = - 1.742 , p = 0.081 ) , pr ( z = - 0.875 , p = 0.391 ) , bp ( z = - 1.913 , p = 0.056 ) , gh ( t = 0.171 , p = 0.868 ) , vt ( z = - 0.298 , p = 0.766 ) , sf ( z = - 1.086 , p = 0.278 ) , er ( z = 0.00 , p = 1.00 ) , mh ( z = - 0.451 , p = 0.652 ) improvements of the dlqi score in the study were 3.43 , 7.76 in the chm group compared with 0.70 , 6.00 in the placebo group ( t = 0.845 , p = 0.411 ) ( fig. 2 ) .
the following eight subscales were assessed with 36 items of the sf - 36 : pf , physical function ( limitations in physical activities because of health problems ) ; pr , physical role ( limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems ) ; bp , bodily pain ; gh , general health perceptions ; vt , vitality ( energy and fatigue ) ; sf , social function ( limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems ) ; er , emotional role ( limitations in usual role activities because of emotional health problems ) ; and mh , mental health .
the chm group tended to have a higher mean of altered scores in the subscales , which suggested the qol improved more than in the placebo group except for mh ( mental health ) ( see fig. 3 ) .
as indicated in the tables , differences in the pasi , bsa , vas , and dlqi scores were not significant between the chm group and the placebo group after treatment .
safety no serious adverse events ( saes ) or abnormal laboratory test results were observed during the entire study period .
four patients ( 57 % , 4 / 7 ) exhibited adverse events in the chm group , and three ( 30 % , 3 / 10 ) in the placebo group , which was not significantly different between the two groups .
three patients reported lower limb erythema and burning heat sensation , and one also experienced edema while using the calcipotriol ointment .
one of them was in the chm group , whereas two were in the placebo group .
the remaining side effects such as contact dermatitis , hypertension , dizziness , and common cold were limited to a single case in both groups .
discussion this pilot trial was successful in patient recruitment , randomization , and retention and assessment .
the trial design was feasible and acceptable to both patients and investigators .
seventy - seven patients were recruited from the outpatient department within 3 months. of the 25 screened participants , 18 were enrolled .
one of the 18 randomized patients did not receive the allocated intervention .
therefore , only 17 patients were included the study .
two participants ( 11 %) withdrew from the trial .
treatment adherence was better than that in the first pilot study ( registered on 21 august 2012 ( chictr - trc - 12002447 ) , possibly because this pilot study was modified by adding a run - in period and sequential topical therapy .
fifteen patients who completed the trial returned with good therapeutic adherence .
all of the outcome measures were assessed at every time point .
as far as we know , the pilot study is the first to explore psori - cm01 , a chinese herbal formula , combined with topical sequential treatment to reduce the recurrence rate of pv. psoriasis is often characterized by acute episodes and remission phases , requiring chronic therapy .
the results from our study suggested that the addition of psori - cm01 to topical sequential treatment was an effective treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis .
it reduced the rate of relapse .
maintaining the treatment success and reducing the relapse are the main goals of disease management .
the results of this pilot study showed that psori - cm01 was a useful addition to conventional therapy .
the addition of psori - cm01 to topical sequential treatment not only improved lesion conditions but also helped qol .
outcome measures such as pasi , bsa , and vas scores showed a declining pattern in both groups after treatment .
the pasi and vas scores in the chm group seemed to improve more than in the placebo group , which demonstrated long - term treatment success .
the psori - cm01 decoction relieved itch in rat models [ 16 ] .
data also suggested that the chm group had lower mean vas scores than the placebo group at week 12 .
outcome measures such as dlqi and sf - 36 also suggested that psori - cm01 helped to improve the qol more than placebo and maintained treatment success similar to pasi scores .
the mean improvements in the dlqi scores and sf - 36 were greater in the chm group than in the placebo group .
therefore , the addition of psori - cm01 reduced relapse , probably by clearing lesions , relieving the itch , and improving the qol .
chm has been used for a long time in china to control psoriasis clinically .
however , the limitation of its broader use might be related to its slower action .
topical ointment cleared lesions rapidly but without lasting effects .
therefore , a combination of chm and topical sequential therapy to treat psoriasis is a new option to clear lesions faster and maintain success longer than individual topical therapies [ 17 ] .
a systematic review previously evaluated the effects of oral chinese herbal medicine combined with pharmacotherapy for pv compared with pharmacotherapy [ 4 ] .
the results showed the benefit of the combination .
the most frequently used herbs were rehmannia glutinosa root ( sheng di ) , angelica sinensis root ( dang gui ) , smilax glabra root ( tu fu ling ) , paeonia veitchii root ( chi shao ) , salvia miltiorrhiza root ( dan shen ) , and lithospermum erythrorhizon root ( zi cao ) .
most of them were compositions of the prescription in psori - cm01 formula .
the psori - cm01 decoction reportedly inhibited mitosis of mouse vaginal epithelium significantly and promoted the formation of granular layers in mouse tail - scale epidermis compared with a saline group .
it inhibited hacat cell growth after treatment for 24 h. the mechanism of psori - cm01 in treating psoriasis may be related to the promotion of granular cell growth and inhibition of epidermal cell proliferation [ 18 ] .
a metabolomics approach to explore the in vivo mechanism of psori - cm01 used fasting urine samples from patients with consecutive intake mono - therapy after 0 , 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks and was analyzed by orthogonal projection on latent structures discriminant analysis ( opls - da ) .
treatment with the psori - cm01 decoction for 12 weeks decreased the pasi scores .
the positive effect of optimized yinxieling ( psori - cm01 ) may be explained in terms of altered metabolism after intervention .
research revealed increased 12a - hydroxy - 3 - oxocholadienic acid levels significantly after treatment [ 19 ] .
our study had a number of limitations .
for the primary and secondary outcomes , we had a relatively small sample size that limited our ability to show statistical significance .
seasons have an important effect on the severity of psoriasis .
most psoriatic patients experienced remission in hot summer and aggravation in cold winter .
patients even recover to normal spontaneously in warm climate .
this pilot study was carried out when the cold winter turned into hot summer .
therefore , the results might show a sequence bias .
two patients lost to follow - up because of unsatisfied efficacy were randomized to the chm and placebo groups equally .
our intention - to - treat analysis with a last observation carried forward approach , may be associated with a withdrawal bias and bias associated with missed clinical data .
outcome measures such as the pasi and bsa scores were assessed by two investigators .
before commencing the study , the two investigators were trained in the evaluation of pasi together to develop similar levels of expertise in assessing the severity of erythema , desquamation , infiltration , and area of involvement .
the same patient was assessed by the same investigators during the whole study .
however , differences between the two investigators persisted due to the disadvantage of pasi scores , which were occasionally subjective .
therefore , in a full rct , we should streamline the pasi training of the investigators responsible for outcome assessment , for consistency and quality of the primary outcome measure derived from pasi .
in this paper , we describe a pilot randomized controlled trial of oral chinese medicine ( psori - cm01 ) combined with topical sequential treatment for moderate - to - severe pv. the trial is outlined according to the consort 2010 checklist [ 20 ] , and more details are shown in additional file 1 .
the results show that it is feasible to develop the pilot trial into a full rct .
in this pilot study , the relapse rate of the placebo group was 67 % , different from the study by white et al .
[ 9 ] , which showed a relapse rate of 37.3 % with the same topical sequential therapy for 12 weeks .
for the full rct protocol [ 10 ] , we have calculated the sample size based on the white et al. study .
supposing the relapse rate of psori - cm01 combined with topical sequential therapy for pv in the 12th week was 20 % , the topical sequential therapy alone resulted in 37 % .
we use the primary outcome measure to calculate sample size in the protocol by supposing that the addition of psori - cm01 reduced the relapse rate by 17 % more than the placebo .
the pilot study showed that the relapse rate of the chm group was 17 % , close to our hypothesis .
the relapse rate decreased to 50 % in the chm group compared with that in the placebo group , which exceeded our hypothesis and suggested that the sample size in the protocol was adequate .
results from our placebo - controlled exploratory study added to the limited data on the combination of therapy with chm and topical therapy in psoriasis patients , indicating that the addition of the psori - cm01 reduced the relapse rate compared with topical sequential therapy alone .
psori - cm01 was safe and effective .
further study involving a larger patient population is warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining psori - cm01 and topical sequential therapy in patients with moderate - to - severe psoriasis , especially to confirm the decreased recurrence rate .
conclusion the recurrence of pv is a therapeutic challenge for clinicians .
our research showed that psori - cm01 , a chinese herbal formula , combined with topical sequential therapy ( calcipotriol betamethasone ointment daily for 4 weeks , followed by calcipotriol ointment daily for 8 weeks ) resulted in a smaller recurrence rate than placebo combined with the same topical therapy .
our result indicates that the addition of psori - cm01 reduced the recurrence rate in moderate - to - severe psoriasis .
additional studies are needed using large sample sizes in a multicenter randomized control trial .

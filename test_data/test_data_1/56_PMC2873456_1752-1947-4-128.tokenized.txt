introduction we report for the first time a unique case of vacterl ( vertebral anomalies , anal atresia or imperforate anus , cardiac anomalies , tracheoesophageal fistula , renal and limb defect ) spectrum associated with portal hypertension .
the occurrence of both vacterl spectrum and extrahepatic portal hypertension in a patient has not been reported in the literature .
we examined whether or not there was any association between extrahepatic portal hypertension and vacterl spectrum .
case presentation a two - and - half - year - old caucasian girl with vacterl spectrum presented with hematemesis and abdominal distension .
she had caput medusae , ascites , splenomegaly , gastric and esophageal varices .
her liver function tests were within normal limits .
magnetic resonance imaging of the liver with contrast showed a thready portal vein with collateral vessels involving both right and left portal veins without intrahepatic duct dilation .
conclusion a thready portal vein , with features of extrahepatic portal hypertension , is a rare non - vacterl - type defect in patients with vacterl spectrum .
understandably , clinicians should give low priority to looking for portal hypertension in vacterl spectrum patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding .
however before routinely looking for a thready portal vein and / or extrahepatic portal hypertension in asymptomatic vacterl spectrum patients , we need further evidence to support this rare association .
introduction the clinical manifestation of vacterl association includes vertebral anomalies , anal atresia , congenital heart disease , tracheoesophageal fistula , renal dysplasia and limb abnormalities [ 1 ] .
portal hypertension results from the elevation of portal venous pressure .
the late consequences of portal hypertension may be esophageal varices , gastric varices , splenomegaly , ascites , and caput medusae [ 2 ] .
the association of vacterl spectrum and portal hypertension in a child has not been reported so far .
we report a case of vacterl association with portal hypertension and discuss the possibility of a common etiology .
case presentation a two - and - half - year - old caucasian girl presented with hematemesis .
a systemic inquiry revealed no other symptoms .
she was noted to be very small , with growth below the 3rd centile .
she was pale , very alert , active and playful .
her abdominal examination revealed prominent superficial veins with splenomegaly measuring 6 cm from the costal margin .
the rest of her systemic examination was normal .
her stool was positive for occult blood ; however her complete blood count , coagulation profile , extended clotting study , and thrombophilia screen were all within normal limits .
she had had a meckel 's abdominal scan which came back normal .
her liver function which was repeatedly checked remained within normal limits .
our patient was born by emergency lower segment cesarean section ( emlscs ) due to fetal distress at 33 weeks' gestation .
her parents were non - consanguineous caucasians .
at birth her mother was 34 years of age , a non - smoker and a non - alcoholic ; and she was on prophylthyouracil for a hyperactive thyroid .
antenatal history revealed that her pregnancy had been complicated by pregnancy - induced hypertension .
fetal growth had been monitored regularly for suspected growth restriction .
ultrasound scan had confirmed the restricted growth and a doppler ultrasound scan had been abnormal with absent end diastolic flow .
there had been no oligo - or polyhydramnios .
antenatal torch ( toxoplasma , rubella , cytomegalovirus , herpes simplex ) , hiv , treponemma and hepatitis screening were all normal .
our patient was born in a good condition with apgars of 9 at one minute and 10 at five minutes .
her weight was 1250 g at birth , which was below the 3rd centile for her age and sex .
she was noted to have an imperforate anus , with a rectovaginal fistula .
she had heart murmur , and a subsequent echocardiography confirmed perimembranous ventricular septal defect ( vsd ) and persistent foramen ovale .
an x - ray of her spine confirmed the hemivertebrae on her sacrococcygeal spine .
she had had surgical correction of her imperforate anus and rectovaginal fistula within the first few days of life .
she had spent four weeks in the neonatal unit before being discharged home .
she was doing well at home until she presented to us at two and half years of age with effortless vomiting of blood .
her growth trajectory had always remained below the 3rd centile .
she had had different tests following her admission with hematemesis .
an ultrasound of her abdomen confirmed splenomegaly , and a doppler sonography showed a thready portal vein with correct directional low velocity flow towards the liver .
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of her liver , using a gadolinium contrast agent , confirmed splenomegaly with gastric , retroperitoneal and splenic varices .
the portal vein was thready ( figures 1 and 2 ) with collateral vessels involving both left and right portal veins .
there was no evidence of intrahepatic duct dilation in the gadolinium - enhanced mri scan of the liver .
figure 1 coronal section of the gadolinium - enhanced mri scan of the liver and portal system .
the image shows a thready portal vein ( arrow ) with collateral vessels involving both left and right portal veins .
figure 2 thready portal vein with prominent collaterals seen in the coronal section of the gadolinium - enhanced mri scan .
discussion our patient had an imperforate anus with a rectovaginal fistula , perimemebranous vsd , persistent foramen ovale and vertebral anomalies ; features associated with a vacterl spectrum .
she also had splenomegaly , gastric , retroperitoneal and splenic varices , along with dilated superficial abdominal veins which were the late seqelae of portal hypertension .
mri of the liver with contrast showed a thready portal vein with collateral vessels involving both right and left portal veins without intrahepatic duct dilation .
non - vacterl - type defects like single umbilical artery , genital defects and respiratory tract anomalies have been frequently described in patients with vacterl association [ 3 ] .
de jong em et al. stated that 70 % of cases with vacterl spectrum had additional non - vacterl - type defects , with high occurrences of single umbilical artery ( 20 %) , genital defects ( 23.3 %) and respiratory tract anomalies ( 13.3 %) .
extrahepatic portal hypertension in children with normal liver function is not especially uncommon .
the most common cause is portal vein thrombosis ( pvt ) .
portal hypertension in our patient was noticed at two and half years of age when she presented to us with hematemesis .
she was investigated for a possible etiology .
her thrombophilia screen and liver function tests were normal .
her imaging of the liver and portal system showed a thready portal vein with collaterals arising from the right and left portal veins .
ando et al. studied portal venous anatomy in 10 patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction without hepatic disturbances ranging in age from one to seven years ( mean age , 4.2 years ) using ultrasonography , portal venography , computed tomography cholangiography and mri [ 4 ] .
the extrahepatic portal vein was not obliterated , but it crossed over the common bile duct from the left to the right side at the cranial level of the pancreas and ran in a cranial direction along the right side of the common bile duct or coiled itself around the bile duct .
thus , the extrahepatic portal vein formed a tortuous eta - shape .
the portal vein was not obstructed in patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction but formed a characteristic eta - shape by coiling itself around the common bile duct , suggesting that extrahepatic portal vein obstruction has an embryological cause .
we postulate that the thready portal vein seen in our patient could be another structural defect which had led to portal hypertension .
no definite gene has been identified to explain the vacterl association and the etiology is not yet confirmed [ 5 ] .
however during early embryonic development , disruption occurs , leading to different malformations of the heart , skeleton , muscle and blood vessels of the vacterl spectrum .
the disruption occurs in the differentiation of the mesoderm leading to the different malformations of the vacterl spectrum .
it will be very difficult to derive any conclusion from a single case however it is worth looking at the possibility of future studies of vacterl spectrum patients .
conclusion our case is the first of case of its type with vacterl spectrum and extrahepatic portal hypertension .
a thready portal vein , with features of extrahepatic portal hypertension , may be one of the non - vacterl - type defects in patients with vacterl association .
but before actively looking for a thready portal vein and or extrahepatic portal hypertension in vacterl spectrum patients , we need more evidence to support this hypothesis .

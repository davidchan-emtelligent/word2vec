to examine the change in stress between before and after the tohoku - oki mw9.0 earthquake , we performed stress measurements after the earthquake in the kamaishi mine in iwate prefecture in northern japan , located near the northern termination of the mainshock rupture , following previous measurements before the earthquake in the same mine .
the results showed that the magnitudes of the three - dimensional principal stresses and the vertical stress drastically increased after the mainshock and , at 1 year after the earthquake , were more than double those before the earthquake .
the principal stress magnitudes then decreased with time and returned to almost pre - earthquake levels at about 3 years after the earthquake .
these changes can be interpreted in terms of coseismic rupture of the mainshock and the occurrence of aftershocks in the sanriku - oki low - seismicity region ( slsr ) , where the kamaishi mine is located .
the drastic increase in stress suggests that the slsr may act as a barrier to further rupture propagation .
issue - copyright - statement ( c ) the author ( s ) 2017 introduction in general , stress and earthquakes are known to be interrelated : stress triggers earthquakes and earthquakes alter the shear and normal stresses in surrounding faults1 - 5 .
during the 2011 tohoku - oki , japan , earthquake ( mw 9.0 ) , rupture of the plate boundary fault between the pacific plate and the north american plate caused a distinct decrease in stress in the earthquake source region6 - 9 .
stress states outside the earthquake source region may differ from those inside the area .
understanding of the stress state outside an earthquake source region both before and after a great earthquake may provide important evidence to explain how rupture propagation behaved outside the source region during the event .
the determination of the absolute magnitude of stress is also an important consideration in engineering fields that involve the earth 's crust , such as exploration for oil and natural gas , the extraction of geothermal energy and deep mining at depths of several kilometres .
moreover , in situ rock stress is an important concern in the construction of tunnels and underground caverns at depths of tens or even several hundreds of metres .
for such purposes , several in situ rock stress measurements have been performed at the kamaishi mine in northeast japan ( fig. 1 ( a )) from 1991 to 200710 - 15 .
the coseismic slip of the plate interface below the kamaishi region during the tohoku - oki earthquake was relatively slight16 - 19 ( fig. 1 ( a )) , and this may have acted as a barrier to further rupture propagation during the earthquake .
generally , coulomb stress change is used to estimate the stress field after an earthquake ; for example , toda et al.20 , hiratsuka and sato21 and sato et al.22 reported preliminary results for the coulomb stress change after the tohoku - oki earthquake .
however , the coulomb stress is an estimate of the stress difference based on the slip distribution assuming the target fault .
therefore , it is important to clarify the change in the absolute magnitude of stress before and after the earthquake .
for this purpose , the results of stress measurements before the earthquake are indispensable , because they cannot be obtained after the earthquake .
the stress measurements prior to the tohoku - oki earthquake provided us with a unique opportunity to examine the change in stress in the kamaishi mine before and after the tohoku - oki earthquake .
consequently , we regularly repeated stress measurements at the same research site in the kamaishi mine after the earthquake using the same method as studies conducted prior to the earthquake .

( this figure was generated using adobe illustrator software , version number illustrator cs5 15.1.0 ) ( d ) plan view of the measurement station .
the measurement station is located where two galleries ( width ~ 5.5 m , height ~ 7 m ) are adjacent .
in situ stress measurements were performed in four boreholes ( sko - 1 , sko - 2 , sko - 3 and sko - 4 ) , which are denoted by thick solid lines and a red broken line .
the star in this figure indicates the k - 5 measurement borehole used by sakaguchi et al.11 with the dccbo technique using a downward borehole from the gallery floor .
results research site and stress measurements the kamaishi mine was originally developed as an underground metal mine and is not currently operational .
its main drifts and galleries are now maintained as a source of mineral water for drinking and are also used for scientific research .
this mine is located about 170 km northwest of the tohoku - oki earthquake epicenter .
coseismic slip of the plate fault beneath the onshore kamaishi region and the offshore kamaishi region ( hereafter the kamaishi regions ) during the tohoku earthquake can be considered to be quite small based on the shape of the seismic slip contour line of 5 m ( fig. 1 ( a )) .
it has been reported that the coseismic surface crustal movement during the earthquake in this region consisted of horizontal movement ( to the east - southeast ) of 3.32 m and subsidence of 0.5 m23 .
in this study , we selected a measurement station ( 39degrees19'n , 141degrees40'e ) that is about 5 km from the mine opening at the 550 ml site at the kamaishi mine ( fig. 1 ( b and c )) .
the stress state around this measurement station is not affected by galleries or goaf caverns because the measurement points are sufficiently far from the galleries and / or caverns .
this study area is near the centre of the kurihashi granodiorite body .
the kurihashi granodiorite is one of several early cretaceous ( 120 - 110 ma ) granite bodies intruded into the palaeozoic - mesozoic sedimentary rocks in the kitakami area24 .
the mean values of the young 's modulus , poisson 's ratio and the unit volume weight of this rock at the measurement station are 52 gpa , 0.17 and 27 kn / m3 , respectively .
additionally , there are no active faults in the region shown in fig. 1 ( b ) [ active fault database of japan , https :// gbank.gsj.jp / activefault / index _ e _ gmap.html ] .
furthermore , no seismicity was detected within 15 km of the mine in the seismicity observations conducted by jnc between 1990 and 199815 .
the stress measurement stations ( k - 1 to k - 5 ) used both before and after the tohoku - oki earthquake occur within a distance of about 1.5 km ( north to south ; fig. 1 ( c )) .
the overburden at this measurement station is about 290 m. we performed stress measurements four times after the earthquake .
the first measurement ( sko - 1 ) was carried out from february 27 to march 1 , 2012 , the second ( sko - 2 ) from december 17 to 19 , 2012 , the third ( sko - 3 ) from march 10 to 12 , 2014 and the fourth ( sko - 4 ) from march 14 to 17 , 2016 , approximately 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 years after the earthquake , respectively .
the four horizontal boreholes used for stress measurements ( sko - 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) were aligned in parallel at 1 - m intervals ( fig. 1 ( d )) .
for each borehole , we performed three to five measurements .
measurements were performed using the compact conical - ended borehole overcoring ( ccbo ) technique14 , 25 .
the ccbo technique is a type of overcoring , which is a stress relief method .
in this method , a suite of strain sensors ( or displacement sensors ) is first set on the wall or the bottom of a borehole , and then overcoring , which is core - boring to isolate a rock sample and strain sensors from the rock mass to relieve in situ stress , is conducted .
the relieved strain / displacement that accompanies the overcoring process is monitored continuously .
the absolute value of a three - dimensional stress tensor can then be determined based on the elastic theory using the final relieved strain .
the ccbo technique is an improved method that offers greater accuracy and economy ; it has been suggested by the international society for rock mechanics ( isrm ) 14 and is also authorised as a standard method of the japanese geotechnical society ( jgs ) 26 .
the ccbo technique has been applied in japan and in other countries27 - 30 .
details of the measurement methods used in this study are provided in the methods section ( ccbo technique ) and supplementary information ( supplementary figure 1 ) .
we monitored the elastic strain in a total of 24 directions using eight rosette - type strain gauges ( with three components in three directions ) during the overcoring process ( fig. 2 ) .
although the depth from the gallery wall and the position of each strain gauge in the borehole socket were almost the same , the strain values for sko - 1 (~ 1 year after the mainshock ) were greater than those of the other three boreholes , and the strains for sko - 2 (~ 2 years after the mainshock ) were greater than those for sko - 3 (~ 3 years after the mainshock ) .
moreover , the strain for sko - 4 (~ 5 years after the mainshock ) was the same as that for sko - 2 .
this result suggests that the stress level at the time of measurement decreased in the order sko - 1 , 2 , 4 and 3 , because the lithology was similar for all boreholes .
the strain curves shown in fig. 2 are for only one measurement point for each of sko - 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ; however , a similar trend was observed for the other measurement points .
moreover , the shapes of strain ( epsilon rho , epsilon theta , epsilon phi ) in three typical directions ( see supplementary figure 2 for the details ) during the overcoring process are consistent with the theoretical shape based on the elastic theory14 ( see supplementary figure 3 for the details ) .

the x - axis is the advance of overcoring , and zero on the x - axis corresponds to the position of strain gauges on the strain sensor for the ccbo technique .
strains of the theta - axis are denoted by blue lines , rho - axis strains by red lines and phi - axis strains by green lines .

orientation of the principal stresses the maximum principal stress sigma 1 determined in this study was oriented north - south both before and after the tohoku - oki earthquake ( fig. 3 ) .
this finding is consistent with previous studies regarding the sigma 1 orientation in the kamaishi mine31 .
in contrast , both the intermediate principal stress sigma 2 and the minimum principal stress sigma 3 show clear differences before and after the earthquake .
the intermediate principal stress sigma 2 of the measurements , with the exception of k - 2 , had a steep dip angle more than 30degrees before the earthquake but was almost horizontal after the earthquake .
throughout the four measurements after the earthquake , the intermediate principal stress sigma 2 was in an east - west horizontal direction with very small dip angles , and the minimum principal stress sigma 3 was vertical .
overall , the stress states both before and after the earthquake are consistent with a reverse - faulting stress regime , which is consistent with the foreshocks and aftershocks in the kamaishi regions32 .
this regime was maintained for up to the last measurement at ~ 5 years after the earthquake .

( a ) results obtained before the earthquake ( k - 1 to k - 5 ) .
( b ) results from 1 year after to 5 years after the earthquake .
these results are the mean values .
these mean values of the direction of principal stresses were calculated by averaging the values of the principal stresses at every measuring point .
magnitudes of the principal stresses and the overburden pressure there is a clear difference in the magnitudes of the principal stresses before and after the earthquake ( fig. 4 ( a )) .
the magnitudes of the principal stresses 1 year post - earthquake were two to three times greater than those before the earthquake .
however , 2 years after the earthquake , the magnitudes of the intermediate principal stress and the minimum principal stress were almost the same as those before the earthquake , whereas the magnitude of the maximum principal stress was similar to the values in 1991 and 1994 but still larger than that in 2007 , which was thought to entail some uncertainty .
the magnitude of the maximum principal stresses 3 years after the earthquake was smaller than the values in 1991 and 1994 .
however , 5 years after the earthquake , the magnitudes of principal stresses had returned to the same level as in 1991 and 1994 .
figure 4 annual trends in the stress state .
the results after the tohoku - oki earthquake are mean values .
( a ) the three principal stress magnitudes ( sigma 1 , sigma 2 , sigma 3 ) .
these mean values of principal stresses were calculated by averaging the principal stress at every measuring point .
( b ) the ratio of the vertical stress p v to the overburden pressure p v calculated as ( gravitational acceleration ) x ( depth ) x ( average density determined from rock samples to be 2.7 ton / m3 ) .
the error of overburden pressure p v was evaluated assuming that the measured value of overburden ( depth ) has an error +/ - 10 m .
( c ) the maximum shear stress (=( sigma 1 - sigma 3 )/ 2 ) .
figure 4 ( b ) shows the ratio of the vertical stress sigma v to the overburden pressure p v as estimated from the rock density and the depth from the ground surface just above the measurement station .
the magnitude of the vertical stress sigma v was almost the same as the overburden pressure except at 1 year after the earthquake : the magnitude of sigma v at 1 year post - earthquake was approximately 2.4 times greater than the overburden pressure ( fig. 4 ( b )) .
theoretically , the static vertical stress has to be in a state of mechanical equilibrium with the overburden pressure .
in the study area , the topography is steep : three tall mountains with altitudes of approximate 1300 m are located within 3 km of the stress measurement station ( fig. 1 ( b )) .
these three mountains are approximately 300 - 400 m higher than the ground surface immediately above the measurement station .
as the height difference is larger than the overburden ~ 290 m above the measurement station , a higher vertical stress magnitude of more than two times of the overburden pressure can be considered to be possible for a short period of time ( 1 or 2 years ) .
maximum shear stress from the measured maximum and minimum stress magnitudes , we calculated the maximum shear stress , tau max = ( sigma 1 - sigma 3 )/ 2 ( fig. 4 ( c )) .
as with the three principal stresses , the magnitude of the maximum shear stress increased as a result of the tohoku - oki mainshock , decreased until 3 years after the earthquake and subsequently returned to an increasing trend 5 years after the earthquake .
this shear stress measured in 2007 , which showed a small value , was probably affected by the uncertainty of the maximum principal stress value in the 2007 measurement , for which a vertical borehole was used , in contrast to the horizontal boreholes for the measurements in other years .
in summary , the results ( k - 2 , 3 , 4 ) in the same year ( 1994 ) exhibited good repeatability with regard to orientation and magnitude ; in addition , the results of repeated measurements from 1991 to 2016 showed reasonable trends , good repeatability and sufficient precision ( figs 3 and 4 ) .
therefore , we conclude that these results are reliable and correct , despite exhibiting some scatter .
discussion the kamaishi regions ( both onshore and offshore ) were called the sanriku - oki low - seismicity region ( slsr ) , which is located near the northern termination of the tohoku - oki mainshock rupture , by ye et al.33 ( pink rectangular frame in fig. 1 ( a )) .
the slsr lacks historical great earthquake e.g. greater than m7 class earthquakes and has shown relatively low levels of moderate - size earthquakes ( m = 4.7 - 5.1 ) over the ~ 50 years before the 2011 tohoku - oki earthquake at an average interval of 5.5 years33 , 34 .
however , earthquakes in the slsr suddenly became much more frequent after the tohoku - oki mainshock , and the magnitudes of those earthquakes increased34 .
furthermore , the interval between earthquakes off kamaishi gradually increased with time after the tohoku - oki mainshock , from about ten days in the first month after the mainshock ( three m5.5 - 5.9 aftershock occurred in one month ) to approximately 0.3 years in the first year after the mainshock .
at the same time , the magnitudes of these earthquakes returned to the same levels as those before the mainshock .
our stress measurements after the tohoku - oki earthquake and those obtained in previous studies in 1991 - 2007 in the kamaishi mine showed that the magnitudes of the three principal stresses and the maximum shear stress rose suddenly just after the mainshock , then gradually decreased and returned to almost the same levels as those before the mainshock within approximately 5 years .
although the depth of our stress measurements was much shallower than the plate boundary fault , which is at about 50 km depth , from the results of the stress measurements and the seismicity in the kamaishi regions before and after the tohoku - oki mainshock , we can suggest that the stress magnitudes in these regions suddenly increased because the kamaishi regions delimit the northern extent of the tohoku - oki mainshock rupture .
in other words , the kamaishi regions probably acted as a barrier to further rupture propagation during the tohoku - oki mainshock .
as a result of the sudden and dramatic increase in stress , earthquakes in offshore kamaishi became much more frequent and stronger just after the mainshock .
these earthquakes led to a decrease in the magnitude of stress in the kamaishi regions after 1 year following the mainshock .
finally , the stress magnitudes returned to almost the same levels as those before the tohoku - oki mainshock within 2 - 3 years , accompanied by a decrease in the frequency of aftershocks in offshore kamaishi .
iinuma et al.35 showed that the cumulative postseismic slip ( for the period from 23 april 2011 to 10 december 2011 ) of the 2011 tohoku - oki earthquake in offshore kamaishi was larger than that of surrounding regions .
moreover , toda et al.20 , hiratsuka and sato21 and sato et al.22 showed that the coulomb stress change ( deltacff ) around the kamaishi mine exhibited a positive trend after the tohoku - oki earthquake , and bletery et al.36 demonstrated that the stress drop altered to a negative trend after the mainshock ( see supplementary figure 8 ) .
additionally , ishibe et al.37 showed that the temporal changes in median deltacff from 2000 to the middle of 2015 .
the median values of deltacff rapidly increased just after the tohoku - oki mainshock , after which the median deltacff gradually decreased to background levels approximately 3 years after the mainshock .
uchida et al.38 showed that the stress drop due to earthquakes off kamaishi ( 20 mar .
2011 - 23 sep .
2011 ) was 2.4 mpa to 10.4 mpa .
these observations also support our interpretation of the stress change pattern examined in this study .
in other words , the build up and down of stress measured in the kamaishi mine has been influenced by the both the mainshock and the aftershock occurred off kamaishi. that is : i ) the stress magnitude in the kamaishi region drastically increased during the tohoku - oki mainshock because the region probably acted as a barrier to further rupture propagation ; ii ) the increased stress caused earthquakes in offshore kamaishi to occur more actively in terms of both frequency and magnitude ( ye et al.33 and ariyoshi et al.34 ) ; and therefore , iii ) the frequent aftershock occurrence cased the stress in kamaishi mine to decrease and to return to the approximately same level as before the 2011 tohoku - oki earthquake ( ishibe et al.37 ) as well as increasing the cumulative postseismic slip in this region ( iinuma et al.35 ) .
in addition , the consistency between the change in measured stress and the change in seismicity in the kamaishi regions suggests that the results of stress measurements , even those at a much shallower depth than the earthquake source fault , can be useful for understanding rupture - propagation behavior .
methods the ccbo technique the procedures used to measure in situ stress with the ccbo technique are illustrated in supplementary figure 1 .
we conducted five , three , three and four measurements at 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 years after the tohoku - oki earthquake , respectively ( see fig. 1 ( d ) in the main text ) .
the measurements in the sko - 1 borehole were performed at five measurement points located 20.06 m to 28.56 m from the gallery wall .
however , because of the possible influence of the gallery , the results at 20.06 m ( sko - 1 - oc1 ) and 23.57 m ( sko - 1 - oc2 ) were excluded from the analysis .
the results at 28.56 m ( sko - 1 - oc5 ) were also excluded , because of the lack of a borehole socket based on the appearance of the recovered core after measurement .
the measurements in the sko - 2 borehole were performed at three measurement points : 27.10 m ( sko - 2 - oc1 ) , 27.60 m ( sko - 2 - oc2 ) and 28.03 m ( sko - 2 - oc3 ) from the gallery wall .
the measurements in the sko - 3 borehole were performed at three measurement points : 27.10 m ( sko - 3 - oc1 ) , 27.82 m ( sko - 3 - oc2 ) and 28.17 m ( sko - 3 - oc3 ) .
the measurements in the sko - 4 borehole were performed at four measurement points : 27.11 m ( sko - 4 - oc1 ) , 27.95 m ( sko - 4 - oc2 ) , 28.52 m ( sko - 4 - oc3 ) and 28.98 m ( sko - 4 - oc4 ) .
however , because of the technical problem , the result at 27.11 m ( sko - 4 - oc1 ) was excluded from the analysis .
there were no problems with any of the other measurements .
estimation of young 's modulus and poisson 's ratio the young 's modulus and poisson 's ratio were determined by a multi - stage uniaxial compression test26 .
the specimens were prepared from the recovered core with a strain cell ( supplementary figure 4 ) .
three mutually perpendicular cylindrical rock - core specimens 25 mm in diameter and 50 mm in length were prepared by drilling the recovered core with the strain cell .
two cross - type strain gauges were used to measure the strain response of each specimen .
the strain gauges were bonded to the cylindrical surface of the specimens at a height of 12.5 mm at an offset of 180degrees .
cyclic loading and unloading was performed five to seven times at a loading rate of about 0.1 - 0.2 mpa / sec ( supplementary figure 5 ) .
the maximum load during the loading cycle was set to twice the overburden pressure at the measurement station .
the young 's modulus and poisson 's ratio were determined from the stress - strain relation ( supplementary figure 6 ) and the linear relation between the axial stress and the strain recovery ( supplementary figure 7 ) .
supplementary figure 7 was drawn as follows : the axial stress and recovered axial and lateral strains from the beginning to the end of unloading were read in each cyclic loading and plotted as shown in supplementary figure 6 .
the data were subjected to the least - squares method to determine the gradients of stress : axial and lateral strain .
the slope of the line approximated from the axial stresses and strains is defined as the young 's modulus , and the ratio of the slope of the axial relation to that of the lateral relation is defined as the poisson 's ratio .
anisotropy of young 's modulus and poisson 's ratio the degree of anisotropy of the young 's modulus was 1.5 % - 8.2 % ; in contrast , the poisson 's ratio did not show anisotropy .
we used the mean values of the young 's modulus and poisson 's ratio at each measurement point to evaluate the in situ stress under the assumption of isotropy .
therefore , the evaluated stress in this study includes approximately a few percent uncertainty .

prostate carcinoma ( pca ) is one of the most common cancers in men .
prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) has been widely used to predict the outcome of pca and screening with psa has resulted in a decline in mortality .
however , psa is not an optimal prognostic tool as its sensitivity may be too low to reduce morbidity and mortality .
consequently , there is a demand for additional robust biomarkers for prostate cancer .
death receptor 5 ( dr5 ) has been implicated in the prognosis of several cancers and it has been previously shown that it is negatively regulated by yin yang 1 ( yy1 ) in prostate cancer cell lines .
the present study investigated the clinical significance of dr5 expression in a prostate cancer patient cohort and its correlation with yy1 expression .
immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression distribution was performed using tissue microarray constructs from 54 primary pca and 39 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( pin ) specimens .
dr5 expression was dramatically reduced as a function of higher tumor grade. by contrast , yy1 expression was elevated in pca tumors as compared with that in pin , and was increased with higher tumor grade .
dr5 had an inverse correlation with yy1 expression .
bioinformatic analyses corroborated these data .
the present findings suggested that dr5 and yy1 expression levels may serve as progression biomarkers for prostate cancer .
death receptor 5 yin yang 1 prostate cancer tissue microarray introduction prostate cancer ( pca ) is the second leading cause of cancer - associated mortality in the united states and the first in mexico among men .
pca is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in males ( 1,2 ) .
most pca - associated mortalities are due to advanced disease , and androgen deprivation therapy is considered the primary approach in the treatment of symptomatic advanced prostate cancer ( 3 ) .
this treatment option is palliative rather than curative and although it can marginally improve the likelihood of survival , the majority of all patients progress to hormone - refractory pca .
the rate of pca is highest among caucasians and african - americans .
the pathogenesis of pca is very long and results in frequent hospital visits , which causes a high cost of treatment ( 4 - 6 ) .
although the survival rates for pca patients are high , because of the slow and steady nature of the disease , 30 - 40 % of patients experience prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) recurrence within 10 years of surgery or radiation treatment ( 7 ) .
furthermore , tumor cells ultimately develop resistance to therapy ; however , there are few alternative treatments available .
consequently , the median survival of advanced and recurring disease in patients with prostate cancer is drastically reduced ( 8 ) .
an increase in circulating psa levels following definitive therapy usually accurately predicts progressive disease .
psa can have a prognostic significance prior to therapy , since lower psa levels indicate that the disease will not likely recur and higher levels indicate future resistance to therapy ( 9 ) .
psa , however , is a problematic screening tool since the overall sensitivity may be too low to effectively predict mortality / survival rates ( 10 ) .
conversely , increasing the sensitivity of psa may result in false - positive diagnosis of the disease , since the majority of males with pca will die of unrelated causes ( 11 ) .
novel pca biomarkers are required , which should have the ability to distinguish between a benign and a malignant disease ( 12,13 ) .
apoptosis through the activation of two predominant pathways may be induced by the binding of ligands to specific receptors on the cell surface , or by non - specific cellular stress ( 14 ) .
both pathways converge at the level of the caspases , which mediate cell death via cleavage of various cellular substrates .
death receptors ( dr ) 4 and 5 bind to the tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( trail ) , which results in the recruitment of the fas - associated death domain ( fadd ) to the intracellular death domain and subsequently induces the cleavage of procaspase - 8 which initiates a cascade of events leading downstream to apoptosis ( 15 - 18 ) .
reported studies have demonstrated that the surface expression of dr5 is a potentially useful prognostic marker in various cancers ( 19 ) .
the progression of melanoma has been previously associated with a decrease in dr5 and dr4 expression ( 20 ) .
furthermore , dr5 , along with other trail receptors , was shown to be useful in determining the risk of breast cancer metastasis and patient survival ( 21 ) .
however , other studies have shown that dr5 was not a significant prognostic marker ( 22,23 ) .
these observations suggested that the prognostic value of dr5 may be cancer type - specific .
in these cases , the role of dr5 repression in pca was not examined .
a previous study by our group reported that the transcription factor yin yang 1 ( yy1 ) may function in the pathogenesis of pca .
high expression levels of yy1 were associated with tumor progression , and patient survival was linked to lower levels of yy1 ( 24 ) .
in addition , it was previously demonstrated that yy1 may transcriptionally repress dr5 expression in prostate cancer cell lines ( 25 - 27 ) .
the present study investigated the expression levels of dr5 in pca and its clinical significance .
since it was reported that yy1 negatively regulates dr5 expression and that yy1 is overexpressed in pca ( 24,25 ) , it was hypothesized that dr5 expression may be inhibited in pca and may be inversely correlated with yy1 expression .
this hypothesis was tested by immunohistochemistry ( ihc ) on tissue microarray ( tma ) constructs , prepared with tumor tissues derived from patients with pca and pin .
materials and methods patients the study was approved by the ethics committee of the children hospital of mexico ' federico gomez ' ( mexico city , mexico ; him / 2007 / 061 ) .
the study cohort consisted of samples from 93 randomly selected hormone - naive patients , who underwent radical retropubic prostasectomy or transurethral resection between 2002 and 2007 from the department of pathology of hospital general regional no .
25 , imss and speciality hospital cmn ' la raza ' , imss ( mexico city , mexico ) .
the cohort consisted of 20 low grade pin low grade ( lg pin ) , 19 high grade pin ( hg pin ) and 54 pca samples .
the 54 cases of pca were classified according to the gleason score as follows : 27 low - grade prostatic carcinoma [ gleason score 2 - 5 ( lg pca )] and 27 high - grade prostatic carcinoma [ gleason score 6 - 10 ( hg pca )] .
prostate tma construction formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded archival tumor specimens were prepared at the immunology and infection research unit , national medical center ' la raza ' and at the oncology disease research unit , children hospital of mexico ' federico gomez ' , ssa .
at least three core tissue biopsies ( each 0.6 mm in diameter ) were taken from morphologically representative regions of each prostate tumor and precisely arrayed as previously described ( 29 - 31 ) .
tumor samples were accompanied by matching benign ( morphologically normal or hyperplasic ) and pin lesions , where available .
tissues were arrayed into five tma blocks .
for staining , sections ( 4 mum ) were transferred to glass slides using an adhesive slide system ( psa - cs 4 ; instrumedics , inc. , st. louis , mo , usa ) to support cohesion of the array elements .
immunohistochemical analysis slices cut at 4 mum for the tma were placed on slides and either stained with mayer 's hematoxylin and eosin ( h & e ) for histopathological examination , or used for subsequent immunohistochemical analysis .
the expression levels of dr5 and yy1 were determined using dr5 ( abcam , cambridge , ma , usa ) and yy1 ( santa cruz biotechnology , inc. , santa cruz , ca , usa ) antibodies .
antigen retrieval was performed by immersing the slides in a solution of 0.01 % sodium citrate ph 6.0 for 5 min in boiling water .
endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by immersing the slides in 3 % h2o2 - methanol and background - unspecific binding was decreased by incubating the slides in 2 % bovine serum albumin ( bsa ; sigma - aldrich , st. louis , mo , usa ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( pbs ) for 60 min .
the slides were incubated overnight at room temperature with predetermined optimal concentrations of anti - dr5 polyclonal antibody ( 1:500 ) and anti - yy1 polyclonal antibody ( 1:750 ) .
in order to decrease variability , all samples were processed at the same time in a single experiment , using a single batch of antibody diluted in pbs - bsa .
following washing , the slides were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody ( universal lsab kit ; dako corporation , carpinteria , ca , usa ) for 30 min at room temperature , followed by incubation with a streptavidin - horseradish peroxidase conjugate ( universal lsab kit ) for 30 min at room temperature and then with 3,3 ' - diaminobenzidine tetra - hydrochloride ( liquid dab , dako corporation ) .
the reaction was stopped ny adding distilled water and the slides were counterstained with h & e. the tissue was washed in tap water for 5 min , dehydrated using an ethanol series ( 70 , 90 and 100 %) in xylene and mounted with e - 2 mounting medium ( shandon lab , pittsburgh , pa , usa ) .
the slides were then analyzed by light microscopy ( olympus bx - 40 ; olympus corporation , tokyo , japan ) .
scoring of immunohistochemical staining a semi - quantitative assessment of tissue antibody staining was conducted by an expert pathologist on prostate analysis , who was blinded to the pathological variables .
the stained slides were verified by a second expert to ensure consistency in the scoring .
positive expression was scored based on either a positive staining on the membrane ( dr5 ) or positive staining only in the nucleus ( yy1 ) .
data are presented as positively stained target cells per 100 cells ( range 0 - 100 % positive ) , per tissue region in the tma ( 4 regions in each slide ) .
in addition , the integrated optical density ( iod ) in ~ 300 mum2 regions per sample , selected randomly using the image pro - plus 6.4 software ( media cybernetics , bethesda , md , usa ) , were analyzed .
the analysis of the expression levels on the tmas was performed in a blind manner .
the tma spot was a second blinded quantitative assessment by the same pathologist .
the target tissue for scoring was the glandular prostatic epithelium and the scoring of benign tissues did not include basal cells .
the tissue spot histology and grading were confirmed on the counterstained study slides .
positive expression , indicated by a brown color , was quantified using the iods .
the density of the staining intensity in each region was analyzed using the image pro - plus 6.2 software ( mediacybernetics , rockville , md , usa ) that was obtained with the diffusion of the light wavelength through the color density in the cells stained brown .
the target tissue for scoring was performed in the malignant cells by considering the nuclear staining pattern for yy1 and the membrane cytoplasmic staining pattern for dr5 .
yy1 nuclear expression and dr5 cytoplasmic membrane expression were scored using two measures , negative and positive ( weakly , moderately and strongly positive ) intensities , in target cells .
the data are presented as positively stained target cells per 100 cells ( range 0 - 100 % positive ) , per region on each spot ( four regions in each spot ) , or as density , whereby four 100 mum2 regions per spot were selected randomly to represent expression within each case .
the mean pooled integrated intensity of the tumor or control spots was used .
statistical analysis the data were analyzed using student 's t - test for parametric data and the mann - whitney test for non - parametric data .
to analyze normalized data , both the analysis of variance ( anova ) and the bonferroni tests were used .
p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference .
the optimal cut - point for dichotomized pca malignancy data was determined using the gleason scoring system ( 32 ) .
the yy1 - iod - expression and dr5 expression were quantified by determining the sum of the iods and the mean was calculated for each pathological group ( malignant cells ) .
for yy1 nuclear and dr - 5 cytoplasmic membrane staining , the percentage of positive malignant cells ( weak to strong brown staining ) was obtained .
descriptive statistics were gathered for all the assembled data .
for differences between the pathological groups that were used , student 's t test and the anova pearson 's tests were used to analyze correlations of parametric data , respectively .
box plots to compare the various groups ( central tendency , dispersion and symmetry of the data ) were generated .
p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference .
all statistical analyses were performed using ssps 11 statistical analysis program for windows ( spss inc. , chicago , il , usa ) and graphpad prism 5.0 ( graphpad , san diego , ca , usa ) .
comparative metaprofiling of cdna expression data the oncomine premium database ( oncomine ( tm ) compendia bioscience , ann arbor , mi , usa ) was used for analysis and visualization of the bioinformatics analyses ( www.oncomine.com ) .
the differential expression analysis of yy1 and dr5 in existing prostate cancer microarray datasets was analyzed by setting a threshold value for gene rank at 10 % and p < 0.05 .
results evaluation of yy1 and dr5 protein expression in human prostate cancer tissues using immunohistochemical analysis , the yy1 and dr5 expression in pca tissue microarray samples was examined .
the expression of yy1 ( fig. 1aa and b ; fig. 1ba and b ) and dr5 ( fig. 1ac and d ; fig. 1bc and d ) in human pca tissues were examined in the pin and malignant glandular epithelium ( figs. 1 and 2 , respectively ) .
yy1 was expressed predominantly in the nucleus and diffusely in the cytoplasm .
dr5 was expressed on the membrane and in the cytoplasm .
the expression of yy1 in the pin samples was weak and predominantly localized to the cytoplasm. by contrast , the dr5 expression in the pin samples was detected in the membrane and in the cytoplasm .
in tumor samples , the yy1 expression was directly proportional to the malignant grade , whereby the highest expression was observed in hg pca as compared with the expression in the lg pca ( fig. 2aa and b ). by contrast , the dr5 expression was inversely proportional to the tumor grade ( low in hg pca and high in lg pca ) ( fig. 2ac and d ) .
overexpression of yy1 and dowregulation of dr5 in pca tissues the expression of yy1 and dr5 was quantified by semiquantitative and quantitative assessments ( fig. 2b ) .
there was a significant difference in the expression of yy1 between the lg pin and hg pin ( fig. 2ba ) .
in addition , there was a significant difference in the dr5 expression between the lg pin and hg pin samples ( fig. 2bb ) ( p = 0.001 ) .
yy1 was significantly elevated in pca tissues as compared with the pin tissues .
yy1 expression was barely detectable in pin tissues and was significantly increased ( p < 0.001 , anova ) with an increase in tumor grade .
this observation was similar in both the density quantification ( fig. 2aa ) and positive cell counts ( nuclear ) ( fig. 2bc ) .
an opposite effect was observed in the dr5 expression , whereby both the density of staining ( fig. 2ab ) and the positive cell counts ( membrane ) ( fig. 2bd ) were significantly decreased ( p < 0.001 , anova ) as a function of the tumor grade .
the highest levels of expression were observed in the pin samples ( fig. 2ac and d ) .
inverse correlation between dr5 and yy1 expressions in pca tissues a pearson 's analysis was performed , based on the yy1 and dr5 expression in all of the tumor samples .
the expression levels of yy1 and dr5 were found to be inversely correlated in both the lg pca ( p < 0.036 , r pearson = - 0.406 ) and hg pca ( p < 0.0001 , r pearson = - 0.611 ) samples ( table i ) .
bioinformatic analyses of yy1 and tnfrsf10b ( dr5 ) gene expression in prostate adenocarcinoma analysis of the tnfrsf10b ( dr5 ) expression levels in different prostate tumors was performed using a public data set of microarrays retrieved from the oncomine database and gene expression omnibus , derived from the published analysis reported by vanaja et al ( 28 ) and wallace et al ( 29 ) .
the microarray data included 69 prostate adenocarcinomas and were compared with 20 samples from the prostate gland .
in addition , yy1 and dr5 gene expression from the prostate adenocarcinoma samples were analyzed in the same data sets and compared with the prostate gland .
the tumors showed low expression of dr5 as compared with the normal tissues ( p = 0.05 or 0.02 , respectively ) .
a higher expression of yy1 was observed in the same data sets as compared with the normal tissues ( p < 0.05 ) ( fig. 3 ) .
an inverse correlation of expression was observed between dr5 and yy1 in pca .
these findings were concordant with other database and gene expression analyses ( 30 - 33 ) .
discussion the present study has shown for the first time , to the best of our knowledge , the underexpression of dr5 in prostate cancer cell lines and patient - derived tumor tissues .
the transcriptional regulation of dr5 was previously reported to be , at least in part , due to the repressor activity of yy1 ( 25 ) .
the present study therefore hypothesized that the transcriptional regulation of dr5 in human pca would additionally be negatively regulated through the overexpression of yy1 .
the data of the present study confirmed this hypothesis and demonstrated an inverse correlation between the expression of dr5 and yy1 .
the experimental findings were corroborated by bioinformatic analyses .
these data suggested that the expression levels of dr5 and yy1 in pca may be novel prognostic factors in the progression of pca .
the targeting of dr5 by trail or anti - dr5 monoclonal antibodies has been the focus of various clinical trials in clinical cancers ( 34 - 36 ) .
the approach to inhibit the repression of dr5 through targeting yy1 will result in the upregulation of dr5 and its response to trail - induced apoptosis .
we have previously demonstrated that the inhibition of yy1 by yy1 - specific sirna in pca cells resulted in sensitization of pca cells to trail apoptosis ( 37 ) .
it has been additionally shown that several anticancer agents overcome resistance to apo2l / trail through the upregulation of dr5 in malignant cells ( 25,38 ) .
in addition , the lower expression of dr5 has been noted in various types of cancer , including breast ( 39 ) , lung ( 40 ) , colorectal ( 41 ) and esophageal ( 42 ) cancers .
gene silencing of dr5 and dr4 was shown to abolish trail - induced apoptosis ( 43 ). of note , the expression levels of dr5 have been described as a potentially useful prognostic marker in various cancers , including melanoma , where the decrease in dr5 expression was identified to be correlated with the progression as well as metastasis of the disease ( 20 ) .
furthermore , dr5 expression was shown to be negatively correlated with the overall survival of breast cancer patients ( 22 ) .
dr5 , however , was not found to be a significant prognostic marker in cervical or colon cancers ( 22,23 ) .
these observations suggested that the prognostic value of dr5 may be cancer type - specific .
in pca , the significance of dr5 expression had not been previously explored and the present findings suggested that it may be a significant novel prognostic marker in the progression of pca .
the transcription factor yy1 is expressed in normal tissues and is upregulated in various types of cancer , including pca , with positive and negative regulatory effects on gene expression .
elevated yy1 expression is correlated with the development of pin and advanced prostate cancer ( 44,45 ) .
the results of the present study regarding the expression of yy1 and its correlation with the tumor grade are consistent with previous findings , which have linked higher yy1 expression to tumors , as compared with benign tissues .
in the present study , it was shown that yy1 was overexpressed in tumor samples as compared with pin .
the overexpression gradually increased with higher tumor grades ( fig. 2a and b ). by contrast , dr5 was considerably higher in pin as compared to tumors .
this downregulation of dr5 in the tumors decreased further with increasing tumor grade ( figs. 1 and 2 ) .
in addition , pearson 's analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between the expression of yy1 and dr5 in pca tissues ( fig. 3 ) .
this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that yy1 negatively regulates dr5 and this inverse correlation in pca patient samples has an important implication in the development of this disease .
high dr5 expression has been linked to trail - mediated apoptosis ( 15,25 - 27 ) .
dr5 expression was shown to be low in the tumors as compared with pin , which suggested that the tumor cells may be resistant to trail - mediated apoptosis .
this is relevant since the trail - dr5 - mediated apoptotic pathway is involved in the immune - mediated apoptosis signaling response by cytotoxic t lymphocytes and natural killer cells ( 46 ) .
these results additionally suggested a mechanism whereby patient tumors with high yy1 expression and , therefore , low dr5 expression ( repressed by yy1 ) , would experience higher apoptosis resistance to both immune and chemotherapeutic drugs and , consequently , develop tumors of higher grades as a consequence of tumor unresponsiveness to therapy .
the present findings have only examined the expression of dr5 in pca and several reports have demonstrated that dr5 is the preferential receptor - inducing signal for trail apoptosis ( 25,27,39 ) .
the expression of dr4 and its role in trail - induced apoptosis , however , cannot be ruled out .
the expression of dr5 and dr4 is reduced in prostate tumors in comparison with that in benign tissues .
low expression of death receptors suggests resistance to apoptosis and , thus , increased tumorigenesis .
however , yy1 has not been shown to regulate dr4 thus far to the best of our knowledge ( 47 ) .
additional studies are therefore required to determine the role of dr4 in pca and its clinical significance .
in conclusion , the present study demonstrated the clinical significance of dr5 downregulation in pca and its inverse correlation with the expression of yy1 .
in addition , these data suggest a potential prognostic significance of both dr5 and yy1 in the progression of pca .

figure 2 expression and distribution of yy1 and dr5 in pin and pca in tmas stratified by histological category .
( a ) the yy1 iod and nuclear staining expression , and the dr5 iod and dr5 protein expression in the cytoplasm and membrane , determined by immunohistochemistry , are shown as means represented as a bar graph , from the data of 270 informative tissue microarray spots containing nl ( n = 54 ) , lg pin ( n = 20 ) , hg pin ( n = 19 ) , lg pca ( n = 27 ) , and hgpca ( n = 27 ) .
( a ) the mean yy1 iod was significantly higher in the lg pca ( iod = 3675 , p < 0.001 ) and highest in the hg pca ( iod = 9042 p < 0.001 ) as compared with the lg pin ( iod = 45 ) and the hg pin ( iod = 332 ) .
( b ) the mean dr5 iod was significantly lower in the lg pca ( iod = 3675 p < 0.001 ) and significantly lower or absent in the hg pca ( iod = 9042 , p < 0.001 ) as compared with the lg pin ( iod = 45 ) and the hg pin ( iod = 332 ) .
( c ) the mean yy1 expression in nuclear staining was significantly higher in the lg pca ( iod = 3675 , p < 0.001 ) and highest in the hgpca ( iod = 9042 , p < 0.001 ) as compared with the lg pin ( iod = 45 ) and the hg pin ( iod = 332 ) .
( d ) the mean dr5 expression in the cytoplasm membrane was significantly lower in the lg pca ( iod = 3675 , p < 0.001 ) and significantly lower or absent in the hg pca ( iod = 9042 , p < 0.001 ) as compared with the lg pin ( iod = 45 ) and the hg pin ( iod = 332 ) .
( b ) yy1 and dr5 boxplots on the pin and the pca of different degrees in the tmas , stratified by histological category .
the distribution of the study population into different groups is represented graphically .
( a ) yy1 iod distribution in the lg pin , hg pin , lg pca and hg pca .
both the pin box plots are short since the yy1 iod had a homogeneous distribution and minimal dispersion of cases .
the yy1 iod was low in both groups .
the yy1 iod expression in the pca groups had a box plot greater than the pin groups .
the yy1 iod was higher in both groups .
the lg pca box plot was less large , with a negative asymmetrical distribution , indicating that the majority of the measurements were lower than the hg pca , but higher than the pin groups .
in addition , there was a low dispersion due to the homogeneity of the measurements .
the hg pca box plot had a positive asymmetrical distribution , meaning that the majority of the measurements were higher than those of the other groups .
all the differences were statistically significant with p < 0.0001 .
( b ) dr5 iod distribution in lg pin , hg pin , lg pca and hg pca .
both pin box plots were shorter than those of the yy1 iod , most markedly in the hg pin group , where measures were greater .
the dispersion in both groups was minimal and although there was asymmetry , this indicated that the measurements were homogeneous .
the dr5 iod expression in the pca groups was very low , with a low dispersion , and a symmetrical and homogeneous distribution , which was due to low or absent expression .
all differences were statistically significant with p < 0.0001 .

the behaviour of the routers' buffer may affect the quality of service ( qos ) of network services under certain conditions , since it may modify some traffic characteristics , as delay or jitter , and may also drop packets .
as a consequence , the characterization of the buffer is interesting , especially when multimedia flows are transmitted and even more if they transport information with real - time requirements .
this work presents a new methodology with the aim of determining the technical and functional characteristics of real buffers ( i.e. , behaviour , size , limits , and input and output rate ) of a network path .
it permits the characterization of intermediate buffers of different devices in a network path across the internet .
1. introduction traditionally , the available bandwidth , delay , and jitter between two end - to - end devices have been used as a parameter that can give a rough idea of the expected quality of service ( qos ) .
but nowadays , we know that qos is also affected by the behaviour of the intermediate router buffer , which is mainly determined by its size and its management policies .
so , the buffer may cause different packet loss behaviour and may also modify some qos parameters .
many multimedia applications and services ( e.g. , videoconferencing , video streaming , peer - to - peer , and voip services ) take advantage of various available bandwidth estimations techniques and tools ( abett ) in order to improve some qos parameters .
but all these techniques have one thing in common : they are focused on links estimations at the core network where buffer behaviour and its parameters are not the principal priorities .
in general , buffers are used as a traffic regulation mechanism in network devices .
current core routers make extensive use of aqm ( active queue management ) disciplines which are able to maintain a shorter queue length than drop - tail queues ; this fights against bufferbloat and reduces latency .
but these techniques ( e.g. , red and sred ) require careful tuning of their parameters in order to provide good performance [ 1 ] .
there exist qos scheduling algorithms as weighted fair queuing ( wfq ) which is a data packet scheduling technique allowing different scheduling priorities to statistically multiplexed data flows .
however , some network points may become critical bottlenecks , mainly in access networks , because these networks' capabilities are lower than the ones available in the backbone , being the main cause of packet loss of the discarding of packets in router queues .
mid - and low - end routers , which do not implement advanced traffic management mechanisms , are usually used in access networks .
in this scenario , sme ( small and medium enterprises ) environments may be principally affected because of their modest infrastructure .
so the design characteristics of router buffers and the implemented scheduling policies are of primary importance in order to ensure the correct delivery of the traffic of different applications and services , so it will be useful to include buffer parameters in the link capacity estimation .
on the other hand , it is true that the performance of tcp ( transmission control protocol ) has been extensively studied and a big number of variants ( sack , new reno , vegas , etc. ) have been deployed in order to improve it. nevertheless , many multimedia applications and real - time services transport their information under udp ( user datagram protocol ) .
so , the applications have to describe certain network behaviour for optimizing traffic .
hence , the characterization of the technical and functional parameters of router buffer in sme environments becomes critical when planning a network or trying to provide certain levels of qos .
as a consequence , if the size and the behaviour of the buffer are known , some techniques can be used so as to improve link utilization , for example , multiplexing a number of small packets into a big one , fragmentation , smoothing traffic , and so forth .
a new methodology is presented in this paper in order to describe the access network by means of router buffer modelling ( e.g. , behaviour , size , limits , and input and output rate ) by the use of four simple steps which will be detailed in section 3.3 .
in particular we will estimate bandwidth , size , and behaviour because this gives us more useful link information , than only an estimation with abett techniques .
in addition , this methodology has been deployed in order to solve problems of resource consumption for processing data and inaccuracies when obtaining input rate estimations and buffer size as well .
the paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the related work , and section 3 describes the test methodology .
the next section covers the experimental results , and the paper ends with the conclusions .
2. related work 2.1 .
bandwidth estimations there exist several estimation techniques for obtaining available bandwidth .
a performance evaluation of pathload , pathchirp , spruce , igi , and abing in a flexible test bed was presented in [ 2 ] .
the results demonstrate that abetts are far from being ready to be applied in all applications and scenarios .
the evaluation includes scenarios in which the packet loss rate and the propagation delays of the links have been varied .
also , the amount of cross - traffic , the capacity of the links , and the cross - traffic packet size were tested for different values .
in [ 3 ] , the authors define probabilistic available bandwidth as the largest input rate at which we can send a traffic flow along a path while achieving , with specified probability , an output rate that is almost as large as the input rate .
the method is expressed directly in terms of the measurable output rate and includes adjustable parameters that allow the user to adapt to different application requirements .
it was proposed as a new definition for available bandwidth and a novel framework that addresses some issues : provide a confidence interval , be suited to the task of multipath estimation in large - scale networks , and provide enough flexibility in terms of accuracy , overhead , latency , and reliability to adapt to the requirements of various applications .
moreover , in [ 4 ] a novel tool for end - to - end abett prm ( probe gap models ) called quality monitoring and estimation ( qmoes ) was proposed , as a key component embedded in the rubens ( rethinking the usage of broadband access for experience - optimized networks and services ) architecture .
the results indicate that qmoes present a good performance in terms of accuracy and estimation time which validates the abett within the rubens framework .
2.2 .
buffer issues buffers are used to reduce packet loss by absorbing transient bursts of traffic when routers cannot forward them at that moment .
they are instrumental in keeping output links fully utilised during congestion times .
for many years , researchers accepted the so - called rule of thumb ( or bandwidth delay product , bdp ) to obtain the amount of buffering needed at a router 's output interface .
this rule was proposed in [ 5 ] and it is given by b = c x rtt , where b is the buffer size , rtt is the average round - trip time , and c the capacity of the router 's network interface .
in [ 6 ] a reduced buffer size was proposed by dividing the bdp by the square root of the number of tcp flows , n , b = c x rtt / n. this model was called small buffer .
in [ 7 ] the use of even smaller buffers , called tiny buffers , was suggested considering a size of some tens of packets .
in [ 8 ] , the authors presented a simple algorithm to manage a drop - tail queue , which adapts its size based on traffic conditions in order to obtain a minimum size and providing high level of utilization .
the results show that adaptive drop - tail achieves significantly smaller queues than current approaches at the expense of 1 - 2 % of the link utilization .
the buffer can be measured in different ways : maximum number of packets , amount of bytes , or even queueing time limit [ 9 , 10 ] .
for example , in [ 11 ] the routers of two manufacturers were compared , and it was observed that one measures the buffer in packets , whereas the other one does it in milliseconds .
moreover , the buffer must play an important role when planning a network because it can influence the packet loss of different services and applications .
the reason for this is that there is a relationship between router buffer size and link utilization , since an excessive amount of memory would generate a significant latency increment when the buffer is full .
on the other hand , a very small amount of memory in the buffer will increase packet loss in congestion time .
as a consequence , the knowledge of the buffer behaviour is an interesting parameter which can be considered when trying to improve link utilization .
2.3 .
the influence of the buffer on real - time services the influence of the router buffer on the subjective quality experienced by users of a interactive service ( i.e. , an online game ) with very tight real - time requirements was studied in [ 4 ] , showing the mutual relationship between the size and policies of the buffer and the obtained subjective quality , which mainly depends on delay and jitter in this case .
the study has been conducted , showing that tiny buffers are more adequate in order to maintain game quality in acceptable levels .
since , if it is too big it may add delay and jitter which are not acceptable for gamers .
a popular online , multiplayer , game server was studied in [ 12 ] ; the paper shows the results of a 500 - million packet trace in which the traffic behaviour describes a loaded game server and can be attributed to the fact that current game designs target the saturation of the narrowest , last - mile link .
online games try to provide relatively uniform experiences between all players , maximizing the interactivity of the game , so they fix their usage requirements in such a way as to saturate the network link of their lowest speed players .
the authors also comment that facing the stringent demands on interactivity , routers must be designed with enough capacity to manage such bursts without delay .
but current routers are designed for bulk data transfers with larger packets , so a significant deployment of online game servers will have the potential for overwhelming the current networking equipments .
several studies have characterized p2p video streaming applications and have measured their impact in the communication networks traffic .
so , in [ 13 ] a traffic characterization of major p2p - tv application was presented and they concluded that the traffic consists in a mixture of small packets ( signalling packets ) and large packets ( video packets ) .
in addition , the generation of high rates of small packets may penalize the video packets and consequently the peer 's behaviour within a p2p structure may not be as expected .
the application relies on udp traffic and it is revealed that this application faces a high overhead ; about 60 % of packets correspond to signalling , and the other 40 % correspond to video data packets .
in [ 14 ] , the results show that the presence of a bursty application ( video surveillance ) causes packet loss for all the coexisting applications , even for those generating constant bit rate traffic ( voip ) .
in addition , packet loss decreases when buffer size is increased , because big buffers can absorb the burst produced by the traffic mix .
as expected , packet loss increases when link utilization grows in the case of 40 - packet buffer ( figure 1 ) .
the tests were deployed in a scenario in which two ip camera flows , one videoconferencing session , and two voip calls are used as test traffic in two different tests : in the first one , the internet access link was set to an average link utilization of 70 % and different values of the buffer size were tested .
in the second tests , the buffer size of the internet access router was fixed at 40 packets and different values of the access bandwidth were used , so consequently different levels of link utilization ranged from 50 % to 90 % .
3. methodology for the characterization of internet paths the network path ( figure 2 ) is uncertain for most applications and services which only measure the available bandwidth , in order to limit the generated traffic and rarely to attune it ( e.g. , trough smoothing it ) .
thus , we propose a method for applications to discover and get advantage of knowing network characteristics by means of finding the buffer behaviour models which may be useful to correctly attune the traffic .
3.1 .
network path model traditionally a network path can be characterized by bandwidth , packet loss , and delay .
the premises of this work are that most of the network characteristics can be explained by buffer models .
we recommend a characterization by including buffer parameters ( size and input and output rate ) and buffer behaviour ; see figure 3 .
in this work , the buffer model only considers fifo queues since they are the most common in real access network devices as it was observed in [ 15 ] .
the same work also reported that the behaviour of these buffers can be characterized as follows : once the buffer gets completely full , no more packets or bytes are accepted until a certain amount of memory is available ; see figure 4 .
thus , an upper limit and a lower limit can be defined : when the upper limit is reached , no more packets or bytes are accepted until the size of the buffer corresponds to the lower limit .
there are some cases in which the difference between lower limit and upper limit is as small as one packet ; however , this difference sometimes reaches tens of packets .
generally speaking , a buffer drops packets in bursts .
the number of packets per burst depends on the relationship between the input and output rates .
when these rates are very similar , the number of packets in the burst can be just one packet .
3.2 .
test procedure the scheme of the tests is shown in figure 2 .
there is a " system under test " ( sut from now ) , which may be either a single device or an entire network .
the test is based on sending a burst of udp packets , all with the same length , from the source to the destination machine , so as to produce a buffer overflow in the sut .
all the transmitted packets are identified by a sequence number included in the payload .
3.3 .
methodology the methodology is based on the premise that the output rate can be obtained from traffic capture at the destination device .
this output rate depends on the technology used in each case ( ethernet , wi - fi , cablemodem , and others ) .
different buffers can be detected by means of a packet loss pattern analysis when more than one bottleneck is in the path .
in most cases , one buffer is the main cause of packet loss in a network path and sometimes two buffers can get into overflow at the same time in an access network ; for this reason , we will use as an example the case of two concatenated buffers to present this methodology ( figure 5 ) .
the output rate can be easily determined by the destination trace because we know all arrived packets and the time of each one ; see figure 6 .
also , the input rate can be estimated counting the dropped packets in the destination trace by means of the sequence number included in the payload .
a packet loss map is useful not only to determine the amount of losses but also to observe the packet loss patterns which may define each buffer model .
it is a simple packet loss scatter ( see figure 7 ) .
we should note that the information on this map is equivalent to the buffer occupancy under the same conditions , also a simple way to see the packet loss patterns ( hop sequence ) which are difficult to deduce from figure 6 .
the methodology consists of four simple steps which will be described as follows : ( 1 ) methodology {===> analyze packet loss patterns ===> determine rates ===> infer locations ===> estimate buffer size .
3.3.1 .
analyze packet loss patterns the analysis consists of determining the number of congested buffers and the packet loss rate of each one .
as an example , in figure 7 we can see two different patterns which correspond to two buffers .
the packet loss for the first is 60 packets per burst , while the second only drops 1 packet per burst .
also , we can find the number of dropped packets in a given period of time t rx for buffer 1 ( n 1 ) and buffer 2 ( n 2 ) .
3.3.2 .
determine rates the output rate ( r 3 in figure 6 ) can be calculated with ( 2 ) , from the destination trace because we know all the arrived packets , n , and the arrival time of each one ; see figure 6 .
the input rate ( r 1 in figure 6 ) is obtained with the arrived packets and all the dropped ones ( 3 ) .
we must estimate the rates in the period in which we observed all the packet loss patterns t rx ( see figures 6 and 7 ) since it has been observed that it is the most stable period in terms of output rate and packet loss .
consider ( 2 ) r3 = pltrxxn , ( 3 ) r1 = pltrxx ( n + n1 + n2 ) , where p l is the packet length .
if we obtain several packet loss patterns ( see figure 6 ) , we can also calculate intermediate rates .
when there are two buffers in the path a general equation ( 4 ) can be defined in which two values can be found .
the intermediate rate calculation ( r 2 in figure 6 ) will generate two different possible values .
in order to obtain the correct value , a new test with a new generated rate between these two value rates is needed .
if the results show ( by observing packet loss maps ) that both buffers are overflowed then the correct value is the lowest one ; otherwise it is the highest .
consider ( 4 ) r2 ={ pltrxx ( n + n1 ) pltrxx ( n + n2 ) .
3.3.3 .
infer locations the packet loss rate is defined by the relationship between input and output rates of any buffer .
so , when the packet loss rate of each buffer is known , we can compare the rate with the relationship of the input and output rates ( r 1 , r 2 , and r 3 ) to obtain the buffer position ; see figure 6 .
3.3.4 .
estimate buffer size when we know the buffer input and output rates , then buffer size can be estimated if we find the latency of a packet in the buffer when it is full .
in this case , we use the last received packet before the first packet loss , as it is shown in figure 8 , because this is the packet which completely fills the buffer .
in addition the sequence number ( sn ) of this packet n can give us the number of packets sent in certain time t. the nth packet gets into the buffer m in a time : t m = n * p l / r m , and the output time is t m + 1 = n * p l / r m + 1 .
the packet latency is t m + 1 - t m , so the buffer size , in packets , of the m buffer can be estimated using ( 5 ) , which only depends on the rates relationship and the n arrived packets before the packet loss in each buffer .
the number of arrived packets to a certain buffer , before the first packet loss , depends on which buffer drops packets first and the physical location of the buffer ( see figure 6 ) described above. from figure 6 we know that buffer 1 is physically before buffer 2 , so the dropped packets by buffer 1 will never arrive to buffer 2. from figure 7 we know that buffer 1 is the first one in dropping packets , so we can deduce that n 1 = sn1 and n 2 = sn2 - n 1 .
the same analysis can be applied when buffer 2 is before buffer 1 .
in this case the dropped packets by buffer 2 successfully pass through buffer 1 , so n 1 = sn1 and n 2 = sn2 .
consider ( 5 ) sizebufferm =( tm + 1 - tm ) xrm + 1pl = nmx ( 1 - rm + 1rm ). with the aim of determining if the buffer is measured in number of bytes or packets , a new test should be done ; in this case , the new test burst of udp packets should use a different packet length .
now , we can calculate buffer size for all tests and compare the results : if the buffer size is the same for all tests , the buffer is measured in number of packets if not in bytes .
4. experimental results real tests have been deployed in a testbed and results are analyzed according to the procedures cited above .
we have implemented a controlled network environment in order not only to reproduce the scenario in figure 5 but also to study two different devices : a switch ( 3com ) and a wi - fi access point ( linksys wap54g ) .
the topology is shown in figure 9 .
the wireless link capacity is set to 11 mbps .
packets of different sizes ( 200 , 400 , 1000 , 1500 bytes ) are used to determine if the buffer is measured in number of packets or in bytes .
the presented results are the most significant .
4.1 .
characterizing the path 4.1.1 .
analyze packet loss patterns in order to obtain a reliable packet - loss map that permits the pattern analysis and be the least intrusive as possible , we generated a traffic of 20 mbps with a packet length of 1500 bytes , which is considerably bigger than link capacity and it is not so intrusive as the interface maximum output rate .
figure 10 ( a ) shows two different packet loss patterns which can be determined by observing the groups of packets around the same packet loss value .
the first pattern is roughly 45 packets and the second one 205 .
the second pattern is very constant while the first presents some dispersion .
4.1.2 .
determine rates we obtain output and input rates using ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in the stable period ; however output rate presents more variations due to wi - fi behaviour .
the results are r 3 = 6.5 mbps ( average ) and r 1 = 20 mbps .
figure 10 ( a ) shows two patterns , so there is an intermediate rate r 2. from ( 4 ) we obtain two possible values : r 2a = 18 mbps and r 2b = 10 mbps .
in order to choose the correct value a new test is deployed with a rate of 16 mbps ( a value between r 2a and r 2b ) .
the results can be seen in figure 10 ( b ) , which shows that two packet loss patterns appear .
this means that both buffers get into overflow ( the first pattern still maintains its value in 45 packets , but the second one has decreased to 160 ) ; thus the intermediate rate is 10 mbps .
4.1.3 .
infer locations if we consider the buffer order as shown in figure 6 and the obtained results ( r 1 = 20 mbps , r 2 = 10 mbps , and r 3 = 6.5 mbps ) , buffer 1 must lose half the arrived packets , but buffer 2 only 35 % .
we compare these results with each packet loss pattern and we infer that buffer 1 drops bursts of 205 packets and buffer 2 drops bursts of 45 .
furthermore , buffer 2 may correspond to the wi - fi access point buffer because it has more variations in the number of packets per burst .
4.1.4 .
estimate buffer size from the destination capture we can observe that the first burst of dropped packets corresponds to buffer 2 despite having a lowest filling rate than buffer 1 .
this is due to the time to completely fill buffer 2 is smaller than buffer 1 , so sizebuffer2 < sizebuffer1 .
we obtained the buffer size for buffer 1 ( switch ) and buffer 2 ( access point ) using ( 5 ) with n 1 = 240 and n 2 = 143 .
the maximum buffer sizes are roughly 120 packets for the switch and 50 packets ( average ) for the access point , which correspond to the technical characteristics provided by the manufacturer .
the test was repeated with different packet sizes obtaining the same results for buffer sizes , so we conclude that both buffers are measured in number of packets ( figure 11 ) .
this methodology can be used for a deep analysis of a single device , the most restrictive , for example , observing the packet size effect .
5. conclusion this paper has presented a methodology which is useful in order to describe the technical and functional characteristics of commercial buffers on a network path .
this characterization is important , taking into account that the buffer may modify the traffic characteristics .
tests using commercial devices have been deployed in a controlled laboratory scenario , including wired and wireless devices .
accurate results of the buffer size and other parameters have been obtained .
we have demonstrated that buffers may be analyzed independently of other devices .
as a future line , more than two buffers will be studied by packet loss pattern analysis .
